# Reading, writing and... a real problem for many
## 
### Dan Mendelsohn 
Anyone who has passed through
the rigors of freshmen require
ments can attest to the fact that
the ability to read is a skill nec
essary for survival on the college
campus.
Because this ability is so natu
ral to Stanford students, many fail
to realize that illiteracy is a huge
problem in our nation, as well as
within the Stanford community.
As a result, fewer students take
the initiative to help combat this
problem than work against other,
more "high-profile" social con
cerns such as AIDS or hunger.
In a nation where as many as
71 million adults are either func
tionally or partially illiterate, how
ever, it is clear that more needs
to be done.
This week, designated National
Campus Literacy Awareness
Week, might help in the struggle
to make words public domain â€”
at both Tresidder Union's kitchen
to soup kitchens in New York.
Cyndy Yu, coordinator of the
Student Volunteer Network, ad
mits that there is not enough
being done at Stanford to fight
illiteracy.
"At Stanford, a highly compete
tive school where education is
valued, it is ironic that not much
is done by undergraduates to aid
the illiterate," Yu said.
From Oct. 17-21, campuses
across the country will sponsor
programs targeting rampant il
literacy in the United States. At
Stanford, the campaign is being
sponsored as a joint project be
tween two groups, the student-run
Stanford Volunteer Network and
the Stanford Literacy Project, an
adminstration-initiated organiza
tion.
Nationwide, this program is
sponsored by Campus Compact,
a collegiate public service founda

tion. University President Donald
Kennedy serves as a member of
the Board of Directors for this
group. Project Literacy U.S., an
association of the television net
works ABC and PBS, is also af
filiated with the program.
According to Yu, the two pri
mary goals of devoting a week to
focus on illiteracy are to help
make people aware of the literacy
problem, and to encourage and
facilitate the integration of stu
dents as actors in the solution.
Above all, Campus Literacy
Awareness Week aims to focus at
tention on the pressing concerns
of illiteracy.
"Too often, students aren't
aware of what's going on, and of
what they can do to help," said
Lydia Sandoval, education direc
tor for the Volunteer Network.
While many students are active
in public service, the problems of
homelessness and hunger gain the
most attention and therefore the
most volunteers, she added.
Although these problems are
very pertinent social concerns, the
facts about illiteracy are no less
grim. The U.S. Department of Ed
ucation reports that 26 million
Americans (encompassing all com
munities, geographic areas, eco
nomic classes and ethnic groups)
cannot read or write well enough
to perform such basic tasks as
addressing an envelope.
In addition, 45 million more
adults are only somewhat com
petent at similar skills. Alto
gether, nearly one in three Amer
icans can be considered illiterate
to some degree.
Stanford's Literacy Awareness
Week, coordinated by Sandoval
and Literacy Project Director
Pedro Castaneda, consists of three
events. The first, held yes
terday, was a presentation ad
dressing illiteracy in America with
speeches by a professor from the
School of Education and a literacy

students, many fail
to realize that il
literacy is a huge
problem in our na

within the Stanford
community.

coordinator for the Santa Clara
Office of Education, as well as a
presentation of new computer
software designed to help teach
basic reading and writing skills.
Today, Lathrop House, the Na
tive American theme house, will
be hosting a panel of adults who
have overcome illiteracy along
with the tutors who helped make
their education possible.
Among the panel members dis
cussing their struggles and expe
riences will be a pair from the
Literacy Project. For three years,
this project has paired student
tutors with Stanford workers who
need help with reading and writ
ing. One focus of this pro
gram has been bilingual
education, as many of Stanford's
workers are Spanish speakers.
The panel will begin at 7 p.m.
On Thurday, the Toyon eating
clubs will feature a viewing of the
PBS documentary "First Things
First" at 7 p.m. A discussion will
follow the film, which is a one
hour look at the cycle of illiteracy
within families and the attempt
to break this cycle. Among the
