It would take a strong,
strong fireman
Word out of London is that the master tapes to
Rick Astley's second LP were destroyed in a fire
at the Workhouse Studios. He was completing
work on the follow-up to last year's sizzling (pun
intended) debut album "Whenever You Need
Somebody."
Luckily, the backup tapes were stored
elsewhere, so after a small amount of
re-recording his hot new album will hit the
shelves in February.
But is it art?
RCA is offering retailers two album covers for
heavyish metal band Lightning's new LP,
"Lightning Strike." The "clean" cover features a
photo of the band, while the "bad" cover has a
skull and crossbone graphic and the word
"Mutherfâ€”er" (use your imagination) scrawled
across the top.
So far, retailers have ordered five times as
many albums with the "bad" cover as with the
"clean" one.
RCA Senior Marketing Director Randy Miller
says"the design of the controversial cover is
designed for the audience we want to reach with
this LP." We suspect you could also reach that
audience by frequenting several of the finer
correctional institutions in the vicinity.
