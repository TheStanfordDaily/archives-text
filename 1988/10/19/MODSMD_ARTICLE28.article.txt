Two highly acclaimed ensembles will
present a variety of chamber and or
chestral music on campus this week,
sponsored by The Lively Arts at Stan
ford.
The Boston Chamber Music Society
will perform tonight at 8 p.m. in Dink
elspiel Auditorium. The eight-member
ensemble (seven strings plus piano) will
play three 19th-century works: Beetho
ven's Piano Quartet in E-flat Mtyor,
Op. 16; Brahms's Piano Trio in C Mtyor,
Op. 87; and Dvorak's Sextet for Strings
in A Mtyor, Op. 48.
Founded in 1981 the Society has
played to enthusiastic audiences and
critics in New England, New York and
France. The Society is currently en
sembled in residence at the Boston Con
servatory.

A small string section
trades full-bodied
lushness for bright
incisivness.

The Scottish Chamber Orchestra,
conducted by Sir Peter Maxwell Davies,
will perform Sunday, October 23 at 2
p.m. in Memorial Auditorium.
Chamber orchestras differ from con
ventional symphonic orchestras in that,
while the basic woodwind, brass and
string instruments are represented, the
numbers are markedly reduced. Wood
winds and brass are held to one per
part, and a small string section trades
full-bodied lushness for bright incisive
ness. The result is an ensemble large
enough for the Baroque, Classical, and
early Romantic orchestral repertoire,
but small enough to preserve something
of the intimacy, internal clarity and
soloistic flavor of chamber music.
With 36 players, the Scottish Cham
ber Orchestra has the versatility to
adapt to the demands of many musical
styles and genres. Sunday's program
will draw on the 18th- and 20th-century
repertoire for which the orchestra has
been most widely recognized.
Two major works by Mozart will be
featured: the Symphony No. 39 in E-flat
K. 543; and the Piano Concerto
No. 20 in D Minor, K. 466, with young
Philippine-born pianist Cecile Licad as
soloist.
Davies, one of Britain's most
respected composers, will conduct two
of his own works as well. "An Orkney
Wedding, with Sunrise" was commis
sioned for the Boston Pops in 1985,

and portrays a boisterous wedding in
the Orkneys — complete with country
musicians and rowdy guests — and ends
with a lone bagpiper who heralds the
break of day.
Davies will also present his
"Strathclyde" Concerto No. 1 for oboe
and Orchestra, the first of a projected
series of 10 concertos he is writing for
the principal players of the Scottish
Chamber orchestra. Principal oboist
Robin Miller, who premiered the work
in April of this year, will be the featured
soloist.
Since its founding in 1974, the Scot
tish Chamber Orchestra has been very
active on the international concert cir
cuit, and has performed with such
renowned soloists as Alfred Brendel,
Jean-Pierre Rampal, Dame Joan Suth
erland and Pinchas Zukerman. The or
chestra also boasts a rapidly expanding
discography, with 12 new recordings
this past season alone. The present
North American tour marks the third
for the orchestra — the first with Davies
as conductor.

Information and tickets for both con
certs are available at the Tresidder
Ticket Office (723-4317).


The Boston Chamber Music Society's concert tonight is one of two chances
to catch chamber music on campus this week. The Scottish Chamber Or
chestra plays Sunday afternoon.
