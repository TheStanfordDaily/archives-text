# Senator Nunn to promote 'Citizen Corps' in speech
## 
### Robert Landon 
Hoping to gain support for a new federal
program that would link educational op
portunities to public service, Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., will speak here at noon today.
Nunn, along with Sen. Barbara Mikulski,
D-Md., Bennett Johnston, D-La., and Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy, will dis
cuss "Citizen Corps" — a program calling
for college-age students to participate in
public service.
Describing the Citizen Corps as a "G.I.
Bill concept," Nunn said the plan encour
ages students just out of high school to
participate in some kind of military or
social service for one or two years.
In return, the federal government would
provide vouchers that could be used to
defray educational expenses, to pay for job
training or to make a down payment on a
home.
Nunn's present proposal calls for a
$10,000 voucher for each year of service.
In a telephone interview yesterday, Nunn
specifically urged interested Stanford stu
dents to offer suggestions and criticisms
about his proposal.
"We want to hear from people who are
close to these issues and who care," he
said. "It is a chance for them to make a
real difference in a policy that is still being
shaped."
There is some resistance to Nunn's plan,
however. Opponents argue that the pro
gram will become almost mandatory for
poorer students if all other aid is dis
mantled. And wealthier students who do
not need the program's benefits will in a
sense be exempt from national service, op

ponents say.
Nunn said the only way to completely
avoid this socio-economic dilemma is
through a draft — which he said is out of
the question at this point.
Instead, he said he hopes that service in
the Corps will be seen as a "badge of honor"
and that the honor itself will attract middle
to upper-class youth.
According to Nunn, the Citizen Corps
appeals to "common sense" and is not a
partisan issue. He pointed out that Joh
McKain, a former Republican congressman,
supports the plan.
Fiscal concerns about the plan have also
arisen. But Nunn, himself a fiscal conser
vative, said the program will pay for itself.
The program, which will cost about $7
billion a year, is roughly equivalent to the
amount of aid that present programs pro
vide college students. According to Nunn's
proposal, the present programs would
gradually be phased out.
Nunn said the Citizen Corps aims to
meet four goals.
"Most importantly," he said, "it will en
courage young people to participate in civic
endeavours."
According to Nunn, young people want
to get involved in public service but often
do not know how. "The Citizen Corp will
give them direction," he said.
Second, Nunn said, "Youthful energy of
course will provide needed social services
— services that are not provided because
of severe fiscal problems at both the state
and federal level."
If the program is initiated, Nunn said
high school graduates could make
particularly effective contribu
tions in the areas of care for the
elderly, day care and literacy
training.
Third, Nunn said the program
will help students pay for their
college education. He emphasized
that this program is an "earned
benefit program instead of an en
titlement program."
He said he would like to see
the Citizen Corps replace some
programs which presently provide
aid to college students, such as
guaranteed student loans and Pell
grants.
Instead of merely receiving gov
ernment hand-outs, students "will
have the sense that they have
earned" their government

benefits, he said.
Finally, Nunn said he hopes the
Citizen Corp will encourage a
sense of obligation — for those
interested in pursuing a career in
public service and for those "who
go on to business."
The Democratic Leadership
Council, which Nunn chairs, en
dorses the proposal for the Citizen
Corps.
