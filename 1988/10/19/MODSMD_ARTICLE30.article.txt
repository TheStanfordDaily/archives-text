## Golfers ace UOP Invite Cevaer, Funseth blaze trail for Cardinal 
### Bruce Sarkisian Editorial staff 
Victories have been few and far between for the
Stanford men's golf team over the past few years,
but with this year's young yet wizened squad, coach
Wally Goodwin feels that he may have a gem on
his hands. And rightly so.

Cardinal wins UOP Invite

After starting the day tied for fourth place in the
Robertson Homes/University of the Pacific Invita
tional in Woodbridge, the Cardinal came out swing
ing in the final round, firing an incredible 367 as
a team. The score, an average of 73.4 strokes per
man, was good enough to vault the squad into first
place for the tourney.
For the 54-hole tourney, the Cardinal had a best
in-recent-memory score fo 868 strokes, four better
than second-place Fresno State, Oregon State and
New Mexico Stanford bested rcceiit nemesis
Nevada-Reno, which beat the golfers twice in two
tournaments, by a full 11 strokes.
"I didn't think we had a chance [to win] going
into the final round," Goodwin said. "We played
well here .... I was really proud of the guys. It's
certainly the lowest score I've seen since I've been
[at Stanford]."

Leading the way for Stanford were freshman
fireball Christian Cevaer and junior Mark Funseth.
The two tied for second overall in the tournament
with a fine 64-hole score of 214 (69-71-74 for Cevaer,
and 73-72-69 for Funseth). Other contributors to
the Cardinal's winning tally were Josh Zander at
217, Don Christensen at 225, and Brad Joondeph
at 230.
Playing on the short (6,300-yard) but narrow
Woodbridge Country Club course in the Central
Valley, the golfers had to play conservatively. "It
was a typical older, inland California golf course.
There were a lot of doglegs, traps and trees on the
course," Goodwin said, "you couldn't just pound at
the ball."
With the win, Goodwin feels confident about the
future of golf at Stanford. "On our good days we
can beat anyone in the [Pacific 10 Conference]," he
opined. Those are words of confidence considering
that the Pac-10 includes such golfing powerhouses
as Arizona, Arizona State and UCLA.
Last year, Stanford had an incredible comeback
in the final round of the Pac-10 Championship
Tournament to finish in fourth place. With the
added talent and experience the team will bring to
this spring's Championship, a finish in the top
echelon would not be out of reach.
Goodwin credits his young star Cevaer with much
of the team's recent success. "He sets a standard.
The other guys are going to have to play their
shorts off to stay with him. And that's good," Good
win said.
