# Coach thrives in Seoul
## 
### Andrew Wilcox 
Fresh from competition in the
XXIV Olympiad in Seoul, South
Korea, Stanford field hockey
coach Sheryl Johnson is again
making the transition from player
to coach in her fourth season
leading the Cardinal sticksters.
Johnson, a three-time U.S.
Olympic team member and co
captain of the national team, said
that despite the U.S. team's poor
finish (eighth out of eight teams),
the Seoul Games were a great
experience.
"Competition around the world
is getting better and better. The
top eight teams are so close that
the standings would have been
totally different if the same teams
played each other in a different
tournament," Johnson said. She
opined that the U.S. squad rarely
played well in both halves of a
game, often making the competi
tion frustrating.
The Stanford coach starred in
dividually for the U.S., scoring
two of the team's six goals from
her midfield position, including
one against world powerhouse
Holland and a game-tying goal
against Great Britain.
Although the press ballyhooed
the culture shock for American
athletes and Seoul's tumultuous
political situation, Johnson said
these factors had little if any ef
fect on the U.S. hockey team. Stu
dent demonstrations had died
down and security was tight, she
noted. "The Olympic village had
a great set-up .... They took good
care of the athletes."
The only significant problem
with the Olympic village was the
food, Johnson said. However, this
was remedied by frequent trips to
Korean Pizza Huts and dinners
given by sponsors for American
athletes. Another interesting
aspect of her stay in Seoul was
her encounters with Korean taxi
drivers, who gave the athletes per
functory Korean lessons while
careening through the Seoul
streets, teaching her "key words"
shouted at other drivers.
The Olympic village also
created unity among American
athletes from different sports.
Johnson explained that the
hockey team shared a dormitory

with track and field athletes and
tennis players, and she often saw
tennis stars Pam Shriver and
Chris Evert.
Professional tennis players, who
never had participated in the
Olympics before as the sport made
its debut in Seoul, viewed the
Games with the same anticipa
tion, excitement and patriotism as
other athletes, Johnson added,
which surprised her considering
the fact that many of them are
millionaires.
Johnson said that the hockey
team prepared for the different
culture by traveling to Korea last
year for a tournament. Whereas
in 1987 construction of Olympic
venues was underway, she noted
that during the Games, Seoul was
resplendent with Olympic banners
on every street and a "general
Olympic spirit."
The Seoul Olympics presented
a sharp contrast to the 1984 Sum
mer Olympics in Los Angeles, ac
cording to Johnson. "Walking into
the stadium, hearing the cheers
for the opening and closing cere
monies in our own country was
overwhelming."
On the other hand, Johnson
said the Korean crowd was almost
silent during the opening and
closing ceremonies, a reflection of
Korean culture. American fans
also turned out in full force during
the '84 hockey games, contribu
ting to the team's bronze medal
finish, while sparse crowds and a
meager press corps supported the
American sticksters in Seoul,
Johnson noted.
One humorous aspect of
Johnson's Olympic experience oc
curred upon her return to the
U.S. As soon as she stepped off
the plane at 5:30 a.m., she was
greeted by a band of Cardinal
hockey players disguised as Hare
Krishnas, waving signs and parad
ing around the airport clothed in
sheets.
Although she has played on the
national team for 10 years,
Johnson is not ready to hang up
her cleats and is aiming to lead
the U.S. team to the 1992 Olym
pics in Barcelona, Spain. Because
of the team's poor finish in the
Seoul Olympics and the World
Cup, the U.S. must undergo a
tough requalifying process to gain

a berth in the 1992 field, Johnson
said.
She added that she continues
to be motivated and interested in
the game because of constant ad
vances and changes in the sport
of hockey. "There is always some
thing new to work on. ... The
women are being influenced and
picking up tricks from the men's
game."
Hockey is becoming faster, as
all international play is on
astroturf, more aerial, with
players learning to flick the ball
long distances in the air and
higher scoring, according to
Johnson. The men's game, which
is popular internationally, is
growing in the U.S., she added.
Membership on the national
team entails year-round training,

Johnson said. "The nucleus of the
team is chosen at the beginning
of the four years (before each
Olympics)." The team then takes
several international tours each
year to play in tournaments and
convenes for training camps in
the U.S. throughout the year. One
highlight of the team's rigorous
schedule is the opportunity to
travel all over the world for tour
naments, Johnson said.
Another benefit of playing on
the national team, she noted, is
that it helps her as a coach, as
she can see things from a player's
viewpoint. She added, "I get more
nervous and frustrated coaching
than playing because I can't do
anything about what's happen
ing on the field."

the U.S. team to the 1992 Olym
pics in Barcelona, Spain. Because
of the team's poor finish in the
Seoul Olympics and the World
Cup, the U.S. must undergo a
tough requalifying process to gain

a berth in the 1992 field, Johnson
said.
She added that she continues
to be motivated and interested in
the game because of constant ad
vances and changes in the sport
of hockey. "There is always some
thing new to work on. ... The
women are being influenced and
picking up tricks from the men's
game."
Hockey is becoming faster, as
all international play is on
astroturf, more aerial, with
players learning to flick the ball
long distances in the air and
higher scoring, according to
Johnson. The men's game, which
is popular internationally, is
growing in the U.S., she added.
Membership on the national
team entails year-round training,

Johnson said. "The nucleus of the
team is chosen at the beginning
of the four years (before each
Olympics)." The team then takes
several international tours each
year to play in tournaments and
convenes for training camps in
the U.S. throughout the year. One
highlight of the team's rigorous
schedule is the opportunity to
travel all over the world for tour
naments, Johnson said.
Another benefit of playing on
the national team, she noted, is
that it helps her as a coach, as
she can see things from a player's
viewpoint. She added, "I get more
nervous and frustrated coaching
than playing because I can't do
anything about what's happen
ing on the field."

Field Hockey Coach Sheryl Johnson represented the United States
at the Seoul Olympics, playing on the U.S. field hockey squad.
Fresh from competition in the
XXIV Olympiad in Seoul, South
Korea, Stanford field hockey
coach Sheryl Johnson is again
making the transition from player
to coach in her fourth season
leading the Cardinal sticksters.
Johnson, a three-time U.S.
Olympic team member and co
captain of the national team, said
that despite the U.S. team's poor
finish (eighth out of eight teams),
the Seoul Games were a great
experience.
"Competition around the world
is getting better and better. The
top eight teams are so close that
the standings would have been
totally different if the same teams
played each other in a different
tournament," Johnson said. She
opined that the U.S. squad rarely
played well in both halves of a
game, often making the competi
tion frustrating.
The Stanford coach starred in
dividually for the U.S., scoring
two of the team's six goals from
her midfield position, including
one against world powerhouse
Holland and a game-tying goal
against Great Britain.
Although the press ballyhooed
the culture shock for American
athletes and Seoul's tumultuous
political situation, Johnson said
these factors had little if any ef
fect on the U.S. hockey team. Stu
dent demonstrations had died
down and security was tight, she
noted. "The Olympic village had
a great set-up .... They took good
care of the athletes."
The only significant problem
with the Olympic village was the
food, Johnson said. However, this
was remedied by frequent trips to
Korean Pizza Huts and dinners
given by sponsors for American
athletes. Another interesting
aspect of her stay in Seoul was
her encounters with Korean taxi
drivers, who gave the athletes per
functory Korean lessons while
careening through the Seoul
streets, teaching her "key words"
shouted at other drivers.
The Olympic village also
created unity among American
athletes from different sports.
Johnson explained that the
hockey team shared a dormitory

with track and field athletes and
tennis players, and she often saw
tennis stars Pam Shriver and
Chris Evert.
Professional tennis players, who
never had participated in the
Olympics before as the sport made
its debut in Seoul, viewed the
Games with the same anticipa
tion, excitement and patriotism as
other athletes, Johnson added,
which surprised her considering
the fact that many of them are
millionaires.
Johnson said that the hockey
team prepared for the different
culture by traveling to Korea last
year for a tournament. Whereas
in 1987 construction of Olympic
venues was underway, she noted
that during the Games, Seoul was
resplendent with Olympic banners
on every street and a "general
Olympic spirit."
The Seoul Olympics presented
a sharp contrast to the 1984 Sum
mer Olympics in Los Angeles, ac
cording to Johnson. "Walking into
the stadium, hearing the cheers
for the opening and closing cere
monies in our own country was
overwhelming."
On the other hand, Johnson
said the Korean crowd was almost
silent during the opening and
closing ceremonies, a reflection of
Korean culture. American fans
also turned out in full force during
the '84 hockey games, contribu
ting to the team's bronze medal
finish, while sparse crowds and a
meager press corps supported the
American sticksters in Seoul,
Johnson noted.
One humorous aspect of
Johnson's Olympic experience oc
curred upon her return to the
U.S. As soon as she stepped off
the plane at 5:30 a.m., she was
greeted by a band of Cardinal
hockey players disguised as Hare
Krishnas, waving signs and parad
ing around the airport clothed in
sheets.
Although she has played on the
national team for 10 years,
Johnson is not ready to hang up
her cleats and is aiming to lead
the U.S. team to the 1992 Olym
pics in Barcelona, Spain. Because
of the team's poor finish in the
Seoul Olympics and the World
Cup, the U.S. must undergo a
