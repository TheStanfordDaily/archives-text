OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) - Mark
McGwire hit a solo home run with
one out in the ninth inning as
the Oakland Athletics finally
broke through and beat Los An
geles 2-1 last night, cutting the
Dodgers' lead in the World Series
to 2-1.
McGwire fouled off three 2-2
pitches before lining a drive over
the left-center field fence for his
first hit in 10 World Series at
bats.
The blow came against Jay
Howell, making his first appear
ance since his suspension for
using pine tar in Game 3 of the
National League playoffs. It was
the first home run Howell had
given up to a right-handed batter
in 112 at-bats this season.
The Athletics managed just five
hits, but McGwire's homer was
the difference in a game in which
Oakland's bullpen did the job.
The Athletics escaped a bases
loaded, no-outs jam in the sixth
inning and Rick Honeycutt al
lowed one hit in the final two
innings for the victory. Howell en

tered in the ninth and retired Jose
Canseco on a popup before
McGwire struck his fatal blow.
The Dodgers blew a chance to
break the game open in the sixth
when they loaded the bases with
no outs but failed to score.
Danny Heep's double, John
Shelby's single and a walk to Mike
Davis finished Bob Welch, who
had never lasted beyond two-and
two-thirds innings in four
postseason starts.
The Oakland bullpen, the most
effective in the majors this year,
did its job. Left-hander Greg
Cadaret stopped lefty Mike Scios
cia on a foul popup and right
hander Gene Nelson got Jeff

Hamilton on a force at the plate
and Alfredo Griffin on a grounder
to first.
Kirk Gibson, the Dodgers' pinch
hitter deluxe in Game 1, was not
employed this time, even though
Los Angeles was at the bottom of
its batting order.
The Dodgers' ir\jury problems
worsened as starting pitcher John
Tudor and right fielder Mike Mar
shall each were forced from the
game. Tudor, bothered by hip and
elbow problems throughout the
season, left in the second inning
with more arm trouble, and Mar
shall's weak back stiffened up in
the third.
Welch and Tudor, big winners

who had done poorly in
postseasons, each started out well
on nine days' rest. Tudor got all
four batters he faced before Tim
Leary took over in the second.
Welch gave up a leadoff single
to Steve Sax and struck out the
next four batters. He fanned eight
in four innings and took a 1-0
lead into the fifth before Los An
geles scored.
Hamilton singled for his first
hit in 10 Series at-bats, advanced
on Griffin's sacrifice and came
home on Franklin Stubbs' two-out
double.
Glenn Hubbard opened with a
single off the left-field wall. Hub
bard, who stole only one base all
year, cruised into second base
when the Dodgers failed to cover
the bag and continued to third
when Scioscia's throw bounced
into center field for an error.
Hassey, a lefty starting against
the left-handed Tudor because of
his rapport with Welch, singled to
left field to score Hubbard. Has
sey was Oakland's hotest hitter
in the playoffs, going 4-for-8.
