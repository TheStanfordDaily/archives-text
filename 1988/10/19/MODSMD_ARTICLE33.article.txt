# Stanford football: An unnoticed gem
## 
### 
PSSSSST! Yeah, you. I got
a hot secret about this
football team.
No ... no ... no drugs. No
point shaving. No illegal
payoffs. Actually, it's nothing
but good news.
The bottom line is, you see,
the Stanford Cardinal is the
best .500 football team in the
country. Yeah, the best. .

Okay, you're probably saying
"That's damning with faint
praise if I ever heard it." Or,
in the vernacular, "Yeah, and
McDonalds makes the best fast
food hamburgers in the coun
try."
But I'm being sincere. The
only bad thing about this team
is that no one knows anything
about them. That includes
most of the people on the
campus.
I'm not going into another
tirade about Stanford fans, but
the fact is very few people have
been at the past two games.
Had they shown up and stayed
past halftime, they'd have seen
the Cardinal pummel San Jose
State and Arizona State.
Surely they'd realize just
how good this team is. Stan
ford's only losses have come to
teams ranked in the top 20 at
the time they met. Those same
teams — Notre Dame, USC
and Oregon — are now ranked
No. 2, No. 3 and No. 22 in the
nation.
True, Stanford's victims ha
ven't been national power
houses this year. But, the Car
dinal crushed all three. It's not
like the team pulled out a 21-20
squeaker over San Diego State,
or needed a last-second field
goal to beat the Sun Devils.
Instead, the same team that
was picked eighth in many
preseason Pacific 10 Confer
ence polls, won each of those
games in convincing fashion.
But no one knows anything
about them.
The reason for that probably
has something to do with the
loss at Notre Dame. The game
got a lot of press, ESPN cov
erage and the like — and Stan
ford put up its worst showing
all season.
Interestingly enough,
though, it was the team's only
bad game.
These guys can play ball. But
no one knows anything about
them.
The Cardinal's defensive
unit has been superb thus far.
Comerbacks Alan Grant and
Kevin Scott have not been
beaten deep on a single play
all season long.
Safeties Rob Englehardt and
Rick Theder have been tough
as nails. They've been an in
surance policy for the corners,
also protecting against the long
pass.

But no one knows anything
about them.
The linebacking corps has
also been stellar. Led by Jono
Tunney, Rob Hinckley and
Kevin Richardson, these guys
make all the plays and very
few mistakes. Tunney always
seems to be right around the
action, and Hinckley always
seems to be right around the
quarterback.
Coach Jack Elway said Rich
ardson "was like a coach on
the field." Enough said.
And the defensive line has
been nothing short of awesome.
Lester Archambeau has been
getting a ferocious pass rush
and is playing the run like an
All-American. Archambeau will
be remembered as the one of
best ever to wear the cardinal
and white.
Ray Huckestein has been ex
cellent when he's been in there.
This week will be the first time
all year he's even close to
healthy.
Scott Palmbush, the ques
tion mark going in to the
season, has been solid, if not
spectacular.
But no one knows anything
about them.
These guys make things hap
pen. Grant says they concen
trate on making the big plays,
not giving them up. The team
is fifth in the nation in turn
over margin at plus 2.0 per
game.
It'B the kind of defense that
created opportunities for the
offense. And lately, the offense
has been taking advantage
quite nicely.
Jon Volpe, the little guy who
no one believes is big enough
to be as good as he is, continues
to hit the holes with blazing
speed and bounce off tacklers
at will.
Quarterback Jason Palumbis
seems to be finding a groove
as well. The redshirt freshman
completed 72 percent of his
passes last weekend. With a
talented corps of receivers in
lcuding Walter Batson, Jim
Price, Charlie Young, Chris
Walsh and Jon Pinckney,
there's no telling what
Palumbis can do.
One of the keys to the suc
cess of the offense has been the
line. An experienced crew
anchored by Andy Sinclair at
center, the line has been giving
Palumbis time and blowing
open holes for Volpe consistent
ly.
The fact is, the Cardinal is
3-3 at the moment. If the team
beats everyone it's supposed to
they'll finish the season at 6-5
— a winning season but no
bowl bid.
If — and it's an admittedly
big if — Stanford should upset
either Washington or UCLA
and win the rest of its games,
the squad will finish 7-4 with
a 6-1 record in the last seven.
Maybe, by then someone will
know something about these
guys. If you want to find out
for yourself, come out to the
stadium this Saturday.

speed and bounce off tacklers
at will.
Quarterback Jason Palumbis
seems to be finding a groove
as well. The redshirt freshman
completed 72 percent of his
passes last weekend. With a
talented corps of receivers in
lcuding Walter Batson, Jim
Price, Charlie Young, Chris
Walsh and Jon Pinckney,
there's no telling what
Palumbis can do.
One of the keys to the suc
cess of the offense has been the
line. An experienced crew
anchored by Andy Sinclair at
center, the line has been giving
Palumbis time and blowing
open holes for Volpe consistent
ly.
The fact is, the Cardinal is
3-3 at the moment. If the team
beats everyone it's supposed to
they'll finish the season at 6-5
— a winning season but no
bowl bid.
If — and it's an admittedly
big if — Stanford should upset
either Washington or UCLA
and win the rest of its games,
the squad will finish 7-4 with
a 6-1 record in the last seven.
Maybe, by then someone will
know something about these
guys. If you want to find out
for yourself, come out to the
stadium this Saturday.

PSSSSST! Yeah, you. I got
a hot secret about this
football team.
No ... no ... no drugs. No
point shaving. No illegal
payoffs. Actually, it's nothing
but good news.
The bottom line is, you see,
the Stanford Cardinal is the
best .500 football team in the
country. Yeah, the best. .

Okay, you're probably saying
"That's damning with faint
praise if I ever heard it." Or,
in the vernacular, "Yeah, and
McDonalds makes the best fast
food hamburgers in the coun
try."
But I'm being sincere. The
only bad thing about this team
is that no one knows anything
about them. That includes
most of the people on the
campus.
I'm not going into another
tirade about Stanford fans, but
the fact is very few people have
been at the past two games.
Had they shown up and stayed
past halftime, they'd have seen
the Cardinal pummel San Jose
State and Arizona State.
Surely they'd realize just
how good this team is. Stan
ford's only losses have come to
teams ranked in the top 20 at
the time they met. Those same
teams — Notre Dame, USC
and Oregon — are now ranked
No. 2, No. 3 and No. 22 in the
nation.
True, Stanford's victims ha
ven't been national power
houses this year. But, the Car
dinal crushed all three. It's not
like the team pulled out a 21-20
squeaker over San Diego State,
or needed a last-second field
goal to beat the Sun Devils.
Instead, the same team that
was picked eighth in many
preseason Pacific 10 Confer
ence polls, won each of those
games in convincing fashion.
But no one knows anything
about them.
The reason for that probably
has something to do with the
loss at Notre Dame. The game
got a lot of press, ESPN cov
erage and the like — and Stan
ford put up its worst showing
all season.
Interestingly enough,
though, it was the team's only
bad game.
These guys can play ball. But
no one knows anything about
them.
The Cardinal's defensive
unit has been superb thus far.
Comerbacks Alan Grant and
Kevin Scott have not been
beaten deep on a single play
all season long.
Safeties Rob Englehardt and
Rick Theder have been tough
as nails. They've been an in
surance policy for the corners,
also protecting against the long
pass.

But no one knows anything
about them.
The linebacking corps has
also been stellar. Led by Jono
Tunney, Rob Hinckley and
Kevin Richardson, these guys
make all the plays and very
few mistakes. Tunney always
seems to be right around the
action, and Hinckley always
seems to be right around the
quarterback.
Coach Jack Elway said Rich
ardson "was like a coach on
the field." Enough said.
And the defensive line has
been nothing short of awesome.
Lester Archambeau has been
getting a ferocious pass rush
and is playing the run like an
All-American. Archambeau will
be remembered as the one of
best ever to wear the cardinal
and white.
Ray Huckestein has been ex
cellent when he's been in there.
This week will be the first time
all year he's even close to
healthy.
Scott Palmbush, the ques
tion mark going in to the
season, has been solid, if not
spectacular.
But no one knows anything
about them.
These guys make things hap
pen. Grant says they concen
trate on making the big plays,
not giving them up. The team
is fifth in the nation in turn
over margin at plus 2.0 per
game.
It'B the kind of defense that
created opportunities for the
offense. And lately, the offense
has been taking advantage
quite nicely.
Jon Volpe, the little guy who
no one believes is big enough
to be as good as he is, continues
to hit the holes with blazing
speed and bounce off tacklers
at will.
Quarterback Jason Palumbis
seems to be finding a groove
