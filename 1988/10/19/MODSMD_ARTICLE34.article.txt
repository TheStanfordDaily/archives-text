# To smoke or not to smoke — a matter of money?

Which is more irresistible: a smoldering
cigarette or 100 cool dollar bills? A three
person research team at Stanford's Center
for Research in Disease Prevention is chal
lenging Bay Area residents to answer this
question and participate in a new
University-run study.
Over the next five years, with a $300
million grant from the National Heart and
backing from the Lung and Blood Institute,
Stanford Medical School researchers Dr.
Stephen Fortmann, Barbara Newman and
Joel Killen will try to learn how to help
nicotine-addicted smokers kick the habit.
The study will document the success of
monetary incentives in convincing smokers
to forgo their habit. This information could
be useful to employers who might use
similar methods to urge their smoking em
ployees to quit, and ultimately save busi
nesses considerable amounts.
One of the goals of the research is to
cut costs for those who employ smokers.
"Smokers cost employers money,"
Fortmann said, explaining that heavy
smokers' health care costs and absenteeism
significantly hurt many businesses.

Thus, the researchers chose the $100
rewards as motivation instead of an earlier
plan to offer free memberhip to a health
club.
Although the idea of enticing smokers to
quit with a financial incentive is not new,
this study is different because it is a
population-based study. And rather than
put the responsibility on volunteers to in
itiate a request for particpating, research
ers will seek out smokers and call them.
First, the researchers will call approxi
mately 14,000 randomly chosen residents
of a selected Bay Area city. The phone call
effort will not only register an estimated
2,800 smokers for the research project, but
also reveal data about the prevalence of
smokers in the area.
Once signed up to participate, the can
didates will be asked to quit for a 24-hour
period after which saliva and breath tests
will weed out the will-powered from the
weak.
The smokers who pass will proceed to
take a similar test after a longer period of
eight weeks.
The estimated 1,400 smokers expected
to pass the first tests will be required to
abstain from smoking for six months as

the final experiment of the study. Success
ful completion will constitute "quitting" —
and those who kick the habit will receive
a $100 bill.
Fortmann emphasized that "by using a
population-based study, we'll know how
successful we are in the universe of
smokers, not just the smokers who want
to quit."
In regard to the polling, Newman em
phasized, "It is very important to under
stand that we are calling the smokers to
ask for participants. We don't want volun
teers calling us."
Apparently, the Center continues to be
plagued by calls from smokers already wan
ting to quit, and hoping to make $100 along
the way. The researchers, however, hope
to research the incentive of money how
much appeal it has for helping smokers
quit. The researchers likewise hope to
explore smoking habits on a more general
level. Newman said the motivation for the
study comes from the lack of information
about the process of giving up smoking,
combined with the recent increased sensi
tivity to cigarrettes' dangers.
"We're still not sure what motivates
people to stop smoking," she added.
