# City council addresses Rains traffic and safety issues
## 
### Elaine Riggs Staff writer 
Responding to local residents' concern
over potential traffic and safety problems
stemming from the Rains Apartments, the
Palo Alto City Council laat night voted 6-0
to send five recommendations for changes
in the complex to Santa Clara County.
The recommendations constitute only an
"advisory" to the county's Architectural
and Site Approval committee because the
City of Palo Alto does not have jurisdiction
over the Stanford campus.
The countv will hear the University's
position on those recommendations by the
end of October, according to University
Director of Community Relations Andy
Doty.
The University has not yet taken a stand
on the new recommendations "because
there's no consensus between the groups
involved," Doty said. These groups include
the residents of Escondido Village, College
Terrace and the Pine Hill faculty residen
ces.

Diane Finkelstein, a member of the Col
lege Terrace Residents' Association, said
the groups are working on compromises.
"We see our concerns as common con
cerns," Finkelstein said.
Local residents have expressed concern
that the 780 residents in the newly built
Rains complex will bring heavier traffic
into the area.
One of the controversial recommenda
tions specifies that bollards should be in
stalled in the south Rains parking lot so
that motorists cannot take a shortcut from
Escondido Road to Bowdoin street through
the parking lot.
Finkelstein, who supports the city's pro
posal for the bollards, said, "Traffic safety
cannot be achieved without putting in those
controls."
The Rains residents oppose the bollards
because "they would be unable to cross
their own parking lot (and) would have to
go out of their way," Doty said.
"The University has to reconcile those
conflicting preferences. It is tricky," Doty

said.
Another controversial recommendation
calls for a halt to the plans to build a road
connecting the two Rains parking lots.
The opposing groups on the issue of cre
ating a connector road share the goal of
keeping traffic away from children.
Residents of Increment Five in Escondido
Village joined the city council in opposing

the connector road because the road would
place more cars near the residents' children.
Bing Nursery School, located on Escon
dido Road, has favored the connector road
because the road would divert traffic from
their schoolchildren, according to Doty.
The city council also approved three less
controversial recommendations last night.
"Everyone has agreed" to the right turn
in/right turn out access to Campus Drive
for the Rains complex, according to Doty.
Another recommendation asks the Uni
versity to analyze the safety of the street
crossings from Rains.
The fifth recommendation requests the
University to initiate a Rains traffic mon
itoring program. The University started
the program last week, Doty said.
Overall, according to Doty, the recom
mendations passed by the city council will
probably not meet with strong opposition
from the University.
"I don't see any real massive problems
from last night's decisions," Doty said yes
terday.
