# 'Thinker' comes to Stanford
## New Rodin sculpture to be installed in front of Meyer 
### Tim Hullar Staff writer 
Given that hundreds of happy-go
lucky students rush in and out of Meyer
Library every day, it may seem ironic
to place an Auguste Rodin sculpture
called "The Thinker" nearby.
But Art History Prof. Albert Elsen
said the statue is a welcome addition to
the University's impressive collection of
outdoor art. Only the Rodin Museum
in Paris, France has a larger collection
of Rodins.
According to Elsen, Stanford has a
collection of outdoor art "unsurpassed
by any academic institution in the
world." Elsen, a recognized authority on
Rodin and his work, is author of the
book "Rodin's Thinker and the Dilemma
of Modern Sculpture."
"The Thinker" will replace another of
Rodin's statues that was recently re
turned to the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art after a three-year loan.
Donated by B. Gerald Cantor, a fin
ancier and trustee of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in New York City, the
statue is one of only 29 casts made of
"The Thinker." Cantor has previously
donated more than 140 Rodin sculptures
to Stanford, including those in the Can
tor Rodin Sculpture Garden near the
Stanford Art Museum.

Elsen said the statue represents not
a specific person, but rather "the artist
in the broadest sense." The Thinker is
blind, deaf, mute and castrated to signify
the artist shutting out all distractions
during the creative process, according
to Elsen.
The statue was originally cast in 1880
as part of Rodin's Gates of Hell, a cast
displayed in the Sculpture Garden. Be
tween 1902 and 1904, "The Thinker"
was enlarged from 37 inches to its pres
ent height of 79 inches.
The statue caused immediate contro
versy when it first went on public display
in 1904, Elsen said. Many viewers ob
jected to the seeming conflict between
the statue's contemplative pose and its
powerful physique.
On display in front of the Pantheon
in Paris until 1922, "The Thinker" was
moved to the Rodin Museum in Paris
where it remains today.
Stanford will display "The Thinker"
in a version that closely resembles the
original, Elsen said. The pedestal, closely
copying Rodin's original, will be a rec
tangular block nearly nine feet high with
three steps at the base.
"The Thinker" will be dedicated Oct.
27. On Nov. 2 at 8:15 p.m., Elsen will
lecture on the history and meaning of
"The Thinker" in Annenberg Auditori
um.
