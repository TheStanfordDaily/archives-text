# Teller says SDI can be installed in five years

Claiming that a feasible SDI system
could be deployed within five years,
Senior Hoover Research Fellow Edward
Teller told 100 students gathered in
Branner lounge Monday night that the
system would make nuclear attack "un
profitable" for either side.
Teller, age 80, based his arguments
on what he said was new, recently
declassified information about the Stra
tegic Defense Initiative.
Teller, a physicist, is an expert and
staunch proponent of the Strategic De
fense Initiative. He has advised both

Congress and the Reagan administra
tion on the missile defense program.
Teller worked on the original Manhat
tan Project that developed the first nu
clear bomb.
According to Teller, Israel is develop
ing a defense against existing SS-21 mis
siles that will be ready in as little as
two years. Given "proper political sup
port," the United States could develop
a system within five years that would
deter the Soviet Union from attacking.
"If we have a good defense, a reason
able opponent — and I think the Soviets
are reasonable — would not attack,"
Teller said, adding that the difficulties

in developing the system are not tech
nological — but political.
But when questioned yesterday, Sid
ney Drell, deputy director of the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center and
co-director of the Stanford Center for
International Security and Arms Con
trol said that he did not see any pro
spective for deployment within five
years.
Drell, who declined to comment on
the specifics of Teller's speech, said it
would take "a decade of research" to
study aspects of any missile defense sys-
tern.
And during his speech, Teller
admitted that the system would
not screen out 100 percent of all
incoming missiles. "Nobody has
ever claimed a complete defense
is possible," he said.
But, he pointed out that even
a small ground-based laser de
fense system in the Mojave Desert
could protect 20 million people in
Southern California.
Teller went on to explain how
the current model would work.
After a missile is fired, sophis
ticated optic sensors track the
missile as it leaves the
atmoshpere. Computers in the de
fense system determine where the
enemy missile is headed.

Then, a small, extremely high
speed (one-mile-per-second)
projectile is propelled to "kill" the
enemy missile — essentially hit
ting a bullet with a bullet —
thereby destroying the missile
before its deadly atomic insides
detonate, Teller explained.
Only a few hundred of these
weapons would be necessary, he
said, and each would be self
sufficient. Different programs
could run and control the system
in different modes. For example,
the weapon could be programmed
to shoot down anything in a given
field of sight, according to Teller.
The environmental impact of
this newly designed model "will
not be noticeable," Teller said,
adding that any radioactive debris
would take so long to reach the
earth that the effects would be
unmeasureable.
