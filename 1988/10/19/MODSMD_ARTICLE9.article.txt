Claiming that a feasible SDI system
could be deployed within five years,
Senior Hoover Research Fellow Edward
Teller told 100 students gathered in
Branner lounge Monday night that the

Teller, age 80, based his arguments

Teller, a physicist, is an expert and

a system within five years that would
deter the Soviet Union from attacking.
"If we have a good defense, a reason
able opponent — and I think the Soviets
are reasonable — would not attack,"
Teller said, adding that the difficulties

in developing the system are not tech
nological — but political.
But when questioned yesterday, Sid
ney Drell, deputy director of the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center and
co-director of the Stanford Center for
International Security and Arms Con
trol said that he did not see any pro
spective for deployment within five
years.
Drell, who declined to comment on
the specifics of Teller's speech, said it
would take "a decade of research" to
study aspects of any missile defense sys-
