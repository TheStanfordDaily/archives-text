THE WASHINGTON INTERNATIONAL STUDIES CENTER
STUDY IN
OXFORD, ENGLAND
Academic Program
Several colleges of Oxford University have invited The Washington International Studies Center
(WISC) to recommend qualified students to study for one year or for one or two terms. Lower
Junior status is required, and graduate study is available. Students are directly enrolled in their
colleges and receive transcripts from their Oxford college; this is NOT a program conducted by a
U.S. college in Oxford. Oxford colleges are accredited by the U.S. Dept. of Education to
accept students with Guaranteed Student Loans. Multi-national student housing and social
activities are offered, and cultural tours are conducted by WISC. A special summer session is
directed by WISC.
INTERN IN
WASHINGTON, D.C.

by senior-level government officials, who are also scholars, and by experienced journalists. All
college students with a 3.0 GPA or above are eligible.
