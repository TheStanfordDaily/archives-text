MAKE PEACE CORPS PART OF YOUR WORLD
If you plan to graduate this year, now it the time to find
out more about new overseas opportunities
with the Peace Corps.
Applications are being accepted in all fields, with
particular emphasis on "scarce skills": Agriculture,
Engineering, Skilled Trades, Health/Nutrition, and
Math/Science teaching.
For more information, or to receive an application, call
the Peace Corps office, collect, at (415) 974-8754.
Minority students are especially encouraged to apply.
Not everyone is cut out to change
the world. After all, it takes educa
tion, skills and a spare two years.
Also a willingness to work. Hard.
This year 3,750 Americans will join
the Peace Corps to do just that.
They'll do things like build roads,
plant forests and crops, teach
English, develop small businesses,
train community health workers,
or even coach basketball. However,
what they'll be doing isn't half as
important as the fact that they'll be
changing a little piece of the world
.. .for the better.
And when they return, these
3,750 Americans will find that
experience doing hard work will
have another benefit. It's exactly
what their next employers are
looking for.
So, give the Peace Corps your next
two years. And while you're out
changing the world, you'll also be
making a place in it for yourself.
