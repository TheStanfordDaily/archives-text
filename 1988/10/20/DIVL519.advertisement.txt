Got a gripe?
Do our columnists aggravate you? Do
our stories put you to sleep? Are you
getting sick of all the Hershiser stuff?
Does the Greek-of-the-Week strike you
as just a bit too self-indulgent?
If so, sit down at your computer and
write us a letter. We may even print it
if we're in a really good mood.
Send comments, criticisms and food to:
Sports Mailbag
c/o The Stanford Daily
Storke Publications Building
Stanford, CA 94305
Or, bring the letters to our office
across from Terman Pond.
