## 
### Aileen Resnick 
Berating the current adminis
tration's failure to vigorously en
force the Clean Air Act, Anna
Eshoo, the Democratic candidate
for the 12th Congressional dis
trict, expressed her concern for
the environment on KZSU's
Campus Conference program
Tuesday night.

She said the Reagan adminis
tration has "stood by the side of
the road and been ... part of a
wrecking crew" in regards to en
vironmental issues.
Campus Conference is a half
hour interview show broadcast on
KZSU every Tuesday at 7:30 p.m.
It highlights people and issues
that affect the Stanford commu
nity. Next week's Campus Con
ference features Eshoo's op

ponent, Republican candidate
Tom Campbell.
Many jurisdictions, Eshoo said,
are "not doing what they need to
do" in order to comply with
federal regulations concerning air
quality. The complaint made by
several states and communities
that they are unable to comply
with such regulation is "an excuse
— and not a very good one," Es
hoo said.
However, Eshoo said the gov
ernment should work with busi
nesses and communities to help
them comply with regulations and
that "if local jurisdictions and
states begin to understand that
the federal government... is very
serious about air districts across
the nation" they will work toward
attainment of the act's goals.
Eshoo also stated her support
for federal legislation concerning
offshore oil drilling, which she
said is both an environmental and
an economic issue. As a member
of the San Mateo County Board
of Supervisors, Eshoo sued the
Department of the Interior twice

to stop the sale of offshore oil
leases.
"The 101st Congress ... will
deal with legislation that will
create clean sanctuaries so that
once and for all we will protect
what God has given to us," Eshoo
said.
When asked about her position
on foreign investment in the
United States, Eshoo said she
thinks the government must de
termine the extent of foreign in
vestment before it can impose
limitations.
"The idea is not to chill foreign
investment .. . but to determine
how much of America we want
owned by [foreigners]," Eshoo
said. "We can't even begin to plan
if we don't have a place that gath
ers the data ... so that we know
who owns what."
Eshoo also expressed her sup
port for the Act for Better Child
Care, a bill presently moving
through Congress. The issue of
child care, Eshoo said, "is not a
welfare/women's issue any
more. ... It is an economic deter

minant in peoples' lives."
She said the main problems
with child care programs today
are the shortage of child care
centers and the affordability of
such care. She noted that Califor
nia would receive $237 million un
der the present form of the bill.
"Every time you make an in
vestment in the family you
strengthen the community and
you strengthen the nation," Eshoo
said.
Eshoo came down strongly on
her opponent's support of the con
troversial Supreme Court nomi
nation of Robert Bork. Campbell
testified for Bork last year. "It's
1988, not 1788," she said in ref
erence to Bork's reactionary
views. She said even though
Campbell claimed he supported
Bork only in a number of labor
related issues, it was important
to focus on all of Bork's views.
"What part of Bork did
[Campbell] want to send to the
Supreme Court?" Eshoo asked.
Subodh Chandra, chair of the
Stanford Democrats, supported

Eshoo's criticism of Campbell.
"To pose as a moderate ... and
testify in favor of Bork's nomina
tion is fundamentally inconsis
tent," Chandra said.
Law student Paul Rothstein,
Campbell's Stanford coordinator,
countered Eshoo's accusation,
saying "the key issue" relative to
Campbell's support of Bork is
"Campbell's stance on abortion."
Rothstein said Campbell, unlike
Bork, is "pro-choice."
Rothstein said he felt Eshoo did
not "address the key issue of ex
perience" during the 30-minute
interview. "While [Eshoo] would
be learning the ropes," Rothstein
said, "[Campbell] would hit the
ground running."
Campbell, a Stanford law pro
fessor, has never held elective of
fice.
Campbell has clerked in the Su
preme Court, worked in the White
House, run an agency of the
Federal Trade Commission and
served as executive assistant to
the deputy attorney general of the
United States.

views. She said even though
Campbell claimed he supported
Bork only in a number of labor
related issues, it was important
to focus on all of Bork's views.
"What part of Bork did
[Campbell] want to send to the
Supreme Court?" Eshoo asked.
Subodh Chandra, chair of the
Stanford Democrats, supported

Eshoo's criticism of Campbell.
"To pose as a moderate ... and
testify in favor of Bork's nomina
tion is fundamentally inconsis
tent," Chandra said.
Law student Paul Rothstein,
Campbell's Stanford coordinator,
countered Eshoo's accusation,
saying "the key issue" relative to
Campbell's support of Bork is
"Campbell's stance on abortion."
Rothstein said Campbell, unlike
Bork, is "pro-choice."
Rothstein said he felt Eshoo did
not "address the key issue of ex
perience" during the 30-minute
interview. "While [Eshoo] would
be learning the ropes," Rothstein
said, "[Campbell] would hit the
ground running."
Campbell, a Stanford law pro
fessor, has never held elective of
fice.
Campbell has clerked in the Su
preme Court, worked in the White
House, run an agency of the
Federal Trade Commission and
served as executive assistant to
the deputy attorney general of the
United States.
Berating the current adminis
tration's failure to vigorously en
force the Clean Air Act, Anna
Eshoo, the Democratic candidate
for the 12th Congressional dis
trict, expressed her concern for
the environment on KZSU's
Campus Conference program
Tuesday night.

She said the Reagan adminis
tration has "stood by the side of
the road and been ... part of a
wrecking crew" in regards to en
vironmental issues.
Campus Conference is a half
hour interview show broadcast on
KZSU every Tuesday at 7:30 p.m.
It highlights people and issues
that affect the Stanford commu
nity. Next week's Campus Con
ference features Eshoo's op

ponent, Republican candidate
Tom Campbell.
Many jurisdictions, Eshoo said,
are "not doing what they need to
do" in order to comply with
federal regulations concerning air
quality. The complaint made by
several states and communities
that they are unable to comply
with such regulation is "an excuse
— and not a very good one," Es
hoo said.
However, Eshoo said the gov
ernment should work with busi
nesses and communities to help
them comply with regulations and
that "if local jurisdictions and
states begin to understand that
the federal government... is very
serious about air districts across
the nation" they will work toward
attainment of the act's goals.
Eshoo also stated her support
for federal legislation concerning
offshore oil drilling, which she
said is both an environmental and
an economic issue. As a member
of the San Mateo County Board
of Supervisors, Eshoo sued the
Department of the Interior twice

to stop the sale of offshore oil
leases.
"The 101st Congress ... will
deal with legislation that will
create clean sanctuaries so that
once and for all we will protect
what God has given to us," Eshoo
said.
When asked about her position
on foreign investment in the
United States, Eshoo said she
thinks the government must de
termine the extent of foreign in
vestment before it can impose
limitations.
"The idea is not to chill foreign
investment .. . but to determine
how much of America we want
owned by [foreigners]," Eshoo
said. "We can't even begin to plan
if we don't have a place that gath
ers the data ... so that we know
who owns what."
Eshoo also expressed her sup
port for the Act for Better Child
Care, a bill presently moving
through Congress. The issue of
child care, Eshoo said, "is not a
welfare/women's issue any
more. ... It is an economic deter

minant in peoples' lives."
She said the main problems
with child care programs today
are the shortage of child care
centers and the affordability of
such care. She noted that Califor
nia would receive $237 million un
der the present form of the bill.
"Every time you make an in
vestment in the family you
strengthen the community and
you strengthen the nation," Eshoo
said.
Eshoo came down strongly on
her opponent's support of the con
troversial Supreme Court nomi
nation of Robert Bork. Campbell
testified for Bork last year. "It's
1988, not 1788," she said in ref
erence to Bork's reactionary
views. She said even though
Campbell claimed he supported
Bork only in a number of labor
related issues, it was important
to focus on all of Bork's views.
"What part of Bork did
[Campbell] want to send to the
Supreme Court?" Eshoo asked.
Subodh Chandra, chair of the
