## S. Africans leave sanctuary Government promises anti-apartheid activists freedom 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South
Africa (AP) â€” Three anti
apartheid activists who escaped
from custody and fled to the U.S.
Consulate five weeks ago emerged
yesterday and pledged to resume
their opposition to the govern
ment.
South African authorities say
they won't arrest the three, who
had been jailed without charge for
more a year before they slipped
away from police guards and fled
to the consulate Sept. 13.
The activists, all senior officials
of banned anti-apartheid organi
zations, spent the next 36 nights
in a consular meeting room on
the 11th floor of a Johannesburg
office building.
The three said they had little
faith in the government's promise
not to act against them.
"Our experience with the gov
ernment is that we must be very
cautious and not accept anything

at face value," said Murphy
Morobe.
But they added they were in
fluenced to leave their sanctuary
on the advice of jailed African Na
tional Congress leader Nelson
Mandela.
"The view of comrade Nelson
Mandela was that we should leave
the consulate as soon as possible,
and that assisted us in our deci
sion," said Mohammed Valli
Moosa.
Mandela's message was relayed
to the men via his wife, Winnie.
The couple met Saturday at the
Cape Town clinic where Mandela
is recuperating from tuberculosis.
"We entered the U.S. Consulate
not simply to secure our own free
dom, but to stir the conscience of
South Africa and the interna
tional community about the plight
of our fellow detainees," said Valli
Moosa.
An estimated 30,000 people

have been detained without charge
during the 28-month-old state of
emergency. About 1,000 are
believed in detention.
The three smiled broadly as
they embraced their families and
colleagues waiting for them in the
lobby of the building. Scores of
journalists and about 200 sup
porters also were present.
The activists gave clenched-fist
salutes to the cheering crowd,
mostly young blacks who chanted
"Amandla," the Zulu word for
"power."
Riot police, armed with
truncheons and shotguns, sought
to keep the crowd under control
and police camera crews
photographed the event.
"It's great to be out of here,"
said the third activist, Vusi
Khanyile.
Valli Moosa and Morobe are
senior leaders of the United
Democratic Front.
