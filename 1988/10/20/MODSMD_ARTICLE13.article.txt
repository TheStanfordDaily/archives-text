WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Pentagon yesterday suspended the
Sundstrand Corp. from doing
business with the government,
saying it wasn't satisfied with the
company's response to being
caught up in a huge defense fraud
case.
Sundstrand, which last week
agreed to pay $115 million in the
largest single fraud settlement in
history, has been barred indefi
nitely "from government contract
ing and government-approved
subcontracting," a Pentagon
statement said.
Defense officials has not been
convinced that "corrective actions

undertaken thus far have been ad

The contracting suspension ap
plies to the parent corporation as
well as six subsidiaries: Sund
strand Data Control Inc.; Falk
Corp., Sundstrand Heat Transfer
Inc.; Sundstrand Service Corp.;
Sullair Corp. and Signatron Inc.
The suspension was imposed by
the Defense Logistics Agency but
applies to all government agencies,
the Pentagon said. It does not af
fect existing contracts already
held by Sundstrand, which is
based in Rockford, 111.

mitted false claims to the Depart
ment of Defense and conspired to
defraud the federal government,"
the Pentagon said.
Sundstrand spokesman Claude
Vernam was not immediately
available for comment, said his
secretary, Karen Lowe.

Larry Wilson, a spokesman for
the Defense Logistics Agency, said
he could not estimate how long
the suspension might last nor
could he predict the immediate
financial impact on Sundstrand.
Sundstrand, a manufacturer of
electronic, mechanical and hy
draulic systems for aircraft,
agreed on Oct. 12 agreed to pay
$115 million to the government
and to plead guilty to four counts
of defrauding the Defense Depart
ment by overbilling on aircraft
parts.
At the same time, its Sund
strand Data Control subsidiary
settled a separate case by agreeing

to pay $13 million. That case in
volved charges the company had
used unallowable costs to inflate
its overhead rates.
The U.S. attorney in Chicago,
Anton Valukas, said a federal in
vestigation had determined that
besides overbilling for aircraft
parts, the company had been sub
mitting claims for such things as
babysitting expenses, country
clubs and servants for its execu
tives.
The company also was attempt
ing "to improve (its) ability to
market hardware to the Defense
Department by giving gratuities
to Defense Department personnel

and their spouses while conceal
ing (their) identity," the govern
ment said.
Sundstrand employees gave an
estimated $100,000 worth of liq
uor, meals, motel rooms, golf out
ings and tickets to the theater,
hockey, football and baseball
games, the government said. They
then submitted expense reports
identifying the Defense Depart
ment workers they entertained
only as a "customer" or "govern
ment employee," the complaint
said.
The Defense Department ac
counts for 42 percent of Sund
strand's $1.4 billion in annual
sales.
