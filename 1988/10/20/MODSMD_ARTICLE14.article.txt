U.S. physicists win Nobel Prize
STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) - Three Amer
icans won the Nobel Prize in physics yesterday
for their work with subatomic particles, and three
West Germans shared the chemistry prize for
unraveling a mystery of photosynthesis.
Americans Leon Lederman, Melvin Schwartz
and Jack Steinberger shared the physics prize
for capturing neutrinos in a high energy beam
to probe the stucture of atomic particles.
Chemists Johann Deisenhofer, Robert Huber
and Hartmut Michel of West Germany were
honored for discoveries that may be critical in
harnessing the sun's energy. They were rewarded
for work completed only three years ago, indi
cating the importance attached to their
breakthrough by the awarding committee of the
Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
Many recipients wait decades for recognition.
Committee chairman Bo Malmstrom said their
work was an essential step toward artificial
photosynthesis, which scientists hope will provide
the key to converting the sun's energy to man's
needs.
"The only way in the long run to solve the
energy problem of the world is to utilize solar
energy," Malmstrom said.
Although it had no immediate practical appli

cation, the academy said the research had im
portance beyond the study of photosynthesis, the
process of converting sunlight into energy.
It said the research could be used in under
standing central biological functions, including
the transport of chemical substances between
cells, hormone action and nerve impulses.
Court upholds Marcos finding
NEW YORK (AP) — A federal appeals court
yesterday upheld a previously undisclosed civil
contempt finding against former Philippine Pres
ident Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, Imelda.
The ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals upheld a civil contempt of court finding
against the Marcoses last August for not com
plying with grand jury subpoenas, subjecting
them to possible arrest.
A federal prosecutor declined to say what the
consequences of the appeals court's decision
might be. Generally, persons found in civil con
tempt can be jailed until they comply with the
court's directive during the life of the grand jury,
which is usually about 18 months.
A federal grand jury in Manhattan has been
investigating since June 1986 whether the Mar
coses have violated federal racketeering laws, ac
cording to the appeals court's opinion.
