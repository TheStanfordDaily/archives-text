## This is a big deal 
### 
The community should
understand that the
Ujamaa fliers are racist

PAY ATTENTION. This is im
portant.
The two fliers posted in
Ujamaa House are racially offen
sive. They painfully illustrate that
racism still exists in the Stanford
community.
Basic principles of humanity,
compassion and respect demand
that all members of the community
grapple with the events of this past
week and seek to truly understand
why the fliers are racist.
All members of the community
should also seek to understand why
the residents of Ujamaa, members
of the black community, the ad
ministration and many concerned
students are taking these events so
seriously.
During a dorm discussion a few
weeks ago among Lagunita resi
dents, a debate arose over whether
Beethoven had any African ances
tors. Two days later, a caricature
of Beethoven portrayed as a black
man was posted on the door of an
Ujamaa resident, who was involved
in the discussion.
This action shocked many people
and set off a chain of events which
has forced members of the Stan
ford community to re-examine race
relations here.
The incidents are important not

only in and of themselves, but be
cause they are part of a series of
events that have taken place here
at Stanford and around the nation.
Despite the concentrated efforts
of many members of the commu
nity to thwart racism and establish
Stanford as a model of diversity,
we have not progressed beyond the
institutionalized racism that has
plagued the United States since
the beginning of its history.
Black people are not now — and
never have been — equal in the
United States. This legacy contin
ues to define the everyday exper
ience of African-American people
today. Even at Stanford.
This is why the question of Bee
thoven's ancestry has significance.
And this is why the flier is so
offensive.
Whether Beethoven really does
have any African ancestors is al
most irrelevant. What is important
is that these two students could
not accept the idea that Beethoven
might have any African ancestors.
Why did they care that much,
go that far, to show how ridiculous
it would be to them for Beethoven
to be of black ancestry? Their ac
tions are clear signs that there is
something fundamentally wrong
with how they think about black
people.
Regardless of the initial intent
of the two students, the message
the flier sent was disrespectful, of
fensive and uncivilized.
All students should take a stand
against this kind of behavior and
work to actively combat racism at
Stanford.
