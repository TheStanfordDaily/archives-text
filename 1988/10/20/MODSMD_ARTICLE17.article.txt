## Vigil was not clear-cut enough to warrant charges 
### 
The fundamental stand
ard clearly assumes that viola
tions will result in suspensions
or expulsions from the University. Our
judicial case law supports this assump
tion: suspensions are common penalties
for Fundamental Standard violations.
Even where lighter penalties are
imposed, the argument begins with a
presumed suspension and presents
reasons to modify that penalty. Thus
one test to use in evaluating a poten
tial Fundamental Standard violation is
whether the behavior in question
warrants suspensions or expulsion from
the University. Physical assault, driving
drunk on campus and theft are exam
ples of behaviors that usually result in
suspensions. Was the behavior of the
seven students (involved in last spring's
Otero vigil) in that category? I'm not
sure.
Another question that I and others
pondered over the summer was: What
should the University seek to achieve
in responding to the Otero incident?
Punishment for the seven students?
Education? Of whom?

Here two points emerged over time:
First, the students felt and responded
to many repercussions from their
behavior. Their plan in staging the
vigil was, I believe, both innocent and
ignorant; it failed in all respects,
leaving them neither so innocent nor
so ignorant. They did a commendable
job of trying to make amends for their
actions through public apologies, ap
pearances at Otero, at the BCSC and
at the BSU march to the Quad and
through innumerable discussions with
administrators, fraternity brothers, the
press and other students. While one
cannot measure embarrassment or
contrition, those two qualities were
clearly present — and appropriately so
— in the aftermath of the vigil.
The second point: If the problem is
ignorance rather than malice, it seems
reasonable to assume that these seven
men do not have a campus monopoly
on ignorance. We should, therefore,
craft a response to their behavior that
extends beyond them to include the
confidential nature of our judicial
process (unless the accused student

chooses a public hearing), it is not a
good vehicle for developing and
presenting an educational agenda to a
large population.
Last spring, however, Joe Pisano,
Fraternal Affairs Advisor, specified a
plan to involve members of the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity in a variety of
educational programs in residential
fraternities and elsewhere during the
1988-89 academic year. (One program
has already been scheduled.) Also, the
ASSU and COP have announced as a
"central priority" their commitment to
"educate students about racism;" their
first initiative in this area was The
Fire Within program during new stu
dent orientation.
The summer discussions also atten
ded to arguments deriving from free
speech protections, the right to protest
and other First Amendment concerns.
In an academy that protects academic
freedom with professorial tenure, you
can understand that these were
weighty issues. That same academy,
however, also cherishes other values
that are central to a university commu-

nity, especially a respect for others and
a concomitant sensitivity to their
opinions, beliefs and backgrounds. The
point, though, is that reasonable people
can see important values to be in
conflict in the Otero incident.
If there are strong arguments both
for and against the option of charging
these students with Fundamental
Standard violations, then we have, I
believe, a circumstance that is best
handled outside of the judicial arena.
The judicial process deals poorly with
ambiguity and choices. It responds well
to questions of evidence, proof, guilt,
innocence and appropriate penalties.
Where there is dispute, however, and
both sides have some amount of merit,
then I don't think we would get
decisive clarity from the outcome of a
University judicial process. Indeed, a
"not guilty" verdict would be likely.
Those are the primary considerations
that led me to decide against Funda
mental Standard charges in this case.
