# Issues raised by 'Coverup' should be addressed by Bush
## 
### 
The recently released documentary,
"Coverup," raises issues of tremendous
importance and timeliness. It presents
substantial evidence that the Reagan
Administration, and George Bush in
particular, negotiated with Iran to
delay the release of American hostages
during the 1980 presidential campaign.
Some of the other evidence presented
in the documentary directly links

George Bush and his advisors to drug
smuggling as a method for financing
the Contras, a terrorist bombing at La
Penca, Nicaragua in which numerous
journalists including an American were
killed, and plans for the widescale
suspension of civil liberties within the
United States itself. i
Because these allegations are so ex
plosive it is tempting to dismiss them
as incredible. Prior to the exposure of
the Iran/Contra arms deal, it was un
thinkable that Ronald Reagan would
have been negotiating with Iran, but
this was indeed the case. These allega
tions just increase the extent of that
operation and explain why the agenda
of those investigations was so tightly

controlled.
During Watergate, a more activist
press could have exposed the scandal
before Nixon was re-elected and spared
the country two years of trauma and
paralysis. The same situation exists
now. Compared to these allegations,
Watergate was merely a prank. These
are allegations of treason beyond any
thing in our history. They are too ex
plosive to ignore.
George Bush needs to respond to
specific evidence such as his flight to
Paris to meet with Mohammed Be
heshti, Rafsanjani, Manucher Ghor
banifar and Albert Hakim during a gap
in his campaign activities in October

1980. If he wishes to be the next pres
ident, he should feel obligated to put
the allegations to rest.
Personally, I have always questioned
his credibility. From his days in the
CIA to his testimony during the
Iran/Contra investigations, he has
never earned my trust. His latest claim
to be an environmentalist despite a
very consistent and public record of
opposition to environmental protection
is just another example of why his
record and these allegations need to be
fully scrutinized.
