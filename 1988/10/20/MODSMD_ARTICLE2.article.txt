### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
Beginning a second day of free-swinging
attacks on the campaign tactics of Vice
President George Bush, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Tex., yesterday charged that Republicans
have run their presidential campaign at
the level of "a mud-wrestling festival out
at the Cow Palace."

In an 8:30 a.m. speech to a supportive
crowd of about 500 students packed into
Kresge Auditorium, the Democratic vice
presidential candidate said the Republicans
have "viciously slandered" the record of
his running mate, Gov. Michael Dukakis.

"In a moment of panic last summer, they
spent millions to wreck the image of a
decent man ... while they sugar-coated the
record of their own nominee," Bentsen said.
"We're going to raise the level of debate
in this campaign," he said. "We demand
that (the Bush camp) honor the best in
stincts of America by putting truth on the
line."
The Texas Democrat first displayed his
stepped-up aggressiveness Tuesday in a
similar speech at UCLA and at several
campaign stops throughout California.
Bentsen vowed yesterday that the pres
idential campaign is not over, despite polls
that show Dukakis and Bentsen signifi
cantly behind Bush and Sen. Dan Quayle,
R-Ind.
"They're trying to dig us a grave and
tell us to jump in," Bentsen said, referring
to the Republican Party and the media.

"Let's tell them to go jump in the
lake," Bentsen retorted, emphasiz
ing that there is "enough time
left to turn around the numbers."
"I don't care what the polls
have to say as long as I have a
room full of college students out
to hear Lloyd Bentsen at eight in
the morning, and some of them
camped out all night," he said.
After his 25-minute talk, which
was scheduled to begin at 8:00
a.m., Bentsen briefly toured the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter. He left campus at 9:45 a.m.
Joining Bentsen at SLAC were
former space shuttle astronaut
Sally Ride, who has been working
at the Center for International Se
curity and Arms Control on
campus, and Sens. Bennett
Johnston, D-La., and Barbara
Mikulski, D-Md., who were here
for a noontime forum on public
service.
Bentsen, whose son Lloyd
Bentsen 111 graduated from Stan
ford Business School in 1968,
made several references to the
University. "Elections are about
the future, and so is Stanford,"
Bentsen said.
One such reference was in
cluded in a reminder that yester
day was the first anniversary of
Black Monday, the worst stock
market drop in history. "That's
easy to remember when you're
standing in the shadow of Hoover
Tower," Bentsen quipped, putting
blame for the crash with conser
vatives like those at the think

The crowd's loudest cheers
came near the end of the speech
when Bentsen mentioned educa
tional opportunity and college
loans.
"We disagree with the Republi
cans that a college education is a
privilege; we believe it's a right
and that every qualified student
should have a chance to go to
college regardless of family
finances," he said. Departing mo
mentarily from his script, Bentsen
proudly added that he was the
first in his family to graduate
from college.
Amid numerous campaign pro
motions and editorial comments
about the Republican ticket, most
of which were well-received by the
predominately student audience,
Bentsen stressed the importance
of "Technology, Education and the
Future," his speech topic.
Although the United States has
the technology and capability to
create innovative products,
Bentsen argued, "the nations of
Europe and the Pacific Rim are
beating us to market with the
products of the future."
America should join Stanford
students, Bentsen said, in "testing
the limits of new frontiers in sci
ence, the arts, humanities and ed
ucation."
Bentsen's speech was inter
spersed with a number of one
liners that gained overwhelming
crowd approval. Even in the be
ginning, Bentsen asked the audi
ence to "make an objective deci
sion" in his sons' debate whether
Harvard or Stanford is superior,
since one son went to each school.
Stanford won.

presidential candidate said the Republicans
have "viciously slandered" the record of
his running mate, Gov. Michael Dukakis.

"In a moment of panic last summer, they
spent millions to wreck the image of a
decent man ... while they sugar-coated the
record of their own nominee," Bentsen said.
"We're going to raise the level of debate
in this campaign," he said. "We demand
that (the Bush camp) honor the best in
stincts of America by putting truth on the
line."
The Texas Democrat first displayed his
stepped-up aggressiveness Tuesday in a
similar speech at UCLA and at several
campaign stops throughout California.
Bentsen vowed yesterday that the pres
idential campaign is not over, despite polls
that show Dukakis and Bentsen signifi
cantly behind Bush and Sen. Dan Quayle,
R-Ind.
"They're trying to dig us a grave and
tell us to jump in," Bentsen said, referring
to the Republican Party and the media.

"Let's tell them to go jump in the
lake," Bentsen retorted, emphasiz
ing that there is "enough time
left to turn around the numbers."
"I don't care what the polls
have to say as long as I have a
room full of college students out
to hear Lloyd Bentsen at eight in
the morning, and some of them
camped out all night," he said.
After his 25-minute talk, which
was scheduled to begin at 8:00
a.m., Bentsen briefly toured the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter. He left campus at 9:45 a.m.
Joining Bentsen at SLAC were
former space shuttle astronaut
Sally Ride, who has been working
at the Center for International Se
curity and Arms Control on
campus, and Sens. Bennett
Johnston, D-La., and Barbara
Mikulski, D-Md., who were here
for a noontime forum on public
service.
Bentsen, whose son Lloyd
Bentsen 111 graduated from Stan
ford Business School in 1968,
made several references to the
University. "Elections are about
the future, and so is Stanford,"
Bentsen said.
One such reference was in
cluded in a reminder that yester
day was the first anniversary of
Black Monday, the worst stock
market drop in history. "That's
easy to remember when you're
standing in the shadow of Hoover
Tower," Bentsen quipped, putting
blame for the crash with conser
vatives like those at the think

The crowd's loudest cheers
came near the end of the speech
when Bentsen mentioned educa
tional opportunity and college
loans.
"We disagree with the Republi
cans that a college education is a
privilege; we believe it's a right
and that every qualified student
should have a chance to go to
college regardless of family
finances," he said. Departing mo
mentarily from his script, Bentsen
proudly added that he was the
first in his family to graduate
from college.
Amid numerous campaign pro
motions and editorial comments
about the Republican ticket, most
of which were well-received by the
predominately student audience,
Bentsen stressed the importance
of "Technology, Education and the
Future," his speech topic.
Although the United States has
the technology and capability to
create innovative products,
Bentsen argued, "the nations of
Europe and the Pacific Rim are
beating us to market with the
products of the future."
America should join Stanford
students, Bentsen said, in "testing
the limits of new frontiers in sci
ence, the arts, humanities and ed
ucation."
Bentsen's speech was inter
spersed with a number of one
liners that gained overwhelming
crowd approval. Even in the be
ginning, Bentsen asked the audi
ence to "make an objective deci
sion" in his sons' debate whether
Harvard or Stanford is superior,
since one son went to each school.
Stanford won.
