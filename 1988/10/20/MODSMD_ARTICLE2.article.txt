## Democratic candidate speaks at Kresge 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
Beginning a second day of free-swinging
attacks on the campaign tactics of Vice
President George Bush, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Tex., yesterday charged that Republicans
have run their presidential campaign at
the level of "a mud-wrestling festival out
at the Cow Palace."

In an 8:30 a.m. speech to a supportive
crowd of about 500 students packed into
Kresge Auditorium, the Democratic vice
presidential candidate said the Republicans
have "viciously slandered" the record of
his running mate, Gov. Michael Dukakis.

"In a moment of panic last summer, they
spent millions to wreck the image of a
decent man ... while they sugar-coated the
record of their own nominee," Bentsen said.
"We're going to raise the level of debate
in this campaign," he said. "We demand
that (the Bush camp) honor the best in
stincts of America by putting truth on the
line."
The Texas Democrat first displayed his
stepped-up aggressiveness Tuesday in a
similar speech at UCLA and at several
campaign stops throughout California.
Bentsen vowed yesterday that the pres
idential campaign is not over, despite polls
that show Dukakis and Bentsen signifi
cantly behind Bush and Sen. Dan Quayle,
R-Ind.
"They're trying to dig us a grave and
tell us to jump in," Bentsen said, referring
to the Republican Party and the media.
