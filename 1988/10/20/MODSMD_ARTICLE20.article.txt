## Ignorance is no excuse 
### 
MONDAY'S DAILY confirmed
something we can no longer
deny: Racism does exist, not just
in an institutional manner but in its
most blatant form, at Stanford Univer
sity.
When I first glanced at the headlines,
"Two racial incidents strike Ujamaa
House" and "Participants in Otero vigil
not charged with misconduct," I was
shocked. While reading the articles I be
came angry. Upon further reflection of
the content of the articles, and their im
plications, I grew upset and disturbed.
While attending a meeting at Ujamaa
with President Kennedy and other mem
bers of the administration I felt emotion
ally and physically disgusted. Now, sitting
in front of the computer writing this
column, I am exhausted and confused.
As a white person, it is difficult for
me to admit that racism exists. In doing
so, I divide our society into the victims
of racism and the proponents of racism,
and I must place myself, ashamed as I
am, into the latter category. I can no
longer place all the blame on my white
ancestors for the systematic oppression
of minorities they instituted in American
society, while denying all personal respon
sibility for the racism that exists today.
Just as people born black must live
with prejudices, inequality and a constant
need to justify their existence, so must
I, being born white, live with the knowl
edge that I am the reason why blacks
face prejudices, inequality and a constant
need to justify their existence. I can never
be the martyr; I will always be the ex
ecutioner.

Accepting this point of view raises some
defensiveness in me about being white.
I fear that whatever I do, or whatever I
say, I will always be the "bad guy," the
"oppressor," the "racist," who can never
understand the minority perspective.
This defensiveness may lead me to reject
Residential Education programming on
racism, to vote against a fee assessment
for the Black Student Union, or to "turn
off" all the discussions of multicul
turalism and pluralism, for fear that any
pro-minority program will lead to anti
white sentiments.
Within this "white defensiveness" is
where the danger lies, because it leads
many white students to ignore and deny
issues of racism. Today's incidents make
it clear, though, that we can ignore racism
no longer.
This white "defensiveness" is also what
I think leads University officials to not
respond to racial incidents as well as the
students would like them to.
Up to this point, the University's theme
has been education as the tool needed to
eradicate racism. We have been led to
believe that social ignorance had
generated our social problems. I agree
that social ignorance abounds, but I'm
tired of racist actions being called stupid
or unintelligent or the result of ignorance.
I call them mean and inhumane and the
result of an evil that is inherent in our
society.
After hearing many students speak at
Ujamaa tonight, I realized that many
others feel that a certain evil exists in
our society, and that we must admit to
this evil if we are to ever change that

society. In excusing, as simply ignorant,
the behavior of the participants in last
spring's Otero vigil, we ended up solving
nothing. These students were not charged
with violating the Fundamental Stand
ard. They received only, in essence, a
"slap on the hand;" and the incident did
not deter other incidents from occuring,
as illustrated by this past weekend.
Well, a "slap on the hand" isn't going
to solve the problem of racism; and nei
ther will, I'm afraid, other "educational"
measures, such as the University Com
mittee on Minority Issues report, or an
Ethnic Studies requirement, or increased
Residential Education programming.
Racism is something we are taught
before we come to Stanford. Some little
kids are taught that it's okay to scribble
"nigger" in the bathroom stall, and others
are taught that it's not. This is where
the inherent evil of our society lies.
So, can we change this? I don't really
know. But we can take strong actions
against those people who express their
racism and against those institutional
seeds that sow it. For as a very dear
friend of mine once told me: "If you are
not part of the solution, you are part of
the problem."
