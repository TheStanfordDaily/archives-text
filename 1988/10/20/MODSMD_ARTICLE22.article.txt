## Ujamaa Ujamaa incidents are signs of deeper problems in the community 
### 
Oftentimes, one would like to believe
that institutions of higher learning are
immune to overt acts of racism. One
would like to believe that ignorance
really is the key to racism, and educa
tion is the solution. Repeatedly, how
ever, black students at Stanford see
that is not the case.
I have been at Stanford for four
years, and I have only seen the situa
tion become worse. I never believed
that events that transpired in Ujamaa
on Friday could actually happen. I
have chosen to omit the details, for
they will undoubtedly be given in
several forms, but the products of
these events are indisputable and in
tolerable; a black fraternity poster ad
vertising a party with the word "NIG
GERS" boldly written across it, a dorm

in shock, and racial tension among the
entire student body.
When I saw the poster for the first
time, my mind immediately flashed
back to the first time I had encoun
tered that word. I was six years old
and it was my first day of school. My
mother had bought me a new lunch
box, which I proudly carried to school.
When I arrived in class, we were told
to place our lunches in a common
area.
I made many friends that morning,
but unfortunately, at least one enemy.
When I went to pick up my lunch box,
someone had placed masking tape with
that derogatory word written on it
across my name. During my years of
growing up in North Carolina, I have
experienced many more painful inci-

dents relating to the color of my skin
or the texture of my hair. In the small
Southern town where I grew up, rac
ism went hand in hand with ignorance.
But I, as I am sure most other black
people that attend this University, ex
pect and demand more.
I am certain that many black people
had similar flashbacks when they saw
the poster. Some reacted with anger
and frustration, and I have no way of
conveying in such a short letter the
true pain which they felt. I can, how
ever, describe the disappointment and
bitter feeling that has been left in my
heart from this incident.
Stanford was supposed to be a haven
from the racial unrest endured in
North Carolina. While there was no
unrealistic expectation of the absence

of racial problems, I did believe every
one would have a genuine desire to
learn about other cultures, heritages
and peoples. I did believe that overt,
but indeed cowardly demonstrations of
racism were things I had left behind.
The poster reminded me that my
dreams had long since been shattered,
and bigotry was alive and well at Stan
ford University.
Race relations are a problem at this
institution, contrary to popular opin
ion. I, as a representative of my frater
nity, Kappa Alpha Psi, beseech all of
you to recognize the problem as a
issue. The incident is only the
tip of an iceberg which contains a
much larger problem, but I encourage
you to recognize its significance, and
act accordingly.

An investigatory committee must be
formed to uncover the criminals
against human rights, and recommend
a suitable punishment. A "slap on the
hand" is not appropriate as exemplified
by the "Phi Delt Night Vigil" and the
more recent Beethoven culprits.
Something must be done to correct
the downward spiral of race relations
in this community; although the pun
ishment may be harsh, the University
must prove that such behavior is en
tirely intolerable. To ignore the prob
lem, downplay its significance, or not
deal with those responsible in a severe
fashion, is to tolerate its existence and
even advocate the display of hatred
through racial slurs.
