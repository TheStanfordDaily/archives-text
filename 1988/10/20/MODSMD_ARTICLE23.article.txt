# Kennedy and others dodged issues
## 
### 
As an incoming freshman, I heard a
great deal about diversity at Stanford,
mainly through University publications
and University speakers. Over the
summer, I received literature such as
Black at Stanford which told me that
diversity was greatly stressed here at
Stanford. All during Orientation, the
message was that diversity was
promoted at Stanford. Even President
Kennedy said "Bigotry is out!"
Coming from a large city like Los
Angeles, I was a bit skeptical in ac
cepting all of this talk about diversity,
but as Orientation continued, I began
to believe it. Everything at Stanford
seemed to be going just fine, until the
incident at Ujamaa House.
Now that bigotry has become appar
ent at Stanford, what am I to do? The
University speakers never dealt with

the issue of how to handle the bigotry
if it ever did occur here, at Stanford.
They only told me of how they would
promote racial diversity. They seemed
to ignore the fact that bigotry is alive
and well in the United States.
After going to the Black Student
Union meeting on Monday, which was '
attended by President Kennedy and
other administrators, I don't feel that
any of my questions have been an
swered. It appears to me that they
only avoided the issues, especially the
larger issue of how they would educate
students about other races so that
these incidents would not happen, and
so that the races will begin to respect
one another as human beings instead
of just accepting someone as less than
human.
