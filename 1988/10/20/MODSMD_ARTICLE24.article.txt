# Racism is not unique to Stanford
## 
### 
Like many members of the Stanford
community, I was greatly saddened by
the recent, graphic glimpses of racism
discovered at Ujamaa. I cannot, how
ever, say that I am surprised. I've
been living in, or closely connected to,
Stanford since 1981. No longer do I
harbor any illusions about the lack of
representation and expression on our
campus of any particular viewpoint.
I've been to the "real world" (if
there is such a place) and back and
seen what we would call abuses of
common human rights existing as an
accepted part of an everyday life.
Unfortunately, Mr. Sparks ("Incident
in Ujamaa makes one resident feel
badly betrayed"), it is not appalling
that this could happen on the Stanford
campus nor is it any more atrocious
for having happened in Ujamaa. It
happens every day in thousands of
casual conversations and millions of
minds; against women, blacks,
chicanos, gay men and women and
many, many other groups. All over
campus and all over the world.
The issue of racism has been
brought to the forefront of Stanford's
attention many times in the past. Yet
this is not something that can be dealt
with one year and not the next. Rac
ism is not a problem for us to solve.

It's an issue we must learn to live
with. Even if we could eradicate it at
Stanford and do not have to think
about it while we're here, we'd still
have to face it in millions of other
places around the world.
I would never suggest that this
means that we should simply accept
the situation as inevitable, but neither
can I suggest a solution. Life is simply
too complex for that.
Yet Mr. Sparks and others like him
who are surprised, shocked and dis
mayed at the disgusting behavior of
those two young men might do well to
ask themselves a few questions. Why
haven't they noticed these attitudes
before now?
While I might agree that a suspen
sion is the smallest price those two
young men should have to pay, what
good would it do in the long run?
Even if you succeed in eliminating
such overt acts of bigotry, what new
forms will it take? How can you recog
nize those new forms? And how can
you work to eliminate them?
Like the air, it is everywhere, all
over the world. Sometimes we can see
it, but most often we can't. Can you
deal with what you cannot see?
