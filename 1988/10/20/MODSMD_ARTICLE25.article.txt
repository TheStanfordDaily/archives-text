# Ujamaa should stay open for all
## 
### 
The recent occurences at Ujamaa are
inexcusable and should be dealt with
accordingly, but the proposal by Hilary
Skillings in her letter (The Daily, Oct.
17, p. 4) is ridiculous and another
matter completely. Skillings argued
that Ujamaa should be allowed to
choose its members. I disagree.
The concept of theme houses at
Stanford is to allow interested students
to learn more about a specific culture
by being immersed in it. This is an
educational opportunity supported by
the University that should be open to
all students, not just those who have
the good fortune of being black or
Asian or Chicano-Latino.
By choosing its members to be all
black, Ujamaa would not be fostering
an awareness of African-American and
other black cultures, but hiding it;
hiding it not only from other eth-

nicities on campus, but also from the
blacks who choose to live in other
housing. This is unfair.
Every other theme house on campus,
such as Lathrop and Casa Zapata, "al
lows" people of any descent to live in
their houses and this works out well.
If Ujamaa elects to allow only blacks
to live there, then the trend will con
tinue with Okada House, allowing only
those of Asian descent "in" to the
house, Slavianskii Dom those with a
Soviet history, and Lathrop only Na
tive Americans. Does this make sense?
There is a place at Stanford for all
black groups, for example the Black
Greek Letter System and the Black
Student Union. But Ujamaa is not the
place for such a group, and accepting
only blacks would be racism.
