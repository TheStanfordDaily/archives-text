# Hillel sympathizes with blacks
## 
### 
The residents of Ujamaa House,
members of the Black Student Union
and the entire Stanford community
suffered a great injustice with the
racist incidents of this past weekend
and the preceding weeks' related
events.
Racial slurs have absolutely no place
on this campus or in this society, and
we at Hillel abhor the fact that such
incidents occur at Stanford.
We hope that the University's re
sponse is swift, and that it sets a pre
cedent for eradicating racial problems
of this type that could occur in the
future.
Ignorance cannot stand as an excuse
for any manifestation of racism. We
concur with Mary Dillard, Chair of the
Black Student Union, when she says
that it is not the job of the BSU to
educate Stanford's white population
but to care for the black students on
campus.
Ignorance of the racial undertones of
various symbols and words should not
put an onus on campus blacks or on
the BSU to "educate it away."
Stanford University must work
towards the eradication of all ignor
ance, and denunciations of racism must
emanate not only from minority stu-

dents but from all members of the
university community.
At Stanford, a school priding itself
on the diversity of its student body, we
should no longer strive simply to
tolerate one another's differences. In
stead, we should celebrate those differ
ences and learn a more important
virtue: RESPECT!
We hope never again to witness a
similarly outrageous incident. As a
historically persecuted minority, we
identify with the residents of Ujamaa
and members of the BSU who have
suffered and continue to suffer the
effects of prejudice.
We would like to offer our support
in this time of pain, and we encourage
all efforts to rid Stanford of the ignor
ance and bigotry which plague not only
Stanford University but our entire
society.
