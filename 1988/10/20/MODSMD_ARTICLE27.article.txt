# Stanford should not lose opportunity to improve race relations
## 
### 
Once again, it looks as though the
Stanford community is going to miss a
golden opportunity to improve, rather
than intensify, race relations on
campus.
In light of the recent goings-on at
Ujamaa, we must ask ourselves: "What
is the best course of action to insure
that such insensitive acts occur less
frequently until they've been completely
removed from our environment?"
Reactions to such acts seem to gen

erally fall into one of two categories:
the "immediate gratification" response,
in which the evils of the act are
focused on exclusively, resulting in a
situation where those hurt are more
concerned with the punishment of the
perpetrators than they are with creat
ing an environment where these events
occur less frequently; or the "what's
best-in-the-long-run" response, where
those involved stress the good that can
come out of the situation, resolving
themselves to fostering an attitude

which simply wipes out such transgres
sions.
The first path is ruled by emotions,
the second by reason. I believe that at
Stanford, where people are undoubt
edly more open to reasonable discus
sion than to emotional finger-pointing,
the second path will ALWAYS prove
more effective (contributing to an at
mosphere where bigotry is OUT!).
Just as ignorance is no excuse for an
insensitive act, I don't believe frustra
tion is an excuse for an ineffective

reaction.
It is up to all members of the Stan
ford community to not only read about
these incidents in The Daily, but to
genuinely consider the implicatons, and
also to become more aware of their
own actions.
As a white member of the Stanford
student body, it infuriates me to see
members of "my race" inflict so much
pain upon people of another race. As a
person dedicated to the abolition of all
forms of bigotry, it hurts me to see

the confrontational attitude adopted by
those most affected by these acts.
Stanford has the potential to be a
very unique community. We have the
opportunity to carry non-violence one
step further to cooperation. Since we
all have a stake in creating a new atti
tude, we all must contribute to its
actualization by acting sensitively and
rationally.
