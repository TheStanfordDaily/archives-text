## Computer viruses imperil the health of American industry 
### Jock Friedly Staff writer 
A computer panic sweeping the country in
recent months hit the Stanford campus last
week, and students and administrators alike
are worried.
Computer viruses, small programs that act
much like human viruses, have infected many
thousands of computers around the country,
in companies, laboratories, universities and
homes.
The viruses that have been discovered vary
in design and consequence, but according to
one lecturer in computer science, Steve Fisher,
"a virus can do almost anything." And he
adds, viruses potentially pose a "very serious"
problem to the nation.
"To imagine that there's some sanctity to
the distribution of software is . .. ridiculous,"
said Chuck Cole, deputy computer security
manager of nearby Lawrence Livermore Na
tional Laboratory
Dozens of viruses have been made, some
harmless such as the strain contaminating
computers around the Stanford campus.
Others can sit like time bombs in the com
puter, waiting for the right moment to erase
important files.
The virus that infiltrated Stanford was first
found last week in the Tresidder Union Mac
intosh II cluster, which is used mostly by
students in the lower division computer sci
ence classes.
The virus, named nVIR, has three known
strains. One of these randomly deletes files

from infected disks. The particular strain
found in over a dozen computers at Tresidder,
however, is not thought to be harmful, ac
cording to campus computer specialist Lance
Nakata.
Nakata, who discovered the problem last
week after he received a tip via electronic
mail, detroyed nVIR by using an anti-virus
program called a "vaccine," an analogue to
protection against human viruses.
Before he cured Tresidder of the virus, it
had already infected an untold number of
students' disks and had subsequently spread
through some of Meyer's new Macintosh II
computers. An unsuspecting student probably
carried a contaminated disk from Tresidder
to Meyer, extending the contagion, Nakata

said.
Stanford is not the only university feeling
the wrath of viruses. George Washington Uni
versity was hit by an epidemic of the IBM
virus called "Brain."
According to a computer specialist at George
Washington University, the particular Brain
strain that hit the campus was not written
to cause harm. Nonetheless, any virus poses
danger by its very nature as a contagious
disease, he addei.
Self-replication is the primary function of
any virus, and translated into effect, this
means a virus can write over some pre-existing
data in order to make room for itself. Often
the virus erases crucial information, regard
less of its benign intentions.
The Brain virus spread like wildfire, infect
ing an estimated 100,000 disks across the
country, according to Time magazine.
The Brain virus was created by two Pakis
tani brothers who own a computer software
business that sells pirated software. Ironically,
they decided to to punish their own customers
— many of whom were Americans — for
buying illegal software they themselves sold.
In an eerie reminder of the dangers of
viruses, they had hidden the words "WEL
COME TO THE DUNGEON" in the code of
the virus. The address and names of the au
thors also appear in the message so that people
who have uncovered the infectious program
can send away for the antidote.
Although the particular nVIR strain that

struck Stanford was relatively in
nocuous by computer virus stand
ards, the incident draws attention
to a national crisis in the world
of computers. And since comput
ers now occupy the heart of Amer
ican industry, the stakes in this
crisis are high.
To say the least, people are
worried. The ease with which
computers can be infiltrated by
these disastrous lines of code is
unnerving. And although an
tidotes can be developed for each
virus created, there is no guaran
tee the antidote can be created in
time to halt the virus before it
destrovs huee amounts of data.
In May of this year, on Friday
the 13th, the country of Israel
was to celebrate its 40th anniver

sary. As the country celebrated,
a nation-wide computer program
was designed by an unknown
"hacker" to erase itself simulta
neously.
In a lucky break, computer
users at Jerusalem's Hebrew Uni
versity noticed the slow operation
of their computers and discovered
the system was clogged with a
computer virus mercilessly
replicating.
An antidote was written and no
data was lost. Nevertheless, the
implications of the event are
frightening. A similar virus in the
United States, permeating indus
try and government computers,
could paralyze the country.
The irony is that the trend in
computing, the linking of vast
numbers of computers in net
works, is making computers ever
more vulnerable to computer
"hackers" who are often respon
sible for creating and spreading

viruses.
Each new link in the system
adds another target for an invader
such as a virus. And each new
link adds one more hole for med
dlers to tamper with the entire
network.
"On a large scale, the critical
question is how hard a virus is
to propagate," said Jonathon
Shapiro, a computer enthusiast
who works as technical staff at
AT&T's Bell Laboratories. There
are a certain number of computer
links, "below which it is hard for
a virus to propagate, above which
it is very easy," he said.
Shapiro is all too aware of the
vulnerability of large networks.
He said the phone network is the
most susceptible of all. The vul
nerability of the phone system was
evidenced in the early 1970s with
the advent of the "blue box," a
device that generates tones to fool
the phone company that money

has been entered into the phone.
It is through giant computer
networks that these viruses breed
most abundantly. At Stanford,
"clusters" of computers are linked
to a common file server that stu
dents can access to load programs
into the computer.
Fisher called these clusters
"breeding grounds for viruses."
Vaccines are now protecting
Stanford computers against the
nVIR virus, but the clusters are
vulnerable to other viruses not
stopped by this particular an
tidote.
Viruses have sprung up all over
the world, raising critical ques
tions about the severity of the
problem. The possibility that
viruses could invade computers
used for a country's banking in
dustry or for national security
frightens many.
"I would say it is unbelievably
unlikely that (viruses could infect)

national security computers," said
Fisher.
For very important security
matters, computers are only
accessed by a few users and they
are not allowed to bring commer
cial software from outside sources
onto the computers, Fisher said.
In this way, only a disgruntled
employee would be able to in
filtrate the system.
Some centers responsible for
national security, however, are
susceptible to virus attack. The
problem of computer security
hangs over Lawrence Livermore
Laboratory, where scientists
create technology for nuclear
weapons and extensively research
the Strategic Defense Initiative.
"We have had two instances
right here of imported viruses,"
said Livermore's Cole. The out
breaks were limited to erasing
files from some of the disks and
"were hand-carried to the corn

puters," Cole said.
Already, 48 states around the
country have passed legislation
concerning computer viruses. On
the first of the year, California
enacted legislation stating that
anyone who "knowingly accesses
and without permission adds, al
ters, damages, or destroys any
data, computer software, or com
puter programs" in computers
and networks is guilty of an of
fense.
The harsh penalties include be
fines as high as $10,000, loss of
computer equipment and three
years in prison.
As awareness grows in the com
puter profession, the problem of
viruses is not going away. Liver
more's Cole only predicts that it
will get worse in the short-run,
"spiralling" in an ever-increasing
battle between virus engineers
and antidote makers.

thousands of computers around the country,
in companies, laboratories, universities and
homes.
The viruses that have been discovered vary
in design and consequence, but according to
one lecturer in computer science, Steve Fisher,
"a virus can do almost anything." And he
adds, viruses potentially pose a "very serious"
problem to the nation.
"To imagine that there's some sanctity to
the distribution of software is . .. ridiculous,"
said Chuck Cole, deputy computer security
manager of nearby Lawrence Livermore Na
tional Laboratory
Dozens of viruses have been made, some
harmless such as the strain contaminating
computers around the Stanford campus.
Others can sit like time bombs in the com
puter, waiting for the right moment to erase
important files.
The virus that infiltrated Stanford was first
found last week in the Tresidder Union Mac
intosh II cluster, which is used mostly by
students in the lower division computer sci
ence classes.
The virus, named nVIR, has three known
strains. One of these randomly deletes files

from infected disks. The particular strain
found in over a dozen computers at Tresidder,
however, is not thought to be harmful, ac
cording to campus computer specialist Lance
Nakata.
Nakata, who discovered the problem last
week after he received a tip via electronic
mail, detroyed nVIR by using an anti-virus
program called a "vaccine," an analogue to
protection against human viruses.
Before he cured Tresidder of the virus, it
had already infected an untold number of
students' disks and had subsequently spread
through some of Meyer's new Macintosh II
computers. An unsuspecting student probably
carried a contaminated disk from Tresidder
to Meyer, extending the contagion, Nakata

said.
Stanford is not the only university feeling
the wrath of viruses. George Washington Uni
versity was hit by an epidemic of the IBM
virus called "Brain."
According to a computer specialist at George
Washington University, the particular Brain
strain that hit the campus was not written
to cause harm. Nonetheless, any virus poses
danger by its very nature as a contagious
disease, he addei.
Self-replication is the primary function of
any virus, and translated into effect, this
means a virus can write over some pre-existing
data in order to make room for itself. Often
the virus erases crucial information, regard
less of its benign intentions.
The Brain virus spread like wildfire, infect
ing an estimated 100,000 disks across the
country, according to Time magazine.
The Brain virus was created by two Pakis
tani brothers who own a computer software
business that sells pirated software. Ironically,
they decided to to punish their own customers
— many of whom were Americans — for
buying illegal software they themselves sold.
In an eerie reminder of the dangers of
viruses, they had hidden the words "WEL
COME TO THE DUNGEON" in the code of
the virus. The address and names of the au
thors also appear in the message so that people
who have uncovered the infectious program
can send away for the antidote.
Although the particular nVIR strain that

struck Stanford was relatively in
nocuous by computer virus stand
ards, the incident draws attention
to a national crisis in the world
of computers. And since comput
ers now occupy the heart of Amer
ican industry, the stakes in this
crisis are high.
To say the least, people are
worried. The ease with which
computers can be infiltrated by
these disastrous lines of code is
unnerving. And although an
tidotes can be developed for each
virus created, there is no guaran
tee the antidote can be created in
time to halt the virus before it
destrovs huee amounts of data.
In May of this year, on Friday
the 13th, the country of Israel
was to celebrate its 40th anniver

sary. As the country celebrated,
a nation-wide computer program
was designed by an unknown
"hacker" to erase itself simulta
neously.
In a lucky break, computer
users at Jerusalem's Hebrew Uni
versity noticed the slow operation
of their computers and discovered
the system was clogged with a
computer virus mercilessly
replicating.
An antidote was written and no
data was lost. Nevertheless, the
implications of the event are
frightening. A similar virus in the
United States, permeating indus
try and government computers,
could paralyze the country.
The irony is that the trend in
computing, the linking of vast
numbers of computers in net
works, is making computers ever
more vulnerable to computer
"hackers" who are often respon
sible for creating and spreading

viruses.
Each new link in the system
adds another target for an invader
such as a virus. And each new
link adds one more hole for med
dlers to tamper with the entire
network.
"On a large scale, the critical
question is how hard a virus is
to propagate," said Jonathon
Shapiro, a computer enthusiast
who works as technical staff at
AT&T's Bell Laboratories. There
are a certain number of computer
links, "below which it is hard for
a virus to propagate, above which
it is very easy," he said.
Shapiro is all too aware of the
vulnerability of large networks.
He said the phone network is the
most susceptible of all. The vul
nerability of the phone system was
evidenced in the early 1970s with
the advent of the "blue box," a
device that generates tones to fool
the phone company that money

has been entered into the phone.
It is through giant computer
networks that these viruses breed
most abundantly. At Stanford,
"clusters" of computers are linked
to a common file server that stu
dents can access to load programs
into the computer.
Fisher called these clusters
"breeding grounds for viruses."
Vaccines are now protecting
Stanford computers against the
nVIR virus, but the clusters are
vulnerable to other viruses not
stopped by this particular an
tidote.
Viruses have sprung up all over
the world, raising critical ques
tions about the severity of the
problem. The possibility that
viruses could invade computers
used for a country's banking in
dustry or for national security
frightens many.
"I would say it is unbelievably
unlikely that (viruses could infect)

national security computers," said
Fisher.
For very important security
matters, computers are only
accessed by a few users and they
are not allowed to bring commer
cial software from outside sources
onto the computers, Fisher said.
In this way, only a disgruntled
employee would be able to in
filtrate the system.
Some centers responsible for
national security, however, are
susceptible to virus attack. The
problem of computer security
hangs over Lawrence Livermore
Laboratory, where scientists
create technology for nuclear
weapons and extensively research
the Strategic Defense Initiative.
"We have had two instances
right here of imported viruses,"
said Livermore's Cole. The out
breaks were limited to erasing
files from some of the disks and
"were hand-carried to the corn

puters," Cole said.
Already, 48 states around the
country have passed legislation
concerning computer viruses. On
the first of the year, California
enacted legislation stating that
anyone who "knowingly accesses
and without permission adds, al
ters, damages, or destroys any
data, computer software, or com
puter programs" in computers
and networks is guilty of an of
fense.
The harsh penalties include be
fines as high as $10,000, loss of
computer equipment and three
years in prison.
As awareness grows in the com
puter profession, the problem of
viruses is not going away. Liver
more's Cole only predicts that it
will get worse in the short-run,
"spiralling" in an ever-increasing
battle between virus engineers
and antidote makers.
A computer panic sweeping the country in
recent months hit the Stanford campus last
