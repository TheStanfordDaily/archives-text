## Computer viruses imperil the health of American industry 
### Jock Friedly Staff writer 
A computer panic sweeping the country in
recent months hit the Stanford campus last
week, and students and administrators alike
are worried.
Computer viruses, small programs that act
much like human viruses, have infected many
thousands of computers around the country,
in companies, laboratories, universities and
homes.
The viruses that have been discovered vary
in design and consequence, but according to
one lecturer in computer science, Steve Fisher,
"a virus can do almost anything." And he
adds, viruses potentially pose a "very serious"
problem to the nation.
"To imagine that there's some sanctity to
the distribution of software is . .. ridiculous,"
said Chuck Cole, deputy computer security
manager of nearby Lawrence Livermore Na
tional Laboratory
Dozens of viruses have been made, some
harmless such as the strain contaminating
computers around the Stanford campus.
Others can sit like time bombs in the com
puter, waiting for the right moment to erase
important files.
The virus that infiltrated Stanford was first
found last week in the Tresidder Union Mac
intosh II cluster, which is used mostly by
students in the lower division computer sci
ence classes.
The virus, named nVIR, has three known
strains. One of these randomly deletes files

from infected disks. The particular strain
found in over a dozen computers at Tresidder,
however, is not thought to be harmful, ac
cording to campus computer specialist Lance
Nakata.
Nakata, who discovered the problem last
week after he received a tip via electronic
mail, detroyed nVIR by using an anti-virus
program called a "vaccine," an analogue to
protection against human viruses.
Before he cured Tresidder of the virus, it
had already infected an untold number of
students' disks and had subsequently spread
through some of Meyer's new Macintosh II
computers. An unsuspecting student probably
carried a contaminated disk from Tresidder
to Meyer, extending the contagion, Nakata

said.
Stanford is not the only university feeling
the wrath of viruses. George Washington Uni
versity was hit by an epidemic of the IBM
virus called "Brain."
According to a computer specialist at George
Washington University, the particular Brain
strain that hit the campus was not written
to cause harm. Nonetheless, any virus poses
danger by its very nature as a contagious
disease, he addei.
Self-replication is the primary function of
any virus, and translated into effect, this
means a virus can write over some pre-existing
data in order to make room for itself. Often
the virus erases crucial information, regard
less of its benign intentions.
The Brain virus spread like wildfire, infect
ing an estimated 100,000 disks across the
country, according to Time magazine.
The Brain virus was created by two Pakis
tani brothers who own a computer software
business that sells pirated software. Ironically,
they decided to to punish their own customers
— many of whom were Americans — for
buying illegal software they themselves sold.
In an eerie reminder of the dangers of
viruses, they had hidden the words "WEL
COME TO THE DUNGEON" in the code of
the virus. The address and names of the au
thors also appear in the message so that people
who have uncovered the infectious program
can send away for the antidote.
Although the particular nVIR strain that
