# Speech's focus disappoints some
## 
### Kathy Lachenauer Editorial staff 
Although some got up at the crack
of dawn and others camped out in the
cold, several ardent Lloyd Bentsen sup
porters said yesterday the vice presi
dential candidate did not hit on enough
substantial issues â€” and spent too much
time jabbing back at Republican attacks.
Demanding that the Republican Party
"put the truth on the line," Bentsen
contended that his opponents were
"devaluing the currency" of the demo
cratic system by conducting a campaign
that resembles "a demogogic race for
county sheriff."

Junior Jenny Wolsk, a speech-goer
and Bentsen supporter, speculated that
the candidate's main goal was to deliver
a "psyche-up" speech that would not
dive into controversial issues.
"He has got to say anything he can
to avoid alienating his audience," Wolsk
said.
During his 25-minute speech, Bentsen
admitted that the Dukakis ticket has
"taken a beating in the polls and the
press."
Although freshman Dan Coromenfeld
said he plans to vote for the Democrats
on Nov. 8, he admitted that the speech
disappointed him.
"We could have watched this on TV.

He did not say anything substantial,"
Coromenfeld said.
However, Subodh Chandra, chair of
the Stanford Democrats, fully supported
Bentsen and said the candidate had no
choice but to defend himself against "the
falsehoods" of the Republicans.
"No one is going to talk to you about
the issues if they think your candidate
is lacking in American qualities," he
explained.
Chandra pointed out that Bentsen's
speech was substantive, especially dur
ing its latter half when Bentsen ad
dressed issues such as the environment.

Dukakis, according to Bentsen,
has launched a $6 billion project
to clean up the Boston Harbor.
Bentsen went on to question
Vice President George Bush's
commitment to the environment,
joking that "Bush might be an
environmentalist. ... It just
depends on what environment he
is in."
Senior Glen Rosenbaum, an
Alondra resident assistant who
slept outside Kresge Auditorium
with five freshmen dormmates,
said Bentsen's jabs at the Repub
licans suggested that an "equiva
lent malice" exists between the
two parties. "It would have been
nice if he had addressed more isr
sues," he said.
A total of nine students camped
out for the speech. By 4 a.m. yes
terday, about 25 had gathered out
side Kresge. By 7 a.m., an esti
mated 400 students stood in a line
that almost reached the Stern
Hall parking lot.
