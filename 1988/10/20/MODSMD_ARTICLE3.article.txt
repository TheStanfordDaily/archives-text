# Speech's focus disappoints some

### Kathy Lachenauer Editorial staff 
Although some got up at the crack
of dawn and others camped out in the
cold, several ardent Lloyd Bentsen sup
porters said yesterday the vice presi
dential candidate did not hit on enough
substantial issues â€” and spent too much
time jabbing back at Republican attacks.
Demanding that the Republican Party
"put the truth on the line," Bentsen
contended that his opponents were
"devaluing the currency" of the demo
cratic system by conducting a campaign
that resembles "a demogogic race for
county sheriff."

Junior Jenny Wolsk, a speech-goer
and Bentsen supporter, speculated that
the candidate's main goal was to deliver
a "psyche-up" speech that would not
dive into controversial issues.
"He has got to say anything he can
to avoid alienating his audience," Wolsk
said.
During his 25-minute speech, Bentsen
admitted that the Dukakis ticket has
"taken a beating in the polls and the
press."
Although freshman Dan Coromenfeld
said he plans to vote for the Democrats
on Nov. 8, he admitted that the speech
disappointed him.
"We could have watched this on TV.

He did not say anything substantial,"
Coromenfeld said.
However, Subodh Chandra, chair of
the Stanford Democrats, fully supported
Bentsen and said the candidate had no
choice but to defend himself against "the
falsehoods" of the Republicans.
"No one is going to talk to you about
the issues if they think your candidate
is lacking in American qualities," he
explained.
Chandra pointed out that Bentsen's
speech was substantive, especially dur
ing its latter half when Bentsen ad
dressed issues such as the environment.
