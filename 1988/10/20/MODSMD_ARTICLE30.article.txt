# What is a virus?

The sly computer virus has
become the most recent scare
in the computer world — and
for good reason.
Viruses are small sections of
code that spread from disk to
disk, computer to computer in
an often unending cycle. Some
viruses are intended to be
harmless messages, but others
erase programs or "crash" com
puters.
The computer virus resem
bles the virus that invades the
human body in almost every
respect. And like the human
virus, the computer virus can
replicate itself uncontrollably.
To reproduce, human viruses
essentially hijack a DNA
molecule, the structure respon
sible for replication, "tricking"
it so as to create more viruses.
By similar means, computer
viruses will take over the op
erating system of the comput
er, if only for a couple of
seconds, to make copies of itself

on uninfected disks.
Once the virus is found and
studied, programmers can
write other programs that will
block its replication. Because
each virus is different, anti
virus programs are generally
only good for one virus.
File servers, hard disk drives
linked to many computers, can
be breeding grounds for
viruses. In addition, electronic
bulletin boards are common
storage areas for viruses.
Trading disks or copying pro
grams from other people helps
to spread viruses as well.
