# Writing for a 'captive American' audience
## Bay Area philanthropist and Stanford students co-author book on U.S. political crisis 
### Jennifer Cotteleer Staff writer 
Lee Brandenburg is a successful
Bay Area businessman who had
a bushelful of questions about the
American political and economic
situation. He also had a bushelful
of money.
Brandenburg found himself in
the enviable position of hiring
what he considered to be the "best
brainpower" available to help him
answer his questions.
"The Captive American" is the
result of combining the resources
of Brandenburg and several Stan
ford students.They came up with
. . . money and brains.
Originally, Brandenburg only
wanted the students to generate
research ideas and an outline for
a book that would answer the
questions about the economic and
political troubles of the United
States that had bothered him for
over 20 years. Brandenburg
wanted his book to answer these
questions clearly and concisely for
"the average American" reader.

The final product includes the
work of Stanford students beyond
the extent initially envisioned; not
only did they help research the
book, as originally intended, but
co-authored, published, promoted
and marketed the book side-by
side with Brandenburg.
Initially, Brandenburg asked
political science and economic pro
fessors as well as Hoover
Institution fellows to suggest
graduate students to work on his
research project. The mtyority of
student contributors, however,
responded to a flier posted on a
bulletin board at the Business
School, said Andrew Shepherd, a
student who quit work on his
graduate degree in political sci
ence to co-author "The Captive
American."
Shepherd replied early on to the
bulletin board posting, and he
recalled that his initial meeting
in the spring of 1987 with Bran
denburg got him hooked.
"I met Lee for the first time
after I saw the flier. His secretary
said to try and meet him on the

driving range. This dynamic guy
drives up in a red Jaguar and
says 'you play golf - fantastic,
you're on,"' he explained.
That introduction began Shep
herd's commitment to the coop
erative project, a commitment
that continues today as he assists
in the promotion of the finished
product.

He said working on
the book was the
most fun he has ever
had earning money,
and respects Bran
denburg for acting on
his ideals.

Approximately 12 students
responded to the flyer posted in
the spring of 1987, according to
Shepherd. By the middle of that
summer, the group had shrunk

to its final corps.
One of the five students, Joe
Peceny, also a political science
graduate student, said his moti
vation for joining the project was
"practical." He said an "exhor
bitant sum of money" compen
sated the students for their
talents.
Peceny said he initially thought
the program "looked fishy" be
cause of the unusually high hourly
wage. He did not attend the first
meeting but decided to get in
volved after a fellow political sci
ence graduate student, James
Babb, assured him that "it was
for real." He joined the group at
the second meeting.
Babb echoed the hesitancy that
Peceny felt about joining the proj
ect. It "seemed a little bizarre at
first 1 have to admit," said Babb.
Before enlisting with the project
Babb faced a summer with no
funding for his work. He said he
joined "more out of desperation
than anything else."
Both Peceny and Babb were
quick to point out that money

wasn't the only reason that they
stayed, despite the "purely mer
cenary" beginning of their asso
ciation with the project.
Babb, whose outline served as
the basis for the book, said he
became a "devil's advocate" for
the group during the time they
were hammering out the direction
for the book.
He said working on the book
was the most fun he has ever had
earning money, and respects
Brandenburg for acting on his
ideals.
"Brandenburg has really
populist, gut-level opinions and
that was refreshing;" it added to
the appeal of the project, said

Babb. Working with Brandenburg
was "like teaching a really intel
ligent undergraduate," he said.
Peceny said he "didn't agree
with everything" that Branden
burg had to say, but he "appre
ciated [Brandenburg's] challenge"
to aspects of the American polit
ical system, particularly the high
incumbency rate. Peceny said that
his respect for Brandenburg came
from recognizing the philan
thropist's proven sense of "civic
duty."
Brandenburg and several of the
contributing Stanford students
will be signing copies of "The Cap
tive American" at the Stanford
Bookstore today from 1-3 p.m.

joined "more out of desperation
than anything else."
Both Peceny and Babb were
quick to point out that money

wasn't the only reason that they
stayed, despite the "purely mer
cenary" beginning of their asso
ciation with the project.
Babb, whose outline served as
the basis for the book, said he
became a "devil's advocate" for
the group during the time they
were hammering out the direction
for the book.
He said working on the book
was the most fun he has ever had
earning money, and respects
Brandenburg for acting on his
ideals.
"Brandenburg has really
populist, gut-level opinions and
that was refreshing;" it added to
the appeal of the project, said

Babb. Working with Brandenburg
was "like teaching a really intel
ligent undergraduate," he said.
Peceny said he "didn't agree
with everything" that Branden
burg had to say, but he "appre
ciated [Brandenburg's] challenge"
to aspects of the American polit
ical system, particularly the high
incumbency rate. Peceny said that
his respect for Brandenburg came
from recognizing the philan
thropist's proven sense of "civic
duty."
Brandenburg and several of the
contributing Stanford students
will be signing copies of "The Cap
tive American" at the Stanford
Bookstore today from 1-3 p.m.
Lee Brandenburg is a successful
Bay Area businessman who had
a bushelful of questions about the
American political and economic
situation. He also had a bushelful
of money.
Brandenburg found himself in
the enviable position of hiring
what he considered to be the "best
brainpower" available to help him
answer his questions.
"The Captive American" is the
result of combining the resources
of Brandenburg and several Stan
ford students.They came up with
. . . money and brains.
Originally, Brandenburg only
wanted the students to generate
research ideas and an outline for
a book that would answer the
questions about the economic and
political troubles of the United
States that had bothered him for
over 20 years. Brandenburg
wanted his book to answer these
questions clearly and concisely for
"the average American" reader.

The final product includes the
work of Stanford students beyond
the extent initially envisioned; not
only did they help research the
book, as originally intended, but
co-authored, published, promoted
and marketed the book side-by
side with Brandenburg.
Initially, Brandenburg asked
political science and economic pro
fessors as well as Hoover
Institution fellows to suggest
graduate students to work on his
research project. The mtyority of
student contributors, however,
responded to a flier posted on a
bulletin board at the Business
School, said Andrew Shepherd, a
student who quit work on his
graduate degree in political sci
ence to co-author "The Captive
American."
Shepherd replied early on to the
bulletin board posting, and he
recalled that his initial meeting
in the spring of 1987 with Bran
denburg got him hooked.
"I met Lee for the first time
after I saw the flier. His secretary
said to try and meet him on the

driving range. This dynamic guy
drives up in a red Jaguar and
says 'you play golf - fantastic,
you're on,"' he explained.
That introduction began Shep
herd's commitment to the coop
erative project, a commitment
that continues today as he assists
in the promotion of the finished
product.

He said working on
the book was the
most fun he has ever
had earning money,
and respects Bran
denburg for acting on
his ideals.

Approximately 12 students
responded to the flyer posted in
the spring of 1987, according to
Shepherd. By the middle of that
summer, the group had shrunk

to its final corps.
One of the five students, Joe
Peceny, also a political science
graduate student, said his moti
vation for joining the project was
"practical." He said an "exhor
bitant sum of money" compen
sated the students for their
talents.
Peceny said he initially thought
the program "looked fishy" be
cause of the unusually high hourly
wage. He did not attend the first
meeting but decided to get in
volved after a fellow political sci
ence graduate student, James
Babb, assured him that "it was
for real." He joined the group at
the second meeting.
Babb echoed the hesitancy that
Peceny felt about joining the proj
ect. It "seemed a little bizarre at
first 1 have to admit," said Babb.
Before enlisting with the project
Babb faced a summer with no
funding for his work. He said he
joined "more out of desperation
than anything else."

wasn't the only reason that they
stayed, despite the "purely mer
