						special claim to Stanford

Lee Brandenburg, the author
of "The Captive American," is
well known in the Bay Area
for his shopping and housing
developments. Stanford boasts
a highly visible Brandenburg
development of its own: Man-
Porlr
"I did that in 1969," recalls
Brandenburg. At that time he
received a call from Stanford

requesting "some quick
housing." He was also told that
the housing should be cheap â€”
and temporary.
The entire park was com
pleted in 86 days, according to
Brandenburg.
And he voices a sentiment
echoed by many on campus, "I
can't believe [Manzanital is
still standing."
