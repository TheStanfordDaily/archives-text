Hunter S. Thompson is a social
phenomenon, unique to newspa
per editorial page commentators.
The proud father of gonzo jour
nalism, Thompson's visceral, out
sider's edge to writing first
appeared in the pages of The Na
tional Observer in 1964, spawned
by the turbulence of the 19605.
Since then, however, Thompson
has inspired countless cheap im
itators, including P.J. O'Rourke,
to unsuccessful duplication.
Thompson's travels through the
bowels of the American socio
political psyche have taken him
from"The Observer" to "Rolling
Stone," through his "Fear and
Loathing" books and, of late, to
the pages of The San Francisco
Examiner.
With the "Generation of Swine,
Gonzo Papers Vol. 2: Tales of
Shame and Degradation in the
'80s," the latest compilation of
his writings, we are again treated
to Thompson's inimitable style of
learned analysis and scathing
commentary.
As far as Thompson is con
cerned, there are no Sacred Cows
in the business. "We are, after all,
professionals," as he frequently
reminds us â€” lest we forget why
we would make the effort to allow
people like him to make a respect
able living doing what he does.
Thompson's greatest concern,
however, is with the failure of
those with whom the care of the
American Dream has been
entrusted: politicians.
The essays collected in the book
are, then, not surprisingly, cen
tered on election-year politics.
With the '88 election beginning
sometime shortly after November
6, 1984, the reader is treated to
the gamut of issues that have

graced the pages of newspapers
and television screens across the
country during the past four
years.
Choice words for Gary Hart,
Ollie North, George Bush, Dem
ocrats, Republicans, and yes, even
President Ronald Reagan abound.
Sure enough, instead of being a
mere rehash of old news, the book
is an engrossing diagnosis of the
condition of the American political
process.
Terminal? Maybe not, but
definitely schizophrenic, and a
touch psychotic. But fear not, Dr.
Thompson has innovative cures,
if not genuinely quack treatments
for our endless host of problems.
Reading the book is a breeze.
Written in an almost vernacular
style, Thompson avoids the
pretentious and pedantic in
sharing his opinions. While he
sometimes borders on the surreal,
he never fails to have one foot
firmly tethered onto the reality
that is the American socio
political system.
Don't worry about your politi
cal affiliation when you think
about reading "Generation of
Swine;" in Thompson's eyes, all
current parties are equally
reprehensible.
While the incumbent adminis
tration receives its necessarily
larger dose of derision, those who

wish to unseat the Republicans
are by no means immune to the
author's barbed tongue and in fact
are sometimes held to higher
standards. Give us a reason to
change. The Seven Dwarves? Mi
chael Dukakis? You be the judge.
Who is the Generation of
Swine? That's us, and those whom
we put into office.
As Thompson notes, "Reagan's
children must be proud of him.
With AIDS and acid rain, there
is not much left in the way of life
and love and possibilities for these
short-changed children of the '80s.
"In addition to a huge and ter
minally crippling national debt,
and a shocking realization that
your country has slipped to the

status of a second-rate power, and
that five American dollars will
barely buy a cup of coffee in
Tokyo, these poor buggers are
being flogged every day of their
lives with the knowledge that sex
is death and rain kills fish and
any politician they see on TV is
a liar and a fool."
Are things as bad as Hunter S.
Thompson thinks they are? You
be the judge.
Anyways, it's a great read. It's
at the Bookstore now, and while
it's still a best-seller, you can get
it for 12 bucks!
