## Soccer cracks top 20 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
It's official. The Stanford women's soccer
team has made its turnaround complete.
In a mere eleven months, Stanford has
accomplished what some soccer programs
take years, even decades, to accomplish.
The Cardinal has gone from being a 4-10-4
ballclub in 1987, one of the pushovers of
the western region, to a top-20 soccer
power.
In the Gatorade National College Soccer
Ranking released on Monday, Stanford not
only jumped into the top 20 in the poll
but also vaulted over five other teams to
the 15th position. Indeed, the Cardinal is
more than deserving; Stanford's six-game
winning streak and 9-3-1 record make the
team a shoo-in for a place in the coveted
poll.
Stanford's miraculous 1988 campaign
continues tomorrow when the Cardinal
hosts an extremely tough Cal State-
Hayward team. The Pioneers enter with
an accumulation of some very impressive
numbers. They check into the match main
taining the national ranking that they have
monopolized for the entire 1988 season:
No. 2 in the NCAA Division II poll.
Hayward also enters with a head-turning
12-2-0 record, an extremely impressive tally
of wins despite the team's Division II
status.
Stanford has now reached the crossroads
in its season. Crunch time, do-or-die, call
it what you may — no matter what cliche
is chosen, the central point is that now
Stanford simply must win. The Cardinal

women have labored hour after hour in
both practices and games just to get into
their current position. If Stanford can get
by Hayward tomorrow at Harry Maloney
Field, then the Cardinal gets its "dream
shot" at California: they will play the Bears
on Saturday, at home, with the prize of an
almost-sure NCAA tourney bid going to
the winner.
Such an ideal shot at knocking off the
Golden Bears would be dream-like for the
Stanford team, especially for the 16 of the
23 roster players who were around for last
year's 4-10-4, season-long nightmare. Sure
ly, none of those 16 could ever have antic
ipated the good fortune the team has ex
perienced in 1988 or the team's surpris
ingly promising position entering the game
versus the Bears.
Before the Cardinal players can even let
their minds wander to the imminent arrival
of the Bears at the Farm, however, they
must first turn all of their attention to the
invading Pioneers. Hayward offers a very
formidable obstacle to the Cardinal. With
a win, Stanford could extend its winning
streak to a phenomenal seven games and
sweep into their match against Cal with
an incredible opportunity of stealing a sure
NCAA tourney bid.
On the other hand, in suffering a loss,
Stanford could have its NCAA tournament
balloon abruptly punctured. The NCAA
Tournament's selection committee is
scrutinizing each and every candidate for
the four at-large berths in the post-season
tourney. A loss tomorrow to Hayward dur
ing this critical late-season play would be
detrimental to Stanford's hopes.

two assists on the season, has been part of an effort that has catapulted the Cardinal into the top 20 for the first
time in the team's history.
