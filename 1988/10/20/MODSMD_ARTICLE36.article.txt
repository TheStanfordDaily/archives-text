# Dodgers are on the brink

OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) - Jay
Howell got Mark McGwire and
got even with the Oakland Ath
letics. Now it's up to Orel Her
shiser to get it all for Los Angeles'
depleted Dodgers.
Howell retired McGwire with
the bases loaded in the seventh
inning last night, preserving a 4-3
victory and putting the Dodgers
within one game of winning the
World Series.
They lead three games to one,
an advantage that 30 of 35 teams
have turned into the champion
ship.
"What a tremendous victory for
one of the weakest teams in the
history of the World Series to beat
one of the strongest teams,"
Dodger manager Tom Lasorda
said. "They're so good, they
should allow us two runs before
we begin."
Los Angeles clung to a one-run
lead when McGwire, who hit a
game-winning homer off Howell
in the ninth inning the previous
night, stepped to the plate again.
This time, Howell got revenge
when McGwire swung at a first
pitch fastball and popped up.
McGwire was left on deck when
Dave Parker popped up to end
the game with a runner on first
base.
Hershiser will try to give the
Dodgers their sixth title and first
since 1981 in Game 5 tonight
against Oakland's Storm Davis.
Hershiser, the most dominant
pitcher in baseball this season,
shut out the A's on five hits in
Game 2.
The Dodgers did it last night
with top hitters Kirk Gibson and
Mike Marshall unable to start,
pitcher John Tudor out for the

WORLD SERIES
WRAP-UP

Series and catcher Mike Scioscia
forced out with a twisted right
knee in the fourth inning. By the
seventh inning, Lasorda had only
Gibson and .249 hitter Dave An
derson available for pinch hitting.
Lasorda said he told his players
before the game that "we don't
have Gibson, we don't have Mar
shall and Tudor's out for the year.
Everybody expects us to fold this
tent and leave. I said, 'You guys
are going to show them that
you've been a winner all season
and you're going to beat them
with whoever goes out there."'
Howell went out there, and this
time he didn't let his teammates
down.
He relieved starter Tim Belcher
with two outs in the seventh and
the Dodgers ahead 4-3, but a walk
and an error loaded the bases.
McGwire, just l-for-13 in the
Series, popped up to first baseman
Tracy Woodson. Howell finished
for a save in the same ballpark
where fans constantly booed him
last year when he pitched for the
A's.
"He did the job he had to do.
That was a tough one," Oakland
manager Tony La Russa said.
"That was a real tough save."
Howell ended it by striking out
A's home-run king Jose Canseco,

who hit a grand slam in the first
game, on a 3-2 pitch and getting
Parker on a foul pop to third.
The Dodgers ended a streak of
13 consecutive victories by the
home team in the World Series.
Oakland's starting lineup had
out-homered Los Angeles 132-36
this season, but Belcher and
Howell continued the Athletics'
Series-long slump.
Belcher, just the third pitcher
to start in the Series on his
birthday — he turned 27 — went
six and two-thirds innings and al
lowed three runs, two of them
earned, on seven hits.
Dave Stewart, the two-time 20-
game winner, took the loss. He
gave up four runs, only two
earned, on six hits in six and one
third innings.
Neither team played particu
larly well. Oakland made two er
rors and Los Angeles one, al
though there were several other
sloppy plays.
Dave Henderson, who had four
of Oakland's nine hits, doubled
home Walt Weiss, who singled, in
the seventh. That finished Bel
cher, and Howell walked Canseco
on five pitches before usually reli
able shortstop Alfredo Griffin
