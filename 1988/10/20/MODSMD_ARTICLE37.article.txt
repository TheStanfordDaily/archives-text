# Is the NHL on its last legs?
## 
### 
This may seem out of the
blue, but it occurred to me that
since the season is now under
way, someone should comment
about the impact of the Wayne
Gretzky trade on the National
Hockey League.

There has been no impact.
And that's not to say that there
won't be. It's just that nothing
has happened. Not yet.
In fact, despite renewed en
thusiasm in Gretzky's new
home of Los Angeles, the NHL
is in the worst shape of its life.
I'm talking about serious trou
ble.
And lack of national exposure
is the reason. Plain and simple.
You see, ESPN filed for
divorce and won. No longer will
the national cable network pro
vide weekly coverage of the
NHL. That means that no one
will be piping hockey games into
San Francisco, Oakland,
Phoenix or other hockey-starved
areas. The only people now con
cerned with hockey are the local
cable companies in current NHL
cities.
If you don't watch hockey, this
may not seem like such a big

deal. I admit that I only turned
on ESPN when the Flyers were
playing or it was playoff time.
But this is significant for an
other reason.
In three words, ESPN sold
out. By dumping hockey, ESPN
is admitting that the NHL was
being used. Like a handi-wipe.
Once ESPN's share of the
viewer market was established
— mainly through college foot
ball and hockey — the cable net
work went for the top prize, the
NFL.
Soon, the NFL realized that
ESPN had a real viewership and
wanted a wedding of its own.
So the two began talking, and
now we have Sunday night foot
ball on ESPN. Fine. It was just
about the only night during the
fall that you could turn on the
TV and not see pro football. Ex
cept maybe Tuesday and Wed
nesday. Otherwise, you have the
special Thursday night edition
of Monday Night Football, or
the NBC special Friday night
edition of NFL '88, or CBS' spe
cial Thanksgiving — you get the
idea.
So ESPN landed the big fish,
then threw the less lucrative
NHL back in the water. And
that's what scares me.
The way it stands now, the
Big Three sports — football,
baseball and basketball —
gobble up most of the airtime
during their respective seasons.
Yet other sports with substan
tial followings still have network
contracts. Ending these con
tracts would put such sports on

the brink of extinction.
ESPN has done this to the
NHL. The major networks un
plugged the NHL's respirator.
Then ESPN played sadist, sit
ting next to the electrical outlet
by the NHL's bed. When the
NHL was about to go under,
ESPN plugged it back in. When
the NHL started feeling better,
ESPN cut the cord in half.
What does all this mean, you
ask? One thing. The NHL has
no national outlet. The reason
the Big Three are so big is their
national support. People from
Juneau, Alaska, to Portland,
Maine, follow the Big Three. I'm
from Phoenix and will attest
that most Phoenicians have a
favorite baseball team. But
many Phoenicians have never
seen a hockey game. Or can't
remember what a Phoenix
Roadrunners hockey game was
like. Just like an occasional
hockey exhibition in the Cow
Palace does not rekindle mem
ories of the California Golden
Seals. And this makes me sad.
Finally, we return to The
Great One. Wayne Gretzky can
still save the NHL. He has the
capacity to give hockey national
exposure despite ESPN's ruth
less games. Why? Because he
will lead the Kings to an NHL
title. Soon. He is the single most
dominant athlete in any sport.
Ever.
Thank goodness he is, too. Be
cause if he weren't, the NHL
would go under before the Stan
ley Cup lands in L.A.. Gretzky
may yet be nicknamed Moses.

Palace does not rekindle mem
ories of the California Golden
Seals. And this makes me sad.
Finally, we return to The
Great One. Wayne Gretzky can
still save the NHL. He has the
capacity to give hockey national
exposure despite ESPN's ruth
less games. Why? Because he
will lead the Kings to an NHL
title. Soon. He is the single most
dominant athlete in any sport.
Ever.
Thank goodness he is, too. Be
cause if he weren't, the NHL
would go under before the Stan
ley Cup lands in L.A.. Gretzky
may yet be nicknamed Moses.
