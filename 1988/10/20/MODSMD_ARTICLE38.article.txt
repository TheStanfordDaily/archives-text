# Hard work, dedication pay off for Gray
## 
### Doug Boeschen 
"Dedicated," "determined" and
"driven" are all words commonly
associated with Carol Gray, the
captain of Stanford's women's
cross country team.
The 5-4 junior from Indiana is
putting the competition far be
hind her while leading the lady
harriers toward the Pacific 10
Conference Championships. Al
though her early season form
looks strong, everyone, including
Gray, knows there is much more
to come.
"The times will drop once we
begin our speed work," she con
fidently states.
Coming off a win against Ohio
State in a dual meet, Gray recently
repeated her success with a first
place finish against a field of over
40 teams in the Stanford Invita
tional.
Such success is nothing new to
Gray, as her list of running ac
complishments is very impressive.
. As a senior in high school, she
was tops in the state in cross
; country and won the 1,600-met^r
* race later that same year in track
* and field. Her freshman year at
* Stanford proved her to be equally
I competitive at the collegiate level
* when she placed third in the Pac
; 10 Cross-Country Champion
* ships.
Last year as a sophomore Gray
* placed sixth in the NCAA Cham-
I pionships in the 10,000 and qual

ified for the Olympic Trials in
that same event — establishing
herself as one of the premier
young runners in the nation.
But all of this success does not
come easily. Workouts are very
tough — mile-repeat intervals,
swimming, speed work, weight
training — sore muscles and
exhaustion are common elements
of daily training. For her to
remain ahead of the competition,
Gray must make a great many
other sacrifices as well.

Gray takes the re
sponsibility of team
captain very seriously
and is quite vocal in
her support of her
teammates.

During the school year she has
little time for many of the things
she would like to do. Mqjoring in
applied earth science, Gray
realizes that she needs a great
deal of discipline in school as well
as on the track.
"If I want to excel, I have to
limit myself to running and study
ing," she says without regret.
Although admittedly shy out
side of running, there is no sign
of this reserve once Gray steps
on the track. She takes there

sponsibility of team captain very
seriously and is very vocal in her
support of her teammates. She
says that her successes in running
have given her confidence in her
self as well as in her ability. From
leading the team through work
outs to encouraging the other run
ners, the coaches recognize Gray's
important role on the team.
"Carol has taken it upon herself
to watch out for the team," says
Stanford Assistant Coach Betsy
Riccardi. "She's not just out there
for herself."
This unselfish attitude is
revealed in Gray's primary goal
of helping lead the cross-country
team to the national champion
ships. In such a highly in
dividualized sport such talented
and selfless leaders are rare.
Gray has been competing ever
since her freshman year of high
school, when she decided to try
running. Her motivation is
similar to that of many other top
runners. While during her first
years of running the glory of win
ning races was enough to keep
her going, her motivation now
stems from a different desire.
"I like the challenge — to try
to be the best I can be," she says
in a very determined voice. "I will
continue running as long as I see
improvement."
Even her decision to attend
Stanford was affected by this com
petitiveness. Wanting the athletic

and academic challenge of the best
school in the nation, Gray made
Stanford her first choice over
Michigan — a school well-known
for a strong running tradition and
powerful teams. After being
recruited by the Stanford coaches,
she seems happy with her decision
to come to Stanford.
Undoubtedly one of the tough
est conferences in the nation, the
Pac-10 keeps her challenged and
she eryoys training with the team.
Gray says the team members all
get along great together and she
"enjoys coming to practice every
day."
Her goals for the future include
making the 1992 Olympic team,
most likely in the 10,000. If her
success continues on its present
path, this would seem to be a
very attainable goal.
But Gray realizes it won't be
easy and, like the rest of her ac
complishments, will require a
great deal of hard work and ded
ication. She also knows that there
are very few people that have the
opportunity to pursue such a
glorious objective and she is not
unthankful.
"Every day I say I'm thankful
for what I have," she says in com
plete sincerity. And the Stanford
coaches can be just as pleased for
what they have. As long as Carol
Gray continues running ahead of
the competition, everyone at
Stanford will be thankful that she
is wearing Cardinal red.
