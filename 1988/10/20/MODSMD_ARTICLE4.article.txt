# Justice Kennedy avoids political controversy in campus speech

Taking the podium as he used to as
a law professor, Supreme Court Justice
Anthony Kennedy yesterday lectured
about the structure of the Constitution
to a near-capacity crowd at Kresge Au
ditorium.
Kennedy, who in 1958 graduated from
Stanford with a bachelor's in political
science and later taught at Sacramento's
McGeorge School of Law, gave a 45-
minute address in which he was careful
not to indicate how he may rule on any
matters that come before the court.
Kennedy said that in some areas the
court's interpretation of the Constitu
tion has strayed from the original intent
of its authors, citing such examples as
the downfall of federalism, the role of

administrative agencies in Congress and
the "dangers" of interest groups.
But he largely defended "critical ex
amination" of the document, saying that
"as we become more distant from the
intentions and purposes of the framers,
their ideas and their theories become
almost more pure."
He said that he used to be envious
of John Marshall, the first chief justice
of the Supreme Court, because Marshall
knew the framers and must have had
"clearer and more precise" judgment of
their intentions. But he said he now
believes that Marshall's understanding
of the theories underlying the Consti
tution must have been influenced by its
"partisan content and (the) overtones
(of the time)."
Today's court has a great advantage

because "200 years of constitutional ex
perience counts for something," he said.
In a brief interview with The Daily
on his way out of Kresge, Kennedy said
each justice's political ideology does not
significantly impact the court's deci
sions.
"Because appointments are spaced out
over time so much and they span ad
ministrations," he said, "I think (a bal
ance of ideologies) is logically inevita
ble."
Furthermore, most Supreme Court
decisions are made during the ar
gumentation of the case, he added. "We
are really up there wrestling," he said,
"not play-acting (political roles)."


Ken Beer — Daily
Anthony Kennedy, a Stanford graduate and freshman Supreme Court Justice, spoke
to a near-capacity audience at Kresge Auditorium yesterday.
"It's a process where we focus
on a specific case, not a
generality," he explained.
In the interview, Kennedy also
commented on charges that had
been made by civil rights leaders
during his nomination process.
Some activists charged that Ken
nedy had appeared unsympa
thetic in some racial and ethnic
discrimination cases before the
9th Circuit Court.
In November of last year, Ken
nedy resigned from the all-male
Olympic Club in San Francisco
and the exclusive Del Paso Coun
try Club of Sacramento, which has
no black members.
In addition, some have claimed
that Kennedy, because of a shel
tered upbringing, has difficulty in
understanding the societal bar
riers faced by people less fortu
nate than himself.
Kennedy grew up in an affluent
Sacramento neighborhood, attend
ed Stanford as an undergraduate,
spent a year at the London School
of Economics and earned his law
degree from Harvard.
Kennedy denied the validity of
the claims, stating, "I think I am
quite well aware of evils that still
exist in society and hardships that
many people have to endure. Our
oath of office requires us to do
justice without regard to persons,
and I'm completely capable of ful
filling my oath."
President Reagan nominated
Kennedy to succeed retiring Su

preme Court Justice Lewis Powell
after the failed nominations of
Judge Robert Bork and Judge
Douglas Ginsberg. In February,
Kennedy was unanimously ap
proved by the Senate, 97-0. Prior
to his appointment, he spent 12
years on the 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals in Sacramento where he
obtained the reputation of a prag
matic conservative. Kennedy is 52
years old.
Kennedy's presentation to the
Stanford community yesterday
focused on what he termed the
four "fundamental structural ele
ments of the constitution": the
separation of powers, checks and
balances, federalism and judicial
review.
He said the court has stayed
true to the intent of the framers
regarding the separation of
powers and the checks and
balances of the Constitution.
But he said the concept of
federalism developed by the
framers — the division of power
between state and national gov
ernment — has eroded to the point
that it is "unlikely that the
framers would recognize today the
federalism they created 200 years
ago."
In 18th century political
thought, Kennedy said, it was
"deemed necessary to find an in
dissoluable core that was called
sovereignty. The framers had the
vision and the foresight to split
the atom of sovereignty and that
was their great contribution to
political science. It's a historical
irony that (it) has not survived."
Kennedy, however, did not pass
judgment of this irony.
