# Justice Kennedy avoids political controversy in campus speech

Taking the podium as he used to as
a law professor, Supreme Court Justice
Anthony Kennedy yesterday lectured
about the structure of the Constitution
to a near-capacity crowd at Kresge Au
ditorium.
Kennedy, who in 1958 graduated from
Stanford with a bachelor's in political
science and later taught at Sacramento's
McGeorge School of Law, gave a 45-
minute address in which he was careful
not to indicate how he may rule on any
matters that come before the court.
Kennedy said that in some areas the
court's interpretation of the Constitu
tion has strayed from the original intent
of its authors, citing such examples as
the downfall of federalism, the role of

administrative agencies in Congress and
the "dangers" of interest groups.
But he largely defended "critical ex
amination" of the document, saying that
"as we become more distant from the
intentions and purposes of the framers,
their ideas and their theories become
almost more pure."
He said that he used to be envious
of John Marshall, the first chief justice
of the Supreme Court, because Marshall
knew the framers and must have had
"clearer and more precise" judgment of
their intentions. But he said he now
believes that Marshall's understanding
of the theories underlying the Consti
tution must have been influenced by its
"partisan content and (the) overtones
(of the time)."
Today's court has a great advantage

because "200 years of constitutional ex
perience counts for something," he said.
In a brief interview with The Daily
on his way out of Kresge, Kennedy said
each justice's political ideology does not
significantly impact the court's deci
sions.
"Because appointments are spaced out
over time so much and they span ad
ministrations," he said, "I think (a bal
ance of ideologies) is logically inevita
ble."
Furthermore, most Supreme Court
decisions are made during the ar
gumentation of the case, he added. "We
are really up there wrestling," he said,
"not play-acting (political roles)."
