# Nunn misses campus appearance
## Speakers stress importance of public service program in his absence

Citing an increasing "selfishness,
worship of money, and lack of altruism"
among many college-aged Americans,
Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., and other
Democratic leaders brought their cam
paign for a new voluntary national serv
ice program to Bishop Auditorium yes
terday.
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., who was
scheduled to appear with Johnston yes
terday, was unable to leave Washington,
D.C., because of last minute work on a
drug bill he is sponsoring.
Johnston was joined by Sen. Barbara
Mikulski, D-Md.; Kathleen Kennedy

Townsend, daughter of the late Robert
Kennedy and former aid to Michael Du
kakis; Charles Moskos, a professor at

Northwestern and a
public service expert;
and University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy.
In a "town meeting
style forum" with a
crowd of over 300, the
five discussed the "Cit
izen Corps," a program
that would encourage
public service by with
financial incentives.

If the program becomes law, volun
teers could earn vouchers worth up to
$24,000 toward college tuition, profes

sional training or a down payment on
a home. In turn, the students would
serve in either the military or social
sector for one or two years.
Moskos described the Citizen Corps
as "both high-minded and tough
minded" â€” "high-minded" because stu
dents students will devote several years
to public service, and "tough-minded"
because students will be required to
work for educational aid that now comes
in the form of unearned entitlement
benefits.
The professor said the program steers
a course between the philosophies of
"every man for himself and "soine-


Mikulski
thing for nothing."
Martin Anderson, senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution and a
former domestic policy adviser in
the Reagan adminstration, said in
a later interview with The Daily
that the Citizen Corps is a "cheap
public service project."
"First of all, students are being
well-payed for their work. It is
misleading to say it is a public
service program," said Anderson.
He added that it is "mean
spirited" because it will require
work from those who need federal
aid to finance college.
As the proposal stands now, the
$8 billion of federal aid that now
goes into programs for guaranteed
student loans and Pell grants will
be channeled into the Citizen
Corps program. The others will
gradually be phased out.
In their remarks, Mikulski and
Townsend concentrated on the
benefits received by the the stu
dents in the program rather than
those they would serve. They drew
on their own experiences in social
service. Mikulski said that such
service instills "the habits of the
heart" that are necessary for good
citizenship.
Mikulski offered her own ver
sion of a national service program,
which she said is modeled on the
National Guard. Students would
perform public service for one
weekend per month and two
weeks during the summer for up
to six years. The students would
receive vouchers for $3,000.
