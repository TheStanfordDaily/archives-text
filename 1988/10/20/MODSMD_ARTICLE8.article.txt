# Senate to elect new chair tonight
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate will elect a new senate
chair tonight at its second meeting of the
year. The position of chair was vacated two
weeks ago when Richard Vaughan, a grad
uate student in computer science, resigned
the post because he will be leaving Stanford
in .January.
The position was opened to any regis
tered Stanford student who declared can
didacy by Oct. 15.
Three students announced they would
run: junior Dana Klapper, junior Kelvin
Wong and David Porter, a graduate student
in industrial engineering.
Wong is the only candidate who is not
currently a member of the senate.
Last spring, both Wong and Porter ran
for senate chair against Vaughan.
Porter said he thinks most senators know
about the issue, because it was a minor
issue when he ran for senate chair last
spring.

Klapper said she hopes the expulsion is
not an issue in the election. "It's hard for
anyone who wasn't there to know what
went on," she said. "We need to give every
one a clean slate and not presuppose or
speculate."
Porter is strongly identified with the
People's Platform, a coalition of minority
and progressive students. Klapper and
Wong are not.
Some senators have commented that they
feel this affiliation may have a big effect
on the outcome of the election because the
senate is close to 50 percent People's Plat
form. In addition, the members of the
Council of Presidents are part of the Plat
form.
"I would hope that the members of the
senate would be able to look at all the
candidates and decide who could best do
the job," regardless of affiliation, Porter
said.
Sen. Millie Gong, a member of the Plat-
form, said she doesn't think it
will play such a large role.
People's Platform senators "vote
individually and think individu
ally," she said. "Just because we
support one candidate doesn't
mean all the [Platform] senators
will vote for him."
Klapper said she believes she
can "provide balanced leadership
for the senate," adding that she
feels "it is important to have a
senate chair who everyone feels
they can approach."
According to Klapper, the fact
that she is unaffiliated with any
other student group will help her
be unbiased. "No one can be com
pletely objective, but it is impor
tant to remain as fair as possible,"
she said.
Last year, Klapper was a mem
ber of the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility, which she
said gave her the "ability to speak
the administration's language."
The previous year, she served as
chair of the ASSU Speakers

Bureau Associate Committee, an
outreach program to determine
student interest in bringing
various speakers to campus.
Wong said he feels his main
qualification is that he has no
conflicts of interest. The senate
chair position would be his "only
commitment outside of school
work," he said.
The chair "should be objective
and have no agenda," he said. "He
has a responsibility to let all
senators speak."
Last year, Wong was a member
of the senate nominations com
mittee and served on Roble Hall's
dorm council.
Porter said he is "still inter
ested" in the position and highly
committed to the ASSU. He said
he believes his substantial ASSU
experience would make it easy for
him to step into the position,
which usually requires a summer
of preparation.
Porter, who earned a bachelor's
degree in industrial engineering
here in 1987, was a senator as a
sophomore, junior and fifth-year
senior. During his senior year he
was a member of the Council of
Presidents.

The chair 'should be
objective and have no
agenda.'

"I would be able to get the sen
ate off to a good start," Porter
said, adding that he would use
his "ASSU experience from the
past to help develop the future."
Porter has run several times
for senate chair. After his defeat
in the election of the spring of
1986, his attendance at senate
meetings dropped.
On Dec. 2, 1986, he was ex
pelled from the senate for poor
attendance.
A bill submitted by then Senate
Chair Jeff Soukup reads: "The
(ASSU) Bylaws state that if a
senator misses five or more meet
ings of the senate .. . within a
three month period, he is to be
expelled. . . . David last attended
a meeting this past summer."
However, Porter said in the fall
he resigned for academic reasons
and informed Soukup of his res
ignation.

(ASSU) Bylaws state that if a
senator misses five or more meet
ings of the senate .. . within a
three month period, he is to be
expelled. . . . David last attended
a meeting this past summer."
However, Porter said in the fall
he resigned for academic reasons
and informed Soukup of his res
ignation.
The ASSU Senate will elect a new senate
chair tonight at its second meeting of the
year. The position of chair was vacated two
weeks ago when Richard Vaughan, a grad
uate student in computer science, resigned
the post because he will be leaving Stanford
in .January.
The position was opened to any regis
tered Stanford student who declared can
didacy by Oct. 15.
Three students announced they would
run: junior Dana Klapper, junior Kelvin
Wong and David Porter, a graduate student
in industrial engineering.
Wong is the only candidate who is not
currently a member of the senate.
Last spring, both Wong and Porter ran
for senate chair against Vaughan.
Porter said he thinks most senators know
about the issue, because it was a minor
issue when he ran for senate chair last
spring.

Klapper said she hopes the expulsion is
not an issue in the election. "It's hard for
anyone who wasn't there to know what
went on," she said. "We need to give every
one a clean slate and not presuppose or
speculate."
Porter is strongly identified with the
People's Platform, a coalition of minority
and progressive students. Klapper and
Wong are not.
Some senators have commented that they
feel this affiliation may have a big effect
on the outcome of the election because the
senate is close to 50 percent People's Plat
form. In addition, the members of the
Council of Presidents are part of the Plat
form.
"I would hope that the members of the
senate would be able to look at all the
candidates and decide who could best do
the job," regardless of affiliation, Porter
said.
Sen. Millie Gong, a member of the Plat-
form, said she doesn't think it
will play such a large role.
People's Platform senators "vote
individually and think individu
ally," she said. "Just because we
support one candidate doesn't
mean all the [Platform] senators
will vote for him."
Klapper said she believes she
can "provide balanced leadership
for the senate," adding that she
feels "it is important to have a
senate chair who everyone feels
they can approach."
According to Klapper, the fact
that she is unaffiliated with any
other student group will help her
be unbiased. "No one can be com
pletely objective, but it is impor
tant to remain as fair as possible,"
she said.
Last year, Klapper was a mem
ber of the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility, which she
said gave her the "ability to speak
the administration's language."
The previous year, she served as
chair of the ASSU Speakers

Bureau Associate Committee, an
outreach program to determine
student interest in bringing
various speakers to campus.
Wong said he feels his main
qualification is that he has no
conflicts of interest. The senate
chair position would be his "only
commitment outside of school
work," he said.
The chair "should be objective
and have no agenda," he said. "He
has a responsibility to let all
senators speak."
Last year, Wong was a member
of the senate nominations com
mittee and served on Roble Hall's
dorm council.
Porter said he is "still inter
ested" in the position and highly
committed to the ASSU. He said
he believes his substantial ASSU
experience would make it easy for
him to step into the position,
which usually requires a summer
of preparation.
Porter, who earned a bachelor's
degree in industrial engineering
here in 1987, was a senator as a
sophomore, junior and fifth-year
senior. During his senior year he
was a member of the Council of
Presidents.

The chair 'should be
objective and have no
agenda.'

"I would be able to get the sen
ate off to a good start," Porter
said, adding that he would use
his "ASSU experience from the
past to help develop the future."
Porter has run several times
for senate chair. After his defeat
in the election of the spring of
1986, his attendance at senate
meetings dropped.
On Dec. 2, 1986, he was ex
pelled from the senate for poor
attendance.
A bill submitted by then Senate
Chair Jeff Soukup reads: "The
(ASSU) Bylaws state that if a
senator misses five or more meet
ings of the senate .. . within a
three month period, he is to be
expelled. . . . David last attended
a meeting this past summer."
However, Porter said in the fall
he resigned for academic reasons
and informed Soukup of his res
ignation.
