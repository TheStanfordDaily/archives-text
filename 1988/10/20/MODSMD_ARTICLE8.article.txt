The ASSU Senate will elect a new senate
chair tonight at its second meeting of the
year. The position of chair was vacated two
weeks ago when Richard Vaughan, a grad

The position was opened to any regis

in industrial engineering.
Wong is the only candidate who is not
currently a member of the senate.

for senate chair against Vaughan.
Porter said he thinks most senators know
about the issue, because it was a minor
issue when he ran for senate chair last
spring.

Klapper said she hopes the expulsion is

anyone who wasn't there to know what
went on," she said. "We need to give every
one a clean slate and not presuppose or
speculate."
Porter is strongly identified with the
People's Platform, a coalition of minority
and progressive students. Klapper and
Wong are not.
Some senators have commented that they
feel this affiliation may have a big effect
on the outcome of the election because the
senate is close to 50 percent People's Plat
form. In addition, the members of the
Council of Presidents are part of the Plat

"I would hope that the members of the
senate would be able to look at all the
candidates and decide who could best do
the job," regardless of affiliation, Porter
said.
