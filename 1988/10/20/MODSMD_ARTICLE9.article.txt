# Joint appointments link Stanford and Hoover
## 
### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
While the official relationship between
the Hoover Institution and the Univer
sity is still unclear, some scholars are
bridging the gap through a joint appoint
ment process.
Currently, 19 scholars are linked to
both the University and Hoover by joint
appointments. They serve a dual role as
both researchers at Hoover and instruc
tors in the classroom.

Hoover Fellow George Marotta has
suggested that joint appointments could
ease the tension between faculty mem
bers and Hoover fellows by building
greater understanding and tolerance
among the two groups.
The 19 Hoover scholars hold joint ap
pointments in University departments
such as economics, history, political sci
ence and sociology. Some also have ap
pointments at the Law School and the
Graduate School of Business. Since
March 1986, six joint appointments be
tween Hoover and the University have
been approved.
Robert Hall said he sees advantages
in being both a Stanford economics pro
fessor and a Hoover senior fellow.
Joint appointments have "always had
an important role to play in trying to
explain to the the faculty what Hoover
really is and in explaining to the people
at Hoover what's going on in the fac
ulty," Hall said.
He added that there is "only har
mony" between the Economics Depart

ment and Hoover. In fact, the two bodies
often hold joint seminars.
Business School Prof. Robert Hesson,
who is also a Hoover researcher, said
he believes that not enough University
departments are taking advantage of
joint appointments.
Hoover boasts of "such outstanding
experts, for them not to be called upon
to teach is a tragic waste of resources,"
Hesson said.
He speculated that Hoover researchers
are "passed up" for departmental ap
pointments because they are victims of
political bias.
"My impression is that most people
at Hoover are tainted with the stigma
of being conservative, anti-communist
or both, and therefore have been passed
over" when departments make appoint
ments, Hesson said.
"Someone who wanted to be a
matchmaker would find little resistance
from Hoover people and most resistance
from within the departments," Hesson
added.
"[lt is] difficult to go to a department
and offer yourself for teaching. It's a
little like inviting yourself to a party."
But Prof. Nancy Cartwright, chair of
philosophy, said Hoover researchers
have not shown an interest in her de
partment. She added that appointments
are usually initiated on an informal
basis.
"It's not as if anyone is opposed or
in favor of joint appointments with Hoo
ver. It's not like we're all sitting around
wondering who we're going to joint ap
point next. Someone has to ask about
it," she said.
Cartwright said there is "no indication
that [the Hoover fellows] are in
terested in us."
"I have personally never met
anyone from Hoover at our
departmental colloquia or lec
tures," Cartwright said.
Explaining how the joint ap
pointment process works, Provost
Jim Rosse said both the depart
ment and Hoover need to agree
to the appointment but the ultim
ate authority lies with the depart
ments because they are "charged
with (the) responsibility of
managing the curriculum."
However, Prof. Richard Brody,
last year's political science chair,
pointed out that one fellow who
was offered a courtesy appoint
ment rejected it. Brody also la
mented the fact that there are not
more joint appointments in the
Political Science Department.
"I am troubled that some people
in Hoover who I would like to see
as my colledgues are not," he said.
