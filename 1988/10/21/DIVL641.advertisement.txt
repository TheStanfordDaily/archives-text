EVERYONE TALKS
ABOUT CHANGING THE WORLD.
THIS YEAR
3750 PEOPLE WILL
ACTUALLY DO IT
Not everyone is cut out to change the world. After all, it takes education, skills
and a spare two years.
Also a willingness to work. Hard.
This year 3,750 Americans will join the Peace Corps to do just that. They'll do
things like build roads, plant forests and crops, teach English, develop small businesses,
train community health workers, or even coach basketball. However, what they'll be
doing isn't half as important as the fact that they'll be changing a little piece of the
world.. for the better.
And when they return, these 3,750 Americans will find that experience doing
hard work will have another benefit. It's exactly what their next employers are
looking for.
So, give the Peace Corps your next two years. And while you're out changing
the world, you'll also be making a place in it for yourself
MAKE PEACE CORPS PART OF YOUR WORLD.
Peace Corps representatives will be at Stanford to talk about new programs
and opportunities for overseas service. Please stop by at our information table
or attend one of the scheduled film shows to find out now you can get started
at "the toughest job you'll ever love."
