We've got a
big job for you.
If the challenge of consolidating over 36 different models of disk drives,
disk storage devices, and printers into the most advanced peripherals in
Information Systems sounds big, your opportunity awaits at Unisys
Peripherals Group.
By bringing together the best of our peripheral product lines to
serve high-end Unisys mainframes, we're exploring technologies that
range from thin-film magnetics to laser printing and magneto-optic
storage. And by being a member of Unisys, a world leader in
information systems, we have the resources of a $10 billion
corporation to help us meet our challenge.
Find out more, Wednesday October 26.
Unisys Peripherals Group representatives will be
at Stanford for an Information Session on
Wednesday, October 26, from 7:00 - 9:00 p.m. in
Tressider Memorial Union/Oak Lounge East, to
discuss the challenges and opportunities for
you. We have openings for students about to
graduate with degrees in:
BS/MS lE, ME, EE, CS
You and Unisys. The big idea.
Along with the resources of
Unisys and the challenges
here, we offer competitive
salaries and a
comprehensive array of benefits for personal care
and financial well-being. Add to that a central
location in Santa Clara that affords easy access to
freeways and expressways, and you have a big job
with even bigger potential. We are an equal
opportunity employer.
