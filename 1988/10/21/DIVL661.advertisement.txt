You don't need
your parents' money
to buy a Macintosh.
■
Just their signature.
It's never been difficult for students to
convince their parents of the need for a
Macintosh* computer at school.
Persuading them to write the check,
however, is another thing altogether.
Which is why Apple created the Student
Loan-to-Own Program. An ingenious loan
program that makes buying a
Macintosh as easy as using one.
Simply pick up an application
at the location listed below,
or call 800 831 LOAN.
All your parents need
to do is fill it out, sign it, and send it. If
they qualify, they'll receive a check for
you in just a few weeks.
There's no collateral. No need to prove
financial hardship. No application fee.
Best of all, the loan payments can be
spread over as many as 10 years.
Which gives you and your parents
plenty of time to decide just who pays for
it all.
