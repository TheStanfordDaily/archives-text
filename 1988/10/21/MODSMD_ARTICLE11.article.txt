# Health insurers to pay claims under Prop. 101
## 
### Mark Richman 
Proposition 101, sponsored
by the insurance industry, is
one of five insurance initiatives
on the Nov. 8 California ballot,
all of which claim to answer a
consumer revolt against
booming auto insurance rates
in the state.
Backers of this initiative
claim it will slash auto insur
ance rates, curtail lawyers' fees
and Btart a new system of com
pensation that differentiates
between intangible psychic and
emotional damages and con
crete physical damages.
Two other initiatives, Prop.
104 and Prop. 106, are spon
sored by the insurance indus
try. The former would institute
statewide no-fault insurance
and the latter would, like 101,
curtail lawers' fees.
An initiative identified with
consumer advocate Ralph
Nader, Prop. 103 would set up
an elected insurance commis
sioner, while Prop. 100, spon
sored by California's trial
lawyers, would require insur
ance companies to reduce rates
for good driving and would re
quire the California Depart
ment of Insurance to review
auto insurance rates.
All claim to reduce rates, and
all have initiated huge, often
confusing and conflicting TV

ad campaigns. How is Prop. 101
different?
The basic premise of the in
itiative is a shift in the burden
of insurance from auto in
surers to health insurers. Prop.
101 mandates a one-time, 50-
percent cut in auto insurance
premiums covering bodily in
jury. Rates would then be
frozen for one year and there
after raised according to the
rate of inflation of medical
costs.
It restricts rewards for "non
economic" damages — includ
ing mental distress and trauma
— to 25 percent of the rewards
for economic damages, like
bodily and property damage.
Health insurance companies
will pick up the burden of med
ical coverage, allowing for the
lower rates.
But the bottom line for con
sumers may be that the ovemU
insurance bill stays the saraa
because the health insurers
could counter by raising their
own rates.
Opponents of Prop. 101 say
there are better ways of cutting
costs. One opponent is Ken Cooley,
chief counsel of the state Assem
bly's Finance and Insurance Com
mittee. Cooley advocates no-fault
insurance, called for in Prop. 104,
which would allow insurance com
panies to reduce premiums by
eliminating many legal and
administrative costs.
Under no-fault, clients deal only
with their own insurance compa
ny, rather than suing another
driver's company to prove respon
sibility for an accident.
