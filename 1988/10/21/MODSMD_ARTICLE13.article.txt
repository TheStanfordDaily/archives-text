# Top telecommunicator stresses expansion
## 
### Janine DeFao 
Warning that the United States
has fallen behind in the telecom
munications field, President
Reagan's principal technology ad
viser stressed in a speech yester
day at the Law School that the
nation must continue "expanding
telecommunications options" to
compete in international markets.
Before an audience of local busi
ness leaders, Alfred Sikes, U.S.
assistant secretary of commerce
for communications and informa
tion, outlined an important new
Commerce Department report on
telecommunications trends, re
leased this month.
Called "Telecom 2000: Charting
the Course for a New Century,"
the report garnered Sikes praise

in the Oct. 17 issue of Commu
nications Week for "wielding in
fluence with an even-handed,
studied approach rising above
party politics."
To date, the majority of the na
tion's telecommunications goals
have been accomplished, Sikes
said. He noted, however, that the
field is rapidly growing and
stressed the importance of U.S.
involvement in changes that
will occur before the year 2000.
One of the most important
benefits of advanced telecommun
ications, according to Sikes, is
that it will "improve the quality
of people's lives." He cited as ex
amples "the major opportunities
to make vast improvements in
fields like education and health
care delivery" as well as the abil-

ity for rural citizens to tap into
meyor information systems with
the use of a personal computer
and modem.
Sikes outlined future goals in
the report, including increased
worldwide cultural understanding
through television, increased
electronic banking, shopping,
telecommuting and educational
developments based on satellites,
cable television and VCRs. The
Department of Commerce hopes
to establish "an electronic na
tional neighborhood," linking ur
ban and rural areas and small
and international businesses, he
said.
Sikes emphasized the need to
discard government policies that
would slow the introduction of
new services and instead allow

competition within the industry,
which has had substantial benefits
thus far.
The speech received mixed
reviews.
Ron Peat, a representative from
the Pacific Telesis Group, a parent
company of Pacific Bell, said he
was "largely disappointed" with
Sikes' presentation because it was
"terribly general, a brief over
view."
However, Erica Vener, an ac
count executive for Palo Alto's
Tycer Fultz Bellack Public Rela
tions, said Sikes' report "involved
so many different areas — tele
phone, hardware manufacturing,
cable, satellites, television, com
puters" that she didn't see "how
specific he possibly could have
been."
