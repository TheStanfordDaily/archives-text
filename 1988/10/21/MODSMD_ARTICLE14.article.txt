## Dukakis aide steps down Democratic candidate apologizes for Bush rumors 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - A Demo
cratic presidential campaign aide
resigned yesterday and Michael
Dukakis apologized to Vice Pres
ident George Bush after the aide
said the vice president "owes it to
the American people to fess up"
about a rumor that rippled
through Wall Street on Wednes
day.
The apology was issued in New
York after Donna Brazile, the Du
kakis campaign's deputy national
field director, told reporters ac
companying Dukakis to New York
that "the American people have
every right to know" if rumors
involving Bush's personal life are
true.
Dukakis campaign chair Paul
Brountas said later that Bush and
Dukakis met at the Waldorf As
toria, where both were appealing
at a dinner, and Dukakis extended
his regrets.
"He saw the vice president
tonight a little earlier and he did
apologize to the vice president,"
Brountas said. "He expressed his
regret."
Brazile "voluntarily resigned"
and regrets her remarks,
Brountas said.
"This was a personal remark
on Donna's part, solely on Don
na's part," Brountas said. "The

'[Dukakis] did

campaign had nothing to do with
it. She does not speak for the
campaign."
Brazile said in a statement an
nouncing her resignation:
"Today I made certain com
ments which I deeply regret. I be
lieve too strongly in the impor
tance of electing Mike Dukakis
and Lloyd Bentsen to allow myself
to become an issue in the cam
paign. Because the time is short,
and the issues are so important,
I have decided to leave the cam
paign."
Bush's press representative,
Sheila Tate, said, "The Bush cam

paign has no comment, no reac
tion."
The odd episode in an already
negative presidential campaign
unfolded as Dukakis worked to
overcome a Bush advantage in
pre-election polls and with Brazile
expressing frustration with the
tone of the Bush campaign.
Her initial remarks were made
to a small group of reporters after
Dukakis appearances in New Ha
ven, Conn., and Brazile elaborated
during a bus trip with reporters
traveling to New York City. She
raised the subject of the Bush
rumors in the midst of a conver
sation regarding the gender gap
and the problems of working
families.
"I wasn't on the stock market
yesterday," Brazile said at one
point, "But I understood they got
a little concerned that George was
going to the White House with
somebody other than Barbara."
"I think George Bush owes it
to the American people to fess up.
The American people have every
right to know if Barbara Bush
will share that bed with him in
the White House."
"It's important," Brazile said.
"We're not just voting for a man.
We're voting for a family. The first
family is very important."
