MANA, Nicaragua (AP) â€” Hurricane
Joan left at least 11 people dead in
Venezuela and then sent tens of thou
sands of people fleeing for safety as it
closed in on Central America yesterday
with heavy rain and 105 mph winds.
More than 37,000 people, fearing
floods and mudslides, fled coastal areas
of Nicaragua and Costa Rica.
Nicaragua declared a state of alert
and closed schools nationwide as the
slow-moving storm lurked in the Carib
bean less than 300 miles offshore.
President Daniel Ortega enacted an
emergency law banning communica
tions media from reporting unauthor
ized news about the hurricane.
In Colombia, the National Emergency
Committee said the storm killed 15
people there, injured 50, and left tens
of thousands homeless when it swept
the Gutyira peninsula on Monday.

Mudslides and heavy rain in the wake of the
hurricane left at least 11 people dead and at
least eight hurt in Caracas, Venezuela.

firefighters there said.
The mud engulfed wooden huts built
precariously on cliffs overlooking
Caracas, the capital. Rescue teams
worked through the day uncovering vic
tims, who were caught in their homes
when mud swept down.
"We uncovered 11 people, most of
them kids under 14," said Col. Antonio
Morillo, firefighter spokesman. He said
eight people were dug up alive.
Hurricane warnings were in effect
yesterday for the Colombian islands of
San Andres and neighboring Albuquer
que and Providencia. A watch was in
force on the east coasts of Nicaragua
and Costa Rica.

At 9 p.m. EDT yesterday, Joan's cen
ter was about 125 miles southeast of
San Andres and about 240 miles east
southeast of Bluefields, Nicaragua, near
latitude 11.5 north and longitude 80.2
west, said a statement from the National
Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
The hurricane was drifting westward
and was expected to continue moving
slowly in that direction overnight, the
statement said. Maximum sustained
winds were 105 mph, it said.
Bob Sheets, hurricane center director,
said the storm's slow movement made
it hard to predict, but forecasters still
expected it to strike Nicaragua or Costa
Rica today or tomorrow.
