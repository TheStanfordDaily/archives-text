# Congressional negotiators agree on tough anti-drug bill

WASHINGTON (AP) - Con
gressional negotiators agreed on
the major elements of a major
anti-drug bill yesterday, while top
House and Senate leaders met into
the night to place the finishing
touches on the measure.
The leaders have expressed
hope thst the 100 th Congress can
approve the bill today and adjourn
for the year. The legislation would
authorize some $2.5 billion in new
money and give the government
stem, new measures to combat
Â«illegal drugs.
Mindful that the legislation

could help incumbents of both
parties, leaders of both houses are
treating the bill as a bipartisan
effort.
The bill is an ambitious attempt
to deal with all aspects of the
drug problem, including law en
forcement, treatment, rehabilita
tion, education and help for au
thorities in drug-producing coun
tries.
New initiatives would include
up to $10,000 in civil fines for
those caught with personal use
amounts of drugs; a federal death
penalty for killers in drug-related

crimes; and denial of some federal
benefits to convicted drug of
fenders, including users.
While the negotiators worked
out details of the legislation, the
House Appropriations Committee
approved $500 million in new
spending for the drug bill. This
amount would pay for a barely a
third of the estimated $1.4 billion
first-year cost of the legislation.
The $500 million includes: $242
million for treatment, prevention
and education; $179 million for
new agents and equipment for
federal law enforcement agencies;

$42 million for the federal courts;
$25 million for the Coast Guard;
and the rest for programs of the
departments of state and agricul
ture, and the Food and Drug Ad
ministration.
Before the panel acted, Senate
Judiciary Committee Chair
Joseph Biden Jr., D-Del., said law
makers would be "overselling" the
bill if they passed it without
knowing how to pay for the mea
sure.
Biden, a key negotiator on law
enforcement issues, gave reporters
a flavor of the horse trading going

on behind closed doors.
He said House negotiators
prevailed over their Senate coun
terparts to drop Senate language
designed to strengthen anti
obscenity laws. The House
believed the provision gave the
federal government too much
power over what Americans can
view or read.
But in return for dropping their
anti-obscenity proposal, senators
made a strong pitch for their lan
guage on denying some federal
benefits to convicted drug of
fenders, Biden said.

Lawmakers opted to accept por
tions of the House and Senate
language on benefit denials.
Benefits such as federal public
housing, grants, contracts, loans,
mortgage guarantees, and some
forms of veterans' aid could be
lost to drug offenders. Judges
would have discretion, however,
on whether to impose the penalty
after conviction.
The president would submit a
report on the program to
Congress next May, allowing law
makers to reconsider the propos
al.
