# New hope for trapped whales

BARROW, Alaska (AP) — Fa
vorable winds yesterday buoyed
hopes for three whales trapped in
Arctic ice as two huge military
helicopters slowly dragged an
icebreaking barge from Prudhoe
Bay.
While the whales still were 200
miles away from the open water
of the Chukchi Sea, an easterly
wind was breaking leads, or path
ways, in the vast expanse of pack
ice near the whales, said Gary
Hufford of the National Weather
Service. It was pushing the ice
east and north, away from shore,
and the forecast called for east
winds and a slight warming trend
until Tuesday.
"But weather is an unpredict
able beast," Hufford said.
A satellite photograph Thurs
day showed the ice was cracking
open all over the Arctic Ocean
and Chukchi Sea, Hufford said,
but sub-zero temperatures were
quickly freezing any open water.
The animals were trapped
about 100 yards off the desolate
Arctic Ocean coast about two
weeks ago by bitter cold and the
constantly shilling ice pack. They
have been breathing through
small air holes about 18 miles
northeast of this Inupiat Eskimo
village.
While biologists earlier worried
that the animals were fading, they
said the giant mammals' respira
tion rates have stabilized.
"You can set your watch by

them every 10 minutes," said
Craig George, a North Slope
Borough biologist.
Biologists named the whales
Bonnet, Crossbeak and Bone —
the latter having much of its
snout scraped away by the ice.
Eskimos have given them their
own names: Siku (Ice), Putu
(Icehole) and Kanik (Snowflake).
The whales were at least three
miles from the nearest lead, and
whether they would make it to
open water was uncertain.
"Whether they will be able to

navigate lead-to-lead to get to the
open water, I don't know," said
Ted Meyers, National Marine
Fisheries Service chief of habitat
conservation in Alaska. "They
must go through areas of ice for
some distance before they reach
open sea."
At the Prudhoe Bay oil fields,
a huge Army National Guard
Skycrane helicopter lifted off after
first light and prepared to hook
onto the 185-ton barge and begin
the 230-mile journey to the
whales.
