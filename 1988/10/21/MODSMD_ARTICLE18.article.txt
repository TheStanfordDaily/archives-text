Britain revokes right to silence
LONDON (AP) — The British government in
troduced legislation yesterday to abolish the right
of suspects in Northern Ireland to remain silent
under police questioning, ending a centuries-old
pillar of British jurisprudence.
The latest measure in Britain's crackdown on
the Irish Republican Army provoked renewed out
cries that historic civil liberties are crumbling in
Britain and followed Wednesday's government
ban on broadcast interviews with members of
the outlawed IRA and 10 other militant groups
in Northern Ireland.
In the House of Commons, the government of
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher put forward
legislation to end the right to silence in Northern
Ireland, and said it also planned to introduce
similar restrictions in England and Wales. The
measure is expected to become law by January
"Members of terrorist organizations are being
trained to refuse to respond to questions put by
the police — and this technique is increasingly
being adopted by those suspected of serious
crimes, including racketeering," Northern Ireland
Secretary Tom King said.
"Justice is being thwarted," he said.
At present, courts are not allowed to take into
consideration that a suspect refused to answer
police questions.
Soviet cosmonauts fix telescope
MOSCOW (AP) — Two cosmonauts spent more
than four hours outside the Mir orbital platform
yesterday to replace a faulty component on an
X-ray telescope, a task they failed to accomplish
earlier this year, Tass reported.
Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov used new

tools recently brought to their space station by
a Progress cargo rocket to remove a detector
that had been developed by British and Dutch
scientists for the telescope, the official news
agency said.
Components of the unit melted because of ex
posure to cosmic radiation, Radio Moscow re
ported. Tass said Titov and Manarov replaced
the part with an "upgraded detector" that would
help prolong the life of the telescope.
On June 30, Titov and Manarov tried unsuc
cessfully to replace the damaged unit of the tele
scope, which is mounted on an observatory
module called Kvant attached to the Mir. But
the cosmonauts at that time couldn't unfasten
the clasp holding the detector to the telescope.
In yesterday's spacewalk, which Tass said
lasted four hours and 12 minutes, Titov and
Manarov wore new spacesuits designed to allow
the cosmonauts more flexibility, Soviet TV re
ported.
Mass extinction caused by comet
LOS ANGELES (AP) — A comet striking Earth
with the power of 300 million Hiroshima-sized
atomic bombs may be the cause of mass extinction
11 million years ago, say scientists who blame a
bigger blast for killing the dinosaurs eons earlier.
The scientists' new study means that of nine
mass extinction episodes in Earth's history, three
that occurred about 11 million, 38 million and
66 million years ago now have been linked to
comets or asteroids smacking into the planet.
The highlv controversial theory says such im
pacts kicked up dust and triggered smoky fires
that blocked enough sunlight to freeze many
creatures and deprive others of food supplies.
