Students signed up for Stanford's
spring quarter program in Kyoto,
Japan, will have to wait until April 1990
to study at the center, Deputy Director
of Overseas Studies Corb Smith con
firmed yesterday.
Hoping to open the Kyoto program
by spring of this year, Overseas Studies
officials said complications in leasing
and financing forced them to postpone
the opening until next year.
For about three years now, the Uni
versity has hoped to establish an Amer
ican campus in Japan. While there are
several college exchange programs

which allow American college students
to attend Japanese universities, Stan
ford's Kyoto center would be the first
foreign college of its kind.
"No one has tried to set up a foreign
education center in Japan which is au
tonomous of Japanese universities be
fore," explained Thomas Heller, director
of Overseas Studies. "The ambition of
this project is something never done
before," he said.
Heller pointed out that the negotiat
ing process with the Japanese is slow
going because Stanford is setting a
precedent by establishing a foreign
campus on Japanese soil.
While Heller said Stanford has gotten

the project off the ground much quicker
than was expected, complications over
the past two years have delayed the
center's actual opening.
Last June, Overseas Studies accepted
30 students to the Stanford in Kyoto
program. However, officials told the stu
dents in August that the center would
not open during the '88-'B9 school year.
Construction of the center has not
yet begun. Leasing arrangements are in
the final negotiating stage. Stanford is
still raising money for the center.
"Construction should begin after the
first of [1989,] "and leasing arrange-
ments still have to be finalized,"
Smith said.
He added that he is 95 percent
certain that the center will open
by September of 1989 and that
Stanford students can enroll for
classes by April of 1990.
"We can never assure that it
can't fall through," Smith ex
plained. "... All of our informa
tion now tells us that we'll be
able to operate in 1990."
Heller said, "We have every in
tention with greeting people in
Kyoto next year."
Smith pointed out that all stu
dents accepted for this spring's
program are guaranteed a spot
for next year. The number of
spaces available to new applicants
is contingent upon the number of
this year's acceptees still wanting
to go next spring.
While the center is scheduled
to open within the next year-and
a-half, some students expressed
disappointment about not being
able to study there this year.
Junior Sarie Okimoto, a student
accepted to the Kyoto program
for this spring, said she was op
timistic about the center opening
on time.
"We were warned when we
turned in the application that
they weren't guaranteeing the
opening of the program, but I still
expected to go," Okimoto said.
"If I go [next spring,] I'm going
to miss my graduation."
Okimoto also expressed con
cerned about finding a post
graduation job if she were away

for the spring quarter of her
senior year. "It's going to be hard
for me if I'm going to get a job,"
she said.
Junior Mary Yang, who was
also accepted into the program,
said she is unsure whether she
will study at the campus next
spring.
"Right now we have three op
tions," explained Yang. "We can
completely withdraw; we can go
for a summer internship (without
classes); or we can be put on the
list for [next] spring."
While Yang is leaning towards
attending the program next
spring, Okimoto said she plans to
apply for a summer internship
program in Japan that Stanford
is coordinating.
However, Stanford cannot
guarantee that every student will
obtain an internship because
Japanese firms do the hiring.
