Stanford shouldn't
advertise something
that it can't deliver

STOP with the teasing.
Like a carrot dangling in
front of a donkey's mouth,
the Stanford overseas center in
Kyoto is still nothing more than
a temptation.
Last year, the University signed
up at least 20 students interested
in the Kyoto program â€” then
postponed the trip.
The University should not
arouse students' hopes only to dis
appoint them later.
Due to complications in leasing
and financing, the Kyoto center,
scheduled to open this spring, will
not open until September of 1989.
Understandably, problems can
arise, but the University should
have made it known, loud and
clear, how tentative the program
really was.
A lease has not yet been
finalized. Construction will not
begin until early in 1989.
Officials at Overseas Studies say
there was a disclaimer on the
Kyoto application that warned stu
dents not to put all their eggs in
one basket and count on going to
Japan. They say the spring pro
gram was not a 100-percent guar
antee.
The University has suggested
that these students apply for sum
mer internships in Japan. But a

summer job is not an adequate
alternative to an academic experi
ence.
And there is no guarantee that
Japanese companies will employ all
the students who were accepted to
the Kyoto program. Even if stu
dents do find internships, they will
not receive academic credit for the
work they do.
For graduating seniors, a sum
mer internship is not necessarily
a feasible solution. Come gradua
tion, students feel they need to
start looking for a long-term job,
not an internship.
If the University is committed
to making amends, then an alter
native college program must be
sought out. And the University
should do its best to insure that
all students who were accepted to
Stanford's program find an equally
strong academic program for this
spring.
Even now, a statement in the
Overseas Studies brochure prom
ises that the Kyoto center "will
open in the fall of 1989." But an
official from Overseas Studies ad
mitted that they cannot be 100
percent certain that the campus
will open in the fall. The official
went on to admit that a disclaimer
should be added on to the end of
the statement.
Once negotiations are finalized
with the Japanese, Stanford will
have the first U.S. center in Japan.
Such an effort deserves praise. But
hold off on the applause until stu
dents are treated with more cour
tesy.
