Fasten your elbows to your
ribcage. Keep your hands, palm
facing palm, exactly six inches apart
and chop away, as if slicing at a large
loaf of bread, on each stressed syllable.
Squint. Give that grimacing sneer of
superiority. Above all, be sure you slightly
but continuously wag your head, as if
not quite believing all you say.
Okay. You're ready. Try this one.
"Now, I'm the kind of guy who believes
.. . ah . . . that always starting my sen
tences with Now, I'm the kind of guy
and ending with is all about ... ah ...
is what boring campaigning is all about."
Did you do it right? Look around at
your friends. Are they still awake? Then
you need more practice.
Four years ago, many of today's college
students were firmly tuned in to the
Mondale-Reagan contest and formed def
inite, informed preferences. But their
youth prevented them from casting bal
lots.
In 1988, they have again paid close
attention to the soporific battle between
Michael Stanley and George Herbert
Walker. They've watched a debate or
three. Argued about their vote with their
parents and comrades. And again, they
now have a definite preference.
Neither one.
Typically they consider themselves
liberal Republicans or conservative Dem
ocrats. They like Bush on many aspects

of economic and foreign policy, but vastly
prefer Dukakis on social policy. For these
voters, the Informedly Undecideds, a pair
of issues may break the tie in Dukakis'
favor.
Quayle. Ordinarily vice- presidents at
tend foreign funerals, cut ribbons, and
wait for presidents to die, a job "not
worth a pitcher of warm s(p)it," as FDR's
first VP, John Nance Garner, so elo
quently phrased it.
But this time, something went wrong.
Vice-presidential nominees should be the
ideological and geographical glue that
holds the ticket together. Yankee liberal
Dukakis correctly picked the more con
servative Texan, Bentsen.
Bush was supposed to pick a liberal,
like New Jersey Governor Tom Kean. Or
a respected statesman and rival, like Bob
Dole.
But nooooo. George decided he was
going to make his own decision. Sadly,
J. Danforth Quayle simply does not mea
sure up to even vice-presidential stand
ards. Don't deny it, you conservatives
v out there; deep down, you know you'd
rather have Bentsen take over for Duka
kis than have Danny boy fill in for Bush.
So would the Undecideds.
The Supreme Court. Three Justices
are over 80. They happen to be the three
most liberal members of the Court: Thur
good Marshall, Harry Blackmun, and Bill
Brennan. The next president will likely
replace them. And so the question arises
for Undecideds: am I reasonably satisfied
with the Court's current direction, or do
I want a change?

As might be expected of card-carrying
centrists, these undecided voters gener
ally agree with the Court's decisions.
They don't favor much ideological shift
in the years ahead. And so they must
vote for Dukakis.
Dukakis cannot but keep the Court
where it now stands. By replacing these
outgoing Justices with three solid
liberals, he won't have tilted the scales
in the least. (One possible chance for
Dukakis to pull the Court leftwards may
come along after all: moderate conserva
tive Justice Byron White has hinted at
his possible retirement, though that in
fact may be contingent upon a Bush elec
tion.)
But Bush will shift the Court's delicate
balance in favor of conservatives. He
needn't do so by appointing Scalias or
Rehnquists; he can appoint soft conser
vatives like Sandra Day O'Connor and
still achieve the same end.
The issues of Quayle and Court may
shift the centrists to the same Dukakis
they love to ape, palm facing palm.
They'll have to learn to do George Bush,
too — but then, they'll have four long
years to learn.

Typically they consider themselves
liberal Republicans or conservative Dem
ocrats. They like Bush on many aspects

of economic and foreign policy, but vastly
prefer Dukakis on social policy. For these
voters, the Informedly Undecideds, a pair
of issues may break the tie in Dukakis'
favor.
Quayle. Ordinarily vice- presidents at
tend foreign funerals, cut ribbons, and
wait for presidents to die, a job "not
worth a pitcher of warm s(p)it," as FDR's
first VP, John Nance Garner, so elo
quently phrased it.
But this time, something went wrong.
Vice-presidential nominees should be the
ideological and geographical glue that
holds the ticket together. Yankee liberal
Dukakis correctly picked the more con
servative Texan, Bentsen.
Bush was supposed to pick a liberal,
like New Jersey Governor Tom Kean. Or
a respected statesman and rival, like Bob
Dole.
But nooooo. George decided he was
going to make his own decision. Sadly,
J. Danforth Quayle simply does not mea
sure up to even vice-presidential stand
ards. Don't deny it, you conservatives
v out there; deep down, you know you'd
rather have Bentsen take over for Duka
kis than have Danny boy fill in for Bush.
So would the Undecideds.
The Supreme Court. Three Justices
are over 80. They happen to be the three
most liberal members of the Court: Thur
good Marshall, Harry Blackmun, and Bill
Brennan. The next president will likely
replace them. And so the question arises
for Undecideds: am I reasonably satisfied
with the Court's current direction, or do
I want a change?

As might be expected of card-carrying
centrists, these undecided voters gener
ally agree with the Court's decisions.
They don't favor much ideological shift
in the years ahead. And so they must
vote for Dukakis.
Dukakis cannot but keep the Court
where it now stands. By replacing these
outgoing Justices with three solid
liberals, he won't have tilted the scales
in the least. (One possible chance for
Dukakis to pull the Court leftwards may
come along after all: moderate conserva
tive Justice Byron White has hinted at
his possible retirement, though that in
fact may be contingent upon a Bush elec
tion.)
But Bush will shift the Court's delicate
balance in favor of conservatives. He
needn't do so by appointing Scalias or
Rehnquists; he can appoint soft conser
vatives like Sandra Day O'Connor and
still achieve the same end.
The issues of Quayle and Court may
shift the centrists to the same Dukakis
they love to ape, palm facing palm.
They'll have to learn to do George Bush,
too — but then, they'll have four long
years to learn.
