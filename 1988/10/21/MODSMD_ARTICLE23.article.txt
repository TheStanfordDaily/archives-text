## Dean used 'linguistic trick' in negotiation analysis 
### 
Dean lyon's attempt to
provide a "context" for under
standing the negotiations be
tween the USW and the administration
is based on a deliberate distortion of
the facts to bias the students against
the union and against a strike as a
possible tactic of the union.
He contrasts the union's objective —
"to achieve the best deal they can
make for their members" — with the
administration's bargaining team's
objective of achieving "the balances
that are fair and reasonable for the
whole University."
George Orwell would note and con
demn the Dean's slippery linguistic
trick of defining the union and its
members as not part of the University

and turning the administration's nego
tiators into saints.
As egregiously, Lyons tries to
frighten students by saying that higher
wages "may mean higher tuition and
fees." That may be a consequence of
seeking economic justice for the
workers, but as plausible an alternative
would be a freeze on the salaries of
Lyons and the administration's huge
legal staff, some of whom are at the
heart of the stalled negotiations.
Lyons goes on to attack strikes
because students "will be greatly incon
venienced" by them, even claiming that
some will have "their academic and
other routines altered or cut back."
I was a Resident Fellow in Trancos
when the USW struck in the fall of

1982. I do not recall any alteration in
"academic routine," and I challenge
Lyons to name one. The students
experienced the inconvenience of having
to find alternatives to Food Service
and by not having their dorms cleaned,
but they did not starve and they did
not get buried in garbage.
They did learn about the bad pay of
Food Service workers and the people
who cleaned up after them. But that is
knowledge of the "real world," which
Residential Education, ultimately
headed by Lyons, enjoins upon all
students.
The strike did not "create ir
reparable differences that make work
ing together after the fact difficult or
impossible," at least not between the

strikers and the students.
That scare-tactic of Lyons is simply
the last in a long catalogue of mis
representations designed by a company
man to deter students from sympathiz
ing with the workers and to urge them
to remain "neutral."
If the Dean wants to provide a
relatively "neutral" context for the
negotiations, he should temporarily
shed his role as the tool of the admin
istration and write as the good human
being I know him to be. Then the The
Daily could properly headline his letter:
"Dean Lyons places union negotiations
in context."
