# AIDS virus analogy to computer illness was inappropriate
## 
### 
Let me quote for you the eighth
paragraph from The Daily's Oct. 14
article, "Computer virus infects a num
ber of campus Macintoshes":
"Viruses have only recently affected
the computer world, causing a scare
that experts have compared to the
AIDS epidemic."
While I understand the kind of anal
ogy that The Daily wanted to draw, it
is an outrageous statement. Victims of
AIDS are human beings, not comput
ers.
Anyone who feels that a computer
virus can cause a scare that can be
compared to the AIDS epidemic has
forgotten the most basic differences
between machines and human beings.
I am sorrv, but no matter what ex

perts say, no computer virus will ever
scare me like the AIDS epidemic does
Computers can be easily replaced.
Human beings can not.
