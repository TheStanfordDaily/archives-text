# Hysterical response does a disservice to minority students
## 
### 
I cannot help but feel that Stanford
is doing a great disservice to its minor
ity students. Jumping through hoops
every time a racist incident occurs is
not going to help prepare black stu
dents for car trouble in Howard Beach.
I mean really, if two drunk eighteen
year-olds can reduce an entire dor
mitory to "hysteria" and "wretching,"
how are Stanford's black students
going to deal with a car full of
drunken rednecks?

The hysteria in response to the
defaced Beethoven poster is typical of
the rantings I've become accustomed to
over the past four years. The Daily has
printed letters calling for the expulsion
of Dugan anfir Heldt: an absolutely
absurd demand.
At worst they're guilty of criminal
stupidity, whereas B.J. Kerr is appar
ently guilty of assault. I realize that
last year's computer thefts at the book
store firmly established the precedent
that felonies are not violations of the
fundamental standard. Surely the no
tion of fair play calls for letting Dugan
and Heldt slide on this one.
I suspect that they'll handle race
issues like newly minted plutonium in
the future and that they're really un
likely to be the cause of any more
distress to minorities.
Unlike black students at Stanford,
they will have well and truly learned
how to deal with racism in the real
world.
