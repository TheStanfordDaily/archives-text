# Ignorance no longer a valid excuse for blatant racial acts
## 
### 
I am a white female freshman living
in Ujamaa House's B-wing. Ujamaa is
my home and sanctuary. I left racism
back home in northeast Omaha, Neb.,
back where ignorant people abound.
I refuse to pay $20,000 to watch my
friends be hurt, and to see my home
violated. Every time you make a racial
slur, you hurt me deeply. I call into
account every member of the Univer
sity system. The Ujamaa incident impl
icates all of us because we are the
system.
This is the message I want to convey
about racism: Ignorance is an excuse
that just won't cut it anymore, people.
