Last year's party
in the Quad was as
good as this year's
I am writing in response to the Oct.
4 editorial ("Let's all celebrate"). The
editorial portrays last year's Orienta
tion week party as a "big flop" and
"all-campus fiasco" and finds numer
ous examples to support its claim. I, as
one of the organizers of that event,
would like to set the record straight.
The Daily claims that about 1,000
people "wandered in and out" of the
event. I don't know if you've been to
the Quad recently, but it holds a lot
more than 1,000 people when it's full.
And full it was. Over 4,000 students
attended that event. In fact, a survey
conducted by Tresidder later that year
showed overwhelmingly that the all
campus party had the biggest audience
for all of the Concert Network shows
that year!
The Daily noted that this year's
party was non-alcoholic and had com
edians. W9II guess what — so did last
year's party.
Last year's party served as a
breakthrough for future all-campus
parties in numerous ways. First, be
cause of security and other factors,
all-campus parties had begun to
dwindle over the years (the elimination
of the Donner Street Dance is only one
example).
Furthermore, the University was
very sensitive to the topic of parties

because there was the drowning
tragedy of a student at a rush party
during the spring of 1987.
When the other organizers and I
decided to put on an all-campus party,
we realized we had a great deal of
responsibility. If we failed, the Univer
sity probably would not allow any
more all-campus outdoor parties. If the
the party went well, there would be
the possibility of more all-campus par
ties to come. The results speak for
themselves.
We put on a safe, fun event that was
attended by thousands. Because of the
success of that event it became im
mensely easier for others to put on
all-campus parties. And others, such as
the Axe Committee, followed our lead
last year and held more all-campus
parties.
It was also a milestone for the
ASSU because for the first time in
many years, the ASSU broke out of its
image as a self-serving bureaucracy.
Also, there had been numerous criti
cisms that we could not get the big
names to come to campus to play (and
big names are what students wanted to
see). Those criticisms were silenced.
Why was a big name band chosen
last year? Because, to put it simply,
that's what students wanted then, and
that's what they want now. I also take
my hat off to the organizers for choos
ing in The Daily's words, "bands with
a multicultural flair." I'm sure it
suited someone's political and/or social
agenda.

University officials
not taking active
role against racism
Here we are again. Another
racist/bigoted incident at Stanford. As
is the custom, this latest incident has
elicited a stereotyped response on the
part of University officials. The official
handwringing starts at the top and
works its way down.
One after another, officers repeat
the standardized litany, making sure to
use words like "shock", "dismay" and
"unacceptable". They all profess to be
"surprised" something like this could
"happen at Stanford". A few even have
the chutzpah to be chagrined. Please.
Then, administrators give some
variation on the "We're making prog
ress — Rome wasn't built in a day"
speech and there are calls for an "in
vestigation".
Perhaps the fact that University
officals all hail from the most
privileged echelons of American society
has something to do with the lack of
urgency they feel about dealing with
these "incidents".
Undoubtedly — also in keeping with
tradition — the "investigation" will
stretch over several months to allow
enough time for "emotions" to die
down. Then an official "report" will be
issued which will "disapprove" of the
offending actions, but take no real
disciplinary measures.
The report will conclude "we can all
learn from the unfortunate experi-

ence". Spare me. Spare all of us.
This university brings together
people of diverse ethnic backgrounds
and sequesters them in an environment
which is entirely msyority culture.
This kind of existence is inherently
uneasy, insecure and problematic. It
requires a public renunciation of one's
own culture and a capitulation to that
of the mtyority.
Minority cultures are banished to
designated "days" or "weeks" which
effectively relegate them to the status
and importance of an exhibit or a trip
to the zoo. Meanwhile, University offi
cials labor under the delusion "no
news is good news" until another "inci
dent" occurs and the cycle repeats it
self.
I suggest we forego the lip service
usually paid at this time to brother
hood, equality and racial harmony.
Unless and until this university takes
an active role in combating racism,
sexism and bigotry, and addresses
these issues in an institutional way, all
its protestations are just so much hy
pocrisy and wasted wind.
Stanford flatters itself that it is
training the future leaders of this na
tion. How is it then that this univer
sity refuses to directly address some of
the most enduring, costly and destruc
tive issues in American society? How
can Stanford claim to educate leaders
when it allows ignorance, misconcep
tions and heresy to go unchallanged
and unchecked?
I submit, in refusing to address the
problem, Stanford has become part of
the problem; because failure to ac
knowledge and/or redress a problem

implies there is no problem. University
officals sit smug in their ethnocentric
conceit and claim the dearth of minor
ity faculty and lack of ethnic education
requirements present no problem.
Yet these "incidents" pop up with
disturbing regularity, serving as
reminders that there most defintely is
a problem.
A moment of personal revelation
came to me a few years ago when I
realized that despite my sensitization
to racism and its effects, and not
withstanding my parents having taught
my brothers and me that men and
women are equal and there was no
such thing as "women's work", I still
held sexist notions.
I had these notions because America
is a profoundly sexist society and these
notions had been instilled in me un
conciously. I came to understand that
ridding myself of them required effort.
I've learned that I must actively exam
ine myself to ferret out sexist ideas
and replace them with truth obtained
through candid and frank discussion.
Likewise, America is also profoundly
and doggedly racist. Racism permeates
our society in both subtle ane overt
ways. Anyone who imagines he or she
could grow up in America and not hold
racist notions is simply foolish. They
will not just disappear. They must be
exorcised through effort and sup
planted with truth.
Stanford University has a respon
siblity and an obligation to its students
and faculty to provide direction and
leadership in this process. There is no
excuse for doing otherwise.

University officials
not taking active
role against racism
Here we are again. Another
racist/bigoted incident at Stanford. As
is the custom, this latest incident has
elicited a stereotyped response on the
part of University officials. The official
handwringing starts at the top and
works its way down.
One after another, officers repeat
the standardized litany, making sure to
use words like "shock", "dismay" and
"unacceptable". They all profess to be
"surprised" something like this could
"happen at Stanford". A few even have
the chutzpah to be chagrined. Please.
Then, administrators give some
variation on the "We're making prog
ress — Rome wasn't built in a day"
speech and there are calls for an "in
vestigation".
Perhaps the fact that University
officals all hail from the most
privileged echelons of American society
has something to do with the lack of
urgency they feel about dealing with
these "incidents".
Undoubtedly — also in keeping with
tradition — the "investigation" will
stretch over several months to allow
enough time for "emotions" to die
down. Then an official "report" will be
issued which will "disapprove" of the
offending actions, but take no real
disciplinary measures.
The report will conclude "we can all
learn from the unfortunate experi-

ence". Spare me. Spare all of us.
This university brings together
people of diverse ethnic backgrounds
and sequesters them in an environment
which is entirely msyority culture.
This kind of existence is inherently
uneasy, insecure and problematic. It
requires a public renunciation of one's
own culture and a capitulation to that
of the mtyority.
Minority cultures are banished to
designated "days" or "weeks" which
effectively relegate them to the status
and importance of an exhibit or a trip
to the zoo. Meanwhile, University offi
cials labor under the delusion "no
news is good news" until another "inci
dent" occurs and the cycle repeats it
self.
I suggest we forego the lip service
usually paid at this time to brother
hood, equality and racial harmony.
Unless and until this university takes
an active role in combating racism,
sexism and bigotry, and addresses
these issues in an institutional way, all
its protestations are just so much hy
pocrisy and wasted wind.
Stanford flatters itself that it is
training the future leaders of this na
tion. How is it then that this univer
sity refuses to directly address some of
the most enduring, costly and destruc
tive issues in American society? How
can Stanford claim to educate leaders
when it allows ignorance, misconcep
tions and heresy to go unchallanged
and unchecked?
I submit, in refusing to address the
problem, Stanford has become part of
the problem; because failure to ac
knowledge and/or redress a problem

implies there is no problem. University
officals sit smug in their ethnocentric
conceit and claim the dearth of minor
ity faculty and lack of ethnic education
requirements present no problem.
Yet these "incidents" pop up with
disturbing regularity, serving as
reminders that there most defintely is
a problem.
A moment of personal revelation
came to me a few years ago when I
realized that despite my sensitization
to racism and its effects, and not
withstanding my parents having taught
my brothers and me that men and
women are equal and there was no
such thing as "women's work", I still
held sexist notions.
I had these notions because America
is a profoundly sexist society and these
notions had been instilled in me un
conciously. I came to understand that
ridding myself of them required effort.
I've learned that I must actively exam
ine myself to ferret out sexist ideas
and replace them with truth obtained
through candid and frank discussion.
Likewise, America is also profoundly
and doggedly racist. Racism permeates
our society in both subtle ane overt
ways. Anyone who imagines he or she
could grow up in America and not hold
racist notions is simply foolish. They
will not just disappear. They must be
exorcised through effort and sup
planted with truth.
Stanford University has a respon
siblity and an obligation to its students
and faculty to provide direction and
leadership in this process. There is no
excuse for doing otherwise.

Last year's party
in the Quad was as
good as this year's
I am writing in response to the Oct.
4 editorial ("Let's all celebrate"). The
editorial portrays last year's Orienta
tion week party as a "big flop" and
"all-campus fiasco" and finds numer
ous examples to support its claim. I, as
one of the organizers of that event,
would like to set the record straight.
The Daily claims that about 1,000
people "wandered in and out" of the
event. I don't know if you've been to
the Quad recently, but it holds a lot
more than 1,000 people when it's full.
And full it was. Over 4,000 students
attended that event. In fact, a survey
conducted by Tresidder later that year
showed overwhelmingly that the all
campus party had the biggest audience
for all of the Concert Network shows
that year!
The Daily noted that this year's
party was non-alcoholic and had com
edians. W9II guess what — so did last
year's party.
Last year's party served as a
breakthrough for future all-campus
parties in numerous ways. First, be
cause of security and other factors,
all-campus parties had begun to
dwindle over the years (the elimination
of the Donner Street Dance is only one
example).
Furthermore, the University was
very sensitive to the topic of parties

because there was the drowning
tragedy of a student at a rush party
during the spring of 1987.
When the other organizers and I
decided to put on an all-campus party,
we realized we had a great deal of
responsibility. If we failed, the Univer
sity probably would not allow any
more all-campus outdoor parties. If the
the party went well, there would be
the possibility of more all-campus par
ties to come. The results speak for
themselves.
We put on a safe, fun event that was
attended by thousands. Because of the
success of that event it became im
mensely easier for others to put on
all-campus parties. And others, such as
the Axe Committee, followed our lead
last year and held more all-campus
parties.
It was also a milestone for the
ASSU because for the first time in
many years, the ASSU broke out of its
image as a self-serving bureaucracy.
Also, there had been numerous criti
cisms that we could not get the big
names to come to campus to play (and
big names are what students wanted to
see). Those criticisms were silenced.
Why was a big name band chosen
last year? Because, to put it simply,
that's what students wanted then, and
that's what they want now. I also take
my hat off to the organizers for choos
ing in The Daily's words, "bands with
a multicultural flair." I'm sure it
suited someone's political and/or social
