# Ex-Stanford prof. gets physics Nobel
## 
### Jock Friedly Staff writer 
The 1988 Nobel Prize for Physics was
awarded this week to former Stanford
professor Melvin Schwartz for an ex
periment he performed 26 years ago to
help understand the "weak" force in an
atom's nucleus.
Schwartz shared the $390,000 Nobel
prize, the most prestigious Prize in sci
ence, with two colleagues for creating
the first beam of neutrinos that could
probe the nucleus for the "weak" force,
one of the four fundamental forces of

nature that govern interaction of nu
clear particles.
Leon Lederman, director of Chicago's
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory,
and Jack Steinberger of the European
Center for Nuclear Research in Geneva
shared the prize for their research with
him.
"Many people have felt that this is a
prize that ought to have been given,"
Stanford Physics Department Chair Al
exander Fetter said of the long-delayed
awarding of the prize to Schwartz.
"It doesn't feel bad," Schwartz said
about the award, which honored his

landmark research in 1962. "I thought
it would have come after four or five
years," but never expected to get it after
waiting so long, he said.
Schwartz at Stanford
Schwartz received his entire college
education at Columbia University after
graduating from the Bronx High School
of Science, which graduated three other
Nobel Prize winners within five years.
Schwartz taught eight years at Colum
bia before going to Stanford.
A particle physicist attracted by
the impressive research machin
ery of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center, Schwartz taught
in the Stanford Physics Depart
ment as a full professor from 1966
to 1979 while he researched at
SLAC. In his last year in
academia, Schwartz received a
dean's award for teaching.
Schwartz left Stanford in 1979
to create his own company, Digital
Pathways, Inc. in Mountain View.
He is currently the company's
chief executive officer.
He left physics, he said, because
he was frustrated by the enor
mous number of scientists needed
for particle physics research, in
which dozens of physicists might
share the credit for each experi
ment. Schwartz said he entered
Silicon Valley's booming industry
because "you get a sense of the
incredible dynamism of the
electronics industry."
Nobel winners Schwartz, Leder
man and Steinberger were profes
sors at Columbia University and
researchers at the nearby Brook
haven National Laboratory when
the Nobel discovery was made.
Details about the discovery
Schwartz's discovery advanced
theory about the "weak" force,
one of the four basic forces along
with gravity, electromagnetism
and the "strong" nuclear force.
In 1960, Schwartz first suggested
probing interactions caused by the
weak force by using a beam of
neutrinos — particles of negligible

mass detected only years before
that are not significantly affected
by the other forces, but can be
affected by the weak force.
Because neutrinos are so unaf
fected by forces other than the
weak force, they can travel
through over 100 million miles of
lead without even interacting with
any lead atoms. This property
makes them extremely difficult to
study, and also very difficult to
manipulate into a beam.
In 1962, Schwartz created a
beam of neutrinos by slamming
high energy protons — charged
particles in the atom's nucleus —
into a target made of the element
beryllium. Upon striking the
beryllium, the protons caused a
great deal of nuclear "junk", in
cluding particles such as protons,
neutrons and pions.
The pion is highly unstable and
decays in a few billionths of a
second into neutrinos and other
particles called muons. The essen
tial question that the researchers
needed to answer was whether
this neutrino, paired with the
muon in a pion decay, was the
same as the neutrino that was
paired with the electron in other
particle decays.
To answer this question,
Schwartz and his colleagues
needed to sift through this spray
of junk to leave only neutrinos.
To do this, they used 40 feet of
solid steel from junked naval
cruisers to stop all of the particles
except the slippery neutrino,
which doesn't interact well with
matter.
Sifting through junk
By sifting out the nuclear
debris, the first high-intensity

beam of pure neutrinos was
created. The physicists attempted
to detect the interaction of this
beam of high-energy neutrinos
with the weak force.
The beam hit a detector that
was made of a series of aluminum
plates, one inch thick and four
feet square. The 10 tons of alu
minum plate were bombarded by
millions of neutrinos from the
proton collision each second, but
because neutrinos aren't affected
much by matter, only about one
interaction was detected each day
the experiment ran.
From calculations made about
the neutrino events, the research
ers discovered that a new kind of
neutrino was coming from a pion
decaying into a muon and a
neutrino. This was termed the
"muon-neutrino", which seemed
to be created when a muon is
made. In the same way, neutrinos
that are products with electrons
in other particle decays are called
"electron-neutrinos."
The 1962 experiment was a
landmark finding for the physics
community, which by analogy
with neutrinos led to the predic
tion of two kinds of quarks.
Quarks, discovered at Stanford 20
years ago, are the most funda
mental of all known particles.
