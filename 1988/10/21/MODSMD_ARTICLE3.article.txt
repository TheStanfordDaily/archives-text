### Jock Friedly Staff writer 
The 1988 Nobel Prize for Physics was
awarded this week to former Stanford
professor Melvin Schwartz for an ex
periment he performed 26 years ago to
help understand the "weak" force in an
atom's nucleus.
Schwartz shared the $390,000 Nobel
prize, the most prestigious Prize in sci
ence, with two colleagues for creating
the first beam of neutrinos that could
probe the nucleus for the "weak" force,
one of the four fundamental forces of

nature that govern interaction of nu
clear particles.
Leon Lederman, director of Chicago's
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory,
and Jack Steinberger of the European
Center for Nuclear Research in Geneva
shared the prize for their research with
him.
"Many people have felt that this is a
prize that ought to have been given,"
Stanford Physics Department Chair Al
exander Fetter said of the long-delayed
awarding of the prize to Schwartz.
"It doesn't feel bad," Schwartz said
about the award, which honored his

landmark research in 1962. "I thought
it would have come after four or five
years," but never expected to get it after
waiting so long, he said.
Schwartz at Stanford
Schwartz received his entire college
education at Columbia University after
graduating from the Bronx High School
of Science, which graduated three other
Nobel Prize winners within five years.
Schwartz taught eight years at Colum
bia before going to Stanford.
