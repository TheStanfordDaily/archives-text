## Stanford's first spring in Poland finds both unrest and hospitality Life in Krakow teaches lessons about strikes, survival 
### Kathy Toy 
From Solidarity to hunting for cheese,
Stanford students studying at the over
seas center in Poland last spring spent
much of their time on the streets of
Krakow, instead of in the library.
• Associated with the Jagellonian Uni
versity in Krakow, the 16 students lived
tn Dom Piast, a dormitory that houses
both Stanford and Polish students.
• According to Dr. Jacek Wasilewski, a
Jagiellonian professor who worked with
(he Stanford program, the program is
designed, "/.. not on*y for those inter
ested in Poland and Eastern Europe, but
also the USSR and Germany." Jagiel
lonian is qurrently a visiting professor at
Stanford.
A special team of Jagiellonian profes
sors instructed the Stanford students in
courses relating to Polish language, cul
ture, society and politics. Although the
courses were taught in English, they were
far from easy.
Jane Sanborn, who served as a theme
associate and resident assistant for Stan
ford students in the Polish dormitory,
said the Polish professors made no al
lowances tor the students' short acquaint
ance witH Polish life. "The professors
weren't easy on them because they were
American," she said.

Weathering rigorous academics has be
come trademark of Stanford students.
Wasilewski pointed out that in compari
son to his Polish students, "Stanford stu
dents are much more hard-working and
responsible."
"The students had the pressures of a
real Stanford quarter with added diffi
culties," Sanborn added. However, the
students seemed to agree that it was these
"added difficulties" which made their ed
ucation unique.
"At the other centers you can be a
tourist, but in Poland you .. . (are)
merged in the society. The fact that Stan
ford offers this is so amazing. You get
to live behind the Iron Curtain for three
months," said David Levine, one of the
students that attended the Poland pro
gram.
Although they were given stipends to
use in restaurants or the marketplace,
the students had to forage for themselves
when it was mealtime. "The students
really had to work at surviving. We'd
share cheese stories. Someone would say,
'I've checked five stores and there isn't
any cheese in Krakow,' Sanborn said.
"Another day someone might come in
and say, 'There's tons of cheese at the
shop next door!' and five people would
run right out and find that it was all
gone."
Levine stressed how different every day
life is in Poland. "The Poles spend their
time basically trying to stay alive. We
spend most of our time trying to succeed,
especially Stanford students, worrying
about our next job and how much money
we'll make. The Poles need to worry
about where to find cheese," he said.
"The program is really able to pull you
into a completely different economic sys
tem and (show) its effects on daily living
in society," Sanborn added.
Wasilewski explained that the program
was designed to give equal importance
to learning by experience, in the form of
field trips and meeting with people, as
to readings and class discussions.
"We tried to keep them as close to
everyday life as possible, so they had a
chance to feel what's going on. I think
we succeeded. After four weeks, they were
so deeply involved with the everyday life
of students. We were astonished,"
Wasileski said.
The students, in fact, became so in

volved with the day-to-day life, that some
supervisors became a little nervous.
While the Stanford students were in
Poland, students and workers struck for
the first time since Solidarity was out
lawed in 1980.
During this period, Stanford adminis
tration representatives requested stu
dents to stay out of the way. "Here was
history being made and they (Stanford)
wanted us to stay clear of what was hap
pening. That's an awfully big tempta
tion," Levine said.
In anticipation of a strike by Jagiel
lonian students, the police moved into
Krakow. Levine recalled watching "60 or
70 police cars roll past the student
dorms." Fellow student Lloyd Day
recalled that "tension was high — stu
dents were banging pots and glasses and
throwing burning paper from the bal
conies."
Levine spoke of one illegal rally he
attended where "several thousand stu
dents were voting on whether or not to
occupy the dorms, classrooms or neither.
The Polish students told us to 'be ready
to run because they (the police) will beat
you,'" Levine explained.
"We heard stories of the police taking
speed, LSD, etc. to get high so they could
beat you."
Senior Beth Kreitzer attended a
Solidarity mass on Poland's Independece
Day, a day now outlawed and witnessed
something far removed from an orthodox
religious service.
"The mass was held at a church at the
top of a hill. At the bottom of the hill
were lines of hundreds and hundreds of
police. We were stopped and asked for
our I.D. It was very frightening. We
jumped on a tram. As we passed the city
square, we saw the Zomo (the riot police)
go running by. The crowd had turned
into a mob scene and people were running
in the streets. The next day we heard
people were beaten," recalled Kreitzer.
Sanborn said she and fellow RA and
TA Debbie Lloyd often assumed much of
the resposibility for the actions of the
Stanford students. "The students would
go cheerfully off to these demonstra
tions. . . . We'd be like mother hens,
'Please don't take your cameras. Be sure
you have your passports,'" she said.
"We never really knew if this was going
to be a safe thing or not. We didn't know

if the situation would explode."
The students also had the unique op
portunity of hearing news accounts of
current events from both the East and
the West. "You realize how much the
Communist press would falsify the news
and how much the Western press would
exaggerate it." Levine said.
Despite all of this action, the students
admitted that when they stayed away
from the "hot spots" everything went on
as normal.
"The majority of the [Polish] students
were apprehensive. Many went home be
cause they didn't want to deal with it,"
Day said.
"The movements never seemed to con
stitute the whole population. I think
Solidarity was a rare occurence. I don't
think it's ever happened before and I
don't think it will happen again for a
long time. ... I think it's going to be
awhile before real change occurs," said
Sanborn.
Other students agreed with Day's ob
servation that "the Poles are very vocal
about their opposition to communism."
Kreitzer added that for "people our age,

they don't have a lot of hope for change.
"Many of the younger people are
looking at their life and asking 'What
can I do with my life?' and they see
nothing. ... They have a lot of pride in
Poland. Many would like to go to the
West and work for awhile and then come
back, buy a house, a car and 'retire,"'
Kreitzer added.
The Stanford students were also able
to compare life in Poland to life in the
USSR as the group traveled to Russia at
the end of the quarter. The students from
Krakow met up with the Stanford stu
dents from the Berlin campus in Moscow.
In both Moscow and Leningrad they
spoke with Soviet students.
"Most of the students we talked to
didn't realize what it was like in other
countries of Eastern Europe. They hadn't
traveled outside of the USSR. They'd say,
'We're all brothers in our common ideol
ogy,' but they don't realize how much
the Poles hate the Soviet Union," Kreit
zer said.

with were members of the Kom
somol. "They were very 'party
line,"' Day said.
However, one student took Day
aside and spoke of how "he and
his friend live in this fake world
where they totally pretend to be
good Communists."
Day recalled how the students
wanted to leave for the United
States.

"As we said good-bye he said,
'Maybe I'll see you in America.'
and I said, 'I hope we meet
again,"' Day explained.
"I'm so glad I lived in Poland
before going [to the Soviet Uni
on]. .. It's so easy for us to see
the world divided into two
monolithic worlds: us and our
allies, and them and their allies.
It's kind of like putting on
blinders," Kreitzer said.
Yet living with Polish "ideology
in practice" opened her eyes to
the contradictions of Eastern Bloc

expectations and reality.
"Americans have a . . . superfi
cial view of what's going on in
Eastern Europe," Waselewski
commented. He spoke of his as
tonishment in watching the rapid
transformation of students' per
ceptions of both Eastern Europe
and the United States.
Sanborn talked of the merits of
living in the Polish system and
seeing "how it is good and bad,"
and finally having the ability to
view American society and eco
nomy more objectively through
distance and concrete comparison.

volved with the day-to-day life, that some
supervisors became a little nervous.
While the Stanford students were in
Poland, students and workers struck for
the first time since Solidarity was out
lawed in 1980.
During this period, Stanford adminis
tration representatives requested stu
dents to stay out of the way. "Here was
history being made and they (Stanford)
wanted us to stay clear of what was hap
pening. That's an awfully big tempta
tion," Levine said.
In anticipation of a strike by Jagiel
lonian students, the police moved into
Krakow. Levine recalled watching "60 or
70 police cars roll past the student
dorms." Fellow student Lloyd Day
recalled that "tension was high — stu
dents were banging pots and glasses and
throwing burning paper from the bal
conies."
Levine spoke of one illegal rally he
attended where "several thousand stu
dents were voting on whether or not to
occupy the dorms, classrooms or neither.
The Polish students told us to 'be ready
to run because they (the police) will beat
you,'" Levine explained.
"We heard stories of the police taking
speed, LSD, etc. to get high so they could
beat you."
Senior Beth Kreitzer attended a
Solidarity mass on Poland's Independece
Day, a day now outlawed and witnessed
something far removed from an orthodox
religious service.
"The mass was held at a church at the
top of a hill. At the bottom of the hill
were lines of hundreds and hundreds of
police. We were stopped and asked for
our I.D. It was very frightening. We
jumped on a tram. As we passed the city
square, we saw the Zomo (the riot police)
go running by. The crowd had turned
into a mob scene and people were running
in the streets. The next day we heard
people were beaten," recalled Kreitzer.
Sanborn said she and fellow RA and
TA Debbie Lloyd often assumed much of
the resposibility for the actions of the
Stanford students. "The students would
go cheerfully off to these demonstra
tions. . . . We'd be like mother hens,
'Please don't take your cameras. Be sure
you have your passports,'" she said.
"We never really knew if this was going
to be a safe thing or not. We didn't know

if the situation would explode."
The students also had the unique op
portunity of hearing news accounts of
current events from both the East and
the West. "You realize how much the
Communist press would falsify the news
and how much the Western press would
exaggerate it." Levine said.
Despite all of this action, the students
admitted that when they stayed away
from the "hot spots" everything went on
as normal.
"The majority of the [Polish] students
were apprehensive. Many went home be
cause they didn't want to deal with it,"
Day said.
"The movements never seemed to con
stitute the whole population. I think
Solidarity was a rare occurence. I don't
think it's ever happened before and I
don't think it will happen again for a
long time. ... I think it's going to be
awhile before real change occurs," said
Sanborn.
Other students agreed with Day's ob
servation that "the Poles are very vocal
about their opposition to communism."
Kreitzer added that for "people our age,

they don't have a lot of hope for change.
"Many of the younger people are
looking at their life and asking 'What
can I do with my life?' and they see
nothing. ... They have a lot of pride in
Poland. Many would like to go to the
West and work for awhile and then come
back, buy a house, a car and 'retire,"'
Kreitzer added.
The Stanford students were also able
to compare life in Poland to life in the
USSR as the group traveled to Russia at
the end of the quarter. The students from
Krakow met up with the Stanford stu
dents from the Berlin campus in Moscow.
In both Moscow and Leningrad they
spoke with Soviet students.
"Most of the students we talked to
didn't realize what it was like in other
countries of Eastern Europe. They hadn't
traveled outside of the USSR. They'd say,
'We're all brothers in our common ideol
ogy,' but they don't realize how much
the Poles hate the Soviet Union," Kreit
zer said.

with were members of the Kom
somol. "They were very 'party
line,"' Day said.
However, one student took Day
aside and spoke of how "he and
his friend live in this fake world
where they totally pretend to be
good Communists."
Day recalled how the students
wanted to leave for the United
States.

"As we said good-bye he said,
'Maybe I'll see you in America.'
and I said, 'I hope we meet
again,"' Day explained.
"I'm so glad I lived in Poland
before going [to the Soviet Uni
on]. .. It's so easy for us to see
the world divided into two
monolithic worlds: us and our
allies, and them and their allies.
It's kind of like putting on
blinders," Kreitzer said.
Yet living with Polish "ideology
in practice" opened her eyes to
the contradictions of Eastern Bloc

expectations and reality.
"Americans have a . . . superfi
cial view of what's going on in
Eastern Europe," Waselewski
commented. He spoke of his as
tonishment in watching the rapid
transformation of students' per
ceptions of both Eastern Europe
and the United States.
Sanborn talked of the merits of
living in the Polish system and
seeing "how it is good and bad,"
and finally having the ability to
view American society and eco
nomy more objectively through
distance and concrete comparison.
From Solidarity to hunting for cheese,
Stanford students studying at the over
seas center in Poland last spring spent
much of their time on the streets of
Krakow, instead of in the library.
• Associated with the Jagellonian Uni
versity in Krakow, the 16 students lived
tn Dom Piast, a dormitory that houses
both Stanford and Polish students.
• According to Dr. Jacek Wasilewski, a
Jagiellonian professor who worked with
(he Stanford program, the program is
designed, "/.. not on*y for those inter
ested in Poland and Eastern Europe, but
also the USSR and Germany." Jagiel
lonian is qurrently a visiting professor at
Stanford.
A special team of Jagiellonian profes
sors instructed the Stanford students in
courses relating to Polish language, cul
ture, society and politics. Although the
courses were taught in English, they were
far from easy.
Jane Sanborn, who served as a theme
associate and resident assistant for Stan
ford students in the Polish dormitory,
said the Polish professors made no al
lowances tor the students' short acquaint
ance witH Polish life. "The professors
weren't easy on them because they were
American," she said.

Weathering rigorous academics has be
come trademark of Stanford students.
Wasilewski pointed out that in compari
son to his Polish students, "Stanford stu
dents are much more hard-working and
responsible."
"The students had the pressures of a
real Stanford quarter with added diffi
culties," Sanborn added. However, the
students seemed to agree that it was these
"added difficulties" which made their ed
ucation unique.
"At the other centers you can be a
tourist, but in Poland you .. . (are)
merged in the society. The fact that Stan
ford offers this is so amazing. You get
to live behind the Iron Curtain for three
months," said David Levine, one of the
students that attended the Poland pro
gram.
Although they were given stipends to
use in restaurants or the marketplace,
the students had to forage for themselves
when it was mealtime. "The students
really had to work at surviving. We'd
share cheese stories. Someone would say,
'I've checked five stores and there isn't
any cheese in Krakow,' Sanborn said.
"Another day someone might come in
and say, 'There's tons of cheese at the
shop next door!' and five people would
run right out and find that it was all
gone."
Levine stressed how different every day
life is in Poland. "The Poles spend their
time basically trying to stay alive. We
spend most of our time trying to succeed,
especially Stanford students, worrying
about our next job and how much money
we'll make. The Poles need to worry
about where to find cheese," he said.
"The program is really able to pull you
into a completely different economic sys
tem and (show) its effects on daily living
in society," Sanborn added.
Wasilewski explained that the program
was designed to give equal importance
to learning by experience, in the form of
field trips and meeting with people, as
to readings and class discussions.
"We tried to keep them as close to
everyday life as possible, so they had a
chance to feel what's going on. I think
we succeeded. After four weeks, they were
so deeply involved with the everyday life
of students. We were astonished,"
Wasileski said.
The students, in fact, became so in

supervisors became a little nervous.

can I do with my life?' and they see
nothing. ... They have a lot of pride in
Poland. Many would like to go to the
West and work for awhile and then come
back, buy a house, a car and 'retire,"'
Kreitzer added.
The Stanford students were also able
to compare life in Poland to life in the
USSR as the group traveled to Russia at
the end of the quarter. The students from
Krakow met up with the Stanford stu
dents from the Berlin campus in Moscow.
In both Moscow and Leningrad they
spoke with Soviet students.
"Most of the students we talked to
didn't realize what it was like in other
countries of Eastern Europe. They hadn't
traveled outside of the USSR. They'd say,
'We're all brothers in our common ideol
ogy,' but they don't realize how much
the Poles hate the Soviet Union," Kreit
zer said.

with were members of the Kom
somol. "They were very 'party
line,"' Day said.
However, one student took Day
aside and spoke of how "he and
his friend live in this fake world
where they totally pretend to be
good Communists."
Day recalled how the students
wanted to leave for the United
States.

"As we said good-bye he said,
'Maybe I'll see you in America.'
and I said, 'I hope we meet
again,"' Day explained.
"I'm so glad I lived in Poland
before going [to the Soviet Uni
on]. .. It's so easy for us to see
the world divided into two
monolithic worlds: us and our
allies, and them and their allies.
It's kind of like putting on
blinders," Kreitzer said.
Yet living with Polish "ideology
in practice" opened her eyes to
the contradictions of Eastern Bloc

expectations and reality.
"Americans have a . . . superfi
cial view of what's going on in
Eastern Europe," Waselewski
commented. He spoke of his as
tonishment in watching the rapid
transformation of students' per
ceptions of both Eastern Europe
and the United States.
Sanborn talked of the merits of
living in the Polish system and
seeing "how it is good and bad,"
and finally having the ability to
view American society and eco
nomy more objectively through
distance and concrete comparison.
From Solidarity to hunting for cheese,
Stanford students studying at the over
seas center in Poland last spring spent
much of their time on the streets of
Krakow, instead of in the library.
• Associated with the Jagellonian Uni
versity in Krakow, the 16 students lived
tn Dom Piast, a dormitory that houses
both Stanford and Polish students.
• According to Dr. Jacek Wasilewski, a
Jagiellonian professor who worked with
(he Stanford program, the program is
designed, "/.. not on*y for those inter
ested in Poland and Eastern Europe, but
also the USSR and Germany." Jagiel
lonian is qurrently a visiting professor at
Stanford.
A special team of Jagiellonian profes
sors instructed the Stanford students in
courses relating to Polish language, cul
ture, society and politics. Although the
courses were taught in English, they were
far from easy.
Jane Sanborn, who served as a theme
associate and resident assistant for Stan
ford students in the Polish dormitory,
said the Polish professors made no al
lowances tor the students' short acquaint
ance witH Polish life. "The professors
weren't easy on them because they were
American," she said.

Weathering rigorous academics has be
come trademark of Stanford students.
Wasilewski pointed out that in compari
son to his Polish students, "Stanford stu
dents are much more hard-working and
responsible."
"The students had the pressures of a
real Stanford quarter with added diffi
culties," Sanborn added. However, the
students seemed to agree that it was these
"added difficulties" which made their ed
ucation unique.
"At the other centers you can be a
tourist, but in Poland you .. . (are)
merged in the society. The fact that Stan
ford offers this is so amazing. You get
to live behind the Iron Curtain for three
months," said David Levine, one of the
students that attended the Poland pro
gram.
Although they were given stipends to
use in restaurants or the marketplace,
the students had to forage for themselves
when it was mealtime. "The students
really had to work at surviving. We'd
share cheese stories. Someone would say,
'I've checked five stores and there isn't
any cheese in Krakow,' Sanborn said.
"Another day someone might come in
and say, 'There's tons of cheese at the
shop next door!' and five people would
run right out and find that it was all
gone."
Levine stressed how different every day
life is in Poland. "The Poles spend their
time basically trying to stay alive. We
spend most of our time trying to succeed,
especially Stanford students, worrying
about our next job and how much money
we'll make. The Poles need to worry
about where to find cheese," he said.
"The program is really able to pull you
into a completely different economic sys
tem and (show) its effects on daily living
in society," Sanborn added.
Wasilewski explained that the program
was designed to give equal importance
to learning by experience, in the form of
field trips and meeting with people, as
to readings and class discussions.
"We tried to keep them as close to
everyday life as possible, so they had a
chance to feel what's going on. I think
we succeeded. After four weeks, they were
so deeply involved with the everyday life
of students. We were astonished,"
Wasileski said.
The students, in fact, became so in

volved with the day-to-day life, that some
supervisors became a little nervous.
While the Stanford students were in
Poland, students and workers struck for
the first time since Solidarity was out
lawed in 1980.
During this period, Stanford adminis
tration representatives requested stu
dents to stay out of the way. "Here was
history being made and they (Stanford)
wanted us to stay clear of what was hap
pening. That's an awfully big tempta
tion," Levine said.
In anticipation of a strike by Jagiel
lonian students, the police moved into
Krakow. Levine recalled watching "60 or
70 police cars roll past the student
dorms." Fellow student Lloyd Day
recalled that "tension was high — stu
dents were banging pots and glasses and
throwing burning paper from the bal
conies."
Levine spoke of one illegal rally he
attended where "several thousand stu
dents were voting on whether or not to
occupy the dorms, classrooms or neither.
The Polish students told us to 'be ready
to run because they (the police) will beat
you,'" Levine explained.
"We heard stories of the police taking
speed, LSD, etc. to get high so they could
beat you."
Senior Beth Kreitzer attended a
Solidarity mass on Poland's Independece
Day, a day now outlawed and witnessed
something far removed from an orthodox
religious service.
"The mass was held at a church at the
top of a hill. At the bottom of the hill
were lines of hundreds and hundreds of
police. We were stopped and asked for
our I.D. It was very frightening. We
jumped on a tram. As we passed the city
square, we saw the Zomo (the riot police)
go running by. The crowd had turned
into a mob scene and people were running
in the streets. The next day we heard
people were beaten," recalled Kreitzer.
Sanborn said she and fellow RA and
TA Debbie Lloyd often assumed much of
the resposibility for the actions of the
Stanford students. "The students would
go cheerfully off to these demonstra
tions. . . . We'd be like mother hens,
'Please don't take your cameras. Be sure
you have your passports,'" she said.
"We never really knew if this was going
to be a safe thing or not. We didn't know

if the situation would explode."
The students also had the unique op
portunity of hearing news accounts of
current events from both the East and
the West. "You realize how much the
Communist press would falsify the news
and how much the Western press would
exaggerate it." Levine said.
Despite all of this action, the students
admitted that when they stayed away
from the "hot spots" everything went on
as normal.
"The majority of the [Polish] students
were apprehensive. Many went home be
cause they didn't want to deal with it,"
Day said.
"The movements never seemed to con
stitute the whole population. I think
Solidarity was a rare occurence. I don't
think it's ever happened before and I
don't think it will happen again for a
long time. ... I think it's going to be
awhile before real change occurs," said
Sanborn.
Other students agreed with Day's ob
servation that "the Poles are very vocal
about their opposition to communism."
Kreitzer added that for "people our age,

they don't have a lot of hope for change.
"Many of the younger people are
looking at their life and asking 'What
can I do with my life?' and they see
nothing. ... They have a lot of pride in
Poland. Many would like to go to the
West and work for awhile and then come
back, buy a house, a car and 'retire,"'
Kreitzer added.
