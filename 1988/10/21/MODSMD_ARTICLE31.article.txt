Now and then a lot of you freshmen
must hear mention of the Western Cul
ture Debate. Since you haven't been
around for the past few years, I thought
as a public service I might bring you
up to date on the Debate — what it is,
who it affects, and whether it can ac
tually help shrink the swelling of
hemorrhoidal tissues.
For the past few years, there has been
a major disagreement among members
of the Stanford community as to which
texts should be read by students in the
Western Culture program.
One side in the debate says students
should read bodes by authors with only
one name, such as Plato, Aristotle,
Homer, Sophocles, Monocles, Barnacles,
Manacles and Sting. On the other hand,
the opposing view holds that students
should read books by authors with two,
three or even more names, such as Mal
colm X, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Martin
Luther King, Jr. and Peter, Paul and
Mary.
Fundamentally, it all comes down to
the question of who had the greatest
influence on the development of Western
Thought.
The Development of Western thought
Western Thought began in 402 B.C.
when Plato first wrote "The Republic,"
the tenet of which can be sum
marized as "Man is basically good and
kindhearted, although bad at remem
bering to vacuum the apartment."
Next came the Middle Ages or "Pu
berty," during which Western thought
flourished, although it would frequently

daydream about the opposite sex.
Thinkers during this period were re
quired to have a name that began with
the letter "M": More, Machiavelli, Mon
taigne, Milton, Mickey Mouse, etc.
The most famous work written during
this period was "Beowulf," a story
which gave rise to the philosophy de
scribed by the phrase, "Never cry wulf."
The last period of Western Thought
was the Enlightenment. During the En
lightenment many people developed very
controversial philosophies, so conse
quently they all used goofy spellings of
their names so as to remain anonymous.
Some of the most famous writers of
this period included Rooso, Gerta, Flow
bear, Neechee, Froyd, Froyo, Froto, Gol
lum and Bilbo.
Western Thought ended abruptly in
1975 with the invention of Disco Music.
But beyond The Debate, the problem
with studying Western Culture is that
you run the risk of becoming cultured.
This is clearly a bad idea. My parents,
for instance, studied Western Culture
when they were in college, and now
they do ridiculous cultured things such
as going to see actual operas without
being forced at gunpoint.
I mean, when given a choice between
watching an opera or being eaten alive
by a grizzly bear, most of us uncultured
people would probably put little sprigs
of parsley behind our ears so as to be
more attractive to the bear.
Opera is a unique example of a cul
tured activity because, unlike most
other cultured activities, such as the

symphony or the ballet, opera is the
only art form routinely performed in
the Martian language.
I know they tell you it's in Italian,
but I went to an opera with an Italian
friend of mine once, and she had no
more idea what they were singing than
I did. Instead of sending all those silly
greetings in many foreign languages on
the Voyager spaceship to Mars, we
should have just sent a copy of "Luciano
Pavaratti's Greatest Hits."
Of course, it doesn't even matter that
opera is in Martian, because it isn't
sung within the human range of hearing
anyway. You get one of those sopranos
up on stage, and pretty soon her voice
goes so high that she starts communi
cating with nearby dolphins.
So in case you haven't decided yet
whether you want to be cultured, here's
a brief translation from one of the
world's most popular operas:
"Lucia di LaMermoor" (Translation:
"I'd like more lamb for lunch.")
Spermaceti: II fatti maschii parole
femine di Bon Jovi. ("My girth is con
siderably greater than that of a foreign
automobile.")
Ravioli: Dolce stil nuovo eppur si
muove al pacino. ("Hark, a small
peasant has become trapped in your
gravitational field.")
Purgatorio: Pucini al dente no pyuni
wini. ("Calling all dolphins. Prepare to
attack Los Angeles at 2100 hours.")

around for the past few years, I thought
as a public service I might bring you
up to date on the Debate — what it is,
who it affects, and whether it can ac
tually help shrink the swelling of
hemorrhoidal tissues.
For the past few years, there has been
a major disagreement among members
of the Stanford community as to which
texts should be read by students in the
Western Culture program.
One side in the debate says students
should read bodes by authors with only
one name, such as Plato, Aristotle,
Homer, Sophocles, Monocles, Barnacles,
Manacles and Sting. On the other hand,
the opposing view holds that students
should read books by authors with two,
three or even more names, such as Mal
colm X, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Martin
Luther King, Jr. and Peter, Paul and
Mary.
Fundamentally, it all comes down to
the question of who had the greatest
influence on the development of Western
Thought.
The Development of Western thought
Western Thought began in 402 B.C.
when Plato first wrote "The Republic,"
the tenet of which can be sum
marized as "Man is basically good and
kindhearted, although bad at remem
bering to vacuum the apartment."
Next came the Middle Ages or "Pu
berty," during which Western thought
flourished, although it would frequently

daydream about the opposite sex.
Thinkers during this period were re
quired to have a name that began with
the letter "M": More, Machiavelli, Mon
taigne, Milton, Mickey Mouse, etc.
The most famous work written during
this period was "Beowulf," a story
which gave rise to the philosophy de
scribed by the phrase, "Never cry wulf."
The last period of Western Thought
was the Enlightenment. During the En
lightenment many people developed very
controversial philosophies, so conse
quently they all used goofy spellings of
their names so as to remain anonymous.
Some of the most famous writers of
this period included Rooso, Gerta, Flow
bear, Neechee, Froyd, Froyo, Froto, Gol
lum and Bilbo.
Western Thought ended abruptly in
1975 with the invention of Disco Music.
But beyond The Debate, the problem
with studying Western Culture is that
you run the risk of becoming cultured.
This is clearly a bad idea. My parents,
for instance, studied Western Culture
when they were in college, and now
they do ridiculous cultured things such
as going to see actual operas without
being forced at gunpoint.
I mean, when given a choice between
watching an opera or being eaten alive
by a grizzly bear, most of us uncultured
people would probably put little sprigs
of parsley behind our ears so as to be
more attractive to the bear.
Opera is a unique example of a cul
tured activity because, unlike most
other cultured activities, such as the

symphony or the ballet, opera is the
only art form routinely performed in
the Martian language.
I know they tell you it's in Italian,
but I went to an opera with an Italian
friend of mine once, and she had no
more idea what they were singing than
I did. Instead of sending all those silly
greetings in many foreign languages on
the Voyager spaceship to Mars, we
should have just sent a copy of "Luciano
Pavaratti's Greatest Hits."
Of course, it doesn't even matter that
opera is in Martian, because it isn't
sung within the human range of hearing
anyway. You get one of those sopranos
up on stage, and pretty soon her voice
goes so high that she starts communi
cating with nearby dolphins.
So in case you haven't decided yet
whether you want to be cultured, here's
a brief translation from one of the
world's most popular operas:
"Lucia di LaMermoor" (Translation:
"I'd like more lamb for lunch.")
Spermaceti: II fatti maschii parole
femine di Bon Jovi. ("My girth is con
siderably greater than that of a foreign
automobile.")
Ravioli: Dolce stil nuovo eppur si
muove al pacino. ("Hark, a small
peasant has become trapped in your
gravitational field.")
Purgatorio: Pucini al dente no pyuni
wini. ("Calling all dolphins. Prepare to
attack Los Angeles at 2100 hours.")
