# New clinic to research, treat Marfan syndrome
## 
### Jay Pinto 
Many remember the sudden, tragic
death of American Olympic volleyball
star Flo Hyman. Her death made infa
mous the unusual and little-understood
disease called Marfan syndrome which
struck unexpectedly moments after she
left the court during a match.
A new clinic at the Stanford Medical
School has been established to unravel
some of the mysteries of this complex
syndrome. Founded by a group of several
physicians from different specializations,
the clinic will research and treat Marfan
syndrome, an inherited disorder that
weakens blood vessels and other connec
tive tissue.
The idea for the clinic formed last
spring when Dr. Craig Miller, a senior
cardiovascular surgeon at the Medical
Center, and Dr. Tim Fischell, a car
diologist, collaborated on several opera
tions of aortic repair. Fischell and Dr.
Paul Pitlick, a pediatric cardiologist, co
direct the new clinic.
Marfan syndrome causes a variety of
abnormalities in the human body in
cluding severe myopia, eye lens displace
ment, scoliosis, misshapen chests, loose
jointedness, flat arches, high-arched
palates and tall, slender stature.
The cardiovascular system, however,
is the area most seriously threatened by
the disease. The mitral valve, the part
of the heart that separates the left
atrium from the left ventricle, may
weaken and allow blood to leak or cause
irregular heart beats. Heart surgery is
one treatment for the syndrome. The
surgery repairs or replaces the aortic
valve, the weak area of the aorta or both.
Stanford's clinic will serve a dual role
as both a treatment and a reseach center.
The center has three main research
goals, according to Fischell.
One aim is clinical, improving therapy
for sufferers of the syndrome. The
therapy includes pathological studies
and methods such as echo cardiograms
and magnetic resonance imaging to
study heart rhythms. Echo cardiograms
and resonance imaging generate pictures
of the heart pulses, which help reveal

on the heart muscle.
A second goal of the clinic is to create
effective drug regimens. Both acute and
long-term studies will measure the en
largement of the heart and document
the results of several combinations of
drugs intended to ease the injury of the
disease.
The clinic will also concentrate on the
molecular-biological side of Marfan
Syndrome. Study in this area, however,
will begin only after enrollment in the
clinic exceeds 100 patients, so that re
searchers will have sufficient numbers
of case studies to draw general conclu
sions, Fishell said. He intends to study
the disease upclose, "to look at the ge
netic defects" that are at the root of
the syndrome.
The clinic treats all aspects of Marfan
syndrome and has a multidisciplinary
nature, drawing from specialists in many
fields. Experts include cardiologist Mil
ler, geneticist Kate Johnson, orthopedic
specialist John Smith, rheumatologist
Edward Harris and members from the
opthalmology, radiology and cardiac echo
laboratory.
The clinic now has nearly 35 patients;
the number is expect to increase to 200
within the next two years, Fishell said.
Researchers expect that children will
make up 40 percent of the patients.
At its most severe, Marfan syndrome
causes a gradual enlargement of the
aorta, leading to eventual rupture of the
artery during strenuous exercise.
This phenomenon caused Hyman's
death. The autopsy showed her aorta
had been weakened by Marfan syndrome
