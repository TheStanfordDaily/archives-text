# New clinic to research, treat Marfan syndrome
## 
### Jay Pinto 
Many remember the sudden, tragic
death of American Olympic volleyball
star Flo Hyman. Her death made infa
mous the unusual and little-understood
disease called Marfan syndrome which
struck unexpectedly moments after she
left the court during a match.
A new clinic at the Stanford Medical
School has been established to unravel
some of the mysteries of this complex
syndrome. Founded by a group of several
physicians from different specializations,
the clinic will research and treat Marfan
syndrome, an inherited disorder that
weakens blood vessels and other connec
tive tissue.
The idea for the clinic formed last
spring when Dr. Craig Miller, a senior
cardiovascular surgeon at the Medical
Center, and Dr. Tim Fischell, a car
diologist, collaborated on several opera
tions of aortic repair. Fischell and Dr.
Paul Pitlick, a pediatric cardiologist, co
direct the new clinic.
Marfan syndrome causes a variety of
abnormalities in the human body in
cluding severe myopia, eye lens displace
ment, scoliosis, misshapen chests, loose
jointedness, flat arches, high-arched
palates and tall, slender stature.
The cardiovascular system, however,
is the area most seriously threatened by
the disease. The mitral valve, the part
of the heart that separates the left
atrium from the left ventricle, may
weaken and allow blood to leak or cause
irregular heart beats. Heart surgery is
one treatment for the syndrome. The
surgery repairs or replaces the aortic
valve, the weak area of the aorta or both.
Stanford's clinic will serve a dual role
as both a treatment and a reseach center.
The center has three main research
goals, according to Fischell.
One aim is clinical, improving therapy
for sufferers of the syndrome. The
therapy includes pathological studies
and methods such as echo cardiograms
and magnetic resonance imaging to
study heart rhythms. Echo cardiograms
and resonance imaging generate pictures
of the heart pulses, which help reveal

Marfan syndrome
causes the aorta to
rupture during
strenuous exercise.

the machinations of Marfan syndrome
on the heart muscle.
A second goal of the clinic is to create
effective drug regimens. Both acute and
long-term studies will measure the en
largement of the heart and document
the results of several combinations of
drugs intended to ease the injury of the
disease.
The clinic will also concentrate on the
molecular-biological side of Marfan
Syndrome. Study in this area, however,
will begin only after enrollment in the
clinic exceeds 100 patients, so that re
searchers will have sufficient numbers
of case studies to draw general conclu
sions, Fishell said. He intends to study
the disease upclose, "to look at the ge
netic defects" that are at the root of
the syndrome.
The clinic treats all aspects of Marfan
syndrome and has a multidisciplinary
nature, drawing from specialists in many
fields. Experts include cardiologist Mil
ler, geneticist Kate Johnson, orthopedic
specialist John Smith, rheumatologist
Edward Harris and members from the
opthalmology, radiology and cardiac echo
laboratory.
The clinic now has nearly 35 patients;
the number is expect to increase to 200
within the next two years, Fishell said.
Researchers expect that children will
make up 40 percent of the patients.
At its most severe, Marfan syndrome
causes a gradual enlargement of the
aorta, leading to eventual rupture of the
artery during strenuous exercise.
This phenomenon caused Hyman's
death. The autopsy showed her aorta
had been weakened by Marfan syndrome
and ruptured without warning
during the game. The incident
precipitated a wave of conscious
ness of the disease — many ath
letes consulted doctors to make
sure they had no symptons asso
ciated with Marfan syndrome. Ul
timately, the precautionary meas
ures saved many lives.
With millions of heart beats
placing stress on the aorta, life
expectancy for sufferers of Marfan
syndrome is well below the 75-

year norm for healthy Americans.
"Untreated, [life expectancy] is
probably 35 to 40 years. With cur
rent therapy, with surgery, with
[a medicine called] beta-blockers
— it's close to 50," Fischell noted.
The exact cause or causes of
the syndrome are not yet known.
Fischell said the cause may be
one single abnormal gene or some
combination of many irregular
genes. Most researchers believe
that the abnormality, whatever its
exact location, changes one of the
proteins providing strength to
connective tissue, such as muscle.
One protein thought to weaken

as a result of the> syndrome is
collagen. Complicating matters,
however, collagen is found in five
different forms. A structural
defect in some, an inability to
form cross links or some other
unknown physical defect may lead
to the syndrome, according to Fis
chell.
Treatment consists of ad
ministrating certain drugs to al
leviate the stress placed on the
weakened areas of the heart.
Medicines block the effects of
adrenaline on the heart. This
lowers the blood pressure and
slows the heart to reduce stretch
ing of the aorta.

A second goal of the clinic is to create
effective drug regimens. Both acute and
long-term studies will measure the en
largement of the heart and document
the results of several combinations of
drugs intended to ease the injury of the

The clinic will also concentrate on the
molecular-biological side of Marfan
Syndrome. Study in this area, however,
will begin only after enrollment in the
clinic exceeds 100 patients, so that re
searchers will have sufficient numbers
of case studies to draw general conclu
sions, Fishell said. He intends to study
the disease upclose, "to look at the ge
netic defects" that are at the root of
the syndrome.
The clinic treats all aspects of Marfan
syndrome and has a multidisciplinary
nature, drawing from specialists in many
fields. Experts include cardiologist Mil
ler, geneticist Kate Johnson, orthopedic
specialist John Smith, rheumatologist
Edward Harris and members from the
opthalmology, radiology and cardiac echo
laboratory.
The clinic now has nearly 35 patients;
the number is expect to increase to 200
within the next two years, Fishell said.
Researchers expect that children will
make up 40 percent of the patients.
At its most severe, Marfan syndrome
causes a gradual enlargement of the
aorta, leading to eventual rupture of the
artery during strenuous exercise.
This phenomenon caused Hyman's
death. The autopsy showed her aorta
had been weakened by Marfan syndrome
and ruptured without warning
during the game. The incident
precipitated a wave of conscious
ness of the disease — many ath
letes consulted doctors to make
sure they had no symptons asso
ciated with Marfan syndrome. Ul
timately, the precautionary meas
ures saved many lives.
With millions of heart beats
placing stress on the aorta, life
expectancy for sufferers of Marfan
syndrome is well below the 75-

year norm for healthy Americans.
"Untreated, [life expectancy] is
probably 35 to 40 years. With cur
rent therapy, with surgery, with
[a medicine called] beta-blockers
— it's close to 50," Fischell noted.
The exact cause or causes of
the syndrome are not yet known.
Fischell said the cause may be
one single abnormal gene or some
combination of many irregular
genes. Most researchers believe
that the abnormality, whatever its
exact location, changes one of the
proteins providing strength to
connective tissue, such as muscle.
One protein thought to weaken

as a result of the> syndrome is
collagen. Complicating matters,
however, collagen is found in five
different forms. A structural
defect in some, an inability to
form cross links or some other
unknown physical defect may lead
to the syndrome, according to Fis
chell.
Treatment consists of ad
ministrating certain drugs to al
leviate the stress placed on the
weakened areas of the heart.
Medicines block the effects of
adrenaline on the heart. This
lowers the blood pressure and
slows the heart to reduce stretch
ing of the aorta.
Many remember the sudden, tragic
death of American Olympic volleyball
star Flo Hyman. Her death made infa
mous the unusual and little-understood
disease called Marfan syndrome which
struck unexpectedly moments after she
left the court during a match.
A new clinic at the Stanford Medical
School has been established to unravel
some of the mysteries of this complex
syndrome. Founded by a group of several
physicians from different specializations,
the clinic will research and treat Marfan
syndrome, an inherited disorder that
weakens blood vessels and other connec
tive tissue.
The idea for the clinic formed last
spring when Dr. Craig Miller, a senior
cardiovascular surgeon at the Medical
Center, and Dr. Tim Fischell, a car
diologist, collaborated on several opera
tions of aortic repair. Fischell and Dr.
Paul Pitlick, a pediatric cardiologist, co
direct the new clinic.
Marfan syndrome causes a variety of
abnormalities in the human body in
cluding severe myopia, eye lens displace
ment, scoliosis, misshapen chests, loose
jointedness, flat arches, high-arched
palates and tall, slender stature.
The cardiovascular system, however,
is the area most seriously threatened by
the disease. The mitral valve, the part
of the heart that separates the left
atrium from the left ventricle, may
weaken and allow blood to leak or cause
irregular heart beats. Heart surgery is
one treatment for the syndrome. The
surgery repairs or replaces the aortic
valve, the weak area of the aorta or both.
Stanford's clinic will serve a dual role
as both a treatment and a reseach center.
The center has three main research
goals, according to Fischell.
One aim is clinical, improving therapy
for sufferers of the syndrome. The
therapy includes pathological studies
and methods such as echo cardiograms
and magnetic resonance imaging to
study heart rhythms. Echo cardiograms
and resonance imaging generate pictures
of the heart pulses, which help reveal
