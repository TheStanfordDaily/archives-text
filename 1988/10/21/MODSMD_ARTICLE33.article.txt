Mike says no to SFO

Sorry, fans, but Michael Jackson will pass
up the Bay Area on the final leg of his American
tour. The closest he'll get to here is Irvine (Nov.
7-9) and Los Angeles (Nov 22-28).
We know you're broken up by the Bad news,
but take heart, there's still time to get your
tickets for the AC/DC and Cinderella concert
next month.
Horny Monks
Stanford's only rpck band with a horn section,
The flegtric Monks, plays a free concert at
Tresioder toctey at noon. Besides playing some
of the standard cover tunes that the other
campus bands play, the Electric Monks are
able to put a brass charge into songs like Peter
Gabriel's "Sledgehammer," The Talking Heads'

To You?"

Pack your lunch today and enjoy some great
music under the sun. We recommend sitting
close to the trumpet player.
