## Mellow music for the masses

Attention all music lovers — Shadowfax
is coming to the Farm. This six-man in
strumental band brings with them their
unique brand of "world music," featuring
over 150 instruments from around the
globe.
Formerly recording artists on the Palo
Alto-based Windham Hill label, Shadowfax
has released its first album on Capitol
Records, "Folksongs For a Nuclear Village,"
which is the band's sixth career album.
Shadowfax's recording history dates back
to their 1976 debut release, "Watercourse
Way."
Says bassist Phil Maggini: "Each album
is a snapshot of where the band is from
year to year. We expect every album in the
future to be a departure from the previous
ones. 'Dreams of Children' (1984) was a
centerpiece for the period of time we spent
at Windham Hill. In the one that followed,
'Too Far To Whisper' (1986), we felt more
electric. Then we began missing the ear
thier elements, the acoustic elements, so
we incorporated more of that in 'Folksongs
For A Nuclear Village.' "
The band formed in 1972 and took their
name from the J.R.R. Tolkien novel "Lord
Of The Rings." Shadowfax disbanded be
tween 1978 and 1982 when they found the
disco era had created an unfriendly climate
for their type of music, but in 1982 came

together again as interest in more diverse
forms of music began to emerge.
As an instrumental band, Shadowfax has
incorporated all genres of music — blues,
classical, jazz and rock. From this mixture
of varied musical interests, Shadowfax has
developed a sound loosely based around
the talents of Chuck Greenberg on lyricon,
an instrument he describes as "an
electronic wind instrument with a syn
thesized horn."
Although Shadowfax doesn't produce the
raw power and energy that one would ex
pect from a more mainstream band like
Van Halen, they are talented musicians in
their own right. Because their songs don't
have lyrics, their music is their sound,
which is one that practically defies descrip
tion. It's an instrumental sound that's not
quite mellow enough to be quiet back
ground music, but often not quite loud
enough to stand alone.
To categorize them yourself you'll need
to hear them. And luckily, Shadowfax will
be performing tomorrow at 8:30 p.m. in
Memorial Auditorium. Bruce Abrams, a
Santa Cruz folk guitarist, will open the
show.
And, if you're not into instrumental
bands, the "Monster Truck and Tractor
Pull" will be at the Oakland Coliseum at
7:30 p.m.

Tickets for Shadowfax are available at
the Tresidder ticket office. All seats are
reserved.
