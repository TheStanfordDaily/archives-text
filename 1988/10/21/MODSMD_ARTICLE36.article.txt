## New U2 rattles and hums 
### Matthew Marx 
The last thing you'd expect from a
Grammy-winning rock group —
platinum records to boot — would be
to start an album with a Beatles cover.
But a passionate "Helter Skelter" kicks
off U2's latest "Rattle and Hum," and
the rest of the album is no less unusual.
U2 was one of the first bands to break
the sacred 45-minute album limit with
50 minutes of "The Joshua Tree." Def
Leppard upped the ante to a full hour
with "Hysteria," and now U2 regains
the dubious Longest Album Award with
this 70-minute work.

Even though it falls short of the 90-
minute double album length, Island
Records deems it "Double Play" and
sticks you with the hefty double album
price anyway. The tape will run you
$15; take a 20 if you're planning on the
CD.
Price aside, Ireland's holy lads turn
in an exhilarating performance with
"Rattle and Hum," exploring a truly
unique concept of an album: one that
combines new material, live recordings
of old favorites, and even — a first for

U2 — remakes.
Complementing the "Helter
Skelter" cover is a powerful,
pounding rendition of the Dylan
written, Hendrix-immortalized
"All Along the Watch
tower."
Live performance has always
been U2's forte; concert veterans
will thrill to four recordings from
"The Joshua Tree" tour.
Not to worry. There's a full 40
minutes of new material. The best
of the studio tracks is "God Part
II," dedicated to John Lennon and
an implied sequel to his Plastic
Ono Band's Part I. Larry Mullen
Jr.'s throbbing drums hypnotize
as Bono soars on one of his
strongest vocal performances to
date. "Desire" is reminiscent of
the upbeat, early U2 of "Boy";
it's even (gasp!) danceable.
Bono splits vocals with 8.8.
King on the uncharacteristically
bouncy "When Love Comes to
Town." Another team-up, "Love
Rescue Me," this time Bono writ
ing lyrics with Bob Dylan, might
be more at home on Springsteen's
next LP.
While earlier titles like "War"
have set a lyrical tone for an al
bum, the title "Rattle and Hum"
is more a statement of the record's
musical intent. With an accompa
nying movie due on Nov. 4,
there's no doubt that the entire
"Rattle and Hum" project will be
come a True Event.
