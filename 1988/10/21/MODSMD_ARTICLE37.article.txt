## 'Mystic Pizza' shows a slice of life 
### Kathy Kleist 
A slice of life with everything.
That's what the charming, honest and
heart-warming movie "Mystic Pizza" of
fers, and it's well worth consuming.
"Mystic Pizza" follows the develop
ment of the lives of three women during
one autumn in a small town in Con
necticut.
Mystic Pizza is a pizza parlor in Mys
tic, Connecticut, the central influence
on the lives of its three young
waitresses, Daisy, Kat and Jojo. Each
is confronting her life and future in a
separate way.
Jojo is insatiably involved with a local
fisherman, who loves her and wants to
marry her, though Jojo is not ready for
commitment.
Kat is bound for Yale, working four

jobs to earn the money. She plans to
be an astronomer. Kat has always been
the "perfect" sister, doing all the right
thingß and having all the right goals.
Daisy is the kind of beautiful that
makes men see her in their bedrooms
as soon as they meet her. She doesn't
know what she wants from life, but she
knows she wants to get it soon.
The film tracks what happens over
their final fall together, as they confront
and make decisions about their futures,
giving us an inspired look at personal
growth and friendships.
Despite the fact that the newspaper
ads for the film are trying to sell it
either as another "Big Chill" or another
teen sex comedy, it is neither of those.
Rather, it has a distinct flavor of its
own.
The character development of all the

lead characters in the film is extraordi
nary — consistent, honest and satisfy
ing. The actors, none of whom are well
known, do an excellent job of being con
vincing as their characters grow.
The directing by Donald Petrie is
first-rate, guiding the film gracefully
from the mundane to the inspired,
giving the viewer realism and wonder
in perfect proportion. The balance be
tween the main characters is well
sustained.
The photography and soundtrack are
both rich, adding texture and flavor.
These areas highlight the movie's only
weakness, a sense of its been staged, or
the picture being too perfect.
But the weakness is easily ignorable.
Overall, watching "Mystic Pizza" is a
nourishing, fun and enriching experi
ence.
