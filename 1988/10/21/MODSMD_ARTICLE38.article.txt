## Catch 'Yellow Fever' tonight 
### Andrew Berkowitz Editorial staff 
The best opportunity of the quarter to see
quality theater on campus happens tonight when
the Pan Asian Repertory Theatre presents their
Bay Area premier of R.A. Shiomi's comedy
mystery "Yellow Fever."
The play spoofs the classic black-and-white
detective story and focuses on the tangled rela
tionship between Asian and Caucasian cultures.
Set in the Japanese community of Vancouver,
British Columbia, Japanese-American inves
tigator Sam Shikaze (Raul Aranas) sets out to
Bolve the mysterious disappearance of the cherry
blossom queen at a local festival.
The Pan Asian Repertory Theatre was founded
in 1977 by Tisa Chang, and is the East Coast's
only professional Asian-American theater compa
ny. Now in its 11th season, the company stages
mainstage productions of new works by Asian-
American playwrights, American premiers of
Asian masterworks and innovative adaptations of
Western classics.
"The New York Times," "The New Yorker,"
"Newsday" and"The New York Post" all gave
heavy praise to the New York production, the
latter calling it "A delightful spoof. . . . There are
grins, chuckles and outright howls in this funny
business."
Author Rick Shiomi, a Canadian, worked for
nearly two years with the Asian- American
Theatre Company in San Francisco developing
"Yellow Fever."

"Yellow Fever" plays tonight at 8 p.m. in
Memorial Auditorium. Student tickets are avail
able at half-price.


Raul Aranas plays detective Sam Shikaze in
