## Grins, sobs and ducks 
### Shirky Herkha 
Alarming, yes. Eye-opening,
yes. But amusing?
Not a word that comes to mind
when talking about life in Central
America today.
Yet, Andy Fleischmann man
ages to evoke laughter while sub
tly bringing the audience into an
awareness about the problems in
Central America through his one
man monologue titled "Of Course,
by the End, the Duck Was Dead."
It forces us to think not only
about the difficulties of life in
that region, but also about the
comparative luxury of our lives.
Humorous events are inter
twined with images of war, yet

they are all presented with a calm
air that seems at times almost
nonchalant. While we are at first
left unsettled, we later come to
realize that he is presenting life
as he has seen it.
War and death are accepted
parts of life in much of Central
America, and in seemingly
downplaying their importance, he
makes us come to realize the hor
rors which are taken for granted
there.

"Of Course, by the End, the
Duck was Dead" plays tonight
and tomorrow at 8 p.m. at the
Elliot Program Center. Admission
is free.
