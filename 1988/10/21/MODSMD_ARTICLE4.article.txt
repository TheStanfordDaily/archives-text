# Porter elected chair
## People's Platform adds top senate post to gains 
### Amy Rosenfeld Staff writer 
After several weeks of uncertainty, the
ASSU Senate has a new chair. David Porter,
an ally of the Peoples' Platform minority
and progressive student coalition, assumed
the post after an hour of closed debate at
last night's senate meeting.
Porter, a graduate student in industrial
engineering, defeated juniors Dana Klapper
and Kelvin Wong, neither of whom are
associated with a party.
The position of chair, which is normally
filled in the spring, was vacated abruptly
two weeks ago when computer science grad
uate student Richard Vaughan announced
he would be leaving Stanford in January
and thus resigning his post.
Porter's victory marks a consolidation
of power for the Platform, which also con
trols half the senate and the Council of
Presidents. Porter ran and lost last spring
against Vaughan, who was not identified
with the platform.
The secret vote, which senators said was
"very close," reflected the party line.
Senator Chris Gacek, a graduate student
in political science, said, "The vote went

the way you would have expected it to go."
After the vote, Wong and Klapper con
gratulated Porter. Klapper told Porter she

was confident he could do
an effective job as chair.
All three were unavailable
to be reached for comment.
The senate chair sets
meeting agendas, coordi
nates committee assign
ments and controls who can
speak on the floor. Still,
most senators downplayed
the significance of the elec-

tion and said Porter would not have that
much power.
Senator Amol Doshi, not a Platform
member, said he did not think Porter's
affiliation would have "too much impact"
on the dynamics of the senate. "He doesn't
get a chance to express his opinion," Doshi
said. "He's only a mediator."
Porter's ties to the Platform may help
improve relations between the senate and
the COP, which historically have been less
than ideal. Last year a non-Platform COP
squabbled often with the Platform-
