# Porter elected chair
## People's Platform adds top senate post to gains 
### Amy Rosenfeld Staff writer 
After several weeks of uncertainty, the
ASSU Senate has a new chair. David Porter,
an ally of the Peoples' Platform minority
and progressive student coalition, assumed
the post after an hour of closed debate at
last night's senate meeting.
Porter, a graduate student in industrial
engineering, defeated juniors Dana Klapper
and Kelvin Wong, neither of whom are
associated with a party.
The position of chair, which is normally
filled in the spring, was vacated abruptly
two weeks ago when computer science grad
uate student Richard Vaughan announced
he would be leaving Stanford in January
and thus resigning his post.
Porter's victory marks a consolidation
of power for the Platform, which also con
trols half the senate and the Council of
Presidents. Porter ran and lost last spring
against Vaughan, who was not identified
with the platform.
The secret vote, which senators said was
"very close," reflected the party line.
Senator Chris Gacek, a graduate student
in political science, said, "The vote went

the way you would have expected it to go."
After the vote, Wong and Klapper con
gratulated Porter. Klapper told Porter she

was confident he could do
an effective job as chair.
All three were unavailable
to be reached for comment.
The senate chair sets
meeting agendas, coordi
nates committee assign
ments and controls who can
speak on the floor. Still,
most senators downplayed
the significance of the elec-

tion and said Porter would not have that
much power.
Senator Amol Doshi, not a Platform
member, said he did not think Porter's
affiliation would have "too much impact"
on the dynamics of the senate. "He doesn't
get a chance to express his opinion," Doshi
said. "He's only a mediator."
Porter's ties to the Platform may help
improve relations between the senate and
the COP, which historically have been less
than ideal. Last year a non-Platform COP
squabbled often with the Platform-


Porter
controlled senate.
"It's definitely a plus, but I
wouldn't say [relations] are going
to ride on that," COP member
Canetta Ivy said. "The fact that
he is supported by the People's
Platform is now a moot point,
because he has to be objective."
According to COP member Da
vid Brown, Porter's ASSU exper
ience will help bring the senate
and COP together more than his
ties to the Platform. Porter has
served three previous years as a
senator and was a member of the
1984-85 Council of Presidents.

The senate dealt with several
other timely and controversial is
sues during last night's three
and-a-half-hour meeting.
A bill presented by the student
affairs committee calling for the
senate to "support demands made
by students of color in response
to racial incidents at Ujamaa,"
referred to this week's revelations
of racist incidents at the black
theme house.
The bill supported demands by
minority student groups for full
time deans for minority commu
nities, strengthening and creating
ethnic studies departments and
adding a clause to the Fundamen
tal Standard "explicitly desig
nating] acts of racism as viola
tions" of the Standard.
The resolution passed unani
mously.
A controversial proposal by the

ASSU Speaker's Bureau to bring
Nicaraguan Contra leader Adolfo
Calero to campus sparked heated
debate among senators about the
appropriateness of sponsoring
him with student funds.
Several senators joined repre
sentatives of the Stanford Central
America Action Network in
denouncing the invitation.
Although the initial bill was
withdrawn to give the Speakers
Bureau more time to prepare a
program, COP member Stacey
Leyton submitted a resolution
directing the Bureau not to spend
any money to bring Calero-
Despite the objections, Leyton's
resolution narrowly passed.
The senate also approved a res
olution calling for a public forum
on contract negotiations between
the University and the United
Stanford Workers.
