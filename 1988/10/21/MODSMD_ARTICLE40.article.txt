## Card goes for third straight win against OSU 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Redemption, straight ahead.
Seeking its third consecutive
victory after a 1-3 start, the Stan
ford football team meets Oregon
State at 1:00 p.m. in Stanford
Stadium tomorrow. Although the
Cardinal is perhaps the best .500
team in the nation, ro one is
satisfied.
The Cardinal is attempting to
get above the break-even point for
the first time this season against
the Beavers. Both teams come
into the game with 3-3 overall
records and 1-2 marks in the
Pacific 10 Conference.
"It'll be a heck of a challenge,"
Stanford Coach Jack Elway said.
The Beavers have long been
known as a team to beat up on
in the rugged Pac-10, but that is
far from the case this season.
Oregon State has already
beaten San Jose State, California
and Fresno State to post one more
victory than the team had all of
last season. The Beavers also
nearly upset a strong Colorado
football team and, in their last
outing two weeks ago, stayed
within 10 points of top-ranked
UCLA until the final minute.
"We feel we're playing pretty
good football," OSU Coach Dave
Kragthorpe said, "the best since
I've been here at Oregon State.
We've played six pretty solid foot
ball games .. . and that's certainly
a step forward as far as this pro
gram's concerned."
The Beavers have not won more
than three games in a season since
1971 (although they won three
and tied one in 1978), but now
have five chances to surpass that
mark.
Additionally, Oregon State has
rushed for 774 net yards thus far
this season. Not only is that more
than Stanford has rushed for this
year, it is more than OSU has

rushed for in any of the last three
full seasons.
But the Beavers are still an air
it-out team. Senior southpaw
quarterback Erik Wilhelm has
thrown for 1,633 yards this
season, completing 65 percent of
his passes and having a 12-2
touchdowns-to-interceptions
ratio.
Wilhelm is currently second in
career passing in the Pac-10, trail
ing only John Elway (by 1,219
yards) and is third in career total
offense, behind Stanford gradu
ates Elway and Jim Plunkett.
He holds OSU career and single
season records in passes, comple
tions, passing yardage, touch
downs, plays and total offense. "I
think Erik Wilhelm is playing
very well," Kragthorpe under
stated.
His leading targets are flanker
Robb Thomas and tight end Phil
Ross. Thomas has 37 catches and
is averaging 99.4 yards receiving
per game. Ross was third in the
Pac-10 in catches last season but,
as a victim of double-teaming, he
has only 16 grabs in 1988.
"I can't say enough about Robb
Thomas," Kragthorpe said. "He's
just a great kid. His motor's al
ways running; he's always ready
to play."
Kragthorpe also feels Ross is
having a very productive season.
"We're trying to get the ball to
him more [but defenses are keying
on him]," Kragthorpe said. "His
blocking has improved immensely
[also]."
Oregon State's offense, how
ever, will be facing a Cardinal de
fense coming off two very fine
performances. Stanford has given
up only 15 points the past two
weeks while causing 11 turnovers.
Defensive linemen Lester Archam
beau, Ray Huckestein and Scott


Ken Boer â€” Daily
Stanford's Scott Eschelman, a senior fullback, leads the Cardinal into tomorrow's game against Oregon State. Eschelman, an Oregon native, is
Stanford's second-leading rusher with 107 yards on the season.
Palmbush will probably become
familiar sights for Wilhelm before
the day is over.
Huckestein missed the last two
games due to a turf toe injury
but is expected to play this week.
Even without him last week,
though, the Cardinal put a lot of
pressure on Arizona State's quar
terbacks. Archambeau, an All-
America candidate, has played
very well all season, and
Palmbush, considered at the be
ginning of the season to be the
weak link on the line, was Stan
ford's co-defensive player of the
week last week.
He shared that honor with in
side linebacker Jono Tunney, who
led the team in tackles (for the
fourth time this season) with 12.
Tunney also had two interceptions
last week, while the team had a
total of five. Stanford has now
moved to fifth in the nation in
turnover margin, averaging plus
2.0 per game. Stanford also leads
the Pac-10 in that category, all of
which does not bode well for an
Oregon State team that threw
seven interceptions against Stan
ford in a 38-7 Cardinal win last
year.
An additional problem for Wil
helm and Co. is the fact that the

Stanford secondary has not been
beaten long all season. Kragthorpe
realizes what he is up against.
"Defensively, they don't make
many mistakes," he said. "You're
not going to beat Stanford be
cause they helped you."
Offensively, redshirt freshman
Jason Palumbis is making his
third start for the Cardinal.
Palumbis completed an astound
ing 72 percent of his passes last
week, and if he continues to im
prove at that rate, opposing
defenses will be in trouble.
Slotback Charlie Young is the
top receiving threat as he is
ranked in the league's top 10 in
both catches and receiving yar
dage. On the ground, fullback Jon
Volpe is averaging 95.7 yards
rushing per game, good for 26th
in the nation.
OSU's 3-4 defense is led by free
safety Andre Harris. Harris has
79 tackles in 1988, and, according
to Kragthorpe "really hasn't had
a bad game since he became a
starter the third game last year."
Of course, if your free safety is
your leading tackier, that doesn't
say much for the rest of your
defense. Defensive end Pellom
McDaniels and inside linebacker
Mike Matthews have also been
playing well, but will be hard
pressed to shut down the Cardi
nal.
