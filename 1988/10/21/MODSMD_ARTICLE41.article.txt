# WORLD SERIES WRAP-UP
## Dodgers win it all 
### 
OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -
With another helping of Her
shiser and a dash of destiny,
the Los Angeles Dodgers defied
all the odds and won the World
Series.
Unbelievable!
Orel Hershiser threw his sec
ond complete game in five days,
a four-hitter, and pitched out
of an eighth-inning jam as the
demeaned and depleted
Dodgers beat the Oakland Ath
letics 5-2 last night to wrap up
the Series in five games.
It was one of the most dra
matic turnarounds and biggest
upsets in baseball history.
The A's were heavy favorites,
picked by many to win in no
more than five. The Dodgers
did it instead.
The A's were the Bash

Bunch, the heavy hitters, the
winningest team in the majors
and the second highest-scoring
team. They hit only .177 in the
Series, 28 of 158, and were out
homered by the Dodgers 5-2.
Jose Canseco and Mark
McGwire went a combined 2-
for-36.
The Dodgers got just one at
bat from their big bat, Kirk
Gibson, a game-winning pinch
hit homer in Game 1. But
Mickey Hatcher and Mike
Davis, who had just three
homers between them during
the regular season, each hit
two-run home runs in the final
game; Hatcher hit two for the
Series.
"I think they just ran into

when we were pitching very well,"
said Hershiser, the Series' Most
Valuable Player.
Hershiser was human enough
to give up two runs for a change,
but that was still not enough for
the suddenly mightless A's.
"There's one big explanation.
Dodgers pitching shut us down,"
said A's manager Tony La Russa.
"The story goes back 100 years.
When you make quality pitches,
no matter how good a hitter you
are, you're not going to get hits."
Hershiser allowed just five
earned runs in his final 101 in
nings, including a season-closing,
all-time record 59 straight with
out allowing a run.
"I feel like I'm climbing a
mountain every time I'm out
there," Hershiser said. "It's very
tough to pitch in the big leagues.
It's a war out there."
The Dodgers, crippled by inju
ries to Gibson, Mike Marshall,
Mike Scioscia and John Tudor,
weren't expected to stay in the
same ballpark as the Athletics.
Instead, the Dodgers blew the
winningest team in the majors off
the field.
"You can't expect a whole lot
of runs from the lineup we put
out there," Hershiser said.

The homers by Hatcher and
Davis made it 4-1 in the fourth
inning, and that was plenty for
Hershiser, who pitched Los An
geles into the Series with a
shutout in Game 7 of the National
League playoffs against the
heavily-favored New York Mets
and then shut out Oakland on
three hits in Game 2.
It was the sixth World Series
championship for the Dodgers,
who became the first team to win
two championships in the 1980s,
their last one coming in 1981.
Los Angeles, the most active
team in the off-season, made the
moves work. They rebounded
from a 73-89 mark the last two
years, the greatest improvement
of any National League team to
win the World Series.
"For two years, we suffered a
great deal, and now the Dodgers
are back on top," said Dodger
manager Tom Lasorda. "They
have to be an influence for every
one in the world. They showed
you what you can do if you want
something bad enough."
Hershiser struck out nine and
walked four. He was toughest
when it mattered most, twice get
ting Canseco out with two run
ners on base.
Canseco grounded out to end
the third with Oakland trailing
2-1. In the eighth, after Stan
Javier's RBI the Ath
letics within 5-2, Hershiser

walked Dave Henderson and
brought Canseco to the plate as
the potential tying run.
But Hershiser got Canseco, who
led the majors in homers and RBI,
on a popup and struck out Dave

Parker to escape.
"I looked at the dugout and gave
them the high sign, like I'm OK,"
Hershiser said. "I know I got our
bench awfully nervous."

inning, and that was plenty for
Hershiser, who pitched Los An
geles into the Series with a
shutout in Game 7 of the National
League playoffs against the
heavily-favored New York Mets
and then shut out Oakland on
three hits in Game 2.
It was the sixth World Series
championship for the Dodgers,
who became the first team to win
two championships in the 1980s,
their last one coming in 1981.
Los Angeles, the most active
team in the off-season, made the
moves work. They rebounded
from a 73-89 mark the last two
years, the greatest improvement
of any National League team to
win the World Series.
"For two years, we suffered a
great deal, and now the Dodgers
are back on top," said Dodger
manager Tom Lasorda. "They
have to be an influence for every
one in the world. They showed
you what you can do if you want
something bad enough."
Hershiser struck out nine and
walked four. He was toughest
when it mattered most, twice get
ting Canseco out with two run
ners on base.
Canseco grounded out to end
the third with Oakland trailing
2-1. In the eighth, after Stan
Javier's RBI the Ath
letics within 5-2, Hershiser

walked Dave Henderson and
brought Canseco to the plate as
the potential tying run.
But Hershiser got Canseco, who
led the majors in homers and RBI,
on a popup and struck out Dave

Parker to escape.
"I looked at the dugout and gave
them the high sign, like I'm OK,"
Hershiser said. "I know I got our
bench awfully nervous."

Valuable Player award.
OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -
With another helping of Her
shiser and a dash of destiny,
the Los Angeles Dodgers defied
all the odds and won the World
Series.
Unbelievable!
Orel Hershiser threw his sec
ond complete game in five days,
a four-hitter, and pitched out
of an eighth-inning jam as the
demeaned and depleted
Dodgers beat the Oakland Ath
letics 5-2 last night to wrap up
the Series in five games.
It was one of the most dra
matic turnarounds and biggest
upsets in baseball history.
The A's were heavy favorites,
picked by many to win in no
more than five. The Dodgers
did it instead.
The A's were the Bash

Bunch, the heavy hitters, the
winningest team in the majors
and the second highest-scoring
team. They hit only .177 in the
Series, 28 of 158, and were out
homered by the Dodgers 5-2.
Jose Canseco and Mark
McGwire went a combined 2-
for-36.
The Dodgers got just one at
bat from their big bat, Kirk
Gibson, a game-winning pinch
hit homer in Game 1. But
Mickey Hatcher and Mike
Davis, who had just three
homers between them during
the regular season, each hit
two-run home runs in the final
game; Hatcher hit two for the
Series.
"I think they just ran into

when we were pitching very well,"
said Hershiser, the Series' Most
Valuable Player.
Hershiser was human enough
to give up two runs for a change,
but that was still not enough for
the suddenly mightless A's.
"There's one big explanation.
Dodgers pitching shut us down,"
said A's manager Tony La Russa.
"The story goes back 100 years.
When you make quality pitches,
no matter how good a hitter you
are, you're not going to get hits."
Hershiser allowed just five
earned runs in his final 101 in
nings, including a season-closing,
all-time record 59 straight with
out allowing a run.
"I feel like I'm climbing a
mountain every time I'm out
there," Hershiser said. "It's very
tough to pitch in the big leagues.
It's a war out there."
The Dodgers, crippled by inju
ries to Gibson, Mike Marshall,
Mike Scioscia and John Tudor,
weren't expected to stay in the
same ballpark as the Athletics.
Instead, the Dodgers blew the
winningest team in the majors off
the field.
"You can't expect a whole lot
of runs from the lineup we put
out there," Hershiser said.

The homers by Hatcher and
Davis made it 4-1 in the fourth
inning, and that was plenty for
Hershiser, who pitched Los An
geles into the Series with a
shutout in Game 7 of the National
League playoffs against the
heavily-favored New York Mets
and then shut out Oakland on
three hits in Game 2.
