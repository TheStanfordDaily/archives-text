### John Kirks Staff writer 
The Cardinal women's soccer
team's luck has finally expired.
The team's six-game winning
streak has ground to a halt, and
Stanford's exponentially increas
ing tally of season wins has ceased
to improve.

Pioneers 2, Cardinal 1
The Cal State-Hay ward
Pioneers arrived at the Farm, uni
mpressed by Stanford's recently
strong play. The Division II school
played Stanford even all the way,
keeping their hopes alive through
out the contest. At the end of 90
minutes of regulation play and 30
minutes of overtime action,
Hayward found itself victorious
by a 2-1 margin.
Both teams battled to a 0-0
halftime deuce. Ten minutes into
the second period, Hayward broke
loose. Suzanne Roberts, an ex
tremely small and scrappy
Pioneer forward took the ball on
the left wing and crossed to team
mate Cyndy Carlin. The ball
slipped right past Cardinal

defender Heather Mclntyre, and
Carlin cashed in on the opportu
nity.
Cal State took their 1-0 lead
with them all the way down to
the final moments of regulation
play. The Cal State bench con
verted into a chorus of hecklers
with cries such as "We've got this
one in the bucket" and "Only
three minutes left" resounding
from their ranks.
The Cardinal responded tena
ciously. With a mere 60 seconds
remaining in the contest, Beth
Egan hit a cutting Jennifer
Rowland with a great crossing
pass. Rowland needed no prod
ding; she immediately pounded a
shot that embarrassed Pioneer
goalie Kristen Colchico to knot the
score at 1-1.
Moments later, the whistle
sounded to end regulation play.
Hayward momentum was clearly
deflated and frustration began to
swell inside the team huddle. On
the Stanford side, excitement and
relief both ran rampant among
the Cardinal players, and the
team's spirit seemed to soar. In
the overtime period, however,
everything changed.

Gutsy play by Cardinal midfielder Denlse Denney, left, couldn't
prevent Hayward's upset victory yesterday at Harry Maloney Field.
