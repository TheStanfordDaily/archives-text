# Busy weekend slated for water polo

Wanted: tenacity.
Send to: deGuerre Pool, Stan
ford, CA, in care of Dante Det
tamanti.
After leading the two top teams
in the nation, California and
UCLA, by scores of 2-0 in the
second quarter, the Stanford
water polo team was unable to
hold on to its leads last weekend,
dropping both games to its Pacific
10 rivals.
The Stanford six cannot afford
any slip in intensity this week.
Host to both Long Beach State
and Southern California this
weekend, the third-rated Cardinal
squad must be able to maintain
its tenacity if it hopes to preserve
its national ranking.
"This is the biggest weekend of
the year. It's going to make or
break us. It is definitely a must
win situation," senior fieldman
Andrew Lawson said.
Although Stanford was defeated
by both the Bears and Bruins in
its last two contests, both squads
were ranked above the Cardinal,
so the team lost no ground in the
national standings. In fact, the
15-6 team gained, jumping from
fourth to third in this week's

coaches' poll.
Today and tomorrow, however,
the situation will be different. The
Cardinal has to be victorious over
No. 5 Long Beach and fourth
ranked USC if it hopes to remain
in the top trio.
"These games are even more
important than UCLA and Cal be
cause both squads are ranked
below us," Coach Dettamanti said.
"If we can keep our top-three
ranking we can get a good seeding
at NCAA's, and if we can get past
our first-round opponent any
thing can happen."
When the 49ers hit the waters
of deGuerre today at 3 p.m., it
will be anything but a sure victory
for the Cardinal. In fact, the last
time the two teams squared off
this season, at the UC-Irvine
Tournament in September, Long
Beach was the 9-8 victor.
In addition to maintaining its
intensity and producing offensive
ly, Stanford has to shut down 49er
two-meter man Cyle Kopp. Not
only does the 6-8 holeman tower
over most opponents, he scores
right over them as well. In the
teams' last meeting Kopp was the
49er offense, scoring four goals
and shooting from almost
anywhere he pleased.
"If we isolate him and shut him

out we should be able to win. Our
big mistake last time was letting
Cyle sboot — if he didn't score
he got kickouts," Lawson said.
The Cardinal is also looking to
be more productive offensively. Al
though the squad has outscored
its opponents 204-124 this year,
it has averaged only six goals a
game for its past three matches.

This is the biggest
weekend of the year.
It's going to make or
break us.'

"We need to score at least eight
goals a game. We've been averag
ing six against good teams, and
we need to manufacture one or
two more somewhere in the of
fense," Dettamanti said.
Saturday at 11 a.m. Stanford
will face off against Pac-10 rival
USC for the third time this year.
The Cardinal was the victor in
both previous meetings, defeating
the Trojans 10-6 in the consola
tion finals of the Northern Cali
fornia Tournament October 1, and

outscoring them 11-9 at the UCI
Tournament.
Dettamanti does not want to
place too much weight on the vic
tories, however, as both were in
tournaments and this is the
teams' first conference match-up
of the season. Coming off an upset
of the then-first-ranked Bruins
two weeks ago, the Trojans are
not likely to forget the defeats.
"They are going to be ready for
us," Dettamanti said. "USC is fa
mous for not playing well in tour
naments and doing very well in
Pac-10 contests, and the third
place ranking is going to be on
the line."
According to Lawson and soph
omore Greg Olson, the Cardinal
is going to need to go out hard
and maintain a lead, because al
though the Trojans are talented
the squad breaks down easily.
In addition to its Friday and
Saturday games, Stanford travels
to Stockton to take on University
of the Pacific Sunday. At 7-7, the
1 lth-ranked team should not give
the Cardinal much trouble.
"UOP should not be a problem,
but the game could be tough after
the two difficult games Friday and
Saturday. Our emotions will prob
ably be spent by Sunday," Det
tamanti said.

"We need to score at least eight
goals a game. We've been averag
ing six against good teams, and
we need to manufacture one or
two more somewhere in the of
fense," Dettamanti said.
Saturday at 11 a.m. Stanford
will face off against Pac-10 rival
USC for the third time this year.
The Cardinal was the victor in
both previous meetings, defeating
the Trojans 10-6 in the consola
tion finals of the Northern Cali
fornia Tournament October 1, and

outscoring them 11-9 at the UCI
Tournament.
Dettamanti does not want to
place too much weight on the vic
tories, however, as both were in
tournaments and this is the
teams' first conference match-up
of the season. Coming off an upset
of the then-first-ranked Bruins
two weeks ago, the Trojans are
not likely to forget the defeats.
"They are going to be ready for
us," Dettamanti said. "USC is fa
mous for not playing well in tour
naments and doing very well in
Pac-10 contests, and the third
place ranking is going to be on
the line."
According to Lawson and soph
omore Greg Olson, the Cardinal
is going to need to go out hard
and maintain a lead, because al
though the Trojans are talented
the squad breaks down easily.
In addition to its Friday and
Saturday games, Stanford travels
to Stockton to take on University
of the Pacific Sunday. At 7-7, the
1 lth-ranked team should not give
the Cardinal much trouble.
"UOP should not be a problem,
but the game could be tough after
the two difficult games Friday and
Saturday. Our emotions will prob
ably be spent by Sunday," Det
tamanti said.

Stanford's Andrew Lawson passes against UCLA. The water polo team
plays three matches in three days this weekend.
Wanted: tenacity.
Send to: deGuerre Pool, Stan
ford, CA, in care of Dante Det
tamanti.
After leading the two top teams
in the nation, California and
UCLA, by scores of 2-0 in the
second quarter, the Stanford
water polo team was unable to
hold on to its leads last weekend,
dropping both games to its Pacific
10 rivals.
The Stanford six cannot afford
any slip in intensity this week.
Host to both Long Beach State
and Southern California this
weekend, the third-rated Cardinal
squad must be able to maintain
its tenacity if it hopes to preserve
its national ranking.
"This is the biggest weekend of
the year. It's going to make or
break us. It is definitely a must
win situation," senior fieldman
Andrew Lawson said.
Although Stanford was defeated
by both the Bears and Bruins in
its last two contests, both squads
were ranked above the Cardinal,
so the team lost no ground in the
national standings. In fact, the
15-6 team gained, jumping from
fourth to third in this week's

coaches' poll.
Today and tomorrow, however,
the situation will be different. The
Cardinal has to be victorious over
No. 5 Long Beach and fourth
ranked USC if it hopes to remain
in the top trio.
"These games are even more
important than UCLA and Cal be
cause both squads are ranked
below us," Coach Dettamanti said.
"If we can keep our top-three
ranking we can get a good seeding
at NCAA's, and if we can get past
our first-round opponent any
thing can happen."
When the 49ers hit the waters
of deGuerre today at 3 p.m., it
will be anything but a sure victory
for the Cardinal. In fact, the last
time the two teams squared off
this season, at the UC-Irvine
Tournament in September, Long
Beach was the 9-8 victor.
In addition to maintaining its
intensity and producing offensive
ly, Stanford has to shut down 49er
two-meter man Cyle Kopp. Not
only does the 6-8 holeman tower
over most opponents, he scores
right over them as well. In the
teams' last meeting Kopp was the
49er offense, scoring four goals
and shooting from almost
anywhere he pleased.
"If we isolate him and shut him

out we should be able to win. Our
big mistake last time was letting
Cyle sboot — if he didn't score
he got kickouts," Lawson said.
The Cardinal is also looking to
be more productive offensively. Al
though the squad has outscored
its opponents 204-124 this year,
it has averaged only six goals a
game for its past three matches.

This is the biggest
weekend of the year.
It's going to make or
break us.'
