# Wildcats, Sun Devils invade volleyball's lair
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
The halftime show is over; now
the real competition begins. Com
ing off an easy roadtrip to Oregon
last weekend, the Stanford wom
en's volleyball team will start the
second round of Pacific 10 Con
ference play when the second
place Cardinal hosts Arizona
tonight at 7:30 in Maples Pavilion
and Arizona State tomorrow.
Stanford, 16-1 overall and 8-1
in the Pac-10, is currently ranked
No. 2 nationally behind league
leading UCLA. Arizona and Ari
zona State hold the fifth and sixth
spots in the conference and are
rated 17th and 18th, respectively.
"They've been playing really
well," Stanford Coach Don Shaw
said of the Cardinal's opposition.
"They're both real good teams.
This is the weekend where it's
just one right after another —
you don't have one easy one and
one tough one that you can really
focus on. This is one where we
have to be ready to go both
nights."
The Wildcats will be more than
ready to pounce when they hit
the Maples floor. Fresh off a tour
nament victory in the Tucson Hil
ton East Volleyball Classic, Ari
zona is playing consistently and
is a team on the rise.
The squad is also hungry for a
piece of the Cardinal. Stanford
has yet to relinquish a match to
Arizona in Pac-10 play and leads
the lifetime series by an over
whelming 15-1 margin. If the Car
dinal's trip into the Wildcat den
last month is any indication, how
ever, Stanford may well have a
fight with a very ferocious foe.
"Arizona gave us a real tough
match down there that went five
games," Shaw said. "We didn't
think we played particularly well
when we were down there, and I

hope we feel like we can play them
better this time."
The main reason for Arizona's
animated attack is Terry Lauch
ner, the younger sister of former
Stanford star, Ail-American and
U.S. National Team setter Craig.
Possessing the same competitive
instinct and powerful hitting,
Lauchner has given opposing
defenses a fair amount of trouble.
"Friday night, you definitely
have to look at Terry Lauchner,
because she had 32 kills against
us down there in Arizona," Shaw
said. "We made her look like an
Ail-American, and I think that
should we play better we will do
a better job on her. But she's
having a great year for them."

'I would look for great
volleyball on both
sides — maybe not
the level of a
Stanford-Hawaii
match, but not too far
off:
— Don Shaw

Wildcat setter Mary Linton has
also helped the Wildcats' efforts,
adding a big block and sure set
ting, while Kelly Waage has
blocked well enough on her own
to top the Pac-10 in the category.
But the true star visitor to the
Farm this weekend is Arizona
State's Christy Nore, a strong
candidate for All-Pac-10 and All-
America honors. Reminiscent of
Sun Devil stars of years past, the
senior outside hitter leads her
team in both kills and digs and
is currently hitting a respectable
.277.
"Christy Nore is the one

mainstay back from the teams of
two and three years ago when they
were real strong," Shaw said.
"They also have a real solid
lineup, though, but Christy Nore
is a really good all-around player:
She digs a lot of balls, plays great
defense, is a strong hitter and a
really good athlete."
Nore may well meet her match
in Kristin Klein, Stanford's phe
nomenal freshman. Jointly hold
ing the top spot on the Pac-10
kills-per-game list, Klein has de
veloped into an extremely potent
hitter and an equally skillful de
fensive player.
Recently, however, Stanford's
strength has been in the play of
its talented middle blockers.
Starters Amy Cooper and Laura
Olesen are rated third and fourth
in the league in blocking and have
been a big reason that Stanford
has outblocked every other team
in the Pac-10.
With talent abounding on all
fronts, the stage is set for a week
end of intense action. "I would
look for great volleyball on both
sides — maybe not the level of a
Stanford-Hawaii match, but not
too far off," Shaw added. "They're
both top-20 teams, and we're play
ing well."

postseason action.
Calling the play-by-play will be
Adam Fogelson, the acclaimed color
man for Stanford football and the
vagabond voice of Stanford basketball.

reporter, will join Fogelson with color

Lara Asper sets senior middle blocker Laura Olesen. Asper is currently ranked second In the Pac-10 In
assists at 12.09 per game, while Olesen is fourth in the league in blocks.
The halftime show is over; now
the real competition begins. Com
ing off an easy roadtrip to Oregon
last weekend, the Stanford wom
en's volleyball team will start the
second round of Pacific 10 Con
ference play when the second
place Cardinal hosts Arizona
tonight at 7:30 in Maples Pavilion
and Arizona State tomorrow.
Stanford, 16-1 overall and 8-1
in the Pac-10, is currently ranked
No. 2 nationally behind league
leading UCLA. Arizona and Ari
zona State hold the fifth and sixth
spots in the conference and are
rated 17th and 18th, respectively.
"They've been playing really
well," Stanford Coach Don Shaw
said of the Cardinal's opposition.
"They're both real good teams.
This is the weekend where it's
just one right after another —
you don't have one easy one and
one tough one that you can really
focus on. This is one where we
have to be ready to go both
nights."
The Wildcats will be more than
ready to pounce when they hit
the Maples floor. Fresh off a tour
nament victory in the Tucson Hil
ton East Volleyball Classic, Ari
zona is playing consistently and
is a team on the rise.
The squad is also hungry for a
piece of the Cardinal. Stanford
has yet to relinquish a match to
Arizona in Pac-10 play and leads
the lifetime series by an over
whelming 15-1 margin. If the Car
dinal's trip into the Wildcat den
last month is any indication, how
ever, Stanford may well have a
fight with a very ferocious foe.
"Arizona gave us a real tough
match down there that went five
games," Shaw said. "We didn't
think we played particularly well
when we were down there, and I

hope we feel like we can play them
better this time."
The main reason for Arizona's
animated attack is Terry Lauch
ner, the younger sister of former
Stanford star, Ail-American and
U.S. National Team setter Craig.
Possessing the same competitive
instinct and powerful hitting,
Lauchner has given opposing
defenses a fair amount of trouble.
"Friday night, you definitely
have to look at Terry Lauchner,
because she had 32 kills against
us down there in Arizona," Shaw
said. "We made her look like an
Ail-American, and I think that
should we play better we will do
a better job on her. But she's
having a great year for them."

'I would look for great
volleyball on both
sides — maybe not
the level of a
Stanford-Hawaii
match, but not too far
off:
— Don Shaw

Wildcat setter Mary Linton has
also helped the Wildcats' efforts,
adding a big block and sure set
ting, while Kelly Waage has
blocked well enough on her own
to top the Pac-10 in the category.
But the true star visitor to the
Farm this weekend is Arizona
State's Christy Nore, a strong
candidate for All-Pac-10 and All-
America honors. Reminiscent of
Sun Devil stars of years past, the
senior outside hitter leads her
team in both kills and digs and
is currently hitting a respectable
.277.
"Christy Nore is the one

mainstay back from the teams of
two and three years ago when they
were real strong," Shaw said.
"They also have a real solid
lineup, though, but Christy Nore
is a really good all-around player:
She digs a lot of balls, plays great
defense, is a strong hitter and a
really good athlete."
Nore may well meet her match
in Kristin Klein, Stanford's phe
nomenal freshman. Jointly hold
ing the top spot on the Pac-10
kills-per-game list, Klein has de
veloped into an extremely potent
hitter and an equally skillful de
fensive player.
Recently, however, Stanford's
strength has been in the play of
its talented middle blockers.
Starters Amy Cooper and Laura
Olesen are rated third and fourth
in the league in blocking and have
been a big reason that Stanford
has outblocked every other team
in the Pac-10.
With talent abounding on all
fronts, the stage is set for a week
end of intense action. "I would
look for great volleyball on both
sides — maybe not the level of a
Stanford-Hawaii match, but not
too far off," Shaw added. "They're
both top-20 teams, and we're play
ing well."
