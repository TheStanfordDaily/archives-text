# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Editor's note: Today, The Stanford Daily
begins a new feature: "Athletes of the Week."
Each week, a six-member staff will select a
male and female whose performances in the
previous week (Mon.-Sun.) were a cut above
the rest.
This week's selections are Lisa Sime of
the women's soccer team and Jono Tunney
of the football team.
Sime, a 5-foot-6 sophomore forward from
Miami, Fla., scored the lone goal in the
Cardinal's 1-0 victory at San Francisco State

Saturday.
Sime was subbed in with approximately
10 minutes remaining in the scoreless con
test. ,
With about four minutes to play, Sime
took the ball on the right side, beat one
defender and placed the ball in the corner
of the cage just outside the goalkeeper's
reach.
The goal was Sime's team-leading sixth
of the season and gave her a total of 13
points. Stanford has allowed only nine goals
this year while scoring 29.
The victory over the Gators was the Car
dinal's sixth consecutive win and propelled
them to a No. 15 national ranking this
week. It was the first-ever top-20 appearance
in the five-year history of the women's soc
cer program.
After suffering a defeat at the hands of
the Cal State-Hayward Pioneers, the Car
dinal's record stands at 9-4-1.

Tunney, a 6-2, 235-pound junior inside
linebacker from Mill Valley, Calif., led the
Cardinal with 14 tackles in Stanford's 24-3
win over Arizona State Saturday. It was the
fourth time Tunney led the team in that
category this season.
Tunney snared two Sun Devil passes,
while his teammates picked off three others;
and the defense set the tone for the game
from the outset.
It was the first time since 1981, when
the Cardinal decimated the Ducks of Oregon
42-3, that Stanford allowed as few as three
points in a game.
Tunney also sacked ASU's Daniel Ford,
putting him second on the team in that

category behind Rob Hinckley who has five.
The five interceptions helped push the
Cardinal to fifth in the nation in turnover
margin at plus 2.0 per game. Tunney re
turned one of his pickoffs 31 yards â€” the
second-longest interception return this year
for Stanford.
The win was Stanford's first in Pacific
10 Conference play this season and raised
the squad's overall mark 3-3. The Cardinal
hopes to add another Pac-10 win Saturday
when the squad meets the Oregon State
Beavers at Stanford Stadium at 1:00 p.m.
