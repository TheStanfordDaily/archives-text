# Hockey heads east
## 
### Greg Gottesman Staff writer 
People have overcome greater
obstacles.
David killed Goliath.
The U.S. Olympic Hockey Team
upset the Russians in 1980.
Who would have bet on Stan
ford's basketball squad against
Arizona last year?
Indeed, Stanford's field hockey
team is going to need a little magic
— maybe even a minor miracle
— as they travel east this week
to take on the nation's best field
hockey squads, including Old
Dominion and North Carolina,
the No. 1 and No. 2 teams in the
country, respectively.
To make matters worse, the
Cardinal needs a win or at least
a tie to have any hope of making
the NCAA Regionals Nov. 12.
After tying Chico State 1-1 last
Saturday, Stanford knocked itself
out of contention for an automatic
berth in the NCAA Champion
ships.
Chico State, which beat Stan
ford 1-0 earlier this year, will
receive an automatic invitation to
the regionals because the Wildcats
edged University of the Pacific,
1-0 Wednesday to win the NorPac
conference title. To qualify for a
wild card, the Cardinal now must
be ranked in the top 12 nationally.
Beating or tying top-ranked Old
Dominion or North Carolina will
accomplish this task.
First things first, however, as
Stanford must tackle Temple, the
No. 12 team in the nation, Sat

urday at 10 a.m. on Temple's
home field.
"We have to beat Temple and
Virginia Commonwealth for
sure," Stanford Coach Sheryl
Johnson said. "It would be really
nice to play well against Old
Dominion and UNC.
"We have had three good prac
tices. I think the players are ready
to take advantage of this chance
to get into the playoffs," Johnson
added. "It is much different this
time because, in the past three
years, we won the conference.
This time we have to play well
back east and get a national
ranking that will allow us to par
ticpate in the NCAA's."
Senior goalie Karen Jones, a
1987 All-American, commented
"I'm expecting a lot of shots from
Old Dominion and North
Carolina. I want to keep the score
low or shut them out. Our chances
are reasonably good. We haven't
seen them play, and they haven't
seen us. If we play well .. . you
never know."
"I think we have a good chance
to show what we are really made
of. Back east, we'll get a fresh
start. I think we are going to
surprise them," freshman Laura
Romeu added. "Hopefully, we will
get some quick scores in the first
half and hold them with our stel
lar defense."
Johnson, Jones and Romeu all
said the possibilty of senior Alison
Smith, a two-time all-American.
returning to the lineup from her
back injury has given the team
an added boost.
