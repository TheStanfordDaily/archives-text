# Soccer hosts Santa Clara

### David Hirning Staff writer 
After last Sunday's disappointing loss to
California, it would seem that the Cardinal
men's soccer team would have little to play
for when they take the field this weekend.
Stanford is 8-8, and has little chance for
a postseason berth.
But when the team on the opposite side
of the line is Santa Clara, no other moti
vation but victory is necessary.
Stanford renews its heated soccer rivalry
with the Broncos this Sunday at 2 p.m.
when the two squads square off in a Pacific
Soccer Conference game at Maloney Field.
Santa Clara enters with a significantly
better record overall (7-2-4), but is in a
similar downswing after losing to Portland
in overtime Saturday 1-0, and tying Wash
ington 1-1 on Monday. Santa Clara's com
petition has been quite stiff thus far,
leading to a ranking of as high as 11th in
one national poll. They are third-ranked
in the West.
The Broncos beat Indiana 2-1, at a time
when the Hoosiers were the top-ranked
team in the country, and then tied No.
8-ranked Evansville in the same tourna
ment. As far as common opponents go,
Santa Clara beat UCLA and tied Cal, two
teams Stanford has dropped 1-0 decisions
to this year.
The one area where the Cardinal has
the edge at this point in the season would
be conference record, Stanford's 3-2 mark
besting the Broncos 1-1-1 showing thus far

this year. If Stanford were to win this
game, it would lock up the Pacific Soccer
Conference title.
While this would be a boost for the Car
dinal, as no current player has finished
higher than second in his career here, just
defeating their rivals from the south would
be enough. Stanford last beat the Broncos
in a regular season game in 1985.
"There's a certain animosity between us
and them, built up over the years," junior
Mark Semioli said. "The teams don't like
each other, and it goes from all the players
on up to the coaching staff."
This type of game seems to bring out
the best in the Cardinal squad. In a similar
contest versus a highly-ranked, local league
team (USF), Stanford was able to come
out ahead in two OTs, 1-0.
In a season in which it has seemed to
let down against inferior teams (losses to
USIU, California and Cal State-Fullerton),
the Cardinal has played the powerful
squads tough.
"The teams that are ranked we seem to
get up for much better," forward Todd
Caven observed. "We somehow concentrate
more when there's a good team out there
— it's hard to explain."
Another tendency is for the games
against good teams to be very physical.
The USF game is a case in point, as three
Cardinal players went down with injuries
and the two clubs were whistled for 37
penalties combined. But this game could
