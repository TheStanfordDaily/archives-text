# Soccer hosts Santa Clara
## 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
After last Sunday's disappointing loss to
California, it would seem that the Cardinal
men's soccer team would have little to play
for when they take the field this weekend.
Stanford is 8-8, and has little chance for
a postseason berth.
But when the team on the opposite side
of the line is Santa Clara, no other moti
vation but victory is necessary.
Stanford renews its heated soccer rivalry
with the Broncos this Sunday at 2 p.m.
when the two squads square off in a Pacific
Soccer Conference game at Maloney Field.
Santa Clara enters with a significantly
better record overall (7-2-4), but is in a
similar downswing after losing to Portland
in overtime Saturday 1-0, and tying Wash
ington 1-1 on Monday. Santa Clara's com
petition has been quite stiff thus far,
leading to a ranking of as high as 11th in
one national poll. They are third-ranked
in the West.
The Broncos beat Indiana 2-1, at a time
when the Hoosiers were the top-ranked
team in the country, and then tied No.
8-ranked Evansville in the same tourna
ment. As far as common opponents go,
Santa Clara beat UCLA and tied Cal, two
teams Stanford has dropped 1-0 decisions
to this year.
The one area where the Cardinal has
the edge at this point in the season would
be conference record, Stanford's 3-2 mark
besting the Broncos 1-1-1 showing thus far

this year. If Stanford were to win this
game, it would lock up the Pacific Soccer
Conference title.
While this would be a boost for the Car
dinal, as no current player has finished
higher than second in his career here, just
defeating their rivals from the south would
be enough. Stanford last beat the Broncos
in a regular season game in 1985.
"There's a certain animosity between us
and them, built up over the years," junior
Mark Semioli said. "The teams don't like
each other, and it goes from all the players
on up to the coaching staff."
This type of game seems to bring out
the best in the Cardinal squad. In a similar
contest versus a highly-ranked, local league
team (USF), Stanford was able to come
out ahead in two OTs, 1-0.
In a season in which it has seemed to
let down against inferior teams (losses to
USIU, California and Cal State-Fullerton),
the Cardinal has played the powerful
squads tough.
"The teams that are ranked we seem to
get up for much better," forward Todd
Caven observed. "We somehow concentrate
more when there's a good team out there
— it's hard to explain."
Another tendency is for the games
against good teams to be very physical.
The USF game is a case in point, as three
Cardinal players went down with injuries
and the two clubs were whistled for 37
penalties combined. But this game could

Fullback Mark Semloll has seen the men's soccer team go through more than Its share of trouble spots this season
be even more brutal.
"It will probably be the most
physical game we play all year —
even more than USF," Semioli
said.
The game will key on the de
fense, and especially which team
can jump on top. A scrappy team,
Santa Clara in known for their
defensive strategy of switching
everyone to one side of the field
to stop a downfield run. This year,
goalkeeper Eric Yamamoto has a
.500 goals against ratio, with six
shutouts. Stanford's Chris Hel
ling goes into the game at 1.125
and five, respectively.
"Both teams have good defense,
but Santa Clara prides themselves
in their defense. This year, they've
been in the top five to 10 teams
in the country in goals allowed,"
said Semioli, who will be in charge
of the Stanford defensive corps.
Senior fullback Jim Killfoil will
draw the task of marking Santa
Clara's best player, senior David
Palick. Palick has three goals and
five assists on the year. Junior

Steve Robertson also does damage
for the Broncos — he has three
goals and six assists to lead the
team in scoring.
To win, Stanford will almost
certainly have to score first. The
Cardinal has scored in only two
of its eight losses this year, and
seems to lose vital intensity once
it gets behind.
"The first goal will be key.
We've played them in the past,
and the games were always close.
Once one team scores, its tough,"
Semioli said. "And it seems that
this season, every time we scored
first, we won."
A final factor will be Stanford's
relief at getting away from Cal's
turf for the rest of the year and
back to the familiar grass of home.
The Cardinal is 0-3 on turf, but
has won two of its last three home
games.
Santa Clara had a couple
thousand fans at last year's 2-0
victory over Stanford, in a match
the rival school builds as their
"Big Game." Caven noted that it
will be good to play Santa Clara
"in front of our fans," as the
booters try and win a division
title and keep the Broncos out of
the playoffs at the same time.

the playoffs at the same time.
After last Sunday's disappointing loss to
California, it would seem that the Cardinal
men's soccer team would have little to play
for when they take the field this weekend.
Stanford is 8-8, and has little chance for
a postseason berth.
But when the team on the opposite side
of the line is Santa Clara, no other moti
vation but victory is necessary.
Stanford renews its heated soccer rivalry
with the Broncos this Sunday at 2 p.m.
when the two squads square off in a Pacific
Soccer Conference game at Maloney Field.
Santa Clara enters with a significantly
better record overall (7-2-4), but is in a
similar downswing after losing to Portland
in overtime Saturday 1-0, and tying Wash
ington 1-1 on Monday. Santa Clara's com
petition has been quite stiff thus far,
leading to a ranking of as high as 11th in
one national poll. They are third-ranked
in the West.
The Broncos beat Indiana 2-1, at a time
when the Hoosiers were the top-ranked
team in the country, and then tied No.
8-ranked Evansville in the same tourna
ment. As far as common opponents go,
Santa Clara beat UCLA and tied Cal, two
teams Stanford has dropped 1-0 decisions
to this year.
The one area where the Cardinal has
the edge at this point in the season would
be conference record, Stanford's 3-2 mark
besting the Broncos 1-1-1 showing thus far

this year. If Stanford were to win this
game, it would lock up the Pacific Soccer
Conference title.
While this would be a boost for the Car
dinal, as no current player has finished
higher than second in his career here, just
defeating their rivals from the south would
be enough. Stanford last beat the Broncos
in a regular season game in 1985.
"There's a certain animosity between us
and them, built up over the years," junior
Mark Semioli said. "The teams don't like
each other, and it goes from all the players
on up to the coaching staff."
This type of game seems to bring out
the best in the Cardinal squad. In a similar
contest versus a highly-ranked, local league
team (USF), Stanford was able to come
out ahead in two OTs, 1-0.
In a season in which it has seemed to
let down against inferior teams (losses to
USIU, California and Cal State-Fullerton),
the Cardinal has played the powerful
squads tough.
"The teams that are ranked we seem to
get up for much better," forward Todd
Caven observed. "We somehow concentrate
more when there's a good team out there
— it's hard to explain."
Another tendency is for the games
against good teams to be very physical.
The USF game is a case in point, as three
Cardinal players went down with injuries
and the two clubs were whistled for 37
penalties combined. But this game could

Fullback Mark Semloll has seen the men's soccer team go through more than Its share of trouble spots this season
be even more brutal.
"It will probably be the most
physical game we play all year —
even more than USF," Semioli
said.
The game will key on the de
fense, and especially which team
can jump on top. A scrappy team,
Santa Clara in known for their
defensive strategy of switching
everyone to one side of the field
to stop a downfield run. This year,
goalkeeper Eric Yamamoto has a
.500 goals against ratio, with six
shutouts. Stanford's Chris Hel
ling goes into the game at 1.125
and five, respectively.
"Both teams have good defense,
but Santa Clara prides themselves
in their defense. This year, they've
been in the top five to 10 teams
in the country in goals allowed,"
said Semioli, who will be in charge
of the Stanford defensive corps.
Senior fullback Jim Killfoil will
draw the task of marking Santa
Clara's best player, senior David
Palick. Palick has three goals and
five assists on the year. Junior

Steve Robertson also does damage
for the Broncos — he has three
goals and six assists to lead the
team in scoring.
To win, Stanford will almost
certainly have to score first. The
Cardinal has scored in only two
of its eight losses this year, and
seems to lose vital intensity once
it gets behind.
"The first goal will be key.
We've played them in the past,
and the games were always close.
Once one team scores, its tough,"
Semioli said. "And it seems that
this season, every time we scored
first, we won."
A final factor will be Stanford's
relief at getting away from Cal's
turf for the rest of the year and
back to the familiar grass of home.
The Cardinal is 0-3 on turf, but
has won two of its last three home
games.
Santa Clara had a couple
thousand fans at last year's 2-0
victory over Stanford, in a match
the rival school builds as their
"Big Game." Caven noted that it
will be good to play Santa Clara
"in front of our fans," as the
booters try and win a division
title and keep the Broncos out of
the playoffs at the same time.
