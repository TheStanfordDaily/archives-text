Unlike the Oakland Athletics,
the Greek of the Week is back for
more. After a brutal week in
which the panel correctly called
only 40 of 70 games, this week's
schedule is at least as difficult.
Topping the charts is (under
the believe-it-or-not category) the
Guest Greek, thanks to Donald
Kennedy's 7-3 performance last
week. Wearing the Guest Greek's
hat this week is assistant baseball
coach Dean Stotz. Picking upsets
of Temple over California ("I hate
the Bears," he said. "I'll never
pick the Bears in any game.") and
Oregon over Washington, he fears
his "picks with my heart, not with
my logic," might not keep the
Guest Greek on top. "I think I
can drop us right back," he said.
The leading competition in
cludes Dave Earnest, Mark Ro
gowsky and Bruce Sarkisian, all
only one game back. The so-called

experts are divided on
Washington-Oregon, Indiana-
Michigan, and, of course, the Ivy
Leagues, so who knows what will
happen?
The only certainty is that sports
editor Cameron Macky is still in
last place. "All right, so I'm lame.
So what?" he said. Macky is
hoping the upstart (and unde
feated) Hoosiers will do a number
on old Blue and that the Crimson
will clobber Princeton. "How can
you pick a team [Princeton] that
lost to Columbia?" he asks.
Rogowsky has a better reason.
"My brother said that Harvard
has better team speed than
Princeton and that's why I picked
them," he said. Rogowsky, last
week's leader, is feeling the heat
to get ahead of the Guest Greek
and may be acting a bit irration
ally. Anyway, see you next time.
