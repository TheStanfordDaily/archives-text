# 'Groups of color' unite
## Ujamaa incidents catalyze new ethnic coalition 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
This week's publicity about incidents of
racism at Ujamaa House hastened plans
to create a new coalition of ethnic minority
student groups at Stanford.
The "Students of Color Coalition" met
for the first time late Wednesday night in
Old Union's Native American Activities
Center. The meeting was closed to the press.
The new coalition is comprised of Stan
ford's four most politically active minority
student groups — the Black Student Union,
the Asian-American Student Association,
Stanford American Indian Organization
and MEChA, a Chicano student organiza
tion.
Members of Hillel, a Jewish student
group, were also present to voice solidarity
with the other groups, although they are
not a part of the coalition.
Minority student leaders had planned to
unite even before the discovery of the
Ujamaa incidents, according to BSU Sec
retary Louis Jackson, a sophomore.
However, the incidents "ignited people
to have a sense of urgency" and accelerated
the formation of the coalition, Jackson said.
The coalition adds to the Peoples' Plat
form, a political party began in 1987 made
up of the above ethnic groups and others,
like Students United for a Democratic Ed
ucation. As of yesterday, is was still unclear
how the missions of the two groups differ.
In one possible explanation, BSU Secre
tary Louis Jackson said the new coalition
gave him hope the groups could "reignite"
the agenda of the Peoples' Platform. A year
and a half ago, on the occasion of the
beginning of the Centennial celebration, the
platform put forth a list of demands aimed
at improving the quality of minority stu
dent life here.
Other groups who contributed to the
Peoples' Platform agenda were Hillel, SAIO

and the Gay and Lesbian Association at
Stanford.
Their demands resulted in last year's
creation of the University Committee on
Minority Issues.
Jackson said the Students of Color Co
alition is being organized at the "perfect
time" because a final UCMI report is sched
uled for December.
The incidents at Ujamaa were publicized
Monday after a tense house meet
ing Sunday afternoon left resi
dents "shocked and traumatized."
Before the house meeting, two
house residents confessed that
they had drawn a derogatory
caricature of a black man on a
poster of Ludwig van Beethoven.
There are still no suspects in a
separate case where the word
"nigger" was scrawled across a
party announcement. Both
posters were found in Ujamaa,

the black theme house.
Last night the Students of Color
Coalition worked on a press
release dealing in part with those
incidents, according to sophomore
Tracey Leßeau, press representa
tive for SAIO. She said the release
would be ready today, but declined
to comment further about it.
MEChA member Gina Hernan
dez, a senior, said the immediate
plans for the coalition are not yet
finalized. But she said their plan
ning commision, appointed Wed
nesday night, was working on a
public "press conference rally."
