# Searching for the elusive neutrino
## 
### 
The winners of the Nobel Prize for Physics de
veloped a new tool for studying the weak nuclear
force, which affects the radioactive decay of
atoms. They were able, for the first time, to
generate a beam of neutrinos, fundamental par
ticles of matter with no electrical charge and no
detectable mass, whose behavior could be used
to analyze the weak force. A particle accelerator
produced high-energy protons that were fired at

a metal beryllium block, producing a shower of
protons, neutrons and pions. The pions often
decayed into muons and the needed high-energy
neutrinos. A thick steel wall prohibited the pas
sage of other particles using strong or electro
magnetic forces In the steel, allowing only the
neutrinos to emerge and be detected by the alu
minum plates at the end.
