# Ujamaa incidents hit national media
## 
### Glen Tripp Staff writer 
Word of the recent racial events at
Ujamaa House has passed from the
halls of the University to the Bay Area
and the nation. Newspapers and TV
channels across the country are picking
up on the incidents of this month, in
which two racist fliers were posted in
Stanford's black theme house.
The San Francisco Chronicle was the
first outside newspaper to cover the
incidents. A headline on page two of
the Oct. 18 Chronicle stated, "Probe
of Racism at Stanford." The lengthy
article was accurate and correctly iden
tified the main issues involved.
An article in the Oct. 19 edition of
the San Francisco Examiner, however,
was not so accurate. For starters, the
article referred to Ujamaa as a frater
nity. Also, Gustav Heldt, one of two
freshmen who produced one of the
fliers, was reported to be a resi
dent at a "fraternity" next door
to Ujamaa. Heldt was a resident
of Naranja House, but he has
since left the dormitory.
The Examiner's article repl
icated errors from an earlier story
put out by the Associated Press.
Also on the local scene, San
Francisco ABC affiliate KGO-TV,
Channel 7, covered the events on
its evening news program earlier
this week.

On the national scene, USA
Today is investigating the inci
dents for an article about racial
conflicts on college campuses
across the country.
AP is also sending reporters to
Stanford next week to follow up
on the story, according to an AP
editor. "If we find a story, we'll
release it,"the editor said. An AP
report would be released nation
ally, and would probably generate
still more coverage about the
Stanford campus, as more news
papers and TV networks learn of
the incidents.
