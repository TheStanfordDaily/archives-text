Relations between black and Jewish
people in the United States can best
be understood by looking at the internal
dynamics of each group, according to
Assoc. History Prof. Clayborne Carson.
In a Wednesday discussion sponsored
by the Stanford Student Jewish Appeal,
the Jewish Community Federation and
the Hillel Foundation, Carson told
about 25 students that the long legacy
of tension between black and Jewish
people is due in part to the struggle
for power within each group.
"There is a pattern that any black-
Jewish coalition is not really a coalition
of groups, but rather a relationship
between a segment of leadership class
in each of these groups," said Carson,
who referred to studies indicating that
black and Jewish people most likely to
become involved in coalitions also tend
to be the most assimilated.
Black political leaders are polarized
into two groups locked in a power
struggle: those espousing a somewhat
nationalist, separatist agenda and those
who have more liberal, coalition
oriented views, Carson said.
He explained that there are similar
strands in the Jewish community â€”
conservative, separatist Jewish people
versus more liberal-oriented Jewish
