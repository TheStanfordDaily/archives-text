# Sinclair anchors solid offensive line
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Of all the players in football,
offensive linemen typically get the
least credit for the important job
they do. In front of every great
quarterback is a great line offer
ing him the luxury of time to
make the big plays, yet the ac
colades and fame are traditionally
reserved for the QB alone.
Nonetheless, despite the hand
icap of his unglamorous position,
in his four years on the Farm,
center Andy Sinclair has become
a shining star of the Stanford
squad. A starter in every game
since he donned a Stanford uni
form, as well as a perennial can
didate for All-America honors, the
senior has received both much ac
claim and the undying respect of
his coaches and teammates.
Somehow, in the midst of all
the hoopla, Sinclair remains an
athlete unaffected by the trim
mings of his success. Although his
6-foot-3, 280-pound figure might
suggest otherwise, he is as con
genial and ingratiating off the
field as he is intimidating on it.
"Intense, I guess that'd be one

good word for him," sophomore
quarterback Jason Palumbis said.
"He's a very intense fellow, but
he also knows how to have fun
off the field. When he's on the
field it's business, and he knows
how to have fun while taking care
of business. He's a great center
and a great athlete, but most of
all a great guy."
Sinclair is also the consummate
team player, always focusing on
the Cardinal's accomplishments
as a team rather than basking in
personal glory. Although Sinclair
is frequently singled out for his
individual accomplishments, he
sees himself as but one-fifth of a
cohesive offensive line that strives
to improve as a unit.
And improve the quintet has,
dramatically so. After a season of
competition and spring practices
to solidify it, the offensive line
has become the anchor of a some
times turbulent offense, a unit
that routinely shuffles in
receivers, and has recently
replaced its starting quarterback
for the second time in two years.
Regardless of the changes, how
ever, Sinclair and company always
adjust and continue to improve

their play.
"I think we're a lot more com
fortable with each other because
we have played together, and
we're fortunate enough to work
with Brian (Johnson, the Cardi
nal's first starting quarterback of
the season) and Jason," Sinclair
said. "We have a good feel for
what we're trying to get done and
what we're trying to accomplish."
This ethic, coupled with his ex
perience, has enhanced the
senior's individual efforts along
with his .unit's play. "Any time
you get another year under your
belt you're going to be a better
player. Personally, I kept my same
weight and increased my speed
and strength. I've focused in on
what I have had to do, and it
makes my job easier because I'm
playing with guys who have played
together for a couple of years,"
he said.
After redshirting his first year
at Stanford, Sinclair immediately
moved into the starting line-up
as a left guard. In the first 10
minutes of preseason practice that
year, starter Kevin Payne suffered
torn ligaments in his knee, and
Sinclair was hastily moved from

center to guard for his collegiate
debut. He did not relinquish the
spot that year, starting all 11
games.
Sinclair moved back to center
the following year, and a Stanford
star was born. An Honorable Men
tion All-America selection in 1986
and third team All-America last
year, the senior center has added
prestige to an unsung position
and has made the lives of
Palumbis and past quarterbacks
Johnson, Greg Ennis and John
Paye that much easier.
"He knocks people down,"
Palumbis said with a laugh. "All
I know is I have time back there
and that's mostly Andy's doing."
"Andy Sinclair is a complete
lineman, who is strong, physical
and has the intelligence to play a
very demanding position," Stan
ford Coach Jack Elway said. "The
coaches discover each week that
Andy can do more, and it has
been exciting to see him make
such great progress. He has great
intelligence in knowing what the
defense is going to do."
Of all his talents, mental aware
ness is the quality that really sets
Sinclair apart. The possessor of
what offensive line coach Otto
Kofler termed "a very analytical
mind," the senior readily spots
defensive shifts and adjusts the
offensive line's game plan accord
ingly.
The center has the burden of
swiftly hiking the ball to the quar
terback. He must accurately
deliver it, while simultaneously
preparing for the incoming bar
rage of defensive linesmen. It's a
tough task, but Sinclair has re
peatedly kept some of college foot
ball's finest noseguards at bay
and away from the backfield.
For this he has found himself
on the receiving end of many
honors, yet none seem to have
diverted his attention from the
things that really matter to him.
"I think Brad Muster summed
it up perfectly when he said, 'All-
America awards go to some of the
best players on the best teams,'
and I think that puts it in perfect
perspective," Sinclair said.
"Throughout the conference and
the entire country there's a lot of
good players on the offensive line.
"I've been fortunate enough to
play here for a long time and it's
a compliment to be recognized and
touted, but when I'm out on the
field I'm not worried about that."
What he is worried about is end

ing his Cardinal career on a good
note. Through the course of his
involvement in the Stanford foot
ball program, Sinclair has seen a
lot of change for the better in a
team that finished 1-10 the year
before his arrival. Now, he would
like to see a winning season and,
if possible, postseason play before
he moves on to a shot at the Na
tional Football League.
"First, my main goal is to get
us to a bowl game," the senior
said. "That would be the perfect
way to end a senior year. A year
from now, I would like to give
football the biggest opportunity I
can give it. I've played a long time
and I'm definitely going to try to
go up to the next level next year.
"Beyond that, at this point I
don't really have a lot in mind. I
think deep down inside I know
five, 10, 15 years down the line
what I want to be doing and where
I want to be at, but I think all
that's irrelevant right now. I'm
working as hard as I can right
now to get us to a bowl game,
and I'll work as hard as I can
next year to get on an NFL team."
Although the middle of the
season is hardly the time to dwell
on the past, Sinclair, like many
'other seniors, has already begun
to reminisce about his years on
the Farm. After four years here,
he has found himself changed in
many ways.
"I think as a person the best
decision I ever made was to come
to Stanford, because I think in a

way it opened my eyes to a lot of
other things besides athletics,"
Sinclair said. "I think that's some
thing I'll always be grateful for.
"As a football player, I've been
fortunate enough to start for four
years and play in 37 games, and
I'm really proud of that. I'm also
really proud of the guys I came
in with: We've been here a long
time and everybody's worked
hard. We've won some big games
and have gone to a bowl game,
and I think it's been a positive
thing for the whole program."

"All I know is I have
time back there and
that's mostly Andy's
doing."
