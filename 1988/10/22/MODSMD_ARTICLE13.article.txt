# Stanford defensive front keeps up pressure
## Archambeau, Huckestein, Palmbush prove dangerous to quarterbacks 
### Baldwin Lee 
As the football season reaches its mid
point, the Cardinal defensive line has not
let serious injuries keep it from a fine
first-half of a season.
Going into the season, the defensive line
looked to the leadership of two returning
veterans, tackle Lester Archambeau and
nose guard Ray Huckestein, who had
started 23 and 15 consecutive games,
respectively.
Both of these potential Ail-Americans,
however, were hobbled early in the season.
Archambeau, the team leader in sacks
for the last two years, suffered from a
sprained knee which only recently allowed
him to "play at full strength." In spite of
his injuries, Archambeau started all six
games and has recorded 38 tackles, one
sack, two tackles for losses and two forced
fumbles: a fine year by any account.
Huckestein's situation has been more
serious. According to defensive line coach
Dick Mannini, Huckestein was "con
siderably slowed" in early season games
due to various injuries. Currently, Huck
stein continues to ail from a sprained big
toe which has kept him out of the last two
games and leaves him questionable for
today's game.
Huckestein's injury became particularly
critical when backup noseguard Buck Rog

geman underwent knee surgery for an in
jury which has kept him out of the lineup.
The loss of both of his noseguards forced
Mannini to convert defensive tackles Mark
Hanson and Steve Weber.
A bright spot in the injury scene has
been the ability of the younger players to
step in and assert themselves. Mannini
feels that the injuries have created oppor
tunities for players to "turn up a few
notches" and have allowed the "cream to
slowly rise to the top," he said.
Junior Scott Palmbush has been a cor
nerstone in this process of rising to the
occasion. "Palmbush," Mannini said,
"began the season as heir apparent to right
tackle with the graduation of Sean Scheller
last year." In the process of asserting his
leadership presence, Palmbush has been
credited with 22 tackles, three sacks and
two tackles for losses. He capped off his
half-season by being named the Times
Tribune Co-Defensive Player of the Week
for his play in last week's Arizona State
game.
As the second half of the season begins,
the defensive line continues on with the
quiet intensity that characterizes what Ar
chambeau calls a "tight group." Looking
ahead, the senior team leader said that he
feels optimistic about how the defensive
line will perform. "We have all conference
games left. It is all in our hands if we can
just work our butts off," he said.
