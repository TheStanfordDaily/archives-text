# Wilhelm sets records

### Robert Pardington Editorial staff 
The best kept secret in the
Pacific 10 Conference this year is
tucked away in Corvallis, Ore.
There, amongst the Douglas Fir
and farmland, Oregon State
senior quarterback Erik Wilhelm
has been quietly piling up some
very impressive statistics.
A quick comparison with an
other Pac-10 quarterback, John
Elway, (Stanford 1979-82) should
put Wilhelm's value in perspec
tive.
With five games remaining,
Wilhelm needs only 1,219 yards
passing to exceed Elway's Pac-10
career record.
Averaging just over 272 yards
passing per game, Wilhelm is
right on schedule to put his name
ahead of Elway, Jim Plunkett, Pat
Haden and the rest. Wilhelm, it
would seem, is destined for star
dom in the National Football
League.
Wilhelm has two disadvantages,
however. The first is that the
Beavers haven't had a winning
season in 18 years. Not since
1962, when OSU quarterback
Terry Baker won the Heisman
Trophy, has there been a signal
caller of Wilhelm's quality at
OSU.
Wilhelm's second disadvantage
is that UCLA's Troy Aikman and
USC's Rodney Peete both play in
the conference. Aikman is the
odds-on favorite to win the Heis
man Trophy this year, and Peete
is a dark horse for the same
award.
All national media attention has
been focused on that pair from
Los Angeles, whose teams are now
ranked first and third in the na
tion.
Luckily for Wilhelm, sports
writers can't change statistics. Up
until today's game against Stan
ford, Wilhelm had completed 64.8
percent of his passes for 1,633
yards and 12 touchdowns.

Remarkably, he has thrown only
two interceptions all year.
How good does Wilhelm think
he is? You couldn't drag it out of
him.
"It's tough to evaluate myself,"
Wilhelm said. "I'm only as good
as my team. If I have to throw
the ball 50 times a game for us
to win, so be it."
Wilhelm's dedication to the
team, however, was questioned
last year. The Beavers were strug
gling nothing new there
when Wilhelm injured his left
ankle against Washington.
Wilhelm came back to play in
the final three games, but played
cautiously, it seemed, and was out
of sync. He completed only 43
percent of his passes for one
touchdown, and threw eight in
terceptions.
Growing impatient, OSU Coach
Dave Kragthorpe brought in three
junior college quarterbacks to
challenge Wilhelm. In fall drills,
Wilhelm showed that he had not
lost his competitiveness.
"I had a competition with
myself," Wilhelm said. "I was my
own critic."
The pressure to keep his start
ing job was just the thing to give
Wilhelm, a fifth-year senior, in
spiration for his final season at
OSU.
"It was kind of a refresher to
be pushed," Wilhelm said. "I sud
denly realized that I had to come
of age, to really be a leader."
Kragthorpe, who admitted that
at times last year he would have
liked to replace Wilhelm, has been
pleased with his senior quarter
back's performance this year.
"(Wilhelm) has done a good job
for us," Kragthorpe said. "He has
been very efficient."
When Wilhelm was challenged
in spring drills, Kragthorpe was
one of the many who thought that
the added pressure made him a
better player.
"The effort to retain his posi
tion helped him," Kragthorpe

said. "He needed a push."
Now that Wilhelm has his start
ing position secured, the junior
college transfers provide insur
ance against his being injured
again. So far, Wilhelm has been
healthy.
"I knock on wood every time
someone mentions that (his being
injury free)," Wilhelm said. "But
I'm not going to play walking on
eggs."
Wilhelm has shown great con
fidence and leadership through six
games this year. The Beavers,
relying on a strong passing attack,
have posted three wins and three
losses, the best start for an
Oregon State team in over a dec
ade.
In today's game, Wilhelm and
the Beavers face another 3-3
team, the Stanford Cardinal. Wil
helm will go up against Cardinal
quarterback Jason Palumbis.
Both players, interestingly, went
to Lakeridge High School in Lake
Oswego, Ore.
"It's a big game for both of us,"
Wilhelm said. "But I'm not going
against him. We have to rely on
our defenses to stop each other."
Wilhelm, who knew Palumbis
when Jason was a freshman at
Lakeridge, did hint that the game
could center on the performance
of the quarterbacks.
"It could turn out to be a shoot
out," Wilhelm said.
Several of OSU's games this
year have been "shoot-outs," and
Wilhelm's numbers show it. His
272.2 yard average ranks him sec
ond in the Pac-10 and seventh in
the nation in total offense.
Placing his name on the na
tional leader boards, Wilhelm has
attracted the attention of several
professional scouts.
Wilhelm said that pro scouts
talked to him at the end of the
season last year and emphasized
that he had to have a good senior
year to get drafted.
So far this season, Erik Wilhelm
has been having a very good year.
