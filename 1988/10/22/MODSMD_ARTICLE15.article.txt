# Slotback Young excels at new post
## 
### John Louie 
You might think that junior Charlie
Young, Stanford's team leader in receiving
yardage with 27 catches for 365 yards this
season, has been playing in the slotback
position all of his life.
Young, however, has been a slotback for
less than four months.
"It's different now that I'm a receiver,"
Young said. "I had to adapt to this year's
new offense, so now I'm catching the ball
more than running it. But I like to think
of myself as a running back."
Young has no trouble thinking of himself
as a ball carrier. He played running back
during his four years at New Trier High
School in Winnetka, 111. Obviously, as an
All-State and Honorable Mention All-
American, he was comfortable in the back
field.
"I have more fun running the ball, and
I'm better at it than receiving," Young said.
Young may prefer running the ball, but
for now his receiving talents are what the
Cardinal is utilizing. After a redshirt season
and a year at tailback, Young (6-foot-l,
200 pounds) has moved into the starting
slotback position in only his second year
of eligibility.
"When we evaluated the players this
year," running back coach Gary Gagnon
said, "we saw that he could play well both
catching and running the ball.
"We wanted to find a place for both Jon
(Volpe) and Charlie in this year's offense.
We figured that we needed to get the ball
to Jon and Charlie the most, and that both
should be in the ball game at the same time.
"You usually don't have a lot of players
who can be both a runner and a receiver.
Charlie is a good athlete though, and he
is certainly able to do both. When you get
a guy like that, it's really a plus."
In this year's new "run and shoot of
fense," only fullback Volpe stands behind
the quarterback while four receivers, two
wideouts and two slotbacks, line up in the
flats. Young was forced to adjust not only
to a new position, but to an entirely dif
ferent role.
"Everything is different," Young said,
"because now I'm running different routes
and reading coverages, trying to build my
skills as a receiver. It's good for me, and
I am getting better at it. And although I'd

rather be running, I'm not complaining.
I'm having a good time."
The adaptation from running back to
slotback has not been the only obstacle for
Young. After playing most of last season
with an injured back, Young sat out the
entire spring season. It was questionable
whether he would be fit to play this year.
"I'm still just getting back my instincts
and my feel for the game," Young said. "I
guess that's what keeps me fresh."
"Fresh" is an understatement for
Young's accomplishments this season. Sec
ond on the team in total all-purpose yar
dage only to Volpe, Young is averaging
13.5 yards per reception. In the Pacific 10
Conference, he is tied for fifth in catches
and ranks seventh in receiving yardage.
Additionally, his 49-yard reception from
quarterback Jason Palumbis in the game
against San Jose State is the Cardinal's
longest single offensive play this season.
"Charlie is a big part of our offense this
year," Gagnon said, "and he's doing a good
job. It gives us a lot of flexibility on what
we are able to do to put pressure on the
defense."
"The four (receivers) work pretty well,"
Young said, "because everyone knows
where everyone else is going. Each person
affects the scheme, and we can manipulate
the defense together to spread (it) out."
With the midseason change of quarter
backs this year, Young has been able to
adjust to Stanford quarterback Jason
Palumbis after playing with Brian Johnson.
"There's not really that much difference
between them, from a receiver's point of
view," Young said.
"Both of them have very strong arms,
and it's just a matter of them getting the
ball there. I just do what I have to."
Charlie Young's accomplishments at slot
back this season are impressive. However,
in his heart, Young still pictures himself
as a ball carrier.
"I'm like a musician who's good at play
ing the piano," Young said. "Right now,
I'm doing okay at another instrument, and
I'm having fun, but I'd rather be playing
the one that I really love to play."
It is remarkable that Charlie Young has
the talent to play two entirely different
offensive roles. What is more remarkable
though, is that he plays both exceptionally
well.

I am getting better at it. And although I'd

rather be running, I'm not complaining.
I'm having a good time."
The adaptation from running back to
slotback has not been the only obstacle for
Young. After playing most of last season
with an injured back, Young sat out the
entire spring season. It was questionable
whether he would be fit to play this year.
"I'm still just getting back my instincts
and my feel for the game," Young said. "I
guess that's what keeps me fresh."
"Fresh" is an understatement for
Young's accomplishments this season. Sec
ond on the team in total all-purpose yar
dage only to Volpe, Young is averaging
13.5 yards per reception. In the Pacific 10
Conference, he is tied for fifth in catches
and ranks seventh in receiving yardage.
Additionally, his 49-yard reception from
quarterback Jason Palumbis in the game
against San Jose State is the Cardinal's
longest single offensive play this season.
"Charlie is a big part of our offense this
year," Gagnon said, "and he's doing a good
job. It gives us a lot of flexibility on what
we are able to do to put pressure on the
defense."
"The four (receivers) work pretty well,"
Young said, "because everyone knows
where everyone else is going. Each person
affects the scheme, and we can manipulate
the defense together to spread (it) out."
With the midseason change of quarter
backs this year, Young has been able to
adjust to Stanford quarterback Jason
Palumbis after playing with Brian Johnson.
"There's not really that much difference
between them, from a receiver's point of
view," Young said.
"Both of them have very strong arms,
and it's just a matter of them getting the
ball there. I just do what I have to."
Charlie Young's accomplishments at slot
back this season are impressive. However,
in his heart, Young still pictures himself
as a ball carrier.
"I'm like a musician who's good at play
ing the piano," Young said. "Right now,
I'm doing okay at another instrument, and
I'm having fun, but I'd rather be playing
the one that I really love to play."
It is remarkable that Charlie Young has
the talent to play two entirely different
offensive roles. What is more remarkable
though, is that he plays both exceptionally
well.

Stanford slotback Charlie Young has made the transition from the offensive backfield
to wideout look easy. Young is tied for fifth in the Pacific 10 in receptions.
You might think that junior Charlie
Young, Stanford's team leader in receiving
yardage with 27 catches for 365 yards this
season, has been playing in the slotback
position all of his life.
Young, however, has been a slotback for
less than four months.
"It's different now that I'm a receiver,"
Young said. "I had to adapt to this year's
new offense, so now I'm catching the ball
more than running it. But I like to think
of myself as a running back."
Young has no trouble thinking of himself
as a ball carrier. He played running back
during his four years at New Trier High
School in Winnetka, 111. Obviously, as an
All-State and Honorable Mention All-
American, he was comfortable in the back
field.
"I have more fun running the ball, and
I'm better at it than receiving," Young said.
Young may prefer running the ball, but
for now his receiving talents are what the
Cardinal is utilizing. After a redshirt season
and a year at tailback, Young (6-foot-l,
200 pounds) has moved into the starting
slotback position in only his second year
of eligibility.
"When we evaluated the players this
year," running back coach Gary Gagnon
said, "we saw that he could play well both
catching and running the ball.
"We wanted to find a place for both Jon
(Volpe) and Charlie in this year's offense.
We figured that we needed to get the ball
to Jon and Charlie the most, and that both
should be in the ball game at the same time.
"You usually don't have a lot of players
who can be both a runner and a receiver.
Charlie is a good athlete though, and he
is certainly able to do both. When you get
a guy like that, it's really a plus."
In this year's new "run and shoot of
fense," only fullback Volpe stands behind
the quarterback while four receivers, two
wideouts and two slotbacks, line up in the
flats. Young was forced to adjust not only
to a new position, but to an entirely dif
ferent role.
"Everything is different," Young said,
"because now I'm running different routes
and reading coverages, trying to build my
skills as a receiver. It's good for me, and
I am getting better at it. And although I'd

rather be running, I'm not complaining.
I'm having a good time."
