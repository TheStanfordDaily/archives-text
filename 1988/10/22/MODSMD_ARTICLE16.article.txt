# Axe Committee sponsors canned food drive
## 
### 
The Stanford Axe Committee will hold
its second annual Holiday Canned Food
Drive at the Washington State-Stanford
football game on Nov. 5, two weeks from
today. Student volunteers will collect any
canned goods outside of each gate of
Stanford Stadium between 11:30 a.m.
and 1:30 p.m.
The goal of the canned food drive is
to collect goods to distribute to the needy
and hungry of Palo Alto, East Palo Alto,
and the Stanford area. The project is
co-sponsored by the Stanford Project On
Nutrition, Memorial Church, ASSU
Recycling and Lucky Food Stores.
The Axe Committee will also collect
canned goods on Thursday, Nov. 3, and
Friday, Nov. 4, during the day in White
Plaza on the Stanford Campus.

Last year, the Axe Committee collec
ted about 1,000 cans in their first
canned food drive.
Axe Committee Chairman Tom
Smegal hopes this year's drive will be
even more successful. "[Last year] was
an excellent number for a first try," he
said.
"However, the problem in the area is
far more severe than that will meet.
We'd like to get more than last year,
maybe 1,500," he said.
Collected goods will go directly from
the stadium to the Ecumenical Hunger
Project of Palo Alto and East Palo Alto
for distribution to the hungry and needy.
All fans attending the Washington State-
Stanford game are asked to bring canned
goods to contribute.
