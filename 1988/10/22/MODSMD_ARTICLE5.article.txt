# Stanford, Oregon State to air it out
## Palumbis, Wilhelm shoot for winning records 
### David Earnest Editorial staff 
If the Cardinal's tenacious de
fense can slow the Beavers' high
powered air attack, Stanford
should win today's football game
with Oregon State.
OSU, on the other hand, should
win if its troubled defense can
rise to the occasion and stop Stan
ford's on-again, off-again offense.
Which team wins today, you see,
depends on which team shows up
at the game.
Will Stanford's inconsistent of
fense, which has steadied under
the leadership of sophomore quar
terback Jason Palumbis, again
show the prowess it has in vic
tories the last two weekends?
Or will OSU's passing attack,
the second best in the Pacific 10
Conference with an average of
272.2 passing yards per game, be
able to pick apart a Stanford de
fense which gives up an average
of only 16.3 points per game?
"The big thing so far is that
we've been consistent and haven't
turned over the ball as much as
we have in previous years," OSU
Coach Dave Kragthorpe said. "We
feel we're playing pretty good
football ... the best since I've
been at Oregon State."
After a 2-9 season in 1987,
Kragthorpe has every reason to
be proud of his team's 3-3 record
this season. Although they were
a preseason pick for the Pac-10
cellar, Kragthorpe's Beavers have
been impressive so far this season,
losing only to UCLA, Arizona and
highly-regarded Colorado, to

whom they lost by only a touch
down.
The Beavers' success is the
result of a matured offensive unit
led by quarterback Erik Wilhelm,
the Pac-10's third highest rated
passer. Wilhelm has compiled
1,633 yards passing this year, sec
ond only to Washington State's
Timm Rosenbach.
Wilhelm's favorite target is
senior flanker Robb Thomas, who
leads the Pac-10 in receptions and
is second in receiving yardage.
OSU tailback Brian Taylor is an
other favorite of Wilhelm, receiv
ing 19 tosses this season.
The multiplicity of OSU's of
fense will present a challenge to
Stanford's defense, which has
been outstanding through the
season's first six games.
"I don't think I've seen them
run the same formation twice this
year," Stanford Coach Jack Elway
said of the Beavers. "We'll need
to cash in on any big plays we
can create."
Stanford's offense, after record
ing two consecutive victories with
sophomore Jason Palumbis at
quarterback, will face a blitzing
defense similar to that of the San
Jose State Spartans who the Car
dinal played two weeks ago.
Stanford beat the Spartans, but
Elway thinks the OSU defense
may be even tougher. "We haven't
faced a defense this year that has
as much variety as OSU does,"
he said.
The Cardinal is coming off what
Elway considers the team's best
played game of the season. "The
intensity was there through the

entire football game. All in all, it
was a complete football [perfor
mance]," he said.
The Cardinal offense is averag
ing only 22.7 points per game, but
recently it has improved, tallying
44 points against SJSU two weeks
ago and 17 in the first half last
week against Arizona State.
Although OSU ranks last in the
Pac-10 in scoring defense this
week, its 23.8 points-allowed-per
game average is considerably bet
ter than the dismal 39.4 average
it had at the end of the 1987
campaign. The Beavers' total de
fense has improved as well. OSU
currently allows 379.8 yards per
game, much better than the 462.1
yards it averaged last year.
Heading the Beavers' defense is
senior Andre Harris. The free
safety's totals of three intercep
tions and 79 tackles, 47 of which
were unassisted, lead the team in
both categories. He also has two
passes-defensed to his credit, as
well as two fumble recoveries.
"I can't say enough about Andre
Harris," Kragthorpe said. "He's
our big man on defense, our team
leader."
Stanford's offense will attack
with a balance of running and
passing plays as it has in the pre
vious few weeks. Fullback Jon
Volpe, who is currently fourth in
the Pac-10 in rushing with an
average of 95.7 yards per game,
will provide the ground assault.
Palumbis and tailback Charlie
Young, the team's leading
receiver, will spearhead an aerial
attack that has averaged 206.7
yards per game this year.

The Cardinal's defense has been
Stanford's most impressive unit
this year. Led by All-America can
didate Lester Archambeau at de
fensive tackle and the linebacking
tandem of Jono Tunney and Rob
Hinckley, Stanford has conceded
only 15 points over the last two
weeks. The Cardinal's plus 2.0
turnover ratio ranks fifth best in
the nation.
"A lot of our players are rising
to the level of Lester Archam
beau," Elway said.
Stanford's pass defense has
been exceptional the last two
games and will challenge OSU's
offensive tandem of Wilhelm and
Thomas. The Cardinal has 15 in
terceptions through six games, in
cluding five last week against
ASU. Cornerbacks Kevin Scott,
with one interception, and Alan
Grant, with three, will try to con
tain Thomas.
Stanford inside linebackers
Tunney and Kevin Richardson
will be responsible for slowing
OSU's already anemic rushing
game. Beaver tailback Brian
Taylor leads the team in rushing
with an average of only 46 yards
per game. Tunney and Richardson
are the Cardinal's two leaders in
tackles with 144 tackles between
them.

The Cardinal's pass rush may
still be slowed by an injury this
week. All-America candidate
noseguard Ray Huckestein, who
sat out both the ASU and SJSU
games due to a toe injury, is listed
as probable for today's game.
On special teams, neither squad
holds a considerable advantage.
Both Beaver placekicker Troy
Bussanich and his Stanford coun
terpart John Hopkins have been
perfect on the point-after, tallying
15 and 16 respectively. Bussanich
has hit seven of 10 field goal at
tempts, while Hopkins is 8-of-13.
Stanford's punting, which was
dismal early in the season, saw
improvement last weekend. Hop
kins, who won the punting job
from Jeff Blaisdell after the Notre
Dame game three weeks ago, has
upped his average to 35.9 yards
per punt. OSU's Mark Bennett is
averaging 40.2 yards per punt this
season.
Stanford has averaged 16.9
yards per kickoff return just
under OSU's 17.5. Neither team
has allowed a return to go for a
touchdown.
Although Stanford and OSU are
each 3-3, both head coaches are
pleased with their team's per

formance this season and look for
ward to going above .500 with a
victory today.
"We've played six solid games
this season," Kragthorpe said.
"That's certainly a step forward
for this program."
Elway shares some of Krag
thorpe's optimism about the 1988
season. "I do feel like we are im
proving as a ball team. If we con
tinue to improve, we'll let the
results take care of themselves,"
he said.
For both the Stanford Cardinal
and the Oregon State Beavers, the
progress will be evident in today's
game.
Card notes
Stanford and Oregon State today
renew their rivalry which dates back
to 1919. Of the 56 meetings, Stanford
has won 38, lost 15, and the two have
tied twice. Stanford has also won 17
of the last 19 meetings, including a
38-7 thrashing of the Beavers at Cor
vallis last year.... Stanford's defense
improved it's scoring defense with last
week's 24-3 victory over the Arizona
State Sun Devils. The Cardinal is con
ceding a mere 16.3 points per game,
considerably better than last year's
average of 24.4 points per game. . . .
Stanford fullback Jon Volpe is averag
ing 95.7 yards per game this season
and has 5 touchdowns to his credit.
At this rate, he will rush for 1,053
yards this season. Only two other
Stanford players, Darrin Nelson and
Brad Muster, have rushed for over
1,000 yards in a season. Nelson did
it three times, in 1977, '7B, and 'Bl,
and Muster accomplished it in
1986. . . . Stanford is currently fifth
in the Pac-10 with its 1-2 conference
mark, but could be tied for third at
the end of today's play. If Stanford
beats OSU, if Arizona loses to UCLA,
and if Washington can win at Oregon,
then Oregon, Arizona, Stanford and
Washington, would be tied for third
with conference marks of 2-2.... In
the last two games, Stanford has a
turnover ratio of 13 takeaways to only
2 giveaways. Through the season's
six games, the Cardinal has 4-12
takeaways, an improvement over last
season's -2 takeaway mark. Stanford's
2.0 takeaways per game average is
ranks the Cardinal fifth in the nation
in that category.... After last week
end's play and this week's Top-20
polls, it may be possible that Stanford
will have played the number one, two,
and three teams this season. Stanford
played this week's third-ranked team,
USC, on Sept. 10, second-ranked
Notre Dame on Oct. 1 and will play
the current no. 1, UCLA, on Nov. 12.
