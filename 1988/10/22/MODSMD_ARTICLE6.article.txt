Stanford

Oregon State quarterback Erik
Wilhelm, who is approaching John
Elway's Pacific 10 Conference
record for total career offense,
leads the Beavers' passing attack.
His statistics this season are im
pressive: 1,633 yards passing
through six games, 12 touch
downs tosses and only two inter
ceptions. Stanford cornerback
Alan Grant, who has three inter
ceptions this season, will try to
slow Wilhelm and keep the
Beavers' receivers out of the end
zone.

Flanker Robb Thomas is OSU's
premier offensive weapon. So far
this season he's tallied 37 recep
tions for 497 yards and 3 touch
downs. He's the Pac-10 leader in
receptions and is second in receiv
ing yardage. Cardinal strong
safety Rob Englehardt, who has
two interceptions, will be respon
sible for Stanford's deep passing
zone and will try to prevent
Thomas from gaining his usual
long yardage.

OSU tight end Phil Ross will
provide important pass protection
for Wilhelm should the Cardinal
decide to pressure and blitz the
Beavers. But the big guy (6-foot-4,
220 pounds) can also catch, and
the Beavers use him to comple
ment a fine set of deep receivers.
When Ross does go out, left out
side linebacker Rob Hinckley will
often be responsible for covering
him. A solid defender against the
pass with two interceptions this
season, Hinckley may very well
have the better of this important
matchup.

Andre Harris has been the
Beavers' standout on defense this
season at free safety. He is the
team leader in both tackles and
interceptions, and in OSU's blitz
ing defense, Harris will play man
to-man coverage on Stanford's
receivers. Usually man-to-man is
a quarterback's dream, but the
skills of the savvy Harris may be
enough to challenge Stanford's
improving, but relatively inexpe
rienced sophomore quarterback
Jason Palumbis. Palumbis was 23
of 32 last week against Arizona
State.

With an average of just 46 yards
per game, Brian Taylor is the
leader of a Beaver rushing attack
that, in grinding out 129.0 yards
a contest, plays a definite second
fiddle to the team's passing at
tack. Stanford linebacker Jono
Tunney is having an exceptional
year with 86 total tackles, four
sacks and two interceptions, and
may, along with the rest of the
Cardinal linebacking corps, be
enough to hamper Taylor and his
Beaver backfield.

OSU's Troy Bussanich and
Stanford's John Hopkins lead
their respective teams in scoring.
Bussanich has 36 points this
season while Hopkins has 40. Bus
sanich is seven of 10 this season.
Hopkins is eight of 13. While nei
ther placekicker has stellar num
bers, both have been reasonably
consistent this season. Hopkins,
who has had two field goal at
tempts blocked this season, dou
bles as the Cardinal's punter,
averaging 35.9 yards per punt.
