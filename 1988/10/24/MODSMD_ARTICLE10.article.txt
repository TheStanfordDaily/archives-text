Toss toast and you will be tossed
Drink no evil.
Speak no evil.
Throw no evil.
The University of Pennsylvania welcomed stu
dents back this semester by banning kegs in all
residences and fraternities as part of an increased
effort to prohibit the illegal consumption of al
cohol.
I Jew add profanity and toast to the list of
campus taboos.
Students looking to honor two staples of home
football games — throwing toast after the third
quarter and singing a unique version of "The
Field Cry of Penn" — had to struggle to continue
these traditions at the season opener at Franklin
Field.
For the second year in a row, security guards
at the stadium confiscated toast and frisked eager
fans who had suspicious looking packages filled

with toast and bagels.

Columbia avoids strike in last hour
Columbia clerical and support workers averted
a strike Oct. 13 by overwhelmingly accepting a
contract hammered out during an all-night
negotiating session between the employees' union
and University administrators.
United Workers District 65 threatened to strike
if an agreement was not reached with the Uni
versity. Negotiations have been ongoing since
mid-May, and the union's last contract expired
June 30.
An agreement on issues such as wage increases,
job classification and child care was reached at
approximately 6:45 a.m., according to negotiators
from both sides of the table.
A strike vote had been slated for 8 a.m.
