## Israeli election focuses on land 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel's election is focused
on whether to keep the West Bank and Gaza Strip
as a buffer to hostile Arab states or trade away the
land to preserve the Jewish character of Israel.
Israelis seem almost evenly split on the issue,
and the Nov. 1 vote may be less a watershed than
another shotgun wedding between the rightist Likud
bloc of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and the
left-leaning Labor Party of Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres.
Shamir and Peres have been reluctantly sharing
power since the 1984 elections resulted in a
stalemate. The unlikely coalition has hung together
despite basic policy differences.
Interest is high in this year's election and about
80 percent of the 2.4 million eligible voters are
expected to cast ballots.
Israel's belated debate on the future of the West
Bank and Gaza, captured by Israel in the 1967
Middle East war, was largely sparked by the 10-
month-old Palestinian uprising in which more than
290 Palestinians and six Israelis have been killed.
The two large parties have summoned generals
out of retirement to appear in TV ads and bolster
their arguments over whether Israel can risk yield
ing the territory to Arab control.
"The distance from Jordan to Jerusalem- is about
12 miles," warns Likud's Yehoshua Saguy, a former
head of military intelligence.
Standing on heights overlooking Jerusalem, Saguy
points down a road once used by Iraqi tanks. "The
message is simple: We cannot leave these hills. This
is the security of the coastal plain" where two-thirds
of Israel's 4.2 million people live.
Peres argues that if Israel annexes the 2,266
square miles of land occupied in 1967, as some
right-wing politicians have demanded, an Arab
majority will emerge and destroy the Jewish char
acter of the country.
Yaakov Ezrachi of the Labor-aligned Decima Poll
said voters appear prepared to give up territory but
want guarantees that it would work.
