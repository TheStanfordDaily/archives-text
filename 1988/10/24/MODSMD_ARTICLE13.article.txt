# Dukakis gets intense
## Says Bush used 'fear and smear' campaign 
### 
HULL, 111. (AP) — Michael Dukakis was
at a pig farm, sitting on a bale of hay and
talking about rural America while Demo
cratic Rep. Richard Durhin stood a few feet
away saying the presidential candidate was
going about things all wrong.
With the election nearing, Dukakis' cam
paign message was "completely over
shadowed" by George Bush's sharply cri
tical television commercials, Durbin said.
His advice to his party's candidate was
that the uphill race could still be won, but
Dukakis needed above all to "come out and
be hard-hitting and forceful."
Now, Durbin and other Democrats with
the same message have gotten their wish.
Over the next few days, Dukakis refined
his new Populist campaign rhetoric to its
essentials, waved GOP brochures in the
autumn air with a denunciation that they
were "political garbage" and charged in a
new television commercial that Bush's own
ads were "full of lies, and he knows it."
In a television message Saturday night,
Dukakis was accusing Bush of a campaign
"of fear and of smear" and he was vowing
to "fight my heart out for the things I
believe in."
The polls say George Bush is on the
verge of sweeping into the White House in
next month's election. But like trailing can
didates everywhere, Dukakis is making a
final determined effort to salvage his can
didacy.
"This is 18 months and 450,000 miles.
He's not giving up now," said Nick
Metropoulos, the man who travels every
where with the governor.
Yet even as Dukakis readied his charge,
the GOP vice presidential candidate was
scoffing at the man from Massachusetts.
"Michael Dukakis is no Harry Truman,"

said Dan Quayle, referring to the political
patron saint of the underdog.
The sharpened rhetoric and new com
mercials were not the only evidence of Du
kakis' last campaign stand. He also stepped
up the pace of campaigning at the same
time Bush was cutting back on his. And
Dukakis seemed to accepting every TV in
terview offer that came his way.
Yet from Durbin's vantage point in rural
Illinois to other party officials around the
country, Democrats say Dukakis needs ex
citement as much as issues. Thus Michigan
Gov. Jim Blanchard twice last week leapt
to his feet during rallies and pumped his
fists in the air like a cheerleader, trying
to ignite the crowd and the candidate.
Democrats do not minimize the difficul
ties.
Bush's lead in the national public opinion
polls ranges from seven points to 17, al
though Dukakis' own polls show it below
10. Bush appears to have an overwhelming
advantage in the Electoral College, as well,
with a seemingly solid foundation of South
ern and Rocky Mountain states.
Dukakis' operatives have had well
publicized squabbles with Democratic
regulars from coast to coast. Dukakis' per
formance in the second presidential debate
on Oct. 13 left some of his aides
demoralized.
Adviser Donna Brazile resigned last week
after making personal remarks about Bush
that brought an apology from Dukakis.
And for weeks, Durbin told reporters,
Dukakis "had his character assailed and
in some quarters destroyed by the Bush
negative advertising." Said Georgia Sen.
Sam Nunn, "I wouldn't have been a punch
ing bag on some of those issues."
