Congress approves anti-drug bill
WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress yesterday
sent President Reagan a far-reaching anti-drug
bill that one Senate leader calls "bad news for
drug dealers and their customers."
Final passage was delayed until the early morn
ing hours, as conservatives privately demanded
an anti-obscenity trafficking clause that was con
sidered unconstitutional by many liberals and
moderates.
But after negotiators compromised with lan
guage to create a new obscenity trafficking of
fense, the House approved the bill 346-11 and
the Senate followed suit by voice vote. The House
vote came at 1:20 a.m. EDT and the Senate acted
at 3:15 a.m EDT.
The bill contains stiff penalties for drug traf
fickers and users, and comes just in time for
incumbents to trumpet its passage in their re
election campaigns.
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said
the bill is "bad news for drug dealers and their
customers," and promised that Congress would
pass "even tougher medicine" next year.
Thousands rally against Pinochet
SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — Several thousand
people gathered yesterday at a rally called by
leftist parties and chanted slogans calling for the
resignation of President Augusto Pinochet.
Speakers at the rally urged opposition parties
to strenghten the unity that led to Pinochet's
defeat at the polls in a referendum Oct. 5. In
the balloting the voters rejected a proposal that

would have extended Pinochet's rule until 1997.
Participants in the rally filled three blocks of
a broad avenue in western Santiago. Many urged
their leaders to call a national strike to put
pressure on the 72-year-old president and army
commander to step down immediatedly. Gen.
Pinochet has been president since the coup he
led that ousted elected Marxist President Salvador
Allende in 1973.
According to Chile's constitution, an open elec
tion will be held in December 1989 and Pinochet
is due to hand power to the winner three months
later. The election was mandated after Pinochet's
defeat in the referendum.
Quayle defends TV 'sound bytes'
WASHINGTON (AP) - "One-liners say a lot,"
says Dan Quayle, contending that voters have
been well informed this year even though the
presidential campaigns have often aimed merely
for catchy television "sound bites."
"There are a lot of subtleties communicated
with a sound bite," the brief TV clip on the
evening news, he said. "People receive messages."
Voters, Quayle said, can receive a complex mes
sage from a simple one-liner, especially when
such elements as body language are added in.
"What you have right now is you have to get
a story across and the temptation is to say 'OK,
we've got a message today we want to get across
on our own terms and nobody else's,"' Quayle
said.
"Let's not minimize the importance of one
liners."
