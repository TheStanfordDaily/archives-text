MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) â€”
Hurricane Joan hit the Nica
raguan coastal city of Bluefields
yesterday with 125 mph winds
and blinding rain, tearing off
roofs, causing blackouts and forc
ing residents to flee in fear of
floods and mudslides.
About 1,000 people were
evacuated in the early morning
darkness after floodwaters threat
ened to engulf a residential neigh
borhood in Bluefields. The group
was taken to the municipal palace
to ride out the storm, state radio
Voice of Nicaragua reported.
Joan smashed houses and cut
electricity and telephone service
in the city, but no casualties were
reported early today.
In Miami, embittered anti-
Sandinista Nicaraguan exiles said
they were unlikely to participate
in a relief drive to help their
homeland despite the damage al
ready caused by Hurricane Joan.
"We are certainly net going to
help them out," said Roberto Ar
guello, director of the Nicaraguan
American Bankers Association.
"LeM;he Russians help them out."
U.S.-backed Contras are fighting
the leftist Sandinista government,
which has been in power since

1979.
Joan late Friday struck Nicara
gua's offshore Great Corn Island,
state radio reported.
Heavy winds and rain knocked
out power in Rama, 62 miles west
of Bluefields, and strong
downpours were reported in cen

tral Chontales and southern Rio
San Juan provinces.
Forecasters with the National
Hurricane Center in Coral Gables,
Fla., said the storm, traveling
west at 10 mph, was expected to
weaken considerably as it contin
ued passing over land.
