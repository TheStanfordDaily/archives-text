The controversial case
of the vigil deserves
at least to be opened

LAST WEEK, the Office of
Judicial Affairs decided
whether the seven students
involved in the candlelight vigil last
spring in front of Otero had vio
lated the Fundamental Standard.
It decided by not deciding.
The judgment of the seven men
who held the vigil was passed down
without the case ever being opened
up.
According to the Regulations
Governing Student Conduct, the
Judicial Affairs Officer is the only
person empowered to "initiate for
mal disciplinary proceedings" in a
case of "possible student miscon
duct." One person has the power
to determine whether to open a
case for examination.
Instead of doing so, the Judicial
Affairs Officer decided to shove the
incident into a file drawer.
The Fundamental Standard de
mands that students act with re
spect "for order, morality, personal
honor and the rights of others as
is demanded of good citizens."
The issue is not to determine
guilt. The issue is to determine a
"possible student misconduct," a
possible violation of the Funda
mental Standard.
It is possible that the seven stu
dents who invoked images of the
Ku Klux Klan, regardless of inten
tion, did not respect morality.
It is quite possible that the seven
students who hid their faces behind
masks and ran from the scene
when approached by students did
not respect personal honor.
It is quite possible that the seven
students who frightened and of
fended many students violated the

Fundamental Standard.
Judicial Affairs argues that the
incident is too ambiguous to be
examined: "If there are strong ar
guments both for and against the
option of charging the students
with Fundamental Standard viola
tions, then we have a circumstance
best handled outside the judicial
arena."
In such a confusing and weighty
affair that offends and disturbs as
many students as the candlelight
vigil did, Judicial Affairs should
not be trying to avoid examination.
Instead, it should dive right in and
try to get at the heart of the mat
ter.
In fact, the Judicial Affairs Of
ficer made the decision based on
Daily articles, Campus Report ar
ticles and a Student Affair's factual
report. At no time did the Office
conduct interviews with the seven
individuals.
If the case were opened, the
Stanford Judicial Council could
have conducted these necessary in
terviews and could have done more
fact-finding. As it stands now, the
case will rest untouched.
The Office of Judicial Affairs
also argues that the seven students
acted in ignorance rather than
malice.
Ignorance comes into play only
when the punishment is decided.
It may be less severe if the stu
dent's intentions were not mali
cious or dishonest.
In the case of the vigil, the stu
dents' intentions were used as an
argument to avoid opening the case
rather than one to lessen the stu
dents' punishment if they are in
fact guilty.
The Office of Judicial Affairs has
shirked its responsibility.
Its abandonment of the case
sends a clear message to the stu
dents who were hurt by the vigil:
that their input is not valuable to
the University.
