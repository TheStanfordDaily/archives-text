# Local support to aid hurricane victims
## 
### DJ Berinstein Staff writer 
Officials of the Palo Alto/Stan
ford Medical Aid Community, fear
that Hurricane Joan, the most
powerful storm ever to hit Nica
ragua, may have severely
damaged hospitals that the service
helps supply near Managua, the
capital city.
Though the full effects of the
disaster have not been reported,
it certainly aggravated what is al
ready a troubled nation.
The hurricane razed much of
the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua
and two islands off the coast
before moving inland to do fur
ther damage, leaving in Nicaragua
alone a death toll of 20 at latest
count and 140 more people miss
ing.
Nearly 200,000 people living on
the Atlantic Coast were being

evacuated, and more than 70,000
around the capital were also
awaiting evacuation.
Communication has been ex
tremely difficult due to this na
tional disaster; officials at
PASMAC are uncertain as to the
extent of the damage.
"It's like a plane crash," said
Mary Navarro, a PASMAC group
member. "You know there are
survivors, but you just have to
sit around and wait to hear."
PASMAC has coordinated relief
efforts to Nicaragua for over two
years, and based on outside dona
tions, has raised over $300,000
worth of medical supplies last
year.
"It's a very disheartening situ
ation, especially in light of the
Nicaraguan economy and trade
problems," said Navarro.
"The United States was almost
the exclusive trading partner for

the Nicaraguans, and after eight
years of war with the Sandinistas
and then the Somosa problems,
it was very hard on the economy,"
said Luis Rodriquez, a Stanford
medical student. Last spring,
Rodriguez visited the hospitals
that PASMAC sends supplies to
in Barrios, on the outskirts of
Managua.
Not only has Nicaragua's
agricultural economy been hurt
by war and its inability to export
to the United States, but a long
drought also plagued the country
for several months this summer.
According to Ross Newport, the
West Coast director of Quest For
Peace, a Catholic relief fund for
Central America based in Mary
land, when rain did finally come
in Nicaragua, it ended up ag
gravating the situation.
"One and a half months of rain
would have been enough, but after

three months, it washed all the
crops away, causing devastating
landslides," he said.
Newport is in charge of an
emergency relief airlift to Nicara
gua set to leave from Los Angeles
on Friday. He confirmed that one
hospital is currently a "shambles,"
but does not know of the exact
damage to the PASMAC facilities.
The airlift will supply blankets,
small handtools to rebuild houses,
black plastic sheeting to provide
temporary housing, and various
staple foods. Most importantly,
water purification tablets will be
sent in order to avoid any the
catastrophe that followed the
Nepal flooding castatrophy at the
end of September.
"If the wells overflow and the
septic tanks leak, there could be
some real problems," Newport
said.
