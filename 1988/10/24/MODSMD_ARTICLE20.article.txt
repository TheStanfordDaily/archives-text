## Thesis misses antithesis 
### 
Socrates described the
"dialectic method," a process of
reaching a conclusion through
dialogue or directed discussion: a thesis
is challenged by an antithesis, which can
result in synthesis. Debate.
Last week, Stacey Leake raised an in
teresting point in her letter to the editor
(Oct. 19, "COP criticized for alienating
behavior").
She described a silencing of conserva
tive and moderate views at Stanford by
more liberal vocal groups, because the
former's views are often misconstrued as
incompassionate or prejudiced.
Considering that we are a school com
posed largely of conservative and
moderate students, this would suggest
that little real debate occurs at Stanford.
Often students discuss issues among stu
dents with whom they already agree.
The alienation of conservatives and
moderates (whether it is imposed by this
group, or by more vocal groups on
campus) as Leake says, leads to bitter
ness, resentment, and sometimes perpet
uates the attitudes that we wish to
change.
Her point reminded me of an experience
that I had freshmen year in which some
students reacted to what they perceived
as unfair condemnation, and remained
silent. They felt alienated, but did not
dare say anything. Nobody discussed any
thing. Nobody learned anything.
I attended a small, private college for
two years before transferring to Stanford.
Although some of the social dynamics
were different, the residental education
policy was similiar.

Sometime near the end of fall quarter,
Mike, a resident on my floor, accepted
what he had long suspected and had
wished to deny â€” he was gay. This af
firmation was the easiest of what he
would soon face.
During winter break his parents, un
able to accept that their son was gay,
kicked him out of the house. His best
friend strongly disapproved of Mike's
sexual orientation and refused to speak
to him.
Few things improved when Mike re
turned to school. Nasty, anonymous mes
sages began to appear on his message
board. Eventually he removed the board
from his door. But the hassling continued.
Some residents, male and female, were
unaware of the silent assaults. However,
when two students beat apart his art
project with a baseball bat while chanting
"this is our friend Mike the fag. Kill the
fag," the entire floor learned what was
happening.
Six men received a "shape up or ship
out" ultimatum for a crime only two men
committed. When those who were not
guilty tried to defend themselves, the R.A.
would not listen to their argument.
The men felt they had been sentenced
by guilt by association and an extremely
liberal "agenda" biased against them.
They reasoned that just because they
were straight, they would all be unfairly
labeled as homophobic, and that anything
they said would be misconstrued. So they
remained silent.
Consequently, and most importantly,
the real issue was lost. Instead of dis
cussing why the hassling continued for

so long or why some of the acts were
offensive, we remained silent.
Although the incidents stopped, we sel
dom talked openly about what had hap
pened, for fear of saying something
wrong.
Despite some feelings to the contrary,
we continued to live together as if our
ignored differences did not matter. We
went our separate ways for the summer,
and lived sophomore year in self-selected
groups.
In a different sense, the same process
occurs time and again at Stanford.
Sometimes racist or intolerant views
are masked as conservative ones. But
sometimes conservative views are un
fairly labeled racist or intolerant. Thus,
those people remain silent rather than
risk being labeled.
Although I tend to hold liberal views,
I believe strongly in the value of debate
and compromise.
In order for rational discourse to occur,
the silent, conservative sector to which
Leake refers must be able to speak out,
without fear of unfair labels.
Unless a lot more synthesis occurs at
Stanford, thesis will remain thesis, and
antithesis will remain antithesis.
