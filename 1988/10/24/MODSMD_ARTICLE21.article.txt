## University should change Hoover relationship now 
### 
THE DAILY'S Oct. 17 editorial
asserts that the search commit
tee for the new director of the
Hoover Institution will "narrow its
choice down to one" candidate and that
University President Donald Kennedy
has the authority to veto that candi
date.
On the contrary, in accord with the
1971 agreement between Stanford's
Trustees and what was then called the
Hoover Advisory Board, an unspecified
number of nominees will be presented
by the search committee to the Presi
dent, and his selection will be subject
to the veto of the Hoover Board of
Overseers and the Trustees of the
Herbert Hoover Foundation.
In addition, the search committee is

stacked against the President: four
members are Senior Fellows of Hoover,
three are Hoover Overseers, three are
appointees of the President, and the
committee is chaired by one of the
Senior Fellows.
That imbalance of seven to three, far
from providing a "safety net" which
will "insure that everyone is satisfied
with the new director," as the editorial
claims, virtually guarantees that the
new director will be a clone of the
present director, will continue to
embrace the political mission of Hoo
ver, and will possess the same, enor
mous power over appointments, budget
and research agenda as the present
director.

The editorial's conclusion, supporting
the Senate's vote on Oct. 13 — that
we should "give peace a chance" pend
ing the appointment of the new direc
tor — is as false as the information
about the search on which it is based.
There can be no "peace" between
Hoover and Stanford until either the
two institutions separate or Hoover is
brought under the governance —
including its procedures of search and
appointment — of the President, the
Provost and the faculty.
To believe that there can be "peace"
in such a bad marriage is a dangerous
illusion, blinding the community to a
present need: we should begin now to
press the Trustees for a change in the

structural relationship between Hoover
and Stanford so that candidates for the
directorship will know in advance that
the problem will not be solved by
being less "abrasive" than the present
director.

Editor's note: If the bodies of the
Hoover Institution veto President Ken
nedy's selection from the unspecified
number of nominees, then the President
must select another nominee submitted
by the search committee. Thus, no
candidate can be considered for the
position of Hoover Director unless
President Kennedy selects him or her
fropi the list of nominees.
