# Citizen Corps plan draws some criticism
## 
### 
As a student who has had to rely
completely on financial aid of many
sorts to finance my education, I would
like to express a few ideas about the
"Citizen Corps."
The services that would be provided
through this corps are needed and
those who provide those services will
surely benefit from serving. I preface
my statements by saying that I
heartily agree with implementing a
program of this nature as long as it is
voluntary.
However, I believe that there are
many instances in which this plan is
not the best way to encourage quality
education for all. I would like to first
take issue with the "phasing out" of
student loan programs.
Contrary to the attitude Sen.
Johnston expressed specifically and
others on the panel expressed implicit
ly, loans are not gifts. There are many

reasons why loans are a necessary
alternative to work-based programs.
For instance, members of the panel
stated that this country appears to
have a dire shortage of people trained
in technical degrees in science, engi
neering and other fields. More broadly,
there is a lack of representation of
women, minorities and the poor in
graduate programs of all sorts.
However, reaching this level of train
ing requires a minimum of four years
for a bachelor's degree, and an addi
tional three to six years (or more) for
a doctorate.
It seems ludicrous to me to ask
someone to spend a large number of
years in civil or military service (in
order to qualify for payment of this
much schooling) and then begin their
studies! It wastes too much of their
time and potential, and discourages
people from trying to attain advanced
degrees.
It would be more sensible to loan
them the money to attain their degrees
and have them pay it back after gradu
ation. They could pay either in cash,

direct work for the government or per
haps partially through weekend service
such as Sen. Mikulski described.
Another problem I see with the plan
is one of incentives. If a voucher is
given for a fixed amount of money to
be applied towards expenses, there is
an incentive to go to the most inexpen
sive schools. While that is an improve
ment over no education at all, many of
the better schools (which I stipulate
tend to be more expensive) are then
less attractive to people coming out of
the corps.
A possible solution to this problem
could be to provide a small stipend for
living expenses at school. And a large
percentage of tuition at any school the
participant can get admitted to.
Depending on the percentage of tui
tion paid, there would still be some
incentive to be cost-efficient, but the
more expensive schools would not be
completely out of reach.
Another possible drawback is that
some students need to go to college
directly from high school in order to
keep their interest and their edge.

Living on one's own for a year or
two can drastically reduce interest in
further education as would-be students
get settled in a community, and pick
up an adult consumption-oriented life
style. (Don't pretend that students are
the most matenalistic group on earth!)
I believe it is better to allow people
the opportunity to get their education
first, and then serve in the community
or pay back loans directly. Not only
would it be easier for many students,
but they will be better trained when
they begin service.
With these comments in mind, I
think a plan such as the Citizen's
Corps is long overdue. People should
be encouraged to give of their time and
energy to society at large. If such legis
lation is in place by the time I finish
my doctoral degree in engineering,
perhaps I can ei\joy the benefits of
joining the corps and pay off my
$16,000 in student loans at the same
time.
