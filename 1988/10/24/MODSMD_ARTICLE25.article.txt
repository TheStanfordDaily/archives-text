## Card walks away unscathed but unsatisfied, 20-20 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
One of the great things about
sport is that it is clear-cut —
someone wins and someone loses.
Except on Saturday.
The Stanford and Oregon State
football teams played to a 20-20
tie at Stanford Stadium in a game
that few, if any, players on either
team were satisfied with.

Football
Cardinal 20, Beavers 20

In a game either team could
easily'have lost, a 26-yard Troy
Bussanich field goal with five
seconds showing on the clock tied
it up for the Beavers, leaving both
teams 3-3-1 on the season, 1-2-1
in the Pacific 10 Conference.
"We held them and they went
for the field goal," noseguard Ray
Huckestein said. "What can you
do about that? It's easy for me
to say I would have gone for the
touchdown, but he's the coach.. . .
I wish he wouldn't have."
With the possibility of a bowl
game becoming very remote for
both teams following the tie, one
Stanford defender wished "they
had just lined the ball up at the
three-yard line and had one play
for the game."
Wins and losses are simple to
deal with, but what exactly does
a tie mean?
"They say a tie is like kissing
your sister," Huckestein said.
Well, Ray, how good-looking is
your sister today? "She's good
looking but I wouldn't want to
kiss her."
"A tie and a loss, I guess, are
about the same thing now," red
shirt freshman Jon Pinckney said.
Stanford, an eight-point favor
ite coming into the game, started
slowly while the Beavers, a team
known for their explosive passing

game (their media guide's cover
reads "Air Express"), ran the Car
dinal into the ground.
"1 think maybe it was . . .
looking past them," cornerback
Kevin Scott said. "Underestimat
ing them you might say."
Stanford almost got on the
board first when sophomore Wal
ter Batson streaked wide-open
down the middle on a post pattern
on the Cardinal's first drive, but
quarterback Jason Palumbis over
threw the ball and Stanford ended
up punting.
"In the first half we seemed a
little off [on offense]," wide
receiver Pinckney said. "We were
just missing things."
Oregon State then scored on
three plays, the second of which
was a five-yard Erik Wilhelm
dump-off pass to fullback Pat
Chaffey, who broke a tackle and
ran 75 yards to the Cardinal four.
Tailback Brian Taylor then easily
reached the endzone on a sweep
play.
Four minutes into the second
quarter, the Beavers made it 14-0
after driving 86 yards. At this
point, OSU was outrushing Stan
ford 87 yards to four.
"We knew they had a running
game," strong safety Rob
Englehardt said. "We thought we
could shut it down and then play
the pass. We didn't come close to
shutting it down. ... I think the
thing was we were missing
tackles."
"On first down they'd come out
and run for five yards," defensive
tackle Scott Palmbush said. "I
think we underestimated the run
ning game of OSU. .. Of course
[the running game] sets up the
passing game. We were playing
their game instead of having them
play our game."
Oregon State finished with 220
yards rushing while Stanford ran
for only 68. Wilhelm also passed
for 245 yards in what was prob
ably the Beavers most balanced

offensive football game in some
time.
"They were executing very
well," Huckestein said, "and we
made a few mistakes. . . . Their
execution was much better than
ours was in the first half."
Stanford came back with a field
goal right before halftime to make
it 14-3 but OSU increased the
lead to 14 in the third quarter.
Finally, Stanford's offense
began to get untracked. The Car
dinal drove 76 yards on eight
plays to get within seven as time
ran out in the third quarter. Then,
after the defense held, Stanford
went 42 yards and a John Hop
kins' 28-yard field goal made it
17-13.
Again the Cardinal defense
stopped the Beavers, giving the
offense the ball on its own 15
with four minutes, 16 seconds
remaining. Three plays later
Palumbis found Pinckney behind
cornerback Billy Hughely down
the right sideline and threw the
ball perfectly to him. Pinckney
cruised 75 yards for Stanford's
longest offenive play of the year,
giving Stanford a 20-17 lead with
only two minutes, 33 seconds to
play.
"We'd been running 90s on
them all day — six-yard curls,"
Pinckney said. "They really got
on [Hughely] on the sideline
about coming up on that play. . . .
We figured we'd get a big play on
[number] 17 [Hughely]. We were
confident we could score. ... I
thought we'd hold on to win it."
Wilhelm and Co. had other
ideas. The Beavers marched from
their own 27 to the Stanford four
with 44 seconds left. Wilhelm then
threw the ball away to stop the
clock.
On second down, Wilhelm was
sacked by Englehardt back to the
eight and OSU — without any
timeouts left — lined up and
