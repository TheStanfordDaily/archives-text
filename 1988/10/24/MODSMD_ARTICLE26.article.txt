# Stanford's reaction shows maturity
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
After tying the Oregon State
Beavers 20-20 Saturday, mem
bers of the Stanford Cardinal
football team looked like they
had just walked out of a funeral.
The Cardinal had been behind
all day only to score what
seemed to be the winning touch
down with 2:33 left to play in
the most bizarre game in recent
memory at Stanford Stadium.
And they did so in dramatic
fashion. Quarterback Jason
Palumbis dropped back and
looked to the right sideline for
redshirt freshman Jon Pinckney
who was making his first col
legiate start.
Pinckney had given a stop
and-go move to Billy Hughely.
Palumbis hit him in stride and
Pinckney raced down the field
for a 75-yard score.
After a successful conversion,
Stanford led 20-17 and only 153
tioks were left on the clock.
Elation.
The crowd went wild. The
remainder of the 35,000 Stan
ford faithful jumped up and
down, the Band played a rousing
chorus of "All Right Now," I
tried to give a high-five to the
guard at the gate to the field
as I headed for the locker room
(he didn't respond) — Stanford
was on the verge of a miracle
comeback win.
Then, in workmanlike fash
ion, Erik "Air" Wilhelm drove
the Beavers down field with
short passes as he had done all
day. With but nine seconds
remaining, the Cardinal defen
sive unit finally forced a fourth
down.

OSU brought on the field goal
unit. They snapped the ball,
wide receiver Robb Thomas put
down a perfect hold, and place
kicker Troy Bussanich kicked
the ball about a foot-and-a-half
inside the right hand goat post.
Agony.
It was good by less than two
feet, but it was good. If the
NCAA had forgotten to take
down the NFL posts after the
Super Bowl a few years ago, it
would've been wide left. Alas,
they remembered.

If the NCAA had for
gotten to take down

the Super Bowl a
few years ago, the
field goal would've
been wide left. Alas,
they remembered.

If Bryant Hill had caught Wil
helm's pass at the three on the
previous play, time would've ex
pired. Alas, he dropped it.
If Jason Palumbis had hit a
wide open Walter Batson 3:37
into the game, a pass he wanted
back, the Cardinal would've led
by a touchdown and the tone of
the game might've been differ
ent. Alas, he overthrew him.
If Kevin Richardson had
tackled Pat Chaffey with 9:41
left in the first, a play he very
much wanted another chance at,
Chaffey wouldn't have scam
pered 74 yards down field. Alas,

Richardson missed the tackle.
One might think the team
was lower than low, and their
mourner-like faces seemed to
back that up. But it was not
the case.
Instead, the team showed the
positive outlook that comes with
the maturity they have under
gone. Coach Jack Elway said
practice tended to be much bet
ter after a win, but this week
the players knew practice would
have to be extra-special to
prepare for Washington.
"I think we'll have a little
chip on our shoulder [next
week]," fullback Jon Volpe. "I
think we'll give Washington a
good game."
"We'll get over this like we
did the other ones," noseguard
Ray Huckestein said. "[We'll] be
ready to play next week."
"Right now it's just Washing
ton," cornerback Alan Grant
said when asked about his out
look for the rest of the year.
"One game at a time."
"I think we're too mature to
let down and hang our heads
for another week ... Too ma
ture," Grant added.
"No one's just going to pack
it up," Richardson said. "The
game's too fun to just give up.
He added that Stanford could
beat Washington. "We can beat
anyone we play," he said.
"We could still go to a bowl
game if we win the rest of our
games," Volpe said, ever the op
timist.
And, indeed, that's true —
stranger things, like Saturday's
game for instance, have hap
pened.
The Cardinal believes in itself,
and that's half the battle.
