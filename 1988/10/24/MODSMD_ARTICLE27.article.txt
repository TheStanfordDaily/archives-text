Arizona almost pulled Stanford
out of the match, hut the roaring
crowd brought the Cardinal right
back in it. Culminating in a come
from-behind win in the fifth
game, the No. 2 Stanford women's
volleyball team staved off the
threat of an inspired Wildcat club
rated 17th nationally to post a
15-5, 15-12, 11-15, 8-15, 15-8 vic
tory Friday night.

The Cardinal followed with a
four-game win on Saturday,
upending No. 18 Arizona State
15-4, 13-15, 15-3, 15-12. Stanford
now boasts an impressive 18-1
record overall, 10-1 in the Pacific
10 Conference, and is riding a 13-
match win streak — just one away
from tying the school record.
At times on Friday, however, it
seemed that the streak would be
cut short at 11. After the opening

whistle, Arizona raced out to a
seemingly commanding five-point
lead, causing stirrings of anxiety
on the Cardinal bench. Stanford
rectified the situation quickly by
scoring 15 unanswered points to
claim the first game.
"The first game they were
ahead 5-0 and we came back to
score 15 straight points — that's
the Stanford team I'm used to
seeing," junior Jennifer Chaffee
said.
The Cardinal was equally con
vincing in the second game, but
the halftime intermission
diminished Stanford's intensity.
Quick to capitalize, the Wildcats
unleashed a barrage of tough
serves that kept the Cardinal
scrambling, and the persistent
pounding of Terry Lauchner,
Caylin Combs and Kelly Waage's
spikes kept the Stanford squad at
bay.
With the teams tied at two
games apiece, the crowd decided
to assert itself. Junior setter Lara
Asper took her place at the service
line to start the fifth game, and
the 1,021 spectators came alive
with vociferous support that pro

pelled the Cardinal through the
rough spots of the game.
Arizona once again came out
forcefully, earning a 7-1 lead in
very short order. But a powerful,
straight-down kill by freshman
reserve hitter Jodi Birk ignited
the crowd and the team, and Stan
ford rolled back to post a 15-8 win.
"The crowd was awesome,"
Chaffee said of the fifth game sup
port. "I'm surprised they all stuck
around for the game, because the
third and fourth game we didn't
give them much to cheer about.
But in the fifth game it was
awesome: We'd get one play and
we'd be pretty pumped up, but
the crowd would just double it."
"The crowd was great in game
five, and we needed them," Shaw
said. "1 was just thinking that we
need to play better so that we can
get the crowd into this game, and
it did come alive there down 7-1
when we started to play better.
The crowd was a big factor in
helping the momentum turn
around — that's what the home
