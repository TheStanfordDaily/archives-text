# Soccer gets win, tie

### John Kirks Staff writer 
Entering this weekend's two
game set, the Stanford women's
soccer team had its back to the
wall. The heart-breaking 2-1 loss
to Cal State-Hayward on Thurs
day demanded that the Cardinal
bounce back strongly against No.
5 ranked California on Saturday.

Stanford, judging by the
players' crushed, almost morbid,
attitudes after the loss to Cal
State, seemed ready to enter a
classic late-season slump. Coach
Berhane Andeberhan, however,
worked yet another miracle in
preparing his squad for its all
important showdown with the
Golden Bears.
Somehow, some way, the Car
dinal came out fired up and con
fident against the Bears. As the
first half progressed and the Stan
ford women found themselves
running stride-for-stride with the
Bears, the Cardinal's confidence
grew. Granted, Cal thoroughly
controlled play throughout the pe

riod, compiling a shots-on-goal
margin of 9-3 at the half. But, it
was the charged-up Stanford team
that drew first blood.
Cal was pressing forward with
eight out of its ten field players
on Stanford's side of midfield.
Stanford took the ball at midfield
and, after a few crisp passes,
Stacey Keare took the ball up the
right sideline. One Bear defender
drifted to her so Keare unloaded
a sharp crossing pass, trying to
find Jennifer Rowland for a shot.
Keare's pass skipped into a con
glomeration of Cal and Stanford
players right in front of the Cal
goal, and Rowland won the ensu
ing scramble for the ball. She
scored on a shot that Cal goalie
Noreen Paris never could have an
ticipated and gave the Cardinal a
shocking one-goal lead over the
powerful Bears.
Rowland explained her feeling
after her scoring strike: "It was
just so exciting. I was really ner
vous before the goal, but it totally
loosened me up. After that, I
played looser and felt better."
Rowland's goal seemed to break
the ice for the entire Cardinal
squad. At least until the half, that
is.

Midfielder Jennifer Bloomer celebrates her game-winning goal against USIU yesterday. The winning tally came on a penalty kick late
in the second half of the contest.
The Bears came out looking ex
tremely sharp. They forced Stan
ford goalie Elise Edwards to make
a lunging save only rtiinutes into
the half. After she thwarted that
effort, though, the Bears did not
quit. In fact, exactly one minute
later off a corner kick, the Bears
pulled even with Stanford. Shelly

Marsden launched a picture
perfect kick that went directly to
fullback Valerie Pope, and she
made it look easy with a perfectly
executed header that left Edwards
flat-footed.
Edwards accepted the blame for
Cal's goal when she said, "It was
a good corner kick, but I should
have gone out and gotten it." Her
statement revealed the confidence
that she is equipped with these
days.
The game was knotted at 1-1

very early in the second half.
From that point on, both teams
locked themselves into a heated,
scoreless battle. When the dust
settled on Harry Maloney Field
after the two tightly-contested
overtime periods, Stanford had
preserved a tie against the No. 5
ranked team in the nation.
Yesterday, Stanford had to take
the field for the third time in four
days, and the squad certainly
faced the possibility of a letdown
against San Diego's U.S. Interna

tional University.
The Cardinal played sluggishly
for a majority of the game, and,
as has happened so many times
this season, Stanford faced the
prospects of a scoreless tie with
only minutes left in regulation.
Against USIU, it was Jennifer
Bloomer's turn to play heroine.
Late in the second half, she
cracked a penalty kick that beat
USIU goalie Jennifer Swanson,
providing Stanford with yet an
other victorious, 1-0 margin.
