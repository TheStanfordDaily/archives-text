# Booters come up short

### David Hirning Staff writer 
The Stanford men's soccer
team started off a little slowly
yesterday, and then proceeded
to pressure and outplay the
llth-ranked Santa Clara
Broncos the rest of the game.
But an early goal was all the
visitors needed to hold off and
defeat the disappointed Cardi
nal, 1-0.

Men's Soccer
Broncos 1, Cardinal 0

Stanford dropped under .500
for the first time this year, as
its seventh 1-0 loss put the
team at 8-9 on the year. It hap
pened as the Cardinal achieved
its goal of neutralizing Santa
Clara star forward David
Palick, but let leading scorer
Steve Roberts in on a quick
counter with only 11:02 elapsed
in the first half for the score.
"We broke down, our
marking broke down,"
midfielder Luke Garrott said.
"One guy got through, and he
put it away. I thought we
played well defensively, except
for that one play. Unfortunate
ly, we've been breaking down
a lot this year."
"We took too long to get
going — thirty minutes before
we started to play," Coach Sam
Koch said. "I thought we played
super the last 15 minutes of
the first half and in the second
half. It was just a great counter
play by Roberts."
Offensively, Stanford seemed
to have solved the vexing
Bronco defense at the tail end

of the half and had several
loose-ball opportunities in front
of the goal. But keeper Eric
Yamamoto was up to the task,
and was credited with five
saves on the day.
"They played pretty well
defensively in the beginning,
and we didn't do well at all,"
sweeper Mark Semioli said.
"But the last ten minutes of
the first half we had three or
four decent chances, and in the
second half, we had our
chances. We were around their
goal more than they were
around our goal."
A telling statistic may be the
fact that, while the two teams'
shot totals were even at eight,
Cardinal keeper Chris Helling
only had to make two saves on
the day. Stanford switched the
ball well to counter Santa
Clara's "flood the wings" tech
nique of defense.
"Once we got used to their
defense, it didn't really bother
us that much. We played well
as a team — it wasn't like we
were beaten (badly)," forward
Evan Nadler said. "We've
played better teams, and we've
beaten better teams."
But, once again the early goal
stood up and ended up haunt
ing Stanford, as the players
failed to get the blistering shots
off when they needed to. "I
knew that once they got one
goal up on us, it's really tough
because their defense becomes
that much more difficult to get
through." Semioli said.
As billed, the game was ex
tremely physical, and the ref
eree dictated the much of the
action. Santa Clara was
whistled for 26 penalties, while
the Cardinal racked up 16.
