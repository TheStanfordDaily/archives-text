# Time limit urges stop-and-go voting
## 
### Kevin Wacknov 
On Nov. 8, be prepared with a com
pleted sample ballot — after 10 minutes
at the voting booth you may be told
you're taking too long.
Because of this year's unusually long
list of initiatives, the Santa Clara
County sample ballot reminds voters of
a nearly forgotten California law that
limits polling time to .10 minutes. Al
though enforcement of the law will prob
ably be spotty, election officers say they
will remind voters of the law at the polls.
Santa Clara and Sonoma counties,
among others in the Bay Area, are
taking these steps to keep anticipated
long lines moving quickly.
"We're not going to kick anyone out
of a booth," said John Molchen, Santa
Clara County's assistant registrar of
voters, "just remind them if they've

'We're not going to kick
anyone out of a booth.'
— John Molchen

gone over the limit. And even then, only
when lines are long."
"Many people are sending absentee
ballots to avoid the long lines," Molchen
said, adding that the longest lines will
probably be around 4 and 5 p.m.
"If people pre-mark their sample bal
lots before coming to the polls, I don't
think there will be any problems," he
said.
In some places, the long state ballot
is lengthened by local measures. Cali
fornia's ballot has 29 measures, but San
Francisco residents have an additional

26 city measures to vote on. Despite
the concern over long lines in Santa
Clara County, the time concern is mostly
affecting San Francisco, according to
George Mann, Santa Clara registrar of
voters.
The number of "vote-o-matics," or
hole-punch voting devices, per precinct
in Santa Clara County is proportional
to the number of voters in that precinct.
Mann estimates there will be four to
six vote-o-matics per polling place in
Stanford precincts.
Of Santa Clara County's 756,452 reg
istered voters, about 75 percent are ex
pected to turn out at the polls. Of reg
istered voters, about 51 percent are reg
istered Democrats, 36 percent Republi
cans, 11 percent nonpartisans and 2
percent in the American Independent,
Peace and Freedom and Libertarian par
ties combined.
