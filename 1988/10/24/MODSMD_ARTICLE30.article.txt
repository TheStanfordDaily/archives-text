Welcome to the wonderful world
of Stanford water polo, where the
ball seems to go everywhere but
in the the opponent's goal.
The previously third-ranked
Cardinal had more than a little
trouble locating the net this past
weekend, dropping Friday's con
test 5-4 to Long Beach, squander
ing Saturday's game to Southern
California 9-6, and managing only
seven goals against Pacific in a
win which capped off the weekend.
"Basically all it boils down to
is terrible shooting," Stanford
Coach Dante Dettamanti said.
Although Stanford's offense has
been lethagic the whole season, it
forgot to arrive at deGuerre pool
Friday and Saturday. Not only
was the Cardinal unable to throw
accurate strikes, in many cases it
never got the ball off, either run
ning out the 35 second shot clock
or squandering the ball to the
swarming 49er and Trojan
defenders. ,
The Cardinal defintely was in
a slump against both fifth-ranked
Long Beach and fourth-rated
USC. After surrendering a 1-1 tie
to the 49ers at the end of the
first quarter the Stanford six
played catch-up the remainder of
the contest.
The squad failed to score the
entire second period of play, shoot
ing after the buzzer sounded,
aiming at the crossbars, or tossing
strikes right to the Long Beach
goalkeeper. At the half, the Car
dinal found itself in a hole, 3-1.
The Cardinal temporarily
emerged from its fog to open the
third quarter. Accurate six-on-five
strikes from drivers Steve Mil
lham and Greg Loos tied the con
test at three-all in the first two
and-a-half minutes of play, but
Andrew Lawson's aborted fast
break ended the Cardinal come
back.
Although the Stanford defense
played tough, allowing only five
49er goals and holding dominant
6-foot-8-inch holeman Cyle Kopp
to only two strikes, the offensive
skills of the squad were not up
to-par.

A counterattack goal by Rick
McNair did put the Cardinal in a
position to send the game into
overtime. But, in a microcosm of
the entire contest, holeman Erik
Blum's shot with 20 seconds to
play was blocked, giving the 49ers
a 5-4 victory.
"We outplayed them all the way
but they got the win because we
couldn't get the ball in the hole,"
Millham said. "It's either all or
nothing. We shoot 80 percent or
15 percent."
Saturday was more of the same.
Shooters were unable to defrost
from the previous day's contest.
The Cardinal did not resemble the
squad which had defeated its
Pacific 10 Conference foe in the
squads' previous two meetings
this season, 11-9 and 10-6.
Once again Stanford scored
first, taking a 1-0 lead on John
Swerdloff's strike with two
minutes remaining in the first
quarter. And once again that was
to be the Cardinal's only advan
tage of the game.
Not only was Stanford's offense
in a state of deep-freeze, its
usually potent offense let up, al
lowing the Trojans to score almost
at will. The team was unable to

slow down USC's first-string
holeman, Zoltan Berty, who tallied
five of the Trojans' nine goals and
was in Cardinal shooters' faces
the entire game.
"The two-meter position cost us
the entire game," Dettamanti said.
"USC exposed our weakness of
not being able to guard the
holeman."
The Trojans jumped to a 7-3
lead in the third period after ren
dering the Cardinal scoring attack
defenseless. However, Andrew
Lawson's strike with one minute
left in the quarter (the only Stan
ford goal of the period) seemed
to have started a rally.
Chuck Maguy answered with a
score off of Greg Olson's steal and
break away to open the final seven
minutes. But two was the closest
the Cardinal would come, as it
once again was unable to find the
net or stop the Trojan attack.
Stanford recorded its only vic
tory of the weekend Sunday, de
feating UOP in Stockton with the
aid of some two-meter scoring
from Blum and Greg Morris. "I'm
still not pleased with our goal pro
duction but we were able to score
a few more goals out of the hole,"
Dettamanti said.

The Stanford water polo team took many shots this weekend in
its three games against Long Beach State, USC, and UOP. Unfortu
nately not enough of them went in and the squad went 1-2.
