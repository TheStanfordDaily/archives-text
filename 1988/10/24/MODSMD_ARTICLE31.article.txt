# Two in a row for Dunn
## Senior defends title at Hayward 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
Although Stanford's tennis
season does not get into full swing
until February, with the opening
of its brand-new tennis stadium
on campus, you couldn't prove it
by some members of the squad
who have been traveling the coun
try playing in preseason events.
By far, the team's preseason
standout is senior Curtis Dunn,
a walk-on to the team his fresh
man year and the squad's only
fourth-year player. For the second
year in a row, Dunn won the
regional qualifying tournament
for the Rolex National Indoor In
vitational. The Invitational itself
will be held in February in Min
neapolis.
"The Rolex qualifier is a very
high-powered tournament," Stan
ford Asst. Coach John Whitlinger
said. "It's a great honor for Curtis
to win. Overall, I thought the guys
did a great job."

Junior Jeff Tarango, a 1988 All-
America, is back for Stanford, and
he and classmate Barry Richards
also qualified for the Rolex In
doors by defeating Carl Chang
and Matt Lucena of California in
doubles.
More recently, Tarango and
sophomore teammate Martin
Blackman were in action at the
Volvo All-America tournament.
Tarango, the No. 2 seed, reached
the semifinals before succumbing
to unseeded but dangerous
Malavai Washington of Michigan,
6-1, 6-1. Blackman, who is
projected at No. 2 singles for Stan
ford this year, fell to Todd Martin
in an early round, 6-2, 6-2.
The Cardinal began practice in
the first week of October, in its
year-long march toward capture
a second consecutive NCAA cham
pionship.
If the early season is any in
dicator, Stanford should have no
problem in its quest, especially
with the likes of Dunn.
