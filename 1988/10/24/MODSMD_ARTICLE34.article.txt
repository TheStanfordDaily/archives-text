# Private eye investigates job's ethics

### Amy Arends 
"How do I judge? How can I
get to a position where I can
morally judge what's right in a
case? I'm saying you can't," said
private investigator and former
Philosophy Prof. Josiah Thomp
son Thursday night.
Before a crowd of about 40 stu
dents in Branner Hall, the author
of the bestseller "Gumshoe," said,
"You choose worlds and you
choose to work towards a partic
ular kind of world rather than
another. . . I'm not going to be
lieve that my vision of the world
is ultimately justified and yours

When taking a case and deciding
how to go about it, Thompson said
he uses "aesthetic criteria or

criteria for the craft."
"Doing the case elegantly, that
is the criteria, with the kind of
grace and economy you fud in a
find painting. Do it that way
rather than clumsily, inefficiently
or stupidly," he said.
That is one reason Thompson
said he does not carry a gun. "It's
safer not to carry a gun. It's well
known on the streets that I don't
carry one. It's also safer because
I'd probably shoot myself in the
foot with it or have it used against
me.
"In terms of my attitude, I don't
want to do it because of the craft,
because it's going to skew my at
titudes in dealing with people."
He added, "If any detective ever
had to use his gun, he would have
made a whole lot of mistakes in

the way he handled things."
Private investigator Ed Piggins
of Harder and Associates, who was
interviewed after the speech,
agreed. "I don't carry a weapon.
I would prefer to take the safety
approach."
"I don't play a hero's role if
there is any danger or problem
I'm facing. I'd rather contact the
police. I'd compare it to a den of
snakes. You don't walk in and
start kicking them. You walk
around them. I'd call for local as
sistance."
Ironically, Thompson pointed
out that "the client is the basic
source of danger in the case be
cause somebody comes to you and
says, 'I want you to do 'x' and
here's why.'"
"Clearly, they want you to do

'x,' but there may be another why.
The first question I always ask
is, 'Why me? I'm not listed in the
yellow pages.' Then you check
backwards on the client."
Piggins, who is listed in the yel
low pages, said, "Often times,
people will ask me for informa
tion. I have to ask myself, 'Why
do they want it?' I try to make
a judgment based on what they're
going to use the information for.
It's a judgment we private inves
tigators all have to make."
Thompson's speech and also his
book dealt with an actual case
that took him to Bombay, India,
to rescue a child who had been
kidnapped and taken from the
United States by her father, Kris
hin.
