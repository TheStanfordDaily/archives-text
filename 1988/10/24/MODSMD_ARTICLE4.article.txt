# Peace aid needed, not guns
## Doctor calls negotiations key to peace in El Salvador 
### Susan Infantino 
Calling the situation in El Salvador "the
first foreign policy crisis of the next pres
ident," Dr. Charles Clements stated at a
speech Thursday evening that negotiations
are the solution to that country's internal
conflict.
A one-time B-52 flyer in the Vietnam
War and now a leader in humanitarian
service for Central American countries, Cle
ments stated before over 100 people at
Kresge Auditorium that the current U.S.
policy of intense military aid to El Salvador
will not bring about peace.
Instead, he suggested the most effective
policy for achieving peace would be for
Congress to end such military expenditures,
in the hopes that U.S. economic leverage
could force El Salvador to turn to negoti
ation procedures to solve its problems.
"Negotiations are not a sign of weakness,
as the Reagan Administration has sig
naled," Clements said. "I have the hope
that in El Salvador that kind of solution
could be found."
Asked to comment on Clements' call for

negotiations in a phone interview Friday
afternoon, Senior Hoover Research Fellow
Robert Wesson indicated that they were
basically futile.
"They've tried negotiations, tbut) it's
pretty hard to negotiate when the two sides
are basically at odds," Wesson said. "It's
a very messy situation. I don't think the
U.S. can do much about it."
In hia speech, Clements also stressed that
beyond the struggle of military war in El
Salvador, "a whole social struggle is taking
place, ... a struggle for survival."
Relating numerous first-hand accounts
of the lack of medical aid in El Salvador,
and speaking of such government military
tactics as search-and-destroy and citizen
massacres, Clements stated that "the issue
is basic human dignity." •
For Clements, basic human dignity
means, at a minimum, improving health
care and human rights conditions. Accord
ing to Clements, the citizens fight without
the right to speak out,
"Until those problems are resolved, there
will be no peace in Central America,"he
said.
