# Kennedy speech spotlights racism
## Group marches at welcome to parents 
### Kathy Lachenauer Editorial staff 
Rather than deliver a light
hearted welcome, University
President Donald Kennedy called
on Stanford parents Saturday to
reflect on the implications of last
week's radal incidents at Ujamaa
House.
"You should [talk] with one an
other, with your son or daughter
or friends about racism, about
these matters," Kennedy told
more than 1,200 parents gathered
in the inner Quad for his early
morning Parents' Weekend ad
dress.
Kennedy dedicated almost 15
minutes of his 20-minute welcome
to addressing the events at
Ujamaa.
As Kennedy rose to begin his
address, about 45 members of the
Students of Color Coalition

marched in a silent protest behind
the podium Kennedy spoke from.
According to coalition member
Lucky Gutierrez, the protest was
designed to "send a message to
President Kennedy that we are
organized" and to inform parents
that "all is not well at Stanford."
Comprised of the Black Student
Union, the Asian-American Stu
dent Association, Stanford Amer
ican Indian Organization and
MEChA, a Chicano student organ
ization, the coalition was formed
last week. The group is currently
working on a press statement to
be released this week.
Director of Parents' Weekend
Debbie Duncan said Kennedy gave
a more "issue-oriented speech"
than he has in the past.
Typically, he delivers a general
speech that covers several differ
ent issues but this time he
"thought such an important issue
needed to be addressed," she said.
Kennedy has spoken at every Par
ents' Weekend since the event's
creation four years ago.
Kennedy is out of town until
Tuesday and was unavailable for
comment.
Duncan said the coalition did
not inform her of the demonstra
tion beforehand. She speculated
that Kennedy was caught off
guard as well.
"I don't know if he planned the
speech; he's very good at respond
ing on his feet," Duncan said.
Surprised that Kennedy focused
on the events at Ujamaa, Gutier
rez, a senior and co-chair of
MEChA, said the coalition did not
stay to hear the speech.
"We didn't think he'd actually
address the issue," Gutierrez said.
On Oct. 16, two Stanford fresh
men confessed to drawing a
derogatory caricature of a black
man on a poster of Beethoven
found on a bullitin board next to
a Ujamaa resident's door. Also

found in Ujamaa was a fraternity
party announcement with the
word "nigger" scrawled on it in
all capitals.
While Kennedy spent the first
three minutes of his speech prais
ing the "terrific" accomplish
ments of students here, he then
shifted tones and called attention
to what he called a "dignified but
very concerned demonstration
by the coalition.
Kennedy went on to explain that
the Ujamaa incidents have caused
"acute concern" at Stanford be
cause "we are a community ...
where difference is not merely
tolerated but celebrated."
Admitting that "a soft back
lash" could result from last week's
incidents, Kennedy called on par
ents to "please explain why this
is such a big deal."
Edward Sondik, a visiting par
ent from Washington D.C., said
Kennedy would have made "a big
mistake" if he had not addressed
the events at hand.
According to Patrick Dave, a
parent from Pasadena, Kennedy
"sensitively dealt with" issues
that had confused him — and
other parents. "A lot of parents
did not know what was happen
ing," Dave said.
