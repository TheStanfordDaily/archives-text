# USW says bosses mismanage SLAC
## 
### Laura Jacobson Senior staff writer 
The United Stanford Workers
made a series of allegations last
week of "cover up" and "misman
agement" at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center.
However, the University says
these charges are "irresponsible"
and purposely timed to coincide
with labor contract negotiations
that reach a final stage this week.
After a press conference held in
Oakland last Wednesday to "doc
ument a cover up of misused tax
payers' dollars by the Department
of Energy," according to a USW
press release, the USW charged
the University with "padding the
budget" at SLAC and "illegal"
contracting practices.
The DOE, which has a role in
financing and overseeing SLAC,
has not responded to the union's
requests for investigation, accord
ing to USW attorney Jim Eggles
ton.
"There is a calculated plan to
conceal information on sub
contracting practices (at SLAC)
which violates the Collective Bar

gaining Agreement and raises
questions about the DOE con
tract," Eggleston said.
But after hearing these allega
tions, University lawyer Michael
Vartain called them "blatantly ir
responsible.
"It is simply unfortunate that
the union is engaging in that kind
of publicity at a time when it has
given a strike deadline in negoti
ations," he said.
In addition to the press confer
ence, the union filed a suit in San
Mateo last Tuesday which also ac
cuses the University of concealing
information.
On Aug. 24, two SLAC employ
ees were required to appear at a
grievance arbitration with docu
ments which would demonstrate
that the recent layoff of six union
employees directly resulted from
SLAC's policy of contracting work
to outside corporations.
"The two people were directed
by Stanford not to appear," Eg
gleston said.
In response to these allegations,

Vartain said that this case il
lustrates the USW's "unfortunate
practice of papering SLAC with
subpoenas."
Speaking in general, Vartain
added that "subpoenas are
governed by strict legal rules
which the union has often times
failed to follow."
Vartain also said he questioned
why the union had waited until
this week to file the court case.
They are concerned "not with
resolving the subpoena issue, but
with publicity purposes," Vartain
said.
He added that every three years
during contract negotiations the
union makes a "generic informa
tion request," even though "the
union has historical information
about SLAC's contracting and em
ployment practices."
Vartain also said that the union
was "putting pressure on the Uni
versity" during a sensitive time
in negotiations.
The union also accused the Uni
versity last week of doing several
hundred thousand dollars in
unneeded maintenance work
(such as the painting of an
"unused" building) in order to
"pad" the annual budget.
