### Laura Jacobson Senior staff writer 
The United Stanford Workers
made a series of allegations last
week of "cover up" and "misman
agement" at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center.
However, the University says
these charges are "irresponsible"
and purposely timed to coincide
with labor contract negotiations
that reach a final stage this week.
After a press conference held in
Oakland last Wednesday to "doc
ument a cover up of misused tax
payers' dollars by the Department
of Energy," according to a USW
press release, the USW charged
the University with "padding the
budget" at SLAC and "illegal"
contracting practices.
The DOE, which has a role in
financing and overseeing SLAC,
has not responded to the union's
requests for investigation, accord
ing to USW attorney Jim Eggles
ton.
"There is a calculated plan to
conceal information on sub
contracting practices (at SLAC)
which violates the Collective Bar

gaining Agreement and raises
questions about the DOE con
tract," Eggleston said.
But after hearing these allega
tions, University lawyer Michael
Vartain called them "blatantly ir
responsible.
