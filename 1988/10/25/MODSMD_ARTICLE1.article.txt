# Roble will be open fall 1989
## Discovery of asbestos delayed reconstruction over two months 
### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
With repair work set to end Aug. 31,
1989, Roble Hall will open for student
residents next fall, University Construc
tion Supervisor Maggie Burgett said
yesterday.
Roble was shut down last December
when University officials judged the 70-
year-old residence to be seismically un
safe. The 294 students living in Roble
last year were forced to relocate in other
dormitories or live off campus.
Last spring, the Stanford Board of
Trustees set a $6 to $7 million budget
and a September 1989 deadline for the
dorm's reconstruction.
Earthquake bracing and restructur
ing work will be completed at Roble —
Stanford's second-oldest — by Aug. 31.,
Burgett said.
Repair work is meeting its timetable
and is costing less than was expected.
According to University Project Man
ager John Ryan, Roble's anticipated
construction cost is now $5.82 million.
"We're pretty confident that we'll hit
that budget," Ryan said.
"It's a big job and we're working
diligently to get the building back by
fall of next year," he said, adding that
there are "50,000 man-hours that have
to go into the building. There have been
lots of surprises — lots of asbestos,
electrical system problems."

earth from under Roble, said Dan Ait
kin, construction foreman for C. Overaa
Co., the general contractor.
Construction workers are using
shovels and small tools to remove earth
in the Roble basements because excava
tion machines are too large to fit in the
spaces, he said.
The painstaking earth removal is
needed to set up bases for the massive
footings, which will anchor eight con
crete towers placed throughout the
structure, Aitkin said. The pits are as
large as eight feet deep and one pit
under the kitchen held about 35 cubic
yards of dirt.
The towers, along with tie-beams and
a plywood diaphragm in the roof, should
brace the building and help hold it to
gether in the event of an earthquake.
No dorm rooms will be eliminated from
Roble, Aitkin said, and the renovation
will not cause any appearance changes.
Subcontractors for electrical systems,
plumbing, walls and other specialized
areas will submit bids by Thursday, ac

cording to Steve Ferria, a C. Overra
project manager.
Improvements not related to earth
quake safety are also planned in Roble.
Changes include a revised kitchen with
new appliances and a different layout,
new stairs in the A-wing from the first
floor to the basement and a reconfigured
basement. A sprinkler system will also
be installed to supplement Roble's exist
ing fire alarms.
Ferria estimated that construction
was set back by two and a half months
when workers came across asbestos.
"It's all cleaned out now," he said.
But Suzanne Tamiesie, manager of
student housing, said only asbestos "ex
posed during construction work" was
removed. "There is still some asbestos
in the building," she said. "We don't
have an unsafe situation so we're not
removing all of it."
Roble could be opened sooner "if we
paid the contractor a premium," Assit.
Provost John Hughes said. "Students
would have to pay extra — double shifts,
weekends."
According to Hughes, projects like
Roble are difficult to finance because
alumni donors "like giving funds to en
dow faculty chairs and provide books to
the library," but rarely give money for
student housing.
"Roughly half' of the funds for the
project are coming from profits the Uni
versity made previously by re-financing
long-term debt, according to Hughes.

Roble construct.on, as seen through the fence, is well underway after delays In
removing asbestos. The popular residence is slated for re-opening next fall after
tests last year deemed the building to be seismically unsound.
