## Hostage photographs may be intended for American group 
### 
MILAN, Italy (AP) â€” An in
vestigator said yesterday that an
American group may have been
the intended recipient of photo
graphs of U.S. hostages found in
the suitcase of a Lebanese airline
passenger.
Photographs of American
hostages Terry Anderson and
Alann Steen, along with a letter
bearing Steen's name and a third
photo, were found last Thursday
in the luggage of a woman pas
senger from Beirut at Milan's
Linate airport.
Police said the Lebanese wom
an, who was arrested, was to
deliver the photos and documents
to Aldo Anghessa, an Italian arms
trader with known links to the
Italian and Swiss secret services.
"We know the group that
shipped them (documents and pic
tures) and we identified the man
who delivered the material to the
Lebanese woman," said Achille
Serra, head of Milan's anti
terrorist police.
"Anghessa acted as a go
between, between the two
groups," he added. "One party
was a Lebanese organization. We
have identified the final destina
tion. We cannot tell you about the
latter."
Pressed about the final desti
nation, Serra said: "You know an
American organization is inter
ested in getting this material. You
have the experience to understand
which one."
Later yesterday Serra said he
had not suggested the U.S. gov

ernment was to receive the pic
tures and documents, and insisted
he had been speculating earlier
and was not giving an official con
clusion.
Police identified the woman as
Aline Ibrahim Rizkallah, 36. In
Beirut, the Islamic Jihad group
that holds Anderson said she was
not a member of its organization.
In Washington, State Depart
ment spokesman Charles Redman
said Anghessa had no connection
to the U.S. government and Amer
ican officials did not know what
he intended to do with the docu
ments.
Redman said the United States
believes those who act without
U.S. government authorization to
try to free the hostages in
Lebanon "should butt out."
He also said the affair might
be a fraud and that the photo
graphs did not appear to be
originals.
President Reagan was asked at
a White House tree planting cer
emony whether anyone from the
United States government was
dealing with the Iranians about
the hostages and said, "Not to my
knowledge," adding, "They
wouldn't be doing it without my
knowledge."
The picture of Anderson, the
chief Middle East correspondent
for the Associated Press, appeared
similar (in reverse image) to a
black and white photograph of An
derson released in Beirut on Aug.
18.
The man in the third photo

graph initially had been identified
as American hostage Thomas
Sutherland, but police later said
it was not him.
Ms. Rizkallah was jailed in
Milan after police also found she
was carrying $1,000 in counterfeit
U.S. bills and 1.7 ounces of
heroin.
Anghessa has been interrogated
but not arrested and there is no
evidence he had commited a
crime, police said.
The Rome-based newspaper II
Messaggero quoted Anghessa as
saying he knew nothing about Ms.
Rizkallah or her parcels and he
was willing to cooperate with in
vestigators.
Islamic Jihad, in an Arabic
language statement distributed in
Lebanon, said Ms. Rizkallah was
not involved "in any matter
related to us whatsoever" and
claimed she had links with Israel's
secret service. It called the pho
tograph of Anderson "sheer
fabrication."
Anderson, 40, was kidnapped in
Beirut March 16, 1985, and is the
longest held of the 14 foreigners,
including nine American, missing
and presumed kidnapped in
Lebanon.
Sutherland, 56, of Fort Collins,
Colo., was acting dean of agricul
ture at the American University
of Beirut when he was abducted
June 9, 1985.
Steen, 49, of Boston, a professor
at Beirut University College, was
kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987 by the
Islamic Jihad.
