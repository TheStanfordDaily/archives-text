Joan weakens to tropical storm
GUATEMALA CITY (AP) - Guatemala and
El Salvador were under states of alert yesterday
as Tropical Storm Miriam whirled offshore, and
other Latin American countries devastated by
the storm struggled to aid victims.
Hurricane Joan left at least 111 people dead
in five countries over the past week and ripped
across Nicaragua from the Atlantic coast to the
Pacific .before it was downgraded to a tropical
storm and renamed Miriam.
Forecasters had feared the storm would regain
strength and become a hurricane again as it
reached the warm waters of the Pacific, but they
said Monday that it was sticking too close to the
coast to gather force.
The known death toll from the weeklong storm
was 50 people in Nicaragua over the weekend,
21 in Costa Rica, four in Panama, 25 in Colombia
and 11 in Venezuela. The storm affected all Cen
tral American countries except tiny Belize and
left hundreds of thousands of people homeless.
Car bomb kills 2 in South Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) — A
car bomb exploded outside a shopping center in
the coal-mining town of Witbank yesterday, kil
ling two people and injuring 42 others, police said.
The explosion occurred at 8:14 a.m. in the
parking lot of a shopping center in downtown
Witbank, about 60 miles east of Johannesburg,
said police spokesman Capt. Ruben Bloomberg.

Bloomberg said the injured included 23 whites
and 19 blacks, one of them a woman who lost
her left foot.
Bombings and hand-grenade attacks have been
occurring in South Africa at a rate of more than
one a day since early September. Police say most
are part of an intimidation campaign waged by
the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla
movement to disrupt nationwide municipal elec
tions scheduled for Wednesday.
The ANC has said it seeks to undermine the
elections but has neither claimed nor denied re
sponsibility for specific recent bombings.
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who has
openly defied emergency regulations by calling
for an election boycott, condemned the bombing.
"While I regard the struggle to end apartheid
as a legitimate one, methods such as this are
abhorrent in moral terms and counter-productive
in practical terms," Tutu said.
Also yesterday:
• Police fired tear gas into dormitories to break
up a rally by about 500 students calling for
election boycott at the University of the Western
Cape outside Cape Town, witnesses said.
• A filmmaker said police had seized a nearly
completed documentary film about the impact of
South African rule in South-West Africa, the
territory also known as Namibia. Kevin Harris
said the 58-minute film, "Namibia: No Easy Road
To Freedom," was seized last week from a Johan
nesburg studio where the final version of the
master videotape was being prepared.
