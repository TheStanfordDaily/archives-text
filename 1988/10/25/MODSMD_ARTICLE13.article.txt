# Gorbachev calls reforms a success

MOSCOW (AP) - President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev said at a
state dinner yesterday for West
Germany's Helmut Kohl that
the Soviet Union is not an "eco
nomic backyard" and reforms
are succeeding despite interna
tional doubts.
Lack of progress in relations
with the Soviet Union "feeds on
the outdated stereotypes that
the Russians will not be able to
manage by themselves," he said.
"I want to say to all who are
going to have business with us:
we will manage."
Gorbachev, who also heads
the Soviet Communist Party,
seemed to be replying to ques
tions raised in the West about
his ability to stay in power and
install his reform program

through the upheaval it is al
ready beginning to cause.
There has been considerable
controversy over the $9 billion
in credits Moscow has arranged
in recent months from Western
banks, including some in West
Germany. Some politicians op
pose such lending, saying the
Soviet Union should be forced
to cut defense spending in order
to increase the production of
needed food and consumer prod
ucts.
Gorbachev told Soviet televi
sion earlier that he and Chan
cellor Kohl had started their
first meeting of the four-day of
ficial visit with cordial discus
sions of difficult issues and he
said "we have a real chance" to
achieve a substantial improve

ment in relations.
"The ice has started to move,
and we hope it will start to float
away," Gorbachev said.
Monday's meeting was the
first formal meeting between
the two men since Gorbachev
became the Soviet leader in
1985.
Warmer relations with West
Germany would be a significant
change. The Soviet Union has
for decades acted as if the Nazi
invasion occurred yesterday
rather than almost 50 years ago.
However, Gorbachev refused
to budge from Moscow's
longtime refusal to consider any
move toward the unification of
East and West Germany.
Kohl, in his address, called
for a "healing of old wounds."
