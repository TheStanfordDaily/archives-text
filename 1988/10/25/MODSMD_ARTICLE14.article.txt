# Typhoon Ruby hits Philippines
## 
### 
MANILA, Philippines (AP) —
Typhoon Ruby pounded the
Philippines yesterday with heavy
rains and wind gusts up to 140
mph, triggering floods, mud slides
and tidal surges that killed at least
13 people and left 47,000 home
less.
Another 30 people were missing
and feared dead in a storm-related
bus accident and an inter-island
vessel with nearly 500 passengers
and crew was missing in stormy
seas, the military said.
The missing vessel, the
Marilyn, reported engine trouble
en route from Manila to Tacloban
City and could have taken shelter
in an isolated harbor, the coast
guard said. It was last reported
about 200 miles southeast of
Manila.
Power outages and scattered
flooding hit Manila early today as
Ruby approached. At 11 p.m.
Monday, Ruby had sustained
winds of 115 mph and its center

was moving northwest at 16 mph
toward densely populated central
Luzon Island.
The U.S. military's television
network reported wind gusts up
to 140 mph. "This is one of the
worst typhoons this year," said
Juanito Lirios, deputy weather
service director. "Manila is in
great danger. Let us not take
chances. If we do not take care
then there could be a great loss
of lives."
Some commercial flights were
canceled and schools were closed
in Manila. All six U.S. military
bases in the Philippines were put
on maximum storm alert.
Ruby was expected to pass 50
miles west-northwest of Manila
this morning.
States of emergency were
declared in some areas of the
southern Mindanao Island, and
thousands of people were
evacuated.
Ruby is the 18th typhoon or

tropical storm to hit the Philip
pines this year and the second in
four days. There were conflicting
reports on casualties because the
storm knocked out communica
tions.
Rodrigo Roldan, civil defense di
rector on Panay Island, said at
least five people were killed yes
terday when a bus careened off a
bridge during heavy winds and
rain, and plunged into a river.
The army said another 30 pas
sengers were missing and
presumed dead. The government
run Philippines News Agency said
most of the passengers were sleep
ing when the accident occurred
and could not escape.
Simeon Licayan, executive sec
retary of Cagayan de Oro, said
seven people were killed Sunday
when tornados prompted by the
advancing typhoon struck remote
villages near the city 500 miles
south of Manila.
