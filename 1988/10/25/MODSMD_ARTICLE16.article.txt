## Let students judge 
### 
Judicial Affairs Officer
should work with group
of students on cases

STANFORD'S Judicial Affairs
system needs revamping.
Though the wording in the
Fundamental Standard might
seem too broad and vague, the real
problem lies in the University jud
icial system, which handles charges
of student conduct violations.
As the system now stands, too
much decision-making power rests
with one person — the Judicial
Affairs Officer.
The wording of the Fundamental
Standard may not be specific, but
by allowing for many broad inter
pretations it can be used to cover
all areas of behavior — from the
misuse of a meal card to homopho
bic or racist acts.
But the burden of deciding
whether to open a student conduct
case rests solely on the Judicial
Affairs Officer.
People who feel that the Funda
mental Standard has been violated
present their complaints to the
Judicial Affairs Officer. Then, the
Judicial Affairs Officer inves
tigates these complaints and
decides whether to open a case.
If a case is opened, the judicial
process kicks into gear and either
the Dean of Student Affairs or the
Stanford Judicial Council ulti
mately decides whether the Fun
damental Standard has, in fact,

been violated.
If the Judicial Affairs Officer
decides not to open a case, the
buck stops there, placing too much
authority in the hands of one per
son.
It is not simply a matter of a
few cases not being opened. Last
year, the Judicial Affairs Officer
decided not to act on almost half
of the student conduct complaints
that were made.
Recently, the Judicial Affairs Of
ficer decided not open the case con
cerning the vigil in front of Otero
last spring because it was not a
clear-cut violation of the Funda
mental Standard.
The role of the University judi
cial system should be to clear up
ambiguities, not cover them up.
Just because a case is opened, it
does not mean that the defendants
are guilty. But, when a case is not
opened, it sends out a message that
the Fundamental Standard has not
been violated, and that the behav
ior in question is acceptable.
As an alternative to the present
system, the University should es
tablish a committee of students, to
act in conjunction with the Judicial
Affairs Officer, to decide whether
a case should be opened. This
would allow for a system of checks
and balances, which the present
system lacks.
The Fundamental Standard is a
code of conduct for students.
Therefore, students should play a
major role in deciding what behav
ior is acceptable in their commu
nity and what behavior is not.
