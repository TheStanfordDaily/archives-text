ASSU senate should have agreed to bring Calero here

SOMETHING AWFUL happened at
last Thursday's ASSU Senate
meeting.
The ASSU Speakers' Bureau pre
sented a resolution to the senate
proposing a $4000 honorarium for
Adolfo Calero, the leader of the
Nicaraguan Contras, to come to
campus and participate in an open
debate in early November. The Bureau
had already secured a date for this
appearance, and only needed approval
because the honorarium exceeded the
standard amount of $2500.
Although I strongly oppose Calero
and the Nicaraguan Contras, I believed
that his presence on campus would
spark intellectual debate on U.S.
foreign policy and Reagan's conserva
tive doctrine. Unfortunately, the ASSU
senators chose to deny all Stanford

students this unique educational oppor
tunity. Stacey Leyton, a member of the
Council of Presidents, drafted a resolu
tion which essentially forbids Calero
from speaking on campus, and the
resolution passed 9-8. Even though I
am an ASSU senator, I must denounce
the ASSU Senate on this issue.
The students of this University
elected us to express their viewpoints
and uphold their beliefs. Hence it is
unfair to the general student popula
tion that a few people with extreme
leftist views, views farther to the left
than those of most students, make
decisions based solely on their own
beliefs and thus thwart attempts at a
more balanced education.
Admittedly, the Speakers' Bureau did
not give the senate enough information
regarding Calero's visit, but when I

proposed a special meeting of the
senate to debate this issue when we
possess all the facts, the senators
denied my request and chose instead to
adhere to their close-minded, radical
misconceptions of the implications of
Calero's visit.
They claim that this is not an issue
of censorship — that Calero is welcome
to colbe and speak on campus — just
that the senate refuses to use student
money to fund his visit. Nonetheless,
th<sy are in effect assuring that this
program never takes place, and per
haps setting the precedent that a
speaker's view must conform with
those of the senators if the speaker
wishes to receive an honorarium.
It is clear that our representative
democracy has its faults, especially

when only a small percentage of the
student population votes in the spring
elections. But since the elections have
taken place and the senate seats are
occupied, the decision making rests in
the hands of the few.
I strongly urge my fellow senators to
reconsider their obligations to the
students who elected them. By refusing
to hear a point of view that diametri
cally opposes their own, the senators
have alienated their constituency and
failed to exhibit the openmindedness
that is supposedly characteristic of
Stanford students. It is time for my
fellow senators to temporarily disregard
their personal, extremist beliefs and
remember their commitment to the
Stanford public.
