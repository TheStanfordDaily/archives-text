# All students have a role to play in the fight against racism
## 
### 
We all know that every student has
a role to play in fighting racism at
Stanford, but sometimes it's not clear
exactly what that role is. Most Stan
ford students respect and applaud the
role MEChA, BSU, AASA or SAIO play
on campus in fighting racism and
building a more inclusive university.
We know that their work strengthens
their communities and thereby enriches
Stanford socially, culturally and intel
lectually.
The problem is that those of us that
feel this way often allow more vocal
and aggressive students to air racist
views, either because we're told to be
"open to differences" or because it's
just too uncomfortable to take a public

stand against one of our classmates or
housemates. Sometimes we just don't
know how to take a stand.
The incident at Otero last spring and
the recent events at Ujamaa House are
results of a campus atmosphere and
University institutions which neither
encourage nor empower students to
take a strong stand against racism in
their dorms, classes and curricula.
As long as white students remain
silent in the face of racist acts and
attitudes, students of color will be iso
lated and unsupported in their efforts
to make Stanford a more democratic
institution.
We know that we can, we should, we
must take responsiblity for working
alongside students of color to fight
racism and injustice at Stanford.
The recent events at Ujamaa are
neither isolated events nor misun
derstood manifestations of student ig
norance. Across the country, African-
American students are harassed in

their dorms while other students form
white student union and wear T-shirts
with racist slogans.
The past years at Stanford have seen
a series of racist incidents and a
growing backlash against students of
color as the BSU, MEChA, AASA and
the SAIO have demanded to be
respected and accepted as permanent
and valuable parts of the Stanford
community. It's time for us to respond.
Although students of color are rightly
the leaders on issues of racism, white
students have a role to play in these
efforts. We need to take responsibility
for ourselves and our peers, and to
force the administration to do the
same. It's not enough to be silently
sympathetic anymore.
We have a role to play and we can
make a difference. When people attack
the BSU or students of color for "over
reacting," take a stand. Tell them that
students of color are the experts on
campus racism and that you consider

these organizations assets to the Stan
ford community.
When professors ignore or denegrate
calls for more inclusive curriculum,
demand that they teach us the his
tories of people of color and working
people.
We should respect the autonomy of
student of color groups. Students of
color have the right to organize their
communities to determine for them
selves what issues are important to
them and what struggles they will
wage.
Take a stand with students of color.
Rally against racism with the Students
of Color Coalition Wednesday at noon
in White Plaza.

ism. Come to the new ASSU Commit
tee on Democracy in Education, Tues
days at 6 p.m. at the ASSU.
