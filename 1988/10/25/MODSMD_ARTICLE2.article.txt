# Committee proposes to revamp non-Western requirement
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Calling for the non-Western culture re
quirement to be "strengthened" and given
"definition," a faculty subcommittee is
investigating measures necessary to im
prove the requirement.
The report of the Subcomittee on Dis
tribution Requirements should be com
pleted by the end of fall quarter or the
beginning of winter quarter, according to
History Prof. Peter Duus, chair of the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies.
While the subcommittee has not made
any specific recommendations, it is cur
rently exploring a number of possible op
tions, including a non-Western culture
sequence equivalent to Cultures, Ideas
and Values, a non-Western language re
quirement and a two-quarter in-depth se
quence, said VTSS Prof. Barry Katz.

Katz said there is a "strong sentiment"
among the committee members that the
non-Western culture requirement should
be taken "more seriously." He said the
attempts by the University to strengthen
the requirement will be "breaking new
ground" among national universities.
History Prof. Mark Mancall, chair of
the Subcommittee on Distribution Re
quirements, declined to comment last
night.
Duus said it is premature to predict
whether there will be a change in the
requirement. Heller, however, said a
change would be "inevitable."
"Once you start examining [the re
quirement!, it will inevitably change," he
said.
CUS, which oversees the subcommit
tee, will then review the report and sub
mit it to the Faculty Senate, according
to Duus.

Once you start examining [the requirement], it
will inevitably change.'

Once the subcommittee submits its rec
ommendations, the debate in the Faculty
Senate will be "lively," said Charles
Junkerman, assistant to the dean for Un
dergraduate Studies.
He called the change a significant "ad
dendum to restructuring Western Cul
ture. You know what the discussion was
like last year."
After examining the requirements of
other universities, the subcommittee is
at the stage of "getting real practical,"
said Junkerman.

According to Junkerman, questions
came up as to the amount of resources
and faculty that would have to be allo
cated to teach new non-Western culture
courses. Despite these considerations, the
subcommittee "didn't want to be
hamstrung by resource questions,"
Junkerman said.
Another important consideration was
whether students would be able to handle
a more rigorous non-Western culture re
quirement, according to Junkerman.
He cited one statistic in which only 60

percent of the students who take the
"World Outside the West" course, con
tinue with the three-quarter sequence.
Junkerman said this fact illustrated the
need for the University to "structure the
requirement in a way that students will
follow through on it."
Junkerman said cultural diversity is
an important part of the "social, political
and educational context" in which stu
dents live, and that the University should
"graduate students with that kind of
familiarity."
Biology Prof. Craig Heller, former CUS
chair, said the study was "inevitably tied
up with Area One," the three-quarter
Cultures, Ideas and Values required se
quence. The resolution of the CIV issue,
said Heller, led to the current investiga
tion of the non-Western culture require
ment.
