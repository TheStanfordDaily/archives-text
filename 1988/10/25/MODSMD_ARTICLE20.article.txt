## Damage control time 
### 
"The marvelous new militancy which has
engulfed the Negro community must not
lead us to a distrust of all white people,
for many of our white brothers . . . have
come to realize that their destiny is tied
up with our destiny and their freedom is
inextricably bound to our freedom
— Martin Luther King, Jr.
The damage has been done. Due to the
racist actions of two (or more?) individ
uals, the Stanford black community feels
betrayed, hurt and angry — and justly
so. Other minorities and non-minorities
echo the same sentiments. The question,
then, is how to isolate, control and take
steps to repair the damage.
Blaming Stanford and Stanford offi
cials for causing and encouraging racial
acts on campus would not only be unfair,
but it would be wrong. Many people over
look the point that Gus Heldt and Ben
Dugan were at Stanford for only four
weeks. It is unrealistic to expect that in
a matter of four weeks, Stanford Uni
versity would be able to change an ig
norant individual into an educated
individual.
The attitudes of Heldt and Dugan were
formed long before they came to Stan
ford. Stanford's role in the formation of
their beliefs was trivial compared to the
roles their environment, their friends and
their high school played.
Similarly, blaming white people in gen
eral for causing and proliferating all ra
cial incidents would be unfair and wrong.
Ashley Ryan, in a Daily column (Thurs
day, Oct. 20) remarked, "I, being born
white must live with the knowledge that

I am the reason why blacks face
prejudices, inequality and a constant need
to justify their existence. I can never be
the martyr; I will always be the ex
ecutioner."
Although I sympathize with her anger
and frustration, I feel it is unfair to imply
that the cause of prejudice and inequality
is due to the mere existence of white
people. I fail to see any connection be
tween white people who actively combat
racism and white people such as Heldt
and Dugan. I fail to see any connection
between the attitudes of my non-racist
white friends and the attitudes of Heldt
and Dugan.
Why should non-racist white individ
uals be slandered, implicated and wrongly
grouped with those responsible every
time a racial incident erupts? In these
instances, who becomes the martyr and
who the executioner?
By a similar line of argument, Tara
Holeman, in a letter to the Daily (Friday,
Oct. 21) wrote, "I call into account every
member of the University system. The
Ujamaa incident implicates all of us be
cause we are the system." Again, I sym
pathize with her anger and frustration.
Again, I resent the implication that my
white friends, and in this case, the entire
Stanford community are somehow
gravely at fault because of the actions of
two freshmen.
I am not saying we should put off the
Ujamaa incident as just an isolated racial
act — to do so would be blinding ourselves
to reality. I am saying, however, that
implicating every member of the white
community every time a racial incident

occurs will only serve to perpetuate the
"us vs. them" mentality, to polarize and
alienate all parties involved, and to instill
resentment and defensiveness within
those who were not responsible. Racism
is best attacked not through discord, but
through unity.
Up to now I have criticized certain
avenues of response to the Ujamaa inci
dent, but provided no solutions. To be
realistic, I believe Stanford University,
as an institution, cannot eradicate racism
from its campus. There simply does not
exist some cure-all policy for destroying
racism. But that doesn't mean we are
powerless.
The response of concerned individuals
to the Ujamaa incident should not be
viewed as "hysterical," (Jeff Raines, Dai
ly, Friday Oct. 21) but rather as admi
rable. Their commendable response send 6
out a clear, strong message that "drunken
rednecks" are not to be tolerated at Stan
ford. By viewing the reaction of the Stan
ford community in a positive light, by
placing blame in the appropriate places,
by working through unity and by relying
upon the power of the educated individ
ual, the damage will not only be con
trolled, it will be repaired.

eral for causing and proliferating all ra
cial incidents would be unfair and wrong.
Ashley Ryan, in a Daily column (Thurs
day, Oct. 20) remarked, "I, being born
white must live with the knowledge that

I am the reason why blacks face
prejudices, inequality and a constant need
to justify their existence. I can never be
the martyr; I will always be the ex
ecutioner."
Although I sympathize with her anger
and frustration, I feel it is unfair to imply
that the cause of prejudice and inequality
is due to the mere existence of white
people. I fail to see any connection be
tween white people who actively combat
racism and white people such as Heldt
and Dugan. I fail to see any connection
between the attitudes of my non-racist
white friends and the attitudes of Heldt
and Dugan.
Why should non-racist white individ
uals be slandered, implicated and wrongly
grouped with those responsible every
time a racial incident erupts? In these
instances, who becomes the martyr and
who the executioner?
By a similar line of argument, Tara
Holeman, in a letter to the Daily (Friday,
Oct. 21) wrote, "I call into account every
member of the University system. The
Ujamaa incident implicates all of us be
cause we are the system." Again, I sym
pathize with her anger and frustration.
Again, I resent the implication that my
white friends, and in this case, the entire
Stanford community are somehow
gravely at fault because of the actions of
two freshmen.
I am not saying we should put off the
Ujamaa incident as just an isolated racial
act — to do so would be blinding ourselves
to reality. I am saying, however, that
implicating every member of the white
community every time a racial incident

occurs will only serve to perpetuate the
"us vs. them" mentality, to polarize and
alienate all parties involved, and to instill
resentment and defensiveness within
those who were not responsible. Racism
is best attacked not through discord, but
through unity.
Up to now I have criticized certain
avenues of response to the Ujamaa inci
dent, but provided no solutions. To be
realistic, I believe Stanford University,
as an institution, cannot eradicate racism
from its campus. There simply does not
exist some cure-all policy for destroying
racism. But that doesn't mean we are
powerless.
The response of concerned individuals
to the Ujamaa incident should not be
viewed as "hysterical," (Jeff Raines, Dai
ly, Friday Oct. 21) but rather as admi
rable. Their commendable response send 6
out a clear, strong message that "drunken
rednecks" are not to be tolerated at Stan
ford. By viewing the reaction of the Stan
ford community in a positive light, by
placing blame in the appropriate places,
by working through unity and by relying
upon the power of the educated individ
ual, the damage will not only be con
trolled, it will be repaired.
