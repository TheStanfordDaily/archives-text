Sneak Preview: Universal
Pictures presents a Lucasfilm
production of a Cecil B. DeMille
film; starring Charlton Heston
and Charo; trailblazing un
charted realms of disgust; a
film of our time, a film of all
time ... The Stench.
Once upon a time, a nifty,
nutty, happy-go-lucky kind o'
place called Stanford reigned

supreme among the tens of
thousands of colleges populat
ing the 50 states. Now it's not
even in the top five. Why? Let's
start from the beginning.
Years ago, every day was a
joy to live, every evening thou
sands of night-shirted students
would thank the Lord for
having given them so many
reasons to smile. And to smile
with a smile that was tartar
free.
There was a universal feeling
that Stanford was a latter-day
Eden, chock-full of bountiful
hearts and sharp minds; over
flowing with health, wealth
and whimsy.
However, the Big Guy one
day said to Himself, "Himself,
these people are too happy. No
matter how much vengeance I
wreak upon the wretched sin

ners of the Earth, typical Stan
fordians remain oblivious, con
centrating only on their own
image as they sees it through
Cardinal-colored glasses."
So Mr. Omnipotent decided
it was time to work his special
kind of gentle chiding on these
Narcissistic Farmers. At first,
his impact was subtle, but the
drastically unfortunate events
which have plagued this
campus have been fruitful and
multiplied over the past couple
years.
First, there was the screen
ing of "Cocoon" as a Flick, a
sign of imminent Armageddon
to any decent American. Next,
the Red Sox lost to the Mets.
Then, a series of events
dooming the University fur
ther: Delta Upsilon was
obliterated; Brad Muster got
injured; Debi Thomas slipped
up at the Olympics.
Yes, the Bearded One was
responsible, and even after des
tining a Cardinal student to
win the Miss America Pageant
(a suitably crowning blow) He
still isn't finished.
The coup de grace, the one
which He has personally told
me He expects will reform the
evil pride ruining our Cardinal
youth, was his empowerment
of the Stanford storm drain
system with that stinkin',
diabolically nauseatin', just
plain gross odor which now,
silently, invisibly, seeps out of
White Plaza vents.
It wanders its apocalyptic
way around the center of what
was once the haven of good
smellin' people but is now the
domain of ... The Stench.
What have the ramifications
been? For one, the Bug's mail
room has been flooded with
more letters concerning The
Stench than his four arms can
handle. For another, Parents'
Weekend was dyed black with
death when three unprepared
visitors dropped stone dead
after a single whiff.
Could it be worse? According
to some, yes. The ultimate fear
among the campus intel
