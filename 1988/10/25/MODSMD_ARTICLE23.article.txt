## The 						Bug delves deep into The Stench below 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
Sneak Preview: Universal
Pictures presents a Lucasfilm
production of a Cecil B. DeMille
film; starring Charlton Heston
and Charo; trailblazing un
charted realms of disgust; a
film of our time, a film of all
time ... The Stench.
Once upon a time, a nifty,
nutty, happy-go-lucky kind o'
place called Stanford reigned

supreme among the tens of
thousands of colleges populat
ing the 50 states. Now it's not
even in the top five. Why? Let's
start from the beginning.
Years ago, every day was a
joy to live, every evening thou
sands of night-shirted students
would thank the Lord for
having given them so many
reasons to smile. And to smile
with a smile that was tartar
free.
There was a universal feeling
that Stanford was a latter-day
Eden, chock-full of bountiful
hearts and sharp minds; over
flowing with health, wealth
and whimsy.
However, the Big Guy one
day said to Himself, "Himself,
these people are too happy. No
matter how much vengeance I
wreak upon the wretched sin

ners of the Earth, typical Stan
fordians remain oblivious, con
centrating only on their own
image as they sees it through
Cardinal-colored glasses."
So Mr. Omnipotent decided
it was time to work his special
kind of gentle chiding on these
Narcissistic Farmers. At first,
his impact was subtle, but the
drastically unfortunate events
which have plagued this
campus have been fruitful and
multiplied over the past couple
years.
First, there was the screen
ing of "Cocoon" as a Flick, a
sign of imminent Armageddon
to any decent American. Next,
the Red Sox lost to the Mets.
Then, a series of events
dooming the University fur
ther: Delta Upsilon was
obliterated; Brad Muster got
injured; Debi Thomas slipped
up at the Olympics.
Yes, the Bearded One was
responsible, and even after des
tining a Cardinal student to
win the Miss America Pageant
(a suitably crowning blow) He
still isn't finished.
The coup de grace, the one
which He has personally told
me He expects will reform the
evil pride ruining our Cardinal
youth, was his empowerment
of the Stanford storm drain
system with that stinkin',
diabolically nauseatin', just
plain gross odor which now,
silently, invisibly, seeps out of
White Plaza vents.
It wanders its apocalyptic
way around the center of what
was once the haven of good
smellin' people but is now the
domain of ... The Stench.
What have the ramifications
been? For one, the Bug's mail
room has been flooded with
more letters concerning The
Stench than his four arms can
handle. For another, Parents'
Weekend was dyed black with
death when three unprepared
visitors dropped stone dead
after a single whiff.
Could it be worse? According
to some, yes. The ultimate fear
among the campus intel

legentsia is that the He will fur
ther his punishment by command
ing that Bobby MacFerrin appear
on campus and sing that asinine
"Be Happy" song.
Dear Bug,
What's that smell?
— Emperor Hirohito
Funny you should write all the
way from Japan with that ques
tion. But, you know what they
say about the long arm of the
lewd.
After nosing around a little, the

Bug has gotten to the essence of
the matter. That is, after a
roamin' the Operations and Main
tenance office for a bit, he can
tell the public what they have a
right to know.
Actually, in response to last
week's column and a letter printed
in The Daily's Opinions section
the week before, Leslie Quintero,
acting director of Operations and
Maintenance, immediately drafted
a letter in response.
Asking "Please, don't break out
your gas mask yet," Quintero said
steps have already been taken to
rid the Plaza of its empyreumatic
rankness. She said water crews
are flushing out the sewers and

soon will have this problem licked
— which is fine as long as it's
not my tongue.
Now, if all you semi-literate (as
in people who don't use trash
cans, don't just drop it on the
ground, but instead drop trash
and garbage down sewer grates,
or into a mailbox) would be sen
sible enough to put your refuse
in sanitary sewers instead of
storm drains, there would be no
problem.
Storm drains, and the vents
leading to them, serve to carry
off excess rainwater but are not
designed to handle yucky
foodstuffs or dead rats.

Quintero said maintenance has
located major sources of the food
which found its way into the
storm drain, and the department
is now "working with the parties
involved." This kind of phrasing
reeks of Mafia ties, which inciden
tally are usually too wide.
Sure, you Stanford students are
the best and the brightest.
But remember, others suffer
while we pick at stuff that has
gathered in between our toes.
Lose your pride, wash your hands,
throw away your "Don't Worry,
Be Happy" record, and soon The
Stench will be no more.
Until next week, the Bug has
spoken.
