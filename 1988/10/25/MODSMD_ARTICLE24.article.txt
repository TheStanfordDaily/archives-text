# West African bard blends history and song

"There is something very funny
in the U. 5... . a white man looking
at a black American like (he) is
nothing, and a black American
looking at an African like (he) is
nothing....
"They are all from us; they are
part of us .... They don't know
their descent and their origins.
Who are they? That is part of the
reason I do this," says Papa
Bunka Susso who brought an age
old Gambian tradition into Bran
ner dining hall Friday night.
Susso is a griot (greeyo): an
oral historian, a singer of praise
and a traditional musician from
Gambia in West Africa. It was
through the knowledge of a griot
that Alex Hailey, the author of
"Roots," initially discovered the
track of the Kunta Kinte story he

griot was founded
by Mohammed's
praise singer.

followed to uncover his family's
origins.
As he demonstrated to the over
flowing crowd in Branner, Papa
Susso spins tales of great leaders,
wars and love, mixed with history,
blended with the entrancing
sounds of his Mandekan language.
His chant-like singing accom
panies the rhythmic chords of his
rare, ancient instrument, the kora.
The kora is a shoulder-height, 21-
stringed instrument made of wood
and cowhide. Susso holds it ex
tending out from his body, strum
ming as he sings.
Invented by his ancestors, the
kora's songs and techniques have
been passed down from father to
son since the 13th century.
Susso says his numbers are
"not just songs," however. They
commemorate very important,
even legendary, people. In fact,
the role of the griot was founded
by Mohammed's praise-singer.
Susso said since no one can
credibly sing one's own praise, the
griot does this for those who
deserve it, or those in power.
In between songs, Susso drew
questions from the audience, ex

plaining Gambian traditions,
nuances of his language and per
sonal history.
Susso began learning to play
the kora when he was five years
old. Later, against his mother's
wishes, his father sent him to
school. Susso says she feared that
by sending "a child to the white
man's school, he might not follow
traditions." Until her son grew
tired of the "white man's" life
style, she was right.
Susso excelled in school, and
won a scholarship to Cuttington
College in Liberia.
After earning his B.A in busi
ness administration, Susso
worked as a senior accountant for
the Minister of Works and Com
munication in Gambia. Seven
years later, Susso threw in the
towel. He said he grew tired of
the work and the erratic govern
ment paycheck. Susso opted for
the lifestyle of the traditional
musician, as his father had.
Customarily, griots played with
out contract or wage, asking for
money from their audience after
the performance. Susso consid
ered this "begging," and decided
to depart from that aspect of the
tradition.
Thus, he found employment at
the Atlantic Hotel in Gambia, en
tertaining with a time-honored art
for a modern-day salary. He was
the first griot to charge fees and
arrange formal bookings. Now
after his example, Susso says all
traditional Gambian performers
charge in advance.
He noted laughingly, "And can
you believe that from one small
instrument I now have two
houses?"
Susso's two houses are home to
his parents, two wives and seven
children. They live in Gambia's
capital, Banjul, located 244 miles
from Sotima-Sere, his boyhood
home.
Susso tries to bridge both the
traditional and contemporary pil
lars of his life in raising his
children. He sends them to school
and teaches them the traditions
at home. Like his father, Susso's
philosophy is "When they grow
up, it's up to them to decide"
which lifestyle they will adopt.
Not long after Susso entered
the entertainment business as an
independent performer, his musi
cal talent and good business sense
attracted the attention of the
Gambian Cultural Troupe, a

government-run arts council.
They asked him to join the
group, saying he would expand
their scope and "open their eyes"
to cultivate more traditional
artforms. Susso accepted, once
again on the government's
monthly payroll. A year later he
resigned and started his own
troupe.
Susso is now the director of the
"Manding Music and Dance Com
pany, Ltd." The troupe consists
of 20 people: three kora players,
one wooden xylophone player and
several drummers, singers and
dancers.
Traveling extensively through
East, West and Central Africa, as
well as Europe, Susso has played

for several heads-of-state, includ
ing the presidents of Gambia,
Liberia, Zaire and Mali.
He first glimpsed the United
States in 1985, when he accom
panied the Gambian Minister of
Information and Tourism to New
York for two days. The minister
addressed the United Nations,
Papa Susso performed and met
Americans. He "was impressed"
and decided to make plans to
return to the United States.
Last year, Susso toured the
United States for 10 months, as
he will again this year. Besides
the performance at Branner and

a Friday afternoon session at
Menlo Oak School, Susso has also
held concerts at the American
Museum of Natural History in
New York and at many other col
lege campuses.
He plans to perform at U.C.-
Berkley and University of Califor
nia at Los Angeles in the
upcoming months.
Susso's first impression of the
Stanford area was, "It's wonder
ful; it's beautiful. I like it. Num
ber one is the weather, and then
the environment ..."
Papa Susso was brought to
Stanford by the Afro-American
Studies department. In apprecia
tion of Prof. Kennell Jackson's
efforts to bring Susso to campus,
Susso played a song Friday dedi
cated to Jackson, the depart
ment's chair and resident fellow
of Branner.
Susso sings in Mandekan, but
he speaks six other languages:
Wolof, Fula, Sarahule, Jola, Eng
lish and French.
Papa Bunka Susso's perform
ance was taped by XTV and will
be aired tonight at 6:30 p.m. for
those who missed the Friday con
cert.
