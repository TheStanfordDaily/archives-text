## Card prepares for dogfight 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
"Don't ask me what it feels like to
tie a game 20-20; I haven't figured it
out yet."
So said Stanford Coach Jack Elway
at yesterday's football press conference.
The Cardinal, which travels to Seattle
to play the Washington Huskies this
Saturday, is still trying to recover from
a 20-20 tie with Oregon State.
"It's going to take me a couple of
days to get over this," inside linebacker
Jono Tunney said after the game Sat
urday, "but then I think I'll be looking
forward to Washington."
The 3-3-1 Cardinal watched its bowl
games hopes almost completely disap
pear with Oregon State's game-tying
field goal with only five seconds remain*
ing. The Cardinal now must face 4
Washington program that has been to
nine consecutive bowl games under
Coach Don James.
The Huskies have not met with too
much success this season, however.
Washington is an uncharacteristic 4-3
overall and 1-3 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference. The team is currently in eighth
place in the league; the last time Wash
ington finished that low was 1973.
Before the Cardinal gets too optimis
tic, though, one must realize that the
Huskies have taken five straight from
the Cardinal, and Washington's three
losses have come to No. 1 UCLA (24-17),
No. 3 USC (28-27) and No. 20 Oregon
(17-14).
Those teams are a combined 19-1 on
the season, with the lone loss being the

Trojans' defeat of the Ducks. But Stan
ford fared well against USC and Oregon
as well, indicating this may be the year
Stanford gets Washington's number.
"I think we've narrowed the talent
gap [between Stanford and Was
hington]," Elway said. "I think talent
wise we're probably close to them."
James also feels his Huskies are not
nearly as untouchable as they have been
in the past. "Coming into the season
we wanted to be more competitive," he
said, "and we got our wish. Now I wish
we just won more games."
Washington's woes are due in part (a
big part) to a very competitive Pac-10.

'I think we're going to
have a chip on our shoul
der, come out pissed-off
and give Washington a
good game.'

"When I was growing up during the
Pac-8 it used to be USC and the seven
dwarves," Elway said. "[Now] nobody's
taking anything for granted. ...
"I would say, based on my experience,
number one: it's the best conference in
the country; number two: it's the most
balanced conference in the country; and,
number three: it's the most balanced
it's ever been."
Washington, like Stanford, has lost

three heartbreakers, falling to UCLA
on a touchdown with one minute, 28
seconds remaining, missing a two-point
conversion that would have beaten USC
with 1:39 showing on the clock, and,
last week, allowing the game-winning
touchdown with 1:39 left at Oregon.
Stanford led both USC and Oregon
in the fourth quarter before losing, in
addition to the tie Saturday, which did
not sit well with at least one Stanford
player. "As far as I'm concerned it's a
loss," according to Tunney, who expects
the Cardinal to "just come back hard
and play next week and see what we
can do."
"Well, I think we're going to have a
chip on our shoulder," fullback Jon
Volpe said Saturday, "come out pissed
off and give Washington a good game."
Stanford is expected to be in good
health for the game, at least. Volpe and
offensive tackle John Zentner have sore
necks but Elway said, "Other than that,
injury-wise I feel we're in good shape."
Defensive tackle Lester Archambeau,
who has almost made twisting his right
knee a weekly habit, is expected to be
at full strength Saturday. "They say
he's fine," Elway said. "It isn't anything
that shows any looseness in the joint."
Card notes
James currently has 69 career victories in
Pac-8/Pac-10 games, one short of John
McKay's record of 70, set at USC. This is
the third consecutive week James is looking
for that elusive 70th victory. UCLA Coach
Terry Donahue is closing fast as he has 68
Pac-8/Pac-10 wins going into this week's
game with Washington State.
