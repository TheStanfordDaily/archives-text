# Volleyball hosts San Jose State
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Yet again, San Jose State and
Stanford meet with a streak and
a record on the line. Riding a
13-match win streak and on the
brink of tying the team record for
consecutive victories, the No. 2
Cardinal women's volleyball team
hosts South Bay rival SJSU
tonight at 7:30 in Maples Pavilion.
Stanford is currently 18-1 in
overall play and solely in second
in the Pacific 10 Conference. The
No. 15 Spartans are also second
in their league, the newly-created
Big West Conference (which
replaced the Pacific Coast Athletic

Association at the start of the
season), and hold a 19-4 overall
mark.
San Jose State is also a team
with a chip on its shoulder. When
the Cardinal journeyed down to
Spartan Gym in late September,
SJSU had opened the season with
a clean 11-0 slate and was on the
verge of establishing a new school
standard for straight wins. Stan
ford waylaid the Spartan's plans
with a 15-8, 15-8, 17-15 sweep,
and SJSU would undoubtedly like
to return the favor tonight in
Maples.
Standing in their way is a tough
Stanford squad that has pulled
out some big back-to-the-wall tri

umphs. Staving off a late
onslaught by Arizona and the
even attack of Arizona State this
past weekend, the team is ready
for a solid and consistent match.
"We know we can play well, and
if we do we'll just cream them,"
Cardinal middle blocker Amy
Cooper said. "But sometimes we
can go in there and feel like we're
ready but take a while to get
started. I think we'll be fine —
we don't want to go through what
we had to go through last weekend
again."
The Spartans faced similar ad
versity over the course of last
week, when they played four quick
games against solid squads. High

lighted by a come-from-behind
win over No. 10 San Diego State,
SJSU is making a habit of upset
ting good teams.
The secret to their success has
rested in the middle. Starters Kim
Hicks and Kari Roberson, though
unable to handle Stanford, have
kept most of the Spartans' other
opponents under control and are
each hitting around .300.
Setter Susie Laymon and out
side hitters Laura Boone and
Dawnis Wilson have also bolstered
the SJSU squad and given oppo
nents a good deal of grief.
"I know they've improved since
the last time we played them, because they've beaten
some good teams," Stanford Coach Don Shaw said.
"They hadn't beaten any good teams when we last
played them, so I'm looking for a tougher match.
The second round is always tougher than the first
round — that was proven last weekend."
One meyor difference between San Jose and the
Cardinal's conference foes last weekend is offensive
firepower. Apart from the hard-hitting Hicks, the
Spartans lack explosive hitters capable of decimating
a block as strong as Stanford's. SJSU was unable
to dominate the last time the teams met, when the
Cardinal was unfamiliar with their tendencies, and
tonight's match should only be tougher.
"We'll definitely be better prepared for them,"
Cooper said. "We know what to expect from playing
them last time and we've improved, so I think we'll
do better against them this time."
Defense is where the Spartans are going to hope
for the advantage. A small and scrappy team, SJSU
will look to upset the smooth operation of the Stan
ford offense to prevent the Cardinal hitters from
running away with the match.
"They're going to be really tough defensively —
they're going to dig a lot of balls," Shaw said.
"They're going to serve tough, and I think our
ability to control and pass the ball is going to be
a factor."
Consistently excellent for the Cardinal is Kristin
Klein, who is rapidly grabbing a stranglehold on
this year's national Freshman of the Year honors.
Earning 21 kills against Arizona and 17 against
ASU, Klein remains Stanford's most deadly hitter
as well as a force in the backcourt.
Classmate Cooper has also been effective, becom
ing a crowd favorite in the mold of former Stanford
player and 1988 U.S. Olympic Team captain Kim
Oden. "Coop" currently leads the team in blocks,
and continues to add new plays to her ever
improving offensive repertoire.
But some of the biggest surprises of the season
have come from middle blocker-turned-outside hit
ter Jennifer Chaffee, who came alive in the last
Stanford-Spartan meeting.


Ken Beer — Dally
Freshman Amy Cooper, who leads the volleyball team In blocks, has made her presence felt at the net this season
and even finds time to dig the occasional spike.
