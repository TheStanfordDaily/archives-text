# Soccer takes on Div. II Cossacks
## 
### John Kirks Staff' writer 
The Stanford women's soccer team has been on
a bit of an emotional rollercoaster of late. On Thurs
day, tlje team suffered a loss, in heartbreaking
fashion,, to Division II power Cal State-Hayward.
Saturdity, the team bounced back with a strong
showing- against California in the women's soccer
ver9iorf Of Big Game, coming away with a hard
fought .1-1 tie. Sunday, the team limped out of the
gate against the U.S. International University and
had to tely on late-game heroics by midfielder Jen
Bloomet to emerge victorious, 1-0.
Today/the team makes the northward trek to
Sonomii State University to take on the Lady Cos
sacks ipi a match that gets underway at 3:00 p.m.
Stanford is playing its fourth game in six days and
is attempting to cling to its Gatorade National Col
lege Soccer Ranking Top Twenty position. Stanford's
loss to Hayward jeopardized its status in that poll,
but the Cardinal's impressive tie versus Cal and
the victory on Sunday over the USIU should reserve
the team's place among the nation's elite.

The Cardinal's impressive tie
versus Cal and the victory on
Sunday over USIU should reserve
the team's place among the na
tion's elite.

Sonoma State is yet another strong representative
of the NCAA's Division 11. Stanford has recently
learned some respect for the supposedly weaker
Hayward, the division's No. 2-ranked team,
defeated Stanford on the Cardinal's home turf by
a 2-1 titargin.
Stanford could ill afford any more losses. The
Cardincd is entering the home stretch of its season,
and itf position in the NCAA tourney is anything
but secure. In fact, Stanford probably must strongly
and convincingly sweep through its final three op
ponents. if they expect to appear in postseason play.
The Cardinal's season record stands at 10-4-2, and
the NCAA Selection Committee would probably not
look fajretably on anymore tallies in the "L" column.
Stanford has been getting some strong, not to
mentioh clutch, individual contributions lately from
a couple of players. Jennifer Rowland, no doubt
necessity of a late-season charge, has
really ttirned on the offensive afterburners in the
last five-games, scoring three goals.

Edwards has continued her stellar play in
the Cardinal goal. In the last nine games, she has
allowed only four goals. Most recently, she played
an instfimental role in preserving Stanford's tie
against California, recording 18 saves compared to
the Cal goalkeeper's total of four.
