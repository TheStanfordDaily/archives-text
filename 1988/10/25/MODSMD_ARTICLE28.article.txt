# Is Prop. 48 fair?
## 
### 
The NCAA has this thing
called Proposition 48.
Nobody knows what the first
47 propositions passed by the
NCAA are. That's okay, be
cause from its inception, Prop.
48 has been about 48 times as
controversial as any other
guideline the NCAA has.

Prop. 48 grabs everyone's at
tention because it questions the
foundation of college sports —
what is a student-athlete? Un
fortunately, it raises more
questions than it answers.
Very simply stated, Prop. 48
requires a scholarship athlete
to score a minimum of 700
total on the Scholastic Aptitude
Test and to have a 2.0 grade
point average during high
school in certain core classes.
Without either of these, the
student loses a year of
eligibility.
A significant number of
people think these require
ments, on their own merits, are
unfair. Hearing this, I just say,
"You've got to be kidding me."
I understand that schools dif
fer in quality — that a student
with a 1.9 average at one school
may be infinitely more quali
fied than a student with a 2.0
average at another school.
I understand that the SAT
is probably culturally biased —
that someone who grew up in
the same culture as the test
writers has a natural advantage
over someone who didn't.
As an aside (although it cer
tainly merits more attention
than that), in the first two
years of Prop. 48, 124 men's
basketball players were admit
ted to Division I schools, only
to be forced to the sidelines by
the 700 barrier. Just seven
were white.
But come on. A 700? You'll
recall you get 400 on the SAT
just for signing your name: 200
for math, 200 for verbal. That
means you need an average of
just 150 more points on each
section to qualify.
Now I may not be qualified
to speak on education, but I
don't care if George Will wrote
the SAT, there are questions
on that test that any students
who are going to have their
names etched permanently on
high school diplomas and cer
tainly those who are going on
to four-year colleges, should be
able to answer.
As for the grades — remem
ber, these are core courses.
Students don't have to ace AP
Physics. If students have below
a C average and want to go to
college — for whatever reason

— they should be getting some
help. If they can't get it in high
school, they should be getting
it their first year in college.
To me, Prop 48 in itself is
fair to everybody. Fairer to
some than others probably, but
at a minimum fair to all.
At the same time, the fallout
from Prop. 48 does create more
problems than it solves.
First of all, say a student
meets the minimum academic
requirements. Does that mean
the student should automati
cally get to play sports?
A 700 SAT score may say a
lot about a student's ability to
answer the all-important ques
tion, "What is x when 2x = 4?"
but it tells us nothing about
that minor query, "Am I ma
ture enough to handle the col
legiate sport spotlight?"
My guess is that, at a min
imum (you hear that word min
imum a lot when you talk Prop.
48 talk), most students could
benefit from a first year with
out competition, even those
who don't necessarily need it.
So even though I take the
view that a loss of a year's
eligibility is not too harsh for
a student who can't meet the
Prop. 48 requirements, I think
ending freshman eligibility, or
having every freshman red
shirt, complements Prop. 48
well.

A significant num
ber of people think
these requirements,
on their own merits,
are unfair. Hearing
this, t just say,
'You've got to be kid
ding me.'

But even this seems to open
up more problems than it
solves. Why treat athletics dif
ferently from other extracur
ricular activities?
If you take frosh eligibility
away from athletes, that means
a student gets to perform on
the drama stage for all four
years, but on the basketball
stage for only three.
If you have every freshman
athlete redshirt, that means
their scholarships are extended
to five years — and that comes
off as equal but opposite un
fairness.
These problems already ex
ist, but would be exacerbated
by changing the rules regarding
freshmen.
So, what can be done to solve
these problems instead of
making them ugly?
Definitely, one must accept
the fact that a student-athlete
playing a major revenue*
generating sport is flat-out dif
ferent from a student-actor or


JON WEISMAN
student-musician, and that the
groups should not be Jumped to
gether.
Their lives are different. Actors
are not written about in the Sport
ing Green daily. There is no wide
spread threat of bribes to get a
musician to come to a school.
Poets do not generate $55 million,
the profit for the NCAA from its
postseason men's basketball tour
nament alone last year.
Is this true at Stanford, the
Utopia of the student-athlete? I
think so. Sure, we turned down
Chris Munk, but just as the
student-athletes here are theoreti
cally more capable of handling
academic pressures, so is the bur
den placed upon them greater.
Having accepted this, I think
it's clear that extra, specific meas
ures should be taken on the behalf
of mtyor student athletes.
These include keeping Prop. 48,
which retains its value as, well,
the minimum.
These also might include, how
ever, a stipend for these athletes
and unique scholarship packages,
and yes, even drug testing.
If colleges are the professional
leagues' farm systems, let's admit
it. If colleges are for getting ed
ucated, let's enforce it.
If it's a combination of both,
let's get down to work and modify
the system. Let's write 48 more
propositions.

ever, a stipend for these athletes
and unique scholarship packages,
and yes, even drug testing.
If colleges are the professional
leagues' farm systems, let's admit
it. If colleges are for getting ed
ucated, let's enforce it.
If it's a combination of both,
let's get down to work and modify
the system. Let's write 48 more
propositions.

Jon Weisman is the Daily's
men's basketball writer.
The NCAA has this thing
called Proposition 48.
Nobody knows what the first
47 propositions passed by the
NCAA are. That's okay, be
cause from its inception, Prop.
48 has been about 48 times as
controversial as any other
guideline the NCAA has.

Prop. 48 grabs everyone's at
tention because it questions the
foundation of college sports —
what is a student-athlete? Un
fortunately, it raises more
questions than it answers.
Very simply stated, Prop. 48
requires a scholarship athlete
to score a minimum of 700
total on the Scholastic Aptitude
Test and to have a 2.0 grade
point average during high
school in certain core classes.
Without either of these, the
student loses a year of
eligibility.
A significant number of
people think these require
ments, on their own merits, are
unfair. Hearing this, I just say,
"You've got to be kidding me."
I understand that schools dif
fer in quality — that a student
with a 1.9 average at one school
may be infinitely more quali
fied than a student with a 2.0
average at another school.
I understand that the SAT
is probably culturally biased —
that someone who grew up in
the same culture as the test
writers has a natural advantage
over someone who didn't.
As an aside (although it cer
tainly merits more attention
than that), in the first two
years of Prop. 48, 124 men's
basketball players were admit
ted to Division I schools, only
to be forced to the sidelines by
the 700 barrier. Just seven
were white.
But come on. A 700? You'll
recall you get 400 on the SAT
just for signing your name: 200
for math, 200 for verbal. That
means you need an average of
just 150 more points on each
section to qualify.
Now I may not be qualified
to speak on education, but I
don't care if George Will wrote
the SAT, there are questions
on that test that any students
who are going to have their
names etched permanently on
high school diplomas and cer
tainly those who are going on
to four-year colleges, should be
able to answer.
As for the grades — remem
ber, these are core courses.
Students don't have to ace AP
Physics. If students have below
a C average and want to go to
college — for whatever reason

— they should be getting some
help. If they can't get it in high
school, they should be getting
it their first year in college.
To me, Prop 48 in itself is
fair to everybody. Fairer to
some than others probably, but
at a minimum fair to all.
At the same time, the fallout
from Prop. 48 does create more
problems than it solves.
First of all, say a student
meets the minimum academic
requirements. Does that mean
the student should automati
cally get to play sports?
A 700 SAT score may say a
lot about a student's ability to
answer the all-important ques
tion, "What is x when 2x = 4?"
but it tells us nothing about
that minor query, "Am I ma
ture enough to handle the col
legiate sport spotlight?"
My guess is that, at a min
imum (you hear that word min
imum a lot when you talk Prop.
48 talk), most students could
benefit from a first year with
out competition, even those
who don't necessarily need it.
So even though I take the
view that a loss of a year's
eligibility is not too harsh for
a student who can't meet the
Prop. 48 requirements, I think
ending freshman eligibility, or
having every freshman red
shirt, complements Prop. 48
well.

A significant num
ber of people think
these requirements,
on their own merits,
are unfair. Hearing
this, t just say,
'You've got to be kid
ding me.'

But even this seems to open
up more problems than it
solves. Why treat athletics dif
ferently from other extracur
ricular activities?
If you take frosh eligibility
away from athletes, that means
a student gets to perform on
the drama stage for all four
years, but on the basketball
stage for only three.
If you have every freshman
athlete redshirt, that means
their scholarships are extended
to five years — and that comes
off as equal but opposite un
fairness.
These problems already ex
ist, but would be exacerbated
by changing the rules regarding
freshmen.
So, what can be done to solve
these problems instead of
making them ugly?
Definitely, one must accept
the fact that a student-athlete
playing a major revenue*
generating sport is flat-out dif
ferent from a student-actor or


JON WEISMAN
student-musician, and that the
groups should not be Jumped to
gether.
Their lives are different. Actors
are not written about in the Sport
ing Green daily. There is no wide
spread threat of bribes to get a
musician to come to a school.
Poets do not generate $55 million,
the profit for the NCAA from its
postseason men's basketball tour
nament alone last year.
Is this true at Stanford, the
Utopia of the student-athlete? I
think so. Sure, we turned down
Chris Munk, but just as the
student-athletes here are theoreti
cally more capable of handling
academic pressures, so is the bur
den placed upon them greater.
Having accepted this, I think
it's clear that extra, specific meas
ures should be taken on the behalf
of mtyor student athletes.
These include keeping Prop. 48,
which retains its value as, well,
the minimum.
These also might include, how
ever, a stipend for these athletes
and unique scholarship packages,
and yes, even drug testing.
If colleges are the professional
leagues' farm systems, let's admit
it. If colleges are for getting ed
ucated, let's enforce it.
