# Jackson to stump for Dukakis Friday
## 
### Brad Hayward Staff writer 
With the presidential campaign reaching
its final stage, the Rev. Jesse Jackson will
make an appearance here on behalf of
Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis this
Friday afternoon.
Jackson will speak at 12:30 p.m., the
Stanford Democrats announced last night.
Organizers predicted that the speech will
be held in White Plaza, but plans will not
be finalized until today, pending a meeting
with University administrators.
"Jesse Jackson has been here twice in
the last two years, and every time he has
left an imprint on the hearts of the stu
dents," said Subodh Chandra, co-chair of
the Stanford Democrats.
Although Jackson is not running for of
fice himself, "He will swing a lot of votes

in the congressional races and get a lot of
people out to vote in the presidential race,"
Chandra predicted.
David Drummond, a member of the Stan
ford Democrats, said the campus organi
zation was contacted last Friday by the
Jackson campaign. "The Jackson people
said Jesse wanted to come here. It was his
idea. It's going to be an enormous help to
the campaign," Drummond said.
Organizers expect 3,000 to 5,000 people
to attend the speech.
According to Drummond, Jackson's
speech will be a "general stump speech for
Michael Dukakis."
But organizers are especially pleased that
Jackson will be appearing at a time when
race relations are tense at Stanford. "It's
good timing," Drummond said. "Jesse has


Jesse Jackson
been supportive of the efforts of
students of color on this campus
before. It's a timely visit and a
timely topic."
Chandra added that Jackson's
visit is significant "in light of a
climate throughout the country
and on this campus that seems
to be conducive to racism."
Organizers are also hoping that
12th Congressional District
Democratic candidate Anna Eshoo
will be on hand to participate in
Friday's event.
The Stanford Democrats are
counting on Jackson to inspire
confidence and excitement in stu
dents now that the Dukakis cam
paign is trailing in the polls.
"He brings political issues home
to people and becomes a motivat
ing factor in getting people in
volved in the campaign," said
Katherine Van Uum, co-chair of
the Stanford Democrats. "Rather
than having the campaign turn
to apathy, we want it to turn to
action. We want Jackson's appear
ance to do that for the student
body and for the campaign."
Jackson will fly into San Jose
Airport Friday morning and will
proceed to Stanford for the
speech.
