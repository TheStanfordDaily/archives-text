# Escondido Village may have excessive levels of asbestos

A recent air-sampling survey of Escon
dido Village disclosed that air asbestos-fiber
levels there possibly exceed the University
established maximum, according to Direc
tor of Health and Safety Alain Decleve.
Decleve stated, however, that the survey
is rough and does not differentiate between
asbestos fibers and other fibers. More elab
orate surveys using electron mircroscopes
are now being conducted.
Escondido Village is being monitored
closely by the University because it has
asbestos sprayed on the ceiling.
Escondido residents received a letter yes
terday informing them not to disturb
potentially-friable asbestos, but the letter
made no mention of the survey.
Decleve stated that hanging skis upon
an asbestos coated pipe, putting a hook
into a wall, throwing a frisbee or closing
a door, could disturb potentially friable, or
non-friable, asbestos.
Non-friable asbestos is not hazardous un
der normal living conditions, but
potentially-friable asbestos, when
disturbed, could release fibers into the air.
Asst. Provost of Planning and Manage
ment John Hughes said Escondido is also
unique among residential buildings because
"it is the only building with asbestos in

every room." Currently, Escondido houses
married students and students with
children.
The University has determined a maxi
mum air sample level of .01 fibers per
cubic centimeters, which is well below the
federal limit of .1 fibers per cubic centi
meter. According to Director of Facilities
Project Management Curt Williams, there
â€¢ are not any buildings with fiber levels
above the University maximum.
Most campus buildings built before 1976
contain some asbestos, but the majority is
in the non-friable form. According to
Decleve, "All of the most urgent asbestos

situations determined by the sur
vey [have been] addressed" as a
result of physical asbestos surveys
of residential housing buildings.
The only student residences
which have no asbestos are those
built after 1976, including Ster
ling Quad, the Moore houses on
the Row and a new graduate stu
dent housing complex Rains.
The University has conducting
an on-going air sampling for three
and a half years to test for high
levels of asbestos. Hughes ex
plained that the survey is a long
on-going process because "over 10
billion feet must be checked room
by room."
Decleve estimated that 50 per
cent of all University buildings
have now been surveyed.
The University finished survey
ing residential buildings last year
and moved on to surveying ad
ministrative buildings. Hughes
stated, "The field surveys done
this year have shown no immedi
ate areas of danger . . . such as
last year."
Last year, construction at La
gunita Hall uncovered potentially
dangerous asbestos that required
immediate cleanup. Asbestos may
be a health hazard when its fibers
are released into the air.

Hughes said that no other
buildings have been slated for full
scale removals. Manager of
Student Housing Operations
Suzanne Tamiesie said that in
residential buildings, asbestos sit
uations were being handled on a
case-by-case basis, and that a
$100,000 budget had been set for
abatement projects.
Hughes said current removal ef
forts are "mainly occurring in me
chanical areas where construction
work is being done, such as pipes
. . . and removal is also taking
place in areas where removal of
asbestos makes sense to be incor
porated with the project."
Tamiesie said that projects in
clude a recently finished abate
ment of two mechanical rooms in
Florence Moore, and abatement of
mechanical rooms in Lagunita
scheduled for the winter break.
Because of the Lagunita results,
physical asbestos surveys of all
residential housing were con
ducted throughout last fall and
winter in order to establish
priorities for the University as
bestos abatement project.
The physical survey, which re
quired the removal of asbestos
pieces from walls, ceilings and
pipes, found that most residential
buildings contain potentially fri
able asbestos in the form of lag
ging around pipes, tiles and
miscellaneous items in the me
chanical areas of buildings.
