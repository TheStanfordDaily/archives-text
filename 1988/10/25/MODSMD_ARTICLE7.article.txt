A recent air-sampling survey of Escon
dido Village disclosed that air asbestos-fiber
levels there possibly exceed the University
established maximum, according to Direc
tor of Health and Safety Alain Decleve.
Decleve stated, however, that the survey
is rough and does not differentiate between
asbestos fibers and other fibers. More elab
orate surveys using electron mircroscopes
are now being conducted.
Escondido Village is being monitored
closely by the University because it has
asbestos sprayed on the ceiling.
Escondido residents received a letter yes
terday informing them not to disturb
potentially-friable asbestos, but the letter
made no mention of the survey.
Decleve stated that hanging skis upon
an asbestos coated pipe, putting a hook
into a wall, throwing a frisbee or closing
a door, could disturb potentially friable, or
non-friable, asbestos.
Non-friable asbestos is not hazardous un
der normal living conditions, but
potentially-friable asbestos, when
disturbed, could release fibers into the air.
Asst. Provost of Planning and Manage
ment John Hughes said Escondido is also
unique among residential buildings because

The University has determined a maxi
mum air sample level of .01 fibers per
cubic centimeters, which is well below the
federal limit of .1 fibers per cubic centi
meter. According to Director of Facilities
Project Management Curt Williams, there
â€¢ are not any buildings with fiber levels
above the University maximum.
Most campus buildings built before 1976
contain some asbestos, but the majority is
in the non-friable form. According to
Decleve, "All of the most urgent asbestos
