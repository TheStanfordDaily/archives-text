## Local group to send $20,000 in aid 
### DJ Berinstein Staff writer 
Hurricane victims in Nicaragua will
soon receive at least $20,000 in emer
gency supplies from the Palo Alto/Stan
ford Medical Aid Community, a PAS
MAC representative announced yester
day.
The local group will make its donation
to Direct Relief International, a Santa
Barbara-based project set to undertake
an emergency airlift to Costa Rica, an
other nation hit hard by the hurricane.
At a meeting tomorrow, PASMAC will
decide on the logistics and the exact
supplies to be sent.
The emergency airlift will run in con
junction with Quest For Peace, a Cath
olic organization based in Maryland and
will make a stop in Nicaragua.
Members of PASMAC are still waiting
to hear exactly how Hurricane Joan has
affected the facilities it helps near
Managua, Nicaragua. The hurricane hit
Sunday and has since developed into a
tropical storm.
"Things must be pretty bad," said
Don Mullen, a leading member of the
group. "We don't know much about the
Pacific Coast, but it probably isn't as
bad as what happened to Bluefields (the
main port on the Atlantic side of Nic
aragua)."
Over the past two years, one of PAS-

The group intends to write letters to U.S. senators
and congressmen asking them to 'put politics aside
for the moment/ Don Mullen said.

MAC's main endeavors has been to help
the Bernardo Dias Ochoa Hospital in
Granada upgrade its facilities and sup
plies. The facility's crumbling walls
forced the hospital to relocate into tents.
PASMAC members are concerned that
these tents may not have withstood the
55-mile-an-hour winds that blew threw
Managua on Sunday.
"I imagine with the rain and the
flooding it's in very serious trouble,"
said Ruben Granach, a medical student
who visited the hospital in late Septem
ber.
DRI has been supplying relief to na
tions ravaged with hurricane problems
or other types of national disasters, and
has just completed relief efforts in the
Philippines. The non-partisan emer
gency relief group has been operating
since World War 11.
According to Mullen, the plane was
a big step towards getting the project
into action, especially due to the cost
of fuel. By having that plane, PASMAC
has a way to send its medical supplies
to Nicaragua immediately.
The group intends to write letters to

U.S. senators and congressmen asking
them "to put politics aside for the mo
ment" and send Nicaragua aid on an
outright basis, Mullen said.
After the United States imposed a
trade embargo on Nicaragua in April,
1985, the country's economy weakened,
and direct federal aid could no longer
occur.
"When you have roofs being blown
off, then rain pouring in, and then flood
ing on top of that, X-ray machines,
sterilizers and other supplies will be
ruined," Mullen added.
At present, no members of PASMAC
have been able to contact the hospitals
in Nicaragua because phone lines are
inaccessible. For now, group members
can only wait to learn how extensive
the hurricane damage was.
Despite the catastrophe, Granach is
optimistic for Nicaragua's recovery.
"Nicaragua is well organized in terms
of having a community health net
work. ... The economy is on its knees,
but its people are really resistant. If
they can get over nine years of Contra
war, this is only more trial," he added.
