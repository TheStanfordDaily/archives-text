Gone are the days of door-to-door cam
paign handshakes.
In the high-tech environment of
Silicon Valley, the newest political cam
paign innovation is door-to-door
videotapes.
More than 100 members of the Stan
ford Democrats attended a rally Satur
day morning to distribute campaign
videos for 12th Congressional District
candidate Anna Eshoo.
According to Subodh Chandra, co
chair of the Stanford Democrats, this is
the "first time in American political his
tory" that videotapes have been used in
neighborhood campaigning. Volunteers
dropped off 90,000 free tapes at indi
vidual homes over the weekend, and the
Eshoo campaign plans to distribute
20,000 over the next few weeks.
The eight-and-a-half minute campaign
shot shows Eshoo explaining her reasons
for running, her view of the district's
role in the country and her differences
with Republican opponent Tom Camp
bell, a Stanford law professor.

According to Cliff Staton, press agent
for the Eshoo campaign, the Democratic
candidate believes this method of cam
paigning is the most effective way to
communicate with the voters because

television commercials are "expensive"
and too brief to deal with the issues,
while mass mailings tend to be thrown
away as junk mail.
Each video costs $1.22, the same
amount as four campaign letters. Ac
cording to Staton, response has been
"tremendous" and voters have reacted
positively.
There has not yet been a concerted
effort to distribute the video on campus.
But, yesterday in White Plaza Stanford
Democrats handed out a few tapes to
interested voters on the condition that
they return them or promise to pass
the videos on to other voters.
