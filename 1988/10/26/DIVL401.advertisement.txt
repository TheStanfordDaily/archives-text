Start something great.
And finish it.
One big difference about working at
ASK Computer Systems Inc. versus
many other software companies is
that our people get to see projects
through from beginning to end.
Now, after four or more years of
doing just that, you may ask, "So
what?" Well, the ability at ASK to
stay with a project throughout its
lifecycle will give you a broader and,
we feel, better perspective on the
industry. Instead of hearing about a
customer's needs or problems sec
ond-hand, you'll hear about them
from the customer. Then work
together to solve them.
You'll understand the market better,
appreciate the role our advanced soft
ware plays in helping manufacturing
firms increase productivity and
reduce costs, and develop a rare—
and valuable — wealth of experience.
All with the company whose software
is used in over 39 countries by manu
facturers of everything from silver
ware and bicycles to personal
computers and microwave telecom
munications systems.
Compare that to what other firms
have to offer. Then start something
great at ASK: your career.
