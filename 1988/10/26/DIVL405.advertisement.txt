"The problem with the Duvaliers is that they have large needs. They
are incapable of living discreetly. They simply need to spend a lot of
money."
â€” Gilles August, an attorney representing Haiti in a lawsuit against
deposed dictator Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier who now lives
with his family on the Cote d'Azur. Duvalier was forced to leave
Haiti in disgrace two years and eight months ago. Haitian government
officials say that the Duvaliers left Haiti with more than $120 million.
