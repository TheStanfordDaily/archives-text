## 19 killed in Peru jet crash 
### 
LIMA, Peru (AP) — An
Aeroperu plane carrying 69 people
crashed in the Andes shortly after
takeoff yesterday, killing at least
19 people, authorities reported.
They said the 50 other pas
sengers and crew were injured.
Some passengers were believed
to be foreign tourists, the officials
reported, but they did not release
the identities or nationalities of
the dead and injured. Lima police
said five of the injured were for
eigners.
Officials said the cause of the
crash had not been determined.
A Peruvian congressman on
Aeroperu Flight 771 said there
was an explosion aboard just after
takeoff.
Reports on the number of
deaths conflicted.
Puno state Gov. Victor Urbiola

put the toll at 22. He spoke in a
radio interview after visiting the
crash site 540 miles southeast of
Lima.
Dr. Percy Cadenas, chief
physician at the Juliaca hospital,
where the injured were taken, said
as many as 20 people perished.
Jose Guerra, president of the
state-run airline, said the plane
was filled to capacity with 69
people and 50 survived the crash,
which occurred soon after the
Dutch-built Fokker F-28 left the
Manco Capac airport at Juliaca
in the Andes. The twin-jet plane
was en route to Arequipa, Peru's
second-largest city 120 miles
southwest of Juliaca.
Tourists often take the flight
to visit Lake Titicaca, in Bolivia
near Juliaca.
Officials said many passengers

and crew suffered burns when the
plane broke in two and the rear
section burst into flames.
Police in Juliaca said four
Peruvian legislators, a senator
and three congressmen, were
among the victims but did not
give their conditions.
Congressman Rolando Avila, a
survivor, told reporters in Juliaca
the plane had traveled about 400
yards after takeoff when the lights
went out and there was an explo
sion.
"I thought our hour had ar
rived," he said. "Everyone
panicked. The pilots apparently
tried to level off to land and the
plane scraped the roofs of some
adobe homes before falling near
a small river."
Guerra said the Fokker crashed
one mile from the airport.
