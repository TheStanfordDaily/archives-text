### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Saying
America's debt to military men
and women doesn't end "the day
the uniform comes off," President
Reagan signed legislation yester
day giving veterans a Cabinet
level voice for the first time.
"I'm saying to all our veterans
what I say to new Cabinet mem
bers: Welcome aboard!"' said
Reagan, the self-proclaimed
enemy of an expanding federal
government, who once suggested
abolishing the departments of Ed
ucation and Energy.
Sitting under a sparkling

autumnal sun in front of a
columned building of the National
War College at Fort McNair, the
president signed into law the bill
creating the Department of Vet
erans Affairs, effective March 15.
Spokesmen for veterans organ
izations applauded the elevation
of veterans issues in the councils
of government, but noted that the
legislation offers no increases in
compensation or improvements in
health care.
Cooper Holt, executive director
of the Washington office of the
Veterans of Foreign Wars, said he

recalled the day last Nov. 10 that
Reagan signaled he had accepted
Cabinet-level status for veterans.
"There were several of us over
there at the White House, and we
came prepared to make a case,"
Holt recalled in a telephone inter
view. "But when he came in, he
apparently had decided against
some of his advisers, and he said
he wanted to do it."
Supporters of the legislation
had argued that the Veterans Ad
ministration already has the fifth
largest budget among federal
agencies.
