Reporter, 11, grills Sen. Quayle
WASHINGTON (AP) - Dan Quayle told a
persistent young reporter from a children's news
program he would rather she had a baby than
abort the fetus if she became pregnant through
her father.
"That's a difficult question and one that does
not have an easy answer, but my answer would
be yes," the Republican vice presidential candi
date told a'ri 11-year-old reporter for "Children's
Express" during a bus tour of Illinois last week.
The question-and-answer session was broad
cast Tuesday on the CBS evening news. The
children's show is broadcast on public television.
"But don't you think it would ruin my whole
life? . . . It's not even my fault and my whole
life would be ruined," the reporter asked.
"Well, I don't think that would be the case at
all," Quayle said. "I think that if somebody had
an unfortunate experience like that, it would be
something that you would remember the rest of
your life.
"The idea of a father abusing a daughter is a
horrendous situation, one you wish that would
never occur, but unfortunately it does occur. . . .
It's a tragic situation."
"So you would want me to have the baby even
though mv whole life would be ruined and I could

be mentally affected?" she asked later.
"I would hope that the baby would live," he
said. "I would just like to see the baby have an
opportunity."
Civil rights activists win Klan suit
ATLANTA (AP) — Forty-nine civil rights ac
tivists who were pelted with rocks and bottles
when they marched into virtually all-white For
syth County were awarded nearly $1 million by
a jury that found the Ku Klux Klan responsible.
A verdict unsealed in U.S. District Court on
yesterday also found 11 individuals responsible
for attacking the activists, who marched into the
county north of Atlanta on Jan. 17, 1987, and
were met by the counter-demonstrators, many
of them KKK members or sympathizers.
The jury reached its verdict Oct. 5, but Judge
Charles Moye Jr. ordered it sealed to give those
who brought the lawsuit time to decide whether
to join Atlanta City Councilman Hosea Williams,
who wanted to drop it.
Williams, who helped organize the march and
was among those who filed the lawsuit, urged
toward the end of the trial that it be dropped
because it would impoverish the families of KKK
members.
