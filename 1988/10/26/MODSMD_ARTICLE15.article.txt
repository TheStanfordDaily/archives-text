# Typhoon sinks ship, 500 dead
## Devastation continues as Ruby hammers Philippines 
### 
MANILA, Philippines (AP) —
Rescuers said yesterday they had
found only 15 survivors from a
ship with more than 500 people
aboard that was sent to the bot
tom by Typhoon Ruby's 140 mph
winds.
Ruby flattened thousands of
houses and took at least 97 lives
on shore. More than 100,000
Filipinos were made homeless by
the typhoon, which was in the
South China Sea late yesterday,
heading west with top winds of
about 100 mph.
Darkness and bad weather
forced an overnight suspension of
the search for survivors of the
Dona Marilyn, a 2,845-ton pas
senger liner.
In suburban Manila, U.S. and
Philippine helicopters rescued
hundreds of people stranded on
rooftops and in trees by the flood
ing Marikina River.
Coast Guard officials said the
Dona Marilyn sank Monday in the
Visayas Sea about 300 miles
southeast of Manila while it was
making the Manila-Tacloban run.
It was was carrying 451 pas
sengers and 60 crew members
from Manila to Tacloban on Leyte
Island when it radioed a distress
call, said Carlos Go, general man
ager of Sulpicio Lines.
