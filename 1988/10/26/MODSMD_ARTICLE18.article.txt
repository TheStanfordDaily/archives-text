## Calero should come 
### 
Controversial speakers
should be attracted,
they spark debate

BRING Adolfo Calero here.
The ASSU Senate voted
last week to forbid the
spending of any student money to
bring this leading Contra rebel to
campus, primarily because it ques
tioned the appropriateness of spon
soring someone with his viewpoint
with student funds.
But, what is a more appropriate
expenditure of student funds than
sponsoring a speaker that will
spark debate among students on
an issue of international impor
tance?
The ASSU Speakers Bureau can
grant up to a $2,500 honorarium
to speakers coming to campus.
Whether payment is absolutely
necessary is another question. Per
haps Stanford could attract many
good speakers without offering
them thousands of dollars. But the
fact is, we do offer honorariums.
So, why not make bringing
speakers to campus a worthwhile
venture? No one wants to hear
someone give a boring speech out
lining the majority view on an
issue. In this case, "worthwhile"

means controversial.
Adolfo Calero is precisely this
kind of speaker. So it comes as no
surprise that some groups on
campus are opposed to his views.
Unfortunately, one of those
groups happened to be a slight
majority of the ASSU Senate.
In November 1986, the senate
granted the Speakers Bureau an
exception and allowed it to spend
$7,500 to bring Dr. Ruth Wes
theimer to campus to talk about
relationships.
Granted, her visit did spark a
debate on the issue of date rape,
which Dr. Ruth essentially claimed
didn't exist. But that comment was
not a planned part of her speech,
it was an answer to an incidental
question from the audience.
In the case of Calero, we can be
sure he will make some controver
sial statements â€” all the more rea
son to spend the money on him.
Politics aren't really at issue
here. The Speaker's Bureau should
not invite only those speakers that
express opinions or support causes
shared by the majority of the sen
ate.
Something more important is at
stake: Free and open discussion of
controversial topics in an intellec
tual environment.
This is supposed to be a univer
sity, remember?
