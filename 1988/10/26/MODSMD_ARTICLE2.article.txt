# Research clinic mishandles data
## Extent of responsibility debated 
### Robert Landon Staff writer 
After a year-long investigation
headed by Provost James Rosse,
the University released a report
yesterday charging former mem-

bers of Stanford's
Mental Health
Clinical Research
Center with a
"serious lapse of
scientific judg
ment."
According to
the report, re
searchers mis
takenly included

as many as 14 patients suffering
from memory loss in "normal"
control groups in neurological
studies that began 10 years ago.
Researchers were examining the
relationship between brain
chemistry and psychiatric disease.
Rosse said the oversight skewed
results and represented "a serious
departure from acceptable scien
tific procedure."
The report also charges faculty
members who made use of the
data with negligence, even those
who were not directly responsible
for the mistakes.
Eleven scientific papers must
now be be either clarified, cor

rected or completely withdrawn
from publication because of the
faulty data.
In 1986, the National Institute
of Mental Health began question
ing the scientific methods of Dr.
Philip Berger â€” the research cen
ter's former director. Berger had
received his research funding
from the institute.
In 1987, the institute further
alleged that he misused the grant
money.
Berger resigned in the spring
of 1987 amidst charges of miscon
duct.
In the end, Berger returned
$128,804 to the institute.
According to Rosse, all the
patients involved in the study gave
informed consent to receive
medication, and none were
harmed.
Rosse said he does not believe
the errors were purposeful distor
tions. "There is no evidence of
fraud," he said.
However, Rosse said the Uni
versity is disappointed with all re
searchers who failed to confirm
the erroneous data.
None of the researchers who
were directly responsible for the
mishandling of the study remain


Rosse
at Stanford, according to Rosse.
Psychiatry Prof. Jack Barchas,
a co-author of several papers that
used the faulty data, criticized
Rosse's report as "inaccurate and
misleading."
The report reflected "an inves
tigative process that was incom
plete and intentionally so,"
Barchas said.
Barchas said he believes the
report unfairly implicates faculty
members who may have used the
faulty data but were unaware of
the problems in the research.
"What we see is an effort to
place blame across a wide spec
trum of faculty members because
the investigation was inadequate
to reconstruct precisely what hap
pened," he said.
"The errors, such as they were,
did not occur in our portion of
the collabortion. The work done
by my associates and myself was
correct and appropriate."
However, Rosse stressed that

"researchers have the obligation
to verify the data they use," al
though he admitted that in this
case verification was difficult.
Rosse's report noted that the
data was collected as far back as
10 years ago, records were missing
or incomplete, and half of the 14
authors who worked with the
faulty data have since left Stan
ford.
Rosse said he thinks some good
will come out of this controversy.
He plans to ask the faculty to
develop more explicit guidelines
for large, multidisciplinary re
search groups.
Berger was nationally recog
nized for his expertise in treating
schizophrenia and depression
through medication. He has pub
lished more than 200 books and
papers.
Colleagues expressed shock and
disappointment as they learned of
Berger's resignation.
"We all really liked Phil Berger.
But I think as he got more pow
erful, his character flaws couldn't
be controlled," said one associate
who wished to remain anony
mous.
