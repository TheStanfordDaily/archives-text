# Research clinic mishandles data
## Extent of responsibility debated 
### Robert Landon Staff writer 
After a year-long investigation
headed by Provost James Rosse,
the University released a report
yesterday charging former mem-

bers of Stanford's
Mental Health
Clinical Research
Center with a
"serious lapse of
scientific judg
ment."
According to
the report, re
searchers mis
takenly included

as many as 14 patients suffering
from memory loss in "normal"
control groups in neurological
studies that began 10 years ago.
Researchers were examining the
relationship between brain
chemistry and psychiatric disease.
Rosse said the oversight skewed
results and represented "a serious
departure from acceptable scien
tific procedure."
The report also charges faculty
members who made use of the
data with negligence, even those
who were not directly responsible
for the mistakes.
Eleven scientific papers must
now be be either clarified, cor

rected or completely withdrawn
from publication because of the
faulty data.
In 1986, the National Institute
of Mental Health began question
ing the scientific methods of Dr.
Philip Berger â€” the research cen
ter's former director. Berger had
received his research funding
from the institute.
In 1987, the institute further
alleged that he misused the grant
money.
Berger resigned in the spring
of 1987 amidst charges of miscon
duct.
In the end, Berger returned
$128,804 to the institute.
According to Rosse, all the
patients involved in the study gave
informed consent to receive
medication, and none were
harmed.
Rosse said he does not believe
the errors were purposeful distor
tions. "There is no evidence of
fraud," he said.
However, Rosse said the Uni
versity is disappointed with all re
searchers who failed to confirm
the erroneous data.
None of the researchers who
were directly responsible for the
mishandling of the study remain
