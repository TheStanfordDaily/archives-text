"It's your lucky day, Mr. Mcßae. . .
You will be rich — rich — very rich, Mr.
Simon N. Mcßae," the letter heralded in
bold dot matrix print. Obviously, I'm not
just any contestant to the people at Pub
lisher's Clearinghouse; they know my
name, and they know it well.
You see, by personalizing their
sweepstakes letter, they give me the sense
that I'm dealing with friends. I know
that when I send in that reply card with
my Personal Grand Prize Number (38-
2425-8935-A, and don't steal it!), some
one will surely recognize my name and
put my entry form on top.
But there's more than just the Grand
Prize of $10 million to win. By scratching
off a series of Gala Giveaway Symbols,
and matching them up with the prede
termined winning prize numbers, I could
be eligible to win up to four other prizes.
Guess what? I'm eligible to win all four!
And I'm guaranteed to win at least one.
Let's see, there's a lovely house, a sporty
car, a luxury yacht and some elegant
jewelry. I'm hoping for the elegant
jewelry.
These prizes are all fine and dandy,
but even if I don't win any, I still have
the stickers. Yes, this is my favorite part
of any Clearinghouse mailing, the sheet
of about 150 magazine stickers. Friends
enjoy finding them adhered to secret
places: under their books, on their doors,
staring down at them when they decide
to take a shower or go to the bathroom.
They provide hours of good, clean fun.
And as well as stickers, there's also
the seal. This is the one that usually
looks very official, the one that always

has the word OFFICIAL written across
it. The one you must remove and affix
to the correct place on the big green
money certificate if you want any hope
of winning. I know a lot of people overlook
the seal altogether. But that's good for
me, because my chances will improve.
Of course, all the "smart" and "rea
sonable" people at this University who
don't send in their sweepstakes help my
odds immeasurably, too.
To them, let me say a hearty, "thank
you." These are the same solemn doubt
ing Thomases who go around declaring:
"No free lunch in the world, say I." These
are the same cynicists who find a catch
behind everything. "Oh sure, you may
win $10 million," they say, "but you'll
have to buy magazines subscriptions
worth twice that amount until your dying
day."
I suppose these people are probably
afraid that others would think they've
succumbed to a cheap media ploy if they
were ever caught participating. They
think that vesting hope in anything with
out "realistic" odds is irrational and
maybe even a little immature.
The "realistic" odds they speak of,
though, are most likely found at the stock
exchange, or in real estate — in short,
with things that cost money. But things
that cost money can have far more devas
tating effects than simply feeling stupid
for having been suckered. You don't see
people jumping off of roofs because
they've just gone bankrupt after losing
the Publisher's Clearinghouse
Sweepstakes.
Of course, I realize that nobody at

Publisher's really knows who I am or
really even cares. I've known this ever
since my freshman year at Gavilan. I
was sorting through mail in the front
office (this was when there weren't
enough P.O. boxes) when I came across
a Publisher's Clearinghouse package for
none other than Mrs. Florence Moore-
Hall herself.
"You, MRS. FLORENCE MOORE
HALL, have already won $10 million."
We sent it in, thinking how great it would
be if they had to split the prize between
440 undergraduates. Even funnier,
though, was thinking of the little snap
shot they'd take of previous winners. Get
it, they'd have to put in a picture of a
building!
Nevertheless, I haven't lost my in
toxication with the sweepstakes. I don't
know, there's just something about
having a contest in the mail that does
good for the nerves.
Even when I lose, although I am dis
appointed, I'm still satisfied because I've
gotten that little healthy rush you get
from gambling, without actually spending
a dime.
I sent my form off in the mail on
Monday. Luck be with me on this one.

"You, MRS. FLORENCE MOORE
HALL, have already won $10 million."
We sent it in, thinking how great it would
be if they had to split the prize between
440 undergraduates. Even funnier,
though, was thinking of the little snap
shot they'd take of previous winners. Get
it, they'd have to put in a picture of a
building!
Nevertheless, I haven't lost my in
toxication with the sweepstakes. I don't
know, there's just something about
having a contest in the mail that does
good for the nerves.
Even when I lose, although I am dis
appointed, I'm still satisfied because I've
gotten that little healthy rush you get
from gambling, without actually spending
a dime.
I sent my form off in the mail on
Monday. Luck be with me on this one.

"It's your lucky day, Mr. Mcßae. . .
You will be rich — rich — very rich, Mr.
Simon N. Mcßae," the letter heralded in
bold dot matrix print. Obviously, I'm not
just any contestant to the people at Pub
lisher's Clearinghouse; they know my
name, and they know it well.
You see, by personalizing their
sweepstakes letter, they give me the sense
that I'm dealing with friends. I know
that when I send in that reply card with
my Personal Grand Prize Number (38-
2425-8935-A, and don't steal it!), some
one will surely recognize my name and
put my entry form on top.
But there's more than just the Grand
Prize of $10 million to win. By scratching
off a series of Gala Giveaway Symbols,
and matching them up with the prede
termined winning prize numbers, I could
be eligible to win up to four other prizes.
Guess what? I'm eligible to win all four!
And I'm guaranteed to win at least one.
Let's see, there's a lovely house, a sporty
car, a luxury yacht and some elegant
jewelry. I'm hoping for the elegant
jewelry.
These prizes are all fine and dandy,
but even if I don't win any, I still have
the stickers. Yes, this is my favorite part
of any Clearinghouse mailing, the sheet
of about 150 magazine stickers. Friends
enjoy finding them adhered to secret
places: under their books, on their doors,
staring down at them when they decide
to take a shower or go to the bathroom.
They provide hours of good, clean fun.
And as well as stickers, there's also
the seal. This is the one that usually
looks very official, the one that always

has the word OFFICIAL written across
it. The one you must remove and affix
to the correct place on the big green
money certificate if you want any hope
of winning. I know a lot of people overlook
the seal altogether. But that's good for
me, because my chances will improve.
Of course, all the "smart" and "rea
sonable" people at this University who
don't send in their sweepstakes help my
odds immeasurably, too.
To them, let me say a hearty, "thank
you." These are the same solemn doubt
ing Thomases who go around declaring:
"No free lunch in the world, say I." These
are the same cynicists who find a catch
behind everything. "Oh sure, you may
win $10 million," they say, "but you'll
have to buy magazines subscriptions
worth twice that amount until your dying
day."
I suppose these people are probably
afraid that others would think they've
succumbed to a cheap media ploy if they
were ever caught participating. They
think that vesting hope in anything with
out "realistic" odds is irrational and
maybe even a little immature.
The "realistic" odds they speak of,
though, are most likely found at the stock
exchange, or in real estate — in short,
with things that cost money. But things
that cost money can have far more devas
tating effects than simply feeling stupid
for having been suckered. You don't see
people jumping off of roofs because
they've just gone bankrupt after losing
the Publisher's Clearinghouse
Sweepstakes.
Of course, I realize that nobody at

Publisher's really knows who I am or
really even cares. I've known this ever
since my freshman year at Gavilan. I
was sorting through mail in the front
office (this was when there weren't
enough P.O. boxes) when I came across
a Publisher's Clearinghouse package for
none other than Mrs. Florence Moore-
Hall herself.
