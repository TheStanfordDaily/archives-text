## Citizens Corps requires a broader spirit of giving 
### 
ELISABETH Browne seems to
have missed the point in her
criticism of the "Citizen Corps"
(Letters, Oct. 24).
Although she admits that such a
plan is long overdue, her letter demon
strates why such a bill has never made
it through Congress: financing higher
education is an expensive and compli
cated proposition; no one is going to be
completely happy with any plan passed
by the legislature.
But getting away from the economics
of higher education, let's look at the
principle involved in a plan that en
courages citizens to serve their country.
Rather than spending 20 straight years

in school, the plan encourages citizens
to dedicate themselves to serving other
people in a "real world" situation.
Rather than pursuing a highly special
ized degree which will allow most loans
to be paid back in a short period of
time, the plan would cause young men
and women to broaden their experi
ence, which will have a greater value
for them and society than any school
education alone.
Why do I disagree with Elisabeth
Browne's criticisms and support a plan
such as the Citizen Corps? Because I
am an example of someone who spent
"a large number of years in civil or
military service" before I began my
studies.

I served for eight years to qualify for
the privilege of returning to earn my
Master's Degree. As a result of my
education at Stanford, I am obligated
to serve this country for another five
years, and will probably serve for
another ten years after that.
Please don't misunderstand my
position. I honestly feel privileged to
attend Stanford and willingly pay back
my education with service. This is
because I what I'm doing and
feel that it is important to give some
thing back to my country, which has
given me so much. Also, my objective
is not only to gain an education, but
to improve my ability to serve; the
education is a nice by-product and one

hopes it will make me a better person.
The only way a Citizen Corps plan
will work is if the people of this coun
try decide to volunteer because it is
the right thing to do. Giving people an
incentive, in the form of funding* part
of the expenses of higher education or
a down-payment for a house, is a nice
way to thank people for their service.
But their real education and reward
will be in the act of serving. Unless
Americans believe that it is their
responsibility to give something back
to their country, any plan such as the
Citizen Corps is destined to fail.
