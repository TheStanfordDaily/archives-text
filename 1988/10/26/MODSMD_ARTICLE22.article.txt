# Heldt and Dugan should not become our scapegoats
## 
### 
We are a few Naranja residents who,
independent of the dorm as a whole,
would like to give our perspective on
the Gus Heldt-Ben Dugan matter.
What Heldt and Dugan did was a
serious offense to both Ujamaa House
and the black community. They dis
rupted Ujamaa's dorm unity, created
dissension and caused pain throughout
East Lagunita.
It is wrong, though, to make scape
goats and object lessons out of them.
Ethnic sensitivities have been
stepped on in past events like the
Otero incident, and students of all
races are rightfully upset â€” but Heldt
and Dugan should be punished only for
their own actions, not for someone
else's past offenses.
For this reason, we feel that perma

nently removing them from University
housing and expelling them from Stan
ford are unacceptable punishments.
At the beginning of the Oct. 16
meeting, Residential Dean Ron Hudson,
who has been a resident fellow in
Ujamaa in the past, had proposed a
resolution within the two dorms. In
contrast to this moderate solution,
after the meeting, the two freshmen
had their future residential and enroll
ment status under scrutiny.
The Oct. 17 article states that resi
dents fled that meeting between
Ujamaa and Naranja due to the "effect
of the incidents."
Indirectly, this is true. Specifically,
both Ujamaa and Naraiya residents
were shocked and frightened by the
hatred and intense emotion they saw
displayed by some Ujamaa residents in
reaction to Heldt's and Dugan's ra
cially offensive actions.
It appears that the unpremeditated
and forceful reaction of some Ujamaa
residents has somehow made Gus' and
Ben's one admitted offense more in
criminating and serious than it had

been when it was first committed.
We feel that these two students
definitely should be punished for their
racially offensive actions, but the Uni
versity should only consider what they
did, and not the results of the Oct. 16
meeting or past racist actions done by
Stanford students.
