# Dukakis is the only choice good for Nicaraguans
## 
### 
The Reagan administration has
wholeheartedly supported a million
dollar effort to rescue two whales
caught under the ice off Alaska, but it

has shown no similar compassion for
the tens of thousands of Nicaraguan
families left homeless and without ade
quate food or water after this week's
hurricane.
Nevertheless, as your news story
(Oct. 24) indicated, the rest of us can
still help by contributing to two of the
organizations that are sending medical
and other humanitarian aid to the
Nicaraguans: Palo Alto/Stanford Medi
cal Aid Community (P.O. Box 9391,
Stanford 94305) and Quest for Peace
(P.O. Box 5206, Hyattsville, MD
20782).
The Nov. 8 election will be a refer
endum on a number of issues, includ
ing reproductive freedom, education
and civil liberties. But the most clear
cut choice this election offers is
whether or not the U.S. should con
tinue to torment a nation of three
million poor people. For those who
believe in the rules of civilized interna
tional behavior, it shouldn't be a diffi
cult choice to make.
