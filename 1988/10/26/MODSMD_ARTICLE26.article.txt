## Translating the language of the Olympics Stanford junior renders Seoul-talk understandable for American athletes 
### Gail Quan 
Varying combinations of deter
mination, hours of practice and
years of dedication paved the way
to the Seoul Olympics for many
Americans.
But for junior Jeannie Yoo, her
ticket to the capital of South
Korea was not her athletic skill.
Rather, she used her fluency in
both Korean and English to serve
as her passport to the 1988 Sum
mer Olympics.
Yoo, who was born in Korea
and is a first-generation Korean-
American, returned to Korea as
a translator for the U.S. Olympic
team after leaving the country in
the third grade.
"I hadn't been back to Korea

in 14 years," said Yoo, who is
majoring in human biology. She
had wanted to return to her child
hood home, and the context of the
visit made the journey even more
appealing. It was a "really neat
experience to work with the ath
letes," she said.
As one of 300 translators, a typ
ical 17-hour day for Yoo entailed
greeting athletes at the airport,
following teams to their practices,
accompanying them on shopping
trips and serving as a link in sol
ving communication problems.
Although she was assigned to
the American team, Yoo was oc
casionally called upon to use her
French to translate for teams
from other countries, such as
France, Canada, Belgium and

Switzerland.
Her interaction with different
teams gave Yoo a perspective on
the character of American ath
letes in comparison to those from
other countries. She said U.S.
team members, as opposed to
their competitors, "tended to be
a little more, you could call it
cocky, or you could call it fun
loving. For the most part, they
were there to have a good time."
Two U.S. gold-medal swimmers
illustrated one American ap
proach to "having a good time"
when they stole a Korean orna
ment from a hotel lobby. She said
the swimmers had "just won, and
they got carried away with the
celebration."
Although she herself did not

handle this incident, Yoo noted
her "unique position" to under
stand the different cultural back
grounds the incident revealed.
Since she is a Korean who has
spent the majority of her life in
the United States, she could "un
derstand both the American and
the Korean" interpretation of the
affair.
Her status as a Korean-
American often perplexed both
Americans and Koreans. "The
Americans, athletes and officials,
were constantly amazed that I
spoke English ... They kept ask
ing where I had learned English,"
Yoo explained.
"And the Koreans weren't used

to working with students who
were Korean but very Ameri
canized ..."
For Yoo, the path to the 1988
Olympics did not begin when she
filled out an application in 1987,
but began three years earlier
when she marched with the
Korean contingent in the opening
ceremonies of the 1984 Olympics
in Los Angeles.
Yoo had originally applied for
a position as a translator, but her
youth and a surplus of applicants
kept her out of the running four
years ago.
According to Yoo, there were
no differences between the
1984 and the 1988 Olympics.
Nonetheless, she did note the in
creased security precautions.
