# New Japan programs tempt students with more than sushi

Nihon wa omoshiroi desu.
In Japanese that means, "Japan is in
teresting." Many Stanford students
would agree, especially those that were
given the opportunity to take part in an
internship program there.
These students have learned there is
much more to business in the land of
the rising sun than jumpsuits, morning
stretches and metric tons of yen.
With the continuing success of
Japanese businesses and the correspond
ing rise in the study of Japanese culture
and language studies, a number of in
ternship programs have sprung up that
provide students with the opportunity to
experience the Japanese business world
first-hand.
In the fall of 1990, the Farm's pas
turage will stretch to Japan, when Stan
ford will be expanding the extensive Over
seas Programs to include Stanford-in-
Kyoto.
"They (the program) will provide a
good perspective on Japanese culture.
Nothing beats going there and totally
immersing yourself in the culture," said
Gina Bertolino, the Kyoto program as
sistant.

Two other programs orchestrated by
Stanford are slated to open by 1990, as
well. The Kyoto Center for Japanese
Studies is tentatively scheduled to open
in September 1989. The Stanford Center
for Technology and Innovation will be
launched the following spring.
The Center for Technology and Inno
vation offers a twofold learning experi
ence. The 30 participants will study dur
ing the spring quarter at the center in
Kyoto, and work as interns throughout
the summer in various parts of Japan.
Despite the program's title highlighting
a focus on scientific pursuits, enrollment
isn't limited to engineers and science
majors, according to Corb Smith, deputy
director of the program. He said all stu
dents interested in any facet of contem
porary Japanese society ranging from
computer science to the humanities are
encouraged to participate.
"We want to get the message across
that the program isn't just for engineers,"
Smith said. "However, at the same time
we don't mean to discourage any en
gineers."
The Kyoto Center for Japanese Studies
program will last nine months and offer
courses mainly in Japanese language, cul

ture and history. Students will come from
Stanford as well as all other American
colleges and universities. Total enroll
ment is planned not to exceed 32 people,
with at least five places reserved for Stan
ford students.
Both programs require some exposure
to the Japanese language before embark
ing. Students must study Japanese for
two years before participating in the
Japanese studies program. The technol
ogy and innovation program requires only
two quarters, which can be fulfilled dur
ing the fall and winter quarters before
the program begins.
Independent of Stanford, a number of
students here have found a way to explore
the Japanese business world by working
as interns in programs offered by indi
vidual Japanese companies.
Two Stanford students, co-term in elec
trical engineering Jeffrey Welser and
senior Peter Commons, participated in
the Sumitome Electric Company three
month internship program this past sum
mer.
Welser said although he knew no
Japanese before he left, he did not find
a significant language barrier because so
many Japanese know English. Now he

says he speaks "enough Japanese to get
through a sushi restaurant."
Welser worked with research on super
conductors, and said the work was "on
the cutting edge" although the company
began the project only a few years ago.
Comparing the working environment and
methods he found in Japan with his pre
vious experience in the United States,
Welser emphasized the importance and
prevalence of cooperative work there.
"Everything is done in groups, you
never have your own project. All
creativity is channeled into the group,
and there is nothing like the American
idea of individual inspiration," he said.
The Sumitome company Welser worked
for originally intended to offer an addi
tional exchange program with Overseas
Studies which would utilize the Stanford
facilities in Kyoto. However, the opening
of the Stanford campus was delayed a
year until the spring of 1990, complicat
ing the creation of an exchange program.
"If [the Kyoto Campusl opens on
schedule next year, my company will try
to offer something with them," acording
to To Murase, a visiting Japanese scholar
at Stanford who works for Sumitome in
Japan.

with at least five places reserved for Stan
ford students.
Both programs require some exposure
to the Japanese language before embark
ing. Students must study Japanese for
two years before participating in the
Japanese studies program. The technol
ogy and innovation program requires only
two quarters, which can be fulfilled dur
ing the fall and winter quarters before
the program begins.
Independent of Stanford, a number of
students here have found a way to explore
the Japanese business world by working
as interns in programs offered by indi
vidual Japanese companies.
Two Stanford students, co-term in elec
trical engineering Jeffrey Welser and
senior Peter Commons, participated in
the Sumitome Electric Company three
month internship program this past sum
mer.
Welser said although he knew no
Japanese before he left, he did not find
a significant language barrier because so
many Japanese know English. Now he

says he speaks "enough Japanese to get
through a sushi restaurant."
Welser worked with research on super
conductors, and said the work was "on
the cutting edge" although the company
began the project only a few years ago.
Comparing the working environment and
methods he found in Japan with his pre
vious experience in the United States,
Welser emphasized the importance and
prevalence of cooperative work there.
"Everything is done in groups, you
never have your own project. All
creativity is channeled into the group,
and there is nothing like the American
idea of individual inspiration," he said.
The Sumitome company Welser worked
for originally intended to offer an addi
tional exchange program with Overseas
Studies which would utilize the Stanford
facilities in Kyoto. However, the opening
of the Stanford campus was delayed a
year until the spring of 1990, complicat
ing the creation of an exchange program.
"If [the Kyoto Campusl opens on
schedule next year, my company will try
to offer something with them," acording
to To Murase, a visiting Japanese scholar
at Stanford who works for Sumitome in
Japan.
