## Richards' solo Album Rocks! Keith has no Room IN His SCHEDULE FOR A MICK 
### Mark Tompkins Staff writer 
Keith Richards' first solo album "Talk
Is Cheap" is finally out. At first I
couldn't help but think of it as a pleas
ant afterthought to all the interviews
Keith has been giving, wherein he
mercilessly rags on Mick Jagger and his
two miserable solo albums.
These interviews are the most enter
taining stories the rock magazines have
printed in ages; in them, Keith dismisses
most of today's music with a flick of
his skull ring, as is his right. And boy,
does he wail on Mick Jagger.
Not that Mick doesn't deserve this

pummeling. (Don't mind the first-name
basis; being a devoted follower of the
Mick Jagger/Keith Richards soap opera,
I haven't thought of these guys in formal
terms for a long time now.
Especially not Mick Jagger — he be
came a cartoon a long time ago). Mick's
solo albums "She's The Boss" and
"Primitive Cool" richly deserved the
bargain-bin oblivion which was their
fate.
Amazingly enough, Jagger is still
trying to make a go of a solo career
even as you read this. He's off touring
in Australia, playing to a bunch of bored
dingoes and kangaroos, I expect.
There is talk, however, that he wants
to get back together with The Rolling
Stones. And well he should. One hearing
of "Talk Is Cheap" should have him
tearing over to Keith's place with a
> conciliatory bottle of Jack Daniels in
• hand.
"Talk Is Cheap" is easily the album
of the year and the best Rolling Stones
album the Stones never recorded.
Hearing it — and that famous guitar
sound — is like a visit from a good
friend you haven't seen in a very long
time.
This is particularly true of "Take It
So Hard," the album's first single. After
hearing it a few times, I felt like I'd
known it subconciously my entire life.
Keith rolls up his sleeves and goes for
a grungy, urban sound that makes the
piddling dance excursions on Jagger's
solo albums, if not most dance music
in general, sound wimpy and neutered.

It's obvi
ous that Ric
hards didn't
give a damn
about trying

to compete with The Pet Shop Boys —
his album is relentlessly uncontem
porary, which is why it will still sound
great 10 years from now.
I have no real axe to grind against
modern music (quite the opposite:
"Pump Up The Volume" clarified a
number of things in my life), but "Talk
Is Cheap" shows how the pushbutton
style of modern recording had better
run and hide when faced with a guy
like Keith Richards. Keith doesn't have
to pressurize his songs into tidy little
hit singles; he finds a good groove and

stays with it.
But he also has different riffs and
backbeats flying around all over the
place. At times your ears don't know
what to seize on, so many interesting
things are happening.
Contributing to all this are: members
of Chuck Berry's and James Brown's
bands; Sarah Dash, a back-up singer
with a gorgeous voice; the great session
guitarist Waddy Wachtel; former Stones
guitarist Mick Taylor; and Steve Jordan,
the former house drummer on "David
Letter-man" and Keith's co-writer here.
Together they produce a purity of sound
which is amazing. And then there is
Keith's own inimitable whiskey voice.
You can tell he's led an interesting life
just by listening to him.
But if talk is cheap, so are record
reviews. Let me pull the plug on this
one right here. Listen to this album
once, and you'll probably agree that it
doesn't need any hard sell.
