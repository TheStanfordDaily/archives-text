# Forum stresses importance of fighting racism, ignorance

Charging that ignorance is no excuse
for racism, a panel of concerned campus
officials last night analyzed the
ramifications of racism at Stanford in
a special edition of KZSU's Campus
Conference talk show.
Sylvia Wynter, associate professor of
Afro-American studies, beaded the
panel of five, which discussed the two
racial incidents which have rattled Stan
ford in the past month.
Panelists included Michael Jackson,
associate dean of Student Affairs; Kim
Coleman, a resident assistant at Ujamaa
House; Dereca Blackmon, a member of
the Black Student Union; and Jennifer
Bryson, president of the Stanford Col
lege Republicans.
Council of Presidents member
Canetta Ivy was scheduled to partici
pate, but was dropped from the show
due to limited space for panelists in the
studio, said Lisa Milliken, KZSU asso
ciate news director. Milliken coordinated
the panel discussion.
The 45-minute discussion was devoid
of the hysteria that surfaced in meetings
at Ujamaa over a week ago following
the disclosure of the disruptive events.

On Oct. 16, at a meeting in Ujamaa,
two freshmen confessed to drawing a
derogatory caricature of a black man
on a poster of Beethoven, which was
found on a bulletin board in Ujamaa
two days earlier. Also found was a fra
ternity party announcement with the
word "nigger" scrawled on it in capital
letters.
Wynter ignited the discussion with
her views on the University's effort
toward educating students about eth
nicity.
"In the last eight years, Stanford has
been the worst top university with re
spect to any input into the new areas
of ethnic studies, except for feminist
studies, which is generally Euro-
American," Wynter said. "We have been
treated in a scandalous fashion."
Jackson stressed that Stanford is
home to a diverse student population
that must be educated about bigotry
and ethnic differences.
"We have to get the ideas out there,"
Jackson said. "The University has to
strengthen its diversity and continue to
push toward its commitments to a
multi-cultural society. We must follow
through on what we are trying to do."
Jackson said he did not think that

racism at Stanford was necessarily
worse than at other American univer
sities, but that Stanford should be a
leader in the battle against bigotry.
Blackmon, a sophomore representing
the BSU, was present at the Ujamaa
meetings and expressed optimism for
the future.
"Someday the heat come down
on those schools that do not change.
Stanford will be looked on as a leader,"
she said.
"This is not an isolated incident,"
Blackmon added. "Racism is a harsh
term, but this is a harsh incident. There
is institutionalized racism at Stanford,
and ignorance is no excuse. The problem
is in the University."
KZSU reporters Mary Escobedo and
Ed Levine joined Milliken in interview
ing over 50 students this week regarding
the Ujamaa incident, and they presented
some of the anonymous opinions to the
panel.
Milliken said some students were
obscene and flaky in their responses
while others showed grave concern.
According to Milliken, some students
felt that the media had sensationalized
the incident.
