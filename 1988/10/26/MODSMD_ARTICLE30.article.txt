If you had to produce a Menudo
concert what would you do?
I'm serious here. This con
undrum occurs in "Tapeheads,"
and although the solution the two
stars come up with is quite
original and gets the job done, it's
not as violent as my personal so
lution.
Two high school friends, Ivan
Alexeev (John Cusack) and Josh
Trager (Tim "Bull Durham" Rob
bins), tired of their nowhere jobs
as security guards, get kicked out
of their home and head to L.A.
to film videos and find their fu
ture.

This would seem to be a good
premise, but the film never really
takes off from there. Despite the
fact that there are a lot of scenes
with funny stuff going on —
making fun of rock videos and
the people involved — everything
is not hunky-dory. There are too
many scenes where the humor
falls flat and the action is boring
or uninteresting.
However, any film that men
tions Menudo in a big way, con
tains the British slang word
"wanker," and throws in a com
pletely off-the-wall scene featur
ing two women battling with
numchucks and butterfly knives
can't be all bad.

Lack of heart
I have a lot of respect for
Whoopie Goldberg. In interviews,
and in live performances, she
seems to combine a deft comic
touch with an unusual humanity.
Unfortunately, few, if any, of
these qualities come to light in
the truly appaling script of
"Clara's Heart."
"Clara's Heart" is the story of
parents torn apart by the death
of their baby daughter; and of
David, their 11-year-old son, and
his attempts to deal with the
death of his sister
Clara Mayfield is the "wonder
ful" person David's parents hire
in Jamaica to help his mother
cope around the house. The movie
is devoted to the supposedly
touching relationship that
develops between Clara and Da
vid. Ha.
David is a walking stereotype.
The script doesn't miss a cliche
in describing him: he wears
glasses, gets picked on by the
school bullies and disappoints his
one-dimensional father by failing
to make the swim team two years
in a row.
Clara, in contrast, is one of the
most inconsistent characters ever
portrayed on the screen. One mo
ment she's telling David he can
always count on her no matter
what; the next moment she's
slamming the door in his face and
telling him he's ruined their
friendship.
Overall, "Clara's Heart" is a
true misnomer — the movie is
totally lacking in heart.
