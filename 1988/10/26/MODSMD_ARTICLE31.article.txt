Kal Keasey â€” Daily
A Brute for lunch
Matt Botvinick (left) and Chris Hart star In the Drama Department's presentation of Anton
Chekhov's "The Brute." The 30-minute performance can be seen for free today through Friday
at noon on the grass between Green and Meyer libraries. Bring your lunch and enjoy this
fanciful farce under the (we hope) sun.
