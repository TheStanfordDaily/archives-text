## Volleyball humbles the Spartans once again 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Records are meant to be broken
— or at least tied. Re-establishing
the school standard for consecu
tive wins, the Stanford women's
volleyball team overcame a strong
Spartan block to beat San Jose
State 15-7, 7-15, 15-0, 15-13 to
extend the squad's streak to 14.

Cardinal 3, Spartans 1

The Cardinal, ranked No. 2 for
yet another week on the American
Volleyball Coaches Association
poll, is now 19-1 for the season.
The No. 11 Spartans fall to 19-4.
Despite tallying the loss, SJSU
earned respect in many ways. The
victim of a Stanford sweep when
the Cardinal traveled to Spartan
Gym in September, the Spartans
took the Maples Pavilion floor de
termined t6 showcase their im
proved level of play.
The Spartans succeeded, adding
improved blocking and more ag
gressive hitting to their alread}'
tough backcourt defense to give
Stanford a real fight.
"There were a couple of things
that they definitely did better
than we did," Stanford Coach Don
Shaw said. "One is that they pen
etrated over on the block. They
blocked better than we did — our
block got in the way of the defense
more than it helped it."
The Spartans made a confident
start, tallying the first two points
of the match. The Cardinal
quickly tied it up, and Stanford
took control for the duration of
the game.
In the second game, it was the
home team's turn to start strong

but finish on the losing end. The
Cardinal scored the first two
points on an ace by Amy Hayes
and a spike by Kristin Klein, and
extended the lead to three after
several side-outs. The Spartans
hung tough, however, and soon
tied the score at 4-4.
Then the real battle ensued.
Stanford pulled out to a 6-4 ad
vantage, only to see the game turn
in San Jose's favor. Behind 14-7
with the Spartans on the service
line, the Cardinal was the victim
of a questionable double-hit call
that gave the game to the visitors.

'The third game,
they couldn't
receive serve
worth a dang ....
They just handed
us the game.'
— Don Shaw

"The second game, by my own
unofficial count, we had about
seven point-scoring opportunities
that we didn't get," Shaw said.
"We just handed the ball back to
them and didn't take care of the
ball. Any time in a game to 15
where you give away seven points,
that could be a different game."
The halftime intermission did
wonders for Stanford. An or
dinarily flat team after the 10-
minute break, the Cardinal
poured it on and shut out the
Spartans in a brief, 10-minute
game.
An ace by Klein started things
off for the Cardinal, followed up

with a quick kill by captain Laura
Olesen. Two plays later, Olesen
took the service line and did not
leave until she had recorded two
aces and given the team an 11-0
lead. A kill by Amy Cooper closed
it out several plays later.
"We were really fired up when
we came out from the second
game, but I think it was more
them not playing well," Klein
said. "They couldn't pass, so I
think we took advantage of that."
"The third game, they couldn't
receive serve worth a dang," Shaw
agreed. "They just handed us the
game."
Stanford was not as lucky in
the final game. San Jose came
out ready to play after the em
barrassing debacle of Game 3 and
rapidly acquired a 3-0 advantage.
The remainder of the match was
a see-saw on the scoreboard, with
each team seizing the lead tem
porarily only to relinquish it a
few plays later.
Down 12-13, the Cardinal fi
nally pulled ahead for good. Spar
tan middle blocker Kim Hicks
mis-hit a good set long, and the
error swayed the momentum
toward the Cardinal side of the
net. Klein smashed an overpass
and Cooper served an ace to bring
up the first match point, and three
plays later Klein finished San Jose
off with a high hit off the blockers'
hands.
"One thing I never question
about our team is its character,"
Shaw said. "We find ways to win.
Even when we're struggling, the
players manage to pull those
games out. We haven't been our
best for the 20 matches; we may
be 19-1, but we haven't played
great the whole time. But we do
what it takes, and that's a sign
of character."

home team's turn to start strong

but finish on the losing end. The
Cardinal scored the first two
points on an ace by Amy Hayes
and a spike by Kristin Klein, and
extended the lead to three after
several side-outs. The Spartans
hung tough, however, and soon
tied the score at 4-4.
Then the real battle ensued.
Stanford pulled out to a 6-4 ad
vantage, only to see the game turn
in San Jose's favor. Behind 14-7
with the Spartans on the service
line, the Cardinal was the victim
of a questionable double-hit call
that gave the game to the visitors.

'The third game,
they couldn't
receive serve
worth a dang ....
They just handed
us the game.'
— Don Shaw

"The second game, by my own
unofficial count, we had about
seven point-scoring opportunities
that we didn't get," Shaw said.
"We just handed the ball back to
them and didn't take care of the
ball. Any time in a game to 15
where you give away seven points,
that could be a different game."
The halftime intermission did
wonders for Stanford. An or
dinarily flat team after the 10-
minute break, the Cardinal
poured it on and shut out the
Spartans in a brief, 10-minute
game.
An ace by Klein started things
off for the Cardinal, followed up

with a quick kill by captain Laura
Olesen. Two plays later, Olesen
took the service line and did not
leave until she had recorded two
aces and given the team an 11-0
lead. A kill by Amy Cooper closed
it out several plays later.
"We were really fired up when
we came out from the second
game, but I think it was more
them not playing well," Klein
said. "They couldn't pass, so I
think we took advantage of that."
"The third game, they couldn't
receive serve worth a dang," Shaw
agreed. "They just handed us the
game."
Stanford was not as lucky in
the final game. San Jose came
out ready to play after the em
barrassing debacle of Game 3 and
rapidly acquired a 3-0 advantage.
The remainder of the match was
a see-saw on the scoreboard, with
each team seizing the lead tem
porarily only to relinquish it a
few plays later.
Down 12-13, the Cardinal fi
nally pulled ahead for good. Spar
tan middle blocker Kim Hicks
mis-hit a good set long, and the
error swayed the momentum
toward the Cardinal side of the
net. Klein smashed an overpass
and Cooper served an ace to bring
up the first match point, and three
plays later Klein finished San Jose
off with a high hit off the blockers'
hands.
"One thing I never question
about our team is its character,"
Shaw said. "We find ways to win.
Even when we're struggling, the
players manage to pull those
games out. We haven't been our
best for the 20 matches; we may
be 19-1, but we haven't played
great the whole time. But we do
what it takes, and that's a sign
of character."

Freshman star Kristin Klein came through in the clutch again for Stanford last night at Maples Pavilion
against San Jose State. The outside hitter had a team-leading 19 kills and 20 digs in the four-game
contest.
Records are meant to be broken
— or at least tied. Re-establishing
the school standard for consecu
tive wins, the Stanford women's
volleyball team overcame a strong
Spartan block to beat San Jose
State 15-7, 7-15, 15-0, 15-13 to
extend the squad's streak to 14.

Women's Volleyball
Cardinal 3, Spartans 1

The Cardinal, ranked No. 2 for
yet another week on the American
Volleyball Coaches Association
poll, is now 19-1 for the season.
The No. 11 Spartans fall to 19-4.
Despite tallying the loss, SJSU
earned respect in many ways. The
victim of a Stanford sweep when
the Cardinal traveled to Spartan
Gym in September, the Spartans
took the Maples Pavilion floor de
termined t6 showcase their im
proved level of play.
The Spartans succeeded, adding
improved blocking and more ag
gressive hitting to their alread}'
tough backcourt defense to give
Stanford a real fight.
"There were a couple of things
that they definitely did better
than we did," Stanford Coach Don
Shaw said. "One is that they pen
etrated over on the block. They
blocked better than we did — our
block got in the way of the defense
more than it helped it."
The Spartans made a confident
start, tallying the first two points
of the match. The Cardinal
quickly tied it up, and Stanford
took control for the duration of
the game.
In the second game, it was the
