# Sailors dominate

### Hugh R. Bethell Staff writer 
„The Stanford sailing team
reinforced its reputation for
talent and depth last weekend,
finishing ahead of all but one
boat at both the Northern Cal
ifornia Sloop Eliminations and
the Stanford Frosh-Soph
Regatta.
In all, the Cardinal squad
topped 17 of Northern Califor
nia's best boats, as only Cali
fornia's top skipper was able
to place ahead of Stanford at
the regattas.
For the older sailors on the
team last weekend's challenge

was to qualify for the Pacific
Coast Sloop Championships,
which will determine which
school represents the district at
the upcoming national champi
onships. The eliminations and
championships are all being
hosted by UC-Santa Cruz,
giving Stanford somewhat of a
local advantage in the contest.
Even so, the Cardinal team
of seniors Bill Shoemaker, Brad
Swett, junior Robert Brown
and sophomore Scott Dale were
hard pressed to win races at
the beginning of Saturday's
regatta. After the first four
matches, Stanford was solidly in fifth and
knew that it had to sail better to qualify
as one of the top three teams.
Fortunately for Stanford, the rediscovery
of a charmed bongo drum provided enough
inspiration to turn the Cardinal effort
around, as the team won the day's last
three races to move into second place.
"I have never had my back so hard
against the wall and been able to walk
away," said Shoemaker, the boat's skipper.
As the fog closed in, bringing an end to
the day's racing, Stanford Coach Blake
Middleton could finally rest easy with the
knowledge that his team would be moving
on to the next level of competition.
"For a while there, I thought that after
the regatta I would have more grey hairs
than Brad Swett," Middleton admitted.
On Sunday, however, Middleton had
fewer reasons to worry as the Cardinal's

freshman and sophomore skippers sailed
past everyone but the Cal sailor who had
beaten Stanford the day before.
Nineteen boats competed in the regatta,
and ideal weather conditions allowed for v a
full 11 races during the day. In the final
standings, Cal laid claim to first, but Stan
ford sophomores Scott Dale and Sue Kown
took second, while sophomore Dave Dowd
and freshman Lydia Snape placed third,
sophomores Rick Rosen and Rebecca
Bryson finished fourth.
"It's rare to see so many good young
sailors on one team. With this concentra
tion of talent, it seems clear that we'll be
going places during the next few years,"
Middleton said.
For some on the Stanford squad, how
ever, the more immediate concern is find
ing a way to top Cal in important upcoming
regattas.
"Their top skipper is sailing very well
these days, but if he thinks we're satsified
to follow him around the course, he's very,
very wrong," said Brown.
