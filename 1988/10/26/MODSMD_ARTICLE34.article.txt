The Stanford women's soccer
team won the World Cup Cham
pionship again.

to "play every game like it was
for the World Cup," the amazing
Cardinal won yet another game
over a tough opponent. This time
Stanford beat nationally-ranked
Division II power Sonoma State,
2-0.

For a few more "anothers:" Jen
nifer Rowland scored another goal
to give her a team-leading eight
on the year; Elise Edwards
chalked up another shutout, her
eighth in the last 10 games, in
creasing her school-record total to
11; and, the Cardinal moves up
another notch in the national
ranking this week, to 14th. Stan
ford goes to 11-4-2, reversing last
year's 4-11-4 mark. Sonoma
State's record now stands at 9-5-
i
The Cardinal did jump on the
Cossacks early, allowing it to con
centrate on defense the rest of the
way. But even the goals were a
direct result of the defensive play,
according to Stanford Coach Ber
hane Andeberhan. As Sonoma
State pushed up to pressure the
Stanford defense, Rowland twice
broke through with the ball to
make full-field runs.
The first time, she was fouled,
and Heather Mclntyre proved
that crime doesn't pay as she
nailed the direct free kick over
the Cossack wall and through the
Sonoma State goalie's hands for
the score. Seven minutes into the
game, Stanford had a 1-0 lead.

The second time around, "Rock
et" Rowland would not be denied.
She went all the way for her 18th
point overall this year. "I just saw
an opening. Lisa (Sime) was great
. . . she was right there, pulling
a defender off. If the girl had chal
lenged me, I could have dumped
it off to her."
The score, at the 25-minute
mark in the first half, put Stan
ford in command for the game.
But Andeberhan noted that it's
not a complete plus to score early.
"It doesn't help you, because now
the team can loosen up and take
chances. The goal for the game
was to play solid for 90 minutes."
But Stanford has been an ex
cellent defensive team all year,
and the squad gave Sonoma State
nothing the rest of the way. "We
never let down — they came at
us the whole game," senior full
back Christy McDevitt said. "We
just stayed tough on D. We got
on top early and held on."
Stanford gets back on the win
ning track, after an exhausting
weekend in which they garnered
a loss, a tie and a win in four
days. Playing away, against a Di
vision II school, Stanford could
have let fatigue and lackadaisacal
play get them. But they handled
the challenge like a playoff-ready
team.
The Cardinal's postseason
hopes are looking better and bet
ter these days. This win helps
them immensely, through the
Transitive Property of Victory.
UCSB (now No. 2 in the West)
beat Stanford early in the season;
Sonoma State then beat the
Gauchos; finally, Stanford beats
Sonoma State at the end of the
season. Voila! Stanford now has
a shot at jumping ahead of UC-
Santa Barbara to No. 2.
But the Cardinal is still taking
it one game at a time.
