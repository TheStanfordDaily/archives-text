# Will Stanford go bowl-ing over holidays?
## 
### 
If the Stanford Cardinal hopes to go
bowling this postseason, they'll need at
least a spare in the ninth and they may
have to get three strikes in the tenth.
At 3-3-1, the team has beaten or tied every
one it should have so far this season. The
only losses have come at the hands of three
of the nation's-finest squads — Notre Dame,
USC and Oregon.

If the Cardinal continues its win-when-we
should-lose-when-we-should pattern the team
will finish 5-5-1. While all those losses would
be against top-notch competition, bowl repre
sentatives are unlikely to be interested in a
.500 team despite its solid performance.
On the flip side, Stanford has one thing
very much in its favor. The Cardinal plays in
the Pacific 10 Conference which is far and
away tops in the country.
The Little, er — Big, Ten showed its true
colors in dropping two to WSU in resounding
fashion early this year.
Nebraska and Oklahoma, the perennial pow

erhouses that keep the Big Eight on the map,
were humbled by USC and UCLA respectively.
And, in recent weeks, the thin veneer has
rubbed off the Southeastern Conference, and
its mediocrity has shown through.
That leaves the Pac-10 atop the heap. The
oft-maligned conference can no longer be
denied its rightful place in the college football
world. That fact is very beneficial to Stanford.
Why? Well it boils down to this. If the
Cardinal should finish at 6-4-1, a bowl bid is
not impossible even though such a record
would not normally merit serious considera
tion.
If Stanford were to capture its four remain
ing games it would finish at 7-3-1. Then, if
the losses were considered based on the level
of competition, a postseason invite would be
all but guaranteed.
Okay, now what would it take to achieve
that plateau? Aye, there's the rub.
The Cardinal's final four games are against
Washington on the road, Washington State
at home, UCLA on the road and California
on the road.
Not one of those is a gimme.
Washington is tough year-in and year-out,
and this year is no exception. But if the team
should vault that hurdle, the next stumbling
block is WSU.
Having their finest season in recent
memory, WSU is led by quarterback Timm
Rosenbach, who can light up the scoreboard
in a hurry.
It's the kind of game Stanford should win,

especially if the team is coming off an upset
of the Huskies. Still, WSU could beat the
Cardinal in its final game of the year at
Stanford Stadium. Thus far, the crowd has
provided a negligible home-field advantage.
After the Cougars comes the big one — No.
1-ranked UCLA in the Rose Bowl. Stanford
has played well down there in recent years,
including a thrilling 28-23 win in 1986 and
a 23-21 cliffhanger victory in 1984.
This year, though, UCLA might be too
tough. Powered by Heisman Trophy-favorite
Troy Aikman, the Bruins are looking for a
national championship. Of course, that may
breed overconfidence and give the Cardinal a
chance to sneak up on them.
After UCLA, the bowl bid will either be
alive and well or dead in the water. Stanford
must go 2-1 at worst over the next three
contests. A win against UCLA would be the
most important of all.
Then Big Game rolls around with the typical
unpredictability of the Stanford-Cal clash. It'll
be another must-win for Stanford as it may
be emotional salvation for the team if nothing
else.
Bowl bids tend to come out around Big
Game day, and if the Cardinal were to capture
its next three games, Stanford could have one
in hand.
But as cornerback Alan Grant puts it, this
team takes 'em one game at a time.
