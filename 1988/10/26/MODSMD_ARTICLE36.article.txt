# Booters look to end slide

### David Hirning Staff writer 
After two bitter losses to Bay
Area rivals that put them below
.500 on the year, the Stanford
men's soccer squad can do one of
the following two things: throw
in the towel and think about next
season, or feel thankful they have
a chance to redeem themselves
and go hard each and every
remaining game.
Just exactly which option comes
to the fore will be revealed today
when the 8-9 Cardinal takes on
Division II Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo at Maloney Field. Game
time is 3 p.m.
Merely at the words "Division
II," one would hypothesize that
Stanford would be licking its
proverbial chops. Half of the Car
dinal wins in their last eleven
games (that is, one of two) have
come against Division II rivals.
But Cal Poly is no ordinary
second-divsion squad.
They have played very well
against superior teams, losing a
battle to San Diego State (No. 4
nationally), 2-1, and outplaying,
but falling to national power
Fresno State. In addition, Stan
ford, coming off an intense game
with Santa Clara on Sunday, could
come out flat if they're not care
ful.
"There's always the threat of a
letdown after that kind of game
(Santa Clara)," coach Sam Koch
noted. "They (Cal-Poly) have had
a frustrating year, but they're a

very well-coached team."
The players seem to be looking
at the game as a chance to show
what kind of team they really are.
Only five games remain in the
team's schedule, and postseason
play does not seem to be in the
cards. To a squad that started the
year at 6-0, finishing well is a
matter of simple pride.
"They're not a high-ranked
team, and we want to go in and
play really hard," senior fullback
Dave Thorpe said. "That's the
most important thing, to play well
and play hard, to get really
psyched up for the game. It's an
opportunity for us to play well,
and we're not looking past this at
all."
Cal Poly features a zone defense
similar to Santa Clara's, though
less intense and without the trap
that the Broncos use so effective
ly. The game is likely to be less
physical and more offense
oriented, because Cal Poly has
smaller fullbacks.
"They're a smaller team, so
we'll be sending a lot of fullbacks
on the attack," Thorpe said. "I'll
be looking for more corner kicks
and set plays."
Sure, I know some of you out
there are saying, "Why should I
take my valuable afternoon time
to go see Stanford play some Di
vision II team?" Well, you should
know that in the last two seasons,
Stanford has tied Cal-Poly 1-1 and
was embarrassed by them, 4-0.
It'll be a good game.
