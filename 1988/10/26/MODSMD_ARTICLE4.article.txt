# Reagan's policies on environment denounced
## Prominent Stanford biologist tells UCLA audience to vote for Dukakis 
### Stephanie Page 
Claiming that the Reagan-Bush
adminstration is "environmen
tally the worst in history," Stan
ford Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich
yesterday told students at UCI.A
to start saving the environment
by "voting for Michael Dukakis."
Ehrlich criticized the current
administration for ignoring
"warnings about the greenhouse
effect" by relaxing energy
efficiency standards for automo
bile manufacturers "exactly when

they should have been tightened
up." He praised Dukakis for
having a "basically excellent grasp
of global environmental issues."
The Reagan administration has
"generally done everything possi
ble to wreck the environmental
security of the United States for
immediate profits for Reagan's
buddies," he added.
Prominently known for his
work in population biology,
Ehrlich is a member of the Na
tional Academy of Science.
Ehrlich outlined the causes and

consequences of the greenhouse
effect — and blasted the Repub
licans — during his speech spon
sored by the Southern California
Population Crisis Committee, the
School of Architecture and Urban
Planning and Associated Students
of UCLA.
The greenhouse effect is a
warming of the atmosphere
caused by increased levels of car
bon dioxide and methane in the
air. The elevated level of fossil
fuel burning worldwide has in
creased atmospheric levels of car

bon dioxide in recent history.
Ehrlich went on to point out
that the president 's attempt to cut
off aid to family planning pro
grams overseas and other Reagan
programs have demonstrated his
unwillingness to support popula
tion control.
The greenhouse effect is inher
ently linked to the growth of the
population. Larger populations
mean that more fuel is burned.
Population growth also destroys
greater forest areas, a danger as
plants combat the greenhouse ef
fect by absorbing carbon dioxide.
Ehrlich said the consequences
of the greenhouse effect are more
serious than a simple warming of
the atmosphere.
The greenhouse effect would
also reduce agricultural produc
tivity and freshwater availability
and cause a rise in sea levels.
Higher sea levels "will cause the
disappearance of Florida,
Bangladesh, the Netherlands,
much of England, Los Angeles and
other low-lying coastal areas," he
said.
"The rich may get a little richer,
temporarily, if they vote for
George Bush, but they will be
voting against their children,"
Ehrlich said.
While Ehrlich is still at UCLA,
his colleague, Biology Prof. Jona
than Roughgarden agreed that
people should be "decidedly

alarmed" about elevated levels in
atmospheric carbon dioxide. How
ever, Roughgarden said the green
house effect's overall impact is
still unclear.
Although Ehrlich blasted
Reagan and during his speech,
Roughgarden pointed out that
Bush has identified himself as an
environmentalist and "should be
held to this."
"Given he (Bush) is likely to be
the winner, we should make sure
he lives up to it."
According to Roughgarden, Du
kakis has a better track record
on environmental issues, as do the
Democrats. He said while Bush's
record is not "particularly inspir
ing" he is heartened by Bush's
"new-found concern."
