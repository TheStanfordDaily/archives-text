# Deaf student activist to speak here

### Amy Rosenfeld Staff writer 
In the fight for deaf rights, a
student leader will address the
issue of equality for the physically
disabled tonight at 8 p.m. at Elliot
Program Center.
Jerry Covell, a senior at Gal
laudet University in Washington
D.C. — the world's only liberal
arts college for deaf students —
will discuss deaf people's struggle
for equality by relating his expe
riences as a student leader who
protested in last March's fight for
a deaf president at Gallaudet.
Covell, who was a key organizer
of the protests at Gallaudet, has
been deaf since birth. He is the
son of two deaf parents, and two
of his three brothers are also deaf.
On March 6, the Gallaudet
board of directors chose Elisabeth
Zinser, who is not deaf, as the
university's seventh president.

Immediately after
Zinser's selection,
Gallaudet s 2,300 stu
dents shut down the
university with dem
onstrations,
blockades and class
boycotts.

Zinser, a 1964 graduate of Stan
ford, topped two other candidates
for the position, both of whom
were deaf graduates of Gallaudet.
Zinser was not fluent in sign lan
guage when she was appointed.
Immediately after Zinser's se
lection, Gallaudet's 2,300 stu
dents shut down the university
with demonstrations, blockades

and class boycotts, calling for the
appointment of a deaf president.
As a result of protests, Zinser
resigned on March 10.
On March 13, the board ap
pointed Irving Jordan, a deaf
member of the Gallaudet faculty
and one of the original three con
tenders for the position, to be the
university's first deaf president.
Jordan was inaugurated Friday,
Oct. 21.
After taking a leading role in
the student protests in March,
Covell has been a chief advocate
for deaf rights nation-wide. He
has appeared on the Cable News
Network, and he spoke at the 25th
anniversary of Martin Luther
King's "I Have A Dream" march
in Washington this August.
Covell's speech at Stanford is
one of his four appearances in
California this week.
