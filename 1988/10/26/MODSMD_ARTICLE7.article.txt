### Amy Rosenfeld Staff writer 
In the fight for deaf rights, a
student leader will address the
issue of equality for the physically
disabled tonight at 8 p.m. at Elliot
Program Center.
Jerry Covell, a senior at Gal
laudet University in Washington
D.C. — the world's only liberal
arts college for deaf students —
will discuss deaf people's struggle
for equality by relating his expe
riences as a student leader who
protested in last March's fight for
a deaf president at Gallaudet.
Covell, who was a key organizer
of the protests at Gallaudet, has
been deaf since birth. He is the
son of two deaf parents, and two
of his three brothers are also deaf.
On March 6, the Gallaudet
board of directors chose Elisabeth
Zinser, who is not deaf, as the
university's seventh president.

Immediately after
Zinser's selection,
Gallaudet s 2,300 stu
dents shut down the
university with dem
onstrations,
blockades and class
boycotts.

Zinser, a 1964 graduate of Stan
ford, topped two other candidates
for the position, both of whom
were deaf graduates of Gallaudet.
Zinser was not fluent in sign lan
guage when she was appointed.
Immediately after Zinser's se
lection, Gallaudet's 2,300 stu
dents shut down the university
with demonstrations, blockades

and class boycotts, calling for the
appointment of a deaf president.
As a result of protests, Zinser
resigned on March 10.
On March 13, the board ap
pointed Irving Jordan, a deaf
member of the Gallaudet faculty
and one of the original three con
tenders for the position, to be the
university's first deaf president.
Jordan was inaugurated Friday,
Oct. 21.
After taking a leading role in
the student protests in March,
Covell has been a chief advocate
for deaf rights nation-wide. He
has appeared on the Cable News
Network, and he spoke at the 25th
anniversary of Martin Luther
King's "I Have A Dream" march
in Washington this August.
Covell's speech at Stanford is
one of his four appearances in
California this week.
He spoke at the California
School for the Deaf on Monday
and will travel to Sonoma State
tomorrow and UC-Berkeley on
Friday.
The Disability Resource Center
and Students for Deaf Awareness
are co-sponsoring the speech,
which Covell will give in sign lan
guage. A voice interpreter will
translate his speech.
Five years ago Jim Bouquin, a
1982 Stanford graduate, founded
the Disability Resource Center, lo
cated in Meyer Library, room 123.
The center has a "general mission
to ensure that the campus is
readily accessible to people with
disabilities," Bouquin said.
In addition to ensuring that
buildings and residences are
equipped with access ramps, the
center provides disabled students
with academic materials through
free services such as note-taking,
text recording, oral interpreting,
support groups and tutoring.

The Department of Linguistics
provides opportunities for hearing
people to better understand the
deaf by offering beginning and in
termediate courses in American
Sign Language, which include dis
cussions on deaf culture.
Many students from the linguis
tics classes become voice inter
preters for deaf students.
Randi McHargue, a 1987 Stan
ford graduate who is the teaching
assistant for the beginning class,
said the class is very popular.
