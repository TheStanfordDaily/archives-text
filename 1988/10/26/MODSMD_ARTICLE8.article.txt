# Am Stud to conduct mock Nov. election
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
In an ambitious attempt to
spark interest in the presiden
tial election, the American
Studies Theme House will con
duct a campus-wide mock elec
tion the week before Election
Day.
The project will determine
the political character of the
Stanford campus and will also
spark interest in the November
election so that more students
will vote, said Aaron Tsai, a
theme associate at the Ameri
can Studies house.
In addition to the presiden
tial and vice-presidential
nominees, the mock election
ballot will include various state
propositions and the California
candidates for the U.S. Senate
and the 12th Congressional
District.
Issues pertaining to Stanford
will also appear on the ballot,
such as the United Stanford
Workers' contract negotiations
with the University and Stan
ford's policies concerning rac
ism.
The Office of Residential Ed
ucation as well as several Uni
versity departments, including
Political Science and American
Studies, will fund the election.
Res Ed will distribute the
ballots on campus this week to
all resident assistants, who will
then give the ballots to the stu
dents before Nov. 1, when the
votes will be tallied.

Students living off-campus
should vote at a center in White
Plaza on Nov. 1, according to
American Studies RA Chris
Chaimberlain. He encouraged
under-aged and international
students to vote as well.
Tsai said the election will not
merely be a popular vote: it
will also model the electoral col
lege system, with each resi
dence receiving a population
based number of electoral
votes.
The mock ballot is modeled
after the state's actual sample
ballot, which is mailed to all
registered voters before the
election.
The ballot will ask voters to
indicate their class and racial
or ethnic background — as well
as whether they consider them
selves "techie" or "fuzzy" — in
order to get a demographic
breakdown of the votes, said
Theme Associate Subodh
Chandra.
Ballot committee chair Bob
Peters, an American Studies
resident, said it is the individ
ual responsibility of the stu
dents to inform themselves on
the issues before they vote in
the mock election.
Peters said the mock election
will "stimulate the voters to
find out what they are going
to decide" when the real elec
tion comes up.
According to Tsai, the 25
American Studies students
working on the project will col
lect the ballots on Nov. 1.
