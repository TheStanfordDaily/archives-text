Cast Your Vote.
Exactly one week before the rest of the nation goes to the polls, you'll have
the chance to vote in PROJECT ELECTION, Stanford's 1988 mock election. Issues
of national and statewide importance will be on the ballot, and for the Presidential
race, each dorm on campus will act as a "state" in the Stanford "electoral college,"
and electoral votes will be determined by dorm population.
The American Studies Theme House is organizing PROJECT ELECTION not
only to determine the opinions of Stanford Students, but also in hopes of increasing
voter awareness and turnout for the November Bth general election.
You can get your ballots from your RA on TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 1.
Completed ballots must be returned to your RA by 7:00 PM, NOVEMBER 1. Off
campus students can vote in White Plaza from 9am-7pm on Tuesday, November 1.
PROJECT ELECTION results will be released soon afterwards. Don't forget-we're
angling for your vote!
