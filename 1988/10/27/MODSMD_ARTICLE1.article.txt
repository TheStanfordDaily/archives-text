# Racism decried at rally
## White Plaza gathering draws over 300 students 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
The Students of Color Coalition
— comprised of four of Stanford's
most politically active student
groups — issued several demands
of the University yesterday, in
cluding demands that students be
required to take ethnic studies
courses and that the University
explicitly make racism a violation
of the Fundamental Standard.
Maintaining the energy and en
thusiasm generated in White
Plaza at yesterday's noontime
"Rally Against Racism," the coa
lition led a cheering and clapping
crowd to University President
Donald Kennedy's office, where
BSU Chair Mary Dillard nailed
the list of demands to Kennedy's

door while a University security
guard looked on.
The group then went to Old
Union where they delivered the
coalition's "Mandate for Change"
— a list of nine immediate de
mands — to other high-ranking
University officials.
In addition to the President's
Office, the University offices of
Student Affairs, Financial Aid and
Residential Education acknowl
edged receiving the demands yes
terday, but no officials would say
when they would comment.
According to Lucky Gutierrez,
co-chair of MEChA, a Chicano
student group, a response from
the Office of Student Affairs is
"critical" because many of the
areas the coalition wants to
change involve that office.
The demands by the coalition
— comprised of the Black Student
Union, Asian American Students
Association, Stanford American
Indian Organization and MEChA
— come in the wake of reactions
to the racist defamation of two
posters earlier this month in
Ujamaa House, the black theme
house.
On one, a picture of Beethoven
was made into a derogatory
caricature of a black man. Two
white freshmen admitted to defac
ing the poster. On the other, an
announcement of a black frater
nity party, the word "Niggers"
was scrawled in large letters.
Of the coalition's nine demands,
three specifically addressed the
Ujamaa incidents:
• Because the incidents were
generally blamed on ignorance,
the coalition demanded that the
University create four fully
funded ethnic studies depart
ments and require that all stu
dents take ethnic studies classes
before graduating. Some members

of the crowd at the rally waved
signs with phrases like
"Caucasians need black history
most."
• In order to assure that people
be punished for racist acts, the
coalition demanded that the Fun
damental Standard be revised to
explicitly include "racism" as a
violation. There is concern that
the students involved in the
Ujamaa incidents will escape
charges, just as the seven student
participants in what was widely
perceived as a KKK-like protest
at Otero House last year were not
charged with violations.
• The coalition demanded the
elimination of Ujamaa's require
ment that no more than half the
house residents be black. One of
the two freshmen responsible for
the Beethoven flier had been as
signed to live in Ujamaa. Most
black house residents actively seek
residence there.
Another important demand was
that eight students be seated on
the Board of Trustees, four from
each of the ethnic minority com
munities. There are no voting stu
dent members of the board.
The coalition is a reorganiza
tion of the Rainbow Agenda. Or
ganized in the spring of 1987, the
Agenda rallied in front of Ken
nedy's office and issued a list of
five immediate demands and five
long-range goals. Several de
mands were never met, including
a call for student members of the
Board of Trustees.
One major victory of the
Agenda, however, was the revision
of the Western Culture, or Area
One, requirement. That revision
was won midway through spring
1988.
