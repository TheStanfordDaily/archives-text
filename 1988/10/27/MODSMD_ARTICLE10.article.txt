# Marsh made lasting part of Arboretum
## 
### Brad Hayward Staff writer 
On campus it's already being
called "Mem Marsh," but ducks
and other birds consider it a
remodeled home.
The University is spending
$20,000 to refurbish a marsh
in the arboretum area near
Palm Drive in order to control
flooding that has plagued the
area and the street for about
six years.
The work will also improve
a natural wildlife habitat for
birds and other animals.
"Everybody wins with this
plan," said Tom Richman,
campus planner in charge of
the Arboretum Restoration
Project, noting that the plan
has not encountered any oppo
sition.
Planning for the marsh proj
ect began during the summer,
and work began last week.
Though the pond itself is nearly
complete, the area will be
replanted later this fall.
Richman said the drainage
problem began during the un
usually wet winter of 1981-82,
when the land in a 5-acre block
bounded by Palm Drive,
Campus Drive, Museum Way
and Lausen Street settled a few
inches during heavy rains.

Every winter since, water has
collected in that settled area
and occasionally run out onto
Palm Drive, he said.
In addition, oak trees in the
area, not accustomed to the wet
earth, have died.
Planners decided the solu
tion was to transform the al
ready swampy area into a
marsh with a controlled drain
age system.
The refurbished 1-acre
marsh was designed by Stan
ford biologists Hugh Possin
gham and Tom Sisk. Excess
water will now flow out of the
area through the ground and
also into the ditch system.
Workers will be able to control
the water flow out of the marsh
using a small dam.
Though part of the original
marshland has been retained,
an open pond and two islands
have been created to support
wildlife in the area. Oak trees
will be replanted in the area.
"We're providing more diver
sity of habitat for the animals,"
Richman said.
Richman added that if the
current marsh project works
out as hoped, the technique
may be applied to other areas
on campus.
