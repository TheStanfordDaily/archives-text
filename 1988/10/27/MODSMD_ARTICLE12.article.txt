# Product design lab created at Business School

### Mark Richman 
Students seeking resources in
the field of product design can
now find help at the Graduate
School of Business.
In conjunction with the Depart
ment of Art and the School of
Engineering, the Business School
has opened a research laboratory
called "The Process of Change."
The lab includes thousands of
magazine and newspaper articles
on topics such as technology,
trade, social trends and consumer
reports â€” all of which give essen
tial background information for
designing products.

Sara Little Turnbull, a profes
sional design consultant with an
academic interest in applied an
thropology, donated the $1 million
collection this year.
"The Process of Change"
delineates American and global
social development over the past
30 years and shows how that de
velopment relates to product
design.
According to Turnbull, product
design draws upon skills used in
art, engineering and business. The
successful product links function
with convenience and aesthetics,
she said.
Product design is not just the

artistic presentation of a product,
but rather the conception of a
product as "a whole," Turnbull
said. The product should "answer
a need, be easily integrated in a
way of life, and enhance the
quality of life."
The lab encourages students to
understand the social trends and
forces that determined product
design in the past.
After examining these social
forces, students will apply general
concepts from the past to this gen
eration to anticipate the need for
future products.
"Awareness lets you see the
need for change," said Turnbull.

Change in products results from
innovative product design and
from an awareness to market
products arising from "creative
accident."
Turnbull said she will be avail
able at the lab to offer direction
to students seeking help with
design projects, but she empha
sized that students are expected
to do research and analysis on
their own.
"To come here and work is not
easy to do," she said. "You'll not
be spoon-fed. There will be no
instant gratification."
The design lab is on a two-year
trial period.
