# NASA grant could conflict with University policy
## 
### Elaine Riggs Staff writer 
While the University might be
a candidate for a NASA-sponsored
space engineering center, a Uni
versity Committee on Research
opposes NASA's U.S. citizenship
requirment because it conflicts
with the University's non
discrimination policy.
Tonight, the Faculty Senate will
hear the committee's opposition
to the National Aeronautic and
Space Administration's current
citizenship requirement, said Elec
trical Engineering Prof. Gordon
Kino, chair of the committee.
Kino emphasized that the com
mittee does not intend its position
to be a major statement at the

Faculty Senate meeting.
NASA's restriction on involve
ment of foreign citizens in space
research conflicts with the Uni
versity's policy on non
discrimination on the basis of
citizenship. In 1979, the Faculty
Senate established Stanford's
non-discrimation policy.
NASA's citizenship requirement
would forbid the University from
giving direct support to foreign
faculty, visiting post-doctoral stu
dents, research assistants and
staff.
The citizenship requirement for
space-engineering research
reflects a typical bureaucratic con
cern over security issues, accord
ing to Kino.
"It's just that people are very

uptight these days about 'losing
all our knowledge to foreigners.'
It's that kind of thing," he ex
plained.
The University applied for an
engineering space center in 1987
and included a letter protesting
the citizenship requirement, ac
cording to Assoc. Dean of Re
search Patricia Devaney.
The University was not
awarded a space engineering cen
ter last year, according to
Devaney, who said she was uncer
tain if the University would apply
for it in future years.
The University joined 10 other
members of the Association of
American Universities in express
ing its "unhappiness" to NASA
about the citizenship requirement,

according to the 1987-88 report
of the Committee on Research.
"The groundswell of protest
that [NASA] received did have an
impact," Devaney said, referring
to the universities' protest.
NASA will probably remove the
citizenship requirement from its
future space engineering center
program announcements,
Devaney added.
"There was some question as
to whether it was worth making
a terrible fuss when this issue
may disappear in a few months
anyway," Kino said.
Kino said he could not recall
any past incidents in which the
University has directly conflicted
with NASA over any citizenship
requirements for researchers.
