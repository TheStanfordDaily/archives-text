## Soviets may free political prisoners Kohl says hundreds of dissenters will be released by the end of the year 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — The Soviet Union will
release all people regarded in the West as
political prisoners by the end of the year,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany
said yesterday after talks with President Mik
hail Gorbachev.
Such a dramatic move would be one of the
boldest signs yet from Gorbachev that he seeks
a clear break with past Kremlin human rights
practices that have included imprisonment of
dissenters from Communist Party policy.
However, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gen
nady Gerasimov refused to confirm or deny
that a release of political prisoners is im
minent.
He told reporters there are about two dozen
such prisoners. Estimates from human rights
groups abroad vary from 150 to more than
500.
Gerasimov said the fate of the prisoners
was not on the agenda of the Soviet-West
German negotiations that brought Kohl to
Moscow.
Kohl's announcement was welcomed by So
viet human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov,
President Reagan and Amnesty International.
But a leader of a group seeking emigration
of Soviet Jews said he remained skeptical.
Reagan, asked what he thought of the
report, said, "I'm hoping that's true."
Sakharov, the 1975 Nobel Peace laureate,
said, "Certainly we await the release of all of
them (prisoners) and their rehabilitation."
In the past three days, Kohl held 10 hours
of talks with Gorbachev and also met with

The Soviets confirmed that
they will release before the
end of the year all political
prisoners as we understand it
in the West.
- Helmut Kohl

other top Kremlin officials.
At a news conference called to sum up his
visit, Kohl said: "The Soviets confirmed that
they will release before the end of the year
all political prisoners as we understand it in
the West."
Kohl would not say whether the promise
came from Gorbachev, only that it was made
during the talks.
Asked how many people may be freed,
Kohl's foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, said: "We are not in a position to
give final figures."
Neither Kohl nor Genscher identified pris
oners who might be released. It was not clear
how many Soviets classified in the West as
political prisoners might be freed, since some
have been sentenced on criminal charges, in
cluding espionage.
Amnesty International, the London-based
human rights group, says it knows of 150
Soviets "imprisoned solely for their non

violent exercise of their fundamental human
rights." It put their number at 10,000 a few
years ago.
Amnesty's list includes about 30 religious
believers, 30 conscientious objectors to mili
tary service, and about 20 people held for
anti-Soviet propaganda and other offenses,
said spokeswoman Carline Windall.
Upon request, Amnesty's New York office
named four people on the list of 150 believed
to be prisoners of conscience:
Levko Lukyanenko, a Ukrainian lawyer and
member of an unofficial Helsinki Watch com
mittee, in internal exile in the Soviet Union;
Boris Mityashin, a Leningrad truck driver,
imprisoned for distributing poetry disap
proved of by the government; Vazif Meylanov,
in a labor camp since 1980 for demonstrating
for Sakharov's release, and Enn Tarto, an
Estonian, also held in a labor camp.
Kronid Lubarsky, editor of Country and
World, the respected emigre publication in
Munich, said there are at least 167 Soviet
political prisoners.
A West German group, the International
Society for Human Rights, said 503 Soviets
are imprisoned on political or religious
grounds.
Many of those sent to labor camp or prisons
for political offenses have been convicted under
two clauses of the Soviet Criminal Code.
Article 70 outlaws "anti-Soviet agitation and
propaganda." Article 190 forbids "anti-Soviet
slander."
