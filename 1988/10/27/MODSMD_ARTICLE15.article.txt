# Black turnout low in S. African elections

JOHANNESBURG, South
Africa (AP) — Far-right white
candidates fared well yesterday as
South Africans of all races, voting
simultaneously for the first time,
elected segregated municipal
councils nationwide.
Anti-apartheid activists, in
defiance of state-of-emergency
regulations, had urged a vote
boycott. Turnouts ranging from
10 to 43 percent were recorded in
major black townships.
Black and white polling stations
were heavily guarded by security
forces. No serious violence was
reported, although police said
scattered arson and stone
throwing attacks did occur.
President P.W. Botha's Na
tional Party faced a fierce chal
lenge from the extreme-right Con
servative Party in white commu
nities, many of which experienced
their first partisan local elections
after decades of Nationalist
dominance.
The most important white bat
tleground was Pretoria, the ad
ministrative capital. The Conser
vatives and Nationalists evenly
split the first 20 wards — out of
42 — for which results were an
nounced.
Right-wing candidates opposed
to integration of beaches won two
seats from incumbents on the
traditionally liberal city council in
Durban.
In Johannesburg, the country's
largest city, the National Party
gained outright control at the ex
pense of liberal candidates. The

Conservatives won their first
council seat ever by decisively
beating a Nationalist candidate in
Mayfair West, a blue-collar ward
where non-whites have been mov
ing in violation of segregation
laws.
"This shows our people reject
the government's move to the
left," said the Conservative victor,
Hendrick Classen. "We want white
areas.'
In Soweto, where more than 2
million blacks live, election offi
cials said 8,007 people voted by 7
p.m., in addition to 20,000 votes
cast in advance. The township,
near Johannesburg, has 347,000
registered voters, but only
258,000 live in wards with con
tested elections.
The state-run South African
Broadcasting Corp. said the over
all black turnout exceeded the 21
percent recorded in the previous
black local elections five years
ago, but it gave no figures. The
government's Bureau for Infor
mation said 30 percent of the
25,428 eligible black voters turned
out in Natal, one of the four
provinces.
Nationwide, 7,229 seats were at
stake in 1,071 communities. The
state radio said only 905 of the
1,839 black council seats were
being contested, with no candi
dates for 138 seats.
Of South Africa's 26 million
blacks, 1,464,198 were eligible to
vote in contested elections Wed
nesday. Polling hours varied, with
the earliest voting at 7 a.m. and

the final balloting at 9 p.m.
Anti-apartheid clergymen such
as Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel
Peace Prize, opposed the elections
and urged South Africans to fast
and pray during the day.
The United Nations General As
sembly voted 146-0 on Wednesday

to condemn the elections. The
United States and Britain
abstained.
The government spent millions
of dollars on advertising to pro
mote a high turnout, contending
that it was broadening democracy
even though blacks cannot vote
in national elections.
