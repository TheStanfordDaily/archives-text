DAMOUR, Lebanon (AP) — Is
raeli warplanes attacked Palestin
ian guerrilla bases at Sidon and
Beirut yesterday, killing at least
six people, including a man iden
tified as a senior PLO commander.
A family of six and three other
people were missing and feared
dead under the rubble in Mieh
Mieh, a refugee camp outside
Sidon that suffered the greatest
damage. Police said 41 people
were wounded, all but one at Mieh
Mieh.
In south Lebanon, Israeli sol
diers and allied militiamen poured
artillery fire on positions of
Lebanese guerrillas in and around
Mashgara, police reported. They
said it might be a prelude to a
ground thrust.
Jets struck targets outside the
southern port and the capital 4
hours apart in the third and
fourth raids since a suicide Shiite
Moslem car bomber killed eight
Israeli soldiers a week ago in the
border "security zone" Israel
maintains in south I^ebanon.
At least 27 people have been
killed and 16 wounded in the four
raids, which bring the total Israel
air strikes in Lebanon this year
to 19. Police say at least 95 have
been killed and 184 wounded in
all the raids.
In Jerusalem, an Israeli mili
tary spokesman later said the
planes blasted suspected guerrilla
bases in southern Lebanon three
times Wednesday — although
Lebanese police reported two
raids — with all aircraft home
safe after scoring accurate hits.
Under military regulations, the

spokesman was not identified.
He said the planes bombed sites
around Damour and Beirut after
raiding targets near Sidon.
"The raid near Sidon is one of
the heaviest, if not the heaviest,
in Lebanon this year," said a

police spokesman, whose name
cannot be used because of regu
lations
Police said the second Israeli
raid struck bases of pro-Syrian
Palestinian factions in the hills
of Khalde and Aramoun on
Beirut's southern fringe.
