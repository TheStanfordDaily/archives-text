# Whales free at last
## 
### 
BARROW, Alaska (AP) - Two
whales headed for the open sea
yesterday after nearly three weeks
imprisonment in the arctic ice,
freed by superpower saviors, the
Soviet and American icebreakers
who hacked a path to freedom.
"The whales are loose and in
the channel and headed out," said
Lt. Mike Haller, a spokesman for
the Alaska National Guard.
"They looked good all after
nooon," Haller said. "To look at
them, you'd have thought they
had their bags packed and were
ready to head south."
Progress in the work to free
the migrating California gray
whales surged on Tuesday when
two Soviet ice-breaking vessels
began smashing the ice that kept
the pair imprisoned. A third
whale, also trapped, is believed to
have died last week.
Before their liberation, as the
Soviet icebreakers drew near, the
whales were "acting in a very ex
cited manner, almost like they can
sense freedom," said Sgt. Lan Rob
ertson, an Alaska National Guard
spokesman.
By midday, the Soviet
icebreakers were a quarter-mile
from the line of breathing holes
being cut by Americans working
in the opposite direction, he said.
Later yesterday, rescuers began
to use a gargantuan, tractor-like
device propelled by pontoon
augers to clear the ice cut by the
icebreaker, Robertson said.
Rescue coordinator Ron Morris
of the U.S. National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration said
the weather was "positively
balmy" â€” 5 degrees Fahrenheit,
Robertson said.

The breakthrough in the effort
to free the migrating gray whales
caught in an early freeze came
after more than a week of delays
and disappointments.
"We feel very good about it,"
said Rear Adm. Sigmund Petersen
of NOAA. "The cooperation has
just been fantastic. The Soviets
came in here with a very positive
attitude and went to work imme
diately. "
On Tuesday, the Americans
moved the huge mammals around
a shoal that had stymied progress
for three days. Eskimos with
chain saws cut a detour in the ice
so the whales could swim around
the shallow water they had
refused to pass.
When the Eskimos started cut
ting the air holes, the whales "fol
lowed the water right to the end.
They like that deeper water,"
Petersen said.
Working in the other direction,
the Soviet icebreakers reduced to
rubble the ice ridge standing be
tween the whales and open water.
The ridge, formed by colliding ice
masses, was a jumble of ice blocks
as big as small houses.
"The whales seemed to be doing
fine," Petersen said. "It's like they
expected something to be happen
ing. Everything seems to be com
ing together."
The whales, which normally
migrate to the Southern Califor
nia coast in the winter, were dis
covered off Alaska's northern
coast three weeks ago, the ice
closing in around them and
leaving them only a few small
breathing holes.
