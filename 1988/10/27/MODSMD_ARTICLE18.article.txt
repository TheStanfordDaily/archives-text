Wang: sentenced for trading fraud
NEW YORK (AP) - A Wall Street analyst
who once impressed others as an ambitious go
getter received three years imprisonment yester
day for his role in the nation's second-largest
insider trading fraud.
"You truly fall into the situation of a person
who bites the hand that feeds him," U.S. District
Judge Kevin Duffy said, shaking his head as he
sentenced Stephen Wang, 24. "You had a brilliant
future and you blew it."
Wang, who had held a promising junior analyst
job at Morgan Stanley & Co., pleaded guilty last
month to fraud for conspiring with Taiwanese
businessman Fred Lee to profit in the stock
market on secrets about impending corporate
takeovers that Wang stole from the firm.
He also pleaded guilty to a separate but much
smaller insider trading scheme involving another
person, whom prosecutors have declined so far
to identify.
Wang and Lee were first exposed in late June
by the Securities and Exchange Commission,
which said Lee made about $19 million in illicit
profits and paid Wang $200,000 for tips provided
between July 1987 and last April.
Morgan Stanley, which had dismissed Wang
immediately, said through spokesman Peter
Roche, "We're pleased justice has been served."
Smog may be used to treat AIDS
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Studies suggest ozone,
the main gas in smog, might be used to reduce
symptoms in AIDS patients and decrease the
already tiny chance of spreading the deadly virus
through donated blood, scientists said yesterday.
One study found ozone stopped the AIDS virus
from multiplying in donated blood while leaving
more than 90 percent of blood cells undamaged,
said Dr. Kenneth Wagner, until recently the head

of the Naval Hospital's AIDS unit in Bethesda,
Md.
The findings raise the possibility that ozone,
often used to disinfect water and sewage, might
be applied to further reduce the risk that donated
blood could carry the AIDS virus, he said.
Kleinman said Wagner's study suggests but
doesn't prove ozone could kill AIDS or other
viruses in blood, but "it's reasonable to try it
out" with more studies because "we would like
to make the risk much smaller."
In a second study, doctors at the Veterans
Administration Medical Center in San Francisco
administered ozone rectally through a tube to
five patients with AIDS and or AIDS-related com
plex.
The treatment halted severe diarrhea in four
of the patients, possibly by hindering the AIDS
virus, said Dr. Michael Carpendale, the hospital's
chief of rehabilitative medicine.
Bush looking for tax mandate
DETROIT (AP) — Republican presidential
nominee George Bush said yesterday that Demo
cratic rival Michael Dukakis sounds like a man
"just itching to repeal" the income tax cuts of
the past eight years. Bush said his election would
be a mandate against tax increases.
In an economics lecture stressing his week-long
campaign theme, the vice president said the Mas
sachusetts governor "never met a payroll" and
doesn't understand the impact of taxes on busi
ness.
Bush told more than 1,600 people at the Eco
nomic Club of Detroit that Reagan administration
policies have produced astounding economic
growth despite Democratic "voices of doom."
The GOP nominee said he would seek to spur
that growth by cutting the capital gains tax rate,
a proposal Dukakis has denounced repeatedly as
a tax break for the wealthy.
