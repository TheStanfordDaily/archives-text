## Vouch for service 
### 
Citizen corps is great
under Mikulski's plan
of service on weekends

A CITIZEN CORPS makes so
much sense.
Under the aegis of this
program, all students could earn
up to $24,000 while serving the
nation part-time. The earnings
would not be paid in cash, but in
vouchers that could be applied to
tuition, or perhaps in some cases,
to a down-payment on a house.
As a result, public service organ
izations and the military would
receive an infusion of able and en
thusiastic participants. All stu
dents interested in working in the
public sector could finally afford
to, since the burden of a part-time
job would be lifted.
Moreover, the vouchers would
free many from the mountain of
debt they face after graduation, al
leviating the financial burden of
parents as well.
While several public service pro
gram proposals are currently being
devised on Capitol Hill, Sen. Bar
bara Mikulski's, D-Md., Citizen
Corps plan should be seriously con
sidered.
Akin to the National Guard,
Mikulski proposes that in exchange
for public service of two weeks a
summer and one weekend a month,

students would receive a $3,000
voucher for either tuition, profes
sional training or a down payment
on a house.
The GI bill, which is somewhat
similar in conception, has helped
educate millions of Americans,
bringing benefits to the nation and
to the participants in the program.
This is especially advantageous
to students in fields that require
so many years of education that
they cannot afford to take off a
year or two to join such programs
as the Peace Corps.
However, public service is not
for everyone. And some students
are rightfully spending their free
time engaging in productive and
worthwhile activities that do not
fall under the public service cate
gory.
Therefore, all federal student en
titlements should not be tied to the
program. Traditional financial aid
packages should remain available
to those who choose not to partic
ipate in the program.
This way, students in need of
financial aid can choose how to pay
for college: either by accumulating
debt or participating in the public
service program.
There is no reason today's stu
dents could not be motivated to
contribute to the society that has
given them so much.
And since more people would be
able to attend college under this
program, a more educated
workforce would be the result.
