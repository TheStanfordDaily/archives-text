## Stanford's Star Wars research considered unethical 
### 
STANFORD HAS HEARD two
voices recently advocating the
United States' SDI, Strategic
Defense Initiative. Hoover Senior Fel
low Edward Teller defended his in
volvement in SDI at Branner, and
Gene Vosseler spoke to the Law School
advocating increased SDI development.
SDI is also known as Star Wars, and
is a very controversial topic. In re
sponse to The Daily's coverage of
Vosseler and Teller, I feel a word of
opposition must be said.
SDI is deceptively called a defensive
plan. It is designed to defend the
United States from Soviet retaliation
in the event of a U.S. initiated attack.
Both the United States and the Soviet
Union have ample technology to strike

The Stanford community
must increase its integri
ty!... We are urging our
research professors to
consider the global effects
of their work.

first. Neither, though, at present can
effectively protect itself from a counter
attack.
SDl's goal is to develop an effective
system to destroy enemy arms before

they have been launched. A defense
against a second strike is the only
missing link to a first strike, and is
estimated to be functional in the
19905.
SDI advancement hinges on scientific
research. Much of this research takes
place at universities such as Stanford
under SDI funding. Professors who
accept SDI funding are directly pro
moting first-strike technology.
Although many SDI-funded research
professors themselves do not believe in
SDI, they are obligated to give the
government the results of their re
search, and it is used directly to fur
ther SDI technology.
The Stanford community must in
crease its integrity! One move in this

direction was last year's graduation
pledge to consider the social and envi
ronmental consequences of jobs gradu
ates would consider. The same ideal
should be embraced by our faculty.
We are urging our research profes
sors to consider the global effects of
their work. To increase campus aware
ness of this issue, on Wednesday, Nov.
2, at noon, a short play and factual
analysis of the danger of the first
strike option will be presented in White
Plaza. It will be followed by a die-in.
Everyone is encouraged to attend and
participate. Please help us increase
everyone's chance of survival!
