In 1975, I spent five days in Chile,
on my way to Australia, as a guest of
a private organization.
I gave a series of talks and met with
many proponents and opponents of the
Pinochet regime.
In addition, I had one meeting with
General Pinochet and his fellow junta
members. A month or so after I re
turned to the United States, I became
the object of organized protests when
ever and wherever I spoke, on campus
and off campus, including the Nobel
ceremonies in Stockholm in December
1976. The protestors accused me of
unspeakable crimes for having been
willing to give advice to so evil a gov
ernment.
I have just returned from a 12-day
stay in Communist China, where I was
mostly the guest of governmental en
tities.

I gave a series of talks and met with
many proponents and a very few oppo
nents of the Communist regime. One
talk in Beijing was to a group of 200
civil servants, some stationed in
Beijing, others brought in for the occa
sion from other cities.
In addition, I had a two-hour private
meeting with Zhao Zi Yang, the Gen
eral Secretary of the Chinese Commu
nist Party.
Incidentally, I gave precisely the
same advice to both Chile and China
— stop inflation by controlling the
quantity of money, free individual
prices from control, privatize
governmental activities, eliminate ex
change control.
I doubt that anyone will deny that,
in every relevant sense, the Chinese
Communist regime has been and still
is more repressive than the Chilean
military junta, or that there is less
chance that real democracy will emerge
in China than in Chile.
Under the circumstances, should I
prepare myself for an avalanche of
protests for having been willing to give

advice to so evil a government? If not,
why not?
