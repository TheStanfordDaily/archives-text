# Panel sponsored by SIG a great success
## 
### 
On Oct. 19, Stanford in Government
hosted an exciting event. Titling the
program, "Citizenship and National
Service," SIG invited a distinguished
{>anel of experts to discuss a recent
egislative proposal that would create a
new "Citizen Corps" to provide college
students with financial aid in return
for community service.
The event was a complete success.
The panel included two distinguished
Senators — Bennett Johnston, D-La.,
and Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., — and
our own University President Donald
Kennedy, among others.
The speakers were informative and
very entertaining. The auditorium was

packed and the rapport between the
students and the panel could not have
been better. As the program drew to a
close, long lines stretched behind the
student microphones for questions and
comments. Like I said, the event was a
complete success.
So you can imagine my disappoint
ment and frustration when I picked up
Thursday's Daily only to find in big,
bold print: "Nunn Misses Campus Ap
pearance."
To me, this is not fair reporting of
the news. Certainly, Senator Nunn was
expected to appear as well as the
others, but the panel was a clear suc
cess without him. Rather than describ
ing the event itself, The Daily opted to
print a sensational headline rather
than an accurate one.
In effect, the newspaper portrayed
our success as a failure. For myself
and for all those at SIG who devoted
tremendous time and effort to this
event, such irresponsibility is inex
cusable.
