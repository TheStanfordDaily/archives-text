## Nature of politics: corrupt 
### 
According to the film
"Cover Up," the Iran-Contra scan
dal is just one small part of an
intricate plot, masterminded by the CIA
and other undercover agents, that began
with the suspicious detainment of the
American hostages in Iran until the exact
date of Reagan's inauguration in 1981.
If this is true, the Reagan Administra
tion began with deception and corruption
and has been feeding the public a big lie.
I am traditionally not a Reagan sup
porter, so I was surprised by how much
the film upset me. The disillusionment
and frustration I felt extended far beyond
the Reagan administration.
I began to question our whole demo
cratic system and to realize that the cor
ruption, the lies, the selfishness and the
power-hunger would exist probably under
any American president. Real accounta
bility to and respect for the people just
isn't very popular today, and I wonder
if this is due to the nature of the people
or the politics.
To be any leader, one must be a bit
arrogant, self-assured and egotistical.
Leaders need to be convinced that their
skills and ideas are the best for the coun
try, for only through this personal
strength can they gain the necessary sup
port.
I am not critical of ambition or confi
dence in one's abilities; people should be
lieve in themselves. But it seems that
our most powerful leaders have more
arrogance and more selfishness than
usual, which often leads to dishonesty
and corruption, and I wonder whether

such qualities are inherent in the people
who strive to reach true positions of
power. For climbing that ladder of success
does include stepping on top of other
people, or knocking them off altogether,
and it takes a certain drive and mentality
to do just that.
On the other side of this coin of power
and greed we have altruism and empathy.
There are people today who have a great
love of mankind, and who as leaders
would be honest and fair, but it seems
that such people do not often aspire to
power or glory. Instead, they devote
themselves to the less glamorous side of
public service and become our teachers,
nurses, social workers, welfare agents,
firefighters, etc.
Altruism is alive and it does exist; it
just isn't found where we need it most,
at the highest levels of government.
Some might argue that our political
leaders begin as altruistic and become
corrupt along the way, as they learn that
making concessions and compromises is
all just a part of politics. From this per
spective, we can blame the system as a
whole but not the individual.
I will agree that there are many
"kinks" in our democracy itself, but I
will also argue that we must examine
who can become our leaders today, and
why. Are those elected the most altruistic,
honest and caring people, determined to
help our country prosper and grow, or
are they the most successful players of
the sly game of power and politics?
With this question in mind I am
reminded of two European men: Louis

XIV and Machiavelli. Louis XIV was a
"Benevolent Monarch," a divine leader
who inherited the throne but still cared
deeply for his subjects. Machiavelli, on
the other hand, was a political writer
who invented the game of power and
politics with his assertion that "the ends
justify the means."
Recent evidence and films like "Cover
Up" show us that the "benevolent" Louis
XIV would be a rare man today, while
Machiavelli would feel right at home with
our present political advisors.
President Reagan would probably not
be to happy to hear me say this, and he
may very well consider himself altruistic
and benevolent. In fact, I hope he does.
Although I may disagree with his policies,
I still like to think that he believes he's
dealing fairly and honestly with the
people.
It is when corruption, greed and per
sonal ambition infect the workings of a
government that I feel deceived. For even
worse than selfish, corrupt and dishonest
"ends," that we are at least aware of and
can argue against, are selfish, corrupt
and dishonest "means" that are kept hid
den from the public.
