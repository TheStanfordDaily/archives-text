Alienation can
indicate growth
Stacey Leake's criticism of the COP
and other "vocal groups" in her letter
to The Daily disturbed me. I was both
ered by her conception of the role the
COP and other campus organizations
should play in the Stanford community.
She criticizes the COP and various
"vocal groups" for being too demand
ing, too political and failing to allow
enough discussion of the issues affect
ing the Stanford community. As a
result, she feels alienated from the
very groups which, she feels, share
many of her ideals.
While I can sympathize with her
feelings of alienation, I question both
her implicit assumption that such
feelings are always counterproductive
and her suggested solution to improve
the exchange of ideas.
From the moment we are welcomed
to Stanford by an RA who knows us
by name, Stanford works to provide its
students with a safe and comfortable
environment. Unfortunately, students
often become hesitant to engage in a
debate which might lead to tension or
conflict. We, as an intellectual commu
nity, are too unwilling to take risks.
Most meaningful discussions involv
ing fundamental values will lead to

feelings of tension, alienation and self
doubt and at times to confronation. To
seek to avoid tense situations and un
comfortable feelings would be a mis
take. We must be willing to take risks
and defend a position which may be
criticized and attacked.
I firmly believe that the Stanford
community has benefited immeasurably
from the "politicizing" of the student
government into an organization which
aims to do more than simply provide
movies, lecture notes and a dry
cleaning service.
I would encourage Ms. Leake and
other students who share her senti
ments to take up those positions
against the "common, emotional and
popular viewpoints." Those students
who differ with the positions of the
COP should consider forming another
slate to run this spring. Many years
ago student leaders used to debate in
White Plaza. I think Stanford could
only profit from an organized challenge
to the COP.
Finally, the implication that the posi
tions taken by the COP and other
"vocal groups" are simply "emotional"
and not well thought out is wrong. I
have found the discussions around the
ASSU to be more intense, searching
and open than many of the class dis
cussion sections that I have attended.
Those members of the COP, progres
sive and Third-World groups whom I
know, all have well thought-out and

articulate positions on many of the
problems facing both Stanford and our
country. For many of them, the work
in their organization relates directly to
their field of study.
We progessive students share a will
ingness Co debate important political
issues. Feelings of alienation, tension
and conflict are not necessarily signs
that something is wrong, but that
people are beginning to feel challenged.
We need to ask ourselves why we feel
as we do, and then question ourselves
as well as those people or groups who
have prompted those feelings. Progress
is never painless.

Several priorities
for Pub Night
We, the Senior Class Presidents of
Stanford University, were disturbed by
the editorial concerning Senior Pub
Nights (Oct. 18, "All dressed up...").
We take great offense to the editorial
board's statements that we "seem to
have given little thought to the issue
of age when planning this year's Senior
Pub Nights," and that we "...were un
sure about the admissions policy at
many of the clubs where [we] had
scheduled pub nights." Considering the

fact that two of the four class presi
dents are under the age of 21, the
aforementioned statements are ludi
crous.
Pub nights present the opportunity
for our fellow classmates to take a
weekly study break and spend time
with each other at an area bar or club.
Four considerations were taken into
account when planning this quarter's
pub nights: 1) Age of admittance 2)
Proximity of the pub to campus 3)
Variety of locations and atmospheres
and 4) Suggestions from class members
as well as input concerning past expe
riences from last year's seniors.
In planning pub nights, we have
attempted to reconcile many of these
seemingly contradictory goals.
Almost half of this quarter's pub
nights include the 19 percent of the
class that is under 21 and satisfy the
81 percent of the class over 21 who
desire a different location for a pub
night each week. The editorial men
tions that "Diversity of atmosphere is
important, but it should not receive top
priority at the expense of more than
343 members of the class..."
Diversity of atmosphere is one of
many priorities; we challenge The Daily
to tell the more than 1400 other class
members that every Pub Night will be
held in one of three locations for the
rest of the year.
It must be noted that the Senior
Class Presidents do not rent out loca-

tions we merely schedule a night with
a local establishment when they can
expect an onslaught of Stanford
seniors. Seniors are then notified of
the locaton where they can expect to
meet with other class members.
Asking students proof of age while
disregarding their senior ID is a prac
tice which is entirely up to the es
tablishment. The pub still remains
open to the public, so the main con
cern of the doorperson is the age of
the prospective customer.
The weekly pub night has been a
senior class tradition for years. Previ
ous class presidents have said it is only
for the 21 and over crowd — yet we
have been working to change this. We
cannot change the law pertaining to
admittance into certain establishments;
yet we can strive to hold as many pub
nights as possible each quarter in es
tablishments which admit persons un
der the age of 21.
Considering our quest for variety as
well as the limited number of area
establishments which agree to hold pub
nights and accept people under the age
of 21, we feel we have adequately
planned the Senior Class Pub Nights
for Fall Quarter.

I would encourage Ms. Leake and
other students who share her senti
ments to take up those positions
against the "common, emotional and
popular viewpoints." Those students
who differ with the positions of the
COP should consider forming another
slate to run this spring. Many years
ago student leaders used to debate in
White Plaza. I think Stanford could
only profit from an organized challenge
to the COP.
Finally, the implication that the posi
tions taken by the COP and other
"vocal groups" are simply "emotional"
and not well thought out is wrong. I
have found the discussions around the
ASSU to be more intense, searching
and open than many of the class dis
cussion sections that I have attended.
Those members of the COP, progres
sive and Third-World groups whom I
know, all have well thought-out and

articulate positions on many of the
problems facing both Stanford and our
country. For many of them, the work
in their organization relates directly to
their field of study.
We progessive students share a will
ingness Co debate important political
issues. Feelings of alienation, tension
and conflict are not necessarily signs
that something is wrong, but that
people are beginning to feel challenged.
We need to ask ourselves why we feel
as we do, and then question ourselves
as well as those people or groups who
have prompted those feelings. Progress
is never painless.

Several priorities
for Pub Night
We, the Senior Class Presidents of
Stanford University, were disturbed by
the editorial concerning Senior Pub
Nights (Oct. 18, "All dressed up...").
We take great offense to the editorial
board's statements that we "seem to
have given little thought to the issue
of age when planning this year's Senior
Pub Nights," and that we "...were un
sure about the admissions policy at
many of the clubs where [we] had
scheduled pub nights." Considering the

fact that two of the four class presi
dents are under the age of 21, the
aforementioned statements are ludi
crous.
Pub nights present the opportunity
for our fellow classmates to take a
weekly study break and spend time
with each other at an area bar or club.
Four considerations were taken into
account when planning this quarter's
pub nights: 1) Age of admittance 2)
Proximity of the pub to campus 3)
Variety of locations and atmospheres
and 4) Suggestions from class members
as well as input concerning past expe
riences from last year's seniors.
In planning pub nights, we have
attempted to reconcile many of these
seemingly contradictory goals.
Almost half of this quarter's pub
nights include the 19 percent of the
class that is under 21 and satisfy the
81 percent of the class over 21 who
desire a different location for a pub
night each week. The editorial men
tions that "Diversity of atmosphere is
important, but it should not receive top
priority at the expense of more than
343 members of the class..."
Diversity of atmosphere is one of
many priorities; we challenge The Daily
to tell the more than 1400 other class
members that every Pub Night will be
held in one of three locations for the
rest of the year.
It must be noted that the Senior
Class Presidents do not rent out loca-

tions we merely schedule a night with
a local establishment when they can
expect an onslaught of Stanford
seniors. Seniors are then notified of
the locaton where they can expect to
meet with other class members.
Asking students proof of age while
disregarding their senior ID is a prac
tice which is entirely up to the es
tablishment. The pub still remains
open to the public, so the main con
cern of the doorperson is the age of
the prospective customer.
The weekly pub night has been a
senior class tradition for years. Previ
ous class presidents have said it is only
for the 21 and over crowd — yet we
have been working to change this. We
cannot change the law pertaining to
admittance into certain establishments;
yet we can strive to hold as many pub
nights as possible each quarter in es
tablishments which admit persons un
der the age of 21.
Considering our quest for variety as
well as the limited number of area
establishments which agree to hold pub
nights and accept people under the age
of 21, we feel we have adequately
planned the Senior Class Pub Nights
for Fall Quarter.

Alienation can
indicate growth
Stacey Leake's criticism of the COP
and other "vocal groups" in her letter
to The Daily disturbed me. I was both
ered by her conception of the role the
COP and other campus organizations
should play in the Stanford community.
She criticizes the COP and various
"vocal groups" for being too demand
ing, too political and failing to allow
enough discussion of the issues affect
ing the Stanford community. As a
result, she feels alienated from the
very groups which, she feels, share
many of her ideals.
While I can sympathize with her
feelings of alienation, I question both
her implicit assumption that such
feelings are always counterproductive
and her suggested solution to improve
the exchange of ideas.
From the moment we are welcomed
to Stanford by an RA who knows us
by name, Stanford works to provide its
students with a safe and comfortable
environment. Unfortunately, students
often become hesitant to engage in a
debate which might lead to tension or
conflict. We, as an intellectual commu
nity, are too unwilling to take risks.
Most meaningful discussions involv
ing fundamental values will lead to

feelings of tension, alienation and self
doubt and at times to confronation. To
seek to avoid tense situations and un
comfortable feelings would be a mis
take. We must be willing to take risks
and defend a position which may be
criticized and attacked.
I firmly believe that the Stanford
community has benefited immeasurably
from the "politicizing" of the student
government into an organization which
aims to do more than simply provide
movies, lecture notes and a dry
cleaning service.
I would encourage Ms. Leake and
other students who share her senti
ments to take up those positions
against the "common, emotional and
popular viewpoints." Those students
who differ with the positions of the
COP should consider forming another
slate to run this spring. Many years
