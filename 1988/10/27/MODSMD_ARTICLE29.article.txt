## Be as SUREed of your safety 
### Dan Mendelsohn 
Many people walk the campus
alone at night, but few realize
that there exists a safer night
time alternative — SURE escort
service.
The Stanford United for Rape
Elimination program started in
the 1960's and was originally
designed to provide safety for
female students after dark.
SURE staff members are al
ways thinking of new ways to
update their service. The most
innovative development recently
is the distribution of glow-in
the-dark whistles with the serv
ice's name and phone number
printed on them. The whistles
remind people to call for a ride
at night and also give a way to
signal for help in case of trouble.
Many whistles have already
been passed out, and students
are encouraged to pick one up
at the SOS office on the second
floor of Tresidder. Students who
hear a whistle being blown at
night should treat it as a serious
signal for help — and people
are requested not to use them
as toys and blow them at ran
dom.
Another recent change is the
phone number — to something
more easily remembered, 725-
SURE. The location has also
been moved from the Women's
Center near Toyon to the second
floor of Tresidder, where the
more central location allows for
quicker pick-ups from all parts
of campus.
The procedure is simple: call
the handy number and tell the
escorts on duty name, descrip
tion of what is being worn,
.where one is and where one
would like to go. A SURE

worker, clad in an easily
identifiable red jacket and
equipped with a golf cart, is then
dispatched to pick up the caller
and deliver him/her to the re
quested destination within five
minutes.
This service is provided seven
nights a week from 7:00 p.m.
to midnight. The preponderance
of calls come in from Sunday
through Thursday, as people are
more inclined to travel in groups
on the weekends.
There have been complaints
that the hours of the service
should be extended beyond mid
night. Vivian Houng, SURE's
director of services notes,
however, that during winter
quarter of last year SURE did
stay open that extra hour but
received almost no calls between
midnight and 1:00 a.m.
One of the problems
that has dogged SURE is the

lack of public knowledge about
the service, according to
Publicity Director Bridget Lar
sen. Larsen points out that a
woman was accosted on campus
earlier this month while walking
alone at night, and Director of
Public Safety Marvin Harring
ton didn't even mention SURE
in a Daily article on the incident.
"I hope he's aware we exist,"
says Larsen.
Larsen hopes to publicize the
program through dorm speak
ing visits and the continued dis
persal of the promotional
whistles.
SURE does a simple yet vital
job that more students should
take advantage of. As Houng
puts it, "Between 7 p.m. and
midnight, you can call, tell us
where you are, and within five
minutes we'll get you and take
you where you want to go.
That's our service."
