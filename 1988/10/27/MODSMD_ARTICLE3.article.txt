## AT&T donates $280,000 in support 
### Robert Landon Staff writer 
The AT&T Eoundation
handed out a total of $280,000
in grants to 10 Stanford faculty
members for research in the
sciences and engineering earlier
this week.
These "special purposes
grants" targeted professors
who "AT&T has a special in
terest in supporting," said Joe
Krovoza, associate director for
external relations at the School
of Engineering.
However, Krovoza made it
clear that the professors are
under no obligation to do re
search in any direct way for
AT&T.
C.K.N. Patel, executive di
rector of research at Bell Labs,
presented the awards at a lun
cheon Monday at the Faculty
Club.
Patel explained the grants
are intended to keep the United
States at the cutting edge of
technological research. "In
today's global economy, it is
more vital than ever that
American higher education
maintains its position at the
forefront of advanced educa

tion in science and technologi
cal fields," he said.
The grant money will be used
for everything from buying
computers and calorimeters to
developing a new course in
computational physics. The de
partments of Computer Sci
ence, Materials Science,
Chemistry, Electrical Engi
neering, Statistics and Applied
Physics will receive grant
money.
Thomas Kailath and Bernard
Widrow, professors of electrical
engineering, will share $40,000
to help develop "a new kind of
computer, which is in some lim
ited sense like a human brain,"
Widrow said.
The computer will be built
out of electronic parts that
resemble neurons in the brain,
he said. They will use the
money to support student re
search in this field.
Both Krovoza and James
Gibbons, dean of the School of
Engineering, had special praise
for AT&T.
"AT&T has been a source of
strength to us for over 30
years," Gibbons said. "There is
a high quality of interaction."
