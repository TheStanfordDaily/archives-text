# Marching for research

Walking may seem like an un
seemly way to beat the costs of
expensive Stanford medical re
search. Yet the leg-power of the
medical school community, busi
nesses, and at least eight banks
in the Bay Area, will raise money
for continued biological research
by sponsoring a 10-kilometer
walkathon beginning on campus
and winding through Palo Alto
Saturday.
Teams of five or more people,
representing many departments
and groups on and off campus,
from the the ASSU to the De
partment of Gynecology, will
march Saturday in the "Univer
sity to University" walk to benefit
the March of Dimes Birth Defects
Foundation. The walk is spon
sored by the departments of
Pediatrics and Gynecology at the
Medical School.
For 30 years, the March of
Dimes has raised funds nation
wide for the study of birth defects,
which affect one out of 14 babies
born in the United States. Of
more than 3,000 known causes of
birth defects, only 20 percent are
understood.
Several efforts at Stanford cur
rently aim to increase this per
centage. The March of Dimes
funds several labs and clinical pro
grams at the Stanford Medical
Center exploring fetal
development and the causes and
prevention of birth defects.
The labs of Dr. Dale Umetsu
and Dr. Alan Krensky, both in the
Department of Pediatrics, exam
ine the origins of immune re
sponse reactions caused by
immune deficiencies or auto
immune disorders. The immune
system response to these ir
regularities is called cell-mediated
immunity.

Cells of the immune system
known as T-cells attack cells in
fected by viruses. On the surface
of the infected host cell, protein
fragments of the virus are de
tected by the "helper" T-cells cir
culating in the blood.
This interaction may trigger an
amplified immune response
against the infected cell. In this
case, "killer" T-cells, specifically
adapted to attack and destroy that
type of infected cells, prevent fur
ther reproduction of the pathogen.
In addition to fighting infec
tion, cell-mediated immunity has
other important functions. In
auto-immune diseases, such as
juvenile-onset diabetes, the
immune system fights benign
tissue originating in the body.
This may be caused when "hel
per" T-cells mistakenly recognize
a cell line within the body as
foreign, or "non-self," resulting
in attack by "killer" T-cells.
Graft rejection occurs when
proteins of implanted tissue are
read as "non-self by the cellular
immune system, so the organ is
attacked and rejected by the body.
In comparison, no abnor
malities on the cell membrane are
detected when a cancerous cell
line in the body reproduces rapid
ly, so an immune response is not
initiated to control the un
restrained proliferation of harm
ful tissue.
Krensky's lab investigates the
recognition and initiation of im
mune responses against abnormal
cell lines such as cancer. The lab
is examining methods to modify
the immune response.
For example, they are searching
for reagents which may inhibit
graft rejection. Also, he is inves
tigating ways to elicit the opposite
response — to initiate an immune
system attack against the growth
of cancer tissue.

So far, the lab has produced
"killer" T-cells, which can destroy
a cancer cells in test tubes, al
though the results have yet to be
repeated in animals.
Umetsu's work focuses on cel
lular interaction causing immune
responses. Using tests that detect
chemicals given off by certain
"helper" T-cells, his lab inves
tigates the complex interaction of
the "helper" T-cells with the rest
of the immune system.
In another area, research at
Stanford addresses the physical
origins of fetal deformities. With
funding from the March of Dimes,

Of more than 3,000
known causes of
birth defects, only
20 percent are un
derstood.

two labs at Stanford explore cell
interactions that influence differ
entiation into highly complex or
gans and systems.
Dr. William Benitz's research in
the Department of Pediatrics in
vestigates differentiation of the
lungs and pulmonary arteries in
fetuses. For example, his lab ex
amines why a set of cells in the
fetus develops specifically into the
muscle of the pulmonary artery.
Apparently, local environment
regulates this differentiation.
Cells of a different lineage neigh
boring the developing cell line de
termine that it will form arterial
tissue.


Insight into this early develop
mental process may yield an un
derstanding of specific birth
defects, such as pulmonary hyper
tension and spontaneous or con
genital heart disease, one of the
leading causes of death in the
United States.
Dr. Carla Shatz's lab in the De
partment of Neurobiology inves
tigates the prenatal development
of the visual pathway between the
eye and the brain.
Cells of the nervous system,
neurons, send a message from the
eye to the middle brain, where
their signals are transfered to a
second set of neurons stretching
to the visual cortex, where an
image is created. Shatz's group
studies the order of neural con
nections in the middle brain in
fetal development.
Using cat, ferret and rat visual
systems, marker proteins injected

into the eye are picked up by vis
ual neurons and passed along to
the cell junctions at the middle
brain.
With this labeling technique,
workers have mapped neural
junctions and have found that the
initial connections in early devel
opment form randomly. Later,
neural connections rearrange
themselves to allow for a precise
and organized interaction, leading
to the formation of a sensible
image from the thousands of
points of light streaming into our
eyes.
To investigate how this rear
rangement occurs, the lab has de
veloped means to keep brain
tissue alive in the lab for several
hours. By measuring electrical ac
tivity of neurons within the
middle brain, the lab determined
that sorting occurs by trial-and
error firing of neurons in re
sponse to signals from the eye.
Neurons which make inappropri
ate connections are phased out of
action.
Thus, maturation of the visual

system is not fully innate, but
depends on its application. Part
of this developmental process oc
curs after birth, and the process
may be influenced by personal ex
perience.
For example, a child with
cataracts in one eye will develop
neural channels which favor his
or her undamaged eye.
The March of Dimes funds
several other programs at the
Medical Center, including the De
partment of Obstetrics and
Gynecology's clinical service to
detect, prevent and treat compli
cations of high-risk pregnancy.
Check-in for the "University to
University" walkathon Saturday
morning is from 7:30-8:30 a.m.
Organizers of the march expect a
turnout of several hundred.

Dr. William Benitz's research in
the Department of Pediatrics in
vestigates differentiation of the
lungs and pulmonary arteries in
fetuses. For example, his lab ex
amines why a set of cells in the
fetus develops specifically into the
muscle of the pulmonary artery.
Apparently, local environment
regulates this differentiation.
Cells of a different lineage neigh
boring the developing cell line de
termine that it will form arterial
tissue.


Insight into this early develop

leading causes of death in the
United States.
Dr. Carla Shatz's lab in the De
partment of Neurobiology inves
tigates the prenatal development
of the visual pathway between the
eye and the brain.
Cells of the nervous system,
neurons, send a message from the
eye to the middle brain, where
their signals are transfered to a
second set of neurons stretching
to the visual cortex, where an
image is created. Shatz's group
studies the order of neural con
nections in the middle brain in
fetal development.
Using cat, ferret and rat visual
systems, marker proteins injected

into the eye are picked up by vis
ual neurons and passed along to
the cell junctions at the middle
brain.
With this labeling technique,
workers have mapped neural
junctions and have found that the
initial connections in early devel
opment form randomly. Later,
neural connections rearrange
themselves to allow for a precise
and organized interaction, leading
to the formation of a sensible
image from the thousands of
points of light streaming into our
eyes.
To investigate how this rear
rangement occurs, the lab has de
veloped means to keep brain
tissue alive in the lab for several
hours. By measuring electrical ac
tivity of neurons within the
middle brain, the lab determined
that sorting occurs by trial-and
error firing of neurons in re
sponse to signals from the eye.
Neurons which make inappropri
ate connections are phased out of
action.
Thus, maturation of the visual

system is not fully innate, but
depends on its application. Part
of this developmental process oc
curs after birth, and the process
may be influenced by personal ex
perience.
For example, a child with
cataracts in one eye will develop
neural channels which favor his
or her undamaged eye.
The March of Dimes funds
several other programs at the
Medical Center, including the De

Check-in for the "University to
University" walkathon Saturday
morning is from 7:30-8:30 a.m.
Organizers of the march expect a
turnout of several hundred.
Walking may seem like an un
seemly way to beat the costs of
expensive Stanford medical re
search. Yet the leg-power of the
medical school community, busi
nesses, and at least eight banks
in the Bay Area, will raise money
for continued biological research
by sponsoring a 10-kilometer
walkathon beginning on campus
and winding through Palo Alto
Saturday.
Teams of five or more people,
representing many departments
and groups on and off campus,
from the the ASSU to the De
partment of Gynecology, will
march Saturday in the "Univer
sity to University" walk to benefit
the March of Dimes Birth Defects
Foundation. The walk is spon
sored by the departments of
Pediatrics and Gynecology at the
Medical School.
For 30 years, the March of
Dimes has raised funds nation
wide for the study of birth defects,
which affect one out of 14 babies
born in the United States. Of
more than 3,000 known causes of
birth defects, only 20 percent are
understood.
Several efforts at Stanford cur
rently aim to increase this per
centage. The March of Dimes
funds several labs and clinical pro
grams at the Stanford Medical
Center exploring fetal
development and the causes and
prevention of birth defects.
The labs of Dr. Dale Umetsu
and Dr. Alan Krensky, both in the
Department of Pediatrics, exam
ine the origins of immune re
sponse reactions caused by
immune deficiencies or auto
immune disorders. The immune
system response to these ir
regularities is called cell-mediated
immunity.

Cells of the immune system
known as T-cells attack cells in
fected by viruses. On the surface
of the infected host cell, protein
fragments of the virus are de
tected by the "helper" T-cells cir
culating in the blood.
This interaction may trigger an
amplified immune response
against the infected cell. In this
case, "killer" T-cells, specifically
adapted to attack and destroy that
type of infected cells, prevent fur
ther reproduction of the pathogen.
In addition to fighting infec
tion, cell-mediated immunity has
other important functions. In
auto-immune diseases, such as
juvenile-onset diabetes, the
immune system fights benign
tissue originating in the body.
This may be caused when "hel
per" T-cells mistakenly recognize
a cell line within the body as
foreign, or "non-self," resulting
in attack by "killer" T-cells.
Graft rejection occurs when
proteins of implanted tissue are
read as "non-self by the cellular
immune system, so the organ is
attacked and rejected by the body.
In comparison, no abnor
malities on the cell membrane are
detected when a cancerous cell
line in the body reproduces rapid
ly, so an immune response is not
initiated to control the un
restrained proliferation of harm
ful tissue.
Krensky's lab investigates the
recognition and initiation of im
mune responses against abnormal
cell lines such as cancer. The lab
is examining methods to modify
the immune response.
For example, they are searching
for reagents which may inhibit
graft rejection. Also, he is inves
tigating ways to elicit the opposite
response — to initiate an immune
system attack against the growth
of cancer tissue.

So far, the lab has produced
"killer" T-cells, which can destroy
a cancer cells in test tubes, al
though the results have yet to be
repeated in animals.
Umetsu's work focuses on cel
lular interaction causing immune
responses. Using tests that detect
chemicals given off by certain
"helper" T-cells, his lab inves
tigates the complex interaction of
the "helper" T-cells with the rest
of the immune system.
In another area, research at
