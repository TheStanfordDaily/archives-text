# Group struggles to end styrofoam use
## 
### John Wagner 
As part of a continuing effort
to "think globally and act locally,"
Students for Environmental Ac
tion at Stanford has targeted
Tresidder Union as the focus of
its renewed campaign to ban the
use of styrofoam containers on
campus.
According to SEAS member
Kristen Brown, a senior in envi
ronmental science, Tresidder has
been "incredibly cooperative."
Styrofoam poses a two-fold en
vironmental threat, Brown said.
First, some styrofoam production
processes create chlorofluorocar
bons, or CFCs, which are danger
ous to the ozone layer. Second,
styrofoam is neither biode
gradable nor recyclable.
Because of concerns raised by
SEAS last spring, Tresidder will
now only order styrofoam made
by processes that do not produce
CFCs.
Now SEAS has turned its at
tention to the second problem —
to rid Stanford of all styrofoam
products.
There could be long-term envi
ronmental problems caused by the
continued use of styrofoam be
cause there is limited landfill
space for non-recyclable wastes,
according to Barb Voss, co
manager of Stanford's Recycling
Center.
Any waste that Stanford cannot
recycle it sends to the Palo Alto
landfill, which is scheduled to
close within the next decade.
Tresidder has been actively
searching fOr "suitable alterna

tives" to styrofoam, according to
Paul Szczesiul, an associate direc
tor at Tresidder. Currently,
Szczesiul said, Tresidder has been
"phasing out" styrofoam cups and
plates by replacing them with
paper products, which are
biodegradable.
Other containers have been
more difficult to replace, Szczesiul
said, because "styrofoam holds up
better to hot and wet foods." Tres
idder has not yet found alterna
tive products that would satisfy
customers, he said.
Styrofoam is also less expensive
than paper. According to SEAS,
styrofoam is about two-and-a
half-cents cheaper per cup, plate
or bowl. Part of the reason for
the price difference, Szczesiul
said, is the result of the manu
facturing industry having been
geared toward styrofoam produc
tion for so long.
Szczesiul admitted that the
added costs could eventually be
passed on the Tresidder patrons,
though efforts, he said, are being
made to "resist this as much as
possible."
In an effort to end styrofoam
usage as well as curb the waste
of paper products, SEAS has been
selling hard-plastic, 12-ounce
mugs in White Plaza. Brown said
she hopes that students will pur
chase the reusable mugs and
"carry them with them every
where they go," including trips to
Tresidder and Food Service meals.
She said she envisions the
mugs, which sell for two dollars
apiece, being widely used on
campus by the end of spring quar

ter.
If the opinions of patrons of
the Corner Pocket earlier this
week are representative of the stu
dent body, fostering the campus
wide use of all-purpose mugs will
be a formidable task. Though
most thought the idea itself was
laudable, few could imagine that
anyone would use the mugs reg
ularly.
"You'd have to make it so you
couldn't get anything to drink un
less you had this cup," explained
senior Margie Morse. "People are
too used to McDonald's. They give
you cups."
Most Corner Pocket patrons
were not aware of the dangers to
the environment posed by
styrofoam, and some were skepti
cal when given the information.
"It seems that somebody always
finds something bad about every
thing," noted freshman John Pat
ton.
Brown realizes that education
will be a necessary component to
the campaign to ban styrofoam
products. SEAS is planning edu
cational dorm visits in the near
future and will be placing fliers
around campus.
In addition to targeting Tresid
der, SEAS also plans to work with
University Food Service to elimi
nate the use of styrofoam. After
initial meetings with Food Service
officials, SEAS members said they
seem "fairly receptive" to the
group's concerns.
No comment was available from
Food Service representatives, who
did not return calls made over
the past two days.

idder has not yet found alterna
tive products that would satisfy
customers, he said.
Styrofoam is also less expensive
than paper. According to SEAS,
styrofoam is about two-and-a
half-cents cheaper per cup, plate
or bowl. Part of the reason for
the price difference, Szczesiul
said, is the result of the manu
facturing industry having been
geared toward styrofoam produc
tion for so long.
Szczesiul admitted that the
added costs could eventually be
passed on the Tresidder patrons,
though efforts, he said, are being
made to "resist this as much as
possible."
In an effort to end styrofoam
usage as well as curb the waste
of paper products, SEAS has been
selling hard-plastic, 12-ounce
mugs in White Plaza. Brown said
she hopes that students will pur
chase the reusable mugs and
"carry them with them every
where they go," including trips to
Tresidder and Food Service meals.
She said she envisions the
mugs, which sell for two dollars
apiece, being widely used on
campus by the end of spring quar

ter.
If the opinions of patrons of
the Corner Pocket earlier this
week are representative of the stu
dent body, fostering the campus
wide use of all-purpose mugs will
be a formidable task. Though
most thought the idea itself was
laudable, few could imagine that
anyone would use the mugs reg
ularly.
"You'd have to make it so you
couldn't get anything to drink un
less you had this cup," explained
senior Margie Morse. "People are
too used to McDonald's. They give
you cups."
Most Corner Pocket patrons
were not aware of the dangers to
the environment posed by
styrofoam, and some were skepti
cal when given the information.
"It seems that somebody always
finds something bad about every
thing," noted freshman John Pat
ton.
Brown realizes that education
will be a necessary component to
the campaign to ban styrofoam
products. SEAS is planning edu
cational dorm visits in the near
future and will be placing fliers
around campus.
In addition to targeting Tresid
der, SEAS also plans to work with
University Food Service to elimi
nate the use of styrofoam. After
initial meetings with Food Service
officials, SEAS members said they
seem "fairly receptive" to the
group's concerns.
No comment was available from
Food Service representatives, who
did not return calls made over
the past two days.
