Three GSB faculty
receive fellowships
Three of Stanford Business
School's junior faculty members
are the 1988 recipients of two
of the nation's most important
fellowships supporting the work
of young researchers.
Darrell DufTie, assistant pro
fessor of finance, and Paul
Pfleiderer, associate professor of
finance and Robert M. and Anne
T. Bass faculty fellow for 1987-
88, received two of the three
Batterymarch fellowships
awarded nationally during 1988.
In addition, Peter Reiss, as
sociate professor of economics,
was awarded one of eight Sloan
research fellowships in econom
ics.
The three are among seven
current Business School faculty
who have received the highly
selective fellowships in the past
eight years. In addition, three
other professors who have since
left the Business School received
fellowships when they were
members of the school's faculty.
Unlike other fellowships
awarded to senior faculty largely
in recognition of research they
have completed, the Bat
terymarch and Sloan fel
lowhships are awarded to
young, usually non-tenured fac
ulty members in recognition of
their potential to contribute to
their academic field.
"These awards are an indica

tion that our junior people are
on the track toward becoming
senior stars in their areas of
research and teaching," -said
John Roberts, associate dean for
academic affairs at the Business
School.

Grads get fellowships
Four Stanford graduates have
received $25,000 postdoctoral
fellowships from the National
Academy of Education and the
Spencer Foundation to spend
the equivalent of an academic
year on education research.
The Stanford recipients are:
• Carole Beal, who received
her Ph.D. in psychology in 1983,
now an assistant professor of
psychology at Dartmouth;
• Susan Holloway, who re
ceived her Ph.D. in child devel
opment and early education in
1983, now an assistant professor
of education at the University
of Maryland;
• Harvey Kantor, who re
ceived his Ph.D. in 1984 in ed
ucation, now coordinator of ed
ucational studies at the Univer
sity of Utah; and
• Gloria Ladson-Billings, who
also earned her Ph.D. in educa
tion in 1984, now coordinator
of teacher education at Santa
Clara University.
The non-residential fellowship
is based on applicants' past re
search record, the promise of
their early work and the quality
of research described in their
application.
Stanford ranked second only
to Harvard, which had seven
recipients among the 25 chosen
nationally.
