So far as is known, the first "written" Amer
ican Indian text was the brief autobiography
of Reverend Samson Occum, a Mohegan, writ
ten in 1768. Of course the term autobiography
would not be invented until 1809 (by the poet
Robert Southey), and since then countless so
called Indian autobiographies have been writ
ten, most notably the "Life of Black Hawk"
(1833) and "Black Elk Speaks" (1934). So
literature by and about American Indians is
nothing new.
What is new, at least relatively so, is that
a growing number of American Indian writers
are producing literature — novels, short
stories, poetry, plays, autobiographies — that
is not mediated by non-Indian writers, as so
much of the previous literature has been, and
does not appear simply to recount historical
events or reveal cultural phenomena.
American Indian writers, like other Amer
ican ethnic minority writers, are now them
selves mediators of differing cultural norms,
examining their lives and the lives of their
families and tribes in terms of a history that
has situated them between two or more cul
tural worlds.
In "House Made of Dawn," N. Scott
Momaday presents a protagonist of mixed her
itage attempting to find his place — his home
— after his return from World War 11. James
Welch, in his novel "Winter in the Blood,"
chronicles the misadventures of a character,
who remains nameless, as he wanders between
his reservation home and a nearby town. Aptly
ironic, this Indian is a cowboy without a horse.
Louise Erdrich burst onto the scene in 1984
with her astonishing novel "Love Medicine,"
the first in a cycle of four books, which opens
with the death of a leggy Chippewa prostitute
by the name of June Morrissey. (Erdrich had
previously published a collection of poetry
entitled "Jacklight.")
In "Love Medicine," Erdrich explores the
conflicts between two Chippewa families on
and around a North Dakota reservation from
1934 to 1984, as various respective family
members, all related or connected to June
Morrissey in some way, recount the ways their
lives intermesh with one another against a
backdrop of poverty and oppression.
Erdrich followed "Love Medicine" with "The
Beet Queen," which is set in the same region
of the country, but focuses principally on the
lives of a non-Indian family in the town of
Argus.
Now in "Tracks," Erdrich's latest book and

the third in her projected series, she returns
to Indian country at a time — between 1912
and 1924 — when the tribe was suffering the
latest assault of deadly disease and struggling
with government agencies and amongst them
selves to keep what little land they had left.
The novel is told in two alternating voices,
two characters with very different responses
to the conditions around them.
"Tracks" opens with Nanapush, an old
smart-mouthed artificer. "We started dying
before the snow, and like the snow, we con
tinued to fall," Nanapush says as he begins
his ploy to dissuade his adopted daughter,
Lulu, from marrying a Morrissey.
Here, in Nanapush's story, we find so much
of what made for the family rivalries in "Love
Medicine" as Nanapush fights to hold the land
the Morrissey family wants to usurp and sell
to the government.
Pauline, the other narrator, is from a family
of mixed blood skinners. She is "a big-nosed
girl with staring eyes" who "blended into the
stained brown walls."
Pauline vacillates between the Chippewa
beliefs and Christianity, and eventually takes
final vows in a convent. Christianity, as she
constructs it during the course of the novel,
serves to appease her guilt for the deaths of
three men while ironically affording her a
sense of power and self-worth in her endless
battle with insignificance.
In a moment of doubt, Pauline thinks, "I
knew God had no foothold or sway in this
land, or no mercy for the just, or that perhaps,
for all my suffering and faith, I was still
insignificant. Which seemed impossible."
Centra] to the lives of both these narrators,

and to the novel, is the character Fleur Pil
lager, the last of the Pillager clan, known for
their mysterious bond to the woods and
Matchimanito Lake.
Fleur becomes the hinge on which both
characters hang their stories, and on which
Erdrich illuminates the different perspectives
on both characters. For Nanapush, Fleur was
kind: "... I was a branch, coming from Kash
paws, that lived long enough to touch the
next tree over, which was Pillagers."
Here Nanpush is not just connected to Fleur
through her daughter, Lulu, but, most im
portantly, in Erdrich's hands, through his af
finity with the land and tradition and his
desire to keep them.
For Pauline, Fleur is by turn a mystery,
and object of jealousy, and finally a soul to
"net" and "baptize."
In "Tracks," Erdrich is more blatantly po
litical than she has been in many of her works,
and she is at times heavy-handed. Nanpush
emerges as the wise elder pleading for the
cause while Pauline, in her attempts to con
trol, becomes a destroyer of self and others.
This comes much at the expense of Fleur,
who never really emerges as a character in
her own right, but appears instead more as
a symbol, say of nature, which one either
follows in her various mysterious ways or
attempts to control.
Yet Erdrich's stories here are as engaging
as ever and make for a novel that renders
brilliantly her Chippewa characters as they
make and live through history. Nanpush says,
