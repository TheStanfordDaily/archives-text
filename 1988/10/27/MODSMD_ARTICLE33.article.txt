So far as is known, the first "written" Amer
ican Indian text was the brief autobiography
of Reverend Samson Occum, a Mohegan, writ
ten in 1768. Of course the term autobiography
would not be invented until 1809 (by the poet
Robert Southey), and since then countless so
called Indian autobiographies have been writ
ten, most notably the "Life of Black Hawk"
(1833) and "Black Elk Speaks" (1934). So
literature by and about American Indians is
nothing new.
What is new, at least relatively so, is that
a growing number of American Indian writers
are producing literature — novels, short
stories, poetry, plays, autobiographies — that
is not mediated by non-Indian writers, as so
much of the previous literature has been, and
does not appear simply to recount historical
events or reveal cultural phenomena.
American Indian writers, like other Amer
ican ethnic minority writers, are now them
selves mediators of differing cultural norms,
examining their lives and the lives of their
families and tribes in terms of a history that
has situated them between two or more cul
tural worlds.
In "House Made of Dawn," N. Scott
Momaday presents a protagonist of mixed her
itage attempting to find his place — his home
— after his return from World War 11. James
Welch, in his novel "Winter in the Blood,"
chronicles the misadventures of a character,
who remains nameless, as he wanders between
his reservation home and a nearby town. Aptly
ironic, this Indian is a cowboy without a horse.
Louise Erdrich burst onto the scene in 1984
with her astonishing novel "Love Medicine,"
the first in a cycle of four books, which opens
with the death of a leggy Chippewa prostitute
by the name of June Morrissey. (Erdrich had
previously published a collection of poetry
entitled "Jacklight.")
In "Love Medicine," Erdrich explores the
conflicts between two Chippewa families on
and around a North Dakota reservation from
1934 to 1984, as various respective family
members, all related or connected to June
Morrissey in some way, recount the ways their
lives intermesh with one another against a
backdrop of poverty and oppression.
Erdrich followed "Love Medicine" with "The
Beet Queen," which is set in the same region
of the country, but focuses principally on the
lives of a non-Indian family in the town of
Argus.
Now in "Tracks," Erdrich's latest book and

the third in her projected series, she returns
to Indian country at a time — between 1912
and 1924 — when the tribe was suffering the
latest assault of deadly disease and struggling
with government agencies and amongst them
selves to keep what little land they had left.
The novel is told in two alternating voices,
two characters with very different responses
to the conditions around them.
"Tracks" opens with Nanapush, an old
smart-mouthed artificer. "We started dying
before the snow, and like the snow, we con
tinued to fall," Nanapush says as he begins
his ploy to dissuade his adopted daughter,
Lulu, from marrying a Morrissey.
Here, in Nanapush's story, we find so much
of what made for the family rivalries in "Love
Medicine" as Nanapush fights to hold the land
the Morrissey family wants to usurp and sell
to the government.
Pauline, the other narrator, is from a family
of mixed blood skinners. She is "a big-nosed
girl with staring eyes" who "blended into the
stained brown walls."
Pauline vacillates between the Chippewa
beliefs and Christianity, and eventually takes
final vows in a convent. Christianity, as she
constructs it during the course of the novel,
serves to appease her guilt for the deaths of
three men while ironically affording her a
sense of power and self-worth in her endless
battle with insignificance.
In a moment of doubt, Pauline thinks, "I
knew God had no foothold or sway in this
land, or no mercy for the just, or that perhaps,
for all my suffering and faith, I was still
insignificant. Which seemed impossible."
Centra] to the lives of both these narrators,

and to the novel, is the character Fleur Pil
lager, the last of the Pillager clan, known for
their mysterious bond to the woods and
Matchimanito Lake.
Fleur becomes the hinge on which both
characters hang their stories, and on which
Erdrich illuminates the different perspectives
on both characters. For Nanapush, Fleur was
kind: "... I was a branch, coming from Kash
paws, that lived long enough to touch the
next tree over, which was Pillagers."
Here Nanpush is not just connected to Fleur
through her daughter, Lulu, but, most im
portantly, in Erdrich's hands, through his af
finity with the land and tradition and his
desire to keep them.
For Pauline, Fleur is by turn a mystery,
and object of jealousy, and finally a soul to
"net" and "baptize."
In "Tracks," Erdrich is more blatantly po
litical than she has been in many of her works,
and she is at times heavy-handed. Nanpush
emerges as the wise elder pleading for the
cause while Pauline, in her attempts to con
trol, becomes a destroyer of self and others.
This comes much at the expense of Fleur,
who never really emerges as a character in
her own right, but appears instead more as
a symbol, say of nature, which one either
follows in her various mysterious ways or
attempts to control.
Yet Erdrich's stories here are as engaging
as ever and make for a novel that renders
brilliantly her Chippewa characters as they
make and live through history. Nanpush says,


Louise Erdrich Mlchael Dorris

Louise Erdrich was born in
Little Falls, Minn., and grew
up in Wahpeton, North Dakota,
Of German-American and
Chippewa descent, she is a
member of the Turtle Moun-
tain Band of Chippewa.
Erdrich's first book, "Jack-
light," a volume of poetry, was
named one of the 10 best books
of the year by the San Fran-
cisco Chronicle. Her second
book, "Love Medicine," was the
winner of both the National
Book Critics Circle and The Los
Angeles Times award for best

novel of 1985. "The Beet
Queen," published in Septem
ber, 1986, immediately became
a national bestseller.

Part of the first group of fresh

and their five children.

.. there is a story to all, never
visible while it is happening. Only
after, when an old man sits
dreaming and talking in his chair,
the design springs clear."
At a very young age, Louise
Erdrich has dreamed and talked,
and sprung clear.

Like Erdrich, fellow American
Indian writer Leslie Marmon
Silko is concerned with a specific
place and the people who inhabit
that place. And like Erdrich, Silko
examines the ways Indian char
acters live out their lives amidst
a given history.
Where Erdrich uses a more con
ventional narrative form in terms
of character development and plot,
however, Silko often experiments
with narrative form, frequently
framing and splicing longer prose
pieces with poetry, myth and
legend.
In "Ceremony," perhaps Silko's
best known work, Silko frames
the story of a young man alienated
from his homeland and drifting
aimlessly with the legend of
Thought-Woman, the spider,
which serves to both thematize
certain aspects of the central story
line and, finally, to comment on
its outcome, the character's cure
by ceremony.
In "Storyteller," a more recent
work, Silko presents a pastiche of
myths, personal recollections,
photographs, and character
sketches to evoke a sense of her
own Laguna Pueblo family and
their relationship to their land
and history.
"The Delicacy and Strength of
Lace" is a collection of letters
covering an 18-month exchange of
mail between Silko and poet
James Wright. They met only
briefly at a writer's conference in
1975, and three years later, after

Wright read "Ceremony," he ini
tiated the exchange of correspond
ence with a flattering letter about
the novel.
As his own work is so concerned
with the sense of immediacy of
place, it is no wonder Wright felt
an attraction to the poetry and
prose of Silko. In one letter he
notes, "I can see, looking through
the works that I have done, that
our discussions of the relation be
tween people and landscapes is
very much at the heart of it."
The content of the letters
quickly moves beyond formal (and
mutual) admiration for one an
other's work and exposes in warm
and evocative ways the concerns
these writers have about their
own lives and art. They share
family problems, observations
about teaching, family anecdotes,
and issues regarding their craft
as writers (Silko was working on
"Storyteller" during this period).
Pervasive throughout the let
ters is that concern about place,
and how one knows a place.
(Wright is moving about in Eu
rope during much of the corre
spondence and Silko is hopping
from university to university
teaching creative writing.)
Silko comes forth particularly
well when she tells stories and
writes of the Arizona landscape:
"It has been hot with only enough
rain to make the air heavy; but
this weather brings out exotic va
rieties of lizards which are larger
than my hand and iridescent
colors — blues and greens .. . the
saguro fruit is ripening and I
think the scarlet pulp is much
more exciting than the white blos
soms — though certainly they are
lovely — but the fruit pods are
visible for half a mile against the
green. Birds we never see other
wise have begun to arrive for the
feasting ..."
Silko shares her grief at losing
a custody battle to which Wright
responds touchingly with a story
about his estranged son. Wright
demonstrates his sensitivity and
deep concern for Silko again when
he writes about her decision to
quit a permanent teaching post.
This sharing deepens the friend
ship between the two writers
while reinforcing their needs to
keep writing.
Their friendship and art is
likened to lace, as Wright notes
in a letter from Verona, Italy:
"Sometimes I wonder about
things like lace, things that
human beings make with their

hands, things that aren't much
help as shelter from the elements
or against war and other kinds of
brutality.
"Lace was obviously no help to
the Belgians during two horrify
ing invasions in this century.
Nonetheless, the art continues to
survive, the craftsmen weaving
away with the finest precision
over their woofs and spools."
Silko would only see Wright
once again, and that was when
he was in the hospital, a month
before he died of cancer.

Early in their correspondence,
Silko writes, "At Laguna, when
someone dies, you don't 'get over
it' by forgetting; you 'get over it*
by remembering." Certainly this
moving collection of letters by two
extraordinary writers from very
different backgrounds and cul
tures is testimony to the power
of memory, and to the Delicacy
and Strength of Lace.

Like Erdrich, fellow American
Indian writer Leslie Marmon
Silko is concerned with a specific
place and the people who inhabit
that place. And like Erdrich, Silko
examines the ways Indian char
acters live out their lives amidst
a given history.
Where Erdrich uses a more con
ventional narrative form in terms
of character development and plot,
however, Silko often experiments
with narrative form, frequently
framing and splicing longer prose
pieces with poetry, myth and
legend.
In "Ceremony," perhaps Silko's
best known work, Silko frames
the story of a young man alienated
from his homeland and drifting
aimlessly with the legend of
Thought-Woman, the spider,
which serves to both thematize
certain aspects of the central story
line and, finally, to comment on
its outcome, the character's cure
by ceremony.
In "Storyteller," a more recent
work, Silko presents a pastiche of
myths, personal recollections,
photographs, and character
sketches to evoke a sense of her
own Laguna Pueblo family and
their relationship to their land
and history.
"The Delicacy and Strength of
Lace" is a collection of letters
covering an 18-month exchange of
mail between Silko and poet
James Wright. They met only
briefly at a writer's conference in
1975, and three years later, after

Wright read "Ceremony," he ini
tiated the exchange of correspond
ence with a flattering letter about
the novel.
As his own work is so concerned
with the sense of immediacy of
place, it is no wonder Wright felt
an attraction to the poetry and
prose of Silko. In one letter he
notes, "I can see, looking through
the works that I have done, that
our discussions of the relation be
tween people and landscapes is
very much at the heart of it."
The content of the letters
quickly moves beyond formal (and
mutual) admiration for one an
other's work and exposes in warm
and evocative ways the concerns
these writers have about their
own lives and art. They share
family problems, observations
about teaching, family anecdotes,
and issues regarding their craft
as writers (Silko was working on
"Storyteller" during this period).
Pervasive throughout the let
ters is that concern about place,
and how one knows a place.
(Wright is moving about in Eu
rope during much of the corre
spondence and Silko is hopping
from university to university
teaching creative writing.)
Silko comes forth particularly
well when she tells stories and
writes of the Arizona landscape:
"It has been hot with only enough
rain to make the air heavy; but
this weather brings out exotic va
rieties of lizards which are larger
than my hand and iridescent
colors — blues and greens .. . the
saguro fruit is ripening and I
think the scarlet pulp is much
more exciting than the white blos
soms — though certainly they are
lovely — but the fruit pods are
visible for half a mile against the
green. Birds we never see other
wise have begun to arrive for the
feasting ..."
Silko shares her grief at losing
a custody battle to which Wright
responds touchingly with a story
about his estranged son. Wright
demonstrates his sensitivity and
deep concern for Silko again when
he writes about her decision to
quit a permanent teaching post.
This sharing deepens the friend
ship between the two writers
while reinforcing their needs to
keep writing.
Their friendship and art is
likened to lace, as Wright notes
in a letter from Verona, Italy:
"Sometimes I wonder about
things like lace, things that
human beings make with their

hands, things that aren't much
help as shelter from the elements
or against war and other kinds of
brutality.
"Lace was obviously no help to
the Belgians during two horrify
ing invasions in this century.
Nonetheless, the art continues to
survive, the craftsmen weaving
away with the finest precision
over their woofs and spools."
Silko would only see Wright
once again, and that was when
he was in the hospital, a month
before he died of cancer.

Early in their correspondence,
Silko writes, "At Laguna, when
someone dies, you don't 'get over
it' by forgetting; you 'get over it*
by remembering." Certainly this
moving collection of letters by two
extraordinary writers from very
different backgrounds and cul
tures is testimony to the power
of memory, and to the Delicacy

So far as is known, the first "written" Amer
ican Indian text was the brief autobiography
of Reverend Samson Occum, a Mohegan, writ
ten in 1768. Of course the term autobiography
would not be invented until 1809 (by the poet
Robert Southey), and since then countless so
called Indian autobiographies have been writ
ten, most notably the "Life of Black Hawk"
(1833) and "Black Elk Speaks" (1934). So
literature by and about American Indians is
nothing new.
What is new, at least relatively so, is that
a growing number of American Indian writers
are producing literature — novels, short
stories, poetry, plays, autobiographies — that
is not mediated by non-Indian writers, as so
much of the previous literature has been, and
does not appear simply to recount historical
events or reveal cultural phenomena.
American Indian writers, like other Amer
ican ethnic minority writers, are now them
selves mediators of differing cultural norms,
examining their lives and the lives of their
families and tribes in terms of a history that
has situated them between two or more cul
tural worlds.
In "House Made of Dawn," N. Scott
Momaday presents a protagonist of mixed her
itage attempting to find his place — his home
— after his return from World War 11. James
Welch, in his novel "Winter in the Blood,"
chronicles the misadventures of a character,
who remains nameless, as he wanders between
his reservation home and a nearby town. Aptly
ironic, this Indian is a cowboy without a horse.
Louise Erdrich burst onto the scene in 1984
with her astonishing novel "Love Medicine,"
the first in a cycle of four books, which opens
with the death of a leggy Chippewa prostitute
by the name of June Morrissey. (Erdrich had
previously published a collection of poetry
entitled "Jacklight.")
In "Love Medicine," Erdrich explores the
conflicts between two Chippewa families on
and around a North Dakota reservation from
1934 to 1984, as various respective family
members, all related or connected to June
Morrissey in some way, recount the ways their
lives intermesh with one another against a
backdrop of poverty and oppression.
Erdrich followed "Love Medicine" with "The
Beet Queen," which is set in the same region
of the country, but focuses principally on the
lives of a non-Indian family in the town of
Argus.
Now in "Tracks," Erdrich's latest book and

the third in her projected series, she returns
to Indian country at a time — between 1912
and 1924 — when the tribe was suffering the
latest assault of deadly disease and struggling
with government agencies and amongst them
selves to keep what little land they had left.
The novel is told in two alternating voices,
two characters with very different responses
to the conditions around them.
"Tracks" opens with Nanapush, an old
smart-mouthed artificer. "We started dying
before the snow, and like the snow, we con
tinued to fall," Nanapush says as he begins
his ploy to dissuade his adopted daughter,
Lulu, from marrying a Morrissey.
Here, in Nanapush's story, we find so much
of what made for the family rivalries in "Love
Medicine" as Nanapush fights to hold the land
the Morrissey family wants to usurp and sell
to the government.
Pauline, the other narrator, is from a family
of mixed blood skinners. She is "a big-nosed
girl with staring eyes" who "blended into the
stained brown walls."
Pauline vacillates between the Chippewa
beliefs and Christianity, and eventually takes
final vows in a convent. Christianity, as she
constructs it during the course of the novel,
serves to appease her guilt for the deaths of
three men while ironically affording her a
sense of power and self-worth in her endless
battle with insignificance.
In a moment of doubt, Pauline thinks, "I
knew God had no foothold or sway in this
land, or no mercy for the just, or that perhaps,
for all my suffering and faith, I was still
insignificant. Which seemed impossible."
Centra] to the lives of both these narrators,

and to the novel, is the character Fleur Pil
lager, the last of the Pillager clan, known for
their mysterious bond to the woods and
Matchimanito Lake.
Fleur becomes the hinge on which both
characters hang their stories, and on which
Erdrich illuminates the different perspectives
on both characters. For Nanapush, Fleur was
kind: "... I was a branch, coming from Kash
paws, that lived long enough to touch the
next tree over, which was Pillagers."
Here Nanpush is not just connected to Fleur
through her daughter, Lulu, but, most im
portantly, in Erdrich's hands, through his af
finity with the land and tradition and his
desire to keep them.
For Pauline, Fleur is by turn a mystery,
and object of jealousy, and finally a soul to
"net" and "baptize."
In "Tracks," Erdrich is more blatantly po
litical than she has been in many of her works,
and she is at times heavy-handed. Nanpush
emerges as the wise elder pleading for the
cause while Pauline, in her attempts to con
trol, becomes a destroyer of self and others.
This comes much at the expense of Fleur,
who never really emerges as a character in
her own right, but appears instead more as
a symbol, say of nature, which one either
follows in her various mysterious ways or
attempts to control.
Yet Erdrich's stories here are as engaging
as ever and make for a novel that renders
brilliantly her Chippewa characters as they
make and live through history. Nanpush says,

of the country, but focuses principally on the
lives of a non-Indian family in the town of
Argus.
Now in "Tracks," Erdrich's latest book and

the third in her projected series, she returns
to Indian country at a time — between 1912
and 1924 — when the tribe was suffering the
latest assault of deadly disease and struggling
with government agencies and amongst them
selves to keep what little land they had left.
The novel is told in two alternating voices,
two characters with very different responses
to the conditions around them.
"Tracks" opens with Nanapush, an old
smart-mouthed artificer. "We started dying
before the snow, and like the snow, we con
tinued to fall," Nanapush says as he begins
his ploy to dissuade his adopted daughter,
Lulu, from marrying a Morrissey.
Here, in Nanapush's story, we find so much
of what made for the family rivalries in "Love
Medicine" as Nanapush fights to hold the land
the Morrissey family wants to usurp and sell
to the government.
Pauline, the other narrator, is from a family
of mixed blood skinners. She is "a big-nosed
girl with staring eyes" who "blended into the
stained brown walls."
Pauline vacillates between the Chippewa
beliefs and Christianity, and eventually takes
final vows in a convent. Christianity, as she
constructs it during the course of the novel,
serves to appease her guilt for the deaths of
three men while ironically affording her a
sense of power and self-worth in her endless
battle with insignificance.
In a moment of doubt, Pauline thinks, "I
knew God had no foothold or sway in this
land, or no mercy for the just, or that perhaps,
for all my suffering and faith, I was still
insignificant. Which seemed impossible."
Centra] to the lives of both these narrators,

and to the novel, is the character Fleur Pil
lager, the last of the Pillager clan, known for
their mysterious bond to the woods and
Matchimanito Lake.
Fleur becomes the hinge on which both
characters hang their stories, and on which
Erdrich illuminates the different perspectives
on both characters. For Nanapush, Fleur was
kind: "... I was a branch, coming from Kash
paws, that lived long enough to touch the
next tree over, which was Pillagers."
Here Nanpush is not just connected to Fleur
through her daughter, Lulu, but, most im
portantly, in Erdrich's hands, through his af
finity with the land and tradition and his
desire to keep them.
For Pauline, Fleur is by turn a mystery,
and object of jealousy, and finally a soul to
"net" and "baptize."
In "Tracks," Erdrich is more blatantly po
litical than she has been in many of her works,
and she is at times heavy-handed. Nanpush
emerges as the wise elder pleading for the
cause while Pauline, in her attempts to con
trol, becomes a destroyer of self and others.
This comes much at the expense of Fleur,
who never really emerges as a character in
her own right, but appears instead more as
a symbol, say of nature, which one either
follows in her various mysterious ways or
attempts to control.
Yet Erdrich's stories here are as engaging
as ever and make for a novel that renders
brilliantly her Chippewa characters as they
make and live through history. Nanpush says,

Of German-American and

.. there is a story to all, never
visible while it is happening. Only

At a very young age, Louise
Erdrich has dreamed and talked,
and sprung clear.

Like Erdrich, fellow American
Indian writer Leslie Marmon
Silko is concerned with a specific
place and the people who inhabit
that place. And like Erdrich, Silko
examines the ways Indian char
acters live out their lives amidst
a given history.
Where Erdrich uses a more con
ventional narrative form in terms
of character development and plot,
however, Silko often experiments
with narrative form, frequently
framing and splicing longer prose
pieces with poetry, myth and
legend.
In "Ceremony," perhaps Silko's
best known work, Silko frames
the story of a young man alienated
from his homeland and drifting
aimlessly with the legend of
Thought-Woman, the spider,
which serves to both thematize
certain aspects of the central story
line and, finally, to comment on
its outcome, the character's cure
by ceremony.
In "Storyteller," a more recent
work, Silko presents a pastiche of
myths, personal recollections,
photographs, and character
sketches to evoke a sense of her
own Laguna Pueblo family and
their relationship to their land
and history.
"The Delicacy and Strength of
Lace" is a collection of letters
covering an 18-month exchange of
mail between Silko and poet
James Wright. They met only
briefly at a writer's conference in
1975, and three years later, after

Wright read "Ceremony," he ini
tiated the exchange of correspond
ence with a flattering letter about
the novel.
As his own work is so concerned
with the sense of immediacy of
place, it is no wonder Wright felt
an attraction to the poetry and
prose of Silko. In one letter he
notes, "I can see, looking through
the works that I have done, that
our discussions of the relation be
tween people and landscapes is
very much at the heart of it."
The content of the letters
quickly moves beyond formal (and
mutual) admiration for one an
other's work and exposes in warm
and evocative ways the concerns
these writers have about their
own lives and art. They share
family problems, observations
about teaching, family anecdotes,
and issues regarding their craft
as writers (Silko was working on
"Storyteller" during this period).
Pervasive throughout the let
ters is that concern about place,
and how one knows a place.
(Wright is moving about in Eu
rope during much of the corre
spondence and Silko is hopping
from university to university
teaching creative writing.)
Silko comes forth particularly
well when she tells stories and
writes of the Arizona landscape:
"It has been hot with only enough
rain to make the air heavy; but
this weather brings out exotic va
rieties of lizards which are larger
than my hand and iridescent
colors — blues and greens .. . the
saguro fruit is ripening and I
think the scarlet pulp is much
more exciting than the white blos
soms — though certainly they are
lovely — but the fruit pods are
visible for half a mile against the
green. Birds we never see other
wise have begun to arrive for the
feasting ..."
Silko shares her grief at losing
a custody battle to which Wright
responds touchingly with a story
about his estranged son. Wright
demonstrates his sensitivity and
deep concern for Silko again when
he writes about her decision to
quit a permanent teaching post.
This sharing deepens the friend
ship between the two writers
while reinforcing their needs to
keep writing.
Their friendship and art is
likened to lace, as Wright notes
in a letter from Verona, Italy:
"Sometimes I wonder about
things like lace, things that
human beings make with their

hands, things that aren't much
help as shelter from the elements
or against war and other kinds of
brutality.
"Lace was obviously no help to
the Belgians during two horrify
ing invasions in this century.
Nonetheless, the art continues to
survive, the craftsmen weaving
away with the finest precision
over their woofs and spools."
Silko would only see Wright
once again, and that was when
he was in the hospital, a month
before he died of cancer.

Early in their correspondence,
Silko writes, "At Laguna, when
someone dies, you don't 'get over
it' by forgetting; you 'get over it*
by remembering." Certainly this
moving collection of letters by two
extraordinary writers from very
different backgrounds and cul
tures is testimony to the power
of memory, and to the Delicacy
and Strength of Lace.

So far as is known, the first "written" Amer
ican Indian text was the brief autobiography
of Reverend Samson Occum, a Mohegan, writ
ten in 1768. Of course the term autobiography
would not be invented until 1809 (by the poet
Robert Southey), and since then countless so
called Indian autobiographies have been writ
ten, most notably the "Life of Black Hawk"
(1833) and "Black Elk Speaks" (1934). So
literature by and about American Indians is
nothing new.
What is new, at least relatively so, is that
a growing number of American Indian writers
are producing literature — novels, short
stories, poetry, plays, autobiographies — that
is not mediated by non-Indian writers, as so
much of the previous literature has been, and
does not appear simply to recount historical
events or reveal cultural phenomena.
American Indian writers, like other Amer
ican ethnic minority writers, are now them
selves mediators of differing cultural norms,
examining their lives and the lives of their
families and tribes in terms of a history that
has situated them between two or more cul
tural worlds.
In "House Made of Dawn," N. Scott
Momaday presents a protagonist of mixed her
itage attempting to find his place — his home
— after his return from World War 11. James
Welch, in his novel "Winter in the Blood,"
chronicles the misadventures of a character,
who remains nameless, as he wanders between
his reservation home and a nearby town. Aptly
ironic, this Indian is a cowboy without a horse.
Louise Erdrich burst onto the scene in 1984
with her astonishing novel "Love Medicine,"
the first in a cycle of four books, which opens
with the death of a leggy Chippewa prostitute
by the name of June Morrissey. (Erdrich had
previously published a collection of poetry
entitled "Jacklight.")
In "Love Medicine," Erdrich explores the
conflicts between two Chippewa families on
and around a North Dakota reservation from
1934 to 1984, as various respective family
members, all related or connected to June
Morrissey in some way, recount the ways their
lives intermesh with one another against a
backdrop of poverty and oppression.
Erdrich followed "Love Medicine" with "The
Beet Queen," which is set in the same region
of the country, but focuses principally on the
lives of a non-Indian family in the town of
Argus.
Now in "Tracks," Erdrich's latest book and

the third in her projected series, she returns
to Indian country at a time — between 1912
and 1924 — when the tribe was suffering the
latest assault of deadly disease and struggling
with government agencies and amongst them

The novel is told in two alternating voices,
two characters with very different responses

Pauline, the other narrator, is from a family

Pauline vacillates between the Chippewa
beliefs and Christianity, and eventually takes
final vows in a convent. Christianity, as she

serves to appease her guilt for the deaths of
three men while ironically affording her a
sense of power and self-worth in her endless
battle with insignificance.
In a moment of doubt, Pauline thinks, "I

writes of the Arizona landscape:
"It has been hot with only enough
rain to make the air heavy; but
this weather brings out exotic va
rieties of lizards which are larger
than my hand and iridescent
colors — blues and greens .. . the
saguro fruit is ripening and I
think the scarlet pulp is much
more exciting than the white blos
soms — though certainly they are
lovely — but the fruit pods are
visible for half a mile against the
green. Birds we never see other
wise have begun to arrive for the
feasting ..."
Silko shares her grief at losing
a custody battle to which Wright
responds touchingly with a story
about his estranged son. Wright
demonstrates his sensitivity and
deep concern for Silko again when
he writes about her decision to
quit a permanent teaching post.
This sharing deepens the friend
ship between the two writers
while reinforcing their needs to
keep writing.
Their friendship and art is
likened to lace, as Wright notes
in a letter from Verona, Italy:
"Sometimes I wonder about
things like lace, things that
human beings make with their

hands, things that aren't much
help as shelter from the elements
or against war and other kinds of
brutality.
"Lace was obviously no help to
the Belgians during two horrify
ing invasions in this century.
Nonetheless, the art continues to
survive, the craftsmen weaving
away with the finest precision
over their woofs and spools."
Silko would only see Wright
once again, and that was when
he was in the hospital, a month
before he died of cancer.

Early in their correspondence,
Silko writes, "At Laguna, when
someone dies, you don't 'get over
it' by forgetting; you 'get over it*
by remembering." Certainly this
moving collection of letters by two
extraordinary writers from very
different backgrounds and cul
tures is testimony to the power
of memory, and to the Delicacy
and Strength of Lace.
