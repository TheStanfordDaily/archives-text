Talk is an old man's last vice. I opened my mouth and
wore out the boy's ears, but that is not my fault. I shouldn't
have been caused to live so long, shown so much of death,
had to squeeze so many stories in the corners of my brain.
They're all attached, and once I start there is no end to telling
because they're hooked from one side to the other, mouth to
tail.
During the year of sickness, when I was the last one left, I
saved myself by starting a story. ... I fainted, lost my breath,
so that I could hardly keep moving my lips. But I did continue
and recovered. I got well by talking. Death could not get a
word in edgewise, grew discouraged and traveled on.'
