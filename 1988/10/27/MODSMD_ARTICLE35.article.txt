Lora Smith, "Revolting Development: Murder in Palo Alto"
(Perseverance Press, $8.95).
If you want to procrastinate, read Lora Smith's "Revolting De
velopment: Murder in Palo Alto." Published by Perseverance Press
in Menlo Park, this is a short, entertaining book that doesn't
require a great amount of thought.
The villainous victim of Smith's mystery is Margery Lomax, the
owner of a successful construction company. Lomax makes
enemies easily when she tears down a number of old Palo Alto
homes and landmarks to build luxury condominiums. Everyone
hates her, including her mousy husband, Fred, who runs off to
have an affair with his secretary, Miss Dart.
After a brief prologue introducing the revolting character of Ms.
Lomax, Bridget Montrose, an upstanding Palo Alto citizen, finds
her dead body face down in a garbage bin — and everyone's
a suspect.
Smith's best moments emerge from her all-to-accurate depiction
of life in the suburban Bay Area. If her characters don't jog, work
in the garden, belong to a club, listen to Morning Edition, or talk
about drugs, they have babies. Readers will also enjoy Smith's
references to University Avenue's punks and transients.
"Murder in Palo Alto" certainly doesn't belong on the shelf next
to the great literary works of the century, or even the decade (or
even this month). When chapter one opens, "The early morning
air was as cold and damp as a child's unwrung washcloth," one
realizes that the narrator must just be having fun. And fun really
is what Smith's book is all about.
Reading "Murder in Palo Alto" is probably not the best use of
your time, but neither is worrying about what you "should" be
reading. If you are in the mood for a quick reading fix, and would
like to snort and chuckle a bit, you might pick up a copy of
Smith's entertaining book.
