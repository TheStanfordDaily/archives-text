## Card drives Mustangs away Kongmebhol's first goal of career is winning margin 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
It wasn't easy, it wasn't pretty,
and it wasn't without its share of
controversy and costs. But it was
a win, and these days the Stanford
men's soccer team will take one
of those any way they can get it.
The Cardinal snapped a two-game
losing streak yesterday, beating
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo 1-0.

Men's Soccer
Cardinal 1, Mustangs 0

The score certainly doesn't
reflect it, but Stanford was by far
the better team and dominated
its Division II opponents. The Car
dinal outshot the Mustangs 29 to
3, with Stanford goalie Chris Hel
ling required to make only one
save in recording his sixth
shutout of the year.
With the victory, the booters go
back to .500 at 9-9.
But it was not easy. 40 minutes
into the game, Stanford had not
been able to score despite many
threats. On the verge of its
seventh consecutive half without
a goal, the Cardinal was con
cerned. Too often it had lost to
weaker opponents because of a
failure to convert.
"If there's one thing I've
learned," senior midfielder Luke
Garrott said, "it's that no matter
how much you dominate the
game, if you don't score you're
still in deep trouble. Then all it
takes is one goal by the other
team to begin the nightmare."
But at that point, Stanford
coach Sam Koch decided to insert

a few fresh faces into the lineup.
In came sophomore forward Wade
Colwell and freshman forward
Bing Kongmebhol. With four
minutes left in the half, Colwell
took a great pass from Chris Porch
and crossed it past the charging
Mustang goalie. Kongmebhol
picked up the loose ball and lofted
it nimbly into the corner of the
goal.

'We were always in
control of the game,
but we knew we had
to score or the other
team would get a
fluke goal and we'd
be down 1-o,'
— Blng Kongmebohl

It vyas the freshman's first goal
of his career, and general sighs
of relief could be heard all around
Maloney Field.
"We were always in control of
the game, but we knew we had
to score or the other team would
get a fluke goal and we'd be down
1-0," Kongmebhol said. "We
definitely tried to get a goal before
the half ended."
But it was not pretty. Cal Poly-
SLO may have gotten the ball
across the center line once or twice
in the second half, but it didn't
seem like it. Stanford was pres
suring heavily, but just could not
seem to get that key shot. Sure,
they had 29 shots, but they missed

28 of them.
"I think we're not satisfied with
the way we finished," sophomore
Evan Nadler said. "We didn't put
the ball in the net like we would
have liked to."
Luckily, a great offensive day
was not necessary. But the Car
dinal nearly shot themselves in
the foot in the second half, as
they did before against Washing
ton and California. A foul kick by
a Stanford fullback to keeper Hel
ling was momentarily mishandled,
and Cal Poly's Bill Collins very
nearly took it away and toward
the open goal.
And there were the costs and
controversies. Midway through
the second half, defensive
mainstay Garrott went down with
an injured nerve in his right leg.
He did not return. As for disputes,
there were several offsides calls
that took away Stanford scoring
opportunities, including a delayed
ruling that nullified Evan Nad
ler's goal.
But the Cardinal won, and Koch
saw some plusses out there.
"We've got some work to do on
the offense, but I was pleased. I
thought it was a good win. I
wasn't concerned as much about
how many goals we scored, but
how we played defensively, and
that we controlled the tempo. \ye
did that, and we didn't get frus
trated when we didn't score ear
ly."
But the team did score, and the
record shows that when the Car
dinal does that, it usually wins.
And winning, after all, is the bot
tom line in any game.

Senior midfielder Kevin Woodhouse and the Cardinal soccer squad broke a two-game losing streak
against Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo yesterday with a 1-0 win.
It wasn't easy, it wasn't pretty,
and it wasn't without its share of
controversy and costs. But it was
a win, and these days the Stanford
men's soccer team will take one
of those any way they can get it.
The Cardinal snapped a two-game
losing streak yesterday, beating
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo 1-0.

Men's Soccer
Cardinal 1, Mustangs 0

The score certainly doesn't
reflect it, but Stanford was by far
the better team and dominated
its Division II opponents. The Car
dinal outshot the Mustangs 29 to
3, with Stanford goalie Chris Hel
ling required to make only one
save in recording his sixth
shutout of the year.
With the victory, the booters go
back to .500 at 9-9.
But it was not easy. 40 minutes
into the game, Stanford had not
been able to score despite many
threats. On the verge of its
seventh consecutive half without
a goal, the Cardinal was con
cerned. Too often it had lost to
weaker opponents because of a
failure to convert.
"If there's one thing I've
learned," senior midfielder Luke
Garrott said, "it's that no matter
how much you dominate the
game, if you don't score you're
still in deep trouble. Then all it
takes is one goal by the other
team to begin the nightmare."
But at that point, Stanford
coach Sam Koch decided to insert

a few fresh faces into the lineup.
In came sophomore forward Wade
Colwell and freshman forward
Bing Kongmebhol. With four
minutes left in the half, Colwell
took a great pass from Chris Porch
and crossed it past the charging
Mustang goalie. Kongmebhol
picked up the loose ball and lofted
it nimbly into the corner of the
goal.

'We were always in
control of the game,
but we knew we had
to score or the other
team would get a
fluke goal and we'd
be down 1-o,'
— Blng Kongmebohl

It vyas the freshman's first goal
of his career, and general sighs
of relief could be heard all around
Maloney Field.
"We were always in control of
the game, but we knew we had
to score or the other team would
get a fluke goal and we'd be down
1-0," Kongmebhol said. "We
definitely tried to get a goal before
the half ended."
But it was not pretty. Cal Poly-
SLO may have gotten the ball
across the center line once or twice
in the second half, but it didn't
seem like it. Stanford was pres
suring heavily, but just could not
seem to get that key shot. Sure,
they had 29 shots, but they missed

28 of them.
"I think we're not satisfied with
the way we finished," sophomore
Evan Nadler said. "We didn't put
the ball in the net like we would
have liked to."
Luckily, a great offensive day
was not necessary. But the Car
dinal nearly shot themselves in
the foot in the second half, as
they did before against Washing
ton and California. A foul kick by
a Stanford fullback to keeper Hel
ling was momentarily mishandled,
and Cal Poly's Bill Collins very
nearly took it away and toward
the open goal.
And there were the costs and
controversies. Midway through
the second half, defensive
mainstay Garrott went down with
an injured nerve in his right leg.
He did not return. As for disputes,
there were several offsides calls
that took away Stanford scoring
opportunities, including a delayed
ruling that nullified Evan Nad
ler's goal.
But the Cardinal won, and Koch
saw some plusses out there.
"We've got some work to do on
the offense, but I was pleased. I
thought it was a good win. I
wasn't concerned as much about
how many goals we scored, but
how we played defensively, and
that we controlled the tempo. \ye
did that, and we didn't get frus
trated when we didn't score ear
ly."
But the team did score, and the
record shows that when the Car
dinal does that, it usually wins.
And winning, after all, is the bot
tom line in any game.
