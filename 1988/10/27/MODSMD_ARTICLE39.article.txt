# Prop 48 is inadequate
## 
### 
As President Kennedy likes to
say about the the divestment
issue, reasonable people can have
reasonable disagreements over
how best to solve tough problems.
Well, I've got to disagree with
Jon Weisman's opinion on
Proposition 48. In his column last
Tuesday, my colleague argued
that despite its flaws, the NCAA's
controversial rule is a fair one
that should be continued.

I don't think so. As it now
stands, Proposition 48 requires
that a scholarship athlete main
tain a 2.0 grade point average in
a total of 11 core courses in high
school and register a score of at
least 700 on the SAT or 15 on
the ACT. If he or she doesn't meet
both standards, the athlete must
sit out his or her freshman year
and lose a year of eligibility.
At first glance, this rule may
seem quite reasonable. Anyone

who plans to graduate from col
lege should probably have reached
those not-so-high plateaus by the
time they begin their freshman
year.
A little more thought, however,
shows Proposition 48 to be a well
intentioned, but misguided piece
of legislation, one which is far
more destructive than construc
tive. Instead of helping the ath
letes, it penalizes them severely
for things that may in some cases
be beyond their control.
And just aS importantly, in prac
tice, although its intention is cer
tainly not racist, Proposition 48's
has an astronomically dispropor
tionate effect on minorities which
cannot simply be brushed aside.
To any major college athlete,
the loss of a year of competition
and practice is an enormous
penalty. While all their competi
tors have four years to polish their
skills and reap the rewards of
sport, the Proposition 48 athlete
has just three.
The NCAA's reasoning behind
that tough policy must be that if
a high school athlete knows the
penalties, he or she will work
harder in school and get the nec
essary grades and test scores.
True enough in theory, I guess,
but in the real world the race to
academic success does not begin

equally, and as the results of
Proposition 48 now show, its
losers are overwhelmingly
minorites from inferior inner-city
high schools.
Of 124 Division I men's basket
ball players sidelined during the
first two years of Proposition 48,
only seven were white. I think
that statistic demands a rethink
ing of what the rule is doing.
Imagine you're the coach of a
college basketball team.
You've got two prospects of more
or less equal talent. One comes
from a nice neighborhood and will
undoubtedly pass the standards.
The other has lived in a ghetto
all his life, grown up in a shoddy
school system that doesn't
produce too many great students,
and may very well be unable to
fufill the Proposition 48 require
ments.
You'll get four years from one
of these athletes and three from
the other, which raises two ques
tions: Who are you going to
recruit? And is that result in line
with the proposition's aim which
is, I assume, to create better ed
ucated student-athletes?
Also imagine the athlete who,
for a lot of reasons, may not have
spent his formative years study
ing. He is admitted to a university,
and then told that he is not smart
enough to do what the university
gave him a scholarship to do. If
a student isn't qualified, why did
the university let him in in the
first place, and why should he be

the one punished for that hypoc
risy?
There's no reason to brand
every Proposition 48 athlete with
a scarlet D for dumb and set them
off to the side for everyone to see.
At a bare minimum, the athletes
ought to be allowed to practice
with their team and given four
years of eligiblity after their fresh
man year is completed. Otherwise,
you've taken a person who is be
hind in the classroom and also
handicapped them in what they
do best, namely their sport.
For those athletes involved with
Proposition 48, the process must
be quite demoralizing and, I
would think, counterproductive to
what the university is trying to
do, namely create educated
people.
Instead of penalizing the ath
lete, the NCAA should encourage
or mandate that universities set
up more supportive systems to
help athletes manage the pressure
of big-time athletics and college
academics. Once a student is ad
mitted to a school, until they fail
to maintain its standards, they
should be free to enjoy all the
privileges of their classmates, be
they athletics or anything else.
It took guts for the NCAA to
confront the problem of athletes
unprepared for college academics.
But a better approach would be
less punitive. It might require
that all Proposition 48 level stu
dents enroll in intensive tutoring
and guidance programs. It might
also require that each university
show that its programs are serious
and constructive.
