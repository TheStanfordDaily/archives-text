# Prop 48 is inadequate
## 
### 
As President Kennedy likes to
say about the the divestment
issue, reasonable people can have
reasonable disagreements over
how best to solve tough problems.
Well, I've got to disagree with
Jon Weisman's opinion on
Proposition 48. In his column last
Tuesday, my colleague argued
that despite its flaws, the NCAA's
controversial rule is a fair one
that should be continued.

I don't think so. As it now
stands, Proposition 48 requires
that a scholarship athlete main
tain a 2.0 grade point average in
a total of 11 core courses in high
school and register a score of at
least 700 on the SAT or 15 on
the ACT. If he or she doesn't meet
both standards, the athlete must
sit out his or her freshman year
and lose a year of eligibility.
At first glance, this rule may
seem quite reasonable. Anyone

who plans to graduate from col
lege should probably have reached
those not-so-high plateaus by the
time they begin their freshman
year.
A little more thought, however,
shows Proposition 48 to be a well
intentioned, but misguided piece
of legislation, one which is far
more destructive than construc
tive. Instead of helping the ath
letes, it penalizes them severely
for things that may in some cases
be beyond their control.
And just aS importantly, in prac
tice, although its intention is cer
tainly not racist, Proposition 48's
has an astronomically dispropor
tionate effect on minorities which
cannot simply be brushed aside.
To any major college athlete,
the loss of a year of competition
and practice is an enormous
penalty. While all their competi
tors have four years to polish their
skills and reap the rewards of
sport, the Proposition 48 athlete
has just three.
The NCAA's reasoning behind
that tough policy must be that if
a high school athlete knows the
penalties, he or she will work
harder in school and get the nec
essary grades and test scores.
True enough in theory, I guess,
but in the real world the race to
academic success does not begin
