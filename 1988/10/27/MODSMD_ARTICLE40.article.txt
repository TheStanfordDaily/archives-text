# Palumbis: not your average'nose'
## 
### TC Hall 
The sports world is full of nick
names: the Gipper, the Yankee
Clipper, and the Four Horsemen
are but a few of the thousands of
names players have been attrib
uted over the years. Stanford
quarterback Jason Palumbis has
a nickname as well, and like most
nicknames it is born from an
aspect of the player that his team
mates easily identify with. Jason
Palumbis' nickname is "Pinoch".
A derogatory insult, right?
Wrong. Before jumping to any
premature conclusions about this
obvious reference to the fairy tale
character, it must be realized that,
like most things about Palumbis,
this too is not what it seems.
"It looks good on him," says an
anonymous female classmate. "I
can't imagine his face without it."
Forget what the teammates say.
As any guy knows, that last quote
is the analysis that really matters.
The nickname then? A joke, plain
and simple. An attempt by a team
to have some fun and laugh a
little. But it is also a statement
of sorts on the man to which it
is attributed — it seems real
serious at first until you take the
time to get to know the humorous
side that lies underneath.
Talk to Palumbis and he will
try to convince you he is -nothing
special. "I'm just a regular guy,"
he says. The kind of guy who has
a girlfriend and likes to go out

with the fellas every now and
then. The fact that he plays foot
ball is really no big deal. As
Palumbis will say, "I've just
grown up with a ball in my
hands".
He is part of a large Greek fam
ily from Oregon and likes to play
the piano every once in awhile.
He feels close to his family and
attributes a lot of his football
skills to the attention his older
brother gave him.
He knows he is important as
the quarterback, but still main
tains he is only one of 11 guys
doing his job. People who know
him say he is polite, courteous,
and nice. In short, he appears to
be normal almost to the point of
being average. Average means
boring, right?
"Yeah, he's boring," said team
mate Henry Green with a laugh.
When he stops laughing though,
Green continues to say that he
thinks of Palumbis as a cross be
tween Joe Piscopo and Joe
Namath. Piscopo for the humor
and Namath for the confidence
and grace under pressure.
Joe Piscopo and Joe Namath?!!
What happened to "regular,
boring guy who happens to be a
quarterback?"
The fact is that Jason Palumbis
is much more complex than his
appearance would let on. Yes, he
is polite and courteous. Yes, he
has a strong family side to him.

Yes, he is all the things listed
above. But what Jason Palumbis
also happens to be is the quarter
back of a Division I football
team. He has to keep 10 other
guys together and get them
downfield to score points. How he
does this is what makes him so
special.
The Joe Namath side: Palumbis
is confident, and he'll say so him
self. He likes pressure and does
not get rattled on the field. Like
Namath, he eryoys taking charge
on the field and throwing the ball.
Above all though, he knows his
job and doe§ it, and expects the
rest of the offense to follow suit.
"He has a lot of poise for such a
young guy," says fifth-year senior
Green.
The Joe Piscopo side: He takes
pressure off his teammates by
joking with them and keeping the
atmosphere in the huddle light.
He plays because he has fun play
ing, and this rubs off on his team
mates. Says Green, "I've never
felt so comfortable on the field
since I got here."
So what is Jason Palumbis?
Well, maybe he is normal in the
fact that he is just a nice, unas
suming type of guy, but you've
got to remember a couple of
things: Namath and Piscopo make
millions of dollars and are well
respected in their fields; and it is
safe to assume that Pinocchio
never won. any football games.
