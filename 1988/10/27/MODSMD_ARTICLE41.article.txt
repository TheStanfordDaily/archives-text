# Women's golf to host nation's finest
## 
### Eugene Sakai Staff writer 
It is fairly standard for
coaches of high-level sports
teams to try to lower expecta
tions whenever possible to
reduce pressure on their players.
But for Stanford women's golf
Coach Tim Baldwin, such prac
tices are unnecessary.
"We've got the best young
team in college golf," Baldwin
said of his squad. With the 25th
Stanford Invitational coming up
this weekend, the team will have
a chance to back up the strong
words of its coach on the friendly
fairways of the Stanford Golf
Course.
Baldwin feels that his team is
quite capable of finishing in the
top five this weekend. That
would be no small achievement,
considering that the team has
three players who will be com
peting in only their second col
legiate tournament against a

field that has six of the top-10
teams in the nation and 11 out
of the top 20.
Included in the field are teams
like Arizona State, which has the
No. 1-ranked womens' amateur
golfer in the world; Tulsa, which
won the NCAA championships
last year and is "at least as good
this year" according to Baldwin;
and Arizona, which dominated
the field in a tournament in
Washington two weeks ago, out
scoring second-place Stanford by
more than 30 strokes.
The Cardinal women boast
some impressive credentials of
their own, beginning with a
recruiting class that is consid
ered to be the best in the nation.
That group is headed by Adele
Moore, the top high school player
in the country last year. Moore,
who is recovering from a broken
ankle that has kept her out of
action for over a year, has re
ceived a special waiver from the
NCAA that will allow her to com

pete with the aid of a golf cart.
Stephanie Davis and Audrey
Wooding round out the trio of
talented freshmen. "(Davis) is
the best player to come out of
the Pacific Northwest in years,"
Baldwin effused.
The lack of talented womens'
golfers at the high school level
means that many of the top
players in the collegiate ranks
come from Europe. It was a real
coup for Baldwin to get three of
America's top junior players to
come to the Farm.
Sophomore Jodi Figley, who
finished 13th in the NCAA tour
nament last year, and junior
Stephanie Parel are the relative
veterans of the squad. They will
round out the Cardinal five.
"Stephanie is much improved
in all areas," said Baldwin, evi
denced by the fact that she led
the Washington tournament for
the first two rounds and finished
an impressive seventh overall.
The Stanford women are cur

rently ranked 19th in the nation,
but Baldwin neither expects nor
wants to rest on those laurels
for long. Using the womens' first
tournament of the year as a
barometer, it would seem that
the Cardinal would have a long
way to go before catching the
likes of Arizona, but Tim
Baldwin feels otherwise.
"I don't think that (the Wild
cats) will be playing any better
toward the end of the season
than they did in Seattle,"
Baldwin said, referring to the
fact that many of the Arizona
golfers competed on the interna
tional amateur circuit this sum
mer. "I think that we'll be up
with Arizona by spring quarter."
The tournament officially
begins Friday, with a practice
round today at the Stanford
course. It should be the Bay
Area's best exhibition of wom
en's golf for many months to
come.
