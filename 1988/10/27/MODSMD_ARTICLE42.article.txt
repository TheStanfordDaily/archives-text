NEW YORK (AP) - Tommy
Lasorda, who led Los Angeles to
the World Series championship
and its sixth National League
West title in 12 years, was named
NL Manager of the Year Wednes
day by the Baseball Writers As
sociation of America.
Lasorda received 101 points in
balloting by a committee of two
writers from each NL city. He had
19 first-place votes and was
named on 23 of 24 ballots. It was
the second time Lasorda was
voted manager of the year as he
won the award in 1983, its initial
year.
Jim Leyland of Pittsburgh was
second with 50 points after
leading the Pirates to an 85-75
record and second place in the
East behind the New York Mets.

Davey Johnson, who led the
Mets to a league-leading 100-60
record and their second Eastern
division title in three years, was
third with 38 points.
Jack McKeon, who took over
the Padres from Larry Bowa on
May 28, was fourth with 27
points. San Diego was 67-48 under
McKeon and had the second-best
record in the league over the final
four months of the season.
Lasorda learned he had won
while flying to Los Angeles after
the Dodgers had been honored
Wednesday at the White House.
"This completes my day — one
of the greatest days of my life,"
he said in a telephone conversa
tion from the plane. "To be
honored by the President of the
United States was a great thrill

and an honor. He honored a team
that captured the hearts of all
America. They knew they were
the underdog. This will be one of
the most memorable days of my
life. Right now, you are definitely
talking to the happiest man in
the world. There isn't a happier
person than me.
"This to me is an organizational
award. As a manager, whatever
success you achieve, whatever
awards you receive, becomes a
reality because of the contribu
tions of your players, your
coaches, your trainers. I want
everyone to share this with me.
"Every time you make a move,
the players have to execute. They
are the guys that win it, not me.
They win it for me — and my
coaches, who worked so hard

having this club prepared, having
this club ready to play. They don't
get the credit they deserve. I want
them to be part of this thing,
share this reward with me."
The Dodgers, who won the West
by seven games, were 94-67 this
year after finishing 73-89 in 1986
and 1987.
Los Angeles is 1,022 874 in
Lasorda's 12 years as manager.
He is third among active manag
ers in victories behind Sparky An
derson of Detroit and Whitey Her
zog of St. Louis, and is 38th on
the all-time list.
Lasorda has been with the
Dodgers for 39 years — 12 as
manager, four as a coach, eight
as a minor-league manager, four
as a scout and 11 as a player,
primarily in the minor leagues.

The over-ebullient Tommy Lasorda saw his antics pay off this year,
as he led a talent-short Dodger team to the World Series crown.
