"At the beach near my house,
I've surfed through the sludge
and found it completely gross,"
said freshman Steve McEwen at
a discussion on dumping wastes
in the oceans Monday night.
McEwen was one of 15 stu
dents who took part in the talk,
which was the second in a
Monday-night series of traveling
environmental discussions.
The series, titled "Did You
Know?", is intended to prepare
students for the annual "You
Can Make A Difference" Con
ference, which will focus on the
environment this year. The con
ference is scheduled for Jan. 27-
29.
The discussions aim to raise
awareness of the different forms
of pollution affecting the world.
Organizers say the series will
"present the facts to Stanford's
students and community before
the policies are discussed at the

conference," said Waseem Noor.
Noor is director of the Stanford
Volunteer Network, which is co
ordinating the series.
The series continues Monday
in the Branner Lounge with a
talk on the depletion of tropical
rain forests. The final discus
sion will be Nov. 21.
Jill Kauffman, a 1986 gradu
ate who studied marine biology,
led Monday's discussion on
ocean pollution. She said the
students who attended were well
informed with the problem.
"Everyone added to the dis
cussion and a lot of information
was contributed by the students
themselves," Kauffman said. "I
was impressed by the concern
the students felt and the in
volvement which they had had
before in these issues."
She added that with over 70
percent of the United States
population living on the coasts,
the polluting of the seas and
inland bodies of water effects a

large number of Stanford stu
dents.
"I worked with Green Peace
in Florida because my neighbor
hood has no clean drinking
water as a result of pollution,"
said freshman Stace Beaulieu at
the discussion. "I wanted to
know how I could get involved
here at Stanford," he said.
Noor said the informal dis
cussions are being led by stu
dents to encourage group
participation. "I hope through
these meetings make it easier
for the students to attend the
conference with a clearer under
standing of the state of the en
vironment. By presenting the
facts before hand, the policies
would be easier to understand
in January."
Greg Cumberford, a director
of the "You Can Make A Dif
ference" Conference, said the
environment is an often
misunderstood issue.
