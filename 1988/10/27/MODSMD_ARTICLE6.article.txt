# Tresidder travel service hit by crime
## American Express defrauded of $13K 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
University Police arrested two people last
week in connection with stealing and spending
an estimated $13,000 of travelers checks from
the Tresidder Memorial Union American Ex
press office.
Police are still looking for a third accomplice,
according to Stanford Police Chief Raoul
Niemeyer.
Tracey Johnson of San Jose and Michael
Lara of Milpitas were arrested, arraigned and
released on their own recognizance. They have
since aided area police in the case, Niemeyer
said yesterday.
Police investigation reported Johnson, an

employee of the Tresidder office for over a
year, furnished the negotiable checks to Benito
Infantino, also of San Jose. Police said at the
time she was involved in a relationship with
Infantino, who used the pseudonym Nick An
tonelli when using the checks.
Infantino and Lara spent some of the checks
during a vacation in Las Vegas last week.
Lara was detained by Las Vegas police for
being a minor in a casino, but Infantino es
caped and has not been seen since, Niemeyer
said.
Police said Infantino was the organizer of
the group. He is described as a muscular,
husky, white male of about 190 lbs. and stand
ing 5-foot-ten. He is believed to drive an older
model Chevrolet painted white over light blue.

When the case report was filed Oct. 13,
police believed that it was "an inside job"
because there was no sign of forced entry
when the checks were discovered missing.
Niemeyer said $10,000 to $11,000 worth of
checks have not been recovered and, if not
found, the loss will have to be absorbed by
American Express. He added he did not know
of a similar crime occurring previously at the
Tresidder office.
Niemeyer said the case appears to be "a
classic example of a drug connection" and
believes some of the money was used to pur
chase narcotics.
An unidentified employee of the Tresidder
office said company policy did not allow her
to comment on Johnson.
