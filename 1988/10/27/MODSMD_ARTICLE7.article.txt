# EIR commissioned on planned building

Stanford has commissioned an
environmental impact report on
the yet-to-be-built Advanced Ma
terials Research Building because
it will house research involving
toxic and hazardous materials.
Woodward-Clyde Consultants
of Oakland is preparing the EIR,
which project manager Lois
Steiner estimates will be com
pleted by late spring.
According to Steiner, the report
will include a risk assessment

based on a "worst-case scenario"
and "a document about protocol
for the handling of materials" in
the building.
The Board of Trustees approved
plans for the $52 million building
on Oct. 10. Construction is sched
uled to be completed in the fall
of 1991.
According to Gerald Ansell,
technical director for the project,
"The safety aspect is of prime im
portance."
The building's plans contain
"all sorts of very advanced safety

precautions," he said, including a
detailed method of transporting
hazardous materials inside the
building. Ansell said toxic sub
stances will be transported
through service corridors separate
from "people corridors."
The three-story building will be
located near the High Energy
Physics Laboratory, Ginzton Ap
plied Physics and the new Parking
Structure 11. It will contain lab
oratories for advanced materials
research, offices for 29 faculty
members and a classroom for up

to 120 students.
The proposal for the new struc
ture originated as part of the Near
West Campus plan, which is an
attempt to rebuild and redefine
the Science and Engineering
Quad.
According to Steiner, the pur
pose of the Advanced Materials
Research Building is "to provide
safe and flexible laboratory space
for that kind of research." She
noted that "present buildings are
fine for current safety codes but
we'd like to upgrade."
