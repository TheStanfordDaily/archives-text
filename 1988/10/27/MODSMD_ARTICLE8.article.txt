Polls show that Campbell, a pro
fessor at the Law School, is
leading Democrat Anna Eshoo in
the race to represent the 12th
Congressional District, which in
cludes Stanford.
"I don't think there is a clearer
issue that distinguishes us (than
the budget deficit)," said Camp
bell.
"If you don't deal with the
budget problem, we will have a
financial economic crisis in this
country similar to the Great De
pression. We need to cut spending
and raise revenues. Anyone who

says we can do it without both of
these is deceiving you," Campbell
said.
"1 am very serious about the
budget deficit," he said. "That is
why I am prepared to cut both
defense and social spending. She
(Eshoo) strongly supports an in
crease in social spending."
Campbell was interviewed live
in the KZSU studio by reporters
Claire Green and Jesse Newcomb
for half an hour on the weekly
radio show. Eshoo was questioned
during last Tuesday's segment.
Campbell, who served in the
Bureau of Competition from
1981-83 and was a White House
Fellow during the Carter Admin
istration, referred repeatedly to
his five-and-one-half years of
federal experience during the
broadcast.
Because of this experience and
despite the fact that he's never
held elective office, Campbell said,
"I will be ready the moment I
arrive. But not Anna Eshoo. Her
experience is on a local level."
Eshoo is currently serving her
second term on the San Mateo

County Board of Supervisors. Es
hoo, who has held her office for
six years, has turned in a balanced
budget every year since 1982.
The Republican candidate used
the broadcast to refute two of Es
hoo's campaign charges: that he
supports Robert Bork, former Su
preme Court nominee, and that
he has proposed to grant
Guaranteed Student Loans only
to students in science, engineering
and languages.
"I certainly do not subscribe to
what was popularly described as
Bork's views," said Campbell, who
testified in Bork's confirmation
hearing before the Senate Judicial
Committee.
"Whether or not Bork got a fair
hearing is a separate question,
and a more relevant one," he said.
Regarding education, Campbell
said, "Money should come from
the state, not the United States,
because the state is not bankrupt
and the federal government is. If
we had new money, and right now
we don't, then the priority should
be science, engineering and lan
guages."
