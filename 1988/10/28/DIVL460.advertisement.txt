Software From Adobe

Higher
Standard
In
Computer Software Technology
A, Adobe, we've never settled
for simply doing what was expected
of us. We've always done more, rising
above the norm. In fact, we've deve
loped a standard of our own. It's a
profound commitment to original
thought and technical freedom. And
our products prove it.
O,
"ur page des
cription language is now the de facto
standard for controlling state-of-the
art laser printers. To date, over 25
manufacturers have made our Post
Script language a part of their print
ers and there are more than 575 soft
ware products that support it. And
our latest product—the "Display
PostScript™ System—extends our
PostScript language into the next
generation of electronic printing and
display systems. Adobe has also deve
loped a sophisticated PostScript
language illustration program, "Adobe
Illustrator® which was recently
awarded the software industry's
coveted "Best Product of the Year"
award. Meanwhile, our Font Deve
lopment Group is aggressively pur
suing additions to our already impres
sive typeface library.
But this is just the beginning.
We won't settle for simply defining
the industry. Again and again, we're
challenging the rules, driving the future
of software technology to a higher
standard. And we know you have
standards and expectations of your
own. If you'd like to be a part of
