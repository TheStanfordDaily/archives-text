"There's almost a religious
quality that Americans place on
Sweden, like Paradise, over
there. Then you come and tell
us that things are not well in
Paradise," Stanford Assoc. Prof.
Myra Strober told Swedish
scholars at a Wednesday night
panel discussion on women's
empowerment in Sweden.
Strober was one of six schol
ars, three of whom were visiting
from Sweden, speaking to a
crowd of 90 people, mostly wom
en, at the Law School.
While the Swedish panelists
noted how Sweden's innovative
programs encourage the em

powerment of women, they ac
knowledged that because gender
divisions are deeply engrained
in society political changes are
difficult to achieve.
Government programs now
available in Sweden include sep
arate taxation of spouses,
parental leave available to both
fathers and mothers and sub
sidized child care.
"You seem to have everything
we want, and less of everything
we don't want: less violence
against women, higher represen
tation of women, less feminiza
tion of poverty, and greater
labor force participation," said
Law Prof. Deborah Rhode, di
rector of the Institute for Re

search on Women and Gender.
However, the Swedish
panelists emphasized the diffi
culties Sweden continues to face.
According to Maud Eduards,
a political scientist at the Uni
versity of Stockholm, Swedish
men continue to have more
power in the country.
Women in Sweden continue
to take more parental leave than
men, women's salary averages
only 70-80 percent of men's and
women remain under
represented in the market eco
nomy, according to Yvonne
Hirdman, professor of women's
studies at the University of Got
henburg.
