# Fac Sen explores private research
## 
### Eric Grunwald Staff writer 
Is Stanford's academic integrity
being compromised by large-scale
research projects conducted on
campus by private companies?
"This University is selling its
soul to private industry," English
Prof. Ron Rebholz charged in a
Faculty Senate debate yesterday.
"It's a logical flaw to say that
just because money is on the
table, the soul of the University
is the other part of the exchange,"
replied University President
Donald Kennedy.
Spurring the debate was a
report from the senate's Commit
tee on Research, which detailed
controversial issues raised by
"proprietary research" — re
search conducted by private com

panies at Stanford.
In one case, cooperative "min
ilabs" would be established be
tween the School of Engineering
and private companies, which pro
vide funding and then conduct re
search on campus. Rebholz said
he feared that University faculty
would be underrepresented in the
proposed minilabs and that re
search would be "skewed" in favor
of private industry.
Other problems with outside
funding were also debated at yes
terday's afternoon meeting.
In one recommendation from its
report, the research committee
advised temporarily accepting
grants from NASA, even though
the money is restricted to U.S.
citizens, and violates Stanford's
policy of non-discrimination
toward foreign researchers.

"(NASA's requirement) is basi
cally a paper policy," said Dean
of Research Robert Byer, dismiss
ing problems with the policy.
ASSU Senate Chair David
Porter, an observer at the meet
ing, rejected that answer after
ward. "If we have a policy (against
discrimination), we should stick
by it," Porter said.
Also, Arthur Bienenstock, a pro
fessor of materials science and di
rector of Stanford Synchrotron
Radiation Laboratory, complained
that many faculty have told him
they "don't have time for re
search."
Kennedy said the problem is not
a conflict with teaching, but
rather the increasing difficulties
in obtaining grants and increased
regulations on research methods.
