# Embassy may be razed
## Reagan says there is 'no choice' in the matter 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Reagan recommended yesterday that the
new U.S. Embassy in Moscow be razed
and rebuilt from the ground up because it
is riddled with listening devices that cannot
be removed.
Reagan told reporters the United States
has "no choice" in the matter "because
there's no way to rid it of the many lis
tening devices that were built into it."
"We're going to start and have an
American-built one," Reagan said of the
embassy.
National security adviser Colin Powell,
during an appearance at the National Press
Club, said "it will be a very expensive
proposition, a very, very difficult task to
put up a building in Moscow."
Powell said U.S. officials would have to
discuss the situation with Soviet officials
and said he was hopeful something could
be worked out "in light of the improving
relations with the Soviet Union."
At the State Department, spokesman
Charles Redman said Reagan will urge
Congress to permit the virtually completed
embassy to be demolished and
reconstructed with American-made compo
nents to be shipped from the United States
and stored in Moscow warehouses under
the tightest possible security. He said the
building will be assembled by U.S. workers
taken to Moscow for that purpose.
The Soviets will not be permitted to move
into their newly built embassy in Wash
ington until the United States can occupy

its facilities in Moscow, Redman said.
He said that tearing down the exi-t
structure and building a new one in d
high security conditions will involve u v
elaborate and costly process."
"Obviously we're talking years, ! >
said.
But he said the final cost cannot
be estimated because entirely new » 112

He said Reagan's proposed deinoli r
and reconstruction plan was recomn end*
by Secretary of State George Shultz 112"!

U.S. experts.
"This option offers the best overall <
lution to the problem," Redman said
He said the rebuilt eight-story • ib -
will occupy the same site but will be lif
ferent than the one recommended 112(
demolition. The new structure v I! ; i

"Every precaution will be taken to assure
the security of the process," Redman s; d
But he repeatedly declined to say ey. i -t l>
what devices the United States had disctn
ered in the new structure or how they had
been installed because "it's never in
anyone's interest to let the other guy know
what you know."
In Moscow, the Soviet news agency TAS ;
said the spying allegations were "groun<
less."
