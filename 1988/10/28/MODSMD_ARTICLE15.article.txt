# Reagan kills whistleblower bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Repub
licans and Democrats cried foul
yesterday after President Reagan,
despite a written pledge of support
from his budget office, said he
would veto a bill that would
protect federal employees who
blow the whistle on government
wrongdoing.
"It's outrageous conduct and
has created a bipartisan explosion,
because it violates the basic un
derstanding we need but now no
longer have ... that an adminis
tration's word is good," said the
chief Senate sponsor of the bill,

Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.
The president said he would
"pocket veto" the bill — let it die
by refusing to sign it while
Congress is out of session.
While the budget office pledged
support for the bill, Attorney Gen
eral Dick Thornburgh, whose ob
jections led to the veto decision,
said the Justice Department had
expressed its concerns about the
legislation to Congress "as re
cently as a week or two ago.
"The constitutional objections
that the Department of Justice
conveyed to President Reagan had

been consistently conveyed to the
Congress throughout the course
of consideration of this bill,"
Thornburgh told reporters.
But on Oct. 3, Joseph Wright
Jr., deputy director of the Office
of Management and Budget, wrote
Rep. Frank Horton, R-N.Y., and
chief House sponsor, Rep. Patricia
Schroeder, D-Colo.
"I would like to congratulate
you on the fine work you have
done over the last eight months
to develop the 'Whistleblower
Protection Act of 1988,'" Wright
wrote Horton.
