TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras
(AP) — The nation's 60,000 strik
ing public employees defied a
presidential back-to-work order
yesterday, workers at U.S.-owned
banana plantations began a sym
pathy walkout and students
boycotted classes.
President Jose Azcona Hoyo
declared the strike illegal and of
fered the workers better benefits,
which they turned down. It is the
first nationwide strike by public
employees in this Central Ameri
can country of 5 million people.
Soldiers guarded closed govern
ment offices but the military said
it would not use force against the
workers, who began the strike

Wednesday.
Government hospitals were
closed and only about 40 percent
of buses and taxis were operating.
Secondary school and university
students cut classes and 8,000
workers stayed away from their
jobs at two banana plantations
owned by the United Brands fruit
company.
Azcona ordered the strikers
back to work after an emergency
Cabinet meeting. The Association
of Public Employees said Azcona's
offer was inadequate. Association
president Carlos Obdulio Chevez
told reporters the strike would
continue until all union demands
were met.

The workers want raises, paid
vacations, job security, Christmas
bonuses and an extra month's pay
every year. The union has not
said how large the raises should
be for its members, who now are
paid an average $500 a month.
In order to meet the strikers'
demands, Montoya said, Hon
duras would have to devalue its
currency, levy new taxes, accept
higher inflation and get a loan
from the International Monetary
Fund.
The United States has more
than 1,000 soldiers stationed in
Honduras, a staunch ally and
recipient of substantial U.S. mil
itary aid.
