Experts decry Bush penmanship
SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) — Vice President
George Bush has had all sorts of trouble with
dreaded "W" words.
First, critics said the Republican presidential
nominee was too wealthy. Then they said he was
a wimp. Now, third-graders at a Springfield
elementary school say his writing is "weird."
Judy McCune's class at Rountree Elementary
School says Bush holds his pen the wrong way
and sent him a letter Wednesday to help him fix
the problem.
The letter read in part:
"We are learning cursive writing. We are trying
to hold our pencils right. . . . We saw you holding
your pencil wrong on TV during the debate .. .
We hope you can break your bad habit."
The class also sent Bush a diagram showing
left-handed writers the correct position of the
hand and how to place paper at the proper angle.
Levi Dreier, the only left-hander in the class,

said he would tell Bush that his writing is sloppy.
"I'd tell him to try harder, not to hold your
pencil weird," he said.
