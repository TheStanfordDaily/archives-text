# No contract in sight Progress slow as talks enter final weekend

The United Stanford Workers will rec
ommend its members strike Monday if the
University makes no substantial movement
in the final stretch of contract negotiations
this weekend, the USW's chief negotiator
said yesterday.
"How can we possibly recommend any
thing but a strike?" USW chief negotiator
Mary Mocine asked last night after a ne
gotiation session. "Their proposal attack
our very existence."
"We'll do whatever it takes to get a settle
ment by Sunday," University negotiator Mi
chael Vartain said. "It's difficult to
predict."
Echoing Vartain, University President
Donald Kennedy told the Faculty Senate
yesterday,"It is very difficult to tell if an
agreement will be reached" before Monday.
However, Kennedy added, "We've made
considerable progress in the last 48 hours.
We hope progress will continue to move
fast."
Last week the union set a deadline of
Oct. 31 for a new contract. A membership
meeting will occur at noon Monday in Dink
elspiel Auditorium, where the members will
vote, in a secret ballot, to either ratify a
new contract or strike.
If the members vote to strike, the strike

will begin midnight Oct. 31. The union
may also vote to extend the strike deadline,
as it did in 1985, if progress is substantial
before Monday.
The USW represents more than 1,200
technical, service and maintenance workers
on campus, at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center and at the Medical Center.
The previous three-year contract expired
Aug. 31.
Since Oct. 10, seven bargaining sessions
have been held in the presence of Commis
sioner Maggie Jacobsen from the Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Service. Both
sides agree that some progress has been
made with Jacobsen's help.
"We have made some progress on the
minor issues, (but) none of the mqjor issues
have been resolved," Vartain said.
Those issues include the wage-increase
plan, the workers' pension plan, union dues
and the University's freedom to contract
work to outside companies.
Even with the mediator, the union is
frustrated and disappointed by what it calls
the University's unwillingness to move.
University attacks on union security and
the contracting language are proposals that
most threaten the union, Mocine said.
The University currently has a proposal
that gives employees who are not union
