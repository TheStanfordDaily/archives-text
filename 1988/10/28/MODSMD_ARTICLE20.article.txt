## A 						common ground 
### 
Time is running out
for the University and
the USW to settle

SETTLE IT NOW.
Monday is do-or-die day for
negotiations between the
University and the United Stan
ford Workers.
The union has said members will
strike if the two sides do not agree
to a new contract by midnight of
Oct. 31.
While negotiations might drag
into the wee hours of Monday
night, the two groups must do
everything within their power to
avoid a strike. Tug at the hair,
bite off the nails, yell and scream
... but reach an agreement.
With a federal mediator now in
tervening, negotiations should be
running more smoothly.
Last week, the union's lawyer
said the two sides had reached an
agreement over health and safety
issues, job-classification questions
and minor language disputes.
However, other major negotiat
ing issues — which deserve serious
thought and consideration — are
still up in the air. The two sides
have yet to reach an agreement on
employees' salaries, pension plans,
job security and benefits.
Enough is enough. This year's
contract talks are now 93 days old.
On Aug. 31, the union's contract
expired and since then, union
members have been working with

out a contract.
Nobody wins when there's a
strike.
Furthermore, the University
cannot run smoothly without
trained, experienced help. Conse
quently, the entire Stanford com
munity pays the price.
The two sides must avoid the
ugly scenario of 1982 — when the
union struck for 30 days. The
strike disrupted day-to-day life,
posing many inconveniences.
During the month-long strike,
University Food Service basically
shut down, forcing students to fend
for themselves and find their own
food. Stanford police had to work
unreasonably long 12-hour shifts.
And construction projects were
halted.
The '82 strike caused problems
within the union itself. One-third
of the workers crossed the picket
line.
If a strike were to occur this
year, the possible scenario could
be just as bleak.
According to a union represen
tative, problems could arise with
the campus phone system, since
technicians and Stanford operators
would be out striking. The con
struction and renovation work now
progressing at Tresidder Union
and the golf course would come to
an abrupt halt. And University
Food Service would again shut
down if a strike were to occur.
Settling on an agreement that is
fair and satisfies both sides is a
difficult task. But the University
and the union must come to terms
with this situation and make peace.
