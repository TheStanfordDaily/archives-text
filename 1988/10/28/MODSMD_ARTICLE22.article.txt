## Getting down and dirty 
### 
READ MY LIPS. Negative cam
paigning works. The Democrats
started it; the Republicans esc
alated. According to one recent poll, two
thirds of likely voters now dislike both
presidential choices.
It all began back in August. Thralls of
political pinhead Lyndon Laßouche in
filtrated the halls of Atlanta hotels where
the Democratic convention delegates
slumbered, secure in the knowledge of
their then-hefty lead over the GOP.
The Laßouchies slipped leaflets under
the delegates' doors. These papers com
pared Michael Dukakis with Tommy
Eagleton, the Democrats' first choice for
VP in 1972, who was dumped when his
history of psychiatric treatment was
revealed. Rumors exploded about Duka
kis' depression following the death of his
imbalanced brother and following his
defeat for re-election as Governor.
The story — Is Mike a Recovering
Kook? — played for about 10 days and
then blew under.
The Democrats themselves, perhaps
suspecting that the Bush machine helped
fuel that rumor mill, broadsided the Vice
president time and again in Convention
speeches. Keynoter Anne Richards
cackled, "Poor George. He can't help it.
He was born with a silver foot in his
mouth."
Then came Teddy Kennedy and his in
famous "Where was George?" crowd
pleaser. An apt question, this, but a
wholly inappropriate questioner. Golly,
Ted, where were you? George was at
home with his wife, dry and sober. But
that's water under the bridge.

So the Democrats started 1988's nega
tive campaign. Mildly. Cutely. But start
it they did. Result? Immediate post
convention polls gave the Dukakis-
Bentsen ticket as a 17-point margin.
When the not-so-august August Dem
ocrats threw their watered-down mud at
George Bush, the GOP had two options.
They could take the high road by sticking
to those cute spots showing Bush hugging
his grandkids and cooking spaghetti. Or
they could wade right down into the
sewer with the Democrats. Trailing badly,
they did not have to think too long.
Enter Roger Ailes, Bush's Falstaffian
mud man of advertising. Ailes and com
pany put together some brilliant swipes
on Dukakis, many of which are still
airing. With these ads and some slams
from the stump, the Bush campaign told
us: this little Greek geek will destroy
patriotism, pollute the nation's water, let
the murderers and rapists run rampant,
raise taxes and kill economic growth, let
the nation's defense collapse and ride
around in a tank. This was deceptive
bovine residue, mostly.
But it worked. Bush is ahead by 13
points among likely voters, and his vector
is up.
Not to be outdone in the effluvia pro
duction game, the Democrats have re
cently charged the GOP with running a
racist campaign. They point to Bush cam
paign flyers and TV spots featuring the
case of Willie Horton, a black convict
who, while on furlough, raped a white
woman and stabbed her white fiance.
But no authorized Bush materials even
picture Horton, let alone mention his race

(although flyers in Illinois and New York,
produced by state GOPers with no say-so
by Bush, do display a distinctly menacing
mugshot).
Why, if the Bush materials were racist,
did the Democrats wait over a month to
denounce them as such? See, the Dukakis
team just wasn't 13 points behind back
when these particular Bush materials ap
peared. But when they saw this week's
polls, well, Hallelujah!, they saw the light.
The GOP was running a racist campaign.
Yeah, that's the ticket.
1988 has set a new, well, high in nega
tive campaigning. Voters say they hate
it, but it commands their attention and
sways their opinions nonetheless. The
media doesn't grant much airtime to Du
kakis education policy proposals or Bush
statements on foreign affairs. What they
air, and what most of us watch, are the
mudslinging and the insult soundbites.
Bite after bite, mixed with mud. Duke
a la Harangue, Bush McNuggets, or
Quayle under Glass. Perhaps in four
years this place can come up with a better
menu. Until then, bon appetit.
