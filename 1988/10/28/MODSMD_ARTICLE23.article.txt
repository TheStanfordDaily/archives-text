## Senate decision not to pay for Calero was justified 
### 
THIS LETTER is written in re
sponse to the recent attacks on
the ASSU Senate by The Daily
and Sen. Brian Fagel — due to the
senate's recent decision not to allocate
student funds to bring Adolfo Calero,
leader of the Contras, to Stanford.
Contrary to the editorial (The Daily,
Oct. 26), the decision not to allocate
student funds was not made because of
Calero's views. The funds were witheld
because the senate recognized that it is
inappropriate to designate student
funds to be given, in effect, to the
Contras — an organiztion that sup
ports terrorist activities.
This is not an issue of free speech,
or freedom of discussion. The issue is
the ASSU Senate's ability to recognize
its commitment to students. The point
was explicitly made during the senate

meeting that Calero is welcome to
come as long as it does not require the
use of ASSU funds to bring him here.
In addition, we would support a
renowned expert, separate from the
Contras themselves, coming to speak in
support of the Contras. By witholding
student funds from the leader of a
recognized terrorist group, senators
chose to act as responsible student
representatives.
The Daily is correct in saying that
the Speaker's Bureau should not only
invite speakers' who express opinions
shared by senators. Instead they should
strive for balanced programs especially
when a controversial topic is discussed.
An issue at the senate meeting that
both Sen. Fagel and The Daily ne
glected to mention was the fact that,
as a rule, the Speakers' Bureau, when

presenting a controversial issue or
speaker, presents both sides of the
issue — not just one viewpoint.
However, since members of the
Nicaraguan government are not allowed
U.S. visas, there is no one of compara
ble status and authority to debate
Calero.
To use any other speaker would
provide a weakly-balanced program at
best, and at worst, a total dema
goguery of adverse opinions. Thus the
senate addresses Sen. Fagel's cry for a
"balanced education."
In voting to withold allocation of
student funds, senators were not at
tempting to promote their personal
political beliefs or to stifle those of
others. It was made clear that repre
sentatives of Calero's viewpoint would
be welcome to express their beliefs at

Stanford.
Sen. Fagel's "leftist", "extremists"
comments are not only unfounded and
unjustified, but they are dangerous.
They cloud the real issue at hand —
whether to give student funds to the
leader of an internationally recognized
terrorist regime.
Yes, The Daily is correct in pointing
out, Stanford is indeed a university
committed to its students. And the
ASSU Senate is a body designated by
the University and elected by the
student body to administer productive
programs for the student body.
The senate has done its job in recog
nizing that a lopsided program is not
productive.
