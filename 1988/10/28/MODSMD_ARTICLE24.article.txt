# University should stop using rhetoric and enforce rules
## 
### 
As a Stanford student and a resident
assistant, I should have immediately
known that something was wrong with
my gut level feeling upon hearing of
the incident that took place at Ujamaa
House last week. I felt that while
there would be letters to The Daily
and programs by Residential Education,
nothing of any substance would be
done.
Since that time, I have waited to see
what actions, other than speeches and
quotations taken from the Fundamen
tal Standard, would be taken. Appar
ently, no action will be taken until the
investigation is completed.
I do not have a problem with this,
as I understand that everyone has a

right to be judged innocent until
proven guilty.
What I do have a problem with,
however, is the precedent the Univer
sity has set of not following through
with its espoused policies concerning
the Fundamental Standard and, more
importantly, the Residence Agreement.
The Residence Agreement states that
students living in campus residences
must "be considerate of other residents
and the residence staff and to respect
the rights of others at all times.
Breach of University residence policies
or conduct in violatiion of the rights of
others is grounds for immediate ter
mination of your occupancy and/or
withdrawal of future University
housing privileges."
As evidence that the University does
not follow through with this policy, I
would like to cite the case of the Otero
House freshman who, last year, ver
bally abused his homosexual RAin a
bigoted manner. This, along with other

aspects of his behavior, are direct vio
lations of the Residence Agreement.
In spite of this fact, he is now living
in campus housing, and a University
official informed me that no discipli
nary measures will be taken.
This is not the only story of this
kind that I have seen in my last four
years here. This leads me to wonder
whether or not we will just be hearing
a lot of rhetoric from the University
until all this blows over, without any
disciplinary action ever taking place.
I would like to see the University
show us that they truly believe in the
policies they set through actions, and
not through pacifying speeches.
It may appear that I am simply
looking for a scapegoat; this is not
true. The Stanford community needs
to see that the University follows
through with its policies and that it
truly believes in the ideals it preaches.
