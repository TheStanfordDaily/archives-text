## Party with Plato 
### 
One of the biggest problems
with the Great Books — other
than the fact that they don't
have any pictures — is that
they are horribly out of date.
Thus, we are previewing today
a new series of the Great Books
which have been translated or
updated by contemporary au
thors:
"The Bible: Genesis," trans
lated and updated by Bret Eas
ton Ellis
God creates the heavens and
the Earth. He sees that it is
good. I pick Him up at eight
and we go over to Julian's
where he is having a "Congrat
ulations on creating the world"
party. Blair is there. She asks
God to create woman in her
image, but He laughs at her,
winking through His Vuarnets.
I score a gram of coke from
Clay and cut a few lines. The
only light in the room is coming
from the television where MTV
is playing; I'm trying to see
what I am doing. God stumbles
over from across the room
where he has been trying to
make it with an old girlfriend.
"Let there be light," He says,
and there is light. He sees that
it is good. MTV seems to be
playing louder now. I do the
first line of coke and God does
two more. We are feeling really
high now, really good. Ozzy Os
bourne comes onto the televi
sion. God creates man in Oz
zy's image. We both laugh and
try to dance.
Plato's "Republic," translated
and updated by Ernest Hem
mingway
"How can one decide what
is justice?" the man asked.
"I don't know," said the girl.
"You never did."
The wind blew over the hills.
The clouds made a shadow on
the hillside.
"You must not have an
oligarchy." The man took a
drink of his beer. "Would you
like another beer?"
The woman nodded.
"Una cerveza," the man said
to the waitress.

The girl looked at the man.
"You speak Spanish."
"Of course."
"But this is ancient Greece."
The man shrugged. "You're
trying to change the subject,
aren't you?"
"I don't know."
"Would you like to go fish
ing?" The man smiled.
"Madame Bovary," a Harle
quin Romance Special Edition
Charles pulled Emma down
with him onto the silky
bedspread that covered his soft
mattress. He kissed her
forehead, her cheeks, her
throat, behind her ears, the
little space between her nose
and her lip and that space
where your chin has a little
dimple that's hard to shave if
you're a guy, but not in her
case 'cause she's not a guy.
Emma moaned. "I want
you."
Charles kissed her full on the
lips and could feel her body go
limp. A fire burned within her
loins, soon spreading to his
loins and then the loins of
several neighboring communi
ties.
She could feel his hot breath
and the fullness of his male
ness. He tried to feel the full
ness of her femaleness, but
femaleness tends to be more of
a nebulous concept, at least in
these novels. The smell of smol
dering loins was everywhere.
"Be gentle," she whispered,
"I've never been with a man
before."
"What about page 119?"


Tips on Adulthood

"That doesn't count." She
kissed him.
"Romeo and Juliet," updated by
Jay Mclnerney
This is not a place you would
ordinarily be. Standing like this
under the damned trellis waiting
for your woman to come out and
acknowledge your existence. You
wait for a while, but she doesn't
come. You wish you could score
some coke, but Bret Easton Ellis
is hogging it all in his stories. You
wonder who cast Michael J. Fox
in the movie. He's too damned
cute.
One a.m. You think you hear
something.
"Oh Romeo, oh Romeo.
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?"
You hear Juliet, but she's
talking really funny. It must be
all the drugs she's taking. You
wish she hadn't gone to Julian's
"Congratulations on creating the
world" party. You weren't invited
because you speak in the second
person.
"Oh Romeo, oh Romeo.
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?" You
hear it again. You have a sneaking
suspicion that both of you are
going to end up dead in a few
pages. There goes the sequel, you
think.
