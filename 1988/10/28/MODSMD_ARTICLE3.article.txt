# Kennedy: Demands will be considered
## 
### Eric Young: Senior staff writer 
University President Donald
Kennedy responded yesterday to
a student minority coalition's de
mands calling for improvement in
minority life here, but some stu
dent leaders said they were un
impressed with Kennedy's state
ment that the demands will be
handled through separate faculty
and administrative channels, not
his office.
In his seven-paragraph state
ment released to The Daily, Ken
nedy wrote, "We will try to ap-
E roach these (minority concerns)
y involving those parts of the
institution to which they actually

apply: trustees, deans of schools
and faculty committees."
Members of the recently-formed
Students of Color Coalition, a
reincarnation of earlier minority
coalitions, were unmoved, saying
Kennedy avoided the question of
what he will do to combat racism
here.
BSU Chair Mary Dillard, who
nailed the demands to Kennedy's
office door Wednesday following
a White Plaza rally, said, "I'm
looking for concrete suggestions
and solutions."
The list of nine immediate de
mands included: a requirement
that students take ethnic studies
courses; that racism be deemed
an explicit violation of the Fun-

damental Standard; that the Uni
versity hire full-time deans for the
ethnic centers; and that it elimi
nate Ujamaa's requirement that
no more than half the house res
idents be black.
Council of Presidents member
Miguel M&rquez said Kennedy
could accelerate implementation
of the coalition's demands. "He
makes a large difference if he says
he wants something done."
But Kennedy said his responsi
bilities are to oversee and keep
track of all efforts for change.
In a telephone interview yester
day, he added, "What some stu
dents fail to realize its that to make
(changes) stick we have to work
through the bodies (that are) re

sponsible."
Dillard said the response lacked
immediacy because "it sounds like
what the president is supposed to
say. ... He says vague and general
things because he thinks he has
to."
Kennedy said he has no imme
diate plans to meet with campus
minority groups to discuss the de
mands. However, he met yester
day with members of the COP to
discuss the demands.
M&rquez, who attended the
meeting, said the COP wanted
specific yes or no answers to all
of the coalition demands. The
COP is not officially part of the
coalition, although some members
are working on its behalf.
