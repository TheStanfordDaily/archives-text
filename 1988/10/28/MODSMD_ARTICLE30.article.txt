# Thanks to Hoover, art shows post-war aid
## 
### Chris Owen 
Working on his premise that
"There are no enemies among
children," Herbert Hoover made
himself the friend of many young
Germans after World War 11.
As director of the Famine
Emergency Relief Committee,
Hoover became the masthead of
the program that fed millions of
children in schools throughout
war-ravaged Europe.
As thanks for the food and
other relief products, many school
children sent Hoover paintings
and letters; these are now the sub
ject of a current exhibit in the
lobby of Hoover Memorial Tower.
Susan Wyle, a lecturer in the
English department, organized
the exhibit with the help of Hoo
ver archivist Elena Danielson. In
the process, she found matter for
a forthcoming book and uncovered
a personal connection to the post
war aid program. Wyle discovered
that her step-mother, who was
born and raised in Germany, had
benefited as a child from the
American relief effort.
The exhibition includes letters
and paintings expressing
children's gratitude for the Amer
ican support. Many children ad
dressed their letters to "Uncle
Hoover" and referred to events in
Hoover's life.
In 1946, President Harry
Truman named Hoover the coor
dinator of the Famine Emergency
Committee. Hoover was qualified
for the job. He had already been
President, Secretary of Com
merce, and Food Administrator.
Aside from his more celebrated
accomplishments in the political
scene, by 1946 he had chaired
relief committees for Europe after
World War I, for the Soviet Union
after the Russian Revolution, and
for the small democracies during
World War 11.
At age 71, Hoover vigorously
assumed his new duties. Accord
ing to Danielson, "he traveled
over 50,000 miles to 38 countries
to study conditions and food sup
plies in 1946."
As Hoover reported to President
Truman in his proposal for the
relief program, providing for the
welfare of occupied Germany
served the United States' best in
terests, both for humanitarian

and more prudent, less altruistic
reasons.
"If we want peace; if we want
to preserve the safety and health
of our Army of Occupation; if we
want to save the expense of even
larger military forces to preserve
order; if we want to reduce the
size and expense of our Army of
Occupation — I can see no other
course but to meet the burdens
[providing food and economic
relief) I have outlined here."
Hoover made use of surplus
American army rations to provide
for the relief effort in Germany.
With his frequent visits to the
devastated country, Hoover be
came a symbol of generosity to
the 3.5 million children, aged six
to 16, who benefited from the
Hoover Speisung, or school
feeding, as the program became
known.
The schoolchildrens' paintings
depict three major themes: the
distribution and preparation of
food in the German schools, the
growth of food in the United
States and the transportation of
food across the ocean.
One for example, depicts two
children sharing soup in front of
a row of bombed-out buildings,
illustrating the bittersweetness of
the situation. Another shows an
American and a German ship
leaving a harbor framed by
skyscrapers, heading out to
deliver food to German school
children.
Another piece recreates
Goethe's poem "Sorcerer's Ap
prentice," with overflowing food
replacing the free flowing water
of the original poem; army rations
of Hershey bars and Life Savers
frame the picture and text.
One letter poignantly, simply
captures the message of most
schoolchildrens' correspondence.
"Thank you Mr. Hoover for all
the fine things. . . . Sometimes we
wish we were American children,
because they have so many good
things to eat. But we hope that
no Hitler will ever come again,
and that there will be no more
war, so that we too will have choc
olate again."
Other letters more tellingly
reveal the deprivation of that pe
riod, and the dependency of many
German schoolchildren on the
American relief programs. "I

don't have any shoes, now I al
ways go barefoot. Please, please
dear Uncle Hoover, could you per
haps get me a pair of shoes?"
Even with the American relief
effort, schoolchildren frequently
did not have more than one solid
meal a day. One child writes,
"Please, do not think me insolent,
but we are often still hungry when
we go to bed."
Most children, however, merely
expressed their gratitude. "I am
inexpressibly thankful to you for
the precious school eating," one
reads.
President Hoover received the
artwork currently on display from
1947 through 1949, at which point
the best of the schoolchildren's art
was collected in an exhibit in Stut
tgart, West Germany.
After this, the artworks and let
ters remained in the Hoover In
stitution archives until 1960,
when Hoover himself requested
that many be transferred to the
Hoover Presidential Library in
West Branch, lowa. Many of the
pictures are still held in lowa, and
this is the first exhibit at the
Institution.

Wyle first learned of the
children's art work while leading
her freshman English class
through the collections of the
Hoover archives in search of pri
mary documents. Wyle's previous
interest in children's literature
and art led her to pursue the
works from the post-World War
II children's relief project.
In addition to satisfying her
personal curiousity, Wyle recog
nized a need "to get this art and
history accessible to people."
Beyond the current exhibit,
Wyle intends to write a book focus
ing on the artworks and letters,
and explaining the history of
American famine relief in Ger
many after World War 11. She
plans to try to find and interview
some of the former schoolchildren
for her book.
In addition, Wyle said she hopes
to make posters and cards of some
of the paintings, with proceeds
going entirely to the child feeding
programs sponsored by the Save
the-Children Fund and UNICEF,
which Hoover helped to establish.
The exhibition is free and will
continue through November.

German children head off to school with lunch buckets provided
by the American Famine Emergency Relief program coordinated
by Herbert Hoover after World War 11. The picture is part of a
current exhibit at the Hoover Institution.
Working on his premise that
"There are no enemies among
children," Herbert Hoover made
himself the friend of many young
Germans after World War 11.
As director of the Famine
Emergency Relief Committee,
Hoover became the masthead of
the program that fed millions of
children in schools throughout
war-ravaged Europe.
As thanks for the food and
other relief products, many school
children sent Hoover paintings
and letters; these are now the sub
ject of a current exhibit in the
lobby of Hoover Memorial Tower.
Susan Wyle, a lecturer in the
English department, organized
the exhibit with the help of Hoo
ver archivist Elena Danielson. In
the process, she found matter for
a forthcoming book and uncovered
a personal connection to the post
war aid program. Wyle discovered
that her step-mother, who was
born and raised in Germany, had
benefited as a child from the
American relief effort.
The exhibition includes letters
and paintings expressing
children's gratitude for the Amer
ican support. Many children ad
dressed their letters to "Uncle
Hoover" and referred to events in
Hoover's life.
In 1946, President Harry
Truman named Hoover the coor
dinator of the Famine Emergency
Committee. Hoover was qualified
for the job. He had already been
President, Secretary of Com
merce, and Food Administrator.
Aside from his more celebrated
accomplishments in the political
scene, by 1946 he had chaired
relief committees for Europe after
World War I, for the Soviet Union
after the Russian Revolution, and
for the small democracies during
World War 11.
At age 71, Hoover vigorously
assumed his new duties. Accord
ing to Danielson, "he traveled
over 50,000 miles to 38 countries
to study conditions and food sup
plies in 1946."
As Hoover reported to President
Truman in his proposal for the
relief program, providing for the
welfare of occupied Germany
served the United States' best in
terests, both for humanitarian

and more prudent, less altruistic
reasons.
"If we want peace; if we want
to preserve the safety and health
of our Army of Occupation; if we
want to save the expense of even
larger military forces to preserve
order; if we want to reduce the
size and expense of our Army of
Occupation — I can see no other
course but to meet the burdens
[providing food and economic
relief) I have outlined here."
Hoover made use of surplus
American army rations to provide
for the relief effort in Germany.
With his frequent visits to the
devastated country, Hoover be
came a symbol of generosity to
the 3.5 million children, aged six
to 16, who benefited from the
Hoover Speisung, or school
feeding, as the program became
known.
The schoolchildrens' paintings
depict three major themes: the
distribution and preparation of
food in the German schools, the
growth of food in the United
States and the transportation of
food across the ocean.
One for example, depicts two
children sharing soup in front of
a row of bombed-out buildings,
illustrating the bittersweetness of
the situation. Another shows an
American and a German ship
leaving a harbor framed by
skyscrapers, heading out to
deliver food to German school
children.
Another piece recreates
Goethe's poem "Sorcerer's Ap
prentice," with overflowing food
replacing the free flowing water
of the original poem; army rations
of Hershey bars and Life Savers
frame the picture and text.
One letter poignantly, simply
captures the message of most
schoolchildrens' correspondence.
"Thank you Mr. Hoover for all
the fine things. . . . Sometimes we
wish we were American children,
because they have so many good
things to eat. But we hope that
no Hitler will ever come again,
and that there will be no more
war, so that we too will have choc
olate again."
Other letters more tellingly
reveal the deprivation of that pe
riod, and the dependency of many
German schoolchildren on the
American relief programs. "I

don't have any shoes, now I al
ways go barefoot. Please, please
dear Uncle Hoover, could you per
haps get me a pair of shoes?"
Even with the American relief
effort, schoolchildren frequently
did not have more than one solid
meal a day. One child writes,
"Please, do not think me insolent,
but we are often still hungry when
we go to bed."
Most children, however, merely
expressed their gratitude. "I am
inexpressibly thankful to you for
the precious school eating," one
reads.
President Hoover received the
artwork currently on display from
1947 through 1949, at which point
the best of the schoolchildren's art
was collected in an exhibit in Stut
tgart, West Germany.
After this, the artworks and let
ters remained in the Hoover In
stitution archives until 1960,
when Hoover himself requested
that many be transferred to the
Hoover Presidential Library in
West Branch, lowa. Many of the
pictures are still held in lowa, and
this is the first exhibit at the
Institution.

Wyle first learned of the
children's art work while leading
her freshman English class
through the collections of the
Hoover archives in search of pri
mary documents. Wyle's previous
interest in children's literature
and art led her to pursue the
works from the post-World War
II children's relief project.
In addition to satisfying her
personal curiousity, Wyle recog
nized a need "to get this art and
history accessible to people."
Beyond the current exhibit,
Wyle intends to write a book focus
ing on the artworks and letters,
and explaining the history of
American famine relief in Ger
many after World War 11. She
plans to try to find and interview
some of the former schoolchildren
for her book.
In addition, Wyle said she hopes
to make posters and cards of some
of the paintings, with proceeds
going entirely to the child feeding
programs sponsored by the Save
the-Children Fund and UNICEF,
which Hoover helped to establish.
The exhibition is free and will
continue through November.
