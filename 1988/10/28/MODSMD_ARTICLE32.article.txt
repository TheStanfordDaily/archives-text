Cher and Cher alike
Sunday's Flick, "Suspect," has two major
flaws. First of all, Dennis Quaid, who is usually
oh-so-hot-and-sexy, has the sex-appeal of gop
her entrails in this one. Second, despite the
title you will figure out whodunit in the first five
minutes of the film.
But other than those flaws it's pretty fun to
watch. Sit back and enjoy as Cher plays a
lawyer who accepts Pro Bono cases with a
Sonny disposition.
