## Holy brass! Meet the Monks 
### 
Take a couple grad student musicians,
throw in a guy who doesn't even go
here anymore, a bunch of undergrad
horn players and a drummer and what
do you get?
No, not arrested. Go to the back of
the class, Elroy. You get The Electric
Monks.

Gene Anaya

The live sound of U2, Talking Heads,
Robert Palmer and more can be heard
anytime they perform. With a full horn
section complementing excellent
musicians all around, there is little that
this Stanford-bred band cannot play.
From the grinding sound of Robert
Palmer's "Simply Irresistable" to their
killer rendition of the Talking Heads'
"Mr. Jones" (which highlights their
horn section), music by The Monks is
packed with energy and played with tal
ent.
Founded by bassist Ted Delianides
(Ph.D. candidate in Aeronautics — 10
years in school and he ends up playing
the bass) and guitarist Greg Magel (elec
trical engineering grad student) in the
summer of '87, The Electric Monks is
one of Stanford's hottest bands. As man
ager of the band, Delianides has been
successful in getting The Monks gigs
ranging from appearances at Tresidder
to dorm parties to formals in San Fran
cisco.
"You need diversity" for campus gigs,
they say, and diversity is one thing that
The Electric Monks have, playing
popular selections by performers such
as Escape Club and Peter Gabriel. They
also enjoy playing formals, claiming that
it gives them a cheap excuse to wear
those ugly ties hanging in their closet.
With Delianides handling the busi
ness matters (like embezzling all the
band's money and sleeping with their
groupies), Magel is free to nurse the
band's musical soul.
In rehearsal, and during shows, Magel
listens intently for just the right sound
in each song they perform, while also
proving himself more than capable on
guitar. "Sometimes we click," says
Magel, and when they do, they sound
terrific.
Delianides and Magel heard about
drummer Mark Anderson (product
design and LSJUMB bass drum
mer) by word of mouth from other Stan
ford musicians and asked him to join
The Monks.
Anderson, considered by many to be
the best drummer on campus, has a
style which bears the mark of a truly
good drummer. He's mastered the"I

could do this in my sleep" look while
providing an impresive presence on
drums, especially on the Talking Heads'
"Burning Down the House."
And, he looks damn good doing it.
The Electric Monks are the only band
on campus that sports a full-fledged
horn section, allowing them to play
many songs that other bands simply
can't do, such as Oingo Boingo's "Dead
Man's Party." The horn section consists
of Carl Schaefer (undeclared but willing
to try anything) on trumpet, Brett
Sevilla (Chem major) on saxophone and
Rich Reay (electrical engineering major)
on trombone.
Though not every song that The
Monks perform includes horns, those
that do carry that extra punch that
other bands around campus just can't
deliver.
Monks' lead singer John Hendricks
(Music msyor) leads the band through
song after song with his smooth voice
and relaxed demeanor. Because of his
well-schooled vocal cords (he doesn't ac
tually attend class, he just sends his
voice box) and his singing ability (some
thing Axl Rose doesn't have), the Monks
are able to perform songs from a wide
variety of bands — from The Beatles
to Fishbone.
On keyboards is John Polito (Stanford
graduate currently working on digitally
cleaning up older audio recordings and
enjoying not having to attend classes
like the rest of us) who provides the
necessary musical background to make

the songs complete.
The Monks prefer to play more com
plicated songs than the Debbie Gibson
like pre-recorded, pre-processed, pre
packaged pop crap that the geeky fresh
man down the hall listens to.
"We play what we think people want
to hear and songs that demonstrate our
musicianship," they explain. Needless
to say, George Michael is not on their
playlist.
Their advice to those who are inter
ested in joining or forming a band is
to find other musicians with similar
musical interests because deciding what
music to play (and not to play) can
create friction among band members.
They are also quick to point out that
choosing a name is the hardest part of
forming a band.
The name "The Electric Monks"
comes from a Douglas Adams book in
which the electric monk is a labor-saving
appliance (sort of like a wedge-a-matic);
thus their motto: "The Electric Monks:
labor-saving rock for the masses."
One of the hardest parts of being a
band at Stanford is finding time to get
together to rehearse and to perform.
Even with the minor annoyance of
studies, their common desire to perform
keeps The Monks together.
"There's a continuum between
studies and the band," says Anderson,
meaning that they blow-off work when
ever they can use the band as an excuse.
