## Quirky quartet ducks into Dink 
### Kevin Bazzana 
Music lovers with an ear for
the eclectic will welcome the ap
pearance at Stanford of the Turtle
Island String Quartet. The
Oakland-based ensemble will per
form tomorrow at 8 p.m. in Dink
elspiel Auditorium.
The Quartet has earned praise
throughout the United States for
its uniqu3 and provocative style,
which forges a partnership be
tween the tone colors of the clas
sical string quartet (two violins,
viola and cello) and the swinging
rhythms and improvisational
techniques of jazz.
Elements of bebop, bluegrass,
the 20th-century classics and even
Indian music add to the hetero
geneous stylistic palette.
As one would expect, the Quar
tet's repertoire ranges widely,
embracing jazz standards from
Louis Armstrong to Miles Davis,
and featuring numerous compo
sitions by violinists Darol Anger
and David Balakrishnan, who
jointly founded the ensemble in
1984.
All four members of the Turtle
Island String Quartet have per

formed and recorded widely, not
only in jazz but in classical and
country music as well. Both Anger
and Balakrishnan played in the
renowned David Grisman Quin
tet, and Anger currently heads an

other eclectic ensemble known as
Montreaux.
Further information and tickets
for the Turtle Island String Quar
tet are available at the Tresidder
Ticket Office (723-4317).
