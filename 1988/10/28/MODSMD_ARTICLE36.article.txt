"Boyfriends and Girlfriends"
(L'Ami De Mon Amie — French
with English subtitles), the latest
in director Eric Rohmer's series
of films he calls "Comedies and
Proverbs," is very French. Prob
ably too French for all but the
most devoted fans of foreign
cinema or students of the lan
guage.
Blanche (Emmanuelle Chaulet)
works for the Ministry of Culture
in Cergy-Pontoise and is new in
town. Not having any friends, she
is pleased one day when she meets
Lea (Sophie Renoir — Auguste's
great granddaughter), a data proc
essing trainee.

The two become good friends,
spending much of their time to
gether talking about men, espe
cially Lea's boyfriend Fabien and
Blanche's possible-love-interest
to-be Alexandre.
In fact, that's what the whole
film is — talking. Not that there's
anything wrong with dialogue,
but somehow much of it is ren
dered awkward by the cultural
gap that exists between Paris and
Palo Alto.
"Boyfriends and Girlfriends"
isn't much more than a small
anecdotal look at a few lives over
a few weeks, and while there may
be some grand meaning behind
the whole thing, it comes off as
being a little dry.
