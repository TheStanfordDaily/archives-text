## Cardinal hopes for upset in Husky territory 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
The Cardinal football team is
going trick-or-treating a few days
early.
The team travels to Seattle to
face the Washington Huskies to
morrow in search of a big treat:
Stanford's second Pacific 10 Con
ference victory and the revival of
very slim bowl hopes.
The Huskies have been the
stingy, old grump on the block,
however, sending the Cardinal
away with nary a bit of candy
five times since Stanford's last
Husky Stadium victory in 1975.
Things look more optimistic than
usual this season, however, as the
Cardinal has a 3-3-1 mark, 1-2-1
in the Pac-10 while Washington
has struggled to a 4-3 mark, only
1-3 in league play.
Husky Coach Don James said
about his offense, "I'm not sure
we've ever been as bad as far as
total production has been con
cerned." Washington fell to
Oregon last week 17-14 and is
averaging only 17 points a game
over its last four contests.
The team does have ability on
offense, however, especially in the
backfield. Fullback Aaron Jenkins
has 496 yards rushing, tailback
Vince Weathersby has 306 yards
rushing and 100 yards receiving,
and quarterback Cary Conklin
has thrown for 1134 yards and

has eight touchdown passes in
seven games.
"[Conklin] has had some real
good plays," James said. "It's a
matter of eliminating mis
takes. ... I think we've got to help
him more. We've got to get the
running game going; that'll take
the pressure off a young quarter
back."
Stanford Coach Jack Elway
takes that comment as a sign.
"I'm sure they're going to start
out with us with their power run
ning game," he said. Running be
hind an offensive line that
averages 275 pounds, that type of
offense can cause defenses prob
lems.
Stanford's defensive line ap
pears ready for the challenge. De
fensive tackle Lester Archambeau
is ready to play after twisting his
right knee (again) against Oregon
State Saturday, and noseguard
Ray Huckestein made his first ap
pearance in three weeks, coming
back from a turf-toe injury to play
most of the way against the
Beavers.
The injuries also allowed tackle
Scott Palmbush to draw some at
tention to himself on a line with
the two All-America candidates,
as he was Stanford's co-defensive
player of the week two weeks ago.
Stanford's linebacking corps
has also been very solid all season
long, led by Jono Tunney, Kevin
Richardson and Rob Hinckley.

They will need to be at their best
against a balanced Washington of
fense that has rushed for 1099
yards and passed for 1134.
"I'm looking forward to this
game at Washington," Tunney
said, "because they come after you
and that's the type of game I like
to play."
The Cardinal will also have to
contend with 75,000 Husky fans
and an astroturf playing surface.
Elway doesn't think the crowd
will be much of a factor, though.
"I think that Washington's talent
has been the bigger factor than
the stadium," he said. "What you
want to do is start early and do
a lot of good things and quiet
them down."
The Husky defense is led by
inside linebacker Ricky Andrews,
the Pac-10's leading tackier. De
fensive tackle Dennis Brown is
also a force. "Defensively they're
physical," Elway said. "Brown . ..
is a great defensive tackle, plus
the others are physical. They're
very physical and I would say they
have good team speed. I thing
they've played very consistent de
fense."
James agrees. "Our defense has
played real well the past few
weeks," he said. "We are playing
two freshman linebackers and
people have really run to that side.
It's no secret."
One of those two, inside line
backer Chico Fraley, is second on

the team in tackles, leading James
to comment, "They're going to
keep running at him until they
kill us or make him an All-
American."
Stanford's offense, which was
up-and-down against Oregon,
needs a more consistent effort Sat
urday to put points on the board.
Stanford struggled through most
of the game, but had a few high
lights like Jason Palumbis' 75-
yard touchdown pass to Jon
Pinckney.
"I was really impressed with
the job Jason did at quarterback,"
James said. "They have a great
offensive line; I think [tailback
Jon] Volpe is one of the top run
ners in the league. ... I think
they're a much-improved football
team over last year at this time."
Volpe is averaging 91.3 yards
rushing per game, while Palumbis
threw for 262 yards Saturday.
And if the Cardinal can get it
all together, their knocking on the
Husky's door may reward them
with some very sweet candy
indeed.
