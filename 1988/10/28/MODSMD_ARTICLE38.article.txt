# Water polo at Pac-10s

### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Watching the action from the
other end of the pool can get
boring at times.
Todd Kemp does not have to
worry about being lonely this
year.
With the loss of its top four
scorers from last season, Stan
ford's water polo team, still
ranked among the nation's top
five, has switched from an over
powering offense-oriented squad
to a steady defensively-based
team. Goalie Kemp has definitely
noticed the change.
But the redshirt junior has done
anything but sink under the new
found pressure. After keeping
vigil over Stanford's net for two
years while the likes of Craig
Klass (1988 Olympic polo team
member) and Dave Imbernino
(Olympic alternate) kept the ball

across the pool, Kemp has had
his hands full swatting, blocking
and stealing the yellow rubber
sphere this season.
While the Cardinal's offensive
production has dropped this
season, the two-time All-America
goalie, with the help of his team
mates of course, has held opposing
squads to an average of under six
goals a game, keeping Stanford in
the running for another shot at
the NCAA crown. In attaining
this statistic, not only does Kemp
block almost all shots that come
his way, but actually swims out
of the goal to strip opposing
drivers or holemen of the ball.
"Back then we averaged 14
goals a game so if Todd let in
eight or ten it didn't matter. The
lack of offense by us has made
every goal he lets in critical —
now he's almost carrying the
team," Stanford Coach Dante Det
tamanti said.

A starter his freshman year,
Kemp sat back and took in advice
from the squad's offensive stars.
Now he's the Cardinal's senior
member, and is asked to lead the
team in addition to stopping the
opponent's shots. Directing the de
fense, and sometimes even the of
fense, is now just another part of
a day's work for Kemp. "He really
knows what we're trying to do —
his only drawback is that he can't
go down to the other end and
score," Dettamanti said.
The Cardinal hopes Kemp will
be the anchor to a tournament
victory this weekend.
After a dismal two weeks during
which Stanford battled, and lost
to, the top four teams in the coun
try, the 16-8 Cardinal is set to
climb in the national rankings at
the Pacific 10/ Big West Tourna

ment in Long Beach Saturday and
Sunday. Playing a round-robin
format, the squad will play each
of the four squads from the newly
named conference — UC-Irvine,
Cal State Long Beach, Pepper
dine, and UC-Santa Barbara.
With the seven top teams in
the nation battling for eventual
NCAA tournament spots, the Car
dinal needs to step up its offensive
production this weekend. "This is
make it or break it weekend," Det
tamanti said. "This is the last big
tournament before the national
championships and rankings
won't change much after this. We
need to move up now."
If Stanford can win its four
games (all squads except fourth
rated Long Beach are ranked
below the Cardinal), it can move
up to at least fourth in the
rankings.
After weak offensive production
in its three games last weekend
(the Cardinal managed only four
goals against Long Beach and five
against the Trojans), the team has
been emphasizing shooting this
week in practice. In addition, after
the squad's trouble guarding the
opponent's two-meter man in its
past few contests, Dettamanti has
designed a new defense.
