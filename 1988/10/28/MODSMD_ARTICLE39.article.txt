# Volleyball goes on hunting trip for Cougars, Huskies
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Tonight in Washington, this
year's edition of the Stanford
women's volleyball team may very
well work its way into the record
books. Matched up against Wash
ington State, the Cardinal will be
going for its 15th straight win
and a new Stanford record in this
category before travelling to face
the red-hot Washington Huskies.
Stanford, ranked second in the
nation as well as in the Pacific
10 Conference, boasts a 19-1
record overall after Tuesday's
four-game win over No. 11 San
Jose State. The Cougars, un
ranked and eighth in the league,
are 17-12 so far, while the
Huskies hold a 12-4 mark and
third place in the Pac-10.
"I hope that we understand how
important this weekend is," Stan
ford Coach Don Shaw said. "If
the players go up there ready to
play and execute properly, we can
come away okay, but we'll really
have to be ready.
"It's not going to be an easy
weekend. The travelling takes its
toll on the trip. The whole busi
ness of playing those schools is
not easy, and Washington is going
to be primed to play us."
Though seemingly a pushover
for the streaking Stanford squad
— the Cardinal swept WSU 15-10,
15-6, 15-4 earlier this month at
Maples Pavilion — the Cougars
always play especially tough at
home and pose a serious threat.
A new school record is hardly as
sured for the visiting Cardinal.
Leading the way for WSU is
freshman middle blocker Carrie
Couturier, who is currently fifth
in the conference in blocks with
156. The freshman is also hitting
a fairly respectable .245 and has
become the spark in the Cougar
offense.
Coupled with outside hitter
Carla Reyes and setter Beth
Welsh, the team leaders in kills
and digs respectively, Couturier
could crfuse a lethargic Cardinal
problems should the visitors allow

"The Cougs played Washington
really tough and lost in five, 15-13
in the fifth game, last weekend,"
Shaw said. "They've played a lot
of teams tough: they've beaten
USC up there, so that's one we
can't look past. Even though we
handled them pretty easily here,
that means nothing up there."
The going only gets tougher
Saturday in Seattle. Washington
gave the Cardinal one of its tough
est matches to date at Maples,
stripping one game and nearly
taking another before Stanford
sealed the 15-5, 11-15, 15-8, 17-15
decision.

The powerhouses for the
Huskies come in two key places,
setter and left-side hitter. Outside
hitter Laurie Wetzel bears most
of Washington's offensive burden
and handles it with the
proficiency of an AU-Pac-10
player, currently ranking third in
the league in kills-per-game
average.
"Laurie Wetzel is a really good
player, one of the best players in
the league," Shaw said. "If she
gets hot, they'll be on fire. If we
can slow her down, the rest of
that team will have a tougher time
carrying that load."
In the last match with Wash
ington, however, the real chal
lenge for Stanford came from set
ter Melinda Beckenhauer, a Los
Altos native who transferred last'
year from Hawaii. Common
VnTt'lw> in

any hitter can hit a good set, and
the improved play of the Huskies'
hitters this year would certainly
validate that maxim.
"Melinda Beckenhauer sets the
ball really well," Shaw said. "She
matches up their hitters with who
they feel are our weaker blockers.
She'll move the ball around real
well — she's not very predict
able."
This could be bad news for the
Cardinal blockers, who have been
a little out of sorts in the past
few contests. The squad has con
centrated on this skill in practice,
however, and should be back up
to snuff this weekend.
If the past several weeks are
any indicator, the quickest to
rebound will probably be Jennifer
Chaffee. The junior has repeat
edly been one of the team's most
clutch players — most memorably
entering last year's NCAA semi
final match against Texas and net
ting Stanford the crucial win —
and has garnered at least 13 kills
in each of her last three outings.
"She's playing well," Shaw said.
"She's giving us a more consistent
effort every time. She's playing
well all the way around, not just
her hitting and not just her block
ing, the things you'd expect out
of a player her size. But she's
playing pretty good defense, han
dling the ball when she has to,
setting pretty well. She's coming
around and doing a good job for
us."
But all of the players on the
roster will need to excel in order
to leave Washington unscathed
and with their ranking intact.
"They're going to fight really
hard and give it everything
they've got," outside hitter Chervl
Conly said.
"I think we have to be ready
to play our best, because for one
thing it's a long road trip and a
hard one because the schools are
so far apart," Conly added. "We
also haven't been playing our best.

Tonight in Washington, this
year's edition of the Stanford
women's volleyball team may very
well work its way into the record
books. Matched up against Wash
ington State, the Cardinal will be
going for its 15th straight win
and a new Stanford record in this
category before travelling to face
the red-hot Washington Huskies.
Stanford, ranked second in the
nation as well as in the Pacific
10 Conference, boasts a 19-1
record overall after Tuesday's
four-game win over No. 11 San
Jose State. The Cougars, un
ranked and eighth in the league,
are 17-12 so far, while the
Huskies hold a 12-4 mark and
third place in the Pac-10.
"I hope that we understand how
important this weekend is," Stan
ford Coach Don Shaw said. "If
the players go up there ready to
play and execute properly, we can
come away okay, but we'll really
have to be ready.
"It's not going to be an easy
weekend. The travelling takes its
toll on the trip. The whole busi
ness of playing those schools is
not easy, and Washington is going
to be primed to play us."
Though seemingly a pushover
for the streaking Stanford squad
— the Cardinal swept WSU 15-10,
15-6, 15-4 earlier this month at
Maples Pavilion — the Cougars
always play especially tough at
home and pose a serious threat.
A new school record is hardly as
sured for the visiting Cardinal.
Leading the way for WSU is
freshman middle blocker Carrie
Couturier, who is currently fifth
in the conference in blocks with
156. The freshman is also hitting
a fairly respectable .245 and has
become the spark in the Cougar
offense.
Coupled with outside hitter
Carla Reyes and setter Beth
Welsh, the team leaders in kills
and digs respectively, Couturier
could crfuse a lethargic Cardinal
problems should the visitors allow

"The Cougs played Washington
really tough and lost in five, 15-13
in the fifth game, last weekend,"
Shaw said. "They've played a lot
of teams tough: they've beaten
USC up there, so that's one we
can't look past. Even though we
handled them pretty easily here,
that means nothing up there."
The going only gets tougher
Saturday in Seattle. Washington
gave the Cardinal one of its tough
est matches to date at Maples,
stripping one game and nearly
taking another before Stanford
sealed the 15-5, 11-15, 15-8, 17-15
decision.

The powerhouses for the
Huskies come in two key places,
setter and left-side hitter. Outside
hitter Laurie Wetzel bears most
of Washington's offensive burden
and handles it with the
proficiency of an AU-Pac-10
player, currently ranking third in
the league in kills-per-game
average.
"Laurie Wetzel is a really good
player, one of the best players in
the league," Shaw said. "If she
gets hot, they'll be on fire. If we
can slow her down, the rest of
that team will have a tougher time
carrying that load."
In the last match with Wash
ington, however, the real chal
lenge for Stanford came from set
ter Melinda Beckenhauer, a Los
Altos native who transferred last'
year from Hawaii. Common
VnTt'lw> in

any hitter can hit a good set, and
the improved play of the Huskies'
hitters this year would certainly
validate that maxim.
"Melinda Beckenhauer sets the
ball really well," Shaw said. "She
matches up their hitters with who
they feel are our weaker blockers.
She'll move the ball around real
well — she's not very predict
able."
This could be bad news for the
Cardinal blockers, who have been
a little out of sorts in the past
few contests. The squad has con
centrated on this skill in practice,
however, and should be back up
to snuff this weekend.
If the past several weeks are
any indicator, the quickest to
rebound will probably be Jennifer
Chaffee. The junior has repeat
edly been one of the team's most
clutch players — most memorably
entering last year's NCAA semi
final match against Texas and net
ting Stanford the crucial win —
and has garnered at least 13 kills
in each of her last three outings.
"She's playing well," Shaw said.
"She's giving us a more consistent
effort every time. She's playing
well all the way around, not just
her hitting and not just her block
ing, the things you'd expect out
of a player her size. But she's
playing pretty good defense, han
dling the ball when she has to,
setting pretty well. She's coming
around and doing a good job for
us."
But all of the players on the
roster will need to excel in order
to leave Washington unscathed
and with their ranking intact.
"They're going to fight really
hard and give it everything
they've got," outside hitter Chervl
Conly said.
"I think we have to be ready
to play our best, because for one
thing it's a long road trip and a
hard one because the schools are
so far apart," Conly added. "We
also haven't been playing our best.
