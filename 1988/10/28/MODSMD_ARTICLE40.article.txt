# Women's soccer hosts Portland
## 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
Throughout the course of the 1988 soccer season,
the Stanford Cardinal has cautiously picked a path
way through the forest of all of the strong, west
coast women's soccer teams. Entering the final two
games of the regular season, Stanford appears to
have successfully burst through the last thicket of
the dark forest.
In polishing off a tough Sonoma State squad on
Tuesday, Stanford disposed of its last nationally
ranked opponent of the regular season (Sonoma St.
was ranked No. 3 nationally in the NCAA's Division
II poll). The Cardinal's impressive 2-0 victory, which
ran the team's dream season record to 11-4-2, should
have the Cardinal mentally prepared for its match
against the blitzkrieging Ladv Pilots of Portland.
The Lady Pilots, however, can offer the Cardinal
a formidable obstacle of their own. They happen to
possess an almost identical record to Stanford's
(10-4-2), and, unlike so many of Stanford's recent
opponents, they hail from the NCAA's stronger Di
vision I.
In invading Stanford's Harry Maloney Field, the
Lady Pilots find themselves in a more than difficult
situation. They will collide with a Stanford team
that has recently responded to its sole late-season
challenge: rebounding from a loss to Cal State-
Hayward to tie Cal and to embark on yet another
winning streak. The Cardinal, in answering the
challenge, not only clung to their position in the
NCAA's top 20 but also jumped one position higher
(to 14th).
The Cardinal's late-season play has showed a
marked contrast when compared with the team's
early-season outings. Stanford's spirit and intensity
level have skyrocketed of late, as the players
hungrily sense the possibility of the program's first
ever NCAA bid.
