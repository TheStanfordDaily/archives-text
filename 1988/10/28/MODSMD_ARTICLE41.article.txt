# Calm weekend forecast for men's soccer
## 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
Call it the calm before the
storm. The Stanford men's soccer
team gets a slight breather this
weekend, as a pair of inexperi
enced squads from USC and
Oregon State visit the Farm to
play Division I competition for the
first time this season. But the
teams are only a warmup for the
following two Stanford games,
when the Cardinal travels to
South Carolina to play power
houses Indiana and Air Force.
Stanford, 9-9 on the year and
fresh off a 1-0 win over Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo, will attempt to
hone their offensive skills against
the Trojans and Beavers. Coach
Sam Koch will also be likely to

try and venture into the depths
of his bench, especially if Cardinal
can find the back of the net early
and often.
The reserves are guaranteed
time Saturday, because USC is
only a club team, and the game
is merely an exhibition. Sunday's
game will be more meaningful,
but not necessarily that much
more competitive. This is the OSU
squad's first year as a non-club,
varsity sport, and their roster con
sists of 13 freshmen and no
seniors.
But the games are important
for the team. "We sat down last
week and recognized that we have
to finish strong in our last six
games," Koch said. "No one ex
pects us to win against Santa
Clara, Indiana, and Air Force. But

Cal Poly, OSU, and USC we are
expected (to win). These three
games are the keys for the rest
of the season. We have to play
well and win these games."
The real benefit of playing
games like these is to be able to
play without heavy pressure, ac
cording to senior midfielder Luke
Garrott. "I feel very comfortable.
It's the attitude that it's going to
be fun to play and beat these
teams like we haven't beat teams
in the past."
Oregon State enters the week
end riding a four-game winning
streak, but have compiled that
streak and a 9-6-1 record com
pletely against Division II compe
tition. Sophomore forward Garin
Gregory leads the team with eight
goals and four assists. USC is 4-

2-1 against Division II and 111
squads, and is playing Stanford
for the experience and because the
Trojan co-captain has connections
with the Cardinal.
The final analysis of the week
end will hinge on Stanford's level
of play, particularly as a team.
"We have to go out there and play
well as a team," said Dave Thorpe,
another talented Cardinal senior.
"Forget about our record, forget
about winning and just go out
there and play hard for each other.
If we all go out there as a team
and play hard, it makes it a lot
more fun."
These are the last two home
games of the year â€” Saturday at
noon, Sunday at 2 p.m. Go see
Stanford's seniors play for the last
time, and see them play well.
