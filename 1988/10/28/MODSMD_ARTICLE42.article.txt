# Field hockey at Cal Invite
## 
### Greg Gottesman Staff writer 
A sports enthusiast once
complained, "Close only counts
in horseshoes and hand
grenades."
That's too bad because, last
Monday, Stanford's field
hockey team was but one gonl
away from tying North
Carolina, the N0.2-ranked
squad in the country. All in all,
the 6-4-2 Cardinal finished its
week-long Eastern road trip
with a record of 2-2, securing
wins over Temple and Virginia
Commonwealth and suffering
losses to North Carolina and
top-ranked Old Dominion.
Stanford started the road
trip on a positive note with a
3-1 win over Temple, the No.
12 team in the nation. Senior
Kat Thomas, an all-conference
pick, scored twice in the first
half and once in the second to
account for all the Cardinal
goals.
"Kat was just awesome the
whole trip. . .she was a scoring
machine," commented Stanford
Coach Sheryl Johnson.
After the victory over
Temple, Stanford readied to
square off against North
Carolina, which just had beaten
No. 1 Old Dominion. Thomas
and junior Michelanne Baker
kept Stanford in striking dis
tance, as their two goals put
the Cardinal in a 2-2 tie with
just seven minutes to play.
North Carolina's Jen Ander
son, however, dashed Cardinal
hopes of a major upset with a
penalty corner late in the sec
ond half to give the Tar Heels
a 3-2 win.
Senior Laura Gartland, who
was unable to play in the last
three games due to a broken
thumb, concluded, "We played
really well against North
Carolina. Even though we lost
3-2, we still had a great
showing. After that game, we
were tired, and it showed
against Old Dominion."

Stanford met a monster in
Old Dominion. Still smarting
from its loss to North Carolina
earlier in the week, Old
Dominion discombobulated the
Cardinal 4-1. Junior Kathryne
Pyrde saved a shutout with her
first goal of the season late in
the second half.
Stanford concluded its East
ern road trip with a 2-1 win
over Virginia Commonwealth.
Pyrde sparked the Cardinal to
a 1-0 lead with her second goal
of the season. After VCU
knotted the score at 1-1, two
time Ail-American Alison
Smith decided it was time to
end her silence and reassert her
leadership. Smith, who has
been sidelined for most of the
season due to a back injury,
scored at the 20:18 mark of
the second half to put the game
out of reach.
"Alison is a control player.
When she's out on the field,
the whole team plays with more
control," freshman Susan
Leckrone said.
Johnson expounded, "We
dominated the game (against
VCU). We were a little frus
trated that we didn't score
more goals."
The Cardinal concludes its
season with the Cal Inivta
tional at California this week
end. Games include one against
the University of Pacific Friday
at 12 p.m., another against
league-leading Chico State Sat
urday at 9 a.m., and, finally, a
contest against Cal Sunday at
10 a.m.
Stanford's postseason hopes
ride on the results of the up
coming games. Because the
Cardinal did not win the Nor-
Pac Conference championship,
the team needs to be ranked
in the top 12 in the country
to go to the NCAA Regionals,
which begin November 12.
Johnson said that if Stanford
wins the rest of its games,
will have a excellent chance oi
making regionals.
