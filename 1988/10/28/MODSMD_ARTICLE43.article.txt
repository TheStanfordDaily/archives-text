In an effort to bring a little
credibility to our weekly toils, the
Greeks of the Weeks have added
Olympic gold-medalist Scott For
tune to their ranks as this week's
Guest Greek.
Fortune, a senior on the Car
dinal volleyball squad, stopped out
last year to play with the U.S.
Olympic squad and his efforts
came to fruition when he put
down the final ball (straight
down, in fact) in the gold-medal
match against the Soviet Union.
"After a poor performance last
week, the Guest Greek should
jump back into serious conten
tion," Fortune said.
Fortune will have a tough time
catching up with Dave Earnest,
this week's leader. "It's terribly
frightening," Earnest said, "be
cause the pressure's on to perform
well."
How does Earnest fight off the
pressure of public humiliation,
and the competition for a case of
Henry's? "Well, the only reason I
do it is to get my quote in the
paper."
On the other end, Robert Par
dington and Cameron Macky are
fighting off the rats in the cellar,
looking for any opportunity to bet
ter themselves.
