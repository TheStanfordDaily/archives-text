# Assemblyman Tom Hayden:
## Duke needs to put emotion in motion 
### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
Saying that "the Democrats
don't understand emotion,"
Assemblyman Tom Hayden, D-
West Los Angeles, told nearly
100 students yesterday that the
Republicans have led a more
effective presidential campaign
by capitalizing on the nation's
feelings.
In a speech at Toyon Hall,
Hayden said "If we lose it's not
because America wants [Vice
President] George Bush." The
Democratic ticket is not cap
turing the emotions of the elec
torate and, consequently, is fall
ing behind in the polls, Hayden
added.
According to Hayden, Bush
grasps on people's fear of crime
by running television ads that
falsely portray Gov. Michael
Dukakis as a politician who is
softer on crime than most

governors. Dukakis mistak
ingly "believed Bush's negative
attacks would be ignored by
the American people," he said.
But Hayden still asserted
that Dukakis can win the Nov.
8 election.
After the speech, he said "It's
not over till the fat lady sings.
And while she may be putting
on her shoes, it's not over till
it's over."
Hayden gave an example of
why emotional appeal is so es
sential to a presidenital cam
paign. Hayden spoke of "a
middle-class, Irish guy" he met
in a bar.
"(The man] was raised to be
lieve that in order to remain
middle class we had to put our
arm around those next to you
and take them with you,"
Hayden said. "This is the kind
of emotion the Democrats have

to appeal to."
During a question-and-answer
fieriod, Hayden speculated about
Mush's choice of Sen. Dan Quayle
as his running mate.
"The reason why Bush chose
•Juayle is because Quayle is the
only persop who is a lesser being.
(Sen. Robert] Dole would have
urpassed Bush on the stump, at
'oast in Bush's mind," he said.
While writing off Florida and
Texas to the Republicans, Hayden
tressed the unique opportunity
lor California to swing the elec
tion.
Hayden said that Dukakis' call
'or "good lobs and pood wages"
aid Bush a. emphasis on crime
vere actually two approaches to
he same suqject.

"One talks about economics,
the other talks about crime. One
talks about the future, the other
talks about fear. But they're both
talking about what to do with the
future generation of young
people," he said.
Hayden, who is chair of the As
sembly Subcommittee on Higher
Education, said his primary rea
son for visiting Stanford was to
discuss his latest college financial
aid bill with University President
Donald Kennedy.
Hayden said he hopes to in
crease funding for the two
catagories of Cal Grants. Cal
Grant A is based on merit and
need, geered towards middle class
students, while Cal Grant B is
aimed primarily at students from
low-income families.
He is also sponsoring legislation
for public service scholarships and
a prepaid tuition bill.
