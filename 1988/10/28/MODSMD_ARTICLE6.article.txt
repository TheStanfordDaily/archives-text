# Nader leads consumer fight for Prop. 103
## 
### Nathanael Cousins Staff writer 
With consumer advocate Ralph
Nader leading the charge,
Proposition 103 is the consumer's
counter-attack to the political
slugfest between insurance com
panies and attorneys in Califor
nia.
Sponsored by a consumer group
known as Voter Revolt, Prop. 103
is an omnibus insurance-reform
measure that mandates an imme
diate 20-percent reduction in auto,
homeowner and business insur
ance rates. Called the Insurance
Rate Reduction and Reform Act,
Prop. 103 is one of five insurance
reform initiatives on the Nov. 8
ballot.
While insurance companies
have spent $43 million in support
of Props. 101, 104 and 106 and
in opposition to Props. 100 and
103, the Prop. 103 campaign will
spend only $2.2 million, said
Christine Dalton, a campaign aide
for Voter Revolt in San Francisco.
"People are fed up with the in-

surance companies," Dalton said.
"They are wary when the insur
ance companies say they are run
ning out of money, but find $43
million to spend on a political cam
paign. I think people will trust
the insurers even less after this
election."
According to a Los Angeles
Times poll released this week,
Prop. 103 is the only insurance
reform initiative currently favored
by California voters, with 50 per
cent in favor, 34 percent opposed
and 16 percent undecided.
According to Dalton and the
Times poll, one of the primary
reasons for support of Prop. 103
is its name identification with
Ralph Nader, a well known and
respected consumer leader. The
poll of 1,376 Californians found
that 70 percent viewed Nader fa
vorably and only 17 percent un
favorably.

Opponents, including the Asso
ciation of California Insurance
Companies and the California
Chamber of Commerce, have
avoided attacking the popular
Nader while criticizing Prop. 103.
"Compared with how little
people trust lawyers and insur
ance companies, evryone trusts
Ralph Nader," Dalton said.
"Nader will make the difference."
According to an independent
analysis by the state Senate Office
of Research, Prop. 103 would:
• Require an immediate rollback
in auto and some other insurance
rates to 20 percent below the
charges in effect on Nov. 8, 1987.
• Require an additional 20-percent
reduction for good drivers.
• Establish that the state insur
ance commissioner, currently ap
pointed by the governor, be an
elected official.
• Require all rate hikes to be ap
proved by the insurance commis
sioner.
• Subject insurers to state civil
rights, antitrust, and unfair busi
ness laws.

• Allow banks to sell insurance.
• Provide that auto insurance
rates shall be determined, in order
of decreasing importance, by the
insured's driving record, number
of miles driven, number of years
driving experience, and other sub
stantial factors as decided by the
commissioner.
Opponents of Prop. 103 charge
that the initiative, while highly
intentioned, does nothing to cure
the underlying problems of high
insurance rates in California,
which they say are litigation fees
and government regulation. In ad
dition, they claim that it will
create a massive regulatory bu
reaucracy and another expensive
political position. Further, they
say that the rate cuts are so severe
that some insurers would be
forced to leave California.
Dalton dismissed that idea.
"The insurers say they will go
broke and will be forced to leave
the state if Prop. 103 is passed,"
she said. "I don't think so. Cali
