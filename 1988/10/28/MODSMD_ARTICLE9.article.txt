# Deaf 'stood tall' in rights protest

Recalling the fight to get a deaf president at the
world's only university for the deaf, a deaf student
activist said Wednesday night that "the Gallaudet
protest was just the beginning of a whole larger war."
Jerry Covell, a senior at Gallaudet University in
Washington D.C., spoke through a translator to
about 40 students, faculty and members of the
community — both hearing and deaf — about the
protests and the deaf struggle for equality.
On March 6 last spring, the Gallaudet board of
trustees chose a hearing woman, Elisabeth Zinser,
over two deaf men to be president of the university.
Outraged students shut down the University with
demonstrations and boycotts until the board ap
pointed a deaf president, I. King Jordan, March 13.
"That was the day that the deaf finally stood
tall," said Covell, who was the driving force behind
the protests.
Covell said his fellow students' initial doubts that
a deaf person could handle the job upset him. "If
they were saying a deaf person can't do it, then I
can't be a lawyer because they said so," said Covell,
who is applying this fall to Stanford Law School.
If Covell is accepted, he would be the first deaf
student in the Law School's history. "Believe me,
I'm going to get there," he said.
Currently, there are less than 10 deaf students
at Stanford.
The Gallaudet protests are over, but "we are not
finished," Covell said.
