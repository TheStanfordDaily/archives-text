# USW, University reach contract agreement
## 
### Laura Jacobson Senior staff writer 
The United Stanford Workers and the
University reached a tentative contract
agreement late last night after bargaining
throughout the weekend, according to the
University chief negotiator.
At 12:30 a.m., University lawyer Mi
chael Vartain affirmed that both sides
were pleased with the agreement. Vartain
said the union would recommend "enthu
siastically" the new contract to the union
members.
"It looks like it's going to work out,"
USW chief negotiator Mary Mocine told
the Daily in a break from negotiations
half an hour before the final agreement
was reached.

"The University negotiating team
thinks it's a fair agreement. It does not
contain every thing either side wanted,"
Vartain added.
Mocine had already gone home and was
unavailable for a final comment after the
two sides reached a settlement.
USW members will meet at noon today
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium to vote
whether to ratify the tentative three-year
contract.
If the agreement is ratified by the union
members, it will be signed by the USW
and the University within the next two
weeks, Vartain said.
Employees have been working without
a contract since Aug. 31, when the pre
vious three-year contract expired.
Remarking on the atmosphere of ne

gotiations this weekend, Mocine said the
two sides "sat around and got punchy"
while they hammered out the remaining
issues. Pizza, Chinese food and coffee
kept the two sides going late Friday, late
Saturday and last night.
Mocine credited much of the recent
movement in negotiations to Commis
sioner Maggie Jacobsen from the Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Service.
Jacobsen began to facilitate negotiations
Oct. 17 after the union agreed to federal
mediation.
Vartain agreed. "The assistance of the
federal mediator has been invaluable to
both sides."
Vartain added that the pressure of the
strike deadline helped to motivate the
bargaining teams to push for a settle

ment.
Mocine said the University "backed
off" on many of its proposals during the
course of the weekend. Last Friday,
Mocine said she would recommend a
strike to the workers if there was no
considerable movement this weekend.
Negotiations began late July and con
tinued through the summer and fall. Last
night marked the culmination of a 96-day
ordeal.
Mocine said the University gave in on
several key issues this weekend, including
a University proposal that would have
given non-union employees, who are cur
rently obligated to pay dues to the union,
the option of donating these dues to
charity.

Vartain said he would not comment on
the details of the agreement until it is
ratified.
In addition, Mocine said the University
has agreed to an increase in medical
benefits and "favorable" changes in the
workers' pension plan.
In return, the union conceded to the
University's proposal for a "zipper
clause," which waives the right of em
ployees to contest items not covered by
the contract during the duration of the
contract.
The USW represents 1,200 technical,
service and maintenance workers on
campus, at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center and at the Medical Cen
ter.
