### Ravi Desai 
The 1988 presidential "election
is over and George Bush will be
elected president," Political Sci
ence Prof. David Brady told a
group of about 40 students in
Serra lounge Thursday evening.
In a panel discussion, Brady,
along with Communications De
partment Chair Steven Chaffee
and Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody, spoke on the media's in
fluence in the upcoming elections.
Brody, a noted expert on the
effects of the media on the elec
tions, said the main "determinant
of this election is Ronald Reagan."
Noting the President's high ap
proval rating, he said this election
is a referendum on the policies of
the last eight years.
Brady agreed by noting that
George Bush is campaigning on
the status quo while Michael Du
kakis is running the "prospective
candidacy by saying 'We can do
better."'
The three panelists all agreed

that spending time responding to
Republican attacks has slowed
down Dukakis* presidential cam
paign.
On Dukakis' military and crime
policies, Brody said he was "mys
tified" as to why Dukakis failed
to craft a set of responses to Re
publican charges.
Specifically, Brody said Dukakis
has failed to "address directly the
accusation that his military policy
would weaken America."
In addition, Brody said Dukakis
has not answered criticism of the
furlough program. Rather than
explain the detriments of ending
the furlough program, Dukakis
has avoided responding to charges
that the program allows criminals
back on the streets, Brody said.
Noting the defensive tone of the
presidential campaign, Brody said
"attack has been responded with
attack rather than reason." He
said neither party has faced the
issues.
Chaffee added that in contrast
to other forms of advertising,

188

"there is more freedom of ir
responsibility and lies in political
advertising." He implied that the
voters are seeing what the cam
paigns want them to see.
Brady, however, said he does
not see either presidential cam
paigns as overtly negative, but as
a "rational" course of action for
both sides.
On the question of how the
press influnces voter turnout,
Brody thought turnout may be
down, due more to the lack of
"depth of feeling for either can
didate" than to any press power.
Chaffee said less people might
vote in California if Dukakis con
cedes the election too early.
Junior Ron Mayer said he left
the discussion still believing that
the "press and polls have consid
erable influence" on voting.
