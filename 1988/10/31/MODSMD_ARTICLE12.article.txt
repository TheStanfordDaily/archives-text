## Philip Morris buys Kraft Hostile takeover fight ends in $13 billion buyout 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - Kraa Inc.
said yesterday it had agreed to a
$13.1 billion buyout by Philip
Morris Cos. Inc., apparently end
ing a short but intense hostile
takeover fight in the biggest
merger ever between two non-oil
U.S. companies.
In a joint statement, the two
food giants said they reached a
definitive agreement in which
Philip Morris would boost its $90
a share tender offer to $106 for
each of Kraft's outstanding
shares.
Kraft shares closed at $96.50,
up $2 a share, Friday on the New
York Stock Exchange. Philip Mor
ris closed down 25 cents at $94.75
a share.
The agreement comes just five
days after Kraft, which is based
in Glen view, 111., said it would

negotiate with Philip Morris only
if the tobacco and consumer prod
ucts company raised its offer to
equal the value of a defensive re
structuring proposed by Kraft.
Kraft on Oct. 23 rejected Philip
Morris' $90 offer as inadequate,
and unveiled a restructuring it
said would pay its shareholders
$110 a share in cash and securi
ties, but also would heap $12.4
billion in new debt on the com
pany.
"Our shareholders are receiving
full value, and this merger is the
best possible outcome for our em
ployees, customers and the com
munities in which we operate,"
John Richman, Kraft chair and
chief executive, said in the state
ment.
Hamish Maxwell, chairman and
chief executive of Philip Morris,

said in the statement that his com
pany believed the merger would
create "a U.S.-based food com
pany that will compete more ef
fectively in world food markets.
"Kraft's products provide an ex
cellent complement to our existing
product lines and position us to
capitalize on marketing opportu
nities worldwide."
Those products include some of
the best known foods on U.S. su
permarket aisles, including
Philadelphia cream cheese,
Miracle Whip salad dressing, Seal
test and Breyer's ice creams and
Velveeta cheese spread.
Philip Morris products include
Miller beer, brands in its General
Foods unit, such as Maxwell
House coffee, Jell-0 and Kool-Aid,
and tobacco products.
