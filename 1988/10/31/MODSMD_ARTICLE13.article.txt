JERUSALEM (AP) - Palestin
ians ambushed and firebombed a
passenger bus in the occupied
West Bank yesterday night, killing
an Israeli woman and her two
infants and injuring eight other
Israelis, officials said.
The bus was stopped by a bar
ricade of stones set up in a main
street of Jericho, a biblical town
seven miles east of Jerusalem, Is
raeli officials said on condition of
anonymity.
Israel radio quoted military
sources as saying Palestinian
youths hurled five firebombs at
the bus, which was carrying about
20 people, most of them civilians.
The red-and-white Egged bus
was traveling from Tiberius on
the Sea of Galilee to Jerusalem
when it was halted about 8 p.m.
It was engulfed in fire before
the woman and her babies, sitting
in the rear, could be rescued, wit
nesses said. Their identities were
not released, and officials said
they did not know the ages of the
infants.
Earlier, a Palestinian was killed
and 21 others wounded in clashes
between Israeli soldiers and Arab
demonstrators in the West Bank
and occupied Gaza Strip.
The deaths raised the toll to
305 Palestinians and nine Israelis
killed since the Palestinian upris
ing against Israeli occupation
began Dec. 8.
The deaths, the worst shedding
of Israeli blood since the Pales
tinian uprising began 10 months
ago, came two days before Tues
day's Parliament elections.
It could swing undecided votes
to the right-wing Likud bloc of
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
who has advocated a tougher line
on dealing with the unrest.
"The murderous and criminal
act is testimony to the trend

towards more extremism on the
part of the aggressors whose one
desire is to kill and burn as many
Jews as possible," Shamir was
quoted as saying by the national
Itim news agency.
Itim quoted Foreign Minister
and Labor Party leader Shimon
Peres, his election rival, as saying
that such attacks unite the nation
into "one family."
"Neither terrorism nor violence
will determine our path. We will
determine our path," he said.
"Deeds such as tonight's tear at
the heart and provide nothing in

the way of hope or a solution."
Israel radio said the army
clamped a curfew on the area and
mounted a search for the as
sailants. Chief of Staff Lt. Gen.
Dan Shomron and other senior
officers rushed to the site.
Israel radio broadcast an inter
view with an army sergeant who
was aboard the bus and tried to
rescue the three.
"I heard the sounds of a wom
an. I approached her, and grabbed
her with one hand. I said, 'Come
out with me.' She absolutely
refused," said the soldier, identi
fied only as Sgt. Ron, 21.
