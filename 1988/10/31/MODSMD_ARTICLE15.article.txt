# U.S. to cut Persian Gulf fleet

MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) â€”
The United States plans to reduce
its fleet of warships in the Persian
Gulf this week with the with
drawal of a frigate, U.S. sources
said yesterday. The move reflects
confidence in the Iran-Iraq truce.
The sources said the vessel will
leave barring a last-minute
change in plans. It would be the
first American warship to be
removed from the gulf since Iran
and Iraq agreed to an Aug. 20
cease-fire in their eight-year war.
The 3,600-ton missile frigate,
the USS Rodney M. Davis, will
be detached from gulf duty to

morrow, said the sources on con
dition of anonymity. It will sail
for its home port in Yokosuka,
Japan, they said.
In Washington, Pentagon
spokesman Maj. Mike Stepp
refused comment, citing a Defense
Department policy of not discuss
ing ship movements or locations
for security reasons.
The ship's departure would
trim overall American naval
strength in the region from 26 to
25 vessels. The Pentagon says the
U.S. gulf force will gradually be
scaled back to a pre-war level of
about five ships if the cease-fire

stays in effect.
U.S. warships in the Persian
Gulf and nearby waters have fre
quently departed, but they were
replaced by other vessels in a rota
tion schedule.
The fleet dropped from 27 to
26 ships when the USS Vincennes
cruiser departed from the Arabian
Sea on Sept. 5. The Vincennes
was to have been replaced by the
cruiser USS Mobile Bay but the
orders sending it to the gulf area
were canceled a day before it was
to have left.
Since the cease-fire, no flareups
of violence have been reported.
