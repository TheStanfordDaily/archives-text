Gorbachev seeks action on reform

sloganeering and that it's time for Soviet society
to get down to work.

munist League, or Komsomol, Gorbachev ex
pressed his impatience with the slow pace of
reform under his policy of perestroika, or re
structuring.

long," he said Saturday. "Meetings, slogans, and
criticisms should be followed by acts which would
set the policy and the entire potential of society
into motion."
Gorbachev's remarks were distributed late Sat
urday by the official news agency Tass. They
appeared to signal the Soviet leader's impatience
to get the country moving rather than any dis

enchantment with the more open atmosphere he
has fostered.

IQUIQUE, Chile (AP) — President Augusto
Pinochet, who survived a 1986 assassination at

the only obstacle to restoring democracy may

the sight," the official Orbe news agency quoted
him as saying yesterday.
On Saturday, Pinochet, 72, spoke to several
hundred supporters in Inquique, 1,150 miles
north of Santiago.

Oct. 5 referendum aimed at extending his 15-year
rule to 1997, the right-wing army commander

he leave office before his term expires.
