Participation in the
mock election prepares
voters for the real one

START GETTING IN the
mood to vote in the national
election by taking part in to
morrow's mock election sponsored
by American Studies House.
Practice polling is an excellent
opportunity to become familiar
with some of the ballot's more
obscure issues. Considering that
there is a 10-minute time limit for
this year's balloting, a mock elec
tion might make the Nov. 8
decision-making process less
stressful.
Given that the deluge of televi
sion political ads does not always
give a reliable view of election is
sues, don't go into the "real" voting
booth undecided and expect to have
an adequate amount of time to
decide a position on all the different
issues. You might as well just toss
a coin.
Furthermore, studying the
sample ballot — which probably
gives the most accurate view of
the issues — and doing some
simple research, will help you avoid
an ill-informed decision.
Since most people have already
heard and read more than enough
about the presidential candidates,
that part of the ballot will be the
easiest to fill out.
But the ballot is also packed with
propositions, thanks to California's

popular initiative law. Complex
proposals such as the five that alter
California's insurance policies re
quire careful thought and study.
And, some of these non
presidential issues on the ballot are
just as important for the local com
munity as the question of who sits
in the White House.
For the apathetic voter, however,
researching the issues may seem
like a great effort. But presidential
elections occur only once every
four years. Think about all the
people in the world who (literally)
kill for the privilege of voting.
Apathy isn't the only threat:
with voter dissatisfaction at such
a high level this year, voter turnout
may reach an all-time low.
Those who don't believe in the
power of voting, who are disillu
sioned by the ineffectuality of a
single vote, must know that the
only way the system will change
is if they do vote. It sounds cliche,
but simple mathematics prove it:
every single vote counts.
And historical precedent shows
it: local and presidential candidates
have won by a single vote per
precinct in the past, and issues in
this year's election may very well
be just as close.
Voting can change America, the
people have the power to elect the
government, and that power does
translate into the power to govern.
Don't bemoan the state of political
life in the United States, and then
not vote on Nov. 8.
Vote, remind your friends to
vote, and get your neighbor to vote.
And do your best to cast an ed
ucated vote.
