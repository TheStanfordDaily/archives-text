# Jackson rallies for Duke
## Speech calls Bush 'beneath dignity' of president 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
Rev. Jesse Jackson called on a
White Plaza audience Friday to
"Keep hope alive" during the final
days of the 1988 presidential cam
paign as he rallied support for
Democratic presidential hopeful
Gov. Michael Dukakis.
A crowd of about 3,000 listened
intently to Jackson's hour-long af
ternoon speech, in which he
bashed the Bush campaign for
being undignified and criticized
the Reagan administration. He
also touched upon Stanford
related issues such as racism on
campus and the United Stanford
Workers contract negotiations.
Maintaining their enthusiasm
after an hour-and-a-half wait due
to Jackson's late arrival, support
ers chanted "Jesse! Jesse!" and
waved Dukakis/Bentsen placards
as Jackson took to the stage.

Speech-goers crowded the Old Un
ion balconies and stretched from
the stage to the Claw.
Jackson rallied for Dukakis by
criticizing the current campaign
for "going low and ugly" and by
attacking Republican positions on
national issues.
He said the race has been full
of diversions and distortion. Ac
cording to Jackson, the campaign
is not looking at the "impact of
a $150-billion-budget deficit (and)
a $2.2-trillion debt."
Jackson admonished Republi
can presidential candidate George
Bush's campaign for "challenging
[Dukakis'] mental health and his
integrity and his commitment to
our nation and patriotism."

According to Jackson, Bush's
name-calling against Dukakis
reflects poorly on the vice presi
dent. "When [Bush] calls me a
Chicago hustler, when he calls the
ticket a three-headed monster,
calls Mr. Dukakis a socialist, this
is beneath the dignity of one who
would lead the free world."
Directly challenging Bush, Jack
son said, "I am a progressive
liberal and proud about it." Dur
ing the campaign, Bush has re
peatedly used the word liberal as
a derogatory term applied to Du
kakis.
Jackson then praised liberals
for bettering U.S. society by au
thoring the Bill of Rights, leading
the abolitionist movement and
pushing for desegregation of
public schools.
Acknowledging that the Demo
crats are trailing in the presiden-


April Pearson — Dally
tied polls, Jackson told his lis
teners, "every vote counts."
"I have a mind at work and I
know we can win this election,"
he said.
Of late, Jackson has received
criticism that he has not cam
paigned enough for the Democra
tic ticket. Responding to the
criticism, Jackson called on other
politicians to keep pace with his
campaign schedule.
"I challenge every congressman,
every mayor, every governor,
every senator, match my efforts,
match my schedule."
Jackson identified several prob
lems with the Reagan presidential
years. "Eight years later, there

are more condominiums. But
there are three to five million
homeless people. .. . Eight years
later, we have a morally bankrupt
policy in South America, Africa
and the Middle East."
While mostly hitting on na
tional issues, Jackson also tailored
his speech to his Stanford sup
porters. Jackson opened his re
marks saying, "The Rainbow Co
alition bid you, young America,
to come alive."
"When young America chooses
to be sober and sane and serious
and mature . . . America always
gets better. . . . Stanford, help lead
us to a brighter and better
America," Jackson said.
Although he did not address the
racial incidents which occured at
Ujamaa House two weeks ago,
Jackson did address racism in his
speech.
