## Liability limits learning 
### 
WE LIVE IN A litigious society,
and we're paying a price. Practi
cally every undertaking is beset
with a fear of lawsuits. No one is willing
to take risks; we expect compensation for
every hardship and failure. But we fail
to realize that our unwillingness to accept
responsibility for our actions actually
limits our achievements.'
Stanford is not immune to these pres
sures. Last spring quarter, the threat of
liability placed a group of engineering
students in direct conflict with the Uni
versity.
It started with a propane tank. Seven
students converted the 288 gallon shell
into a a functional two-person submarine,
complete with life support system and
viewports. "We had to make a project for
ME 113," says Scott Anderson, the sub
marine's originator. "As a final gesture
to Stanford, we decided to propose our
own project. We wanted to do something
a little more challenging."
Nobody could have anticipated the
stumbling blocks the University and the
students would be forced to face in pur
suit of the difficult project.
"Basically, we were trying to do the
impossible," says Anderson. "But with
the support of the Stanford engineering
faculty and shop, we figured we could
work out the technical details." Ironically,
the legal, and not the technical, details
held them back.
"Originally," says group member Mark
Brosius, "the professors supported our
plan of designing a submarine that the
average guy could make in his garage.
But when the question of liability came

up, they were forced to take a more con
servative stand. They wanted us to design
something on paper. They were afraid
we'd drown."
After risk management officials
reviewed the project, they issued an ul
timatum: the group could continue to
use the University's machine shop only
if they agreed never to test the submarine
under water. Otherwise, they would have
to get out.
"I guess the real sad thing about the
situation was that in order to protect
themselves and the university, the pro
fessors had to withdraw their support of
the project. We had already invested
$1500 of our own money, and most of
our lives. We couldn't just give it up,"
says Anderson.
So the group hit the road. For three
weeks at the end of spring quarter, they
commuted 150 miles south to Kerman,
California, to the farm of group member
Scott Chamness. "It was hard," says
Chamness, "and dangerous too. We really
needed the expertise that Stanford had
to offer." Hauling the 2000 pound tank
down the freeway was neither easy nor
safe. In the process of loading it onto the
trailer with inadequate tools, it fell out
of a tree. Coming home, they lost part
of the trailer on the freeway. They almost
lost the sub.
"The whole Fresno farming community
mobilized to help us," says Anderson.
"They didn't care about liability." A local
welder even donated his services.
Today the submarine sits in Anderson
and Brosius' garage, soon to be com
pleted.

Despite the hardships, all agree that
building the submarine was a tremendous
experience. "We have no hard feelings.
The shop and professors wanted to help
us, but in our society they were really
forced to take the position they did," says
Anderson. "If anything, the shop deserves
much more credit than it receives for the
success of Stanford mechanical engineers.
It's a dangerous thing not to have prac
tical building experience."
According to Brosuis, "the machine
shop exists in a sort of limbo. You have
the shop but you can't really use it. Next
year you won't be able to build a bicycle.
Pretty soon you'll only be able to make
a piece of non-toxic fluff."
Although the University and the stu
dents shared similar goals, the realities
of our litigious society forced them into
different corners. And where does this
lead us?
"Life is hard," concludes Brosius.
"We're constantly faced with suffering
and difficulties. We don't want to accept
that. We're trying to take suffering out
of life and we don't realize that we're
paying a price for that."
They should know.
