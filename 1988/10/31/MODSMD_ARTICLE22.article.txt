## Hisses drown out different viewpoints on campus 
### 
THE OCT. 26 EDITORIAL raises
a very good point: why not bring
Adolfo Calero to speak on
campus? I'll tell you why: because no
one would bother to listen.
The liberal students on this campus
are too busy booing and hissing
speakers with whom they disagree,
that they don't allow themselves the
chance to consider the merits of the
other side. This is the same group
which labels the moderate/conservative

students on campus "close-minded" for
not accepting Jesse Jackson's agenda
for America.

merits of the other side.

I am certain the "dream sheet" for
this year's commencement speaker has

chev, Fidel Castro, Daniel Ortega, Ted
Kennedy, Jane Fonda or Jesse Jackson
(What's one more visit?). It's truly a
shame that Joseph Stalin and Ho Chi
Minh won't make the list this year.
