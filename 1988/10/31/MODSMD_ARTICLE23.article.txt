# Racial tolerance not Bush's strength
## 
### 
Much has been written and said
about the events at Ujamaa this year,
and about similar incidents last year. A
lot of questions have also been raised;
one of them is "why," but a more chal
lenging one to all of us is: What now?
Similar despicable acts are occurring
throughout the country, on and off
campuses. These exhibitions of racial
intolerance — which is an integral part
of this country's history — were re
kindled eight years ago by the Reagan
Administration, and are being stoked
again now by the Bush campaign.
The public has been reading about
rank and malicious racial jokes within
the very walls of the Oval Office itself;
and some of these statements were
made by individuals who are now
major strategists in the Bush cam
paign. And the public is now hearing
about Bush's use of racism in his so
called assault on crime and civil
liberties.
It is alarming that Bush might have
the opportunity to appoint individuals
to the U.S. Supreme Court because of
the effect that would have on issues of
great importance to people of color.

One of the meanings of Ujamaa is
"cooperative production." Therefore, I
would like to propose that the Stan
ford student body take time off from
its campus problems long enough to
join forces to strike a blow for racial
justice, multi-cultural understanding,
and freedom for all.
Four more years of their philosophy
and the racial attitudes they project
from the White House will make life
extremely difficult for people of color
here and throughout the world, for
racial understanding has never been a
trademark of the Republican Party.
To Stanford students — especially
those voting for the first time — I say,
writing a racial graffito on a poster is
one thing; what you write on your
ballot is quite another.
