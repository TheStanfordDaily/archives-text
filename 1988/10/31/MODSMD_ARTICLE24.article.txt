# Joint appointments aid Hoover's cause
## 
### 
The Daily is usually excellent, but
apparently it failed to talk to any oppo
nents of joint appointments between
Hoover and Stanford in the Oct. 20
news analysis, "Joint appointments link
Stanford and Hoover."

There are two problems with such
appointments. First, such appointments
(along with the Nobel laureates on
Hoover's masthead) help legitimize
Hoover and thereby assist it in push
ing (conservative) causes.
Second, professors willing to take
Hoover's money get time off from
teaching and receive research assis
tance not available to the rest of the
faculty.
More joint appointments, with no
change in Hoover's independence, ad
vance Hoover's mission, regardless of
the intentions of those accepting the
Institution's favor.
