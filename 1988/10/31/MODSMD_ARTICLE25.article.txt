# Competent advice given in Krakow
## 
### 
In the article, "Life in Krakow. .
(Oct. 21), we read that "during (the
period of the unrest) Stanford adminis
tration representatives requested stu
dents to stay out of the way. 'Here was
history being made and they (Stanford)
wanted us to stay clear of what was
happening. That's an awfully big temp
tation. .

The two Stanford tutors and I, the
Director at that time, indeed requested
that students stay away from demon
strations and the possibility of action
by the Polish police. That advice was
given us by both Polish and American
authorities and had nothing to do with
the desire to keep students from
watching history being made.
The University would be irrespon
sible not to keep in close touch with
authorities in times of disturbances
overseas and not to pass on their ad
vice to students; indeed, students would
— and would be entitled to — question
our competence if we did not do so.
