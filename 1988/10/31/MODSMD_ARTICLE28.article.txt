## Photo Essay Reach Out Today 
### 
Whether it's picking up a paintbrush to
help refurbish an elementary school
classroom or sharing a smile with a little
brother in the wheelbarrow races,
reaching out into the community beyond
Stanford can be an educational experience. Yet, as many
students who participated in service projects this
weekend as part of the Reach Out Today program
discovered, helping others can also be a lot of fun.
In its sixth year, the Reach Out Today program
continues to introduce Stanford students to community
service in the local communities, and once again this
Saturday students participated in various short-term
projects on campus and in the surrounding areas.
In Los Altos, some eager gardeners put their green
thumbs and hedgeclippers to good use at the Grant
Cuesta Senior Center. On campus, seniors joined in fun
and frolic on Wilbur Field with wait-listed kids in the
Peninsula Big Brothers and Big Sisters program.
As the pictures suggest, Saturday's potpourri of public
outreach projects successfully engendered the inspiring
spirit of effectual public service.
"It's like an hors d'oeuvre to whet the appetite for
public service," said Waseem Noor, assistant director of
Reach Out Today.
And for Stanford, the main entree id yet to come.
Reach Out Today has compiled a catalog that lists
numerous short-term service projects available for
student groups and dorm participation. The fun and
valuable work witnessed on and off campus during this
weekend's service spree will continue throughout the
year.
