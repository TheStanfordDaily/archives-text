## Fourth-quarter heroics can't save the Cardinal 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
SEATTLE, Wash. — Halloween
came a few days early for the
Stanford football team Saturday,
but instead of receiving any
treats, Stanford was haunted by
its fourth "almost" game of the
season, a 28-25 loss to Washing
ton.

Football
Huskies 28, Cardinal 25

The Cardinal reached the
Husky 10-yard line three times in
the first half, but came away with
only a field goal each time, and
a late rally wasn't quite enough
to avert the Cardinal's sixth con
secutive loss in Husky Stadium.
Stanford fell to 3-4-1 on the
season, 1-3-1 in the Pacific 10
Conference. Washington is now 5-
3, 2-3 in Pac-10 play.
"It's really frustrating," Stan
ford fullback Jon Volpe said.
"Those are the kind of games you
just tell yourself you didn't lose,
you just ran out of time."
"We were very, very proud of
their effort," Stanford Coach Jack
Elway said of his players. "They
turned momentum around and
played hard every down. ... I
want that to be our last memory."
Volpe certainly gave the game
his best effort, finishing with 220
yards on 29 carries to break Dar
rin Nelson's Cardinal record of
211 yards rushing, set in 1977.
"Volpe had a big day," El way
said. "He's a great little back so
you kind of get used to seeing
that out of him." Volpe will never
forget his 68-yard run in the
fourth quarter, however, when he
broke free on a play off left tackle

then he cut back up the middle.
Volpe was caught from behind,
something he doesn't remember
ever happening to him before.
"I should have had that one in
the endzone," he said, "but got
caught from behind (by corner
back Le-Lo Lang). That was about
my 28th carry so I was kind of
tired on that play. We didn't end
up scoring on that drive. I'm going
to have nightmares about that
play."

The first drive summarized the
whole game. Kevin Scott returned
the opening kick-off 53 yards to
the Husky 44, after which the
Cardinal easily drove to the 15.
After getting only five yards on
three plays, Stanford was forced
to settle for a 27-yard field goal
from John Hopkins.
Washington then drove 79 yards
to take a 7-3 lead, thanks to a
bit of razzle-dazzle. On their first
play the Huskies gave tailback
Vince Weathersby a pitch, he
handed to flanker Brian Slater
coming around on a reverse,
Slater pitched to quarterback
Cary Conklin and Conklin found
Scott Fitzgerald wide-open for a

55-yard pass. Six plays later
Washington had the lead.
On the Cardinal's next posses
sion, a Jason Palumbis pass was
tipped by Husky tackle Dennis
Brown and picked off by Ricky
Andrews, and less than two
minutes later it was 14-3.
After exchanging punts, the
Huskies were on the move again,
reaching the Cardinal 15 before
free safety Mike Newton's first
career interception got the ball
back for Stanford.
Getting possession on his own
four, Cardinal quarterback Jason
Palumbis led Stanford 88 yards
for a first-and-goal on the UW
eight. Three plays later it was
fourth-and-goal from the eight
and Hopkins kicked his second
field goal.
A few minutes later it was
Washington's ball again and Weat
hersby faked a reverse to Slater
but kept the ball, resulting in a
33-yard gain to the Cardinal four.
The Huskies punched it in behind
their huge offensive line and it
was 21-6.
Stanford took the ensuing kick
off to its own 21, then drove the
ball again, reaching the Husky
three before settling for Hopkins'
third trey of the half with 31
seconds left, producing the
halftime scora of 21-9.
"We were down there a lot,"
Elway said. "I'll take that. Our
first play in those series was a
bad one and we had second-and
eight, second-and-nine and we
had to monkey around a little bit."
Washington took the ball in on
the opening drive of the second
half to make it 28-9, but then
things started going Stanford's
way. Scott returned the kick-off
back to the UW 49 and the Car
dinal was in business again.
The two big returns for Scott

were yet another sign that the
Cardinal special teams are con
tinuing to improve. "They went
out there and did some gfeat
blocking," Scott said. "I put it all
on them. They gave me some big
holes to run through .... I just
>»
ran.
On the first play of the drive
Volpe ran up the middle, cut it

to the right side and went 23 yards
to the 26. Three plays later the
Cardinal was still on the 26 so
Hopkins came in, again, and
kicked a 43-yarder into a head
wind to make it 28-12. The kick
also tied the school record for field
goals in a game (four), held by
many people.
With the team now within six

field goals, the Cardinal defense
stiffened and forced three straight
punts. The Cardinal couldn't get
anything going either, but a Brad
Cook interception gave the Cardi
nal the ball on the Stanford 19
with 13:06 left.
The Cardinal drove down to the


Sophomore tight end Chris Walsh caught a fourth-quarter touchdown pass against Washington
Saturday. The Cardinal was unable to get out of the Huskies' grasp despite record efforts bv Jon
Volpe and John Hopkins.
