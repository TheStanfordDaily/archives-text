# Soccer busts loose
## 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
On Halloween weekend, it was
only fitting that the Stanford
men's soccer team turned
Maloney field into a haunted
house for inexperienced soccer
squads. The Cardinal crushed
young USC and Oregon State on
successive days, and in the process
revealed two features not seen
previously: the depth of its bench
and the ability to score in large
quantities.

Men's Soccer
Cardinal 6, Trojans 1
Cardinal 4, Beavers 0

The Stanford offense, which has
had extreme difficulty finding the
back of the net all year, scored
10 goals, with eight players con
tributing to that amazing output.
The defense was up to the task
as well, giving up only a late goal
to USC. The Cardinal took the
Trojans 6-1, and blanked the
Beavers 4-0.
Stanford won its second and
third games in a row, finishing
the home schedule with an 8-4
mark. Because the USC game was
an exhibition, the Cardinal's of
ficial record only jumps one notch
to 10-9 on the season.
Practicing up for Election Day,
the booters scored early and often
on their visitors from the south,
racking up three goals less than
13 minutes into the game. Coach
Sam Koch started several
reserves, and rested regulars
Luke Garrott (iryured right leg),

Chris Helling and Chris Porch the
entire game.
After Todd Caven opened up the
scoring with a nice goal four-and
a-half minutes in, sophomore
midfielder Richie Polio celebrated
his rare starting role with his first
goal of the season only 13 seconds
later. Players such as Polio made
sure there was no chance for a
letdown against the weaker team.
"We were able to let people play
who hadn't had a chance to play
much, so there was definitely a
lot of motivation there," Koch
said. "We wanted to play a lot of
the younger kids because you
know they want to play."
Andrew Westergren is not one
of the younger kids, but he was
making a rare start as well. The
senior fullback has been bothered
by a shoulder iryury the latter
half of the season, and is just
returning to full strength. With
the absence of Garrott, Mark
Semioli moved up to play midfield,
and Westergren anchored the de
fense.
However, he found himself in
an offensive role when, at the
12:54 mark, he put the ball by
the USC goalie for his first goal
of the year. Stanford had a 3-0
lead, and the game well in hand.
Senior Dave Thorpe commented
on the Cardinal's good start in a
game it was expected to win. "We
usually have trouble with games
like this, and we didn't know what
would happen. We had some good
shots at the beginning to get us
going — three great shots right
off." Thorpe assisted Caven's goal
for his 11th point of the year.
But Stanford was not through.

Mercy was not forthcoming from
a team that had scored six goals
in its last eleven games. Five
minutes into the second half,
Rhett Harty got his first goal
since the Cardinal was undefeated
at 6-0. Wade Colwell added the
assist, his first of two on the
weekend. Late in the game, Caven
added another goal, with an assist
by Bing Kongmebhol. The sopho
more tripled his season total to
three with the pair of scores.
Finally, Dave Thorpe ter
minated the massacre with his
fourth goal of the season, with
eleven-and-a-half minutes to go in
the game. Semioli made it happen,
feeding Thorpe unselfishly on the
right side for the tap-in.
Defensively, Stanford had little
trouble with the club-team
Trojans. But after eighty minutes,
there may have been a tendency

to letdown with the six goal cus
hion. USC's Martin Schlageter
grabbed a loose ball and converted
the easy chance, victimizing third
string goalkeeper Alan Thorpe
only moments after he entered the
game.
But Stanford had done what it
wanted to do. "The USC game
was a confidence builder," Semioli
said. "We were supposed to go out
and beat them badly, and we did."
But would it carry over to the
more difficult game, Sunday vs.
OSU? The Beavers had lost to
California 4-1 in Berkeley, but
Stanford was 0-3 (outscored 7-2)
on that field as well. The game
counted, and the Cardinal would
need to continue its offensive pro
duction.

a great pass by Harty. It was the
kind of goal Stanford couldn't
produce in its midseason drought,
but executed with ease this week

Porch had experienced a lengthy
dry spell after a good early
showing.
But the flurry of scoring that
had occured the day before was
not repeated, and Stanford went

lead.

Mark Semioli changed that in
a very short span. First, Dave
Thorpe returned the favor with a
quick one-two play that Semioli
blasted into the goal at the 58:48
mark. It was the two-time team
MVP's first goal not off a penalty
kick.
Only a minute later, he re
turned to his old ways, as a OSU
penalty gave Stanford a free kick.

who hadn't had a chance to play
much, so there was definitely a
lot of motivation there," Koch
said. "We wanted to play a lot of
the younger kids because you
know they want to play."
Andrew Westergren is not one
of the younger kids, but he was
making a rare start as well. The
senior fullback has been bothered
by a shoulder iryury the latter
half of the season, and is just
returning to full strength. With
the absence of Garrott, Mark
Semioli moved up to play midfield,
and Westergren anchored the de
fense.
However, he found himself in
an offensive role when, at the
12:54 mark, he put the ball by
the USC goalie for his first goal
of the year. Stanford had a 3-0
lead, and the game well in hand.
Senior Dave Thorpe commented
on the Cardinal's good start in a
game it was expected to win. "We
usually have trouble with games
like this, and we didn't know what
would happen. We had some good
shots at the beginning to get us
going — three great shots right
off." Thorpe assisted Caven's goal
for his 11th point of the year.
But Stanford was not through.

Mercy was not forthcoming from
a team that had scored six goals
in its last eleven games. Five
minutes into the second half,
Rhett Harty got his first goal
since the Cardinal was undefeated
at 6-0. Wade Colwell added the
assist, his first of two on the
weekend. Late in the game, Caven
added another goal, with an assist
by Bing Kongmebhol. The sopho
more tripled his season total to
three with the pair of scores.
Finally, Dave Thorpe ter
minated the massacre with his
fourth goal of the season, with
eleven-and-a-half minutes to go in
the game. Semioli made it happen,
feeding Thorpe unselfishly on the
right side for the tap-in.
Defensively, Stanford had little
trouble with the club-team
Trojans. But after eighty minutes,
there may have been a tendency

to letdown with the six goal cus
hion. USC's Martin Schlageter
grabbed a loose ball and converted
the easy chance, victimizing third
string goalkeeper Alan Thorpe
only moments after he entered the
game.
But Stanford had done what it
wanted to do. "The USC game
was a confidence builder," Semioli
said. "We were supposed to go out
and beat them badly, and we did."
But would it carry over to the
more difficult game, Sunday vs.
OSU? The Beavers had lost to
California 4-1 in Berkeley, but
Stanford was 0-3 (outscored 7-2)
on that field as well. The game
counted, and the Cardinal would
need to continue its offensive pro
duction.

lineup, and he answered the ques
tions fairly early with a goal off
a great pass by Harty. It was the
kind of goal Stanford couldn't
produce in its midseason drought,
but executed with ease this week
end. Like his counterpart Harty,
Porch had experienced a lengthy
dry spell after a good early
showing.
But the flurry of scoring that
had occured the day before was
not repeated, and Stanford went
into the half clinging to the 1-0
lead.

Mark Semioli changed that in
a very short span. First, Dave
Thorpe returned the favor with a
quick one-two play that Semioli
blasted into the goal at the 58:48
mark. It was the two-time team
MVP's first goal not off a penalty
kick.
Only a minute later, he re
turned to his old ways, as a OSU
penalty gave Stanford a free kick.
Semioli got his fifth goal of the
year with the shot.
Evan Nadler, whose play the
last few weeks has been consistent
and vital to the Cardinal attack,
responded to several referee
called offsides penalties with a
skillful header off a Wade Colwell
pass.
On Halloween weekend, it was
only fitting that the Stanford
men's soccer team turned
Maloney field into a haunted
house for inexperienced soccer
squads. The Cardinal crushed
young USC and Oregon State on
successive days, and in the process
revealed two features not seen
previously: the depth of its bench
and the ability to score in large
quantities.

The Stanford offense, which has
had extreme difficulty finding the
back of the net all year, scored
10 goals, with eight players con
tributing to that amazing output.
The defense was up to the task
as well, giving up only a late goal
to USC. The Cardinal took the
Trojans 6-1, and blanked the
Beavers 4-0.
Stanford won its second and
third games in a row, finishing
the home schedule with an 8-4
mark. Because the USC game was
an exhibition, the Cardinal's of
ficial record only jumps one notch
to 10-9 on the season.
Practicing up for Election Day,
the booters scored early and often

After Todd Caven opened up the
scoring with a nice goal four-and
