Women's Golf
Cardinal 7th in Stanford Invite

Competing in a field that was
unquestionably the most
talented that will be assembled
until the NCAA tournament
begins, the Cardinal women
placed a more-than-respectable
seventh out of 21 teams in the
Stanford Intercollegiate.
Finishing ahead of Stanford
were Oklahoma State, USC,
Tulsa, Arizona and Arizona
State, and San Jose State, all
teams that were ranked in the
Top 20 coming into the tour
nament, with all but San Jose
claiming spots in the Top 10.
The low individual scorer for
the tournament was Minneso
ta's Kate Hughes, who fired a
three-round total of 216 on the
par-73 course. Cathy Mockett
of Tulsa finished second with
218.
The Cardinal women
finished 22 strokes off of the
pace set by Oklahoma State,
which had a team total of 895.
USC and Tulsa had three-day

totals of 896 and 897, respec
tively.
Tim Baldwin, who had pre
dicted a top five finish for his
young squad, was nevertheless
pleased with his team's per
formance.
"To finish seventh in a field
this strong, on a golf course
that our three freshmen are
just getting to know, was ter
rific. We had really a very con
sistent performance.''
The Cardinal was led by
sophomore Jodi Figley and
freshman Stephanie Davis, who
had three round totals of 228
and 229, respectively. Despite
the low totals, the two women
were generally displeased with
their performances.
"My 76 today couldn't have
been any worse. I hit the ball
extremely well and putted
poorly," Davis said.
Coach Baldwin concurred
with Davis' assessment of her
putting and added that at this
stage of the season, "She just
doesn't know the course."
Jodi Figley also struggled
with her short game through
out the weekend. "I wanted to
do better than I did," the pre
season All-America said. "I
have been working on some
new things in my swing. I think
I'll do better in the next tour
nament."
Junior Stephanie Parel
finished with two strong
rounds of 75-75 to total 232 *
