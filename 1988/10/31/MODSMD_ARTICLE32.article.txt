# Volleyball vanquishes foes again

### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
SEATTLE, Wash. — On a rare pre
cipitation-free day in Seattle, the sun
shone on the Stanford women's volley
ball team. The Cardinal, fresh off a
Friday night win at Washington State,
defeated llth-ranked Washington 15-7,
15-13, 11-15, 15-13 Saturday

Although Stanford's 15-13, 15-9, 15-
12 win over the Cougars was expected,
the Cardinal coaching staff was a little
worried about facing the Huskies, a
team that came into the match with a
7-0 home record.
"I know they're a real good team,"
Stanford Coach Don Shaw said. "We
had a battle tonight — just what I
expected."
Stanford, the nation's second-ranked
team, is now 21-1 on the season, 12-1
in the Pacific 10 Conference. The
Huskies, in third place in the Pac-10

standings at 8-4, are 14-5 overall, while
WSU is 18-14, 2-10 in league after fall
ing to California in five games Saturday.
The two victories also allowed the
Cardinal to extend its school-record
consecutive-win streak to 16, two more
than Stanford teams won consecutively
in both 1985 and 1987.
The Cardinal, despite being in the
midst of the winning streak, had been
in something of a slump lately, strug
gling to beat clearly inferior teams from
Arizona, Arizona State, San Jose State
and Washington State in the last week.
In the victory in front of a
Washington-record crowd of 986 in the
Hec Edmundson Pavilion Addition,
however, the Cardinal displayed the
form that has made it a winner in 20
of 21 contests.
"We've been in a slump," Shaw said.
"Hopefully this'll get us out of it."
Outside hitter Jennifer Chaffee
agreed. "Tonight was our start at get
ting out of it," she said. "Tuesday night
at Berkeley . . we'll take it to 'em."
A balanced attack was the reason for
Stanford's success both nights. Fresh
man middle blocker Amy Cooper had
nine kills to lead the way against the

Cougars but Jennifer Chaffee, Laura
Olesen and Kristin Klein each had eight.
Defensively, Cheryl Conly had 10 digs
to lead the team while Chaffee and
Cooper had nine apiece.
Saturday night was much the same
as five Cardinal players reached double
figures in kills. Laura Olesen led the
way with 15, while Klein had 13, Chaf
fee 12, Amy Hayes 11 and Cooper 10.
Klein had a match-high 23 digs against
the Huskies and Hayes added 22.
The Cardinal was able to get out to
early leads, going up five or six to zero
in each of the four games, but Wash
ington never gave in, fighting back to
salvage the third game and almost
taking the second and fourth.
But on the fourth match point the
Huskies' star, Laurie Wetzel, hit the
ball into the antenna and the match
was over.
"We haven't been playing well," Chaf
fee said, "but we came out and had
some flashes of what we can do."
Wetzel did finish with 21 kills, but
hit only .200, while Mountain View
product Gail Thorpe was the only other

Senior Laura Oleaon had 15 kills and hit a stellar .393 to lead the Cardinal to a 3-1
victory over Washington Saturday night.
Husky in double figures, tallying
10.
Another local, Los Altos'
Melinda Beckenhauer, led UW
with 18 digs but it was not enough
to stop the Cardinal.
Husky Coach Debbie Buse was
still happy with her team's per
formance, though. "I'm real
pleased," she said. "I thought we
played real well. . . . We've got to
get out of the starting blocks a
little quicker. . . . (But) we're play
ing good volleyball.

"We beat the team this weekend
that we were supposed to (Cal),"
Buse continued. "We definitely
showed we can compete with
Stanford."
Shaw was also pleased. "I think
we came out pretty much on top
of things," he said. "I think we
controlled the match but we got
into streaks of bad passing where
we gave up a lot of points. You
have to give credit to Washington,
too."
The Cardinal now looks for con
secutive win No. 17 Tuesday night
against the Golden Bears in
Berkeley. Hopefully out of the
midseason downslide, Stanford is
gearing up for a rematch with

top-ranked UCLA — the only
team to beat Stanford this season
— in Los Angeles on Nov. 17, and
the NCAA tournament.
"I think actually that this
match helped get us back into it,"
settter Lara Asper said. "I think
this is where we have to start
improving every match."
Card notes
The Huskies set a record for the
largest crowd to attend a women's
volleyball match at UW, but the crowd
of 986 was only 27 more than Stan
ford's home average. The crowd was
also outyelled at times by a group of
about eight Stanford fans.

"We beat the team this weekend
that we were supposed to (Cal),"
Buse continued. "We definitely
showed we can compete with
Stanford."
Shaw was also pleased. "I think
we came out pretty much on top
of things," he said. "I think we
controlled the match but we got
into streaks of bad passing where
we gave up a lot of points. You
have to give credit to Washington,
too."
The Cardinal now looks for con
secutive win No. 17 Tuesday night
against the Golden Bears in
Berkeley. Hopefully out of the
midseason downslide, Stanford is
gearing up for a rematch with

top-ranked UCLA — the only
team to beat Stanford this season
— in Los Angeles on Nov. 17, and
the NCAA tournament.
"I think actually that this
match helped get us back into it,"
settter Lara Asper said. "I think
this is where we have to start
improving every match."

The Huskies set a record for the
largest crowd to attend a women's
volleyball match at UW, but the crowd
of 986 was only 27 more than Stan
ford's home average. The crowd was
also outyelled at times by a group of
about eight Stanford fans.
SEATTLE, Wash. — On a rare pre
cipitation-free day in Seattle, the sun
shone on the Stanford women's volley
ball team. The Cardinal, fresh off a
Friday night win at Washington State,
defeated llth-ranked Washington 15-7,
15-13, 11-15, 15-13 Saturday

Although Stanford's 15-13, 15-9, 15-
12 win over the Cougars was expected,
the Cardinal coaching staff was a little
worried about facing the Huskies, a
team that came into the match with a
7-0 home record.
"I know they're a real good team,"
Stanford Coach Don Shaw said. "We
had a battle tonight — just what I
expected."
Stanford, the nation's second-ranked
team, is now 21-1 on the season, 12-1
in the Pacific 10 Conference. The
Huskies, in third place in the Pac-10

standings at 8-4, are 14-5 overall, while
WSU is 18-14, 2-10 in league after fall
ing to California in five games Saturday.
The two victories also allowed the
Cardinal to extend its school-record
consecutive-win streak to 16, two more
than Stanford teams won consecutively
in both 1985 and 1987.
The Cardinal, despite being in the
midst of the winning streak, had been
in something of a slump lately, strug
gling to beat clearly inferior teams from
Arizona, Arizona State, San Jose State
and Washington State in the last week.
In the victory in front of a
Washington-record crowd of 986 in the
Hec Edmundson Pavilion Addition,
however, the Cardinal displayed the
form that has made it a winner in 20
of 21 contests.
"We've been in a slump," Shaw said.
"Hopefully this'll get us out of it."
Outside hitter Jennifer Chaffee
agreed. "Tonight was our start at get
ting out of it," she said. "Tuesday night
at Berkeley . . we'll take it to 'em."
A balanced attack was the reason for
Stanford's success both nights. Fresh
man middle blocker Amy Cooper had
nine kills to lead the way against the

Cougars but Jennifer Chaffee, Laura
Olesen and Kristin Klein each had eight.
Defensively, Cheryl Conly had 10 digs
to lead the team while Chaffee and
Cooper had nine apiece.
Saturday night was much the same
as five Cardinal players reached double
figures in kills. Laura Olesen led the
way with 15, while Klein had 13, Chaf
fee 12, Amy Hayes 11 and Cooper 10.
Klein had a match-high 23 digs against
the Huskies and Hayes added 22.
The Cardinal was able to get out to
early leads, going up five or six to zero
in each of the four games, but Wash
ington never gave in, fighting back to
salvage the third game and almost
taking the second and fourth.
But on the fourth match point the
Huskies' star, Laurie Wetzel, hit the
ball into the antenna and the match
was over.
"We haven't been playing well," Chaf
fee said, "but we came out and had
some flashes of what we can do."
Wetzel did finish with 21 kills, but
hit only .200, while Mountain View
product Gail Thorpe was the only other

Senior Laura Oleaon had 15 kills and hit a stellar .393 to lead the Cardinal to a 3-1

10.
Another local, Los Altos'
Melinda Beckenhauer, led UW
with 18 digs but it was not enough
to stop the Cardinal.
Husky Coach Debbie Buse was
still happy with her team's per
formance, though. "I'm real
pleased," she said. "I thought we
played real well. . . . We've got to
get out of the starting blocks a
little quicker. . . . (But) we're play
