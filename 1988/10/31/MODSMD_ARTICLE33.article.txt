# Card shoots down Pilots, 2-0
## Strikers look toward NCAA tournament 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
Senior Day arrived at Harry
Maloney Field on Saturday as
Stanford women's soccer team
members Carolyn Denney, Beth
Egan, Stacey Keare, and Christy
McDevitt all played their last
home game in the Cardinal and
white. The result of the game
against the University of
Portland, a 2-0 Stanford victory,
meshed nicely with the festive at
mosphere that the seniors'
farewell offered.

Women's Soccer
Cardinal 2, Lady Pilots 0

Banners hung around the Stan
ford bench. Underclassmen pre
sented the seniors with roses. All
four of the seniors played together
on the turf of Maloney Field, for
one final time, for the majority
of the second half. Many of the
departing Cardinal had family
members on hand.
Everything went smoothly in
the seniors' final outing at Stan
ford. But was this really the last
home game for the Cardinal soccer
program this season? All of Sat
urday's festivities will seem more
or less meaningless if the Cardinal
plays an NCAA Tournament game
on the Farm. Granted, a home
field appearance for the Cardinal
in the postseason is unlikely. But,

if Stanford receives a number-one
seed in the west, it would play on
home turf.
Saturday's game against the
Lady Pilots of Portland had Car
dinal soccer fans a little worried
in the early going; the Pilots
played confidently, displaying
passing that was especially crisp.
In the late stages of the first half
though, Cardinal sharpshooters
Tonya Antonucci and Kim Peter
sen picked apart Pilot goalkeeper
Gwen Thompson for two quick
scores. After the Cardinal's goals,
Stanford never looked back in
running away with a tidy, two
goal victory.
Antonucci's goal, coming at
31:24, broke the game open for
the Stanford team, which, prior
to her score, was playing a very
tense and tight game. Her goal
also broke the ice for her individ
ually; Antonucci, last year's team
leader in goals scored, has been
very quiet on the offensive end
for the Cardinal throughout the
1988 season.
Antonucci explained her feeling
about the game-winning goal: "Of
course it felt great. But I haven't
been frustrated at all on offense.
Other people have really picked
it up offensively, and that gives
me a very good feeling when we're
looking for those wins. Everybody
likes to score goals. But, as long
as the team is winning, can I com
plain?"
Antonucci's unselfish attitude
is admirable. More importantly,

though, her score may have
prevented the Cardinal from let
ting a tough Portland team steal
the match. Sensing a weakened
opponent and an imminent victory
after Antonucci's goal, the Cardi
nal went on a ferocious, offensive
attack that lasted until the end
of the half.
Kim Petersen polished off the
Pilots when she looped a high
arching shot from outside the
penalty box. Her "Hail Mary" shot
embarrassed the stumbling Pilot
goalkeeper and provided Stanford
with a comfortable two-goal
halftime margin that would stand
for the match's duration.
Senior Stacey Keare was willing
to comment on the sentimental
aspects of Senior Day, but she too
was quick to mention the team's
excellent shot at a postseason ap
pearance. "Today was great. If it
all ends after next weekend's
[away] game, we'll feel OK. What
a way to go out! We've played so
well, and it's a great feeling to
have witnessed the building of the
Stanford soccer program. Of
course, something will seem like
it's missing if we don't continue
to play in the postseason. In past
years, we've known that [the
season] would end when the reg
ular season ended. This year, we
definitely feel like we should go
on."
An investigation of Stanford's
actual chances for an NCAA bid
seems appropriate. Of course, the
Cardinal team members all feel

like they should get a tournament
spot. However, several have
conceded that they probably only
have a 50-50 shot. Coach Berhane
Andeberhan has also displayed a
certain lack of faith in the NCAA's
selection system.
The NCAA has announced the
use of a system that will send the
one best team from each of the
country's four regions and an ad
ditional eight at-large teams. An

deberhan feels, despite his team's
great late-season play, that the
Cardinal probably will not receive
the western region's No. 1 seed.
Consequently, the squad's chances
hinge on receiving an at-large bid.
The notion of resting the team's
hopes on a subjectively deter
mined selection is scary, to say
the least.
The Stanford team, however, is
maintaining a healthy attitude

throughout the selection ordeal.
Coach Andeberhan explains the
team's approach to the difficult
situation: "We feel that we have
done everything we can do; it's
out of our hands now. We've
beaten everybody we had to beat,
and we've reached 14th in the
nation. I certainly could not have
asked for a better performance
from these girls. We'll just sit back
and hope."

Consequently, the squad's chances
hinge on receiving an at-large bid.
The notion of resting the team's
hopes on a subjectively deter
mined selection is scary, to say
the least.
The Stanford team, however, is
maintaining a healthy attitude

throughout the selection ordeal.
Coach Andeberhan explains the
team's approach to the difficult
situation: "We feel that we have
done everything we can do; it's
out of our hands now. We've
beaten everybody we had to beat,
and we've reached 14th in the
nation. I certainly could not have
asked for a better performance
from these girls. We'll just sit back
and hope."

Sophomore midfielder Denise Denney and the Cardinal women's soccer team passed by the Portland
Lady Pilots by a score of 2-0 on Saturday.
Senior Day arrived at Harry
Maloney Field on Saturday as
Stanford women's soccer team
members Carolyn Denney, Beth
Egan, Stacey Keare, and Christy
McDevitt all played their last
home game in the Cardinal and
white. The result of the game
against the University of
Portland, a 2-0 Stanford victory,
meshed nicely with the festive at
mosphere that the seniors'
farewell offered.

Women's Soccer
Cardinal 2, Lady Pilots 0

Banners hung around the Stan
ford bench. Underclassmen pre
sented the seniors with roses. All
four of the seniors played together
on the turf of Maloney Field, for
one final time, for the majority
of the second half. Many of the
departing Cardinal had family
members on hand.
Everything went smoothly in
the seniors' final outing at Stan
ford. But was this really the last
home game for the Cardinal soccer
program this season? All of Sat
urday's festivities will seem more
or less meaningless if the Cardinal
plays an NCAA Tournament game
on the Farm. Granted, a home
field appearance for the Cardinal
in the postseason is unlikely. But,

if Stanford receives a number-one
seed in the west, it would play on
home turf.
Saturday's game against the
Lady Pilots of Portland had Car
dinal soccer fans a little worried
in the early going; the Pilots
played confidently, displaying
passing that was especially crisp.
In the late stages of the first half
though, Cardinal sharpshooters
Tonya Antonucci and Kim Peter
sen picked apart Pilot goalkeeper
Gwen Thompson for two quick
scores. After the Cardinal's goals,
Stanford never looked back in
running away with a tidy, two
goal victory.
Antonucci's goal, coming at
31:24, broke the game open for
the Stanford team, which, prior
to her score, was playing a very
tense and tight game. Her goal
also broke the ice for her individ
ually; Antonucci, last year's team
leader in goals scored, has been
very quiet on the offensive end
for the Cardinal throughout the
1988 season.
Antonucci explained her feeling
about the game-winning goal: "Of
course it felt great. But I haven't
been frustrated at all on offense.
Other people have really picked
it up offensively, and that gives
me a very good feeling when we're
looking for those wins. Everybody
likes to score goals. But, as long
as the team is winning, can I com
plain?"
Antonucci's unselfish attitude
is admirable. More importantly,

though, her score may have
prevented the Cardinal from let
ting a tough Portland team steal
the match. Sensing a weakened
opponent and an imminent victory
after Antonucci's goal, the Cardi
nal went on a ferocious, offensive
attack that lasted until the end
of the half.
Kim Petersen polished off the
Pilots when she looped a high
arching shot from outside the
penalty box. Her "Hail Mary" shot
embarrassed the stumbling Pilot
goalkeeper and provided Stanford
with a comfortable two-goal
halftime margin that would stand
for the match's duration.
Senior Stacey Keare was willing
to comment on the sentimental
aspects of Senior Day, but she too
was quick to mention the team's
excellent shot at a postseason ap
pearance. "Today was great. If it
all ends after next weekend's
[away] game, we'll feel OK. What
a way to go out! We've played so
well, and it's a great feeling to
have witnessed the building of the
Stanford soccer program. Of
course, something will seem like
it's missing if we don't continue
to play in the postseason. In past
years, we've known that [the
season] would end when the reg
ular season ended. This year, we
definitely feel like we should go
on."
An investigation of Stanford's
actual chances for an NCAA bid
seems appropriate. Of course, the
Cardinal team members all feel

like they should get a tournament
spot. However, several have
conceded that they probably only
have a 50-50 shot. Coach Berhane
Andeberhan has also displayed a
certain lack of faith in the NCAA's
selection system.
The NCAA has announced the
use of a system that will send the
one best team from each of the
country's four regions and an ad
ditional eight at-large teams. An

deberhan feels, despite his team's
great late-season play, that the
Cardinal probably will not receive
the western region's No. 1 seed.
