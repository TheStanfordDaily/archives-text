Move over, Steffi — it's
Stanford's turn for a Slam.
Placing three players and a
doubles team into the semifinal
round, the Stanford women's
tennis team validated the
NCAA title it defended last
spring by dominating at the
Women's All-America Tennis
Championships in Los Angeles,
the first leg of the Collegiate
Grand Slam.
The singles title went to
sophomore Tami Whitlinger,
who defeated classmate Sandra
Birch 6-3, 6-0 in the all-
Stanford final. Whitlinger is
currently ranked fourth on the
Volvo/ITCA poll and was the
tournament's second seed,
while Birch holds the No. 14
spot.
To reach the final match,
Birch upset teammate Lisa
Green, the fourth seed and No.
6 on the poll, in a straight-set
7-5, 6-2 victory. Whitlinger had
a tougher time, taking three
sets to best third-seeded Sonia
Hahn from Kentucky 6-1, 2-6,
6-1.
A complete Cardinal sweep

was cut short in the doubles
semifinal Saturday, when
Jackie Booth and Danielle
Jones of Oklahoma State upset
the top-seeded pair of Whit
linger and her twin sister Teri
7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 6-2. The OSU
duo subsequently fell in the
final to a team from Indiana.
As a whole, however, the
Stanford team lived up to its
unanimous No.l ranking in the
Volvo poll. The team will con
tinue its pursuit of the singles
Grand Slam and its first dou
bles title of the year at the
DuPont National Clay Court
Championships, to be held Dec.
2-4.
