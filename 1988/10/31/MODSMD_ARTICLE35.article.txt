### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Stanford's cross-country teams
will go trick-or-treating early
today at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships. The Stanford
men's team is poised to win its
second Pac-10 Championship ever
and Carol Gray will attempt to
win the women's event at Stan
ford Golf Course at 10 a.m.
The men's team has been strong
this season, and based on its con
vincing win at the Stanford Invi
tational, it will be the team to
beat. "Stanford has an excellent
team this year," commented Cal
ifornia coach Jack Marsd after his
squad was dismantled in the
Stanford-Cal dual meet. The top
challengers in the men's 10-
kilometer race will be Washington
and Oregon.
Senior captain James Al
borough was the number-one man
last year, finishing 14th in 31:29.
The Cardinal will have several
athletes in front this time. In ad
dition to Alborough, the revi
talized Mastalir duo of Mark and
Eric will be joining the fray.
Transfer Steve Miller, who won
the Berkeley dual meet, has been
an impressive prize since trans
ferring from Northwestern. In ad
dition, freshman Dave Scudamore
has been a solid fifth man.

The main threat in the women's
5,000 meters will be junior Carol
Gray. A multiple-All America,
Gray took the Stanford Invita
tional 5,000 and will be as good
a bet as any in a race that has
been forcast as very competitive.
Gray will be up against a field
led by Penny Graves and Liz Wil
son from last year's NCAA Cham
pion Oregon. Gray qualified for
the United States 10K Olympic
trials last spring and has the tal
ent to run with anyone.
Brooks Johnson, director of
Stanford's running program, pre
dicted that this year would be a
strong one. "Given decent health,
I think this year will mark the
return to prominence of the Stan
ford cross country program. And
that means that both teams have
the potential to qualify for the
NCAA Championships."
The 1 women have a trio of re
turning sophmores. Melanie Bloch
should improve on last year's 14th
place finish. Wendy Neely and
Jamie Fallon also return from last
year's squad.
Men's coach Scott Chisam is
highly optimistic, and with good
reason. "I'm pleased, but not
really surprised by the team's per
formance this year," he said. Last
year, the team needed five men
under 31:30 to win. This year it
has them.
