# Audience relates to rally

Emphasizing the connection between
prominent concerns at Stanford and na
tional issues, the Rev. Jesse Jackson's
speech Friday afternoon in White Plaza hit
home for many who attended.
"The speech was really good in address
ing both national and international
priorities (and) being able to speak directly
to the Stanford community," said Asst.
Dean of Student Affairs Keith Archuleta,
who spoke prior to Jackson on the social
climate here.
Archuleta said Jackson's comments that
the president can set a "moral tone" for
the country should also be applied to Stan
ford.
"Jesse was speaking about the role that
leaders can play in terms of setting an
atmosphere of trust and working together.
Students and administration can also come
together under that umbrella of working
together," he said.
Council of Presidents member Miguel

M&rquez added that the COP often meets
resistance about taking positions on certain
issues. "Jackson explained that it is good
to work for positive, progressive change
and that it i3 going to be hard because
we're going to meet resistance."
By placing racism in a national perspec
tive, Jackson was particularly effective in
addressing his audience, according to
Ujamaa Resident Fellow Michael Britt.
"Jackson showed that these are not iso
lated incidents that take place. He is right
in stating this is a national phenomenon
and we send a tone nationally by sending
people to office who say that this behavior
is acceptable," Britt said.
In his speech, Jackson suggested the in
clusion of ethnic studies as one approach
to solving the problem. An ethnic studies
requirement is one of the nine demands
the Coalition of Color posted on University
President Donald Kennedy's door last week.
"The speech gives us in the coalition
more strength to continue our struggle and


April Pearson — Dally
gives people a chance to think
about the issues who never
thought of them before," accord
ing to MEChA member Jon Inda,
who spoke before Jackson.
MEChA is a Chicano student
group.
But Assoc. History Prof.
Clayborne Carson, who has atten
ded several of Jackson's speeches,
was not as optimistic about any
potential effects the speech may
have on campus.
"Neither the administration
nor the students should need Jesse
Jackson to tell them that racism
is still a problem here or else
where," Carson said. "Actually, he
made many of the same points
last time he was here, about

multi-ethnic studies and racism.
That's the general theme of his
campaign."
Carson has a "special feeling"
for Jackson because the latter
came to Stanford two years ago
to rally student support for Car
son's alternative Western Culture
track, now called Cultures, Ideas
and Values. CIV will become a
permanent part of the Stanford
curriculum next year.
Carson said Jackson is the "one
candidate who is speaking out
strongly on important national is
sues."
The primary campaign between
Jackson and Gov. Michael Duka
kis was on a "higher level" and
had a "cleaner tone," according
to Carson, than the general elec
tion campaign, which has focused
on personal attacks rather than
on the issues themselves.
"It just reflects Jesse's commit
ment to social change.
