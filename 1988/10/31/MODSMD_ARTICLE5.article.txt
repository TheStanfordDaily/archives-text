At an emotional rally about
abortion in Sunnyvale, activists
on both sides of the issue clashed
Saturday, resulting in the arrest
of five Stanford students and
staff, who are all anti-abortionists.
The rally began as an anti
abortion demonstration, spon
sored by the organization Opera
tion Rescue, outside the Family
Planning Alternatives clinic in
Sunnyvale. According to the Sun
nyvale police, over 400 pro-life
supporters, 12 of whom were from
Stanford, attended the rally,
which was organized as part of a
32-state protest.

President Jennifer Bryson, an
anti-abortionist, said Operation
Rescue's purpose in staging the
event was to close down the clinic
and publicize the pro-life position.
Bryson said Operation Rescue
members tried to persuade the
clients against abortion.
In reaction to the pro-life rally,
Bay Area Coalition Against Oper
ation Rescue sent 30 members to
all of the abortion clinics in the
area that could possibly be at
tacked by the pro-life ralliers, in
cluding the Sunnyvale clinic, ac
cording to senior Karen Bernstein,
a pro-choice supporter.
Pro-choice activists support the

woman's right to decide whether
she wants an abortion. Pro-life
activists believe that the fetus is
a human being and therefore that
abortion is tantamount to murder.
Though 70 Stanford students
were positioned at two other
clinics in San Jose, none of the
Stanford students were originally
sent to guard the clinic in Sun
nyvale.
At 6:30 a.m., Stanford students
arrived at the two clinics not
protested by Operation Rescue,
according to Bernstein. "When we
heard that the Sunnyvale clinic
was being attacked, everyone
moved to Sunnyvale."
According to Bryson, the 400
Operation Rescue people forced
out the approximately 30 non-
Stanford pro-choice volunteers
and clinic staff who were defend
ing the entrances to the clinic.
The anti-abortionists sat down in
front of the doorways preventing
anyone from coming in, Bryson
said.
Although Operation Rescue's
stated policy is non-violent,
Bryson conceded that there was
some pushing and shoving when
Operation Rescue people origi
nally positioned themselves. "Ten
sions between (the two groups)
were clearly high," she said.
At 7:30 a.m., the first group of
Stanford students arrived at the
clinic in Sunnyvale to come face
to face with the pro-life ralliers,
Bernstein confirmed.
According to Bernstein, with
the entrances already taken by
Operation Rescue protestors, pro
choice supporters formed a picket
line in the parking lot next to the
clinic to protest the demonstra
tion. "We wanted to inform clients
coming to the clinic that they
could go to other clinics in the
area," Bernstein said.
Sarah Bryer, coordinator of the
Stanford Women's Center said
that all 16 scheduled abortions at
the targeted clinic were moved to
other clinics.
At 9 a.m., the Sunnyvale police
arrived and began arresting pro

life ralliers because they were pre
venting the normal functions of
the clinic. The pro-choice protes
tors were kept off the property
by police lines.
According to the Sunnyvale
police department, co-terminal
student Andrew Corr, sophomore
Janice Keen, sophomore Joyce
Keen, fourth-year graduate stu
dent Jim Roche and teaching fel
low Howard Bromberg were ar
rested for trespassing, a mis
demeanor, at the incident.
In all 251 anti-abortion protes
tors were detained, while no pro
choice activists were arrested.
Most of the pro-lifers who were
arrested were released after proc
essing, which took about five
hours, according to Corr.
