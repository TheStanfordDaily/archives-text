At an emotional rally about
abortion in Sunnyvale, activists
on both sides of the issue clashed
Saturday, resulting in the arrest
of five Stanford students and
staff, who are all anti-abortionists.
The rally began as an anti
abortion demonstration, spon
sored by the organization Opera
tion Rescue, outside the Family
Planning Alternatives clinic in
Sunnyvale. According to the Sun
nyvale police, over 400 pro-life
supporters, 12 of whom were from
Stanford, attended the rally,
which was organized as part of a
32-state protest.

President Jennifer Bryson, an
anti-abortionist, said Operation
Rescue's purpose in staging the
event was to close down the clinic
and publicize the pro-life position.
Bryson said Operation Rescue
members tried to persuade the
clients against abortion.
In reaction to the pro-life rally,
Bay Area Coalition Against Oper
ation Rescue sent 30 members to
all of the abortion clinics in the
area that could possibly be at
tacked by the pro-life ralliers, in
cluding the Sunnyvale clinic, ac
cording to senior Karen Bernstein,
a pro-choice supporter.
Pro-choice activists support the

woman's right to decide whether
she wants an abortion. Pro-life
activists believe that the fetus is
a human being and therefore that
abortion is tantamount to murder.
Though 70 Stanford students
were positioned at two other
clinics in San Jose, none of the
Stanford students were originally
sent to guard the clinic in Sun
nyvale.
At 6:30 a.m., Stanford students
arrived at the two clinics not
protested by Operation Rescue,
according to Bernstein. "When we
heard that the Sunnyvale clinic
was being attacked, everyone
moved to Sunnyvale."
According to Bryson, the 400
Operation Rescue people forced
out the approximately 30 non-
Stanford pro-choice volunteers
and clinic staff who were defend
ing the entrances to the clinic.
The anti-abortionists sat down in
front of the doorways preventing
anyone from coming in, Bryson
said.
Although Operation Rescue's
stated policy is non-violent,
Bryson conceded that there was
some pushing and shoving when
Operation Rescue people origi
nally positioned themselves. "Ten
sions between (the two groups)
were clearly high," she said.
