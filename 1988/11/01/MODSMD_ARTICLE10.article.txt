### Brad Hayward Staff writer 
It was a case of misinterpretation and
over-reaction. And it ended with the Bay
Area press corps flocking to Stanford
for a press conference that never hap
pened.
David Vigil, a senior in symbolic sys
tems, said University President Donald
Kennedy has not adequately responded
to recent campus issues such as racism.
Vigil wanted to tell Kennedy this, in
person.
"I wanted to suggest that to avoid
some of the misinformation going
around, he should say more specific
things about what he is doing and isn't
doing," Vigil said.
The senior decided to contact Asst.
Dean of Residential Education Diana
Conklin, who is a friend, according to
Vigil, and who "knows how to get things
done and cares about the issues I do."
Kennedy and Conklin were unavail

able for comment yesterday.
Vigil said Conklin agreed to meet with
him yesterday at 3:30 p.m. Vigil said
she also agreed to meet with represen
tatives of several campus organizations,
including leaders from the ASSU and
members of the Students of Color Coa
lition.
The Students of Color Coalition is
composed of a group of students from
the Asian American Student Association,
the Black Student Union, Stanford
American Indian Organization and
MEChA, a Chicano student group.
Vigil then called Bay Cities News Serv
ice to tell them about the meeting. Be
cause Vigil mentioned the BSU and Stu
dents of Color Coalition, the news serv
ice, aware of the recent racial incidents
on campus, put the announcement on
the newswire.
The announcement was picked up by
Bay Area newspapers and TV stations,

which began calling Conklin about
the "news conference" she would
be holding.
According to Vigil, after ex
plaining that no conference would
be held, Conklin canceled her
meeting with him. At the time of
the meeting the Row Housing Of

fice, where she works, was closed.
Meanwhile, Vigil said he
learned at this time the campus
organizations were not prepared
to participate in the meeting.
According to ASSU Council of
Presidents member Miguel
M&rquez, Vigil had left a confus
ing message on M&rquez's phone
machine over the weekend, which
M&rquez did not respond to. At
2 p.m. yesterday, Vigil arrived at
the ASSU office, asking for sup
port at the news conference,

Mdrquez explained.
"I told [Vigil] I did not know
what was going on," Mdrquez
said.
Just before 3:30 p.m. yesterday,
the media started arriving at the
Row Housing Office. Among those
represented were the San Fran
cisco Chronicle, the San Jose Mer
cury News, the Times Tribune,
and KRON-TV. Vigil soon arrived,
also.
But there was no press confer
ence. No meeting. No story. . ..
