UC may get 3 new campuses
Warning of an expected surge in student en
rollment, UC President David Gardner asked the
University of California Board of Regents yester
day to approve the creation of three new UC
campuses.
Gardner proposed the $1.1 billion project at a
regents meeting devoted to long range planning.
No specific sites will be chosen for the campuses
until the plan is approved by the regents, Gardner
said.
Total enrollment on the university's nine cam
puses, currently at 154,000, is expected to grow
to 217,000 in 2005. Existing campuses will only
be able to handle an additional 40,000 before
they reach capacity.

UCLA takes stand against racism
UCLA administrators took a stand against ra
cial and sexual harassment a week ago Thursday
by issuing an interim policy and preliminary ac
tion plan that could dismiss violators from the
university.
The policy, drafted by the Division of Student

Affairs, describes disciplinary procedures to be
taken in cases of physical abuse, threats of vio
lence and sexual harassment. It will pertain to
individual students rather than specific organi
zations.

UCLA faces Roble-esque problems
A earthquake may occur in Los Angeles
within 30 years, but because of a lack of funding,
the completion date of UCLA's on-campus seismic
renovations is still unknown.
UCLA needs approximately $115 million to
strengthen its state-owned buildings, many of
which were built in the 1920s and 19305, said
Sam Aroni, chair of the UCLA Joint Academic
Senate-Administration Earthquake Safety Com
mittee. While some housing and parking struc
tures on campus are already being improved, the
university must garner funds before the long
process of construction can begin on state-owned
buildings.
UCLA's original appeal for state support — a
request for one lump sum to upgrade 37 struc
tures in seven years — was rejected by the state
budget committee. 77, e Dai!y Bruin
