# Eshoo rally 'unmasks' Campbell

### Julie Kuhlken 
Playing on the Halloween
theme, Anna Eshoo, Democratic
candidate for the 12th congres
sional district, and members of
the Stanford College Democrats
staged a rally celebrating the "un
masking of Tom Campbell" yes
terday at noon in White Plaza.
Campbell, a Stanford law pro
fessor, is the Republican candi
date in the race for the Silicon
Valley district.
Four members of the Stanford
Democrats wore masks represent
ing issues such as civil rights and
the homeless. One by one, the
students stepped forward and
stated the Republican Party line
on these issues, then removed the

masks and asked, "Is this a trick
or a treat?"
Each time the enthusiastic au
dience of nearly one hundred
people responded, "A trick!"
Without a prepared speech, Es
hoo, a San Mateo county super
visor, verbally berated Campbell.
She attacked his stance on the
central issues of the contest, in
cluding what Eshoo perceives as
Campbell's poor record on wom
en's issues, citing his support for
Robert Bork's nomination for Su
preme Court Justice.
Eshoo also criticized Campbell's
opposition to a higher minimum
wage and what she sees as the
Republican Party's lack of action
on environmental issues.
She asserted that whereas the

Republicans were the trick, "she
was the treat."
Paul Rothstein, a representative
of the Campbell campaign, said
the rally was "warm and fuzzy,"
but did not address the issues.
He cited the Bork issue, saying
the association has been "over
blown" and just another example
of the "vague generalities" upon
which Eshoo has based her cam
paign.
Accenting the light-hearted
spirit of the rally, the "Quail Fam
ily Singers," composed of SLAC
workers and their families,
preceded Eshoo, parodying
Quayle's ineptitude with lines
such as, "My grades in college
weren't so high/So I found a law
school my dad could buy."
