## Dukakis embraces 'L' word Bush accuses him of flip-flopping on liberal issue 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - In a
brief phrase, Michael Dukakis has
embraced the label he artfully
dodged for months, the "L" word
that Republicans have used as a
club against him.
"I'm a liberal," the Democratic
presidential nominee said in Cal
ifornia on Sunday, "in the tradi
tion of Franklin Roosevelt and
Harry Truman and John Ken
nedy."
It was a statement some had
been urging Dukakis to make, a
defense of values as well as a po
litical point of view long associated
with Democratic Party successes
of old — and Democratic failures
of late.
But it was also viewed by Dem
ocrats themselves as a high-risk
move by a candidate who trails
nearly everywhere and has little
choice but to roll the dice.
George Bush and the Republi
cans moved swiftly yesterday to
capitalize on what they depicted
as a misstep.
"After months of denying he
was a liberal, Dukakis conceded
that he is one," Bush campaign
manager Lee Atwater said. "This

is worse than a flip-flop. This is
a gaffe bigger than putting him
self in that tank."
Bush sarcastically said:
"Miracle of miracles."
Dukakis spokesman Mark
Gearan countered that Dukakis
was merely advancing his "I'm on
your side" argument, and assert
ing that it is he and not Bush
who is in the tradition of those
popular Democratic presidents.
Dukakis' statement was one he
had seemed reluctant to make
when given opportunities earlier
in the campaign.
In his second debate with Bush,
Dukakis quipped: "If I had a dol
lar, George, for every time you
used that label, I'd qualify for one
of those tax breaks for the rich
that you want to give away."
Dukakis has repeatedly as
serted that such labels are mean
ingless and said he has conserva
tive instincts as well. He points
to his balanced budgets in Mas
sachusetts as proof.
In his interview on ABC's
"Nightline" last week, Dukakis
said, "Bush is trying to misuse
that label in a way which suggests

that I'm somebody who doesn't
have a set of values."
Dukakis' reluctance to embrace
what President Reagan has taken
to calling "the *L' word" was
hardly surprising. Poll after poll
suggest it's no longer fashionable
to call yourself liberal.
Polls consistently show only
about 15 percent of the electorate
accept that label to describe them
selves — even though many more
may take "liberal" positions on
specific issues.
A CBS-New York Times poll
taken Oct. 8-10 was typical. It
found 17 percent saying they were
liberal, 34 percent saying they
were conservative, and 43 percent
identifying themselves as
moderate.
Also telling was a Louis Harris
poll taken Oct. 14-17, in which
49 percent of those surveyed
agreed with the statement that
Dukakis is "too liberal to get my
vote."
President Reagan, whose eight
years have seen a growth in voter
identification with conservatives,
has been hammering Dukakis
with the liberal cudgel.
