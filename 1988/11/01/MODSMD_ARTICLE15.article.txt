NEW YORK (AP) - Imelda
Marcos pleaded innocent yester
day to racketeering charges for
allegedly helping her husband,
deposed Philippine President Fer
dinand Marcos, plunder $100 mil
lion from their country's treasury.
U.S. District Judge John
Keenan set bail for Marcos at $5
million and said she could not
return to Hawaii and her ailing
husband until details of the bond
are worked out.
Marcos, 59, famous for her
opulent lifestyle as first lady of
the Philippines, arrived at the
federal courthouse by limousine
accompanied by an entourage of
at least a dozen people.
Marcos found herself blinking
back tears when the judge refused
to allow her to return right away
to Hawaii, where she and her 71-

year-old husband have lived since
he was forced out of the Philip
pines in February 1986.
"I'm not going to let the lady
go back to the Hawaiian Islands
until I'm certain the bail is set,"
Keenan.
He ordered her to return to
court Thursday with her lawyers
if they had not worked out a bail
package by then with prosecutors.
After being fingerprinted and
photographed by federal mar
shals, she was released temporar
ily without bail and told not to
leave the New York area. Marcos,
who arrived Sunday, is staying at
the posh Waldorf Towers in a
suite reportedly costing $1,800 a
night. Aides said the bill would
be paid by Marcos friends they
would not identify.
