MALIBU, Calif. (AP) - John
Houseman, the producer who ter
rified millions with the "War of
the Worlds" and won an Oscar
for intimidating his students as
the imperious law professor on
"The Paper Chase," died yester
day. He was 86.
Houseman died at his seaside
home before dawn, said Ivan Goff,
a family friend and scriptwriter.
Margo Harley, a longtime friend
and colleague, said he had spinal
cancer.
Houseman brought a magnetic
eloquence to the role of the cur
mudgeon and gained wide fame
while in his 70s as Professor
Charles Kingsfield in"The Paper
Chase," a role he first played in
the 1973 film and then in the
television series.
He parlayed his fame and his
distinctive speaking style into a
lucrative series of commercial en
dorsements, including ads for the
investment firm Smith, Barney in
which he growled, "They make

money the old-fashioned way —
they EARRNNN it."
Houseman's characters were
marked by a stern, autocratic
tone, yet those who knew him well
described him as quiet and gentle.
"Behind that austere public
posture was the warmest, most
generous man in the world — with
his time, his remarkable intelli
gence, his insight," said writer Da
vid Rintels, who collaborated with
Houseman on the movie
"Gideon's Trumpet" and the play
"Clarence Darrow."
Said actor Kirk Douglas: "He
was a gentleman of the old school,
polite and courtly. He had won
derful manners. He was an un
usual character and I'm going to
miss him."
"He was somebody who has
been responsible, probably, for
more people's careers in American
theater than any single person,
and we're going to miss him very,
very much," Harley said.
