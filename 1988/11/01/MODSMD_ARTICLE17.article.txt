Israeli election tied to violence
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israelis vote today in
an election tied to 11 months of violence that
has cost the lives of more than 300 Palestinians
and 10 Jews, including a rabbi's daughter and
her three children killed in a weekend attack.
Sunday's firebomb attack on a bus that killed
27-year-old schoolteacher Rachel Weiss and her
children was expected to boost the chances of
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the conserva
tive Likud bloc, who advocates tougher measures
against the Arab uprising in the occupied lands.
"There's no question it will help Likud," said
Daniel Elazar, a political analyst of the Jerusalem
Center for Public Affairs. "For most voters, this
will only reconfirm their beliefs, but for those
voters sitting on the fence something like this
could push them off to the right."
Zeev Eitan, a political analyst at Tel Aviv Uni
versity's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, said:
"In this election, that could be the difference
between a clear victory by one party or a tie."
Polls taken before the attack and published
Monday in the newspaper Maariv either gave

Likud the edge or indicated a dead heat similar
to the one that forced Likud and the center-left
Labor Party into a "national unity" coalition.
Walesa to fight shipyard closure
WARSAW, Poland (AP) — An infuriated Lech
Walesa vowed yesterday to fight government
plans to close down the Lenin shipyard, the site
where the Solidarity trade union was born.
The state-owned shipyard in Gdansk is being
closed down Dec. 1. It is the first big industrial
plant to be singled out for closure by the month
old government of Prime Minister Mieczyslaw
Rakowski.
The decision was announced while the shipyard
was closed on the eve of All Saints' Day and
caught many workers and Solidarity activists by
surprise. The yard reopens tomorrow.
A longtime foe of Solidarity, Rakowski took
office Sept. 27 with a pledge to restructure
Poland's aging industrial base and get the eco
nomy moving. In an interview with the BBC, he
said the decision "has nothing to do with
Solidarity."
