## Mandate for change 
### 
The University should
follow through on the
coalition's initiative

THE DEMANDS outlined in
the "Mandate for Change"
put forth by the Students of
Color Coalition represent a sound
framework for a pluralistic future
at Stanford.
The general philosophy and
spirit behind the demands —
nailed on University President
Donald Kennedy's door last week
— deserve student support and
serious consideration from the
University.
In light of the racial incidents
at Ujamaa House, the coalition's
call for full-fledged departments in
ethnic studies is an idea whose
time has come.
If the University is truly com
mitted to fighting racism, it must
help to eliminate ignorance
through education.
The demand that all students be
required to take at least one course
in ethnic studies before graduation
makes sense. But this requirement
should be structured so that it
could be fulfilled without creating
an additional distribution require
ment.
Through education, community
members from diverse back
grounds can unite and live together
in an atmosphere of mutual re
spect and appreciation.
However, some of the coalition's
demands should be re-examined.
First, the definition of "ethnic
studies" as stated in the mandate
is too narrow. It only includes
black, Chicano, Asian-American
and Native American studies.
Given the pervasive nature of
other forms of discrimination and
oppression beyond racism, other
ethnic groups such as Jewish

people should fall into the ethnic
studies category.
Second, the mandate calls for
setting aside at least one half of
the Centennial funds for faculty
positions for people of color. While
some of the funds should be tar
geted for increasing the number
of minority faculty, 50 percent is
a high percentage.
Third, the coalition's demand for
a specific clause in the the Fun
damental Standard that addresses
racist acts is unnecessary. Rather
than rewrite the Fundamental
Standard, the University should
implement a better system to
review possible violations.
Fourth, the coalition rightly de
mands that there should be student
representation on the Board of
Trustees. But eight student mem
bers is an unrealistically high
number considering the board has
never had a student representative.
Finally, while the coalition un
derstandably wants to establish a
place where black students can go
and feel at home without having
to explain why they are "different,"
Ujamaa cannot be autonomous.
The University should not agree
to revoke the 50 percent quota of
black students at Ujamaa. Dorms
are places of cross-cultural diver
sity and theme houses should not
be an exception to the rule.
However, Residential Education
should institute measures to en
sure that theme dorms are filled
only with students that want to
live there.
The University should also allo
cate more funding to ethnic centers
so they are more desirable places
for students of color to gather on
an informal basis.
Despite some oversights, the
Students of Color Coalition has
taken a major step. It is now up
to the University to respond to the
demands and put forward its own
vision of Stanford's future.
