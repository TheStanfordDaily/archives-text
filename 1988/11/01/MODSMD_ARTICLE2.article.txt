# Judge denies drug test retrial
## 
### Brad Hayward Staff writer 
The drug-testing case in which
Stanford athletes defeated the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Associ
ation will not be re-tried, a Santa
Clara County Superior Court
Judge ruled Friday.
But the dispute, which began
more than a year and a half ago,
is still not completely over. The
NCAA has filed a notice of appeal
and plans to take the case to the
California Court of Appeals.
Superior Court Judge Conrad
Rushing ruled in August that the
NCAA's urine tests for drugs vi
olated Stanford athletes' right to
privacy under the California Con
stitution.
On Friday, Hushing denied a
motion by the NCAA to bring the
case back to trial, according to

University lawyer Debra Zum
walt. If a retrial had been granted,
the NCAA could have submitted
new evidence. In the Court of Ap
peals, however, only evidence used
in the initial trial can be used.
Attorneys for the NCAA were
not available for comment yester
day.
Last October, Stanford soccer
player Jennifer Hill and football
player Barry McKeever decided to
file suit against the NCAA, alleg
ing that mandatory drug testing
was an invasion of privacy. The
policy bans athletes' use of 3,000
drugs, from caffeine and steroids
to heroin.
The University joined the suit,
and the legal office assisted Hill
and McKeever in prosecuting the
case.
In December of 1987, Rushing

issued a preliminary injunction
that banned random drug testing
for all Stanford athletes in every
sport except football and men's
basketball.
On Aug. 10 of this year, Rush
ing made a final ruling in favor
of Hill and McKeever, prohibiting
the mandatory testing for all
Stanford ahtletes. Then on Sept.
13, attorneys for the NCAA filed
a motion to re-try the case, citing
that the University had not pro
vided sufficient evidence in the
trial.
Zumwalt said yesterday that it
will take several months for the
trial record to be verified, a stand
ard procedure in appeals cases,
before the NCAA can now file an
appeal brief. A brief is a statement
of the main points of the case.
Once both sides file briefs, oral
arguments will begin.
