## Duty, honor and country 
### 
"Duty, honor, country: Those three
hallowed words reverently dictate what
you ought to be, what you can he, what
you will be."
— General Douglas Mac Arthur
FIVE WEEKS AGO I made one of
the most important decisions of
my life — I decided to become
an Air Force officer upon graduation.
The mechanism through which I will
receive an officer's commission is the
Air Force Reserve Officer Training
Corps. Through this program I am
taught the trades of the military pro
fession, trained to be a leader and
given opportunities to experience ele
ments of life that civilians never will.
And for all of this AFROTC will pay
for my tuition and books. If AFROTC
is such a good deal then why have I
agonized over my decision for the last
four and a half weeks?
I had reservations about my decision
precisely because AFROTC was such a
good deal. I didn't want to view
AFROTC as just a business transaction
— you give me $56,000; I give you at
least four years of my life. For many
days after I made my commitment I
had this uncomfortable feeling that I
had ju3t sold my soul away.
Deep in my heart, however, I knew I
didn't join the Air Force for financial
reasons. I knew full well that had I
dropped AFROTC after my initial
option year, my parents would have
been able to support me. I began to
realize that the reason I felt so
troubled was because joining the Air

Force was not just a career decision, it
was a decision that involved my
morals.
I had this feeling that the military
outlook on life went against the grain
of my nature. My belief that quality of
life should not precede life itself
seemed to be fundamentally at odds
with the military's view. And yet, I
decided to join the Air Force, an or
ganization whose very existence im
plicitly assumes that our way of life
and our quality of living is worth
killing others to defend.
The more I dwell upon my decision,
however, the more I am able to recon
cile my views with those of the mili
tary. First, my belief that quality of
life cannot precede life itself has to be
qualified. I sincerely believe the ideals
of peace, freedom and the American
dream are worth fighting for.
I agree with John Stuart Mill's
statement: "The person who has noth
ing for which he is willing to fight,
nothing which is more important than
his own personal safety. . .has no
chance of being free."
Second, as I reflect upon the circum
stances of my life, I am thankful for
all that this country has given me and
my family. Although my parents have
succeeded largely through their own
sweat and sacrifice, it is America that
has provided the opportunities. And
just as I am obligated to pay back all
that my parents have given me, I am
obligated to pay back all that this
country has given me.
Serving in the Air Force, then, is

just one way I can give back to society.
In a macroscopic sense, I am safehold
ing the American dream for future
generations. In a microscopic sense, I
am benefitting myself, because
completing the rigorous military train
ing required of all officers can only
make me a better person.
There are two other reasons that
helped ease my doubts about joining
the Air Force. First, I place great faith
in the wisdom of the Catholic Church.
It is comforting to know that, at
Vatican 11, the Church supported those
who chose the military profession as a
means of preserving peace.
Second, although I'm an optimist at
heart, I have come to realize that, at
least in our time, the existence of the
military is necessary to preserve peace.
George Washington said, "To be
prepared for war is one of the most
effectual means of preserving peace."
As I look back upon the decision I
made five weeks ago, I am confident I
made the right choice. To me, what
matters is the motivation behind the
decision. And, in my mind, my motiva
tions were not out of profit, but rather
out of duty, honor and country.

chance of being free."
Second, as I reflect upon the circum
stances of my life, I am thankful for
all that this country has given me and
my family. Although my parents have
succeeded largely through their own
sweat and sacrifice, it is America that
has provided the opportunities. And
just as I am obligated to pay back all
that my parents have given me, I am
obligated to pay back all that this
country has given me.
Serving in the Air Force, then, is

just one way I can give back to society.
In a macroscopic sense, I am safehold
ing the American dream for future
generations. In a microscopic sense, I
am benefitting myself, because
completing the rigorous military train
ing required of all officers can only
make me a better person.
There are two other reasons that
helped ease my doubts about joining
the Air Force. First, I place great faith
in the wisdom of the Catholic Church.
It is comforting to know that, at
Vatican 11, the Church supported those
who chose the military profession as a
means of preserving peace.
Second, although I'm an optimist at
heart, I have come to realize that, at
least in our time, the existence of the
military is necessary to preserve peace.
George Washington said, "To be
prepared for war is one of the most
effectual means of preserving peace."
As I look back upon the decision I
made five weeks ago, I am confident I
made the right choice. To me, what
matters is the motivation behind the
decision. And, in my mind, my motiva
tions were not out of profit, but rather
out of duty, honor and country.
