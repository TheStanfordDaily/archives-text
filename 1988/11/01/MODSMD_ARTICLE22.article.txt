## Calero debate may lead to forum on Central America 
### 
I AM A representative of Stanford
Central American Action Network,
writing in response to a letter
printed in The Daily on Oct. 25 and to
a Daily editorial on Oct. 26 concerning
the ASSU Senate's decision not to
grant the Speakers Bureau money to
bring Adolfo Calero to campus.
Adolfo Calero, leader of the
Nicaraguan Contra forces, exists only
as an extension of the Reagan Admin
istration's interventionist policies in
Central America. The Contras have
been supported by the Reagan Admin
istration for years, sometimes without
the approval of the U.S. Congress,
although they are recognized by the
mgyority of our NATO allies as an
illegitimate terrorist organization,
trained and supplied by the U.S. gov
ernment.
This is a serious issue for the inno
cent people in Nicaragua who are
attacked, raped and murdered on a

daily basis by Calero and his forces. It
is also a serious issue here in the
United States because these acts are
funded by U.S. tax dollars.
In light of the recent debate about
whether Calero should be paid $4,000
of student monies to speak on campus,
the issue has taken on particular
importance for the Stanford communi
ty.
On Oct. 20, the senate voted against
bringing Calero to campus. On Oct. 25,
a letter to The Daily began "Some
thing awful has happened" and went
on to explain how a resolution which
forbids Calero from speaking on
campus this quarter only is going to
"thwart attempts at a more balanced
education."
Four thousand dollars is a large sum
(especially in Nicaragua) and because
these funds would be given to a man
who is connected to the deaths of
human beings, it is only fair that the

issues be examined before student
money is allocated.
The issue at hand is not free speech
or the political biases of the senate.
The issue at hand is the integrity of
the senators and the students they
represent. SCAAN members are not
opposed to having Calero come to
campus to speak, but are opposed to
having an offical arm of the student
body fund illegal activities and in doing
so, give legitimacy to an internationally
recognized terrorist leader.
Because "balanced education" is a
goal, we cannot bring Calero to
campus without bringing a representa
tive of the Nicaraguan Sandinistas as
well.
This is logistically impossible as the
Reagan administration has denied visas
to Sandinistas for the past eight years.
One suggested alternative would be to
invite Calero to come to campus to
speak under the condition that he

speak for free and donate the $4000
honorarium to humanitarian aid for
Nicaraguans in the form of hurricane
relief.
It is unlikely that Calero would
accept such a proposition, but there
are other ways to bring these critical
issues to campus without blindly spon
soring one side.
SCAAN members are currently work
ing to put together a forum which
would feature prominent speakers who
represent various points of view about
the situations in El Salvador and in
Nicaragua. Such a forum would bring
debate to campus but would not re
quire that the students take a side
financially. We ask for the support of
the Speakers Bureau, the senate and
The Daily, in bringing a more complete
program to Stanford.
