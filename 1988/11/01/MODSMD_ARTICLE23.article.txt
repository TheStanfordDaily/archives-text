# Progressives must respect opponents

I am glad to learn from Chip
Bartlett (Letter, Oct. 27) that "progres
sive students share a willingness to
debate political issues." As a conserva
tive and as a veteran of campus
debates on touchy issues, I have not
experienced much of this willingness
myself. All too often, boos, jeers and
personal abuse remain the common
currency.
Your correspondent states that "we,
as an intellectual community, are too
unwilling to take risks." Quite so! But
dialogue cannot take place when dis
senters from accepted orthodoxies are
excluded from teaching posts in certain

disciplines a priori.
How many avowed conservatives —
as opposed to liberals or radicals —
hold teaching posts at any mtyor U.S.
university in fields such as women's
studies, Black studies, African studies,
ethnic studies?
The list fits into a matchbox — an
inordinate statistical imbalance in a
country such as the U.S. where far
more respondents in public opinion
polls define themselves as conservatives
than as liberals.
An evangelical Christian or a Chas
sidic Jew surely has a better chance to
be appointed to teach dialectical
materialism at an SED party school in
East Germany than to teach women's
studies at a U.S. university.
What I resent most is not that
campus militants disagree with me, but
that they often see themselves as a

self-appointed moral vanguard, and
their opponents as sinners or
reprobates, to be converted or silenced
