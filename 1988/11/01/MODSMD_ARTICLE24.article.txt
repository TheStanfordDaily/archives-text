# Incomparable band has gotten bland
## 
### 
I have been attending Stanford foot
ball games for some time. A child in
the late thirties, a student after the
war and now as an alumni.
The "new" band approach in the
seventies was startling. But I found it
fresh, innovative and in time er\joyable.
However, re-runs can become also
runs. Formations made by sliding third
base style, or flying with arms ex-

tended was funny the first 50 times,
not ad nauseam. Members without
instruments are a waste. And the
quality of your music has depreciated.
I'm sorry LSJUMB. You're no longer
funny, interesting, different.. .and
worst of all.. .not shocking!
You have become.. .boring. And
that's too bad.
