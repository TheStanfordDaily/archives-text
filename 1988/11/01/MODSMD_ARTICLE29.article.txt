## Communication that fits like a glove Grad student's invention helps non-vocal deaf people to speak their piece 
### Eric Mu√±oz 
Gloves have often played meaningful
roles in various patterns of communi
cation. They impart formality, and were
used to delineate the boundaries be
tween men and women in ballroom
dancing.
A slap on the face with a glove meant
a challenge to duel. The characteristic
black glove left on the scene of the
crime bedeviled Inspector Clouseau on
his search for the Pink Panther.
Now gloves will convey another kind
of message. A graduate student at Stan
ford has devised a glove that may
revolutionize communication between
hearing people and non-vocal deaf and
deaf-blind people.
Since the days of Helen Keller and
her teacher Annie Sullivan, the method
of fingerspelling has facilitated this in
teraction, but communication between
deaf persons and hearing people un
skilled in deaf communication can be
confusing and frustrating for both par
ties.
With the successful application of the
"talking" glove designed by James
Kramer, a graduate student in electrical
engineering, communication will no
longer hinge on mutual knowledge of
fingerspelling, thus breaking this com

munication barrier that exists within
the English language.
The driving force behind the "talking"
glove, the idea Kramer conceived three
years ago, comes from his ability and
resources to construct a system capable
of helping others. Kramer's philosophy
of design that lead to the creation of
the "talking" glove, is to put himself
in another's shoes. "If I were a disabled
person, for instance a non-vocal deaf
person, and I had the technical ability,
what would I design for myself?"
His two-way communication system
allows a non-vocal deaf or deaf-blind
individual to "speak" to a hearing in
dividual by using a special glove with
the fingertips removed, similar to a
biking glove.
Sensors wired in the glove monitor
the angle created by each finger joint.
As the hand describes the message, the
movement is transformed into computer
synthesized speech, audible to the
hearing listener as it is amplified
through a mini-speaker worn around
the fingerspeller's neck.
The hearing individual responds by
typing on an electronic pocket keyboard.
The message then appears on the liquid
crystal display of a wristwatch worn by
the deaf user. A response to a deaf
person who is also blind appears on a

mechanical braille display attached at
the waist of the deaf-blind user.
Kramer's "talking" glove, which will
be featured on a Public Broadcasting
Service television special this January,
would give deaf and deaf-blind persons
greater independence and freedom as
they would no longer need to rely on
interpreters.
The patent lawyers for Kramer's in
vention have already submitted an ap
plication to the United States Patent
Office for approval. Kramer says if all
goes as expected, the glove system will
be sold on the market in less than two
years.
Kramer continues to work on ways
to perfect his system. In its present
form, the entire unit is connected by
wires. In the future, infrared signals or
radio waves will transmit the messages
instead of the more constricting wires.
Kramer also plans to include the sign
language signs, not only fingerspelled
letters, into the glove's recognizable "vo
cabulary."
His device has found success in its
test runs at Stanford and other areas
in California, although more testing is
planned.
The "talking" glove signals a new era
in opening up communication between
hearing individuals and non-vocal deaf
and deaf-blind individuals.
