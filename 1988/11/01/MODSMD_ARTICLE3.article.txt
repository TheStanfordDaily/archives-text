### DJ Berinstein Staff writer 
Gov. Michael Dukakis finally accepted
the label Republicans have tried to give
him throughout the presidential cam
paign. On Sunday, Dukakis said the
dreaded L-word.
"I'm a liberal in the tradition of
Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman
and John Kennedy," Dukakis told a
Fresno crowd of supporters.
In this election year, liberalism has
taken on a new connotation, which has
a few people, including University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy, worried.
In a full page advertisement in The
New York Times last week, 68 promi
nent acadeinians, writers and politicians
signed a "Reaffirmation of Principle,"
stating a deep concern for the use of

the word liberal "in terms of op
probrium."
Kennedy signed the document as did
Profs. Kenneth Arrow, Gordon Craig,
Carl Degler and Gordon Wright. Har
vard and Yale faculty signatures num
bered five, and Columbia tallied four.
According to Columbia University
Prof. Fritz Stern, one of the organizers
of the ad, the list of signees "was de
signed to be as diverse and distinct as
possible."
It also included Cyrus Vance, secre
tary of state under President Carter,
Robert McNamara, secretary of defense
under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson,
and contemporary writers Eudora
Welty, Robert Penn Warren, Ralph El
lison, William Styron and John Hersey.
The ad begins, "We speak as American
citizens who wish to reaffirm America's

liberal tradition. At our country's
founding, the spirit of liberalism suf
fused the Revolution, the Declaration
of Independence, the Constitution and
the Bill of Rights." It goes on to say
that "liberal principles — freedom,
tolerance and the protection of the
rights of every .citizen — are timeless."
The ad was the idea of Stern and C.
Vann Woodward, a professor at Yale.
Stern was originally upset with the
"first outburst" of the misuse of the
word "liberal" by President Roanld
Reagan. Stern wrote an op-ed to The
New York Times in which he quoted
Lionel Trilling in an effort to enlighten
people that "liberalism (was) not only
the dominant but the sole intellectual
tradition in the United States."
