# Blueberries and Barbie dolls: The Bug slimes down to size
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
So much time, so little to do, and so
we must press on.
Dear Bug,
Why are all men slime?
— Margaret Sanger
I'm surprised at you, Margaret. How
could you write such a thing when you
know it's just not true. And on top of
that, aren't you dead?
Incidentally, you spelled slim wrong.
There's no "e." Your little slip-up is
ironic, however, considering that slim
with the "e" spells "slime". Almost all
men are, in fact, slime, and proud of it
(which is exactly why they are slime in
the first place, not to mention the 23rd).
Society's well-entrenched sexism, its
media proliferation of men who fit your
categorization and the existence of dolls
like Barbie and Stretch Armstrong have
led to the kind of all-encompassing state
ment you have made.
Actually, however, you are wrong: it is
a scientific fact that all men are not slim.
Society has imposed stricter
parameters for appearance upon the
"fairer" sex. Thus, women are more likely
to consider slight aberrance from the
ideal appearance to be extreme and

shameful aberrance.
The resentment in the question, "Why
are all men slim?" grows out of women's
paranoia that they are too chubby. But
chubby women aren't Untouchables in
any case. Oprah Winfrey, Rosemary
Clooney, Shelley Winters, Gertrude Stein,
the Weather Girls, Babs Bush and my
Uncle Arthur all shop at Plump & Pretty,
but are also powerful, intelligent women
who are found attractive by many men,
one of whom has as good judgement and
solid ethics as the next president of the
United States.
In truth, the percentage of men who
are slim is not a great deal larger than
the percentage of women who are slim.
As well, there are more women who are
really slim than men who are really slim.
For evidence, witness the Grateful Dead
lyrics, "Yes, the women are slimmer.
That's right, the women are slimmer."
Nonetheless, the myth remains and has
been created and is perpetuated by the
media culture. Thus, a skinny piece of
dried beef is not a Slim Jane, it's a Slim
Jim. And, of course, there's always Slim
Whitman, a paragon of machismo in the
country music business.
Dear Bug,
Granted that blueberries are really
rather purple, and not blue, I can't think

of any blue foods. Do they exist?
— Honore de Balzac
There are only a few natural blue
edibles. Some blueberries are blue. Some
eggplant is a hue of blue. There are blue
potatoes and there is blue corn. There
are blue tortilla chips and some purple
cabbage is sorta blue. But despite these,

your question is certainly understandable
(after all, it's in English).
Actually, some of the above are only
blue on the outside. Many foodstuffs are
nominally blue, but chromatically blue
only on the outside or not at all. For
example, bluefish is not truly blue. Blue
whales are not blue inside, but they are
big and should not be made fun of. Blue
suede shoes are only dyed blue and are
difficult to chew, as is the flesh of your
typical bluetick hound, who is blue only
when a victim of unrequited love.
Let us leave the obfuscation behind
and get to the nexus of this issue, what
ever the Hell that means.
The Bug contacted a number of biology
professors before reaching a very con
genial professor by the name of Peter
Ray. Prof. Ray tried valiantly to explain
the complicated scientific reason behind
the disproportionate number of green,
yellow and red veggies and fruits, but to
be frank (even though I'm the Bug), I'm
not sure I understood a thing.
Prof. Ray said, "It's just, I suppose,
some kind of coincidence" that the
popular foodstuff colors ended up to be
green, yellow, etc. as far as fruits and
vegetables go. He added that in different
parts of the world there probably exist
lhore blue organic edibles than we are

familiar with. Ray said he knows of a
few blue root vegetables indigenous to
other lands.
I guess you could say that whoever's
in charge of all this life stuff is respon
sible. Prof. Ray said, "Green, when pres
ent, is due to chlorophyll," and that its
color is due to how the chemical structure
absorbs sunlight. But the fact that that
particular chemical structure causes light
wavelengths that look green, instead of
blue, is just one of those things which is
as about as logical as Geraldo Rivera still
having a job, much less a network special.
Again, they're blueless for no real rea
son. Things that are blue have a soluble
pigment one tends to find in the cell sap
of fruits. The utilitarian reason things
have color in the first place, according
to Prof. Ray, is that they need to be
conspicuous so that animals can find
them in the woods and transport them,
spreading the seeds in the process.
When it comes right down to it, blue
is just tough to deal with. Not even the
greatest man of all time, Willy Wonka,
could quite get a handle on blue, and
thus his full-course-meal chewing gum
lost control during the blueberry pie stage
and Violet had to be rolled to the squeez
ing room by short orange men.
Until next week, the Bug has spoken.

is just tough to deal with. Not even the
greatest man of all time, Willy Wonka,
could quite get a handle on blue, and
thus his full-course-meal chewing gum
lost control during the blueberry pie stage
and Violet had to be rolled to the squeez
ing room by short orange men.
Until next week, the Bug has spoken.


BUG ME
So much time, so little to do, and so
we must press on.
Dear Bug,
Why are all men slime?
— Margaret Sanger
I'm surprised at you, Margaret. How
could you write such a thing when you
know it's just not true. And on top of
that, aren't you dead?
Incidentally, you spelled slim wrong.
There's no "e." Your little slip-up is
ironic, however, considering that slim
with the "e" spells "slime". Almost all
men are, in fact, slime, and proud of it
(which is exactly why they are slime in
the first place, not to mention the 23rd).
Society's well-entrenched sexism, its
media proliferation of men who fit your
categorization and the existence of dolls
like Barbie and Stretch Armstrong have
led to the kind of all-encompassing state
ment you have made.
Actually, however, you are wrong: it is
a scientific fact that all men are not slim.
Society has imposed stricter
parameters for appearance upon the
"fairer" sex. Thus, women are more likely
to consider slight aberrance from the
ideal appearance to be extreme and

shameful aberrance.
The resentment in the question, "Why
are all men slim?" grows out of women's
paranoia that they are too chubby. But
chubby women aren't Untouchables in
any case. Oprah Winfrey, Rosemary
Clooney, Shelley Winters, Gertrude Stein,
the Weather Girls, Babs Bush and my
Uncle Arthur all shop at Plump & Pretty,
but are also powerful, intelligent women
who are found attractive by many men,
one of whom has as good judgement and
solid ethics as the next president of the
United States.
In truth, the percentage of men who
are slim is not a great deal larger than
the percentage of women who are slim.
As well, there are more women who are
really slim than men who are really slim.
For evidence, witness the Grateful Dead
lyrics, "Yes, the women are slimmer.
That's right, the women are slimmer."
Nonetheless, the myth remains and has
been created and is perpetuated by the
media culture. Thus, a skinny piece of
dried beef is not a Slim Jane, it's a Slim
Jim. And, of course, there's always Slim
Whitman, a paragon of machismo in the
country music business.
Dear Bug,
Granted that blueberries are really
rather purple, and not blue, I can't think

of any blue foods. Do they exist?
— Honore de Balzac
There are only a few natural blue
edibles. Some blueberries are blue. Some
eggplant is a hue of blue. There are blue
potatoes and there is blue corn. There
are blue tortilla chips and some purple
cabbage is sorta blue. But despite these,

your question is certainly understandable
(after all, it's in English).
Actually, some of the above are only
blue on the outside. Many foodstuffs are
nominally blue, but chromatically blue
only on the outside or not at all. For
example, bluefish is not truly blue. Blue
whales are not blue inside, but they are
big and should not be made fun of. Blue
suede shoes are only dyed blue and are
difficult to chew, as is the flesh of your
typical bluetick hound, who is blue only
when a victim of unrequited love.
Let us leave the obfuscation behind
and get to the nexus of this issue, what
ever the Hell that means.
The Bug contacted a number of biology
professors before reaching a very con
genial professor by the name of Peter
Ray. Prof. Ray tried valiantly to explain
the complicated scientific reason behind
the disproportionate number of green,
yellow and red veggies and fruits, but to
be frank (even though I'm the Bug), I'm
not sure I understood a thing.
Prof. Ray said, "It's just, I suppose,
some kind of coincidence" that the
popular foodstuff colors ended up to be
green, yellow, etc. as far as fruits and
vegetables go. He added that in different
parts of the world there probably exist
lhore blue organic edibles than we are

familiar with. Ray said he knows of a
few blue root vegetables indigenous to
other lands.
I guess you could say that whoever's
in charge of all this life stuff is respon
sible. Prof. Ray said, "Green, when pres
ent, is due to chlorophyll," and that its
color is due to how the chemical structure
absorbs sunlight. But the fact that that
particular chemical structure causes light
wavelengths that look green, instead of
blue, is just one of those things which is
as about as logical as Geraldo Rivera still
having a job, much less a network special.
Again, they're blueless for no real rea
son. Things that are blue have a soluble
pigment one tends to find in the cell sap
of fruits. The utilitarian reason things
have color in the first place, according
to Prof. Ray, is that they need to be
conspicuous so that animals can find
them in the woods and transport them,
spreading the seeds in the process.

greatest man of all time, Willy Wonka,
