"It will be more of a shock
this season if Stanford doesn't
receive an invitation to the
NCAA party than if the Cardi
nal wins the national champi
onship again."
— The Sporting News 1988-89
College Basketball Yearbook

Get used to it.
Pacific 10 Conference co
favorites in a coaches poll. No.
15 nationally in Dick Vitale's
Basketball. No. 19 in The
Sporting News.
It's the first day of Novem
ber, 1988. And there is hype
about Stanford men's basket
ball.
Former Daily sportswriter
Chris Fialko wrote after Stan
ford shut down then-No. 1 Ar
izona last February, "Not since
1942, when Stanford won the
NCAA Championship, has the
Cardinal seized the national
basketball limelight."
This year, it is unlikely that
Stanford will loosen that grip.
So enjoy the hype. Revel in
it. Roll in it; drown in it. Smear
it all over your body. Because
this is the first time you've
ever had a chance to.
And because a lot of that
hype is true.
Before meeting the Cardinal
in the Pac-10 tournament, Ar
izona Coach Lute Olson said
he would rather play any school
in the nation than Stanford.
Many dismissed that as pre
game propaganda. But he was
still saying it after going all
the way to the NCAA Final
Four.
Try this test. Take a
preseason consensus All-
America guard (Todd Lichti),
an honorable mention All-
America power forward
(Howard Wright), a proven de
fensive stopper at the other for
ward (Bryan McSweeney), the
conference's third-leading as
sist man and fourth-leading
three-point shooter at point
guard (Terry Taylor), and a
center who may have been the
Pac-10's most improved player
in 1987 (Eric Reveno).
Add this bench: a member of
the Australian Olympic team
(Andrew Vlahov), one of the
nation's top-20 freshman
recruits (Adam Keefe) and ex
perienced backups at guard
(Scott Meinert) and center
(Derek Bruton).
Now, put this bunch at . . .
North Carolina. Syracuse. In
diana. UCLA in the 19705.
They'd be rated in the top
10 easily.
That's because those schools
are (or were) proven basketball
powers. Stanford, which boasts
the above lineup, isn't, and cer
tainly has to prove it belongs,
or those top-20 ratings will dis

appear faster than the Oakland
Athletics.
The Cardinal will get that
chance immediately. Stanford's
first regular season action
comes in the Big Apple NIT
beginning Nov. 18. Among the
other schools playing in the 16-
team tourney . . . North
Carolina. Syracuse. Indiana.
Then, on Nov. 28, the Car
dinal travels to Chapel Hill to
meet the Tar Heels head on.
Imagine the shockwaves that
beating them would send
across America.
You don't think Stanford can
do it?
I'm not sure that Stanford
will, but it can. First of all,
luck may be on Stanford's side.
My most reliable source as
sures me that North Carolina
Olympian J.R. Reid will still
be iryured past Thankgsgiving.
Still, that leaves most of
what The Sporting News rated
as the nation's top front line,
which Stanford's can compete
with but certainly won't over
whelm.
On the other hand, North
Carolina's Jeff Lebo is un
proven at point guard, espe
cially after missing the Olympic
Trials this summer due to a
lower-leg stress fracture. North
Carolina does not have the
depth that Stanford has. And
there is no designated Tar Heel
starter at shooting guard.

Enjoy the hype.
Revel in it. Roll in
it; drown in it.
Smear it all over
your body. Be
cause this is the
first time you've
ever had a
chance to.

That's where Todd Lichti,
the greatest men's basketball
player in Stanford history,
operates. And if you need any
evidence of how far one player
can take a team, look no fur
ther than Danny Manning,
Kansas Jayhawks, 1988 NCAA
Champions.
Todd Lichti is not Danny
Manning, or even Arizona's
Sean Elliott. But with him in
there, anything is possible. I
mean, what's going to stop him
— opponents are going to find
out he can't hit the curvebail?
Face it. Stanford matches up
well with North Carolina, a
consensus top-five pick.
And if that's true, to me that
means the Cardinal can
legitimately beat any team.
Stanford is putting five senior
returning starters on the floor
in 1988-89, coached by Mike
Montgomery, the man who
proved on Feb. 4, 1988 that
anything is possible.
