# Cross country 2nd in Pac-10s
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Oregon established itself as the
top cross-country school in the
Pacific 10 yesterday, winning both
the men's and women's champi
onships at Stanford. The Stanford
men held strong, taking second
place, while the women fell to
seventh after a strong start.
The men were upset by a strong
team from Oregon, which took
first place and four of the top
seven spots. The race began to
break up at the two-mile mark,
but the entire Oregon team moved
up on the last mile of the 10-

kilometer race to win convincingly
with 31 points. Stanford was the
runner-up with 61, well ahead of
third-place UCLA.
Junior Steve Miller was the
first Cardinal runner. Miller
finished in third place with a time
of 31 minutes, three seconds. De
spite missing the title, Miller felt
that the race was a success. "Just
like the (Stanford) Invitational,
we wanted to get all five runners
in the top fifteen. I think we did
the job."
Both the women's and the
men's teams went out strong in
the first mile. The women went
through the mile mark in five
minutes, while the men whipped
through in a blistering 4:25. When
the men's pack started to break
up at the two-mile mark Stanford
was in good position. By contrast,
the women faltered on the back
side hill halfway through their
race.
The Stanford men were ranked
ninth by the NCAA going into the
race. Times were slower than
hoped, but the race was a test of
survival after the grueling start,
rather than speed. Junior Eric
Mastalir was the second Stanford
finisher in 31:36. Senior captain
James Alborough was 15th overall
and third for Stanford in 31:51.
"It was tough out there," he
noted.
Junior Carol Gray, the women's
captain, was Stanford's main hope
in the women's 5,000-meter race.
She finished a strong sixth over
all, but was obviously going for
the win. Gray took the field out
in five minutes, but couldn't lose
the competition. Her final time
was 17:25, an average of five and
a half minut .s per mile. Liz Wil
son of Oregon was the overall win
ner in 17:06.
Gray was the only Stfl'iforH
woman in the top 20, with sopn
omore Melanie Bloch finishing
22nd. Behind Bloch were fresh
men Jodie Bilotta and Jeannine
Heltzell.
Women's coach Brooks Johnson
was disapointed with the effort.
"The times just aren't there this

year. I don't know what the prob
lem is, but we are not running
up to the level of our talent."
Freshman Bilotta said "We had
hoped to get five people under 18
minutes. Right now we're just get
ting into racing shape. It's mostly
mental — the hill just kills us
every time."
The Stanford men, by contrast,
nearly achieved their goal of
taking five of the top 15 spots,
and were prevented by Oregon.
Junior Mark Mastalir was 16th
in 31:53, while Dave Scudamore
was 19th in 32:03.
The team has n.ac. tremta. ■
strides since last season, when
they were eighth in this same
moot. Eric Mastalir moved up 23
piaces, while Mark improved 27.
Alborough had a faster time last
year, but only lost one place from
last year. Mark Mastalir was the
teams' fifth scorer in 43rd last
year, while the entire team
finished inside the top 20 yester
day.

"I think the District-8 meet is
an excellent chance for us. Oregon
will be the most formidable op
ponent, and Washington will also
be strong," according to Eric Mas
talir. "The NCAA's are wide-open
this year, and the District-8 meet
will be the same way.
"We have to do the same thing
at Districts," where the top two
teams will qualify for the NCAA
Championship in lowa November
21st. "I'm real happy with the
way the program is going, and
the team is happy with the way
fChisnr^ 1 is rnaeh'ig," Eric
.'vluoLalir continued.
The women's team has been un
dergoing a coi tinual rebuilding
phase. Gray will have a tough
time motivating her team to place
well enough in the District-8
Championships November 12 to
qualify for the NCAA Champion
ship. She should make the race
as an individual, and Bloch has
an outside chance.
