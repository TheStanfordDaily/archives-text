# Water polo ties for 2nd in tourney
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Sometimes a few feet can make all the
difference.
After the men's water polo team compiled
a 1-5 record during the past two weeks, coach
Dante Dettamanti decided enough was enough.
Choosing to ignore the new style of play
prevalent throughout the NCAA due to rules
changes this past season, the Stanford skipper
switched the squad back to the pressing de
fense it used in previous years at the Pacific
-10/PCAA Tournament in Long Beach.
Compiled with a dash of attitude change, the
alteration had an immediate impact.
Reversing its previous trend of not finding
the goal, the Cardinal broke out this weekend,
tallying 33 points in four games. Its 3-1 record
against its PCAA opponents during the two
day tournament was good for a second-place
tie with Southern California and raised the
Cardinal's overall record to 19-9.
Fifth-ranked Stanford began the tourna
ment with an 8-7 loss to N0.6 UC-Irvine. The
squad's problems of the previous two weeks
were highlighted as it dropped its fifth contest
in six tries. Not only was it sloppy on offense,
missing the mtyority of its shots, but it was
unable to guard the opponent's holeman. Ir
vine two-meter man Tom Ward accounted for
seven of the eight Anteater tallies.
"I'd been using a defense featuring two

meter guarding but we just didn't have the
personnel," Dettamanti said. "After the Irvine
game I decided to abandon my plan and revert
to our old helping-type defense which doesn't
require as much emphasis on one-on-one
matchups."
The "big change" involved features the two
meter guard defending his man from the side
instead of from directly in back. Athough this
is supposedly not as effective with the ultra
protection referees give two-meter men, Det
tamanti found it much more in line with the
Cardinal's ability and size as it emphasizes
more zone-type defense and allows goalie Todd
Kemp to come out of the goal and steal the
ball.
After a team meeting in which the players
"bottomed out," the Cardinal quickly turned
its game performance around. Saturday af
ternoon the squad responded by holding off
fourth-ranked Long Beach 5-4, the exact score
the 49ers had defeated Stanford by the pre
vious week at deGuerre.
The score was not an adequate representa
tion of the contest, however. Stanford actually
thoroughly dominated the game, controlling
the pace, taking many more shots on goal
than Long Beach, and holding 49er holeman
Cyle Kopp to only one goal. The team was
led in scoring by sophomore Rick McNair with
two tallies, while Chuck Maguy, Steve Mil
lham, and Jon Swerdloff added one apiece.
"We really needed that win because we had

lost five of our last six and were really down,"
Dettamanti said. "It was great to come back
and beat Long Beach after they beat us in
our own pool. It (the win) really turned us
around."
The victory was the seed from which blos
somed the Cardinal's missing confidence. Sun
day the team routed seventh-ranked UC-Santa
Barbara 9-5 in its morning game, then an
swered with a 12-3 annihilation of tenth-rated
Pepperdine that afternoon. In both contests
the squad was so far ahead by the third quar
ter that the second string was able to enter
the water for the first time in three weeks.
In addition to much tighter defense
anchored by the outstanding play of Kemp,
the offense broke out of its slump, scoring on
a number of counterattacks and taking ad
vantage of the msyority of its six-on-five ad
vantages. Offensively Stanford was led by a
new face, promoted junior Greg Loos. Moving
up to starter during the tournament, the
driver answered with seven goals, including
five in the final two contests. Other leading
scorers included holeman Erik Blum with
three in the Pepperdine contest, and SwerdlofT
and McNair with three each in the victory
over Santa Barbara.
"This was the real turning point of our
season. We went from the low point to the
high point at this one tournament," Det
tamanti said.

Dettamanti said. "It was great to come back
and beat Long Beach after they beat us in
our own pool. It (the win) really turned us
around."
The victory was the seed from which blos
somed the Cardinal's missing confidence. Sun
day the team routed seventh-ranked UC-Santa
Barbara 9-5 in its morning game, then an
swered with a 12-3 annihilation of tenth-rated
Pepperdine that afternoon. In both contests
the squad was so far ahead by the third quar
ter that the second string was able to enter
the water for the first time in three weeks.
In addition to much tighter defense
anchored by the outstanding play of Kemp,
the offense broke out of its slump, scoring on
a number of counterattacks and taking ad
vantage of the msyority of its six-on-five ad
vantages. Offensively Stanford was led by a
new face, promoted junior Greg Loos. Moving
up to starter during the tournament, the
driver answered with seven goals, including
five in the final two contests. Other leading
scorers included holeman Erik Blum with
three in the Pepperdine contest, and SwerdlofT
and McNair with three each in the victory
over Santa Barbara.
"This was the real turning point of our
season. We went from the low point to the
high point at this one tournament," Det
tamanti said.
