# Upset-happy Washington State up next for Stanford
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
It was another Monday to forget
for Jack Elway.
The Stanford football coach
conducted his weekly press con
ference yesterday and for the
fourth time this season he was
able to talk about a strong Car
dinal effort in a close game that
somehow escaped the "W"
column.
"I told the football team after
the football game at Washington
that as far as effort was concerned
it was excellent," Elway said.
"They flew at 'em and played hard
the whole football game."
But Stanford dug itself too deep
a hole in the first half and came
up just short in a 28-25 loss to
the Huskies Saturday. The 3-4-1
Cardinal (1-3-1 in Pacific 10 Con
ference action) next meets Wash
ington State at Stanford Stadium
this Saturday.
The Cougars come into the
game at only 2-3 in league play,
but the team is 5-3 overall and
is coming off 1988's biggest upset
— a 34-30 win over (previously)
top-ranked UCLA at the Rose
Bowl.
"They play extremely well," El

way understated. "That win over
UCLA had to be one of the biggest
in Washington State history."
The Cougars are led by junior
quarterback Timm Rosenbach
("say it like Sammy 'Baugh,'" ac
cording to the publicity cam
paign), the newest Heisman
Trophy candidate in the country.
Rosenbach is currently the na
tion's leading passer with an ef
ficiency rating of 174.9. Of course
no one knows how passing effi
ciency is figured, or what that
number means, but it is higher
than the random number associ
ated with any other quarterback
in the nation, and that should
count for something.
"Timm's played real well for
us," WSU Coach Dennis Erickson
said. "He has had a great year. . . .
Just the experience factor has
made a big difference for us. He's
reading defenses better."
Stanford tailback Jon Volpe
played like he wanted to get his
name on the Heisman ballot last
week, as well. Volpe toted 29 times
for a school record 220 yards, in
cluding a 68-yarder that is the
Cardinal's second-longest play
from scrimmage this season.
But Volpe said he'd trade all
those yards for a win. "Well, it

would've been a lot better if we
had won the game," he said. "As
I said before I wouldn't have
minded falling a few yards short
if we got the win."
Volpe, and the Cardinal, will
try again for win No. 4 in the
final home game of the season.
The odds, for a change, may ac
tually be in Stanford's favor. The
Cougars have been up and down
all year and there is only one di
rection they can go after last Sat
urday.
Additionally, the Stanford de
fense appears to be ready to meet
Rosenbach's challenge, and the
Stanford offense has a history of
scoring often against WSU. And
maybe Elway will have a slightly
more pleasant Monday next time
around.
Card notes
Volpe ha* now rushed for 859 yards
this season. He needs to average 47
yards per game to be the third Stan
ford player to rush for 1000 yards in
one season (the others are Minnesota
Viking Darrin Nelson, who did it
three times, and Chicago Bear Brad
Muster).
Volpe needs only 211 yards (70.3

per game) to eclipse Nelson's single
season Stanford mark of 1069 yards.
Volpe is currently 15th in the nation
and third in the Pac-10 at 107.4 yards
per game.
The four teams that have beaten
the Cardinal this season (USC,

Oregon, Notre Dame and Washington)
are currently 26-5.
Washington State has won all four
road games it has travelled to on Con
tinental Airlines charters (Illinois,
Minnesota, Tennessee and UCLA).
The only other road game the Cougs
played, at Arizona, the team flew an
American West charter and lost. WSU
is flying Continental this weekend.

ference yesterday and for the
fourth time this season he was
able to talk about a strong Car
dinal effort in a close game that
somehow escaped the "W"
column.
"I told the football team after
the football game at Washington
that as far as effort was concerned
it was excellent," Elway said.
"They flew at 'em and played hard
the whole football game."
But Stanford dug itself too deep
a hole in the first half and came
up just short in a 28-25 loss to
the Huskies Saturday. The 3-4-1
Cardinal (1-3-1 in Pacific 10 Con
ference action) next meets Wash
ington State at Stanford Stadium
this Saturday.
The Cougars come into the
game at only 2-3 in league play,
but the team is 5-3 overall and
is coming off 1988's biggest upset
— a 34-30 win over (previously)
top-ranked UCLA at the Rose
Bowl.
"They play extremely well," El

way understated. "That win over
UCLA had to be one of the biggest
in Washington State history."
The Cougars are led by junior
quarterback Timm Rosenbach
("say it like Sammy 'Baugh,'" ac
cording to the publicity cam
paign), the newest Heisman
Trophy candidate in the country.
Rosenbach is currently the na
tion's leading passer with an ef
ficiency rating of 174.9. Of course
no one knows how passing effi
ciency is figured, or what that
number means, but it is higher
than the random number associ
ated with any other quarterback
in the nation, and that should
count for something.
"Timm's played real well for
us," WSU Coach Dennis Erickson
said. "He has had a great year. . . .
Just the experience factor has
made a big difference for us. He's
reading defenses better."
Stanford tailback Jon Volpe
played like he wanted to get his
name on the Heisman ballot last
week, as well. Volpe toted 29 times
for a school record 220 yards, in
cluding a 68-yarder that is the
Cardinal's second-longest play
from scrimmage this season.
But Volpe said he'd trade all
those yards for a win. "Well, it

would've been a lot better if we
had won the game," he said. "As
I said before I wouldn't have
minded falling a few yards short
if we got the win."
Volpe, and the Cardinal, will
try again for win No. 4 in the
final home game of the season.
The odds, for a change, may ac
tually be in Stanford's favor. The
Cougars have been up and down
all year and there is only one di
rection they can go after last Sat
urday.
Additionally, the Stanford de
fense appears to be ready to meet
Rosenbach's challenge, and the
Stanford offense has a history of
scoring often against WSU. And
maybe Elway will have a slightly
more pleasant Monday next time
around.
Card notes
Volpe ha* now rushed for 859 yards
this season. He needs to average 47
yards per game to be the third Stan
ford player to rush for 1000 yards in
one season (the others are Minnesota
Viking Darrin Nelson, who did it
three times, and Chicago Bear Brad
Muster).
Volpe needs only 211 yards (70.3
