# Volleyball stalks Golden Bears
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women's volleyball hun
ting trip continues. After handily netting
the Cougars and the Huskies in their
lairs this past weekend, the Cardinal will
continue its quest for conference carrion
tonight in the Golden Bears' den when
the squad faces California.
Stanford, rated No. 2 in the nation and
second in the Pacific 10 Conference, is
currently riding the longest winning
streak in school and Pac-10 history after
tallying its 16th straight win at Wash
ington on Saturday. The Cardinal is now
21-1 overall and 12-1 in the league.
Cal has not been so fortunate thus far
this season. The Bears have managed to
garner a winning 16-10 record overfill,
but have found themselves relegated to
seventh place in the Pac-10 with a disap
pointing 5-8 margin after splitting in
Washington last weekend.
Though clearly the underdog squad in
tonight's contest, the host is hardly hap
less. Cal traditionally plays well in front
of the Harmon Arena crowd and would
be happy to hand a loss to their cross-bay
Cardinal rival.
Add the motivation to the squad's solid
defense, and Stanford finds itself faced
with yet another potentially potent op

ponent. "Thev've been playing a lot better
lately than they did earlier in the year,"
Stanford Coach Don Shaw said. "They
lost a five-gamer at Washington, so I
know they're playing better."
Aside from gaining pride from almost
beating a difficult team, the Washington
match also gave the Bears a new school
record. Outside hitter Tiffany Rochelle, a
potent hitter when Stanford met Cal last
month in Maples Pavilion, tallied a record
high 31 kills to complement teammate
Lisa Arce's 28.
"We expect them to still go to Lisa Arce
and Tiffany Rochelle a majority of the
time, like the've done every other match
so far," Shaw added. "We know pretty
much who the ball is going to go to; we
just have to do a good job blocking and
defending them."
The Bears will not have the same
luxury of predictability when they at
ttempt to defend Stanford attacks. Car
dinal middle blocker Laura Olesen
reasserted her dominance at the net in
Washington by tallying 15 kills and a
whopping .393 percentage against the
Huskies, while middle blocker Amy
Cooper and right-side hitter Jennifer
Chaffee provided additional offensive sup
port. With a more balanced offense, Stan
ford should give Cal more than it can
