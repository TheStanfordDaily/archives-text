# Field hockey waits for NCAA decision
## 
### Greg Gottesman Staff writer 
Let's face it, November 7 is
really not that exciting of a day.
It suffers in comparison to No
vember 8, the day you are "sup
posed" to vote.
It's a Monday...
To Stanford's field hockey
team, however, November 7 is the
most important day of the year.
The final postseason rankings
come out November 7, and the
Cardinal needs to be situated in
the top 12 to make it into NCAA
Regionals November 12.
This past weekend at the Cal
Invitational, Stanford topped the
University of the Pacific and
Chico State and fell to California.
With the loss and two wins, Stan
ford concludes the season with a
record of 8-5-2 and a second-place
finish in the NorPac Conference
behind Chico State.
Against UOP, Michele Beynet
was Stanford's scoring as she ac
counted for both goals — one in
each period — in the Cardinal's
2-0 win. The win avenged an ear
lier loss to UOP October 12.
In the contest against Chico

State, Stanford had something to
prove. It had tied and lost to Chico
State earlier in the year and been
placed behind Chico in the final
NorPac rankings. Saturday's
game, however, had Chico State
looking for shelter. In the entire
game, Chico only took one shot
on the Cardinal goal — yes, one\
Stanford, although it only edged
Chico State 1-0, took a phenom
enal 29 shots. The Cardinal had
16 penalty corners to Chico's two.
Senior Kat Thomas kept her
status as the team's leading scorer
and was credited with Stanford's
lone goal.
"It was a good win. We
dominated from the start," Stan
ford Coach Sheryl Johnson said.
"We had lots of opportunities but
trouble scoring. It could have
easily been 5-0."
Tired after a week-long road
trip and two earlier games that
weekend, Stanford readied to face
Cal, probably the weakest team
the Cardinal had faced in almost
three weeks. Stanford ended up
losing the game 2-1. Thomas pro
vided Stanford's only spark with
a goal late in the second half. The
Cardinal got down 2-0 in the first
half and never could recover.
"Cal was more 'psyched' up
than us today. We let them get
up 2-0 and, when we had the
scoring opportunities to come
back, we just couldn't put it
away," Johnson commented.
Stanford now must wait until

November 7 to find out about
post-season play. According to
Johnson, the loss to Cal should
not affect the team's chance of
making Regionals. "I don't think
the loss to Cal is going to hurt
us. The road trip we took back
east should help. A lot of the mem
bers on the ranking committee
saw us play on the east coast, and
they know we have a strong team.
Right now, we just hope that they
give us a spot at Regionals,"
Johnson expounded.
