# Field hockey waits for NCAA decision

Let's face it, November 7 is
really not that exciting of a day.
It suffers in comparison to No
vember 8, the day you are "sup
posed" to vote.
It's a Monday...
To Stanford's field hockey
team, however, November 7 is the
most important day of the year.
The final postseason rankings
come out November 7, and the
Cardinal needs to be situated in
the top 12 to make it into NCAA
Regionals November 12.
This past weekend at the Cal
Invitational, Stanford topped the
University of the Pacific and

ford Coach Sheryl Johnson said.
"We had lots of opportunities but
trouble scoring. It could have
easily been 5-0."
Tired after a week-long road
trip and two earlier games that
weekend, Stanford readied to face
Cal, probably the weakest team
