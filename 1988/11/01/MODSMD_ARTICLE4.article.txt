# Law profs, oppose Prop. 102
## 
### John Wagner 
With a little more than a week remaining
before election day, Stanford administra
tors and faculty have entered the debate
over Proposition 102 â€” the controversial
AIDS initiative facing California voters.
University President Donald Kennedy,
the deans of both the Law School and
Medical School and 36 other Stanford Law
School professors have publicly pledged
strong opposition to Prop. 102 within the
past few days. The intiative will appear on
the Nov. 8 ballot.
If Prop. 102 is passed, AIDS testing
would no longer be anonymous, tests for
the AIDS virus would become a required
part of routine blood-test procedures and
partner notification would be required by
law. Noncompliance with releasing the
names of sexual partners would be grounds
for criminal charges under the terms of
the initiative.
Kennedy and Medical School Dean David
Korn were among the signers of a state
ment opposing Prop. 102 released Friday
by the presidents, chancellors and medical
school deans of several California univer
sities.
According to Korn, Stanford's involve
ment in opposing the initiative sprung from
a "fairly extensive set of research commit

ments ranging from newborns to adults."
These commitments would be detrimentally
affected by the passage of the iniative, Korn
said.
Kennedy was out of town and unavailable
for comment yesterday.
In the view of those medical educators
who signed the statement of opposition,
Prop. 102 would seriously impede critical
medical care and research programs that
are needed to solve medical and public
health problems associated with AIDS.
From a legal perspective, educators at
the Law School argued that Prop. 102
would infringe on constitutional rights to
privacy because of the bill's mandatory
disclosure of results.
Proponents of the ballot initiative, which
was introduced by Rep. William Dan
nemeyer, R-Orange County, claim the bill
would slow the spread of the AIDS virus
by making more asymptomatic carriers of
the disease aware of their condition
through mandatory tests.
In addition to Prop. 102 opponents here,
administrators from the University of Cal
ifornia schools and from the University of
Southern California pledged their opposi
tion to the ballot initiative in the statement.
"Prop. 102 would, in our opinion, un-
dermine sound medical and edu
cational programs now under way
in our universities and introduce
new policies based upon a misun
derstanding of the public health
and research needs," the state
ment said.
According to Korn, "Almost
every organization in the state
involved in health care" has
voiced opposition to Prop. 102. He
said the efforts to pass the initi
ative were "about the most bla
tant exhibit of disinformation" he
had ever seen. Advocates of the
initiative have been creating "fear,

ignorance and hysteria," he said.
While California Gov. George
Deukmejian endorsed Prop. 102
on Friday, Medical School spokes
man Spyros Andreoupoulas said
the statement of the medical ed
ucators was not intended as a
direct response to the endorse
ment by Deukmejian. The timing
of the two events was coincidental,
according to Andreoupoulas.
Law School Dean Paul Brest
and the other Stanford Law
School professors released a state
ment yesterday voicing their op
position to Prop. 102, in which
they said the initiative "threatens
the fundamental civil liberties of
all Californians" and "will hinder
current efforts to address the
AIDS crisis."

The statement signed by the law
professors was drafted by the Gay
and Lesbian Law Students Asso
ciation of Stanford. According to
group spokesman Michael Adams,
a second-year law student, the re
sponse of the law school faculty
to the draft was "tremendous."
All but one professor approached
by the group signed the statement,
Adams said.
Until recently Prop. 102 was
faring well in polls of California
voters, according to Adams. Due
to recent educational efforts, how
ever, voters are beginning to
realize that the initiative would
be a "fundamental invasion of
privacy" and would have "outra
geous consequences" on public
policy, he said.
