# Law profs, oppose Prop. 102

### John Wagner 
With a little more than a week remaining
before election day, Stanford administra
tors and faculty have entered the debate
over Proposition 102 â€” the controversial
AIDS initiative facing California voters.
University President Donald Kennedy,
the deans of both the Law School and
Medical School and 36 other Stanford Law
School professors have publicly pledged
strong opposition to Prop. 102 within the
past few days. The intiative will appear on
the Nov. 8 ballot.
If Prop. 102 is passed, AIDS testing
would no longer be anonymous, tests for
the AIDS virus would become a required
part of routine blood-test procedures and
partner notification would be required by
law. Noncompliance with releasing the
names of sexual partners would be grounds
for criminal charges under the terms of
the initiative.
Kennedy and Medical School Dean David
Korn were among the signers of a state
ment opposing Prop. 102 released Friday
by the presidents, chancellors and medical
school deans of several California univer
sities.
According to Korn, Stanford's involve
ment in opposing the initiative sprung from
a "fairly extensive set of research commit

ments ranging from newborns to adults."
These commitments would be detrimentally
affected by the passage of the iniative, Korn
said.
Kennedy was out of town and unavailable
for comment yesterday.
In the view of those medical educators
who signed the statement of opposition,
Prop. 102 would seriously impede critical
medical care and research programs that
are needed to solve medical and public
health problems associated with AIDS.
From a legal perspective, educators at
the Law School argued that Prop. 102
would infringe on constitutional rights to
privacy because of the bill's mandatory
disclosure of results.
Proponents of the ballot initiative, which
was introduced by Rep. William Dan
nemeyer, R-Orange County, claim the bill
would slow the spread of the AIDS virus
by making more asymptomatic carriers of
the disease aware of their condition
through mandatory tests.
In addition to Prop. 102 opponents here,
administrators from the University of Cal
ifornia schools and from the University of
Southern California pledged their opposi
tion to the ballot initiative in the statement.
"Prop. 102 would, in our opinion, un-
