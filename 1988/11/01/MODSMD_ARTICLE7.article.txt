# Workers ratify contract
## Union members overwhelmingly approve new agreement 
### Laura Jacobson Senior staff writer 
In a membership meeting that
spilled into the aisles of Dinkel
spiel Auditorium yesterday at
noon, employees of the United
Stanford Workers "overwhelm
ingly" ratified the contract agree
ment reached by the University
and the USW Sunday night, ac
cording to USW leaders.
"For the first time in the un
ion's history, there was unani
mous membership support" for
the new contract, USW steward
Linda Crouse said after the meet

After more than three months
of negotiations, the USW and the
University reached a contract
agreement by the skin of their

teeth, less than 12 hours before
the contract deadline set for noon

signed within the next couple of
weeks, will be the sixth USW-
University labor contract.
Yesterday's meeting, which
lasted for two hours, drew a crowd
of more than 750 workers, accord

The union represents more than
1,200 employees, but not all
workers represented by the union
choose to be members.
Of the workers who voted in
the secret ballot yesterday, 93 per
cent voted to ratify the contract,
USW chief negotiator Mary
Mocine said. But not every worker
voted, Crouse added. "In the end
everyone knew â€” the members

were unified around the issues."
University lawyer Michael Var
tain said after the ratification, "I
think everyone in the University
administration is pleased to see
the contract ratified.
"I think it is a fair one that
preserves the needs of the Uni
versity . . . and does answer the
reasonable needs of the workers,"
Vartain said.
"The agreement does not con
tain any significant changes from
the University point of view or
the union/worker point of view,"
Vartain said. "In the most signif
icant respects, it is the same con
tract," he added.
Raghib Haqq, president of the
USW, said he thought this con
