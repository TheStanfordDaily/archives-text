# Workers ratify contract
## Union members overwhelmingly approve new agreement 
### Laura Jacobson Senior staff writer 
In a membership meeting that
spilled into the aisles of Dinkel
spiel Auditorium yesterday at
noon, employees of the United
Stanford Workers "overwhelm
ingly" ratified the contract agree
ment reached by the University
and the USW Sunday night, ac
cording to USW leaders.
"For the first time in the un
ion's history, there was unani
mous membership support" for
the new contract, USW steward
Linda Crouse said after the meet
ing.
After more than three months
of negotiations, the USW and the
University reached a contract
agreement by the skin of their

teeth, less than 12 hours before
the contract deadline set for noon
yesterday. This contract, when
signed within the next couple of
weeks, will be the sixth USW-
University labor contract.
Yesterday's meeting, which
lasted for two hours, drew a crowd
of more than 750 workers, accord
ing to Crouse. Much of the meet
ing was spent signing in members.
The union represents more than
1,200 employees, but not all
workers represented by the union
choose to be members.
Of the workers who voted in
the secret ballot yesterday, 93 per
cent voted to ratify the contract,
USW chief negotiator Mary
Mocine said. But not every worker
voted, Crouse added. "In the end
everyone knew — the members

were unified around the issues."
University lawyer Michael Var
tain said after the ratification, "I
think everyone in the University
administration is pleased to see
the contract ratified.
"I think it is a fair one that
preserves the needs of the Uni
versity . . . and does answer the
reasonable needs of the workers,"
Vartain said.
"The agreement does not con
tain any significant changes from
the University point of view or
the union/worker point of view,"
Vartain said. "In the most signif
icant respects, it is the same con
tract," he added.
Raghib Haqq, president of the
USW, said he thought this con
tract can be a landmark one,
which may improve the thorny
University-USW relationship.
This contract is "an opportu
nity" with the "potential of im
proving the relations between
management and labor," Haqq
said.
Vartain agreed that the out
come of these negotiations may

be a "platform for improved
cooperation."
Changes from the 1985 contract
include:
• Wages. There will be a wage
increase plan of 5 percent the first
year, 4 percent the second year
and 4 percent the third year, with
a cost of living adjustment.
• Pension. A worker will receive
full pension benefits after five
years on the job, compared to 10
years in the 1985 agreement.
• Medical. A full-time employee
will receive a $48 per month sup

plementary contribution to his or
her medical plan, a four dollar
per month increase.
• Affirmative action committee.
A joint University-USW commit
tee, removed during a previous
contract settlement, was re
established. The committee, made
up of three individuals from each
side, will consult and recommend
training and apprenticeship pro
grams.
• Grievance procedure. A
review panel will be established
to decrease the back-log of pend

ing cases headed for arbitration.
• Stand-by pay. Beeper-carrying
workers receive 5 percent of base
salary for time on call.
• Zipper Clause. Restricts litiga
tion and disputes on issues the
union may raise that are not cov
ered by the contract during the
life of the contract.
• Employment procedures. The
University has the right to extend
the trial period for new employees
to over three months. The union
can no longer veto the University
on this issue.
