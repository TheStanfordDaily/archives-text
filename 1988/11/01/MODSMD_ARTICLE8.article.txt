# Campus racism widespread
## Incidents nationwide show cases here are not isolated 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
The recent incidents at Ujamaa
House have re-focused attention
on the issue of racism on college
campuses. And, while some have
questioned whether the incidents
at Stanford are worthy of cover
age in the national media, a sur
vey of college newspapers leaves
little doubt that the problem is
widespread.
For instance, several racial in
cidents have occurred at UC-
Berkeley within the last month.
The first incident occurred at the
beginning of October when four
black women passed a fraternity
house while they were walking
home. A fraternity member
shouted "niggers and whores" at
them from his second-story win
dow, according to The Daily
Californian, a student newspaper
there.
The women went to the house
entrance in an attempt to confront
the individual but other fraternity
members barred the women from
entering. The university reacted
by requiring the individual who
made the racial comments to write
a letter of apology to the women.
The university took no further ac
tion.
On Oct. 10, the lead story in
The Daily Californian reported a

second incident at Berkeley. A disc
jockey at a residence dance was
asked to play rap music and said,
"If you want to hear rap, go back
to Oakland."
The announcer then declared he
was a racist, played a rap song
and stated, "Once again the blacks
win out." His proclamation en
raged crowds and caused fights
to break out. The police had to
intervene and break up the dance.
As a result, the African Stu
dents Association, the Berkeley
equivalent of the Black Student

Union, has met with Berkeley's
Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman
to discuss racial incidents and
ways to prevent them. As yet, no
specific solutions have emerged.
On Oct. 20, The Daily Cardinal,
a student newspaper at the Uni
versity of Wisconsin at Madison,
reported that the Zeta Beta Tau
fraternity held a "slave auction"
in which members of the frater
nity dressed up as slaves and
painted their faces black. They
wore afro-wigs and did skits
derogating prominent black fig
ures.
There are two videotapes of the
event but neither has been re
leased by the fraternity. The Wis
consin Student Association Com
mittee on Student Organizations,
responsible for discipline of fra
ternities on campus, has refrained
from issuing a punishment until
it has viewed the tapes.
At the University of Virginia,
the FIJI fraternity distributed
fliers reading, "No nega babes"
and "No short wops". Nega is a
racist expression meaning "nig
ger" and wops is a slang expres
sion meaning "without papers."
The fraternity responded to
claims that the fliers were racist
by saying nega was short for nega
tive and wops was a nickname of
a fraternity member.
Shortly after the allegations of
racism, the words "The worst rac

ism is that falsely alleged" were
printed on Beta Bridge, the uni
versity's unofficial graffiti loca
tion.
According to Cavalier Daily as
sociate editor Jeff Sikkenga, many
see the Virginia campus as a
hotbed of racism. It "is perceived
(by most other colleges) as a school
that just lets blacks in because it
has to."
The University of Michigan has
also been victimized by racist in
cidents. According to Becky
Blumenstein, the editor of The
Michigan Daily, racism has esc
alated on campus over the past
two years.
Last year, in particular, the
University was inundated with
problems ranging from racial
fliers to allegations that its faculty
was racist.
Peter Steiner, the dean of the
university's Literature, Science
and Art Department, was accused
of writing a paper that stated mi
norities should not be allowed on
campus because they lower the
intellectual level of the classes.

Consequently, the university
implemented an anti-harrassment
code and announced that anyone
found distributing racist fliers or
being involved in any type of racial
incident would be expelled from
school.
Currently, administrators at
Michigan are discussing adding a
required course that would teach
students about other cultures and
races.
According to Blumenstein, the
atmosphere is very oppressive and
racial incidents are on the fore
front of the news at Michigan.
She added, however, that the
problem is far from solved. "There
are no decisive results yet, despite
much talk," Blumenstein said.
Last Tuesday, the Yale Daily
News reported a racial incident
on campus. Outside the Afro-
American Cultural Center a swas
tika with the words "White
Power" was painted on the wall.
At Harvard, there have been
discussions of institutional racism
but no specific incidents have been

reported this year.
At Harvard, students are re
quired to show identification
before entering many of the res
idences and buildings where
classes are held. Last year, police
were accused of singling out black
students and professors by requir
ing them to show identification
more often than white students.
Although Dartmouth reported
no racial incidents on campus as
yet, remnants of last year's racial
incidents are still present.
Last spring The Dartmouth
Review, a conservative campus
paper, violated regulations which
prohibit the taping of a teacher's
lectures. Members of The Review
illegally taped a lecture by Music
Prof. William Cole who is black
and then consequently ran a nega
tive article about Cole.
Two students were expelled as
a result, one of whom is currently
working for Sen. Dan Quayle, the
Republican vice-presidential can
didate. The Review is suing
Dartmouth for violating its rights
under the First Amendment.
