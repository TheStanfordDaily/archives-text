# Campus racism widespread
## Incidents nationwide show cases here are not isolated 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
The recent incidents at Ujamaa
House have re-focused attention
on the issue of racism on college
campuses. And, while some have
questioned whether the incidents
at Stanford are worthy of cover
age in the national media, a sur

little doubt that the problem is
widespread.
For instance, several racial in
cidents have occurred at UC-
Berkeley within the last month.
The first incident occurred at the
beginning of October when four
black women passed a fraternity
house while they were walking

by requiring the individual who
made the racial comments to write
a letter of apology to the women.
The university took no further ac

The Daily Californian reported a

second incident at Berkeley. A disc
jockey at a residence dance was
asked to play rap music and said,
"If you want to hear rap, go back
to Oakland."
The announcer then declared he
was a racist, played a rap song
and stated, "Once again the blacks
win out." His proclamation en
raged crowds and caused fights
to break out. The police had to
intervene and break up the dance.
As a result, the African Stu
dents Association, the Berkeley
equivalent of the Black Student

Union, has met with Berkeley's
Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman
to discuss racial incidents and
ways to prevent them. As yet, no
specific solutions have emerged.
On Oct. 20, The Daily Cardinal,
a student newspaper at the Uni
versity of Wisconsin at Madison,
reported that the Zeta Beta Tau
fraternity held a "slave auction"
in which members of the frater
nity dressed up as slaves and
painted their faces black. They
