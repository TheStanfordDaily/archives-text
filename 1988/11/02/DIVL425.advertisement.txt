ASSU NEWS
Racism at Stanford
The events at Ujamaa have brought the issue of racism to the Stanford community. Many students feel they oppose racism, but they don't
know what to do about it, or they have questions about everything that happened (like why is a defaced flyer such a big deal?)
It's time for all students to take action now to make the Stanford community a place that values all peoples and all cultures. Add your voice
to our discussions and your help to our efforts.
Come to the ASSU. Get involved...
Work on:
• Ethnic Studies
• Campus-Wide Forum on Racism
• Other ideas you bring to us...
