## Tight race likely in Israeli elections Likud party holds edge in forming coalition with religious parties 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) - The
right-wing Likud bloc and left
leaning Labor Party dueled head
to head in yesterday's parliamen
tary elections with the small re
ligious parties holding the balance
of power.
Likud leader Yitzhak Shamir
appeared to have the edge in form
ing a ruling coalition and said he
was convinced he could stay on
as prime minister with the help
of the religious parties.
But Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres said his Labor Party still
had a chance of luring religious
parties into a Labor-led coalition.
The election was widely viewed
as a crossroads in determining the
future of the occupied territories
and shaping Israel's policy for
dealing with its hostile Arab
neighbors. A Palestinian insurrec
tion has gone on for 11 months
in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, claiming the lives of
more than 300 Palestinians and
10 Israelis.
Labor advocated an interna

tional conference to talk peace
with the Arabs and proposed
sacrificing some of the occupied
land for a negotiated settlement.
Likud opposed both.
Intense negotiations were ex
pected to take place behind the
scenes today, with Labor leaders
wooing the Shas party, projected
to be the largest religious party
with six seats.
With 95 percent of the 4,800
polling stations reporting, Israel
army radio said Likud was
projected to get 39 seats and
Labor 38 in the 120-seat Knesset,
or parliament.
Likud and small right-wing par
ties together would have 46 seats.
Labor and small leftist parties
would have 56.
That would mean that Labor
and its allies would not have
enough votes to block formation
of a coalition between Likud and
the religious parties, which appear
more ideologically attuned to
Likud and are forecast to get 18
seats.

Israel television's exit polls pre
dicted Likud would have an edge
in forming a governing coalition.
A smiling Shamir told support
ers at campaign .headquarters he
believed Likud could get together
a majority of 61 seats.
"Based on the facts we have
before us, it seems that the situ
ation commands and enables the
Likud to form Israel's next gov
ernment," Shamir said in a na
tionally televised speech.
In a later TV interview, Shamir
opposed the idea of a national
unity government like the one
formed after 1984 elections ended
in deadlock, with Labor winning
44 and Likud 41 seats..
The 65-year-old Peres, grim
faced, said at Labor headquarters
his party was still in contention.
"The results of the election are
not yet final," he said.
He urged his followers,"Let's
not lose faith, and let's consider
the options for forming a govern
ment in the next 24 hours."
Yitzhak Rabin, the defense min

ister and a leading figure in
Labor, said "the key to who will
put together a government is in
the religious parites."
Peres noted that for Likud to
win, it would have to join with
the Moledet, or Homeland party.
The party headed by former Gen.
Rehavam Zeevi advocates trans
ferring the 1.5 million Palestini
ans from the occupied lands to
Arab countries.
Labor officials noted that Rabbi
Yitzhak Peretz of the Shas, a
party oriented to Sephardic Jews
of Middle East origin, left the door
open to a possible alliance with
Labor.
The 73-year-old Shamir
conceded that forming a govern
ment "would not be easy" and
negotiations might last for days.
In an obvious bid to woo reli
gious parties, Shamir said Likud
had never opposed a key Orthodox
demand to limit religious conver
sions to those approved by Or
thodox rabbis. The move could
alienate American Jews.
