NEW YORK (AP) - Republi
can presidential nominee George
Bush maintained a 12-point lead
in a national poll yesterday, but
more than a fifth of the voters
said they could change their
minds before next week's election.
The CBS News poll of 1,065
probable voters found no signifi
cant change in the past week:
Bush led Democrat Michael Du
kakis by 53-41 now, compared
with 54-41 last week. The new
poll was conducted Saturday
through Monday and had a mar

gin of error of plus or minus three
percentage points.
But there were signs of move
ment or potential movement. One
seventh of the voters said they
had decided in the past two weeks,
and 22 percent indicated they
could change their minds. An
other 6 percent hadn't decided yet.
Still, an overwhelming majority,
70 percent, said they thought
Bush would win the election,
while just 12 percent said they
thought Dukakis would win. The
remainder said they didn't know.

CBS sought to measure the
source of the opinions on who
would prevail. A plurality, 38 per
cent, said their expectation was
based chiefly on what they had
heard from the candidates; 22 per
cent said it was based on the polls;
and 12 percent said their view
was guided by opinions expressed
in the media.
As in other recent surveys, Du
kakis continued to suffer from a
high negative rating: Forty-one
percent had an unfavorable opin
ion of him; 33 percent, favorable.

One-seventh of the
voters said they
had decided in the
past two weeks.

Bush, by contrast, was rated fa
vorably by 46 percent to 33 per
cent. In both cases, the rest were

undecided or had no opinion.
Bush has held a healthy lead
over Dukakis in other recent polls,
enjoying a slightly lower seven
point advantage, 52-45, in a Har
ris poll done Friday through Sun
day, and 11 points, 52-41, in a
Gallup poll last week.
In some state polls:
• Dukakis was leading Bush by
seven points, 49-42, in Massachu
setts, according to a survey of 400
likely voters conducted Saturday
and Sunday. The margin of error
was plus or minus five points.

The survey was conducted for the
Boston Herald and WBZ-TV.
• In Colorado, Bush's lead over
Dukakis shrank from 19 points a
few days ago to 13 points, 52-39,
according to a Denver Post-News
4 survey of 450 people last Friday,
Saturday and Sunday. The survey
had a five-point margin of error.
• Bush and Dukakis were tied
in Pennsylvania, 46 points each,
according to a weekend survey of
792 registered voters by the
Philadelphia Daily News and
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
