PARIS (AP) â€” Cambodian
resistance leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk met yesterday with a
U.S. State Department official
who said Washington believes the
prince should lead any new Cam
bodian government emerging
from peace talks.
Paris is the venue for talks this
weekend between Sihanouk and
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen. It will be the third such meet
ing in France in the past year.
Sihanouk, the former Cam
bodian chief of state, is informal
leader of a coalition of three guer
rilla groups fighting the Phnom
Penh government and Vietnamese
forces occupying Cambodia.
The U.S. Embassy said Assis
tant Secretary of State Gaston
Sigur met the prince.
"He reiterated American confi

dence in Prince Sihanouk's central
role in that (peace) effort and our
belief that he should lead any
post-settlement government which
emerges," the statement said.
Sigur was to meet Deputy
Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev
of the Soviet Union today to dis
cuss Cambodia and other Asian
issues, it said. Rogachev also is
in Paris for the talks.
The official Cambodian news
agency SPK reported that Hun
Sen left Bangkok for Paris on
Monday.
SPK said Hun Sen's main guer
rilla opposition, the Khmer Rouge
communists, was resisting efforts
to exclude it from a miyor role in
a political settlement.
The Khmer Rouge and non
communist Khmer People's Na
tional Liberation Front boycotted

the first two rounds of talks in
France and evidently won't attend
the latest session.
The increasingly isolated
Khmer Rouge also did not attend
multilateral discussions in In
donesia last month.
There have been no break
throughs.
Peace proposals increasingly
have focused on ways to ensure
the Khmer Rouge, the most pow
erful guerrilla faction, does not
return to power. The Khmer
Rouge regime of Democratic Kam
puchea killed hundreds of thou
sands of people in its bid to radi
cally restructure Cambodian soci
ety from 1975 until late 1978,
when Vietnam invaded. Vietnam
installed the pro-Hanoi govern
ment Hun Sen leads.
