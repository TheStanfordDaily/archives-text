Man arrested for posing as priest
TRENTON, Ontario (AP) — Police arrested a
man yesterday who is accused of defrauding
Northwest Airlines by posing as a Roman Catholic
priest and counseling survivors of a jetliner crash
near Detroit last year.
John Irish, 47, faces charges in Wayne County,
Mich., of obtaining money under false pretenses
in an amount exceeding $100.
Irish allegedly defrauded Northwest Airlines
of about $1,100 in hotel and food charges while
he posed as "Father John Irish" and counseled
relatives of some of those killed in the Aug. 16,
1987 crash of Northwest Airlines Flight 255 at
Detroit Metropolitan Airport.
Britain's Thatcher to visit Poland
LONDON (AP) — Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, scourge of British labor and "Iron
Lady" to Moscow, arrives today in Poland, where

she is admired by its commuriist leaders and its
banned Solidarity trade union movement.
Adding to this paradox and increasing the dip
lomatic challenge of the three-day official trip,
the Polish government said Monday it will close
the Lenin shipyard, birthplace of Solidarity, be
cause it is unprofitable.
At a monument outside the shipyard at Gdansk
on Friday, Mrs. Thatcher is to lay a wreath with
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, an event the
British insisted on as a pre-condition of the visit.
Her domestic opponents charged that expres
sions of sympathy to Walesa would sound hollow
from the leader whose record includes eliminating
thousands of jobs in the British coal and steel
industries, and emasculating Britain's once
powerful labor unions.
Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, in a
British television interview soon after the closure
announcement, heaped new praise on Mrs.
Thatcher for what he called her "hard-handed
implementation of total economic efficiency."
