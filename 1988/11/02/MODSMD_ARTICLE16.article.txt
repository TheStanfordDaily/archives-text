## Vote no on Prop. 102 
### 
Prop. 102 will not help
stop spread of AIDS
and may do opposite

Taking the cue from the
ridiculous La√üouche AIDS
quarantine initiative of
1986, proponents of Proposition
102 hope to make AIDS-testing
results public.
While it is true that the acquired
immune deficiency syndrome is a
problem that society must swiftly
confront, Prop. 102 only plays upon
the hysteria surrounding a disease
that very few people understand.
It will not help the fight against
AIDS.
Instead, Prop. 102 will scare
away people who should be tested
for AIDS. The proposition also
poses economic problems and
endangers basic civil liberties.
Prop. 102 would require doctors,
blood banks and other health au
thorities to report the names of
donors or patients who test positive
for the human immunodeficiency
virus which causes AIDS. Under
Prop. 102, doctors and other med
ical practitioners would no longer
face stiff fines for revealing AIDS
patients' names.
In turn, health authorities would
be obligated to inform a patient's
spouse, sexual partner or others
who may have been exposed to the
virus. Under the proposition, per
sons with AIDS who knowingly
donate blood would be subject to
felony charges. Insurance compan -
ies and employers could use AIDS
tests to determine a person's fit
ness for insurance coverage or a
job.
Rather than stop the spread of
AIDS, Prop. 102 might very well
have the reverse effect.

Fearing public humiliation, in
dividuals might avoid AIDS test
ing. And, if people are afraid to
test for the virus, they may un
wittingly spread AIDS through the
blood supply or sexual relations.
Voluntary, confidential testing, on
the other hand, has proven effec
tive at mitigating the spread of
AIDS.
In addition to these problems,
Prop. 102 is also misleading.
It would broaden the scope of
public reporting so that people who
merely test positive for HIV will
be grouped with those who have
AIDS. But some people who test
positive for the virus never develop
AIDS.
It is also important to note that
Prop. 102 would have an enormous
fiscal impact. Depending on its im
plementation, the costs to public
health programs, medical authori
ties and prisons could reach into
the hundreds of millions of dollars.
These funds could be better spent
researching a cure for AIDS and
educating the public about its
spread.
Besides the fiscal impact, civil
liberties would be endangered. The
proposition would infringe on con
stitutional rights as doctors would
be forced to reveal the results of
confidential AIDS tests. For this
reason, 37 Stanford Law School
professors oppose the initiative.
Almost no health care organiza
tion in California has endorsed the
initiative. By the same token, the
California Medical Association, the
California Nurses Association, the
Health Officers' Association and
the Dean of the Stanford Medical
School vehemently oppose this bill.
Stopping the AIDS epidemic
should be a national priority. But
Prop. 102 does not offer a solution
to this public health problem. In
fact, the bill could make the crisis
worse.
