The Stanford Women's Center should not be political

THIS WEEKEND several mem
bers of Stanford Students for
Life participated in the Opera
tion Rescue pro-life protest at the
nearby Sunnyvale abortion clinic.
A Stanford Daily article on Oct. 31
asserts that I said that the 400 Opera
tion Rescue people "forced" out the
pro-choice counter-demonstrators who
were in front of the clinic. While there
was initially tension between the two
groups, no one forced anyone else
away from the entrances.
Furthermore, I was not arrested.
As the article mentioned, there were
also students from Stanford who partic
ipated in the pro-choice counter demon
stration, a group whose efforts were
organized through the Stanford Worn

en's Center.
It is unfortunate and highly inappro
priate that the Stanford Women's
Center participated in the coordination
of the Bay Area Coalition to Stop
Attacks on Abortion Clinics.
The Women's Center could be a
center for all women on campus which
sponsors a variety of programs on
women's issues. Instead, it is using
university funds to fight for the politi
cal agenda of the feminists.
The flier for the pro-choice demon
strators organizational meeting (which
listed the Stanford Women's Center
phone number for further information)
emphasized their claim to be "pro
choice." According to the flier from the
Women's Center, "To be 'pro-choice'

means to work to eradicate situations
where people are not offered choices."
If they are sincere in their efforts,
then being "pro-choice" would include
working to eradicate abortion, in which
human infants are offered no choice
about their death.
Furthermore, in their fight for
abortion on demand, the feminists
have failed to defend the most basic
right of a woman, no matter how old
she may be — namely, the right to
life.
It is ironic that the feminists' defini
tion of "equality" with men is the
right to imitate men rather than the
right to assert the female qualities of
women. By insisting that women have

a right to have abortions if they choose
to have sexual intercourse but do not
want to be pregnant, the feminists'
assert that they share the "right" of
men not to be pregnant.
If the Stanford Women's Center
wants to be a service to all women of
the Stanford Community and use their
allocated funds in a manner that is
beneficial to all with programs on such
issues as women's health; the center
should not be a coordination center for
left-wing political activities which
exclude many women who do not
subscribe to the feminists' political
agenda.
