# Phi Delts deserve credit and praise for public service
## 
### 
In the past year the Phi Delta Theta
fraternity has been the subject of front
page news stories. We, parents of
young children from the Escondido
Elementary School, feel that this fra
ternity should again be making head
lines — this time, in the name of
public service.
Friday, all the children had the op
portunity to tour a skillfully con
structed haunted house at their school.
This was a very large project, and one
that never would have happened with
out the tremendous contributions from
the Phi Delta Theta fraternity.
These fraternity members devoted
hours of time for the past two weeks
planning, organizing, setting up, run
ning and cleaning up the Escondido
haunted house. And then from early

Friday morning until late Friday after
noon, the fraternity members not only
escorted group after group of young
children but also dressed up and
staffed the various creative and im
aginative sets.
Aside from being impressed by their
dependability, enthusiasm and energy,
we were also trememdously impressed
by their sensitivity. Many of these
children are foreign and Halloween
customs are unknown to them;
younger children are easily scared.
These fraternity tour guides were mar
velous with all the children and auto
matically adjusted themselves to suit
the children's needs.
We feel that our elementary school
has gained another benefit from its
connections with Stanford: the friend
ship of Phi Delta Theta. Our special
thanks to Parker Blackman, Kirk Fer
guson, Scott Kitcher, Ed McCall, Ralph
McClusky, Roy McClusky, Russ
Pangborn, Clinton Payne, Nick Schaf
fzin, Chris Sy and Jim Walter.
