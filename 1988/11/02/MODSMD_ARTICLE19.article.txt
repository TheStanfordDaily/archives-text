# Swastika in dorm unnoticed in wake of racism debate
## 
### 
In "Campus racism widespread"
(Nov. 1), The Daily reported the preva
lence of racial incidents on American
campuses and the national attention
they have received.
The Daily reported those racial inci
dents directed at blacks. Yet, national
media attention has been given to
other racial and prejudiced incidents
which are also on the rise on American
campuses — incidents directed at wom
en, homosexuals and Jews as well.
These incidents also deserve our atten
tion.
It is therefore my intention in writ
ing this letter to publicize another
racist incident at Stanford; this one
directed more at Stanford's Jewish
community.
Until last week, there was a swas-

tika, a symbol of the Nazi Party,
painted on a basement wall in East
Lagunita.
During 1933-45, the Nazis perse
cuted minorities and Jews were the
prime target. The presence of their
symbol, the swastika, in 1988 at Stan
ford University is a painful reminder
of the Nazis' plans to annihilate the
Jewish race and is clearly anti-Semitic.
Last week, an employee of the Lagu
nita housing facilities office was told to
paint over the swastika. Yet, evidently
the employee was directed to do so
quietly. No publicity has been given to
the incident. Moreover, the University
administration has not made mention
of an impending investigation of the
matter.
It is vital that all prejudiced inci
dents such as this one be publicized
and investigated if Stanford is ever to
rid itself of racism, anti-Semitism and
all other forms of bigotry found on
campus.
