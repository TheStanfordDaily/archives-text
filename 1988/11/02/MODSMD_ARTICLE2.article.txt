# Hillel targeted with anti-Semitic fliers
## 
### Robert Landon Staff writer 
An anti-Semitic flier appeared on campus
this week and has left members shocked
and upset, according to Hillel officials.
The flier, which attacks "Holocaust
studies," was slipped under the office door
of the Hillel Foundation two nights ago.
A few other copies were distributed on
campus.
Jocelyn Reisman, the program director
at Hillel, was "disgusted" when she found
the flier. "People here are pretty angry,"
she said.
The fliers were published by the German-
American National Political Action Com
mittee, a Washington-based group that says
its aim is to stop prejudice against German-
Americans because of the Holocaust.
The group supports legislation that
would require universities to accept stu
dents according to strict racial, ethnic and
religious quotas.
The committee does not have an office
in the area, and its chair, Hans Schmidt,
told The Daily yesterday that he doesn't
know who distributed the fliers. "Even if
I did, I would not say," he said.
About 100,000 copies of the fliers have
been distributed nationwide, Schmidt said.
They read in part: "If you want more
Holocaust Studies, vote for Michael Duka
kis, and as if by magic, your wishes will
come true."
Explaining the purpose of the fliers,
Schmidt said, "Holocaust studies is based
on lies."
"Denying the validity of the Holocaust,

to say it is a hoax, to say it never happened
is an insult to the survivors and the families
of the people who were exterminated, and
to all people in general," said Reisman,
explaining why the fliers are anti-Semitic.
"To say that you should hide people from
[the Holocaust] is denying that it happened
. . . which is a gross insensitivity and bas
ically a lie itself."
To say one of the greatest crimes and
tragedies of the century is not worth study
ing is "pathetic," she added.
The incident left Director of the Row
Diana Conklin "speechless."
"We'll be very curious as to how the
fliers got where they ended up," she said.
Several classes at Stanford study the
Holocaust but there is no organized
Holocaust studies program here. Stanford's
Program in Jewish Studies offers a range
of classes for undergraduates and graduate
students.
English Prof, John Felstiner, who
teaches Holocaust literature, said he was
"not greatly alarmed" by the fliers. There
is "a perennial virus in the American
bloodstream" whose symptom is the
"periodic" occurance of anti-Semitic acts,
he said.
He thought this incident could have come
in the wake of the recent racist incidents
at Ujamaa, the black theme house. "People
are trying to get in on the action," the
professor said.
Kathy Cirksena, a graduate student in
communications, said she was "upset"
when she found a copy of the flier on her
car's windshield Sunday. She said
there were no fliers on nearby
cars. She said she might have been
singled out because her car has
several "liberal" bumper stickers,
but said she could think of no
other reasons.
Hillel's Reisman said the inci
dent was "especially horrible in
light of Kristallnacht coming up
this week."
Nov. 10 is the 50th anniversary
of Kristallnacht, the night when
Jewish storefronts were smashed
all over Germany, considered the

beginning of the Holocaust. The
occassion will be marked by can
dlelight vigils here and all over
the world.
Amy Schoneblum, assistant di
rector of the Anti-Defamation
League's Pacific Central Division,
a group that combats anti-
Semitism, also expressed concern
about a possible connection be
tween the fliers and Kristallnacht.
She said the fliers were "in
nocuous" compared to others dis
tributed by GANPAC, and called
the group "essentially anti-Israeli
and anti-Semitic."
Founded in 1982, GANPAC says
its primary goal is to promote
unity among German-Americans.

the world.
Amy Schoneblum, assistant di
rector of the Anti-Defamation
League's Pacific Central Division,
a group that combats anti-
Semitism, also expressed concern
about a possible connection be
tween the fliers and Kristallnacht.
She said the fliers were "in
nocuous" compared to others dis
tributed by GANPAC, and called
the group "essentially anti-Israeli
and anti-Semitic."
Founded in 1982, GANPAC says
its primary goal is to promote
unity among German-Americans.
