## The 						essence of midterms 
### 
WELL HERE WE ARE again, in
the midst of another round of
midterms. Oh what wondrous
times. Staying up late to study, and
wasting most of that time chatting.
Popping the Vivarin to get over the
three o'clock hump, only to use the
regained time as an excuse for more
chatting. And through the whole
debacle, punishing ourselves with the
thought that as soon as midterms are
over, we have to plunge headlong into
preparing for finals.
Which brings up a question that I
have, one that has surely been thunk
(sic) by many. Why do they have to
call them midterms? It can't be for
temporal clarification — I've had them
as early as week three and as late as
week eight. And it can't be to indicate
the urgency of the exam — I've had
from one to four of them.
The word "final" means something.
It means: this is a large part of your
grade, this is only one test and it
comes at the end. "Midterm" should
also give us some insight. If not, why
even bother using the word? Surely it
would be more economical just to say
"test."
Enough with the quibbling seman
tics, though. No matter how much I
whine, midterms won't change. I can,
however, learn to deal with them
better. Indeed, during my two years
here, coping methods have been
brought to my attention, and others I
have humbly devised myself.
This first one, I especially like. No
matter what anyone tells you, from

learning authorities on high to room
mates on low, last-minute studying
works!
Through much experience, I've
learned that if you sit down a few
hours before the test and absorb all
the random bits of information like a
sponge, it is then an easy matter of
walking in to the test room and
squeezing it all right back out on the
page. Of course, as soon as the test is
over you'll forget everything and have
to relearn it for the final. Neverthe
less, it frees up pre-test time for plenty
of idle chatting.
Another midtermer swears by this
next, slightly more extreme, method.
He advises that, if at all possible,
contract a cold before your midterms.
The rational is that you'll be so
miserable, the added misery of
secluded study will seem laughable in
comparison. On top of that, you won't
be able to chat about the iorm be
cause no one will want to see your
coughing face. And you can't exactly
go out and do stuff, at least not with
out paying unmentionable prices. So,
with a cold, you have no other option
but to study hard and do well.
But how does one approach that
curious mutation of the midterm called
the take-home midterm? It has a very
deceptive character. Innocently, you
may receive the take-home thinking
you have plenty of time, and you are
free to look at all the texts and go
over all the notes to find your
answers, and oh how painless. But the
professor didn't give you the take-home

so you could kick back.
So, the only recourse here is to work
on the curve. When classmates ask you
how its going, tell them you finished it
in about an hour, and that you were
sure you heard the professor say not
to spend too much time on it. Crazed
midtermers are very gullible.
In relation to in-class midterms this
technique also works, and in this
respect it lends itself to a little more
plasticity. The day prior to the test,
you can either tell your mates that
you don't feel it necessary to study,
hoping that they'll agree. Or, you can
tell them you've been studying fever
ishly for weeks and you still feel like
you're not totally prepared. This will
leave them with a sense of utter hope
lessness and dejection, thus inhibiting
good cramming. Although I haven't
used this method myself, I can attest
to its diabolical effectiveness by saying
I've been its naive victim many times.
Midterms are like the carrot out on
the end of the stick. They're the incen
tive to study. And in being so, they
represent a lack of faith on part of the
academic institution in our willingness
to learn ideas for their own sake, and
for reasons of personal glory or shame.
