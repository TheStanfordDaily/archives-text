## From matchbox cars to the Aerobie: Stanford inventors patent playfulness 
### Eric Mu√±oz 
Everyone gets the creative itch, the
inspiration for a revolutionary kiwi fruit
peeler, an idea for a more effective
means of cleaning the bathtub, the per
fect answer to the lost-sock-in-the-dryer
syndrome. Few ever act on the imagina
tion.
Stanford, however, boasts some of
those few innovators who have scratched
the creative itch, and translated idea
into product.
Since 1977, the University has re
ceived about $34,302,400 in royalties
from the sale of patented Stanford in
ventions, according to Sally Hines, rep
resentative from the Office of Tech
nology Licensing, the University office
responsible for patent royalties.
Some of these millions have been rev
enue from patented toys, the material
expression of Stanford students' yen for
play, witnessed on campus and trans
lated into big business off campus.
One innovation soaring from the
Farm onto green fields and store shelves
around the country is the Aerobie, a
hi-tech variation of the Frisbee. Some
combination of ingenuity and laziness
inspired Alan Adler, a lecturer in Prod
uct Design, to accelerate the Frisbee's
evolution to a higher form.

Since 1977, the Univer
sity has received
about $34,302,400 in
royalties from the sale
of patented Stanford
inventions.

Believing he was "wasting too much
energy" throwing a heavy frisbee
through the air, Prof. Adler determined
to design a Frisbee which would travel
farther and would be easier to use. The
deceivingly simple, firm, but flexible

ring known as the Aerobie emerged
after years of Adler's research into the
aerodynamics and mechanics of the toy.
In light of another form of Stanford
spawned plaything, there may be some
truth in the comparison of Stanford
students to Ken and Barbie dolls. Or
the perception that students treat cars
as if they were toys. Responsibility for
these frivolous parallels lies somewhere
within the synapses of Jack Ryan's
brain. Ryan, a Stanford graduate,
founded Mattel Toys which manufac
tures both Barbie dolls and matchbox
cars.
Another toy line created by a Stanford
inventor indirectly prepares youngsters
at an early age for future admittance
to his alma mater. The toys called "Im
aginaction," designed by graduate Bill
Burnette and partner John Tompane,
exercise children's creativity and
resourcefulness. For example, "Squeez
ington Square" is a simple town com
posed of cloth-foam structures, threaded
inside with a stiff skeletal vein making

the pieces pliable. Kids can fashion in
dividual town pieces into anything they
imagine.
Burnette and Tompane have also
created an innovative game called
"Block Sensation," a chain of blocks
containing sensory devices, such as a
cat meow generated by a simple hydrau
lic unit or fragrance box which gives
off an orange scent.
Tompane said he observes a market
trend towards dry, unstimulating games
and children's products. He aims to
change this stagnancy with creations
designed to arouse a tot's imagination
and ingenuity.
Even before inventing becomes liv
lihood, students in classsrooms around
campus generate both novelties and use
ful devices in almost an innovative
frenzy to create and perfect.
For example, students in the Com
puter Science Department have devised
a "gopher robot" which drives along the
floor carrying messages or other items,
and senses obstacles in its way. Running
according to a preprogrammed set of

instructions, once the robot arrives at
its destination, it is ready to start the
process over again.
In a class called Smart Product
Design, Mechanical Engineering 218 c,
students have created the couch-potato
sugar-lover's dream machine: an
automated marshmallow thrower which
accurately hurls marshmallows into the
mouth of the anticipating sofa spud.
For instance, while watching the
wrathful Stay-puf Marshmallow Man on
the "Ghostbusters" video, safe and com
fortable viewers would have only to
move their jaw to sublimely swallow
several soaring marshmallows.
Fun and games is a profitable indus
try, as many of Stanford's toy inventors
have discovered. Nonetheless, not all
the money generated from the sale of
products originating on the Farm winds
up in the creator's pocket, according to
Hines. Revenue from projects conducted
under sponsored research agreements
with outside companies or corporations
is divided into thirds between the in
ventor, the department overseeing the
project, and the school in charge of the
department.

from the sale of patented Stanford in
ventions, according to Sally Hines, rep
resentative from the Office of Tech
nology Licensing, the University office
responsible for patent royalties.
Some of these millions have been rev
enue from patented toys, the material
expression of Stanford students' yen for
play, witnessed on campus and trans
lated into big business off campus.
One innovation soaring from the
Farm onto green fields and store shelves
around the country is the Aerobie, a
hi-tech variation of the Frisbee. Some
combination of ingenuity and laziness
inspired Alan Adler, a lecturer in Prod
uct Design, to accelerate the Frisbee's
evolution to a higher form.

Since 1977, the Univer
sity has received
about $34,302,400 in
royalties from the sale
of patented Stanford
inventions.

Believing he was "wasting too much
energy" throwing a heavy frisbee
through the air, Prof. Adler determined
to design a Frisbee which would travel
farther and would be easier to use. The
deceivingly simple, firm, but flexible

ring known as the Aerobie emerged
after years of Adler's research into the
aerodynamics and mechanics of the toy.
In light of another form of Stanford
spawned plaything, there may be some
truth in the comparison of Stanford
students to Ken and Barbie dolls. Or
the perception that students treat cars
as if they were toys. Responsibility for
these frivolous parallels lies somewhere
within the synapses of Jack Ryan's
brain. Ryan, a Stanford graduate,
founded Mattel Toys which manufac
tures both Barbie dolls and matchbox
cars.
Another toy line created by a Stanford
inventor indirectly prepares youngsters
at an early age for future admittance
to his alma mater. The toys called "Im
aginaction," designed by graduate Bill
Burnette and partner John Tompane,
exercise children's creativity and
resourcefulness. For example, "Squeez
ington Square" is a simple town com
posed of cloth-foam structures, threaded
inside with a stiff skeletal vein making

the pieces pliable. Kids can fashion in
dividual town pieces into anything they
imagine.
Burnette and Tompane have also
created an innovative game called
"Block Sensation," a chain of blocks
containing sensory devices, such as a
cat meow generated by a simple hydrau
lic unit or fragrance box which gives
off an orange scent.
Tompane said he observes a market
trend towards dry, unstimulating games
and children's products. He aims to
change this stagnancy with creations
designed to arouse a tot's imagination
and ingenuity.
Even before inventing becomes liv
lihood, students in classsrooms around
campus generate both novelties and use
ful devices in almost an innovative
frenzy to create and perfect.
For example, students in the Com
puter Science Department have devised
a "gopher robot" which drives along the
floor carrying messages or other items,
and senses obstacles in its way. Running
according to a preprogrammed set of

instructions, once the robot arrives at
its destination, it is ready to start the
process over again.
In a class called Smart Product
Design, Mechanical Engineering 218 c,
students have created the couch-potato
sugar-lover's dream machine: an
automated marshmallow thrower which
accurately hurls marshmallows into the
mouth of the anticipating sofa spud.
For instance, while watching the
wrathful Stay-puf Marshmallow Man on
the "Ghostbusters" video, safe and com
fortable viewers would have only to
move their jaw to sublimely swallow
several soaring marshmallows.
Fun and games is a profitable indus
try, as many of Stanford's toy inventors
have discovered. Nonetheless, not all
the money generated from the sale of
products originating on the Farm winds
up in the creator's pocket, according to
Hines. Revenue from projects conducted
under sponsored research agreements
with outside companies or corporations
is divided into thirds between the in
ventor, the department overseeing the
project, and the school in charge of the
department.
