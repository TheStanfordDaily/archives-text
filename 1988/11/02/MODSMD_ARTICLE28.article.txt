## Drama Department goes Greek 
### Ruben Garcia 
The Stanford Drama Department
presents a slightly contemporized ver
sion of the 2500 year-old Sophoclean
tragedy "Antigone" beginning tonight
in the Little Theater at Memorial Au
ditorium.
"Antigone" is a classic story which
questions whether the citizens' respon
sibility to the state is less important
than their moral priorities.
In the play, Antigone is a rebellious
female in a society that is largely con
trolled by males. She goes against the
governmental authority of her Uncle
Creon when she buries Plyneices, her

brother and a traitor of the state. Her
dissension leads not only to her suicide,
but also to that of her lover Haemon.
The language of the modern transla
tion by Don Taylor used in this pro
duction "will make it more accessible
to us, and hopefully, to the audience,"
said director Rob Baker, a third-year
doctoral student. "We wanted language
that didn't seem insurmountable or
foreboding."
In keeping with the spirit of the
modern translation, the costuming also
has a modern look. Most of the actors
are dressed in military fatigues instead
of the flowing robes usually associated
with classical drama.

Baker stressed, however, that many
of the classical aspects of "Antigone"
have been preserved. The play's six po
etic odes retain much of the ancient
dialogue of Sophocles' original and are
accented by haunting drums and a solo
bassoon.
Since the play is set in Thebes after
a civil war, the background is mostly
ruined Greek architecture.

"Antigone" plays tonight through Sat
urday, Nov. 5, and Nov. 9-12 at 8 p.m.
in the Little Theater at Memorial Au
ditorium. Tickets are available at Tres
idder or at the door, $4 for students
and seniors, $7 for others.
