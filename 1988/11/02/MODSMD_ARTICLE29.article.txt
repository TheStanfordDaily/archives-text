BERKELEY - With carols rin
ging through the bus during the
entire ride home, it seemed that
Christmas had come early for the
Cardinal. Culminating in an in
tensely exciting third game, the

Women's Volleyball
Cardinal 3, Golden Bears 0

No. 2 Stanford women's volleyball
team got just the present it asked
for when the squad upended cross
bay rival California 15-9, 15-8, 17-
15 in front of a vocal Harmon
Gym-record crowd of 1,347.
With the victory, Stanford ups
its win streak to a school-record
17 straight matches and improves
to 22-1 overall, 13-1 in the Pacific
10 Conference. Cal falls to 16-11,
5-9 and seventh in the league.

Judging solely by the first two
games, it seemed that the Cardi
nal would have little trouble
besting the Bears. Though Cal
scored streaks of points to gain a
several-point .lead in the opening
moments of each game, Stanford
answered in kind and handily
pulled out a 2-0 advantage.
"Each game started off pretty
slowly," Cardinal captain Laura
Olesen said. "It always makes you
wonder about how you're going
to continue to play. But everyone
pulled together, and I thought we
looked pretty good."
After the intermission, Stanford
continued to excel, moving out to
a quick 7-0 lead. Reminiscent of
last week's 15-0 third-game win
over San Jose State, a game three
shutout seemed to be the Cardi
nal's destiny.
An errant hit by outside hitter
Kristin Klein put Cal's first point
of the game on the board, and
then the battle began. After a se

ries of side-outs, the Bears closed
the gap to a mere four points
before the Cardinal scored again.
After Stanford garnered its ninth
point, the home team came alive.
In just 10 plays, the Bears capi
talized on Stanford errors and
moved to within two.
"It was definitely frustrating to
side-out and not be able to convert
on the point-scoring opportuni
ties," setter Lara Asper said.
Cal, on the other hand, made
the most out of the openings they
were given and came within a pan
cake dig of forcing a fourth game.
The Cardinal fought for a 12-9
lead, only to have a series of costly
mistakes tie the game at 12 and
then 13.
Cal middle blocker Holly
Hutchinson then took the service
line, uncorking a rapid serve that
hit the floor for an ace. With game

point at hand, it seemed that Cal
would stave off the Cardinal at
least temporarily. Hutchinson
served into the net on the next
play, however, and the battle con
tinued.
Two plays later, Stanford
regained the initiative and pulled
itself back into the game. A Stan
ford attempt was soundly stopped
at the net, but an outstretched
Amy Hayes covered the shot with
an incredible pancake dig on the
sideline. The set went to Olesen,
who hit from behind the 10-foot
line to earn the crucial kill.
"We had one long rally toward
the end of the game and Hayzee
reached back to save an off-set
which dribbled over the net and

landed on the line," Asper
recalled. "I looked over at the
bench and (Stanford Coach) Don
(Shaw) was laughing. I think this
was the turning point at the end
of the match."
Cal did not recover. The two
teams continued fighting for the
lead, but the momentum had
clearly shifted to the now-inspired
Cardinal. A stellar dig by Amy
Cooper went smoothly into
Asper's hands, who dished off to
Klein for the winning kill.
But the real hero for the Car
dinal was outside hitter Jennifer
Chaffee, who simply overpowered
the small Cal blockers and scored
almost at will. All told, the junior
tallied a match-high 16 kills, 15
digs and an amazing .433 hitting
percentage.
"Chaffee's been playing great
lately," Asper said. "She comes
through in the clutch for us."
