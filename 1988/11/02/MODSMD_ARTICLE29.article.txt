BERKELEY - With carols rin
ging through the bus during the
entire ride home, it seemed that
Christmas had come early for the
Cardinal. Culminating in an in
tensely exciting third game, the

Women's Volleyball
Cardinal 3, Golden Bears 0

No. 2 Stanford women's volleyball
team got just the present it asked
for when the squad upended cross
bay rival California 15-9, 15-8, 17-
15 in front of a vocal Harmon
Gym-record crowd of 1,347.
With the victory, Stanford ups
its win streak to a school-record
17 straight matches and improves
to 22-1 overall, 13-1 in the Pacific
10 Conference. Cal falls to 16-11,
5-9 and seventh in the league.

Judging solely by the first two
games, it seemed that the Cardi
nal would have little trouble
besting the Bears. Though Cal
scored streaks of points to gain a
several-point .lead in the opening
moments of each game, Stanford
answered in kind and handily
pulled out a 2-0 advantage.
"Each game started off pretty
slowly," Cardinal captain Laura
Olesen said. "It always makes you
wonder about how you're going
to continue to play. But everyone
pulled together, and I thought we
looked pretty good."
After the intermission, Stanford
continued to excel, moving out to
a quick 7-0 lead. Reminiscent of
last week's 15-0 third-game win
over San Jose State, a game three
shutout seemed to be the Cardi
nal's destiny.
An errant hit by outside hitter
Kristin Klein put Cal's first point
of the game on the board, and
then the battle began. After a se

ries of side-outs, the Bears closed
the gap to a mere four points
before the Cardinal scored again.
After Stanford garnered its ninth
point, the home team came alive.
In just 10 plays, the Bears capi
talized on Stanford errors and
moved to within two.
"It was definitely frustrating to
side-out and not be able to convert
on the point-scoring opportuni
ties," setter Lara Asper said.
Cal, on the other hand, made
the most out of the openings they
were given and came within a pan
cake dig of forcing a fourth game.
The Cardinal fought for a 12-9
lead, only to have a series of costly
mistakes tie the game at 12 and
then 13.
Cal middle blocker Holly
Hutchinson then took the service
line, uncorking a rapid serve that
hit the floor for an ace. With game

performances on the team last night against Cal, tallying 11 kills and 13 digs.
