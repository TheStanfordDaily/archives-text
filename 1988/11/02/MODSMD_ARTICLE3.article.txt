# Res Ed may fund trip for Ujamaa residents to relieve tension

### Janine DeFao 
As a means of relieving the tensions
in Ujamaa House caused by recent racial
incidents there, Residential Education has
offered to spend several hundred dollars
to help subsidize a weekend vacation for
the residents, according to a Res Ed of
ficial.
The purpose of the outing, proposed
by the Ujamaa residence staff, would be
to "get out of the dorm, away from the
controversy, away from Stanford," said
Ujamaa Resident Assistant lan
O'Donnell.
The trip would be a social one, rather
than a retreat focusing on discussion of
the incidents. "That's what we're trying

to avoid," O'Donnell said. Residents have
considered Tahoe, Yosemite and Dis
neyland as possible sites.
Rachel Wiesen, an RAin Ujamaa, added

that Ujamaa needs to
"regroup as a dorm and
rebuild unity."
"If people in the house
feel this is a good idea,
we (Res Ed) are willing
to support it," said Alice
Supton, associate dean of
student affairs for Res
Ed. According to Supton,
Res Ed and Ujamaa

would share the trip's cost.
Supton said she believes the trip would
help relieve the stress which must still

be present in the house. "Two weeks later
it is good if people appear normal, but
when you have been through an emo
tionally devastating time it stays with
you, it's in you."
"We need to get away and feel together
again," said Ryan Drant, an Ujamaa
freshman. "The whole incident ruined the
groundwork laid by orientation and the
first week."
However, Junior Justin Adams dis
agreed. "I don't need it, but I wasn't as
affected by the events as some others,"
he said. "Unity is being built as the dorm
comes to grips with the entire situation.
I don't think a vacation will do anything,
but gloss over the problem."
"It's hard to take [the trip] seriously,"

said sophomore Jon Zimmerman. "It's
like we won a lottery. The dorm is going
to go somewhere and we get to choose.
It's a nice gesture, but I don't know if

it will work."
He added that at this point the effects
of the incidents "have pretty much blown
over."
However, Kevin Anderson, an RAin
Ujamaa, said, "The tension is dying down,
but it's still around. I wouldn't say the
dorm has been destroyed, but there is
damage done."
O'Donnell said the Ujamaa staff would
like the trip to take place in the near
future because "the farther away it gets,
the more purpose it loses." Supton
agreed, but said that did not mean she
would not support the trip if it had to
be taken later.
"We're trying to economize," Supton
said.
