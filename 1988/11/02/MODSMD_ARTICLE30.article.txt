# Rhett is a Harty addition to soccer squad
## Freshman makes an immediate impact as Cardinal's leading scorer 
### Steven Apfelberg 
Although only a freshman, 6-
foot-1, 172-pound Rhett Harty is
leading the way on the Stanford
men's soccer team.
Harty leads the team in scoring.
He has already booted seven goals
this season. He is one of the
team's two forwards. Judging by
what Harty has done this season,
he will play a major role in the
team's improvement over the next
few years.
At age six, Harty started play
ing. When he was 10, he decided
to play competitively and joined
a club team. His father influenced
his game a great deal until Harty
was 17.
As a freshman at Sevite High
School in Anaheim, Harty suf
fered a major setback when he
broke his right wrist. The injury
was so extreme that he couldn't
play for two years.
"It was awful. I just sat on the
sidelines and was really out of
shape," he said.
Finally, as a high school junior,
Harty returned to the field. His
junior year served as a comeback
year, and prepared him for his
stellar senior year. During his
senior year, Harty earned many
honors besides those from high
school soccer.

He made the district, state,
regional and, ultimately, the na
tional team for men under 20. He
traveled with the national team
to Mexico and Guatemala. He also
led a winning high school team.
Subsequently, he was recruited
by the top soccer colleges in the
nation — Virginia, Duke and
UCLA. Stanford and Santa Clara
were the other schools that inter
ested him. Attributing his success
more to club soccer than to high
school, Harty stressed that his
high school coach, Lou Dennis,
was also very important in his
development.
Harty went to Virginia on a
recruiting visit and loved it. He
returned to Anaheim from Vir
ginia the night he was to leave
for Guatemala. His college deci
sion had to be made. Harty took
a nap before deciding, though.
Upon waking up, he knew that
Stanford was the right choice. He
immediately called Stanford
Coach Sam Koch to let him know.
The choice was truly right, as
Harty claimed, "I'm so happy
here. I couldn't imagine myself
anywhere else."
When he showed up in August,
Hardy was anxious about playing
with the upperclassmen. How
ever, after a few days of practice,
he felt comfortable.

When he arrived, he wasn't sure
if he could start. Harty surely did
not imagine that he'd be leading
the team in scoring midway
through the season. He finds the
upperclassmen to be helpful and
supportive.
He also feels that the team has
more talent than their 8-9 won
loss record indicates. "Sometimes,
we don't understand our record
because we know we have so much
potential," he said.

'Soccer gives me a
thrill. It has been my
whole life, I don't
know what I'd do
without it.'
— Rhett Harty

The Cardinal season will most
likely end in the middle of No
vember. That, by no means, will
be the end of Harty's season. In
January, he will hopefully travel
to Saudi Arabia to play on the
U.S. Junior World Cup team.
After his four years of Stanford
soccer, he hopes to play on the

U.S. Olympic team in Barcelona
in 1992.
"Soccer gives me a thrill. It has
been my whole life," Harty said.
I don't know what I'd do without
it."
Although he feels this way, he
realizes that the sport can't offer
him much beyond the Olympics,
since he doesn't want to play
professionally. After the Olym
pics, Harty will stop playing the
sport competitively.
When questioned about Ameri
can soccer, Harty, who still wears
a brace to protect his weak-boned
wrist, explains that it is improv
ing.
"The other day, a friend and I
were in a restaurant. A kid entered
in a soccer uniform instead of a
baseball one. That made me smile.
The popularity and level of play
of American soccer is rising,"
Harty said.
He cited the success of our
Olympic team in Seoul as an ex
ample. He said, "By the 1994
World Cup, we will be a force to
be reckoned with." One thing is
for sure, as a member of the Stan
ford Cardinal men's soccer team,
Rhett Harty is a force to be
reckoned with now and for the
next three years.

he felt comfortable.

When he arrived, he wasn't sure
if he could start. Harty surely did
not imagine that he'd be leading
the team in scoring midway
through the season. He finds the
upperclassmen to be helpful and
supportive.
He also feels that the team has
more talent than their 8-9 won
loss record indicates. "Sometimes,
we don't understand our record
because we know we have so much
potential," he said.

The Cardinal season will most
likely end in the middle of No
vember. That, by no means, will
be the end of Harty's season. In
January, he will hopefully travel
to Saudi Arabia to play on the
U.S. Junior World Cup team.
After his four years of Stanford
soccer, he hopes to play on the

U.S. Olympic team in Barcelona
in 1992.
"Soccer gives me a thrill. It has
been my whole life," Harty said.
I don't know what I'd do without
it."
Although he feels this way, he
realizes that the sport can't offer
him much beyond the Olympics,
since he doesn't want to play
professionally. After the Olym
pics, Harty will stop playing the
sport competitively.
When questioned about Ameri
can soccer, Harty, who still wears
a brace to protect his weak-boned
wrist, explains that it is improv
ing.
"The other day, a friend and I
were in a restaurant. A kid entered
in a soccer uniform instead of a
baseball one. That made me smile.
The popularity and level of play
of American soccer is rising,"
Harty said.
He cited the success of our
Olympic team in Seoul as an ex
ample. He said, "By the 1994
World Cup, we will be a force to
be reckoned with." One thing is
for sure, as a member of the Stan
ford Cardinal men's soccer team,
Rhett Harty is a force to be
reckoned with now and for the
next three years.

Freshman forward Rhett Harty has been a heads-up player for the
Cardinal soccer squad this season. His 17 points qualify him as
the team's leading scorer.
Although only a freshman, 6-
foot-1, 172-pound Rhett Harty is
leading the way on the Stanford
men's soccer team.
Harty leads the team in scoring.
He has already booted seven goals
this season. He is one of the
team's two forwards. Judging by
what Harty has done this season,
he will play a major role in the
team's improvement over the next
few years.
At age six, Harty started play
ing. When he was 10, he decided
to play competitively and joined
a club team. His father influenced
his game a great deal until Harty
was 17.
As a freshman at Sevite High
School in Anaheim, Harty suf
fered a major setback when he
broke his right wrist. The injury
was so extreme that he couldn't
play for two years.
"It was awful. I just sat on the
sidelines and was really out of
shape," he said.
Finally, as a high school junior,
Harty returned to the field. His
junior year served as a comeback
year, and prepared him for his
stellar senior year. During his
senior year, Harty earned many
honors besides those from high
school soccer.

He made the district, state,
regional and, ultimately, the na
tional team for men under 20. He
traveled with the national team
to Mexico and Guatemala. He also
led a winning high school team.
Subsequently, he was recruited
by the top soccer colleges in the
nation — Virginia, Duke and
UCLA. Stanford and Santa Clara
were the other schools that inter
ested him. Attributing his success
more to club soccer than to high
school, Harty stressed that his
high school coach, Lou Dennis,
was also very important in his
development.
Harty went to Virginia on a
recruiting visit and loved it. He
returned to Anaheim from Vir
ginia the night he was to leave
for Guatemala. His college deci
sion had to be made. Harty took
a nap before deciding, though.
Upon waking up, he knew that
Stanford was the right choice. He
immediately called Stanford
Coach Sam Koch to let him know.
The choice was truly right, as
Harty claimed, "I'm so happy
here. I couldn't imagine myself
anywhere else."
When he showed up in August,
Hardy was anxious about playing
with the upperclassmen. How
ever, after a few days of practice,
he felt comfortable.

if he could start. Harty surely did
