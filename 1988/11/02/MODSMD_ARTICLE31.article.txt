# The 						rumblings have begun: Will they give'em the axe?
## 
### 
On December 14, 1983, John A.
(Jack) Elway Sr. was named the
28th football coach in Stanford
history.
He replaced Paul Wiggin who, in four
years here, compiled a 16-28 record as
head coach of the Cardinal including a
1-10 mark in his final season.
It was time for a change. Even in the
First Elway Era, with the great John Jr.
at quarterback, the team never managed
better than a 6-5 record. There were no
bowl bids since a 1978 appearance in the
Bluebonnet Bowl. Bill Walsh was coach
back then.
Stanford found its replacement only 20
miles south of the Farm. Down at San
Jose State, the senior Elway was piloting
the Spartans. Between 1979 and 1983,
San Jose State won 35, lost 20 and tied
one under his tutelage — a .634 winning
percentage.
As a matter of fact, father Jack out
foxed the very team led by his son John.
The Cardinal fell to the Spartans in each
of the years the Elways locked horns.
Thus, when Elway arrived here it was

with much fanfare. Happy days were here
again. A Rose Bowl appearance, after a
13-year hiatus, was just around the cor
ner.
Reality struck in the new coach's first
year, however. The Cardinal took to the
gridiron and came away with but five
wins.
The next year, 1985, was even worse.
Stanford would emerge victorious in only
four contests that year. Five losing sea
sons in a row.
At the time I was a freshman. The
only thing I knew about Stanford football
was the story of The Play — the great

fiasco-kickoff-return-for-touchdown of
'83 Big Game fame.
I figured it was normal for Stanford
to lose.
In 1986, I would learn just how wrong
I was.
The team broke out of the gate running
and cflptured its first four games. The
Associated Press poll placed the squad
in the promised land — the Top 20. It
seemed that nothing could stand in their
way.
Stanford split its next four games
bringing the overall tally to 6-2. A bowl
bid was there for the taking and only
one thing stood in the way — UCLA.
The Cardinal went down to Southern
California in the hopes of vanquishing
the mighty Bruins. Representatives from
seven bowl games and a near-national
television audience watched the game.
The team broke out early and led 14-0
after the first quarter. Behind the in
credible running of Brad Muster, the Car
dinal led throughout. But UCLA charged
back. In the game's waning minutes, with
Stanford clinging to a 28-23 lead, the

Bruins were driving down the field.
The Cardinal forced a fourth-and-one
with barely over two minutes left on the
clock. Matt Stevens handed off to his
star running back Gaston Green. Stan
ford strong safety Brad Humphreys met
Green at the line and knocked him for
a two-yard loss.
The victory was preserved. Stanford
was going bowling.
Despite a 27-21 defeat at the hands of
the Clemson Tigers in the Gator Bowl,
hope was renewed in the Bay Area.
college football was once again being
played at Stanford Stadium — played
very well, indeed. Coach Elway was the
toast of the Mid-Peninsula.
Sure 1987 was disappointing with the
team finishing 5-6. But the season ended
a high note with five wins in the last
seven games. With a year's experience
under their belt, the 1988 version of the
Cardinal would surely be even better.
Well ... it is, and it isn't.
It is a better football team. The defense
is superb on the line, the linebackers are
excellent and the secondary has rarely

been burned long.
The offense has been solid. Quarter
back Jason Palumbis seems to be settlihg
in nicely, the wide receivers are a deep,
talented corps. The line has been stellar.
Jon Volpe is an A-Number-One first-rate
running back.
And yet, the team's record stands at
a very ordinary 3-4-1. With games against
Washington State, UCLA and California
still left on the schedule, 5-5-1 seems
likely at season's end.
But is that an accurate reflection of
how good this team could be? Probably
not. Dream wins against USC and Wash
ington would surely have become reality
were it not for the Cardinal's ineptitude
around the goal line.
Oregon State would've been hard
pressed to manage a tie against Stanford
had the team played the first half at
anywhere near its ability.
Before the loss to Washington, the only
teams that had knocked off the Cardinal


MARK ROGOWSKY
were themselves undefeated at
the time of the contest.
And yet, with the exception of
the debacle at South Bend, Stan
ford has been in every single game
this year.
So when the gun sounds at Big
Game this year, the finger
pointing will surely begin.
Someone will be blamed for the
team's failure to live up to its
potential. "That much talent
shouldn't lose that many games."
"The palm trees, the great
weather — that's all they need to
recruit top players." "If only
they'd stopped USC or OSU on
their last drives."
Those on top are often dished
out a large helping of blame. And
atop the Cardinal is none other

than Coach Jack Elway himself.
The rumblings have probably
already begun at Buck Club din
ners and quite possibly are
making their way toward the
sidelines.

When the gun sounds
at Big Game, the
finger-pointing will
begin.

The honeymoon is long-since
over and, with stadium crowds
declining, the Athletic Depart
ment is surely getting a bit antsy
waiting for results.
Don't be surprised if the Second
Elway Era soon comes to a close.

of the years the Elways locked horns.
Thus, when Elway arrived here it was

with much fanfare. Happy days were here
again. A Rose Bowl appearance, after a
13-year hiatus, was just around the cor
ner.
Reality struck in the new coach's first
year, however. The Cardinal took to the
gridiron and came away with but five
wins.
The next year, 1985, was even worse.
Stanford would emerge victorious in only
four contests that year. Five losing sea
sons in a row.
At the time I was a freshman. The
only thing I knew about Stanford football
was the story of The Play — the great

fiasco-kickoff-return-for-touchdown of
'83 Big Game fame.
I figured it was normal for Stanford
to lose.
In 1986, I would learn just how wrong
I was.
The team broke out of the gate running
and cflptured its first four games. The
Associated Press poll placed the squad
in the promised land — the Top 20. It
seemed that nothing could stand in their
way.
Stanford split its next four games
bringing the overall tally to 6-2. A bowl
bid was there for the taking and only
one thing stood in the way — UCLA.
The Cardinal went down to Southern
California in the hopes of vanquishing
the mighty Bruins. Representatives from
seven bowl games and a near-national
television audience watched the game.
The team broke out early and led 14-0
after the first quarter. Behind the in
credible running of Brad Muster, the Car
dinal led throughout. But UCLA charged
back. In the game's waning minutes, with
Stanford clinging to a 28-23 lead, the

Bruins were driving down the field.
The Cardinal forced a fourth-and-one
with barely over two minutes left on the
clock. Matt Stevens handed off to his
star running back Gaston Green. Stan
ford strong safety Brad Humphreys met
Green at the line and knocked him for
a two-yard loss.
The victory was preserved. Stanford
was going bowling.
Despite a 27-21 defeat at the hands of
the Clemson Tigers in the Gator Bowl,
hope was renewed in the Bay Area.
college football was once again being
played at Stanford Stadium — played
very well, indeed. Coach Elway was the
toast of the Mid-Peninsula.
Sure 1987 was disappointing with the
team finishing 5-6. But the season ended
a high note with five wins in the last
seven games. With a year's experience
under their belt, the 1988 version of the
Cardinal would surely be even better.
Well ... it is, and it isn't.
It is a better football team. The defense
is superb on the line, the linebackers are
excellent and the secondary has rarely

been burned long.
The offense has been solid. Quarter
back Jason Palumbis seems to be settlihg
in nicely, the wide receivers are a deep,
talented corps. The line has been stellar.
Jon Volpe is an A-Number-One first-rate
running back.
And yet, the team's record stands at
a very ordinary 3-4-1. With games against
Washington State, UCLA and California
still left on the schedule, 5-5-1 seems
likely at season's end.
But is that an accurate reflection of
how good this team could be? Probably
not. Dream wins against USC and Wash
ington would surely have become reality
were it not for the Cardinal's ineptitude
around the goal line.
Oregon State would've been hard
pressed to manage a tie against Stanford
had the team played the first half at
anywhere near its ability.
Before the loss to Washington, the only
teams that had knocked off the Cardinal


MARK ROGOWSKY
were themselves undefeated at
the time of the contest.
And yet, with the exception of
the debacle at South Bend, Stan
ford has been in every single game
this year.
So when the gun sounds at Big
Game this year, the finger
pointing will surely begin.
Someone will be blamed for the
team's failure to live up to its
potential. "That much talent
shouldn't lose that many games."
"The palm trees, the great
weather — that's all they need to
recruit top players." "If only
they'd stopped USC or OSU on
their last drives."
Those on top are often dished
out a large helping of blame. And
atop the Cardinal is none other

than Coach Jack Elway himself.
The rumblings have probably
already begun at Buck Club din
ners and quite possibly are
making their way toward the
sidelines.

When the gun sounds
at Big Game, the
finger-pointing will
begin.

The honeymoon is long-since
over and, with stadium crowds
declining, the Athletic Depart
ment is surely getting a bit antsy
waiting for results.
Don't be surprised if the Second
Elway Era soon comes to a close.

On December 14, 1983, John A.
(Jack) Elway Sr. was named the
28th football coach in Stanford
history.
He replaced Paul Wiggin who, in four
years here, compiled a 16-28 record as
head coach of the Cardinal including a
1-10 mark in his final season.
It was time for a change. Even in the
First Elway Era, with the great John Jr.
at quarterback, the team never managed
better than a 6-5 record. There were no
bowl bids since a 1978 appearance in the
Bluebonnet Bowl. Bill Walsh was coach
back then.
Stanford found its replacement only 20
miles south of the Farm. Down at San
Jose State, the senior Elway was piloting
the Spartans. Between 1979 and 1983,
San Jose State won 35, lost 20 and tied
one under his tutelage — a .634 winning
percentage.
As a matter of fact, father Jack out
foxed the very team led by his son John.
