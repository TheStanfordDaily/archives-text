# Card sailing breezes past competition

### Hugh R. Bethell Staff writer 
By the slimmest of margins, the
Stanford sailing team captured
the Pacific Coast Sloop Champi
onship this weekend at Santa
Cruz, holding off seven of the West
Coast's best teams to qualify for
the upcoming North American In
tercollegiate Sloop Championship.
Ultimately, the regatta was
decided in the last race, when
Stanford's team of seniors Bill
Shoemaker, Brad Swett, junior
Robert Brown and sophomore
Scott Dale finished one boat
length ahead of Long Beach State
to win the elimination and one of
the seven s'.ots at the national
championship.
To qualify, Stanford had to hold
off challenges from each of the
seven teams, which were selected
at northern and southern elimina
tions a week before. At this week
end's regatta, no one team con
sistently led through the eight
race series, as several schools
made challenges for first place.

In the end, Stanford edged out
UC-San Diego by one point. Cal
ifornia and Long Beach State tied
for third, with just one more
point.
The California Maritime Acad
emy took fifth place with only
three more points than the Car
dinal squad, and la*t, year's na
tional champions, UC-Irvine,
ended up sixth just ahead of San
Diego State and Hawaii.
Though the Cardinal left the
regatta at the top of the heap,
the event was largely an uphill
battle for the foursome. Mid-fleet
finishes during the first day's
racing left the team in third place
after five races, and as in the last
elimination event, skipper
Shoemaker found his back against
the wall.
For the second week, in a row
however, the Cardinal boat
finished with a flurry as it won
Sunday's first race and edged out
Long Beach in the final event to
move into first.
For the Stanford team, these

cret of victory at the regatta was
avoiding the big mistakes that set
other teams back during the two
days of racing. The Cardinal's
worst finish was a fifth place early
on Saturday, when an equipment
failure threatened to take the
team out of the race.
As they rounded a mark to head
upwind on the last leg of that
race, the team's spinnaker sail
jammed at the top of the mast,
preventing the boat from going
on. Disaster was avoided only
when Stanford sailor Scott Dale
climbed the 30' mast in monkey
like style to cut the sail free.
It was incredible to see Scott
reach the masthead in seconds. ..
he didn t think twice," said skip
per Bill Shoemaker.
Relying on its impressive up
wind speed, the Cardinal squad
quickly climbed back into the race.
Other teams seemed to have a
hard time making similar
recoveries, and nearly every other
boat scored at least one finish at
the bottom of the fleet.
