# Dream season begins
## 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
The road to Inglewood, and
maybe beyond, begins tonight
for the Stanford men's basket
ball team with the annual
Cardinal-White scrimmage.
Of course, the Cardinal is a
long way from thinking about
the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, to be held next
March at the Forum in In
glewood, Calif. But you've got
to start somewhere, and
tonight's practice affords Stan
ford fans a free progress report
on the Pac-10 co-favorites.
The scrimmage will mark the
debut of several freshmen and

junior-college transfers, the
most heralded of which is for
ward Adam Keefe, ranked by
most national publications as
one of the nation's top-20
recruits.
Of course, the most notable
attraction on Stanford is prob
ably senior Todd Lichti. Lichti,
an All-America candidate who
was one of the last cuts for the
1988 U.S. Olympic team,
averaged 20.1 points and 5.6
rebounds per game last year in
leading Stanford to the second
round of the NIT tournament.
Lichti was chosen as the na
tion's top shooting guard by
The Sporting News.
