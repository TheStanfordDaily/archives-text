Panel to commemorate
Holocaust event
A panel discussion and screen
ing of the movie David will be
held to commemorate the 50th
anniversary of Kristallnacht at
7 p.m. Thursday, Nov. 10, in
Cubberley Auditorium.
The event, open to the public
without charge, is sponsored by
the B'nai B'rith Hillel Founda
tion at Stanford and co
sponsored by the German
Studies Department.
Kristallnacht, which means
"the night of broken glass," was

a night when Nazi-led German
mobs rampaged against German
Jewish citizens. The violence
began on the night of Nov. 9,
1938, and continued into the day
of Nov. 10. On that night, Jews
were murdered, more than 1,100
synagogues were destroyed and
thousands of Jewish businesses
and homes were robbed, van
dalized and burned.
The riots were planned by the
Nazis as a "response" to the as
sassination of a German em
bassy official in France by a
Jewish boy. Propaganda Minis
ter Joseph Goebbels organized
the Gestapo and Nazi storm
troopers to incite "spontaneous"
mob riots as a punishment for
the Jewish population.
David, which won the Golden
Bear at the Berlin Film Festival,
tells the story of a young Berlin
Jew who survived the war years
and the Holocaust.
