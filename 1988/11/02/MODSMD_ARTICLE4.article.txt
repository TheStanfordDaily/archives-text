# Insurance propositions crowd November ballot
## 
### Nathanael Cousins 
Five insurance-related initia
tives headline the crowded Cali
fornia ballot. Crammed into the
state's confusing voter pamphlet
are 29 initiatives, as well as, nu
merous national and local con
tests.
With less than a week until the
election, many voters are still un
informed and undecided about
their selections.
Insurance-related propositions
have caused much of the confu
sion. The average price of motor
vehicle insurance in California
has increased 40.1 percent in the
past two-and-a-half years, accord
ing to the League of Women
Voters. The Department of Motor
Vehicles estimates that 15 to 20
percent of California drivers are
uninsured.
Meanwhile, the trial lawyers
and insurance companies have
spent over $60 million on the in
itiative campaigns, luring voters
with a massive media blitz of slick
slogans and shady statistics.
Propositions 100, 101, 103, 104
and 106 deal with insurance. The
propositions take radically differ

ent approaches to solving the in
surance crisis.
Prop. 100, sponsored by attor
neys, would give discounts for
good driving and apply greater re
strictions on insurance compan
ies.
Props. 101 and 106, sponsored
by insurance companies, place
strict limits on lawyer contingency
fees as a way of reducing insur
ance company costs.
Prop. 103, sponsored by con
sumers, would place the insurance
industry under tight government
regulation and require lower
rates.
Prop. 104, also backed by the
insurance industry, would insti
tute a "no-fault" insurance sys
tem. California and 25 other
states use the tort system — in
which the person who is "at-fault"
in an accident pays the damage
— to determine insurance respon
sibility. No state since 1976 has
adopted the no-fault system, and
three have repealed it.
Because the initiatives are writ
ten to cancel each other out, the
one winning the most votes will
take effect even if others are
passed.
