# Viva Buenos Aires: Argentina beckons Stanford students

### Maryellen Driscoll 
Keep your fingers crossed, begin packing
your bags and continue studying Spanish
after the midterm. Buenos Aires beckons.
After several years of planning, an over
seas program in the Argentinian capital
now hinges only on the approval of a Uni
versity committee. The pilot program in
Argentina has a "very high probability of
success," according to Edmundo Fuen
zalida, academic adviser of the Overseas
Studies Center.
Pending approval from the University
Program Committe, the experimental pro
gram will moat likely run from October
1989 until March 1990. Fuenzalida said he

expects that the committee will approve
the program.
The program is intended to inaugurate
a second generation of Stanford centers
overseas, setting a precedent for hands-on
study abroad distinctly different from the
present European models.
In addition to offering the standard ac
ademic courses, the program will aim to
weave students into the fabric of the society,
monopolizing on the valuable overseas
learning that can take place outside of
classes.
"We hope to provide the students an op
portunity to learn about these new cultures
not only in the classroom, but also in
reality," Fuenzalida said.

During the first quarter students will
take courses covering the history, culture
and politics of contemporary Latin
America.
Additionally, students may pursue more
advanced study concerning issues of devel
opment common among Latin American
countries, such as education and training,
migration, health delivery and environmen
tal protection.
Participants may opt to remain for the
second quarter, during which time they
will conduct field work in various locations
throughout Latin America. The goal of the
projects will be to somehow "benefit"
whichever society the student works in,
Fuenzalida said.

Students might participate in intern
ships, research, public service or a combi
nation of tasks under the guidance of a
faculty member. The field work will extend
outside of Argentina into other Latin Amer
ican countries such as Chile, Uruguay and
Brazil.
The new approach is "theory and practice
put together," according to Fuenzalida.
Faculty for the Buenos Aires center will
be chosen among teachers from Argentina
and possibly other Latin American coun
tries, Fuenzalida said. Stanford faculty may
also participate.
