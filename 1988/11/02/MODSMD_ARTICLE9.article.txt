# Geiger enacts plan to solve deGuerre crowding
## 
### John Wagner Staff writer 
A month-long quest led by ASSU
Senator Dana Klapper to make
deGuerre Pool "less of a zoo" during
open-lap swim hours has proven fruitful.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger ap
proved a plan yesterday morning that
will:
• Open deGuerre to lap swimmers an
additional 15 hours per week,
• Educate swimmers about safer lap
swimming, and
• Encourage lifeguards to monitor the
lap swimmers more closely.
The plan will be implemented on Mon
day and will be in effect through the
end of the school year on an "experi
mental" basis, according to Asst. Ath
letic Director Shirley Schoof.
The new hours for lap swimming will
be from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5:30 p.m.

to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday. Cur
rently, the weekday hours are from noon
to 2 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m.
The pool's hours for family swimming
will remain the same: Saturday and
Sunday from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.
During the first few weeks of the
school year, Klapper said, many students
voiced concerns to her about deGuerre's
limited availability and hazardous
swimming conditions.
"Things were getting so over
crowded," Klapper said, "that people
were getting hurt." She said she hopes
that swimmers will "spread out" over
the added time periods.
Klapper, along with David Brown and
Miquel Marquez of the Council of Presi
dents, met with Geiger on Oct. 21. Ac
cording to Brown, Klapper had drafted
a set of "concrete proposals," to which
Geiger was unexpectedly receptive. "It
wasn't the kind of meeting I'm used

to," Brown said.
The plan was then referred to Schoof,
who was responsible for the details of
implementation. Geiger gave final ap
proval to the plan yesterday.
The addition of morning hours is pos
sible because pool cleaning will be
moved to a time slot previously reserved
for the men's and women's swim teams.
The cleanings, which had taken place
between 10 a.m. and noon, will now be
done Tuesday and Thursday from 7 a.m.
to 9 a.m. Earlier this year the swim
teams eliminated their Tuesday and
Thursday morning workouts.
According to Schoof, the additional
lap-swim time carries a price tag of
about $10,000 per year, mostly to pay
lifeguards.
Schoof also noted that deGuerre will
be open from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. this
Saturday.
