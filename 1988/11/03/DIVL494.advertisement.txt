Dr. Paul MacCready
"How You Can Use
Muscle and Sunbeams
to Power Vehicles"
Dr. MacCready takes us with him
through his innovative journeys
against scientific tradition that
have led to the creation of both
human-powered and sun-driven
vehicles that defy records and alter
our concepts of transportation.
Using video footage of the
remarkable achievements of his
unique flying machines and the
solar racer, he inspires us with the
power and drama of human
creativity and imaginative vision.
