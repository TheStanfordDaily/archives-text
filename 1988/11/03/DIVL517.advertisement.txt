Who Do You Call
When You Want To
Identify A Soccer
Ball At22,3ooMiles
In Space?
A company called "TRW" Here's the story.
The U.S. Air Force asked us to build a ground based
electro optical deep space surveillance system that
could identify an object the size of a soccer ball at
22,300 miles in space. We did it, utilizing 3 telescopes
and a large 4 computer system. Then they asked us to
build four more system sites. Quite an achievement,
but it's just one example of TRW's impact on the future.
TRW offers you the freedom to move among a wide
variety of opportunities in microelectronics, high
energy lasers, large software systems, communica
tions, and scientific spacecraft. If you're majoring in
engineering, computer science, math, or physics, and
want to be with a company that's driving technology
into the next century, it's not too soon to talk. Tomor
row is taking shape at a company called TRW.
If you are unable to see us on campus, please send
