Making magic
Daily editors are not wizards, but they try.
They arc emerging from the dark depths of their offices to
get in better touch with the Stanford community. They want
to know what you like, what you loathe and how the paper
could better cover the University. They'll come to dorm meetings
and will hold workshops on what college journalism is all about.
All they need is a simple invitation! Give them a call at 725-2100
and ask for Kathy.
