# Duke crushes Bush in mock vote
## Half of students take part as Eshoo tops Prof. Campbell for Congress 
### Elaine Riggs Staff writer 
Stanford students handed
Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis a landslide vic
tory over Republican candidate
George Bush in the campus-wide
mock election conducted by the
American Studies House Tuesday.
Only 28.1 percent of the 2,677
Stanford undergraduates who
participated voted for Bush,
giving Dukakis a 69.2 percent
majority.
The mock election statistics
show that Stanford undergradu
ates are predominantly moderate
to-liberal.
Over 52 percent of the student
voters said they are affiliated with
the Democratic Party, while 25
percent said they are affiliated
with the Republican Party.
American Studies house resi
dents, who organized Project Elec
tion, compiled the results late
Tuesday night and released the
figures yesterday.
In the California race for Amer
ican Senator, Democratic Lt.
Governor Leo McCarthy gained
60 percent of the vote while in
cumbent Republican senator Pete

Wilson received 36.4 percent.
Democrats also scored a
decisive victory in the campus
contest between 12th congres
sional district candidates Demo
crat Anna Eshoo and Republican
Tom Campbell. Eshoo took 61.4
percent of the votes while Camp
bell took 36.3 percent.
Election workers divided the
groups of houses into "states,"
forming an electoral college with
538 total electoral votes, imitating
the established U.S. system.
Bush won only in the "frater
nity state," which was composed
of the housed fraternities.
The fraternity breakdown
showed Bush winning at the Beta
Theta Phi, Delta Tau Delta,
Kappa Sigma, Sigma Alpha Ep
silon and Theta Delta Chi houses.
However, Dukakis won in the
Alpha Delta Phi, Delta Kappa Ep
silon, Kappa Alpha, Theta Xi and
Sigma Chi houses.
The one person who voted from
the Phi Delta Theta house chose
Independent candidate Lenora B.
Fulani.
Bush won most decisively at the
Delta Tau Delta House, with 18
votes compared to 1 for Dukakis.
Dukakis won unanimously at the

Phi Psi House with 15 votes.
Bush tied Dukakis in Eucalypto
House in Lagunita Court, where
each candidate received 15 votes.
Overall, Dukakis won 499.5
electoral votes and Bush won 38.5
electoral votes. On election day,
the presidential candidate will
need 272 electoral votes to win
the race.
"I would bet a lot of money
that this isn't going to be the

situation on Tuesday," said Amer
ican Studies Resident Assistant
Chris Chamberlain, who added,
"Stanford students may be a little
out of the mainstream."
American Studies Theme Asso
ciate Aaron Tsai attributed the
large rncgority of Dukakis sup
porters to better on-campus or
ganization by the Democrats than
by the Republicans.
"The (Stanford) Democrats
have invested more time and
money in their campaign on
campus," Tsai said.
"We are absolutely thrilled,"
about the Eshoo-Campbell vote,
said Subodh Chandra, co-chair of
the Stanford Democrats.
Chandra added, "This is Camp
bell's turf." Campbell is a profes
sor of law here.
Chandra said the mock vote in
the congressional race is particu
larly significant because Stanford
students can make the difference
in the congressional race on Tues
day.
There was no comment last
night from the Tom Campbell
Election Headquarters on the
vote.
In identifying their views in a
range from very conservative to
very liberal, 74 percent identified
themselves as moderate or liberal
(See graphics for breakdown).
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody said the predominance of
liberal attitudes here is "true in
general of the students at the

more prestigious universities, as
studies showed during the Viet
nam War."
"The ideology of students today
hasn't changed fundamentally
since the days of the Vietnam
War," said Brody, who is currently
teaching "Voting in America"
here.
Students voted by decisive mar
gins on the propositions 99, 102,
103 and 104 listed on the ballot.
Students passed Propositions
99, the Cigarette and Tobacco Tax
Initiative, and 103, the Insurance
Rates Regulation and Commis
sion Initiative, with "yes" votes
of 88 percent and 70 percent
respectively.
Propositions 102, the Reporting
Exposure to AIDS Virus Initia
tive, and 104, the Automobile In
surance Initiative, lost with "no"
votes of 77 percent and 59 percent
respectively.
The ballot also included a ques
tion on students' positions regard
ing the negotiations between the
United Stanford Workers and the
University.
In the contract negotiations be
tween the USW and the Univer
sity, 25.5 percent of the students
favored the position of the USW.
Only 8.5 percent supported the
University, leaving 12 percent who

were undecided and over 53 per
cent who said they were not well
enough informed to take a posi
tion on this issue.
As part of Project Election's de
mographic breakdown, students
were asked whether they consid
ered themselves "techies" or
"fuzzies."
Forty-two percent of the stu
dents identified themselves as
"techies," while 57.9 percent
called themselves "fuzzies."
According to Brody, voter turn
out was slightly lower than the
typical nationwide turnout on
Election Day, with 44 percent of
the student population turning in
ballots.
Election workers were "pretty
happy" with the on-campus turn
out of 48.2 percent of the students,
according to Chamberlain.
Brody said the students' 44 per
cent turnout is high compared to
the nationwide turnout projected
for this 18-22 age group.
While Dukakis is lagging in the
national polls, this is not the first
time Stanford students have voted
for the underdog.
In 1932, Stanford students
chose Herbert Hoover in the mock
election held shortly before
Franklin Roosevelt won nation
wide.

sional district candidates Demo
crat Anna Eshoo and Republican
Tom Campbell. Eshoo took 61.4
percent of the votes while Camp
bell took 36.3 percent.
Election workers divided the
groups of houses into "states,"
forming an electoral college with
538 total electoral votes, imitating
the established U.S. system.
Bush won only in the "frater
nity state," which was composed
of the housed fraternities.
The fraternity breakdown
showed Bush winning at the Beta
Theta Phi, Delta Tau Delta,
Kappa Sigma, Sigma Alpha Ep
silon and Theta Delta Chi houses.
However, Dukakis won in the
Alpha Delta Phi, Delta Kappa Ep
silon, Kappa Alpha, Theta Xi and
Sigma Chi houses.
The one person who voted from
the Phi Delta Theta house chose
Independent candidate Lenora B.
Fulani.
Bush won most decisively at the
Delta Tau Delta House, with 18
votes compared to 1 for Dukakis.
Dukakis won unanimously at the

Phi Psi House with 15 votes.
Bush tied Dukakis in Eucalypto
House in Lagunita Court, where
each candidate received 15 votes.
Overall, Dukakis won 499.5
electoral votes and Bush won 38.5
electoral votes. On election day,
the presidential candidate will
need 272 electoral votes to win
the race.
"I would bet a lot of money
that this isn't going to be the

situation on Tuesday," said Amer
ican Studies Resident Assistant
Chris Chamberlain, who added,
"Stanford students may be a little
out of the mainstream."
American Studies Theme Asso
ciate Aaron Tsai attributed the
large rncgority of Dukakis sup
porters to better on-campus or
ganization by the Democrats than
by the Republicans.
"The (Stanford) Democrats
have invested more time and
money in their campaign on
campus," Tsai said.
"We are absolutely thrilled,"
about the Eshoo-Campbell vote,
said Subodh Chandra, co-chair of
the Stanford Democrats.
Chandra added, "This is Camp
bell's turf." Campbell is a profes
sor of law here.
Chandra said the mock vote in
the congressional race is particu
larly significant because Stanford
students can make the difference
in the congressional race on Tues
day.
There was no comment last
night from the Tom Campbell
Election Headquarters on the
vote.
In identifying their views in a
range from very conservative to
very liberal, 74 percent identified
themselves as moderate or liberal
(See graphics for breakdown).
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody said the predominance of
liberal attitudes here is "true in
general of the students at the

more prestigious universities, as
studies showed during the Viet
nam War."
"The ideology of students today
hasn't changed fundamentally
since the days of the Vietnam
War," said Brody, who is currently
teaching "Voting in America"
here.
Students voted by decisive mar
gins on the propositions 99, 102,
103 and 104 listed on the ballot.
Students passed Propositions
99, the Cigarette and Tobacco Tax
Initiative, and 103, the Insurance
Rates Regulation and Commis
sion Initiative, with "yes" votes
of 88 percent and 70 percent
respectively.
Propositions 102, the Reporting
Exposure to AIDS Virus Initia
tive, and 104, the Automobile In
surance Initiative, lost with "no"
votes of 77 percent and 59 percent
respectively.
The ballot also included a ques
tion on students' positions regard
ing the negotiations between the
United Stanford Workers and the
University.
In the contract negotiations be
tween the USW and the Univer
sity, 25.5 percent of the students
favored the position of the USW.
Only 8.5 percent supported the
University, leaving 12 percent who

were undecided and over 53 per
cent who said they were not well
enough informed to take a posi
tion on this issue.
As part of Project Election's de
mographic breakdown, students
were asked whether they consid
ered themselves "techies" or
"fuzzies."
Forty-two percent of the stu
dents identified themselves as
"techies," while 57.9 percent
called themselves "fuzzies."
According to Brody, voter turn
out was slightly lower than the
typical nationwide turnout on
Election Day, with 44 percent of
the student population turning in
ballots.
Election workers were "pretty
happy" with the on-campus turn
out of 48.2 percent of the students,
according to Chamberlain.
Brody said the students' 44 per
cent turnout is high compared to
the nationwide turnout projected
for this 18-22 age group.
While Dukakis is lagging in the
national polls, this is not the first
time Stanford students have voted
for the underdog.
In 1932, Stanford students
chose Herbert Hoover in the mock
election held shortly before
Franklin Roosevelt won nation
wide.
Stanford students handed
Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis a landslide vic
tory over Republican candidate
George Bush in the campus-wide
mock election conducted by the
American Studies House Tuesday.
Only 28.1 percent of the 2,677
Stanford undergraduates who
participated voted for Bush,
giving Dukakis a 69.2 percent
majority.
The mock election statistics
show that Stanford undergradu
ates are predominantly moderate
to-liberal.
Over 52 percent of the student
voters said they are affiliated with
the Democratic Party, while 25
percent said they are affiliated
with the Republican Party.
American Studies house resi
dents, who organized Project Elec
tion, compiled the results late
Tuesday night and released the
figures yesterday.
In the California race for Amer
ican Senator, Democratic Lt.
Governor Leo McCarthy gained
60 percent of the vote while in
cumbent Republican senator Pete

Wilson received 36.4 percent.
Democrats also scored a
decisive victory in the campus
