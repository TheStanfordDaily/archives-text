## Israeli elections still up in the air Orthodox parties demand a high price for their support 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Four religious parties
— potential king-makers after Israel's incon
clusive elections — are demanding a high
price for their support: no soccer or movies
on the Sabbath and control over conversions
to Judaism.
Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox parties scored
a stunning surprise by amassing 18 seats
Tuesday in the 120-member parliament, an
increase of four seats from 1984.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing
Likud bloc and Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres' left-leaning Labor Party finished in
virtual deadlock. They want to end their joint
rule but neither can form a government with
out at least some religious support.
Religious parties sought Cabinet posts such
as the ministries of religion, education and
housing. They also demanded public enter
tainment be outlawed on the biblically man
dated day of rest.
Avraham Shapira of the Agudat Israel party,
which won five seats, said that on the Sabbath,
theaters should be shut and soccer games
rescheduled.
"I am sure, the Lord willing, that on the
Sabbath movie houses will be closed," he said.
"Non-religious Jews have televisions at home.
They can watch TV."
Secular leaders warned the rise of Jewish
fundamentalism could foreshadow a new era
of bans on freedom of action similar to those
imposed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's

Islamic revolution in Iran.
"If we all get religious, who will sit in the
ships and the tanks when the right-wing mes
sianic composition that we witness brings war
upon us," Shulamit Aloni, leader of the liberal,
anti-religious Citizens Rights Movement, said
on Israel radio.
Religious party leaders have said their major
goal is stopping what they see as a moral
decline but refraining from coercion.
"I want to tell the general public that we
have no intentions to impose," said Avner
Shaki, leader of the National Religious Party,
which won five seats.
"We only want to give the Jewish public a
clearly Jewish character, which is required by
. . . the fact that Israel is a Jewish state," he
said.
Heading the Orthodox agenda is a demand
to revise Israel's Law of Return, which grants
automatic citizenship to all Jews. Religious
parties want the state to recognize as Jewish
only those born to a Jewish mother or con
verted by an Orthodox rabbi.
Changing the law would alienate American
Jews. Interfaith marriages are on the rise in
the United States where the majority of the
5 million Jews belong to Reform or Conser
vative movements.
Religious parties seek to toughen laws
against abortion, Christian missionary activ
ites, the performing of autopsies and ar
chaeological digs near cemeteries.

Chaim Bergman, news editor of Agudat Is
rael's daily newspaper Hamoudia, said ultra-
Orthodox Jews were divided on the lengths
to which Israel could go in trading territory
for peace with the Arabs as proposed by Labor.
"We are more or less with the line of Likud
on the need for autonomy for Palestinans,"
said Bergman. "You can say we are opposed
to giving back territory, but not at any price."
Only the National Religious Party has given
a high priority to the issue, arguing that Israel
must keep the West Bank and Gaza Strip
seized in the 1967 war.
Labor is most ardently courting Shas, which
won six seats and is committed to preserving
the traditions of Sephardic Jews from Islamic
countries. Allied with Shas is the Torah Flag
party which won two seats and is a breakway
from Agudat Israel.
Shas spokesman Moshe Peretz said "we
have a stronger affinity to the right, although
we don't reject categorically that we will find
a way with Labor."
Shmuel Sandler, a social scientist from the
religious Bar Ilan University near Tel Aviv,
said religious groups which had remained aloof
from politics in the past launched a well
organized campaign.
"It came as a complete surprise. Nobody
expected it,"he said, adding the religious par
ties apparently foresaw Israel was deeply split
and they could control the balance of power.
