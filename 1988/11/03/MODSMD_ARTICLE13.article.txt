CHICAGO (AP) — Democrat Michael
Dukakis slammed Republicans George
Bush and Dan Quayle as sorry candi
dates to lead a war against drugs, and
warned drug-producing countries that
"if you're against us, don't expect a
dime of American foreign aid."
Unleashing some of his harshest cam
paign rhetoric yet, Dukakis criticized
the vice president for saying Tuesday
he would not necessarily halt aid to
nations that refuse to cooperate with
U.S. anti-drug efforts.
"Mike Dukakis will, you can depend
on that," the Democratic presidential
nominee told about 10,000 people at a
rally in Chicago's Daley Plaza.
"That's an important difference in
this election and will make a very im
portant difference in the lives of our
children and grandchildren," he said.
Dukakis drew thunderous applause
when he declared:

"I'll work with other countries but
I'll be damned if I will allow those coun
tries to send their poison into the United
States of America. Maybe (Bush) thinks
there are other things more important
than the future of our children. ... I
say you have to draw the line some
where."
Chicago was the second stop on a
three-state campaign tour yesterday
that began in Minneapolis, where Du
kakis' wife, Kitty, is hospitalized.
Dukakis repeated the anti-drug mes
sage in Pittsburgh, where he addressed
a rally of several thousand people. He
mocked Bush for wanting to be a "tough
guy" but failing to back up his words
with actions.
"You have to draw the line some
where, and I draw that line at the lives
of our children," Dukakis said, again
criticizing Bush's statement Tuesday.
Showing signs of fatigue, Dukakis

mistakenly referred to former Interior
Secretary James Watt as a former sec
retary of state.
The day was ending with a get-out
the-vote rally in Philadelphia with the
Rev. Jesse Jackson.
During the primary campaign, Duka
kis said he would refuse to give foreign
aid to any country involved in producing
or trafficking in illict drugs unless they
cooperated fully with the U.S. campaign
to stamp out the drug trade.
The same policy is reflected in federal
law, but Dukakis and congressional
Democrats have criticized President
Reagan for certifying Panama and other
suspect countries as eligible for foreign
aid.
Dukakis said he would offer money,
protection and even U.S. military assis
tance to countries that request help in
the drug war.
