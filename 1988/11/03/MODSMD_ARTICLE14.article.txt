# Heiress posts bail for Marcos
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - Imelda
Marcos's quest for a benefactor
ended yesterday when tobacco
heiress Doris Duke agreed to put
up the $5 million needed by the
former first lady of the Philip
pines to secure her bail on rack
eteering charges.
Duke will post more than $5
million in municipal bonds as bail
for Marcos, who is accused along
with her husband, former Philip
pine president Ferdinand Marcos,
of looting more than $100 million
from their homeland.
Although Marcos would be free
to return to Hawaii as soon as
the paperwork was completed, an
other lawyer said she would
remain on the East Coast for the
weekend to visit Duke.
Lawyers said the bonds would
actually be worth between $5.3
million and $5.4 million depend
ing on market fluctuation, al
though the exact types of bonds
were not revealed.
"It was Miss Duke's idea to
help," her lawyer, Donald Robin
son, said after a hearing before
U.S. District Judge John Keenan
in Manhattan.

"Like President Reagan, Miss
Duke regrets the indictment," the
lawyer said, referring to the pres
ident's comment after the Mar
coses' racketeering indictment
was announced last month.
Marcos, 59, who has been
staying in an $1,800-a-day suite
at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, did
not attend the court session.
"Mrs. Marcos is extremely
grateful and was tearful when she
learned of the offer," said Robin
son.
The 75-year-old Duke, Robin
son said, is "happy to help a
friend. She believes she (Marcos)
is innocent because she knows
that Mrs. Marcos didn't commit
any crimes."
Marcos flew to New York from
the couple's home-in-exile in
Honolulu aboard Duke's lavishly
appointed private jet.
Marcos "will be allowed to
return to Hawaii as soon as every
thing is in place," said Assistant
U.S. Attorney Charles Laßella.
Prosecutors said the bail docu
ments would have to be signed by
Duke, Marcos and a clerk of the
court as well as Keenan.

Robinson said Duke would sign
over the bonds at her 2,700-acre
New Jersey estate "immediately,
if the government wants it."
But Marcos attorney John
Tigue said Marcos wouldn't
return to Hawaii before the week
end.
The judge loosened travel re
strictions for Marcos, allowing her
to go as far as Rhode Island, where
Duke maintains one of her homes.
"She plans to vist with Duke
this weekend in New Jersey and
perhaps in Newport," Tigue said.
"She then will return to her ailing
husband."
Once the bail documents are
signed, Marcos will be allowed to
travel anywhere in the United
States. Her husband, however,
cannot leave the island of Oahu
without permission of the Justice
Department, under a prior restric
tion.
Marcos last saw Duke in 1987,
and the heiress also was host of
a dinner for the Marcoses in
Hawaii in 1980 and saw them
again there in 1982, Marcos aide
Arturo Aruiza said in Honolulu.
