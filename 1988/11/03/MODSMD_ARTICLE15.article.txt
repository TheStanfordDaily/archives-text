New shuttle moved to launch pad
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) - Space
Shuttle Atlantis was moved to the launch pad
yesterday for a flight late this month in which
the crew will deploy a Pentagon intelligence
gathering satellite and try to determine man's
role as a military observer in orbit.
Perched vertically atop a huge transporter with
a tank-like tread, Atlantis headed out of an as
sembly building into the darkness shortly after
1 a.m., completing the snail's-pace, four-mile trip
seven hours later at Launch Pad 398.
The move, befitting the classified nature of
the mission, was made without the floodlights,
music, speeches and cheers of thousands of
workers who showed up when Discovery rolled
to the pad July 4 for the first shuttle mission
since the 1986 Challenger explosion that killed
seven astronauts.
Discovery returned Americans to space Sept.
29 and successfully completed its mission four
days later.
Conrad Nagel, Atlantis' processing director,
said NASA was aiming for a launch Nov. 28 or
29.
Nagel's team began readying Atlantis in March
1987 for its third journey into space, making
more than 200 modifications to improve the
spacecraft's safety and performance.

The astronauts will deploy a satellite, believed
to carry instruments to intercept electronic sig
nals and verify arms control agreements, and
conduct other experiments of a military nature.
Ditka hospitalized for chest pains
LAKE FOREST, 111. (AD - Chicago Bears
coach Mike Ditka was hospitalized in serious
condition with chest pains today after his morn
ing workout at the National Football League
team's training camp today, officials said.
Ditka, 49, was in the intensive care unit of
Lake Forest Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman
Nancy Herman.
Bears spokesman Bryan Harlan said Ditka suf
fered the chest pains after his daily exercise
routine.
He was getting dressed for an appearance at
a rally for George Bush in nearby Prairie View
and was taken to the hospital by private vehicle,
said Harlan.
"He was conscious, but we don't know much
else about the situation yet," said Harlan.
Known for his fiery temperament as a player
and coach, Ditka has spent 27 years in pro football
and was accorded the game's highest honor by
being inducted into the NFI Hall of Fame earlier
this year.
