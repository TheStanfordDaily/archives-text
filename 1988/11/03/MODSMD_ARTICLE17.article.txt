# Diplomats can't solve radar dispute
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S.
and Soviet negotiators failed yes
terday to settle their dispute over
a Siberian radar facility, and the
Reagan administration warned it
may take steps to unravel the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
After Soviet experts outlined
their views at a meeting in
Geneva, the State Department
demanded that the installation at
Krasnoyarsk be dismantled and
its equipment destroyed.
"Unfortunately, the Soviet ex
perts did not have any new pro
posal," department spokesman
Charles Redman said in giving an
account of the session.
In two reports to Congress, the
administration charged the

Soviets with violating the ABM
treaty by constructing a radar fa
cility that could be used to organ
ize a national defense against mis
sile attack.
The theory behind the treaty
is that if both sides were unable
to mount a defense they would
hesitate to launch an attack.
Otherwise, their territory and
populations would be open to
devastating retaliation.
The Geneva session was held
at the Soviets' request and indi
cated a settlement might be pos
sible. Viktor Karpov, the foreign
ministry's senior arms control
specialist, had said in July that
the Soviets would dismantle the
Krasnoyarsk radar if the two sides

resolved their differences over the
1972 treaty.
"We had hoped they were
prepared to meet U.S. concerns
about the radar," Redman told
reporters. "... We listened to
what they had to say. Unfortu
nately, the Soviet experts did not
have any new proposals."
As a result, the spokesman said,
the United States reserved its
right under international law "to
take appropriate and propor
tionate responses" to the Soviet
violation. "We have not foreclosed
the option of declaring that viola
tion a material breach," he said.
"The Krasnoyarsk radar is a
violation of the ABM treaty," Red
man said.
