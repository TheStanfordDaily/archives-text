## Time to take a stand 
### 
Mandate for Change
deserves a more direct
presidential response

UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT
Donald Kennedy should re
spond more vigorously to
the nine demands nailed to his
door by members of the Students
of Color Coalition.
On Oct. 27, Kennedy issued a
brief statement in response to the
demands. He said a number of pro
posals have developed in the wake
of the Ujamaa incidents. He added
that some of those proposals are
under active consideration and
that others are ongoing subjects
for consideration by the University
Committee on Minority Issues.
He also said that some of the
proposals are new and will be ap
proached through proper channels.
Kennedy concluded his state
ment by saying that examination
and improvement of the multicul
tural environment of Stanford "is
better achieved through the timely,
active involvement of appropriate
groups than by a hasty, unilateral
response to varied sets of de
mands."
This response is not enough.
Kennedy is sidestepping the issue
and failing to fulfill his role as
president of this university.
If Kennedy is truly committed
to trying to shape Stanford into a

model multicultural community,
the time has come for him to take
a stand on race issues on campus.
The Students of Color Coalition
devised a set of specific and well
defined demands, none of which
should take Kennedy by surprise.
Many of them have been on the
agenda of campus minority groups
for at least two years.
If Kennedy considers a swift,
direct response to be "hasty," it is
a sign that he has not been paying
attention to minority concerns on
this campus for the past two years.
Many of the coalition's proposals
have already been going through
proper channels for years. If Ken
nedy does not act soon, they could
be stuck in the University's bu
reaucracy for many more years to
come.
After all, it is not as if these
demands are radical. On the con
trary, many of the proposals have
already been instituted at other
universities across the country.
Whether or not Kennedy agrees
with the Mandate for Change, he
should at least address the items
specifically so students know
where the University stands. If he
does in fact agree with them, then
he should advocate them.
"Bigotry is out" sticks in the
mind, but it does not educate.
Kennedy needs to adopt a vision
of Stanford as a working multicul
tural community, and then he
needs to actively lead us there.
