# Most support University stance on racism
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
The results from Tuesday's
campus-wide mock election
suggest that most students
think the University is ade
quately addressing racism.
The poll showed, however,
that minority students do not
agree with the mcyority.
The election ballot asked stu
dents to rate the University's
policies on racism on a seven
point scale with "1" signifying
"not doing enough" and "7"

meaning "doing too much."
The overall mean of the
2,000 students responding to
the racism question was 3.67,
with nearly half of the students
answering either "3" or "4" on
the scale.
However, the mean does not
show that two-thirds of black
students responded with a "1"
or "2" and that no Native
American student judged the
University's performance to be
better than "neutral."
