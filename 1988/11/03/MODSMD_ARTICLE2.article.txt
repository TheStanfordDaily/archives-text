# Most support University stance on racism
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
The results from Tuesday's
campus-wide mock election
suggest that most students
think the University is ade
quately addressing racism.
The poll showed, however,
that minority students do not
agree with the mcyority.
The election ballot asked stu
dents to rate the University's
policies on racism on a seven
point scale with "1" signifying
"not doing enough" and "7"

meaning "doing too much."
The overall mean of the
2,000 students responding to
the racism question was 3.67,
with nearly half of the students
answering either "3" or "4" on
the scale.
However, the mean does not
show that two-thirds of black
students responded with a "1"
or "2" and that no Native
American student judged the
University's performance to be
better than "neutral."
The mean among black students
was 2.27, while the mean among
Native Americans was 1.96.
Twenty-five Native American stu
dents responded to the survey.
Among Asian American stu
dents, the mean was 3.34. Among
Chicano-Latino students, the
average was 3.43.
Steve Etsitty, a member of the
Stanford American Indian Organ
ization, said, "On a scale of'noth
ing' to 'a great job,' the University
is doing next to nothing."
Black Student Union Chair
Mary Dillard said she was "glad
[that] everyone didn't say the
University was doing too much"
and that some students do take
the problem of racism seriously.
Referring to the list of nine de
mands nailed to University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy's door last
week, Dillard said, "We wouldn't
have issued a mandate if we didn't
think a lot more work needs to
be done."
In the "Rally Against Racism"
last Wednesday, the BSU gave
Kennedy a mandate calling for an
ethnic studies requirement for

graduation and a behavior code
making acts of racism a violation
of the fundamental standard. The
mandate, called "The Mandate for
Change," also asked that the
Board of Trustees include four
representatives from minority
student groups.
Etsitty said many members of
the American Indian organization
are "sick and tired of having to
take the initiative" toward devel
oping a better ethnic studies cur
riculum, a task the University
should take upon itself.
MEChA co-Chair Gina Hernan
dez said the University not only
needs to develop a better ethnic
studies program but also should
improve the condition of the eth
nic community centers.
Hernandez said the offices of
MEChA, a Chicano-Latino stu
dent group, have stained carpets
and broken windows that have
long needed repair.
MEChA is working to gain more
support through programs that
promote a better understanding
of Chicano culture, Hernandez
said.
Asian American Student Asso
ciation Chair Brian Kim said that
while some students may be "sick
and tired" of ethnic programming,
minority students have to deal

University's
stance on
racism
To what degree do you believe
the University Is addressing the
problems of racism?
Not enough 1 .... 7.4%
2 .... 17.4%

Neutral 4 !!" 22.0%
5 .... 15.0%
6 .... 8.5%
Too much 7 .... 5.6%

with pressures that other students
can't understand.
"Sometimes, the only solace [a
minority student] can get is being
in an environment where such
pressures don't exist," Kim said.
He added that students of color
should not "compromise [their]
ideals" just to gain popular sup
port.
"People think that our making
demands is complaining," Kim
said. "The assumption, however,
is that we are of equal status."
The minority community is not
of equal status and is thus fight
ing for "equal rights as human
beings," Kim said.
