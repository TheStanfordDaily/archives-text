Good outweighed the bad in new union contract

I AM WRITING this because I feel
The Daily has twice, unintentional
ly, overstated our "delight" with
the new United Stanford Workers
contract.
As we told USW members at the
large contract meeting on Oct. 31,
there is good and bad in the new
contract, but the USW team felt the
good outweighed the bad, and unani
mously recommended ratification.
I was misquoted as saying that the
members "unanimously" agreed with

this assessment. In fact, only 93 per
cent of the members ratified the con
tract.
What I did say is that this was the
first time in Stanford history that the
team so unanimously recommended a
contract.
For example, in 1985, we on the
negotiating team refused to recommend
the proposed contract because of
serious "take-aways" (a removal of
rights and protections from workers
that they have had under previous
contracts).

This was the first time in
Stanford's history that the
team so unanimously
recommended a contract.

This year we fought and won a hard
battle against meyor take-aways that
would have seriously undermined our
union security, union representation

and job security. We partly reversed a
couple of take-aways from previous
contracts, won a small improvement in
benefits and won a decent pay raise.
We owe this to the strength and
intelligence of USW workers and to the
community who supported us, espe
cially the student leaders who protected
student interests during negotiations
and who helped us prevent a strike by
winning a contract we in USW can live
with.
