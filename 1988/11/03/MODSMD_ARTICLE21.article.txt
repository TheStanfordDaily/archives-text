# Operation Rescue urges alternatives
## 
### 
In The Daily's Oct. 31 article on the
Sunnyvale abortion protest, a pro
choice advocate said that all of the
women going to the clinic rescheduled
their abortions elsewhere.
As two pro-lifers arrested during
Saturday's Operation Rescue, we refute
the validity of that statement and
know of at least four women who were
not rerouted to other clinics that day.
Rather, our sidewalk counselors talked
to these women and urged them to
consider the life-giving options provided
by pro-life agencies.
Operation Rescue is a relatively new
enthusiasm in the pro-life movement.
By peacefully but physically blockading
the entrances to abortion clinics, Oper
ation Rescuers aim to prevent not only
the killing of babies but also the ex
ploitation of women.
For the last fifteen years, ever since
the 1973 Supreme Court Roe vs. Wade
decision legalizing abortion, conven
tional political and educational efforts
have virtually failed to put a stop to
the killing. Abortion in effect has be-

come a method of birth control.
Over one in four pregnancies in
America ends in abortion. That is
equivalent to an abortion every 20
seconds of every hour of every day.
The sanctity of the life of a preborn
child has fallen to such a level that
today it is even legal for a physician,
for any reason, to abort a baby even
while the mother is in labor.
And the child is not the only victim
of abortion. While it apparently
"solves" immediate problems, abortion
actually has even more ramifications in
that it jeopardizes the dignity of
women and mothers and endangers
their physical, psychological and emo
tional well-being.
Pro-lifers, realizing the sanctity of a
preborn child's life, are obliged, in
conscience, to intervene regardless of
man's edicts. Pro-choice persons repri
mand our "law-breaking" efforts. How
ever, was it not the illegal efforts of
the underground railroad which
delivered slaves to freedom? Was it not
the illegal efforts of courageous individ
uals who at the risk of their own lives
his countless numbers from the hands
of Hitler?
We applaud the sacrifice of these
people. We consider them to be heroes

but will we apply to our own lives the
principles that guided them as we face
the holocaust of American children?
