# Friedman's bold travels commended
## 
### 
I read Professor Milton Friedman's
Oct. 27 letter about his travels with
great interest because I am a true
believer in the proverbial dictum that
extensive travels, coupled with good
formal education, can make an individ
ual an enlightened as well as a full
person.
It is simply a great pity that some
individuals would consciously deny
themselves the opportunity of making
trips to some specific countries for
ideological reasons.
Very often, I have implored my stu
dents and some of my non-traveling
colleagues to find every opportunity to
travel abroad in order to enhance their
horizons, knowledge and opportunities.
Indeed, I believe that most of such

American travelers would see the
deprived and undemocratic ways in
which others live, compare situations
and return to the United States to
appreciate their own circumstances.
Of course, any intelligent reader can
easily know in perusing Professor
Friedman's economic works that he is
a conservative economist par excellence.
Therefore, his travels to either conser
vative, fascist or communist societies
could not alter any of his established
views, but on the other score, it was
very plausible for the Nobel laureate
to have learned something new to
share with his students and colleagues.
For example, he is able to under
score comparatively that "the Chinese
Communist regime has been and still
is more repressive than the Chilean
military junta, or that there is less
chance that real democracy will emerge
in China than in Chile." To an extent,
Professor Friedman deserves com
mendation, but not condemnation, for
being bold enough to visit capitalist
and fascist Chile in 1975 and Commu
nist China in 1988.
