## It's an ideological battle 
### 
Election day is November
8; that's five days away.
Unfortunately, it was too easy
to become rather apathetic toward the
campaigns and the election this time
around: both rrngor candidates did too
much dirty politicking and not enough
answering of questions or addressing of
issues.
But now that there are only five days
left, I suddenly realize how much truly
is at stake and how emotional and
stressed I am about this election. Despite
Governor Dukakis' denials, this election
is about ideology: it is about Republican
conservativism versus Democratic liber
alism.
And I insist that conservatism finally
be pushed out while liberalism is pulled
in. Eight years is a long time for one
ideology to reign, but twelve years is even
longer. If nothing else, this country needs
a change!
As a nation, we must not accept the
status quo of relative "economic growth"
and "stable" foreign relations. We need
to challenge our government to do more:
to shelter the homeless, to feed the
hungry, to educate the illiterate, to pro
vide health care for the needy, to grant
foreign nations their own autonomy and
independence.
By electing Michael Dukakis, Ameri
cans are exclaiming that we want and
are ready for refreshingly new policies;
by electing George Bush we are settling
for a stagnant continuation of Reagan
and the past eight years.
Using the polls as a guideline, this

continuation appears to be what America
wants. I argue, however, that it is not.
Reverend Jesse Jackson ran in the
Democratic primaries on a very progres
sive platform, and he won a lot of support
and a lot of votes. His emphasis on social
welfare programs and his ideas of true
equality and opportunity for all people
inspired, and still do inspire, many
people. He played a big role at the Demo
cratic Convention in shaping the Demo
cratic platform and in illustrating that
true liberalism and progressivism can
gain wide support.
Dukakis' biggest mistake was not
embracing early enough the label of
"liberal" that Bush gave him; rather, he
downplayed it or fought it. Some insist
that he had to do this to prevent an
alienation of the conservative Democrats
who often vote Republican, and I agree
that the conservative Democratic vote is
essential.
However, there are certain "core" Dem
ocrats who will vote party line no matter
who the candidate is, and these are the
voters who set the tone and speed of the
campaign and the Party. Such voters tend
to be progressive and desirous of mtyor
social change, and Dukakis should have
reached out to excite and encourage them.
For if the base of a party is ambivalent
about its candidate, why should the more
ambivalent party members be enthusias
tic?
I understand that Dukakis did not want
to appear too extreme, for "extremism"
makes people nervous, but he should have
anticipated the strength and support he

could have gotten by recognizing and ap
plauding the more leftist elements of his
party. Those leftist, liberal elements do
exist and are gaining ground, as il
lustrated in the primaries.
The people I know who voted for Jack
son in the primaries voted for him be
cause they truly believe in his "vision"
and want to see his ideas for social change
implemented into action. Jackson didn't
win but his supporters are still voting,
and we are voting for his vision of pro
gressive change.
Dukakis is the only candidate who will
bring such change to a country that des
perately needs it. And even if he hasn't
campaigned for this change as much as
many of us would like, he still needs our
vote. The general ideology of a nation
does set its pace and its tone, and the
United States is ready for a new ideology.
A future of domestic social equality of
opportunity and international strength
through peace and fair trade must be on
the way.
This is why I am voting for Michael
Dukakis and Leo McCarthy and Anna
Eshoo: because they are liberal Demo
crats who, like me, are tired of conser
vative Republicans.
