## AIDS can be contained 
### 
FOR THE GREATER PART of the
past decade, AIDS has swept across
the entire globe, killing countless
victims from every walk of life. AIDS is
one of the most tragic diseases, as its
inevitable course is often plagued with
debilitating disfigurement as well as so
cial stigma. And yet even in its most
terrible form, I prefer it to many diseases
of the past.
How can I say this, you ask? What
disease could possibly be worse than
AIDS? My reply: Let me make a list...
tuberculosis, leprosy, plague, etc.
Get the picture? Now get the point:
What do these diseases have in common
with AIDS? a)They all can be fatal, di
rectly or indirectly. b)They all have/had
a social stigma associated with them.
c)They all were at epidemic proportions
at one time.
Now, what is the major difference be
tween AIDS and the other diseases? All
three of the other diseases were contained
even when they weren't cured. AIDS can
also be contained.
I am not a fervent homophobic calling
for the containment of homosexuals, per
haps in colonies reminiscent of the tuber
culosis colonies my own grandmother
spent seven of her childhood years in. No,
I am not asking for containment of AIDS
patients at all.
You see, the beauty of AIDS is that
its victims need not be isolated to isolate
the disease. The victims need only be
identified! In fact, as far as lethal con
tagious diseases of epidemic proportion
are concerned, AIDS is very difficult to
catch!

If an uninfected individual lived,
breathed and ate with a city full of AIDS
victims, the uninfected person would stay
uninfected unless a highly unlikely trans
fer of blood occured. We can isolate this
disease and remove it from America
within one decade without ever finding
a cure or changing the lifestyle of one
victim. It is easily within our grasp.
I am formally calling upon the U. S.
Health Department to adopt the following
policy to remove AIDS from America im
mediately: provide inexpensive or free
AIDS testing to every U.S. resident or
citizen. Have the confidential test results
printed on unique, dated, difficult-to
duplicate cards that are given to each
tested individual. Finally, embark upon
an advertisement campaign which
stresses asking for recent AIDS test
results before engaging in sexual rela
tions.
The victims' rights are maintained, as
they are not singled out or interfered
with in any way. I guarantee that AIDS
cases will drop dramatically with such a
policy. AIDS is a disease that preys on
our lack of public health policy much
more than it preys on humans.
We can lick this disease. Now. We need
only address it instead of hiding from it.
AIDS can only exist in the atmosphere
of ignorance that we have forcefully
maintained in this country.
Let us stop pretending. AIDS stopped
pretending long ago.
