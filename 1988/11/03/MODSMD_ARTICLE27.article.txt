Prop. 102 called
irresponsible policy
I was a Stanford medical student.
After two years, I left medicine to
pursue a different career. One reason I
did this involved unreasonable con
straints placed on today's doctors.
These pressures often make it impossi
ble to practice good medicine.
Doctors are faced with heavy defla
tionary pressures to cut costs, which
sometimes cuts into good patient care.
They find themselves working in
clinics where patients are herded in
and out of ten-minute time slots. And
people with little medical knowledge or
medical experience exert increasing
control over how medicine is practiced.
Does Governor Deukmejian know
more about medicine than his own
AIDS advisory board, or the 34,000
member California Medical Association?
By endorsing Proposition 102, Deuk
mejian encourages the spread of AIDS.
Prop. 102 bans anonymous testing.
Prop. 102 would allow insurance com
panies to test for HIV antibodies. Em
ployers could test their workers. Test
ing could happen without your knowl
edge or consent. People would lose
their jobs, homes and insurance.
Facing such discrimination, who would
volunteer for AIDS research?
Prop. 102 forces doctors to report
people they know or suspect to be
infected with HIV. Doctors who refuse
would face criminal charges. Suppose
you are a doctor trying to practice
medicine under Prop. 102. Suppose a
patient comes to you, worried about
AIDS. What do you say? "I'll try to be

your doctor, but be very careful what
you tell me. If I suspect you have
AIDS, I must report you to the health
department, which may result in loss
of your job, home and health insur
ance."
The conflict would tear any doctor
apart. Patients could no longer trust
their doctors. Prop 102 is at best ir
responsible, at worst deliberately mali
cious.
Perhaps I realized something only
subconsciously when I left medical
school. Deukmejian has made it clear
to me now. The easiest way to practice
medicine nowadays is to go into
politics.

Thanks given to
Stanford workers
This is a simple letter of thanks to
the Stanford workers. I am ashamed to
admit that I never fully realized just
how dependent the students of this
university are on these workers until
we were faced with an impending
strike.
These are the dedicated workers who
maintain the grounds, clean our
bathrooms, and cook our food. And
who on earth would have stayed until
9:30 p.m. to fix our overflowing
urinals?
They put up with our never-ending
complaints about the food they prepare
and with our filthy bathroom habits (I
have learned not to put Domino's pizza
boxes in the bathroom trash cans —

they hate that). To those who are now
thinking, "But we pay $18,000 a year
and deserve...," stop thinking about
money for once and focus on the
workers and who they are.
They avoided a strike and worked
without a contract for almost two
months, making life a lot easier for the
lot of us, while they themselves an
guished over whether or not their
highly reasonable demands would be
met.
Now they finally have reached an
agreement with the University and I
would like to sincerely thank those
Stanford workers, not only for their
great work at holding this university
together (for they truly are the back
bone), but also for their patience in
dealing with the University that I so
loyally stand behind, yet myself can
lose patience with at times.
Your work is so much appreciated
and shall rarely be taken for granted.
