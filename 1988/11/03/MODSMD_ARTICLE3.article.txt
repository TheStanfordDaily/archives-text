# No answers for racism
## Officials claim doubt about how to handle incidents 
### DJ Berinstein Staff writer 
Acknowledging the University's uncer
tainty in determining punishments for stu
dents involved in incidents of bigotry, Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons told stu
dents yesterday, "We just don't have all
the answers."
Residential Education officials held a
meeting at Serra Lounge to inform students
about Res Ed's judicial process.
Lyons, Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson, Dean of Residential Edu
cation Diana Conklin and Asst. Dean of
Student Affairs Alice Supton answered
questions for two hours from students as
to the efficiency of the process itself.
The University has no precedents to fol
low in cases concerning such issues as rac
ism, sexism and homophobia, Robinson
said. "It's a new area."
"The whole system needs to come to
gether to deal with racist, sexist, homopho
bic behavior," Supton said.
"We acknowledge that we are not dealing
with it effectively," Lyons said.
The University may create an entirely
new policy concerning racism, sexism and
homophobia, Robinson said.
The University officials expressed con
cern about major policy decisions that will
result from the past racial incidents.
One major question is whether the
Ujamaa House incident will produce a prec
edent for dealing with Fundamental Stand
ard violations. Recently, two racially offen
sive posters were posted at Ujamaa.
The Fundamental Standard is a two
sentence statement written in 1906 that
has been applied to a variety of situations.
The Fundamental Standard requires
"students [to] show respect for order,
morality, personal honor and the rights of
others."
The University currently has a format
to deal with violations of the Honor Code,
which is the academic application of the
Fundamental Standard. "The Honor Code
is almost sacred at Stanford [because] ac
ademics is the mission of this institution,"
Lyons said.
It is much easier for the University to

'We acknowledge that we
are not dealing with it effec
tively.'

take action when cheating occurs because
there are precedents, he added.
"But blatant Fundamental Standard vi
olations are much more difficult" to judge,
he said. "We are dealing with something
we have never dealt with before."
Robinson explained that Stanford, unlike
other universities, does not have an "offi
cial code of conduct spelled out, which
makes our job more difficult."
"But we do hold a basic premise that
the individual has a responsibility for the
rights of others," he added.
When a student behaves inappropriately
in a non-academic area, residential deans
must first decide if the act is a Fundamental
Standard violation based on past cases.
The University has declined to act on
the Otero incident after Judicial Affairs
Officer Sally Cole decided not to open the
case as a Fundamental Standard violation.
Last spring at Otero, seven students in
voked images of the Ku Klux Klan in a
night vigil protesting the eviction of a stu
dent who had made homophobic remarks
to his resident assistant.
Otero RA April House expressed her dis
appointment in the Res Ed system.
At the beginning of fall quarter, the Uni
versity distributed written statements to
all freshmen about the Fundamental Stand
ard and the differences between free speech
and harassment.
House told the University officials, "You
said you would not tolerate [discrimi
nation], so do something."
"A lot of things have been said by the
University, but nothing has been done,"
House added.
Lyons said some freshmen simply do not
know what constitutes respectful behavior.
Ujamaa RA Kim Coleman replied, "Say
ing these freshmen didn't know better is
not good enough. Individuals must take
responsibility for their actions."
