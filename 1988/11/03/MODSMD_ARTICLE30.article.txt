## Chu brothers have their research down to a science Gilbert Chu: the winding road to DNA research 
### Jock Friedly Staff writer 
Gilbert Chu, associate professor of
medicine, should have known in high school
he would make a mark on the world of
science with his knack for biology. As a
ninth grader he performed brain surgery
on rats, intrigued to repeat the experiments
he read about outside of classes.
Although his rat experiments found lim
ited success, Chu had sparked an interest
that has remained with him since, and has
grown from a knack to an expertise; he is
now a mtyor researcher in cancer studies.
Nonetheless, Chu took a circuitous route
in life to arrive at his position today as a
renowned biologist with landmark findings
recently published in the prestigous journal
"Science." (see related story, front page)
As an undergraduate at Princeton Uni
versity, Chu earned degrees in both math
and physics, graduating in 1967. He never
received formal training in biology at
Princeton, but Chu indulged his interest
and followed developments in biology out
side of his studies.
After enrolling in the Ph.D. program in

theoretical physics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Chu found prob
lems of biology continued to fascinate him.
During graduate school, Chu said he grew
increasingly excited about biology and
somewhat disillusioned with studying
physics. "Physics had its heyday in the
first part of the century," Chu said.
"Biology is just on the crest of a revo
lution in thinking. The second half of the
20th century is for the biologists," accord
ing to Chu.
After MIT, despite strong leanings
toward biology, Chu continued with physics
as a post-doctoral fellow at UC-Berkeley
in 1975. He soon began to bridge the two
disciplines. Applying his physics to
medicine, he devised a method for three
dimensional imaging.
He worked as a physicist for one year
at the Stanford Linear Accelerator before
deciding to switch careers and attend Har
vard Medical School.
Later Chu returned to Stanford in his
new capacity as a specialist in oncology.
He utilized his physics background to in
vent a greatly improved technique for sep
arating chemicals.
