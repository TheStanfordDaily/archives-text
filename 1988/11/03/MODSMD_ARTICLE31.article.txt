# Optical molasses: Steven Chu's sweet discovery

Molasses is usually an ingredient in
cookies, but not when used by Physics
Prof. Steven Chu.
Using the system he created, in
cluding "optical molasses" and an
"optical trap," Chu can capture atoms,
virtually frozen in space, and study
them with extreme precision.
The optical trap — created by one
narrowly focused laser — holds atoms
cooled to a temperature just above
absolute zero. This is done by the
forces of the lasers forming the "opti
cal molasses" or "optical goop."
"Over the last dozen years . . .
people have realized that you can ma
nipulate atoms in unprecedented
ways," Chu said. "You can push them
around, cool them and hold them in
space. The force that creates the laser
trap is 100,000 times the strength of
gravity."
When arranged in a certain pattern,

laser beams slow down atoms, thereby
cooling them. Chu compared this
decelerating function of the lasers
with the image of sticky molasses,
thus the term "optical molasses" for
the region where the laser forces act.
Us;ng lasers, Chu said he has mea
sured "the coldest vapors that have
been made so far."
Chu has cooled atoms to as low as
a few millionths of a degree above
absolute zero.
Although the technologies for the
molasses and the traps are in the
infant stages, already Chu and other
scientists are exploring possible appli
cations for them in physics, chemistry
and biology.
One promising area of research uses
the laser technology to make "optical
tweezers" scientists could use to pick
up objects as small as individual atoms
or living cells. "You can move the
nucleus about, and you can grab small
structures within a bacteria," Chu
said.

In physics, the atoms captured by
optical traps could be used to make
clocks with unprecedented accuracy,
many times more accurate than any
thing currently available. The clocks
would exploit the predictable behavior
of extremely cold atoms within the
optical trap.
"The most precise experiments in
physics are done with clocks," said
Chu. "If you're interested in discov
ering new physics, this is now a better
tool."
Until 1970, theorists and ex
perimentalists had not realized that
an optical force could be strong
enough to trap any particle, even the
tiny atom, but the idea of light ex
erting a force on objects is centuries
old.

astronomer, first suggested in 1619
