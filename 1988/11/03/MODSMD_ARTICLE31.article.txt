# Optical molasses: Steven Chu's sweet discovery
##

Molasses is usually an ingredient in
cookies, but not when used by Physics
Prof. Steven Chu.
Using the system he created, in
cluding "optical molasses" and an
"optical trap," Chu can capture atoms,
virtually frozen in space, and study
them with extreme precision.
The optical trap — created by one
narrowly focused laser — holds atoms
cooled to a temperature just above
absolute zero. This is done by the
forces of the lasers forming the "opti
cal molasses" or "optical goop."
"Over the last dozen years . . .
people have realized that you can ma
nipulate atoms in unprecedented
ways," Chu said. "You can push them
around, cool them and hold them in
space. The force that creates the laser
trap is 100,000 times the strength of
gravity."
When arranged in a certain pattern,

laser beams slow down atoms, thereby
cooling them. Chu compared this
decelerating function of the lasers
with the image of sticky molasses,
thus the term "optical molasses" for
the region where the laser forces act.
Us;ng lasers, Chu said he has mea
sured "the coldest vapors that have
been made so far."
Chu has cooled atoms to as low as
a few millionths of a degree above
absolute zero.
Although the technologies for the
molasses and the traps are in the
infant stages, already Chu and other
scientists are exploring possible appli
cations for them in physics, chemistry
and biology.
One promising area of research uses
the laser technology to make "optical
tweezers" scientists could use to pick
up objects as small as individual atoms
or living cells. "You can move the
nucleus about, and you can grab small
structures within a bacteria," Chu
said.

In physics, the atoms captured by
optical traps could be used to make
clocks with unprecedented accuracy,
many times more accurate than any
thing currently available. The clocks
would exploit the predictable behavior
of extremely cold atoms within the
optical trap.
"The most precise experiments in
physics are done with clocks," said
Chu. "If you're interested in discov
ering new physics, this is now a better
tool."
Until 1970, theorists and ex
perimentalists had not realized that
an optical force could be strong
enough to trap any particle, even the
tiny atom, but the idea of light ex
erting a force on objects is centuries
old.
Johannes Kepler, a Danish
astronomer, first suggested in 1619
that sunlight pushed a comet's tail
away from the sun. Although this phe-
nomena is aptually caused by par
ticles — not light — from the sun
hitting the comet, Kepler had hit
upon an important concept that
remained unexplained until
Einstein's 1905 description of the
photoelectric effect, which is based
on the particle nature of light.
Despite early origins, Chu and
other researchers have only re
cently developed the tools for opti
cal traps and optical molasses.
"People are just beginning to
explore where the research is

going to lead," Chu said. He noted
that "not much mental effort" was
applied to this area of study until
three or four years ago when
atoms were first cooled to the nec
essarily low temperatures re
quired for this kind of study.
"One couldn't really manipu
late them the way you can now.
Once you see that it can be done,
it frees people's imaginations and
many people are beginning to
think about it very seriously."
Chu, while working at AT&T
Bell Laboratories in 1985, dem
onstrated that an optical molasses
could be created by light fired
from six different laser beams.

Chu showed that the optical
molasses could sufficiently slow
atoms so they might be "loaded"
into the optical trap, created by
another laser focused in the
middle of the molasses.
Optical molasses relies on the
phenomena of Doppler shifts —
the change in frequency of light
observed by travelers at different
speeds.
The Doppler shift can be
visualized by thinking of light as
photons, small packets of light
that act like particles. An object
traveling towards the light Source
will pass more photons than an
object moving the opposite direc

tion.
If two lasers are fired from op
posite directions at an object, the
beam it travels towards will hit
the object with more photons,
thus giving it a slightly greater
kick in the opposite direction.
The kick that the object will
receive from the beam is always
in the direction opposing motion,
slowing it down. When the object
travels into the laser light, it will
slow down as though it were in
molasses.
Although the molasses is not
thick enough to hold tfcie objects
trapped, it serves as a tool to
"load" an optical trap. The object
caught in the molasses will be
slowed and will perform a so
called "random walk."
A random walk is commonly
explained by an anology to a
drunken sailor stumbling hap
hazardly. In the case of optical
molasses, the walk of the object
in the molasses is caused by the
absorption and random emission
of a photon.
A particle engaged in a random
walk can eventually jump out of
the molasses, but the property of
random walks also causes some
objects in the molasses to walk
into the trap.
The trap itself works on a dif
ferent principle from the
molasses. Opposite charges in the
object are separated by the chang
ing electric fields in the laser
light, migrating to the strongest
electric field.
The delicate precision of optical
tweezers could be used to manip
ulate the microstructures of the
cell, greatly enhancing the scope
of cell study.
