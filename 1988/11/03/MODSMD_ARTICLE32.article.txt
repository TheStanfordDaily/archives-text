## Springing the laser trap

Physicists frequently build big
ger and bigger machines to stay
at the cutting edge of their sci
ence. Note the two-mile-long par
ticle accelerator nearby.
Despite this trend, Physics Prof.
Steven Chu has confined his
landmark research to one room
and employs the help of only a
few graduate students.
With this, Chu's research has
culminated in his innovations
called "optical molasses" and
"optical traps," complex tools that
will aid many researchers in phys
ics, chemistry and biology.
Chu has cooled atoms to the
lowest temperatures ever
achieved, and he predicts that the
temperatures could go even lower.
Chu's research has tremendous
potential for being a tool for
physicists in studying the proc
esses of the atom.(see related

After graduating from the Uni
versity of Rochester with under
graduate degrees in both math
and physics, Chu went to the UC-
Berkeley to be a physics theorist.
But Chu was not satisfied. He
"would sneak into the lab" to do
experiments on his own. "I was
having a little too much fun in
the lab," said Chu.
Since tinkering in the lab in
trigued him, Chu jumped from
theory into experimental physics.
He soon demonstrated an impor

tant prediction from a theory
known in physics as the "electro
weak unification theory."
Since this discovery, Chu has
remained a leader in the labora
tory, making his way to the top
of the Quantum Electronics Re
search Department at AT&T's
Bell Laboratories.
"I'm basically an experimen
talist," Chu said. "I don't pretend
to be in theory, but if we happen
to understand what we see —
that's fine."
At Bell Labs, Chu started the
research that soon launched him
to the forefront of atomic research
involving cooling and trapping
particles.
His groundbreaking research
studying optical traps has at
tracted much attention from other
scientists and holds the potential
to illuminate currently unexplored
areas.
"Around the world [the optical
trap] is becoming a very popular
subject. Many groups are begin
ning to work on it." Chu said.
He said the field of competition
is growing. "It's getting very
crowded. It's getting hard to stay
in front — if we (his team) are
still in front."
