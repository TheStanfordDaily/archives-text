"Where is Nicaragua?"

Touchstone Hooks, $8.95
Reviewed by Ken Roberts
For Peter Davis, Nicaragua is a study in con
tradictions. A revolutionary society whose socialist
regime cultivates relations with the bourgeoisie,
where two brothers run both the opposition and
government newspapers, and where opposition
leaders openly — and seemingly without fear —
decry the "totalitarian" nature of the government,
Davis views Nicaragua with both uncertainty and
irony.
"It is not that nothing is true in Nicaragua,"
notes Davis, "but that the truth dissolves into a
collection of meanings whose common thread is
their ambiguity. A visit to Nicaragua is a visit to
a state of flux."
Davis does an admirable job of capturing the
irony and nuance of the Nicaraguan situation. He
inserts himself into Nicaragua's complex daily
reality, ranging in his travels and interviews from
Managua's scarcity-ridden markets to the war-torn
border with Honduras, from factory workers to
international capitalists, from opposition leaders to
pro-Sandinista missionaries and Nicaraguan gov
ernment officials like Daniel Ortega and Tomas
Borge.
Providing glimpses from such diverse settings,
Davis weaves a kaleidoscope of insights that is both
highly readable and informative.
Davis is especially interested in the attitudes of
Nicaraguans towards the United States. Thus, he
provides just enough background to make sure the
reader understands that the conflict between these
two nations has deep historical roots and cannot
be attributed simply to Cuban adventurism or Nic
aragua's revolutionary insolence.
Washington policy-makers may forget an elemen
tary fact, notes Davis, but Nicaraguans rarely do:
Occupying U.S. Marines were already fighting
Nicaraguan Sandinistas when Fidel Castro was born
over 60 years ago. The contemporary animosity
between our two nations, writes Davis, is more than
a century old. It continues a long clash between the
hegemonic presumption attendant to international
power and the yearning for autonomy that accom
panies dependence and subjugation.

Not surprisingly, the author's conversations con
vey both the admiration that Nicaraguans feel for
the United States and the frequent outrage at our
meddling and heavy-handedness, the receptiveness
displayed towards the North American people or
culture, and the distrust directed at our government.
In one of his most insightful commentaries, Davis
says that it seems as if Nicaraguans believe "the
United States government is no expression of the
national will but something imposed from above or
outside, as governments in Nicaragua traditionally
have been."
"In enounters with hundreds of Nicaraguans,"
writes Davis, "I met only one, a Special Forces
soldier in the North, who believed American citizens
are responsible for our government. Everyone else
put average Americans on a pedestal above the
government .. . Everyone else . . . exonerated the
American people, with whom they said they wished
only to be friendly, for the acts committed in our
name by our leadership."
Although clearly discomfited by U.S. intervention,
Davis' book is far from being pro-Sandinista. Davis
writes of the "dirty little secret of revolution —
that revolutionaries on winning power become
precisely what they claim to abhor, an elite class."
He also wrestles with the issue of liberty and its
meaning in a revolutionary context, and asks
whether it can be maintained in a society under
attack by a hostile and more powerful neighbor.
Davis also appears unnerved by Ortega's concep
tualization of liberty in collective terms and his
assertion that U.S. freedom "is a monster" which
oppresses weaker societies. He does, however, rec
ognize that in Nicragua, "where open intellectual
forums and workers' collective bargaining rights
have both been traditionally suppressed, freedom
to speak and freedom to exploit ignorance for one's
own profit are perceived as very close."
In the end, Davis tries to avoid choosing sides,
and writes with an emotional distance that in fact
often lapses into skepticism, if not cynicism. Al
though this effort to maintain journalistic objectivity
in the midst of ambiguity and uncertainty deserves
merit, some readers will likely be troubled by the
cool detachment with which he describes the pathos
of the Nicaraguan situation.
Davis seems to hover above the characters in his
drama, descending to ask questions and relay their

thoughts without ever really being part of their
struggle. Indeed, he lacks both the language capa
bility (he is not fluent in Spanish) and the in-country
experience (only two short trips to Nicaragua) to
share more fully in this struggle.
Also, the programs that have been the centerpiece
of Nicaragua's revolutionary project — agrarian
reform, vaccination campaigns, literacy brigades,
etc. — are scarcely mentioned in the book. Nor is
it clear how such a revolutionary project is shattered
when a nation like Nicaragua — whose gross do
mestic product is roughly equivalent to what the

Pentagon spends in three days — is forced to defend
itself against U.S. aggression.
Nevertheless, "Where is Nicaragua" provides a
unique inside look into the complex human realities
of daily life in Nicaragua. For readers who already
know Nicaragua, it will bring back memories of
familiar persons and places. And for the curious
beginner, seeking a base of information from which
to interpret public debates over U.S. policy, this
book is a great place to start.

Reviewed by Ken Roberts
For Peter Davis, Nicaragua is a study in con
tradictions. A revolutionary society whose socialist
regime cultivates relations with the bourgeoisie,
where two brothers run both the opposition and
government newspapers, and where opposition
leaders openly — and seemingly without fear —
decry the "totalitarian" nature of the government,
Davis views Nicaragua with both uncertainty and
irony.
"It is not that nothing is true in Nicaragua,"
notes Davis, "but that the truth dissolves into a
collection of meanings whose common thread is
their ambiguity. A visit to Nicaragua is a visit to
a state of flux."
Davis does an admirable job of capturing the
irony and nuance of the Nicaraguan situation. He
inserts himself into Nicaragua's complex daily
reality, ranging in his travels and interviews from
Managua's scarcity-ridden markets to the war-torn
border with Honduras, from factory workers to
international capitalists, from opposition leaders to
pro-Sandinista missionaries and Nicaraguan gov
ernment officials like Daniel Ortega and Tomas
Borge.
Providing glimpses from such diverse settings,
Davis weaves a kaleidoscope of insights that is both
highly readable and informative.
Davis is especially interested in the attitudes of
Nicaraguans towards the United States. Thus, he
provides just enough background to make sure the
reader understands that the conflict between these
two nations has deep historical roots and cannot
be attributed simply to Cuban adventurism or Nic
aragua's revolutionary insolence.
Washington policy-makers may forget an elemen
tary fact, notes Davis, but Nicaraguans rarely do:
Occupying U.S. Marines were already fighting
Nicaraguan Sandinistas when Fidel Castro was born
over 60 years ago. The contemporary animosity
between our two nations, writes Davis, is more than
a century old. It continues a long clash between the
hegemonic presumption attendant to international
power and the yearning for autonomy that accom
panies dependence and subjugation.

Not surprisingly, the author's conversations con
vey both the admiration that Nicaraguans feel for
the United States and the frequent outrage at our
meddling and heavy-handedness, the receptiveness
displayed towards the North American people or
culture, and the distrust directed at our government.
In one of his most insightful commentaries, Davis
says that it seems as if Nicaraguans believe "the
United States government is no expression of the
national will but something imposed from above or
outside, as governments in Nicaragua traditionally
have been."
"In enounters with hundreds of Nicaraguans,"
writes Davis, "I met only one, a Special Forces
soldier in the North, who believed American citizens
are responsible for our government. Everyone else
put average Americans on a pedestal above the
government .. . Everyone else . . . exonerated the
American people, with whom they said they wished
only to be friendly, for the acts committed in our
name by our leadership."
Although clearly discomfited by U.S. intervention,
Davis' book is far from being pro-Sandinista. Davis
writes of the "dirty little secret of revolution —
that revolutionaries on winning power become
precisely what they claim to abhor, an elite class."
He also wrestles with the issue of liberty and its
meaning in a revolutionary context, and asks
whether it can be maintained in a society under
attack by a hostile and more powerful neighbor.
Davis also appears unnerved by Ortega's concep
tualization of liberty in collective terms and his
assertion that U.S. freedom "is a monster" which
oppresses weaker societies. He does, however, rec
ognize that in Nicragua, "where open intellectual
forums and workers' collective bargaining rights
have both been traditionally suppressed, freedom
to speak and freedom to exploit ignorance for one's
own profit are perceived as very close."
In the end, Davis tries to avoid choosing sides,
and writes with an emotional distance that in fact
often lapses into skepticism, if not cynicism. Al
though this effort to maintain journalistic objectivity
in the midst of ambiguity and uncertainty deserves
merit, some readers will likely be troubled by the
cool detachment with which he describes the pathos
of the Nicaraguan situation.
Davis seems to hover above the characters in his
drama, descending to ask questions and relay their

thoughts without ever really being part of their
struggle. Indeed, he lacks both the language capa
bility (he is not fluent in Spanish) and the in-country
experience (only two short trips to Nicaragua) to
share more fully in this struggle.
Also, the programs that have been the centerpiece
of Nicaragua's revolutionary project — agrarian
reform, vaccination campaigns, literacy brigades,
etc. — are scarcely mentioned in the book. Nor is
it clear how such a revolutionary project is shattered
when a nation like Nicaragua — whose gross do
mestic product is roughly equivalent to what the

Pentagon spends in three days — is forced to defend
itself against U.S. aggression.
Nevertheless, "Where is Nicaragua" provides a
unique inside look into the complex human realities
of daily life in Nicaragua. For readers who already
know Nicaragua, it will bring back memories of
familiar persons and places. And for the curious
beginner, seeking a base of information from which
to interpret public debates over U.S. policy, this
book is a great place to start.
