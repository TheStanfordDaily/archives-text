William Kennedy, "Qulnn's Book" (Viking, $8.95)
Several contemporary American authors write in a tradition
established by Melville, Conrad and Faulkner. These authors
focus their fictitious worlds on specific geographical regions and
write tight, complex narratives about the inhabitants.
Among them, William Kennedy was awarded the Pulitzer Prize
in 1984 for his novel "Ironweed," the last book of his Albany
cycle. The Cycle, composed of "Legs," "Billy Phalen's Greatest
Game" and "Ironweed," captured life in Albany from the 1920s
through the end of the Depression.
Kennedy's most recent novel, "Quinn's Book," chronicles the
life of an orphan in Albany in 1848. Through the orphan's eyes
and writing, we see his turbulent life from ages 13 to 29 and
witness the unfolding of the city's own story.
Kennedy employs two narrators, the first-person voice of the
orphan, Quinn, which opens and closes the book, and an om
niscient third-person voice which relates to the reader the events
of the middle two sections.
Each narrator uses a wide variety of 19th century writing styles,
from traditional song lyrics and poetry, to political essays and
reports of sporting events. As a result, the novel can be read as
an intelligent, sensitive tribute to the age of typographic discourse
at its finest hour, when Americans were just coming to know the
power of the written word to affect social and political change
through the expendable pages of newspapers like the "Albany
Chronicle".
In all his fictions, Kennedy writes about New York's capital city
with the authority of an historian. In his work, plot is not so much
a foundation as a superstructure — one can admire it for its own
qualities or move through to read at deeper levels. This is as
true of "Quinn's Book" as of the Albany Cycle. And while the
book does not come together as tightly as in Kennedy's other
writings, it remains a perpetuating, delightful read.
