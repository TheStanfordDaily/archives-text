Anne Tyler's recent works, "The Accidental
Tourist," "Searching for Caleb" and the re
cently acclaimed "Dinner at the Homesick Res
taurant," deal with life as it is seen from
within the family's protective but often restric
tive sphere of influence. In these works, Tyler
explores the relationships between family "in
siders" (blood relatives) and the outside world.
Marriage, divorce and separations provide the
arena in which these relationships are tested
and continually redefined.
Although it explores many of these same
themes, Tyler's latest novel, "Breathing Les
sons," has none of the hot-house atmosphere
that made some of her previous works
tiresome. "Breathing Lessons" is, well, a
breath of fresh air.
Tyler's story centers around a middle-aged
Baltimore couple and their family. Ira Morna,
the husband, is aloof but honestly loving. An
"insider" in the Moran family, he runs the
family business and takes care of his ailing
father and psychologically burdensome sisters.
Ira's wife, Maggie, is strongly protective of
family integrity. She continually tries to ma
nipulate her divorced son and his ex-wife into
getting back together. Sometimes, though, she
is ready to throw her own marriage away in
anger.
Tyler weaves these opposing, wrenching
forces between her characters with power and
grace. Still, the tone of the story is light, and
often wryly comic. When Maggie's daughter
in-law accuses her of bickering too much with
Ira, for instance, Maggie's reaction tells all.
"Maybe it was silly of her," writes Tyler,
"but she had always secretly believed that
outsiders regarded her marriage with envy.
'We're not bickering, we're just discussing,'
she said. 'We're compiling our two views of
things."'
Apart from the relationship between Maggie
and Ira, "Breathing Lessons" also centers
around the divorce of their leather-jacketed
son, Jesse, and his twiggy ex-wife, Fiona.
Fiona is treated as an "outsider" but her
daughter, Leroy, is still a Moran by blood.
Maggie desperately tries to reincorporate
Leroy into the Moran family after the divorce,
but Leroy lives with her mother, and Fiona
and her family are, to say the least, reluctant

to cooperate.
Tyler's keen sense of family dynamics rings
true psychologically and, as always, her depic
tion of the Baltimore area is vivid. Not sur
prisingly, Tyler herself lives in Baltimore, is
married to a psychologist, and has two
children. The personal nature of Tyler's works
clearly lends it a deep, intimate feel.
"Breathing Lessons" is certainly among the
best of Tyler's 11 novels. Where "Dinner at
the Homesick Restauraunt" and"The Ac

cidental Tourist" focus upon the peculiar lives
of strikingly introverted characters, in
"Breathing Lessons," the analogous charac
ters are more peripheral. Tyler has success
fully explored a different area of her domain,
just as so many of her characters learn to
venture a little farther from home while
remaining (at least spiritually) in Baltimore
with their families.
