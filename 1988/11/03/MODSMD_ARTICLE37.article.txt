## Does Chris Sabo deserve the Rookie of the Year award? 
### 
Let me first respond to a letter
regarding my column on Oct. 20.
Dear Mr. Portnoy:
In my opinion you were incor
rect in asserting in your recent
column, "Is the NHL on its last
legs?" that ESPN "filed for
divorce" from the National
Hockey League. From what I

know of the types of people who
work for ESPN and the articles
that I have read on the subject,
the opposite is true. The NHL
has dumped ESPN for more
money and less exposure.
In an article dated Oct. 6,
1988, the San Jose Mercury News
states, "in signing a contract with
Sports Channel America, the
NHL made a controversial move.
Critics say the league has lost a
great partner in ESPN, a na
tional cable network that did a

solid job showcasing the sport
coast to coast. Sports Channel, a
small regionally oriented net
work, will give the NHL more
money up front but presumably
less exposure."
This last statement is true be
cause as of now Sports Channel
is mainly on the East Coast. This
leaves most of the United States
without NHL-televised games,
unless of course local cable com
panies would pick up this
channel. And as everyone knows,
unless you have lots of requests,
this does not happen.
I recently wrote a letter to the
NHL expressing my disappoint
ment in their decision, pointing
out how this decision has set back
hopes of getting a NHL expan
sion team in the Bay Area. In
conclusion, I would urge every
one who is a hockey fan to write
the National Hockey League and
express their disappointment in
this unwise decision.
Sincerely,
Ms. Kit Weinrichter
It's exciting to see so rabid a
hockey fan in the Bay Area. Ms.
Weinrichter's interest in the
NHL obviously far exceeds mine.
Yet neither her observations nor
the Mercury News article change
my opinion on the NHL's new
contract with Sports Channel.

Before receiving its lucrative
contract with the NFL, ESPN
needed its contract with the
NHL. This contract, along with
the network's coverage of college
football, was ESPN's lifeblood.
Once the NFL came knocking on
ESPN's door, the NHL contract
became infinitely less important.
It was no longer a financial ne
cessity for ESPN to continue
covering the NHL.
When bid time came around,
ESPN shrunk its wallet. Ms.
Weinrichter also sent me a letter
ESPN's President mailed to her
after she inquired about the loss
of the NHL contract. Roger
Werner, president of ESPN, said
the company was "very sorry"
that the NHL chose Sports Cha
nnel for "what amounted to
$180,000 per team per year."
This tells me it wasn't cost ef
fective for ESPN to open its cof
fers to the NHL. Why? Because
of the monetary padding pro
vided by the NFL.
And this is my great fear —
that we're headed toward the
monopolization of sports TV by
the Big Three sports: football,
baseball and basketball. Don't
tell me about the mudbogging
shown on ESPN. This is filler
that costs nothing. I'm worried
about coverage of tennis, golf,
auto racing and others. These
are big-money, nationally promi

nent sports that could be fazed
out of network TV just like hock
ey. And I don't mean the Indy
500, the Masters and
Wimbledon. I'm talking about
events like racing's Talledaga
500, golf's Greater Hartford
Open and tennis' Volvo Grand
Prix. I don't want to see these
leave television. They are
watched and, like Ms. Weinrich
ter, fans of these sports would
starve without this regular TV
coverage.
I don't blame the NHL — it
went for the up-front cash. And
as Ms. Weinrichter suggests, in
doing so the league may have
helped seal its own fate.

Cincinnati fans have received
a small piece of consolation after
the Reds finished second in the
National League West for the
fourth straight season.
On Tuesday, Chris "Spuds"
Sabo was named National
League rookie of the year.
Sabo had unequivocably the
best first half of any N.L. rookie
— .312 average, 32 doubles, 10
homers, 35 RBI. And that won
him the award. Because he came
to pieces in the second half —
one homer, 9 RBI, 8 doubles,
average fell to .271. But then so
did Mark McGwire last year. I'm
not trying to compare McGwire's
moderate decline to Sabo's col

lapse. My point is that Sabo so
took the league by storm (like
McGwire) that he was estab
lished in the writer's minds as
the front-runner early in the
season.
Mark Grace of the Chicago
Cubs was equally deserving.
Grace batted .296 and knocked
in 56 runs. He lost to Sabo in
the voting by just 18 points. By
contrast, the Oakland A's Walt
Weiss, yesterday named the
American League rookie of the
year, thumped second-place
Bryan Harvey of the California
Angels (the majors' best-kept se
cret of 1988), 103 to 49.
Grace finished second because
he never captured the writers'
imagination during the season.
And Sabo did, carrying Cincin
nati through the first half of the
season, when the New Red Ma
chine (Eric Davis, Kal Daniels
and Paul O'Neill) was trying to
get its feet on the ground.
And even though Sabo's
average dropped 40 points after
the All-Star break, he never
stopped running. As the Car
dinals' Vince Coleman has
proven, one need not hit for high
average to steal many bases.
Sabo continued to gobble up the
astroturf and finished with 46
thefts, fourth in the league.
Los Angeles Dodger pitcher
Tim Belcher was also a viable

candidate. He finished 12-6 with
a 2.96 ERA and 152 strikeouts
in 180 innings of work. Not bad.
But Chris Sabo had a year equal
to that of Coleman in 1985, and
Coleman was chosen Rookie of
the Year over Cincinnati's Tom
Browning, the first rookie pitcher
to win 20 games since the Im
maculate Conception. So Bel
cher's out.
That leaves Ron Gant of the
Atlanta Braves. Throughout the
summer, I watched Gant on
WTBS and was continually im
pressed. When Sabo went cold, I
thought Gant would deserve the
award by season's end. He re
mained consistent, and finished
at .259 with 19 homers and 60
RBI. Gant's power numbers
make him a viable candidate. But
Sabo doubled Gant's stolen base
total, topped Gant in average,
and Spuds' 40 doubles put him
third in the league.
When I sat down to write this
column, I was looking for an ex
cuse to berate the writers for
choosing Sabo after his second
half demise. But once I had the
statistics in front of me, I realized
their choice was correct. Sabo's
stats hold their own against both
Grace and Gant. And none of his
three top competitors impacted
his team at any time in the reg
ular season the way Sabo juiced
the Reds the entire first half.
