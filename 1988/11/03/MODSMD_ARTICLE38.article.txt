# Goalie Edwards to opponents: You'll get no goals and like it
## Sophomore holds Stanford single-season record for shutouts 
### Andrew von Nordenflycht 
The ball cleared both fullbacks and
ran obediently to the feet of the forward.
Charging upfield, the forward prepared
to unleash a shot at the goal. However,
the goalie suddenly began a menacing
rush towards the ball, and as the for
ward squeezed off a shot which harm
lessly bounced off the goalie's body, the
two players collided with shocking force.
Now with the ball safely cleared, Elise
Edwards rose to her feet and quickly
returned to the goalie's box to await
the next attack.
Stopping over 10 shots per game and
amassing a school-record-setting 11
shutouts, goalie Elise Edwards has been
a major factor behind the Stanford
women's soccer team's startling season.
Stanford Coach Berhane Andeberhan
praises her as one of the best goalies
he has ever coached. "I wouldn't trade
her for anybody in the nation," he says.
"Her phenomenal talent and her intense
motivation make her an inspiration on
and off the field."
In high school, soccer was only one
of several sports Edwards played, sec
ond to basketball. Goaltending was no
big deal; indeed, she did not even want
to be a goalie. On a team that won the
state championship her junior and
senior years, she saw very little action
around the goal. "I'd hate games... 90
minutes and I'd have to stand there."
At Stanford, however, playing against
the nation's top teams and on a team
that plays defensively, Edwards' job is
considerably more demanding. But she
immensely enjoys this increased pres
sure.
She relishes one-on-one situations,
aggressively charging any challenging

opponents. "I'm basically thinking 'just
get the ball,"' she explained. And she's
not adverse to physical contact, giving
opposing forwards something to think
about before getting too close again.
Game after game she continues to en
dure kicks, collisions, and balls in the
face (despite strained ligaments in her
hand).

wards does not let it affect her play.
"It's not as bad as you think it will
be," she commented, "I just get angry
and play tougher."
She avoids getting depressed and
maintains composure throughout the
game, which is no easy task for a player
who has plenty of time to stand around
and worry about past and future mis
takes. Watching her learn from each
goal and play tougher as the game
progresses, Andeberhan marveled,

"She's a perfectionist. .. . She has no
idea how good she is."
Just as impressive is Edwards' atti
tude off the field. She works year-round
with the team on field drills and weight
training, while practicing three hours a
day during the season.
Edwards credits the team's year-long
commitment and intensity as the key
to this year's success. She said that the
team's success this season stems not
from a dramatic turnaround but merely
going "over the hump" from losing lots
of close games to winning them.
Edwards is a large source of the mo
tivation and enthusiasm so vital to the
team's success. Intense during field
drills and confident during games, she
leads the team on and off the field.
Andeberhan said he loves coaching her,
describing her as "one of the
building blocks of the team. .. a tre
mendous leader."
But the obscurity surrounding soccer
requires a deep devotion to the game,
especially since there is almost no pos
sibility of playing after college. Her rea
son for playing: "I enjoy it," she ex
plained. However, she also pointed to
the closeness of the team and coach
"Andeberhan as big factors influencing
her motivation.
Edwards asserted that the soccer
team is one of the most close-knit teams
on campus. Most of her closest friends
come from the team. "The team is so
much more than just games and prac
tices. I really don't know what Stanford
would be like if I didn't play soccer."
Aggressive, committed, and moti
vated, Elise Edwards has provided spec
tators with dramatic saves and has led
her team "over the hump" and into the
national rankings.

Elise Edwards makes yet another save. The sophomore goalie, with the help of a
stellar Cardinal defense, has amassed an astounding 11 shutouts this season.
The ball cleared both fullbacks and
ran obediently to the feet of the forward.
Charging upfield, the forward prepared
to unleash a shot at the goal. However,
the goalie suddenly began a menacing
rush towards the ball, and as the for
ward squeezed off a shot which harm
lessly bounced off the goalie's body, the
two players collided with shocking force.
Now with the ball safely cleared, Elise
Edwards rose to her feet and quickly
returned to the goalie's box to await
the next attack.
Stopping over 10 shots per game and
amassing a school-record-setting 11
shutouts, goalie Elise Edwards has been
a major factor behind the Stanford
women's soccer team's startling season.
Stanford Coach Berhane Andeberhan
praises her as one of the best goalies
he has ever coached. "I wouldn't trade
her for anybody in the nation," he says.
"Her phenomenal talent and her intense
motivation make her an inspiration on
and off the field."
In high school, soccer was only one
of several sports Edwards played, sec
ond to basketball. Goaltending was no
big deal; indeed, she did not even want
to be a goalie. On a team that won the
state championship her junior and
senior years, she saw very little action
around the goal. "I'd hate games... 90
minutes and I'd have to stand there."
At Stanford, however, playing against
the nation's top teams and on a team
that plays defensively, Edwards' job is
considerably more demanding. But she
immensely enjoys this increased pres
sure.
She relishes one-on-one situations,
aggressively charging any challenging

opponents. "I'm basically thinking 'just
get the ball,"' she explained. And she's
not adverse to physical contact, giving
opposing forwards something to think
about before getting too close again.
Game after game she continues to en
dure kicks, collisions, and balls in the
face (despite strained ligaments in her
hand).

wards does not let it affect her play.
"It's not as bad as you think it will
be," she commented, "I just get angry
and play tougher."
She avoids getting depressed and
maintains composure throughout the
game, which is no easy task for a player
who has plenty of time to stand around
and worry about past and future mis
takes. Watching her learn from each
goal and play tougher as the game
progresses, Andeberhan marveled,

"She's a perfectionist. .. . She has no
idea how good she is."
Just as impressive is Edwards' atti
tude off the field. She works year-round
with the team on field drills and weight
training, while practicing three hours a
day during the season.
Edwards credits the team's year-long
commitment and intensity as the key
to this year's success. She said that the
team's success this season stems not
from a dramatic turnaround but merely
going "over the hump" from losing lots
of close games to winning them.
Edwards is a large source of the mo
tivation and enthusiasm so vital to the
team's success. Intense during field
drills and confident during games, she
leads the team on and off the field.
Andeberhan said he loves coaching her,
describing her as "one of the
building blocks of the team. .. a tre
mendous leader."
But the obscurity surrounding soccer
requires a deep devotion to the game,
especially since there is almost no pos
sibility of playing after college. Her rea
son for playing: "I enjoy it," she ex
plained. However, she also pointed to
the closeness of the team and coach
"Andeberhan as big factors influencing
her motivation.
Edwards asserted that the soccer
team is one of the most close-knit teams
on campus. Most of her closest friends
come from the team. "The team is so
much more than just games and prac
tices. I really don't know what Stanford
would be like if I didn't play soccer."
