There was no doubt about it.
It was a game Stanford had to
win.
But even though victory was
assured at the annual Cardinal-
White scrimmmage last night at
Maples Pavilion, it was a bit of a
struggle.
For the record, the final score
was 97-90, White, in overtime.
The Cardinal team miraculously
forced the overtime with 0:00
remaining when, trailing 82-73 at
the buzzer, nine points were magi
cally added to the scoreboard.
Though there was some comedy
in the ground rules, the scrim
mage showed that despite display
ing the depth that is contributing
to its many preseason accolades,
Stanford still needs more practice
to make it all come together.
"We've gone into a going
through-the-motions-stage as far
as practice," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "We got to an
advanced stage pretty quickly ...
but there's not been that much
improvement over the last four or
five days,
"We obviously have much better
depth (this year), which is a real
plus for us," Montgomery said.
"(But) we need our veteran kids,
who should know what they are

doing, to do a better job of reading
out there."
In the first half, the starting
team of seniors Eric Reveno,
Bryan McSweeney, Howard
Wright, Todd Lichti and Terry
Taylor played together as a unit
â€” but wound up trailing at
halftime, 40-35, despite a domi
nant first half by Wright.
At halftime, in a blockbuster
deal made behind closed doors,
White team players Taylor and
McSweeney were traded to the
Cardinal squad in exchange for
sophomore Deshon Wingate,
junior Oliver Cunningham and
several players to enter the game
later.
Though the vets and the rookies
were now mixed, many of the
younger players continued to
shine, especially a seemingly
much-improved Wingate and 6-
foot-9 freshman Adam Keefe.
"Depth is never a problem,"
Montgomery said, but later went
on that "the younger kids
shouldn't be able to do as well as
they've done early on."
Yesterday, the addition of an
other exhibition was announced.
The Brewster Heights Packing
AAU Club, an amateur team at
the caliber of Athletes in Action,
according to Montgomery, will
visit the Cardinal at Maples Nov.
9 at 7:30 p.m.
