# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
This week, The Daily looked to the football
and field hockey teams in selecting our Ath
letes of the Week. After careful deliberation,
the honorees are Kat Thomas and Jon
Voldc.
Eleven days ago, on the first game of the
team's eastern road swing, Thomas scored

all three goals to pace the Cardinal's 3-1
Sunday afternoon triumph over the No. 12
Temple Owls.
Thomas' good fortune continued the next
day against the second-ranked University of
North Carolina Tar Heels. Thomas scored
one of the Cardinal's two goals, but the
team succumbed to the Tar Heels, 3-2.
This past Saturday, Thomas continued her
assault on opposing goaltenders. Against
Chico State, a team that had defeated the
Cardinal earlier this season, Thomas scored
Stanford's lone goal in a 1-0 win.
Finally, Thomas scored again Sunday in
the Cardinal's 2-1 loss to California.

Volpe, also 5-7, hails from Tucson, Ariz.
The sophomore fullback rushed for a school
record 220 yards in the Cardinal's 28-25
defeat at the hands of the Washington
Huskies.
Volpe was a workhorse, carrying the ball
29 times en route to breaking Darrin Nel
son's single-game school rushing record of
211 yards, set against San Jose State in
1977.
If he gains 141 yards in the Cardinal's
final three games, Volpe will become the
third back to gain 1,000 yards in Stanford
history, joining Nelson and Brad Muster.
Volpe needs to average only 70.3 yards
per game to break Nelson's single-season

Stanford record of 1,069 yards. That should
be an easy task considering that Volpe is
averaging 107.4 yards per contest — 15th
best in the nation.
It was only the seventh time in Stanford
history that a running back gained over 200
yards on the ground in a single game


Kat Thomas
Scored six goals in eight days


Jon Volpe
Rushed for a record 220 yards
