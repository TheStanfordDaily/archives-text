# Weiss captures A.L. Rookie of the Year
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - Shortstop Walt
Weiss was selected American League Rookie
of the Year Wednesday by the Baseball
Writers Association of America, the third
straight season a member of the Oakland
Athletics has won the honor.
Oakland's Jose Canseco was Rookie of
the Year in 1986 and first baseman Mark
McGwire won the award last year. While
Canseco and McGwire brought the A's
power, Weiss' slick fielding helped Oakland
win the AL pennant.
Since the inception of the award in 1949,
no other AL club has ever had three con
secutive winners. From 1979-1982, Rick
Sutcliffe, Steve Howe, Fernando Valen
zuela and Steve Sax won as Los Angeles
Dodgers in the National League.
In 1987, Oakland was 11th in the AL
in fielding with 142 errors. This year, the
A's finished third with only 105. The only
two teams ahead of the Athletics, Minne
sota with 84 errors and Boston with 93,
had fewer than the previous major-league
low.
Only one of Weiss' 15 errors came after
July 8, and he handled 261 straight chances
over 58 consecutive games without an error
down the stretch.
Weiss' 58-game errorless streak ended
Sept. 21 when he booted Tommy Herr's
grounder against Minnesota. Weiss got a
standing ovation from the fans who were
aware of his streak.
"That's the first time I ever got a stand
ing ovation for an error. It's tough making
an error but nice to be recognized," said
Weiss, whose streak ended 14 games short
of the major-league record for shortstops.
"I couldn't tip my hat after making an
error."
Weiss hit .250 with three homers and 39
runs batted in. He also had 17 doubles
and a grand slam at Detroit on July 10.
Hitting just .167 after 26 games, Weiss
sprained his left ankle May 4 and had to
sit out six games. He said the injury was
a turning point.

"I did a lot of watching and I told myself
when I got back in things would be differ
ent," he said. "It was going to be a new
beginning."
Weiss' new beginning ended with the
Athletics in the playoffs against Boston
and a four-game sweep of the Red Sox. He
played a key role in the first two games
at Fenway Park.
In the opener, he made a diving stop of
a ground ball to possibly save a run in
Oakland's 2-1 victory and hit a double off
the Green Monster in left, something no
Red Sox player managed in the two games.
In Game 2, Weiss drove in the game
winning run with a single in the ninth
inning off relief ace Lee Smith.
Things didn't go as well in the World
Series, as the A's lost in five games to Los
Angeles and Weiss went 1-for-16 with an
error.
Weiss, who turns 25 on Nov. 28, said he
didn't feel like a rookie while assuming a
leadership role in the Oakland infield.
"I don't think there's any such thing as
a rookie mistake," Weiss said. "If I make
a mistake, it's not because I'm a rookie.
I've been playing the game since I was
eight years old."
The 6-foot, 175-pound Weiss was the A's
No. 1 pick in the June 1985 draft after
attending the University of North Carolina.
He moved up to Class AA Huntsville in
1986 and last year hit .285 there, .263 in
Class AAA Tacoma and .462 in 16 games
with Oakland before getting off to a shaky
start this season.
The A's decided to make Weiss their
regular shortstop last Dec. 11 when they
traded veteran Alfredo Griffin to Los An
geles and ended up with pitchers Bob Welch
and Jay Howell.
"In my opinion he's been the key to our
season," Sandy Alderson, the A's vice pres
ident for baseball operations, said during
the playoffs. "He's the one who made our
trade for Welch possible."

Athletics has won the honor.
Oakland's Jose Canseco was Rookie of
the Year in 1986 and first baseman Mark
McGwire won the award last year. While
Canseco and McGwire brought the A's
power, Weiss' slick fielding helped Oakland
win the AL pennant.
Since the inception of the award in 1949,
no other AL club has ever had three con
secutive winners. From 1979-1982, Rick
Sutcliffe, Steve Howe, Fernando Valen
zuela and Steve Sax won as Los Angeles
Dodgers in the National League.
In 1987, Oakland was 11th in the AL
in fielding with 142 errors. This year, the
A's finished third with only 105. The only
two teams ahead of the Athletics, Minne
sota with 84 errors and Boston with 93,
had fewer than the previous major-league
low.
Only one of Weiss' 15 errors came after
July 8, and he handled 261 straight chances
over 58 consecutive games without an error
down the stretch.
Weiss' 58-game errorless streak ended
Sept. 21 when he booted Tommy Herr's
grounder against Minnesota. Weiss got a
standing ovation from the fans who were
aware of his streak.
"That's the first time I ever got a stand
ing ovation for an error. It's tough making
an error but nice to be recognized," said
Weiss, whose streak ended 14 games short
of the major-league record for shortstops.
"I couldn't tip my hat after making an
error."
Weiss hit .250 with three homers and 39
runs batted in. He also had 17 doubles
and a grand slam at Detroit on July 10.
Hitting just .167 after 26 games, Weiss
sprained his left ankle May 4 and had to
sit out six games. He said the injury was
a turning point.

"I did a lot of watching and I told myself
when I got back in things would be differ
ent," he said. "It was going to be a new
beginning."
Weiss' new beginning ended with the
Athletics in the playoffs against Boston
and a four-game sweep of the Red Sox. He
played a key role in the first two games
at Fenway Park.
In the opener, he made a diving stop of
a ground ball to possibly save a run in
Oakland's 2-1 victory and hit a double off
the Green Monster in left, something no
Red Sox player managed in the two games.
In Game 2, Weiss drove in the game
winning run with a single in the ninth
inning off relief ace Lee Smith.
Things didn't go as well in the World
Series, as the A's lost in five games to Los
Angeles and Weiss went 1-for-16 with an
error.
Weiss, who turns 25 on Nov. 28, said he
didn't feel like a rookie while assuming a
leadership role in the Oakland infield.
"I don't think there's any such thing as
a rookie mistake," Weiss said. "If I make
a mistake, it's not because I'm a rookie.
I've been playing the game since I was
eight years old."
The 6-foot, 175-pound Weiss was the A's
No. 1 pick in the June 1985 draft after
attending the University of North Carolina.
He moved up to Class AA Huntsville in
1986 and last year hit .285 there, .263 in
Class AAA Tacoma and .462 in 16 games
with Oakland before getting off to a shaky
start this season.
The A's decided to make Weiss their
regular shortstop last Dec. 11 when they
traded veteran Alfredo Griffin to Los An
geles and ended up with pitchers Bob Welch
and Jay Howell.
"In my opinion he's been the key to our
season," Sandy Alderson, the A's vice pres
ident for baseball operations, said during
the playoffs. "He's the one who made our
trade for Welch possible."
