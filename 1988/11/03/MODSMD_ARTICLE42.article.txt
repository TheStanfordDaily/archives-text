# Experts argue ethics of legalized abortion

### Maryellen Driscoll 
Two medical experts clashed
over the legal and moral implica
tions of outlawing abortion in a
Tuesday night debate at Sterling
Quad.
Chemistry Prof. Carl Djerassi,
co-inventor of "The Pill," argued
that making abortion illegal is "a
policy of poor politics," while Dr.
Terrance Chang, a pediatrician at
the UC-San Francisco School of
Medicine, equated abortion with
"murder."
In addition to Chang and
Djerassi, the debate featured two
Stanford students, an alumnus
and a lawyer from Operation Res
cue, a pro-life organization.
The Human Biology Depart
ment sponsored the debate, which

drew a crowd of 100 students.
Catherine Short from Opera
tion Rescue said women would
think twice about risking preg
nancy if abortions were made il
legal.
Rebutting her argument,
Djerassi cited "skyrocketing)"
pregnancy rates in Romania when
the country illegalized abortions
in the 19605.
He added that it did not take
long for abortions to go "under
ground" in Romania.
Djerassi said that if abortions
were made illegal in this country,
women would resort to "back
alley" abortions, seek abortions in
other countries or leave their
children in the streets.
Supporting Djerassi, Bettina
Kurkjian, a 1984 Stanford grad

uate in biology, criticized the ac
tions of organizations such as
Operation Rescue, which tried to
close down the Family Planning
Alternatives clinic in Sunnyvale
last Saturday.
"The action of these groups
really shows a lack of compas
sion," said Kurkjian, the former
director of a San Francisco family
planning center. "I find this of
fensive."
Emphasizing the value of
choice, Pilar Ossorio, a graduate
student in immunology and micro
biology, said women should have
the "moral authority" to control
their own destiny.
Kurkjian added that "women
choose abortions because they feel
it's the best of a bad set of
choices."

However, Jennifer Bryson, a
senior in human biology and pres
ident of the Stanford Republicans,
argued that having an abortion
should not be a woman's choice
because a baby is a human life.
Questioning his opponents' ar
guments, Chang contended that
the fetus is alive at the moment
of conception. "If Dr. Djerassi does
not think a fetus is a human life,
then what is it? Is it dead?"
After the debate, Bill Burnside,
a senior in human biology, said
Chang "came out with emotional
appeals rather than rational ar
guments."
"We weren't there to be
preached at," Burnside added.
Cloantha Copass, a senior in
history, said calling the program
a debate was really "a misnomer."
