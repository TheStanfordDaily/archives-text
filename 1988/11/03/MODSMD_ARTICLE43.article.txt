# Polls show tighter race as Eshoo trims Campbell's lead
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Staff writer 
With less than a week to go
before the elections, polls con
ducted by both sides show Demo
cratic candidate Anna Eshoo
gaining on Republican candidate
Tom Campbell in the race for the
12th congressional district seat.
In a press conference Tuesday
morning Campbell, a Stanford law
professor, announced he is leading
Eshoo 43 percent to 33 percent —
a decline of five points over pre
vious Campbell polls. The Camp
bell campaign conducted a poll of
300 voters Sunday and Monday.
However, Eshoo's campaign
conducted a similar poll of 500
voters on Sunday, resulting in Es
hoo leading Campbell 38 percent

to 36 percent.
Campbell's press officer Louis
Bonsignore said he was "feeling
pretty good" about the election.
The polls show that Eshoo "would
need 17 out of 18 undecided votes
to actually win the election," he
said.
Cliff Staton, Eshoo's press of
ficer, also said he was optimistic
about the election. "We've been
building up momentum for the
last month," he said. "And we're
extremely excited about how far
we've come."
In a letter dated Oct. 28, more
than 80 members of the Stanford
faculty, including 11 of Camp
bell's colleagues at the Law
School, announced their support
for Eshoo.
Both candidates will be stepping

ClHi u< s

up their efforts to get out the
vote in the next five days.
According to Bonsignore,
Campbell will be holding a
televised town meeting this Sun
day night to field questions from
voters. In addition, campaign vol
unteers will be staffing phone
banks every night this week
trying to contact "as many of the
37,000 undecided votes as possi
ble," he said.
Eshoo campaign volunteers and
supporters will also be manning
phone banks, walking precincts
and working the polls, Staton
said.

In a press conference yesterday
on the steps of the Palo Alto
courthouse, several environmen
talists independent of the Eshoo
campaign issued a statement
denouncing Campbell's environ
mental record. Nineteen local gov
ernment and community mem
bers, including Bruce Babbitt, en
dorsed the statement.
Carol Mullen, a 1953 Stanford
graduate and a member of several
environmental organizations, was
joined by Ted Smith, director of
the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition
and Duane Garrett, a former
member of the California Coastal
Commission and former national
co-chair of the Mondale campaign,
to call attention to Campbell's au
thorship of California Senate Bill
379.

Campbell said t.h#> Kill i« He
signed to decrease "frivolous
litigation," or "suing just for the
sake of getting money even if you
haven't been hurt."
The bill calls for the losing
party in a lawsuit to pay a per
centage of the winner's attorney
fees if the loser originally refused
to accept the winner's out of court
settlement. The percentage is
related to the difference between
the original offer and the final
sum awarded by the jury.
The environmentalists' com
plaint is that the law, which does
not provide exceptions for envi
ronmental suits, would discourage
citizens from suing mqjor corpo
rations that are polluting the en
vironment.
Smith said the bill would make

lawyers less likely to take on law
suits and more likely to settle out
side of court.
Yet, "lawsuits are the principle
means of finding out what's going
on" in environmental issues, Mul
len added.
Campbell said it was important
to recognize that the law would
apply not only to a losing plaintiff
but also to a losing defendant.
He added that the law does in
clude exemptions for injunctions.
"Virtually every environmental
case is not for money, but for an
injunction," he said.
Georgia Perkins, conservation
manager of the Palo Alto Sierra
Club, which has endorsed both
Campbell and Eshoo, said she
agreed that the bill is not anti
environmental.

haven't been hurt."
The bill calls for the losing
party in a lawsuit to pay a per
centage of the winner's attorney
fees if the loser originally refused
to accept the winner's out of court

related to the difference between
the original offer and the final
sum awarded by the jury.

plaint is that the law, which does
not provide exceptions for envi
ronmental suits, would discourage
citizens from suing mqjor corpo

vironment.
Smith said the bill would make

lawyers less likely to take on law
suits and more likely to settle out

Campbell said it was important
to recognize that the law would
apply not only to a losing plaintiff
but also to a losing defendant.
He added that the law does in
clude exemptions for injunctions.
"Virtually every environmental
case is not for money, but for an
injunction," he said.
Georgia Perkins, conservation
manager of the Palo Alto Sierra
Club, which has endorsed both
Campbell and Eshoo, said she
agreed that the bill is not anti
environmental.
