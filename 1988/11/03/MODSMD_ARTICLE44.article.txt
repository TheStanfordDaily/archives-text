Officials of Stanford's new ven
ture into adult education, the
Continuing Studies Program,
announced yesterday the course
offerings for the winter quarter.
The evening courses, taught by
Stanford professors, will focus on
seven topics in the humanities —
Masterpieces of Literature, Crea
tive Writing: Poetry, The Musical
Experience, Development of the
Short Story, Women and Moral
Theory, War and European Soci
ety and Early Christianity: Text
and Art.
The program, which began this
fall, offers specially designed
liberal arts classes to adults in
the surrounding community and
to University employees.
Any person with a high school

diploma may register for Continu
ing Studies courses. While the
courses do offer credit, the units
earned cannot be applied toward
any Stanford degrees or require
ments.
Around 200 adult students are
presently enrolled in six night
classes this quarter.
"The audience is very demand
ing and is looking for first rate
lecturers," said Program Director
Jeff Wachtel. "People working all
day who want to spend their extra
time taking these courses want to
be challenged."
Wachtel said he and Classics
Prof. Marsh McCall, who started
the program asked senior faculty
members known for their excel
lence in teaching to be lecturers
in the winter.
English Prof. Nancy Packer will

teach Development of the Short
Story, a course she presently
teaches to undergraduates and
graduates.
Packer said the experience will
be "different" because adults who
have been out of school for a while
may see things from a "different
perspective and have different re
sponses to the material."
English Profs. Denise Levertov
and Ron Rebholz will teach Cre
ative Writing: Poetry and Master
pieces of Literature, respectively.
History Prof. James Sheehan,
who is chair of the Department of
History, will teach War and Eu
ropean Society.
"As the title suggests, the
course is about the way in which
war and thinking about war
shapes and is shaped by its social
context," Sheehan said.
Sheehan said the course will

examine how the social history of
war illuminates our current stra
tegic problems.
While the program presently in
cludes only humanities courses,
Wachtel said he would like to ex
pand the program to include
courses in business and engineer
ing.
For the spring quarter, Wachtel
said he has invited a professor
from the Hoover Institution to
teach, adding that he also would
like to bring in professors from
other schools.
Wachtel also mentioned the pos
sibility of creating a Continuing
Studies degree.
Winter quarter classes cost
$100 per unit, with an additional
$25 registration fee. Classes will
meet one or two nights each week
in the History Corner.
