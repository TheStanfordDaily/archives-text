and facilitate private visits by
academics, athletes and cul
tural figures.
Chang said unofficial gov
ernment representatives in
North Korea "expressed
serious interest in normalizing
relations with the United
States."
He added that the North
Korean government will con
sider any serious proposal for
multilateral talks on reducing
tensions in the Korean penin
sula.
Chang said the biggest prob
lem in setting up the exchange
was overcoming the "great deal
of suspicion and animosity be
tween the (North) Korean and
American governments toward
each other."
He said he hopes his work
will affect the governments of
both countries. Chang said this
agreement is "an indication
that people approve of rela
tions" between the countries.
The exchange has advantages
for Stanford students, he
added. Students will benefit
from having access to the re
search conducted about North
Korean and U.S. relations.
