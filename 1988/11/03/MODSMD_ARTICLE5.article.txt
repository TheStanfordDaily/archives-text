# Non-Tresidder catering squelched
## 
### Brad Hayward Staff writer 
Two of the University's main food
service providers are currently debating
whether they both should have the right
to provide catering services on campus.
Tresidder Union, which is currently
the only full-scale catering service on
campus, argues that University re
sources would be wasted if University
Food Service implemented an additional
catering service, according to Paul

Szczesiul, associate director of Tresid
der.
Food Service, however, sees the dis
pute differently. "There is some concern
on the part of Tresidder that we're com
peting with them and limiting their abil
ity to make a profit," said Food Service
manager Jim Keeton.
"There is enough business on this
campus for us both (Food Service and
Tresidder) to be in business," he said.
The dispute arose this summer when
Food Service began a pilot program of

offering catered coffee service, light re
ceptions and box lunches to conference
groups meeting on campus. Food Serv
ice has always provided catering in the
residences and for students, said Keith
Guy, director of Housing and Food Serv
ices.
The new program started in June and
"was pretty successful over the sum
mer," Keeton said.
Melanie Jones-Carter, Food Service
manager at Wilbur Hall who was
involved in the summer catering
program, also said that a main
reason for starting the new cater
ing service was to raise more
money directly for Food Service.
"We handle most of the summer
conferences, and they live with
us," she said. "It seemed like we
were letting revenue escape that
we could be earning for the de
partment by not doing some of
the catering."
But Tresidder has traditionally
filled the role of the campus cater
ing service, and the new summer
catering offered by Food Service
"raised concern on a number of
fronts," Szczesiul said.
Representatives of Tresidder

and the Office of Student Affairs
asked Food Service to discontinue
marketing its catering services in
August after it began to plan a
September reception for Univer
sity secretaries and office assis
tants, according to Keeton.
Jones-Carter said invitations to
the reception had been printed
and were ready to be sent out.
But late in August, Food Service
canceled the event.
"We agreed not to market but
did not agree to withdraw from
the market," Keeton said.
"We were told we could not ad
vertise and could not pursue new
business, but we could fill the
orders we already had," Jones-
Carter said.
Since late August, Food Service
has not been doing any advertis
ing for its catering and is not
actively pursuing new business.

Food Service, Tresidder and
Student Affairs officials have met
twice in an attempt to resolve the
issue, Guy said, adding that offi
cials in the Provost's Office and
the Office of the Vice President
of Business and Finance have also
raised concerns about the issue.
There is a concern right now
that Tresidder has a fixed market
on campus catering services,
Keeton said.
Szczesiul said the concern of
officials at Tresidder and else
where in the University is not
about Food Service offering cater
ing services or competing with
Tresidder, but about the amount
of resources the University is
committing to Food Service when
"two different parts of the Uni
versity are providing the same
services."
Keeton said he could "under

stand their (Tresidder's) con
cern," but noted that no limita
tions are placed on off-campus in
dependent vendors who offer
catering services on campus.
Both sides are continuing to dis
cuss the issue, and Keeton said
he hopes a solution will be reached
by late November or early Decem
ber.
"We are trying to broaden the
nature of the services we provide,"
Guy said. "But we have to be
sensitive to Tresidder's income.
They do have the mission of pro
viding non-boarding food service.
Hopefully out of the process will
come an understanding about the
role of University Food Service ."
Guy said that all profits Food
Service makes through its cater
ing services are for Food Service's
use and do not go into the Uni
versity general fund.

orders we already had," Jones-
Carter said.
Since late August, Food Service
has not been doing any advertis
ing for its catering and is not
actively pursuing new business.

Food Service, Tresidder and
Student Affairs officials have met
twice in an attempt to resolve the
issue, Guy said, adding that offi
cials in the Provost's Office and
the Office of the Vice President
of Business and Finance have also
raised concerns about the issue.
There is a concern right now
that Tresidder has a fixed market
on campus catering services,
Keeton said.
Szczesiul said the concern of
officials at Tresidder and else
where in the University is not
about Food Service offering cater
ing services or competing with
Tresidder, but about the amount
of resources the University is
committing to Food Service when
"two different parts of the Uni
versity are providing the same
services."
Keeton said he could "under

stand their (Tresidder's) con
cern," but noted that no limita
tions are placed on off-campus in
dependent vendors who offer
catering services on campus.
Both sides are continuing to dis
cuss the issue, and Keeton said
he hopes a solution will be reached
by late November or early Decem
ber.
"We are trying to broaden the
nature of the services we provide,"
Guy said. "But we have to be
sensitive to Tresidder's income.
They do have the mission of pro
viding non-boarding food service.
Hopefully out of the process will
come an understanding about the
role of University Food Service ."
Guy said that all profits Food
Service makes through its cater
ing services are for Food Service's
use and do not go into the Uni
versity general fund.
