# Non-Tresidder catering squelched
## 
### Brad Hayward Staff writer 
Two of the University's main food
service providers are currently debating
whether they both should have the right
to provide catering services on campus.
Tresidder Union, which is currently
the only full-scale catering service on
campus, argues that University re
sources would be wasted if University
Food Service implemented an additional
catering service, according to Paul

Szczesiul, associate director of Tresid
der.
Food Service, however, sees the dis
pute differently. "There is some concern
on the part of Tresidder that we're com
peting with them and limiting their abil
ity to make a profit," said Food Service
manager Jim Keeton.
"There is enough business on this
campus for us both (Food Service and
Tresidder) to be in business," he said.
The dispute arose this summer when
Food Service began a pilot program of

offering catered coffee service, light re
ceptions and box lunches to conference
groups meeting on campus. Food Serv
ice has always provided catering in the
residences and for students, said Keith
Guy, director of Housing and Food Serv
ices.
The new program started in June and
"was pretty successful over the sum
mer," Keeton said.
