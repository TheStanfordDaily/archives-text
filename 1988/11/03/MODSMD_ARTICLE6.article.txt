# Westwood's Wizard coaches life
## 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
If you heard an average person talk about his
"Pyramid of Success," you might think him or her
arrogant.
When it's former UCLA Coach John Wooden,
however, you listen.
The "Wizard of Westwood" held the attention of
the 150-person audience at his speech at Annenberg
Auditorium Tuesday night as tightly as he held a
grip on the college basketball scene during his tenure
at UCLA. Yet, the main point of his talk was that
he certainly had no monopoly on triumph.
Indeed, the coach of 10 NCAA Champions (in
cluding four undefeated teams), the All-American
player at Purdue in the 19305, had this message:
Anyone can achieve success.
"Success is peace of mind which can be attained
only through the self-satisfaction that comes from
knowing you did your best to become the best you
are capable of becoming," Wooden said, repeating
the definition that he first wrote in 1934.
Wooden did not think that definition alone was
sufficient, however, and arrived at the idea of con
structing a pyramid, where each block would be a
stepping stone toward the apex, success. For the
next 14 years, until shortly before his arrival at
UCLA in 1948, Wooden plied with his "Pyramid of
Success."

Former basketball coach John Wooden, who led
UCLA to 10 national champlonshipa, tells an au
dience how to achieve success using his tried
and true formula.
Freely citing from memory the
words of anyone from Grantland
Rice to Abraham Lincoln in his
explanation of the pyramid,
Wooden said its cornerstones,
which had to be its strongest part,
were industriousness and enthu
siasm.
"There is no substitute for
work. You can get by, but you're
not developing," he said. "(And)
if you don't like what you do, you
won't make the best of your abil
ity."
The other three blocks of the
foundation were friendship,
loyalty and cooperation. On top
of those came self-control, alert
ness, initiative and intentness.
"You can always learn from
what is going on around you,"
Wooden said of alertness.
The three blocks forming the
heart of the pyramid were condi

tion ("physical condition is
preceded by mental and moral
condition"), skill and team spirit.
The last one, like the others, ob
viously applies to more than bas
ketball.
"It's a sad commentary on our
civilization that many wars are
fought, many lives are lost, be
cause heads of state differed with
others regarding religion and
race," Wooden said. "As someone
once said, 'We are many, but are
we much?' "
Poise and confidence formed
the penultimate level of the
pyramid, which was topped by
competitive greatness.
"That's when the fun comes
into it," Wooden said. "You don't
get satisfaction out of simple
things."
To this point Wooden had
hardly mentioned his on-court ac
complishments, but here he
seemed to relish talking about
how even he has bucked the odds.
The 1964 Bruins, Wooden's
first NCAA Champions, were

ranked 77th in the preseason "by
the Dick Vitales and A 1 McGuires
of the day." They were probably
the shortest team that has won
or will ever win the title, he said.
Then, the 1970 team was the
"team without." While he was
winning three straight titles un
der Lew Alcindor (now Kareem
Abdul-Jabaar), coaches were say
ing, "Wait 'til he's gone. They'll
get there come-uppance.""
"They shouldn't have said
that," Wooden deadpanned.
The 1970 team took the title
that year, the fourth of seven
straight for UCLA.
Though many people probably
came to the talk expecting
Wooden to tell more anecdotes
like these, they didn't seem the
least bit disappointed with the
subject matter.
"I thought it was a great
speech," said junior Andrew
Berke, director of the ASSU
Speakers Bureau which sponsored
the speech. "I think we're the bet

ter for it."
"I thought it was cool that he
talked about things besides bas
ketball," senior Jeff Gilbert said.
"It was like walking into the
19505, hearing about hard work
and ethics."
The talk did turn to hoops dur
ing the ensuing question-and
answer session, and Wooden was
prompted to voice his opinion on
other issues, including .. .
• monetary compensation for
amateur athletes
"We do too much for athletes
at times. . . . Eventually they don't
know how to be independent. I
believe in helping . . . but paying
— no."
• the three-point rule
"If you get three points for
making a shot from 19 feet, nine
inches, then a basket made after
a pass and a good cut should be
worth 10 points."
• Bill Walton
"A tremendous athlete . . . but
he marches to the beat of a dif
ferent drummer, no question."

the definition that he first wrote in 1934.
Wooden did not think that definition alone was
sufficient, however, and arrived at the idea of con
structing a pyramid, where each block would be a
stepping stone toward the apex, success. For the
next 14 years, until shortly before his arrival at
UCLA in 1948, Wooden plied with his "Pyramid of
Success."

Former basketball coach John Wooden, who led
UCLA to 10 national champlonshipa, tells an au
dience how to achieve success using his tried
and true formula.
Freely citing from memory the
words of anyone from Grantland
Rice to Abraham Lincoln in his
explanation of the pyramid,
Wooden said its cornerstones,
which had to be its strongest part,
were industriousness and enthu
siasm.
"There is no substitute for
work. You can get by, but you're
not developing," he said. "(And)
if you don't like what you do, you
won't make the best of your abil
ity."
The other three blocks of the
foundation were friendship,
loyalty and cooperation. On top
of those came self-control, alert
ness, initiative and intentness.
"You can always learn from
what is going on around you,"
Wooden said of alertness.
The three blocks forming the
heart of the pyramid were condi

tion ("physical condition is
preceded by mental and moral
condition"), skill and team spirit.
The last one, like the others, ob
viously applies to more than bas
ketball.
"It's a sad commentary on our
civilization that many wars are
fought, many lives are lost, be
cause heads of state differed with
others regarding religion and
race," Wooden said. "As someone
once said, 'We are many, but are
we much?' "
Poise and confidence formed
the penultimate level of the
pyramid, which was topped by
competitive greatness.
"That's when the fun comes
into it," Wooden said. "You don't
get satisfaction out of simple
things."
To this point Wooden had
hardly mentioned his on-court ac
complishments, but here he
seemed to relish talking about
how even he has bucked the odds.
The 1964 Bruins, Wooden's
first NCAA Champions, were

ranked 77th in the preseason "by
the Dick Vitales and A 1 McGuires
of the day." They were probably
the shortest team that has won
or will ever win the title, he said.
Then, the 1970 team was the
"team without." While he was
winning three straight titles un
der Lew Alcindor (now Kareem
Abdul-Jabaar), coaches were say
ing, "Wait 'til he's gone. They'll
get there come-uppance.""
"They shouldn't have said
that," Wooden deadpanned.
The 1970 team took the title
that year, the fourth of seven
straight for UCLA.
Though many people probably
came to the talk expecting
Wooden to tell more anecdotes
like these, they didn't seem the
least bit disappointed with the
subject matter.
"I thought it was a great
speech," said junior Andrew
Berke, director of the ASSU
Speakers Bureau which sponsored
the speech. "I think we're the bet

ter for it."
"I thought it was cool that he
talked about things besides bas
ketball," senior Jeff Gilbert said.
"It was like walking into the
19505, hearing about hard work
and ethics."
The talk did turn to hoops dur
ing the ensuing question-and
answer session, and Wooden was
prompted to voice his opinion on
other issues, including .. .
• monetary compensation for
amateur athletes
"We do too much for athletes
at times. . . . Eventually they don't
know how to be independent. I
believe in helping . . . but paying
— no."
• the three-point rule
"If you get three points for
making a shot from 19 feet, nine
inches, then a basket made after
a pass and a good cut should be
worth 10 points."
• Bill Walton
"A tremendous athlete . . . but
he marches to the beat of a dif
ferent drummer, no question."
If you heard an average person talk about his
"Pyramid of Success," you might think him or her
arrogant.
When it's former UCLA Coach John Wooden,
however, you listen.
The "Wizard of Westwood" held the attention of
the 150-person audience at his speech at Annenberg
Auditorium Tuesday night as tightly as he held a
grip on the college basketball scene during his tenure
at UCLA. Yet, the main point of his talk was that
he certainly had no monopoly on triumph.
Indeed, the coach of 10 NCAA Champions (in
cluding four undefeated teams), the All-American
player at Purdue in the 19305, had this message:
Anyone can achieve success.
"Success is peace of mind which can be attained
only through the self-satisfaction that comes from
knowing you did your best to become the best you
are capable of becoming," Wooden said, repeating
the definition that he first wrote in 1934.
Wooden did not think that definition alone was
sufficient, however, and arrived at the idea of con
structing a pyramid, where each block would be a
stepping stone toward the apex, success. For the
next 14 years, until shortly before his arrival at
