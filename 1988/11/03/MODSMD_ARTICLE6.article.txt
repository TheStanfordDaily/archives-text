# Westwood's Wizard coaches life

### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
If you heard an average person talk about his
"Pyramid of Success," you might think him or her
arrogant.
When it's former UCLA Coach John Wooden,
however, you listen.
The "Wizard of Westwood" held the attention of
the 150-person audience at his speech at Annenberg
Auditorium Tuesday night as tightly as he held a
grip on the college basketball scene during his tenure
at UCLA. Yet, the main point of his talk was that
he certainly had no monopoly on triumph.
Indeed, the coach of 10 NCAA Champions (in
cluding four undefeated teams), the All-American
player at Purdue in the 19305, had this message:
Anyone can achieve success.
"Success is peace of mind which can be attained
only through the self-satisfaction that comes from
knowing you did your best to become the best you
are capable of becoming," Wooden said, repeating
the definition that he first wrote in 1934.
Wooden did not think that definition alone was
sufficient, however, and arrived at the idea of con
structing a pyramid, where each block would be a
stepping stone toward the apex, success. For the
next 14 years, until shortly before his arrival at
UCLA in 1948, Wooden plied with his "Pyramid of
Success."
