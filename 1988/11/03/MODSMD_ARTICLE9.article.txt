# Stanford doctor finds tool for DNA repair

In a breakthrough that scien
tists have awaited for many years,
Stanford researcher Gilbert Chu
has found a protein vital for ver
satile repair of damaged genetic
components in humans.
The protein found by Chu, an
assistant professor of medicine at
Stanford, is the first identified
protein in humans that is able to
locate and bind to a strand of
DNA damaged by the sun's
ultraviolet light.
"The human system is starting
to give way now," Chu said of the
discovery that marks the begin
ning of understanding the repair
process of human genetic infor
mation.
Damage repair of genetic mate
rial in bacteria is well understood
by scientists, but until now, not
a single component in human
DNA repair has been identified.
The molecule DNA stores all of

the genetic information of cells.
Damaged DNA must be repaired
because it could lead to
deleterious effects for the cell.
To repair damage in bacterial
genetic material, a certain protein
patrols the long double helical
strand of DNA, "hunting" for
signs of alteration. The protein is
so versatile that it is able to "rec
ognize" various forms of damage.
Once the first protein binds to
the damage site, another protein
binds to the same site, and then
"nicks" the DNA strand, elimi
nating the damage. The damage
nicked away is replaced by other
proteins.
Chu published his discoveries
with research assistant Elaine
Chang in the Oct. 28 issue of
Science, one of the most pres
tigious scientific journals.
Chu was studying one such dis
ease in which humans die because
they are unable to repair skin cells
