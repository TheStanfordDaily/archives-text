# Stanford doctor finds tool for DNA repair

In a breakthrough that scien
tists have awaited for many years,
Stanford researcher Gilbert Chu
has found a protein vital for ver
satile repair of damaged genetic
components in humans.
The protein found by Chu, an
assistant professor of medicine at
Stanford, is the first identified
protein in humans that is able to
locate and bind to a strand of
DNA damaged by the sun's
ultraviolet light.
"The human system is starting
to give way now," Chu said of the
discovery that marks the begin
ning of understanding the repair
process of human genetic infor
mation.
Damage repair of genetic mate
rial in bacteria is well understood
by scientists, but until now, not
a single component in human
DNA repair has been identified.
The molecule DNA stores all of

the genetic information of cells.
Damaged DNA must be repaired
because it could lead to
deleterious effects for the cell.
To repair damage in bacterial
genetic material, a certain protein
patrols the long double helical
strand of DNA, "hunting" for
signs of alteration. The protein is
so versatile that it is able to "rec
ognize" various forms of damage.
Once the first protein binds to
the damage site, another protein
binds to the same site, and then
"nicks" the DNA strand, elimi
nating the damage. The damage
nicked away is replaced by other
proteins.
Chu published his discoveries
with research assistant Elaine
Chang in the Oct. 28 issue of
Science, one of the most pres
tigious scientific journals.
Chu was studying one such dis
ease in which humans die because
they are unable to repair skin cells
damaged by the sun's ultravio
let light. Victims of XP, approx
imately one in every 250,000
people, die early in life of mul
tiple skin cancers that invade
the body.
Chu found a certain protein
in normal cells not present in
cells affected by one of the nine
forms of XP, short for
xeroderma pigmentosa. Chu
concluded that this was strong
evidence that this particular
protein was the cell responsible
for "recognizing" DNA damage
and binding to it.
The protein appears not only
to bind to DNA damaged by
ultraviolet light, but also
damage occuring from
cisplatin, a drug used in cancer
treatment. The protein shows
itself to be quite versatile, since

cisplatin damage can be de
tected even though the drug is
not found in nature.
Chu said he believes a
method for identifying carriers
of the disease might be found
from this study. Although only
one in every quarter million
people come down with the dis
ease, Chu said that the number
of people carrying the genes
for XP is significantly higher
— more than 1,000 times the
number of people who are af
flicted with the deadly disease.
Besides giving the possibility
of identifying carriers of this
specific disease, Chu's research
could lead to the understanding
of the entire mechanism of
damage repair in human DNA.
"If we can purify all the
(proteins involved in damage
repair) and then put them back
together in a test tube and get
it to work again, that's the real
test of the system," Chu said.

Portions of DNA damaged by the sun's ultraviolet light
bind together distorting the genetic code. Repair
proteins, bottom right, "recognize" this damaged DNA
(shown in black), attach to the helical strand and cut
away the damage. Enzymes replace the severed DNA.
