# False alarm forces evacuation of building
## 
### Jay Bhattacharya Staff writer 
A false alarm sounded yester
day in the Lou Henry Hoover
House, resulting in the evacua
tion of the building and the dis
ruption of at least one class.
According to the Palo Alto
Fire Department, the automatic
alarm system at the house went
off at about 2:45 p.m. yesterday,
but there was no fire. The Palo
Alto Fire Department was called
in to shut ofT the alarm.

About 50 people were
evacuated, including students
from a library in the building
and an economics class.
Captain Dale Hopkins of the
fire department said an alarm
box on the first floor had prob
ably been pulled intentionally.
"This sort of thing is done too
much (at Stanford)," he said.
"It makes the firemen here com
placent about answering calls."
On an average day at Stan
ford, the fire department
receives three to five false

alarms, according to firefighter
Jerry Davis. "Dorms, which
have very sensitive alarm sys
tems, make up most of the false
alarms," Davis said, adding that
calls to other campus buildings
on campus are rarer.
False alarms are commonly
caused by "frisbees tossed
around in narrow hallways and
burning toast," Davis said. "No
matter how much we complain,
nothing is done to improve the
situation," he said.
