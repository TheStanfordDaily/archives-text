# Quake strikes C. America
## No damage reported after tremors hit Puerto Rico

SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador
(AP) — Terrified residents of
earthquake-scarred Central
America and southern Mexico ran
into the streets yesterday when a
strong temblor rattled the region.
One death and minor damage was
reported.
Later yesterday, a strong earth
quake shook buildings and sent
people into the streets in Puerto
Rico, but an official said there
were no immediate reports of
damage or injuries in the Carib
bean island.
The Central American quake
was felt at 8:47 a.m.
In Mexico, residents of the
southern town of Tapachula
thought the local volcano was
erupting. In San Salvador, where
a 1986 earthquake killed 1,500
and injured 20,000, thousands of
people took to the streets in panic.
The quake also was felt in

Guatemala, where the National
Emergency Committee went on
alert, and to a lesser extent in
Honduras and Nicaragua. A 1972
earthquake killed 10,000 people
in Nicaragua and caused extensive
damage to Managua, the capital.
Readings on the tremor varied.
The U.S. Geological Survey in
Golden, Colo., said it measured 6
on the Richter scale. The Institute
of Seismology at the University
of Costa Rica said it measured 6.5.
An earthquake with a magni
tude of 6 on the Richter scale is
capable of doing serious damage.
The Richter scale is an open-ended
gauge of energy released by an
earthquake as measured by
ground motion recorded on a seis
mograph.
In Guatemala City, the
Guatemalan capital, a municipal
worker digging a ditch was buried
alive when the quake dislodged a

pile of earth, police said. The man
was identified as Jesus Pitan, 50.
Maj. Humberto Fuentes Soria
of Guatemala's National Emer
gency Committee said the temblor
damaged 18 homes in the western
provinces of Totonicapan and
Chimaltenango. He said walls
cracked in several public buildings
in western provinces.
In Puerto Rico, the 3:42 p.m.
quake measured 5.7 on the Rich
ter scale, said William MacCann,
director of the University of
Puerto Rico's Seismological Net
work. An aftershock measuring 4
on Richter scale followed, he said.
McCann said earthquake was
the strongest in Puerto Rico since
1979, when a temblor of 5.9 shook
the island.
He said the quake's epicenter
was in the Atlantic Ocean in the
extreme northwestern port city of
Aguadilla.
