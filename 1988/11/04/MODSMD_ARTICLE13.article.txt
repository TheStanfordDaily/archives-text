BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) — Vietnam
returned yesterday what it believes to be
remains of 23 Americans missing from
the Vietnam War, a U.S. press represen
tative said.
A military honor guard saluted
solemnly as the remains, each in a metal
casket covered with a folded U.S. flag,
were loaded onto a U.S. Air Force C-141
transport plane on the sun-baked tarmac
of Hanoi's Noi Bai Airport, said Mai. Dan
Trout.
It was among the largest turnovers
since the January 1973 Paris Peace Ac
cords ended U.S. military involvement in
the war, in which 58,000 Americans died
before the communists defeated the U.S.-
backed South Vietnam government.

The caskets were flown out of the Viet
namese capital en route to Honolulu,
where the U.S. Central Identification Lab
oratory will try to confirm preliminary
analyses by the Vietnamese.
Trout, press representative for the U.S.
Pacific Command, said Vietnam provided
a list of some names and information on
the remains, but he had no other details.
Sources said earlier that Vietnam has
given the United States at least nine
names.
Trout said among the remains are
those of 21 troops the Vietnamese found
in their own searches and two soldiers
recovered during the first joint field in
vestigation near Hanoi Sept. 25-Oct. 5.
Another American military team re-

turned to Bangkok yesterday after com
pleting the second joint field investigation
with the Vietnamese to determine what
happened to U.S. airmen lost in northern
Vietnam.
Trout said since the Paris accords, the
United States has received the identified
remains of 196 missing people, including
168 from Vietnam, 26 from Laos and
two from China. That leaves 2,387 Amer
icans missing in action in Vietnam, Laos
and Cambodia.
In August 1987, Vietnam's Foreign
Minister Nguyen Co Thach and a special
U.S. presidential envoy, retired Gen. John
Vessey, agreed to hasten cooperation on
the issue.
Thursday's turnover brought to 90 the

number of suspected remains Vietnam
has provided since then. From them, the
U.S. laboratory so far has identified 25
missing Americans.
Seven U.S. military specialists re
turned to Bangkok after the joint field
investigation during which they inspected
U.S. warplane crash sites and other areas
near Hanoi, Trout said.
"They did not find any specific remains
this time," he said.
During the 10-day project, two joint
teams searched areas, many of them
mountainous, in Son La, Ha Son Binh
and Hai Hung provinces.
As with the first joint investigation,
they were trying to resolve some of the
70 compelling "discrepancy cases" where

the United States says there is evidence
that Vietnamese authorities should have
information, including on airmen who
were captured but never returned.
Most American losses in northern Viet
nam were airmen shot down during
bombing runs.
Thach previously gave Americans until
the end of November to complete such
investigations and repeated hopes the
United States will provide more help in
resolving Vietnam's own humanitarian
problems. Hanoi is eager for development
aid from Washington.
U.S. officials say they hope the joint
projects will break down some of the deep
mistrust that has marked dealings on
the issue for many years.
