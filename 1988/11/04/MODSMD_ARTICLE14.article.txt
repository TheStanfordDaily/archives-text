Racists incite brawl on 'Geraldo'
NEW YORK (AP) — Geraldo Rivera's nose
was broken when a brawl erupted on the set of
his talk show yesterday during taping of an in
terview with young white supremacists and black
civil rights activist Roy Innis.
Several chairs and punches were thrown during
the minute-long melee involving neo-Nazi "skin
heads" from the audience, crew members and
security personnel for both the studio and guests'
extreme right-wing organizations.
Rivera was hit in the head by a flying chair,
then got into a toe-to-toe fistfight with the burly
man who had thrown it. At some point, another
chair hit him in the nose, he said.
"It's broken. It clicks when I move it," Rivera
said afterward.
Studio security helped restore order as Rivera,
the bridge of his nose bloodied, called for calm.
The show, which was being taped for airing at
an undetermined date later this month, resumed
after the skinheads and other white supremacists
were escorted out of the studio.
"I've been in plenty of scrapes before, but never
in a studio," he added. "I never expected this. I
anticipated heated words, but I didn't know it
would boil into violence."
The brawl broke out when one of the guests
on the show, John Metzger, the 20-year-old leader

of the ultraright-wing group White Aryan Resis
tance Youth in Los Angeles, Calif., complained
about "kikes" and called Innis an "Uncle Tom."
Students, police clash in S. Korea
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Thousands of
students demanding the arrest of former Presi
dent Chun Doo-hwan clashed with riot police
yesterday in one of the worst street protests in
recent months.
President Roh Tae-woo, on an overseas trip,
said he was not troubled and hoped political
turmoil in his country would end "in the not
too-distant future."
"I am not much worried about the student
protests. Their complaints will eventually disap
pear in a huge melting furnace of democratic
political reforms," Roh told reporters aboard a
plane which took him to Malaysia, Australia,
Indonesia and Brunei.
Police said more than 20,000 students from 80
colleges took part in anti-Chun campus rallies or
street protests in Seoul and a dozen provincial
cities yesterday, national students' day. They ac
cused the former president of corruption and
violating human rights.
About 50 students were arrested, mostly in
Seoul, said police.
