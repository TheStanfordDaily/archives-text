## Love those labels 
### 
Dukakis had the chance
to show that liberalism
should not be frightening

WIMP, EGGHEAD, deist,
bachelor ... liberal.
From Thomas Jefferson,
"the deist," to Michael Dukakis
"the liberal," labels have been an
inescapable part of presidential
elections.
This year, the unpopular liberal
label could have been transformed
into a big selling point for the
Democratic ticket.
Instead, Dukakis shrunk from
challenging George Bush's scare
tactics and in so doing, dug his
own grave.
From day one, Dukakis could
have educated Americans by
embracing a label that should not
frighten away voters.
Instead, for months Dukakis
avoided defining himself with the
dreaded "L-word." By not taking
on a specific identity that voters
could relate to, Dukakis was partly
responsible for his nose dive in the
polls.
Then, with only nine days to go
in the campaign, Dukakis finally
proclaimed himself a liberal. But
the move came too late and ironi
cally looked to some like a desper
ate attempt to regain votes.
Freedom, tolerance and the
protection of the rights of every
citizen are liberal principles that
U.S. citizens should certainly take
pride in.
Dukakis could have learned a
lessan or two from Jesse Jackson
— a politician not afraid to hit on
specifics and define what
liberalism means to him. Last Fri
day, Jackson told Stanford students

"I am a progressive liberal and
proud about it."
By hitting on specific issues —
such as the desegregation of
schools and the civil rights move
ment — Jackson showed that
liberalism can stand for the type
of progress every citizen should
hope to see.
Outraged by Bush's continual at
tack on the the word liberal, 68
prominent academics, writers and
politicians — including University
President Donald Kennedy and
four other respected Stanford pro
fessors — decided to take action.
Last week, they purchased a full
page ad in The New York Times
that turns the tables on Bush's
attack.
The ad begins, "We are American
citizens who wish to reaffirm
America's liberal tradition." And
the ad rightly points out that "At
our country's founding, the spirit
of liberalism suffused the Revolu
tion, the Declaration of Indepen
dence, the Constitution and the
Bill of Rights."
If earlier on, Dukakis had given
meaning to the word liberalism as
The Times ad does he would have
been a more appealing candidate.
Political labels are constantly
changing. For instance, back in the
19th century the word liberal was
used to describe laissez-faire eco
nomics, a policy more closely as
sociated with Republicans today.
And terms such as liberalism and
conservative are often arbitrary.
Such labels should not be the de
ciding factor when it comes time
to cast the ballot.
Candidates need to challenge un
fair connotations of labels, hit on
issues and define themselves.
If Dukakis had only gone on the
offensive, he could have earned
more respect. And maybe voters
would have seen less mudslinging
and more substance.
