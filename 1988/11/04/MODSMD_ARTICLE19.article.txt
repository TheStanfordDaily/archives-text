## Jackson/Doe in 1992? 
### 
JESSE JACKSON, in his address in
White Plaza one week ago, injected
a mouthful of rhetoric quite unre
lated to the fortunes of Mike Dukakis
and Lloyd Bentsen. Did you catch it?
He waxed eloquent about John F. Ken
nedy, who, before his 1960 election and
eventual apotheosis, tried and failed to
win his party's nomination for vice
president on the 1956 Stevenson ticket.
This analogy had nothing whatever to
do with the 1988 Dukakis/Bentsen ticket.
It had plenty to do with the 1992 Jack
son/Doe ticket. Jackson felt his loss of
the late-sought VP spot may lead him,
as a similar loss led JFK, to the
presidency four years later. Jesse, You're
No Jack Kennedy.
Why'd he say it? Now that it seems
clear that Dukakis will lose on Tuesday,
Jackson can politely make it equally clear
that he plans to run in '92. Such a
surprise. . .
Political Junkies Only Dept.: Six
months ago I registered as a Republican
for the California primary, solely to vote
against our thick-headed Congressional
incumbent, Ernest Leslie Konnyu, in the
June primary. I figured that a Democrat
didn't have a chance in this, the ger
rymandered 12th district; so as a think
ing Democrat I had to support the
moderate Stanford Law Professor, Tom
Campbell. At the time, I figured the
choice was either Tom or Ernie.
I was wrong on one count. Clearly,
judging by the feisty battle that Demo
cratic candidate Anna Eshoo has waged
against Tom Campbell, she would have
blown old Ernie right out of his sty if

he'd won his primary. Eshoo: Nothing
to be sneezed at.
But on another count I proved right.
I suspected back then that Campbell's
federal experience, education, and well
thought-out centrism made him the best
qualified candidate of any party. That he
is.
Anna Eshoo's campaign has, if nothing
else, made believers out of Democratic
apparatchiks that someday, perhaps after
the 1990 redrawing of district bound
aries, someday, this area just may send
a Democrat to the House. She also sent
women, but not men, free potholders (a
gag, meant to imply that Campbell was
insensitive to women's issues, which
boomeranged embarrassingly and justly
by making her seem the sexist); she at
tacked teachers (like Campbell) as not
having relevant, real-life experiences; and
she sent out 110,000 talking-head cam
paign videos of herself, while Campbell
instead spoke and listened at scores of
town hall meetings.
Anna, some free advice: after your kids
have gone off to college, move a few miles
north into the 11th district and await
the retirement of its current representa
tive, Tom Lantos (D-Burlingame). Since
you're a San Mateo County Supervisor,
and since that county is predominantly
located in the 11th, this strategy makes
geographic sense. Moreover, as you will
see on Tuesday, it makes political sense
as well.
And I still want my potholder. ..
Four-panel Politics Dept.: Readers
have grown to love Berke Breathed's
Bloom County and to love hating Garry

Trudeau's Doonesbury over the years.
Make way, boys: in the past two weeks
a heretofore cutesy, "slice of life"-style
strip, Cathy Guisewite's Cathy, has joined
the ranks of The Political. One character
in the strip, a single mother through
whom Guisewite speaks, castigates Bush
and praises Dukakis by name for their
daycare and maternal leave policies.
Speaking of comic strips, Walt Kelly's
Pogo will soon return. Pogo, arguably
the best strip ever, pioneered the field
of strip politics by lampooning red-baiter
Sen. Joe McCarthy back in the early 50's;
before his death in 1973, Kelly would
draw potent attacks on the Nixon/Agnew
White House and decry the growing
tragedy of pollution as no words could.
The marsupial namesake of the strip even
ran for President a time or four; if he
were running this time, who among us
would not Go Pogo? Watdi for the return
of the poignant 'possum, coming in Feb
ruary to an Okefenokee near you . . .
Final Predictions: Bush over Dukakis,
438 electoral votes to 100; Wilson over
McCarthy, 54% to 46%; Campbell over
Eshoo, 55% to 45%. And Cincinnati over
Pittsburgh, 38-20.
