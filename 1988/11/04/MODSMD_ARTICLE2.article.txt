# TAs may face salary cutbacks
## Humanities and Sciences attempts to get budget under control

Student teaching assistants through
out the School of Humanities and
Sciences may face salary cuts this year
as the result of a budget squeeze that
is already being felt in the Political Sci
ence Department.
Cuts in TA funding of between 6 and
14 percent have been mandated for each
department in the school, Humanities
and Sciences officials said yesterday. It

Prof. David Brady confirmed that some
TAs in his department are already re

No TAs who may be affected were
available for comment last night.
The cuts come in the wake of charges
by some Humanities and Sciences pro
fessors last year that there are not
enough TAs to go around.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Ewart Thomas, in his first year at the
post, ascribed the budget cuts to two
factors: sloppy budgeting in past years,
and shifts in the number of students

enrolled in different departments.
"The rational thing to do is . . . take
money away from departments with
declining enrollment and give it to de
partments with increasing enrollment,"
he said. "Another motivation," Thomas
added, "was to see if we could reduce
the expense of TA's."
Last year the cost of TA salaries in
Humanities and Sciences exceeded the
budget by $650,000, according to
Padgett.
In fact, the departments apparently
paid little heed to the budget set by
Humanities and Sciences. "Departments
with declining enrollments would not
give up TA's," Thomas said. "It's always
