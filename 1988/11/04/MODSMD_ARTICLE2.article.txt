# TAs may face salary cutbacks
## Humanities and Sciences attempts to get budget under control 
### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
Student teaching assistants through
out the School of Humanities and
Sciences may face salary cuts this year
as the result of a budget squeeze that
is already being felt in the Political Sci
ence Department.
Cuts in TA funding of between 6 and
14 percent have been mandated for each
department in the school, Humanities
and Sciences officials said yesterday. It
remains unclear how those cuts will af
fect individual TAs, but Political Science
Prof. David Brady confirmed that some
TAs in his department are already re
ceiving less money than they did last
year.

One department chair, History Prof.
James Sheehan, said the cuts won't af
fect TAs in that department, who are
on special four-year fellowships.
Individual departments will deter
mine how the cutbacks are dealt with,
said Nancy Padgett, a finance official
from Humanities and Sciences.
No TAs who may be affected were
available for comment last night.
The cuts come in the wake of charges
by some Humanities and Sciences pro
fessors last year that there are not
enough TAs to go around.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Ewart Thomas, in his first year at the
post, ascribed the budget cuts to two
factors: sloppy budgeting in past years,
and shifts in the number of students

enrolled in different departments.
"The rational thing to do is . . . take
money away from departments with
declining enrollment and give it to de
partments with increasing enrollment,"
he said. "Another motivation," Thomas
added, "was to see if we could reduce
the expense of TA's."
Last year the cost of TA salaries in
Humanities and Sciences exceeded the
budget by $650,000, according to
Padgett.
In fact, the departments apparently
paid little heed to the budget set by
Humanities and Sciences. "Departments
with declining enrollments would not
give up TA's," Thomas said. "It's always
hard to take money away from a
department ... so the budget
tends to inflate."
Cutting the inflated TA budgets
is only part of a larger effort,
according to Padgett. "We're
trying to establish equity . . . and
balance our budget," she said.
"We're in a three year process of
bringing income and expenses in
line."
In July, Thomas sent a letter
to individual departments that

outlined his plan for controlling
TA budget increases and notified
each department of its new TA
allocation for this year.
The bottom line for TAs is that
they will either be teaching more
students on the same salary, or
facing a salary cut if the number
of students stays the same.
Complicating the salary issue
is the financial aid that is offered
to some TAs in the form of grad
uate student stipends. In the past,
the line between "TA salary" and
"financial aid" has blurred. The
office of Graduate Awards funds
the stipends, while Humanities
and Sciences foots the bill for the

salaries.
Before the salary redistribu
tion, "there were too many sec
tions out there that were too
small," Padgett said. "This is an
effort to say to departments that
having very small sections was
not fair."
Humanities and Sciences sec
tions should have an average of
30 to 35 students, Padgett said.
She added that "there is a lot of
variation in those numbers" and
that there are exceptions, such as
English, Western Culture and lan
guage discussion groups.
The Political Science Depart
ment has hired the same number

of TAs this year as it has in the
past, according to Brady. "In some
cases, pay is lower this year than
it was last," he said.
He pointed out that cuts have
not been drastic because the de
partment had promised to rehire
many previous TAs at their
original pay level. He predicted
that TA salaries might have to be
reduced by up to 20 percent next
year.
"We will look into the effects
(of lower salaries) on morale and
quality of teaching," Brady said.
The department will use student
surveys to analyze how strong its
sections are this year, he added.

small," Padgett said. "This is an
effort to say to departments that
having very small sections was
not fair."
Humanities and Sciences sec
tions should have an average of
30 to 35 students, Padgett said.
She added that "there is a lot of
variation in those numbers" and
that there are exceptions, such as
English, Western Culture and lan
guage discussion groups.
The Political Science Depart
ment has hired the same number

of TAs this year as it has in the
past, according to Brady. "In some
cases, pay is lower this year than
it was last," he said.
He pointed out that cuts have
not been drastic because the de
partment had promised to rehire
many previous TAs at their
original pay level. He predicted
that TA salaries might have to be
reduced by up to 20 percent next
year.
"We will look into the effects
(of lower salaries) on morale and
quality of teaching," Brady said.
The department will use student
surveys to analyze how strong its
sections are this year, he added.
