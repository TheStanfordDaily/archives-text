## Women's Center most likely serves solid majority 
### 
I WAS RATHER BEMUSED by
Jennifer Bryson's letter of Nov. 2
("The Stanford Women's Center
should not be political"). I'd prefer to
think that you're in something of a
muddle on the issues, Jennifer, so I'd
like to work through your letter and
try to point out the rough spots.
I don't profess to know much about
the Women's Center and its stated
purpose, but any such service organiza
tion can only hope to minister to a
solid majority. Attempts to meet the
criteria of all groups in all activities
would make any activity impossible.
As far as applying pro-choice
doctrines to infants, you must be
aware that there is a long and

cherished tradition of denying most
rights and choices to the young: Con
servatives refer to this as "strong
family values."
A minor linguistic caveat here as
well: "infant" is used to refer to those
who have already been delivered. An
infant would have no choice in its
infanticide, but we're talking about
abortion here. The word you want is
fetus.
In reference to "the most basic right
of a woman," I certainly agree that it
is the right to life. .1 think nearly all
feminists are probably in agreement
here as well. However, I don't think
that they view life as a true or false

question — considerations of quality of
life are part of a pro-choice stance, as I
understand it.
1 doubt anyone at the Women's
Center is advocating "a right to have
abortions if they choose to have sexual
intercourse but do not want to be
pregnant." Some people don't
choose . . . and I don't see how anyone
in a community with condom dis
pensers and cheap gynecological serv
ices would choose to use abortion as a
form of birth control.
And now my final point of sub
stance: I am biologically male — social
ly, too, actually — and I must tell you
that I do not have any "right. . . not

to be pregnant." What I have is a
downright inability to be pregnant. You
might want to refer to the informative
discussion of this topic by the People's
Front of Judea. For that matter,
Monty Python also has some fine
song-and-dance material bearing di
rectly on the right-to-life issues, but I
digress. ...
And one word of stylistic advice: if
someone incorrectly states that you
were arrested, you should be grateful.
That is what Operation Rescue does.
Insisting that you weren't arrested
makes you look like a bit of a
lightweight.
