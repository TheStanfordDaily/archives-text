## Canadian Free Trade Act faces psychological barriers 
### 
AS THE U.S. ELECTION ap
proaches, it is perhaps unfortunate
that many of us will be unaware
of another election in November, one
whose ramifications for the western
world could be as crucial as the Bush-
Dukakis contest.
Just across the border in Canada,
Prime Minister Mulroney is fighting an
extremely close battle at the polls with
the chief opposition candidate John
Turner. It is not so much the election
itself as its timing which is so pivotal,
coming as it does before the Free Trade
Act between the United States and
Canada can be formally approved by the
Canadian legislature.
In the eyes of the ruling party, the act
offers Canada the chance not only to
safeguard its trade with the United

States, but also to expand it and thereby
the national economy. To the opposition
parties, the act is the equivalent of hang
ing a FOR SALE sign on the Parliament
Building in Ottowa.
In essence, the contest has been trans
formed into a referendum, a test of the
Canadian people's willingness to accept
the most vital piece of economic legisla
ture in their history.
Yet in Canada the issue could well be
decided by psychology and not facts or
figures. The Canadians are a people
whose national identity is based on the
never-ending quest for one. Unfortunate
ly, this often leads to a blindly compulsive
attempt to see themselves as opposed to
the "big brother" next door.
Most Canadians lie somewhere in the
middle of the nationalistic spectrum, a

factor in their make-up which could well
close a door whose very existence is in
question.
With the long-term econmic prospects
(our trade and budget deficits) looking
as grim as they do, this may be the only
chance left for both sides to muster
enough courage. ,
Throughout the world, free trade is
poised on the edge of assuming its proper
status in international economics as
never before. Many Third World and com
munist countries are just beginning to
loosen their grips on their respective
economies. In Europe, the effort to make
the EEC a truly united free trade com
munity by 1992 is gaining momentum.
These cautious, exploratory ventures
could well be accelerated or quashed by
the signals which Canada sends out. After

all, if a country as rich, friendly and
culturally similar as Canada is to the
United States rejects this act, how could
we not expect other countries to do the
same?
What is needed in Canada is a leap of
faith and the courage to believe that im
port penetration isn't necessarily the poor
cousin of military invasion. If Canadians
and Americans can overcome the psycho
logical barriers which promulgate this
view, the Free Trade Act could well be
come a significant step towards a united
world.
Such a step is truly pivotal and exciting;
so for those who find exactly these
qualities missing in our national elec
tion ... look north this November.
