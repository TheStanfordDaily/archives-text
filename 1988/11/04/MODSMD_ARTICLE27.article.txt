## Rightin' reviews 
### 
The following are excerpts
from the soon-to-be-published
"How To Become a Professional
Critic," available next summer
from Fullcourt Press:
Chapter 3: MOVIES
Movies have a long and
glorious history in the United
States, particularly if you don't
count "Howard the Duck."
The very first movie was
made in 1893. Titled "Journey
to the Moon," it showed a
crudely designed spaceship trav
eling through space to land on
the moon. The second movie
was made six months later,
titled "Police Academy 4."
Although it is recommended
that you attend a movie before
you review it, this is not abso
lutely crucial. For instance,
there are certain phrases you
will see on movie posters that
can tip you off to the fact that
a movie will be terrible.
Some of these phrases in
clude: "The Return of ..
".. .Part IV," "It Came From
. . ~" "Invasion of the . .
". . .starring Meryl Streep,"
"Nominated for Best Foreign
Film," and "Escape To Witch
Mountain."
However, if you do actually
have to go see a movie, you must
choose your words very carefully
when writing the review. For
example, if your review says:
"Sitting through 'Godzilla vs.
Meryl Streep' was so agoniz
ingly boring that I wanted to
take a powerful shotgun and,
moving stealthily, sneak intQ the
director's house and shoot him
to death. ..."
the ad in the newspaper the next
day will say:
"POWERFUL ... MOVING."
Thus, the only effective solu
tion is to write all your movie
reviews as if you were Tarzan:
"Movie bad. Acting bad.
Directing odious. Characters
shallow. Script incompre
hensible. Cinematography
murky. Cheetah go, fetch pop
corn. Me Siskel, you Ebert."

Chapter 7: CLASSICAL MUSIC
The key to writing about clas
sical music is to remember that
it is modern society's most dig
nified art form, meaning that
there are no more than six
people in any audience who un
derstand the music.
Because of this, members are
required to say a secret oath
before they join an orchestra,
an oath that dates back to the
days of Mozart: "Le roi est mort
vive le roi c'est la vie n'est que
le premier pas qui coute"
(Translation: "We promise to
uphold the quality of the music,
despite the fact that we could
play the theme from 'Star Trek'
and the audience wouldn't know
the difference.")
Let's now look at an example
of an actual symphony review
to see how the talented writer
can bring an evening of music
to life, similar to how Michael
Jackson brings all those zombies
to life in his "Thriller" video,
only with less dancing:
The Lichtenstein Symphony
Orchestra's premier perform
ance last night demonstrated
their talent for crisp and flaw
less interpretation of music.
They managed to play with a
level ofje ne sais quoi and savoir
faire, while still maintaining a
flavor of jacques cousteau and
a side-order of crepes suzette.
The evening began with Bee
thoven's lean and powerful
"Symphony in D Minor, Op. 10,
No. 13, W-10, L-5, ERA 2.57."
Next, they made a surprising

sequel to Stroganoffs "Fugue
for Harmonica and Bobby
McFerrin," a short and sensual
piece that guided the audience
enraptured into the intermis
sion.
After the intermission, the
LSO returned to execute a mov
ing performance of Hymen's
playful and witty "Minuet in
Watercolors and Oil on Glass."
A medley followed, which in
cluded the bold and brazen
"Minuet in G Minor," the pas
sionate and sinewy "Waltz of
the Living Dead," and the full
figured and buxom "Variations
on a toccata con mucho an
tipasto."
This concluded their planned
set, but a rousing call for an
encore from the audience
brought them back for a virtuoso
playing of Olde McDonald's
"Symphony in EIEIO." During
this piece the conductor main
tained such brilliant control over
the orchestra as to allow an
"oink oink" here and an "oink
oink" there, while still keeping
the players together as a unit
so as to avoid letting there be
everywhere an "oink oink."

This concluded their planned
set, but a rousing call for an
encore from the audience
brought them back for a virtuoso
playing of Olde McDonald's
"Symphony in EIEIO." During
this piece the conductor main
tained such brilliant control over
the orchestra as to allow an
"oink oink" here and an "oink
oink" there, while still keeping
the players together as a unit
so as to avoid letting there be
everywhere an "oink oink."

The following are excerpts
from the soon-to-be-published
"How To Become a Professional
Critic," available next summer
from Fullcourt Press:
Chapter 3: MOVIES
Movies have a long and
glorious history in the United
States, particularly if you don't
count "Howard the Duck."
The very first movie was
made in 1893. Titled "Journey
to the Moon," it showed a
crudely designed spaceship trav
eling through space to land on
the moon. The second movie
was made six months later,
titled "Police Academy 4."
Although it is recommended
that you attend a movie before
you review it, this is not abso
lutely crucial. For instance,
there are certain phrases you
will see on movie posters that
can tip you off to the fact that
a movie will be terrible.
Some of these phrases in
clude: "The Return of ..
".. .Part IV," "It Came From
. . ~" "Invasion of the . .
". . .starring Meryl Streep,"
"Nominated for Best Foreign
Film," and "Escape To Witch
Mountain."
However, if you do actually
have to go see a movie, you must
choose your words very carefully
when writing the review. For
example, if your review says:
"Sitting through 'Godzilla vs.
Meryl Streep' was so agoniz
ingly boring that I wanted to
take a powerful shotgun and,
moving stealthily, sneak intQ the
director's house and shoot him
to death. ..."
the ad in the newspaper the next
day will say:
"POWERFUL ... MOVING."
Thus, the only effective solu
tion is to write all your movie
reviews as if you were Tarzan:
"Movie bad. Acting bad.
Directing odious. Characters
shallow. Script incompre
hensible. Cinematography
murky. Cheetah go, fetch pop
corn. Me Siskel, you Ebert."

Chapter 7: CLASSICAL MUSIC
The key to writing about clas
sical music is to remember that
it is modern society's most dig
nified art form, meaning that
there are no more than six
people in any audience who un
derstand the music.
Because of this, members are
required to say a secret oath
before they join an orchestra,
an oath that dates back to the
days of Mozart: "Le roi est mort
vive le roi c'est la vie n'est que
le premier pas qui coute"
(Translation: "We promise to
uphold the quality of the music,
despite the fact that we could
play the theme from 'Star Trek'
and the audience wouldn't know
the difference.")
Let's now look at an example
of an actual symphony review
to see how the talented writer
can bring an evening of music
to life, similar to how Michael
Jackson brings all those zombies
to life in his "Thriller" video,
only with less dancing:
The Lichtenstein Symphony
Orchestra's premier perform
ance last night demonstrated
their talent for crisp and flaw
less interpretation of music.
They managed to play with a
level ofje ne sais quoi and savoir
faire, while still maintaining a
flavor of jacques cousteau and
a side-order of crepes suzette.
The evening began with Bee
thoven's lean and powerful
"Symphony in D Minor, Op. 10,
No. 13, W-10, L-5, ERA 2.57."
Next, they made a surprising

sequel to Stroganoffs "Fugue
for Harmonica and Bobby
McFerrin," a short and sensual
piece that guided the audience
enraptured into the intermis
sion.
After the intermission, the
LSO returned to execute a mov
ing performance of Hymen's
playful and witty "Minuet in
Watercolors and Oil on Glass."
A medley followed, which in
cluded the bold and brazen
"Minuet in G Minor," the pas
sionate and sinewy "Waltz of
the Living Dead," and the full
figured and buxom "Variations
on a toccata con mucho an
tipasto."
This concluded their planned
set, but a rousing call for an
encore from the audience
brought them back for a virtuoso
playing of Olde McDonald's
"Symphony in EIEIO." During
this piece the conductor main
tained such brilliant control over
the orchestra as to allow an
"oink oink" here and an "oink
oink" there, while still keeping
the players together as a unit
so as to avoid letting there be
everywhere an "oink oink."
