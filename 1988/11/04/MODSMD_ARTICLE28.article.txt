## MOVIES Woody Allen gets way too serious 
### Christopher Barbour 
The good news is that Woody
Allen's new film is terribly fun
ny. The bad news is that it's
not supposed to be.
"Another Woman" is Allen's
third painfully laughable stab
at "serious drama." Here again,
like in "Interiors" and last
year's "September," Allen tries
to create art — guess he doesn't
realize he's already done so with
"Hannah and Her Sisters" —
and in the process ruins an
otherwise intriguing premise.
Marion (Gena Rowlands) is a
hyper-learned, hyper-pathetic
philosophy professor who sub
lets an apartment in Manhattan

so she can have peace while
writing a book. However, a qi'irk
in the architecture of the buiid
ing allows her to overhear the
psychiatric therapy sessions of
Hope (Mia Farrow, who in this
role moves one stop closer to
becoming Woody Allen).
Marion becomes fascinated
with Hope's confessions, a fas
cination which leads Marion to
examine her own life.
What does she find? Basically
that she has alienated her
friends and family, married the
wrong guy, and is a hyper
learned and hyper-pathetic phi
losophy professor.
Allen makes sure no one
misses any of these revelations.

Marion tells it to us once and,
in a startlingly silly dream se
quence, everybody else tells us
again. And to bring it all home,
Allen spares no expense on the
hackneyed emotional expres
sions.
Oh, did I mention the sym
bolism? As we all know, art
needs symbols, and Allen jams
in a whole bunch.
One supposes that Woody
needs to get this stuff out of
his system once in a while. We
can only hope that it's all out
by now.

"Another Woman" opens today
at the Aquarius Theater in Palo
Alto.
