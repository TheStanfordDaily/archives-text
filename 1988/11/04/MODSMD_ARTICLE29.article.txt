# Eastwood's 'Bird' dips and soars
## 
### Eric Grunwald Staff writer 
Get ready for a Clint
Eastwood you've never seen. No
more Dirty Harry. No "Man
With No Name." This time
Clint's behind the camera, and
his work is good.
"Bird," produced and directed
by Eastwood, is the sad story
of jazz man Charlie "Bird"
Parker — given the nickname
because when he played the
saxophone, he soared.
Bird's story is sad because un
fortunately he soared off the
stage as well as on it; the film
should get the 1988 Nancy
Reagan Film Award for its
strong anti-drug message.
Parker's tragedy is portrayed
superbly by Forest Whitaker
(Robin Williams' chubby pal in
"Good Morning Vietnam"), and
Diane Venora is excellent as his
tough and loyal wife Chan.
The jazzy atmosphere of mid
century Kansas City is recreated
in fine style by Eastwood, and
combined with the acting,
brings Charlie Parker alive on
the screen. This is not a glitzy,
"Cotton Club" showcase, how
ever, and what makes the film
moving is that everything — the
characters, sets and pace — are
so down-to-earth and real.
Parker's music, dubbed well
into the soundtrack, is as much
a part of the movie as his char
acter, and jazz connoisseurs will

appreciate the film all the more
for it.
The film does have its flaws,
however. It's over two and a
half hours long, and the action
is fairly slow. Also, Eastwood's
direction at times seems forced
and sloppy, and the frequently
terrific acting often gets
misplaced in awkward scenes.
The pace of "Bird" is often
disjointed, and the time and

place of the action is often un
clear.
But ultimately "Bird" is the
story of a man whose family,
great talent and eventually his
life are lost to needles and
bottles, and in conveying that
tragedy, Clint hits his target.

"Bird" opens today at the
Aquarius Theater in Palo Alto.
