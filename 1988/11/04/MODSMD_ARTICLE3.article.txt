# Touted Next computer visits campus
## 
### Jock Friedly Staff writer 
The celebrated Next computer played
the Bach Concerto #1 in A minor to
an overflow crowd in Terman Audito
rium Wednesday evening in the first
public demonstration of the computer
on campus.
The computer was used to show off
a software package called Mathematica
by Stephan Wolfram, professor of com
puter science, mathematics and physics
at the University of Illinois. Wolfram
founded his own software company,
Wolfram Research, Inc.
About 375 people crowded Terman

and overflow rooms as Wolfram spoke
about Mathematica, a program that is
able to manipulate and solve complex
mathematical functions and equations.
A computer virus that Wolfram had
picked up through his computer earlier
that day destroyed the program and
threatened to prevent the demonstra
tion of his program on a Macintosh
computer.
The Next computer has drawn much
publicity from around the nation as
computer enthusiasts and educators
have marveled at its extensive list of
features. The company was formed by
Steve Jobs, one of the wizards of the
computer world and a co-founder of Ap

pie Computer. Jobs left Apple amidst a
storm of controversy and went on to
form Next.
Stanford has invested $3 million in
Next, giving the University approxi
mately 2 percent ownership in the com
pany.
After Wolfram finished his lecture on
the software, Gregor BaiJar, a Next com
puter press representative, gave a
"casual walk through the Next comput
er." Three weeks ago the Next computer
was unveiled in a gala affair at the
Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco.
The sleek Next computer offers many
features unavailable in other sys
tems. Bailar demonstrated the
machine's unique sound synthesis
capabilities. The computer uses a
system developed for the company
by Stanford'B Center for Com
puter Research in Music and
Acoustics.
The computer's unique optical
disks can store more than 300
times the amount that Macintosh
disks hold, and each Next com
puter comes with an unabridged
version of Webster's 9th Col
legiate Dictionary.
