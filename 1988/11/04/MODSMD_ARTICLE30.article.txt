# At the movies: U2 up for Oscar?
## 
### Gene Anaya Staff writer 
What would you give for front
row seats and backstage passes to
a U2 concert? Your left arm? Your
first-born son? Well, you don't
have to go quite that far because
these things (the seats and passes,
not the arm and first-born son)
are what the new movie "U2
Rattle And Hum" has to offer.
This concert-documentary
movie of the world's most popular
band preserves the quality and
intensity of U2's live perform
ances from the 1987 "Joshua Tree
Tour." Filmed almost entirely in
black and white "U2 Rattle And
Hum" presents U2 in a raw un
adultered form, giving the viewer
excellent close-up shots of the in
dividual band members doing
what they do best, making great
music.
Every song on the "Rattle And
Hum" album is performed in the
movie, though sometimes in dif
ferent versions. For instance,
"Desire," their first release from
the "Rattle and Hum" album, is

played with significant differences
in the film.
"U2 Rattle And Hum" also in
cludes several live versions of
songs that are not found on the
soundtrack album, such as their
No. 1 hit "With or Without You,"
"Where the Streets Have No
Name" and the most powerful
rendition of "Sunday, Bloody Sun
day" ever heard.
There is also footage of U2's
free appearance at Embarcadero
Plaza in San Francisco during
which Bono spray-painted the
words "Rock and Roll Stops the
traffic!" on that big, ugly concrete
sculpture.
This segment includes back
stage scenes of Bono practicing
the lyrics before going on stage
(a large flatbed truck) to perform
Jimi Hendrix's "All Along the
Watch tower."
Through "U2 Rattle And Hum"
we see such things as the band
recording "Angel of Harlem"
(with a miscue by Larry Mullen
Jr. on drums) in Sun Studio,
where Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis
recorded; and U2 with one of their

music idols, 8.8. King, practicing
"When Love Comes to Town," a
song written by Bono for King.
"Some people feel that music
and politics shouldn't be mixed
... but that's bullshit!" says bas
sist Adam Clayton in the movie,
and political views are intertwined
with most of U2's music.
The entire movie is not just con
cert footage. It also includes ex
cerpts from interviews with the
band as a whole and with the
members individually. These in
terviews explain the context in
which the songs were written or
performed and bring an added di
mension to the music of U2.
As the closing credits roll up
the screen to the strains of "All
I Want is You" playing in the
background, you feel that you
have caught a glimpse of what
U2 is: a group of four musicians,
four artists, four men who have
something to say and who do so
in a manner that leaves you wan
ting more.
