## Card clashes with Cougars in home finale High-flying WSU visits the Farm tomorrow 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Things are just not the same
in the Pacific 10 Conference.
The league used to be simple.
UCLA and USC would beat every
body, Washington would beat
everybody else and the rest of the
conference would fight it out
amongst themselves for fourth
through tenth.
When Stanford would play
Washington State late in the
season, there would sometimes be
bowl implications. But when the
two teams meet in Stanford Sta
dium at 1:00 p.m. tomorrow, it
is the Cougars who have a shot
at a bowl game instead of the
Cardinal.
Washington State comes in 5-3
overall, 2-3 in league, after knock
ing UCLA out of the No. 1 spot
in the national polls with a 34-30
upset last Saturday. Stanford, 3-
4-1 overall, 1-3-1 in Pac-10 action,
is no longer fighting for a bowl
bid and is simply striving for a
.500, or a winning, season.
In facing WSU, however, Stan
ford is meeting the nation's
leading passer in Timm Rosen
bach. "Their quarterback is doing
an excellent job for them," Stan
ford Coach Jack Elway said.
"They have a lot of balance [on
offense]."
Rosenbach, in addition to
leading the nation in passing ef
ficiency, is third in the country
(first in the Pac-10) in total of
fense, averaging 302 yards per
game. He has thrown 20 touch
down passes in eight games and
has run for seven additional
scores.
Rosenbach completed 16 of 25
passes for 272 yards against the
Bruins, including two touch
downs, and had no interceptions.
Rosenbach also ran for 49 yards.
He has thrown at least two touch

downs in each of the Cougars'
last seven games, and has ac
counted for at least three scores
in seven of eight games this
season.
He needs only 681 yards of total
offense in his last three contests
to break John Elway's single
season Pac-10 mark.
Rosenbach is complemented
nicely this season by a rushing
attack. Although Steve Broussard,
the Pac-10 leader in rushing at
133 yards per game, will probably
not play tomorrow due to an in
jury, his backup, Rich Swinton,
has done very well. Swinton ran
for 117 yards in the upset over
the Bruins and recorded 193 yards
the week before against Arizona
State.
Despite having started only
twice, Swinton is averaging 74
yards a game, sixth in the league.
"Richie's come in and played
two great games for us," Cougar
Coach Dennis Erickson said.

Timm Rosenbach, the
nation's leading pas
ser, needs only 681
yards of total offense
in his last three con
tests to break John
Elway's single-season
Pac-10 mark.

Another player who has done
the job offensively for the nation's
third-most prolific offense (510
yards a game) is slotback Tim
Stallworth. Stallworth had seven
catches for 170 yards against
UCLA, including two scoring
plays, and was named ABC's
Player of the Game.
"Tim ... is a good receiver

who's improved a lot since last
year," Erickson said. Stall worth
is currently 17th nationally with
5.38 catches per game.
This balanced attack — 235
yards rushing, 270 passing a game
— will face a Stanford defense
that is having a good year. Led
by inside linebackers Jono Tun
ney and Kevin Richardson, the
team's top tacklers, the defense
has kept Stanford in seven of eight
games this season.
"They're a great defensive foot
ball team," Erickson said.
The Cardinal defense has given
Stanford 22 fumbles and intercep
tions, while the offense has lost
the ball only nine times, and the
Cardinal's plus 1.88 turnovers a
game leaves the squad fifth na
tionally.
Washington State's defense
hasn't been too bad either. The
Cougs have caused 17 turnovers
so far. The team does rank last
in the Pac-10 in total defense (422
yards per game), but with WSU's
high-powered offense, the defense
spends a lot of time on the field.
A more revealing statistic is
that the Cougars are averaging
plus 88 yards per game, meaning
that their defense is doing what
it needs to to win. "We were really
pleased how they played against
UCLA last week," Erickson said.
WSU's defense, "has been kind
of maligned all year and we ha
ven't really played well," accord
ing to Erickson, but the defense
is considerably better than past
Cougar defenses.
The defense will face a Stanford
offense that set a season-high in
total yards last week, however. In
addition to fullback Jon Volpe's
school-record 220 yards rushing,
Jason Palumbis threw for 220
yards and two touchdowns. And
as if that isn't bad enough, the
Cougs' defense has been hit hard
by injury. "We've got a lot of 'em,"

Erickson said. "Ivan Cook hurt
his knee. He's our best defensive
player and won't play this week."
Additionally, linebacker Keith
Rice had knee surgery Monday
and various other defenders are
playing with various injuries.
But Erickson said at least the
Cougars won't suffer a letdown
after the big win. "It's not real
different [after beating UCLA] be
cause obviously we've got a real

big game this week," he said. "The
biggest thing we want to do right
now is have a winning season."
Card notes
Stanford comes into the game in
much better physical shape than
WSU. Offensive tackle John Zentncr
it still suffering from a sore neck but
is expected to start.
Volpe also has a sore neck, but said,
"With that neck roll I had on this
week it limited my movement but it

helped in contact. ... It felt better
this week than it has the past four
weeks." Those two are the only inju
ries reported.
Two big cogs in the Cougar offense,
Stallworth and Swinton, both went to
Montrlair Prep in Van Nuys.
Montciair also pr >uucod former Stan
ford outfielder/defensive back Toi
Cook (now with the New Orleans
Saints) and current women's volleyball
player Cheryl Conly.


Jason Palumbis tosses to sophomore wide receiver Chris Walsh last week at Washington. Palumbis
was 19-of-40 on the day for 220 yards, while Walsh pulled in six passes for 75 yards and one TD,
the first of his career.

hasn't been too bad either. The
Cougs have caused 17 turnovers
so far. The team does rank last
in the Pac-10 in total defense (422
yards per game), but with WSU's
high-powered offense, the defense
spends a lot of time on the field.
A more revealing statistic is
that the Cougars are averaging
plus 88 yards per game, meaning
that their defense is doing what
it needs to to win. "We were really
pleased how they played against
UCLA last week," Erickson said.
WSU's defense, "has been kind
of maligned all year and we ha
ven't really played well," accord
ing to Erickson, but the defense
is considerably better than past
Cougar defenses.
The defense will face a Stanford
offense that set a season-high in
total yards last week, however. In
addition to fullback Jon Volpe's
school-record 220 yards rushing,
Jason Palumbis threw for 220
yards and two touchdowns. And
as if that isn't bad enough, the
Cougs' defense has been hit hard
by injury. "We've got a lot of 'em,"

Erickson said. "Ivan Cook hurt
his knee. He's our best defensive
player and won't play this week."
Additionally, linebacker Keith
Rice had knee surgery Monday
and various other defenders are
playing with various injuries.
But Erickson said at least the
Cougars won't suffer a letdown
after the big win. "It's not real
different [after beating UCLA] be
cause obviously we've got a real

big game this week," he said. "The
biggest thing we want to do right
now is have a winning season."
Card notes
Stanford comes into the game in
much better physical shape than
WSU. Offensive tackle John Zentncr
it still suffering from a sore neck but
is expected to start.
Volpe also has a sore neck, but said,
"With that neck roll I had on this
week it limited my movement but it

helped in contact. ... It felt better
this week than it has the past four
weeks." Those two are the only inju
ries reported.
Two big cogs in the Cougar offense,
Stallworth and Swinton, both went to
Montrlair Prep in Van Nuys.

Jason Palumbis tosses to sophomore wide receiver Chris Walsh last week at Washington. Palumbis
was 19-of-40 on the day for 220 yards, while Walsh pulled in six passes for 75 yards and one TD,
the first of his career.
Things are just not the same
in the Pacific 10 Conference.
The league used to be simple.
UCLA and USC would beat every
body, Washington would beat
everybody else and the rest of the
conference would fight it out
amongst themselves for fourth
through tenth.
When Stanford would play
Washington State late in the
season, there would sometimes be
bowl implications. But when the
two teams meet in Stanford Sta
dium at 1:00 p.m. tomorrow, it
is the Cougars who have a shot
at a bowl game instead of the
Cardinal.
Washington State comes in 5-3
overall, 2-3 in league, after knock
ing UCLA out of the No. 1 spot
in the national polls with a 34-30
upset last Saturday. Stanford, 3-
4-1 overall, 1-3-1 in Pac-10 action,
is no longer fighting for a bowl
bid and is simply striving for a
.500, or a winning, season.
In facing WSU, however, Stan
ford is meeting the nation's
leading passer in Timm Rosen
bach. "Their quarterback is doing
an excellent job for them," Stan
ford Coach Jack Elway said.
"They have a lot of balance [on
offense]."
Rosenbach, in addition to
leading the nation in passing ef
ficiency, is third in the country
(first in the Pac-10) in total of
fense, averaging 302 yards per
game. He has thrown 20 touch
down passes in eight games and
has run for seven additional
scores.
Rosenbach completed 16 of 25
passes for 272 yards against the
Bruins, including two touch
downs, and had no interceptions.
Rosenbach also ran for 49 yards.
He has thrown at least two touch

downs in each of the Cougars'
last seven games, and has ac
counted for at least three scores
in seven of eight games this
season.
He needs only 681 yards of total
offense in his last three contests
to break John Elway's single
season Pac-10 mark.
Rosenbach is complemented
nicely this season by a rushing
attack. Although Steve Broussard,
the Pac-10 leader in rushing at
133 yards per game, will probably
not play tomorrow due to an in
jury, his backup, Rich Swinton,
has done very well. Swinton ran
for 117 yards in the upset over
the Bruins and recorded 193 yards
the week before against Arizona
State.
Despite having started only
twice, Swinton is averaging 74
yards a game, sixth in the league.
"Richie's come in and played
two great games for us," Cougar
Coach Dennis Erickson said.

Timm Rosenbach, the
nation's leading pas
ser, needs only 681
yards of total offense
in his last three con
tests to break John
Elway's single-season
Pac-10 mark.

Another player who has done
the job offensively for the nation's
third-most prolific offense (510
yards a game) is slotback Tim
Stallworth. Stallworth had seven
catches for 170 yards against
UCLA, including two scoring
plays, and was named ABC's
Player of the Game.
"Tim ... is a good receiver

who's improved a lot since last
year," Erickson said. Stall worth
is currently 17th nationally with
5.38 catches per game.
This balanced attack — 235
yards rushing, 270 passing a game
— will face a Stanford defense
that is having a good year. Led
by inside linebackers Jono Tun
ney and Kevin Richardson, the
team's top tacklers, the defense
has kept Stanford in seven of eight
games this season.
"They're a great defensive foot
ball team," Erickson said.
The Cardinal defense has given
Stanford 22 fumbles and intercep
tions, while the offense has lost
the ball only nine times, and the
Cardinal's plus 1.88 turnovers a
game leaves the squad fifth na
tionally.
Washington State's defense
