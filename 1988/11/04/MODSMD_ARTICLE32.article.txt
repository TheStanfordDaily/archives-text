# Water polo takes on alumni
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Couldn't make it to Seoul? No need
to worry, the Olympics are coming to
Stanford.
As part of the Farm's celebration of
its Olympians, the water polo team will
clash with the Cardinal alumni squad
tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. Included among
representatives of Stanford's six NCAA
championship squads are poloers com
prising almost a third of the 1988 Olym
pic silver medal-winning team, in addi
tion to three members of the 1984 Team
USA. And the Cardinal thought holding
off Southern California was difficult.
The 15-man roster, looking like a
summary of Who's Who of American
Water Polo, will be headed by four-time
NCAA All-American, three-time Olym
pian, and two-time Olympic silver
medalist Jody Campbell. The holeman
will be joined by fellow Seoul survivors
Alan Mouchawar, fellow '82 graduate

and four-time All-American; James Ber
geson, four-time All-American and
member of the '80 and '81 Cardinal
championship teams; and Craig Klass,
the youngest member of the 1988 squad
and an All-American during the Cardi
nal's '85 and '86 NCAA victories.
Campbell will also be joined by Los
Angeles Games (and boycotted Moscow
Games) teammates Chris Dorst and
Drew McDonald, members of the 1976
Cardinal championship squad. While
Craig Brown will be representing the
Vietnam War era squads, Chris
Thompson, Greg Gamble, Marvin
Mouchawar, and 1987 graduate Obi
Greenman will be more familiar to the
deGuerre spectators.
A "serious" game for the current Car
dinal squad, which is in the middle of
its Pacific 10 season, the contest is taken
a little more lightly by the graduates,
many of whom have not played together
since their days on the Farm. "It's
definitely going to be a different type

of playing than Seoul," Campbell said.
"It's going to be a little more casual
and a lot more fun."
In the five years the alumni contest
has been held, the Cardinal has yet to
defeat its predecessors. In fact, the
defeat in 1986 was the only loss the
squad suffered all year, as it cruised to
a 36-0 record on the way to its second
consecutive NCAA title. At least on the
record it was an undefeated season. . .
With less than a month to go until
the national championships, the current
Stanford squad can ill-afford to let up
this weekend, and the contest will be
played with all personnel at full inten
sity. For the alums, especially those com
ing off of four or more years of Olympic
training, it will be an opportunity to be
reunited with old friends and let loose
in deGuerre.
According to Stanford coach Dante


Kal Keasey â€” Daily file
Goalie Todd Kemp will have his work cut out for him tomorrow when the water polo
team takes on its illustrious alumni.
Dettamanti, the alumni teams
have been known to have a little
fun at the collegians' expense,
pulling off such "plays" as illegally
substituting a player into the
wrong end of the pool, tossing the
open man the ball, and scoring
while the action is supposedly at
the other goal. The referees' de
cision? Goal.

While the "old" Cardinal is
trying to outfox its younger coun
terparts, the "youngsters" will be
trying to pick up techniques from
the world's best. "This is really
a chance for us to improve, it's
the best team we're going to play
against all year," Dettamanti said.
"I'm not sure we're in shape or
have the intensity to teach the
kids anything," Campbell
retorted. "My goal is to have as
much fun as possible seeing and
playing with old friends."
