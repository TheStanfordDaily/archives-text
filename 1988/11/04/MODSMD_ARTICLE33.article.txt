# Women's, men's soccer teams end seasons on separate coasts

It's over. Or, at least it will be
after Saturday. Many Stanford
sports fans refuse to believe it.
They keep pinching themselves to
convince themselves that it has
really happened. The Cardinal
players have tossed and turned in
their sleep since the word filtered
down from the NCAA on Monday:
The Stanford Cardinal women's
soccer team is not invited to the
NCAA's postseason party.
After the Cardinal's 2-0 victory
over Portland on Saturday, the
entire Stanford soccer community
turned its attention to the
NCAA's imminent decision re
garding Stanford's NCAA Tour
nament status. Nobody knew
what to expect. Coach Berhane
Andeberhan estimated his squad's
chances of making the tourney at
50-50. Some more optimistic Car
dinal fans speculated that the
Cardinal might even pocket the
western region's No. 1 seed.
None of this was in the cards
for Stanford, and, in fact, the Car
dinal came up empty. No surprise
was the NCAA's decision to send
California tourneyward. The real
shock came when the selection
committee bypassed what most
people believed to be the region's
No. 2 and No. 3 teams, UC-Santa
Barbara and Stanford, respective
ly, to select St. Mary's College as
the only other representative of

the west coast.
The UCSB players should not
bu bliuckcd that they were not
selected. They folded the tent on
their 1988 season a few weeks
early, suffering a couple of losses
to far inferior teams. Neverthe
less, they entered selection week
end ranked No. 7 nationally with
a 10-3-1 record. Brown was
ranked very high also (13th) and
they were denied admittance to
the tournament. These teams'
omissions should make Stanford
feei a little better.
The real thorn in Stanford's
side, however, is the fact that St.
Mary's was invited. The Gaels en
tered last weekend's competition
ranked 20th, compared to Stan
ford's No. 14 ranking. Despite
Stanford's strong showing against
Portland on Saturday, St. Mary's
obviously did something to
impress the selection committee.
The Gaels' mysteriously favorable
impression also carried over to
the national rankings; St. Mary's
vaulted ahead of Stanford in this
week's poll. St. Mary's will wind
up ranked 14th nationally; Stan
ford dropped to 17th.
The Stanford players, though
admittedly "taking it pretty bad
ly" on Monday, have readjusted
their attitudes toward the healthy
end of the continuum. As would
be expected, the seniors are prob
ably the most crushed of all after
seeing their last chance at NCAA
Tournament play snatched from
before their eyes. But somehow,
they have managed to derive some

positive thoughts from the fiasco.
Senior Christy McDevitt spoke
for all of her fellow classmates on
the squad when she addressed
both the team's disappointment
and the seniors' positive attitude
about the season. "Of course
we're all disappointed, but we
know in our hearts that we're a
playoff team. That internal feeling
is all that really matters because
we didn't expect to go off and
capture the national champion
ship anyway," McDevitt said.
"Beth [Egan] reminded me that
our goal all along has been to
become a playoff team, and we
feel that we have definitely ac
complished that goal.
"We've got to look on the bright
side," McDevitt continued. "We,
as seniors, have seen the Stanford
women's soccer program built
from the ground up. And we are
so lucky to have Berhane. So
much of this team is young; we
want to come back and watch this
team go to the Final Four. We
honestly think they have a great
chance."
Indeed, the Stanford Cardinal
will be a force to be reckoned with
in '89. But for now, the Cardinal
has some late-season housekeep
ing to complete. On Saturday, it
plays Chico State in an away
game. The players, including the
seniors, are somehow finding the
internal strength to, like they
have done all season, rivet their
attention on the upcoming oppon
ent. In one final team effort, the
1988 Stanford Cardinal women's
soccer team takes the field on Sat
urday — their goal is one last win
to cap off what will always
remain, in their hearts, a dream
season.
