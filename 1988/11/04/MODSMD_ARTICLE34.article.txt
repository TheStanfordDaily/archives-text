# Men on the road in South Carolina tourney
##

After playing the role of home
body for the last five weeks, the
Cardinal men's soccer team has
packed its bags for South Carolina
and the prestigious Met Life Clas
sic Tournament. Stanford, 10-9,
hopes to play spoiler to a pair of
national soccer powers in its final
two games of the season tomor
row and Sunday.
Although the Cardinal is com
pletely out of playoff contention,
Indiana and Air Force are two
teams who pretty much have to
beat the Cardinal if they are to
assure themselves a position in
postseason play. Stanford is one
of four teams at the tournament,
and the only one playing for pride
alone.
"We have nothing to lose, and
I think we're going to go in very
relaxed," sweeper Mark Semioli
expressed. "There's no pressure
on us, but there's pressure on
Indiana and Air Force."
Just the name Indiana Univer
sity strikes instant fear in most
college soccer players' hearts. The
Hookers have a soccer tradition
to match their hoops program's
— consecutive national titles in
'83 and '84, finals in '85, and
four NCAA Tournament appear
ances in the last five years. As
they prepare to play Stanford,
they boast a 15-3-1 record and a
national ranking of eight.
But the Midwesterners will
have to forgive the Cardinal if
they don't seem awed. "These are

not Super-teams," senior Luke
Garrott said. "I don't think we're
going to have any more of a prob
lem psychologically facing Indiana
than we've had against other top
teams. We have a chance —
there's no way we're going to get
blown out."
Indeed, Stanford has tasted suc
cess against some of the top teams
in the nation. Besides a multitude
of 1-0 losses against excellent
squads, the Cardinal owns vic
tories against national power
American University and top-ten
team USF. Stanford lost a close
one to Santa Clara and beat
George Washington University,
both of whom beat Indiana — at
the Hoosiers' own tournament.
Indiana boasts the fourth
leading scorer in the nation, soph
omore Ken Snow. Snow has only
20 goals this year, after amassing
28 his freshman season.
Goalkeeper Juergen Sommer is
eighth in the nation with a .545
goals-allowed-per-game average.
The Hoosiers were the top-ranked
team in the nation earlier in the
season.
Twenty-four hours later, Stan
ford must go up against the Air
Force Academy. The Falcons are
12-3-2 and have been ranked as
high as 13th this year, but are
currently out of the top 20. The
senior tandem of Chris Foster and
Glenn Melia have accounted for
29 goals and 16 assists on the
season, making Air Force just as
explosive a team as Indiana.
