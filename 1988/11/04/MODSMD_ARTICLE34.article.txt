# Men on the road in South Carolina tourney
## 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
After playing the role of home
body for the last five weeks, the
Cardinal men's soccer team has
packed its bags for South Carolina
and the prestigious Met Life Clas
sic Tournament. Stanford, 10-9,
hopes to play spoiler to a pair of
national soccer powers in its final
two games of the season tomor
row and Sunday.
Although the Cardinal is com
pletely out of playoff contention,
Indiana and Air Force are two
teams who pretty much have to
beat the Cardinal if they are to
assure themselves a position in
postseason play. Stanford is one
of four teams at the tournament,
and the only one playing for pride
alone.
"We have nothing to lose, and
I think we're going to go in very
relaxed," sweeper Mark Semioli
expressed. "There's no pressure
on us, but there's pressure on
Indiana and Air Force."
Just the name Indiana Univer
sity strikes instant fear in most
college soccer players' hearts. The
Hookers have a soccer tradition
to match their hoops program's
— consecutive national titles in
'83 and '84, finals in '85, and
four NCAA Tournament appear
ances in the last five years. As
they prepare to play Stanford,
they boast a 15-3-1 record and a
national ranking of eight.
But the Midwesterners will
have to forgive the Cardinal if
they don't seem awed. "These are

not Super-teams," senior Luke
Garrott said. "I don't think we're
going to have any more of a prob
lem psychologically facing Indiana
than we've had against other top
teams. We have a chance —
there's no way we're going to get
blown out."
Indeed, Stanford has tasted suc
cess against some of the top teams
in the nation. Besides a multitude
of 1-0 losses against excellent
squads, the Cardinal owns vic
tories against national power
American University and top-ten
team USF. Stanford lost a close
one to Santa Clara and beat
George Washington University,
both of whom beat Indiana — at
the Hoosiers' own tournament.
Indiana boasts the fourth
leading scorer in the nation, soph
omore Ken Snow. Snow has only
20 goals this year, after amassing
28 his freshman season.
Goalkeeper Juergen Sommer is
eighth in the nation with a .545
goals-allowed-per-game average.
The Hoosiers were the top-ranked
team in the nation earlier in the
season.
Twenty-four hours later, Stan
ford must go up against the Air
Force Academy. The Falcons are
12-3-2 and have been ranked as
high as 13th this year, but are
currently out of the top 20. The
senior tandem of Chris Foster and
Glenn Melia have accounted for
29 goals and 16 assists on the
season, making Air Force just as
explosive a team as Indiana.
"I think that playing two top-20
teams will pick my game up a
bit," Cardinal goalie Chris Helling
said. "I know I'll be a little more
ready... ready for more shots,
for a more dangerous opponent
than normally."
Air Force has a reputation more
for its tenacity as a team than its
skill. "Air Force is just one of
those teams that's good offen
sively and they can run for 90
minutes just because they're in
tremendous shape. They'll rely on
that to wear us down," Semioli
said.
The Cardinal has played phys
ical games this year, most notably
in their 1-0 win over USF. The
Falcons, who were tied by the
Dons this year, will mix it up with
Stanford as well. "Air Force is a
bunch of goons who are incredibly
up for each game and hack the
hell out of the other team," Gar
rott theorized. "It will be incred

ibly physical."
Stanford is certainly the under
dog in the tournament, but only
on paper. A difficul* schedule, a
bizarre scoring dry spell, and a
few mental lapses have resulted
in their misleadingly mediocre
record. The Cardinal is a talented
team with leadership and a
penchant for hard play. Their ten
goals last weekend were no fluke
and not simply due to the com
petition.
"I don't think they (Indiana and
Air Force) are going to overlook
us. They're in for a real surprise
if they do," Semioli said. "I think
we're going to beat 'em, whether
they're ready or not."
Helling agreed. "We're going to
be seeing a lot more effective of
fense than we've seen in the past.
I feel our defense is capable of
shutting a team like that out, if
we play our best performances."
The junior added, "It will proba
bly take a shutout to win."
And to win this tournament.. .
well, what a way for the team's
seven seniors to go out. This one
is for them.

Garrott said. "I don't think we're
going to have any more of a prob
lem psychologically facing Indiana
than we've had against other top
teams. We have a chance —
there's no way we're going to get
blown out."
Indeed, Stanford has tasted suc
cess against some of the top teams
in the nation. Besides a multitude
of 1-0 losses against excellent
squads, the Cardinal owns vic
tories against national power
American University and top-ten
team USF. Stanford lost a close
one to Santa Clara and beat
George Washington University,
both of whom beat Indiana — at
the Hoosiers' own tournament.
Indiana boasts the fourth
leading scorer in the nation, soph
omore Ken Snow. Snow has only
20 goals this year, after amassing
28 his freshman season.
Goalkeeper Juergen Sommer is
eighth in the nation with a .545
goals-allowed-per-game average.
The Hoosiers were the top-ranked
team in the nation earlier in the
season.
Twenty-four hours later, Stan
ford must go up against the Air
Force Academy. The Falcons are
12-3-2 and have been ranked as
high as 13th this year, but are
currently out of the top 20. The
senior tandem of Chris Foster and
Glenn Melia have accounted for
29 goals and 16 assists on the
season, making Air Force just as
explosive a team as Indiana.
"I think that playing two top-20
teams will pick my game up a
bit," Cardinal goalie Chris Helling
said. "I know I'll be a little more
ready... ready for more shots,
for a more dangerous opponent
than normally."
Air Force has a reputation more
for its tenacity as a team than its
skill. "Air Force is just one of
those teams that's good offen
sively and they can run for 90
minutes just because they're in
tremendous shape. They'll rely on
that to wear us down," Semioli
said.
The Cardinal has played phys
ical games this year, most notably
in their 1-0 win over USF. The
Falcons, who were tied by the
Dons this year, will mix it up with
Stanford as well. "Air Force is a
bunch of goons who are incredibly
up for each game and hack the
hell out of the other team," Gar
rott theorized. "It will be incred

ibly physical."
Stanford is certainly the under
dog in the tournament, but only
on paper. A difficul* schedule, a
bizarre scoring dry spell, and a
few mental lapses have resulted
in their misleadingly mediocre
record. The Cardinal is a talented
team with leadership and a
penchant for hard play. Their ten
goals last weekend were no fluke
and not simply due to the com
petition.
"I don't think they (Indiana and
Air Force) are going to overlook
us. They're in for a real surprise
if they do," Semioli said. "I think
we're going to beat 'em, whether
they're ready or not."
Helling agreed. "We're going to
be seeing a lot more effective of
fense than we've seen in the past.
I feel our defense is capable of
shutting a team like that out, if
we play our best performances."
The junior added, "It will proba
bly take a shutout to win."
And to win this tournament.. .
well, what a way for the team's
seven seniors to go out. This one
is for them.
After playing the role of home
body for the last five weeks, the
Cardinal men's soccer team has
packed its bags for South Carolina
and the prestigious Met Life Clas
sic Tournament. Stanford, 10-9,
hopes to play spoiler to a pair of
national soccer powers in its final
two games of the season tomor
row and Sunday.
Although the Cardinal is com
pletely out of playoff contention,
Indiana and Air Force are two
teams who pretty much have to
beat the Cardinal if they are to
assure themselves a position in
postseason play. Stanford is one
of four teams at the tournament,
and the only one playing for pride
alone.
"We have nothing to lose, and
I think we're going to go in very
relaxed," sweeper Mark Semioli
expressed. "There's no pressure
on us, but there's pressure on
Indiana and Air Force."
Just the name Indiana Univer
sity strikes instant fear in most
college soccer players' hearts. The
Hookers have a soccer tradition
to match their hoops program's
— consecutive national titles in
'83 and '84, finals in '85, and
four NCAA Tournament appear
ances in the last five years. As
they prepare to play Stanford,
they boast a 15-3-1 record and a
national ranking of eight.
But the Midwesterners will
have to forgive the Cardinal if
they don't seem awed. "These are

not Super-teams," senior Luke
Garrott said. "I don't think we're
going to have any more of a prob
lem psychologically facing Indiana
than we've had against other top
teams. We have a chance —
there's no way we're going to get
blown out."
