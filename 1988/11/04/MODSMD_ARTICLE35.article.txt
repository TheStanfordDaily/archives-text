# Volleyball hosts stars of the past in alumnae game
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Just talking to the coaches, the
Stanford women's volleyball team
may face its toughest opponent of
the season when it takes the
Maples Pavilion floor at 7:30 for
this evening's Alumnae Tourna
ment. Featuring 1988 Olympic
Team captain Kim Oden and a

score of other Stanford stars, the
Cardinal alums will give this
year's blisteringly-hot team a run
for its money.
The Stanford varsity, ranked
second in both the Pacific 10 Con
ference and the nation, is enjoying
one of the school's finest seasons
ever and is continuing to extend
the school record for consecutive
wins that was set in 1985, Oden's

senior season. Though this unof
ficial contest puts the 17-match
streak on the line, it will provide
an opportunity for this season's
squad to prove itself as perhaps
the best in Stanford history.
But, more importantly,
tonight's tourney will give the
Cardinal a needed respite from
intercollegiate competition and a
chance to play the game strictly
for their own enjoyment. Replac
ing the usual best-of-five format
with a predetermined number of
games (most likely four), the
match should be an enjoyable
showcase for the entire varsity
roster.
"They'll get to go out there,

have a little fun and get a taste
of Stanford history and tradi
tion," Stanford Coach Don Shaw
said. "I think we've actually built
that now — we didn't have that
for a long time. Now, we're going
to get four or five Ail-Americans,
a collegiate Player of the Year and
Olympic Team captain in Kim,
and that's great stuff."
Joining Oden will be an All-
America contingent of players who
graced the Cardinal court at
various times during her Stanford
career. Setter Wendi Rush and
middle blocker Nancy Reno, two
of the anchors for last year's
NCAA runner-up squad as well
as members of the local Major

League Volleyball professional
franchise, will move back onto the
court after spending this season
as Stanford spectators.
Also returning for the weekend
is Rush's older sister Kari, who
set at Stanford in the years just
prior to Wendi's arrival. With the
Rush sisters calling the plays, the
alumnae hitters will be well
directed.
The remaining players on the
alumnae squad are all legends in
their own right, all impact players
when they wore the cardinal and
white. Back from the past and
playing in Maples will be Julie
Baker, Terri Bryson, Susan Com
pton, Barbra Fontana, Brooke
Hahner, Lisa Murphy, Liz Sloan
and other surprise guests.
At the helm of the alumnae
squad is another Stanford legend,
Fred Sturm. The sole coach of the
Stanford men's volleyball team
after co-coaching both the men

and the women through the 1985
season, Sturm is fresh off the U.S.
Men's Olympic Team coaching
staff and should do wonders with
his deep bench.
"It's my understanding that
Fred Sturm predicted an alumnae
blow-out," Stanford Asst. Coach
Ruben Nieves quipped. "Three or
four games to zero."
"If that's how Coach Sturm
feels about it," Shaw laughingly
rejoined, "maybe we'll have to see
what what we can do. We're just
going to try to keep up with them.
We know with players like Oden
and Rush and Reno, a coach like
Sturm, it's a practically impossi
ble task.
"But we're going to do the best
we can. I know I'm in over my
head — I mean, Fred's my men
tor, he taught me all I know. It's

Kidding aside, the contest will
be an exhibition of top-level vol
leyball on both sides of the net.
The varsity is fresh off a three
game win Tuesday night at Cali
fornia and, while struggling in
several matches, has found a way
to win every match but one (an
early season loss to undefeated
and top-ranked UCLA).
The Cardinal also boasts a
potent arsenal on the outside.
Freshman Kristin Klein has led
the team in kills throughout the
season, while junior Jennifer
Chaffee has come on strong in
the past half-dozen matches to be
come a tough right-side hitter.
Supplemented by the strong
middle attack of senior captain
Laura Olesen and freshman Amy
Cooper (who leads the team in
hitting percentage), as well as the
ever-improving and already excel
lent setting of junior Lara Asper,
the alumnae squad will quickly
learn why the Cardinal has
obliterated the consecutive vic
tories record and continues to beat
the toughest opponents. Even
against Olympians, the Cardinal
does not scare easily.

does not scare easily.
Just talking to the coaches, the
Stanford women's volleyball team
may face its toughest opponent of
the season when it takes the
Maples Pavilion floor at 7:30 for
this evening's Alumnae Tourna
ment. Featuring 1988 Olympic
Team captain Kim Oden and a

score of other Stanford stars, the
Cardinal alums will give this
year's blisteringly-hot team a run
for its money.
The Stanford varsity, ranked
second in both the Pacific 10 Con
ference and the nation, is enjoying
one of the school's finest seasons
ever and is continuing to extend
the school record for consecutive
wins that was set in 1985, Oden's

senior season. Though this unof
ficial contest puts the 17-match
streak on the line, it will provide
an opportunity for this season's
squad to prove itself as perhaps
the best in Stanford history.
But, more importantly,
tonight's tourney will give the
Cardinal a needed respite from
intercollegiate competition and a
chance to play the game strictly
for their own enjoyment. Replac
ing the usual best-of-five format
with a predetermined number of
games (most likely four), the
match should be an enjoyable
showcase for the entire varsity
roster.
"They'll get to go out there,

have a little fun and get a taste
of Stanford history and tradi
tion," Stanford Coach Don Shaw
said. "I think we've actually built
that now — we didn't have that
for a long time. Now, we're going
to get four or five Ail-Americans,
a collegiate Player of the Year and
Olympic Team captain in Kim,
and that's great stuff."
Joining Oden will be an All-
America contingent of players who
graced the Cardinal court at
various times during her Stanford
career. Setter Wendi Rush and
middle blocker Nancy Reno, two
of the anchors for last year's
NCAA runner-up squad as well
as members of the local Major

League Volleyball professional
franchise, will move back onto the
court after spending this season
as Stanford spectators.
Also returning for the weekend
is Rush's older sister Kari, who
set at Stanford in the years just
prior to Wendi's arrival. With the
Rush sisters calling the plays, the
alumnae hitters will be well
directed.
The remaining players on the
alumnae squad are all legends in
their own right, all impact players
when they wore the cardinal and
white. Back from the past and
playing in Maples will be Julie
Baker, Terri Bryson, Susan Com
pton, Barbra Fontana, Brooke
Hahner, Lisa Murphy, Liz Sloan
and other surprise guests.
At the helm of the alumnae
squad is another Stanford legend,
Fred Sturm. The sole coach of the
Stanford men's volleyball team
after co-coaching both the men

and the women through the 1985
season, Sturm is fresh off the U.S.
Men's Olympic Team coaching
staff and should do wonders with
his deep bench.
"It's my understanding that
Fred Sturm predicted an alumnae
blow-out," Stanford Asst. Coach
Ruben Nieves quipped. "Three or
four games to zero."
"If that's how Coach Sturm
feels about it," Shaw laughingly
rejoined, "maybe we'll have to see
what what we can do. We're just
going to try to keep up with them.
We know with players like Oden
and Rush and Reno, a coach like
Sturm, it's a practically impossi
ble task.
"But we're going to do the best
we can. I know I'm in over my
head — I mean, Fred's my men
tor, he taught me all I know. It's

we can do."
Kidding aside, the contest will
be an exhibition of top-level vol
leyball on both sides of the net.
The varsity is fresh off a three
game win Tuesday night at Cali
fornia and, while struggling in
several matches, has found a way
to win every match but one (an
early season loss to undefeated
and top-ranked UCLA).
The Cardinal also boasts a
potent arsenal on the outside.
Freshman Kristin Klein has led
the team in kills throughout the
season, while junior Jennifer
Chaffee has come on strong in
the past half-dozen matches to be
come a tough right-side hitter.
Supplemented by the strong
middle attack of senior captain
Laura Olesen and freshman Amy
Cooper (who leads the team in
hitting percentage), as well as the
ever-improving and already excel
lent setting of junior Lara Asper,
the alumnae squad will quickly
learn why the Cardinal has
obliterated the consecutive vic
tories record and continues to beat
the toughest opponents. Even
against Olympians, the Cardinal
does not scare easily.
