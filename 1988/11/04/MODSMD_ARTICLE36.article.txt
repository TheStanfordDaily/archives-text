# Spikers try their luck as Guest Greeks
## 
### 
The Greek returns this week,
and after a volleyball player,
Scott Fortune, went 3-7 as the
Guest Greek last week, our panel
of experts has returned to the
sport of volleyball for this week's
guest. This time around, the
Cardinal women's volleyball
team, in its entirety, receives the
honor of a lifetime.
"I figure if one volleyball
player can go 3-7, maybe 13 of
them will go 0-10," the slowly
sinking Chris Crader said, "and
that would keep me out of the
basement."
How did the spikers earn this
prestigious honor, though? Well,
for starters they're good. I mean
really good. So good they haven't
lost since before school started.
Now that's good.
The team is currently riding a
school-record 17-match win
streak and is ranked second na
tionally. And what is their reac
tion to wielding the tremendous
power the Guest Greek provides?
Here are their reactions:

"studious," Nicole Appleman;

choosing Oregon to stomp UCLA
69-0 and prognosticating a tie
between Arizona State and
Oregon State. But who can argue

with a group that is 22-1 on the
year? Especially a very tall group
that is 22-1 on the year.

Today cohorts Dave Earnest and

Rather an interesting bunch,
don't you think?
They did come up with a cou
ple of interesting picks, as well,
choosing Oregon to stomp UCLA
69-0 and prognosticating a tie
between Arizona State and
Oregon State. But who can argue

with a group that is 22-1 on the
year? Especially a very tall group
that is 22-1 on the year.
Among the regulars, Card
Today cohorts Dave Earnest and
Robert Pardington's tratorious
ways in picking Washington over
the Cardinal last week keyed

their upward surges. Pardington
continues in his evil ways, tab
bing Washington State this
week. The man probably thought
Arizona State would win the Col
lege World Series last year, too.
Earnest is being hotly pursued
by Mark Rogowsky,
The Greek returns this week,
and after a volleyball player,
Scott Fortune, went 3-7 as the
Guest Greek last week, our panel
of experts has returned to the
sport of volleyball for this week's
guest. This time around, the
Cardinal women's volleyball
team, in its entirety, receives the
honor of a lifetime.
"I figure if one volleyball
player can go 3-7, maybe 13 of
them will go 0-10," the slowly
sinking Chris Crader said, "and
that would keep me out of the
basement."
How did the spikers earn this
prestigious honor, though? Well,
for starters they're good. I mean
really good. So good they haven't
lost since before school started.
Now that's good.
The team is currently riding a
school-record 17-match win
streak and is ranked second na
tionally. And what is their reac
tion to wielding the tremendous
power the Guest Greek provides?
Here are their reactions:
"joyous," Karen Anderson;
"studious," Nicole Appleman;
"anticlimactical," Lara Asper;
"shamanistic," Jessica Benton;
"exhilerated," Jodi Birk;
