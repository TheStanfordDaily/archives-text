# Pesky virus worms into national computer network, hits Stanford
## 
### Burke Smith Editorial staff With wire reports 
A rapidly spreading computer virus hit
universities and research institu
tions yesterday, including Stanford,
slowing down communications but
causing no major damage to data bases.
The virus "was mainly just slowing
down systems and slowing data. ... It
just chokes computers. . . . Our people are
saying no data were destroyed," said Bob
Beyers, director of Stanford News Serv
ice.
Press representatives at the NASA-
Ames Research Center in Mountain View
also said their systems had been infected.
Viruses, the communicable diseases of
computers, are tiny programs created in
computers either as a joke or vandalism.
They can attach themselves to other pro

grams and spread through shared
software.
In their mildest form, a message
flashes on a user's screen; as malig
nancies, they can destroy data and cripple
a computer.
The bug infected hundreds of comput
ers said Prof. James Bruce, vice president
for information systems at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in Cambridge,
Mass.
According to Ralph Gorin, director of
academic information resources at Stan
ford, the worm appears to have spread
on Inter-Net, a network established by
the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency.
Inter-Net "is a nationwide computer
network that ... reaches to just about
every university in the United States,"
Caltech spokesman Bob Finn said. "It
lets researchers communicate data and

text very easily."
"We're not crippled," Bruce said. "It
first showed up in the middle of the night
and spread very virulently during the
day."

'It first showed up'in the
middle of the night and
spread very virulently dur

The virus had slowed or halted dozens
of computers at the California Institute
of Technology in Pasadena by Thursday
morning, but caused no permanent
damage, said Bob Logan, systems man
ager of Caltech's computing organization.

"Machines get clogged up so people are
prevented from working. That's basically
the first symptom," Gorin said.
"This (virus) program tries to find all
the machines it can talk to, copies itself
into those machines, and then it starts
doing the same thing again," Logan said.
"This has the feel of somebody who
was sitting around thinking one night
over a beer, 'Hey, I can write a virus.
Let's see what happens,' " said Charley
Kline, senior research programmer with
the Computing Services Office at the Uni
versity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
111.
Kline said he uses the term "virus" to
mean a self-spreading program, though
some call such a program a "worm" un
less it does damage. He said he knew of
no damage caused by the program yes
terday.
The problem was first reported at Stan

ford at 3 a.m yesterday, causing some
machines to be stopped temporarily, but
all machines were operating normally by
midday.
"This is electronic vandalism," said
John Porter, associate provost at Boston
University.
At the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratories, in Livermore, Calif., press
representative Jeff Garberson said a com
puter problem was discovered late Wed
nesday.
"We .. . took action to contain it, which
means to stop it from spreading to other
computer systems. We were successful
by about one in the morning," about five
hours after it was discovered.
Contact with other universities showed
the virus also infected* computers at
Purdue University, the University of Wis
consin at Madison and UC-Berkeley,
Kline said.
