# Grad's research links Bush to cover-up
## Various sources show GOP 1980 campaign stalled hostage release 
### Sonya Jones 
With the insinuating taunt "Where
was George?" Sen. Ted Kennedy and
representatives at July's Democratic
Convention resurrected the question of
presidential candidate George Bush's
possible link to the arms-for-hostages
scandal of 1987.

Barbara Honegger, a Stanford grad
uate and former White House policy
antdyst for the Reagan administration,
has picked up Kennedy's question. She
is now trying to document an answer
to the question as well as to other issues
of the complicated affairs surrounding
the arms deals, hostage bargaining and
campaign strategies involving the
United States, Iran, Israel and various
actors and agencies.
The original $100 million of American
arms shipped to Iran in 1981 are not
in dispute; they have been directly or
indirectly confirmed by President

Reagan, Vice President Bush, by former
head of the CIA William Casey and the
State Department. The lingering ques
tion is whether or not this transaction
was merely the tip of an iceberg.
According to Honegger, who has con
ducted research over the past five years,
her answer appears to be yes. She has
uncovered and extracted what she says
are answers to some of the questions.
In the process, Honegger's research
has run headlong into the nature of
covert operations â€” with closed-door
meetings, witnesses reluctant to speak,
and huge sums of money uncertainly
juggled between bank accounts with un
disclosed numbers.
Honegger, a 1969 graduate in creative
writing, has prepared a summary fact
sheet presenting evidence of alleged pre
-1980 election negotiations, orchestrated
by the 1980 Reagan-Bush campaign. In
exchange for arms shipments, Iran
delayed the release of the American
hostages until after the election, Honeg
ger alleges.
Honegger was familiar with the actors
involved/ She joined the 1980 Reagan
campaign staff at the invitation of Mar
tin Anderson, a fellow at the Hoover

Institution. While studying at Stanford
in the early 19705, Honegger worked
with Anderson, writing a book on wel
fare reform. After com
pleting her master's of
science at Harvard in a
branch of psychology,
she returned to Hoover
in 1980 to work again
for Anderson.
In mid-1980 she
moved to Arlington,
Va., to work for the
Reagan campaign. After

the election she was hired to work in
the White House Office of Policy Coor
dination. In 1982, she switched to the
Department of Justice, investigating is
sues of gender discrimination.
She resigned from the administration
Aug. 22, 1983. She has worked since
as a free-lance investigative reporter.
In recent articles and letters last year
to the Iran-Contra congressional com
mittees and the special prosecutor,
Honegger claimed that on Oct. 24-25,
1980 "a jubilant staffer in the Reagan
campaign operations center said, 'We
