# Grad's research links Bush to cover-up
## Various sources show GOP 1980 campaign stalled hostage release 
### Sonya Jones 
With the insinuating taunt "Where
was George?" Sen. Ted Kennedy and
representatives at July's Democratic
Convention resurrected the question of
presidential candidate George Bush's
possible link to the arms-for-hostages
scandal of 1987.

CAMPAIGN
im

Barbara Honegger, a Stanford grad
uate and former White House policy
antdyst for the Reagan administration,
has picked up Kennedy's question. She
is now trying to document an answer
to the question as well as to other issues
of the complicated affairs surrounding
the arms deals, hostage bargaining and
campaign strategies involving the
United States, Iran, Israel and various
actors and agencies.
The original $100 million of American
arms shipped to Iran in 1981 are not
in dispute; they have been directly or
indirectly confirmed by President

Reagan, Vice President Bush, by former
head of the CIA William Casey and the
State Department. The lingering ques
tion is whether or not this transaction
was merely the tip of an iceberg.
According to Honegger, who has con
ducted research over the past five years,
her answer appears to be yes. She has
uncovered and extracted what she says
are answers to some of the questions.
In the process, Honegger's research
has run headlong into the nature of
covert operations — with closed-door
meetings, witnesses reluctant to speak,
and huge sums of money uncertainly
juggled between bank accounts with un
disclosed numbers.
Honegger, a 1969 graduate in creative
writing, has prepared a summary fact
sheet presenting evidence of alleged pre
-1980 election negotiations, orchestrated
by the 1980 Reagan-Bush campaign. In
exchange for arms shipments, Iran
delayed the release of the American
hostages until after the election, Honeg
ger alleges.
Honegger was familiar with the actors
involved/ She joined the 1980 Reagan
campaign staff at the invitation of Mar
tin Anderson, a fellow at the Hoover

Institution. While studying at Stanford
in the early 19705, Honegger worked
with Anderson, writing a book on wel
fare reform. After com
pleting her master's of
science at Harvard in a
branch of psychology,
she returned to Hoover
in 1980 to work again
for Anderson.
In mid-1980 she
moved to Arlington,
Va., to work for the
Reagan campaign. After

the election she was hired to work in
the White House Office of Policy Coor
dination. In 1982, she switched to the
Department of Justice, investigating is
sues of gender discrimination.
She resigned from the administration
Aug. 22, 1983. She has worked since
as a free-lance investigative reporter.
In recent articles and letters last year
to the Iran-Contra congressional com
mittees and the special prosecutor,
Honegger claimed that on Oct. 24-25,
1980 "a jubilant staffer in the Reagan
campaign operations center said, 'We


Bush
don't have to worry about an Oc
tober surprise. Dick cut a deal.'"
According to Honegger, "Dick"
referred to Richard Allen,
Reagan's 1980 campaign foreign
policy and defense adviser, who
later became Reagan's first na
tional security adviser.
The idea of an "October
Surprise" evolved from a comput
erized polling analysis completed
by Reagan-Bush pollster Richard
Beal at Brigham Young Univer
sity in the spring of 1980, accord
ing to Peter Blai, a graduate
student working with Beal.
Beal's analysis speculated that
if President Jimmy Carter
brought the 52 American hostages
home within a critical time period,
between Oct. 18-25, 1980 — called
the "window of vulnerability" —
he would receive a 10-point boost
in election polls, thus nearly en
suring a Carter victory.
According to Blai, Beal reported
his findings to Richard Wirthlin,
Reagan's chief pollster and top
campaign adviser. Blai also claims
Beal told him that this comput
erized "October Surprise" analy
sis was funded by the CIA.
A White House committee in
vestigating the alleged "Debate
gate" theft of President Carter's
campaign papers before the
Reagan-Carter debate, documents
that there were two teams work
ing on the prevention of an Oc
tober Surprise.
The first team met in the
Skyline House in Falls Church,
Va., and included former Attorney
General Edwin Meese, Casey —
then manager of the Reagan-Bush
campaign and later CIA chief,
Wirthlin, and Adm. Robert Gar
rick — head of plans and policy
for the Reagan campaign. The sec
ond team, organized by Allen in
cluded Fred Ikle — currently an
under secretary of defense.
Investigations over the past two
years by Honegger, representa
tives from the media and White
House committees have docu
mented evidence of the following
activities by these two groups:
looking for signs of rescue
• Speaking before the White
House committee investigating
the allegations of Debategate,
Meese, Casey and Chief of Staff
James Baker all confirmed that

Garrick ran a network of both
active and retired officers enlisted
to watch American military bases
for any signs of unusual activity.
Such activity would suggest a
hostage rescue operation secretly
organized by President Carter, ac
cording to Christopher Hitchens
in the Minority Report, July 1987.
Garrick confirmed this in his
own testimony before the same
committee but claimed he could
not remember the names of his
informants or the names of the
bases.
The committee found that
"Garrick's lack of memory about
his alleged 'network' is not
credible."
Iranian offer to advisers
• Richard Allen, Robert McFar
lane — Reagan's third national
security adviser and former aide
to Texas Sen. John Tower on the
Senate Armed Services Commit
tee, and Laurence Silberman — a
long-time CIA attorney who had
previously worked on a covert op
eration involving Iran in 1978,
have all acknowledged they met
with a self-proclaimed Ayatollah
Khomeini emissary in an October
1980 meeting in Washington. The
Iranian representative offered to
release the hostages at the wishes
of the Reagan-Bush camp —
rather than into the hands of the
Carter administration.
Follow-up meetings in Paris
• Two follow-up meetings took
place in Paris Oct. 19, 1980. These
meetings finalized an agreement
to delay the release of the 52

hostages in exchange for $40 mil
lion and a promise of $5 billion
in future American arms ship
ments. Richard Brenneke, an
eyewitness member of the crew
on the Paris mission, and a former
CIA agent, has testified before a
federal district judge in Colorado
that the participants at the first
Paris meeting were Bush, Casey,
Donald Gregg — a CIA agent and
currently Bush's national security
adviser — and Allen.
Another witness, a 20-year CIA
veteran who has remained anon
ymous, says Bush requested an
accompanying secret service agent
to "sweep" the room housing the
second Paris meeting for bugs.
• According to Brenneke, the
Iranian officials at the meeting
were a senior aide to Hashemi
Rafsanjani — now a speaker of
Iran's parliament and commander
of the Iranian armed forces, arms
dealer Cyrus Hashemi, Manucher
Gorbanifar — an arms tycoon
made infamous during the Iran-
Contra hearings for his dealings
with Col. Oliver North, and
Robert Benes of the French intel
ligence agency.
Bush allegedly pays in Paris
• According to Honegger's re
search, Brenneke and the CIA vet
eran claim Bush delivered a proof
of transfer of the $40 million
"good faith" payment to the
Iranian government during the
first Paris meeting. The payment
was part of a $60 million "cam
paign contribution" given by the

Shah of Iran to the Committee
to re-elect President Nixon in
1972 and until 1980 was held in
Mexico. Only $1 Imillion of the
$60 million was used for the Com
mittee to re-elect Nixon and as
funding for Watergate operations.
At the time, Bush was Chair
man of the Republican National
Committee, in a position to know
about the $60 million "contribu
tion," which was questionably le
gal, according to Honegger's
research and primary sources
such as the memoirs of an Iranian
official who had worked for the
CIA.
According to the CIA veteran,
the $40 million was wired through
Merrill Lynch, where Don Regan,
later Reagan's chief of staff, was
then senior executive officer. The
money was sent to the firm's
Zurich office, and from there into

Iran's account in Bank Leu in
Zurich.
Casey's pilot gives details
• Heinrich Rupp, the pilot who
flew Casey to the Paris meeting,
told The Boston Globe in an in
terview in September 1988 about
his role in and the details of the
CIA chief's flights. Rupp flew
Casey's plane from Washington
National Airport late in the night
Oct. 18, 1980, met in the air over
New York with the jet carrying
Bush, and continued in tandem
to Paris, landing together the next
morning.
After the first meeting, Bush
left immediately and returned to
the United States Oct. 19 in time
for an address to the Zionist Or
ganization of America in Wash
ington, D.C..
Conflicting offers
• President Carter in October
1980 was also working to cut an
arms deal as a way to free the
hostages.
With the insinuating taunt "Where
was George?" Sen. Ted Kennedy and
representatives at July's Democratic
Convention resurrected the question of
presidential candidate George Bush's
possible link to the arms-for-hostages
scandal of 1987.

dination. In 1982, she switched to the
Department of Justice, investigating is
sues of gender discrimination.
She resigned from the administration
Aug. 22, 1983. She has worked since
as a free-lance investigative reporter.
In recent articles and letters last year
to the Iran-Contra congressional com
mittees and the special prosecutor,
Honegger claimed that on Oct. 24-25,
1980 "a jubilant staffer in the Reagan
campaign operations center said, 'We


Bush
don't have to worry about an Oc
tober surprise. Dick cut a deal.'"
According to Honegger, "Dick"
referred to Richard Allen,
Reagan's 1980 campaign foreign
policy and defense adviser, who
later became Reagan's first na
tional security adviser.
The idea of an "October
Surprise" evolved from a comput
erized polling analysis completed
by Reagan-Bush pollster Richard
Beal at Brigham Young Univer
sity in the spring of 1980, accord
ing to Peter Blai, a graduate
student working with Beal.
Beal's analysis speculated that
if President Jimmy Carter
brought the 52 American hostages
home within a critical time period,
between Oct. 18-25, 1980 — called
the "window of vulnerability" —
he would receive a 10-point boost
in election polls, thus nearly en
suring a Carter victory.
According to Blai, Beal reported
his findings to Richard Wirthlin,
Reagan's chief pollster and top
campaign adviser. Blai also claims
Beal told him that this comput
erized "October Surprise" analy
sis was funded by the CIA.
A White House committee in
vestigating the alleged "Debate
gate" theft of President Carter's
campaign papers before the
Reagan-Carter debate, documents
that there were two teams work
ing on the prevention of an Oc
tober Surprise.
The first team met in the
Skyline House in Falls Church,
Va., and included former Attorney
General Edwin Meese, Casey —
then manager of the Reagan-Bush
campaign and later CIA chief,
Wirthlin, and Adm. Robert Gar
rick — head of plans and policy
for the Reagan campaign. The sec
ond team, organized by Allen in
cluded Fred Ikle — currently an
under secretary of defense.
Investigations over the past two
years by Honegger, representa
tives from the media and White
House committees have docu
mented evidence of the following
activities by these two groups:
looking for signs of rescue
• Speaking before the White
House committee investigating
the allegations of Debategate,
Meese, Casey and Chief of Staff
James Baker all confirmed that

Garrick ran a network of both
active and retired officers enlisted
to watch American military bases
for any signs of unusual activity.
Such activity would suggest a
hostage rescue operation secretly
organized by President Carter, ac
cording to Christopher Hitchens
in the Minority Report, July 1987.
Garrick confirmed this in his
own testimony before the same
committee but claimed he could
not remember the names of his
informants or the names of the
bases.
The committee found that
"Garrick's lack of memory about
his alleged 'network' is not
credible."
Iranian offer to advisers
• Richard Allen, Robert McFar
lane — Reagan's third national
security adviser and former aide
to Texas Sen. John Tower on the
Senate Armed Services Commit
tee, and Laurence Silberman — a
long-time CIA attorney who had
previously worked on a covert op
eration involving Iran in 1978,
have all acknowledged they met
with a self-proclaimed Ayatollah
Khomeini emissary in an October
1980 meeting in Washington. The
Iranian representative offered to
release the hostages at the wishes
of the Reagan-Bush camp —
rather than into the hands of the
Carter administration.
Follow-up meetings in Paris
• Two follow-up meetings took
place in Paris Oct. 19, 1980. These
meetings finalized an agreement
to delay the release of the 52

hostages in exchange for $40 mil
lion and a promise of $5 billion
in future American arms ship
ments. Richard Brenneke, an
eyewitness member of the crew
on the Paris mission, and a former
CIA agent, has testified before a
federal district judge in Colorado
that the participants at the first
Paris meeting were Bush, Casey,
Donald Gregg — a CIA agent and
currently Bush's national security
adviser — and Allen.
Another witness, a 20-year CIA
veteran who has remained anon
ymous, says Bush requested an
accompanying secret service agent
to "sweep" the room housing the
second Paris meeting for bugs.
• According to Brenneke, the
Iranian officials at the meeting
were a senior aide to Hashemi
Rafsanjani — now a speaker of
Iran's parliament and commander
of the Iranian armed forces, arms
dealer Cyrus Hashemi, Manucher
Gorbanifar — an arms tycoon
made infamous during the Iran-
Contra hearings for his dealings
with Col. Oliver North, and
Robert Benes of the French intel
ligence agency.
Bush allegedly pays in Paris
• According to Honegger's re
search, Brenneke and the CIA vet
eran claim Bush delivered a proof
of transfer of the $40 million
"good faith" payment to the
Iranian government during the
first Paris meeting. The payment
was part of a $60 million "cam
paign contribution" given by the

Shah of Iran to the Committee
to re-elect President Nixon in
1972 and until 1980 was held in
Mexico. Only $1 Imillion of the
$60 million was used for the Com
mittee to re-elect Nixon and as
funding for Watergate operations.
At the time, Bush was Chair
man of the Republican National
Committee, in a position to know
about the $60 million "contribu
tion," which was questionably le
gal, according to Honegger's
research and primary sources
such as the memoirs of an Iranian
official who had worked for the
CIA.
According to the CIA veteran,
the $40 million was wired through
Merrill Lynch, where Don Regan,
later Reagan's chief of staff, was
then senior executive officer. The
money was sent to the firm's
Zurich office, and from there into

Iran's account in Bank Leu in
Zurich.
Casey's pilot gives details
• Heinrich Rupp, the pilot who
flew Casey to the Paris meeting,
told The Boston Globe in an in
terview in September 1988 about
his role in and the details of the
CIA chief's flights. Rupp flew
Casey's plane from Washington
National Airport late in the night
Oct. 18, 1980, met in the air over
New York with the jet carrying
Bush, and continued in tandem
to Paris, landing together the next
morning.
After the first meeting, Bush
left immediately and returned to
the United States Oct. 19 in time
for an address to the Zionist Or
ganization of America in Wash
ington, D.C..
Conflicting offers
• President Carter in October
1980 was also working to cut an
arms deal as a way to free the
hostages.
With the insinuating taunt "Where
was George?" Sen. Ted Kennedy and
representatives at July's Democratic
Convention resurrected the question of
presidential candidate George Bush's
possible link to the arms-for-hostages
scandal of 1987.

CAMPAIGN
im

Barbara Honegger, a Stanford grad
uate and former White House policy
antdyst for the Reagan administration,
has picked up Kennedy's question. She
is now trying to document an answer
to the question as well as to other issues
of the complicated affairs surrounding
the arms deals, hostage bargaining and
campaign strategies involving the
United States, Iran, Israel and various
actors and agencies.
The original $100 million of American
arms shipped to Iran in 1981 are not
in dispute; they have been directly or
indirectly confirmed by President

Reagan, Vice President Bush, by former
head of the CIA William Casey and the
State Department. The lingering ques
tion is whether or not this transaction
was merely the tip of an iceberg.
According to Honegger, who has con
ducted research over the past five years,
her answer appears to be yes. She has
uncovered and extracted what she says
are answers to some of the questions.
In the process, Honegger's research
has run headlong into the nature of
covert operations — with closed-door
meetings, witnesses reluctant to speak,
and huge sums of money uncertainly
juggled between bank accounts with un
disclosed numbers.
Honegger, a 1969 graduate in creative
writing, has prepared a summary fact
sheet presenting evidence of alleged pre
-1980 election negotiations, orchestrated
by the 1980 Reagan-Bush campaign. In
exchange for arms shipments, Iran
delayed the release of the American
hostages until after the election, Honeg
ger alleges.
Honegger was familiar with the actors
involved/ She joined the 1980 Reagan
campaign staff at the invitation of Mar
tin Anderson, a fellow at the Hoover

Institution. While studying at Stanford
in the early 19705, Honegger worked
with Anderson, writing a book on wel
fare reform. After com
pleting her master's of
science at Harvard in a
branch of psychology,
she returned to Hoover
in 1980 to work again
for Anderson.
In mid-1980 she
moved to Arlington,
Va., to work for the
Reagan campaign. After

the election she was hired to work in
the White House Office of Policy Coor
dination. In 1982, she switched to the
Department of Justice, investigating is

• Speaking before the White
House committee investigating
the allegations of Debategate,
Meese, Casey and Chief of Staff
James Baker all confirmed that

Garrick ran a network of both
active and retired officers enlisted
to watch American military bases
for any signs of unusual activity.
Such activity would suggest a
hostage rescue operation secretly
organized by President Carter, ac
cording to Christopher Hitchens
in the Minority Report, July 1987.
Garrick confirmed this in his
own testimony before the same
committee but claimed he could
not remember the names of his
informants or the names of the
bases.
The committee found that
"Garrick's lack of memory about
his alleged 'network' is not
credible."
Iranian offer to advisers
• Richard Allen, Robert McFar
lane — Reagan's third national
security adviser and former aide
to Texas Sen. John Tower on the
Senate Armed Services Commit
tee, and Laurence Silberman — a
long-time CIA attorney who had
previously worked on a covert op
eration involving Iran in 1978,
have all acknowledged they met
with a self-proclaimed Ayatollah
Khomeini emissary in an October
1980 meeting in Washington. The
Iranian representative offered to
release the hostages at the wishes
of the Reagan-Bush camp —
rather than into the hands of the
Carter administration.
Follow-up meetings in Paris
• Two follow-up meetings took
place in Paris Oct. 19, 1980. These
meetings finalized an agreement
to delay the release of the 52

hostages in exchange for $40 mil
lion and a promise of $5 billion
in future American arms ship
ments. Richard Brenneke, an
eyewitness member of the crew
on the Paris mission, and a former
CIA agent, has testified before a
federal district judge in Colorado
that the participants at the first
Paris meeting were Bush, Casey,
Donald Gregg — a CIA agent and
currently Bush's national security
adviser — and Allen.
Another witness, a 20-year CIA
veteran who has remained anon
ymous, says Bush requested an
accompanying secret service agent
to "sweep" the room housing the
second Paris meeting for bugs.
• According to Brenneke, the
Iranian officials at the meeting
were a senior aide to Hashemi
Rafsanjani — now a speaker of
Iran's parliament and commander
of the Iranian armed forces, arms
dealer Cyrus Hashemi, Manucher
Gorbanifar — an arms tycoon
made infamous during the Iran-
Contra hearings for his dealings
with Col. Oliver North, and
Robert Benes of the French intel
ligence agency.
Bush allegedly pays in Paris
• According to Honegger's re
search, Brenneke and the CIA vet
eran claim Bush delivered a proof
of transfer of the $40 million
"good faith" payment to the
Iranian government during the
first Paris meeting. The payment
was part of a $60 million "cam
paign contribution" given by the

Shah of Iran to the Committee
to re-elect President Nixon in
1972 and until 1980 was held in
Mexico. Only $1 Imillion of the
$60 million was used for the Com
mittee to re-elect Nixon and as
funding for Watergate operations.
At the time, Bush was Chair
man of the Republican National
Committee, in a position to know
about the $60 million "contribu
tion," which was questionably le
gal, according to Honegger's
research and primary sources
such as the memoirs of an Iranian
official who had worked for the
CIA.
According to the CIA veteran,
the $40 million was wired through
Merrill Lynch, where Don Regan,
later Reagan's chief of staff, was
then senior executive officer. The
money was sent to the firm's
Zurich office, and from there into

Iran's account in Bank Leu in
Zurich.
Casey's pilot gives details
• Heinrich Rupp, the pilot who
flew Casey to the Paris meeting,
told The Boston Globe in an in
terview in September 1988 about
his role in and the details of the
CIA chief's flights. Rupp flew
Casey's plane from Washington
National Airport late in the night
Oct. 18, 1980, met in the air over
New York with the jet carrying
Bush, and continued in tandem
to Paris, landing together the next
morning.
After the first meeting, Bush
left immediately and returned to
the United States Oct. 19 in time
for an address to the Zionist Or
ganization of America in Wash
ington, D.C..
Conflicting offers
• President Carter in October
1980 was also working to cut an
arms deal as a way to free the
hostages.
With the insinuating taunt "Where
was George?" Sen. Ted Kennedy and
representatives at July's Democratic
Convention resurrected the question of
presidential candidate George Bush's
possible link to the arms-for-hostages
scandal of 1987.

CAMPAIGN
im

Barbara Honegger, a Stanford grad
uate and former White House policy
antdyst for the Reagan administration,
has picked up Kennedy's question. She
is now trying to document an answer
to the question as well as to other issues
of the complicated affairs surrounding
the arms deals, hostage bargaining and
campaign strategies involving the
United States, Iran, Israel and various
actors and agencies.
The original $100 million of American
arms shipped to Iran in 1981 are not
in dispute; they have been directly or
indirectly confirmed by President

Reagan, Vice President Bush, by former
head of the CIA William Casey and the
State Department. The lingering ques
tion is whether or not this transaction
was merely the tip of an iceberg.
According to Honegger, who has con
ducted research over the past five years,
her answer appears to be yes. She has
uncovered and extracted what she says
are answers to some of the questions.
In the process, Honegger's research
has run headlong into the nature of
covert operations — with closed-door
meetings, witnesses reluctant to speak,
and huge sums of money uncertainly
juggled between bank accounts with un
disclosed numbers.
Honegger, a 1969 graduate in creative
writing, has prepared a summary fact
sheet presenting evidence of alleged pre
-1980 election negotiations, orchestrated
by the 1980 Reagan-Bush campaign. In
exchange for arms shipments, Iran
delayed the release of the American
hostages until after the election, Honeg
ger alleges.
Honegger was familiar with the actors
involved/ She joined the 1980 Reagan
campaign staff at the invitation of Mar
tin Anderson, a fellow at the Hoover

Institution. While studying at Stanford
in the early 19705, Honegger worked
with Anderson, writing a book on wel
fare reform. After com
pleting her master's of
science at Harvard in a
branch of psychology,
she returned to Hoover
in 1980 to work again
for Anderson.
In mid-1980 she
moved to Arlington,
Va., to work for the
Reagan campaign. After

the election she was hired to work in
the White House Office of Policy Coor
dination. In 1982, she switched to the
Department of Justice, investigating is
sues of gender discrimination.
She resigned from the administration
Aug. 22, 1983. She has worked since
as a free-lance investigative reporter.
In recent articles and letters last year
to the Iran-Contra congressional com
mittees and the special prosecutor,
Honegger claimed that on Oct. 24-25,
1980 "a jubilant staffer in the Reagan
campaign operations center said, 'We


Bush
don't have to worry about an Oc
tober surprise. Dick cut a deal.'"
According to Honegger, "Dick"
referred to Richard Allen,
Reagan's 1980 campaign foreign
policy and defense adviser, who
later became Reagan's first na
tional security adviser.
The idea of an "October
Surprise" evolved from a comput
erized polling analysis completed
by Reagan-Bush pollster Richard
Beal at Brigham Young Univer
sity in the spring of 1980, accord
ing to Peter Blai, a graduate
student working with Beal.
Beal's analysis speculated that
if President Jimmy Carter
brought the 52 American hostages
home within a critical time period,
between Oct. 18-25, 1980 — called
the "window of vulnerability" —
he would receive a 10-point boost
in election polls, thus nearly en
suring a Carter victory.
According to Blai, Beal reported
his findings to Richard Wirthlin,
Reagan's chief pollster and top
campaign adviser. Blai also claims
Beal told him that this comput
erized "October Surprise" analy
sis was funded by the CIA.
A White House committee in
vestigating the alleged "Debate
gate" theft of President Carter's
campaign papers before the
Reagan-Carter debate, documents
that there were two teams work
ing on the prevention of an Oc
tober Surprise.
The first team met in the
Skyline House in Falls Church,
Va., and included former Attorney
General Edwin Meese, Casey —
then manager of the Reagan-Bush
campaign and later CIA chief,
Wirthlin, and Adm. Robert Gar
rick — head of plans and policy
for the Reagan campaign. The sec
ond team, organized by Allen in
cluded Fred Ikle — currently an
under secretary of defense.
Investigations over the past two
years by Honegger, representa
tives from the media and White
House committees have docu
mented evidence of the following
activities by these two groups:
looking for signs of rescue
• Speaking before the White
House committee investigating
the allegations of Debategate,
