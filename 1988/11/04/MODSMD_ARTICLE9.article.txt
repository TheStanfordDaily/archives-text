# New ASSU program coordinates outreach to student body
## 
### Amy Kosenfeld Staff writer 
Aside from Flicks and fee refunds, many
students are unclear about what else the
ASSU does. To help remedy that problem,
the ASSU Senate and Council of Presidents
have come up with two new programs to
increase student interaction with the
ASSU.
In a report at last night's senate meeting,
COP member David Brown asked for help
with the new ASSU Dorm Representatives
program.
Under the program, which was imple
mented last week, each student residence
will have at least one resident "function
as a link between the ASSU and students
in dorms," according to COP member
Stacey Leyton. "It's easy, when you're in

the ASSU, to feel real out of touch with
students," she said.
The program is starting in the larger
dorms, but will expand later to include
other residences.
The program is a new twist on an older
idea. Up until last year, senators visited
residences themselves. That was ineffec
tive, however, because often the senators
didn't go, Leyton said.
This time around, the representatives
will meet regularly with one COP member
and several senators assigned to each dorm.
They will be responsible for "letting people
know what's going on in the ASSU and
finding out what students think about what
Ithe ASSUI is doing," Leyton said.
To further increase student involvement,
the student affairs committee introduced
senate office hours in White Plaza. The

plan, slated to begin next week, will place
two senators in White Plaza from 11 a.m.
to 1 p.m. every weekday to answer ques
tions and take suggestions from students.
Senator Kathy Coll, chair of the commit
tee, said the program will "improve the
accountability of senators to the student
body and provide better communication
with the ASSU."
Senator Joe Cha said he thinks "it's
about time" the ASSU implemented these
programs. "No one around here knows
what the ASSU does."
In other business, the senate approved
routine fund allocations from the program
board and publications board and approved
the new operating budget for this year.
Also, the senate and the COP received
updated copies of the ASSU Bylaws. The
bylaws have not been updated since 1986.

'It's easy, when you're in
the ASSU, to feel real
out of touch with stu
dents.'

Confusion and uncertainty about proper
senate procedures has often reigned in the
past because only a few senators had their
own copies.
Updating the bylaws was the final action
of former senate chair Richard Vaughan,
who resigned last month because he will
be leaving Stanford.
