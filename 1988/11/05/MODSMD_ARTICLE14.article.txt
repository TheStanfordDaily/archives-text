# The
						Pac-10 is the country's best

It was just last year that the traditional football
bullies of the Big Eight Conference, Nebraska and
Oklahoma, were trouncing UCLA and USC in what
had become an embarrassing annual showcase of
the best that the Pacfic 10 Conference had to offer.
Pac-10 football fans had to console themselves
with the unsubstantiated fact that the conference
was stronger "all-around" than any other in the
nation.
But we all knew that the really big football powers
hailed from the East. The Rose Bowl had turned
into merely a preview for the Orange Bowl, which
had become the battle for the national championship
in everything but name.
Before this year, when preseason college football
polls placed UCLA and USC in the top five, Pac-10
devotees were skeptical. "Sure, but just wait until
they get the crap beat out of them by Nebraska
and Oklahoma," was the thought of the day.
Lo and behold, a miracle transformation took
place. First, the Bruins clobbered Nebraska 41-28
on Sept. 5.
The national media talked about the "physical"
game that UCLA played. UCLA had now broken
out of its "girl's football" reputation (as then Okla
homa linebacker Brian Bosworth had put it.)
The Bruin defense was big, strong and aggressive,
and complemented Heisman Trophy candidate quar
terback Troy Aikman perfectly.
Next up was USC's showdown with Oklahoma.

The Trojans couldn't pull it off too, could they? I
mean, this is the Oklahoma "70 points a week"
Sooners.
Bam, it happened! USC quarterback Rodney Peete
led the Trojans to a 23-7 victory at Norman.
Suddenly, the Pac-10 had not zero, not one, but
two legitimate contenders for the final number onÂ§
ranking. The Nov. 19 matchup between UCLA and
USC now has great significance for determining
the national champion.
While the big shots of the conference were lording
over the rest of the country, the rest of the Pac-10
showed new-found strength in early non-conference
games.
Washington State and Arizona State, expected to
finish in the bottom half of the Pac-10 before the
season, dealt Illinois two straight losses. Washington
beat up on Purdue, Army and San Jose State. To
date, the Pac-10's overall non-conference record
stands at an incredible 26-4, or an 87 percent win
ning margin.
The four losses came to Notre Dame, Oklahoma,
Nebraska and Colorado, teams with, coincidentally,
only four losses between them this season.
The Western Athletic Conference ranks second in
out-of-conference winning percentage, at 13-10. And
the Big Eight, home of Nebraska and Oklahoma?
It takes third, at 16-13-1.
An indication of the Pac-10's balance came last
week, when WSU, Stanford's opponent today, sur
prised UCLA, 34-30. A team most had picked to

Cardinal senior outside linebacker Rob Hinckley has spearheaded
a physical Stanford defense this year. Stanford's higher caliber of
play this year mirrors the development of the Pac-10, which has
become the nation's dominant college football conference.
