# The 						Pac-10 is the country's best
## 
### Robert Pardington Editorial staff 
It was just last year that the traditional football
bullies of the Big Eight Conference, Nebraska and
Oklahoma, were trouncing UCLA and USC in what
had become an embarrassing annual showcase of
the best that the Pacfic 10 Conference had to offer.
Pac-10 football fans had to console themselves
with the unsubstantiated fact that the conference
was stronger "all-around" than any other in the
nation.
But we all knew that the really big football powers
hailed from the East. The Rose Bowl had turned
into merely a preview for the Orange Bowl, which
had become the battle for the national championship
in everything but name.
Before this year, when preseason college football
polls placed UCLA and USC in the top five, Pac-10
devotees were skeptical. "Sure, but just wait until
they get the crap beat out of them by Nebraska
and Oklahoma," was the thought of the day.
Lo and behold, a miracle transformation took
place. First, the Bruins clobbered Nebraska 41-28
on Sept. 5.
The national media talked about the "physical"
game that UCLA played. UCLA had now broken
out of its "girl's football" reputation (as then Okla
homa linebacker Brian Bosworth had put it.)
The Bruin defense was big, strong and aggressive,
and complemented Heisman Trophy candidate quar
terback Troy Aikman perfectly.
Next up was USC's showdown with Oklahoma.

The Trojans couldn't pull it off too, could they? I
mean, this is the Oklahoma "70 points a week"
Sooners.
Bam, it happened! USC quarterback Rodney Peete
led the Trojans to a 23-7 victory at Norman.
Suddenly, the Pac-10 had not zero, not one, but
two legitimate contenders for the final number onÂ§
ranking. The Nov. 19 matchup between UCLA and
USC now has great significance for determining
the national champion.
While the big shots of the conference were lording
over the rest of the country, the rest of the Pac-10
showed new-found strength in early non-conference
games.
Washington State and Arizona State, expected to
finish in the bottom half of the Pac-10 before the
season, dealt Illinois two straight losses. Washington
beat up on Purdue, Army and San Jose State. To
date, the Pac-10's overall non-conference record
stands at an incredible 26-4, or an 87 percent win
ning margin.
The four losses came to Notre Dame, Oklahoma,
Nebraska and Colorado, teams with, coincidentally,
only four losses between them this season.
The Western Athletic Conference ranks second in
out-of-conference winning percentage, at 13-10. And
the Big Eight, home of Nebraska and Oklahoma?
It takes third, at 16-13-1.
An indication of the Pac-10's balance came last
week, when WSU, Stanford's opponent today, sur
prised UCLA, 34-30. A team most had picked to

finish ninth in the Pac-10 beat
the No. 1-ranked Bruins.
"The teams (in the Pac-10) are
very close in talent this season,"
Washington State Coach Dennis
Erickson said. "There isn't much
difference from top to bottom."
The key factor in the overall
resurgence of the Pac-10 has been
an improvement in recruiting.
The top players from California
and the rest of the West Coast,
who once made it a collective habit
to sign with the top teams in the
East, now are staying here.
UCLA, as an example, signed the
highest number of the group of
100 "blue chip" high school seniors
from across the nation last year.
USC has experienced a similar

boost in terms of incoming talent,
and having the inside track to the
Rose Bowl this year, could revive
the old Trojan tradition of years
past, while attracting more top
recruits. If USC can defeat UCLA
and Notre Dame in succesive
weeks later this month, the na
tional title will be wrapped up.
The end result of all these Pac
-10 team's accomplishments should
be several bowl invitations.
The winner of the conference,
of course, gets the automatic Rose
Bowl bid. Unless something un
precedented happens, it will be
UCLA or USC in a walkover.
Depending on the results of the
last few weeks, as few as two, or
as many as five other Pac-10
squads, should see post-season
play. Whichever of UCLA and
USC doesn't play in Pasadena is
a lock for a bid somewhere.

Oregon, it seemed, had a lock
on a bowl until their mid-season
skid. My guess is that the 6-2
Ducks will still see action over
the holidays.
ASU, Washington and WSU
constitute the "maybe" group.
The Huskies have the easiest
schedule of the bunch, playing Ar
izona and California at home and
finishing at WSU, and could
finish at 8-3. WSU has been up
and down this year, but could ride
the momentum of their win over
UCLA and a reasonably easy final
three games to a minor bowl ap
pearance.
Regardless of how many Pac-10
teams take the field this winter,
you can bet on a few victories,
and more importantly, a few top
twenty finishes in the final AP
college football poll.
