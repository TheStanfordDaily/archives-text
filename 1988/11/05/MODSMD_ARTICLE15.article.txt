# AFIRE offers support to individual athletes
## 
### David Earnest Editorial staff 
Stanford athletes who excel in
individual sports now are able to
receive funding for training and
other incidental expenses through
the Athletes' Fund for the Indi
vidual Recognition of Excellence
(AFIRE). The fund, established
last year, supports exceptional in
dividual athletes by helping them
pay for their living, training and
competition expenses.
The AFIRE fund was started
last year by Stanford students
Suzanna Mak and Dana Klapper.
Stanford Athletic Director Andy
Geiger accepted Mak's and Klap
per's proposal and contributed a
$20,000 grant to the fund.
Mak says the fund's purpose is

to promote individual athletic ac
complishment among student ath
letes who receive little or no
funding from the Stanford Athle
tic Department.
Students with exceptional ath
letic accomplishments may apply
for up to $5,000 by submitting to
an application process that re
quires a list of the athlete's past
accomplishments, his or her goals,
two recommendations and an
itemized list of funding.
So far, the AFIRE fund has
sponsored 10 athletes, including
two recent Olympic hopefuls.
Among the recipients are Stanford
junior John Coyle, a cyclist and
speedskater and sophomore Colter
Richardson, a cyclist.
Mak says the fund provides ath
letes with the flexibility to train

and compete without rigid spon
sorship requirements.
"(The athletes) spend what they
feel is necessary for the equipment
we mutually approve" she said.
"I like it because we're not hang
ing over them telling them what
to buy."
The AFIRE fund is not officially
within the athletic department.
The department will sponsor the
fund for only one or two more
years, so Mak hopes that the
AFIRE program will find a new
source of funding.
"We're still looking for a per
manent source of funding," Mak
said. "We need a pool of donors
who would be interested in the
fund (like) former individual
Stanford athletes."
Speedskater Coyle received

$2,300 from the AFIRE fund to
finance his winter training and
competition through March of
next year. The product design
major flies to the Midwest every
weekend to compete in speedskat
ing tournaments.
Coyle, who was a second alter
nate in short track speedskating
to the U.S. amateur team, hopes
to compete in the World
Speedskating Championships in
Bulgaria this coming February.
"I wouldn't be able to fly to all
these meets," Coyle said. "I'm
performing much better this year.
It's really helpful."
Cyclist Richardson spent last
summer competing across the
country after receiving funding
from the AFIRE fund. He used
his $2,500 grant to pay for race

entry fees, food and lodging ex
penses for travelling and spare
parts.

"What it really helped me do,"
Richardson said, "was train more
than I normally do. I was able to
work only part time instead of
full time."
Richardson also said that his
funding helped him cope with
some of the large expenses typical
of the sport of cycling. "I crashed
one week, but was able to keep
racing because I could afford re
placement parts. (Without the
fund) I would have had to put
my bike on the wall and not race."
"It makes life really pleasant,"
said Richardson, who hopes to
travel this spring to races in L.A.
if his grant is renewed. "If I didn't
have the grant, I'd have to sit at
home," he said.
Because of the continued sup
port of Geiger, the AFIRE fund
will continue to fund several in
dividual athletes for the rest of
the year. But, for the program to
continue, the AFIRE fund will
most likely need alumni financial
support to provide Stanford ath
letes with this resource .
