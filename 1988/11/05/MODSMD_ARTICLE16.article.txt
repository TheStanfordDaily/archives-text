# Academic Resource Center aids athletes

Do you need a quiet place to
study? Could you use easy access
to a tutor in almost any subject
while you are doing your
homework? If you answered "y es "
or "maybe" to these questions,
then the Academic Resource Cen
ter is perfect for you.
The Academic Resource Center
is a study/tutoring program in the
Larkin House dining hall. The
program is designed for athletes,
especially freshman, but any
Stanford student is welcome to
take advantage of the facility.
Tutors in calculus and Western
Culture are there every night,
while tutors in Spanish, writing,
economics and various other sub
jects are scheduled for specific
nights.
Larkin House Resident Fellows
Bob and Sue Harvey have been
cooperative hosts and a tremen

dous asset to the program this
year. She is an English professor
while he is a math and physics
expert. They have made them
selves available on an as-needed
basis for tutoring in their respec
tive areas of expertise.
The program was started three
years ago by Audrey Bernfield,
head of the Undergraduate Advis
ing Center. It's aim was to provide
the freshman athlete with the op
portunity to participate in aca
demic activities such as studying,
tutoring and counseling that they
would have missed otherwise.
Freshmen football players were
the first to participate in the pro
gram and the first tutors were
upperclass football players. After
the first year, Dandre Desandies,
an academic advisor, was put in
charge of the program. Since then
the program has expanded to in
clude other sports as well as non
athletes.
"Football, baseball, track and
tennis use our facilities the most,
but we are attempting to expand
on that," Desandies said. "Most
people don't know about the pro
gram. It spreads mostly by word
of mouth."
The Academic Resource Center,
commonly referred to as the ARC,
provides a valuable service to all
Stanford students. Most impor
tantly, it allows the student to
study and have access to help if
he or she gets stuck. An additional
feature of ARC is peer counseling,
which can also be found in Larkin
Monday through Thursday
nights. Students have a chance to
talk to each other about classes,
school and Stanford in general.
