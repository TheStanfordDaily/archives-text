# Heisman hype ignores the nation's best players
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
November. The time the serious
Heisman Trophy candidates begin
to come out of the woodwork.
No, not for this season. I'm
talking about candidates for the
1989 Heisman.
In today's world of style over
substance, posters are more im
portant in the voting than post
patterns. Catch-phrases over
catches per game. Press confer
ence efficiency instead of passing
efficiency.
Last year's voting was a prime
example. Tim Brown, Notre
Dame's star wide receiver, won
the Heisman. What did Brown do
to win the award besides look good
on television a couple of times
early in the season? The man was
a receiver for a run-oriented team.
As a junior he averaged a fine
27.9 yards per kickoff return to
rank third nationally. As a senior,
however, only a mediocre 19.7.
Furthermore, he had a mere 39
catches for only 846 yards his

senior year, and again both totals
are lower than those he posted as
a junior. And despite the fact that
he returned only two punts as a
junior and returned 34 as a senior,
his all-purpose yardage declined
his senior season.
Did he win the award for the
way he blocked when the Irish
ran the option? Or for not even
making the nation's top 12 in
punt returns? No, he won because
he had a huge junior year, he
played for a big-name school that
promoted him like crazy, and he
did a few good things in televised
early-season games.
When was the last time a player
won the Heisman somewhere
other than a traditional power?
George Rogers at Southern
Carolina in 1980? Maybe. Or
maybe we have to go back to Terry
Baker at Oregon State in 1962.
The last time a non
quarterback/receiver/running
back won? Leon Hart, an end at
Notre Dame in 1949.
How about the Heisman candi
date on the field today, Timm

Rosenbach of Washington State?
Rosenbach has a few advan
tages. He is a quarterback, as are
two of the last four winners. He
led his team to an upset of No.
1-ranked UCLA last week. And
he has a catchy hook: Timm
Rosenbach, say it like Sammy
"Baugh."
But even the gimmick name
isn't always enough. Just ask Joe
Theismann, Notre Dame's candi
date in 1970. Theismann, whose
family name is pronounced
THEES-man, changed the
pronunciation when he arrived in
South Bend so he would be Joe
THIGHS-man, just like Heisman.
Theismann, of course, still
finshed only second, losing tc
Stanford's Jim Plunkett.
The cons for Rosenbach: He
plays for a school that is not
known for football. His name is
not a household word. He isn't on
television much. And he didn't
really enter the Heisman race un
til this week.
So it looks like the nation's
highest-ranked passer, and the

No. 3 man nationally in total of
fense, just can't win the award,
although none of the reasons
against him have anything to do
with what he has done on the
field.
So who will win the award pre
sented annually to the nation's
top collegiate football player, or
rather the nation's top collegiate
football player who plays an of
fensive skill position for a
nationally-ranked team that plays
a lot of televised games and has
received a lot of publicity?
It looks like UCLA's Troy Aik
man. He doesn't lead the Pacific
10 Conference, let alone the na
tion, in any statistic, but he has
been touted as a candidate since
January and plays in the media
capital of the free world, Los An
geles.
Of course Rosenbach has com
pleted more passes on fewer at
tempts for more yards and the
same number of touchdowns.
Rosenbach has also run for more
than triple Aikman's rushing yar
dage, and has seven rushing

touchdowns to Aikman's one. But
he doesn't have a chance.
Neither does Oklahoma State's
Barry Sanders. Cardinal fullback
Jon Volpe ran for a school-record
220 yards last week. That number
amazes almost everyone. Except
Sanders, for whom 220 is merely
decent. You see, Barry Sanders
averages more than 210 yards a
game, rushing.
Amazing? Definitely. Heis
manesque? Not really. If he were
USC's tailback and had posters
about him sent all over the coun
try or had some special angle [like
Aikman's transferring from Okla
homa's wishbone offense] then he
would be a lock. But Stillwater,
Okla., isn't glitter town.
At least Sanders will end up
with a juicy professional contract
to sooth the pain of coming in
second in the Downtown Athletic
Club's voting.
Rosenbach has some consola
tion. His team beat Aikman's.
And Rosenbach, only a junior, is
just in time to get his name on
the top of the list for next season.
