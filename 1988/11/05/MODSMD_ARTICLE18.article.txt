# Hopkins is triple threat
## Sophomore star kicks, punts and high jumps 
### Steve Apfelberg Staff writer 
Most multi-talented athletes eventually
have to choose one sport on which to con
centrate. John Hopkins, however, did not
have to make that decision. The 6-foot-3,
180-pound sophomore place kicks and
punts for the Stanford football team and
high jumps for the Stanford track team.
Hopkins, from Dallas, Texas played six
man football from the fourth to the sixth
grades. In the seventh grade, when he
began to play eleven-man football, he
began to kick and has been a kicker ever
since.
Hopkins made the varsity team in high
school as a junior, handling wide receiver
duties as well as being the placekicker. He
kicked and continued on at wide receiver
during his senior year. For his efforts,
Hopkins was named a first team All-Metro
Conference receiver and a second team
All-Metro kicker.
Many colleges offered Hopkins a schol
arship, but he chose Stanford. The Farm's
California location and academic reputa
tion were two reasons. The main factor,
however, was the possibility of competing
in both football and track.
"Hearing the coaches tell me that I
would be able to continue both sports was
all the incentive I needed," Hopkins said.
Hopkins came to Stanford on the fourth
of July before his freshman year, so he
could begin to adjust to college. The early
arrival helped ease any fears or apprehen
sions Hopkins had about college life.
Subsequently, Hopkins was the Cardi
nal's starting place kicker as a freshman,
and played the first half of the season
before spraining his knee against Oregon.
He was sidelined for the rest of the season.
Hopkins then sprained his ankle imme
diately preceding the track season. He com
peted in a few meets, but was never at
his best physically. His best jump was 6-
foot-9 before he again sprained his ankle.
The second sprain forced him to miss the
crucial late-season meets.
"Athletics during freshman year was a
learning experience," Hopkins said. "I was
still learning how to manage my time be
tween school and sports."

This year, Hopkins is also the punter
for the football team, doubling his worth
to the squad. He is having a good year as
a kicker, but has at times found the team's
problems ungratifying.
"It is frustrating. Losing all of those
close games takes the spark out," Hopkins
said.
Despite those feelings, Hopkins has
definitely had some highlights this season.
Kicking a 52-yard field goal against
Oregon, playing on national television
against USC and tying the school record
for field goals in a game (four) last week
against Washington are his favorite per
sonal football accomplishments.
Hopkins' goals for the team in his
remaining years at Stanford are to start
generating winning seasons and to make
the Rose Bowl. He describes the team as
"young, talented and close to being an
excellent one."
His personal goals are to be named to
the All Pacific-10 Conference team and to
average over 40 yards per punt. The eco
nomics major hopes to kick in the National
Football League and is considering law
school. With Hopkins aboard, a series of
winning seasons and a trip to the coveted
Rose Bowl may be well within the Cardi
nal's realm of possibility.

Kicking a 52-yard field
goal against Oregon,
playing on national tele
vision against USC, and
tying the school record
for field goals in a game
(four last week against
Washington) are Hop
kins' favorite football
accomplishments
