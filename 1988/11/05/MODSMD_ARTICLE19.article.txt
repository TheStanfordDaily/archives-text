# Aussies and Elvis

There's frost on the pumpkin
and a popcorn ball lodged in
my esophagus. It must be the
last home game.
The Band's pregame show
will revolve around the ques
tion of Elvis Presley. The ques
tion is not "What would Elvis
be doing if he were alive
today?" but rather, "What IS
Elvis doing now?" Well, we
have a few theories.
His wisest move would of
course be to take up work as
an Elvis impersonator. Should
that fail, he could also become
a hairdresser, passing on his
own coiffure from generation
to generation, or a hula hoop

tester. At any rate, there is no
doubt in our minds that ELVIS
LIVES.
At halftime, we will present
something that you have been
waiting for all year. Yes, it's
the Band's Slide Show from
Australia. First, we will form
a satellite photo that our pho
tographer Robbie "Buzz"
Beyers took of the continent.
Next, our first lesson in
Australian slang, as the Band
spells "G'Day." And finally, a
tribute to the lovely Sydney
Opera House, where we played
last summer to the consterna
tion of fine arts fans every
where.
