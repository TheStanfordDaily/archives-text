# Stanford set to battle upset-happy WSU
## 
### David Earnest Editorial staff 
So, you want to see a good foot
ball game today, and you're dis
appointed that the only game in
town is the soon-to-be Pacific 10
Conference powerhouse Washing
ton State Cougars against the fal
tering Stanford Cardinal?
Well, stop worrying. This is the
Pac-10. Anything can happen on
any Saturday. Any team can beat
any other team.
For instance, WSU, with a 4-2
record after losing at home to un
derdog Arizona State the previous
Saturday, went into the Rose Bowl
last weekend and upset college
football's top-ranked team, the
UCLA Bruins, 34-30.
The same day, Stanford lost to
Washington, 28-25, in Seattle in
spite of a school-record 220 yards
from Cardinal fullback Jon Volpe,
454 yards in total team offense,
and a plus-three turnover ratio
for the day. The Cardinal out
rushed the Huskies 234 yards to
217, outpassed them 220 yards to
182, had three more total first
downs as well as more return yar
dage, and still lost.
Yes, football in the nation's
toughest conference (the Pac-10
is currently 26-4 against non
league opponents) can certainly be
strange.

With 110 gimmies in this league,
today's game may be full of
surprises. Both WSU and Stan
ford's seasons have certainly had
several.
WSU may indeed be the con
ference's surprise team. Picked
before the season to finish ninth
in the Pac-10 (by The Sporting
News, Don Heinrich's College
Football 'BB and Street & Smith's
College Football), the Cougars had
exceeded almost everybody's
projected record by the fourth
game of the season. The team ex
ploded early in the season to score
a total of 137 points in three road
victories against Illinois, Minne
sota and Tennessee.
By Oct. 8, WSU had shocked
everyone, compiling a 4-1 record
under the guidance of second year
coach Dennis Erickson. On Octo

ber 15, the Cougars surprised
everyone again ... by losing to
Arizona State at home.
The next weekend, junior quar
terback Timm Rosenbach and
junior slotback Tim Stallworth
connected on an 80-yard pass to
score the touchdown that toppled
UCLA.
Yes, the Cougars have been a
difficult team to predict this year.
Stanford, on the other hand,
has performed painfully consis
tently in 1988. On Sept. 10,
leading the fifth-ranked USC
Trojans 20-17 in the fourth quar
ter with a first-and-goal on the
Trojan two-yard line, the Cardinal
was unable to score and eventually
lost the game 24-20.
Two weeks later, Stanford lost
to Oregon 7-3 when its offense
was unable to drive on Oregon's
defense. Last week, the Cardinal
was unable to score a touchdown
on four separate drives inside
Washington's 20-yard line and
lost the game by three points.
Washington State is bewildered.
Stanford is simply frustrated.
"We've had some ups and downs
this season," Erickson said.
"Losing to Arizona State at home
was a down. Beating UCLA was
the up. It's going to be like this
(in this conference.)"
Stanford Coach Jack Elway
feels the frustration of the Car
dinal's lost opportunities. "We
could have had more points
(against Washington). Those are
the toughest 10 yards in football.
If I had to (call the plays) all over
again, I would do it differently"
For today's game at Stanford
Stadium, the question is will the
Cougar defense be able to stop
Stanford's run-and-shoot offense
from scoring too many points for
quarterback Rosenbach and the
talented WSU offense to make up?
The Cougars' multiple-style of
fense will attack Stanford-using,
several talented players. Leading
WSU this year is Rosenbach, the
Pac-10's leader in total offense
with an average of 302.9 yards
per game, as well as the nation's
leader in passing efficiency with
a mark of 174.8. The junior is
also currently third nationally in
total yards. All of these ac
complishments are especially sig
nificant considering that
Rosenbach was the Pac-10's
lowest rated quarterback last
year.
"Timm understands the offense
better this year," Erickson said.

"The experience factor has made
all the difference."
Not surprisingly, slotback Stal
lworth is reaping the benefits of
Rosenbach's outstanding year.
Stallworth is currently con
ference's third leading receiver
with an average of 5.4 receptions
a game.
Erickson understands Stal
lworth's. importance to the
Cougar offense. "He's the kind of
guy we need in our offense to
execute the things we want to,"
he said.
When the Cougars aren't throw
ing the ball, the rushing attack
can carve out yards with equal
prowess. Running back Steve
Broussard is currently the Pac
10's leader in rushing (133 yards
per game) and all-purpose run

ning (166.4), but he is sidelined
and will not play today Backup
running back Rich Swinton, a
sophomore, is averaging 73.4
yards per game after tallying 117
yards against UCLA arid 193
against ASU.
Elway expects that the Cougars
may very well have Swinton run
the sweeps that Notre Dame,
Oregon State, and Washington
have run succesfully against Stan
ford this year. "The thing that is
going to haunt us until we get
linebackers up the field is the
sweep," he said.
WSU's talented corps of players
at the skill positions have
produced one of the nation's top
offenses. After 427 yards against
the Bruins last week, the Cougar
offense is averaging 510.1 yards

per game and is third in the na
tion in total offense.
Even with this talent, however,
WSU is only 5-3 after the defense
conceded 43 points to Oregon, 45
to Arizona and 31 to . ASU. In
fact, last week's upset of UCLA
was the first game that WSU has
won in the last two seasons with
out scoring 40 points or more.
As if the Cougar defense doesn't
have enough problems, WSU will
play today with a defense riddled
with injuries. Linebacker Keith
Rice will not play and defensive
end Ivan Cook, the Cougars' co
captain, is questionable. Strong
linebacker Maury Metcalf, defen
sive back Shawn Landrum, left
end Randy Gray and backup left

The Cougars have
been a hard team
to predict this year.

tackle Dan Webber are likely to
play in spite of injuries.
WSU's defense, though, can
perform when the pressure is on.
Last week, the Cougars held
UCLA when the Bruins were
going for the winning touchdown
with 44 seconds left and a first
and-goal on the WSU six yard line.
"We blitzed four times in a row
and got pressure in his (UCLA
quarterback Troy Aikman's)
face," Erickson said. "We played
man coverage and just came up
with the big play."
Stanford's offense, therefore,
will need a big game against a
weakened defense. With redshirt
freshman quarterback Jason
Palumbis adjusting to the Cardi
nal's run-and-shoot offense, Stan
ford's passing attack should more
effectively complement the out
standing rushing of fullback Jon

Volpe this week. Against Wash
ington, Palumbis was 19-of-40 for
220 yards and two touchdowns
with only one interception. All
four of the Cougars' defensive
backs, however, are seniors and
will challenge Palumbis.
Volpe may be the biggest threat
to WSU today. After his record
setting performance against
Washington, Volpe is within 141
yards of registering 1,000 yards
for the season, and is well within
reach of the Stanford single
season rushing mark of 1,069
yards (set by Darrin Nelson in
1977).
Running behind Stanford's ex
perienced front five of Robbie Cof
fin, Andy Papathanassiou, Andy
Sinclair, Chuck Gillingham and
John Zentner, Volpe and backup
fullback Scott Eschelman may see
daylight through the injury
plagued WSU defensive line.
Defensively, Elway will face an
offense constructed by Erickson,
a former assistant of his at San
Jose State. "Jack had a tremen
dous influence on what we do of
fensively," Erickson said.
Stanford's defensive line will
need to pressure Rosenbach to
keep WSU's passing attack in
check, and its linebackers must

contain Swinton. The Cardinal
pass defense has been exceptional
this year. Cornerbacks Alan Grant
and Brad Cook, strong safety Rob
Englehardt and linebacker Jono
Tunney have three interceptions
apiece this year. The Englehardt
vs. Stall worth matchup may be
pivotal to the outcome.
Stanford and WSU match up
well on special teams. Cardinal
placekicker John Hopkins kicked
four field goals against Washing
ton last week to tie a school
record. He has hit a respectable
14-of-19 attempts this season, in
cluding the last seven in a row,
and is perfect on his 19 point
after-touchdown attempts this
season.
Elway appreciates Hopkins' im
portance to the team. "When we
don't get into the end zone, it's
important for us to come away
with the (three) points."
The Cardinal's punting has im
proved considerably since the first
four games. Hopkins won the
punting job from Jeff Blaisdell be
tween the fourth and fifth games
and has improved his average to
35.1 yards a punt.
WSU's special teams are com
parable to Stanford's. Freshman
placekicker Jason Hanson is 7-

for-10 in field goal attempts this
year. Punter Rob Myers has
averaged 36.7 yards per punt over
28 boots this year.
Neither team has exceptional

kick-coverage or kick-return spt
cial team units. Stanford's Ala

year in average yards per punt
return, may be able to exploit
WSU's coverage, which has given
up 10.4 yards per punt (including
one touchdown) this season.
WSU's Rich Swinton is a threat
on kickoff returns, averaging 22
yards per return.
Stanford hopes that today it will
be able to improve on its 3-1-1
home record with the season's
final home appearance for the
Cardinal. Fifteen seniors who will
be playing in their final home
game would like to end their Stan
ford's careers with a victory. The
seniors are Coffin, Spencer Cot
ten, Greg Ennis, Henry Green,
Ray Huckestein, Pat Kelly, John
Mahoney, Barry McKeever, Mike
Newton, Kevin Richardson,
Sinclair, John Summers, Rick

Theder, Steve Weber and Zentner.
While this game holds no par
ticular postseason significance for
Stanford, the Cougars, at 5-3 with
two home games remaining, are
very much in the running for a
bowl bid. This remarkable feat,
however, for a program that was
3-7-1 last year and was projected
to finish 2-9 this year, has not
raised the hopes of a cautious
Erickson.
"They talked about it two weeks
ago and we got beat. Right now,
we just want to have a winning
season. We'll consider bowls after
the next (two) weeks," Erickson
said.
WSU's hopes of playing on New
Year's Day may not be rosy, but
after today, the Cougars hope that
their chances will be j greatly im
proved and that bowl committees
will realize that their season is
not as big a surprise as the "ex
perts" have made it out to be.

won in the last two seasons with
out scoring 40 points or more.
As if the Cougar defense doesn't
have enough problems, WSU will
play today with a defense riddled
with injuries. Linebacker Keith
Rice will not play and defensive

tackle Dan Webber are likely to
play in spite of injuries.
WSU's defense, though, can
perform when the pressure is on.
Last week, the Cougars held
UCLA when the Bruins were
going for the winning touchdown
with 44 seconds left and a first
and-goal on the WSU six yard line.
"We blitzed four times in a row
and got pressure in his (UCLA
quarterback Troy Aikman's)
face," Erickson said. "We played
man coverage and just came up
with the big play."
Stanford's offense, therefore,
will need a big game against a
weakened defense. With redshirt
freshman quarterback Jason
Palumbis adjusting to the Cardi
nal's run-and-shoot offense, Stan
ford's passing attack should more
effectively complement the out
standing rushing of fullback Jon

Volpe this week. Against Wash
ington, Palumbis was 19-of-40 for
220 yards and two touchdowns
with only one interception. All
four of the Cougars' defensive
backs, however, are seniors and
will challenge Palumbis.
Volpe may be the biggest threat
to WSU today. After his record
setting performance against
Washington, Volpe is within 141
yards of registering 1,000 yards
for the season, and is well within
reach of the Stanford single
season rushing mark of 1,069
yards (set by Darrin Nelson in
1977).
Running behind Stanford's ex
perienced front five of Robbie Cof
fin, Andy Papathanassiou, Andy
Sinclair, Chuck Gillingham and
John Zentner, Volpe and backup
fullback Scott Eschelman may see
daylight through the injury
plagued WSU defensive line.
Defensively, Elway will face an
offense constructed by Erickson,
a former assistant of his at San
Jose State. "Jack had a tremen
dous influence on what we do of
fensively," Erickson said.
Stanford's defensive line will
need to pressure Rosenbach to
keep WSU's passing attack in
check, and its linebackers must

contain Swinton. The Cardinal
pass defense has been exceptional
this year. Cornerbacks Alan Grant
and Brad Cook, strong safety Rob
Englehardt and linebacker Jono
Tunney have three interceptions
apiece this year. The Englehardt
vs. Stall worth matchup may be
pivotal to the outcome.
Stanford and WSU match up
well on special teams. Cardinal
placekicker John Hopkins kicked
four field goals against Washing
ton last week to tie a school
record. He has hit a respectable
14-of-19 attempts this season, in
cluding the last seven in a row,
and is perfect on his 19 point
after-touchdown attempts this
season.
Elway appreciates Hopkins' im
portance to the team. "When we
don't get into the end zone, it's
important for us to come away
with the (three) points."
The Cardinal's punting has im
proved considerably since the first
four games. Hopkins won the
punting job from Jeff Blaisdell be
tween the fourth and fifth games
and has improved his average to
35.1 yards a punt.
WSU's special teams are com
parable to Stanford's. Freshman
placekicker Jason Hanson is 7-

for-10 in field goal attempts this
year. Punter Rob Myers has
averaged 36.7 yards per punt over
28 boots this year.

WSU's coverage, which has given
up 10.4 yards per punt (including
one touchdown) this season.
WSU's Rich Swinton is a threat
on kickoff returns, averaging 22
yards per return.
Stanford hopes that today it will
be able to improve on its 3-1-1
home record with the season's
final home appearance for the
Cardinal. Fifteen seniors who will
be playing in their final home
game would like to end their Stan
ford's careers with a victory. The
seniors are Coffin, Spencer Cot
ten, Greg Ennis, Henry Green,
Ray Huckestein, Pat Kelly, John
Mahoney, Barry McKeever, Mike
Newton, Kevin Richardson,
Sinclair, John Summers, Rick

Theder, Steve Weber and Zentner.
While this game holds no par
ticular postseason significance for
Stanford, the Cougars, at 5-3 with
two home games remaining, are
very much in the running for a
bowl bid. This remarkable feat,
however, for a program that was
3-7-1 last year and was projected
to finish 2-9 this year, has not
raised the hopes of a cautious
Erickson.
"They talked about it two weeks
ago and we got beat. Right now,
we just want to have a winning
season. We'll consider bowls after
the next (two) weeks," Erickson
said.
WSU's hopes of playing on New
Year's Day may not be rosy, but
after today, the Cougars hope that
their chances will be j greatly im
proved and that bowl committees
will realize that their season is
not as big a surprise as the "ex
perts" have made it out to be.
So, you want to see a good foot
ball game today, and you're dis
appointed that the only game in
town is the soon-to-be Pacific 10
Conference powerhouse Washing
ton State Cougars against the fal
tering Stanford Cardinal?
Well, stop worrying. This is the
Pac-10. Anything can happen on
any Saturday. Any team can beat
any other team.
For instance, WSU, with a 4-2
record after losing at home to un
derdog Arizona State the previous
Saturday, went into the Rose Bowl
last weekend and upset college
football's top-ranked team, the
UCLA Bruins, 34-30.
The same day, Stanford lost to
Washington, 28-25, in Seattle in
spite of a school-record 220 yards
from Cardinal fullback Jon Volpe,
454 yards in total team offense,
and a plus-three turnover ratio
for the day. The Cardinal out
rushed the Huskies 234 yards to
217, outpassed them 220 yards to
182, had three more total first
downs as well as more return yar
dage, and still lost.
Yes, football in the nation's
toughest conference (the Pac-10
is currently 26-4 against non
league opponents) can certainly be
strange.

With 110 gimmies in this league,
today's game may be full of
surprises. Both WSU and Stan
ford's seasons have certainly had
several.
WSU may indeed be the con
ference's surprise team. Picked
before the season to finish ninth
in the Pac-10 (by The Sporting
News, Don Heinrich's College
Football 'BB and Street & Smith's
College Football), the Cougars had
exceeded almost everybody's
projected record by the fourth
game of the season. The team ex
ploded early in the season to score
a total of 137 points in three road
victories against Illinois, Minne
sota and Tennessee.
By Oct. 8, WSU had shocked
everyone, compiling a 4-1 record
under the guidance of second year
coach Dennis Erickson. On Octo

ber 15, the Cougars surprised
everyone again ... by losing to
Arizona State at home.
The next weekend, junior quar
terback Timm Rosenbach and
junior slotback Tim Stallworth
connected on an 80-yard pass to
score the touchdown that toppled
UCLA.
Yes, the Cougars have been a
difficult team to predict this year.
Stanford, on the other hand,
has performed painfully consis
tently in 1988. On Sept. 10,
leading the fifth-ranked USC
Trojans 20-17 in the fourth quar
ter with a first-and-goal on the
Trojan two-yard line, the Cardinal
was unable to score and eventually
lost the game 24-20.
Two weeks later, Stanford lost
to Oregon 7-3 when its offense
was unable to drive on Oregon's
defense. Last week, the Cardinal
was unable to score a touchdown
on four separate drives inside
Washington's 20-yard line and
lost the game by three points.
Washington State is bewildered.
Stanford is simply frustrated.
"We've had some ups and downs
this season," Erickson said.
"Losing to Arizona State at home
was a down. Beating UCLA was
the up. It's going to be like this
(in this conference.)"
Stanford Coach Jack Elway
feels the frustration of the Car
dinal's lost opportunities. "We
could have had more points
(against Washington). Those are
the toughest 10 yards in football.
If I had to (call the plays) all over
again, I would do it differently"
For today's game at Stanford
Stadium, the question is will the
Cougar defense be able to stop
Stanford's run-and-shoot offense
from scoring too many points for
quarterback Rosenbach and the
talented WSU offense to make up?
The Cougars' multiple-style of
fense will attack Stanford-using,
several talented players. Leading
WSU this year is Rosenbach, the
Pac-10's leader in total offense
with an average of 302.9 yards
per game, as well as the nation's
leader in passing efficiency with
a mark of 174.8. The junior is
also currently third nationally in
total yards. All of these ac
complishments are especially sig
nificant considering that
Rosenbach was the Pac-10's
lowest rated quarterback last
year.
"Timm understands the offense
better this year," Erickson said.

"The experience factor has made
all the difference."
Not surprisingly, slotback Stal
lworth is reaping the benefits of
Rosenbach's outstanding year.
Stallworth is currently con
ference's third leading receiver
with an average of 5.4 receptions
a game.
Erickson understands Stal
lworth's. importance to the
Cougar offense. "He's the kind of
guy we need in our offense to
execute the things we want to,"
he said.
When the Cougars aren't throw
ing the ball, the rushing attack
can carve out yards with equal
prowess. Running back Steve
Broussard is currently the Pac
10's leader in rushing (133 yards
per game) and all-purpose run

ning (166.4), but he is sidelined
and will not play today Backup
running back Rich Swinton, a
sophomore, is averaging 73.4
yards per game after tallying 117
yards against UCLA arid 193
against ASU.
Elway expects that the Cougars
may very well have Swinton run
the sweeps that Notre Dame,
Oregon State, and Washington
have run succesfully against Stan
ford this year. "The thing that is
going to haunt us until we get
linebackers up the field is the
sweep," he said.
WSU's talented corps of players
at the skill positions have
produced one of the nation's top
offenses. After 427 yards against
the Bruins last week, the Cougar
offense is averaging 510.1 yards

per game and is third in the na
tion in total offense.
Even with this talent, however,
WSU is only 5-3 after the defense
conceded 43 points to Oregon, 45
to Arizona and 31 to . ASU. In
fact, last week's upset of UCLA
was the first game that WSU has
won in the last two seasons with
out scoring 40 points or more.
As if the Cougar defense doesn't
have enough problems, WSU will
play today with a defense riddled

any Saturday. Any team can beat
any other team.
For instance, WSU, with a 4-2
record after losing at home to un
derdog Arizona State the previous
Saturday, went into the Rose Bowl
last weekend and upset college
football's top-ranked team, the
UCLA Bruins, 34-30.
The same day, Stanford lost to
Washington, 28-25, in Seattle in
spite of a school-record 220 yards
from Cardinal fullback Jon Volpe,
454 yards in total team offense,
and a plus-three turnover ratio
for the day. The Cardinal out
rushed the Huskies 234 yards to
217, outpassed them 220 yards to
182, had three more total first
downs as well as more return yar
dage, and still lost.
Yes, football in the nation's
toughest conference (the Pac-10
is currently 26-4 against non
league opponents) can certainly be
strange.

With 110 gimmies in this league,
today's game may be full of
surprises. Both WSU and Stan
ford's seasons have certainly had
several.
WSU may indeed be the con
ference's surprise team. Picked
before the season to finish ninth
in the Pac-10 (by The Sporting
News, Don Heinrich's College
Football 'BB and Street & Smith's
College Football), the Cougars had
exceeded almost everybody's
projected record by the fourth
game of the season. The team ex
ploded early in the season to score
a total of 137 points in three road
victories against Illinois, Minne
sota and Tennessee.
By Oct. 8, WSU had shocked
everyone, compiling a 4-1 record
under the guidance of second year
coach Dennis Erickson. On Octo

ber 15, the Cougars surprised
everyone again ... by losing to
Arizona State at home.
The next weekend, junior quar
terback Timm Rosenbach and
junior slotback Tim Stallworth
connected on an 80-yard pass to
score the touchdown that toppled
UCLA.
Yes, the Cougars have been a
difficult team to predict this year.
Stanford, on the other hand,
has performed painfully consis
tently in 1988. On Sept. 10,
leading the fifth-ranked USC
Trojans 20-17 in the fourth quar
ter with a first-and-goal on the
Trojan two-yard line, the Cardinal
was unable to score and eventually
lost the game 24-20.
Two weeks later, Stanford lost
to Oregon 7-3 when its offense
was unable to drive on Oregon's
defense. Last week, the Cardinal
was unable to score a touchdown
on four separate drives inside
Washington's 20-yard line and
lost the game by three points.
Washington State is bewildered.
Stanford is simply frustrated.
"We've had some ups and downs
this season," Erickson said.
"Losing to Arizona State at home
was a down. Beating UCLA was
the up. It's going to be like this
(in this conference.)"
Stanford Coach Jack Elway
feels the frustration of the Car
dinal's lost opportunities. "We
could have had more points
(against Washington). Those are
the toughest 10 yards in football.
If I had to (call the plays) all over
again, I would do it differently"
For today's game at Stanford
Stadium, the question is will the
Cougar defense be able to stop
Stanford's run-and-shoot offense
from scoring too many points for
quarterback Rosenbach and the
talented WSU offense to make up?
The Cougars' multiple-style of
fense will attack Stanford-using,
several talented players. Leading
WSU this year is Rosenbach, the
Pac-10's leader in total offense
with an average of 302.9 yards
per game, as well as the nation's
leader in passing efficiency with
a mark of 174.8. The junior is
also currently third nationally in
total yards. All of these ac
complishments are especially sig
nificant considering that
Rosenbach was the Pac-10's
lowest rated quarterback last
year.
"Timm understands the offense
better this year," Erickson said.

"The experience factor has made
all the difference."
Not surprisingly, slotback Stal
lworth is reaping the benefits of
Rosenbach's outstanding year.
Stallworth is currently con
ference's third leading receiver
with an average of 5.4 receptions
a game.
Erickson understands Stal
lworth's. importance to the
Cougar offense. "He's the kind of
guy we need in our offense to
execute the things we want to,"
he said.
When the Cougars aren't throw
ing the ball, the rushing attack
can carve out yards with equal
prowess. Running back Steve
Broussard is currently the Pac
10's leader in rushing (133 yards
per game) and all-purpose run

ning (166.4), but he is sidelined
and will not play today Backup
running back Rich Swinton, a
sophomore, is averaging 73.4
yards per game after tallying 117
yards against UCLA arid 193
against ASU.
Elway expects that the Cougars
may very well have Swinton run
the sweeps that Notre Dame,
Oregon State, and Washington
have run succesfully against Stan
ford this year. "The thing that is
going to haunt us until we get
linebackers up the field is the
sweep," he said.
WSU's talented corps of players
at the skill positions have
produced one of the nation's top
offenses. After 427 yards against
the Bruins last week, the Cougar
offense is averaging 510.1 yards

per game and is third in the na
tion in total offense.
Even with this talent, however,
WSU is only 5-3 after the defense
conceded 43 points to Oregon, 45
to Arizona and 31 to . ASU. In
fact, last week's upset of UCLA
was the first game that WSU has
won in the last two seasons with
out scoring 40 points or more.
As if the Cougar defense doesn't
have enough problems, WSU will
play today with a defense riddled
with injuries. Linebacker Keith
Rice will not play and defensive
end Ivan Cook, the Cougars' co
captain, is questionable. Strong
linebacker Maury Metcalf, defen
sive back Shawn Landrum, left

The Cougars have
been a hard team
to predict this year.

tackle Dan Webber are likely to
play in spite of injuries.
WSU's defense, though, can
perform when the pressure is on.
Last week, the Cougars held
UCLA when the Bruins were
going for the winning touchdown
with 44 seconds left and a first
and-goal on the WSU six yard line.
"We blitzed four times in a row
and got pressure in his (UCLA
quarterback Troy Aikman's)
face," Erickson said. "We played
man coverage and just came up
with the big play."
Stanford's offense, therefore,
will need a big game against a
weakened defense. With redshirt
freshman quarterback Jason
Palumbis adjusting to the Cardi
nal's run-and-shoot offense, Stan
ford's passing attack should more
effectively complement the out
standing rushing of fullback Jon

Volpe this week. Against Wash
ington, Palumbis was 19-of-40 for
220 yards and two touchdowns
with only one interception. All
four of the Cougars' defensive
backs, however, are seniors and
will challenge Palumbis.
Volpe may be the biggest threat
to WSU today. After his record
setting performance against
Washington, Volpe is within 141
yards of registering 1,000 yards
for the season, and is well within
reach of the Stanford single
season rushing mark of 1,069
yards (set by Darrin Nelson in
1977).
Running behind Stanford's ex
perienced front five of Robbie Cof
fin, Andy Papathanassiou, Andy
Sinclair, Chuck Gillingham and
John Zentner, Volpe and backup
fullback Scott Eschelman may see
daylight through the injury
plagued WSU defensive line.
Defensively, Elway will face an
offense constructed by Erickson,
a former assistant of his at San
Jose State. "Jack had a tremen
dous influence on what we do of
fensively," Erickson said.
Stanford's defensive line will
need to pressure Rosenbach to
keep WSU's passing attack in
check, and its linebackers must

contain Swinton. The Cardinal
pass defense has been exceptional
this year. Cornerbacks Alan Grant
and Brad Cook, strong safety Rob
Englehardt and linebacker Jono
Tunney have three interceptions
apiece this year. The Englehardt
vs. Stall worth matchup may be
pivotal to the outcome.
Stanford and WSU match up
well on special teams. Cardinal
placekicker John Hopkins kicked
four field goals against Washing
ton last week to tie a school
record. He has hit a respectable
14-of-19 attempts this season, in
cluding the last seven in a row,
and is perfect on his 19 point
after-touchdown attempts this
season.
Elway appreciates Hopkins' im
portance to the team. "When we
don't get into the end zone, it's
important for us to come away
with the (three) points."
The Cardinal's punting has im
proved considerably since the first
four games. Hopkins won the
punting job from Jeff Blaisdell be
tween the fourth and fifth games
and has improved his average to
35.1 yards a punt.
WSU's special teams are com
parable to Stanford's. Freshman
placekicker Jason Hanson is 7-

for-10 in field goal attempts this
year. Punter Rob Myers has
averaged 36.7 yards per punt over
28 boots this year.
Neither team has exceptional

kick-coverage or kick-return spt

year in average yards per punt
return, may be able to exploit
WSU's coverage, which has given
up 10.4 yards per punt (including
one touchdown) this season.
WSU's Rich Swinton is a threat
on kickoff returns, averaging 22
yards per return.
Stanford hopes that today it will
be able to improve on its 3-1-1
home record with the season's
final home appearance for the
Cardinal. Fifteen seniors who will
be playing in their final home
game would like to end their Stan
ford's careers with a victory. The
seniors are Coffin, Spencer Cot
ten, Greg Ennis, Henry Green,
Ray Huckestein, Pat Kelly, John
Mahoney, Barry McKeever, Mike
Newton, Kevin Richardson,
Sinclair, John Summers, Rick

Theder, Steve Weber and Zentner.
While this game holds no par
ticular postseason significance for
Stanford, the Cougars, at 5-3 with
two home games remaining, are
very much in the running for a
bowl bid. This remarkable feat,
however, for a program that was
3-7-1 last year and was projected
to finish 2-9 this year, has not
raised the hopes of a cautious
Erickson.
"They talked about it two weeks
ago and we got beat. Right now,
we just want to have a winning
season. We'll consider bowls after
the next (two) weeks," Erickson
said.
WSU's hopes of playing on New
Year's Day may not be rosy, but
after today, the Cougars hope that
their chances will be j greatly im
proved and that bowl committees
will realize that their season is
not as big a surprise as the "ex
perts" have made it out to be.
So, you want to see a good foot
ball game today, and you're dis
appointed that the only game in
town is the soon-to-be Pacific 10
Conference powerhouse Washing
ton State Cougars against the fal
tering Stanford Cardinal?
Well, stop worrying. This is the
Pac-10. Anything can happen on

Stanford senior tight end Jim Price has caught two touchdown passes this season, which ties him
with wide receiver Henry Green for the team lead.
tackle Dan Webber are likely to
play in spite of injuries.
WSU's defense, though, can
perform when the pressure is on.
Last week, the Cougars held
UCLA when the Bruins were
going for the winning touchdown
with 44 seconds left and a first
and-goal on the WSU six yard line.
"We blitzed four times in a row
and got pressure in his (UCLA
quarterback Troy Aikman's)
face," Erickson said. "We played
man coverage and just came up
with the big play."
Stanford's offense, therefore,
will need a big game against a
weakened defense. With redshirt
freshman quarterback Jason
Palumbis adjusting to the Cardi
nal's run-and-shoot offense, Stan
ford's passing attack should more
effectively complement the out
standing rushing of fullback Jon

Volpe this week. Against Wash
ington, Palumbis was 19-of-40 for
220 yards and two touchdowns
with only one interception. All
four of the Cougars' defensive
backs, however, are seniors and
will challenge Palumbis.
Volpe may be the biggest threat
to WSU today. After his record
setting performance against
Washington, Volpe is within 141
yards of registering 1,000 yards
for the season, and is well within
reach of the Stanford single
season rushing mark of 1,069
yards (set by Darrin Nelson in
1977).
Running behind Stanford's ex
perienced front five of Robbie Cof
fin, Andy Papathanassiou, Andy
Sinclair, Chuck Gillingham and
John Zentner, Volpe and backup
fullback Scott Eschelman may see
daylight through the injury
plagued WSU defensive line.
Defensively, Elway will face an
offense constructed by Erickson,
a former assistant of his at San
Jose State. "Jack had a tremen
dous influence on what we do of
fensively," Erickson said.
Stanford's defensive line will
need to pressure Rosenbach to
keep WSU's passing attack in
check, and its linebackers must

contain Swinton. The Cardinal
pass defense has been exceptional
this year. Cornerbacks Alan Grant
and Brad Cook, strong safety Rob
Englehardt and linebacker Jono
Tunney have three interceptions
apiece this year. The Englehardt
vs. Stall worth matchup may be
pivotal to the outcome.
Stanford and WSU match up
well on special teams. Cardinal
placekicker John Hopkins kicked
four field goals against Washing
ton last week to tie a school
record. He has hit a respectable
14-of-19 attempts this season, in
cluding the last seven in a row,
and is perfect on his 19 point
after-touchdown attempts this
season.
Elway appreciates Hopkins' im
portance to the team. "When we
don't get into the end zone, it's
important for us to come away
with the (three) points."
The Cardinal's punting has im
proved considerably since the first
four games. Hopkins won the
punting job from Jeff Blaisdell be
tween the fourth and fifth games
and has improved his average to
35.1 yards a punt.
WSU's special teams are com
parable to Stanford's. Freshman
placekicker Jason Hanson is 7-

for-10 in field goal attempts this
year. Punter Rob Myers has
averaged 36.7 yards per punt over
28 boots this year.

year in average yards per punt
return, may be able to exploit
WSU's coverage, which has given
up 10.4 yards per punt (including
one touchdown) this season.
WSU's Rich Swinton is a threat
on kickoff returns, averaging 22
yards per return.
Stanford hopes that today it will
be able to improve on its 3-1-1
home record with the season's
final home appearance for the
Cardinal. Fifteen seniors who will
be playing in their final home
game would like to end their Stan
ford's careers with a victory. The
seniors are Coffin, Spencer Cot
ten, Greg Ennis, Henry Green,
Ray Huckestein, Pat Kelly, John
Mahoney, Barry McKeever, Mike
Newton, Kevin Richardson,
Sinclair, John Summers, Rick

Theder, Steve Weber and Zentner.
While this game holds no par
ticular postseason significance for
Stanford, the Cougars, at 5-3 with
two home games remaining, are
very much in the running for a
bowl bid. This remarkable feat,
however, for a program that was
3-7-1 last year and was projected
to finish 2-9 this year, has not
raised the hopes of a cautious
Erickson.
"They talked about it two weeks
ago and we got beat. Right now,
we just want to have a winning
season. We'll consider bowls after
the next (two) weeks," Erickson
said.
WSU's hopes of playing on New
Year's Day may not be rosy, but
after today, the Cougars hope that
their chances will be j greatly im
proved and that bowl committees
will realize that their season is
not as big a surprise as the "ex
perts" have made it out to be.
