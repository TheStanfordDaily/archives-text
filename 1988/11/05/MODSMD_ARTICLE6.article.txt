# Stanford set to battle upset-happy WSU
## 
### David Earnest Editorial staff 
So, you want to see a good foot
ball game today, and you're dis
appointed that the only game in
town is the soon-to-be Pacific 10
Conference powerhouse Washing
ton State Cougars against the fal
tering Stanford Cardinal?
Well, stop worrying. This is the
Pac-10. Anything can happen on
any Saturday. Any team can beat
any other team.
For instance, WSU, with a 4-2
record after losing at home to un
derdog Arizona State the previous
Saturday, went into the Rose Bowl
last weekend and upset college
football's top-ranked team, the
UCLA Bruins, 34-30.
The same day, Stanford lost to
Washington, 28-25, in Seattle in
spite of a school-record 220 yards
from Cardinal fullback Jon Volpe,
454 yards in total team offense,
and a plus-three turnover ratio
for the day. The Cardinal out
rushed the Huskies 234 yards to
217, outpassed them 220 yards to
182, had three more total first
downs as well as more return yar
dage, and still lost.
Yes, football in the nation's
toughest conference (the Pac-10
is currently 26-4 against non
league opponents) can certainly be
strange.

With 110 gimmies in this league,
today's game may be full of
surprises. Both WSU and Stan
ford's seasons have certainly had
several.
WSU may indeed be the con
ference's surprise team. Picked
before the season to finish ninth
in the Pac-10 (by The Sporting
News, Don Heinrich's College
Football 'BB and Street & Smith's
College Football), the Cougars had
exceeded almost everybody's
projected record by the fourth
game of the season. The team ex
ploded early in the season to score
a total of 137 points in three road
victories against Illinois, Minne
sota and Tennessee.
By Oct. 8, WSU had shocked
everyone, compiling a 4-1 record
under the guidance of second year
coach Dennis Erickson. On Octo

ber 15, the Cougars surprised
everyone again ... by losing to
Arizona State at home.
The next weekend, junior quar
terback Timm Rosenbach and
junior slotback Tim Stallworth
connected on an 80-yard pass to
score the touchdown that toppled
UCLA.
Yes, the Cougars have been a
difficult team to predict this year.
Stanford, on the other hand,
has performed painfully consis
tently in 1988. On Sept. 10,
leading the fifth-ranked USC
Trojans 20-17 in the fourth quar
ter with a first-and-goal on the
Trojan two-yard line, the Cardinal
was unable to score and eventually
lost the game 24-20.
Two weeks later, Stanford lost
to Oregon 7-3 when its offense
was unable to drive on Oregon's
defense. Last week, the Cardinal
was unable to score a touchdown
on four separate drives inside
Washington's 20-yard line and
lost the game by three points.
Washington State is bewildered.
Stanford is simply frustrated.
"We've had some ups and downs
this season," Erickson said.
"Losing to Arizona State at home
was a down. Beating UCLA was
the up. It's going to be like this
(in this conference.)"
Stanford Coach Jack Elway
feels the frustration of the Car
dinal's lost opportunities. "We
could have had more points
(against Washington). Those are
the toughest 10 yards in football.
If I had to (call the plays) all over
again, I would do it differently"
For today's game at Stanford
Stadium, the question is will the
Cougar defense be able to stop
Stanford's run-and-shoot offense
from scoring too many points for
quarterback Rosenbach and the
talented WSU offense to make up?
The Cougars' multiple-style of
fense will attack Stanford-using,
several talented players. Leading
WSU this year is Rosenbach, the
Pac-10's leader in total offense
with an average of 302.9 yards
per game, as well as the nation's
leader in passing efficiency with
a mark of 174.8. The junior is
also currently third nationally in
total yards. All of these ac
complishments are especially sig
nificant considering that
Rosenbach was the Pac-10's
lowest rated quarterback last
year.
"Timm understands the offense
better this year," Erickson said.

"The experience factor has made
all the difference."
Not surprisingly, slotback Stal
lworth is reaping the benefits of
Rosenbach's outstanding year.
Stallworth is currently con
ference's third leading receiver
with an average of 5.4 receptions
a game.
Erickson understands Stal
lworth's. importance to the
Cougar offense. "He's the kind of
guy we need in our offense to
execute the things we want to,"
he said.
When the Cougars aren't throw
ing the ball, the rushing attack
can carve out yards with equal
prowess. Running back Steve
Broussard is currently the Pac
10's leader in rushing (133 yards
per game) and all-purpose run

ning (166.4), but he is sidelined
and will not play today Backup
running back Rich Swinton, a
sophomore, is averaging 73.4
yards per game after tallying 117
yards against UCLA arid 193
against ASU.
Elway expects that the Cougars
may very well have Swinton run
the sweeps that Notre Dame,
Oregon State, and Washington
have run succesfully against Stan
ford this year. "The thing that is
going to haunt us until we get
linebackers up the field is the
sweep," he said.
WSU's talented corps of players
at the skill positions have
produced one of the nation's top
offenses. After 427 yards against
the Bruins last week, the Cougar
offense is averaging 510.1 yards

per game and is third in the na
tion in total offense.
Even with this talent, however,
WSU is only 5-3 after the defense
conceded 43 points to Oregon, 45
to Arizona and 31 to . ASU. In
fact, last week's upset of UCLA
was the first game that WSU has
won in the last two seasons with
out scoring 40 points or more.
As if the Cougar defense doesn't
have enough problems, WSU will
play today with a defense riddled
with injuries. Linebacker Keith
Rice will not play and defensive
end Ivan Cook, the Cougars' co
captain, is questionable. Strong
linebacker Maury Metcalf, defen
sive back Shawn Landrum, left
end Randy Gray and backup left

The Cougars have
been a hard team
to predict this year.
