# Fullback Volpe belittles mammoth defenses
## 
### Josh Kreinberg 
Who says football is a game for
giants? Certainly not Stanford
fullback Jon Volpe, who, despite
his diminutive 5-foot-7 frame, has
been the key to the Cardinal's
single back offense this season.
The 195-pound "little big man"
has earned a 5.1 yard-per-carry
average, having rushed for a total
of 859 yards on 170 attempts
through Stanford's first eight
games. Volpe's 107.4 rushing
yards per game place him 15th in
the nation and third in the Pacific
10 Conference in that category.
"I use my size for an advan
tage," Volpe said. "When you get
an offensive line like ours and a
huge opposing defensive line, the
inside linebackers have a hell of
a time even seeing me, and I can
slip and slide around back there
while they're trying to find me."
Washington's defense definitely
had a hard time bringing down
the slippery Volpe last weekend
during the Cardinal's 28-25
heartbreaking loss to the Huskies.
Volpe compiled 220 yards on 29
carries, shattering Stanford's 11-
year-old single-game rushing
record of 211 yards set by Darrin
Nelson.
"Volpe had a big day," Stanford
Coach Jack Elway said. "He's a
great little back so you kind of

get used to seeing that out of
him."
"I played pretty well, but the
offensive line did a great job,"
Volpe said. "Elway's play selection
was also a key factor. He did a
good job of keeping Washington
guessing."
With six touchdowns so far this
season, Volpe is the second high
est scorer on the team, behind
placekicker John Hopkins. He
didn't score during the Washing
ton game but came close on a
68-yard run in the fourth quarter
when he was caught from behind
by Husky cornerback Le-Lo Lang.
"I don't have any excuses,"
Volpe said after examining the
play several times. "The guy just
caught me, by that point I was
dead tired."
Aside from the fatigue, the
game didn't seem to affect Volpe,
who is still recovering from a neck
injury that prevents him from any
contact in practice.
"My neck hasn't felt this good
in four weeks," Volpe said in a
press conference Monday. "When
you break a record you don't mind
the pain too much."
Volpe feels that there will be
more record-breaking perform
ances in store for both he and
the team this season as long as
