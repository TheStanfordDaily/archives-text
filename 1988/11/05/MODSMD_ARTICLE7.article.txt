# Fullback Volpe belittles mammoth defenses
## 
### Josh Kreinberg 
Who says football is a game for
giants? Certainly not Stanford
fullback Jon Volpe, who, despite
his diminutive 5-foot-7 frame, has
been the key to the Cardinal's
single back offense this season.
The 195-pound "little big man"
has earned a 5.1 yard-per-carry
average, having rushed for a total
of 859 yards on 170 attempts
through Stanford's first eight
games. Volpe's 107.4 rushing
yards per game place him 15th in
the nation and third in the Pacific
10 Conference in that category.
"I use my size for an advan
tage," Volpe said. "When you get
an offensive line like ours and a
huge opposing defensive line, the
inside linebackers have a hell of
a time even seeing me, and I can
slip and slide around back there
while they're trying to find me."
Washington's defense definitely
had a hard time bringing down
the slippery Volpe last weekend
during the Cardinal's 28-25
heartbreaking loss to the Huskies.
Volpe compiled 220 yards on 29
carries, shattering Stanford's 11-
year-old single-game rushing
record of 211 yards set by Darrin
Nelson.
"Volpe had a big day," Stanford
Coach Jack Elway said. "He's a
great little back so you kind of

get used to seeing that out of
him."
"I played pretty well, but the
offensive line did a great job,"
Volpe said. "Elway's play selection
was also a key factor. He did a
good job of keeping Washington
guessing."
With six touchdowns so far this
season, Volpe is the second high
est scorer on the team, behind
placekicker John Hopkins. He
didn't score during the Washing
ton game but came close on a
68-yard run in the fourth quarter
when he was caught from behind
by Husky cornerback Le-Lo Lang.
"I don't have any excuses,"
Volpe said after examining the
play several times. "The guy just
caught me, by that point I was
dead tired."
Aside from the fatigue, the
game didn't seem to affect Volpe,
who is still recovering from a neck
injury that prevents him from any
contact in practice.
"My neck hasn't felt this good
in four weeks," Volpe said in a
press conference Monday. "When
you break a record you don't mind
the pain too much."
Volpe feels that there will be
more record-breaking perform
ances in store for both he and
the team this season as long as

Junior fullback Jon Volpe, standing only 5-foot-7, ranks 15th in the nation in rushing after having
broken the Stanford single-game rushing record with his 220 yards last week against Washington.
they maintain "a positive atti
tude" and play together as a unit,
he said. The Cardinal may be in
need of some of those perform
ances today when they meet the
Washington State Cougars, a
squad fresh off an upset of UCLA,
formerly the nation's No. 1-
ranked team.
"Washington State's going to be
pumped," Volpe said. "We're
going to have to dig deep into our
character and bounce back and
play a great game."
â€ž The Cardinal has a chance to
make it to a bowl this year, Volpe
said, if they demonstrate their
"explosive offense" with decisive
wins over Washington State,
UCLA and California.
Volpe, a junior, is also looking
forward to next year. "The Rose
Bowl is my goal," Volpe said, "And
anybody who thinks any less
shouldn't be playing on the team.
We've got to go out and set our
minds on winning every game."
After the Rose Bowl, Volpe,
who's leaning towards industrial
or civil engineering as a major but
is currently undeclared, has his
sights set on the National Football
League.
"It [the NFL] is a ways down
the road," Volpe said. "But I don't
know what I'd do without football.
I've dreamt of being in the NFL
since I first started playing when
I was seven years old."
Volpe began his football career
playing youth football in Tucson,
Ariz. He started his first game at
the right guard position and
would have been destined for a
career as an offensive lineman, if
he hadn't discovered during a pre
practice game of "tackle the man
with the ball" that no one could

stop him when he carried it.
Volpe went on to play for Tuc
son's Amphitheater High School
where he garnered three varsity
letters. "Playing varsity as a soph
omore was practially unheard of
at my high school," said Volpe,
who sacrificed a summer trip to
Mexico and spent long hours in
the weight room to earn that
privilege.
"My high school football coach,
Vern Friedli, really turned me
around," Volpe said. "I think I
was lifting more for him than for
myself, but ultimately it made me
a better football player."
At Amphitheater, Volpe proved
himself on the mats as well as
the gridiron, capturing first place
in the Arizona State Wrestling
Championships two years in a
row, winning the 167-pound
weight class as a junior and the
179-pound class as a senior. Volpe
would like to wrestle for Stanford,
but he usually has to spend his
winters recuperating from foot
ball.
Volpe also participated in high
school track where he ran the 100
and 200 yard sprints, as well as
a leg on the 440 yard relay. He
doesn't seem to have slowed down
at all as he's been clocked by Stan
ford strength coaches at 4.34 in
the 40-yard dash.
"I have a pretty good time in
the forty, but the longer runs like
the 80 are another story," Volpe
said.
It's not surprising Volpe's fa
vorite situation is short yardage.
"I love getting the ball at fourth
and inches, or third and a yard,"
Volpe said. "There's nothing like
building up your intensity for
something like that, especially
when you're tired. It's a natural
high."
Football, for Jon Volpe, is a nat
ural high.
