# WASHINGTON STATE
## STANFORD 
### 
Washington State quarterback
Timm Rosenbach leads the Pacific
10 Conference in total offense and
passing efficiency, and is poised
to break several school and con
ference passing records as well.
Those records include former
Stanford star John Elway's single
season mark of 3,104 yards total
offense, a milepost which has
stood since 1982. Cornerback
Alan Grant keys a Cardinal pass
defense that will try to contain
the Cougars' conference-leading
passing offense. Grant and three
-other Stanford defenders each
have three interceptions this
season.

Sophomore running back Rich
Swinton filled in for injured
starter Steve Broussard, the con
ference's leading rusher, last week
against UCLA and tallied 117
yards against the Bruins. Stan
ford's linebackers will try to shut
down WSU's balanced rushing at
tack which has averaged 235.1
yards per game. Standout line
backer Jono Tunney, the Cardi
nal's leader in tackles with 116
through eight games, will try to
contain the Cougars' lateral run
ning patterns and slow Swinton.

WSU slotback Tim Stallworth,
who leads the Cougars in recep
tions this year, was on the receiv
ing end of the 81-yard Rosenbach
pass that scored the winning
touchdown against UCLA last
week. Stallworth is currently the
Pac-10's third-leading receiver
with 43 catches. Stanford strong
safety Rob Englehardt will try to
keep Rosenbach's and Stal
lworth's aerial assault from bus
ting any long, game-winning
touchdown passes against the
Cardinal defense.

Senior strong-side linebacker
Maury Metcalf, WSU's co-leader
in tackles this season with 74,
will head the Cougars' attempt to
contain Stanford fullback Jon
Volpe. Metcalf, who played last
week in spite of a shoulder injury,
will try to fill the holes of an
already-porous defense that is
riddled with injuries, including a
knee sprain to starting defensive
end Ivan Cook, a team captain.
Volpe, who rushed for a record
220 yards against Washington last
week, needs only 141 yards to
reach the 1,000 yard plateau in
'BB.

Cougar free safety Artie Holmes
is WSU's other co-leader in
tackles, an indication of the
Cougars' defensive woes this
season. But Holmes broke up one
of three Troy Aikman touchdown
pass attempts last week to
preserve WSU's upset victory
over UCLA. Holmes may receive
a workout from Stanford quarter
back Jason Palumbis, who has im
proved steadily over his first four
collegiate starts. Palumbis was 19
of 40 with two touchdowns last
week.

WSU's Rob Myers and Stan
ford's John Hopkins have contrib
uted considerably to their
respective team's success this
season. Hopkins tied a school
record by booting four field goals
against Washington last Saturday,
and has hit his last seven field
goal attempts and his last 33
points-after-touchdown attempts.
Myers, a junior, has punted 28
times through the Cougars eight
games this season. He is averag
ing 36.7 yards per punt and has
a season long of 56 yards.
