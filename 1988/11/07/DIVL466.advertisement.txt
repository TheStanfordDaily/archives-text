You've always done tilings a little
differently. For you there's Zig Zag
premium cigarette tobacco. It's
blended for American tastes,
smooth and mild. Zig Zags long cut
makes it easy to roll. And you get
twice as much tobacco for the same
price as machine made brands.
Sure, rolling your own cigarette is a
little out of the ordinary, but what's
so great about being ordinary?
