PROPOSITION 106
IS A FRAUD
VOTE NO on PROPOSITION 106
1. Ralph Nader urges Californians to vote
No on Proposition 106. (See California
Voters Pamphlet, 1988).
2. Proposition 106 is being financed by the
insurance industry, which is spending $43
million for lawyer bashing commercials.
(See L.A. Times, 7-29-88).
3. What has the insurance industry ever done
for you besides raise your premiums when
you had no claims?
4. The top insurance industry spokesman
(George Tye) has admitted publicly that
Prop 106 won't reduce insurance rates.
San Diego Union, 6-2-88).
5. Proposition 106 is the Insurance Industry
saying, "Let's take away their lawyers."
6 insurance companies give up no rights
at ail under Prop 106. They can still pay
their own lawyers $200 per hour to fight you.
7. Proposition 106 will prohibit you from
negotiating your own deal with your own
attorney.
8. Proposition 106 is intended to force wage
earners to pay their lawyers cash in
advance.
Proposition 106 is intended to take away
all of your leverage against insurance
companies by making it financially impossi
ble for you to hire a lawyer. That will leave
the fox guarding the hen house.
10. The insurance motto is, "millions for
defense, but not one cent for settlement."
Now they want to take away your lawyer
too.

Talk about manual labor. The only
thing more complicated than most word
processors is their instruction manuals.
You can wade through hundreds of
pages of "user interfaces" and "output
fonts" or try something far simpler: The

Processor.
Using PWP 3 is truly an exercise in
simplicity. Our easy-to-follow Tutorial
Data Disk teaches you that moving blocks
of text is a snap, deleting words is a
cinch and inserting words is effortless.

to use, you can pick it up in practically
no time.

of your time writing. And less of
your time reading about writing.
