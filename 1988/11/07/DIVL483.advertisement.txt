"The Captive American" by Lee Brandenburg blows the whistle on Washington -
exposing the system that makes us political prisoners in our own country.
You'll learn why incumbents almost never lose. How our leaders manipulate
the media to create false crises. And how special interest
politics threaten our very future.
But more importantly, you'll learn how to take
politicians out of politics, and return America to
where it belongs... to the people.
"...the most refreshing book on the
American political system in years!"
Robert Waterman, co-author of
"In Search of Excellence."
