# Panel focuses on nuclear deterrence

"We're living as hostages" in
the nuclear age because the only
way to avoid nuclear war is
through deterrence, Deputy Di
rector of SLAC Sidney Drell told
about 90 high school students
gathered in Kresge Auditorium
Saturday afternoon.
"The highest goal that the next
president will face ... is to avoid
a nuclear holocaust," Drell said.
"That would be the end of civiliza
tion."
Prof. Drell, Chemistry Prof.
Linus Pauling and Bagrat Edilian,
a political science professor from
the Soviet Union, addressed the
arms control process in a very
general discussion aimed at high
school students. About 250 high
school students were here over the
weekend attending a conference
sponsored by the Stanford Model
United Nations Club.
Drell advocated a position of
deterrence, known as mutual as
sured destruction, that operates
on the principle that the Soviets
will not launch a first-strike mis
sile attack because they know the
United States will strike back
with enough power to destroy
their country.
Despite its lures, the Strategic
Defense Initiative advocated by
the Reagan adminstration would

destroy deterrence, Drell said. SDI
is a missile defense system.
Drell has been an arms control
adviser to the Carter and Reagan
administrations. He is also co
director of the Center for Inter
national Security and Arms Con
trol.
Pauling agreed with Drell on
every major issue discussed in the
hour-and-a-half forum.
Pauling said SDI was not the
answer to the arms race because
only deterrence will prevent a
third world war and keep the
world in relative peace.
"We can be grateful for (atomic

The highest goal that
the next president will
face ... is to avoid a
nuclear holocaust.'

bombs)," Pauling said, explaining
that the nuclear stockpiles have
frightened both superpowers from
escalating conflicts.
Pauling, who won a Nobel prize
in Chemistry in 1954, led a move
ment against atomic testing in the
1950s that earned him the Nobel
prize for Peace in 1960. Pauling
is perhaps best known for advo
cating large doses, known as
megadoses, of vitamin C to cure
many diseases ranging from the
common cold to cancer.
Although Pauling said he
believes nuclear weapons have
contributed to world peace, he also
said they would eventually become
obsolete when "the idea of war
will have been recognized as un
worthy of the intelligence of
humankind."
Edilian, who teaches at the Uni
versity of Armenia, supported the
arms control process that the So
viet Union and United States are
undergoing. He reassured stu
dents that Soviet policy reflected
the wishes of the Soviet people.
