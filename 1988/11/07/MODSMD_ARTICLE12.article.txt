### Aileen Resnick Staff writer 
The Graduate School of Busi
ness has received a gift of Apple
computers as part of a 2-year,
$6 million grant, the largest
grant Apple has ever given to
a university.
The gift includes 20 Macin
tosh SE computers, six Mac II
computers and two LaserWriter
printers. This addition brings
the total number of Macin
toshes at the school to 130.
Apple's donation is part of
an effort between Apple and
the Business School to improve
the availability of Macintosh
equipment to Business School
faculty and staff. In addition,
a national conference on com
puter technology and business
school education will be co
sponsored by Apple and the
Stanford Business School on
Dec. 5-6, which will allow fac
ulty from around the country
to meet with hardware and
software developers.
According to James Patell,
associate dean for Academic Af

fairs, the new computers will
also enhance the school's ability
to expose students to a wide
range of computers. The school
owns a total of almost 440 com
puters, including IBM,
Hewlett-Packard, Epson and
Digital Equipment Corporation
computers.
Patell said the Business
School attempts to present stu
dents with a wide range of com
puters because it more ac
curately represents the envi
ronment students will face.
"When our students gradu
ate, we want them to be con
fident that they can enter any
computing environment and
know enough to get the job
done," Patell said.
The gift will give Business
School students access to 35
Macintosh SE computers, five
of which have been provided
through a grant from the Man
ufacturing Club, an MBA stu
dent group. Faculty members
will be able to use six of the
new Mac lis and two of the
SE's for research and course
development.
