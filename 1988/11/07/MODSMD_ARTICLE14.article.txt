WARSAW, Poland (AP) -
Solidarity leaders yesterday
threatened broad protests, includ
ing strikes, if the government does
not reverse its decision to close
the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk.
The statement was the
strongest yet by the banned trade
union movement on the planned
rtoslnK nf rhr yard, where
Solidarity began.
Solidarity, which in August
helped end Poland's worst wave
of strikes in seven years, now ap
pears to be on a collision course
with the communist government.
The government announced
Oct. 31 that it will close the yard
in December because the business
is losing money.
But Solidarity's national exec
utive commission, led by Lech
Walesa-, said in a statement,
"There is no actual economic jus
tification of this decision."

"The Gdansk shipyard has to
be defended," Solidarity said. "In
this situation we consider it nec
essary to conduct a broad action
in November for the legalization
of Solidarity, in defense of the
Gdansk shipyard and the
repressed participants in strikes
â€” even resorting to strike action."
SoliHarily"nationa! press repre
sentative Janiisz Onyszkiewicz
said the union's plans might be
clearer after a workers' rally
scheduled tomorrow in Gdansk.
A Walesa aide, Piotr Konopka,
quoted Walesa as telling wor
shipers at St. Brygida's Church
in Gdansk that he would call the
a national "strike alert" at the
rally.
A "strike alert" would mean or
ganizing strike committees and
getting workers prepared to strike
at any moment unless their de
mands are met, said Solidarity

spokesman Wojciech Maziarski.
The Solidarity statement said
the decision to close the 10,000-
worker yard is a "dangerous po
litical act, pointing out the fact
that the government of Prime
Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski
takes advantage of extraordinary
powers to sustain Stalinist meth
ods of administering* the eco
nomy."
It is "an act of revenge against
Solidarity and the Gdansk
shipyard," the statement said.
While acknowledging that eco
nomic reform, which Solidarity
supports, may force the closing of
some enterprises, the statement
said the closings should not be
"arbitrary political decisions."
It said any closures should be
preceded by a review of economic
performance, with workers and
their representatives taking part.
