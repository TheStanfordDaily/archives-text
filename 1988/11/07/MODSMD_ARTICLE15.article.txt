Immigration act enters phase two
The second phase of the federal government's
immigration amnesty program starts today, when
thousands of amnesty recipients can begin apply
ing for permanent residency and get their so
called green cards.
Federal officials expect about 1.5 million of
the 1.8 million non-agricultural workers who ap
plied for amnesty under the Immigration Reform
and Control Act of 1986 to apply for permanent
residency.
But that figure may be optimistic, authorities
said, because some potential applicants could find
themselves shut out of overcrowded English and
civics classes they must take to qualify for per
manent residency.
In Los Angeles, at least one school — the Evans
Community Adult School — has been holding
classes 24 hours a day to handle the crunch.
The situation is less critical in Texas, where
the public schools in El Paso are offering day
classes and the Roman Catholic diocese plana day
and night classes. In Dallas, classes for amnesty
recipients are free in public schools, but many
attend privately run programs.

The INS released its guidelines for civics classes
only about two weeks ago.
