## Dukakis races the clock Scorns Bush for following him around on the issues 
### 
WESTMINSTER, Colo. (AP) -
Democrat Michael Dukakis, bat
tling against the clock to keep his
presidential hopes alive, heaped
scorn on the Republican ticket
yesterday and accused George
Bush of "following me around on
the issues."
Dukakis campaigned across the
West in an urgent final appeal for
votes before tomorrow's election.
Aides pointed with enthusiasm to
new polls showing him continuing
to narrow the GOP nominee's
lead.
"I can smell victory in the air,"
the Democratic nominee told a
rally of 10,000 people in the Den
ver suburb of Westminster within
sight of the snow-capped Rocky
Mountains. "He's slipping and
sliding. We're rocking and roll
ing."
Dukakis later spoke to a crowd
estimated at 10,000 people out
doors at Portland State Univer
sity in Oregon, where he charged
Hush was following him around
the country.
"They're getting so worried
Bush is following me around —
can you believe it,"he said.
"We're taking our case to the
American people," Dukakis said.
"He's trying to keep Dan Quayle
away from the American people."
Dukakis' schedule remained in
flux as aides tried to figure where
to send him in the final hours of
the 1988 campaign.
He planned to fly from the
Northwest late Sunday evening
for Cleveland and St. Louis, then
jet back to the West Coast for a
mid-day event in San Francisco.
A later event was also being
planned in an undisclosed site.
Dukakis was keeping an
around-the-clock campaign
schedule that would have him
flying to events all night last night
and tonight, without stop.
Despite unanimity in the polls
that he was trailing, Dukakis at
each stop asserted he would win.

Dan Quayle is not
a crisis manager,
he's a crisis that
has to be man
aged.
- Michael Dukakis

"We're going to win here," he
said in Portland. "We're going to
win in Washington. We're going
to win in California. We're going
to win a victory and a great vic
tory."
Clearly buoyed by cheering
crowds, Dukakis said in Colorado
that Bush had been mimicking
his own concerns on major issues
and had even borrowed his
populist "I'm on your side" cam
paign slogan.
"George Bush has been follow
ing me around on the issues,"
Dukakis said. "He discovered ed
ucation a few months ago. . . .
He's even discovered the environ
ment.
"I'll tell you one place he's not
going to follow me. He's not fol
lowing Lloyd Bentsen and me to
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue."
Renewing his harsh attacks on
Republican vice presidential nom
inee Dan Quayle, Dukakis quoted
Bush as saying on a TV interview
Saturday that if elected, he might
put Quayle in charge of the White
House crisis management group.
Bush said it "could be," but
that he hadn't decided. But if
Bush did, Dukakis said, it would
mean the youthful Indiana
senator would be responsible for
managing the nation's response
to the gravest international inci
dents. "Gives you the chills,
doesn't it?" Dukakis said.
"Think about it — the Cuban
missile crisis, with Dan Quayle in

charge. . . . That's a risk we Amer
icans can't afford to take," he
said.
"Dan Quayle is not a crisis man
ager, he's a crisis that has to be
managed. That's what they've
been trying to do since August."
Dukakis' advisers were encour
aged by an NBC News poll re
leased yesterday that showed their
candidate had narrowed the gap
to five percentage points, with the
vice president leading 48 percent
to 43 percent.
They also said recent polls sug
gested Dukakis was getting the
larger share of voters who were
only now making up their minds
which candidate they will support.
But they were aware that Du
kakis remained well behind Bush
in some critical states. Dukakis
campaigned in Texas late Satur
day night, just as a Houston
Chronicle poll showed him trailing
Bush by 17 percentage points in
that state.
Dukakis strategists also were
paying a lot of attention to Ohio,
where polls have shown Bush
ahead and the Republicans invest
ing heavily in the outcome.
Campaign chair Paul Brountas
said the candidate is "moving in
most of the battleground states.
Many of them are becoming dead
heats, and in many of them we're
moving ahead."
Dukakis himself, while shaking
hands with supporters, put it sim
ply: "We're surging."
Dukakis was accompanied on
his flight from Texas to Colorado
by actress Carrie Fisher. Among
the TV actors accompanying him
were Hal Linden and John Lar
roquette of the "Night Court"
program.
In a region where guns are a
major issue, Dukakis reaffirmed
his support for gun ownership by
hunters and sportsmen, and by
individuals "subject to state
regulation" for their self
protection.
