### 
MOSCOW (AP) — Human
rights activist Andrei Sakharov,
the father of the Soviet dissident
movement, left yesterday for his
first trip to the West, a two-week
visit to the United States.
The trip comes less than two
years after he was freed from in
ternal exile stemming from his
opposition to the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan.
Sakharov, who won the 1975
Nobel Peace Prize for his human
rights activities, told reporters at
Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport
he was pleased to be going to
Washington for a meeting of the
International Foundation for the
Survival and Development of Hu
manity.
He is also expected to visit Bos
ton to see his stepson Alexei
Semyonov, his wife Liza Alek
seyeva, and their 4-year-old
daughter Alexandra, whom he
never has seen. He also is expected
to receive medical treatment in
the United States.
Sakharov, 67, kissed his wife,
Yelena Bonner, in a diplomatic
lounge where they had waited,
smiling and holding hands, and
then headed for the New York
bound plane. Reporters who went
to the airport were not allowed
in the lounge but could watch
from a distance.
On a brief walk from a white
Volga sedan to the lounge, he told
reporters there still are political
prisoners in the Soviet Union, in
cluding an unknown number in
mental institutions.
Sakharov left using the blue
passport of a member of an official
delegation, not a red passport of
an average Soviet citizen. He was

traveling with Yevgeny Velikhov,
vice president of the Soviet Acad
emy of Sciences. Both men are
members of the board of the foun
dation.
The granting of an exit visa to
Sakharov was a dramatic indica
tion of the changes in Soviet so
ciety under Mikhail Gorbachev.
Sakharov helped develop the So
viet hydrogen bomb but in the
1970s became a leader in the So
viet dissident movement.
Sakharov was exiled to the
closed industrial city of Gorky in
January 1980 for his criticism of

the Soviet military intervention
in Afghanistan the previous
month. His wife was banished to
Gorky as well in August 1984.
Sakharov remained there until
Gorbachev called him back to
Moscow in December 1986. Ear
lier that year, Gorbachev had told
a French newspaper Sakharov
could not travel outside the Soviet
Union because he knew too many
state secrets
Sakharov has continued his sci
entific work, and now concen
trates on the origins of the uni
verse. He speaks out occasionally
on human rights issues.
