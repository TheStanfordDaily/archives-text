## Recommendations: 
### 
Gov. Michael Dukakis advocates a
progressive platform vital to the future
of the United States. Most importantly,
Dukakis' budget priorities are
weighted toward necessary social
spending programs and not toward de
fense.
Domestically, he supports a pro
choice position on abortion, an active
stance toward preserving the environ
ment, a national health insurance plan,
same-day voter registration and
statehood for the District of Columbia.
Dukakis is against SDI implementa
tion, against military funding for the
Contras in Nicaragua and believes the
United States should take a stronger

stand against South Africa.
U.S. citizens have lived through
eight years of Reagan-Bush favoritism
of the wealthy. The Bush-Quayle ticket
offers more of the same unfair policies
and an unqualified vice-presidential
candidate who, if elected, will only be
a heartbeat away from the White
House.
It is time for a change.

Democratic candidate Anna Eshoo
offers the 12th congressional district
a better set of priorities than does her
opponent Tom Campbell.
At the top of Eshoo's list of priorities
are more people-oriented issues, such
as health and child care, rather than
trade. She supports the Aid to Better
Child-care bill, with amendments that
allow individuals more power to deride
what kind of day care is best for their
children.
Eshoo, like her opponent, believes
Congress must deal more effectively
with the budget, but does not believe
Campbell's proposal of a 2 percent
across the board cut is the fair answer.

Congress, 12th district:
0 Anna Eshoo

Considering the disproportionate
amounts of money allotted to the de
fense compared to versus social pro
grams, cutting across the board is not
the right solution to the problem.
Eshoo's backround as a working
mother and as a six-year member of
the Santa Clara County Board of Su
pervisors proves her commitment to
her platform.

In the race for U.S. Senate, the Dem
ocrat Leo McCarthy has a more agree
able stance on the issues than does
incumbent Republican Pete Wilson.
McCarthy does not support in
creased SDI funding, favors an end to
the testing of nuclear weapons and is
against Contra aid.
Unlike his opponent, however, Mc-
Carthy supports a minimum wage in-

crease to $4.55 per hour, a guarantee
of basic health insurance and unpaid
job-guaranteed parental and sick leave.

Proposition 78 would provide a
needed $600 million over two years to
California's higher education facilities.

Proposition 78:
0 Yes

Proposition 79, in a complementary
measure to Proposition 78, would pro
vide $800 million for construction or
improvement of California's public
schools.

Proposition 79:
H Yes

Proposition 99 creates a 25-cent tax
on every pack of cigarettes to be used
for research and medical care. The
initiative would offset the current
problem that everyone has to pay for
increased medical insurance and
health care due to smokers.

Proposition 99:
0 Yes

All Californians should be outraged
with currant insurance rates, but none
of the five propositions on tha ballot
adequately address the problems.
Propositions 101, 104 and 106 are
sponsored by the insurance companies.
It is difficult to conceive how these
propositions will benefit any group ex
cept the insurance companies.
Proposition 100 is sponsored by trial
lawyers. This proposition will in effect
try to lower insurance rates, but
wrongly prohibits restrictions on at
torney's fees.
Proposition 103 is supported by con
sumers and endorsed by Ralph Nader.
This proposition comes closest to help
ing Californians with lowering insur
ance rates, but still falls short of an
effective means to control insurance
companies.
The legislature cannot ignore the
insurance problem in its next session,
but it must derive more comprehen
sive, workable solutions that get at
the root of the rate crisis.

Proposition 102, which would re
quire reporting exposure to the AIDS
virus, is a dangerous proposal. The
virus creates a public health crisis, but
using politics to play on people's fears
does not solve tha problem.

Proposition 102, which would re
quire reporting exposure to the AIDS
virus, is a dangerous proposal. The
virus creates a public health crisis, but
using politics to play on people's fears
does not solve tha problem.

Proposition 102:
0 No
Gov. Michael Dukakis advocates a
progressive platform vital to the future
of the United States. Most importantly,
Dukakis' budget priorities are
weighted toward necessary social
spending programs and not toward de
fense.
Domestically, he supports a pro
choice position on abortion, an active
stance toward preserving the environ
ment, a national health insurance plan,
same-day voter registration and
statehood for the District of Columbia.
Dukakis is against SDI implementa
tion, against military funding for the
Contras in Nicaragua and believes the
United States should take a stronger

stand against South Africa.
U.S. citizens have lived through
eight years of Reagan-Bush favoritism
of the wealthy. The Bush-Quayle ticket
offers more of the same unfair policies
and an unqualified vice-presidential
candidate who, if elected, will only be
a heartbeat away from the White
House.
It is time for a change.

Democratic candidate Anna Eshoo
offers the 12th congressional district
a better set of priorities than does her
opponent Tom Campbell.
At the top of Eshoo's list of priorities
are more people-oriented issues, such
as health and child care, rather than
trade. She supports the Aid to Better
Child-care bill, with amendments that
allow individuals more power to deride
what kind of day care is best for their
children.
Eshoo, like her opponent, believes
Congress must deal more effectively
with the budget, but does not believe
Campbell's proposal of a 2 percent
across the board cut is the fair answer.

Congress, 12th district:
0 Anna Eshoo

Considering the disproportionate
amounts of money allotted to the de
fense compared to versus social pro
grams, cutting across the board is not
the right solution to the problem.
Eshoo's backround as a working
mother and as a six-year member of
the Santa Clara County Board of Su
pervisors proves her commitment to
her platform.

In the race for U.S. Senate, the Dem
ocrat Leo McCarthy has a more agree
able stance on the issues than does
incumbent Republican Pete Wilson.
McCarthy does not support in
creased SDI funding, favors an end to
the testing of nuclear weapons and is
against Contra aid.
Unlike his opponent, however, Mc-
Carthy supports a minimum wage in-

of basic health insurance and unpaid

Proposition 78 would provide a
needed $600 million over two years to
California's higher education facilities.

Proposition 78:
0 Yes

Proposition 79, in a complementary
measure to Proposition 78, would pro
vide $800 million for construction or
improvement of California's public
schools.

Proposition 79:
H Yes

Proposition 99 creates a 25-cent tax
on every pack of cigarettes to be used
for research and medical care. The
initiative would offset the current
problem that everyone has to pay for
increased medical insurance and
health care due to smokers.

Proposition 99:
0 Yes

All Californians should be outraged
with currant insurance rates, but none
of the five propositions on tha ballot
adequately address the problems.
Propositions 101, 104 and 106 are
sponsored by the insurance companies.
It is difficult to conceive how these
propositions will benefit any group ex
cept the insurance companies.
Proposition 100 is sponsored by trial
lawyers. This proposition will in effect
try to lower insurance rates, but
wrongly prohibits restrictions on at
torney's fees.
Proposition 103 is supported by con
sumers and endorsed by Ralph Nader.
This proposition comes closest to help
ing Californians with lowering insur
ance rates, but still falls short of an
effective means to control insurance
companies.
The legislature cannot ignore the
insurance problem in its next session,
but it must derive more comprehen
sive, workable solutions that get at
the root of the rate crisis.
