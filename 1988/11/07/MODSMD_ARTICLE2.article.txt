### Ariane Hoy 
"10,000 points of light," a rally to
oppose George Bush's choice of a run
ning mate, was held at the San Fran
cisco Civic Center Thursday night to
mark the opening of national "Quayle
Search" season.
Vietnam Veterans, Resisters and
Youth Against Hypocrisy rallied carry
ing flashlights, candles and other "ex
pressions of light" to urge Dan Quayle
to meet with them about his question
able actions during the Vietnam War.
Paul Rupert, a member of Stanford's
Class of '67, and a convicted draft

resister, chairs the group that challenges
whether Quayle is qualified to be a
"heartbeat away from the role of
Commander-in-Chief of all U.S. Armed
Forces and President," in light of his
decision to join the National Guard dur
ing the Vietnam War.
Vietnam Veterans, Resisters and
Youth Against Hypocrisy is comprised
of Republicans, Democrats and people
unaffiliated with any particular party.
It acts independently of any presidential
candidacy, but opposes Quayle as a vice
presidential nominee.
Following Bush's selection, the organ
ization sent a letter to Vice President

Bush, expressing disappointment in his
choice.
"We were offended," Rupert says,
speaking on the group's opinion of the
Quayle selection. According to Rupert,
people in the group are offended by
Quayle's not taking a strong stand dur
ing the war by either resisting the draft
or going to Vietnam.
Rupert contacted Stanford students,
as well as students from San Jose State
University and San Francisco high
schools, about the rally. Acting as a con
cerned alumnus, he felt draft-age stu-
dents should take a "hard look at
the election," especially issues of
foreign policy and the draft.
"Students have a high level of
awareness," Rupert said, "much
better than the 60's. They are
considering the same issues; (it's)
just not as dramatic."
He felt the rally was a good
opportunity for the 60's genera
tion to do something politically
with the 80's generation."
The group repeatedly sent in
vitations to Quayle to meet with
them to discuss "his capacity for
leadership on issues of war and
peace," and Quayle ignored them,
Rupert said. "10,000 points of
light" was the final event in a
two-month campaign to get
Quayle to meet with veterans,

resisters and draft-age youth
before the Nov. 8 election.
The rally was for all who "op
pose hypocrisy in high places" and
want Quayle to meet "with those
who had the courage of their con
victions," according to a flier pro
moting the rally.
"10,000 points of light" was a
peaceful demonstration that in
cluded music, entertainment and
some brief speeches by veterans
and resisters.
According to the San Francisco
Police Dept., there were no arrests
during the rally.
The rally also marked the be
ginning of "Yellow Arm-band
Days," a nationwide campaign to
persuade people to wear yellow
arm bands as a symbol of caution
and cowardice in light of Bush's
selection of Quayle. The veterans
group said they hope to inspire
demonstrators across the United
States.
