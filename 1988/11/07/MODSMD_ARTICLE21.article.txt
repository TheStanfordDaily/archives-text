## Looks aren't everything 
### 
BUSH JUST SEEMS stronger,"
says a friend, explaining his Bush-
Quayle vote.
I'll admit that when I see him on TV,
I almost like the man. I'd like to believe
him when he says "no new taxes," and
I'd like to discount as pessimistic
economists who say that twelve years of
this level of economic growth is impos
sible.
It's easier to think that the largest
deficit in our history does not matter,
especially since I took Econ 1 from the
Bush campaign's economic advisor, Mi
chael Boskin.
Like many of us, I'd like to ignore all
of the questions that surround the man,
such as his involvement in the Iran-
Contra Affair, or to justify his subsequent
denial of such involvement.
I'd love to believe that he is an en
vironmentalist with "zero tolerance" for
polluters, despite the fact that virtually
every environmental group has endorsed
Dukakis, and has called Bush a member
of the "environmental wrecking crew."
He headed the Presidential Task Force
on Regulatory Relief, and from mid-1981
to mid-1983 lead the group's efforts to
block the EPA's phase-out of leaded
gasoline.
And when I see serious distortions in
commercials, such as the Boston Harbor
ad, I try to excuse them by saying "that's
politics," and try to ignore the fact that
ads like this raise questions about Bush's
integrity. Dukakis, after all, made the
first significant effort in years to clean
up the harbor while the Reagan-Bush
administration cut funds for such

cleanups.
I like Bush's recognition of the need
for a code of ethics in government. After
Reagan has produced one of the most
indicted administrations in our history,
I'd agree that the time has come.
But again, his actions do not back his
words. Bush has already surrounded him
self with those who would benefit from
such a code. His current finance chair
Robert Mosbacher, a former business
partner, made several million dollars in
a 1972 deal with Ferdinand Marcos,
knowing that the since-deposed dictator's
involvement in the deal was corrupt.
And there's Donald Gregg, Bush's na
tional security advisor. While Bush denies
knowing anything about the diversion of
Iranian arms-sales profits to the Contras,
Oliver North's notebooks show that
Gregg had information about the supply
effort.
I'd like to buy that Bush wouldn't
punish a woman for having an abortion,
an act which he considers murder. And
I'd like to ignore the inherent contradic
tion of such a stand, especially given his
"tough on crime" stance.
And most of all, I'd like to ignore the
issue of the Supreme Court, which some
call the most decisive issue of this elec
tion. No matter which president we elect
tomorrow, the next four years will mark
a break from the last eight years, because
of the Supreme Court.
Reagan's last four appointees — Jus
tices O'Connor, Renquist, Scalia, and
Kennedy — are considered moderate to
conservative. The Court has begun to
swing to the right.

Three of the Court's more progressive
members, Justices Blackmun, Brennan,
and Marshall, are also the oldest. They
are 79, 81, and 80 years old, respectively.
Some say that Justice Blackmun may
retire. Each is growing older.
If Bush is elected, and allowed to
nominate up to three justices who might
be replaced over the next four years, the
tenuous balance the Court now maintains
will be lost. Bush would surely appoint
Justices more in line with his conserva
tive stance on issues which involve
greater government involvement in our
personal lives, such as abortion, prayer
in school, and mandatory drug testing.
Do we want a heavily conservative
Court for the next thirty years? Justices
do not retire after four years. They gen
erally stay on for life.
George Bush, you look and sound like
an honest man, and I'd love to believe
all that you say. However, your record
does not support your words.
And your first incredibly weak
choice to pass over qualified statesmen
such as Bob Dole and instead pick Dan
Quayle as your running mate proves that
old clich6 — looks aren't everything.

gasoline.
And when I see serious distortions in
commercials, such as the Boston Harbor
ad, I try to excuse them by saying "that's
politics," and try to ignore the fact that
ads like this raise questions about Bush's
integrity. Dukakis, after all, made the
first significant effort in years to clean
up the harbor while the Reagan-Bush
administration cut funds for such

cleanups.
I like Bush's recognition of the need
for a code of ethics in government. After
Reagan has produced one of the most
indicted administrations in our history,
I'd agree that the time has come.
But again, his actions do not back his
words. Bush has already surrounded him
self with those who would benefit from
such a code. His current finance chair
Robert Mosbacher, a former business
partner, made several million dollars in
a 1972 deal with Ferdinand Marcos,
knowing that the since-deposed dictator's
involvement in the deal was corrupt.
And there's Donald Gregg, Bush's na
tional security advisor. While Bush denies
knowing anything about the diversion of
Iranian arms-sales profits to the Contras,
Oliver North's notebooks show that
Gregg had information about the supply
effort.
I'd like to buy that Bush wouldn't
punish a woman for having an abortion,
an act which he considers murder. And
I'd like to ignore the inherent contradic
tion of such a stand, especially given his
"tough on crime" stance.
And most of all, I'd like to ignore the
issue of the Supreme Court, which some
call the most decisive issue of this elec
tion. No matter which president we elect
tomorrow, the next four years will mark
a break from the last eight years, because
of the Supreme Court.
Reagan's last four appointees — Jus
tices O'Connor, Renquist, Scalia, and
Kennedy — are considered moderate to
conservative. The Court has begun to
swing to the right.

Three of the Court's more progressive
members, Justices Blackmun, Brennan,
and Marshall, are also the oldest. They
are 79, 81, and 80 years old, respectively.
Some say that Justice Blackmun may
retire. Each is growing older.
If Bush is elected, and allowed to
nominate up to three justices who might
be replaced over the next four years, the
tenuous balance the Court now maintains
will be lost. Bush would surely appoint
Justices more in line with his conserva
tive stance on issues which involve
greater government involvement in our
personal lives, such as abortion, prayer
in school, and mandatory drug testing.
Do we want a heavily conservative
Court for the next thirty years? Justices
do not retire after four years. They gen
erally stay on for life.
George Bush, you look and sound like
an honest man, and I'd love to believe
all that you say. However, your record
does not support your words.
And your first incredibly weak
choice to pass over qualified statesmen
such as Bob Dole and instead pick Dan
Quayle as your running mate proves that
old clich6 — looks aren't everything.
