Holocaust flier has
racist implications
As participants in the 1988 Bridge of
Understanding trip to Germany this
summer, we were especially dismayed
to read The Daily's account of the
anti-Semitic incidents that recently
occurred on campus (Hillel targeted
with anti-Semitic fliers Nov. 2).
The purpose of the trip was to pro
mote and enhance understanding be
tween American Jewry and modern
German society. During the course of
the program, in which seventeen Stan
ford students participated, we met with
high school and university students,
prominent government officials, mili
tary officers, and families with whom
we stayed.
After returning from the trip, we
realized that the Germans are trying
to cope with their past by educating
their children about it and by promot
ing intellectual discussion about the
Holocaust. In the United States,
though, it appears we still have a long
way to go.
The anti-Semitic flier targeted for
Stanford Hillel sarcastically told pro
spective voters that a vote for Michael
Dukakis would be a vote for more
Holocaust studies, implying that the
Holocaust should not be studied.
This view, espoused by radical right
wing organizations such as the Ku
Klux Klan and the Nazi Party of
America, constitutes a subtle but unde
niable form of hatred toward Jews.
The accusation underlying such subtle
forms of racism is that the Holocaust
never occurred and that this tragedy of
human history should not be studied
because it is a myth.
Of the dozens of Germans with
whom we spoke on the trip, not one
even considered the possibility of such
revisionist allegations. In fact, on on«
occasion we spoke with a Mr. Krapf, a

former Nazi who served as ambassador
to Japan during the war, who claimed
that his "hate for Hitler is at least as
great as (ours). You can mourn the
death of your people with your head
held high," he told us, "I must mourn
them with my head bowed down in
shame." Racism and holocaust are
indeed shameful crimes.
Those who propagate the myth that
the Holocaust never happened are only
practicing a more subtle, hidden form
of the hatred which enabled the
slaughter of over six million Jews less
than fifty years ago.
Denying the Holocaust's existence
demonstrates more than the mere fact
that there are a few people who dislike
Jews. It uncovers a vein of racism that
runs through the American
bloodstream. Perhaps what is even
more alarming than racist incidents
themselves is the apathy on the part
of Americans who accept such occur
rences as normal.
Studying the Holocaust provides an
invaluable lesson: humanity is capable
of prejudice and, when taken to an
extreme, the slaughter of millions of
innocent human beings. Studying the
Holocaust is the only way to prevent
humanity from repeating its horrific
past. The existence of racists and
bigots today is a frightful reminder of
the human potential for evil.
The fiftieth anniversary of Kristall
nacht ("Night of the Shattered Glass"
— an event in Nazi Germany that
signaled the beginning of the
Holocaust) takes place on Nov. 9.
Those concerned about the rise in
racist incidents on campus and in our
society would do well to take a mo
ment on Nov. 9 to learn from the hor
rors of the past and the subsequent
need to fight prejudice whenever it
presents itself in today's complex
world.
