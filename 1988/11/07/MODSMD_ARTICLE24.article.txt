## It's entirely appropriate for the Women's Center to be political 
### 
IN HER NOV. 2 LETTER to the
editor, Jennifer Bryson criticized
the Women's Center for acting in a
manner inappropriately political and
not representative of the Stanford
women's community in our support of
the Bay Area Coalition Against Opera
tion Rescue.
The Women's Center is proud to be
political. It is entirely appropriate that
the Women's Center take political
stands for a number of reasons.
First, the Women's Center is a com
munity center whose need arises from
the inequalities between women and
men in a society in which there exists
sexism and misogyny.
Second, we offer resources that
address a broad spectrum of women's

concerns and work to challenge the
institutionalized and varied forms of
sexism that oppress women. We coor
dinate women's cultural and political
programs as well as operate a resource
and referral center.
Third, we operate as a collective
with open membership. Decisions
within the collective are made by
consensus â€” a process in which the
opinions of all people present at a
meeting are heard and considered by
the entire group before a poiicy is
agreed upon.
New collective members are always
welcome; we invite all members of the
Stanford community who are concerned
about women's issues to attend and
participate in our meetings.

We would like to clarify the Women's
Center's role in the action against
Operation Rescue.
We acted in our capacity as a refer
ral center: we were a contact between
Bay Area Coalition Against Operation
Rescue and people interested in par
ticipating in the counter demonstration
against Operation Rescue. The Coali
tion organized groups to support wom
en's clinics in response to Operation
Rescue's threats to close these clinics
illegally.
To set the record straight, and to
give credit where credit is due, we
neither organized this counter
demonstration nor spent any funds in
support of it. However, we applaud the
efforts of those who did organize the

counter-demonstration, and the more
than 70 people, including many indi
viduals of the Women's Center Collec
tive, who got up at 4 a.m. to partici
pate.
Ms. Bryson stated in her letter that,
"It is ironic that the feminists' defini
tion of 'equality' with men is the right
to imitate men rather than the right
to assert the female qualities of wom
en."
To stereotype feminism in this way
is to ignore the legacy of the feminist
movement, a movement which opened
the doors to a greater political and
economic life for women.
Seventy years ago women in this
country could not vote, let alone run
for political office or lead major politi

cal organizations. Seventy years ago
women such as Susan B. Anthony and
Jeanette Rankin (the first woman in
Congress), were mocked as women who
wanted to be men.
While women today have more op
portunities to participate in public life,
we clearly have a long struggle ahead
of us if a woman can still be labeled
as a "male wanna-be" for pro-female
politics.
