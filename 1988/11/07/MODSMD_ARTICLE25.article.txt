# Tresidder avoiding catering competition
## 
### 
I am writing concerning the article
in Thursday's paper about the conflict
going on between Tresidder and Uni
versity Food Service over whether Food
Service has the right to compete for
new catering business.
I worked full-time this summer for
the new catering business, and now
that I am no longer affiliated with the
service, I feel I can say a few things
about the conflict which those directly
involved are not able to say them
selves.
First I would like to express my

disgust with the way the officials of
Tresidder and the Dean of Student
Affairs are trying to convince us that
their motives are altruistic, and they
are only concerned that the University
will be wasting its resources. In In
diana I would call that hogwash, but
for now I will simply say that they are
covering up their real motives with
these false concerns for University
resources.
The truth is that this new catering
service is taking business away from
Tresidder, and they don't like the com
petition. The order to stop doing busi
ness came from the Dean of Student
Affairs Office, and isn't it interesting
to note that a percentage of everything
Tresidder makes goes into the funds of

this very office?
I also understand that Tresidder
owes a lot of money to the University
for remodeling expenses. If Tresidder
doesn't make a big profit, the Univer
sity doesn't get paid back. These
reasons wouldn't have anything to do
with this sudden concern for resources
would it?
But I lapse into sarcasm. What I
really want to make clear is why this
university needs another option for
catering.
Tresidder has had a monopoly on
the catering business for so long that
the quality of their work has
degenerated to a level unacceptable by
many guests of the University. Various

returning conference guests described
their past dealings with Tresidder as
being quite awful.
Many coordinators of these confer
ences expressed their delight that there
was now an alternative to Tresidder,
and I feel I am being completely objec
tive when I say that not only was our
service less expensive, but our setups
showed a concern with the satisfaction
of the customer that those of Tresidder
often lacked.
The concern with advertising baffles
me though. We did not advertise this
summer, but we still did enough busi
ness to tick some people off. The Con
ference Office informed coordinators of
the new option for catering, and any

business we got was due to the dissat
isfaction of these visitors with Tresid
der's service in the past.
However, ordering the new catering
service to stop seeking new customers
is equal to saying get out of the busi
ness.
Why don't the officials at Tresidder
and the Dean of Student Affairs stop
insulting our intelligence with their
false concerns and say what they really
mean, "We don't care about free enter
prise. We don't care what people of
this university want. You're taking
money out of our pockets and we're
going to put a stop to it."
