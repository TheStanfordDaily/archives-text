## Students chose Nixon, Landon — the U.S. picked Kennedy, FDR As Stanford goes, so goes the nation? History says no 
### Katherine Toy 
A few days before the 1980 presidential
election, Independent candidate John An
derson made a whistle stop at the
CalTrain station on University Avenue.
"You know what the saying is, 'As Stan
ford goes, so goes the nation,' " he said
hopefully, after a campus poll showed him
the leader over Ronald Reagan and
Jimmy Carter.
Nonetheless, his saying has rarely
proven true. Stanford and the country
seldom have agreed on the choice of pres
ident.
In eight mock elections held between
1900 and 1984, more students cast their

votes for candidates who eventually lost
in the national election. By contrast, stu
dent opinion reflected in mock elections
coincided with national preference only
four times this century.
In the 12 mock elections, the majority
of students have voted Republican eight
times. "It's a longstanding joke that the
faculty has been Democratic and the stu
dents Republican," History Prof. David
Kennedy said.
For example, a straw poll in 1936
showed the faculty favoring Franklin D.
Roosevelt, while the students chose Re
publican Alfred Landon.
In 1980, neither the Republicans nor
the Democrats triumphed in the campus

The 1928 race between
Republican Herbert Hoo
ver — Stanford's favorite
son — and Democrat
Alfred Smith created the
biggest election hoopla to
hit the campus since its
founding.

presidential race as Independent John An
derson scooped the victory.
The tumultuous 1968 presidential elec
tion confounded the campus as it did the
nation. An active student group of the
19605, Students for a Democratic Society
sponsored a rally on election day in Lyt
ton Plaza in Palo Alto. The demonstra
tion ended with the arrest of several
Stanford students and an associate pro
fessor, along with initiating a drawn-out,
controversial police involvement on
campus.
A Daily editorial reflected the political
sentiment of many students at the time.
"We find it impossible to urge members
of the Stanford community to vote for
any of them [Richard Nixon, George Wal
lace, Hubert Humphrey] in tomorrow's
presidential election.
From the depths of our conviction that
the people have been ignored in this elec
tion, we urge a vote for Eugene McCarthy,
Dick Gregory, your mother, Pigasus or
'No'."
Kennedy noted that the feeling here
was much the same around the nation,
speculating that this indignation was
partly responsible for Nixon's victory
with less than half the popular vote. "Not
voting is not opting out of the system.
It is making a choice."
According to Kennedy, students made
the choice that none of the major candi

dates merited any support, thus leaving
the decision to voters who already
strongly supported one candidate. In the
end, the president proved to be the one
most unwanted by those not willing to
choose among the "lesser of the evils."
Political Science Prof. Hubert Marshall
recalled a "very active feeling of disgust"
about the choice of the 1968 candidates
because of the similarity of Nixon and
Humphrey's policies concerning the Viet
nam war. He noted that "no one here"
would have voted for Wallace.
In 1968, when Humphrey campaigned
in Memorial Auditorium to a full house,
Marshall said the Democratic candidate
delivered "an absolutely stupid speech
about youth, and nobody wanted to hear
about youth. They wanted to hear about

Vietnam."
In fact, Humphrey needed a police es
cort to depart from the throngs of dis
pleased attendants who packed the
auditorium and overflowed by the hun
dreds outside of the building, according
to Marshall.
Kennedy recollected his own days as a
Stanford undergraduate in 1960 when
both Nixon and John F. Kennedy made
visits to campus. He noted a great dif
ference between his impressions of the
two candidates' messages and speaking
styles.
"I can remember being very energized
by what he [JFK] had to say ... I also
remember Nixon coming along and
