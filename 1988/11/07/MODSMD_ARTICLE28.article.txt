# When Liberty sold bonds, the people paid
## World War I poster exhibit illustrates the compelling power of visual propaganda

She wears a loose-fitting sailor's shirt, tied at
the waist. It falls open, distractingly. She glances
sideways, a coquette with a half-smile. "Gee!! I wish
I were a man ... . I'd join the Navy."
About 15,000 potential enlistees saw this poster
in 1918 and signed up to fight for their country.
The poster, the work of illustrator Howard
Chandler Christy, is just one of hundreds of images
created between 1915 and 1918 to promote
America's involvement in World War I. And they're
now on display at the University Art Gallery, located
across from the History Corner.
Backed by the U.S. Committee on Public Infor
mation, the posters were promotion with a venge
ance. These visually-arresting posters pushed
everything from war bonds and enlistment to food
conservation.
"Eat more fish" suggests one poster illustrated
with four unsuspecting trout, "they feed them
selves."

What Vice President George Bush and Gov. Mi
chael Dukakis accept as fact — that a few powerful
images, repeated constantly, can have a persuasive
effect — was practically invented by the great poster
makers of World War I. Not just Woodrow Wilson's
"war to make the world safe for democracy," this
war readied the world for public relations, beginning
with the use of provocative posters urging people
to buy war bonds.
"These posters represent a coming together of
art, technology, advertising and popular culture,"
said Carol Osborne, who set up the exhibit of 50
World War I propaganda posters on display at the
Gallery.
Many of the exhibited works are drawn from the
Hoover Institution's collection of more than 37,000
propaganda posters from the 20th century.
"This (1915 to 1918) was the first time in Amer
ican history that pictures were used as the dominant
means of communicating," said Osborne.

Loaning for Liberty
In a poster created by G.R. Macauley in 1917, a
glowering Statue of Liberty leans over and thrusts
a finger at the viewer: "You. Buy a liberty bond
lest I perish." Then as now, the government was
petrified of creating new taxes. But war is expensive,
and the government needed cash. So the first Liberty
Loan was announced in April, 1917, just after the
United States entered the war.
The war cost the United States more than 125,000
lives and $30 billion. Two-thirds of the money was
raised by selling bonds. The "T-word" was not men
tioned, although income tax rates — invented in
1916 — rose during the war.
The poster artists used all their skill and cunning
to C£yole the public into loaning money to the gov
ernment. One poster pictures a kindly-looking,
white-haired matron standing in front of an
American flag. The caption urges
"Women! Help America's sons
WIN THE WAR. Buy U.S. gov
ernment bonds."
Playing on stories of German
atrocities, a poster asks simply
"Hun or Home?" and shows a
hulking German figure advancing
on a woman holding a child. "Buy
More Liberty Bonds," reads the
text.
One particularly disturbing il
lustration shows a pair of boots,
complete with the German eagle
insignia and cavalry spurs, drip
ping with blood. "Keep these off
the U.S.A. Buy more Liberty
Bonds," the caption reads.
And if guilt, violence and fear
didn't work, there was always sex.
To entice investment in the Vic
tory Liberty Loan in 1919,
Howard Chandler Christy contrib
uted a willowy "Christy Girl" who
stood in her bloomers and pre
sented an "honor roll" of melting
pot ethnic names. "Americans
All" were asked to buy bonds.
Saint or plaything?
Images of women dominate the
posters on display at the Gallery.
Pictured variously as mother,
idealized allegory, sex object and

sturdy worker in service to the
nation, female stereotypes were
used to manipulate hearts and
minds.
A striking example of the
"mother" variety is Alonzo Earl
Foringer's 1918 "Greatest Mother
in the World" poster. It shows a
luminous red cross nurse on one
knee. Her eyes are full of caring
and concern as she gently cradles
a wounded soldier, scaled down
to the size of an infant.
Artists also tapped into Amer
ican allegorical symbols. Literally
wrapped in the flag, Liberty (of
Statue fame), shakes a sailor's
hand, sending him off to defend
her honor.
But women were also portrayed
as spirited, able workers. They
might volunteer for the Motor
Corps of America, or become a
farming "girl on the land." Os
borne suggested that this "force
ful image of the independent
worker providing indispensable
service to the nation" was a pre
cursor of the "new American
woman who won the vote in
1920."
The"America Calls" exhibit
runs through Dec. 18. But before
going to the polls tomorrow, drop
by the Art Gallery and check out
these fascinating posters. They
might just shed some light on the
"photo opportunity" nature of
this year's campaign process.

in 1918 and signed up to fight for their country.
The poster, the work of illustrator Howard
Chandler Christy, is just one of hundreds of images
created between 1915 and 1918 to promote
America's involvement in World War I. And they're
now on display at the University Art Gallery, located
across from the History Corner.
Backed by the U.S. Committee on Public Infor
mation, the posters were promotion with a venge
ance. These visually-arresting posters pushed
everything from war bonds and enlistment to food
conservation.
"Eat more fish" suggests one poster illustrated
with four unsuspecting trout, "they feed them
selves."

What Vice President George Bush and Gov. Mi
chael Dukakis accept as fact — that a few powerful
images, repeated constantly, can have a persuasive
effect — was practically invented by the great poster
makers of World War I. Not just Woodrow Wilson's
"war to make the world safe for democracy," this
war readied the world for public relations, beginning
with the use of provocative posters urging people
to buy war bonds.
"These posters represent a coming together of
art, technology, advertising and popular culture,"
said Carol Osborne, who set up the exhibit of 50
World War I propaganda posters on display at the
Gallery.
Many of the exhibited works are drawn from the
Hoover Institution's collection of more than 37,000
propaganda posters from the 20th century.
"This (1915 to 1918) was the first time in Amer
ican history that pictures were used as the dominant
means of communicating," said Osborne.

Loaning for Liberty
In a poster created by G.R. Macauley in 1917, a
glowering Statue of Liberty leans over and thrusts
a finger at the viewer: "You. Buy a liberty bond
lest I perish." Then as now, the government was
petrified of creating new taxes. But war is expensive,
and the government needed cash. So the first Liberty
Loan was announced in April, 1917, just after the
United States entered the war.
The war cost the United States more than 125,000
lives and $30 billion. Two-thirds of the money was
raised by selling bonds. The "T-word" was not men
tioned, although income tax rates — invented in
1916 — rose during the war.
The poster artists used all their skill and cunning
to C£yole the public into loaning money to the gov
ernment. One poster pictures a kindly-looking,
white-haired matron standing in front of an
American flag. The caption urges
"Women! Help America's sons
WIN THE WAR. Buy U.S. gov
ernment bonds."
Playing on stories of German
atrocities, a poster asks simply
"Hun or Home?" and shows a
hulking German figure advancing
on a woman holding a child. "Buy
More Liberty Bonds," reads the
text.
One particularly disturbing il
lustration shows a pair of boots,
complete with the German eagle
insignia and cavalry spurs, drip
ping with blood. "Keep these off
the U.S.A. Buy more Liberty
Bonds," the caption reads.
And if guilt, violence and fear
didn't work, there was always sex.
To entice investment in the Vic
tory Liberty Loan in 1919,
Howard Chandler Christy contrib
uted a willowy "Christy Girl" who
stood in her bloomers and pre
sented an "honor roll" of melting
pot ethnic names. "Americans
All" were asked to buy bonds.
Saint or plaything?
Images of women dominate the
posters on display at the Gallery.
Pictured variously as mother,
idealized allegory, sex object and

sturdy worker in service to the
nation, female stereotypes were
used to manipulate hearts and
minds.
A striking example of the
"mother" variety is Alonzo Earl
Foringer's 1918 "Greatest Mother
in the World" poster. It shows a
luminous red cross nurse on one
knee. Her eyes are full of caring
and concern as she gently cradles
a wounded soldier, scaled down
to the size of an infant.
Artists also tapped into Amer
ican allegorical symbols. Literally
wrapped in the flag, Liberty (of
Statue fame), shakes a sailor's
hand, sending him off to defend
her honor.
But women were also portrayed
as spirited, able workers. They
might volunteer for the Motor
Corps of America, or become a
farming "girl on the land." Os
borne suggested that this "force
ful image of the independent
worker providing indispensable
service to the nation" was a pre
cursor of the "new American
woman who won the vote in
1920."
The"America Calls" exhibit
runs through Dec. 18. But before
going to the polls tomorrow, drop
by the Art Gallery and check out
these fascinating posters. They
might just shed some light on the
"photo opportunity" nature of
this year's campaign process.
She wears a loose-fitting sailor's shirt, tied at
the waist. It falls open, distractingly. She glances
sideways, a coquette with a half-smile. "Gee!! I wish
I were a man ... . I'd join the Navy."
