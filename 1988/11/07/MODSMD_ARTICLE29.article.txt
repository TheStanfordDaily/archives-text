# Athlete volunteers kid around, befriending little sisters, brothers
## 
### Susannah Miller 
Despite long hours spent working out,
Stanford varsity athletes are making
other commitments that might endure
long after their time in the sports spot
light.
At Stanford there are now 60 pairs of
"bigs and littles" — varsity athletes who
become older brother and sisters for
elementary school children.
In 1969, two Stanford football players
started up Volunteers For Youth, a na
tional program that matches up athletes
and children. The program has now
spread to 55 schools across the nation.
"It's fun to do the stuff you used to
do as a kid," said varsity swimmer Dave
Shraven, one of the directors of Volun
teers For Youth.
The National Collegiate Athletic Asso
ciation originally sponsored the program
as part of their efforts to provide positive
role models for children on the sports
field as well as in the classroom.
Grammar school teachers recommend

certain children for the program by their
teachers because the students might have
low self-esteem or come from single par
ent homes, according to Shraven. The
children start the program between the
ages of nine and 12 and must have pa
rental consent.
Athlete/child pair-ups organize most
activities on their own. Movies, shopping,
dinner at the dorms and campus sports
events are some of the more popular ac
tivites. The Athletic Department helps
fund the program, enabling the groups
to visit Great America Theme Park or
the Flicks about once a quarter.
Commitment and consistency are the
main goals of the program. The "bigs"
are expected to give an average of four
hours every week and to participate for
at least two years.
According to Kay Grady, a counselor
at Hillview Elementary school in Menlo
Park, the children's parents often fear
that the athletes might be too busy to
follow through on their commitment and
that their child might be disappointed

friendship it's not one
sided. You become
friends and a real trust
develops between you.'

again, adding to a long history of disap
pointments.
Nonetheless, Grady has been with the
program for three years and said she
could only recall one incident where there
was a lack of committement.
Radina Philyaw, an 11-year-old "little,"
said her parents think the program . .is
good because they don't always have a
lot of time and every week I do something
with Valerie (Wilson)." Wilson, a varsity
tennis player, is Philyaw's "big".

Philyaw said venturing to campus and
eating dinner in the dorm is the best
part about the match-up program.
The athletes are chosen by a committee
of seven student directors who interview
the athletes, children and their parents.
First, the directors make a presentation
introducing the program to every Stan
ford sports team. Interested athletes are
interviewed and matched on a basis of
personal interest.
The directors regularly check up on
both the "bigs" and the "littles" through
out the year to make sure all is going
smoothly. The pairs are also accountable
to the counselors at the grammar schools.
About 30 athletes will apply for 20
remaining "big" spots this year, predicted
senior John Hodge, one of the program's
two coordinating directors. The "bigs"
are expected to provide friendship,
stability and be role models for the
"littles," he said.
But "once you've got a friendship it's
not one-sided. You become friends and a
real trust develops between you," said

Hodge, a varsity swimmer.
Grady commented that "Most of the
kids were really excited to start up again.
It was really important for them to hear
from their "bigs" over the summer be
cause three months is a long time to a
kid."
All the "bigs" were enthusiastic about
the program. Laurie Dalgleish, a senior,
explained that she wanted to do some
thing outside of Stanford and the pro
gram offered her a personal way to get
involved in the community on a regular
basis.
Wilson noted that the matchup "is good
for [her "little"] to have someone between
her classmates and her parents."
"It's been incredible to watch her
grow," she said.
Saying that all volunteers "do this from
their hearts, Grady stressed the impor
tance of community outreach.
"One of the most important things an
individual can do is to be a volunteer
and contribute to their community with
out being paid." Grady said.

as part of their efforts to provide positive
role models for children on the sports
field as well as in the classroom.
Grammar school teachers recommend

certain children for the program by their
teachers because the students might have
low self-esteem or come from single par
ent homes, according to Shraven. The
children start the program between the
ages of nine and 12 and must have pa
rental consent.
Athlete/child pair-ups organize most
activities on their own. Movies, shopping,
dinner at the dorms and campus sports
events are some of the more popular ac
tivites. The Athletic Department helps
fund the program, enabling the groups
to visit Great America Theme Park or
the Flicks about once a quarter.
Commitment and consistency are the
main goals of the program. The "bigs"
are expected to give an average of four
hours every week and to participate for
at least two years.
According to Kay Grady, a counselor
at Hillview Elementary school in Menlo
Park, the children's parents often fear
that the athletes might be too busy to
follow through on their commitment and
that their child might be disappointed

again, adding to a long history of disap
pointments.
Nonetheless, Grady has been with the
program for three years and said she
could only recall one incident where there
was a lack of committement.
Radina Philyaw, an 11-year-old "little,"
said her parents think the program . .is
good because they don't always have a
lot of time and every week I do something
with Valerie (Wilson)." Wilson, a varsity
tennis player, is Philyaw's "big".

Philyaw said venturing to campus and
eating dinner in the dorm is the best
part about the match-up program.
The athletes are chosen by a committee
of seven student directors who interview
the athletes, children and their parents.
First, the directors make a presentation
introducing the program to every Stan
ford sports team. Interested athletes are
interviewed and matched on a basis of
personal interest.
The directors regularly check up on
both the "bigs" and the "littles" through
out the year to make sure all is going
smoothly. The pairs are also accountable
to the counselors at the grammar schools.
About 30 athletes will apply for 20
remaining "big" spots this year, predicted
senior John Hodge, one of the program's
two coordinating directors. The "bigs"
are expected to provide friendship,
stability and be role models for the
"littles," he said.
But "once you've got a friendship it's
not one-sided. You become friends and a
real trust develops between you," said

Hodge, a varsity swimmer.
Grady commented that "Most of the
kids were really excited to start up again.
It was really important for them to hear
from their "bigs" over the summer be
cause three months is a long time to a
kid."
All the "bigs" were enthusiastic about
the program. Laurie Dalgleish, a senior,
explained that she wanted to do some
thing outside of Stanford and the pro
gram offered her a personal way to get
involved in the community on a regular
basis.
Wilson noted that the matchup "is good
for [her "little"] to have someone between
her classmates and her parents."
"It's been incredible to watch her
grow," she said.
Saying that all volunteers "do this from
their hearts, Grady stressed the impor
tance of community outreach.
"One of the most important things an
individual can do is to be a volunteer
and contribute to their community with
out being paid." Grady said.
