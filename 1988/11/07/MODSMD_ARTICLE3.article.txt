# Independent candidate stumps against Dukakis

There is a national third-party
candidate who is currently cam
paigning to keep Michael Dukakis
out of the White House.
Lenora Fulani, a 38-year-old
developmental psychologist from
New York and a member of the
National Alliance Party, is the
only independent candidate on the
ballot in all 50 states and the
District of Columbia. Fulani is
also the first black independent

the Democratic party that they

She wants to end poverty, racism,
sexism, anti-Semitism and anti
gay bigotry. However, she believes
that the Democratic Party no
longer addresses these concerns.
Curtis said "Take a look at what

in a decade and Bentsen got the
ticket."
However, Fulani does not favor
the Republicans. "What Fulani is
