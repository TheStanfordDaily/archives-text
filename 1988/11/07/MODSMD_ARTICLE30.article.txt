Football
Cougars 24, Cardinal 21

The Stanford football team suf
fered its third consecutive heart
breaker and its fifth of the year,
coming back but falling just short
in a 24-21 loss to Washington
State at Stanford Stadium Satur
day.
"This is the toughest one,"
Stanford Coach Jack Elway said.
Stanford, trailing 21-7 midway
through the third quarter, had
the ball down 24-21 on the Cougar
two-and-a-half yard line with one
minute, 30 seconds remaining,
but quarterback Jason Palumbis'
pass for tight end Turner Baur
was picked off in the back of the
end zone.

Stanford fell to 3-5-1 on the
year, 1-4-1 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference, while Washington State
improved to 6-3, 3-3.
Free safety Chris Moton, who
led the Cougars in tackles with
12, insured his status as the hero
by diving in front of Baur and
grabbing the ball. After the game
Moton was seen carrying the ball
to the locker room and he is prob
ably still holding on to it.
"It's a part of the game,"
Palumbis said. "The guy made a
great play.... When I threw it
the guy was playing behind him
(Baur) and he just dove in front
of him. Maybe I should have just
thrown it out of bounds. I don't
know.
"I thought he was open. I threw
it — I went for it. That's the
breaks."
In a first half filled with big
plays, the Cardinal did a little too
much giving and not enough re
ceiving. Two second-quarter
fumbles deep in Stanford terri
tory gave WSU 11 points and the
score was 14-7 at the half.

"The first half we had to over
come the fumbles and intercep
tions," Elway said. "The second
half we got it going."
After Stanford kicked to open
the second stanza, WSU quarter
back Timm Rosenbach moved the
Cougars to their own 38. Defen
sive tackle Scott Palmbush then
sacked Rosenbach for an eight
yard loss, and after running back
Rich Swinton ran a draw for two
it was third and 16. Rosenbach
went back to pass but couldn't
find a receiver, so he took the ball
and ran 14 yards. But there was
a holding call against WSU on the
play.
Logic dictates that if you have
a team stopped — it would have
been fourth and two — you make
them punt, especially when you
are losing. The Cardinal, however,
accepted the penalty, making it
third and 27 from the 21.
Rosenbach had the Cardinal
right where he wanted them. He
threw a screen to Swinton, who
turned it upfield for 12 and a
five-yard face mask penalty gave
the Cougars five yards from the
spot of the foul (where the tackle
was made) and made it third down
again.
With third and a mere 10 facing
him, Rosenbach hit wide receiver
Tim Stallworth cutting under
neath the linebackers, and Stal
lworth sped 51 yards to the Stan
ford 11. Four plays later it was
21-7.
But, as in each of the previous
two games, the Cardinal came
back. Palumbis led the Cardinal
downfield to the WSU 33, then
lobbed a perfect pass to Charlie
Young streaking down the left
sideline. Young caught the ball
just over the defender and ran for
the score to bring Stanford within
seven.
The Cougars drove for a field
goal but Stanford moved the ball
and Palumbis found Henry Green
on a fade pattern for a 17-yard
score. With 12 minutes left and
trailing by three, the Cardinal de
fense needed to rise to the occa
sion. But on a third-and-14 play
from the WSU 15, Rosenbach
scrambled, ran forward to about
the 19, retreated to the 16 and

threw a 53-yard dump-off pass to
William Pellum. A flag was
thrown but the officials decided
Rosenbach had returned back be
hind the line before throwing the
pass, thus no penalty. The correct
call, illegal forward pass, carries
a loss-of-down penalty and would
have forced Washington State to
punt from its end zone.
Instead the play was allowed to
stand, the Cougars ran three more
minutes off the clock and the Car
dinal finally got the ball on its
24 instead of around midfield.
"I can't believe that that's what
happened," Elway said. "That's
what they called."
The teams traded punts, and

with 5:38 showing on the clock,
Palumbis began a drive at the
Cardinal 29. Palumbis' passing
and Volpe's running moved the
ball to the three and a crucial
fourth-and-one play. Volpe dove
over right tackle for the first
down, then ran for nothing up
the middle. Then, the interception
and the game was over.
"I thought we'd go for it then,"
Elway said, "come back and run
on third and fourth down."
"He was open," Palumbis said.
"I thought I made a good
throw. . . . The guy just made a
great play. Maybe the best place
to put the ball was 30 feet over
his head. . .. We should have won

this game; we didn't. That's the
bottom line. . . . I'll shake it off
and come back for next week."
Stanford will need to be ready
next week when the team travels
to meet UCLA. But although
UCLA is one of the nation's top
teams, the Cardinal knows it has
a chance.
"We're a great football team,"
Palumbis said. "We can beat
anyone in the Pac-10, and they
can beat us obviously. . . . We'll
just go on to the next game."
"If we want to win we have to
be a lot more consistant," outside

was picked off in the back of the
end zone.

Stanford fell to 3-5-1 on the
year, 1-4-1 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference, while Washington State
improved to 6-3, 3-3.
Free safety Chris Moton, who
led the Cougars in tackles with
12, insured his status as the hero
by diving in front of Baur and
grabbing the ball. After the game
Moton was seen carrying the ball
to the locker room and he is prob
ably still holding on to it.
"It's a part of the game,"
Palumbis said. "The guy made a
great play.... When I threw it
the guy was playing behind him
(Baur) and he just dove in front
of him. Maybe I should have just
thrown it out of bounds. I don't
know.
"I thought he was open. I threw
it — I went for it. That's the
breaks."
In a first half filled with big
plays, the Cardinal did a little too
much giving and not enough re
ceiving. Two second-quarter
fumbles deep in Stanford terri
tory gave WSU 11 points and the
score was 14-7 at the half.

"The first half we had to over
come the fumbles and intercep
tions," Elway said. "The second
half we got it going."
After Stanford kicked to open
the second stanza, WSU quarter
back Timm Rosenbach moved the
Cougars to their own 38. Defen
sive tackle Scott Palmbush then
sacked Rosenbach for an eight
yard loss, and after running back
Rich Swinton ran a draw for two
it was third and 16. Rosenbach
went back to pass but couldn't
find a receiver, so he took the ball
and ran 14 yards. But there was
a holding call against WSU on the
play.
Logic dictates that if you have
a team stopped — it would have
been fourth and two — you make
them punt, especially when you
are losing. The Cardinal, however,
accepted the penalty, making it
third and 27 from the 21.
Rosenbach had the Cardinal
right where he wanted them. He
threw a screen to Swinton, who
turned it upfield for 12 and a
five-yard face mask penalty gave
the Cougars five yards from the
spot of the foul (where the tackle
was made) and made it third down
again.
With third and a mere 10 facing
him, Rosenbach hit wide receiver
Tim Stallworth cutting under
neath the linebackers, and Stal
lworth sped 51 yards to the Stan
ford 11. Four plays later it was
21-7.
But, as in each of the previous
two games, the Cardinal came
back. Palumbis led the Cardinal
downfield to the WSU 33, then
lobbed a perfect pass to Charlie
Young streaking down the left
sideline. Young caught the ball
just over the defender and ran for
the score to bring Stanford within
seven.
The Cougars drove for a field
goal but Stanford moved the ball
and Palumbis found Henry Green
on a fade pattern for a 17-yard
score. With 12 minutes left and
trailing by three, the Cardinal de
fense needed to rise to the occa
sion. But on a third-and-14 play
from the WSU 15, Rosenbach
scrambled, ran forward to about
the 19, retreated to the 16 and

threw a 53-yard dump-off pass to
William Pellum. A flag was
thrown but the officials decided
Rosenbach had returned back be
hind the line before throwing the
pass, thus no penalty. The correct
call, illegal forward pass, carries
a loss-of-down penalty and would
have forced Washington State to
punt from its end zone.
Instead the play was allowed to
stand, the Cougars ran three more
minutes off the clock and the Car
dinal finally got the ball on its
24 instead of around midfield.
"I can't believe that that's what
happened," Elway said. "That's
what they called."
The teams traded punts, and

with 5:38 showing on the clock,
Palumbis began a drive at the
Cardinal 29. Palumbis' passing
and Volpe's running moved the
ball to the three and a crucial
fourth-and-one play. Volpe dove
over right tackle for the first
down, then ran for nothing up
the middle. Then, the interception
and the game was over.
"I thought we'd go for it then,"
Elway said, "come back and run
on third and fourth down."
"He was open," Palumbis said.
"I thought I made a good
throw. . . . The guy just made a
great play. Maybe the best place
to put the ball was 30 feet over
his head. . .. We should have won

this game; we didn't. That's the
bottom line. . . . I'll shake it off
and come back for next week."
Stanford will need to be ready
next week when the team travels
to meet UCLA. But although
UCLA is one of the nation's top
teams, the Cardinal knows it has
a chance.
"We're a great football team,"
Palumbis said. "We can beat
anyone in the Pac-10, and they
can beat us obviously. . . . We'll
just go on to the next game."
