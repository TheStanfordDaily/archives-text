# Men's soccer captures tourney
## 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
The Stanford men's soccer team
swept into Columbia, S.C. over
the weekend with but one thing
on its mind: to author a surprise
tournament victory as the final
chapter to an otherwise disap
pointing 1988 season. When the
dust had settled and the sounds
of intense soccer action had ceased
to echo in the surrounding

Carolina pines, Stanford had ac
complished exactly what it had
set out to do. After a win and a

Men's Soccer
Cardinal 0, Hoosiers 0
Cardinal 2, Falcons 0

tie in two days of action, the Car
dinal had pocketed the
Metropolitan Life Soccer Champi
onship.

On Saturday, the Cardinal
preserved their hopes of winning
the tournament by clinging to a
tie against the formidable Indiana
Hoosiers. As would be expected
in a 0-0 tie, the defenses of both
squads controlled the action. For
Stanford, goalkeeper Chris Hel
ling and fullback Mark Semioli
led the way, continuing the pat
tern of excellence that they have
established for the Cardinal de
fense all fall.

Coming off the tie versus the
15-3-2, eighth-ranked Hoosiers,
the Cardinal must have felt a
surge of confidence. The Stanford
men sensed the opportunity to
close out the season on an upbeat
note, but the Air Force Academy,
a top-20 team earlier in the
season, stood squarely in their
path.
Throughout the first half of the
game on Sunday, it appeared that
Stanford was destined for its sec
ond consecutive scoreless tie in
24 hours. Stanford and Air Force
went into the halftime intermis
sion deadlocked at zero. And after
30 minutes of the second half,
neither team had surged in front.
At 74:59, however, the Chris
Porch show commenced. The
Stanford forward took a long cross
in the goal box and angled away
from the goalie toward the
endline. "He didn't see anything
opening up, so he tried to cross
it back across the goal mouth,"
Stanford Asst.Coach Tom Austin
said. "His cross ended up angling
toward the goal, and the ball
caught the keeper off guard."
Porch was not satisfied with the
Cardinal's one-goal margin, how
ever. In fact, 56 seconds after his
score, Porch chipped in another
strike. While his first shot may
have been attributed to Cardinal
luck, his second goal left no
doubts in the minds of the Air
Force players that it was
legitimate.
The ball was cleared from the
Cardinal end, and Rhett Harty
headed it to Porch, who was
streaking for the Falcon goal.
Porch beat the Air Force goalie
and salted away a Cardinal vic
tory, both in one scoring stroke.
Helling repelled all further Falcon
scoring attempts to preserve the
2-0 victory, which ran Stanford's
final record to 11-9-1.
The Cardinal, by all means,
stuck around for the day's second
contest, Indiana against the Uni
versity of South Carolina. Stan
ford had a definite interest in the
match; because of Saturday's
results, if Indiana won by one goal
or tied USC, Stanford would come
away as tournament champion. As
if fate were smiling on the Car
dinal at this (extremely late) junc
ture in the season, the Hoosiers
did tie the Gamecocks, allowing
the Cardinal s 1-0-1 tourney per
formance to secure them the
championship.
