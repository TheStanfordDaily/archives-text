# Card football '88: Giving it their all

▼ V Scott Palmbush
said after the Stanford Cardi
nal succumbed to Washington
State Saturday. It was a tough
loss to be sure, ending on a
last-second interception.

Palmbush and his team
mates were defeated but not
deflated. They had taken to the
gridiron for the ninth time this
season and come up with their
eighth chance at victory.
Unfortunately, as everyone
knows, the team only has three
wins to show for it.
But the squad was one de
fensive stand away from a win
against USC. Same against
Oregon State. One score away
from a stunning comeback
against Washington. Two yards
from a touchdown this past
weekend against the Cougars.
One might think these guys
would get discouraged, not give
it their best each week, maybe
get a bit surly with the media.
Nope.
Instead, week-in week-out
they keep on plugging away. "I
don't think there's a guy in
there who isn't giving it all he's
got," linebacker Jono Tunney
said.
Surely, those who've watched
the team play this year would
agree witn Tunney's assess
ment. Palmbush commented,
"It takes a lot of character to
get up every week for these
things."
And, character is one thing
this year's Cardinal certainly
has in abundance.
Win, lose or draw, the
players are always forthcoming
with the media. They are
humble and take the blame for
their mistakes.

It would be a difficult task
to find someone on the squad
who is more concerned with
succeeding personally than as
a team.
I asked Tunney if he was
pleased with the phenomenal
season he was having and his
response was, "It doesn't mat
ter if we don't get the wins."
When Jason Palumbis com
pleted 72 percent of his passes
a couple weeks back, nearly all
he talked about was how many
mistakes he made.
Fullback Jon Volpe continues
to pile up yardage at a pace
that will shatter the Stanford
single-season record. He's only
a sophomore and will probably
get better.
Swelled head? Hah! In inter
views, Volpe rarely lets a min
ute go by without heaping
praise on the offensive line.
And, despite the win-loss
record, the team has never
come close to throwing in the
towel on the rest of the season.
Tunney said, "We've got two
more games left" in reference
to a question about whether
there were positives the team
could take into next year.
"We nevpr go into a week of
practice thinking we can't beat
anyone," he added.
Palmbush concurred. "[You]
don't play if you think you're
going to lose."
Tunney seems to define the
word competitor. He's played
the last couple of games on a
sprained ankle that's made it
difficult for him to push off,
but still has been ferocious.
It is a rare sight indeed when
Tunney is not in the vicinity
of the tackle while he's out on
the field. And, more often than
not, he's involved in making it.
But Tunney is just one of
the stars on a Cardinal defense
that really has no bad players.
Not to write off the rest of the
season, (Palmbush thinks, and
I agree, that the team can beat
UCLA) but with Kevin Rich
ardson, Ray Huckestein and
Rick Theder the only defensive
starters graduating, the unit
could be even better next year.
The offense will be solid as
