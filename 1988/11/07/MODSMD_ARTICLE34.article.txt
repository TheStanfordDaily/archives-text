# Keefe breaks nose
## 
### 
Stanford freshman Adam
Keefe, who was supposed to
contribute immediately to the
men's basketball team, suf
fered a setback Friday after
noon when his nose was bro
ken.
Keefe, a 6-foot-9, 230-pound
forward, took an elbow to the
face during practice. According
to Keefe, an initial diagnosis
put him out for four weeks.
Now, the current thinking is
between two and four weeks,
though Keefe will get another
examination today. Stanford's
first regular season game is in
less than two weeks, on Nov.
18 at Montana in the first
round of the Big Apple NIT
tourney.
