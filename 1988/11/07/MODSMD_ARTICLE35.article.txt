Women's Soccer
Cardinal 2, Wildcats 1

NHL game at Madison Square
Garden. What is the game in ques
tion? Saturday's women's soccer
contest involving Stanford and
Chico State. Sounds a little com
ical, huh?
Well, "almost comical" was the
phrase used by senior fullback

Christy McDevitt to describe the
game that occurred four hours
south of the Farm on Chico
State's campus. Forgotten was the
fact that this was the final game
of an up-and-down, emotional
dream season for the entire Car
dinal squad.
Forgotten was the fact that this
was the last appearance in the
cardinal and white for seniors
Carolyn Denney, Beth Egan,
Stacey Keare, and McDevitt. This
game saw an out-of-hand brawl
for-it-all in a game that really
meant nothing to either squad.
The referees, possibly realizing
the relative insignificance of Sat
urday's match, decided to pur
chase seats in the nickel bleachers.
The result was an ugly, scrapping

game that got sloppy in a hurry.
Chico State capitalized in the
chaotic opening minutes by jump
ing out in front with a controver
sial score. Jennifer Rowland
knotted the score at 1-1 with a
first-half goal on an assist from
Denise Denney.
The second half degenerated
rapidly into an even worse display
of soccer. The Wildcats tallied
three yellow cards, a number that
seemed pitifully inadequate in
light of Chico State's rough-'em
up style of play. By the end of
the half, what had started as a
soccer match had metamorphosed
into an all-out shouting match.
Easy to forget was the fact that
a soccer victory was at stake. Not
surprisingly, the Cardinal ended

up chalking up a win over the
weaker Wildcats, their 13th of the
season, after scoring the lone,
second-half goal. Lisa Sime, re
ceiving Denise Denney's second
assist of the game, got the game
winner. In so doing, if it is any
consolation to the Cardinal, Sime
probably preserved a season
ending top-20 national ranking for
Stanford's women.
Stanford Coach Berhane An
deberhan started all of his grad
uating seniors in what could have
been an emotional, classy, career
ending game for those four wom
en. Chico State, as it turned out,
would have absolutely none of this
mushy sentiment. All of the Car
