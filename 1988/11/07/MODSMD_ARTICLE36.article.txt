Columbia football coach
charged with homophobia
The Columbia Gay and Lesbian Alliance
has demanded that Asst. Football Coach
Thomas Gilmore issue a public apology to
an employee of dining services who claims
Gilmore and members of the football team
subjected him to anti-homosexual harass
ment.
The organization says if Gilmore does not
issue an apology acceptable to Jame Muk
herjee by Nov. 1, they will demand he be
fired.
However, Gilmore denies that he or any
players harassed Mukherjee in any way.
The group's charges stem from a comment
card Gilmore submitted in Johnson Dining
Hall reading, in part, "He (Mukherjee) and
another male were kissing behind the
counter." Unsigned cards subsequently ap
peared in the box reading, "Get the homo's
(sic) out of the kitchen you are encouraging
AIDS die!" and "Get rid of the fags who
serve during training table."
Mukherjee claims members of the football

team wrote the latter two cards, and over
two consecutive days "made cat calls and
hooting at me — a blatant and disturbing
form of harassment."

Harvard's gay and lesbian
association splits by gender
Harvard's Gay and Lesbian Students' As
sociation will split into separate groups for
men and women to accomodate "skyrocket
ing" growth and women members' requests
for a larger say in the association.
The shift will make the group an umbrella
organization for the two groups as well as
for Defeat Homophobia, Contact and
Seventh Sense. The two new organizations,
tentatively titled Women-Oriented Women
and Gay Students Association, will take over
social, educational and support roles, mem
bers said yesterday.
"Basically what happened is there's been
a great deal of activity around campus on
gay issues," said senior Clarissa Kripke.

A San Jose State University police officer
caught three men riding stolen bicycles on
campus early last Monday morning. The
men later confessed to stealing them.
Officer Michael Oreschek was on patrol
at 4 a.m. when he saw three men riding
bicycles at Eighth and San Salvador streets,
said Lt. Shannon Maloney. Oreschak became
suspicious when he noticed one of the men
had bolt cutters sticking out of a bag he
was carrying.
The officer stopped two of the men, but
the third one fled, Maloney said. Oreschak
notified other units of the fleeing man, who
was later captured at Third and San Fer
nando streets.
On further investigation Oreschak found
evidence that the bicycles the men were
riding had been stolen, Maloney said.
"The men admitted to stealing the bicycles
after they were arrested," Maloney said.
"They said this was their first time and
they won't do it anymore." gparlan DaUy
