# Poet discusses challenging status quo
## 
### Diane Bisgeier Staff writer 
The possibility of 25 years in
prison and $1.25 million in federal
fines angered religion journalist
and poet Demetria Martinez.
After being indicted on charges
of conspiring to violate immigra
tion laws, poetry became the
medium through which she could
channel that anger which the
daily media barrage suppressed.
Martinez, a Princeton graduate
who contributes to the National
Catholic Reporter and the Albu
querque Journal, shared some of
this poetry in the first part of
the Chicana Speaker Series,
"Making Herstory: Chicanas Con
fronting the System" Thursday
night at El Centro Chicano.
"As a poet, I learned to access
my emotions," Martinez said. In
August of 1986 she accompanied

Lutheran minister Glen Remer-
Thamert down to the Mexican
border to gather information
about the Sanctuary movement.
Sanctuary is trying to aid Latin
American refugees' entrance into
the United States.
After returning, Martinez chose
not to report the trip lest the
identities of the two pregnant Sal
vadoran women she and the min
ister met would be discovered. In
stead, Martinez described the in
cident in a poem titled "Nativity,"
which was later cited in the court
case against her.
Officials of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service
learned of the activities of Mar
tinez and Remer-Thamert and
pressed criminal charges.
A December 1987 indictment
charged the pair with conspiring
to violate immigration laws. "I
should never have been indicted

in the first place," said Martinez,
who along with the minister was
eventually acquitted by the jury.
Martinez said it was unprece
dented for a journalist to be in
dicted while gathering news about
Sanctuary and added that her ac
tions were protected by the First
Amendment. The Constitution
legally protects a reporter who is
"merely present" at a scene, she
added.
"Every day people are getting
plowed down by the legal system,"
Martinez said. She attributed her
ability to escape conviction to her
access to "power" — money or
access to prominent people and
the news media.
As a reporter, Martinez said she
knew how to "tap the press." Her
family also happens to be promi
nent in local politics.
During the trial period, her at
torney had to continually warn
Martinez not to become emotion
al.
"Before the press I had to be
calm," she said. "An angry woman
is not believed in this society; you
are to be as polite as possible."
Although Martinez said she
kept trying to write the "great
indictment poem," it was her con
ditions of gender and ethnicity
that instead came out.
"Poetry became the vehicle by
which I came to express my
anger," she said, adding that her
frustration about who her enemy
really was — the INS, the FBI
or a secret informer — was eased
by her poetry, which was "an at
tempt to name who or what the
oppressor was."
Chicano Fellow Olga Vasquez
said Martinez' experience
prompted the idea for the series,
which focuses on Chicano women
who have drawn on their ethnicity
and gender.
"I think we as women can grow
in this knowledge that all of these
women can bring to us," Vasquez
said of the series, which will also
feature female activists in the
Catholic Church, the United Farm
Workers Union and the film in
dustry.
