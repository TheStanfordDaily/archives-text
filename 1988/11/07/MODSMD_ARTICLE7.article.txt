# Candidates trade barbs in final days
## Campbell and Eshoo spar over mailer 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
With two days to go until the election,
Democrats are angered by a last-minute
mailing that appears to be a Democratic
endorsement of GOP congressional candi
date Tom Campbell.
The mailing has the official Democratic
symbol, a donkey, in the upper left hand
corner and reads, "Take this Democratic
voting guide to the polls." Campbell's name

appears amongst Democra
tic nominees Michael Du
kakis, Leo McCarthy and
several others.
The mailing was spon
sored by Victory '88, an
organization formed by
Democrats and headquar
tered in Los Angeles. The
group is not an official po
litical party.

"Tom Campbell and his campaign hand
lers have been trying throughout his cam
paign to package him as a moderate. Now
they've tried the ultimate deception — to
package him as a Democrat," Campbell's

CAMPAIGN
288.

Democratic opponent Anna Eshoo said.
"This Laßouche-type tactic is clearly de
signed to mislead voters," she added.
Mary Hughes, campaign coordinator for
Eshoo, felt the flier was unfortunate and
disappointing in that it tried to get people

to believe something that
wasn't true.
According to Lewis Bon
signore, press secretary for
Tom Campbell, the mailing
clearly states that Camp
bell is a Republican, a fact
that Campbell insisted be
included and is not re
quired by law.
Furthermore. Victory

'88 approached Campbell. He did not solicit
their support but was pleased to receive
it, Bonsignore added.
