# Candidates trade barbs in final days
## Campbell and Eshoo spar over mailer 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
With two days to go until the election,
Democrats are angered by a last-minute
mailing that appears to be a Democratic
endorsement of GOP congressional candi
date Tom Campbell.
The mailing has the official Democratic
symbol, a donkey, in the upper left hand
corner and reads, "Take this Democratic
voting guide to the polls." Campbell's name

appears amongst Democra
tic nominees Michael Du
kakis, Leo McCarthy and
several others.
The mailing was spon
sored by Victory '88, an
organization formed by
Democrats and headquar
tered in Los Angeles. The
group is not an official po
litical party.

"Tom Campbell and his campaign hand
lers have been trying throughout his cam
paign to package him as a moderate. Now
they've tried the ultimate deception — to
package him as a Democrat," Campbell's

CAMPAIGN
288.

Democratic opponent Anna Eshoo said.
"This Laßouche-type tactic is clearly de
signed to mislead voters," she added.
Mary Hughes, campaign coordinator for
Eshoo, felt the flier was unfortunate and
disappointing in that it tried to get people

to believe something that
wasn't true.
According to Lewis Bon
signore, press secretary for
Tom Campbell, the mailing
clearly states that Camp
bell is a Republican, a fact
that Campbell insisted be
included and is not re
quired by law.
Furthermore. Victory

'88 approached Campbell. He did not solicit
their support but was pleased to receive
it, Bonsignore added.

Eshoo
Jennifer Bryson, chair of the
Stanford College Republicans,
responded to the flier saying that
factually, nothing is incorrect and
called it an "interesting campaign
tactic."
In an effort to counteract the
Victory '88 mailer, the Stanford
Democrats met Saturday night
and made an "emergency distri
bution of 6,000 fliers" telling stu
dents on campus that they had
been deceived, according to Sub
odh Chandra, co-chair of the Stan
ford Democrats.
He added it was underhanded,
sneaky and unethical, but since
the mailing "was done so late in
the game, there's not much we
(Stanford Democrats) can do."
Charges of impropriety and il

legal activities came from both
campaigns yesterday. Bonsignore
denounced the Stanford Demo
crats' flier saying it was mislead
ing and illegal.
The flier shows a photocopy of
part of the Victory '88 mailing
which lists Dukakis, McCarthy
and Campbell. However, the Dem
ocrats' flier does not reprint the
part which says Campbell is a Re
publican.
Also, the flier does not say who
paid for it, information that is
required by law, according to Bon
signore.
Interestingly, Bryson was joined
by a number of students in saying
the Stanford Democrats' flier was
confusing. On a passing glance, it
seemed to be an endorsement of
Campbell they said.
Cliff Staton, a press represen
tative for Eshoo, said the Victory
'88 mailing might also be illegal.
Staton said the disclaimer did not

make it clear whether the other
candidates listed — such as Du
kakis and McCarthy — approved
of having their names associated
with Campbell. In a similar case,
a court ruled that such an omis
sion was illegal.
Bonsignore added that another
Democratic flier, one sent out di
rectly by Eshoo's campaign, is also
misleading. The flier shows a
chart illustrating a drop in the
number of investigations of price
fixing that were being approved
by Campbell while he served as
director of the Federal Bureau of
Competition.
He added that Eshoo never
mentioned that the decrease in
investigations came about because
Campbell sent price-fixing cases
on to the Justice Department to
be criminally prosecuted.
Bonsignore said it is "ridic
ulous" that Eshoo's campaign
staff is accusing Campbell.
