# Hoover director given United Nations post
## 
### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz
last week appointed Hoover Director W.
Glenn Campbell as a special adviser to the
U.S. delegation to the United Nations.
Campbell recently named Shultz an
honorary fellow at Hoover. Shultz is on
leave as a professor at the Graduate School
of Business while he serves as Secretary
of State.
In his new position, Campbell will offer
his counsel to the U.S. delegation to the
43rd session of the United Nation's General
Assembly. A session typically lasts a min
imum of six to nine months, but Campbell
said his appointment could be prematurely
terminated in the "slim chance" Gov. Mi
chael Dukakis wins the presidential elec
tion.
Campbell said his new role as adviser is
only part-time and is "not enough to make
me quit as director."
Campbell's 28-year tenure as director of
Hoover has been marked with controversy,
culminating in his reluctance to step down
as director in August 1989.
In July, Campbell and the Board of Trus
tees seemed to have reached an agreement
that he would step down as director but
continue his fundraising efforts at Hoover
under the title "Counselor for Life." Over
the last month, Campbell has questioned
the arrangement.
Campbell expressed some contempt for
the Counselor for Life title. "Whenever

they (the trustees) think I'm not going to
quit it's 'Counselor for Life' but when they
think I am going to quit it's just 'Coun
selor.'"
Unlike his new title at Hoover, Campbell
had nothing but praise for his position
with the United Nations."lt was nice of
the Secretary of State [to appoint me],"
Campbell said. "It was a thoughtful act on
his part. Who knows — maybe he really
wants my advice."
Campbell is also looking forward to the
perks of his new job, such as attending a
luncheon with Great Britain's Prime Min
ister Margaret Thatcher when she's in town
next month, he said.

Not all were as pleased
as Campbell, however. His
appointment "represents
one more in a countless
number of examples of
close connections between
Hoover and the Reagan
Administration," said Po
litical Science Prof. John
Manley.
Hoover violates "what

the University is supposed to be and claims
to be — an insitution that doesn't actively
engage politically," Manley said.
Hoover's "involvement in highly contro
versial politics" is documented in Hoover's
1982 annual report when Campbell paraded
the partisanship of the institution, the in
vitation extended to Edwin Meese, and"the
reciprocation for Campbell at the United
Nations," Manley charged.
