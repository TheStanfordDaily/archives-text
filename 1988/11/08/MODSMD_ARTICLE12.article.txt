## Bush, Dukakis ready to let the people decide Bush: Election is in the hands of the gods 
### 
HOUSTON (AP) — A buoyant
George Bush ended his presiden
tial quest last night in his adopted
home state of Texas after declar
ing, "It*s in the hands of the gods
and the American people."
Addressing 6,000 enthusistic
supporters in a downtown shop
ping mall, the vice president said,
'Most Americans believe our best
days are still ahead."
With that line, borrowed from
Democratic rival Michael Duka
kis, Bush ended a presidential
campaign he formally begun in
this city nearly 13 months ago.
"It's great to be back where it
all began, right here in Texas,"
said Bush, who maintains a legal
voting residence here in a hotel
suite.
Bush also planned to broadcast
a 30-minute commercial on the
television networks in mid
evening, immediately after one
with Dukakis.
"We took a country that had
lost its confidence and put her
back on her feet," Bush says in
the pre-taped commercial, which
also included praise from Presi
dent Reagan.
On the way to the gala finale
in Houston, the Republican pres
idential nominee barnstormed
three battleground states in the
Middle West — Michigan, Ohio
and Missouri — which have a
combined 54 electoral votes.
Bush told rallies in rural Ash
land, Ohio, and in the Detroit sub
urb of Southfield, Mich., that he
felt momentum building in his fa
vor.
"That advenaline is flowing,"
Bush told a cheering crowd in the
Ashland College gymnasium.
"Our family's together. The coun
try's coming in behind our can

didacy, and I want to win this
election."
Bush appeared with members
of his family and campaign at the
Houston rally, where he couldn't
resist delivering several final
vollies at Dukakis.
"Don't play recession roulette
with the liberal governor of Mas
sachusetts," and said. But the line
getting the biggest cheer was the
oft-repeated campaign refrain
which Bush said "can be summed
up in three short words: no new
taxes."
Earlier, in St. Louis, at his Mis
souri campaign headquarters, he
said, "I feel good, but we're not
going to let up until we finish
tonight.. . . It's in the hands of
the gods and the American
people."
He told volunteers there that

he hoped the harsh campaign talk
of the past few months was over.
"Today is for looking over the
horizon and into the future," he
said.
Earlier, standing before a huge
American flag in a Southfield
shopping mall, the GOP nominee
said he was heading for the finish
"not in a power walk but in a
sprint." It was a mocking refer
ence to Dukakis' favorite form of
exercise, a fast-paced walk with
weights in each hand.
"He slept like a baby," Barbara
Bush, the candidate's wife, told
reporters on Air Force Two.
She reacted philosophically to
the end of the campaign. "What
will be will be," she said, and ex
pressed surprise at the Dukakis'
non-stop final day of campaign
ing. "That's brutal," she said.
