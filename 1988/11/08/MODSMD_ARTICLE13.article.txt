# Determined Dukakis sprints toward finish

### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Mi
chael Dukakis campaigned deter
minedly around the clock and
across the country on the eve of
the presidential election, disput
ing the polls and saying the Dem
ocrats would kick George Bush
"right out of our future."
"I don't need sleep — I'm charg
ing," said the Democratic presi
dential nominee.
He backed up that assertion
with a relentless schedule that had
him campaigning non-stop, with
no more sleep than he could catch
in the seat of his airplane on two
nights of "red-eye" flights across
the continent.
Dukakis campaigned as the sun
rose in Cleveland and St. Louis,
then flew West and spoke to a
crowd estimated at 20,000 people
in downtown San Francisco.
"Yesterday Mr. Bush's handlers
said they had California locked
up," Dukakis said. "I think Cali
fornia is going to lock George
Bush right out of the White
House."
He renewed his criticism that
his Republican rival had borrowed
the Democrats' heroes, themes
and issues, and added:
"Before you know it he'll try
to steal the Democratic donkey.
But he better be careful, because
that donkey's on our side, and
it's going to kick him right —
right out of the White House,
right out of Washington and right
out of our future."
Dukakis won an enthusiastic
reception from the lunchtime
crowd.
He also did more than a dozen
interviews by satellite with tele
vision stations around the nation.
The Democratic nominee was
questioned about Bush's com

ments a day earlier in which the
vice president suggested that if
Dukakis couldn't stand the heat
of negative campaigning, he
should "get out of the kitchen"
— a line coined by former Pres
ident Harry S. Truman.
"I've been in the kitchen for 25
years," Dukakis said. "Mr. Bush
never has. I know how to make
the tough decisions a chief exec
utive has to make."
He then headed for Los Angeles
and a full night of campaigning,
on a schedule that aides calculated
was taking him 8,500 miles to 11
cities and nine states in the 48
hours leading up to the election.
Dukakis also addressed the
voters in a half-hour network tele
vision program last night, just
before Bush did the same.
In the course of the broadcast,

Dukakis spoke of family, jobs,
senior citizens, hunger and farm
ers. He also charged anew that
the Republicans would try to bal
ance the budget by cutting Social
Security, and he called Bush's pro
posal to reduce capital gains taxes
"a new $40 billion, five-year cap
ital gains tax giveaway for the
very rich."
"The race is very, very tight,"
he said as he campaigned yester
day. "It's getting tighter by the
hour."
"They talk a lot about October
surprises in an election cam
paign," Dukakis said. "Tomorrow
we're going to have a November
surprise."
From Los Angeles, Dukakis was
heading homeward to Boston to
vote and await the nation's deci
sion.
