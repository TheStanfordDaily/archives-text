# Soviets celebrate revolution
## NATO representatives attend for first time since 1979 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) - The Soviet
Union celebrated the Bolshevik
Revolution yesterday with an an
nual military parade that also fea
tured upbeat music and posters
with slogans that touted profits
and fashionable fabrics, not anti-
American propaganda.
Tanks, missiles, floats and mar
chers moved through Red Square
in light snow and temperatures
just below freezing, watched by
President Mikhail Gorbachev and
other Kremlin leaders.
All the NATO ambassadors or
their top representees also atten
ded the Revolution Day parade
for the first time since the Soviet
Union sent troops into Afghani
stan in 1979.
The parade marked the 71st an
niversary of Bolshevik Revolu
tion, when Vladimir Lenin led the
Bolsheviks against the Russian
provisional government on Oct.
25, 1917. Although the Soviet Un
ion later changed to the Gregorian
calendar, revising the date to Nov.
7, the uprising is still referred to

as the Great October Revolution.
The T-72 tanks and small mis
siles still clanked across the cob
blestones this year, but the at
mosphere was significantly
lighter, with popular melodies
replacing solemn dirges.
Marchers carried balloons and
paper flowers, and there were
portraits of Lenin and Karl Marx,
but none of the usual pictures of
the Politburo members.
Posters focused on internal
politics, rather than foreign ag
gression. There was none of the
fear-inspiring slogans warning of
the dangers of capitalism, or com
ments on specific East-West dis
putes such as Nicaragua.
Instead, posters promised "War
on the Bureaucracy," one of the
targets of Gorbachev's economic
reform efforts.
Other placards proclaimed
"We're behind perestroika," and
"We're going to raise profits by
1.2 times." Until recently, the
word profit was unacceptable.
"Our fabric is in the best taste!"

promised one factory. "Video!
Fantasy!" promised another, from
one of the new privately run co
operatives.
Also popular were promises of
environmental improvements,
such as "There is ecologically
clean heat!"
A streamer carried by construc
tion workers said: "39,000 new
comfortable flats have been put
into service in Moscow since the
beginning of the year."
The United States, depicted in
recent parades with anti-Reagan
caricatures or with Uncle Sam
plugging his ears against calls for
peace with missiles labeled "Star
Wars," enjoyed a new portrayal
as a peacemaker. One float showed
the silhouettes of workers,
wrapped in Soviet and U.S. flags
destroying missiles with
sledgehammers.
Gorbachev, speaking at a recep
tion later in the day, said changes
in the past 12 months permit con
sideration of "a nuclear-weapon
free and non-violent world."
