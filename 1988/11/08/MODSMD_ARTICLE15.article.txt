# Contras demand commitment

SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) â€”
Nicaraguan guerrillas will
demand that the U.S. president
elect quickly reveal whether he
will support their struggle to over
throw the Sandinista government,
a rebel leader said yesterday.
Wilfredo Montalvan, a member
of the directorate of the rebels'
Nicaraguan Resistance organiza
tion, also said the rebels hope to
obtain renewed U.S. military aid
if Vice President George Bush is
elected president yesterday.
"We will meet with the transi
tion team of the new (U.S.) pres
ident and demand a clear defini
tion over Nicaragua," Montalvan
said by telephone from Miami.

The right-wing rebels, known
as Contras, want "to determine if
the new government of either
Bush or Dukakis will continue to
support the war to defeat once
and for all the Sandinista govern
ment," he said.
The Reagan administration has
backed the rebels, known as Con
tras, since 1981 in their bid to
overthrow the leftist Sandinistas.
The minority of the Contras fled
Nicaragua in recent months to
Honduras after U.S. military aid
expired in February.
The Contras currently are
drawing from a $27 million hu
manitarian aid package approved
by the U.S. Congress.

Montalvan said the Contras
would reject U.S. military aid if
it is provided only to pressure the
Sandinista government into
making democratic reforms.
"We cannot allow our people to
continue to sacrifice themselves
just to keep pressure on the San
dinistas. That is immoral," he
said.
The Sandinistas and rebels
signed a cease-fire pact in March.
President Daniel Ortega has ex
tended the cease-fire on a monthly
basis through the end of Novem
ber, while the Contras say the
cease-fire is indefinite.
Each side accuses the other of
truce violations.
