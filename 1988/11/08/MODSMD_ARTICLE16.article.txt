# China earthquake kills over 600
## 
### 
BEIJING (AP) - A powerful
earthquake struck just inside
China's mountainous southern
border, and two official radio sta
tions reported yesterday that 600
people were killed.
Radio Beying and the Peoples'
Central Broadcasting Station
3uoted the same reporter, Hu
iaqi, about the death toll. Radio
Bering also quoted him as saying
most of the dead were in Shan
mato, a village in Yunnan prov
ince that was nearly wiped out
by the earthquake, which regis
! tered 7.6 on the Richter scale.
I Hu's account could not be con
! firmed independently. An earlier
Radio Beging report said total
casualties were 600, including
*dead and ir\jured.

The State Seismology Bureau
in Beijing, which had reported 18
killed and 54 injured, said it had
no new figures. Dispatches from
the official news agency Xinhua
said at least 37 people were dead
and more than 100 injured.
No telephone service was avail
able to the affected part of Yun
nan province near the Burmese
border. It is sparsely inhabited by
farmers, many from the Lahu and
Va minorities with their own lan
guages and live in houses of wood
and mud.
A Yunnan official reached by
telephone said the provincial gov
ernment had no idea how many
people were killed. Asked whether
600 was a plausible number, he
said: "It might be. It might not

be."
If the death toll of 600 is ac
curate, this would be China's
worst earthquake since the 1976
tremor that hit the northeastern
city of Tangshan. Officials say
242,000 died, but unofficial es
timates put the death toll as high
as 800,000.
That quake measured 7.8 to 8.2
on the Richter scale.
Following Sunday's quake, the
State Seismology Bureau said doz
ens of aftershocks had struck the
Yunnan region through Monday
night, with the strongst measur
ing?^.
Roads to the affected area were
cut and Yunnan authorities or
dered an airlift of food, medicine
and other relief supplies.
