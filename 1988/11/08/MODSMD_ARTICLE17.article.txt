Free needles experiment begins
NEW YORK (AP) — New York City yesterday
began a pilot program to stem the spread of
AIDS by providing drug addicts new hypodermic
needles in exchange for their used ones.
Only two men appeared at Health Department
headquarters in lower Manhattan to get the
needles although the program, which is aimed at
reducing needle sharing among addicts, is in
tended to serve as many as 200 intravenous drug
abusers.
"Today, we're going to have only a handful,"
said health commissioner Dr. Stephen Joseph.
"We're going to build slowly up" over a period
of weeks or months, he predicted.
Under the $240,000 program, which has drawn
heated opposition from conservatives and some
minority group organizations, addicts also will
receive counseling on AIDS and drugs. Another
200 addicts will receive only counseling; over
time, their rate of infection will be compared
with the infection rate of those receiving needles.
The program is open only to addicts over age
18 who have applied for drug treatment and been
denied immediate admission to the city's over
crowded programs.
Train crash in France kills nine
EPERNAY, France (AP) — A passenger train
traveling from Luxembourg to Paris hit a main
tenance car on a service track yesterday and
derailed in a village station in northeastern
France, killing nine railroad employees.
No passengers were killed. Twelve passengers
were ii\jured along with the driver of the train,
but none seriously.
The accident occurred on a track at Ay, a village
near Epernay, 85 miles east of Paris
The maintenance car was on the service track,
and it was not immediately clear why the pas
senger train was directed that way, where railway

employees were working, rather than on the main
line through the station.
"There were bodies everywhere," said Fran
coise Dequeninque, owner of a cafe next to the
station. "The nine workers working on the track
were all killed."
Jacques Fournier, president of the national rail
way, the Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer
Francais, said the train was traveling at 73 mph
when it struck the maintenance car. The locomo
tive and nine of 11 passenger cars left the rails.
Fournier said a rarely used switch apparently
had been thrown to permit maintenance work
on the track.
Judge drops charge against North
WASHINGTON (AP) — One of 16 criminal
charges against former White House aide Oliver
North was dismissed yesterday, without opposi
tion from the prosecution in the Iran-Contra
conspiracy case.
U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell dismissed
a charge that North had fabricated documents
to hide from investigators the fact that arms
dealer Richard Secord had paid for the installa
tion of a $13,800 security fence outside North's
home in suburban Great Falls, Va.
The defense had contended that North could
not be charged with obstruction of justice because
the alleged fabrication did not occur while a
grand jury was investigating the Iran-Contra af
fair.
North was charged with fabricating the docu
ments in December, 1986, a month before the
special federal grand jury that investigated the
case was convened.
North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel and
a former National Security Council aide, is
charged with conspiring to defraud the govern
ment by illegally diverting U.S.-Iran arms-sale
proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels.
