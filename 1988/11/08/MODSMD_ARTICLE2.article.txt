## Profs, comment on million-dollar TV spots by Bush, Dukakis 
### Malinda McCollum With wire reports 
While Presidential candidates Michael
Dukakis and George Bush made their
final punch last night during 30-minute
network appeals, some Stanford profes
sors surmised that the candidates paid
efforts will have little effect on voters.
Dukakis, the underdog, hit on stand
ard Democratic themes in a program
featuring him on the stump, at home
with his family, playing the trumpet
and answering questions from voters at
town meetings.
Vice presidential nominee Lloyd
Bentsen also appeared in the program,
according to excerpts from the script.
He attacked Republican campaign tac

History Prof. Jack Rakove said the
Quayle omission was "not surprising
since Quayle has basically been sent out
to pasture the past six weeks."
Political Science Prof. Hubert Mar

Bush campaign," and,"The less said
about Quayle the better."
Bush's program did include President

Reagan, however, who weighed in with
an endorsement of his eight-year part
ner.
Marshall characterized the Reagan
endorsement as a Bush attempt to ride
Reagan's coattails and noted that "com
mon sense indicates to go with the win
ner.
Political Science Prof. John Manley,
however, disagreed with the coattail the
ory and said he was "impressed with
how little Bush has relied on Reagan."
Rakove also downplayed the coattail
idea and said that the Reagan endorse
ment was just "one president handing
over the reins to another."
Bush discussed his World War II ex
perience as a bomber pilot and the
Reagan administration's economic
record, as well as his own goals of a
