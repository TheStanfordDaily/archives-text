# Buying time in the 11th hour
## Profs, comment on million-dollar TV spots by Bush, Dukakis 
### Malinda McCollum With wire reports 
While Presidential candidates Michael
Dukakis and George Bush made their
final punch last night during 30-minute
network appeals, some Stanford profes
sors surmised that the candidates paid
efforts will have little effect on voters.
Dukakis, the underdog, hit on stand
ard Democratic themes in a program
featuring him on the stump, at home
with his family, playing the trumpet
and answering questions from voters at
town meetings.
Vice presidential nominee Lloyd
Bentsen also appeared in the program,
according to excerpts from the script.
He attacked Republican campaign tac
tics and the qualifications of his GOP
counterpart, Dan Quayle.

Bush's program, which also featured
him with his extensive family, did not
mention Quayle at all.
Some Stanford professors were not
surprised by the omission of Quayle,
saying that Quayle was a not an asset
to the Bush campaign.
English Prof. Jay Fliegelman com
mented last night that Quayle was not
mentioned because "Quayle is a volatile
issue and it would be foolish to take
risks now."
History Prof. Jack Rakove said the
Quayle omission was "not surprising
since Quayle has basically been sent out
to pasture the past six weeks."
Political Science Prof. Hubert Mar
shall remarked that "the Quayle selec
tion is the biggest single mistaike in the
Bush campaign," and,"The less said
about Quayle the better."
Bush's program did include President

Reagan, however, who weighed in with
an endorsement of his eight-year part
ner.
Marshall characterized the Reagan
endorsement as a Bush attempt to ride
Reagan's coattails and noted that "com
mon sense indicates to go with the win
ner.
Political Science Prof. John Manley,
however, disagreed with the coattail the
ory and said he was "impressed with
how little Bush has relied on Reagan."
Rakove also downplayed the coattail
idea and said that the Reagan endorse
ment was just "one president handing
over the reins to another."
Bush discussed his World War II ex
perience as a bomber pilot and the
Reagan administration's economic
record, as well as his own goals of a
strong country free of crime, pol
lution and drugs.
Marshall remarked that Bush's
reference to his war record would
have a "very minor effect" on the
general public although it may ap
peal to "people who are very
patriotic or oriented toward war."
At some points in his half-hour,
Bush stepped away from the often
harsh rhetoric of his campaign.
"No hard feelings," he said. "It
was nothing but a generous spirit
of competition." Bush added that
he respected his opponent.
But in other segments he re
emphasized his criticism of Du
kakis for opposing the death
penalty, school prayer and a law
requiring teachers to lead the
Pledge of Allegiance. And he
added, "My opponent has no ex
perience in national security af

fairs. I don't believe we can take
a risk on an issue as important
as our national security."
Manley said Bush's attempt will
do little to change the public's
view of a largely negative cam
paign. According to Manley,
Bush's tactics have created "a
hurt that's going to take a long
time to go away."
Marshall speculated that the
vice president's effort to tone
down his rhetoric was prompted
by Dukakis' recent attacks on
Bush's negative campaigning tac
tics.
In the course of the broadcast
Dukakis addressed questions
continue its international commit
ments to decentralization of gov
ernment and greater freedom of
citizens, he said.
Samuel Amarel, a visiting his
tory professor from the Univer
sity of La Plata, Argentina,
sharply disagreed with Anderson.
"The common ground of both can
didates is much more important

than their differences," he said.
Regardless of who is elected,
Amarel said, the new president
will have to deal with the prob
lems created in Latin America by
U.S. debt, the supply of drugs
flowing into the United States and
the developing nuclear technolo
gies of Third World countries.
Amarel said Argentina is within
six months of nuclear weapon ca
pabilities.
Senior Hoover Fellow Henry
Rowen agreed with Amarel,
downplaying the effect of the pres
idential election on international
policy. Though the next four years
will be very important, Congress
and the fiscal deficit will act as
"impressive constraints" on either
George Bush or Dukakis, Rowen
said.
"It doesn't matter who's presi
dent," he said. "There just isn't
any money."
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy predicted Bush will
win the election and agreed the

new president will be tightly
bound by congressional restraints.
Many congressmen are skeptical
about Bush's role in the Iran-
Contra affair, which might fur
ther restrict his policy initiatives,
he said.
Anderson also defended the
"mudslinging" that other
panelists felt had dominated the
race. "Politics is a contact sport,"
he said. "It ain't a beanbag."

about Quayle the better."
Bush's program did include President

Reagan, however, who weighed in with
an endorsement of his eight-year part
ner.
Marshall characterized the Reagan
endorsement as a Bush attempt to ride
Reagan's coattails and noted that "com
mon sense indicates to go with the win
ner.
Political Science Prof. John Manley,
however, disagreed with the coattail the
ory and said he was "impressed with
how little Bush has relied on Reagan."
Rakove also downplayed the coattail
idea and said that the Reagan endorse
ment was just "one president handing
over the reins to another."
Bush discussed his World War II ex
perience as a bomber pilot and the
Reagan administration's economic
record, as well as his own goals of a
strong country free of crime, pol
lution and drugs.
Marshall remarked that Bush's
reference to his war record would
have a "very minor effect" on the
general public although it may ap
peal to "people who are very
patriotic or oriented toward war."
At some points in his half-hour,
Bush stepped away from the often
harsh rhetoric of his campaign.
"No hard feelings," he said. "It
was nothing but a generous spirit
of competition." Bush added that
he respected his opponent.
But in other segments he re
emphasized his criticism of Du
kakis for opposing the death
penalty, school prayer and a law
requiring teachers to lead the
Pledge of Allegiance. And he
added, "My opponent has no ex
perience in national security af

fairs. I don't believe we can take
a risk on an issue as important
as our national security."
Manley said Bush's attempt will
do little to change the public's
view of a largely negative cam
paign. According to Manley,
Bush's tactics have created "a
hurt that's going to take a long
time to go away."
Marshall speculated that the
vice president's effort to tone
down his rhetoric was prompted
by Dukakis' recent attacks on
Bush's negative campaigning tac
tics.
In the course of the broadcast
Dukakis addressed questions
continue its international commit
ments to decentralization of gov
ernment and greater freedom of
citizens, he said.
Samuel Amarel, a visiting his
tory professor from the Univer
sity of La Plata, Argentina,
sharply disagreed with Anderson.
"The common ground of both can
didates is much more important

than their differences," he said.
Regardless of who is elected,
Amarel said, the new president
will have to deal with the prob
lems created in Latin America by
U.S. debt, the supply of drugs
flowing into the United States and
the developing nuclear technolo
gies of Third World countries.
Amarel said Argentina is within
six months of nuclear weapon ca
pabilities.
Senior Hoover Fellow Henry
Rowen agreed with Amarel,
downplaying the effect of the pres
idential election on international
policy. Though the next four years
will be very important, Congress
and the fiscal deficit will act as
"impressive constraints" on either
George Bush or Dukakis, Rowen
said.
"It doesn't matter who's presi
dent," he said. "There just isn't
any money."
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy predicted Bush will
win the election and agreed the

new president will be tightly
bound by congressional restraints.
Many congressmen are skeptical
about Bush's role in the Iran-
Contra affair, which might fur
ther restrict his policy initiatives,
he said.
Anderson also defended the
"mudslinging" that other
panelists felt had dominated the
race. "Politics is a contact sport,"
he said. "It ain't a beanbag."
While Presidential candidates Michael
Dukakis and George Bush made their
final punch last night during 30-minute
network appeals, some Stanford profes
sors surmised that the candidates paid
efforts will have little effect on voters.
Dukakis, the underdog, hit on stand
ard Democratic themes in a program
featuring him on the stump, at home
with his family, playing the trumpet
and answering questions from voters at
town meetings.
Vice presidential nominee Lloyd
Bentsen also appeared in the program,
according to excerpts from the script.
He attacked Republican campaign tac
tics and the qualifications of his GOP
counterpart, Dan Quayle.

Bush's program, which also featured
him with his extensive family, did not
mention Quayle at all.
Some Stanford professors were not
surprised by the omission of Quayle,
saying that Quayle was a not an asset
to the Bush campaign.
English Prof. Jay Fliegelman com
mented last night that Quayle was not
mentioned because "Quayle is a volatile
issue and it would be foolish to take
risks now."
History Prof. Jack Rakove said the
Quayle omission was "not surprising
since Quayle has basically been sent out
to pasture the past six weeks."
Political Science Prof. Hubert Mar
shall remarked that "the Quayle selec
tion is the biggest single mistaike in the
Bush campaign," and,"The less said
about Quayle the better."
Bush's program did include President

Reagan, however, who weighed in with
