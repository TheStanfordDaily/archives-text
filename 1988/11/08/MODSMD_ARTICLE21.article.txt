"To me the greatest poverty is . . . abor
tion: the fear of the unborn child. The
child must die; the child must be killed
so that we don't have to feed one more
child, we don't have to educate one more
child. Terrible!"
— Mother Teresa
MY CONSCIENCE tells me there
is something morally repulsive
about taking the life of an inno
cent, unborn child. But does the state
have the right to legislate this particular
view? The crucial issue politically, espe
cially in light of today's presidential elec
tion, is whether the government should
prevent pregnant women from having
abortions.
Before I address that issue, I would
first like to support my personal stance
against taking the life of the unborn. As
I outline just two of the many arguments
against abortion, I encourage you not to
fall for the fallacy that men have no place
in this debate. For what difference would
it make whether I wrote this article or
a female friend of mine wrote this article?
Furthermore, when does a man become
a father? It is not who does the arguing
that matters, but rather, the quality of
the argument.
First, the superficial differences be
tween a new-born baby and an unborn
child does not justify preserving the life
of one and not the other. Development
cannot be used as a gauge to measure
when life begins. Life is a continuum —
it would be a mistake to take "freeze
frames" of fetal development at different
stages, somehow quantify them and then

conclude that one "freeze-frame" consti
tutes a human life but not the other.
Just think of the horrendous conse
quences if the conclusion came out to be
wrong.
Second, the quality of life of the mother
cannot precede the life of the unborn
child. For those who believe, as I do, that
the unborn child is a human being, then
there exists almost no circumstance un
der which the unborn child can be killed.
Although I sympathize with the incred
ible difficulties an unwanted pregnancy
presents, I believe the convenience of the
pregnant woman cannot take priority
over the life of another human being.
This argument, however, brings up the
isgue of whether the government has the
right to force a pregnant woman to carry
out her pregnancy.
On one hand, there are those who argue
the state has no right to interfere with
the woman's decision to have an abortion.
In a certain sense, I agree. Choosing to
take the life of your unborn child is a
very difficult, often harrowing and ex
tremely personal choice.
I believe it is your conscience that is
the strongest deterrent against abortion.
If you can live with your conscience and
still go ahead and abort, or help abort
an unborn child, then there's not much
the government can do to stop you.
On the other hand, there are those
who argue the state should make abortion
illegal because the right to life of the
unborn child is being violated. In a certain
sense, I also agree. Each day over 4,000
women choose to take the life of their
unborn child. In a hierarchy of values,

the right to life necessarily precedes the
right to choose.
Although I see compelling arguments
on both sides, I ultimately have to side
with protecting the right to life of the
unborn child. But that doesn't mean I'm
against women's rights — quite the con
trary. I resent the implication that being
for women's rights necessarily implies I
have to be pro-choice.
And if I may digress, that is why I
agree with Jennifer Bryson's point, in
her Nov. 2 letter, that the Stanford Wom
en's Center should "be a service to all
women of the Stanford community," not
just those who are pro-choice. The Wom
en's Center would be making a grave
mistake to imply that being pro-choice is
a necessary prerequisite for membership.
In the final analysis, the abortion issue
will determine whether I vote today for
George Bush, who's been pro-life since
1980, or Michael Dukakis — perhaps the
most pro-choice person ever to run for
president.
My conscience will not permit me to
vote for the latter.

the state has no right to interfere with
the woman's decision to have an abortion.
In a certain sense, I agree. Choosing to
take the life of your unborn child is a
very difficult, often harrowing and ex
tremely personal choice.
I believe it is your conscience that is
the strongest deterrent against abortion.
If you can live with your conscience and
still go ahead and abort, or help abort
an unborn child, then there's not much
the government can do to stop you.
On the other hand, there are those
who argue the state should make abortion
illegal because the right to life of the
unborn child is being violated. In a certain
sense, I also agree. Each day over 4,000
women choose to take the life of their
unborn child. In a hierarchy of values,

the right to life necessarily precedes the
right to choose.
Although I see compelling arguments
on both sides, I ultimately have to side
with protecting the right to life of the
unborn child. But that doesn't mean I'm
against women's rights — quite the con
trary. I resent the implication that being
for women's rights necessarily implies I
have to be pro-choice.
And if I may digress, that is why I
agree with Jennifer Bryson's point, in
her Nov. 2 letter, that the Stanford Wom
en's Center should "be a service to all
women of the Stanford community," not
just those who are pro-choice. The Wom
en's Center would be making a grave
mistake to imply that being pro-choice is
a necessary prerequisite for membership.
In the final analysis, the abortion issue
will determine whether I vote today for
George Bush, who's been pro-life since
1980, or Michael Dukakis — perhaps the
most pro-choice person ever to run for
president.
My conscience will not permit me to
vote for the latter.
