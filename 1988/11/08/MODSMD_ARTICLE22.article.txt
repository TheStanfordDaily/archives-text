SO THE DUKE has finally de
fended himself from those wild
charges and even criticized the
Republican advertising.
He still can't bring himself to go for
his opponent's jugular. It's time to stop
beating around the bush and start
telling a few unpleasant truths about
the GOP hopeful.
The fact is that picking Dan Quayle
was Geoge Bush's smartest move. His
running mate has been an invaluable
decoy, drawing the harshest attacks
himself and making folks forget the
unbearable lightness of George Bush.
Capitol Hill observers agree on one
thing about Senator Quayle: He was —
somehow — elected to the U.S. Senate.
The fellow at the top of the ticket
never got that far.
After a career in the House of Rep
resentatives so short it makes a certain
Massachusetts governor lode tall by
comparison, George's bid for the Sen
ate was blocked by an ol' Texas bush
wacker from way back named Lloyd
Bentsen.
Since then poor George has never
been elected to any office on his own.
He was appointed to one sub-cabinet
level position after another, but, until
Reagan chose him as his understudy,
he was never able to hold down the
same job for more than a year or so.
The brevity of Bush's tenure in each
post doubtless explains how he man
aged to come and go so often without
leaving any mark. In Peking he is best
remembered for getting out of the way
while Henry Kissinger handled rela
tions with China.
At the CIA he is remembered for
not standing by his agency's own
estimates of Soviet strength. And
at the United Nations — well, at
the U.N. he's just not remembered at
all.
Anyone else might have been frus
trated and discouraged by never having

the chance to accomplish anything. Not
George Bush. Our man realized he had
discovered his true calling. He rose to
the challenge and sought out the one
national office where he could fulfill
his vocation: the vice-presidency.
In the do-nothing Olympics, the
vice-presidency is the marathon. No
ordinary mortal could do nothing for
eight straight years with never a
break. Of course, the common mistake
is to assume that doing nothing is
passive.
In reality, it demands an active
effort. Only by dint of unswerving
concentration can one sit through
countless meeting on arms-for-hostage
deals without hearing anything. Only
by tirelessly flexing those neck muscles
can one steadily look the other way
while a key aide helps Contra smug
glers whose motto is "things go better
with coke."
George Bush's career in public serv
ice has been founded on the principle
that they also serve who stand and
wait.
Let's be fair. The man did serve his
country in World War 11, and he came
home a hero. As a fighter pilot, his
plane was touched by enemy fire.
A puff of smoke appeared.
Would the plane catch fire? Should
he attempt an emergency landing on
water? It was the type of split-second,
do-or-die decision only a true leader
could make. And Bush proved his
capacity to lead by being the first one
out the hatch with a parachute.
In fact, he was the only one to bail
out. All of his crew members died.
That's what comes of taking a ride in
a pilotless plane. The Duke's too nice a
guy to remind voters of that pilotless
plane. But it's an image they might
want to meditate as they decide
whether to take a plunge on Bush.
