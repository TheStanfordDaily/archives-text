## Creative missspelling and the ungruntled Exercist 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
Intelligence and compassion, these are
the qualities you should be voting for
when you vote for the president of the
United States today. Therefore, you will
have to find a viable write-in candidate.
The Bug recommends you choose either
Sally Field or Nipsey Russell.
Also, if you are finished voting before
your Constitutionally-granted 10 minutes
are up, as an American citizen it is your
right and duty to use that democratic
time effectively.
The Bug suggests you bring a change
of clothing and then exit the booth in a
sunshine-fresh outfit indicative of the
pride no voter can help but experience
upon perpetuating the American system
set up two centuries ago by wealthy white
men.
Drop your question into the Bug Me
box at the Daily offices or send it via
the Lots letter service to B.Bug-me.
Dear Bug,
As I was perusing this paragon of jour
nalistic excellence, I chanced upon an
alien expression. In the midst of a fine
investigative report was wedged the word
wretching. Elated at the thought of in
corporating a new jewel into my linguistic
treasure trove, I quickly consulted my
Webster's New World Dictionary, Second
College edition. To my dismay, I found
no reference to this mysterious participle.
Reduced to hysteria, I phoned Calvin
Trillin, in hopes of elucidation. But he
was no help. Please save me.

Firstly, the Bug should say that while
he usually substitutes the name of an
obliquely relevant historical figure,
celebrity or artist as the question's au
thor, this letter already had a suitable
signature. And though the Bug doubts
the nation's most luminous linguaphile
really wrote this letter, he will pretend
the gem of a columnist, Safire (intended),
actually has deferred to his omniscience.
While this word wretching did not ap
pear in the Bug's column, it was present
in a front page story, and was certainly
encountered by thousands of readers. In
the Bug's line of thinking, though crooked
it may be, what is technically a misspell
ing of the word retching is actually an
effective, innovative term which, despite
its disloyalty to proper English, is
legitimate.
Spoken words emphasize particular
meaning at certain moments due to in
tonation and stress in the voice of the
speaker. Similarly, written words can be
enhanced by intentional misspelling.
Thus, retching, as in pseudovomiting or,
less delicately, dry heaving, ought to be
spelled with a w to form wretching. With
this new spelling, the meaning of
wretched is incorporated to strengthen
the image.
This is not the only word which when
misspelled is given a spicier meaning.
Another is time when it is spelled thyme.
Although editors innocently screwed this
one up, the Bug used the word semi
litterate a couple weeks ago to describe
people who throw trash neither onto the
ground nor into garbage cans, but rather
through sewer grates or into mailboxes.

Miscapitalization is another handy
method of improving written communi
cation. For example, when the word subtle
is used facetiously with stupid people who
will think it is being used in earnest, the
b should be capitalized: "Looking ner
vously at all the cashiers and shaking
violently, the shoplifter was very sußtle
as she pocketed the Milk Duds."

A sophisticated
humorist, however,
might pull what is tech
nically called a jocose
switcheroo, and advise
departing visitors to
'Drive wrecklessly!'

It is not always wise to add letters for
deeper meaning. Some words have their
intended meaning completely reversed by
one addendum. For example, the word
reckless, as describing careless abandon
of action, should not be spelled wreckless.
A sophisicated humorist, however, might
pull what is technically called a jocose
switcheroo, and advise departing visitors
to "Drive wrecklessly!"
Dear Bug,
"The Dish" is advertised as this "big
deal" place to go running or hiking on
campus; and yet, the main trail leading

up from Campus Drive is a horrifying
collection of ruts and loose rocks. Is this
a plot by the Hooverites (having failed to
get the whole thing replaced by a shrine
to Reaganism) to make Donald Kennedy
stumble and break his neck? If I twist
my ankle can I sue? Why doesn't the
University do something about improving
the Dish trail?

Whattayouknow but that your wish
was in the process of being granted even
before your letter reached the Bug. Ahhh,
the power of journalism ...
Anyways, first off,the Bug contacted
an Operations and Maintenance field en
gineer, Marty Beene. Beene said that al
though that road is so often used by
joggers, it is never used by maintenance
and research employees driving up into
the foothills. Thus, it is rather low on
the priority list when it comes to budget
allotment.
He recognized its popularity as a
recreational area and expressed regret
that the road was not more rigorously
maintained, but said financial restric
tions considerably limit projects.
Beene, however, suggested that Tom
Richman, who works in the Campus Plan
ning Office, might have more positive
information. Richman kept it short and
simple. He said that a project to resurface
the road is underway and should be com
pleted within six months.
But, in the third place, what's the story
behind this running stuff anyway? I
mean, unless you're going to get some
cash in return, why would you go through
the trouble of changing into your Span

dex, sweating, panting and exponentially
tripling the g-force absorbed by your
knees just to run up and down a hill?
Is there some psychological benefit
derived from intense chafing and general
dampness that I'm not aware of? And
why should people have to worry about
whether or not their sentences end with
a preposition when there are so many
impoverished people in this country?
The Bug's reaction to the silly, shallow
concern with both fitness and proper
grammar can be best expressed through
this profound riddle:
Q: What did one running shoe say to
the other when a fat man walked into
the sporting goods store?
A: Nothing, running shoes can't talk.
Until next week, the Bug has spoken.

Dear Bug,
As I was perusing this paragon of jour
nalistic excellence, I chanced upon an
alien expression. In the midst of a fine
investigative report was wedged the word
wretching. Elated at the thought of in
corporating a new jewel into my linguistic
treasure trove, I quickly consulted my
Webster's New World Dictionary, Second
College edition. To my dismay, I found
no reference to this mysterious participle.
Reduced to hysteria, I phoned Calvin
Trillin, in hopes of elucidation. But he
was no help. Please save me.

Firstly, the Bug should say that while
he usually substitutes the name of an
obliquely relevant historical figure,
celebrity or artist as the question's au
thor, this letter already had a suitable
signature. And though the Bug doubts
the nation's most luminous linguaphile
really wrote this letter, he will pretend
the gem of a columnist, Safire (intended),
actually has deferred to his omniscience.
While this word wretching did not ap
pear in the Bug's column, it was present
in a front page story, and was certainly
encountered by thousands of readers. In
the Bug's line of thinking, though crooked
it may be, what is technically a misspell
ing of the word retching is actually an
effective, innovative term which, despite
its disloyalty to proper English, is
legitimate.
Spoken words emphasize particular
meaning at certain moments due to in
tonation and stress in the voice of the
speaker. Similarly, written words can be
enhanced by intentional misspelling.
Thus, retching, as in pseudovomiting or,
less delicately, dry heaving, ought to be
spelled with a w to form wretching. With
this new spelling, the meaning of
wretched is incorporated to strengthen
the image.
This is not the only word which when
misspelled is given a spicier meaning.
Another is time when it is spelled thyme.
Although editors innocently screwed this
one up, the Bug used the word semi
litterate a couple weeks ago to describe
people who throw trash neither onto the
ground nor into garbage cans, but rather
through sewer grates or into mailboxes.

Miscapitalization is another handy
method of improving written communi
cation. For example, when the word subtle
is used facetiously with stupid people who
will think it is being used in earnest, the
b should be capitalized: "Looking ner
vously at all the cashiers and shaking
violently, the shoplifter was very sußtle
as she pocketed the Milk Duds."

A sophisticated
humorist, however,
might pull what is tech
nically called a jocose
switcheroo, and advise
departing visitors to
'Drive wrecklessly!'

It is not always wise to add letters for
deeper meaning. Some words have their
intended meaning completely reversed by
one addendum. For example, the word
reckless, as describing careless abandon
of action, should not be spelled wreckless.
A sophisicated humorist, however, might
pull what is technically called a jocose
switcheroo, and advise departing visitors
to "Drive wrecklessly!"
Dear Bug,
"The Dish" is advertised as this "big
deal" place to go running or hiking on
campus; and yet, the main trail leading

up from Campus Drive is a horrifying
collection of ruts and loose rocks. Is this
a plot by the Hooverites (having failed to
get the whole thing replaced by a shrine
to Reaganism) to make Donald Kennedy
stumble and break his neck? If I twist
my ankle can I sue? Why doesn't the
University do something about improving
the Dish trail?

Whattayouknow but that your wish
was in the process of being granted even
before your letter reached the Bug. Ahhh,
the power of journalism ...
Anyways, first off,the Bug contacted
an Operations and Maintenance field en
gineer, Marty Beene. Beene said that al
though that road is so often used by
joggers, it is never used by maintenance
and research employees driving up into
the foothills. Thus, it is rather low on
the priority list when it comes to budget
allotment.
He recognized its popularity as a
recreational area and expressed regret
that the road was not more rigorously
maintained, but said financial restric
tions considerably limit projects.
Beene, however, suggested that Tom
Richman, who works in the Campus Plan
ning Office, might have more positive
information. Richman kept it short and
simple. He said that a project to resurface
the road is underway and should be com
pleted within six months.
But, in the third place, what's the story
behind this running stuff anyway? I
mean, unless you're going to get some
cash in return, why would you go through
the trouble of changing into your Span

dex, sweating, panting and exponentially
tripling the g-force absorbed by your
knees just to run up and down a hill?
Is there some psychological benefit
derived from intense chafing and general
dampness that I'm not aware of? And
why should people have to worry about
whether or not their sentences end with
a preposition when there are so many
impoverished people in this country?
The Bug's reaction to the silly, shallow
concern with both fitness and proper
grammar can be best expressed through
this profound riddle:
Q: What did one running shoe say to
the other when a fat man walked into
the sporting goods store?
A: Nothing, running shoes can't talk.
Until next week, the Bug has spoken.


BUG ME
Intelligence and compassion, these are
the qualities you should be voting for
when you vote for the president of the
United States today. Therefore, you will
have to find a viable write-in candidate.
The Bug recommends you choose either
Sally Field or Nipsey Russell.
Also, if you are finished voting before
your Constitutionally-granted 10 minutes
are up, as an American citizen it is your
right and duty to use that democratic
time effectively.
The Bug suggests you bring a change
of clothing and then exit the booth in a
sunshine-fresh outfit indicative of the
pride no voter can help but experience
upon perpetuating the American system
set up two centuries ago by wealthy white
men.
Drop your question into the Bug Me
