# Stanford Polo Club plays fast and drives hard toward goals

Like chess, the players need to
think several moves ahead. Unlike
chess, polo risks life and limb; it
is ranked second only to hang
gliding and sky diving in its degree
of danger, according to the U.S.
Commission on Physical Fitness.
This, however, does not stop the
recently rejuvenated and growing
Stanford Polo Club. After a few
decades of reticence, the club is
looking further ahead than the
next few plays, toward a stronger
and fast playing future.
The Stanford Polo Club has ex
isted since the beginning of the
University. After a heyday in the
19305, when the ROTC provided
horses that could serve as mounts
for cavalry patrol, the club even
tually died out as the Army
stopped furnishing the horses.
Four students brought polo
back to life at Stanford in 1980.
Over the last three years mem
bership has increased to about 15
members, and new members con

tinue to join.
Currently, the club has 11
horses. Because three of the
horses are unfit for the rigors of
polo riding, the club expects to
add six more horses by the end
of the month.
The Stanford Polo Club com
petes five to six times each quar
ter, peaking for the winter
Regional Polo Tournament. If the
team qualifies in this meet, they
go to the National Collegiate Ath
letic Association finals. Some of
the stronger polo teams in Cali
fornia include UC-Davis, Univer
sity of Southern California and
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo.
Other strong Pac 10 Conference
teams include Arizona State and
Oregon State. Stanford competes
with these teams individually,
before meeting them again at the
regional qualifier.
The president of the club, Ann
Wimmer, predicts great things for
the team this year. "I think if we
work hard, we could qualify (for
the NCAAs)," she says.

The team proved their mettle
on Sunday in an informal tour
nament at the Webb Ranch in Por
tola Valley where the team
practices. In an unanticipated vic
tory, Stanford beat a team from
Pebble Beach and a smaller local
team. "We didn't expect to win,"
says public relations manager
Melissa Harrington, a graduate
student in neurobiology.
Polo requires considerable ex
perience with horses before one
can learn to play, but many of
the members who had previously
worked with horses, tried the
sport for the first time at Stan
ford, according to senior Christy
Craven, horse manager for the
team.
The game revolves around the
so-called "line of the ball," which
serves to keep the play directed
towards one end of the field. The
four players are arranged in of
fensive and defensive positions,
with the aim of driving the ball

through the opponent's goal posts.
"To be a polo player, you need
to think fast — you need to be
two to three plays ahead," ex
plains Craven. "Polo is a very fast
sport — it's also a team sport."
Due to its high risk, safety is
a mayor consideration in the prac
tice for and playing of the game.
"Every single rule in polo is there
for safety reasons," Wimmer says.
The Stanford polo club pays
special attention to reducing the
danger of the sport. "We play rela
tively slow and when we learn,
we stress safety," says Craven.
The only serious injury in the

recent history of the club occurred
just over a year ago when Har
rington broke her arm. She wound
up in the hospital for eight days
with a compound fracture.
Often thought of as a sport for
the wealthy, conjuring up images
of lavish royal tournaments
featuring Prince Charles and
friends, polo does involve high ex
penses. The Stanford team, how
ever, keeps them to a minimum.
Each horse costs the polo club
about $100 per month, and club
dues are $125 per quarter.
Wimmer says polo is an expen
sive sport because horses are ex
pensive to maintain. Grain prices
have doubled due to the drought
and this has consequently raised
the operating costs of the polo
club.

As a non-profit organization,
the club receives nearly $10,000
per year from the University, with
the rest of the money raised
through donations, the sale of
club T-shirts and sweatshirts and
volunteer work.
