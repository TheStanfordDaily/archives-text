Like chess, the players need to
think several moves ahead. Unlike
chess, polo risks life and limb; it
is ranked second only to hang
gliding and sky diving in its degree
of danger, according to the U.S.
Commission on Physical Fitness.
This, however, does not stop the
recently rejuvenated and growing
Stanford Polo Club. After a few
decades of reticence, the club is
looking further ahead than the
next few plays, toward a stronger
and fast playing future.
The Stanford Polo Club has ex
isted since the beginning of the
University. After a heyday in the
19305, when the ROTC provided
horses that could serve as mounts
for cavalry patrol, the club even
tually died out as the Army
stopped furnishing the horses.
Four students brought polo
back to life at Stanford in 1980.
Over the last three years mem
bership has increased to about 15
members, and new members con

tinue to join.
Currently, the club has 11
horses. Because three of the
horses are unfit for the rigors of
polo riding, the club expects to
add six more horses by the end
of the month.
The Stanford Polo Club com
petes five to six times each quar
ter, peaking for the winter
Regional Polo Tournament. If the
team qualifies in this meet, they
go to the National Collegiate Ath
letic Association finals. Some of
the stronger polo teams in Cali
fornia include UC-Davis, Univer
sity of Southern California and
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo.
Other strong Pac 10 Conference
teams include Arizona State and
Oregon State. Stanford competes
with these teams individually,
before meeting them again at the
regional qualifier.
The president of the club, Ann
Wimmer, predicts great things for
the team this year. "I think if we
work hard, we could qualify (for
the NCAAs)," she says.

The team proved their mettle
on Sunday in an informal tour
nament at the Webb Ranch in Por
tola Valley where the team
practices. In an unanticipated vic
tory, Stanford beat a team from
Pebble Beach and a smaller local
team. "We didn't expect to win,"
says public relations manager
Melissa Harrington, a graduate
student in neurobiology.
Polo requires considerable ex
perience with horses before one
can learn to play, but many of
the members who had previously
worked with horses, tried the
sport for the first time at Stan
ford, according to senior Christy
Craven, horse manager for the
team.
The game revolves around the
so-called "line of the ball," which
serves to keep the play directed
towards one end of the field. The
four players are arranged in of
fensive and defensive positions,
with the aim of driving the ball
