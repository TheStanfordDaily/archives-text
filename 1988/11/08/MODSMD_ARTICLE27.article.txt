## Does anyone know where all the great centers have gone? 
### 
A train leaves Philadelphia
headed for New York City.
Going at a constant rate of
speed, without stopping, on a straight,
flat track, the train taJces 80 minutes
to arrive at its destination.
At the same exact time, a train left
New York City headed for Philadelphia.
It went at the same constant rate of
speed as Train 1, non-stop, on a parallel
track. But this train took an hour and
20 minutes to complete the journey.
Why?
If you can't figure that one out, you
certainly won't get this one.
On Saturday night, Golden State's
Ralph Sampson scored four points on
2-for-9 shooting from the field and
hauled in five rebounds in 17 foul
plagued minutes.

The Warriors won.
On the very same night, Los Angeles
Laker center Kareem Abdul-Jabaar
notched 16 points and grabbed 12
boards.
The Lakers lost. To San Antonio.
Why?

Has the center become so irrelevant
to an NBA team's success?
Two examples do not a theory make,
but a lot of teams probably hope so,
since there are so few legitimate dom
inant centers in the league, and many
of those that remain are on their way
out.
Out of the 25 NBA teams, only three
have dominant starting centers whose
careers are on the upswing: New York
(Patrick Ewing), Houston (Akeem
Okguwon) and Cleveland (Brad Daug
herty).
An asterisk goes to Dallas' Roy
Tarpley, who again started this season
behind 6-foot-11, 595-pound James
Donaldson even though for a week in
the NBA playoffs, Laker fans were

regretting not trading James Worthy
for him.
There are a handful of postmen whose
careers aren't necessarily on the
downswing, but you can decide for your
self what that's worth: Benoit Benjamin
(Los Angeles Clippers), Mike Gminski
(Philadelphia), Joe Kleine (Sacramento),
Bobby Duckworth (Portland), Danny
Schayes (Denver), Mark Eaton (Utah)
and Alton Lister (Seattle).
San Antonio's Frank Brickowski and
Indiana's Steve Stipanovich would fit
here if they weren't injured and Peter
Gudmundsson and Greg Dreiling were
starting in their places.
These guys aren't bad. They'll get
you, I suppose, 14 points and nine
rebounds per game.
Unfortunately, those are about the

stats that the following centers will
record until their rivers shortly run dry:
Chicago's Bill Cartwright, New Jersey's
Joe Barry Carroll, Detroit's Bill Laim
beer, Atlanta's Moses Malone, Boston's
Robert Pairrish, Abdul-Jabaar and
Sampson, whose career fell apart faster
than any cast member of The Brady
Bunch.
Don't get upset if I'm lumping your
favorite center with one you consider
worthless. These are just basic
categories, each of them definitely a
prime cut below the top.
So, without taxing you any further
by mentioning the remaining dregs of
the league, there are probably going to


JON WEISMAN
be no more than seven legitimate
powerful centers in the league in
1990: Ewing, Oltyuwon, Daug
herty, Tarpley, Ens. David Robin
son of the 1989-90 Spurs, maybe
Malone if he's still around and
maybe Danny Manning if he ever
gets the $10 million (or so) he
wants (I remember when Bill Wal
ton held out for Springsteen tick
ets).
Any coming out of the colleges?
Alonzo Mourning within the next
few years, maybe a couple of

others. But you can be sure that
two-thirds of the 27 NBA teams
starting the next decade will be
lacking a real force in the middle.
So, are the handful of teams
with great centers going to dom
inate the league in the next dec
ade? Or will their advantage end
up being next to nothing?
I'd bet Anna Eshoo's postage
and video bills that none of the
teams with the great centers will
ever lose more than half their
games. There will be just too
many teams that don't match up
well to keep them from posting
strings of winning seasons.

At the same time, it's still going
to take another all-around super
star to help bring home NBA
titles. Long after Magic and Bird
are gone, their legacy will remain.
So until Michael Jordan gets
traded to Cleveland, until Charles
Barkley signs with San Antonio,
until Houston drafts Sean Elliott,
until the San Diego Padres trade
Benito Santiago or Sandy Alomar
Jr., don't make any claims as to
who will be the dominant team of
the '90s.
Because you don't have to know
80 minutes from an hour and 20
minutes to see that it takes two
to tango in the NBA.
