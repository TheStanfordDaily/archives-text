# Cardinal prepares to tackle Bruins in L.A.
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
The Monday-morning quarter
backs were out in force.
Stanford football Coach Jack
Elway headed them off at the
pass, however, when he opened
his weekly press conference yes
terday with a direct statement
about the interception thrown in
the final minutes of the Cardi
nal's 24-21 loss to Washington
State Saturday.
"It doesn't really do me any
good to explain but I will anyway,"
Elway said. "It was a play-action
pass. . . . The last thing I had on
my mind was an interception.
How was it executed? Not very
well."
The ending to the latest Cardi
nal heartbreaker was not Elway's
biggest concern, though. He was
thinking ahead to the Cardinal's
meeting with UCLA this Saturday
at the Rose Bowl. Coming in at
3-5-1 overall, 1-4-1 in the Pacific
10 Conference, Stanford is facing
the sixth-ranked team in the
country. The Bruins are 8-1, 5-1
in the Pac-10.
"They were really tremendous
on defense [ against Oregon Satur
day]," Elway said. "Offensively,
they've got multiple sets and do
a lot of things. . . . They have the
ability to run the ball with power
and Troy Aikman is no ham-and
egger."
Aikman, the Bruins' quarter
back, is the leading candidate to
win the Heisman Trophy. Aikman

has completed 64 percent of his
passes for more than 2000 yards
and has thrown for 21 touch
downs.
"I watched some films of UCLA
Sunday and I think maybe 18
bottles of vodka would be better
than looking at UCLA," Elway
said.
Stanford free safety Mike New
ton is looking forward to facing
Aikman, though. "It's a good chal
lenge," he said. "He's a great
quarterback. ... We faced a great
quarterback this week [Was
hington State's Timm Rosenbach]
and we seemed to do pretty well
against him. . . . They're all stop
pable. They're all human."
To beat the Bruins, the Cardi
nal will have to be more consistent
and less giving than in the Wash
ington State game, one in which
Rosenbach repeatedly produced
the big play and Stanford turned
the ball over four times, resulting
immediately in 11 points for WSU
and the loss of 14 for the Cardinal.
Elway feels there has been no
lack of effort in all the narrow
defeats, however. "I'm saying that
they're playing . . . close to their
ability and enthusiastically," he
said. "I can't look at every little
detail and say, 'If you'd played
harder we would have won.' I
can't say that to 'em."
The Cardinal will need contin
ued enthusiasm and improvement
around the goal line to challenge
UCLA this week. Scott Eschelman
ran the ball in for a touchdown
on a first-and-goal-from-the-one

play Saturday, but the Cardinal
couldn't score at the end of the
game. Elway feels that problem
has been over-emphasized this
season, though.
"They (UCLA) were on the six
yard line and had four downs
[against Washington State] and
they didn't score," Elway said. "I
just thought I'd mention that.
Every time I see someone on TV
inside the 10 and they don't score
I say, 'See.'"
Card notes
A key for the game will be the
injury status of several key players.
For the Cardinal, fullback Jon Volpe
is suffering from bruised ribs but is
expected to play. "Volpe is hurting a
little bit," Elway said, "but he's a
good competitor."
UCLA is expected to be without the
services of Eric Ball, the Rose Bowl
MVP in 1985 as a freshman, who is
suffering from a sprained ankle. "Eric
Ball will not play this weekend against
Stanford according to the doctor's
report," UCLA Coach Terry Donahue
said. "Those reports are always sub
ject to change though."
Tight end Charles Arbuckle is also
injured and is listed on the depth
chart as a second-teamer. "Charles is
one of our better football players who
strained ligaments in his knee,"
Donahue said. "He is not yet back to
the form he had before the injury.
He is a player who has talent but is
rusty. .. . He's trying to regain that.
I wouldn't be surprised if he started
against Stanford and I wouldn't be
surprised if he didn't start."

Linebacker Jono Tunney leaps to stop Washington State running back Rich Swinton, who apparently
forgot to bring something along on his goal-line dive. The Cougars recovered the fumble.
