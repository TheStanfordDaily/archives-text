# Volleyball takes on No. 13 Pacific

Cardinal middle blockers beware — Elaina Oden
is back.
Ready to avenge an early-season loss at Stockton
and abruptly end Stanford's school-record 17-match
win streak, an Oden-bolstered University of the
Pacific women*B volleyball team will hit the Maples
Pavilion floor tonight at 7:30 in what will be a real
battle in the middle.
The Cardinal, after sweeping California on the
road last Tuesday, is currently 22-1 on the season
and remains ranked second in the nation. Bouncing
back from a disappointing beginning, the Tigers
find themselves rated 13th and the bearers of a
16-10 record after winning six of their last seven
matches.
That loss came at the hands of No. 3 Hawaii in
a four-game Big West Conference match-up last
Thursday, which marked the first time this season
that Oden has played in the front row. Recovering
from a knee injury suffered last June in the Soviet
Union while playing on the U.S. National Team,
the 1986 NCAA Player of the Year is not at 100
percent but is still a potent player.
"1 think she makes them a better team just by
the fact that she's out there playing all the way
around," Stanford Coach Don Shaw said. "She does
a lot for them, like she always has: she digs a lot
of balls when she's in the back row, she gets her
hands on a lot of balls when she's blocking in the
front row.
"Just the fact that she's back not only physically
gives them their best player, a better player than
they have anywhere else, (but) psychologically the
rest of the team is a lot more confident with her
back in there. That's really going to help them —
it's going to be a good test for us."
The Tigers will also find themselves sufficiently
tested. In Laura Olesen and Amy Cooper, Stanford
has one of the toughest middle blocking tandems
in the country and will give Oden and Cathey Scotlan
a great challenge.
Olosen, the Cardinal captain, has fared well in
the past several matches both offensively and defen
sively, playing well enough to rank sixth in blocks
in the stuff-happy Pacific 10 Conference. Also rating
highly in the Pac-10, Cooper is making a strong
run at league and national Freshman of the Year
honors with her team-leading .346 hitting percentage
and 1.3 blocks per game, good for fifth in the league.
"Our middle blockers can play with anybody,"
Stanford Asst. Coach Ruben Nieves said. "I think
they match up with anybody. They may not be as
big as everybody they play against, but in most
cases they make up for it with quickness and skill."
The teams also match up well on the outside.
The Cardinal has a strong corps of starters, most
notably Kristin Klein and Jennifer Chaffee, that
gives Stanford one of the most balanced attacks in
