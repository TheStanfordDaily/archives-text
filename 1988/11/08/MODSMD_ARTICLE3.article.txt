# House scratches problem party
## Under pressure from University, Lambda Nu votes to avoid racial issue 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
Lambda Nu House decided to cancel
a party last weekend after a University
official said the festivities may be ra
cially offensive.
The house had planned a Saturday
night "Tribal Possession" party, a
celebration of every race's tribal past,
but canceled it that afternoon during
an emergency house meeting.
Row Director Diana Conklin told The
Daily yesterday that it is a bad idea "to
use someone else's culture as a party
theme." She praised house Resident As
sistant Matt Schwartz's concern and de
cision to talk with her Friday afternoon
to determine if the party might offend
some students.
"That is not worth risking," getting
students upset, Conklin said.

House residents said they planned to
have black lights, flourescent paint ap
plied to the walls and to party-goers,
and grass skirts. They also planned to
have music from Africa, Haiti and from
a live bongo player.
The planned party comes during a
time when racism is a heavily discussed
and debated topic on campus. Recent
events here have reached the regional
and national press on several occasions.
Schwartz was unavailable for com
ment yesterday.
House members said Schwartz in
formed the house of his talk with Con
klin during the emergency house meet
ing Saturday.
Schwartz also contacted Ujamaa
House RAs for their opinion. Ujamaa
RA Rachel Wiesen said she told
Schwartz the party would be offensive
because it would make fun of another

culture.
According to some house members,
Conklin told Schwartz using body paint
and wearing grass skirts were particular
areas of concern.
Roughly half of the 52-member house
attended the meeting and decided to
cancel the party, house resident Darryl
Fen wick said. Some residents said they
were disappointed the party had to be
canceled at such a late date.
Some planners added that their in
tentions were misconstrued. "The intent
was not to offend. . . . Right now you
can't have a party with a theme. If
grass skirts are considered taboo, how
many luaus can you have?" said Linly
Ferris, referring to any number of
campus luau parties each year.
