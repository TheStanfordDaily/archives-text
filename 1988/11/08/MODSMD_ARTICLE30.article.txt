# Cardinal sailing captures second
## 
### Hugh R. Bethell Staff writer 
Though over 300 sailors from
16 schools competed in the an
nual North-South Tntersec
tional regatta this weekend,
members of the Stanford sail
ing team left with top-three
finishes in each of the event's
five divisions as the Cardinal
captured second place in the
overall competition.
The North-South regatta,
hosted this year by Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo on Lopez
Lake, is considered by most col
legiate sailors to be the main
event of the fall season. The
regatta serves to rank West
Coast teams for the spring
season, and consequently
draws the region's best sailors
together for a weekend of in
tense competition.
This year, Lopez Lake saw
the defending champions from
Stanford bow to rival UC-
Irvine, which edged out the
Cardinal to take the overall
championship. Behind Stan
ford in the top five were USC,
California, and UC-Santa Bar
bara.
Each school's overall score
was determined by the per
formance of its sailors in four
divisions, two of which were
sailed by two-person teams in
Flying Junior class sailboats,
and two of which were con
tested by singlehanded sailors
in Laser class boats.
In the A-Division, senior Bill
Shoemaker skippered the Car
dinal's first Flying Junior to
third place, sailing first with
sophomore Paula Gani and
later with sophomore Rebecca
Bryson. In B-Division, seniors
Ev Rend and Amy Baltzer also
sailed their boat to third place,
giving Stanford a second-place
overall ranking in dinghy
events.
At the same time, senior

Brad Swett continued the Car
dinal effort with another third
place finish in the
singlehanded C-Division, and
junior Robert Brown capped
the Stanford performance by
winning D-Division.
Taken together, Stanford's
four strong divisional results
amounted to a performance un
matched by any school other
than Irvine, which showed
similar consistency but slightly
better average finishes in cap
turing the overall victory.
While many of the teams
focused on the four scoring
divisions, by far the biggest
fleet at the regatta was in the
junior varsity division, where
Stanford fielded five four
person teams to compete in
Flying Juniors.
In testimony to the depth of
talent on the Cardinal squad,
those five teams all finished in
the upper-half of the final
standings, with sophomores
Dave Dowd, Scott Dale, and
Brett Adams standing out.
Teaming up with freshman
Lydia Snape and junior Sue
Kown, Dowd and Dale took
first place in JV, edging out
Irvine by the slimmest of mar
gins. Adams and junior
Kathryn Haggitt ended up
fourth, together with freshman
â€¢ Peter Somers and sophomore
Sarah Gannett, but along the
way recorded a number of con
vincing wins in individual
races.
Stanford's women's team
had an especially good regatta
as well, as junior Kim Groae
recorded her first
win and freshman Cathy Pet
zold repeatedly challenged
Dowd and Dale for the lead.
"We did well in every divi
sion," said Stanford Coach
Blake Middleton. "From our
seniors to our freshmen, every
one sailed at the height of their
ability."
