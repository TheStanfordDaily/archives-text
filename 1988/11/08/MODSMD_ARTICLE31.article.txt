# Graham takes Rolex tourney
## 
### 
Stanford freshman Debbie
Graham captured the Rolex Re
gional Championship singles title
on Sunday, downing teammate
Teri Whitlinger in straight sets,
7-5, 6-0.
The win gave Graham an au
tomatic berth in the Rolex Indoor
Championships, which will be
held in Minnesota in February.
To reach the finals, Whitlinger
disposed of California's Jean
Marie Lazzano, while Graham
defeated Karen Shin, also from
Cal, who played the No. 1 spot
for the Bears last season.
"She [Graham] is a real blue
chip, one of the top recruits in
the nation," Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan said. "She's got a
great all-around game, and she's
very poised. She's certainly capa
ble of playing at any position for
us and winning."
Just what position Graham will
be playing once the season begins
in early February is not certain,
however. "We've got so many good
players, it's hard for me to say
just what the lineup will be,"
Brennan said of his three-time
defending NCAA champions. "It's
still tso early."
