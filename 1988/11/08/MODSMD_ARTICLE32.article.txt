LAS VEGAS (AP) - Sugar
Ray Leonard got up from a
fourth-round knockdown to
knock out Donny Lalonde in
the ninth round and write
boxing history Monday night,
becoming the first fighter to
win titles in five weight classes.
The sensational victory gave
Leonard the World Boxing
Council light heavyweight title
held by Lalonde and also the
vacant WBC super mid
dleweight title.
After Lalonde went down for
the second time in the ninth
round, referee Richard Steele
didn't even bother to count, but
rushed to Lalonde's aid as
Leonard threw his arms high
in triumph.
Lalonde seemed to have
Leonard in trouble earlier in
the ninth when a flurry of
punches backed Leonard up.
But Leonard fought back and
suddenly nailed Lalonde with
a right hand and followed with
a flurry of punches that put
the defending champion down.
Lalonde struggled up at two
and took a mandatory 8-count.
Then Leonard resumed the at
tack and smashed the
Canadian to the floor, where

he remained for several
seconds. He would not have
beaten a 10-count. The time
was 2:30 of the ninth.
Leonard, 32, went down at
1:27 of the fourth round from
a left-right to the head, with
the right being the big punch.
Leonard got up at two and took
a mandatory 8-count. Lalonde
landed several more head shots
but Leonard escaped further
damage.
Leonard's previous champi
onships were the undisputed
welterweight title, the World
Boxing Association junior mid
dleweight title and the WBC
middleweight title.
"The Leonard of 1981 (when
he beat Thomas Hearns) was
someone to be in awe of,"
Lalonde had said before the
fight. "He was a great fighter
then; time takes its toll."
There were indications Mon
day night that time might be
catching up with Leonard.
"I knew the guy could fight,"
Leonard said of Lalonde. "Hell,
he fought like a champion."
"He's a hell of a fighter,"
Lalonde said. "He was a better
man tonight."
