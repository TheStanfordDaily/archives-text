# How will TV affect election?

Television has influenced the
American public with a contin
uum of mudslinging political
advertisements, uncharismatic
debates and presidential polls dur
ing the 1988 campaign. Today sig
nals the television medium's final
impact on voters: coverage of elec
tion results.
Among Stanford professors who
specialize in American politics and
communications, opinion varies
on how television coverage affects
voter decisions and turnout.
Political science Prof. Richard
Brody, an expert on how the media
affects elections, said non-media
factors are more influential than
most people realize. Transporta
tion availability and registration
drive effectiveness, for example,
affect voter turnout more than
television polls or bland press
portrayals of Dukakis and Bush,
Brody noted.
Early network poll predictions
that favor a particular candidate
should not hurt either party,
Brody said. "The effect should be
uniform across parties — both
have an incentive to stay at
home." For instance, if early
results predict a landslide for one
candidate, both Republicans and
Democrats sitting at home are just
as likely to stay there and figure

that their vote won't make a dif
ference.
However, Brody said these
voters will have an impact in the
local congressional race. Brody
said, "The (12th district between
Anna) Eshoo and (Tom) Campbell
campaign looks like it could be
quite close. It's the most interest
ing congressional race we've had
around here in a long time."
Communications Prof. Byron
Reeves agreed with Brody's eval
uation concerning the smaller
races.
"The most important effect is
that on the lesser races and is
sues," Reeves said, noting that
many candidates in the past have
been elected by the difference of
a few hundred votes. Early tele
vision predictions today could con
vince those few hundred to skip
the voting booth, and change the
results.
Yet unlike Brody, Reeves
believes that even a presidential
race can be swayed by such a small
percentage of voters influenced by
the media. But Reeves did note
that such an effect on today's race
is less likely because George Bush
has such a significant lead in most
polls.
Over the course of the 1988
campaign, the media has been ac
cused of dirtying an already too

muddy race, and turning the
public's focus away from the real
issues by stressing overblown can
didate character flaws. But Polit
ical Science Prof. David Brady said
the problem might not rest with
the media.
"That is the tradition of polit
ical parties to avoid issues. Can
didates desire to put out a good
image of themselves and a bad
image of the other. And now, in
an era which the political arena
is much weaker than in the past,
television allows candidates to di
rectly communicate with every
one on a personal level," he said.
The results of such direct com
munication are biting, distorting
political advertisements and cheap
name-calling — the infamous 'L
word\ for instance.
Communications Prof. Steven
Chaffee does not blame this dis
tortion on the television medium
itself, but rather on the candi
dates. "Political advertising has
none of the professional ethics or
constraints of journalism, so it's
not surprising that the ads are
full of garbage," he said.
American Studies and History
Prof. Jack Rakove pointed out
that mudslinging is nothing new
in the American political scene.
"It's probably a cleaner election
than 1800," he commented.
