With the big day finally at hand,
both the Stanford Democrats and
the Stanford College Republicans
plan to use phone banks as a last
minute measure to press their
respective supporters to vote.
The Democrats will engage
about 200 volunteers to go out
and make sure registered Demo
crats vote, according to Steve
Piche, precinct organizer for the
group. "We're doing a massive
grass roots get-out-the-vote effort

here at Stanford," Piche said at
a meeting last night.
The Democrats have researched
a list of 8,000 people through
voter registration records that
they are targeting for this drive.
Of supporters who haven't voted,
Piche said, "We'll drag them out
of the library." Despite late polls
showing Bush ahead, Piche said,
"We're going to win. Polls don't
vote, people do."
The Republicans will center
their efforts not on campus, but

in Palo Alto where there are more
Republicans, according to Jenni
fer Bryson, chair of the College
Republicans. After a morning ex
cursion with 12th district con
gressional candidate Tom Camp
bell to the polls, the Republicans
will man a phone bank to remind
their supporters of the impor
tance of their vote, Bryson said.
They also plan an escort service
to help elderly voters get to the
polls. As far as predictions,
Bryson would only say, "We still
have a lot of work to do."
