# Groups with same name create confusion over campaign fliers
## 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
A dubious campaign organization has
wreaked havoc on the 12th district con
gressional race and left the official Vic
tory '88 organization outraged, a repre
sentative from the group said yesterday.
John Kurzweil, a press representative
for Victory '88 — a Republican group —
denounced the organization that
produced a slate mailer with a Democratic
symbol, the name "Victory *88" and an
endorsement for Republican congres
sional candidate Tom Campbell.
The group, which was unaffiliated with

the official Victory '88, nevertheless used
that name to print and deliver last
minute fliers that endorsed Campbell
along with Democratic candidates Mi
chael Dukakis, senatorial candidate Leo
McCarthy and others. In addition, the
mailer endorsed several ballot initiative
propositions.
Kurzweil said his group has no con
nections with the creation or distribution
of the flier. He added that Victory '88
has not even taken a stand on many of
the ballot initiatives.
Calling the flier "outrageous and
reprehensible," Kurzweil said it was an
example of "this last minute stuff un-

scrupulous people do to
pervert the issues."
Another representative
from Victory '88 added
that Victory '88 might
sue the other group for
using their name, al
though he is unsure
whether the dubious or
ganization's action was
illegal. At any rate, it is

a misleading representation, Kurzweil
added.
Explaining the endorsement, Campbell
has said that the Los Angeles group ap
proached him with the idea for the mailer.

Appreciating the sup
port, Campbell contrib
uted $5,000 to the pro
duction of the slate
mailers — about 25 per
cent of total production
costs, one Campbell cam
paign member said.
Lewis Bonsignore,
press secretary for
Campbell, said Campbell

did not know and is currently unaware
of the official group's outrage to the flier.
However, Campbell did know that there
are two Victory '88 groups, Bonsignore
added.

It is unclear, however, whether Camp
bell was aware of the fact that the group
that approached him was not the official
Victory '88.
According to Kurzweil the first, official
Victory '88 group is composed of Repub
lican members whose ultimate goal is to
help Republican candidates win elections.
They are responsible for registering Re
publicans and encouraging people to vote.
The group responsible for the slate
mailer that endorsed Campbell is an or
ganization formed by Democrats,
Kurzweil said. It's address is on Sunset
Blvd. in Los Angeles and is fraudulent,
Kurzweil said.
