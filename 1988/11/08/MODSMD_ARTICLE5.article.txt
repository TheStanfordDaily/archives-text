# Election-eve panel questions candidates' focus on issues
## 
### John Wagner Staff writer 
Asserting that both national parties have
put forth "intelligent candidates" who have
clearly defined their positions, Senior Hoo
ver Fellow Martin Anderson was the dis
senting voice in a five-person election eve
panel discussion last night.
Anderson defended his belief that this
year's race addressed substantial issues to
a crowd of about 50 people who attended
the program at Bechtel International Cen
ter. Four other experts on international
politics spoke at the program as well.
Panelist Gordon Earle, a senior producer
of the MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour, disagreed
with Anderson and voiced disgust that in

ternational issues were not discussed in
more detail. He cited a recent stump speech
by Michael Dukakis during which the only
two international references were to Pan
amanian General Manuel Noriega and the
Iran-Contra affair.
Because the candidates reflect distinct
ideologies, this election is extremely impor
tant to the other nations of the world,
which look to the United States as an ide
ological "model," Anderson explained.
Citing current reforms in China and the
Soviet Union, Anderson said "ideological
changes" are taking place "throughout the
world." The results of this election will
indicate whether the United States will
continue its international commit
ments to decentralization of gov
ernment and greater freedom of
citizens, he said.
Samuel Amarel, a visiting his
tory professor from the Univer
sity of La Plata, Argentina,
sharply disagreed with Anderson.
"The common ground of both can
didates is much more important
than their differences," he said.
Regardless of who is elected,
Amarel said, the new president
will have to deal with the prob
lems created in Latin America by
U.S. debt, the supply of drugs
flowing into the United States and
the developing nuclear technolo
gies of Third World countries.
Amarel said Argentina is within
six months of nuclear weapon ca
pabilities.
Senior Hoover Fellow Henry

Rowen agreed with Amarel,
downplaying the effect of the pres
idential election on international
policy. Though the next four years
will be very important, Congress
and the fiscal deficit will act as
"impressive constraints" on either
George Bush or Dukakis, Rowen
said.
"It doesn't matter who's presi
dent," he said. "There just isn't
any money."
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy predicted Bush will
win the election and agreed the
new president will be tightly
bound by congressional restraints.
Many congressmen are skeptical
about Bush's role in the Iran-
Contra affair, which might fur
ther restrict his policy initiatives,
he said.
Anderson also defended the
"mudslinging" that other
panelists felt had dominated the
race. "Politics is a contact sport,"
he said. "It ain't a beanbag."
