# Duke bids for votes in the City
## 
### Brad Hayward Staff writer 
SAN FRANCISCO - An up
beat Michael Dukakis said yester
day that he could "smell victory
in the air" and told a packed
crowd here to "give it everything
you have . . . and tomorrow night
we'll be celebrating together."
About 40,000 people attended
the noontime rally at Embar
cadero Center, according to the
Dukakis/Bentsen campaign. About
25 Stanford students attended the
rally in a special receiving section,
said Katherine Van Uum, co-chair
of Stanford Democrats.
Subodh Chandra, the other co
chair of Stanford Democrats, was
sceheduled to stand behind Du
kakis at the rally but was unable
to get through the crowd. Cam
paign organizers asked Chandra
to attend the rally as a represen
tative of Dukakis organizers on
the college level.
Chandra called the rally "a
really moving affair" and said, "It
really hit home on why I am in
this. It wasn't a lot of flash, it
was really straightforward. It tied
a lot of loose ends together for
me."
In his 15-minute speech, the
Massachusetts governor took ad*
vantage of the opportunity to get
in some last-minute jabs at
George Bush and vice presidential
running mate Dan Quayle.
"George Bush said that he

might have given Dan Quayle the
chance to manage the most
serious foreign policy crisis we've
had — the Cuban missile crisis,"
Dukakis said. "Dan Quayle is not
a crisis manager, he is a crisis
waiting to be made."
Meanwhile, the Republican
ticket also made the rounds in
California. Gunning for the
state's 47 electoral votes, Bush
and President Ronald Reagan
campaigned in Southern Califor
nia.
The theme of Dukakis' speech
followed his recent advertising
slogan, "We're on your side," and
the speech included many of the
same lines Dukakis used in
speeches in Colorado and Oregon
Sunday.
"If you believe in equal rights
and civil rights, if you believe we
need an attorney general who will
inspire us and not embarrass us,
if you believe we need a Justice
Department that understands
what justice means, then we're
on your side," Dukakis said.
Dukakis was introduced by his
wife, Kitty Dukakis, who called
him her "passionate partner of
25 years."
California Sen. Alan Cranston
addressed the crowd before Du
kakis and said that Bush has
waged a campaign of "deceit and
distortion." Dukakis followed up
on this charge with an attack of
his own.
"Four days ago he (Bush) came
up with the biggest distortion of
all. He said he was on the side
of the working people," Dukakis
said. "The only original idea he
has had in this campaign is to
give a $30,000 tax break to the
richest 1 percent in this country."

Dukakis also charged the Re
publicans with ignoring issues
from women's rights and educa
tion to health insurance and
drugs.
"I challenge all Americans to
join with me to make drug-free
schools in this country our goal
in the 19905," he said. "I'll be
damned if I'm going to let them
(drug kingpins) send that stuff
into this country, destroy our kids
and destroy our families."
Sophomore Pam Briskman at
tended the rally with the Stanford
Democrats. "I didn't think ... he
was trying to prove anything,"
Briskman said. "It was more of
a 'bring out the vote' message. It
was too late to really bring out a

lot of the issues."
Nikki Barrett, another sopho
more, said the rally was bigger
and more emotional than she ex
pected.
The Democratic candidate re
peatedly encouraged the crowd
not to lose hope of winning the
election. "It won't be the pollsters
and pundits who make that deci
sion tomorrow," he said.
The crowd at the rally was gen
erally peaceful, though a couple
of minor scuffles broke out.
In addition to Cranston, San
Francisco Mayor Art Agnos,
Democratic senate candidate Leo
McCarthy and members of Cali
fornia's congressional delegation
spoke at the rally.

SAN FRANCISCO - An up
beat Michael Dukakis said yester
day that he could "smell victory
in the air" and told a packed
crowd here to "give it everything
you have . . . and tomorrow night
we'll be celebrating together."
About 40,000 people attended
the noontime rally at Embar
cadero Center, according to the
Dukakis/Bentsen campaign. About
25 Stanford students attended the
rally in a special receiving section,
said Katherine Van Uum, co-chair
of Stanford Democrats.
Subodh Chandra, the other co
chair of Stanford Democrats, was
sceheduled to stand behind Du
kakis at the rally but was unable
to get through the crowd. Cam
paign organizers asked Chandra
to attend the rally as a represen
tative of Dukakis organizers on
the college level.
Chandra called the rally "a
really moving affair" and said, "It
really hit home on why I am in
this. It wasn't a lot of flash, it
was really straightforward. It tied
a lot of loose ends together for
me."
In his 15-minute speech, the
Massachusetts governor took ad*
vantage of the opportunity to get
in some last-minute jabs at
George Bush and vice presidential
running mate Dan Quayle.
"George Bush said that he

might have given Dan Quayle the
chance to manage the most
serious foreign policy crisis we've
had — the Cuban missile crisis,"
Dukakis said. "Dan Quayle is not
a crisis manager, he is a crisis
waiting to be made."
Meanwhile, the Republican
ticket also made the rounds in
California. Gunning for the
state's 47 electoral votes, Bush
and President Ronald Reagan
campaigned in Southern Califor
nia.
The theme of Dukakis' speech
followed his recent advertising
slogan, "We're on your side," and
the speech included many of the
same lines Dukakis used in
speeches in Colorado and Oregon
Sunday.
"If you believe in equal rights
and civil rights, if you believe we
need an attorney general who will
inspire us and not embarrass us,
if you believe we need a Justice
Department that understands
what justice means, then we're
on your side," Dukakis said.
Dukakis was introduced by his
wife, Kitty Dukakis, who called
him her "passionate partner of
25 years."
California Sen. Alan Cranston
addressed the crowd before Du
kakis and said that Bush has
waged a campaign of "deceit and
distortion." Dukakis followed up
on this charge with an attack of
his own.
"Four days ago he (Bush) came
up with the biggest distortion of
all. He said he was on the side
of the working people," Dukakis
said. "The only original idea he
has had in this campaign is to
give a $30,000 tax break to the
richest 1 percent in this country."

Dukakis also charged the Re
publicans with ignoring issues
from women's rights and educa
tion to health insurance and
drugs.
"I challenge all Americans to
join with me to make drug-free
schools in this country our goal
in the 19905," he said. "I'll be
damned if I'm going to let them
(drug kingpins) send that stuff
into this country, destroy our kids
and destroy our families."
Sophomore Pam Briskman at
tended the rally with the Stanford
Democrats. "I didn't think ... he
was trying to prove anything,"
Briskman said. "It was more of
a 'bring out the vote' message. It
was too late to really bring out a

lot of the issues."
Nikki Barrett, another sopho
more, said the rally was bigger
and more emotional than she ex
pected.
The Democratic candidate re
peatedly encouraged the crowd
not to lose hope of winning the
election. "It won't be the pollsters
and pundits who make that deci
sion tomorrow," he said.
The crowd at the rally was gen
erally peaceful, though a couple
of minor scuffles broke out.
In addition to Cranston, San
Francisco Mayor Art Agnos,
Democratic senate candidate Leo
McCarthy and members of Cali
fornia's congressional delegation
spoke at the rally.
