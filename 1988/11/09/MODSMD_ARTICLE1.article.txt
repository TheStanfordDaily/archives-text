Despite riding the crest of a
strong economy to victory,
President-elect George Bush will
probably not be as successful as
his predecessor at getting legisla
tion passed, according to Stanford
professors and officials at Hoover
interviewed by The Daily last
night.
In addition, some believed that,
despite a substantial Bush victory,
the Democrats have a number of
things to feel positive about as
they look to 1992.
W. Glenn Campbell, director of
the Hoover Institution, said "I
think it was a magnificent victory
for peace and prosperity and
preparedness."
Campbell pointed out that he
was speaking for himself and not

To hardly anyone's surprise,
George Bush scored big wins in
nearly every region of the country
and was elected the 41st President
of the United States last night.
Despite another four-year hold
on the presidency, however, Re
publicans will continue to share
power with a Congress firmly con
trolled by the Democrats.
The president-elect was ebul
lient in becoming the first sitting
vice president since Martin van
Buren in 1836 to capture the
presidency. "The people have
spoken," Bush said. "With a full
heart and great hopes I thank all
the people throughout America
who have given us this great vic
tory."
"I mean to be a president of all
the people," Bush added as he
received the verdict in his adopted
hometown of Houston. He said he
wants an "America that is strong
and resolute in the world, strong

and big-hearted at home. And
when I said I wanted a kinder
gentler nation, I meant it and I
mean it."
Asked when he would get down
to the work of forming a govern
ment, he replied, "Tomorrow."
As of 1:45 a.m., Bush was win
ning the popular vote by 54 per
cent to 46 percent for Michael Du
kakis, and he led by miles in the
Electoral College. Many voters
registered their disappointment
with the campaign by abstaining.
Initial estimates said turnout was
scarcely above 50 percent, close
to a 40-year low.
The results fell in the middle
of the wide spectrum of pre
election polls that had the vice
president leading between five and
11 points.
It was a strong, but singular
triumph for the 64-year-old vice
president, with the new Congress
in a tightened Democratic grip.
Ninety-nine percent of the House
incumbents were being returned
