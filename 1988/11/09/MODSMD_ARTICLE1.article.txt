Despite riding the crest of a
strong economy to victory,
President-elect George Bush will
probably not be as successful as
his predecessor at getting legisla
tion passed, according to Stanford
professors and officials at Hoover
interviewed by The Daily last
night.
In addition, some believed that,
despite a substantial Bush victory,
the Democrats have a number of
things to feel positive about as
they look to 1992.
W. Glenn Campbell, director of
the Hoover Institution, said "I
think it was a magnificent victory
for peace and prosperity and
preparedness."
Campbell pointed out that he
was speaking for himself and not

To hardly anyone's surprise,
George Bush scored big wins in
nearly every region of the country
and was elected the 41st President
of the United States last night.
Despite another four-year hold
on the presidency, however, Re
publicans will continue to share
power with a Congress firmly con
trolled by the Democrats.
The president-elect was ebul
lient in becoming the first sitting
vice president since Martin van
Buren in 1836 to capture the
presidency. "The people have
spoken," Bush said. "With a full
heart and great hopes I thank all
the people throughout America
who have given us this great vic
tory."
"I mean to be a president of all
the people," Bush added as he
received the verdict in his adopted
hometown of Houston. He said he
wants an "America that is strong
and resolute in the world, strong

and big-hearted at home. And
when I said I wanted a kinder
gentler nation, I meant it and I
mean it."
Asked when he would get down
to the work of forming a govern
ment, he replied, "Tomorrow."
As of 1:45 a.m., Bush was win
ning the popular vote by 54 per
cent to 46 percent for Michael Du
kakis, and he led by miles in the
Electoral College. Many voters
registered their disappointment
with the campaign by abstaining.
Initial estimates said turnout was
scarcely above 50 percent, close
to a 40-year low.
The results fell in the middle
of the wide spectrum of pre
election polls that had the vice
president leading between five and
11 points.
It was a strong, but singular
triumph for the 64-year-old vice
president, with the new Congress
in a tightened Democratic grip.
Ninety-nine percent of the House
incumbents were being returned

for Hoover.
Emeritus Political Science Prof.
Hubert Marshall said Bush ben
efited from the current status of
the "misery index" — a combina
tion of unemployment and infla
tion.
"The best prediction of (presi
dential) elections is the misery in
dex," Marshall said.
Unemployment is at a 14-year
low and, despite an increase this
year, inflation has been in check
for nearly five years. That com
bination makes the index half of
what it was when Reagan took
office in 1980.
George Marotta, a senior fellow
at Hoover, also cited the impor

tance of the misery index in de
termining the Bush victory.
Nonetheless, Bush may have
difficulty as he takes over the
presidency from Reagan.
"[Though] Bush has inherited
the Reagan mantle ... he doesn't
have the personal popularity that
Reagan has had," Marshall said.
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody noted that with the Dem
ocrats picking up a Senate seat
or two as well as maintaining their
wide majority in the House of
Representatives, Bush will face a
Congress that is much more
Democratic than the one Reagan
came in with.
When Reagan took office, he
brought with him Republican con
trol of the Senate and a couple of
dozen seats in the House, Brody
said.
Brody said Bush will have to

"consult in advance" with Demo
crats if he intends to push for
legislation.
Marshall added that since
"American parties are not polar
opposites . .. Bush will not have
trouble governing. He's just not
going to get his way."
However, Marshall said, despite
Reagan's early legislative success,
in the past two or three years
Congress has not served as a rub
ber stamp to Reagan. Marshall
cited the cut off of lethal aid to
the Contras and reduced military
spending as examples of this.
Marshall suggested Bush would
have "even more trouble" than
Reagan has had of late.
Marotta was somewhat more
optimistic. He said Bush could
"heal all the wounds of the cam
paign" fairly quickly. But he also
noted there would be "much less

of a honeymoon period" for Bush.
The honeymoon period is typi
cal of the early days of a new
administration where a president
can make "radical change,"
Marotta said.
Despite losing their fifth pres
idential election out of the last
six, Democrats can point to a
number of hopeful signs in the
'88 campaign, according to the ex
perts.
From the days of Franklin D.
Roosevelt continuing through the
campaign of Walter Mondale, the
Democratic candidates have been
viewed as "the spokesman for a
series of special interests," includ
ing organized labor, blacks,
women and the poor, Marshall
noted.
Despite Bush's efforts to paint
Dukakis as a liberal, Bush did not
attempt to make Dukakis out as

a pawn of special interests.
"That's better for the nation and
better for the Democratic party,"
Marshall said.
Brody also listed a number of
positives for the Democrats: They
continued to do well in Congress,
"picked up a couple of good gover
norships" and should be able to
hold that ground after redistrict
ing in 1990.
Every 10 years, states redraw
the lines for electing representa
tives to Congress and their respec
tive statehouses. The party in con
trol of the state legislature at that
time is usually able to draw the
lines to help maintain their
majority or even increase it.
But Campbell noted that the
Bush win would have strong
benefits to the Republicans. "[lt]
effectively means, in my opinion,

that the Supreme Court will be
sensible well into the 21st century.
"The stamp of Ronald Reagan
is on this country," he added.

to office.
Unlike 1980, where Reagan's
victory helped sweep a number of
Republicans into the House and
Senate, Bush's coattails appeared
to be quite short.
Democrats appeared to be pad
ding their old 54-seat majority in
the Senate and had unquestioned
command of the House that will
greet the new Republican presi
dent. In recognition of this
strength, Bush said, "I'll do my
level best to reach out and work
constructively with the United
States Congress."
Dukakis offered Bush his con
cession first in a private telephone
call, then later at a nationally
televised rally with supporters in
Boston. "This nation faces mtyor
challenges and we must work to
gether," ne said in words that
echoed Bush's own remarks.
President Reagan telephoned
his congratulations to Bush and
Vice President-elect Dan Quayle

and promised a smooth transition.
Bush, full of praise for his van
quished rival, planned a morning
news conference Wednesday and
then a triumphant return to
Washington.
Dukakis now settles back in as
governor of Massachusetts,
deflated without a doubt after the
long, costly and nasty campaign.
After a rollicking 48-hour blitz,
he made one final round of tele
vision interviews well after the
first votes were being counted.
In the popular vote, with 92
percent of the precincts reporting,
Bush had 43,701,467 or 54 per
cent. Dukakis had 37,198,912 or
46 percent for Dukakis.
In the Electoral College, Bush
won 38 states for 355 electoral
votes and led in Illinois and Cal
ifornia for 71 more. Dukakis won
10 states and the District of Co
lumbia for 112 electoral votes.
Bush broke the "van Buren
jinx" in style, winning Quayle's
Indiana to get off to a running
start, then blazing uncontested
across Dixie. He won Ohio, Mich
igan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania

and Texas — key states which
had been crucial to Dukakis' hopes
for a "November surprise," and
rolled up big margins in the Rocky
Mountain states.
Dukakis won at home in Mas
sachusetts as well as New York
and Rhode Island, and even tradi
tionally Republican lowa.
Victory for Bush came shortly
after 8 p.m. PST according to
tabulations done by the net
works and news services.
Election day interviews with
voters indicated that Bush was
winning 80 percent of the votes
of those who thought they were
better off after the Reagan years
than before he took office. Duka
kis was gaining eight of 10 votes
of those who felt they were not.
Bush held a narrow margin
among those who were not sure.
ABC said Bush-Quayle were
winning 17 percent of the Demo
cratic vote and 54 percent of the
independents.
Quayle had the last laugh after
listening to Democratic jokes
made at his expense, and even
hearing some Republican say he

wasn't seasoned enough for the
vice presidency. "All I can say is,
you did it, we did it and George
Bush did it,"the 41-year-old
senator told supporters in Wash
ington.
Democratic vice presidential
candidate Lloyd Bentsen had his
Senate seat to go home to. He
won handily.
Republican Senate Leader Bob
Dole said it was "probably cor
rect" that there wouldn't be a
mandate to go along with Bush's
victory. •
That wasn't the Reagan view.
In a statement, he said of Bush
and Quayle: "Their mandate will
continue the changes that create
jobs, prosperity and peace for all
Americans."
"This has been a long and
vigorous campaign," he noted.
"Governor Dukakis and Senator
Bentsen represented their party
with strength and tenacity. Now
we must pull together and help
the Vice President lead America
into the 19905. I look forward to
working with George and his team
on a smooth transition."
