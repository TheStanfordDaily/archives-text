## Democrats hold Senate 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Dem
ocrats tightened their grip on the
Senate yesterday as they knocked
off maverick Republican Sen.
Lowell Weicker and engineered
wins by two former governors in
GOP territory.
Democrats appeared headed for
a one- or two-seat gain in their
54-46 Senate majority, but several
Western races remained too close
to call and the GOP remained
within reach of offsetting some of
the Democratic gains.
In Florida, Democratic Rep.
Buddy MacKay was locked in a
see-saw battle with conservative
Republican Rep. Connie Mack
over the seat of retiring Demo
cratic Sen. Lawton Chiles.
Freshman GOP incumbent Chic
Hecht of Nevada, criticized for
having allowed his state to become
the leading candidate for a nu
clear waste dump site, was dead
locked with Democratic Gov. Rich
ard Bryan.
And in the fight for Washington
state's open seat, former GOP
Sen. Slade Gorton was attempting
a comeback and was in a virtual
tie with Rep. Mike Lowry, a liberal
Democrat, with half of the vote
counted.
Wyoming's Malcolm Wallop was

threatened by state Sen. John
Vinich, a populist Democrat who
accused the incumbent of being
out of touch with problems in the
state's economy.
Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, the
Republican minority leader,
conceded his party's numbers in
the Senate would be trimmed in
the 101st Congress that convenes
next year. "It's going to be tough
er," he said.
Dole, who lost to George Bush
in the party's presidential prima
ries, also criticized the GOP win
ner. "We could have used a little
help from the vice president in
some of the states like Florida,"
he said. "I don't think there were
any coattails in this race."
Weicker, whose career has been
built on support from an unusual
coalition of Republicans and
moderate Democrats, lost to a
vigorous attack by state Attorney
General Joseph Lieberman.
Lieberman accused the incum
bent of hattng neglected the state
to pursue his own philosophical
agenda and portrayed him in car
toon TV spots as a sleeping bear
who had missed important votes.
Weicker refused to concede
defeat. "No matter how all this
turns out, I don't have a single

gripe," he told supporters in
Newington. At times choked with
emotion, he said he would con
tinue to fight for causes he
believes in "either as a senator or
a citizen."
Former Virginia Gov. Charles
Robb easily defeated black GOP
candidate Maurice Dawkins to
take the seat of retiring Republi
can Paul Trible in Virginia. In
Nebraska, appointed GOP Sen.
David Karnes was defeated by
former Gov. Robert Kerrey, a
Vietnam veteran and Medal of
Honor winner who made national
news while governor for his
romance with movie star Debra
Winger.
In New Jersey, Democratic in
cumbent Frank Lautenberg held
off a strong challenge from Re
publican Pete Dawkins, defeating
the former Rhodes scholar, Army
general and football star in the
nation's most viciously fought
Senate campaign.
And 80-year-old Sen. Quentin
Burdick, D-N.D., who underwent
surgery in August for colon can
cer, beat back a challenge from
state House Republican leader
Earl Strinden, who had raised the
issue of Burdick's age and health
during the campaign.
