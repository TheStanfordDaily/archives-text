# Democrats renew majority in House of Representatives
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Dem
ocrats rode a tidal wave of incum
bent victories to renewed control
of the House of Representatives
yesterday as voters turned out a
Democratic chairman dogged by
ethical controversy and a two
term Republican under indict
ment.
By early morning, 98 percent
of incumbents were re-elected or
leading, which would match the
record set in 1986. A total of 351
incumbents had won and 44 were
leading. Fewer than a half-dozen
incumbents were trailing their
challengers.
Rep. Fernand St. Germain, D-

R. 1., chairman of the House
Banking Committee, was buried
in his bid for a 15th term by
political novice Ronald Machtley,
a lawyer. St. Germain, who trailed
45-55 with 92 percent of the vote
counted, was the first committee
chairman to lose since 1980, when
Oregon voters turned out House
Ways and Means Chairman A 1 Ull
man.
Justice Department documents
unsealed late last month said a
department investigation had un
covered "substantial evidence of
serious and sustained miscon
duct" in St. Germain's dealings
with financial industry lobbyists.

The department's criminal divi
sion declined to prosecute but
referred its findings last May to
the House ethics committee,
which has not said how it is han
dling the matter.
In Georgia, former actor Ben
Jones, a Democrat, defeated two
term Republican Rep. Pat Swin
dall in a bitter rematch in their
suburban Atlanta district. Jones,
a recovered alcoholic, played
"Cooter" on the TV series "Dukes
of Hazzard." Swindall is fighting
perjury charges stemming from a
drug money laundering probe.
With half the vote counted, Jones
led 59-41 percent.

Two years ago, the Democrats
won a 257-178 majority in the
House. This year, just 27 districts
had no incumbent running — 12
of them held by Democrats and
15 by Republicans during the past
Congress.
Democrats picked up one open
seat previously held by a Repub
lican. In Nebraska, Democrat
Peter Hoagland, a former state
senator, defeated Republican
Jerry Schenken, a pathologist, in
the Omaha district formerly rep
resented by Hal Daub.
By early morning, the Demo
crats had won 223 seats and were
leading for another 32. The Re

publicans had won 147 and led
for 27. That trend pointed to a
Democratic pickup of two seats.
Ethical problems colored a
number of House races.
Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md., whose
administrative assistant commit
ted suicide this year after revela
tions about his treatment of male
staff aides, was neck-and-neck
with Republican Wayne Gilchrest.
Dyson was also scrutinized in con
nection with a probe of Pentagon
procurement fraud but has denied
any wrongoing. With 95 percent
of the vote counted, more than
165,000 votes, Dyson trailed by
about 100 votes.

Rep. Bill Chappell, D-Fla., an
other member whose name came
up in connection with the ongoing
Pentagon investigation, was also
locked in a close race. Chappell
has denied any wrongdoing and
no charges have been filed.
But Rep. Harold Ford, D-Tenn.,
coasted to an easy victory in
Memphis despite having been in
dicted last year for bank fraud,
mail fraud and conspiracy. He is
awaiting trial.
The last time a party that won
the White House lost seats was
in 1960, when John F. Kennedy
bccame president and the Demo
crats lost 20 seats.
