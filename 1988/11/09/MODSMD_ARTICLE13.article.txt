Clash claims three Palestinians
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Israel's surrogate
militia killed three Palestinian guerrillas yester
day in south Lebanon and pro-Syrian leftists said
they expect Israeli retaliation for an attempt to
assassinate the militia's commander.
Police said the dead guerrillas were members
of the Fatah-Revolutionary Council led by ter
rorist Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabry al-
Banna.
They were trying to infiltrate west of Jezzine,
a Christian mountain town controlled by the
South Lebanon Army, a predominantly Christian
force of 2,000 men led by Maj. Gen. Antoine
Lahd, a 61-year-old former Lebanese army officer.
3 arrested in Haitian leader's death
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Police said
yesterday they have arrested the ex-wife, maid
and gardener of Jean-Claude Paul, the former

army colonel who died over the weekend after
eating a bowl of soup.
Col. Georges Valcin, the Port-au-Prince police
chief, said the three suspects would be held for
questioning until the circumstances of Paul's
death were clarified. No charges had been lodged
as of late yesterday.
Paul, a 29-year army veteran who until his
forced retirement in September was one of Haiti's
most powerful commanders, died Sunday at his
surburban Fermathe home. Paul had been under
indictment in the United States on drug charges.
Initial reports said Paul, 49, died of a heart
attack, but a family friend speculated he was
poisoned.
Radio Metropole, an independent station, re
ported yesterday that the leftover soup was sent
to a Miami laboratory for analysis. It did not
say which laboratory.
Paul's brother, Antonio, an auto mechanic, said
in an interview yesterday with independent Radio
Metropole that his brother died one hour after
eating a bowl of soup for lunch.
