### 
ABILENE, Texas (AP) — A B-l
bomber, the Air Force's most ad
vanced strategic aircraft, crashed
yesterday and all four crew mem
bers ejected safely, one man get
ting out seconds before impact,
officials said.
The crash was the third since
the B-l began flying three years
ago as the nation's first new long
range bomber in more than 25
years.
The crew members "were taken
to the Dyess hospital and are in
good condition," said Air Force
spokesman Linda Gellnere of
Dyess Air Force Base, where the
long-range bomber was based.
The plane crashed about 3:30
p.m., about eight miles northwest
of here.
Lou Paulsen of Abilene, who
witnessed the crash, said the
plane appeared to be making a
normal flight awav from the base

when smoke coming out
a left engine as the craft cir
cling.
"At first there was just a puff
of smoke, then fire," said Paulsen,
who was about two miles away.
"It looked like it smarted to go out,
then it flared up big."
Paulsen, who is an Air Force
reserve member, said the pilot ap
parently abandoned hope of re
turning to Dyess and decided to
ditch the plane in an unpopulated
area.
"It banked back toward the left,
then they started ejecting," said
Paulsen, who was watching with
his wife. "Three chutes came out,
right after another. Then the
plane started veering left into the
country.
"The last parachute came out
seconds before the plane crashed
in a ravine in an unpopulated
area," he said.

When it hit, the plane exploded
in a fireball 10 stories high. White
smoke could be seen for more than
20 miles, filling the sky west of
Abilene, witnesses said.
The crew's dramatic escape was
captured by a television film crew.
"We looked out our window to
the west and we saw a B-l aircraft
with flames coming out of the
back," said Joyce Heiser of KTAB
TV in Abilene. "We followed it
with a camera. It headed off to
the north and the east."
The plane went down a couple
of miles north of Interstate 20 in
an open field. Emergency and res
cue vehicles were at the scene less
than half an hour after the crash.
The base was the first in the
country to get the B-l and is till
the flight training center.
The Air Force ordered 100 of
the planes at a total cost of $27
billion.
