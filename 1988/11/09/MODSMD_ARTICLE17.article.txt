Most students are out
of step with the rest
of the nation's voters

IN 1980, independent presiden
tial candidate John Anderson
predicted that, "As Stanford
goes, so goes the nation." Unfortu
nately for Gov. Michael Dukakis,
reality has shown otherwise.
The results of yesterday's gen
eral election show that most Stan
ford students are out of step with
the majority of the nation.
Results from last week's mock
election held by the American
Studies House gave the Democratic
candidate Dukakis a win, 69 per
cent to 28 percent, over Vice Pres
ident George Bush.
With 92 percent of the nation's
vote recorded, the general public
gave Republican candidate Bush a
popular vote victory of 54 percent
to 46 percent. In electoral votes,
Bush has garnered 426 to Dukakis'
112.
Although Stanford students have
proven themselves to be out of step
with the nation, they are more in
touch with the future.
In selecting Dukakis as their
preferred candidate for president,
Stanford students opted for a pro
gressive set of priorities, a more
fbrwafa-fedching attitude and the
not a hindrance, to its citizens.
Students rejected the theory that
government should stay out of
citizens' lives. In 1980, Ronald
Reagan began a crusade to cut
down the size of government, ar
guing that federal bureaucracy op
presses the economy and prevents
Americans from reaching their po
tential.
While the economy has shown
positive effects over the past eight
years, it has been at the expense

of almost 35 million poor Ameri
cans who have been neglected. An
other estimated 2 million remain
homeless.
Even though more Americans
hold jobs than at any other time
in history, most of the newly
created jobs have been service
related minimum wage positions.
More than one-third of Americans
are functionally illiterate.
Those statistics are not a source
of pride for a country that
proclaims itself to be the "leader
of the free world." Stanford stu
dents have realized that this coun
try can do better, without jeopar
dizing a strong economy and
strong national defense.
Agreeing with the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, students here have recog
nized that the government's cur
rent priorities are a detriment to
the future.
Dukakis' priorities are a neces
sity for the future. Revamped and
renewed social spending programs
are needed to balance the over
whelming commitment of the
Reagan-Bush administration to de
fense spending. In an age where
arms reduction is a priority and a
necessity for both the United
States and the Soviet Union, a
focus on domestic issues, especially
spending, moves us forward as a
nation.
Concerned students must call for
preservation of the environment, a
mandatory national health
ance program Tor all working
citizens, and a renewed welfare
program that would help im
poverished and unemployed
citizens find good, paying jobs that
provide a decent standard of living.
Students cannot be complacent.
Just knowing that reforms are
needed is not enough.
With Bush as president-elect —
and especially with Dan Quayle as
vice-president elect — fighting for
progress becomes an even more cri
tical goal.
