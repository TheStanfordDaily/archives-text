## On the subjectivity of art 
### 
I EN JOY the symphony. About three
times a year I drive up to San Fran
cisco just to go to Davies Symphony
Hall. This past week was one of those
times. The program was diverse — a
Mozart Piano Concerto, Rachmaninov's
Symphonic Dances and Eliot Carter's
Symphony for Three Orchestras.
I enjoyed the Mozart and the Rach
maninov. But I hated the Carter, and I
saw no reason for anyone to do otherwise.
I really don't think that if Beethoven had
written it I would have felt any differ
ently.
There was no hint of a theme or
rhythm or harmony or anything musical.
There may have been some technical in
novations in the score, but the sound
was painful and the rhythm was nowhere,
and that's all that counts.
As I see it, there are three aspects to
music: melody, harmony and rhythm. If
none of these are present, then there can
fxi nommf "IrrTSfe'^sounds (I don't want
to call it music) for me.
I'm not the only one who felt this way.
No one applauded it, except for one very
noticeable freak in the second row. And,
during the intermission, I came across a
distressing scene. A kindly old woman
was innocently asking one of the ushers,
in a very soft and confused voice, "Why
did they have to play that? Would you
please tell me? Why?"
The usher said, "I don't know why,
ma'am." Nobody knows!
That hasn't been my only experience
with questionable art. There was the time
I made the mistake of going to the

Museum of Modern Art in Los Angeles.
They were showing an exhibit of Abstract
Impressionist Art.
Let me describe one of the pieces to
you (it won't be too hard). A large white
canvas hung on the wall and, in the
precise center of the canvas, there was
a solid black rectangle. I admit the artist
did a good job of painting a rectangle.
1 may be old-fashioned, but in order
to appreciate art, I have to be able to
admire some creativity and mastery.
Without any evidence of these, there can
be nothing to distinguish a masterpiece
from a child's fingerpainting, save the
meaning. In fact, I've seen a lot of can
vases that have looked more primitive
than children's fingerpaints.
But simply for the reason that so-and
so genius painted them, these canvases
were lauded as significant and meaning
ful statements. Bah! I should be able to
look at a single work and not have to
turn to the author to get meaning or to
appreciate artistic ability.
Works should be able to stand on their
own. Otherwise, they can have no place
outside the artist's immediate environ
ment. Indeed, by being wholly abstracted
from life, they become so intensely per
sonalized that showing them to the public
would be self-centered.
And I won't even mention performance
graphic artists (the guys who throw a
can of paint into a propellor stream and
let it splat against a canvas, or let their
dogs run across a canvas with wet paws)
because I firmly believe they're trying
to pull a big joke on us all.

Getting back to music, somebody has
offered the explanation that composers
don't write what we consider music any
more because they feel that all its forms
have been done to completion. They feel
that there can be nothing more perfect,
say, than Beethoven's Ninth for a sym
phony, so they don't try.
This explanation could be used for
modern graphic artists as well. In either
case, I certainly hope it isn't true. I'd
hate to think that a lot of modern artists
are just wimps because they're not chal
lenging their own abilities. But, like the
old lady at the symphony, I cannot come
up with any other explanation, and ii'p
frustrating.
It should be mentioned that not all
modern art angers me. It's just these
large cliques of artists that go about in
sulting people's intelligence and providing
fodder for pseudo-intellectuals with their
non-public works.
If they'd just have more faith in them
selves, and stop hiding behind some sup
posedly more profound and elusive form,
then maybe we'd see even more great art
today.
By the way, my pet labrador is genius
at interpretive dance.

As I see it, there are three aspects to
music: melody, harmony and rhythm. If
none of these are present, then there can
fxi nommf "IrrTSfe'^sounds (I don't want
to call it music) for me.
I'm not the only one who felt this way.
No one applauded it, except for one very
noticeable freak in the second row. And,
during the intermission, I came across a
distressing scene. A kindly old woman
was innocently asking one of the ushers,
in a very soft and confused voice, "Why
did they have to play that? Would you
please tell me? Why?"
The usher said, "I don't know why,
ma'am." Nobody knows!
That hasn't been my only experience
with questionable art. There was the time
I made the mistake of going to the

Museum of Modern Art in Los Angeles.
They were showing an exhibit of Abstract
Impressionist Art.
Let me describe one of the pieces to
you (it won't be too hard). A large white
canvas hung on the wall and, in the
precise center of the canvas, there was
a solid black rectangle. I admit the artist
did a good job of painting a rectangle.
1 may be old-fashioned, but in order
to appreciate art, I have to be able to
admire some creativity and mastery.
Without any evidence of these, there can
be nothing to distinguish a masterpiece
from a child's fingerpainting, save the
meaning. In fact, I've seen a lot of can
vases that have looked more primitive
than children's fingerpaints.
But simply for the reason that so-and
so genius painted them, these canvases
were lauded as significant and meaning
ful statements. Bah! I should be able to
look at a single work and not have to
turn to the author to get meaning or to
appreciate artistic ability.
Works should be able to stand on their
own. Otherwise, they can have no place
outside the artist's immediate environ
ment. Indeed, by being wholly abstracted
from life, they become so intensely per
sonalized that showing them to the public
would be self-centered.
And I won't even mention performance
graphic artists (the guys who throw a
can of paint into a propellor stream and
let it splat against a canvas, or let their
dogs run across a canvas with wet paws)
because I firmly believe they're trying
to pull a big joke on us all.

Getting back to music, somebody has
offered the explanation that composers
don't write what we consider music any
more because they feel that all its forms
have been done to completion. They feel
that there can be nothing more perfect,
say, than Beethoven's Ninth for a sym
phony, so they don't try.
This explanation could be used for
modern graphic artists as well. In either
case, I certainly hope it isn't true. I'd
hate to think that a lot of modern artists
are just wimps because they're not chal
lenging their own abilities. But, like the
old lady at the symphony, I cannot come
up with any other explanation, and ii'p
frustrating.
It should be mentioned that not all
modern art angers me. It's just these
large cliques of artists that go about in
sulting people's intelligence and providing
fodder for pseudo-intellectuals with their
non-public works.
If they'd just have more faith in them
selves, and stop hiding behind some sup
posedly more profound and elusive form,
then maybe we'd see even more great art
today.
By the way, my pet labrador is genius
at interpretive dance.
