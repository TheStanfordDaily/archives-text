# Republicans sweep local election
## Campbell, Wilson and Morgan convincingly win respective contests 
### Burke Smith, Laura Jacobson Eric Young Senior staff writers 
In a festive atmosphere with "Happy
Days Are Here Again" playing in the
background, local Republicans cele
brated the victories of Stanford Law
Prof. Tom Campbell, Stanford alumnus
State Sen. Becky Morgan and incumbent
Sen. Pete Wilson.
Campbell, who beat incumbent Rep.
Ernie Konnyu in the Republican pri
mary last spring, won an election that
was not as close as some expected. As
of 1:45 a.m, he was leading 53 percent
to 45 percent.
Campbell was slow to declare victory
to the partisan crowd of 400 people
gathered at Menlo Park's Stanford Park
Hotel, largely because challenger Anna
Eshoo refused to concede even though
early returns showed her losing con
siderably — by as much as 10 points.

Eshoo, who has served on the San
Mateo Board of Supervisors for the last
six years, appeared on Channel 4 at
11:50 p.m. saying "we have great hope."
Finally, at around 1:25 a.m. Eshoo
conceded defeat.
Eshoo delivered an upbeat concession
speech, saying "I can't shed any tears,
because frankly I'm proud and very hap
py." She later called the campaign "cou
rageous" because of the hard work of
her supporters.
"I put in a call to Tom Campbell, I
congratulated him and wished him
Godspeed," she said.
Though not officially declaring vic
tory, at 12:10 a.m. Campbell did say "I
believe that it will not be turned
around."
He told the jubilant crowd that with
93 percent of San Mateo County, 67
percent of Santa Clara County and 68
percent of Santa Cruz County votes
counted his lead remained 53 percent
to 45 percent.

Campbell, whose father died recently,
told the crowd "I believe my dad is
watching us from heaven, and I firmly
believe he chose to go there to exercise
influence on the election."
In an interview with The Daily earlier
in the week, Campbell said the race
with Eshoo was a "little tighter" than
expected largely because the Democratic
party contributed the most money ever
to a race in this district with the per
ceived weakness of Konnyu.
Democrats were expected to have a
chance to win the district only if Konnyu
survived the primary, but late polls
showed Eshoo gaining on or pulling
ahead of Campbell in a district that has
had a tradition, before Konnyu, of elect
ing moderate to liberal Republicans.
Campbell also said in the interview
that he hoped to serve in Congress for
10 years, after which he would probably
return to teach at Stanford.

Sen. Pete Wilson, left, dubbed "jinx buster" for his successful defense of a seat
traditionally hard to hold, raises a victory salute with Charlton Heston.
The senatorial race between
Sen. Wilson and Lt. Gov. Leo Mc-
Carthy was more decisive than
Campbell's victory. As predicted,
Wilson successfully defended his
senate seat beating Leo McCarthy
53.5 percent to 43 percent at press
time.
Wilson, who won the seat in
1982 by defeating former Gov. Ed
mund Brown Jr., attempted to do
what no incumbent of the "jinxed
seat" has done in nearly four
decades — get re-elected.
California's Republican Gov.
George Deukmejian, addressing a
jubilant GOP victory celebration,
immediately presented Wilson
with a "Jinx Buster" T-shirt.
Wilson, leading McCarthy in
every statewide poll before elec
tion day, expressed confidence
early in the evening, while Mc-
Carthy's staff said exit polls
showed the contest was a dead
heat.
In his victory speech, Wilson
sharply criticized McCarthy as his
Republican supporters cheered.
"I think we outfought him and
I think frankly he ran a real
strange campaign," Wilson said.
"He wound up as he did, earning
the editorial condemnation of
newspapers up and down the
state." One national television
show, he added, gave McCarthy
"an award for the sleaziest (ad
vertising) spot of the 1988
season."
Wilson was slow to formally
claim victory, and McCarthy was
equally slow to concede defeat.

"I'm going to concede," McCar
thy told the Associated Press
shortly before addressing his sup
porters.
Dubbed the "battle of the
blands" for the contenders' lack
of flamboyance and charisma,
both candidates relied on televi
sion for the thrust of their cam
paigns, generally preferring
packaged commercials to sponta
neous rallies.
McCarthy had used his largely
ceremonial state office as a
springboard to the Senate, trav
eling extensively throughout the
state and solidifying his political
base.

Morgan easily defended her seat
in the 11th district easily, winning
65 percent to 32 percent.
Early in the evening, with
returns showing her sizeably
ahead, she told the gathering at
the Stanford Park Hotel, "They
started in the spring thinking
they had an easy time. We showed
them it wasn't so easy."
Morgan, a '78 graduate of the
Graduate School of Business,
praised her campaign workers,
saying she is "only as good as the
people around" her.
Morgan was challenged by Tom
Nolan, who started his race after
the original candidate died.

vertising) spot of the 1988
season."
Wilson was slow to formally
claim victory, and McCarthy was
equally slow to concede defeat.

"I'm going to concede," McCar
thy told the Associated Press
shortly before addressing his sup
porters.
Dubbed the "battle of the
blands" for the contenders' lack
of flamboyance and charisma,
both candidates relied on televi
sion for the thrust of their cam
paigns, generally preferring
packaged commercials to sponta
neous rallies.
McCarthy had used his largely
ceremonial state office as a
springboard to the Senate, trav
eling extensively throughout the
state and solidifying his political
base.

Morgan easily defended her seat
in the 11th district easily, winning
65 percent to 32 percent.
Early in the evening, with
returns showing her sizeably
ahead, she told the gathering at
the Stanford Park Hotel, "They
started in the spring thinking
they had an easy time. We showed
them it wasn't so easy."
Morgan, a '78 graduate of the
Graduate School of Business,
praised her campaign workers,
saying she is "only as good as the
people around" her.
Morgan was challenged by Tom
Nolan, who started his race after
the original candidate died.

Tom Campbell, left, and Becky Morgan greet well wishers at last
night's celebration in Menlo Park. Both candidates were vlctorius.
In a festive atmosphere with "Happy
Days Are Here Again" playing in the
background, local Republicans cele
brated the victories of Stanford Law
Prof. Tom Campbell, Stanford alumnus
State Sen. Becky Morgan and incumbent
Sen. Pete Wilson.
Campbell, who beat incumbent Rep.
Ernie Konnyu in the Republican pri
mary last spring, won an election that
was not as close as some expected. As
of 1:45 a.m, he was leading 53 percent
to 45 percent.
Campbell was slow to declare victory
to the partisan crowd of 400 people
gathered at Menlo Park's Stanford Park
Hotel, largely because challenger Anna
Eshoo refused to concede even though
early returns showed her losing con
siderably — by as much as 10 points.

Eshoo, who has served on the San
Mateo Board of Supervisors for the last
six years, appeared on Channel 4 at
11:50 p.m. saying "we have great hope."
Finally, at around 1:25 a.m. Eshoo
conceded defeat.
Eshoo delivered an upbeat concession
speech, saying "I can't shed any tears,
because frankly I'm proud and very hap
py." She later called the campaign "cou
rageous" because of the hard work of
her supporters.
"I put in a call to Tom Campbell, I
congratulated him and wished him
Godspeed," she said.
Though not officially declaring vic
tory, at 12:10 a.m. Campbell did say "I
believe that it will not be turned
around."
He told the jubilant crowd that with
93 percent of San Mateo County, 67
percent of Santa Clara County and 68
percent of Santa Cruz County votes
counted his lead remained 53 percent
to 45 percent.

Campbell, whose father died recently,
told the crowd "I believe my dad is
watching us from heaven, and I firmly
believe he chose to go there to exercise
influence on the election."
In an interview with The Daily earlier
in the week, Campbell said the race
with Eshoo was a "little tighter" than
expected largely because the Democratic
party contributed the most money ever
to a race in this district with the per
ceived weakness of Konnyu.
Democrats were expected to have a
chance to win the district only if Konnyu
survived the primary, but late polls
showed Eshoo gaining on or pulling
ahead of Campbell in a district that has
had a tradition, before Konnyu, of elect
ing moderate to liberal Republicans.
Campbell also said in the interview
that he hoped to serve in Congress for
10 years, after which he would probably
return to teach at Stanford.

Sen. Pete Wilson, left, dubbed "jinx buster" for his successful defense of a seat
traditionally hard to hold, raises a victory salute with Charlton Heston.
The senatorial race between
Sen. Wilson and Lt. Gov. Leo Mc-
Carthy was more decisive than
Campbell's victory. As predicted,
Wilson successfully defended his
senate seat beating Leo McCarthy
53.5 percent to 43 percent at press
time.
Wilson, who won the seat in
1982 by defeating former Gov. Ed
mund Brown Jr., attempted to do
what no incumbent of the "jinxed
seat" has done in nearly four
decades — get re-elected.
California's Republican Gov.
George Deukmejian, addressing a
jubilant GOP victory celebration,
immediately presented Wilson
with a "Jinx Buster" T-shirt.
Wilson, leading McCarthy in
every statewide poll before elec
tion day, expressed confidence
early in the evening, while Mc-
Carthy's staff said exit polls
showed the contest was a dead
heat.
In his victory speech, Wilson
sharply criticized McCarthy as his
Republican supporters cheered.
"I think we outfought him and
I think frankly he ran a real
strange campaign," Wilson said.
"He wound up as he did, earning
the editorial condemnation of
newspapers up and down the
state." One national television
show, he added, gave McCarthy
"an award for the sleaziest (ad
vertising) spot of the 1988
season."
