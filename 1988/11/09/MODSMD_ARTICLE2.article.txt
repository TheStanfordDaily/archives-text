# Republicans sweep local election
## Campbell, Wilson and Morgan convincingly win respective contests 
### Burke Smith, Laura Jacobson Eric Young Senior staff writers 
In a festive atmosphere with "Happy
Days Are Here Again" playing in the
background, local Republicans cele
brated the victories of Stanford Law
Prof. Tom Campbell, Stanford alumnus
State Sen. Becky Morgan and incumbent
Sen. Pete Wilson.
Campbell, who beat incumbent Rep.
Ernie Konnyu in the Republican pri
mary last spring, won an election that
was not as close as some expected. As
of 1:45 a.m, he was leading 53 percent
to 45 percent.
Campbell was slow to declare victory
to the partisan crowd of 400 people
gathered at Menlo Park's Stanford Park
Hotel, largely because challenger Anna
Eshoo refused to concede even though
early returns showed her losing con
siderably â€” by as much as 10 points.

Eshoo, who has served on the San
Mateo Board of Supervisors for the last
six years, appeared on Channel 4 at
11:50 p.m. saying "we have great hope."
Finally, at around 1:25 a.m. Eshoo
conceded defeat.
Eshoo delivered an upbeat concession
speech, saying "I can't shed any tears,
because frankly I'm proud and very hap
py." She later called the campaign "cou
rageous" because of the hard work of
her supporters.
"I put in a call to Tom Campbell, I
congratulated him and wished him
Godspeed," she said.
Though not officially declaring vic
tory, at 12:10 a.m. Campbell did say "I
believe that it will not be turned
around."
He told the jubilant crowd that with
93 percent of San Mateo County, 67
percent of Santa Clara County and 68
percent of Santa Cruz County votes
counted his lead remained 53 percent
to 45 percent.

Campbell, whose father died recently,
told the crowd "I believe my dad is
watching us from heaven, and I firmly
believe he chose to go there to exercise
influence on the election."
In an interview with The Daily earlier
in the week, Campbell said the race
with Eshoo was a "little tighter" than
expected largely because the Democratic
party contributed the most money ever
to a race in this district with the per
ceived weakness of Konnyu.
Democrats were expected to have a
chance to win the district only if Konnyu
survived the primary, but late polls
showed Eshoo gaining on or pulling
ahead of Campbell in a district that has
had a tradition, before Konnyu, of elect
ing moderate to liberal Republicans.
Campbell also said in the interview
that he hoped to serve in Congress for
10 years, after which he would probably
return to teach at Stanford.
