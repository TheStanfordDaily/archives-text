## AIDS spread would not be contained by carding plan 
### 
WE ARE writing in response to
the Nov. 3 article, "AIDS can
be contained." Bill Brown had
interesting and valid points to make
about the inadequacies of health policy
and education, but we have strong
objections to several of his statements.
Brown identified containment as the
major difference between other diseases
("tuberculosis, leprosy, the plague,
etc."), for which containment was
attempted, and AIDS, for which no
formal containment program exists.
The major difference between AIDS
and the other diseases is not contain
ment, but that AIDS is all but uni
formly and quickly fatal. While the
disfigurement and social stigma that
can occur with the other diseases are

undesirable and even miserable, these
are problems with which one can live.
A majority of the people infected
with HIV will get AIDS and nearly all
of those who get AIDS will die. The
other epidemics were devastating, but
we have learned from them that rapid
responses from medicine and science,
education, knowledge and compassion
are our most effective measures to
address a new disease.
AIDS identifies our lack of effective
health policy and our inappropriate
response to what we can now call an
epidemic. However, we have great
objection to Brown's statement, "AIDS
is a disease that preys on our lack of
public health policy much more than it
preys on humans."

Public policy may be inadequate and
an embarrassment, but AIDS preys on
humans in a dramatic way: It is people
who suffer and die. This trivialization
of the human factor is surprising and
unfortunate, especially for someone
entering the medical profession.
Brown's solution to AIDS — contain
ment — is unfeasible and dangerous.
The "AIDS test" measures a person's
response to HIV. The response
(seroconversion) cannot be measured
for weeks or months following expo
sure to HIV.
People who test negative may be
infected carriers but have a card in
their wallet that says "Safe." They
then feel free to engage in sexual
activity and/or needle sharing, endan-

gering the lives of sex and drug
partners.
Testing and carding every U.S.
resident would do little more than give
people a false sense of safety, causing
some abandonment of "safer sex" and
clean needle practices and opening the
flood gates to a bigger epidemic.
Any attempts to lessen or cure the
AIDS epidemic are admirable, but such
a complex medical, biological and social
problem needs a more insightful solu
tion. Brown's lack of compassion for
the tens of thousands dead and mil
lions infected is unfortunate.
