# Ban on Lambda Nu party is a product of hypersensitivity
## 
### 
As were many other students, I was
disappointed with the cancellation of
the Lambda Nu "Tribal Possession"
party.
In my opinion, the University was
acting in a highly presumptuous and
overreactive way by pressuring this
decision.
As a student with Haitian ethnic
origin who has attended the "Tribal
Possession" party in the past, I fail to
see or feel the "racist motives" that
the party has just recently been as
signed.
Lambda Nu is a house whose mem
bers actively embrace the uniqueness
and beauty of other races. The stu
dents behind the planning of the
"Tribal Possession" party have both
visited and researched the countries

and cultures that they mimic.
These students make the party a
welcome celebration of every race's
tribal past, not as Ujamaa Resident
Assistant Rachel Wiesen has concluded,
a medium to "make fun of another
culture."
Unless Wiesen has attended the
"Tribal Possession" party in the past,
she has absolutely no basis for her
hypersensitive assumption and accusa
tion.
