# Candles will burn tonight in memory of Kristallnacht
## 
### 
On the evening of Nov. 9, people
around the world will be commemorat
ing the fiftieth anniversary of Kristal
lnacht, the Night of Broken Glass. On
Nov. 9, 1938, throughout Germany and

Austria, there were riots in which
Jewish shops, homes and synagogues
were broken into, destroyed and
burned. Many Jews were killed and
injured, and over 20,000 were arrested
and sent to concentration camps.
Although Jewish people had been
persecuted in Germany for years, there
had never been organized murder and
destruction on such a large scale. Kris
tallnacht is seen as the symbolic begin
ning of the Holocaust, the systematic
destruction of over six million Jews.
The only way that we can prevent a
second holocaust, of any group, is to
remember — to tell and retell the
story so that even when the witnesses
have grown old and died the legacy
will continue to haunt us.
On Wednesday night, Jews will be
lighting memorial candles and placing
them in their windows in honor of the
fiftieth anniversary of Kristallnacht. I
urge all members of the Stanford com
munity to join us in this commemora
tion. Light a candle on the evening of
Nov. 9, not only in memory of those

who died, but also as a statement of
our commitment never to let such a
thing happen again.
