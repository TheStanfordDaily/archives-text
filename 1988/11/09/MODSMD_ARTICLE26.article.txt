As the new guardian of the
Gates of Meyer, "The Thinker"
greets the mass of students
dedicating their evening to study.
Newly positioned in front of
Meyer Library like a gigantic lawn
jockey sits Rodin's "The
Thinker," one of the most famous
sculptures in the world. Brought
to its permanent home Oct. 27
after a 6-year U.S. tour, "The
Thinker" is the latest addition to
the Stanford Rodin collection.

lived from 1840-1917, is widely
considered one of the greatest
sculptors of all time. Albert Elsen,
a world renowned Rodin scholar
and professor of art history at
Stanford, equates Rodin's stature
as a sculptor to Shakespeare's as
a writer.
Thanks to the generosity of
donor B. Gerald Cantor, the Uni
versity possesses approximately
160 Rodin sculptures, giving
Stanford a collection second only
to the Musee Rodin in Paris.
"No campus in the world has
as many Rodin sculptures as we
do," Elsen said.
Cantor, an investment banker

with offices in Beverly Hills and
New York City, began collecting
Rodin sculptures in 1947. By
1974, he owned the world's larg
est private collection.
Elsen worked with Cantor over
the years acquiring the vast col
lection. And in 1974, when Cantor
decided the public should have a
chance to view his acquisitions,
Elsen helped Cantor with exhibi
tion space at the Stanford
Museum of Art.
Cantor continued to give and

lend more sculptures to the Uni
versity. In 1985 the B. Gerald
Cantor Rodin Sculpture Garden
was opened adjacent to the
Museum.
The best spot for Rodin viewing
is the garden outside the museum.
Twenty of Rodin's greatest full
sized works are on display, illu
minating Rodin's immense
understanding of anatomy.
The most prominent work in
cluded here is his masterpiece
"The Gates of Hell." Called "the

single most important work of
sculpture in the 19th century" by
Elsen in his book "Purposes of
Art," "The Gates of Hell" is a
huge, awe-inspiring wall of angst,
featuring miniature versions of
"The Thinker" and"The Kiss."
Soon all of the sculptures in
the garden will have ground light
ing installed for night viewing.
This will allow visitors to take
advantage of the world's only 24-
hour Rodin Garden.
Inside the museum there are a
number of notable works, includ
ing the famous "The Kiss."

There are five 'Gates
of Hell' and about 29
Thinkers,' but they
are all equally
original.

Several sculptures are also
strewn about the Quad. These
works are the "Burghers of
Calais," six sculptures com
memorating French heroes of the
Hundred Years War.
Despite some local newspaper
reports calling the Stanford
"Thinker" a "copy," it, like all the
Rodins on campus, is completely
authentic. No Rodin sculpture is
a one-of-a-kind cast.
There are, for instance, five
"Gates of Hells" and about 29
"Thinkers." But they were all
made from Rodin's original casts
and therefore they are all equally
original.


"The Thinker" ponders close up. Rodin's famous sculpture is the
latest addition to Stanford's 160-piece collection of the French
artist's work.
