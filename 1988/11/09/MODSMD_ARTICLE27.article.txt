# Gutsy rescue group serves hikers
## Finding and solving mountain mishaps keep wily volunteers busy

"We will go any place, at any
time, to help anyone, for no
charge," according to the unoffi
cial motto of the Mountain Rescue
Association.
Bay Area Mountain Rescue
Unit members strive to uphold
this motto, and although timer
consuming and physically de
manding at times, mountain
rescue can be a "quietly satisfying
activity," according to member
Wally Mann.
A local search and rescue unit
operating out of San Mateo
County, the group responds to
calls for help all over California,
primarily in the Sierra Nevada
Mountains. Certified by the
Mountain Rescue Association, a
national organization of rescuers,
the unit also cooperates with and
responds to calls from the San
Mateo County Sheriffs' Depart
ment.
The unit has attracted volun
teers from all walks of life, in
cluding a bus driver, an engineer,
three Stanford graduate students
and a Stanford medical student.
Group hopefuls train from six
months to a year, learning search
and rescue skills, including track
ing skills, and general climbing
and mountaineering skills. In
preparation for the worst,
trainees learn to handle technical
cliff rescues, medical emergencies,
and ice and crevasse rescues.
The trainees and members at
tend monthly meetings and prac
tices, and are required to respond

to two-thirds of the unit's calls
to search and rescue. Along with
the time commitment to the unit,
the members are responsible for
their own food, equipment and
transportation needed for each
search.
If the trainees have successfully
demonstrated the necessary
skills, the group's board of direc
tors will then approve member
ship, but only if they feel there
is a rapport between all members
of the group.
The success rate of the unit is
very high — they nearly always
find the missing hiker. The typical
search usually begins with a
'hasty search,' according to Mann,
where the rescue unit locks in the
most obvious places for the miss
ing hiker, such as campsites and

trails.
Following the 'hasty search' is
a detailed search of the last place
the hiker was known to be. This
stage involves the highly refined
tracking skills, which may reveal
an upturned stone on a dry creek
bed or a bent blade of grass, in
dicating the hiker's recent pass
ing. It's a very involved process
which requires an eye for detail
as well as a great deal of patience.
All this occurs in the first cou
ple of days, by which time usually
90 percent of the missing people
are found.
"It's the kind of thing that
anybody can do," Mann said, but
it takes a special type of person
to commit to the task. For more
information about the group, con
