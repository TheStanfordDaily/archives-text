In the following articte, Mann
recollects some of his experiences
as a member of the Bay Area
Mountain Rescue Unit, (see
related story)
The Bay Area Mountain Res
cue Unit is on call 24 hours a
day to search for missing people.
In my two years with the group,
we've been involved with activ
ities ranging from rescuing a
man in Devil's Canyon who fell
from a cliff, joining 260 other
people in finding a mentally
retarded man lost in Yosemite
and even tracking a couple who
didn't return from a Sierra
Singles outing —■ but we discov
ered they weren't really lost.
On my first search, I drove
eight hours with Jim Eilers to
the Palisades, on the east side
of the Sierra. Within an hour
after arriving, Jim and I were
flown by helicoptor up to 10,000
feet and dropped amongst some
lakes. Enroute Jim noticed a
blue object between two of the
lakes.
We bushwacked along the
lakeshores, moving up toward

the base of the Palisade glacier.
Our assignment took us near the
blue object and using radios we
confirmed that none of the
other teams in the area had
checked it out.
We did, and our search ended.
The missing man was there, un-
a suicide victim, but
« pirn's observation spared 30
n |9t,her searcheirs ah extra tf&y of
work.
This past summer, I put my
life on hold for a week while I
joined the search for Tim
Barnes, a young man on a two
mile day hike out from Tenaya
Lake in Yosemite National
Park. We were flown into foot
less tracks around Tuolumne
Peak and spent our days scram
bling up and down boulder
choked drainages and steep
ridges in an unsuccessful at
tempt to locate Barnes.
On my last assignment of the
search I joined three other
searchers for three days in the
Tuolumne river basin.
The search lasted seven days
and involved up to 200 people,
three dog teams, two helicopters
and an infrared scanner. Despite
the effort no sign of Barnes was
ever found.
On the fourth night of the
Barnes search, a report arrived
at the base camp during dinner
that 73-year-old Maijorie Max
well was lost in the Clouds Rest
area. Yosemite Search and Res
cue 'hasty teams' left immedi
ately. Half an hour later unit

member Maury Tripp, his
bloodhound Sarah, and I were
flown by helicopter to Sunrise
lakes.
The next 15 hours were some
of the most rewarding search
time I've done yet. Maury
worked the dog and spotted
tracks. (Maury can jog down a
rock-punctuated trail at night,
While holding a flashlight iti oifg
hand and a tugging dog in the
other, and pick out tracks
which, after he stopped and
pointed them out, I eventually
discerned.)
I worked map and radio, com
municating with the 'hasty
team' members to piece to
gether the scenario of the mis
sing person. It's important for
Maury to have a mental picture
of search details so that he can
interpret his bloodhound's ac
tions.
After two hours sleep we met
Maijorie's son, Walter. He hiked
with us to where she was last
seen. With Walter's help, one of
her street shoes, and Maury's
encyclopedic knowledge of New
Balance soles, we identified
what proved to be the correct
footprint.
We were about to resuire
tracking when a brilliant hunch
by a Yosemite Search & Rescue
team member paid off. He had
looked over the cliff and seen a
likely granite slab which a lost
person might wander down. She
had, and he followed and found
her alive and well.
