# Smokers' tax rises, Prop. 102 dies
## 
### Rob Burwell Editorial staff 
As of 1:45 a.m., Californians
threw support behind a cigarette
and tobacco tax, rejected an ini
tiative that required the reporting
of people exposed to the AIDS
virus and voted down all but two
of the insurance propositions,
which were too close to call at
press time.
The cigarette and tobacco tax
initiative, Prop. 99, was less
popular with California voters
than with participants in last
week's mock election at Stanford,
but it still managed to pass by a
comfortable 58 to 42 percent mar
gin. In the mock election, students
favored the tax by an overwhelm
ing 88 percent.
Although earning the support
of Gov. George Deukmejian, Prop.
102 marked the third time an in
itiative concerning the reporting
of exposure to the AIDS virus lost
on the California ballot.
Sixty-four percent of the voters
opposed the proposition.
Described by opponents as
"worse than Laßouche" — refer
ring to political extremeist Lyn
don Laßouche who has often ad

vocated a quarantine for people
with AIDS — Prop. 102 would
have required doctors, blood
banks and others to report people
they had reason to believe had
been infected or tested positive
for the AIDS virus to local health
officials and sexual partners.
Prop. 103, supported by the
well-known consumer advocate
Ralph Nader, could mandate an
immediate 20-percent reduction in
auto, homeowner and business in
surance rates. But the tally was
too close to call as of 1:45 a.m.
If passed, Prop. 103 could re
quire an additional discount for
good drivers, make the state in
surance commissioner an elected
office, require that commissioner
to approve all rate hikes and allow
banks to sell insurance.
Christine Dalton, a campaign
aide for Voter Revolt — the group
that sponsored Prop. 103 — said,
"Compared with how little people
trust lawyers and trust insurance
companies, everyone trusts Ralph
Nader. Nader will make the dif
ference."
Prop. 106, placed on the ballot
by insurance companies, could set
limits on contingency fees which
an attorney may collect in tort

Lawyers usually receive a third
of the settlement in tort cases —
cases that result in injury, loss or
damage for which the injured
party brings civil action. If Prop.
106 passes, the attorney's pay
ment could be substatially limited.
Aside from Props. 103 and 106,
the insurance propositions took a
beating in yesterday's election.
Propositions 100, 101 and 104 lost
by more substantial margins than
were expected.
Prop. 100, sponsored by Cali
fornia's trial lawyers, would have
required insurance companies to
reduce rates for good driving and
would have forced the California
Department of Insurance to
review auto insurance rates.
The largest margin of defeat
was suffered by Prop. 101, a mea
sure sponsored by insurance com
panies, which claimed to respond
to consumer revolt against
booming auto insurance rates.
Prop. 104 was also supported
by insurance companies. Under
the no-fault plan, clients deal only
with their own insurance compa
ny, rather than suing another
driver's company, to prove respon
sibility for an accident.
