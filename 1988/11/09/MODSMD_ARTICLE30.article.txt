Sherlock Holmes a fake?!?
What if instead of being the
brilliant, logical, observant detec
tive we've come to know and love,
Holmes was really a drunk,
degenerate fool who couldn't find
a clue if it bit him on the leg?
This is the premise behind
"Without a Clue," a film that ex
plores what it would be like if Dr.
Watson was really the brains be
hind the operation and Sherlock
Holmes was just a front.
Dr. Watson (Ben Kingsley), re
alizing that an M.D. who dabbled
in solving crimes wouldn't be ac
cepted in Victorian England, has
hired out-of-work actor Reginald
Kincaid (Michael Caine) to
pretend he was solving the crimes.
When Holmes oversteps his

bounds as a conduit for Watson's
deductions by declaring a case
closed when it really wasn't, Wat
son becomes peeved enough to
kick him out and just solve the
cases himself.
This, naturally, doesn't work,
because everybody wants to deal
with the legendary Sherlock
Holmes and not his companion.
So Watson is forced to ask Kincaid
back for one last case and, you
guessed it, the rest of the movie
is their attempt at solving that
case.
Kingsley and Caine are both
marvelous actors, and it's hard to
decide which one is enjoying him
self more in the film. Jeffery
Jones, who has played a series of
supporting roles in the past few
years including the principal in
"Ferris Bueller's Day Off," the
King in "Amadous" and the evil

scientist in "Howard the Duck,"
does another nifty job in the role
of Inspector Lestrade.
The one gripe, and it's a small
one, is that sometimes Holmes'
buffoonery is so overacted that it
seems hard to believe that the
good London citizens would not
be able to see through such a
drunkard. Also, the citizens of
England react to Holmes as he
travels around the countryside
with an almost Godlike reverence,
which is hard for the viewer to
relate to since we know what a
jerk he is.
These gripes are minor, how
ever, and when you see what fun
the actors are having, a little over
indulgence doesn't seem so hor
rible.

"Without a Clue " is currently play
ing at the Palo Alto Square.
