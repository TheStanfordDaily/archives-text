# COMEDY
## Townsend shuffles in for stand-up act Comic will perform two nighttime shows at Dinkelspiel this Thursday 
### Andrew Berkowitz Editorial staff 
The last thing Robert Townsend
needs is to be compared to Eddie
Murphy.
Yeah, they're both young, funny,
black, successful. But they ain't the
same guy.
While Murphy's humor emanates
from his character — never before in
history have such bad movies been made
so popular by one man — Townsend's
comes from his savvy ability to create
humor out of situation.
Witness the familiar story behind
"Hollywood Shuffle," a movie about the
exploitation of blacks in Hollywood writ
ten, produced, directed and acted in by
Townsend.

Forget about the courage
it took to mortgage his
future while financing
'Hollywood Shuffle.' For
get about his abilities to
direct, to produce and to
write. And please, forget
about Eddie Murphy.

Not only did he lend his creative tal
ents to virtually all aspects of the
filmmaking, but he also literally
brought the project together by borrow
ing leftover film stock from other pic
tures and by running up outrageous
advances on his credit cards.
As Sammy Davis Jr. would say, the
cat's got chutzpah.
In the end he managed to make "Hol
lywood Shuffle," for $100,000 — about
the same amount as Eddie Murphy's
daily meal money on the set of "The
Golden Child," yeeeech! — and the crit
ics ate it up.
Composed of sketches centering
around the life of frustrated black actor
Bobby Taylor, "Hollywood Shuffle,"
managed to lampoon white-dominated
Hollywood without alienating either
whites or Hollywood. Unlike the pic
tures of Spike Lee, another young
filmmaker to whom he has been com
pared, "Shuffle" was adored by blacks
and whites alike.
Born in Chicago as one of four
children, he grew up on the city's tough
West Side, and at age 16 became the
youngest member of The Experimental
Black Actors Guild, and later, a member
of the Second City comedy troupe.
He entered college in Chicago, but
transferred to New Jersey and com
muted to Manhattan where he studied

acting with the Negro Ensemble Com
pany. He later finished his formal ed
ucation at Hunter College.
Which brings us to Robert Townsend,
circa 1988.
Since directing Eddie Murphy's last
concert film, "Raw," Townsend has
starred in the contemporary suspense
story "Finding Maubee," opposite Den
zel Washington, and is writing his next
film, "Heartbeats," for Warner Bros.
But these days, Townsend is taking
a break from his movie schedule to go
back to his first love, stand-up comedy.
And he doesn't just love it, he's good
at it.
Townsend worked in the late 70s and
early 80s in comedy clubs alongside
(yep, him again) Eddie Murphy, and
when "Saturday Night Live" was cas
ting for a hip, young blaqk actor, a- few
years ago, Townsei^.jW*
choice behind Murphy. ly
Tomorrow night Townsend will try
to live up to his billing as one of the
brightest stars around as he brings his
stand-up act to Stanford for two shows.
Forget about the courage it took to
mortgage his future while financing
"Hollywood Shuffle." Forget about his
abilities to direct, to produce and to
write. And please, forget about Eddie
Murphy.
Robert Townsend is coming back to
stand-up.

Robert Townsend performs tomorrow
