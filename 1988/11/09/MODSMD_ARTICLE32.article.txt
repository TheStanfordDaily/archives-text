The oft-maligned Stanford Con
cert Network climaxes a successful
fall quarter with Robert Townsend's
performances tomorrow night.
The Concert Network, which had
been criticized in years past for
failing to bring big-name
performers to campus — or for
bringing smaller acts without broad
student appeal — has been re
sponsible for the beginning of the
year .Tresidder Party featuring the,
Crazy a'«» performance byi
Shadowfax and now Townsend.
In order to preserve their limited
funds for paying performers,
Townsend will be performing at
UC-Berkeley, which helped pay his
appearance fees, Friday night.
Although schedules for winter
and spring are not yet set, the
Concert Network expects to bring
some lesser-known, but popular,
acts to campus in the coming
months.
