## 'Corpse' brought to life 
### Andrew Berkowitz Editorial staff 
Palo Alto is not often thought
of by the Stanford community
as a hotbed of cultural activities.
That's too bad, because not only
is there plenty of good stuff
going on there, it also happens
to be a lot closer than San Fran
cisco or San Jose.
One of the mainstays of cul
tural life in Palo Alto — now
in their 58th season — is the
Palo Alto Players, a small, but
energetic, local theater company
whose current production,
"Corpse," is a fun time for stu
dents on a thrifty budget.
Written by Gerald Moon,
"Corpse" is a whodunit with a
twist: Two twin brothers are
doing the doing, but we don't
know which who is the who. Fol
low?
Evelyn Farrant (Glenn Hav
lan) is an out-of-work actor who

plots to murder his wealthy and
successful brother Rupert (also
played by Havlan). But, as one
would expect in a whodunit,
things don't work out precisely
as planned. A dunit is definitely
do-ed — but by who?
As with most succesful mys
teries, "Corpse" has its share of
laughs, stemming both from a
clever script — the show ran on
Broadway for a year and a half
— and from Havlan's frequent
character changes. Somehow
Havlan manages to be both
Evelyn and Rupert, often
seeming to be on the stage as
both characters simultaneously.
Although a few opening-night
jitters sent giggles through the
audience last week — including
a sword fight culminating in a
member of the audience nar
rowly avoiding being gored —
the production is entertaining
and well up to the standards
one expects from community

theater.
All Palo Alto Players shows
are in the Lucie Stern Theater,
a comfortable 425-seat play
house just minutes from
campus.
Upcoming shows this season
include "Tartuffe," the political
drama "Inquest," "The Wiz"
and the brilliant farce on theater
companies "Noises Off."

"Corpse" runs tonight through
Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at
2:30 and 7 p.m. and next Wed
nesday through Saturday (Nov.
16-19) at 8 p.m. Tickets for
"Corpse" are $7-$l2 (students
$2 off) and are available by call
ing 329-2623.
