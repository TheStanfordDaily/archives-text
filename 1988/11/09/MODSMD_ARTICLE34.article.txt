## Volleyball outslugs UOP Cardinal gets 18th straight in five-game marathon: 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
According to A1 Scates, UCLA's
celebrated men's volleyball coach,
the team that wins the third game
almost always wins the match.
Nowhere did these words ring
truer than in Maples Pavilion last
night, where the Stanford wom

from a two-game deficit to beat
University of the Pacific 2-15, 14-
16, 15-3, 15-11, 15-4 in a tense 2
hour, 47 minute contest.

Women's Volleyball
Cardinal 3, Tigers 2

With the victory, the No. 2 Car
dinal extends its school-record
consecutive win streak to 18
matches and improves its record
to a whopping 23-1. The Tigers,
ranked 12th nationally, fall to 16-
11.
"There used to be a day when
the reverse would happen in a
UOP match," Stanford Coach Don
Shaw said. "We'd come out fast,
but they'd gradually get it back
together and roll over us. I knew
that this team (Stanford) was a
better team, and I do believe that
the best team will win in three
games out of five.
"I felt that overall we were the
best team. I know that UOP's a
real good team — I'm not taking
anything away from them — but
I feel like we should be the
stronger team."
At the outset, however, it was
Pacific that seemed the mightier
opponent. Behind the hitting of

Krissy Fifer and Cathey Scotlan,
the team pulled out to a quick
5-0 lead before an ace by Cardinal
captain Laura Olesen gave Stan
ford it's first point of the match.
The rest of the game was all
UOP. Amassing an insurmount
able 11-1 advantage, the Tigers
quickly seized the first game from
a startled Stanford. The Cardinal
seemed to redeem itself in the
second stanza, only to see Pacific
chip away at a 14-8 lead to finally
take a 2-0 lead at halftime.
"They caught us by surprise,"
Shaw said. "The first game, we
were not ready to play and UOP
was, and they just jumped on us.
"The second game, we took
command and were pretty far
ahead, and I thought we had
things under control, but we went
through a spell where we either
shanked a pass or sent a spike
somewhere into the bleachers.
They didn't do anything but serve
balls in and we handed them the
game."
The scene was grim as the
dejected Stanford team walked off
to the locker room for intermis
sion. Even the Stanford faithful,
who intermittently rose to the
challenge of the vocal, orange-clad
Pacific contingent, found their
confidence put to the test.
But something happened in the
halftime meeting that turned the
match around. After but a few of
the break's 10 minutes had ex
pired, Shaw emerged from the
locker room alone and sat quietly
on the bench. Five minutes later,
the players emerged with a look
of determination that contrasted
with the Tigers' relaxed smiles.
"Don came in and said, 'I don't

know what to say, you guys pull
yourselves together,' and he left,
which was probably the best thing
he could have done, I think,"
junior Jennifer Chaffee recalled.
"We sat there, talked amongst
ourselves, got ourselves pumped
up and came out after them. We
were a different team, basically."
"I know "with this team, that
was pfSbably a good move," Shaw
said. "Other teams may not have
been able to handle it, but they
took their time, came out and they
realized it was time to play."
Stanford came out like a team J
possessed and gave Pacific a taste 4
of its own medicine. In a game«
almost identical to the first one *
with only the teams reversed, the
Cardinal blew out the flat Tigers•
15-3.
The next game was more of a
challenge, but again Stanford
came out on top. Passing better
and hitting more effectively, the
Cardinal did not lose control of
this 14-8 lead and tied the match
at two games apiece.
Greatly responsible for this
turnaround was Chaffee, who has
not faltered since leading the Car
dinal into the championship
match at the NCAA Final Four
last year with inspired play
against Texas. The Tigers were
simply unable to stop her offen
sive barrage, especially from the
back row, and the junior finished
the night with a game-high 25
kills and a stellar .500 hitting per
centage.
"All I can say is that Asper's
sets were exactly where they have
been all year, right in the right

place, and I just swung away at
them," Chaffee said.
"She had a great night," Shaw
said. "We weren't passing well
enough to set the middle and the
right side early in the match, and
when we were finally getting the
ball to the net where Asper has
three options, we started working
on the back sets because we felt
that that was a good place to at
tack these guys."
Chaffee made the most of the
opportunity, finding herself on
many occasions with just one hag
gard blocker to hit past. Pacific's
defense concentrated on left-side
hitters Kristin Klein and Amy
Hayes, giving Chaffee and middle
blocker Olesen openings to exploit
once Asper received good enough
passes to run a balanced offense.
The end result was a fifth-game
blow-out in which every Cardinal
player hit well. Klein amassed a
good portion of her 24 kills once
the rest of the hitters came alive,
and middle blocker Amy Cooper
came alive as well.
"We started passing, got fired
up, didn't get down when they
scored a point," said freshman
Nicole Appleman.
Leading the way for the Tigers
was Los Altos-native Fifer, a 6-
foot-3 middle blocker who was
devastating in her newly-adopted
left-side hitter position. Scoring
prolifically until the Cardinal
blockers sucessfully cut off the
cross-court angles she had ex
ploited most of the evening, Fifer
garnered a team-high 21 kills.
