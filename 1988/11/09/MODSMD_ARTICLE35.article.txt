# Early-season losses don't destroy NBA dynasties
## 
### 
The Lakers will not repeat.
Why? They lost one
road game.
To whom? Larry Brown's San
Antonio Spurs â€” minus David
Robinson, who is still employed
by tine U.S. Navy.

How do I know this? The San
Francisco Chronicle told me. And
they did so in no uncertain terms.
Ah, the Sporting Green, that
great bastion of journalistic hy
perbole. One Monday Lowell Cohn
will tell us thfc 49ers won't make
the playoffs. Seven days later he
lets us know they're Super Bowl
champs in the making.
You know what else? The Cel
tics are through, too. I mean, they
were knocked off by the 76ers the
other night. Robert Parrish and
Dennis Johnson are too old.
There's a good chance the Hor
nets will be playing the Warriors
for the NBA title this year.
Enough already.
There are 82 games in the damn
season and not even half a dozen
have been played. Yet, the post
mortems are already being writ
ten.
Gimme a break. At this point
in the season, the only thing
that's certain is that sportswriters

across the nation still don't know
how the names of many of the
league's players.
The Associated Press thinks
that Seattle's versatile shooting
guard/big-small forward/center
Derrick McKey is named Derrick
McKee.
My colleague Jon Weisman, in
a article on centers yesterday,
referred to Bobby Duckworth. Ac
tually, the Trail Blazers start a
fellow named Kevin at the pivot
to do the posting-up bit.
Bobby Duckworth used to catch
touchdown passes from the wide
receiver position. I believe it was
for the San Diego Chargers. I'm
certain he never had a slam dunk.
What does it all mean? I'm not
sure, but I have a theory. Weis
man and the AP are quite knowl
edgeable about sports and they
haven't even had a chance to sort
out the league's 12-man rosters.
Given that, I think it's hardly
reasonable to be mourning the
champion Lakers based on a
single road loss.
The guard is changing in the
NBA, to be sure. Portland, Dallas,
Utah, Cleveland, Atlanta, Detroit,
Chicago, New York and Denver
are on the upswing.
But, one would be a fool to
count out the Lakers. The Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar Farewell Tour
promises to be just as emotional
as Dr. J's.
In this case, L.A. should be able
to ride the emotional crest to a
lot of victories.
Add those to the victories that
Magic, Mychal, Byron, James and
A.C. would-surely pile up anyway,
