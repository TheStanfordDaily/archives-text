This is the game you remem
ber: Stanford 82, Arizona 74.
These are the games that the
Stanford men's basketball team

• lowa 78, Stanford 75
• Santa Clara 72, Stanford 71
on State Kan
ford 68 (OT)
• Washington 84, Stanford 82
(20T)
• Oregon State 63, Stanford

Stanford finished 21-12 last
season and received an NIT
berth, its first postseason bid in
46 years. But the team lost
several games it could have, or
should have, won.
"Last year we really felt like
we deserved to go to the NCAA
tournament," senior guard Terry
Taylor said. "The fact that we
didn't get in is in the back of
all our minds. It's driving us to
make sure we make it this year."
Expectations this year are
much higher. The Cardinal,
which plays the Brewster
Heights Packing Club in an ex
hibition tonight at Maples Pavil
lion at 7:30 p.m., has been picked
by many publications to be a
top-20 team and a Pacific 10
Conference title contender, and
no one would dare say the team
won't make the NCAA tourna
ment.
But to justify even the mini
mum expectations, Stanford
cannot afford the letdowns it
suffered last season.
"We've got to eliminate [the

close losses] and move toward a
performance on a more consis
tent basis," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "You must
prepare yourself for the games
you are capable of winning."
Looking at the 1988-89 Stan
ford Cardinal is looking at a
team that is capable of winning
every game it plays.
said that Stan
ford's front une is as good as
any other in the Pac-10 in terms
of depth and size.
Senior forward Howard
Wright, a 1988 U.S. Olympic
Team candidate, leads the front
line attack. Wright's numbers
improve every year, and Mont
gomery doesn't expect this year
to be any different. Wright
averaged 15.7 points and 7.7
rebounds per game in 1987-88
and led the Pac-10 with a 62.2
field-goal percentage.
Senior center Eric Reveno is
completely recovered from a
back injury that forced him to
redshirt last season, and Mont
gomery said Reveno only needs
to get used to the day-to-day
grind again. Reveno is consid
ered the winner of the non
existent Pac-10 Most Improved
Player award for 1986-87, going
from nowhere to the starting
lineup and averages of 8.8 ppg,
5.5 rpg. His 6-foot-8, 250-pound
build prevents opponents from
having their way in the low post.
Bryan McSweeney has the
repuation as a defensive stopper,
but often contributes with key
baskets as to. He sparked the
Cardinal its Pac-10 Tournament
win over Oregon last March by

Center Eric Reveno returns to the Cardinal lineup this year
and is expected to be a catalyst for a successful season.
