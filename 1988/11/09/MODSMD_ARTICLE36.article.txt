### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
This is the game you remem
ber: Stanford 82, Arizona 74.
These are the games that the
Stanford men's basketball team
can't forget:
• lowa 78, Stanford 75
• Santa Clara 72, Stanford 71
on State Kan
ford 68 (OT)
• Washington 84, Stanford 82
(20T)
• Oregon State 63, Stanford

• Arkansas State 60, Stanford

Stanford finished 21-12 last
season and received an NIT
berth, its first postseason bid in
46 years. But the team lost
several games it could have, or
should have, won.
"Last year we really felt like
we deserved to go to the NCAA
tournament," senior guard Terry
Taylor said. "The fact that we
didn't get in is in the back of
all our minds. It's driving us to
make sure we make it this year."
Expectations this year are
much higher. The Cardinal,
which plays the Brewster
Heights Packing Club in an ex
hibition tonight at Maples Pavil
lion at 7:30 p.m., has been picked
by many publications to be a
top-20 team and a Pacific 10
Conference title contender, and
no one would dare say the team
won't make the NCAA tourna
ment.
But to justify even the mini
mum expectations, Stanford
cannot afford the letdowns it
suffered last season.
"We've got to eliminate [the

close losses] and move toward a
performance on a more consis
tent basis," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "You must
prepare yourself for the games
you are capable of winning."
Looking at the 1988-89 Stan
ford Cardinal is looking at a
team that is capable of winning
every game it plays.
said that Stan
ford's front une is as good as
any other in the Pac-10 in terms
of depth and size.
Senior forward Howard
Wright, a 1988 U.S. Olympic
Team candidate, leads the front
line attack. Wright's numbers
improve every year, and Mont
gomery doesn't expect this year
to be any different. Wright
averaged 15.7 points and 7.7
rebounds per game in 1987-88
and led the Pac-10 with a 62.2
field-goal percentage.
Senior center Eric Reveno is
completely recovered from a
back injury that forced him to
redshirt last season, and Mont
gomery said Reveno only needs
to get used to the day-to-day
grind again. Reveno is consid
ered the winner of the non
existent Pac-10 Most Improved
Player award for 1986-87, going
from nowhere to the starting
lineup and averages of 8.8 ppg,
5.5 rpg. His 6-foot-8, 250-pound
build prevents opponents from
having their way in the low post.
Bryan McSweeney has the
repuation as a defensive stopper,
but often contributes with key
baskets as to. He sparked the
Cardinal its Pac-10 Tournament
win over Oregon last March by

scoring the first six points of the
second half to break open a tie
game.
"Our front line is really
healthy," Montgomery said. "We
have two starters back in Bryan
and Howard of course, and in es
sence a third starter back in
Reveno. By losing Greg Butler (to
graduation) we lose a dimension,
but we don't feel like we step back
that much."
Don't stop drawing the front
line with the starters. Junior
Derek Bruton (3.3 ppg, 1.9 rpg)
has improved and will be a solid
backup at center. Freshman Adam
Keefe has shown that he can have
an immediate impact, and sopho
more Andrew Vlahov (3.4 ppg, 3.0
rpg) returns with a sounder knee
and Australian Olympic team ex
perience. Both, in fact, will keep
McSweeney on his toes in compe
tition for the small forward start
ing slot.
And at last week's Cardinal-
White scrimmage, the most im
proved player was forward Deshon
Wingate (1.6 ppg, 1.4 rpg). The
6-7, 185-pound sophomore could
even see action at the shooting
guard spot in order to get him
more minutes.
"He has improved tremen

dously over the last year-and-a
haJf," Montgomery said. "We're
trying to find some time for him.
Obviously, if Todd's healthy,
there's not ever been a lot of play
ing time there."
Todd? Oh yeah, Todd Lichti
(20.1 ppg, 5.6 rpg). Say "guard"
with a Boston accent. That about
sums him up.
Complimenting Lichti at point
guard for the third-straight
season is senior Terry Taylor (8.8
ppg, 5.0 apg). Taylor-was third in
the Pac-10 in assists last year,
fourth in three-point shooting and
is experienced in running the of
fense. He also produced maybe
the most quizzical statistic of
1987-88, a three-point basket to
two-point basket ratio of 65:9.
Stanford is thinner at the guard
position, but senior Scott Meinert
(3.0 ppg, 1.9 apg) proved himself
an able point man in Stanford's
first-round NIT match against
Long Beach State. Meinert ran
the offense in place of a flu
stricken Taylor and got nine
points and six assists. Sophomore
John Patrick and junior Oliver
Cunningham have also shown im
provement over last season.
Basically, Stanford is a year old
er, a year wiser and a year better.
Montgomery said experience,
everybody's experience, will be a
key for consistency, and consis
tency is what Stanford definitely
needs. Its schedule includes the
Big Apple NIT, North Carolina,
WCAC-contender St. Mary's,
Florida and some tough Pac-10
matches led, of course, by Arizo
na.
"The rotation will change,"
Montgomery said, "The different
styles of play of our opponents
will affect who might be more ef
fective.
"What group plays better is not
always your best five players. The
bottom line for the group has to
be team success."

Senior forward Howard

to be any different. Wright
averaged 15.7 points and 7.7

Senior center Eric Reveno is

to get used to the day-to-day

from nowhere to the starting
lineup and averages of 8.8 ppg,

second half to break open a tie
game.
"Our front line is really
healthy," Montgomery said. "We
have two starters back in Bryan
and Howard of course, and in es
sence a third starter back in
Reveno. By losing Greg Butler (to
graduation) we lose a dimension,
but we don't feel like we step back
that much."
Don't stop drawing the front
line with the starters. Junior
Derek Bruton (3.3 ppg, 1.9 rpg)
has improved and will be a solid
backup at center. Freshman Adam
Keefe has shown that he can have
an immediate impact, and sopho
more Andrew Vlahov (3.4 ppg, 3.0
rpg) returns with a sounder knee
and Australian Olympic team ex
perience. Both, in fact, will keep
McSweeney on his toes in compe
tition for the small forward start
ing slot.
And at last week's Cardinal-
White scrimmage, the most im
proved player was forward Deshon
Wingate (1.6 ppg, 1.4 rpg). The
6-7, 185-pound sophomore could
even see action at the shooting
guard spot in order to get him
more minutes.
"He has improved tremen

dously over the last year-and-a
haJf," Montgomery said. "We're
trying to find some time for him.
Obviously, if Todd's healthy,
there's not ever been a lot of play
ing time there."
Todd? Oh yeah, Todd Lichti
(20.1 ppg, 5.6 rpg). Say "guard"
with a Boston accent. That about
sums him up.
Complimenting Lichti at point
guard for the third-straight
season is senior Terry Taylor (8.8
ppg, 5.0 apg). Taylor-was third in
the Pac-10 in assists last year,
fourth in three-point shooting and
is experienced in running the of
fense. He also produced maybe
the most quizzical statistic of
1987-88, a three-point basket to
two-point basket ratio of 65:9.
Stanford is thinner at the guard
position, but senior Scott Meinert
(3.0 ppg, 1.9 apg) proved himself
an able point man in Stanford's
first-round NIT match against
Long Beach State. Meinert ran
the offense in place of a flu
stricken Taylor and got nine
points and six assists. Sophomore
John Patrick and junior Oliver
Cunningham have also shown im
provement over last season.
Basically, Stanford is a year old
er, a year wiser and a year better.
Montgomery said experience,
everybody's experience, will be a
key for consistency, and consis
tency is what Stanford definitely
needs. Its schedule includes the
Big Apple NIT, North Carolina,
WCAC-contender St. Mary's,
Florida and some tough Pac-10
matches led, of course, by Arizo
na.
"The rotation will change,"
Montgomery said, "The different
styles of play of our opponents
will affect who might be more ef
fective.
"What group plays better is not
always your best five players. The
bottom line for the group has to
be team success."
