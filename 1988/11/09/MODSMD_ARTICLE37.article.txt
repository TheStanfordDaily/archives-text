# 'Meathead' intimidates Stanford's opponents Confessed 'couch potato' Tunney does the job at linebacker
## 
### Doug Boeschen 
There are two sides to Stanford's in
side linebacker Jono Tunney. One is the
hard-working, dedicated athlete that
football fans have seen terrorizing op
posing offenses this year. A national
power-lifting champion, Tunney has
been described by linebacker coach
Larry Kerr as "an extremely hard
worker."
But Jono Tunney has a very different
second side. This is the side that has
earned him the nickname of "Meat
head" from his teammates because of
his resemblance to the character in the
television show "All In the Family."
He's the person who loves to eat and
sleep, who has developed the reputation
of a first-class couch potato.
"If he's not in his bed then he's prob
ably on the couch," explains teammate
and good friend Scott Eschelman.
So what is the reason for this Jekyll
and-Hyde type of personality? Tunney
says it comes from his childhood.
"Before high school I did nothing," he
admits. He says he didn't study, didn't

work and often got into trouble.
But then he enrolled in Bellarmine
High School. An academically tough
private school, Bellarmine forced Tun
ney to get his act together. He developed
hard-working habits and began playing
football as a freshman because it was
something he had always wanted to do.
The hard work paid off. He graduated
with a 3.9 grade-point average and a
ticket to Stanford.
Tunney explains that these work
habits followed him into the weight
room and onto the football field at Stan
ford. Only a redshirt sophomore, the
235-pounder has developed the nick
name "Butkus" because his ability at
linebacker reminds some of the great
Hall of Famer, Dick Butkus.
With explosive power and 4.62 speed
in the 40-yard dash, Tunney has estab
lished himself as an impact player in
the Pacific 10 Conference. He watches
films and works hard in practice to
improve himself. Tunney has the coach
ing staff looking for great things in his
remaining two years at Stanford.
Tunney has experienced even greater

success in power-lifting. He has been
an age-group national champion twice
and was the Western United States
champion last year in the all-around
competition. As on the field, Tunney's
work habits have served him well in
the weight room. "If we're going to the
beach in the afternoon, he'll go in and
lift for four hours in the morning," says
teammate Chris Hawkins.
"But you wouldn't think he's a hard
worker if you met him," continues Haw
kins. Soft-spoken and courteous, Tun
ney is reluctant to mention his
successes. His quiet personality does not
give any hint of his intensity on the field.
Indeed, Tunney's actions off the field
are completely opposite from his
performances on the gridiron. It would
seem that his hard-working habits from
high school did not accompany him to
his college life outside of football and
power-lifting.
He admits to "watching a lot of cable
TV and playing backgammon." As an
economics he gets good grades

Inside linebacker Jono Tunney has been punishing opponents all season.
"(3.0 grade-point average) but does
not study very much.
One activity Tunney does per
form with a passion is eating.
'"Jono eats more spaghetti faster
than anyone I know,"says Es
chelman with complete sincerity.
Tunney says his favorite culinary
delights are sushi and, of course,
spaghetti..
He also eryoys his Corvette con
vertible, his tropical fish and, no,
he does not have a girlfriend. He
likes to play intramurals and
proudly claims to be a member of
the reigning B-league champion
basketball team.
Tunney's attitude on the foot
ball field is a combination of his
two opposite personalities. His
dedication to the team success
cannot be doubted as his primary
goal is to simply "play my ass off
; But, at the same time, Tunney
•still believes that fun is the most
important thing. "If you're not
having fun you shouldn't be out
there," he states. Thankfully for
Cardinal football, Tunney loves
the sport and is still having fun.
But what about this other side
of Jono Tunney? How can a couch
potato be an outstanding football
player? Well, the Stanford coaches
don't care how. And Stanford foot
ball fans sure don't care how. As
long as No. 95 continues to dom
inate opposing offenses they won't
care what he is like off the field.
So just watch "Butkus" playing
Cardinal football and let Jono
Tunney be "Meathead" off the
field. He has every right.

Inside linebacker Jono Tunney has been punishing opponents all season.
"(3.0 grade-point average) but does
not study very much.
One activity Tunney does per
form with a passion is eating.
'"Jono eats more spaghetti faster
than anyone I know,"says Es
chelman with complete sincerity.
Tunney says his favorite culinary
delights are sushi and, of course,
spaghetti..
He also eryoys his Corvette con
vertible, his tropical fish and, no,
he does not have a girlfriend. He
likes to play intramurals and
proudly claims to be a member of
the reigning B-league champion
basketball team.
Tunney's attitude on the foot
ball field is a combination of his
two opposite personalities. His
dedication to the team success
cannot be doubted as his primary
goal is to simply "play my ass off
; But, at the same time, Tunney
•still believes that fun is the most
important thing. "If you're not
having fun you shouldn't be out
there," he states. Thankfully for
Cardinal football, Tunney loves
the sport and is still having fun.
But what about this other side
of Jono Tunney? How can a couch
potato be an outstanding football
player? Well, the Stanford coaches
don't care how. And Stanford foot
ball fans sure don't care how. As
long as No. 95 continues to dom
inate opposing offenses they won't
care what he is like off the field.
So just watch "Butkus" playing
Cardinal football and let Jono
Tunney be "Meathead" off the
field. He has every right.
There are two sides to Stanford's in
side linebacker Jono Tunney. One is the
hard-working, dedicated athlete that
football fans have seen terrorizing op
posing offenses this year. A national
power-lifting champion, Tunney has
been described by linebacker coach
Larry Kerr as "an extremely hard
worker."
But Jono Tunney has a very different
second side. This is the side that has
earned him the nickname of "Meat
head" from his teammates because of
his resemblance to the character in the
television show "All In the Family."
He's the person who loves to eat and
sleep, who has developed the reputation
of a first-class couch potato.
"If he's not in his bed then he's prob
ably on the couch," explains teammate
and good friend Scott Eschelman.
So what is the reason for this Jekyll
and-Hyde type of personality? Tunney
says it comes from his childhood.
"Before high school I did nothing," he
admits. He says he didn't study, didn't

work and often got into trouble.
But then he enrolled in Bellarmine
High School. An academically tough
private school, Bellarmine forced Tun
ney to get his act together. He developed
hard-working habits and began playing
football as a freshman because it was
something he had always wanted to do.
The hard work paid off. He graduated
with a 3.9 grade-point average and a
ticket to Stanford.
Tunney explains that these work
habits followed him into the weight
room and onto the football field at Stan
ford. Only a redshirt sophomore, the
235-pounder has developed the nick
name "Butkus" because his ability at
linebacker reminds some of the great
Hall of Famer, Dick Butkus.
With explosive power and 4.62 speed
in the 40-yard dash, Tunney has estab
lished himself as an impact player in
the Pacific 10 Conference. He watches
films and works hard in practice to
improve himself. Tunney has the coach
ing staff looking for great things in his
remaining two years at Stanford.
Tunney has experienced even greater

success in power-lifting. He has been
an age-group national champion twice
and was the Western United States
champion last year in the all-around
competition. As on the field, Tunney's
work habits have served him well in
the weight room. "If we're going to the
beach in the afternoon, he'll go in and
lift for four hours in the morning," says
teammate Chris Hawkins.
"But you wouldn't think he's a hard
worker if you met him," continues Haw
kins. Soft-spoken and courteous, Tun
ney is reluctant to mention his
successes. His quiet personality does not
give any hint of his intensity on the field.
Indeed, Tunney's actions off the field
are completely opposite from his
performances on the gridiron. It would
seem that his hard-working habits from
high school did not accompany him to
his college life outside of football and
power-lifting.
He admits to "watching a lot of cable
TV and playing backgammon." As an
economics he gets good grades
