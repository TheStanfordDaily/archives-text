Ice Hockey
The Stanford ice hockey club
opened its 1988-89 Pacific Col
legiate Hockey Association
season Saturday at Berkeley
Iceland with an exciting 3-2 vic
tory over California. Cal rallied
from a 3-0 deficit and pulled its
goaltender in favor of a sixth
attacker during the final minute
of play, but could not penetrate
the Stanford defense.
Stanford struck first with a
goal by sophomore Wendell
Bruckner late in the first period
after a pass from sophomore
Stephane Cote. Three minutes
into the second period, Tim Wes
tergren, Stanford's top scorer
last season, made a nice center
ing pass to freshman Jenko
Hwong, who beat the Cal goalie
for a power-play goal. Team cap
tain David Wright, who also as
sisted on Hwong's goal, scored
an unassisted power-play goal
90 seconds later to put Stanford
ahead by three goals.
At this point, Stanford be
came a little overconfident and
also began to tire. Rather than
giving up, the Bears cut into
Stanford's lead by scoring two

goals in the last five minutes
of the second period. Cal pressed
its attack in the third period in
search of the tying goal but was
stymied by Stanford's vigorous
defense. Goaltender Tony Sal
vadore, playing in his first game
for Stanford, made 11 of his 24
saves in the third period to seal
the victory.
Stanford Coach Ernie Ferrari
was satisfied with the outcome
but plans to put the team
through more conditioning
drills to prevent another let
down in intensity in the second
half of the game. Ferrari pointed
out that it will take a few games
for the new players to adjust to
his system and for linemates to
get used to each other's play.
He expressed optimism about
Stanford's prospects in the
PCHA this season. "We beat a
Cal team with much more depth
than last season's team, which
we dominated five games to
none," he said.
The team will not have the
luxury of savoring Saturday's
win for long. Cal wil attempt to
avenge its defeat tonight at 7:15
p.m. in Stanford's home opener.
Stanford will face UCLA Friday

night at 10:15 p.m., and Fuller
ton State on Saturday and Sun
day at 2:15 p.m. All games will
be played at Golden Gate Arena
on Bay Road in Redwood City.
Running
On Saturday, Oct. 22, the
Stanford running club made a
good showing at the annual 10-
kilometer "Run for the Kids."
The run benefited the Stan
ford University Hospital
pediatrics playroom.
The course through Atherton
was fast, and many of the run
ners set personal records. David
Mitzi, Dan Fernandez, and John
Hornbrook placed fourth, eighth
and 12th, respectively in the
men's open with times of 32:08,
32:43 and 33:32. â€¢
Even after making a wrong
turn, Mitzi captured second in
his age group.
Laura Dyer won her age
group with a time of 44:55.
Marissa Schwartz ran the
course in 39:17, taking fourth
in her age group.
The team is off to a great
start and is looking forward to
a successful year.
