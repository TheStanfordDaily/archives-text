In Monday's Daily, it was in
correctly reported that Prof. Syd
ney Drell was an arms control
adviser to the Reagan administra
tion. Rather, he has been an ad
viser to Congress during the
Reagan administration. Also,
Prof. Linus Pauling won his Nobel
prize for Peace in 1962, not 1960.
Yesterday, The Daily misiden
tified photos of Prof. Tom Camp
bell and his 12th congressional
district opponent Anna Eshoo.
