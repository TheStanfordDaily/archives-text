# Blackout delays tallying

SACRAMENTO (AP) - A
power failure at an Oakland poll
ing place and a subsequent Demo
cratic protest delayed the release
of election-night voting results
across California for an hour.
The blackout, located outside a
schoolyard precinct, lasted only
about an hour yesterday evening,
and poll workers shined their
headlights on the school walkway
to help voters into the building,
where the lights were working.
But with voters still jammed up
at the school, Superior Court
Judge John Sutter issued an order
keeping the polling place open two
hours after the statewide 8 p.m.
closing time.
Local Democratic officials com
plained to Alameda County about
the delay, which sent a County
lawyer to court.
This protest led Secretary of
State March Fong Eu to invoke a

state law saying no vote totals
can be made public on any race
until all polls for that race have
closed. It meant that no California
returns on statewide races —
president, U.S. Senate or state bal
lot propositions — could be re
leased until the Oakland precinct
closed.
Counties were free to tabulate
and release totals on legislative
and congressional races, as well
as local ballot measures, Eu said.
But she added the state could not
reprogram its computers to sep
arate out and release only those
results.
With local returns pouring into
the secretary of state's comput
ers, Eu asked Sutter to shorten
his order, and Alameda County
Democrats did not object. The
judge allowed the Oakland
precinct to close shortly before 9
p.m., and the vote totals were re
leased.
