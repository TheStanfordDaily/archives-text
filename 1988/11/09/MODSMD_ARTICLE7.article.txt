# Stench may soon disappear from White Plaza
## 
### Tim Hullar Staff writer 
The distinctive stench in White
Plaza wafting up from sewers
should soon disappear now that
the Univeristy has rerouted a
street drain located next to Tres
idder Union, a Stanford Water De
partment official predicted yester
day.
The accumulation of decompos
ing food wastes into the sewage
system under White Plaza has
been the chief cause of the stench,
said Cheryl Jensen, manager of
Stanford's Water Department.
There has been some specula
tion that food dumped into the
street drain next to the Tresidder

loading dock has caused much of
the accumulation. The drain is
located near Tresidder's food
loading dock that is hosed down
into the street twice daily.
Until now, wastes have flowed
through the drain at Tresidder
into storm sewers. Yesterday, the
University linked the drain to a
more tightly-sealed sanitary
sewer system so that food will
flow into it — rather than into
storm sewers, Jensen said.
"I'm pretty sure this will take
care of the problem," she said.
Storm sewers are designed to
carry rainwater only, while sani
tary sewers channel food and
human wastes along with rain
water.

According to Jensen, there is
no evidence indicating that the
sanitary sewers are contributing
to the odor problem.
But Jensen could not pinpoint
exactly who has been dumping the
food into the sewage system.
"It's hard to say who does the
dumping," she said. "We've found
cans, cups, Big Mac containers,
all kinds of stuff that have no
right being there."
According to Greg Mount, gen
eral manager of Tresidder Food
Services, the dumpster-size trash
compacter behind Tresidder has
leaked into the storm sewer in
the past but was recently fixed.
"When you produce the amount
of food we do here, you're always

going to get a little food into the
system," Mount said.
He added that among his staff
"there's an awareness that an
odor has been causing problems.
Food [waste] is being sealed
tightly and bagged in plastic."
Jensen said the smell this year
may be worse than in the past
because water conservation meas
ures on campus have reduced the
amount of water available to flush
wastes through the sewer system.
She said more than 14,000 gal
lons of water were flushed
through the storm sewer in early
October to get rid of accumulated
food wastes, but since then, the
odor has persisted.
