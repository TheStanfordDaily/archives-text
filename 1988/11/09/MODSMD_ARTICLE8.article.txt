# Majority of faculty supports bringing back 'F'
## 
### Elaine Riggs Staff writer 
Disconsolate students filing back from their
midterms these days can comfort each other
with the familiar thought: "Oh well, I can't
flunk the class."
For now.
Two-thirds of the 404 faculty members res
ponding to a campus survey last spring said
they would like to see the return of the "F"
grade.
The "F" was abolished from the University
grading system in 1969.
The University Committee on Academic Ap
praisal and Achievement, which conducted the
survey, found the result "startling."
The committee plans to present the survey
for discussion at the Faculty Senate meeting
tomorrow.

The committee did not take an official po
sition in its report.
However, the committee did report that the
return of the "F" grade "would unfortunately,
and perhaps dangerously, 'moralize' the prac
tice of grading; it would create a 'scarlet letter'
within the grading system."
The individual committee members ex
pressed a variety of views toward the "F"
grade.
Chemical Engineering Prof. Gerald Fuller,
a committee member, said he favors bringing
back the "F" grade.
"If a student has to take a course more
than once to achieve a grade that was accept
able ... that's important information for a
prospective employer," Fuller said.
He added that the possibility of receiving
an "F" would make students take their courses
more seriously.

Senior Michael Tran, also a committee mem
ber, disagreed, saying that even if the "F"
were reintroduced, the possibility of receiving
a failing grade would be very low.
"The absence of the 'F' is pretty much
psychological anyways ... it's just nice to know
you can't get it," Tran said.
Tran said he originally favored the "F"
grade because he was worried that graduate
schools "weren't taking Stanford grades
seriously."
However, Tran said he now believes that
graduate schools "know there is no more grade
inflation here than at any other school."
The popular notion that Stanford suffers
from "acute grade inflation" does not correlate
with the committee's study of grade distribu
tion fluctuations from the 1975 to the 1986
academic year.
