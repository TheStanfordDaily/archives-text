For Johnie Spain the initia
tives on yesterday's ballot were
more than just numbers.
Spain had personal reasons
for seeing Propositions 80 and
86 defeated.
The two bond initiatives
would provide money to build
new prisons, but after spending
21 years in California state
prisons for murder Spain said
the prisons now are "more dan
gerous than handguns."
"They condition any good
things out of [the prisoners].
The people in there become
time bombs," Spain told stu
dents in Madera lounge Mon
day night.
Having been released in
March this year, Spain said he
sees himself as "an expert on
prisons, though I don't say it
proudly."
Along with Cathy Kornblith,
a private investigator who
worked on Spain's case, Spain
is teaching SWOPSI 104, "So
ciety Behind Bars."
Through this class and other
speaking engagements around
campus, Spain hopes to add an
other dimension to students'
perspectives of the justice sys
tem and the state of prisons
in particular.
Kornblith added, "We
wanted to make the students

think, not force them to hold
a certain view."
According to senior Scott
Brawn, a student in the class,
several different guest speakers
have already enlightened him.
"We've been exposed to a lot
of figures and heard both vic
tims and criminals speak. My
views have really matured as
a result," Brawn said.
According to Spain, in 1978
official California prison policy
changed from rehabilitation to
punishment, creating enor
mous problems for those enter
ing the system.
Figures suggest that 90 to
95 percent of those entering the
system will eventually be re
leased, he said.
"They are released with $200
and are conditioned while in
there to have no responsibility.
They are given no meaningful
educational opportunities and
no vocational responsibilities.
They just can't be expected to
survive," Spain said.
Spain, who was on call 24
hours a day in prison as an
electrician, took all the college
courses offered to prisoners in
California.
"There are a lot of opportu
nities in prisons, but people
don't actively pursue them. I
had to forge papers to take all
the classes I wanted to," Spain
said.
