find Finnigan's systems in more than 80% of all
commercial labs that perform research and
analysis in the areas of environmental, life and
forensic sciences.
Today, we continue to develop new and innova
tive applications for our current products, along

ing market base. And, we're looking for the best
and the brightest, most imaginative talent —
creative individuals who rise above the crowd
with their enthusiasm and ideas

degree in Computer Science, Electrical, Mechanical
or Industrial Engineering, and seek the professional
challenge of being a key contributor to Finnigan's
continuing high achievements, we invite you to
sign up for an interview Discover the Finnigan
MAT advantage: excellent products, dedicated
training and unequaled customer support.
