# Swastikas upset students
## University improves response time to offensive graffiti 
### Laura Jacobson Senior staff writer 
It took 10 minutes yesterday
for a University worker to re
spond to a report of a year-old
swastika in Lambda Nu and paint
over it — a marked contrast to
the two weeks it took the Univer
sity to react to a report last month
of a swastika on an East Lagunita
basement wall that had also gone
unchecked for over a year.
Yesterday's prompt action is a
result of community pressure on
the Housing Facilities Office to
respond immediately to com
plaints of offensive graffiti. In
recent weeks students have grown
angry and frustrated with
Housing Facilities because of its
seeming lack of concern about the
East Lagunita swastika.
In addition, students are dis
mayed that such a frightening
symbol could remain visible for
so long in common areas on

campus.
"It's disgraceful that Stanford
students can walk by these, and
other offensive graffiti, and not
take any action," said junior Jes
sica Mahlab.
The University delayed two
weeks before it painted over the
East Lagunita swastika, which
Mahlab reported to Housing Fa
cilities on Oct. 6. It was not
painted over by the end of the
week and, when Mahlab reported
again, she was told that Facilities
Manager Rich Lang would per
sonally paint over the swastika.
When the swastika remained
unpainted the following Friday,
Oct. 14, an assistant in Lang's
office offered Mahlab a bucket of
paint and told her she could paint
it over herself, Mahlab said.
But the paint was not delivered
to Mahlab by the following Wed
nesday, Oct. 19, and Mahlab told
her resident assistant, Kim Cole
man. The next day Coleman asked

Lang to paint over the swastika
by noon.
"I just forgot to paint it — it
wasn't an intentional delay," Lang
told The Daily yesterday."I had
the paint and the brushes avail
able and I told her (Coleman) that
if the student wanted to do it right
now, she could," Lang said.
Coleman then called Lynn
Glick, Lang's boss, who asked that
the swastika be painted over im
mediately. It was finally covered
two days later.
The delay outraged several stu
dents, and since then the Univer
sity has tightened its policy to
repond to racially offensive graf
fiti.
Student Housing Manager
Suzanne Tamiesie said managers
and assistant managers in
Housing Facilities have been
trained in the appropriate re
sponse to offensive graffiti.

appeared Nov. 19, 1987.
Not only must such graffiti be
painted over immediately,
Tamiesie said, but a photo must
be taken. The photo will allow
facilities to "share with (the Of
fice of) Residential Education
what has occured and to find pat
terns and evidence of where
things happen," Tamiesie added.
When Mahleb reported the
Lambda Nu swastika to Housing
Facilities at 3:45 p.m. yesterday,
it took only minutes for a Facil
ities worker to arrive with
paintbucket in hand. He
photographed and painted over
the graffiti by 3:55 p.m.
Mahlab said the University's
prompt response to the swastika
in Lambda Nu was "very positive
and commendable."
The two graffiti incidents have
sparked grave concern among
Jewish students here, who only
last week were shocked to find
fliers distributed on campus by
an anti-Semitic political action
committee.
"The swastika is a painful and
a scary symbol," said senior Susan
Buseck, a Jewish student. "The
Nazis killed an entire branch of
my family. They caused a massive
disruption of Jewish people's lives
and their culture, she said.
The swastika in the Lagunita
basement had been there for more
than a year, residents said.
The Lambda Nu swastika and
«the words "white power" were
scrawled on a third-floor bath
room door there after the annual
Big Game Bonfire last November,

according to house residents.
White supremists calling them
selves "Skinheads" and "members
of the white master race" al
legedly defaced the door, said
senior Thorn Hayes, a third-year
Lambda Nu resident.
Lambda Nu is located near the
Lagunita lakebed where the Bon
fire celebration is held.
"It wasn't anyone from the
house — it was random," another
resident, Daniella Evans, said.
"We all knew it (the swastika)
was there," she said.
Evans, a senior, said she told
Lamda Nu house manager Mi
chael Furlong about the swastika
last year. The University said the
swastika was not reported, and
Furlong, who has graduated,
could not be reached yesterday.
Responding, Director of
Housing Keith Guy said, "I find
it difficult to believe that if it
were officially reported that there
was not an immediate response."
"It concerns me," Guy added,
because the swastika was "rela
tively old, not new stuff."
Not everyone in the house knew
of the swastika because the coed
bathroom is on the third floor
and serves eight residents, said
Lambda Nu RA Matt Schwartz.
Schwartz said he was told about
the swastika yesterday."The Uni
versity should have removed it at
the end of last year," he said.
"People this year attempted to
cover it over with pen ... but
they did not try very hard,"
Schwartz said. He added that last
spring residents covered the swas
tika with artificial snow spray, but
he thought a cleaning crew
washed off the paint at the end
of last year.

Project Custodian Jeff Hines applies paint to the swastika in Lamda Nu. The swastika originally
appeared Nov. 19, 1987.
Not only must such graffiti be
painted over immediately,
Tamiesie said, but a photo must
be taken. The photo will allow
facilities to "share with (the Of
fice of) Residential Education
what has occured and to find pat
terns and evidence of where
things happen," Tamiesie added.
When Mahleb reported the
Lambda Nu swastika to Housing
Facilities at 3:45 p.m. yesterday,
it took only minutes for a Facil
ities worker to arrive with
paintbucket in hand. He
photographed and painted over
the graffiti by 3:55 p.m.
Mahlab said the University's
prompt response to the swastika
in Lambda Nu was "very positive
and commendable."
The two graffiti incidents have
sparked grave concern among
Jewish students here, who only
last week were shocked to find
fliers distributed on campus by
an anti-Semitic political action
committee.
"The swastika is a painful and
a scary symbol," said senior Susan
Buseck, a Jewish student. "The
Nazis killed an entire branch of
my family. They caused a massive
disruption of Jewish people's lives
and their culture, she said.
The swastika in the Lagunita
basement had been there for more
than a year, residents said.
The Lambda Nu swastika and
«the words "white power" were
scrawled on a third-floor bath
room door there after the annual
Big Game Bonfire last November,

according to house residents.
White supremists calling them
selves "Skinheads" and "members
of the white master race" al
legedly defaced the door, said
senior Thorn Hayes, a third-year
Lambda Nu resident.
Lambda Nu is located near the
Lagunita lakebed where the Bon
fire celebration is held.
"It wasn't anyone from the
house — it was random," another
resident, Daniella Evans, said.
"We all knew it (the swastika)
was there," she said.
Evans, a senior, said she told
Lamda Nu house manager Mi
chael Furlong about the swastika
last year. The University said the
swastika was not reported, and
Furlong, who has graduated,
could not be reached yesterday.
Responding, Director of
Housing Keith Guy said, "I find
it difficult to believe that if it
were officially reported that there
was not an immediate response."
"It concerns me," Guy added,
because the swastika was "rela
tively old, not new stuff."
Not everyone in the house knew
of the swastika because the coed
bathroom is on the third floor
and serves eight residents, said
Lambda Nu RA Matt Schwartz.
Schwartz said he was told about
the swastika yesterday."The Uni
versity should have removed it at
the end of last year," he said.
"People this year attempted to
cover it over with pen ... but
they did not try very hard,"
Schwartz said. He added that last
spring residents covered the swas
tika with artificial snow spray, but
he thought a cleaning crew
washed off the paint at the end
of last year.
It took 10 minutes yesterday
for a University worker to re
spond to a report of a year-old
swastika in Lambda Nu and paint
over it — a marked contrast to
the two weeks it took the Univer
sity to react to a report last month
of a swastika on an East Lagunita
basement wall that had also gone
unchecked for over a year.
Yesterday's prompt action is a
result of community pressure on
the Housing Facilities Office to
respond immediately to com
plaints of offensive graffiti. In
recent weeks students have grown
angry and frustrated with
Housing Facilities because of its
seeming lack of concern about the
East Lagunita swastika.
In addition, students are dis
mayed that such a frightening
symbol could remain visible for
so long in common areas on

campus.
"It's disgraceful that Stanford
students can walk by these, and
other offensive graffiti, and not
take any action," said junior Jes
sica Mahlab.
The University delayed two
weeks before it painted over the
East Lagunita swastika, which
Mahlab reported to Housing Fa
cilities on Oct. 6. It was not
painted over by the end of the
week and, when Mahlab reported
again, she was told that Facilities
Manager Rich Lang would per
sonally paint over the swastika.
When the swastika remained
unpainted the following Friday,
Oct. 14, an assistant in Lang's
office offered Mahlab a bucket of
paint and told her she could paint
it over herself, Mahlab said.
But the paint was not delivered
to Mahlab by the following Wed
nesday, Oct. 19, and Mahlab told
her resident assistant, Kim Cole
man. The next day Coleman asked

Lang to paint over the swastika
by noon.
"I just forgot to paint it — it
wasn't an intentional delay," Lang
told The Daily yesterday."I had
the paint and the brushes avail
able and I told her (Coleman) that
if the student wanted to do it right
now, she could," Lang said.
Coleman then called Lynn
Glick, Lang's boss, who asked that
the swastika be painted over im
mediately. It was finally covered
two days later.
The delay outraged several stu
dents, and since then the Univer
sity has tightened its policy to
repond to racially offensive graf
fiti.
