# Swastikas upset students
## University improves response time to offensive graffiti 
### Laura Jacobson Senior staff writer 
It took 10 minutes yesterday
for a University worker to re
spond to a report of a year-old
swastika in Lambda Nu and paint
over it — a marked contrast to
the two weeks it took the Univer
sity to react to a report last month
of a swastika on an East Lagunita
basement wall that had also gone
unchecked for over a year.
Yesterday's prompt action is a
result of community pressure on
the Housing Facilities Office to
respond immediately to com
plaints of offensive graffiti. In
recent weeks students have grown
angry and frustrated with
Housing Facilities because of its
seeming lack of concern about the
East Lagunita swastika.
In addition, students are dis
mayed that such a frightening
symbol could remain visible for
so long in common areas on

campus.
"It's disgraceful that Stanford
students can walk by these, and
other offensive graffiti, and not
take any action," said junior Jes
sica Mahlab.
The University delayed two
weeks before it painted over the
East Lagunita swastika, which
Mahlab reported to Housing Fa
cilities on Oct. 6. It was not
painted over by the end of the
week and, when Mahlab reported
again, she was told that Facilities
Manager Rich Lang would per
sonally paint over the swastika.
When the swastika remained
unpainted the following Friday,
Oct. 14, an assistant in Lang's
office offered Mahlab a bucket of
paint and told her she could paint
it over herself, Mahlab said.
But the paint was not delivered
to Mahlab by the following Wed
nesday, Oct. 19, and Mahlab told
her resident assistant, Kim Cole
man. The next day Coleman asked

Lang to paint over the swastika
by noon.
"I just forgot to paint it — it
wasn't an intentional delay," Lang
told The Daily yesterday."I had
the paint and the brushes avail
able and I told her (Coleman) that
if the student wanted to do it right
now, she could," Lang said.
Coleman then called Lynn
Glick, Lang's boss, who asked that
the swastika be painted over im
mediately. It was finally covered
two days later.
The delay outraged several stu
dents, and since then the Univer
sity has tightened its policy to
repond to racially offensive graf
fiti.
Student Housing Manager
Suzanne Tamiesie said managers
and assistant managers in
Housing Facilities have been
trained in the appropriate re
sponse to offensive graffiti.
