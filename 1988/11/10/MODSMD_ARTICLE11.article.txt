# Stanford Republicans celebrate victory

### Lisa Lawrence 
"Pop!" went the champagne cork and "Hooray!" went Stanford's
few but proud College Republicans yesterday during a noontime rally
held in White Plaza to honor President-elect George Bush.
Eight elated students sang the national anthem and shouted out
election statistics to contrast the results of Stanford's mock election
in which Dukakis won with an overwhelming majority.
In addition, the Republicans poked fun at The Daily, which endorsed
only Democratic candidates, saying in the "real world" the Republicans
were endorsed by the American people.
Jennifer Bryson, chair of the Stanford College Republicans, said
she thought it was "nice to have a victory." Walter Mondale received
71 percent of the Stanford vote in the 1984 national election, and in
a mock election this year Stanford students favored Dukakis by 69.2
percent. In both cases, the nation favored the Republican candidates.
Bryson said she had been hoping that although most Stanford
students voted for Dukakis, Bush would win the presidency.
Bryson and her fellow College Republicans, wearing "Stanford Re
publicans — The best party on campus" T-shirts, obviously got their
wish despite phone calls received by Bryson on election night from
optimistic Democrats convinced of Michael Dukakis' victory.
The crowd at the Republican victory rally was small, but the College
Republicans have about 300 members, and most Republicans on
campus are not members of the group.
Despite the common view that Democrats vastly outnumber Re
publicans among Stanford students, College Republican Scott Scharpen
said the rally was "not as an attempt to anger anyone, but just as
an advertisement for Bush's victory."
Some Democrats walked by with looks of disgust as the College
Republicans sold T-shirts, gave out "Bush '88" signs, and cups of
champagne. One passerby shouted that because Bush won, "We are
all losers!"
But as one friendly passerby said, the College Republicans are
happy. "They're being a happy minority in a Democratic mass."
College Republican Bill Candelaria found it "interesting that the
Bush victory was from such a cross section of America."
