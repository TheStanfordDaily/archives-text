# Democrats get out vote
## 
### Robert Landon Staff writer 
Despite significant Democratic losses last night,
the Stanford College Democrats celebrated a heavy
voter turnout of campus Democrats.
More than 90 percent of 3,200 students living on
campus who supported Michael Dukakis cast their
vote yesterday, according to Steve Pich6, the precinct
organizer for Stanford and a graduate student in
electrical engineering. In order to determine Dukakis
supporters, volunteers polled every residence on
campus, he said.
Based on voter lists posted at each polling place,
more than 250 volunteers were able to determine
which registered Democrats had not yet voted and
contacted them throughout the day.
The Stanford College Republicans also worked
yesterday to get their supporters to vote, according
to Jennifer Bryson, chair of the Stanford College
Republicans. Their efforts, however, focused pre
dominantly on getting off-campus Republicans to
the polls by calling registered Republicans, posting
signs and assisting elderly voters to the polls.
Yesterday was the culmination of the Stanford
Democrat's Get Out the Vote project, a quarter-long
effort to gain support for Dukakis, as well as Demo
cratic senatorial candidate Leo McCarthy and con
gressional candidate Anna Eshoo.
"Thousands and thousands of man-hours have
gone into the effort," said undergraduate Joshua
Lipp, a volunteer coordinator for the Stanford Dem
ocrats.
