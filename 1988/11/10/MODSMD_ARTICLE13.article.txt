# New directories hit campus
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
Have you lost touch with your friends
from last year's dorm? Are you looking
to get involved in a campus activity?
Have you forgotten when Meyer Library
closes?
Today's distribution of this year's
Stanford Student Directory should solve
most of your problems. The directory,
which includes a comprehensive listing
of student phone numbers and ad
dresses, yellow pages listings, a Univer
sity service guide and valuable coupons,
is now available free for all students,
faculty and staff.
Resident assistants will distribute the
phone books to all undergraduates living
on campus. Off-campus undergraduates
will receive a postcard that they may
exchange for a directory at the Student
Organization Services office on the sec
ond floor of Tresidder Union. Graduate
students, faculty and staff can pick di
rectories up in their department's office.
The directory, completely supported
by advertisement revenues, is the annual
six-month project of an 11-student staff
that includes a project manager, two
editors, an advertising manager and
seven sales representatives. Printing
costs for this year ran about $50,000,
according to co-editor Morty Posner, a
senior.

This year's directory offers significant
improvements and additions from last
year's, according to Posner. An early
distribution was one of the staff s goals,
and this year the directory will come
out over a week earlier than the previous
directory. Coupon sales have increased
over 25 percent and ad sales are up over
50 percent, according to senior Russell
Korobkin, project manager.
In addition, the first 70 pages include
an improved "University Information
Guide," a comprehensive guide to Uni
versity programs and services â€” from
library hours to laser printing locations.
Posner said his staff took a survey of
students to determine which portions of
last year's information guide were not
used or needed improvement. The staff
also spent much of the summer calling
University offices and staff members
most knowledgeable about the myriad
of services on campus to make the
guide's listing as complete as possible.
Posner also said the recruiter section,
in which businesses advertise available
jobs, has been significantly expanded
through a greater sales effort by the
directory's staff.
The directory also contains two new
sections: a student involvement guide
offering 25 pages of information on how
to get involved in University activities
and a 16-page section detailing enter
tainment and attractions.
