## Reagan lauds Bush win President-elect names Baker as Sec. of State pick 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - George
Bush and Dan Quayle, America's
new White House team come Jan
uary, were reunited yesterday at
a star-spangled airport reception,
then were told by President
Reagan that their victory means
"our achievements are secure."
Reagan, in an emotional salute
to his Republican successor,
declared that "to those who some
times flatter me with talk of a
Reagan revolution, today, my hope
is this: 'You ain't seen nothin'
yet."'
Bush earlier had revealed that
he planned wholesale replace
ments of Reagan's government ap
pointees, starting with James A.
Baker 111, his campaign chairman,
as the new secretary of state. But
that "has nothing to do with sat
isfaction or dissatisfaction with
the way anybody currently is
doing his job," Bush said. "It has
a lot to do with reinvorating the
process."
The president-elect, addressing
a cheering crowd at Andrews Air
Force Base upon his return to
Washington, extended a con

ciliatory hand to Congress and
also vowed to build on Reagan's
openings with the Soviet Union.
He disclosed he had received a
congratulatory message from So
viet General Secretary Mikhail
Gorbachev and had returned an
equally warm reply through the
Soviet ambassador in hopes that
"we can keep this new bilateral
relationship moving ahead."
At the White House, Reagan
told Bush and Quayle: "How
proud I am, of both of you, for
the extraordinary grit and char
acter you've shown . . . With
George Bush and Dan Quayle, I
feel our achievements are secure."
Bush replied that "all I will say
in the shadow of the office that
you've ennobled is that we're very,
very grateful ... to you and
Nancy for going that extra mile.
I really believe the results would
have been entirely different if we
hadn't had that steadfast cam
paign support."
"And I know they would, if I
hadn't learned from a giant," said
Bush.

With more than 5,000 people
packed into a hangar at the air
base in suburban Maryland —
and another 3,000 to 4,000 out
side — a band struck up "Hail to
the Chief' as the nose of Air Force
Two, a Boeing 707, poked into the
open end of the hangar.
As the invited guests on the
military base roared with cheers,
first Bush and then his wife, Bar
bara, emerged at the top of the
stairs. They were followed imme
diately by Quayle and his wife,
Marilyn, who had been picked up
on the tarmac for delivery to their
admirers.
It was Bush's first meeting with
Quayle since the pair, in separate
cities, watched as America's
voters gave them an overwhelm
ing victory Tuesday against their
Democratic opponents, Michael
Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen.
Bush said he hopes that
America's adversaries "do not in
dulge in any hopes that our
resolve will be weakened because
we will continue to be strong and
we will pay the price for it."
