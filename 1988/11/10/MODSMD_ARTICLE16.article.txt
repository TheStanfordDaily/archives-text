# Kristallnacht remembered

FRANKFURT, West Germany
(AP) â€” Children of victims will
preserve the memory of the orgy
of genocide launched 50 years ago
with a night of horror the Nazis
called Kristallnacht, a Jewish
leader said yesterday.
Heinz Galinski, leader of West

Germany's 32,000 Jews, later
went to a ceremony in East Ger
many, whose Jewish population is
only 450-600. He urged East and
West Germany to make the anni
versary a joint day of remem
berance of the Nazi past.
Some Jews objected to Chan

cellor Helmut Kohl's presence in
the Frankfurt synagogue where
Galinksi spoke, and he was
heckled from the balcony. They
cite his 1985 visit with President
Reagan to the Bitburg cemetery
where 49 Nazi SS officers are
buried, and an alleged insensitiv
ity U) Jewish concerns.
On Tuesday, someone spray
painted swastikas and pro-Nazi
slogans on a synagogue in the
Bavarian village of Binswangen,
police reported.
Adolf Hitler sent gangs of Nazi
thugs into the streets the night
of Nov. 9-10, 1938. They killed
scores of Jews, burned hundreds
of synagogues, ransacked 7,500
Jewish businesses, destroyed
thousands of Jewish homes and
rounded up 30,000 Jews for ship
ment to concentration camps.
A similar rampage occurred in
Austria, Hitler's homeland, which
he had annexed to the Third Reich
eight months earlier. About
200,000 Jews lived in Austria
then. There are 7,000 now.
Shattered glass covered the
streets after the terrible night and
the Nazis, in a boastful mood,
named it Kristallnacht, which in
English is Crystal Night.
"The responsibility cannot be
divided," said Galinski, a 75-year
old survivor of the Auschwitz
death camp. "Specifically, it is the
joint responsibility of both Ger
man nations for the past they
have in common."
In Vienna, the Austrian parlia
ment observed a minute of silence
for the victims.
