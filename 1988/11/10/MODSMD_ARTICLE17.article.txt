MANILA, Philippines (AP) â€”
The death toll from Typhoon Skip
soared to 129 yesterday, bringing
to nearly 600 the number of
people killed in three storms that
pounded the Philippines in the
past two weeks.
The toll included 39 deaths re
ported yesterday and government
officials said tens of thousands of
people remained homeless. Au
thorities said they expected the
toll to rise as communications are
restored to stricken areas.
The government weather serv
ice downgraded Skip to a tropical
storm yesterday as it moved far
ther into the South China Sea
toward Vietnam. A weather bul
letin said the storm's top winds

had weakened to 69 mph.
The government's Office of
Civil Defense said the latest
deaths reported were from the is
land of Tablas, which was in the
path of Skip as it hammered the
central Philippines Monday and
Tuesday with heavy rains and
winds up to 110 mph.
Nick Garcia, a civil defense
spokesman, said a fatality report
received via military radio from
Tablas did not say how the 39
died. The report said all roads on
the island, 160 miles south of
Manila, were impassable, Garcia
added.
Earlier, reports from the civil
defense office and the Philippine

Red Cross indicated that the hard
est hit area was Palawan island,
where 36 people were killed in
widespread flooding. At least 70
others were reported missing on
the island.
Also hard hit was Camarines
Sur province on southeastern
Luzon, where landslides and tor
nadoes killed 26 people, including
20 in an avalanche that hit
Pasacao, a community 160 miles
southeast of Manila. Thirteen
other people were listed as miss
ing in that avalanche, they said.
At least 13 people drowned in
three Manila suburbs flooded by
the rain-swollen lake Laguna de
Bay, officials said.
