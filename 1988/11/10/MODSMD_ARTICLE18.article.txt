3 states pass English-only bills
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - The official Eng
lish message that Florida, Colorado and Arizona
voters wrote on Election Day will be carried to
Congress, the head of U.S. English promised
yesterday.
"There's no question that the victories of
Florida and Colorado — and even the one in
Arizona — were just stunning," Stanley Diamond,
the acting chairman of U.S. English, said.
"They're just smashing victories for us."
Voters in Florida, the country's fourth-largest
state, approved Amendment 11 by an 84-16 per
cent margin. The amendment changes the state
constitution to make English the state's official
language and authorizes the Legislature to write
laws enforcing that status.
The victory was decried by Arthur Kropp, pres
ident of People for the American Way, a
Washington-based lobby describing itself as
a"constitutional liberties organization."
"Amendment 11 's victory will help the English

only movement achieve its hidden agenda: rights
for some citizens, not all," Kropp said.
Leaders of Polish strike lose jobs
GDANSK, Poland (AP) — Leaders of a one-day
strike were fired yesterday for organizing the
walkout to protest a government decision to close
Lenin Shipyard, the birthplace of Solidarity, state
media reported.
The announcement came hours after strikers
at two shipyards ended their protests at the
request of Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, who
argued that there was "no other path than rec
onciliation."
The state-run PAP news agency said the di
rector of the Repair Shipyard in Gdansk "sacked
the inspirators of the strike action" at the 4,500-
worker yard.
It did not mention firings at the other yard
that was struck, the 1,000-worker Wisla
Shipyard.
