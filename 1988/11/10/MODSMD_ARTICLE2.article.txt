# TAs charge cutbacks hurt students

Charging that teaching assis
tant budget cuts will undermine
the quality of a Stanford educa
tion, Humanities and Sciences
TAs said they cannot lead effec
tive sections if they are over
crowded.
"The quality of undergraduate
education will decline preci
pitously if sections are increased
.. . to 35 people," warned Linda
Drucker, a teaching assistant for
Political Science 1.
In July, the School of Human
ities and Sciences announced a
cut in TA funding for each of its
departments ranging from six to
14 percent. This fall quarter, Hu
manities and Sciences reformed
its TA budget to equate TA fund

ing with enrollment in each of the
school's departments. The amount
alloted allows for sections that
will have an average of 30 to 35
students, according to Humanities
and Sciences financial official
Nancy Padgett.
Padgett said this year's TA
budget is $3.3 million — $50,000
less than last year's total TA ex
penses.
In the past, TA funding has
annually increased by at least 6
percent. And this year, Humani
ties and Sciences departments an
ticipated a similar rise. Instead,
the new budget is $250,000 less
than the $3.55 million the depart
ments expected.
Defending the increase in sec
tion sizes, Padgett said it is "a
trade-off between tuition costs
and class sizes." Faculty is the

most important priority and is the
place where the money should go
first, she said.
TAs in many Humanities and
Sciences departments expressed

concern that
larger sections
will impede their
ability to teach
and lead discus
sions.
"Thirty-five
students in a sec
tion will defeat
the purpose of
having TAs," said

former TA Brian Pearce, a law
student. "The whole purpose of a
TA is to give students something
else than they get with their pro
fessor. . . . The best sections I've
had have been around 12."
Drucker said she was worried

that larger sections might also
detract from the more focused at
tention that smaller ones offer.
"If you have 35 people in a sec
tion, people won't do the reading
because they will know they can
get away with it," Drucker said.
Sophomore Pete Hopkins — a
student in Political Science 35 —
agreed, "(In such a large section)
not much would be covered, and
it would be kind of chaotic."
Padgett stressed that the 30 to
35 section enrollment figures were
averages, noting that small dis
cussion sections in English, West
ern Culture and language classes
would be balanced by large prob
lem set review sections in depart
ments such as economics.
