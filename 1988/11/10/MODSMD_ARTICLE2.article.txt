# TAs charge cutbacks hurt students

Charging that teaching assis
tant budget cuts will undermine
the quality of a Stanford educa
tion, Humanities and Sciences
TAs said they cannot lead effec
tive sections if they are over
crowded.
"The quality of undergraduate
education will decline preci
pitously if sections are increased
.. . to 35 people," warned Linda
Drucker, a teaching assistant for
Political Science 1.
In July, the School of Human
ities and Sciences announced a
cut in TA funding for each of its
departments ranging from six to
14 percent. This fall quarter, Hu
manities and Sciences reformed
its TA budget to equate TA fund

ing with enrollment in each of the
school's departments. The amount
alloted allows for sections that
will have an average of 30 to 35
students, according to Humanities
and Sciences financial official
Nancy Padgett.
Padgett said this year's TA
budget is $3.3 million — $50,000
less than last year's total TA ex
penses.
In the past, TA funding has
annually increased by at least 6
percent. And this year, Humani
ties and Sciences departments an
ticipated a similar rise. Instead,
the new budget is $250,000 less
than the $3.55 million the depart
ments expected.
Defending the increase in sec
tion sizes, Padgett said it is "a
trade-off between tuition costs
and class sizes." Faculty is the

most important priority and is the
place where the money should go
first, she said.
TAs in many Humanities and
Sciences departments expressed

concern that
larger sections
will impede their
ability to teach
and lead discus
sions.
"Thirty-five
students in a sec
tion will defeat
the purpose of
having TAs," said

former TA Brian Pearce, a law
student. "The whole purpose of a
TA is to give students something
else than they get with their pro
fessor. . . . The best sections I've
had have been around 12."
Drucker said she was worried

that larger sections might also
detract from the more focused at
tention that smaller ones offer.
"If you have 35 people in a sec
tion, people won't do the reading
because they will know they can
get away with it," Drucker said.
Sophomore Pete Hopkins — a
student in Political Science 35 —
agreed, "(In such a large section)
not much would be covered, and
it would be kind of chaotic."
Padgett stressed that the 30 to
35 section enrollment figures were
averages, noting that small dis
cussion sections in English, West
ern Culture and language classes
would be balanced by large prob
lem set review sections in depart
ments such as economics.
But Economics TA Coordinator


Padgett
Ann Velenchik objected to larger
economics sections.
"The general feeling among
Economics Department TAs is
that raising section size to 30 to
35 will weaken the contribution
that sections can make in having
students participate in class," she
said.
One department where packed
sections are clearly visible is Asian
Studies. "We have serious prob
lems in Asian languages," admit
ted Padgett.
For example, 170 first-year
Japanese students were jammed
into five sections at the beginning
of the year, according to Asian
Studies administrator Dagmar
Logie.
Since then, another section has
been added and enrollment has
dropped to 150, an average of 25
students per section.
"The question is, are students
dropping out because sections are

too big or are students dropping
out because the language is too
difficult?" Logie said.
TAs said they were also worried
that their salaries will drop as a
result of the budget cutbacks. Ul
timately, they said, cuts in TA
salaries will affect the quality of
education — there will be less
incentive for well-qualified grad
uate students to become TAs.
Some Political Science TAs said
the smaller paychecks they are
receiving this year were caused
by the larger budget cuts.
For example, Drucker said the
Office of Graduate Awards told
her last year that she would be
paid at least $6,500 per quarter
this year. After being hired in
June, she was told over the sum
mer — after Humanities and
Sciences announced the new TA
budget — that the department
was not sure she had a job any
more. When she arrived this fall,
she was able to become a TA. But
now her pay is just $5,200 per
quarter.

by the larger budget cuts.
For example, Drucker said the
Office of Graduate Awards told
her last year that she would be
paid at least $6,500 per quarter
this year. After being hired in
June, she was told over the sum
mer — after Humanities and
Sciences announced the new TA
budget — that the department
was not sure she had a job any
more. When she arrived this fall,
she was able to become a TA. But
now her pay is just $5,200 per
quarter.
Charging that teaching assis
tant budget cuts will undermine
the quality of a Stanford educa
tion, Humanities and Sciences
TAs said they cannot lead effec
tive sections if they are over
crowded.
"The quality of undergraduate
education will decline preci
pitously if sections are increased
.. . to 35 people," warned Linda
Drucker, a teaching assistant for
Political Science 1.
In July, the School of Human
ities and Sciences announced a
cut in TA funding for each of its
departments ranging from six to
14 percent. This fall quarter, Hu
manities and Sciences reformed
its TA budget to equate TA fund

ing with enrollment in each of the
school's departments. The amount
alloted allows for sections that
will have an average of 30 to 35
students, according to Humanities
and Sciences financial official
Nancy Padgett.
Padgett said this year's TA
budget is $3.3 million — $50,000
less than last year's total TA ex
penses.
In the past, TA funding has
annually increased by at least 6
percent. And this year, Humani
ties and Sciences departments an
ticipated a similar rise. Instead,
the new budget is $250,000 less
than the $3.55 million the depart
ments expected.
Defending the increase in sec
tion sizes, Padgett said it is "a
trade-off between tuition costs
and class sizes." Faculty is the

most important priority and is the
place where the money should go
first, she said.
TAs in many Humanities and
Sciences departments expressed

concern that
larger sections
will impede their
ability to teach
and lead discus
sions.
"Thirty-five
students in a sec
tion will defeat
the purpose of
having TAs," said

former TA Brian Pearce, a law
student. "The whole purpose of a
TA is to give students something
else than they get with their pro
fessor. . . . The best sections I've
had have been around 12."
Drucker said she was worried

that larger sections might also
detract from the more focused at
tention that smaller ones offer.
"If you have 35 people in a sec
tion, people won't do the reading
because they will know they can
get away with it," Drucker said.
Sophomore Pete Hopkins — a
student in Political Science 35 —
agreed, "(In such a large section)
not much would be covered, and
it would be kind of chaotic."
Padgett stressed that the 30 to
35 section enrollment figures were
averages, noting that small dis
cussion sections in English, West
ern Culture and language classes
would be balanced by large prob
lem set review sections in depart
ments such as economics.
But Economics TA Coordinator


Padgett
Ann Velenchik objected to larger
economics sections.
"The general feeling among
Economics Department TAs is
that raising section size to 30 to
35 will weaken the contribution
that sections can make in having
students participate in class," she
said.
One department where packed
sections are clearly visible is Asian
Studies. "We have serious prob
lems in Asian languages," admit
ted Padgett.
For example, 170 first-year
Japanese students were jammed
into five sections at the beginning
of the year, according to Asian
Studies administrator Dagmar
Logie.
Since then, another section has
been added and enrollment has
dropped to 150, an average of 25
students per section.
"The question is, are students
dropping out because sections are

too big or are students dropping
out because the language is too
difficult?" Logie said.
TAs said they were also worried
that their salaries will drop as a
result of the budget cutbacks. Ul
timately, they said, cuts in TA
salaries will affect the quality of
education — there will be less
incentive for well-qualified grad
uate students to become TAs.
Some Political Science TAs said
the smaller paychecks they are
receiving this year were caused
by the larger budget cuts.
For example, Drucker said the
Office of Graduate Awards told
her last year that she would be
paid at least $6,500 per quarter
this year. After being hired in
June, she was told over the sum
mer — after Humanities and
Sciences announced the new TA
budget — that the department
was not sure she had a job any
more. When she arrived this fall,
she was able to become a TA. But
now her pay is just $5,200 per
quarter.
