In remembrance of "the
night of broken glass,"
and of the Holocaust

ON THE NIGHT of Nov. 9,
1938, known as Kristal
lnacht, Nazi-led German
mobs rampaged against German
Jewish citizens. In 24 hours they
burned and smashed more than
1,100 synagogues with hammers
and axes and vandalized more than
7,500 Jewish businesses and
homes, which signaled the begin
ning of the Holocaust.
But the worst was yet to come.
Western democracies did nothing
to help the the Holocaust victims,
which included blacks, Catholics,
gays and lesbians and the six mil
lion Jews.
For both tragedies, and in light
of the recent incidents of bigotry
at Stanford — including two swas
tikas painted on walls of campus
residences — Kristallnacht must
be remembered here today.
On Kristallnacht — "the night
of broken glass" — the Nazis
violently murdered 91 Jews and
arrested more than 30,000 — one
tenth of all German Jews. In ad
dition, Nazi stormtroopers dese
crated Jewish cemetaries and van
dalized Jewish hospitals.
The New York Times' lead story
on Nov. 11 described the massacre:
"A wave of destruction, looting and
incendarism unparalleled in Ger
many since the Thirty Years War
and in Europe generally since the
Bolshevist Revolution, swept over
Great Germany today as National
Socialist cohorts took vengeance on
Jewish shops, offices and syn
agogues."
However, no country came to the
rescue of the Jews. No immigration
quotas were increased, no aid was
given — nothing. In June 1939,

the ocean liner St. Louis arrived
with 1,128 German Jews, 700 of
whom had U.S. immigration quota
numbers, but which were three
years old. President Franklin D.
Roosevelt only allowed 22 refugees
to land.
Events like Kristallnacht and the
Holocaust, because of the extent
of the gore and crime, may seem
unbelievable to some. The
Washington-based group that
sponsored the anti-Semitic fliers
that appeared on campus last week
claims any Holocaust studies pro
gram would be "based on lies."
Two swastikas have been found
in the basement of East Lagunita
and in Lambda Nu House. In both
instances, the Nazi symbols had
been on the walls for at least a
year without anyone removing
them.
Regardless of whether the Uni
versity or the residents are to
blame, somebody should have had
the moral and ethical decency to
paint over them. That is why re
membrance and education are ab
solutely necessary to prevent the
barbarism of only 50 years ago
from re-occuring.
Last night, local community
groups of all religious backgrounds
joined Jews around the world in
lighting candles to recall the night
the Holocaust began.
Tonight there will be a panel
discussion in Cubberly Auditorium
that will include a survivor of Kris
tallnacht, and a free screening of
the movie "David," which tells the
story of a young Berlin Jew who
survived the war years and the
Holocaust. The program begins at
7 p.m. in Cubberley Auditorium.
Kristallnacht alone did not alert
the Western world to the reality
of bigotry. The tragedy is that it
took the Holocaust to open the
gates and hearts of Western de
mocracy only 50 years ago. Such
a nightmare should never happen
again.
