## The
						woman must decide 
### 
A RECENT Operation Rescue
protest at a Planned Parenthood
clinic in Sunnyvale has brought
present debate over abortion to the Stan
ford community, causing me to look again
at my own feelings regarding this issue.
I am pro-choice, meaning I support the
1973 Supreme Court decision to legalize
abortion and the right of women to choose
for themselves whether or not to have a
child.
I am not pro-abortion, however, and
in fact, I would like to see the need for
abortion clinics and the number of per
formed abortions rapidly decline. And I
would guess that all pro-choicers, and
indeed all women, feel the same way.
Women do not want to have abortions.
That is why Planned Parenthoods and
contraceptives exist: to prevent unwanted
pregnancies. Abortion is a frightening
thing for women, both physically and
emotionally. One's body is sacred, and
the idea of someone else tampering with
it is an unnerving thought.
Even more unnerving, however, is the
emotional trauma women fear will result
from choosing to abort a fetus, for we
assume we will wonder, and never know,
what type of person may have developed
from that fetus.
I hope I do not sound angry or bitter
over the issues of abortion that face wom
en. Although choosing to have an abortion
would be an agonizing and traumatic de
cision for me to make, I am still glad
that, as a woman, I am the one who
makes this choice.
Many men will not like what I have
next to say, but the woman is the one
who carries the fetus to term for nine

months and delivers the baby, and there
fore she is the one to ultimately decide
whether to terminate an unplanned preg
nancy.
In many ways, this places a great bur
den and responsibility on the shoulders
of women, but there are awesome rewards
as well. The excitement and fascination
I feel toward my own ability to give birth
to another human being overshadows my
apprehensions about the accompanying
responsibilities. I would rather be a
woman who might have to face the
trauma of an unplanned pregnancy than
a man who can never experience preg
nancy.
I find it interesting that there has been
some discussion on the "right" of men
to not become pregnant. A "right" implies
something that we can choose to express,
i.e., the "right" to vote, but men really
have no choice in the matter. I sometimes
wonder if men envy my unique ability,
as a woman, to "give" life, but thus far,
none that I know will admit that they
do. Still, I feel lucky to be a woman and,
despite the pain, I look forward to even
tually giving birth.
When sharing my feelings with female
friends I often wonder if I have a higher
threshold for pain than others: many
don't quite share my enthusiasm for our
biological endowments. Perhaps my over
exuberance is the reason why I am so
unsure whether I could have an abortion.
Yet, most women do not know "for sure"
whether they could have an abortion until
actually faced with making the decision
itself.
Despite my personal ambivalences
toward abortion, I strongly feel that the

legal choice must be there. Although
right-to-life groups insist that the fetus
is a human life and abortion constitutes
murder, I assert that the fetus is a po
tential for a human life that will only
begin at birth itself.
Unwanted pregnancies may lead to un
wanted children that are neglected or
abused, and in examining abortion, we
must keep in mind the possible negative
environment surrounding the life to be
born. Furthermore, the reversing of Roe
vs. Wade will not end abortion but only
lead to an increase in illegal abortions
that risk the health of the women in
volved.
I strongly disagree with intentional vi
olent attacks on and bombings of abortion
clinics, but I respect legal attempts by
right-to-life groups to discuss alternatives
with abortion patients.
I do not know enough about Operation
Rescue to support or oppose its methods,
but the protests, counter-protests, ag
gression and arrests last week in Sun
nyvale did not surprise me. Hostility and
anger always result when groups who are
pro-choice confront those who are pro-life,
or vice-versa, and this intensity of emo
tion indicates how sensitive the issue of
abortion is, and how much it effects us all.
