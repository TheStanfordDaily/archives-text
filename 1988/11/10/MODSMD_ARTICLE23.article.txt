## Education fights AIDS 
### 
IN THE NOV. 3 issue of The Daily,
Bill Brown wrote an editorial discus
sing the possibility of stopping the
HIV epidemic by screening individuals
for HIV antibody and issuing ID cards
("AIDS can be contained"). A careful
analysis shows this to be a flawed and
hazardous argument.
First, Brown states that his program
would eliminate AIDS from the United
States within 10 years. The mean incuba
tion period of HIV (the causal agent of
AIDS) is approximately eight to ten years.
This means even without further trans
mission 50 percent of those currently in
fected, or one million people, would not
even have symptoms of AIDS 10 years
from now. The majority of these would,
however, become ill in the subsequent
decade. Unfortunately, AIDS will be with
us for a long time.
Second, the tests currently used to
detect antibodies to HIV in those infected
are the ELISA ($l5) and Western Blot
($100), necessary for more specificity in
weeding out only those people who are
truly infected. Due to the nature of these
tests, false positives can never be elimi
nated.
Tests are also unable to detect people
in the "window of infectivity." This is
the period in which they are infected but
have not yet produced antibodies; a time
that has varied from two weeks to 12
months.
Because people will continue to use
drugs and have sexual relationships that
have the potential to transmit the virus,
screening would have to be done every
three months. Thus, 16 billion dollars
would be spent each year on testing alone,
not including the costs of establishing
laboratories, purchasing and maintaining
equipment, staffing testing centers and
ensuring compliance.
Third, False ID cards would undoubt
edly be produced. Thus, people relying
on the cards rather than on communi

cation with their partners and employing
practices that eliminate or reduce the
chance of transmission, will increase their
risk of becoming infected and infecting
others.
Fourth, although some people are in
formed about the means of HIV trans
mission, polls in San Francisco, Boston
and New York have shown that many
people believe transmission may occur
from contact with toilet seats, drinking
glasses or by attending parties, confer
ences or classes with people infected with
this virus. Thus, if Brown's screening
program is instituted, discrimination and
isolation will continue to occur, as it cur
rently does, for many people with HIV.
This will result in hundreds of thou
sands of individuals losing health insur
ance, employment, housing and social
support.
This does not mean that nothing can
be done to halt this epidemic. A well
coordinated program designed to provide
care for those currently ill, promote drug
and vaccine development and create an
effective educational effort which at
tempts to reach every individual at a
level which she or he can understand
and participate in are key strategies
against this virus.
In addition, laws are necessary to
protect those with HIV from discrimina
tion and persecution. Current levels of
ignorance with respect to this virus has
led to a situation in which dangerous
legislation is being written and often sup
ported by uninformed individuals.
Thoughtful educational programs would
not only result in more effective and
humanitarian public policy initiatives but
also slow the spread of a virus that has
already infected almost 1 percent of
Americans.
