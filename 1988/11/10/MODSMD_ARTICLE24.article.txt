Holocaust analogy
to abortion in U.S.
a disservice to all
The highly emotional nature of the
abortion debate often leads to ar
gumentative tactics that border on
hysteria.
Everyone expects rhetoric to be
forceful. However, when rhetoric
means drawing a parallel between the
pro-choice movement and the Nazi's
social agenda, as the "pro-life" contin
gent persists in doing, rhetoric becomes
not just forceful but morally offensive.
During a panel discussion in Sterling
Quad on abortion, pro-life supporter
Jennifer Bryson suggested to the audi
ence that aborting fetuses equaled a
kind of "social engineering" not seen
since the terror of Nazi Germany.
In a show of support for Bryson's
analogy, the pro-life contingent posted
a series of photographs showing fetuses
in various stages of development; it
was titled "The American Holocaust."
More recently, in a letter to The
Daily clarifying the events of "Opera
tion Rescue," pro-life supporters Janice
and Joyce Keen compared their plight
as pro-lifers to that of the resistance
fighters during World War 11.
They wrote: "Was it not the illegal
efforts of courageous individuals who
at the risk of their own lives saved
countless numbers from the hands of
Hitler?" Deftly pursuing this incredible
analogy, they add that in this spirit
they will defy "man's edicts," and fight
"the holocaust of American children."
Rhetoric this outrageous would be
almost laughable did it not reveal such
immense ignorance and disregard for
the actual events and meaning of the
Holocaust.
During the Holocaust, Jews, Commu
nists and other sections of society con
sidered a threat to the Nazi social
agenda were systematically rounded up

and murdered. Do Janice and Joyce
Keen really mean to suggest that the
pro-choice movement is tantamount to
Hitler's forces, methodically tracking
down and murdering American
children?
Citing history for shock value does a
great disservice to everyone. It is not
only careless and factually incorrect, it
is also an enormous insult to those
who died and whose families died dur
ing the Holocaust.
Moreover, it is offensive both to the
intelligence of the Stanford community
and to the pro-life movement itself. We
all deserve better.

On Nov. 8, I responded to a tele
phone call from a Daily reporter re
garding the discussion by the Commit
tee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement on the return of the "F"
grade. The article which resulted from
that conversation leaves the impression
that I may think that our students do
not take their courses seriously.
On the contary, I believe that our
students are very committed to their
academic and intellectual development
and work very hard to achieve high
standards.
