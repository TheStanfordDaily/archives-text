## Revealing heart's secrets New technique used to explain calcium in heart 
### Jill Mathews 
Cardiovascular disease is the leading
cause of death in the United States
today, followed by cancer and stroke.
Death from coronary heart disease oc
curs 30 to 40 percent of the time without
previous warning or symptoms.
Stanford researchers recently devel
oped a new technique which allows ob
servation of an intact heart with
ischemia, deficient blood flow.
Developed by Assoc. Prof. William
Clusin and his colleagues at Stanford's
Falk Cardiovascular Research Center,
the innovation of the new technique lies
in its capacity to isolate the intact heart.
Previous methods relied on dissection
or observation of cardiac cells.
"To do our work we needed to be able
to study what happens in an individual
cell when a heart attack occurs. But you
can't replicate what really happens to
that cell when it's isolated and under a
microscope. . . . Simply removing the
oxygen from isolated cells or tissue is
not a satisfactory model of what happens
in a heart attack," said Clusin.
The new procedure involves two com
ponents: a dye called Indo-1, developed
in 1985 at UC-Berkeley by Dr. Roger
Tsien, and a fiberoptic cable system
using ultraviolet light, created by the
Stanford researchers.
After removing the aorta from a rabbit
heart, Clusin and his team inject the
coronary arteries with the dye. Fluores
cent molecules in the dye diffuse across
and become trapped within the heart
cell membranes.
Researchers use the ultraviolet light
to measure changes in the dye, thus
detecting irregular activity in the heart.
Using this new technique, the Stan
ford research team now has documented
evidence of what was only suspected pre
viously: lack of blood flow to the heart
causes an increase in free calcium ions
in the cardiac muscle.

This increase interferes with the
heart's synchronous electrical signals,
sometimes resulting in ventricular fibril
lation, the occurrence of erratic contrac
tions of the heart. Circulation then
ceases, often causing sudden death.
"Less than a third, maybe as few„as
one in 20," people survive these erratic
contractions, according to Clusin.
The concentration of calcium ions in
blood is 10,000 times higher than it is
in muscle tissue, said Clusin. Disrupting
this ratio in the heart muscle distorts
the electrical pulses governing heart con
traction.
Clusin's groundbreaking research
hinged on the use of the new two-part
technique. In this case, the team traced
the irregular movement of calcium ions
in the heart using ultraviolet light to
measure changes in the dye trapped in
the cell membranes.
In the absence of calcium ions, the
light appears green; areas of calcium ion
concentration appear blue. The amount
of calcium in the heart is calculated
using a ratio of the green and blue lights.
Calcium blocking drugs such as
verapamil have been used previously for
treating ischemia, but doctors could only
guess at the exact processes of ischemia
and its consequences, according to
Clusin.
In studying the interaction of calcium
and the cardiac muscle, the new tech
nique will illuminate the precise mech
anisms of the heart influencing the
regularity of contractions. More accurate
measurement of the calcium ions pro
vides the information necessary for de
velopment of more effective preventive
drugs.
The procedure allows observation of
intact cardiac muscle, which means it
will be useful for research on the effect
of a variety of substances on the heart,
such as adrenalin and norepinephrine,
said Clusin.
