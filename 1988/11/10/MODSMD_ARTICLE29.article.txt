# Adding color to the Foothills
## Students work to reforest Stanford land

Tall willowy trees aren't just
pleasing to the eye; they're a nat
ural resource essential to a stable
global ecosystem.
But over the past few decades
they've been disappearing just as
fast as they've been growing. They
have been cleared away to make
space for agriculture and build
ings, sprayed with pesticides and
herbicides and afflicted with con
taminated air from factory pollu
tion.
Even here at Stanford, the en
vironmental loss is apparent. The
problem is especially notable in
the Foothills, near Stanford's
satellite dish.
"There were [about] three big
trees two decades ago for each
two trees that stand today," notes
David Schrom, a representative of
Magic Inc., a firm in Palo Alto
which researches and teaches
human ecology.
Together with Students for En
vironmental Action at Stanford
and community volunteers,
Schrom is working on a long-term
reforestation project at Stanford.
"Our goal is to protect the Foot
hills because they are a unique
and remarkable recreation area,"
explains senior Hilary Hug, a
member of Stanford's environ
mental group.
Planting trees in the foothills
signals a first step towards the
student group's goal of guarantee
ing the continuation and protec
tion of this unique environment.
"Reforestation is something
permanent the club can do for
Stanford right now. We can give
something that will leave a lasting
mark," Hug says.
"We want to re-establish a sta
ble population of trees in all the
places they previously existed,"

Schrom adds, noting that the vol
unteers are planting a variety of
trees such as coastal live oak, the
valley oak and the blue oak.
"Stanford has incredible re
sources," says Schrom. "Np other
university has the kind of land
and surrounding community that
we have and must preaerwp."
Recently, several factors have
contributed to the destruction of
trees. Construction precariously
close to the forests, ,and the con
stant demand for firewood and
charcoal continue to endanger
trees.
An increase in the number of
rodents has also threatened tree
populations, according to Schrom.
Due to human intervention, new
grass species were introduced that
were not formerly part of the
living network, thus causing the
disappearance of certain species
of small animals such as foxes.
This in turn caused a resurgence
of rodents.
This year's especially dry hot
weather has also affected tree
growth. Much of the ground water
for the trees has been used up.
But volunteers here are dedi
cated to fighting the problem. On
an early Saturday morning in Oc
tober, nearly 20 Stanford students
planted 600 acorns at 300 differ
ent sites in the Foothills. Acorns
have a better chance of surviving
than do seedling 9 from a nursery,
and the double planting at each
site ensures greater growth suc
cess.
With constant attention — in
cluding weekly watering — the
first sprouts of the trees might

very well appear by next spring.
"Just by putting oaks on the
hills," says Schrom, "we're
making people think about the
resources we have, whether they
are looking at it from an aesthetic
view ... or from a necessary view
of protecting the environment for
our future."
"We want to raise the awareness
of the environment at Stanford,"
adds freshman Todd David, a
member of the Stanford environ
mental group.
J\"We have so much potential
here in pure brain power. If each
person would just do his or her
own part, [protecting the environ
ment] would become a regular
habit and no longer a problem,"
David say».
The volunteer group is working
with the Stanford Planning De
partment to fund the project. Vol
unteers are still in demand, espe
cially to help with crucial weekly
watering.
Students may receive academic
credit for participation in the proj
ect through the Biology Depart
ment. Dorms, fraternities, soror
ities, co-ops and other groups are
encouraged to send representa
tives to help out. . ■ ffQfft
