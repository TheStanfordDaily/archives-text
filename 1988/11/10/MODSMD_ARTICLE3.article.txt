### Nathanael Cousins Staff writer 
Ecstatic after his election-day triumph,
Congressman-elect Tom Campbell yesterday bid
goodbye to the campaign trail and plotted his course
to the Capitol.
Trade and the environment will be Campbell's
immediate congressional priorities, he told support
ers and campaign staff members at his Mountain
View campaign headquarters.
Campbell also said he would be an "ombudsman"
for the 12th congressional district, stressing that
he needs input from his constituents, including those
in the Stanford community. "Casting votes is only
one small part of a congressman's duty," he said.
"There is a window of opportunity to influence the
next administration."
Campbell, a Republican and a Stanford law pro
fessor, defeated Democrat Anna Eshoo 51.3 percent
to 46.4 percent with a final margin of 11,709 votes
in Tuesday's balloting.
After thanking his supporters, Campbell flew to
Florida where he will spend time with his mother.
Campbell's father died during the final weeks of
the campaign.
Campbell said that cleaning up contaminated
ground water will be his No. 1 legislative priority.
"The emphasis must be placed on clean-up," said
Campbell, whose candidacy had been endorsed by
the Sierra Club.
