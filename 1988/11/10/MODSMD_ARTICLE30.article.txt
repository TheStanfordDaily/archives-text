"The First Salute: A View of the
American Revolution"
by Barbara W. Tuchman
Knopf, $22.95
Reviewed by E. Wayne Carp
Popular histories of warfare are
often written in a heroic mode:
battles are romanticized, causa
tion simplified and victory or
defeat reduced to the brave or
cowardly actions of a few individ
uals. The popular history of the
American Revolution is no excep
tion.
In most accounts, the Revolu
tionary War is a saga of patriot
victories at Concord, Trenton,
Saratoga and Yorktown punc
tuated by the Continental Army's
triumph over adversity at Valley
Forge. Looming over the tale is
the God-like Washington and the
malevolent arch-traitor Benedict
Arnold.
Missing from these histories of
the American Revolution is an ap
preciation that Americans owe
their independence, in great mea
sure, to the military assistance of
France, Spain and Holland. Dur
ing the first three years of the
war, Holland and France smug

gled the arms and ammunition to
America that sustained the Con
tinental Army. In the latter part
of the conflict, French soldiers
fought on American soil while
French and Dutch loans under
wrote the war's cost.
Most importantly, allied naval
power forced Great Britain to
divide its navy between defending
against the threat of a cross
channel invasion and protecting
its far-flung colonial empire in the
Indian Ocean and Caribbean.
Forced to relegate America to
a secondary theater of war, its
naval forces spread thin, Great
Britain was unable to prevent the
French fleet under Admiral de
Grasse from trapping Cornwallis
at Yorktown and ending the war.
Americans won their indepen
dence not because they defeated
the British at Yorktown, but be
cause the British thought it pru
dent to give up the colonies in
order to protect the rest of the
Empire from French and Spanish
attack.
In"The First Salute," Barbara
Tuchman, a popular historian and
two-time winner of the Pulitzer
Prize, has written a lively history
of the American Revolutionary

Tuchman commits innumerable factual
errors and, like a good Hollywood screen
writer, ignores the ones that spoil the
drama. The book's title, 'The First Salute,'
is the most glaring example of Tuchman's
disregard for historical accuracy.

War, one which places interna
tional support and naval warfare
in the forefront of the story. This
is a history from the perspective
of European kings, ministers and
admirals; except for John Paul
Jones and George Washington,
American leaders remain in the
background.
Tuchman divides her study into
three sections. She focuses first
on the Dutch, describing how by
1776 the small Dutch West Indian
island, St. Eustatius, became the
conduit for smuggled war
material to the American revolu
tionaries, and how the profits
from smuggling contraband
caused the Dutch to violate their
treaty of alliance with Great Brit
ain, leading to a British declara
tion of war in 1780.
Tuchman then shifts her nar
rative in the second section to
Great Britain and the capture of
St. Eustatius in February 1781
by Admiral Sir George Brydges
Rodney. Much of this section is
given over to detailed discussions
of Rodney, British ministerial in
eptitude and the intricacies of
naval warfare.
In the final section, Tuchman
returns to 1778 and describes
France's entry into the war on
the side of the Americans, the
frustrations of Franco-American
naval cooperation and the allied
triumph at Yorktown.
As this summary suggests, the
value of Tuchman's study is that
it strips away much of the provin
cialism that surrounds the
popular history of the American
Revolutionary War by underscor
ing its world-wide dimension and
the United States' dependence on
foreign assistance.

Nevertheless, it is difficult to
recommend "The First Salute" to
the general reader. Tuchman has
no empathy or real understanding
of the 18th century and she con
stantly imposes 20th century
standards on 18th century behav
ior, inveighing against the evils
of bureaucracy, nepotism and poor
hygiene.
She also violates the historian's
canon by ignoring chronology,
putting words in the mouths of
individuals that they never ut
tered and imputing to historical
actors knowledge that they exhib
ited only many years later.
Most distressingly, Tuchman
commits innumerable factual er
rors and, like a good Hollywood
screen writer, ignores the ones
that spoil the drama. The book's
title, "The First Salute," is the
most glaring example of Tuch
man *8 disregard for historical ac
curacy.
According to Tuchman, on Nov.
16, 1776, on St. Eustatius, the
American ship Andrew Doria re
ceived from a foreign nation the
ritual cannon salute acknowledg
ing, for the first time, the
sovereignty of the United States.
Unfortunately, it's not true. As
J. Franklin Jameson noted in a
1903 article cited by Tuchman,
government officials on the Dutch
island of St. Croix saluted an un
named American schooner on Oct.
27, 1776, more than two weeks
before the incident on St. Eus
tatius.
But, of course, "The Second Sa
lute" wouldn't sell.

Nevertheless, it is difficult to
recommend "The First Salute" to
the general reader. Tuchman has
no empathy or real understanding

ior, inveighing against the evils
of bureaucracy, nepotism and poor
hygiene.
She also violates the historian's
canon by ignoring chronology,
putting words in the mouths of
individuals that they never ut
tered and imputing to historical
actors knowledge that they exhib
ited only many years later.
Most distressingly, Tuchman
commits innumerable factual er
rors and, like a good Hollywood
screen writer, ignores the ones
that spoil the drama. The book's
title, "The First Salute," is the
most glaring example of Tuch

curacy.
According to Tuchman, on Nov.
16, 1776, on St. Eustatius, the
American ship Andrew Doria re
ceived from a foreign nation the
ritual cannon salute acknowledg
ing, for the first time, the
sovereignty of the United States.
Unfortunately, it's not true. As
J. Franklin Jameson noted in a
1903 article cited by Tuchman,
government officials on the Dutch
island of St. Croix saluted an un
named American schooner on Oct.
27, 1776, more than two weeks
before the incident on St. Eus

But, of course, "The Second Sa

Popular histories of warfare are
often written in a heroic mode:
battles are romanticized, causa
tion simplified and victory or
defeat reduced to the brave or
cowardly actions of a few individ
uals. The popular history of the
American Revolution is no excep
tion.
In most accounts, the Revolu
tionary War is a saga of patriot
victories at Concord, Trenton,
Saratoga and Yorktown punc
tuated by the Continental Army's
triumph over adversity at Valley
Forge. Looming over the tale is
the God-like Washington and the
malevolent arch-traitor Benedict
Arnold.
Missing from these histories of
the American Revolution is an ap
preciation that Americans owe
their independence, in great mea
sure, to the military assistance of
France, Spain and Holland. Dur
ing the first three years of the
war, Holland and France smug

gled the arms and ammunition to
America that sustained the Con
tinental Army. In the latter part
of the conflict, French soldiers
fought on American soil while
French and Dutch loans under
wrote the war's cost.
Most importantly, allied naval
power forced Great Britain to
divide its navy between defending
against the threat of a cross
channel invasion and protecting
its far-flung colonial empire in the
Indian Ocean and Caribbean.
Forced to relegate America to
a secondary theater of war, its
naval forces spread thin, Great
Britain was unable to prevent the
French fleet under Admiral de
Grasse from trapping Cornwallis
at Yorktown and ending the war.
Americans won their indepen
dence not because they defeated
the British at Yorktown, but be
cause the British thought it pru
dent to give up the colonies in
order to protect the rest of the
Empire from French and Spanish
attack.
In"The First Salute," Barbara
Tuchman, a popular historian and
two-time winner of the Pulitzer
Prize, has written a lively history
of the American Revolutionary

Tuchman commits innumerable factual
errors and, like a good Hollywood screen
writer, ignores the ones that spoil the
drama. The book's title, 'The First Salute,'
is the most glaring example of Tuchman's
disregard for historical accuracy.

War, one which places interna
tional support and naval warfare
in the forefront of the story. This
is a history from the perspective
of European kings, ministers and
admirals; except for John Paul
Jones and George Washington,
American leaders remain in the
background.
Tuchman divides her study into
three sections. She focuses first
on the Dutch, describing how by
1776 the small Dutch West Indian
island, St. Eustatius, became the
conduit for smuggled war
material to the American revolu
tionaries, and how the profits
from smuggling contraband
caused the Dutch to violate their
treaty of alliance with Great Brit
ain, leading to a British declara
tion of war in 1780.
Tuchman then shifts her nar
rative in the second section to
Great Britain and the capture of
St. Eustatius in February 1781
by Admiral Sir George Brydges
Rodney. Much of this section is
given over to detailed discussions
of Rodney, British ministerial in
eptitude and the intricacies of
naval warfare.
In the final section, Tuchman
returns to 1778 and describes
France's entry into the war on
the side of the Americans, the
frustrations of Franco-American
naval cooperation and the allied
triumph at Yorktown.
As this summary suggests, the
value of Tuchman's study is that
it strips away much of the provin
cialism that surrounds the
popular history of the American
Revolutionary War by underscor
ing its world-wide dimension and
the United States' dependence on
foreign assistance.
