He was traveling with his fam
ily on the highway that goes from
Mexico City to Cuervnavaca when
he suddenly came up with the
phrase that would open his novel.
He had waited 20 years for it,
while he became familiar with the
characters who made up his fic
tious world. He turned back, got
home and locked himself up for
eight months while his wife Mer
cedes figured out how to "fill the
pot," avoid collection agents and
justify her husband's absence.
Finally, frightened and tired, no
doubt, from his passionate strug
gle with language and imagina
tion, Gabriel Garcia M&rquez
emerged from his rapture with
one of the most fascinating novels
of our time — "One Hundred
years of Solitude."
"Love in the Time of Cholera,"
Marquez's latest novel, came out
under very special circumstances,
not in the uncertainty about a
work-in-progress known to a few
readers and friends, but in a world
of fame, wealth, the Nobel Prize
in literature and unrestrained
friendship with celebrities — the
highest prizes and honors 20th
century writers can enjoy.
The challenge of "Love," then,
was different and was to be
weighed differently: this time, the
greatest contender Garcia

M&rquez had to defeat was close,
and his name was Garcia
M&rquez.
To start with, "Love" was a
novel "foretold" at least since
1983: Garcia M&rquez was writing
a "love novel." Love? Surely the
first question he must have asked
himself is how to write a love
story that would not be tacky, in
this skeptic end of the century in
which the concept of love has
dwindled to nothingness.
For our excessively intellectual
era, notes Umberto Eco, "... the
postmodern attitude is like loving
a very cultured woman and
knowing that you cannot say to
her 'I love you desperately' be
cause he knows she knows (and
that she knows he knows) these
phrases have already been writ
ten "
So, M&rquez had to face the
readers' hyperconscience, because
Garcia Marquez knows that we
know that a love story can become
the tomb of the best of literary
intentions.
The first step Garcia M&rquez
took to overcome this problem was
to accomodate his narrative tone,
more than in other books, within
a realist code, thereby controlling
his outbursts of imagination. In
this novel, there aren't any
remedios who vanish skyward
clinging to bedsheets, nor choc
olates that provoke levitation, yel
low butterflies, funerals like "Big
Mama's," nor young Erendiras
who payback their long debts with
their bodies.

What there is, however, is im
measurable time — or time
prolonged in its twists and circles.
There are the five decades of
Florentino Ariza's silent love, as
he stubbornly waits for the
women who jilted him.
Or there is the outcome of the
novel, a meeting of old lovers and
their happy sentence to navigate
together towards death. This is
time which seems to belong quite
legitimately to MSirquez's fabled
hyperbolic world.
On the other hand, Milrquez's
efforts to reconstruct the feelings,
values and moral stances of an
era are notable — they provide a
sense of reality to a very unlikely
story. It is a finely wrought
reconstruction, with political
events as background, marking
with special care the presence of
cholera but upsetting it with
anachronisms.
The place: a city without a name
which could very well be Barran
quilla or some other coastal city.
The time: second half of the 19th
century and first decades of the
20th. Subject: a story of love un
done. Story: that of the youthful
love between Fermina Daza and
Florentino Ariza, a modest
telegraph operator later employed
by the Shipping Company.
"Love in the Time Cholera"
chronicles how this relationship
is opposed by adults and how it
is suddenly interrupted when Fer
mina finds out that she doesn't
love Florentino. Instead, she
marries a doctor and lives into

widowhood after 50 years of ques
tionable or mediocre matrimony.
The "turn of the screw" is that,
already old and thanks to stub
borness, the old lovers meet again
and finally consummate their
stilted desire in their spent lives
and bodies.
More than a deep novel, "Love"
is a proliferating one. Garcia
M&rquez has the capacity of a
great storyteller to narrate with
out limits. His characters hardly
grow up or develop as they do in
psychological novels; and here the
central anecdote and the three
characters who are implicated are
even less important than the
whole, which reverberates in mul
tiple stories with the verbal push
of a seductive prose filled with
grace.
As in other books of his, notably
"One Hundred Years of Solitude"
and"The Autumn of the
Patriarch," Garcia Marquez views
history as cyclical. In the long
and repetitive ride up and down
the river in the "New Fidelity,''
there is a closed image of love
and life like a perpetual invention
of themselves within the limited
biological course of existence.
The jocund vitality of
M&rquez's incessant inventiveness
alternates with his skeptical if
pessimist view that makes this
novel a ripe albeit bitter product
of his narrative art. This is
thoughtfulness made into an
image: of patient and suffered
love, trembling and feverish, dis
graced and happy, the agent of
dissatisfaction and desire — ex
actly like that tropical disease
called cholera.
