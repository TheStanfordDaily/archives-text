Gene Oegruson, ed., "The Lost First Edition of Upton Sinclair's
THE JUNGLE," St. Luke Press, $21.95
Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle" is certainly the most profoundly
important work of social fiction of 20th century America. With the
book, Sinclair single handedly exposed the inhuman conditions
of the Chicago meat packing industry and helped form contem
porary notions of government's regulatory responsibilities.
Jack London called it,"The 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' of the socialist
movement."
The modern reputation of "The Jungle," however, is based not
on Sinclair's original manuscript as it appeared in the socialist
newspaper "Appeal to Reason," but instead has been mediated
by the censorship and editorial deletions of Doubleday, Page.
Now, readers have the ability, for the first time, to read "The
Jungle" in its original form, complete with the ethnic detail, socialist
agenda and many metaphoric references to "the jungle" that were
deleted by the publisher.
Everyone has heard of "The Jungle." Very few have actually
read it. With the publication of "The Lost First Edition," which
also contains and excellent introduction by the editor, now's the
time to do so.
