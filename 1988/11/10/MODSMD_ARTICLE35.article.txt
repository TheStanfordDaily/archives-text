## Is Sugar Ray the sweetest of all? 
### 
Forget that the WBA's
super-middleweight crown is
utterly bogus. Set aside the
three retirements and however
many 7-Up commercials he's
performed.

It's all meaningless hype,
and whether you like him or
not, you've got to admit that
Sugar Ray Leonard is the
smartest man ever to practice
the sweet science of prizefight
ing, as well as the second
greatest fighter in the history
of the sport, behind only the
incomparable Muhammad Ali.
On Monday night, fighting
the WBC's reigning light
heavyweight champion, Can
ada's Donny Lalonde, Sugar
raised his record to 35-1 and
proved himself again.
Critics said he was too small,
too greedy and way too pretty.
They were tired of looking at
him and hoped Lalonde would
knock him out.
Too bad for them because
once again, Sugar Ray came
out on top. And he did it in a
way that not too many people
could have expected. Instead of
slipping punches and jabbing
his way to a decision, Leonard
went toe-to-toe with the bigger
Lalonde, and put him on the
floor for good in the ninth
round.
If Sugar quits now, it would
be a fitting culmination to a
brilliant career. If he keeps
going, Lalonde will become just
another entry on the long list
of those who couldn't stop

Sugar. A list that includes the
much more notable names of
Marvelous Marvin Hagler,
Thomas Hearns and Roberto
Duran.
Indeed, in a professional
career of over a decade, in
which he's fought at three dif
ferent weights, Sugar Ray has
only lost once, and that was to
Roberto "no mas" Duran,
whose career ended with the
rematch.
And that brings us to why
Sugar's so smart. We know that
he looks good. We know that
he's charismatic and articulate,
and so does he. Like Ali in his
prime, Ray Leonard cultivates
his image. He capitalizes on the
side of him that draws cameras
and crowds like a magnet.
But there's another Ray
Leonard, and he is one of the
toughest men ever to lace up
the gloves. Thankfully, I don't
know what it's like to be in
the ring with Sugar. I don't
know exactly what it is that
he says and does to his oppo
nents, but it has to be some
thing fierce. Out of the ring
he hides that.
Because he's picture perfect,
a man with a million dollar
smile in a brutal, barbaric
sport, Leonard's toughness has
been woefully underrated, and
that's the way he likes it.
He's put on a wonderful act.
They may call him Sugar, but
the man's not sweet.
If you doubt it, just go back
to the list of people he's beaten.
Marvelous Marvin Hagler,
Thomas Hearns and Roberto
Duran, all guys who made their
living by not being pretty, but
by being tough. These were
some of the toughest men on
the planet.
Nineteen months ago, the
popular wisdom held that no
one could out mean Marvelous
Marvin, but little, friendly
