# Cagers will control opposition

Is it basketball season already?
Though the leaves on the trees
are just starting to fall and classes
just began about a month ago,
the Stanford women's basketball
team is getting a head start on
what should be a stellar 1988-89
season when it hosts the
Australian Junior National Team
in an exhibition game tonight at
7:30 in Maples Pavilion.
If the preseason press is any
key, the Aussies will have an in
surmountable opponent on their
hands. Stanford has been ranked
highly on all the preseason polls
that have been published so far,
including a No. 10 rating on the
prestigious Street and Smith's
poll and No. 6 by Sports Il
lustrated. Additionally, the Cardi
nal was picked sixth on the Wom
en's Basketball News Service list
ing and fifth by the Women's Bas
ketball Yearbook, as well as sec
ond in the rigorous Pacific 10
Conference.
Not bad for last year's surprise
team, a squad picked by Street
and Smith's as the "sleeper"
preseason No. 20 after years of
lackluster play and sparse vic
tories. From being a perennial vic
tim, the Cardinal suddenly
emerged a as powerhouse that
came very close to claiming the
school's first conference title.
What the team did do, however,
is finish the year with a whopping
27-5 record bolstered by a school
record 14-game win streak and a
subsequent 11-win stretch. The
mark was good enough for the
school's first NCAA bid in six
years, a fifth place seeding in the
Midwest region that produced
eventual NCAA champion Loui
siana Tech, a squad the team met
but did not play in the Midwest
Regional at Texas after upsetting
fourth-seeded Montana in a 74-72
overtime battle in Missoula.
When all the dust of 1988 had
settled, the squad found itself
ranked 13th by Associated Press
and with the invaluable benefit
of top-notch competition. With
just two senior reserves from last
year gone and the best recruiting

class in the nation, Stanford is
ripe and ready to contend again
and is unwilling to relinquish its
hard-earned place among the top
-10 elite.
"I think definitely this year we
think we're a top-10 team," said
junior guard Jennifer Azzi, an all
conference selection last season
and a Street and Smith's pre
season honorable mention All-
America this year. "Last year it
was kind of hard to imagine going
from not even being in the top-20
and then all of a sudden be a
top-10 team. I think now we're
more realistic and more confident
about things, especially being as
ranked as high as we are.
"I think if anything, we just
want to get higher up," she added.
"I don't think we feel insecure
about being ranked in the top-10
— we just want to make it up to
No. 1."
Though a little more conserva
tive, Stanford Coach Tara Van-
Derveer is equally optimistic. Her
roster is filled with an assortment
of all-stars eager to push the pro
gram to new heights, including a
core of five seasoned starters and
several strong reserves.
Atop anyone's list is Azzi, Stan
ford's leading scorer last year and
a frequent destroyer of school
records. The junior has long-since
blown out all but one of the
schools three-point field goal
records as well as the single-game
and career assist marks. After
only two seasons, the junior rates
13th on the school career scoring
list.
This year, she could be even
better. Azzi toured Taipei this
summer with the U.S. Select
Team, the B squad of the national
team that ultimately won the gold
medal at the Seoul Olympics. Her
summer squad finished second,
and Azzi gained some valuable in
ternational experience that will
carry over into the Stanford
season.
"This summer's experience for
Jennifer really helped her out a
lot," VanDerveer said. "Jennifer's
in really good shape, has a great

Junior guard Jennifer Azzi, a preseason Ail-America honorable
mention, is expected to lead the Cardinal to a top-10 ranking this
season.
