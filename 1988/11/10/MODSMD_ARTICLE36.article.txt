# Cagers will control opposition

### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Is it basketball season already?
Though the leaves on the trees
are just starting to fall and classes
just began about a month ago,
the Stanford women's basketball
team is getting a head start on
what should be a stellar 1988-89
season when it hosts the
Australian Junior National Team
in an exhibition game tonight at
7:30 in Maples Pavilion.
If the preseason press is any
key, the Aussies will have an in
surmountable opponent on their
hands. Stanford has been ranked
highly on all the preseason polls
that have been published so far,
including a No. 10 rating on the
prestigious Street and Smith's
poll and No. 6 by Sports Il
lustrated. Additionally, the Cardi
nal was picked sixth on the Wom
en's Basketball News Service list
ing and fifth by the Women's Bas
ketball Yearbook, as well as sec
ond in the rigorous Pacific 10
Conference.
Not bad for last year's surprise
team, a squad picked by Street
and Smith's as the "sleeper"
preseason No. 20 after years of
lackluster play and sparse vic
tories. From being a perennial vic
tim, the Cardinal suddenly
emerged a as powerhouse that
came very close to claiming the
school's first conference title.
What the team did do, however,
is finish the year with a whopping
27-5 record bolstered by a school
record 14-game win streak and a
subsequent 11-win stretch. The
mark was good enough for the
school's first NCAA bid in six
years, a fifth place seeding in the
Midwest region that produced
eventual NCAA champion Loui
siana Tech, a squad the team met
but did not play in the Midwest
Regional at Texas after upsetting
fourth-seeded Montana in a 74-72
overtime battle in Missoula.
When all the dust of 1988 had
settled, the squad found itself
ranked 13th by Associated Press
and with the invaluable benefit
of top-notch competition. With
just two senior reserves from last
year gone and the best recruiting

class in the nation, Stanford is
ripe and ready to contend again
and is unwilling to relinquish its
hard-earned place among the top
-10 elite.
"I think definitely this year we
think we're a top-10 team," said
junior guard Jennifer Azzi, an all
conference selection last season
and a Street and Smith's pre
season honorable mention All-
America this year. "Last year it
was kind of hard to imagine going
from not even being in the top-20
and then all of a sudden be a
top-10 team. I think now we're
more realistic and more confident
about things, especially being as
ranked as high as we are.
"I think if anything, we just
want to get higher up," she added.
"I don't think we feel insecure
about being ranked in the top-10
— we just want to make it up to
No. 1."
Though a little more conserva
tive, Stanford Coach Tara Van-
Derveer is equally optimistic. Her
roster is filled with an assortment
of all-stars eager to push the pro
gram to new heights, including a
core of five seasoned starters and
several strong reserves.
Atop anyone's list is Azzi, Stan
ford's leading scorer last year and
a frequent destroyer of school
records. The junior has long-since
blown out all but one of the
schools three-point field goal
records as well as the single-game
and career assist marks. After
only two seasons, the junior rates
13th on the school career scoring
list.
This year, she could be even
better. Azzi toured Taipei this
summer with the U.S. Select
Team, the B squad of the national
team that ultimately won the gold
medal at the Seoul Olympics. Her
summer squad finished second,
and Azzi gained some valuable in
ternational experience that will
carry over into the Stanford
season.
"This summer's experience for
Jennifer really helped her out a
lot," VanDerveer said. "Jennifer's
in really good shape, has a great

season.
attitude about playing, she's play
ing with a lot of confidence and
she's worked on specific parts of
her game that will help our team.
"She's really going to play two
guard, in that Sonia (Henning)
will really be our point guard and
run our offense more. Jennifer's
been shooting the ball really well.
I'm really happy with how she's
playing."
The Cardinal's other star
guard, Henning, made the most
of her summer as well. A starter
along with classmate Trisha
Stevens on the U.S. Junior Select
Team that competed in the Junior
World Cup Qualifying Tourney in
Brazil, Henning scored the win
ning basket to give the U.S. the
tournament title.
Like Azzi, Henning has also
worked over the summer to add
new dimensions to her game. Al
ready an accomplished ball hand
ler and a physical, driving player,
last year's team MVP has worked
on expanding her shooting zone
to beyond three-point range.
"Sonia did the same thing (as
Azzi), worked hard over the sum
mer," VanDerveer said. "Sonia
has developed a new phase of her
game. Last year, people thought
of Jennifer as an outside shooter,
so she worked on bringing the
ball to the floor and driving; you
think of Sonia as a driver, and
she worked real hard on her
three-point shot. I think they're
both complements to each other
and they've complemented their
own game."

Along with what has been jus
tifiably touted as the "best back
court in the West," the Cardinal
boasts a starting front line that
is quick as well as dominant.
Senior Jill Yanke is entering her
fourth year as starting center and
at 6-foot-5 poses a sizable obstacle
to opponent post players.
At forward, Stevens and junior
Katy Steding provide a nice bal
ance of shooting, rebounding and
strong defense. Steding is one of
the squad's most prolific three
point shooters and consistent
rebounders, while Stevens has
overwhelmed the opposition with
steady inside shooting.
Add a bench of solid performers
like sophomore center/forward
Tammy Svoboda, senior forward
Evon Asforis and senior guard
Emily Wagner, along with the
talented freshman trio of Chris
MacMurdo, Martha Richards and
Julie Zeilstra, and the Pac-10 title
is definitely in reach.
"One of the best things about
playing in the Pac-10 is that it is
very competitive," VanDerveer
said. "I think more in terms of
NCAA instead of Pac-10 now, and
there are four, maybe five teams
in the Pac-10 capable of going to
the NCAA.
"I think it would be really ex
citing for our team to win the
Pac-10, and I think we have the
capability to do that.
"Do I think we have the ability
and the talent to win it? Yes,"
VanDerveer added. "Am I going
to say we're going to win it? Well,
that's why we play it, that's the
challenge."

When all the dust of 1988 had
settled, the squad found itself
ranked 13th by Associated Press
and with the invaluable benefit
of top-notch competition. With
just two senior reserves from last
year gone and the best recruiting

class in the nation, Stanford is
ripe and ready to contend again
and is unwilling to relinquish its
hard-earned place among the top
-10 elite.
"I think definitely this year we
think we're a top-10 team," said
junior guard Jennifer Azzi, an all
conference selection last season
and a Street and Smith's pre
season honorable mention All-
America this year. "Last year it
was kind of hard to imagine going
from not even being in the top-20
and then all of a sudden be a
top-10 team. I think now we're
more realistic and more confident
about things, especially being as
ranked as high as we are.
"I think if anything, we just
want to get higher up," she added.
"I don't think we feel insecure
about being ranked in the top-10
— we just want to make it up to
No. 1."
Though a little more conserva
tive, Stanford Coach Tara Van-
Derveer is equally optimistic. Her
roster is filled with an assortment
of all-stars eager to push the pro
gram to new heights, including a
core of five seasoned starters and
several strong reserves.
Atop anyone's list is Azzi, Stan
ford's leading scorer last year and
a frequent destroyer of school
records. The junior has long-since
blown out all but one of the
schools three-point field goal
records as well as the single-game
and career assist marks. After
only two seasons, the junior rates
13th on the school career scoring
list.
This year, she could be even
better. Azzi toured Taipei this
summer with the U.S. Select
Team, the B squad of the national
team that ultimately won the gold
medal at the Seoul Olympics. Her
summer squad finished second,
and Azzi gained some valuable in
ternational experience that will
carry over into the Stanford
season.
"This summer's experience for
Jennifer really helped her out a
lot," VanDerveer said. "Jennifer's
in really good shape, has a great

season.
attitude about playing, she's play
ing with a lot of confidence and
she's worked on specific parts of
her game that will help our team.
"She's really going to play two
guard, in that Sonia (Henning)
will really be our point guard and
run our offense more. Jennifer's
been shooting the ball really well.
I'm really happy with how she's
playing."
The Cardinal's other star
guard, Henning, made the most
of her summer as well. A starter
along with classmate Trisha
Stevens on the U.S. Junior Select
Team that competed in the Junior
World Cup Qualifying Tourney in
Brazil, Henning scored the win
ning basket to give the U.S. the
tournament title.
Like Azzi, Henning has also
worked over the summer to add
new dimensions to her game. Al
ready an accomplished ball hand
ler and a physical, driving player,
last year's team MVP has worked
on expanding her shooting zone
to beyond three-point range.
"Sonia did the same thing (as
Azzi), worked hard over the sum
mer," VanDerveer said. "Sonia
has developed a new phase of her
game. Last year, people thought
of Jennifer as an outside shooter,
so she worked on bringing the
ball to the floor and driving; you
think of Sonia as a driver, and
she worked real hard on her
three-point shot. I think they're
both complements to each other
and they've complemented their
own game."

Along with what has been jus
tifiably touted as the "best back
court in the West," the Cardinal
boasts a starting front line that
is quick as well as dominant.
Senior Jill Yanke is entering her
fourth year as starting center and
at 6-foot-5 poses a sizable obstacle
to opponent post players.
At forward, Stevens and junior
Katy Steding provide a nice bal
ance of shooting, rebounding and
strong defense. Steding is one of
the squad's most prolific three
point shooters and consistent
rebounders, while Stevens has
overwhelmed the opposition with
steady inside shooting.
Add a bench of solid performers
like sophomore center/forward
Tammy Svoboda, senior forward
Evon Asforis and senior guard
Emily Wagner, along with the
talented freshman trio of Chris
MacMurdo, Martha Richards and
Julie Zeilstra, and the Pac-10 title
is definitely in reach.
"One of the best things about
playing in the Pac-10 is that it is
very competitive," VanDerveer
said. "I think more in terms of
NCAA instead of Pac-10 now, and
there are four, maybe five teams
in the Pac-10 capable of going to
the NCAA.
"I think it would be really ex
citing for our team to win the
Pac-10, and I think we have the
capability to do that.
"Do I think we have the ability
and the talent to win it? Yes,"
VanDerveer added. "Am I going
to say we're going to win it? Well,
that's why we play it, that's the
challenge."
Is it basketball season already?
Though the leaves on the trees
are just starting to fall and classes
just began about a month ago,
the Stanford women's basketball
team is getting a head start on
what should be a stellar 1988-89
season when it hosts the
Australian Junior National Team
in an exhibition game tonight at
7:30 in Maples Pavilion.
If the preseason press is any
key, the Aussies will have an in
surmountable opponent on their
hands. Stanford has been ranked
highly on all the preseason polls
that have been published so far,
including a No. 10 rating on the
prestigious Street and Smith's
poll and No. 6 by Sports Il
lustrated. Additionally, the Cardi
nal was picked sixth on the Wom
en's Basketball News Service list
ing and fifth by the Women's Bas
ketball Yearbook, as well as sec
ond in the rigorous Pacific 10
Conference.
Not bad for last year's surprise
team, a squad picked by Street
and Smith's as the "sleeper"
preseason No. 20 after years of
lackluster play and sparse vic
tories. From being a perennial vic
tim, the Cardinal suddenly
emerged a as powerhouse that
came very close to claiming the
school's first conference title.
What the team did do, however,
is finish the year with a whopping
27-5 record bolstered by a school
record 14-game win streak and a
subsequent 11-win stretch. The
mark was good enough for the
school's first NCAA bid in six
years, a fifth place seeding in the
Midwest region that produced
eventual NCAA champion Loui
siana Tech, a squad the team met
but did not play in the Midwest
Regional at Texas after upsetting
fourth-seeded Montana in a 74-72
overtime battle in Missoula.
