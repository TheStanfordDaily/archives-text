The Stanford men's basketball
team lit up the scoreboard, if not
the eyes of Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery, with a 104-84 vic
tory over the Brewster Heights
Packing AA.U Club in an exhibi

Men's Basketball
Cardinal 104, Apple Packers 84

The Cardinal took the game for
good from the defending Amateur
Athletic Union Champions, a
Washington-based team made up
of ex-college players, with an 11-0
run midway through the first
half. But a cooperative assessment
of Stanford's performance by
Montgomery and reserve center
Derek Bruton put the result in
its proper perspective.
Montgomery started by saying,
"Other than the fact that we
weren't very good offensively, we
weren't very good defensively, and
we didn't play very hard . .
He then paused and looked at
Bruton, who concluded modestly,
"We were okay."
Indeed, a 20-point win is noth
ing to cry over. Five Cardinal
players hit double figures, led by
senior guard Todd Lichti's 18.
Stanford shot 70 percent in the

second half to lift itself to 57.7
for the game, and crashed the
boards all game long for a 46-30
edge.
But Montgomery was disap
pointed with the team's overall
impatience, falling for the Apple
Packers' fakes on defense and
then not taking the time to work
for a good shot on offense.
"We have a good shooting bas
ketball team," Montgomery said.
"We can score some points. (But)
I haven't heard the 45-second
clock go off yet; I'm sort of curious
what it sounds like. . . . We've got
to play smarter and harder."
Montgomery also noted the
need to work on the less obvious
fundamentals, such as producing
crisp outlet passes after defensive
rebounds.
But there was something good
brewing in Maples — Bruton, a
redshirt junior who averaged only
3.3 points per game last year.
Bruton scored 12 points in just
12 minutes, shooting a perfect 5-
for-5 from the field and 2-for-2
from the line. He also added three
rebounds.
"Bruton played real well,"
Montgomery said. "He came off
the bench and gave us a lift."
Bruton was happy about his
performance but didn't find it ex
traordinary.
"I don't take any shots unless
I know they're gonna go down,"
he said. "You won't see me out
taking shots from three-point

range.
"I feel a lot lighter on the court
and I feel I can move better,"
Bruton added, noting that he lost
weight over the summer. "The op
portunities were there."
The first man on the floor to
take advantage of the oppor
tunites last night was Brewster
Heights' Ernest Patterson, for
merly of Houston University. A
6-foot-2 guard, Patterson scored
all of the Apple Packers' points
as they burst out to an 11-6 lead
in the first four minutes.
Stanford junior guard Oliver
Cunningham came in for Lichti
to cover Patterson, and was a
main reason that Patterson was
held to only four more points for
the rest of the half. Patterson
finished with 26.
It wasn't Lichti's best game on
offense either. Though he had six
assists, he shot only 6-for-15 from
the field, less than the All-World
numbers Stanford fans will be ex
pecting.
"Todd's still adjusting," Mont
gomery said. "He's going to be
guarded by the opposing team's
best player, no question. He's got
to get used to that and relax."
However, Lichti will always be
Lichti. He came back in the game
shortly, and with Stanford trailing
17-13 after Patterson's 15th (and
final) points of the first half,
Lichti hit a suave two-foot hesita

tion shot while being fouled by
Brewster Heights' Matt Fleming.
Lichti sank the free throw to
cut it to one with 11:12 to go in
the half, and the Cardinal was off
on its 11-0 run. The streal in
cluded a flying, yes, flying, tip-in
by Bruton and was capped by a
powerful two-handed dunk by
sophomore Andrew Vlahov (who
finished with eight points) to
make it 24-17 with 9:18 to go.

A baseline drive by Michael
Brown of the Apple Packers cut
the lead to 32-20 with 4:09 left,
but Stanford closed out the half
with a 17-5 streak, hitting the
locker room with a 49-34 lead. A
nice play came when senior Bryan
McSweeney (11 points) stole the
ball on one end and then seconds
later hit a long jumper on the
other end just before the two
minute mark.
With as little as 5:51 to go in
the second half, Brewster Heights
cut Stanford's lead to 86-76 on a
long jumper by Patterson. But the

biggest Stanford run of all, 18-2
over the next 4:37, finally put the
game away.
"They (Brewster Heights) have
got great talent," Montgomery
said.
Card Notes
Terry Taylor and Todd Lichti tied
for the team lead in assists with six,

while Lichti and senior center Eric
Reveno each had seven rebounds.
Reveno also blocked three shots.
Stanford concludes its extended ex
hibition slate Tuesday against the
Czechloslovakian national team at
Maples at 7:30 p.m. Freshman Adam
Keefe, who broke hi 3 nose in practice
last week, is expected to play.
