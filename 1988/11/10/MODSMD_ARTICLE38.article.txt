# Miller runs the right course for Stanford
## 
### Kathy Lachenauer Editorial staff 
Imagine this one. A year of college
free of charge. No tuition, no book bill,
no long-term student loans. And what
does the ever-so-lucky student have to
do for this free ride? Absolutely nothing.
Junior Steve Miller, a transfer from
Northwestern University, could have
had this academic paradisio. Instead of
jumping up for joy, Miller told North
western administrators no way.
In April, Miller found out that North
western had decided to cut the school's
cross country and track programs. Be
cause of a prearranged deal, Miller could
finish up his studies there, keep his
scholarship . . . but not run with a col
legiate team.
With strawberry brown hair and a
hint of a Midwestern drawl, Miller is
an Illinois native through and through.
And he's quick to point out that he did
not want to leave Northwestern — a
Big 10 Conference school located about

-15 miles north of Chicago. But with a
high school two-mile state championship
already under his belt, Miller was a
runner who didn't want to pass up on
collegiate competition.
He began looking for a school that
had a challenging academic program,
scholarships and noteworthy track and
cross country teams. Stanford was the
only place that fit the bill.
"Stanford was the only school with
all three, so here I am," Miller says.
And though he's only been here for
two months, he's already a standout on
the Stanford team.
Last week, for instance, he was the
top Cardinal runner in the Pacific 10
Conference Championships, finishing
third overall. Miller ran a quick 31:03
over Stanford's hilly 10-kilometer
course.
Used to the flat Midwestern terrain,
Miller says the Stanford course took
some getting used to. "We've got the
toughest course I've ever run on. But
it's a definite home course advantage I

think," he says. "When you're here, you
can't help but do a lot of hills."
Uphill running wasn't the only
change that took some getting used to.
A self-described "team runner," Miller
explains that his teammates at North
western were athletes he'd known and
competed against since high school.
"It was an Illinois running clique,
filled with Illinois state champions on
a No. 1 all-star team," he says."I miss
those guys."
But Miller seems to have adjusted to
his California team just fine. Rarely
using the"I" word, Miller tends to say
"we" and speaks about the team's ac
complishments as a whole.
"What's best about about cross coun
try is the team aspect. I wouldn't want
to run with anyone else but these guys,"
he says.
At a first look, cross country might
not seem like much of a team sport —
there's no huddle, no passing, no game-

planning timeouts. But cross
country athletes are not just out
for themselves. In meets, the
scores of the top-five runners for
each team are tallied up and the
team with the lowest score wins.
More important than the pure
number crunch is the support
teammates offer each another.

making for an effective running
unit, according to men's cross
country Coach Scott Chisam.
"Steve glues the four other ath
letes together to make a scoring
five," he says.
Calling Miller's contribution a
"double plus," Chisam praises the
Illinois athlete's raw talent as well
as his motivating skills.
"He's got the ability to be one
of the top runners in the country,
and he's making everyone else
want to run faster and better,"
Chisam says.
The team effort is paying off.

On Saturday, the group heads
to the Fresno District-8 meet —
a do-or-die competition for cross
country runners hoping to qualify
for this November's NCAAs in
Des Moines, lowa.
At Saturday's meet, teams
hoping to qualify for nationals
must finish in the top two.
After its second-place finish at
Pac-lOs, both Miller and Chisam
think the Cardinal stands a good
chance grabbing the first or sec
ond team spot.
"I want to go to NCAAs so bad.
The (fans) are two to three deep
for the whole course," Miller says.
And this is the time for Miller
to make it. This is his last year
of eligibility for cross country,
though he can participate in two
more track seasons.
With a day-in/day-out routine
that he follows religiously, Miller
stands an excellent shot for the
big one.
At about 8:30 a.m. he jogs a
big loop around the Stanford
Shoping Center or Campus Drive.
Then it's off to morning classes.
After a quick afternoon cat nap
he heads out to the Stanford Golf
Course for 10-mile workouts with
the team.
But Miller's not one to forget
study time. Before exhaustion
starts to register, he hustles over
to the library for a few hours over
the books.
"It's a physical tiredness after
dinner. I just want to go to bed
but I have to put in some study
time; it's hard to stay awake,"
Miller admits.
Still, he'll put up with the huf
fing and puffing, the methodical
schedule and the mental drain un
til the big race in lowa.
And he might very well be
headed back to the Midwest —
but this time he'll be running for
Stanford.

On Saturday, the group heads
to the Fresno District-8 meet —
a do-or-die competition for cross
country runners hoping to qualify
for this November's NCAAs in
Des Moines, lowa.
At Saturday's meet, teams
hoping to qualify for nationals
must finish in the top two.
After its second-place finish at
Pac-lOs, both Miller and Chisam
think the Cardinal stands a good
chance grabbing the first or sec
ond team spot.
"I want to go to NCAAs so bad.
The (fans) are two to three deep
for the whole course," Miller says.
And this is the time for Miller
to make it. This is his last year
of eligibility for cross country,
though he can participate in two
more track seasons.
With a day-in/day-out routine
that he follows religiously, Miller
stands an excellent shot for the
big one.
At about 8:30 a.m. he jogs a
big loop around the Stanford
Shoping Center or Campus Drive.
Then it's off to morning classes.
After a quick afternoon cat nap
he heads out to the Stanford Golf
Course for 10-mile workouts with
the team.
But Miller's not one to forget
study time. Before exhaustion
starts to register, he hustles over
to the library for a few hours over
the books.
"It's a physical tiredness after
dinner. I just want to go to bed
but I have to put in some study
time; it's hard to stay awake,"
Miller admits.
Still, he'll put up with the huf
fing and puffing, the methodical
schedule and the mental drain un
til the big race in lowa.
And he might very well be
headed back to the Midwest —
but this time he'll be running for
Stanford.
Imagine this one. A year of college
free of charge. No tuition, no book bill,
no long-term student loans. And what
does the ever-so-lucky student have to
do for this free ride? Absolutely nothing.
Junior Steve Miller, a transfer from
Northwestern University, could have
had this academic paradisio. Instead of
jumping up for joy, Miller told North
western administrators no way.
In April, Miller found out that North
western had decided to cut the school's
cross country and track programs. Be
cause of a prearranged deal, Miller could
finish up his studies there, keep his
scholarship . . . but not run with a col
legiate team.
With strawberry brown hair and a
hint of a Midwestern drawl, Miller is
an Illinois native through and through.
And he's quick to point out that he did
not want to leave Northwestern — a
Big 10 Conference school located about

-15 miles north of Chicago. But with a
high school two-mile state championship
already under his belt, Miller was a
runner who didn't want to pass up on
collegiate competition.
He began looking for a school that
had a challenging academic program,
scholarships and noteworthy track and
cross country teams. Stanford was the
only place that fit the bill.
"Stanford was the only school with
all three, so here I am," Miller says.
And though he's only been here for
two months, he's already a standout on
the Stanford team.
Last week, for instance, he was the
top Cardinal runner in the Pacific 10
Conference Championships, finishing
third overall. Miller ran a quick 31:03
over Stanford's hilly 10-kilometer
course.
Used to the flat Midwestern terrain,
Miller says the Stanford course took
some getting used to. "We've got the
toughest course I've ever run on. But
it's a definite home course advantage I

think," he says. "When you're here, you
can't help but do a lot of hills."
