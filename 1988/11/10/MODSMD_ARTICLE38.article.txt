# Miller runs the right course for Stanford

Imagine this one. A year of college
free of charge. No tuition, no book bill,
no long-term student loans. And what
does the ever-so-lucky student have to
do for this free ride? Absolutely nothing.
Junior Steve Miller, a transfer from
Northwestern University, could have
had this academic paradisio. Instead of
jumping up for joy, Miller told North
western administrators no way.
In April, Miller found out that North
western had decided to cut the school's
cross country and track programs. Be
cause of a prearranged deal, Miller could
finish up his studies there, keep his
scholarship . . . but not run with a col
legiate team.
With strawberry brown hair and a
hint of a Midwestern drawl, Miller is
an Illinois native through and through.
And he's quick to point out that he did
not want to leave Northwestern — a
Big 10 Conference school located about

-15 miles north of Chicago. But with a
high school two-mile state championship
already under his belt, Miller was a
runner who didn't want to pass up on
collegiate competition.
He began looking for a school that
had a challenging academic program,
scholarships and noteworthy track and
cross country teams. Stanford was the
only place that fit the bill.
"Stanford was the only school with
all three, so here I am," Miller says.
And though he's only been here for
two months, he's already a standout on
the Stanford team.
Last week, for instance, he was the
top Cardinal runner in the Pacific 10
Conference Championships, finishing
third overall. Miller ran a quick 31:03
over Stanford's hilly 10-kilometer
course.
Used to the flat Midwestern terrain,
Miller says the Stanford course took
some getting used to. "We've got the
toughest course I've ever run on. But
it's a definite home course advantage I

think," he says. "When you're here, you
can't help but do a lot of hills."
Uphill running wasn't the only
change that took some getting used to.
A self-described "team runner," Miller
explains that his teammates at North
western were athletes he'd known and
competed against since high school.
"It was an Illinois running clique,
filled with Illinois state champions on
a No. 1 all-star team," he says."I miss
those guys."
But Miller seems to have adjusted to
his California team just fine. Rarely
using the"I" word, Miller tends to say
"we" and speaks about the team's ac
complishments as a whole.
"What's best about about cross coun
try is the team aspect. I wouldn't want
to run with anyone else but these guys,"
he says.
At a first look, cross country might
not seem like much of a team sport —
there's no huddle, no passing, no game-
