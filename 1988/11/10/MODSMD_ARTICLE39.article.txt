# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Despite late returns from several states
in the West, with 93 percent of the precincts
reporting, it appears that the soccer teams
have swept The Daily's Athletes of the Week
races.
The sports staff projects that Elise Ed
wards and Chris Porch are this week's win

ners.
Edwards, a 5-foot-ll sophomore from
Madison, Wis., ended a stellar 1988 cam
paign by holding Chico State to one goal
Saturday.
Edwards might have come up with her
13th shutout of the year, but Chico State
scored a controversial goal to open a 1-0 lead.
The Cardinal came back strong with the
help of goals by Jennifer "Rocket" Rowland
and Lisa Sime.
Coach Berhane Andeberhan's charges
finished the season 13-4-2 — a marked con
trast from last year's 4-11-4 record.
Edwards allowed opponents a measly 11
goals for a 0.58 goals-against average.
0 0 0
Porch, a junior from Overland Park, Kan.,
scored two goals in 56 seconds to lead the
Cardinal past Air Force Sunday giving the
team a victory in the Metropolitan Life Soc
cer Tournament in Columbia, S.C.
With 15 minutes to play, the forward took
a long crossing pass to the end line and
tried to cross it himself. He missed the
cross. He hit the net.
Within a blink of an eyelash, the ball was
cleared from Stanford's end and freshman
Rhett Harty passed Porch the ball.
Giving the Air Force goalie an unpleasant
sense of deja vu, Porch pounded in his second
goal in under a minute.
The Cardinal's upset of the Falcons, cou

pled with a 0-0 tie against eighth-ranked
Indiana, capped up an up-and-down year on
a positive note.
