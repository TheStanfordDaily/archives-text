NEW YORK (AP) - Frank
Viola, the Minnesota Twins left
hander who led the major
leagues in victories in compiling
a 24-7 record, was named winner
of the 1988 American League
Cy Young Award on Wednesday.
Viola received 27 of a possible
28 first-place votes and 138 of
a possible 140 points from the
Baseball Writers' Association of
America. Dennis Eckersley of
the Oakland Athletics got the
other first-place vote and was
second with 52 points.
Mark Gubicza of the Kansas
City Royals was third with 26
points, Dave Stewart of Oakland
had 16, Bruce Hurst of the Bos
ton Red Sox had 12 and team
mate Roger Clemens, Cy Young
winner in 1986 and 1987, had
eight.
"I didn't know what to ex
pect," Viola said from his Or
lando, Fla., home. "I didn't want
to worry about it. You don't
want to get your hopes too high
so that they get shot down."
Viola, the first Twins player
to win since Jim Perry in 1970,

said there was no reason to be
upset that he wasn't a unani
mous pick.
"Twenty-seven out of 28,
that's not bad, is it?" he said.
Viola, most valuable player of
the 1987 World Series, had a
2.64 earned-run average this
season and 193 strikeouts,
ranking rank third in the AL in
each department.
"It took me five-plus years to
find this kind of consistency.
This year is just a carryover
from last year," Viola said just
before the season ended. "It's
been a dream. Any pitcher who
tells you he doesn't dream of
winning 20 games or starting
the All-Star Game or winning
the Cy Young is a flat-out liar.
I know that after the season
ends, it will have been a pretty
good year to look back on."
Viola, 15-2 at the break, was
the winning pitcher for the
American League in the All-Star
Game. His 20th victory of the
season came on Aug. 30 against
Texas. It also was the 100 th vic
tory of his career.

"Actually, the goal of winning
100 was more important to me,"
Viola said. "It means you go out
there every fourth day, be con
sistent and stay healthy. I just
hope the next 100 are a little
easier than the first 100."
Viola won 19 consecutive games
in the Metrodome over 25 starts
between May 22, 1987, and last
July 27. And he won two more
home starts during the 1987
World Series.
Twins Manager Tom Kelly
said Viola's performance created
expectations that were impossi
ble to fulfill.
"He doesn't have an 'S' on his
shirt," Kelly said. "A lot of
people around here think he's
Superman and is strong as an
ox every three or four games.
There's just no way."
Although he has settled into
Minnesota life, Viola is a a native
New Yorker and at one time
wanted to play in his hometown.
"I'd be so close to home and
I'd have a chance to make so
much money in commercials,"
he said. "I was MVP of the World

Series in Minnesota last year
and, except for Disney World, I
haven't endorsed anything."
Now he's not so sure he wants
to go home.
"The more I've learned about
baseball organizations, the more
I've realized that it would be
hard to go home again," Viola
said. "We may not get the big
commercial money here in Min
nesota, but we do get some
privacy and some peace of
mind."
He's so well-liked in Minne
apolis that when a poll was held
asking whom the Vikings should
start at quarterback, Viola got
five votes.
"He has a better arm than
both of them," a respondent said,
referring to Tommy Kramer and
Wade Wilson. "And he can't lose
in the Dome."
Viola earned a $100,000 bonus
for winning the Cy Young award,
giving him a $1.6 million income
this year. He made $150,000 in
performance bonuses during the
season in addition to his $1.35
million salary. He gets a $1.55
million base salary next year.
