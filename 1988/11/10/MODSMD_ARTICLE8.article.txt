# Faculty foreshadows Bush's presidency

President Bush. What will he
do? Will the Bush administration
mean a "well-run executive," as
Richard Burress, associate direc
tor of the Hoover Institution has
predicted, or "disaster," English
Prof. Ronald Rebholz's prophesy?
One day after George Bush
defeated Michael Dukakis for the
presidency of the United States,
the mood among Stanford faculty
was mixed.
One point that all agreed on
was the importance the budget
deficit will play in domestic policy
in the next four years.
Political Science Prof. David
Brady said he thinks the budget
will be Bush's first priority and
"it will be messy."
According to Economics Prof.
Michael Boskin, who was an eco
nomic adviser to Bush during the
campaign, Bush will be able to
keep his promise of no new taxes.
Burress expressed the same op
inion. "If the country continues
to be prosperous ... it will mean

that even at reduced tax rates,
more tax dollars will be collected,"
he said.
However, Law Prof. Gerald
Gunther said he doesn't believe
Bush "can seriously stick with
this nonsense of 'watch my lips,' "
referring to Bush's oft-repeated
campaign promise concerning no
new taxes.

According to
Brady, the prob
lem of the deficit
will preclude any
significant addi
tions to social leg
islation. "There is
no money to start
any new pro
grams," Brady
said. "The deficit

is horrendous."
Boskin, who is likely to hold a
post in the new administration,
offered a different opinion. He
predicted that Bush will soon
"move toward very targeted pro
grams to assist needy people."
