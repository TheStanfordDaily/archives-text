# Faculty foreshadows Bush's presidency

### Amy Rosenfeld Staff writer 
President Bush. What will he
do? Will the Bush administration
mean a "well-run executive," as
Richard Burress, associate direc
tor of the Hoover Institution has
predicted, or "disaster," English
Prof. Ronald Rebholz's prophesy?
One day after George Bush
defeated Michael Dukakis for the
presidency of the United States,
the mood among Stanford faculty
was mixed.
One point that all agreed on
was the importance the budget
deficit will play in domestic policy
in the next four years.
Political Science Prof. David
Brady said he thinks the budget
will be Bush's first priority and
"it will be messy."
According to Economics Prof.
Michael Boskin, who was an eco
nomic adviser to Bush during the
campaign, Bush will be able to
keep his promise of no new taxes.
Burress expressed the same op
inion. "If the country continues
to be prosperous ... it will mean

that even at reduced tax rates,
more tax dollars will be collected,"
he said.
However, Law Prof. Gerald
Gunther said he doesn't believe
Bush "can seriously stick with
this nonsense of 'watch my lips,' "
referring to Bush's oft-repeated
campaign promise concerning no
new taxes.

According to
Brady, the prob
lem of the deficit
will preclude any
significant addi
tions to social leg
islation. "There is
no money to start
any new pro
grams," Brady
said. "The deficit

is horrendous."
Boskin, who is likely to hold a
post in the new administration,
offered a different opinion. He
predicted that Bush will soon
"move toward very targeted pro
grams to assist needy people."
Dan Quayle's role as vice pres


Bush
ident is likely to be minimal, the
professors said.
Scott Sagan, assistant professor
of political science, predicted that
"Quayle will visit an awful lot of
foreign airports and attend an aw
ful lot of funerals."
According to Rebholz, "Quayle
makes Bush unimpeachable." In
the next few years, the country
will learn about Bush's actions in
the Iran-Contra affair and "when
it comes out, Congress will be ex
traordinarily afraid to impeach
Bush because they'll be extraor
dinarily frightened of having
Quayle as president," Rebholz
said.
Rebholz added that he thought
this reason was probably a
factor in Bush's choice of Quayle
as a running mate.
Professors also varied greatly
on predictions about Bush's fu
ture appointments both in the jud
icial and executive branch.
In his term as president, Bush
is likely to have the opportunity
to appoint at least three Supreme
Court justices. The three most
liberal justices on the Court will
all be over 80 by the time Bush
takes office and it has been a con
cern of many that Bush's appoint
ments will make the Court ex
tremely conservative.
Rebholz called this "one of the
most important and disturbing
consequences of the election,
which will have a tremendous im
pact on the rights of the individual
in society."
Gunther said he was less con

cerned that Bush would appoint
strong conservatives. "There
won't be a dramatic swing to the
right, in my view," he said.
In terms of appointments to the
executive branch, most professors
thought that Bush would carry
over a few people from Reagan's
administration, but mainly ap
point new people.
"He's been there for eight years
and is familiar with [Reagan'si
people and their work," Burress
said. But "after eight years, there
is a need for new people with
fresh attitudes and viewpoints."
Rebholz, said he "fears continu
ity" from the Reagan administra
tion, and added that he "wouldn't
be surprised if Pat Robertson has
a influence."
In Brady's view, Bush "won't
carry over anybody" from
Reagan's staff. Bush's nomina
tion of James Baker for Secretary
of State yesterday morning is a
"clear and early signal that this
is going to be his administration
and there will be different people,"
Brady said.

to appoint at least three Supreme
Court justices. The three most
liberal justices on the Court will
all be over 80 by the time Bush
takes office and it has been a con
cern of many that Bush's appoint
ments will make the Court ex
tremely conservative.
Rebholz called this "one of the
most important and disturbing
consequences of the election,
which will have a tremendous im
pact on the rights of the individual
in society."
Gunther said he was less con

cerned that Bush would appoint
strong conservatives. "There
won't be a dramatic swing to the
right, in my view," he said.
In terms of appointments to the
executive branch, most professors
thought that Bush would carry
over a few people from Reagan's
administration, but mainly ap
point new people.
"He's been there for eight years
and is familiar with [Reagan'si
people and their work," Burress
said. But "after eight years, there
is a need for new people with
fresh attitudes and viewpoints."
Rebholz, said he "fears continu
ity" from the Reagan administra
tion, and added that he "wouldn't
be surprised if Pat Robertson has
a influence."
In Brady's view, Bush "won't
carry over anybody" from
Reagan's staff. Bush's nomina
tion of James Baker for Secretary
of State yesterday morning is a
"clear and early signal that this
is going to be his administration
and there will be different people,"
Brady said.
