# Large voter turnout bottlenecks balloting
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Beleaguered election officers worked franti
cally Tuesday to deal with the thousands of
voters lined up in polling stations all around
campus.
The reason for the long lines, especially at
El Centro Chicano and the Campus Recreation
building on Bowdoin Street, was an unexpec
tedly large voter turnout. Campus polling sites
didn't have enough booths or staff, said
ZinaLou Dyer, supervisor of polling places and
election officers at the Santa Clara Registrar
of Voters.
The Registrar of Voters was not aware of
the large number registered to vote at Stan
ford. Had the registrar's office known, ac
cording to Dyer, it would have placed more
booths and staffers at the polls.
At one point, a worker at the Campus Rec
reation site "went to White Plaza and said
'help!'," according to Dorothy Black, an elec
tion officer at that poll. She said three students
and a volunteer from the Stanford Democrats
helped out at the station until the poll closed.
The last-minute student volunteers "saved the
day," said Black, and were paid for their work.
Dyer said that between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m.
the polls on campus started to improve. She
said the Santa Clara Registrar of Voters re

ceived calls from the polls at Stanford and
sent a truck with more voting booths and
ballots to relieve the problem.
Dyer said the volunteers who staffed the
polls were "overwhelmed" at the large voter
turnout. One mtyor problem was that the
staffers didn't know what they could do to
speed up the lines that would not invalidate
the voting. For example, some election officers
did not know that it was legal to divide the

voters into two lines according to their last
name in the alphabet.
Tom Palmer, precinct coordinator at the
county registrar's office, said the number of
registered voters in the Campus Recreation
precinct was 796 on Sept. 1 and about 1,539
voters appeared on Election Day. He said that
in the 28 years that he spent working at the
Registrar of Voters, he has never seen such

a dramatic increase in voters.
Those voting at the Campus Recreation site
included residents of Manzanita, Escondido,
Mirrielees, Branner, Toyon and Rains, the
new graduate housing complex.
One of the reasons for the problem at the
Campus Recreation poll is that the county
registrar was unaware of the new graduate
student housing at the Rains Apartments, said
Palmer. The apartments, which house about
800 people, added an unexpected number of
voters that the registrar wasn't prepared for,
he said.
Black said the line there went from the
inside of the building into the parking lot.
She attributed the long line to the fact that
"a lot [of studentsl got a lot more involved"
than previous elections. Black said that, in
contrast, the primary elections on campus
were "pretty dead."
Black added that when the ballots at the
poll began to run out, the voters were directed
to vote on demonstration ballots. She said
the type of ballot didn't matter since all the
ballot cards were read by a machine.
One student, a junior, said she waited at
El Centro for about an hour to vote. She said
the poll didn't have enough booths but that
most people stayed in line to vote.
