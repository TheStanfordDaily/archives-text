ibilitv. all vou have to do is go hack
lo the Fikkl and Agt uultuial Act of
IWBI
lhal year. Congress passed
legislation that would auto
mata allv increase grain target
prices each veai baseil on its as
sumptions lhal inllaiion would
continue at a high rate and that
foreign buyers uuuld bo willing to
pa\ higher and higher prices.
Our export pricing was not
compatible with the changing
world conditions As a result, bil
lions ot dollars were spent on defi
ciency diversion and pavmenl
in kind programs to help bring
supplies in line with demand
Given the fact that we cannot
predict world economic or politi
cal developments with a great deal
more certainty than wo can the
weather, the nation's approach to
farm price supports has simplv
been too rigid U.S. farm policv
must take into consideration Ihe
ups and down of the export market
through flexible support price
programs And grain prices must
be allowed to adapt to market
clearing levels when grain
supplies are high and demand is
low, |ust as thev must be allowed to
rise when supplies are tight and
demand is high
This kind of flexibility will
help keep our exports moving and
maintain our market share when
demand and prices tail And it will
help the nation's farmers produce
with grcatei efficiency, at fuller
capacity and highoi profitability
