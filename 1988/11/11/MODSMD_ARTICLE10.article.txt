ing effects" of press censorship in
['Ms native land yesterday, but
•lisounded a note of cautious op
jljtimism about the spread of glas
'liiost from the reformers in Mos
cow.
•I; Hirschler, editor of the Hun
garian Economic Weekly and a
Knight Journalism Fellow at
Stanford, told an audience of 30
at the Bechtel International Cen

ter that the Soviet Union's policy
of glasnost, or openness, is helping
to slowly roll back press censor
ship in Hungary.
According to Hirschler, until
very recently the Hungarian gov
ernment's policy towards the
press mirrored orthodox Commu
nist Party views in the Soviet Un
ion, namely that the "journalist's
role was as servant to the party."
To combat that servile role,
Hirschler, along with other pro
minent Hungarian journalists and

lawyers, formed the "glasnost
club"in order to fully explore re
forms that would lead to a more
independent press. They in
stituted a comprehensive study on
censorship and freedom of the
press.
After the study, the group rec
ommended immediately ending
party control of the press; ac
knowledging citizens' legal right
to information and right to start
new publications; and breaking
the government's media monopo
ly.

Although there has been some
movement from the government
on these demands, Hirschler
noted that some party officials are
resisting them. While some call
the changes "enlightened
socialism," Hirschler said he
believes that many elements of
party control remain.
He said glasnost represents "the
freedom to be informed and to
express ideas." Without it, he said,
political "power becomes cor
rupt."
