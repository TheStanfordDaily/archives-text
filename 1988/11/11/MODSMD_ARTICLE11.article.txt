SACRAMENTO (AP) - The
state Supreme Court yesterday
temporarily blocked implementa
tion of a voter-adopted measure
cutting California insurance
rates, but the initiative's author
said insurers can't escape the will
of the people with legal battles
and threats of pullouts.
The leaders of the state Legisla
ture said they were considering
whether to ask Gov. George Deuk
mejian for a special emergency
session to deal with the uproar,
according to Bob Forsyth, a press
representative for Senate Presi

dent Pro Tem David Roberti.
"The voters have spoken and
they expect the state Legislature
to implement Proposition 103,"
legislative leaders said in a draft
of a letter to the governor.
Proposition 103 would compel
insurance companies to reduce all
auto insurance premiums to 80
percent of November 1987 rates,
effective for each motorist on
renewal of his or her current
policy, and to reduce premiums
by an additional 20 percent for
motorists with clean driving
records.

It would freeze premiums at
those lower rates for at least two
years.
California voters narrowly ap
proved Proposition 103 on Tues
day, at the same time voting down
four other insurance propositions
sponsored by insurers and trial
lawyers.
In response to three insurance
company lawsuits claiming the
measure is unconstitutional, the
high court issued an order signed
by six of seven justices staying
Proposition 103 indefinitely to al
low time for consideration of the

consumer-sponsored measure
that would cut car, home and busi
ness coverage at least 20 percent.
Nearly 50 insurance companies
responded to the voter revolt
against skyrocketing rates by an
nouncing they would stop writing
certain policies in California.
At least six other insurance
companies, including Aetna Life
& Casualty and Fireman's Fund
Insurance Co., said they have
withdrawn or intend to withdraw
from the auto insurance business
in California as a result of the
passage of Proposition 103.
