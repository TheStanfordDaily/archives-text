## Stealth fighter secrecy lifted Pentagon says Air Force has flown the jet for seven years 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - About 50
radar-evading Stealth jet fighters oper
ate from a remote base in Nevada,
where one went down last year following
the 1986 crash of another in California,
the Pentagon acknowledged yesterday.
Partially lifting a veil of secrecy that
has enveloped the plane from its birth,
the Pentagon said the Air Force has
flown the jets for seven years.
The Pentagon and Air Force released
a photograph of the unusual aircraft,
but declined to discuss its capabilities.
The limited disclosures were made now
because the Air Force needs to start
flying the craft in daylight, a spokesman
said.
The Pentagon said the plane had been
declared operational and ready for war
time missions in October 1953, but that
it first flew in June 1981.
The Stealth fighter "is officially
known as the F-117A," said Dan
Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokes
man.
"It has been operational since October
1983 and is assigned to the 4450 th
Tactical Group at Nellis Air Force Base,
Nev. The aircraft is based at the
Tonopah Test Range Airfield in
Nevada."

The plane is built by the Lockheed
Corp. at a tightly guarded plant in Bur
bank, Calif., the Air Force said. Pro
duction line workers at the Lockheed
plant have gone to court with charges
they are being sickened by exposure to
dangerous chemicals.
The Air Force has ordered 59 of the
planes and 52 of them have been
delivered, Howard said. Three of the
planes have crashed and two pilots have
been killed, the Air Force added.
The very first production model of
the plane crashed with a Lockheed Corp.
pilot at the controls, the Air Force said.
That test pilot survived the accident,
for which no date was given.
The second crash occurred on July
11, 1986, near Bakersfield, Calif., and
the third on Oct. 14, 1987, at Nellis
Air Force Base, the service said. Both
pilots were killed.
The 1986 crash, in Sequoia National
Forest 12 miles northeast of
Bakersfield, drew heavily armed Air
Force guards who sealed off the site
while the wreckage was removed. At
the time, the Air Force refused to con
firm reports the plane was a Stealth,
but identified the dead pilot as Miy.

Ross Mulhare who was based at Nellis.
The photograph released by the Pen
tagon depicts a relatively small, swept
wing plane with a flat underbelly. It
somewhat resembles a sting ray â€” black
or dark blue with no exterior markings.
The cockpit is located far forward in
a nose that comes to a sharp point,
with what appears to be gun barrels or
air-speed probes sticking out.
The plane features a "V" tail atop a
fuselage that ends in a rectangle, ap
parently completely encompassing the
two engines that power the plane. The
air intakes for the engines appear to be
fitted tightly into the sides of the
fuselage, just below the cockpit.
The swept-back wings would suggest
the plane is capable of flying at super
sonic speeds, but the Air Force declined
to discuss the matter. Military sources
have said the plane is designed for sneak
ground attacks and not air-to-air dog
fighting.
To protect its secrecy, the plane has
been flown only at night. But the Air
Force needs to start flying the plane
during daylight if it is to integrate the
squadron's war plans with other units,
Howard said.
