RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil
(AP) — Thousands of strikers
angered by shrinking paychecks
stormed Brazil's biggest steel
mill and hurled rocks and
bombs at police and soldiers.
Two workers were fatally shot
and another was bludgeoned to
death, officials said yesterday.
The confrontation Wednesday
night at the National Steel Com
pany in Volta Redonda, 80 miles
northwest of Rio, was the worst
outburst in a wave of labor un
rest caused by a sputtering eco
nomy under President Jose Sar
ney.
According to the plant's press

office, about 3,000 strikers
armed with rocks, iron bars and
firebombs gathered inside the
plant and refused to leave.
About 800 soldiers and police
tried to disperse the strikers and
were pelted with stones and
firebombs, the office said.
Troops responded with tear gas,
clubs and gunfire, it said.
Jose Carlos Cardoso, director
of the plant's judicial depart
ment, said two strikers were
shot and killed and a third was
beaten to death with a rifle butt.
Plant officials first said five
workers had been killed, but
later amended the figure, saying

a morgue official accidentally in
cluded two criminals among the
dead.
Troops had occupied the plant
Tuesday night after 18,000
steelworkers went on strike for
higher pay and shorter hours.
Soldiers kept blast furnaces run
ning, and tanks were stationed
in front of the gates to maintain
order.
The National Steel Company
produces four million tons of
steel annually, nearly one-fifth
of the nation's total output.
Brazil is Latin America's largest
steel producer and seventh
worldwide.
