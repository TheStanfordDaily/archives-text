DELRAY, Fla. (AP) - George
Bush met yesterday with leaders
of his presidential transition team
and with President Reagan and
the Cabinet before traveling to
Florida for a four-day vacation.
As his presidential campaign
headquarters in Washington was
being dismantled, the president
elect huddled with his chief of
staff, Craig Fuller, and campaign
adviser Robert Teeter, the two
people he named to head the tran
sition effort following his election
victory.
He also attended Reagan's
morning meeting with White
House chief of staff Kenneth
Duberstein and the president's
daily briefing with National Se
curity Adviser Colin Powell.
The president-elect and his wife,
Barbara, arrived late yesterday in
Palm Beach, Fla., where they

were met by Gov. Bob Martinez.
The couple later traveled to the
Delray home of close friend
William Stamps Farish 111, a 49-
year-old multimillionaire who like
Bush made his money in the oil
business.
Upon arriving, Bush declined
to engage in a conversation with
reporters, but when one journalist
shouted, "How's the transition
going?" the president-elect smiled
and said, "Coulin't be going bet
ter."
Barbara Bush chatted briefly
with reporters aboard Air Force
Two, where she related a story
about the tightened security for
the president-elect and his family.
She said that she wanted to take
a walk in a Houston park the
other day and the park was closed
to the public, allowing her to walk
alone. "I'll never walk in a public

park again," she said.
Bush did not take advisers or
staff members with him on what
his aides insisted was primarily a
vacation.
Bush planned to fish and relax
in Delray, Fla. He told reporters
he also intended to spend time on
the telephone as he contemplates
his new administration.
At the afternoon Cabinet meet
ing, the president and Bush
walked in together and were ap
plauded by the assembled mem
bers, said White House spokes
man Marlin Fitzwater.
Fitzwater said Duberstein had
asked all presidential appointees
to submit their resignations to
smooth the way for Bush to name
his own choices when he takes
office. Bush has already named
his secretary of state, longtime
friend and adviser James Baker.
