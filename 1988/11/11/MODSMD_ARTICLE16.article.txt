# Texas to build super collider
## Announcement draws protests from six losing states 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Texas
beat out six other states yesterday
in a high-stakes race to capture
the $4.4 billion superconducting
super collider, which, if Congress
finds the money to build it, would
be the largest scientific instru
ment ever constructed.
The announcement by Energy
Department Secretary John Her
rington drew immediate howls of
protest from losing states, where
officials had waged a years-long
battle to win the giant atom
smasher and the jobs and scien
tific prestige that will accrue to
the project's home state.

"The Texas decision has a
strong smell of White House
politics," said Sen. Donald Riegle,
D-Mich. "We and the other five
finalist states got a raw deal."
Illinois officials also were an
gered, with House Minority
Leader Robert Michel calling on
the president to review Herring
ton's decision declaring Texas the
preferred site for what the depart
ment will name the Ronald
Reagan Center for High Energy
Physics.
Eight senators — Alan Dixon
and Paul Simon of Illinois; Riegle
and Carl Levin of Michigan; Den

nis DeConcini and John McCain
of Arizona; and Tim Wirth and
William Armstrong of Colorado —
asked Reagan to establish a bi
partisan commission of physicists
that would review all seven of the
finalist sites. The others sites are
in North Carolina and Tennessee.
The senators said if the project
"is to have the slightest chance
of being funded," the president
must demonstrate the Texas de
cision "was based solely on scien
tific criteria utilizing a fair, open
and competitive bidding process."
Sen. Jim Sasser said his state
"should be proud of its efforts."
