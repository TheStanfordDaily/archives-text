Oil tanker splits in half and burns
LONDON (AP) — Two burned, empty lifeboats
were found yesterday on an oily patch of the
north Atlantic, but there were no signs of the
27 crewmen from a tanker that broke in two in
stormy seas and burst into flames, searchers said.
A Canadian military plane flew over the
wreckage of the Odyssey and found its bow
"barely afloat," said Paul Kendrick of the
Canadian Search and Rescue Coordination Center
in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
The stern section of the 65,746-ton tanker
sank after the vessel cracked in half. Oil spilled
into the ocean and caught fire, coating the surface
with flames that burned hours later.
Kendrick said none of the Greek and Honduras
crewmen was seen on the bow or in the two
badly burned lifeboats floating in the area. He
said the tanker was also believed to carry two
life rafts.
"If we can't find them, there's not much hope,"
Kendrick said. Photographs taken of the scene

will be analyzed to see if there are any signs of
the crewmen, he said.
The Odyssey, a Liberian-registered vessel, sent
out a distress signal at 3:22 a.m. about 1,000
miles east of Newfoundland, saying it needed
immediate assistance, coast guard officials said.
Two Marine fighter planes collide
YUMA, Ariz. (AP) — A Marine pilot was killed
yesterday when the FA-18 Hornet jet fighter he
was flying collided with a second fighter on a
training flight north of Yuma, a spokesman said.
Staff Sgt. Mark Walker said it was unclear
whether the pilot went down with the single-seat
fighter or ejected. The other pilot was able to
return his damaged plane to the Marine Corps
Air Station at Yuma.
The two jets, assigned to Marine Fighter Attack
Squadron 312 in Beaufort, S.C., collided while
over the Chocolate Mountain training area.
The pilot was taken to a clinic for an exam
ination, Walker said.
