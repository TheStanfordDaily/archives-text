## Where's the offense? 
### 
Coach Elway needs
someone to help him
coordinate the offense

IF JACK ELWAY really wants
to give Stanford a winning foot
ball tradition, he must hire an
offensive coordinator, and soon.
It's first down on the two yard
line. You are beating sixth-ranked
USC 20-17. What would you do?
Cardinal Coach Jack Elway
chose to remain in the one back
set, with Jon Volpe running the
ball. No blocking back, no substitu
tion for Volpe — just give him the
ball three times, run up the middle
and get stopped. And then, attempt
a meaningless field goal that
would accomplish little for the Car
dinal.
The fact that the field goal was
missed is irrelevant. Why attempt
a field goal that would give Stan
ford a six point lead instead of a
three point lead when USC would
obviously play for seven points and
the win?
This questionable decision early
in the year is representative of a
problem that has plagued the Car
dinal all season long. If a few key
decisions were made differently,
the team could easily be 8-1 instead
of 3-5-1.
Jack Elway has done many
things right at Stanford. Both his
recruiting and mid-week coaching
have been above par. As evidenced

by several close contests this year,
the Cardinal certainly has the tal
ent and the heart to be a Pac-10
contender.
But, the lack of an innovative
offense has hampered the Cardi
nal's performance in those key in
stances where quick, correct deci
sions could have caused a different
outcome.
Imagine the momentum a win
over USC would have built.
The simple fact is that Elway
cannot perform all of the respon
sibilities that he has shouldered
this year, and perform them well.
Elway had a reputation for of
fensive wizardry when he was
coaching at San Jose State. Per
haps Elway is not used to the bru
tally competitive environment of
the Pac-10, but with his record at
Stanford well below .500, he needs
to make a change soon.
An offensive coordinator is a
sound investment that will pay for
itself. A coordinator could inject
new life into Stanford's offense,
helping the team to put more
points on the board, win more
games and attract more fans.
With Jason Palumbis maturing
as a quarterback, a returning
Volpe, an increasingly stingy de
fense and a few good recruits, the
Cardinal should be playing for a
bowl bid this time next year.
The only missing ingredient is
an extra mind on the side line to
help build a winning tradition in
Stanford football that might com
pare to the winning tradition in
other sports.
