# Faculty considers 'F' grade Myriad of perceived grading problems perplexes senate
## 
### Eric Grunwald Staff writer 
If you're afraid you might fail
that final, take it anyway. Despite
what you may have heard, 'Fs'
won't start appearing again on
transcripts for at least another
year, if at all.
Although a large majority of
Stanford faculty responded in a
survey on grading in February
that they favored a return to a
grading system with the 'F' op
tion, members of the Faculty Sen
ate expressed widespread disa
greement about Stanford's
grading policies at yesterday's
senate meeting.
Other important issues dis
cussed were the quality of teach
ing assistant instruction and out
of-class midterm scheduling con
flicts, both of which the commit
tee addressed in its report.
Faculty refer to the system with
the 'F', which was abolished in
1969, as an "historical record"
that is opposed to Stanford's pres
ent system, called the "record of
achievement" system, which does
not even record the "NC," or no
credit grade, on transcripts.
The discussion on grading was
prompted by the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achieve-

Reinstituting the 'F'

ment's report on the 1987-88 ac
ademic year. The committee will
consider the senate's comments as
it works to prepare final policy
recommendations for the senate
next June.
In the senate's discussion on
grading policy, Chemistry Prof.
James Collman came out strongly
in favor of an 'F' system, adding
that many of his colleagues also
favor it.
"Students don't develop as
much discipline as they might"
during their undergraduate
careers, Collman said, when they
know that 'Fs' won't appear on
transcripts. He added that 15 per
cent of students fail in any given
class, a rate he claimed is much
too high.
But English Prof. Ronald Reb
holz responded sharply to Col
lman, saying "students are al
ready under intense pressure" at
Stanford. Reinstituting the 'F'

would have a "terrible psycholog
ical impact on our students," Reb
holz said.
One professor felt that the great
'F' debate was missing the point.
Stephen Krasner, professor of
political science, said 'Fs' are not
the issue, but grade inflation is.
Statistics in the report confirm
his long-held belief that grade in
flation is rampant at Stanford,
Krasner said. "Thirty-five percent
of students are getting 'As', while
6 percent are getting 'Cs'," he
pointed out.
The report, however, found no
"significant trend toward grade
inflation" at Stanford.
Communications Prof. Henry
Breitrose reminded the senate
that much of the reason the 'F'
was abolished was to combat "nar
rowness and careerism" in under
graduate education and to "give
undergraduates some possibility
of being entrepreneurial" in
taking classes without fear that
doing poorly would blemish their
transcripts.
ASSU Senate Chair David
Porter echoed this sentiment, say
ing, "Students will take more risks
if they know they won't get an
'F' or even a «D\" •
One intriguing idea was raised
by Mathematics Prof. Robert
Osserman, who suggested that the
committee consider a compromise
in which students would receive
an 'NC' rather than an 'F' on
their transcript.
Asked if the committee was con
sidering revising Stanford's drop
policy, in which students can drop
a class any time until 24 hours
before the final, committee chair
David Wellbery replied that it was
not, but that it may investigate
the policy this year.
And on the issue of TAs, the
committee found that overall stu
dent satisfaction with TA instruc
tion is "much lower than it should

be." The report cited a survey of
Twain residents in which 45 per
cent of the students expressed
"disappointment" with TAs.
Responding to charges that TA
salaries have been cut, Vice
Provost Elizabeth Traugott said
the salaries are fixed but that TAs
may receive a cut in the amount
of work they do, and thus the
amount of money they can make.
English Prof. George Dekker
said he is concerned about a sug
gestion that each department sub
mit a plan next spring on how it
will train and evaluate TAs in the
following year.
"I am troubled by the bureau
cratic implications" of the recom
mendation, Dekker said, adding
that he doubted the problem is
systemic throughout the Univer
sity and that it doesn't require

"regimentation."
But Education Prof. Denis Phil
lips, who studied the quality of
TA instruction, reaffirmed the
committee's belief in a hands-off
philosophy by the administration,
allowing departments as much
automony as possible.
The departmental plans would
not be required to meet any par
ticular guidelines, Phillips ex
plained, and would function
ply as a "spur to the memory",
reminding departments that they
should be thinking about training.
On the subject of midterms,
committee chair Wellbery said the
committee is considering finding
times for out-of-class midterms
that are more convenient for stu
dents, and requiring professors to
give advanced notice in the Time
Schedule of midterm schedules.

committee is considering finding
times for out-of-class midterms
that are more convenient for stu
dents, and requiring professors to
give advanced notice in the Time
Schedule of midterm schedules.
If you're afraid you might fail
that final, take it anyway. Despite
what you may have heard, 'Fs'
won't start appearing again on
transcripts for at least another
year, if at all.
Although a large majority of
Stanford faculty responded in a
survey on grading in February
that they favored a return to a
grading system with the 'F' op
tion, members of the Faculty Sen
ate expressed widespread disa
greement about Stanford's
grading policies at yesterday's
senate meeting.
Other important issues dis
cussed were the quality of teach
ing assistant instruction and out
of-class midterm scheduling con
flicts, both of which the commit
tee addressed in its report.
Faculty refer to the system with
the 'F', which was abolished in
1969, as an "historical record"
that is opposed to Stanford's pres
ent system, called the "record of
achievement" system, which does
not even record the "NC," or no
credit grade, on transcripts.
The discussion on grading was
prompted by the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achieve-

ment's report on the 1987-88 ac
ademic year. The committee will
consider the senate's comments as
it works to prepare final policy
recommendations for the senate
next June.
In the senate's discussion on
grading policy, Chemistry Prof.
James Collman came out strongly
in favor of an 'F' system, adding
that many of his colleagues also
favor it.
"Students don't develop as
much discipline as they might"
during their undergraduate
careers, Collman said, when they
know that 'Fs' won't appear on
transcripts. He added that 15 per
cent of students fail in any given
class, a rate he claimed is much
too high.
But English Prof. Ronald Reb
holz responded sharply to Col
lman, saying "students are al
ready under intense pressure" at
Stanford. Reinstituting the 'F'

would have a "terrible psycholog
ical impact on our students," Reb
holz said.
One professor felt that the great
'F' debate was missing the point.
Stephen Krasner, professor of
political science, said 'Fs' are not
the issue, but grade inflation is.
Statistics in the report confirm
his long-held belief that grade in
flation is rampant at Stanford,
Krasner said. "Thirty-five percent
of students are getting 'As', while
6 percent are getting 'Cs'," he
pointed out.
The report, however, found no
"significant trend toward grade
inflation" at Stanford.
Communications Prof. Henry
Breitrose reminded the senate
that much of the reason the 'F'
was abolished was to combat "nar
rowness and careerism" in under
graduate education and to "give
undergraduates some possibility
of being entrepreneurial" in
taking classes without fear that
doing poorly would blemish their
transcripts.
ASSU Senate Chair David
Porter echoed this sentiment, say
ing, "Students will take more risks
if they know they won't get an
'F' or even a «D\" •
One intriguing idea was raised
by Mathematics Prof. Robert
Osserman, who suggested that the
committee consider a compromise
in which students would receive
an 'NC' rather than an 'F' on
their transcript.
Asked if the committee was con
sidering revising Stanford's drop
policy, in which students can drop
a class any time until 24 hours
before the final, committee chair
David Wellbery replied that it was
not, but that it may investigate
the policy this year.
And on the issue of TAs, the
committee found that overall stu
dent satisfaction with TA instruc
tion is "much lower than it should

be." The report cited a survey of
Twain residents in which 45 per
cent of the students expressed
"disappointment" with TAs.
Responding to charges that TA
salaries have been cut, Vice
Provost Elizabeth Traugott said
the salaries are fixed but that TAs
may receive a cut in the amount
of work they do, and thus the
amount of money they can make.
English Prof. George Dekker
said he is concerned about a sug
gestion that each department sub
mit a plan next spring on how it
will train and evaluate TAs in the
following year.
"I am troubled by the bureau
cratic implications" of the recom
mendation, Dekker said, adding
that he doubted the problem is
systemic throughout the Univer
sity and that it doesn't require

"regimentation."
But Education Prof. Denis Phil
lips, who studied the quality of
TA instruction, reaffirmed the
committee's belief in a hands-off
philosophy by the administration,
allowing departments as much
automony as possible.
The departmental plans would
not be required to meet any par
ticular guidelines, Phillips ex
plained, and would function
ply as a "spur to the memory",
reminding departments that they
should be thinking about training.
