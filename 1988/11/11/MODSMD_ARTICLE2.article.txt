# Faculty considers 'F' grade Myriad of perceived grading problems perplexes senate
## 
### Eric Grunwald Staff writer 
If you're afraid you might fail
that final, take it anyway. Despite
what you may have heard, 'Fs'
won't start appearing again on
transcripts for at least another
year, if at all.
Although a large majority of
Stanford faculty responded in a
survey on grading in February
that they favored a return to a
grading system with the 'F' op
tion, members of the Faculty Sen
ate expressed widespread disa
greement about Stanford's
grading policies at yesterday's
senate meeting.
Other important issues dis
cussed were the quality of teach
ing assistant instruction and out
of-class midterm scheduling con
flicts, both of which the commit
tee addressed in its report.
Faculty refer to the system with
the 'F', which was abolished in
1969, as an "historical record"
that is opposed to Stanford's pres
ent system, called the "record of
achievement" system, which does
not even record the "NC," or no
credit grade, on transcripts.
The discussion on grading was
prompted by the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achieve-

ment's report on the 1987-88 ac
ademic year. The committee will
consider the senate's comments as
it works to prepare final policy
recommendations for the senate
next June.
In the senate's discussion on
grading policy, Chemistry Prof.
James Collman came out strongly
in favor of an 'F' system, adding
that many of his colleagues also
favor it.
"Students don't develop as
much discipline as they might"
during their undergraduate
careers, Collman said, when they
know that 'Fs' won't appear on
transcripts. He added that 15 per
cent of students fail in any given
class, a rate he claimed is much
too high.
But English Prof. Ronald Reb
holz responded sharply to Col
lman, saying "students are al
ready under intense pressure" at
Stanford. Reinstituting the 'F'

would have a "terrible psycholog
ical impact on our students," Reb
holz said.
One professor felt that the great
'F' debate was missing the point.
Stephen Krasner, professor of
political science, said 'Fs' are not
the issue, but grade inflation is.
Statistics in the report confirm
his long-held belief that grade in
flation is rampant at Stanford,
Krasner said. "Thirty-five percent
of students are getting 'As', while
6 percent are getting 'Cs'," he
pointed out.
The report, however, found no
"significant trend toward grade
inflation" at Stanford.
Communications Prof. Henry
Breitrose reminded the senate
that much of the reason the 'F'
was abolished was to combat "nar
rowness and careerism" in under
graduate education and to "give
undergraduates some possibility
of being entrepreneurial" in
taking classes without fear that
doing poorly would blemish their
transcripts.
ASSU Senate Chair David
Porter echoed this sentiment, say
ing, "Students will take more risks
if they know they won't get an
'F' or even a «D\" •
