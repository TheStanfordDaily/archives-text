"If, at the time fixed for the beginning
of the term of the President, the President
elect shall have died, the Vice President
elect shall become President."
— Amendment XX, U.S. Constitution
George bush won the white
House in a mudslide on Tuesday,
and we all wish him well as our
41st President. A toast. To your health
and long life, Skippy — four years longer,
at the very least.
Boy, do we ever wish him well. Wall
Street will have to coin some new slogans.
Instead of "When E.F. Hutton talks,
people listen," we can expect to hear:
"When George Bush gets the sniffles,
people sell"
Can a Bush mandate be found
anywhere in the campaign compost?
Maybe. The people have spoken, George.
Read our lips: no new taxes. Don't join
the ACLU. Don't let violent prisoners out
on furloughs; rather, fry them. And
Pledge that old Allegiance 'til it hurts.
With the loss of their fifth of the last
six elections, another Democratic party
internal feud has begun to rumble; a
full-scale eruption is dead ahead. As Mor
ton Kondracke recently remarked in The
New Republic, it will begin on notes of
ironic agreement. All factions of Demo
crats, be they conservative, moderate or
liberal, will justly blame Dukakis and his
slicko advisers for blowing a quite win
nable election. They all agree, though,
that Bush will prove to be their perfect
foil, the Hoover of the 90s; one of them
gets to play the part of FDR.
Here the agreement ends and the cater

wauling commences. For the next logical
question to be answered is how to win
in '92? Left and Right alike will insist
that the party must move in their direc
tion.
The Jesse Jackson wing of the party
will sharply rebuke Dukakis for what it
saw as his ideological dodge: running
away from the liberal label in August
and September, resulting (they say) in
his 30-point slip in the polls. The Left's
most potent fuel comes from the final
week of the campaign, when the Duke
went for broke. He fessed up to being
the L-word, turned up his Passion Dial
from 2 to 4, and shot up in the polls.
Ergo, say liberal Democrats, the voters
want a liberal candidate, and if Dukakis
had run as one all along, he'd be bound
for Washington right now instead of for
Brookline.
Despite his irritated denials that he is
already running for the 1992 nomination,
Jackson must be seen as the left's current
favorite. Moreover, he is running. He
was running last week when he held forth
in White Plaza. He was running on Tues
day night, and showed it by telephoning
George Bush to congratulate him but not
calling Mike Dukakis at all — thus re
turning the snub Dukakis gave him back
at the Atlanta convention.
Party centrists and conservatives, of
course, will have none of any leftward
shift. Such a stratagem has been tried
before, by the British Labour Party since
1979, with pathetic results. Conservative
Democrats — dubbed "the Rhett Butler
brigade" by Jacksonian Ann Lewis —
believe that the candidate and platform

of the 1988 Democrats were simply too
liberal for American tastes, arid that Du
kakis yielded too much to Jackson at the
Democratic National Convention; only a
shift to the right, then, can promise any
improvement on this year's results.
Conservatives will particularly attack
the flawed nominating process, which
forces moderate and even right-wing
Democrats to try to out-liberal each
other. It was lowa and the gamut of
left-wing activists who dominate the cam
paign there, after all, that induced Du
kakis to whip out his ACLU card and to
boast of being a "progressive, liberal
Democrat," acts which gave George Bush
fuel for knockout political punches in the
endgame. Every other candidate — with
the exception of A 1 Gore — danced that
old lowa left-step too, much to the palm
rubbing delight of Republicans at the
time.
While the standard-bearer of the
Democratic Left is already well-known to
be Jackson, the same job for the Center
and Right is currently up for grabs. Look
for Gore, Bill Bradley, Sam Nunn, Mario
Cuomo, Dick Gephardt and perhaps
Arkansas governor Bill Clinton to start
acting statesmanlike and quietly raising
money by late '89. . .

elect shall have died, the Vice President
elect shall become President."
— Amendment XX, U.S. Constitution
George bush won the white
House in a mudslide on Tuesday,
and we all wish him well as our
41st President. A toast. To your health
and long life, Skippy — four years longer,
at the very least.
Boy, do we ever wish him well. Wall
Street will have to coin some new slogans.
Instead of "When E.F. Hutton talks,
people listen," we can expect to hear:
"When George Bush gets the sniffles,
people sell"
Can a Bush mandate be found
anywhere in the campaign compost?
Maybe. The people have spoken, George.
Read our lips: no new taxes. Don't join
the ACLU. Don't let violent prisoners out
on furloughs; rather, fry them. And
Pledge that old Allegiance 'til it hurts.
With the loss of their fifth of the last
six elections, another Democratic party
internal feud has begun to rumble; a
full-scale eruption is dead ahead. As Mor
ton Kondracke recently remarked in The
New Republic, it will begin on notes of
ironic agreement. All factions of Demo
crats, be they conservative, moderate or
liberal, will justly blame Dukakis and his
slicko advisers for blowing a quite win
nable election. They all agree, though,
that Bush will prove to be their perfect
foil, the Hoover of the 90s; one of them
gets to play the part of FDR.
Here the agreement ends and the cater

wauling commences. For the next logical
question to be answered is how to win
in '92? Left and Right alike will insist
that the party must move in their direc
tion.
The Jesse Jackson wing of the party
will sharply rebuke Dukakis for what it
saw as his ideological dodge: running
away from the liberal label in August
and September, resulting (they say) in
his 30-point slip in the polls. The Left's
most potent fuel comes from the final
week of the campaign, when the Duke
went for broke. He fessed up to being
the L-word, turned up his Passion Dial
from 2 to 4, and shot up in the polls.
Ergo, say liberal Democrats, the voters
want a liberal candidate, and if Dukakis
had run as one all along, he'd be bound
for Washington right now instead of for
Brookline.
Despite his irritated denials that he is
already running for the 1992 nomination,
Jackson must be seen as the left's current
favorite. Moreover, he is running. He
was running last week when he held forth
in White Plaza. He was running on Tues
day night, and showed it by telephoning
George Bush to congratulate him but not
calling Mike Dukakis at all — thus re
turning the snub Dukakis gave him back
at the Atlanta convention.
Party centrists and conservatives, of
course, will have none of any leftward
shift. Such a stratagem has been tried
before, by the British Labour Party since
1979, with pathetic results. Conservative
Democrats — dubbed "the Rhett Butler
brigade" by Jacksonian Ann Lewis —
believe that the candidate and platform

of the 1988 Democrats were simply too
liberal for American tastes, arid that Du
kakis yielded too much to Jackson at the
Democratic National Convention; only a
shift to the right, then, can promise any
improvement on this year's results.
Conservatives will particularly attack
the flawed nominating process, which
forces moderate and even right-wing
Democrats to try to out-liberal each
other. It was lowa and the gamut of
left-wing activists who dominate the cam
paign there, after all, that induced Du
kakis to whip out his ACLU card and to
boast of being a "progressive, liberal
Democrat," acts which gave George Bush
fuel for knockout political punches in the
endgame. Every other candidate — with
the exception of A 1 Gore — danced that
old lowa left-step too, much to the palm
rubbing delight of Republicans at the
time.
While the standard-bearer of the
Democratic Left is already well-known to
be Jackson, the same job for the Center
and Right is currently up for grabs. Look
for Gore, Bill Bradley, Sam Nunn, Mario
Cuomo, Dick Gephardt and perhaps
Arkansas governor Bill Clinton to start
acting statesmanlike and quietly raising
money by late '89. . .
