## Operation Rescue anti-abortionists use violent tactics 
### 
I AM writing in response to Janice
and Joyce Keen's Nov. 3 letter
supporting "Operation Rescue," an
anti-abortion organization. In their
letter, the writers compare their
group's actions to the historic, bitter
struggle for racial equality: . .was it
not the illegal efforts of the under
ground railroad which delivered slaves
to freedom?" This is sheer hypocrisy.
First, Operation Rescue calls itself
"peaceful" and "non-violent." In truth,
Operation Rescue followers are ordered
to appear non-violent on camera. But
when Operation Rescue attacked the
Family Planning Alternatives clinic in
Sunnyvale on Oct. 29, even cameras
did not stop the physical abuse of
pro-choice activists by followers of

"non-violent" Operation Rescue.
In Sunnyvale, 35 pro-choice women
and men locked arms, attempting to
hold open the clinic door so that
patients could get their treatment.
They were rushed by 400 "peaceful"
anti-abortionists. Operation Rescue
leaders (who were apparently all men)
sent the biggest, strongest men out in
front, who promptly proceeded to
pummel their way through the pro
choice activists.
In the Oct. 31 Daily, anti-abortionist
Jennifer Bryson "conceded that there
was some pushing and shoving."
Bryson and Operation Rescue appar
ently forgot to mention that the pro
choice supporters sustained a dislocated

knee, broken glasses and innumerable
bruises among them. The pro-choice
activists, as invited guests of the clinic,
were assaulted; private property, in the
form of fences and greenery, was
destroyed. So much for "non-violence."
I support the right of individuals
and groups to oppose abortion, by any
peaceful means at their disposal. Un
like Operation Rescue, I trust human
beings' ability to make moral judg
ments for themselves, to choose.
I only wish that Operation Rescue
followers, instead of assaulting pro
choice activists, instead of harassing
women already under tremendous
stress, would listen to their own litera
ture, which preaches peace.

In the Nov. 2 New York Times, civil
rights leader Julian Bond writes:
"Operation Rescue, you're no civil
rights movement. The civil rights
movement wanted to extend constitu
tional rights to all Americans. Opera
tion Rescue wants to deny those rights
to one class of citizens: women. The
civil rights demonstrators faced taunts
and threats. Today's anti-abortionists
taunt and threaten those who brave
picket lines. The civil rights movement
fought for the right to cast a vote. The
anti-abortionists want to cast women's
votes for them. Give us back our
history, Operation Rescue, and make
your own."
