# Police on campus should re-evaluate their priorities
## 
### 
On Oct. 29 just afer 9 p.m., I was
"pulled over" on my bike on Santa
Ynez, just after crossing Mayfield Ave.
Two uniformed Santa Clara County
Sheriffs officers then proceeded to give
me a citation for running through a
stop sign on my bike.
I am not writing about the officers'
decision to give me a citation. Rather,
I am writing about their decision to
spend 35 to 40 minutes doing so.
With blue lights flashing, and a red
light and the car highlights shining on
me, they asked me everything from
where I lived last year to where I live
in Hawaii to whether or not roommate
would witness that I had just left the
house. My answers were confirmed
with the Stanford police, just in case I
had memorized someone else's infor-

mation and was lying to them. They
spent all of this time over a bike cita
tion.
On the Saturday of Halloween week
end when there were surely countless
parties taking place on campus,
couldn't the time of these two officers
have been better spent? Why not worry
about intoxicated students coming from
these parties who might hurt them
selves or others? Or, why not concen
trate on making the campus safe for a
woman to walk alone at night?
Just a few weeks ago, a Stanford
woman was "roughed up" while she
was walking along Campus Drive.
Though The Daily wasn't specific as to
exactly what happened, the three men
who harassed her obviously committed
a crime.
It was not her fault, but perhaps she
was "roughed up" because the police
officers patrolling Campus Drive that
night were "busy" on some side street
giving a citation to a cyclist.
Maybe the priorities of the police
department should be re-evaluated in
order to protect the students, instead

of wasting the students' and the police
department's time.
