# Teaching assistant salaries are too small to be cut
## 
### 
I was appalled to read the headline,
"TA's may face salary cutbacks" (Dai
ly, Nov. 4). I hope someone has been
misunderstood or misquoted, but under
no circumstances should our already
underpaid teaching assistants face
reductions in compensation.
TA's are extremely important in
maintaining high-quality undergraduate
education at Stanford. In many large
courses the TA's are the most impor
tant factor in determining the quality
of the course.
A case in point is the Human Biol
ogy core courses. I'm sure my col-

leagues who teach with me in these
courses would agree. I do not debate
the claim that Humanities and
Sciences has a budgetary problem, and
has gone into red ink in the area of
TA salaries. I would argue that this iÂ»
either due to inadequate initial
budgetary allocation or due to poor
management by departments. It is
definitely not due to the TA's being
overpaid.
Departments should make responsible
decisions on criteria for assigning TA's
to courses. A seminar for 10 students
should not require a TA for example.
But once realistic TA allocations are
made, the required funds must be
made available.
Humanities and Sciences, or individ
ual departments, should not balance
budgets by reducing TA salaries. There
are other places for cost-cutting before
striking at such an important compo
nent of the main mission of the Uni
versity.
