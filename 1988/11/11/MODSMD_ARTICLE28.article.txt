## The 						sans-bikelight blues 
### 
I think we should all take a few
moments today to stop and reflect upon
the nice job the Stanford Police De
partment is doing to promote Bicycle
Safety Awareness Month here on
campus.
The way I learned that this is Bicycle
Safety Awareness Month — and I am
not making any of this up — is that
I was issued Sheriffs Department Cita
tion No. M 317975 at 12:20 a.m. last
Monday by Officer #13056968 because
I violated Section No. 21200 (A)/21201
(D) of the vehicle code. Namely, biking
at night without a light.
The actual law reads as follows:
Civic Vehicle Code, Section No. 21200
(AV21201 (D)
1. Thou shalt not biketh at night
without a light or the Police will giveth
you a ticket, and passers-by who are
also biking without lights will snick
ereth at you for getting caught.
2. Thou shalt registereth your bike
at Tresidder Union.
3. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
This being the second time I had
ever been stopped by a policeman, I
was accustomed to dealing with officers
of the law. In more casual situations,
such as hanging out with friends or
being circumcised, I am usually a
joking, fun-loving kinda guy, but when
facing down the flashlight of a uni
formed officer I become Miss Manners:
"Oh, thank you, Officer, for issuing
this citation to me. I am so glad to be
punished for perpetrating such a
serious offense, and will let this serve
as a reminder of my wrongdoings. And
while you're here, would you mind sug
gesting a few ways in which I could
better equip my bicycle for safer
nighttime riding?"
Of course, the officer never hears
this, because while I am reciting it my
voice is being drowned out by (choose
one):
• Screams of people being attacked
by Known Campus Sex Perverts.
• The screeches from the tires of
cars being driven down Campus Drive
at the same speed achieved by
neutrinos in the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator.
• Fun-filled squeals of delight com
ing from several of the better-known

fraternities, where no hazing is occur
ing despite the fac£ that several active
members are preparing to light the
pledges on fire.
My first encounter with a policeman
occurred last year when I was driving
from Stanford to Oregon. It was 10:30
at night, and there was nobody else on
the road, so I did what any normal
safe nighttime driver would do — I
started swerving from lane to lane to
see if it was as much fun as in"The
Dukes of Hazard." (It was.)
Soon a pair of bright headlights ap
peared behind me from nowhere as if
by magic (or, as if the headlights
belonged to a State Trooper who had
been sitting behind a clump of trees
with a radar gun).
"What is a car doing pulling out be
hind me as if by magic?" I thought to
myself, having earlier put my brain in
the glove compartment for safekeeping.
"I'll have to speed up so as to get away
from it."
So I cranked the car up to 75, and
was annoyed when the headlights kept
pace. I swerved from lane to lane a
few more times to try to scare the
headlights off, but they were not
scared. In fact, moments later they
pulled up close as if to pass, but instead
of passing turned into bright flashing
red and blue lights, which is the In
ternational Signal Code for "Extremely
Moronic Person Ahead."
This officer was a kindly old
gentleman, and he asked to see my
license and registration. I gave him the
license from my wallet, and found the


lips on Adulthood
Andrew Berkowitz
registration underneath my brain
in the glove compartment.
"Do you know how fast you
were going?" he asked. (Policemen
are trained by the same person
who trained your mother. They
never just come out and tell you
what you did wrong, as in "What
weren't you supposed to smear on
your sister?")
"Sixty-five," I lied. (Helpful
hint: ALWAYS claim you were
going the speed limit, even if you
just had your tires shot out in a
high-speed chase.)
"I clocked you going 74," he
said, "but I'm only going to give
you a ticket for 'Failure to main
tain a single lane of traffic.' Why
were you swerving so much?"
This is where you reach deep
into the very heart of your B.S.
ability — the same stuff you reach
for in English classes — and come
up with the excuse that will get
you off scot-free.
"Gee, Officer," I said in my best
incarnation of Miss Manners, "I
was going so darned fast that I
didn't feel I could safely keep the
car in one lane."
I wrote a check for $45 to the
Judicial Court of Oregon the next
day.
