# Portia of Pacific: an unmasked legacy
## Law prof. delves into life and times of California's first female attorney 
### Marina Krakovsky 
Clara Shortridge Foltz fought a male
dominated legal system, published her
own journals, and engaged in business
ventures rarely explored by women at
the turn of the century.
"Wherever she went . . . she was 'pro
minent,' " writes Stanford's first woman
law professor, Barbara Babcock, about
Foltz (1849-1934), California's first
woman lawyer.
Although an important figure in her
day, Foltz's tangible legacy apparently
died with her, as Babcock has discov
ered, and few private records of her
activities remain.
Babcock is currently researching a
biography of Foltz, which she expects
to complete within five to 10 years, and
has written an article entitled "Recon
structing the Person: The Case of Clara
Shortridge Foltz," soon to be published.
Babcock's work, confronting the prob
lem of piecing together a coherent bio
graphical portrait based only on public
records, has turned into an all
consuming fascination with this unus
ual woman.
Foltz was not only the first woman
admitted to the California Bar, but also
the first person to conceive the idea of
a public defender for indigents accused
of crime, now a standard of the legal
process.
Babcock first heard of Foltz three
years ago, at the time of the anniversary
of the Public Defender's Office.
As soon as Babcock discovered Foltz,
she was naturally drawn to her. Babcock
herself had been a public defender in
Washington, D.C., before coming to
Stanford, and Foltz, in her day, had
worked to implement the original con
cept of public defense through legisla
tion in 30 states.
Why had Babcock, Stanford's first
woman law professor and first woman
to hold an endowed chair at the Law
School, never heard of this "first wom
an" — first woman notary public, first
woman to counsel a legislative commit
tee, first woman deputy district attorney
— considering the parallels between
them?
Although "public defenders in Califor
nia have heard of her," few others in
the country recognize Foltz's name, ac

cording to Babcock.
In her time, "there wouldn't have
been any people at Stanford who hadn't
heard of her," says Babcock. Against
Foltz's own wishes, time has obscured
the life and works of this formerly pro
minent Californian.
Who was Clara Shortridge Foltz, other
than being the first woman lawyer in
the state? In her day, she was hailed
as the "Portia of the Pacific," an analogy
to Shakespeare's judicious heroine in
"The Merchant of Venice" and an ap
propriate epithet for one side of her
persona.

If she did not argue for mercy above
justice, then she fought for morality
above legality. She worked to enact laws
challenging social convention and pro
moting equal rights.
After reading law in the office of a
San Jose attorney in the early 1870s,
she drafted the Woman Lawyer's Bill,
which provided that any person of good
moral character might be admitted to
the bar. A state senator, formerly mayor
of San Jose, introduced the bill into the
state legislature.
In September 1878, after lobbying for
the bill in Sacramento, Foltz became the
first woman lawyer in California, more
than three decades before the state gave
women the right to vote.

Soon after that victory, Foltz and her
friend Laura Gordon, California's sec
ond woman lawyer, applied for admis
sion to Hastings, California's first law
school.
This initiated another uphill battle,
because the school's board of directors
ruled against admitting women, wary
they would distract the men. Foltz and
Gordon triumphed, however, for they
brought a suit against Hastings and won
in the trial court and in the California
Supreme Court as well.
At the start of her legal practice, when
she was still viewed as a pariah in the
legal profession, Foltz attracted only
clients desperate enough to come to a
woman lawyer — poor people accused
of crime. From her experience in this
position, Foltz conceived the idea of a
public defender — "a radical idea at the
time," according to Babcock.
Once Foltz had found some recogni
tion, she was hired as the prosecuting
attorney in a murder case in which the
attorney for the defense was none other
than Gordon, her colleague and friend.
Despite efforts by the press to over
dramatize the women's adversarial
courtroom roles, Foltz and Gordon re
mained friends, addressing each other
in court as "my sister-in-law."
The case found particular public at
tention and stirred interest because one
of the traditional arguments against
women lawyers was they would have
"undue influence on the jury." With
women lawyers on both sides, this case
once again broke all the rules.
Though it seems to Babcock that
everything Foltz did was "sort of spec
tacular," it is unclear what the
groundbreaking lawyer's true goals
were. In California, she not only prac
ticed law, but went to San Diego during
the 1887 real estate boom, where she
published a daily paper. In New York
in 1895, where she also entered the bar,
she sued a restaurant that refused serv
ice to unescorted women.
In 1896, she started the Clara Foltz
Gold Mining Company. Babcock calls
this one of the "nuggets," in her con
tinuing treasure hunt for information
on Foltz.
As if her activities in New York and


Clara Shortridge Foltz
California were not enough,
Foltz went to Denver, where she
practiced law and helped start a
magazine called "The Mecca."
Foltz considered Colorado, where
women's suffrage was accorded
in 1895, a "mecca for all civilized
men and women."
A great suffragist, she "had
no overarching sense of mission
so pure that it overrode all per
sonal ambition," says Babcock.
Yet Foltz had clearly striven
for immortality. "Modesty should
hardly prevent me from suggest
ing that my name must neces
sarily 'go over the top'," she
wrote in"The Struggles and Tri
umphs of a Woman Lawyer," a
regular feature published in her
own magazine "The New Amer
ican Woman."
Part of the reason her predic
tion went unfulfilled may have
been her own efforts to obscure
certain aspects of her life. In par
ticular, she hid the fact she was
divorced at age 30, after eloping
at age 15. She told the New York
Times in 1897 that she was "left
a widow while she was still young
with five children to support."
Babcock argues it is possible that
Foltz presented herself as a
widow to prevent people from

thinking that her pursuit of law
destroyed her marriage.
Eventually, her attempts to
obscure triumphed over "her
yearning for immortality," ac
cording to Babcock. Foltz herself
did not save her private papers
in a library or archives. Four of
her children predeceased her,
and the fifth, Virginia, never had
children of her own. Although,
according to Babcock "she had
a lot of friends," none preserved
her papers.
But Foltz's complexity does
not keep Babcock from identify
ing with the maverick woman or
persevering in her search. "It's
like a great treasure hunt to me;
because I keep thinking I'm
going to find [her papers] some
day." In her office, she is sur
rounded by Foltz: Newspaper
clippings and photographs cover
walls and bookshelves.
She says she thinks about
Foltz when deciding whether she
should do something. At first un
certain about whether she should
go to Washington to give tes
timony in opposition of Supreme
Court nominee Robert Bork, the
memory of Foltz inspired her to
go "because I knew she would
do it."
Foltz's influence on Babcock
has extended beyond this inci
dent. "It really has changed my
life," Babcock says.

Clara Shortridge Foltz fought a male
dominated legal system, published her
own journals, and engaged in business
ventures rarely explored by women at

"Wherever she went . . . she was 'pro
minent,' " writes Stanford's first woman
law professor, Barbara Babcock, about
Foltz (1849-1934), California's first
woman lawyer.
Although an important figure in her
day, Foltz's tangible legacy apparently
died with her, as Babcock has discov
ered, and few private records of her
activities remain.
Babcock is currently researching a
biography of Foltz, which she expects
to complete within five to 10 years, and
has written an article entitled "Recon
structing the Person: The Case of Clara
Shortridge Foltz," soon to be published.
Babcock's work, confronting the prob
lem of piecing together a coherent bio
graphical portrait based only on public
records, has turned into an all
consuming fascination with this unus
ual woman.
Foltz was not only the first woman
admitted to the California Bar, but also
the first person to conceive the idea of
a public defender for indigents accused
of crime, now a standard of the legal
process.
Babcock first heard of Foltz three
years ago, at the time of the anniversary
of the Public Defender's Office.
As soon as Babcock discovered Foltz,
she was naturally drawn to her. Babcock
herself had been a public defender in
Washington, D.C., before coming to
Stanford, and Foltz, in her day, had
worked to implement the original con
cept of public defense through legisla
tion in 30 states.
Why had Babcock, Stanford's first
woman law professor and first woman
to hold an endowed chair at the Law
School, never heard of this "first wom
an" — first woman notary public, first
woman to counsel a legislative commit
tee, first woman deputy district attorney
— considering the parallels between
them?
Although "public defenders in Califor
nia have heard of her," few others in
the country recognize Foltz's name, ac

cording to Babcock.
In her time, "there wouldn't have
been any people at Stanford who hadn't
heard of her," says Babcock. Against
Foltz's own wishes, time has obscured
the life and works of this formerly pro
minent Californian.
Who was Clara Shortridge Foltz, other
than being the first woman lawyer in
the state? In her day, she was hailed
as the "Portia of the Pacific," an analogy
to Shakespeare's judicious heroine in
"The Merchant of Venice" and an ap
propriate epithet for one side of her
persona.

If she did not argue for mercy above
justice, then she fought for morality
above legality. She worked to enact laws
challenging social convention and pro
moting equal rights.
After reading law in the office of a
San Jose attorney in the early 1870s,
she drafted the Woman Lawyer's Bill,
which provided that any person of good
moral character might be admitted to
the bar. A state senator, formerly mayor
of San Jose, introduced the bill into the
state legislature.
In September 1878, after lobbying for
the bill in Sacramento, Foltz became the
first woman lawyer in California, more
than three decades before the state gave
women the right to vote.

Soon after that victory, Foltz and her
friend Laura Gordon, California's sec
ond woman lawyer, applied for admis
sion to Hastings, California's first law
school.
This initiated another uphill battle,
because the school's board of directors
ruled against admitting women, wary
they would distract the men. Foltz and
Gordon triumphed, however, for they
brought a suit against Hastings and won
in the trial court and in the California
Supreme Court as well.
At the start of her legal practice, when
she was still viewed as a pariah in the
legal profession, Foltz attracted only
clients desperate enough to come to a
woman lawyer — poor people accused
of crime. From her experience in this
position, Foltz conceived the idea of a
public defender — "a radical idea at the
time," according to Babcock.
Once Foltz had found some recogni
tion, she was hired as the prosecuting
attorney in a murder case in which the
attorney for the defense was none other
than Gordon, her colleague and friend.
Despite efforts by the press to over
dramatize the women's adversarial
courtroom roles, Foltz and Gordon re
mained friends, addressing each other
in court as "my sister-in-law."
The case found particular public at
tention and stirred interest because one
of the traditional arguments against
women lawyers was they would have
"undue influence on the jury." With
women lawyers on both sides, this case
once again broke all the rules.
Though it seems to Babcock that
everything Foltz did was "sort of spec
tacular," it is unclear what the
groundbreaking lawyer's true goals
were. In California, she not only prac
ticed law, but went to San Diego during
the 1887 real estate boom, where she
published a daily paper. In New York
in 1895, where she also entered the bar,
she sued a restaurant that refused serv
ice to unescorted women.
In 1896, she started the Clara Foltz
Gold Mining Company. Babcock calls
this one of the "nuggets," in her con
tinuing treasure hunt for information
on Foltz.
As if her activities in New York and


Clara Shortridge Foltz
California were not enough,
Foltz went to Denver, where she
practiced law and helped start a
magazine called "The Mecca."
Foltz considered Colorado, where
women's suffrage was accorded
in 1895, a "mecca for all civilized
men and women."
A great suffragist, she "had
no overarching sense of mission
so pure that it overrode all per
sonal ambition," says Babcock.
Yet Foltz had clearly striven
for immortality. "Modesty should
hardly prevent me from suggest
ing that my name must neces
sarily 'go over the top'," she
wrote in"The Struggles and Tri
umphs of a Woman Lawyer," a
regular feature published in her
own magazine "The New Amer
ican Woman."
Part of the reason her predic
tion went unfulfilled may have
been her own efforts to obscure
certain aspects of her life. In par
ticular, she hid the fact she was
divorced at age 30, after eloping
at age 15. She told the New York
Times in 1897 that she was "left
a widow while she was still young
with five children to support."
Babcock argues it is possible that
Foltz presented herself as a
widow to prevent people from

thinking that her pursuit of law
destroyed her marriage.
Eventually, her attempts to
obscure triumphed over "her
yearning for immortality," ac
cording to Babcock. Foltz herself
did not save her private papers
in a library or archives. Four of
her children predeceased her,
and the fifth, Virginia, never had
children of her own. Although,
according to Babcock "she had
a lot of friends," none preserved
her papers.
But Foltz's complexity does
not keep Babcock from identify
ing with the maverick woman or
persevering in her search. "It's
like a great treasure hunt to me;
because I keep thinking I'm
going to find [her papers] some
day." In her office, she is sur
rounded by Foltz: Newspaper
clippings and photographs cover
walls and bookshelves.
She says she thinks about
Foltz when deciding whether she
should do something. At first un
certain about whether she should
go to Washington to give tes
timony in opposition of Supreme
Court nominee Robert Bork, the
memory of Foltz inspired her to
go "because I knew she would
do it."
Foltz's influence on Babcock
