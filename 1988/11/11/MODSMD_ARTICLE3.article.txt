# Hospital warns past blood recipients of AIDS possibility
## 
### Jay Bhattachurya Staff writer 
The Stanford Hospital will soon be
notifying its patients who received a blood
transfusion between January 1978 and
March 1985 that there is a slim chance
they may have been exposed to the AIDS
virus.
A letter explaining the danger will be
sent to about 20,000 people who received
transfusions before effective screening for
the AIDS virus in the blood supply be
came available, according to Laura
Hofstader, a science writer for the Med
ical Center News Bureau.
The likelihood of transfusion recipients
in this targeted period being exposed to

the virus is somewhere between one in
3,000 and one in 5,000, said Dr. Steven
Foung, associate director of Stanford's
transfusion service. ,
Since the development of the antibody
test for the AIDS virus, the risk of ex
posure from transfusions is between one
in 100,000 and one in a million, he said.
The Stanford program was initiated in
response to a federal advisory recommen
dation that hospitals inform tranfusion
patients, Foung said. The federal advisory
was issued earlier this year.
The UC-San Francisco Medical Center
undertook a similar notification program
last fall, according to Edith Bossom of
the UCSF blood bank.
In that program, while over 10,000

transfusion patients were contacted about
the possibility of exposure, "very few
tested positive for AIDS," Bossom said.
Stanford started its program later than
UCSF, Hofstader said, because it is in a
lower AIDS risk area than San Francisco.
Med Center officials determined it would
be "worthwhile to wait" and observe the
effects of the notification program at
other institutions, Hofstader said.
The letter recommends that the tranfu
sion recipients consult with their physi
cians about taking the AIDS antibody
test, Hofstader said. Stanford is also of
fering to provide the test to any of these
patients or their spouses, she said.
Prior to this program, the Med Center
had only informed patients who had re-

ceived blood that had been confirmed to
contain the AIDS virus. "We now want
to make the recommendation (for testing)
to cover all people who received transfu
sions in this period," Foung said.
Stanford is not legally responsible for
those people who contract AIDS as a
result of a tranfusion, Foung said. "The
blood was screened to the best of our

ability to reduce the risk of contamination
with the AIDS virus," he said.
Stanford began testing for the AIDS
virus in its blood supply in 1983, two
years before the development of the an
tibody test, Foung said. The test used
back then, while not specific to AIDS,
was fairly successful in identifying blood
that had a high risk, Foung concluded.
