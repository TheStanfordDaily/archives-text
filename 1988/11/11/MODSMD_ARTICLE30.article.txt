Veritable virtuoso
You can hear one of the world's greatest
violin soloists tonight when Mark Kaplan plays
at 8 p.m. in Campbell Recital Hall. The chal
lenging program will feature Bach's E Major
Partita No. 3; B minor Partita No. 1; and D
minor Partita No. 2.
Kaplan graduated from the Julliard Music
School with numerous honors, and has since
collaborated with the world's foremost conduc
tors and orchestras.
The Oregon Journal said Kaplan reveals "that
indefinable spark of pure talent which separates
the true artist from the highly accomplished
technician," while the Frankfurter Algemeine
Zeitung said "Das Violinkonzert hatte mit dem
Amerikaner Mark Kaplan einen Solisten, der es
tatsachlich fertigbrachte, auch den abgebruh
testen Zuhorer zu fesseln."
Tickets are $14 (students $3 off) and are
available at the Tresidder Ticket Office. Student
"Rush" tickets for $4 may be available 15
minutes before the performance begins, de
pending on advance sales.
