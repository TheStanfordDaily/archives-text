## Duran Duran doing it on reflex Gone are a pair of Taylors, and the band just isn't the same 
### Matthew Marx 
Okay, okay. I'll admit it. I was a
preteen Duran Duran addict. Yes, I
bought every album the day it came
out. And it's true that I had six Duran
Duran posters in my room at one time
.. . so I never understood why everyone
told me that Duran Duran stunk.
Now I know.
"Big Thing," the latest by — well,
actually, it's "Duranduran" now, just
one word — is one of the most pitiful
excuses for pressing vinyl that I've ever
heard (you can read about Tiffany next
week).
So what happened? Why did a group
that at least had some degree of success
go rotten? Perhaps the answer lies in
a long string of events dating back to
the arrival of their self-titled debut al
bum in 1981.
Duran Duran's original appeal was
in their youthfulness. Deemed the "Fab
Five" by critics who likened their pop
appearance to the early Beatles, Duran
Duran exuded adolescence. Their first
American chart hit, "Is There Some
thing I Should Know?" ran playful boy
meets-girl lyrics around thumping
drums.
The brilliant "Rio" was brought out
in 1982. Even if you're not a fan of the
old Duran Duran, you've got to like this
album for its sheer energy. Besides its
musical content, however, it opened the
doors for the medium of music televi
sion. Videos for "Hungry Like the

Wolf," "Rio" and "Save a Prayer" es
tablished Duran Duran as the first
made-for-MTV band. A dubious honor,
to be sure, though it brought the
popular acclaim (and particularly, the
sales) they sought.
Yet, in the next year, the machinery's
oil started drying up. "Seven and the
Ragged Tiger," though boasting "The
Reflex," the band's first No. 1 song,
was considerably weaker than "Rio." It
was at once rushed and bridled, with
fine songs like "Crime and Passion"
muddled amongst "Shadows on Your
Side," which could have been written
by any third-grader with a Casio
keyboard.
Although in the next year Duran
Duran scored another chart-topper with
the theme from the James Bond flick
"A View To a Kill," it was obvious that
the band wasn't enjoying itself anymore.
Their Live Aid performance was un
spirited — and particularly embarrass
ing when Simon Le Bon's voice cracked
in a beaten-dog yelp during "Union of
the Snake."
In that same miserable 1984, a live
greatest hits album titled "Arena" was
released. A single new track, the awful
AWFUL "Wild Boys," inexplicably rose
to No. 2 on the charts.
Soon after "Arena" Duran Duran
broke up — then they didn't — then
they did, halfway. Guitarist Andy
Taylor, claiming musical frustration,
took bassist John Taylor with him to

Robert Palmer. Result: The Power Sta
tion, a hard-rock supergroup of sorts
spawning the raucous No. 1 hit "Some
Like It Hot."
Not to be outdone, Le Bon took the
rest of the band with him to form Ar
cadia. But their album, "So Red the
Rose," made hardly the ripple on the
music scene that "Power Station" did.
The battle of the bands ended with
Andy Taylor leaving to pursue a solo
career of power chording, drummer
John Taylor retiring after a nervoujs
breakdown and the remaining three -112
Le Bon, keyboardist Nick Rhodes
John Taylor — getting back together.
The regrouped Duran Duran released
"Notorious" to critical indifference. It
wasn't that it was bad — just nothing
special.
But whatever stubbly vestiges of tal
ent were evident in "Notorious" have
been shaved off for the recording of the
brancl-new "Big Thing."
I suppose the real challenge in listen
ing to this iJbum lies in figuring out
who it doesn't sound like. It's a night
mare — a musical mongrel of George
Michael, Erasure, A-Ha . . . you get the
idea: Duran Duran (sorry, Duranduran")
meets techno-synth-pop.
As if the title didn't tip you off al
ready, the lyrics of "Big Thing" are
about as deep as a puddle. Make that
a mud puddle. Consider the title track,
"Bang it up/bang it out/banging on a
big thing" — Duran Duran's ode to the
erection?
The first single, "I Don't Want Your
Love," reeks incompetence. The aimless
vocal line is sung effeminately by Le
Bon — totally out of character for him;
the virtual absence of any bass is an
egregious waste of John Taylor's sharp
talent. It's hard to tell whether this
song is the antithesis of, or the sequel
to George Michael's "I Want Your Sex,"
but either way, it's difficult to take any
morality message from a band whose
lead singer is known to make love to
his microphone in concert.
To its credit — this section will be
short — the album does preserve a bit
of the Duran-esque harmonies of yore.
The surprising intensity of "All She
Wants Is" complements "Do You Believe
in Shame," a minimalistic ode to Andy
Warhol.
Still, "Big Thing" is no big deal. It's
musical milquetoast, hardly comparable
to their previous work. And perhaps
that's been Duran Duran's problem all
along: not content to stay pop, they've
tried to un-sell-out. A noble move on
their part, though sadly, a failed one.

ent were evident in "Notorious" have
been shaved off for the recording of the
brancl-new "Big Thing."
I suppose the real challenge in listen
ing to this iJbum lies in figuring out
who it doesn't sound like. It's a night
mare — a musical mongrel of George
Michael, Erasure, A-Ha . . . you get the
idea: Duran Duran (sorry, Duranduran")
meets techno-synth-pop.
As if the title didn't tip you off al
ready, the lyrics of "Big Thing" are
about as deep as a puddle. Make that
a mud puddle. Consider the title track,
"Bang it up/bang it out/banging on a
big thing" — Duran Duran's ode to the
erection?
The first single, "I Don't Want Your
Love," reeks incompetence. The aimless
vocal line is sung effeminately by Le
Bon — totally out of character for him;
the virtual absence of any bass is an
egregious waste of John Taylor's sharp
talent. It's hard to tell whether this
song is the antithesis of, or the sequel
to George Michael's "I Want Your Sex,"
but either way, it's difficult to take any
morality message from a band whose
lead singer is known to make love to
his microphone in concert.
To its credit — this section will be
short — the album does preserve a bit
of the Duran-esque harmonies of yore.
The surprising intensity of "All She
Wants Is" complements "Do You Believe
in Shame," a minimalistic ode to Andy
Warhol.
Still, "Big Thing" is no big deal. It's
musical milquetoast, hardly comparable
to their previous work. And perhaps
that's been Duran Duran's problem all
along: not content to stay pop, they've
tried to un-sell-out. A noble move on
their part, though sadly, a failed one.

Okay, okay. I'll admit it. I was a
preteen Duran Duran addict. Yes, I
bought every album the day it came
out. And it's true that I had six Duran
Duran posters in my room at one time
.. . so I never understood why everyone
told me that Duran Duran stunk.
Now I know.
"Big Thing," the latest by — well,
actually, it's "Duranduran" now, just
one word — is one of the most pitiful
excuses for pressing vinyl that I've ever
heard (you can read about Tiffany next
week).
So what happened? Why did a group
that at least had some degree of success
go rotten? Perhaps the answer lies in
a long string of events dating back to
the arrival of their self-titled debut al
bum in 1981.
Duran Duran's original appeal was
in their youthfulness. Deemed the "Fab
Five" by critics who likened their pop
appearance to the early Beatles, Duran
Duran exuded adolescence. Their first
American chart hit, "Is There Some
thing I Should Know?" ran playful boy
meets-girl lyrics around thumping
drums.
The brilliant "Rio" was brought out
in 1982. Even if you're not a fan of the
old Duran Duran, you've got to like this
album for its sheer energy. Besides its
musical content, however, it opened the
doors for the medium of music televi
sion. Videos for "Hungry Like the

Wolf," "Rio" and "Save a Prayer" es
tablished Duran Duran as the first
made-for-MTV band. A dubious honor,
to be sure, though it brought the
popular acclaim (and particularly, the
sales) they sought.
Yet, in the next year, the machinery's
oil started drying up. "Seven and the
Ragged Tiger," though boasting "The
Reflex," the band's first No. 1 song,
was considerably weaker than "Rio." It
was at once rushed and bridled, with
fine songs like "Crime and Passion"
muddled amongst "Shadows on Your
Side," which could have been written
by any third-grader with a Casio
keyboard.
Although in the next year Duran
Duran scored another chart-topper with
the theme from the James Bond flick
"A View To a Kill," it was obvious that
the band wasn't enjoying itself anymore.
Their Live Aid performance was un
spirited — and particularly embarrass
ing when Simon Le Bon's voice cracked
in a beaten-dog yelp during "Union of
the Snake."
In that same miserable 1984, a live
greatest hits album titled "Arena" was
released. A single new track, the awful
AWFUL "Wild Boys," inexplicably rose
to No. 2 on the charts.
Soon after "Arena" Duran Duran
broke up — then they didn't — then
they did, halfway. Guitarist Andy
Taylor, claiming musical frustration,
took bassist John Taylor with him to

Robert Palmer. Result: The Power Sta
tion, a hard-rock supergroup of sorts
spawning the raucous No. 1 hit "Some
Like It Hot."
Not to be outdone, Le Bon took the
rest of the band with him to form Ar
cadia. But their album, "So Red the
Rose," made hardly the ripple on the
music scene that "Power Station" did.
The battle of the bands ended with
Andy Taylor leaving to pursue a solo
career of power chording, drummer
John Taylor retiring after a nervoujs
breakdown and the remaining three -112

The regrouped Duran Duran released
"Notorious" to critical indifference. It
wasn't that it was bad — just nothing
special.

ent were evident in "Notorious" have
