## History in the making?

Does history really repeat it
self?
The Stanford football team, 20-
point underdogs to UCLA this
week, certainly hopes so. Although
the sixth-ranked Bruins are 8-1,
4-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference,
the Cardinal has won two straight
in the Rose Bowl and hopes the
third time around proves equally
as charmed.
"We're just going to prepare for
them this week and fly at 'em,"
Stanford Coach Jack Elway said.
The Cardinal is only 19 points
away from being 8-1 and a favor
ite in the conference's race for
the Roses. But Stanford has not
been able to score the coup de
grace and is 3-5-1 overall, 1-4-1
in league play. Senior free safety
Mike Newton describes the team's
feelings as, "just trying to stay
positive right now. It's really
tough. . . . Keep the good work
ethic and try and make a win out
of this week."
The Cardinal will have a tough

time against a Bruin team that
made Nebraska look like Kansas
(1-8) earlier this season. Led by
Heisman Trophy candidate Troy
Aikman, the Bruins are averaging
457.8 yards a game of offense
while giving up less than 300.
Aikman has completed 64 per
cent of his passes for 2147 yards
and has a very impressive
touchdown-to-turnover ratio of
21-6. "We are a football team that
has been carried at times by our
great quarterback, Troy Aikman,"
UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said.
"He certainly has been the key
element. .. . All coaches are biased
toward their players but I cer
tainly beleive he's the best player
in the country."
Some good news for the Cardi
nal is that tailback Eric Ball, the
1986 Rose Bowl MVP as a fresh
man, is probably out with a
sprained ankle. His back-up,
Brian Brown, had 102 yards on
only 16 carries in the Bruins' 16-6
win over Oregon Saturday,
though. So much for small favors.
The Bruins will face a Cardinal
defense that has been tough all

year. "Washington State's offense,
to me," Donahue said, "is as good
as anyone's in the country and
Stanford holds them to 24 points.
They got 34 points against us. I
think we have legitimate concerns
going into this game."
The defense was led by outside
linebacker Rob Hinckley last
week. Hinckley had three sacks,
14 tackles and a pass break-up
and is, "one of the top football
players in the conference," accord
ing to Donahue. "He's an out
standing football player who has
good height, size and mobility.
He's a very intelligent player."
On the other side of the ball,
Stanford's offense faces a UCIjA
defense that held Oregon to a
mere six points Saturday. But
Donahue is still not satisfied with
that unit's job. "Our defensive
unit, overall, has not been as pro
ductive as I thought before the
season began," he said. "We've
had some moments where we've
played very well and other mo
ments where we haven't played

very well. Stanford's football
team is certainly going to pose a
challenge for us."
Donahue thinks that the Car
dinal's run-and-shoot offense will
cause his team a lot of problems,
much as Washington State's pass
ing attck did in the Cougars' 34-
30 upset of the Bruins.
"Our defense doesn't particu
larly play well against that style,"
he said, "but we still have to go
out there and try to do the job
Saturday."
Maybe history can repeat itself.
Card notes
Tomorrow's game, starting at 1:00
p.m., will be broadcast live on KZSU

90.1 FM. The play-by-play will be han
dled by Randy "never a dull moment"
Chappel while Adam "frequent flyer"
Fogelson will handle the color com
mentary with his usual aplomb.
Stanford has several injuries re
ported for tomorrow's game. Perhaps
the most serious is the bruised ribs
of fullback Jon Volpe. He is listed as
questionable, and if he plays he will
wear a flak jacket for protection.
Strong safety Rob Englehardt is
questionable with a knee and thigh
bruise, as are offensive linemen
Robbie Coffin and Mike Kohlmoos.
Inside linebacker Jono Tunney and
offensive guard Chuck Gillingham
are both probable with thigh bruises
and slotback Charlie Young has had
the flu all week.
