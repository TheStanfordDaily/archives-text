A little Rustoleum and a little polish,
and everything will be just fine.
Working out the kinks and the
opening night jitters, the Stanford wom
en's basketball team emerged in fine
form last night as the squad blew out
the scrappy Australian Junior National
Team 83-55 to start the season on a
powerful note.

Cardinal 83, Australians 55

Stanford, ranked preseason No. 10 by
Street and Smith's and No. 6 by Sports
Illustrated, validated all of the acclaim
it has received over the past several
weeks. The squad utterly dominated the
skillful but jet-lagged Australians and
took control right from the tip-off.
"I think we played really well as a
team tonight," junior guard Jennifer
Azzi said. "[Stanford Coach Tara Van-
Derveer] said our offense looked better
and it definitely felt better."
; Senior center Jill Yanke scored the
Cardinal's first points of the year with
a high-arcing jumper from free-throw
Tange, and the Stanford offensive
pnslought began.
■ Led by Azzi, who tallied 14 points in
the first half alone and finished with
a game-high 20, the Cardinal continued
to light up the scoreboard and left for
the locker room at halftime with a whop
ping 53-24 lead.
; Sophomore forward Trisha Stevens
also contributed to the scoring festival,
recording 14 points in the first half
with some slick inside shooting and add
ing four more in the second. Junior
forward Katy Steding posted 14 points
after going 3-for-3 in the first half, while
sophomore guard Sonja Henning
rounded out the double-figure-scoring
starters with 12 points.
"It felt really good," Azzi said. "We're

still a little rusty, and I made some
turnovers that I need to eliminate. I
still don't think I shot as well as I could
have shot — I think the reason I had
a lot of points is because they were
passing me the ball down the court for
lay-ups."
Azzi did more than just cherry-pick,
however. The preseason honorable men
tion Ail-American bombed away from
outside, played tough defense and
dished off a game-high seven assists
including a phenomenal blind pass to a
leaping Henning for a quick two at the
hoop.
Henning played phenomenally as well,
showcasing her newly-found three point
shot as well as running a slick offense.
The sophomore was 2-for-2 from three
point range.
Not all was perfect for the Cardinal
cagers, however. The team's play started
to stagnate in the final 10 minutes of

the game, giving the Australians a
chance to narrow the gap. Though the
outcome was never in doubt, a handy
win sometimes was.
"I thought we looked good on offense,
we shot well, we passed well, but defen
sively we got in trouble in the second
half," VanDerveer said. "We were up
30 points at halftime and we lapsed in
the second half, which I didn't like to
see."
The Cardinal was also the victim of
a tough pressure defense, twice as ag
gressive as most of the teams Stanford
faced last year. The Australians were
constantly in the Cardinal players' faces,
and a hand always seemed ready to
grab a bobbled ball or an inaccurate
pass.
"The pace of the game was pretty
fast, and that's going to help us get our
running game going," Azzi said. "I'm
glad we started out with this game."
