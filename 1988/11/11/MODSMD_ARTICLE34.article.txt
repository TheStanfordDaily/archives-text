# Card bags two blue-chip recruits
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Last night was doubly successful
for the Stanford women's basketball
team: complementing a handy win in
its season opener, the Cardinal also
scored big in this year's recruiting
contest. Adding another great class
to a series of astonishing recruiting
years, Stanford Coach Tara VanDer
veer announced the signing of cen
ter/forward Val Whiting and guard
Molly Goodenbour, All-America se
lections by both the Women's Bas
ketball News Service and Street and
Smith's.
Whiting, a force at the post posi
tion hailing from Wilmington,
averaged 24.1 points, 13.5 rebounds
and 2.1 blocks per game last season,
and led her Ursuline Academy team

to two consecutive Delaware state
titles. The senior is also an accom
plished track star, winning the state
shotput title the past two years.
"Val Whiting is an enforcer," Stan
ford Coach VanDerveer said. "She is
a wide-body, 6-3, very powerful, re
bounder, intense, aggressive player,
someone who will shake things up
in the middle."
Goodenbour, a 5-6 point guard, is
equally as touted. The Waterloo,
lowa, native amassed 18 points and
4.5 assists per game last year and
chose Stanford over powerhouses Vir
ginia, Duke and Washington.
"Molly Goodenbour is an excellent
point-guard, pushes the ball up the
floor, is in great shape and handles
pressure," VanDerveer said. "We
need someone basically developing
behind Sorya (Henning)."
