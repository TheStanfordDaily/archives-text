NEW YORK (AP) - Orel
Hershiser did it again. He
pitched another shutout and
this one brought the Cy Young.
Hershiser, baseball's most
dominant pitcher ever for the
season's final two months, won
the National League Cy Young
Award unanimously on Thurs
day, adding another honor to
one of the most amazing years
in history.
Hershiser's record streak of
59 scoreless innings ended the
regular season and swept him
past all rivals. He wound up
23-8 with a 2.26 earned-run
average for the World Series
champion Los Angeles
Dodgers.
Hershiser was Most Valuable
Player of the World Series and
of the National League
playoffs. Voting for the Cy
Young was conducted before
the postseason began.
"I was very surprised. Unan
imous is hard to attain, so how
can you expect it?" he said. "I
got worried when someone said
what if they mail in their bal
lots early before anyone has a
chance to get hot."
Hershiser got all 24 first
place votes and 120 points in
balloting by two members of
the Baseball Writers' Associa
tion of America in each league
city. Cincinnati's Danny Jack
son, who had an identical
record to Hershiser, was sec
ond with 15 second-place votes
and 54 points. David Cone, 20-3

for the New York Mets, was
third with nine second-place
votes and 42 points.
Hershiser is the 12th unan
imous Cy Young winner, the
first since Roger Clemens of
Boston and Dwight Gooden of
the New York Mets in 1985.
Minnesota's Frank Viola,
named Wednesday to win the
AL Cy Young, was one vote
short of unanimous.
This was the first time since
1970 that only three pitchers
received votes.
The pitching-rich Dodgers
have won the Cy Young more
than any other team, eight
times since it was first awarded
in 1956. Fernando Valenzuela
did it last for Los Angeles.
Hershiser, a 30-year-old
right-hander, had been one of
the best and most consistent
pitchers in the major leagues
for his first four full seasons.
Yet this year, he raised himself
to a new level, combining magic
and magnificence in drawing
comparisons with the all-time
greats.
"I think my life will be clas
sified in two sections now —
before 1988 and after 1988,"
he said after becoming a World
Series hero.
Hershiser was a .500 pitcher
in his past two seasons, 14-14
in 1986 and 16-16 in 1987. But
his record suffered because the
Dodgers endured consecutive
losing seasons for the first time
since the mid-1960'5.
