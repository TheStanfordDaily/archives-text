# Volleyball goes Beaver, Duck hunting
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
This weekend, the Stanford
women's volleyball team can take
a little breather but can hardly
relax.
Recovering from a tough come
from-behind win Tuesday night
against No. 12 Pacific, the second
ranked Cardinal hosts Oregon
State tonight and Oregon tomor
row as it attempts to extend its
school-record 18-match winning
streak and prepare for next
Thursday's showdown against No.
1 UCLA.
In order to reach Pauley Pavil
ion with a chance for the Pacific
10 Conference title, however,
Stanford has to win this week
end's matches. At 23-1 overall and
13-1 in the Pac-10, the Cardinal
is just a half-game behind the un
defeated Bruins, who logged their
conference-record 24th straight
victory last night against USC.
Stanford's opponents this week
end find themselves at the oppo
site end of the conference spec
trum. Oregon State, which gar
nered its one-and-only Pac-10 win
ever against a hobbled USC a cou
ple weeks ago in Corvallia, holds
the bottom spot in the league with
a 1-14 mark but at 12-21 overall
has quadrupled the number of
wins tallied last year.
The Ducks, on the other hand,
are doing far worse than antici
pated after last year's NCAA
Tournament appearance. Handi
capped by the loss of All-Amorica

Senior captain Laura Oleson has led the Cardinal to an 18-game win streak this season.
outside hitter Ten Kramer and
middle blocker Laurie Krejcha,
the nation's leading blocker
throughout most of the 1987
season, Oregon has struggled to
a disappointing 8-16 mark, 2-16
and ninth in the Pac-10.
Easy prey for the No. 2 team
in the country, right? Well, maybe.
Both teams put up a good fight
on their home courts last month,
and with losing seasons assured
the squads will be looking for a
big upset to make their work this
year worthwhile.
"I basically expect the same
type of attitude from both teams:
'we've got nothing to lose, and
beating Stanford would be the
best thing that could happen to
us right now,'" Stanford Asst.
Coach Ruben Nieves said. "I
would think they'll play loose and

aggressive, and they'll go for it."
Fresh off a match against a
team with the similar attitude,
the Cardinal should be more than
ready to handle the threat. An
inspired Pacific squad, strength
ened by the return of Ail-
American middle blocker Elaina
Oden, stripped the first two games
of the match away before Stanford
managed to come back and win.
"I'm hoping that Tuesday's ex
perience will give us the same kind
of boost that the Hawaii match
did," Nieves said, recalling Stan
ford's five-game upset of the then-
No. 2 and current No. 3 Rainbow
Wahines. "In the Hawaii match,
we had our backs to the wall and
played poorly in certain parts of
the match, but in the end some
how we pulled together, finished
the match strong and came out
with a win.
"I'm hoping that even though
we did struggle at the beginning
of the UOP match, it'll be a con
fidence booster. Backs to the wall,
a lot of other teams would have
folded, but not this team."
