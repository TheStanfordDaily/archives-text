# Volleyball goes Beaver, Duck hunting

### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
This weekend, the Stanford
women's volleyball team can take
a little breather but can hardly
relax.
Recovering from a tough come
from-behind win Tuesday night
against No. 12 Pacific, the second
ranked Cardinal hosts Oregon
State tonight and Oregon tomor
row as it attempts to extend its
school-record 18-match winning
streak and prepare for next
Thursday's showdown against No.
1 UCLA.
In order to reach Pauley Pavil
ion with a chance for the Pacific
10 Conference title, however,
Stanford has to win this week
end's matches. At 23-1 overall and
13-1 in the Pac-10, the Cardinal
is just a half-game behind the un
defeated Bruins, who logged their
conference-record 24th straight
victory last night against USC.
Stanford's opponents this week
end find themselves at the oppo
site end of the conference spec
trum. Oregon State, which gar
nered its one-and-only Pac-10 win
ever against a hobbled USC a cou
ple weeks ago in Corvallia, holds
the bottom spot in the league with
a 1-14 mark but at 12-21 overall
has quadrupled the number of
wins tallied last year.
The Ducks, on the other hand,
are doing far worse than antici
pated after last year's NCAA
Tournament appearance. Handi
capped by the loss of All-Amorica

Senior captain Laura Oleson has led the Cardinal to an 18-game win streak this season.
