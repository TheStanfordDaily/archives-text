## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Stanford's cross country teams
enter the District-8 meet tomor
row at Fresno with one goal in
mind — qualifying for the NCAA
Championships.
After a strong second-place
showing at the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championships, the men's
team will race for the win at
Fresno, while Carol Gray will
shoot for the women's individual
championship.
"The men need to run like they
did at Pac-lOs to qualify", accord
ing to Men'B Coach Scott Chisam.
"If they finish first or second,
they will make [NCAAs]." Rather
than remaining complacent, they
will try to overtake Pac-10 cham
pion Oregon and pull away from
Washington, another strong con
tender.
The men go into this competi
tion with talent and experience to
control the race. Twin brothers
Eric and Mark Mastalir were the
fastest of Stanford's returnees in
this race last year. Along with
junior transfer Steve Miller and
senior captain James Alborough,
the Cardinal has four runners ca
pable of running sub-five minute
mile pace over 10 kilometers on
the flat Fresno course.
Stanford could take home indi
vidual wins in both the women's
5,000-meter and the men's
10,000-meter races. Chisam feels
that "Steve Miller and Eric Mas
talir could win" and that junior
Carol Gray will be a threat in the
women's race.
The top two teams and the top
three individuals from the rest of
the field will earn the right to
take part in the Championship
meet in Des Moines, lowa Novem
ber 21st. Women's Coach Brooks
Johnson has decided to enter only
Carol Gray in the women's com

petition, as she is the only mem
ber with a chance to qualify.
Johnson's decision did not gaip
wholehearted support. The wonji
en's team has run only three racqfc
all season. After a disappointing
race at the Pac-lOs two weelgi
ago, he decided not to enter hjji
full squad.
Sophomore Melanie Bloch was
one of those who missed a chance
to compete. While disappointed
over the lost opportunity, she was
supportive of her teammate. "I'm
confient that Carol will do well.;
She deserves it, especially after
last year when she was sick and
missed the NCAA
ships."
The men, on the other handg;
are hoping to make the NCAA
meet as a team. Eric Mastaliri
one of the Cardinal frontrunners;
believes his team is good enough
to win Saturday. "Everyone looks
good in practice and everyone w
healthy. We will run an aggressive
race and make aure we mix it up
with the leaders."
Chisam's strategy will be to.
"run with Oregon and run away
from Washington. We need to:
keep two men with Oregon and
ahead of Washington, with the
rest of the squad in the top 15,"
he said. •-
The men have made tremen
dous strides over last season.
They started strong with a wili
at the Stanford Invitational ant)
swept Berkeley in a dual meet
two weeks later. Then their win
ning streak was snapped by a
strong Oregon team at the Pac-10
meet October 31st, but Miller took
third overall and the entire team
was under the 32-minute barrier.
The men did not make Nationals
last year but will enter the com
petiton this year with an optomis
tic attitude and a No. 12 national
ranking.
