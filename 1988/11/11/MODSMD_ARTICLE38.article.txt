# 'Gag me with a spoon': Polo to meet LA rivals
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
The football team is not the only Stanford squad
with a tough Southern California weekend sched
uled. The men's water polo team is joning the
annual end-of-seaon athletic migration to the City
of Angels. But unlike their gridiron compatriots,
the poloers face not one but two nationally ranked
Pacific 10 Conference foes.
Stanford takes on both the second-ranked UCLA
and third-rated USC squads in its second-to-last
regualar season weekend today and tomorrow. Al
though the No. 5 Cardinal will definitely have ilte
hands full beneath the sunny Southern skies, the

newly revamped squad is thinking sweep.
Coming ofT a non-competitive weekend against
the water polo alumni, the Cardinal is looking to
raise its standing before the fast approaching NCAA
Championships with two Pac-10 victories. While the
19-9 squad is winless in official conference games
this season, Stanford was in much of the same
position last year. Not only did it defeat USC (na
tional runner-up) in its home pool, but only fell to
UCLA 12-11 in double overtime.
"We usually play well against both squads down
there and we should be playing our best polo of
the year right now," Stanford Coach Dante Det
tamanti said.
The Trojans are Stanford's first hurdle to moving

up in both the national and Pac-10 rankings. But
while the Cardinal was was defeated 9-5 in the
teams' last meeting, it holds the upper hand with
a 2-1 record against USC this season.
"Our main goal for SC is to stop its holemen
from shooting." Dettamanti said. "Last game we
completely played them from the wrong side the
entire contest."
Saturday, Stanford takes on the nation's No. 2
squad, which it has yet to beat in three tries this
season. But while the Bruins have prevailed in
every meeting, the Cardinal thinks it might have
them figured out, or at least knows what it has to
do.
The squad's first goal is to stop UCLA's All-
America two-meter man Alex Rousseau, who re
peatedly burned Stanford inside for key goals in
every contest. In addition, Stanford will be on the
lookout for the Bruins' deadly left-handed game.
But according to Dettamanti, the key in both
contests will be Stanford's ability to get the ball in
the goal. "Basically we have the same game plan
as before, we just need to score. We really are due
to break out offensively."
