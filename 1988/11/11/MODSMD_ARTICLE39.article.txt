# Todd the god joins the Greeks atop Mount Olympus
## 
### 
;; With the races for both first
and last heating up here in Greek
land (not to be confused with
Greece, of course) we present this
week's installment of the Greek
of the Week. Although all the
votes have not been tabulated, the
projected results of the Guest
Greek selection process show
senior guard Todd Lichti with 487
electoral votes, Bill the Cat/Walter
Mondale have 32 votes, the slate
-of Calvin and Hobbes tallied 17
votes and George Bush/J. Dan
forth Quayle received negative
one vote.
When informed of his triumph,
"Lichti was amazed. "It's an
honor," Stanford's all-time
leading scorer said. "Something I
never expected would come my
way. It has to rank up there with

anything in my career."
Lichti, although one sport
removed from his element, came
up with a collection of winners in
an effort to return the Greek to
the position of glory held a scant
three weeks ago.
In other Greek news, Card
Today editor Robert Pardington
picked UCLA this week, the third
consecutive time he has gone
against the Cardinal. Is it some
thing they said, Rob?
Sports editor Cameron Macky,
who for the first time this season
has company in the basement, is
looking for his team, the Pitt Pan
thers, to carry him to glory. I
guess that's alright but 126 points
against a Joe Paterno team? Get
real.
