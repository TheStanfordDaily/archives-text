# Reroute may ease Rains traffic problem
## 
### Julie Kuhlken 
In response to community con
cern about increased traffic from
the new Rains apartments, the
Santa Clara County Planning
Commision has directed the Uni
versity to construct an additional
driveway off of Campus Drive and
install bollards in one parking lot.
The bollards, to be tested for
90 days in the complex's east lot,
will divide traffic leaving Rains
between Escondido Road and
Bowdoin Street and will stop
short-cut travel between the
roads. The bollards should please
residents of the faculty ghetto and
adjoining College Terrace neigh
borhood, but may frustrate the
graduate students who live in
Rains.
The recommendations are the
Planning Commission's response
to the continuing debate between
the -University and local

homeowners, who have expressed
deep concern about the impact of
additional traffic on the safety of
their children. Lscondido Elemen
tary School and Bing Nursery
School are next to the housing
complex.
Economics Prof. Paul Milgrom,
founder of the Rains' Neighbors
Coalition, said local residents had
"become alarmed" by the Univer
sity's inaction, but are pleased
with the planning commission's
decision. Kathy Durham of Col
lege Terrace also called it "a pos
itive decision."
However, Andy Doty, the Uni
versity's community relations di
rector, said the bollards should
have been "held in reserve" until
the need for them had been
proved.
The new Rains residents them
selves, latecomers to the debate,
expressed their resentment
toward the bollards in a survey

The homeowners' re
sponse is the typical
'not in my backyard
reaction against ur
banization.'
— Andy Doty

conducted by computer science
graduate student Joseph Jacobs.
A Rains resident and critic of the
Planning Commission's decision,
Jacobs said the survey showed
that 80 to 90 percent of the res
idents oppose the bollards.
Milgrom said the Rains issue is
only the "opening shot" in the
conflict between the local resi
dents and the University arising
from the rapid development of the
University. He said he is "not

against development," but is un
happy that the homeowners are
"completely unrepresented" in de
cisions concerning University
growth.
Doty said he recognizes the
"symbolic issue" involved, but
countered that the homeowners'
response is the typical "not in my
backyard reaction against ur
banization."
The conflict arose last spring,
during the construction of Rains,
when residents of the Pine Hill
area in the faculty ghetto became
aware of changes made to the
Rains traffic plan that merged the
Bowdoin Street entrance with the
entrance to the Stanford Commu
nity Recreational Association,
where many local children play.
Concerned for their children's
safety, the homeowners petitioned
the University to move the
driveway.
