# Drell will rendezvous with friend Sakharov

Drell and pioneering Soviet
physicist Andrei Sakharov, two
internationally respected
physicists and experts on arms
control, have been good friends
for more than a decade. Their
friendship, though, has always
been tempered by the restrictions
of the Iron Curtain.
They will be meeting for the
first time in the United States in
Washington, D.C. this weekend.
Sponsored by the National
Academy of Sciences, the two will
talk about arms control during a
dinner on Sunday. Drell's speech
will pay tribute to his Soviet coun
terpart, who is widely credited for
playing a key role in many recent
Soviet reforms.
Sakharov, winner of the 1975
Nobel Peace Prize, will fly to
Washington from Boston, where
he had a medical examination for
a heart condition. He is known
as the father of the Soviet hydro
gen bomb.

After his work on the bomb, he
turned his back on his govern
ment and spoke out on the prob
lems he saw with Soviet science
and society. Suffering the fate of
many other Soviet dissidents, he
was internally exiled for years in
the closed city of Gorki and re
leased in 1986 by Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev.
Drell and Sakharov met in the
1970s during a physics conference
in Moscow. Drell was impressed
with Sakharov's humanism and
his courage in bucking the Soviet
system. He saw that, in addition
to their backgrounds in physics,
they shared a deep concern for
the prevention of nuclear war.
The two friends have main
tained contact through letters for
the past few years, even during
Sakharov's exile. In some of those
letters, they debated the merits
of such widely discussed weapons
systems as the Strategic Defense
Initiative system and the MX mis
sile.
On the MX, Drell opposed its
use while Sakharov believed it
was a capable weapons system.
