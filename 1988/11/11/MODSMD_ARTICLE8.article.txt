Stanford students and fac
ulty will soon see the light.
In a long-awaited move, the
Athletic Department an
nounced that the eight tennis
courts at the West Campus
complex will be lighted for
night play.
As long ago as 1979 the stu
dent body voted overwhelm
ingly in favor of an advisory
proposal to light tennis courts
on campus. But it was not until
yesterday morning that the Ar
chitectural and Site Approval
Committee of the County of
Santa Clara gave its approval

for construction to begin.
The project will get under
way this month and is expected
to be completed by the end of
the year.
"We are pleased to at last
provide lighted tennis courts
for recreational use by Stan
ford students and faculty," Ath
letic Director Andy Geiger said.
"We've long realized that eve
ning play is more convenient
to students and faculty. Those
courts are quite busy in the
afternoon hours and we are
happy to extend this opportu
nity of evening tennis to the
Stanford communitv."
