The RAND Graduate School (RGS)
Invites applications for its doctoral degree program in
policy analysis. Deadline for submitting applications for
1989-1990 is February 1, 1989. RGS, which is fully
accredited by the Western Association of Schools and
Colleges, is an integral part of The RAND Corporation. Its
curriculum consists of multidisciplinary course work and
policy workshops, combined with on-the-job training
(OJT), leading to the dissertation and award of the Ph.D.
in Policy Analysis. Sub-fields of specialization include
health policy, national security policy and Soviet studies.
Students typically receive OJT support equivalent to
doctoral fellowships. Fellowships are also available for
applicants with special interests in health policy or Soviet
international behavior. A master's degree, or equivalent
post-bachelor's degree training and experience, is required
for admission.
A representative of the RAND Graduate School will be at
the Career Planning and Placement Center on
Wednesday, November 30, 1988.
