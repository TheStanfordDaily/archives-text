Columbia student suspended
for racially offensive graffiti
In an occurrence that parallels the recent
racist incidents at Ujamaa House, Amanda
Millet, a first-year student in Barnard Col
lege at Columbia University, was suspended
until January for writing racist graffiti in
the elevator of her dormitory.
Millet claimed to have not understood the
racist implications of her grafitti; however,
the Columbia University decided to treat it
as a racist incident and chose a punishment
that Director of Public Relations Ruth Sar
faty called "appropriate."
Several unrelated incidents of racist graf
fiti in Barnard dorms occurred early this
month at Columbia. An investigation con
ducted by Barnard Security and the Resi
dential Life Office has identified a male stu
dent of another Columbia division also guilty
of racist graffiti.
San Jose U. police deny report
from victim of racial assault
A San Jose University Police officer
refused to take a report from a victim of
an allegedly racially motivated assault at a

recent political rally on the SJSU campus.
Irma Lara, a Mexican born SJSU alumna,
claims that the fight began when a woman
screamed, "We speak English in America."
Lara responded, "bullshit," and received a
blow to the face in return.
The SJSU police officer she approached
claimed not to have seen the fight and
refused to believe her story, in spite of the
abrasions she had received in the scuffle.
Acting as mediator, the Santa Clara
County Human Relations Commission, as
signed an investigation of the racial inves
tigation.
In response to the incident, the San Jose
chapter of MEChA held a rally on Nov. 8,
at which County Supervisor Rod Diridon
and SJSU President Gail Fullerton spoke to
a crowd of about 200 students.
Anonymous AIDS testing may
begin at U. of Texas soon
In response to growing student pressure,
officials at the University of Texas Student
Health Center are considering changing
AIDS testing results from confidential to
anonymous.
Students are aware of the discrimination
against those who test positive for the virus

and are disturbed by incidents of test results
leaking from other health centers.
The policy change is still in the early
stages of consideration; however, Melinda
McMichael, center medical director, is opti
mistic about its adoption.
If implemented, the system will be pat
terned after other local anonymous testing
centers and incorporate fictitious names and
number codes.
Oregon State campus police
to be disbanded next year
Oregon State University will be without
security arrangements as of July 1, 1989
when the OSU campus police will be dis
banded.
Because the Oregon State Legislature has
blocked the Oregon State Board of Higher
Education from giving its member schools
the right to form their own police forces,
for the past 14 years Benton County Police
Department has deputized OSU Campus
police officers as a "temporary solution."
The Benton County Sheriff announced
Monday Nov. 7 that it will cease issuing
the deputy commissions as of July 1. Un
dersheriff Dave Cook said the change in
policy occurred because the police depart
ment is "without any say in who gets hired!'
