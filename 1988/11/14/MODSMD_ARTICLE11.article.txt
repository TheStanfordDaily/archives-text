## PLO may recognize Israel 
### 
ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) - PLO
leaders accepted a U.N. resolution yes
terday implicitly recognizing Israel's
right to exist and recommended the
PLO's parliament endorse the decision.
Approval by the Palestine National
Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile,
is virtually certain and would meet one
of the conditions for U.S. recognition
of the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion.
The action by a committee of PLO
leaders showed that chairman Yasser
Arafat has won his struggle with
hardliners over the controversial U.N.
Resolution 242. In the 450-member
PNC, 80 percent to 85 percent of the
parliamentarians are aligned with
Arafat.
In Washington, President Reagan was
asked if he was pleased with the PLO
leaders' action and said, "We're still
looking at that; that's all I can say."
The declaration accepting the resolu
tion will be presented to the plenary
session of the PNC, which began a spe
cial four-day meeting in Algiers on Sat
urday.
"The PNC will come out with a po
litical decision and a program of peace,"
PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdul-Rahman
said.
"In the political statement, we will
adopt all resolutions of the U.N. Secu
rity Council dealing with the Palestinian
question. What's more, we will empha
size resolutions 242 and 338 as the basis

Sources close to the talks
said that after two days of
haggling, it was clear no
compromise was possi
ble.

for an international conference to
achieve peace in the Middle East."
Resolution 242 calls for an end to
hostilities and Israeli withdrawal from
territories occupied in the 1967 war.
Adopted by the Security Council in
1967, it implicitly recognizes Israel by
referring to the right of all states in
the area to live within secure and recog
nized borders.
Resolution 338, passed in 1973 during
the Arab-Israeli war, calls for an end
to fighting; urges implementation of
Resolution 242 and, most important,
calls for negotiations between Arabs and
Israel toward "a just and durable peace
in the Middle East."
In closed-door committee meetings,
there was strong opposition to Resolu
tion 242 from the Marxist-oriented
groups, particularly George Habash's
Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine. '
Habash's faction is the second-largest
of the eight groups comprising the PLO.

Arafat's Fatah is the largest.
Sources close to the talks said that
after two days of haggling, it was clear
no compromise was possible.
Habash agreed to note his reserva
tions but bow to the msyority and not
create a major split.
Salah Khalaf, a top Arafat aide known
as Abu Iyad, said, "Never in my career
have I seen the Palestinian leadership
acting as responsibly as it is during this
session. Unity is priority and the mi
nority is accepting the verdict of the
majority without any hard feelings."
Abdul-Rahman said the council
wanted to adopt resolutions unanimous
ly, although it also was capable of op
erating by majority rule.
The Palestinian council meeting i
expected to conclude yesterday with a
declaration of independence for the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
Those opposed to Resolution 242 ob
jected to its referring to the future of
Palestinians in the occupied t err i tor
as "a just settlement of there! - pr<
lem."
The Algiers conference was called to
deal with the new developments in the
Middle East and especially to take ad
vantage of increased attention and sym
pathy for the Palestinian cause sparked
by the uprising in the Israeli-occupied
territories.
More than 310 Palestinians and 11
Israelis have been killed in the 11-month
uprising.
