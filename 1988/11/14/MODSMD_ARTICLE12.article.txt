# Orthodox parties give Likud support for coalition

### 
JERUSALEM (AP) - Two ultra-
Orthodox parties endorsed the hard-line
Likud bloc yesterday, apparently giving
party leader Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir the parliament majority he needs
to form a coalition government.
President Chaim Herzog planned to
meet today with representatives of Likud
and its rival, the left-leaning Labor Party,
and give the party with the greatest sup
port the go-ahead to form the govern
ment.
The endorsements ended almost two
weeks of uncertainty following the incon
clusive results of the Nov. 1 elections in

which neither of the two main political
parties gained a majority in the 120-
member Knesset, or parliament. Likud
won 40 seats and Labor 39.
The support of the Orthodox Shas and
Agudat Israel parties will give Likud and
its allies on the far right control of 63
seats.
Although most observers were certain
that Likud would secure the support of
the Shas and Agudat Israel, both parties
delayed their endorsements apparently to
win concessions from Likud.
The main concession Likud had to offer
was a promise to amend the "Who-is-a-

Jew" law, which defines who is Jewish
and thus eligible for automatic Israeli
citizenship.
The Orthodox have demanded the law
be amended so only Orthodox rabbis
would be able to convert non-Jews to
Judaism. Those converted by non-
Orthodox rabbis would not qualify for
citizenship.
Jewish leaders in the United States,
where most Jews belong to the more
liberal Conservative and Reform streams
of Judaism, have strongly opposed the
amendement, seeing it as a slight to the
more liberal streams. They have said it

could cause a rift among the Jewish
people.
Shamir made the concession over the
proposed amendment last week.
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, whose
Labor Party apparently lost the slim
chance it had to form a government, said
he was disappointed by the recommen
dations of the religious parties. Peres
held last-minute negotiations with the
parties Sunday afternoon.
"We did what we could and these are
the results," he said. "I don't know ex
actly what happened behind closed doors,
but during the day there was reason to

think it would go otherwise."
Rabbi Aryeh Deri of the Shas party
told The Associated Press Sunday that
"the Council of Torah Sages decided after
a long and difficult meeting that Shas
will recommend to the president that
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir will form
the next government."
The Council of Torah Sages, a panel
of rabbis, serves as the spiritual leader
ship of the Shas and made the party's
decision about the endorsement.
Deri telephoned Shamir and told him
he would continue being prime minister
for four more years, Israel television said.
