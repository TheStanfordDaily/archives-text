## Woman suspected of killing tenants for Social Security checks

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -
Police found a fifth corpse yester
day buried in the yard of a tree
shaded Victorian boardihghouse
and hunted for the 71-year-old
landlady suspected of killing the
elderly victims and cashing their
Social Security checks.
Investigators said they believe
seven or eight bodies may have
been buried in the yard, based on
the number of residents who are
missing, Homicide Lt. Joe Enloe
said.
Authorities were seeking boar
dinghouse manager Dorthea Mon
talvo Puente for questioning,
police Sgt. Bob Burns said.
A resident of the rooming house,
John McCauley, 59, was arrested

yesterday for investigation of
being an accessory to homicide,
Enloe said. Authorities said they
believe he helped Puente dig the
graves of the victims.
"We do not believe that this
could have been done solely by
herself," Enloe said. "We know
she's had people help her dig the
holes."
Puente, who is on parole for her
1982 conviction for drugging and
robbing three people, was inter
viewed by police after the first
body was discovered Friday but
released for lack of evidence.
The woman apparently had
been cashing some of the victims'
Social Security checks for several
months, Enloe said. He said the

motive in the slayirigs was
believed to be robbery.
Authorities cordoned off the
two-story home and yard while
officers with picks, shovels and
an earth-mover excavated the
grounds, hunting for more
corpses. The fifth body was found
about noon yesterday, wrapped in
a sheet in a shallow grave near
a driveway.
Earlier, police had said the four
bodies found Friday and Saturday
showed "no overt signs of vio
lence," and that the victims may
have died by poisoning.
At least one of the bodies, a
woman "wrapped like a mummy"
in a tablecloth, had been buried
since April, investigators said.
