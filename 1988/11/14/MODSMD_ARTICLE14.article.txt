Shooting spree kills 1, wounds 3
WEST GARDINER, Maine (AP) — A man
posing as a policeman killed a state official and
wounded three other people in a two-state shoot
ing spree believed linked to his firing from a
home for the retarded, police said yesterday.
The man killed himself while police chased him
at speeds up to 90 mph.
Alan Matterson, former head of the Mechanic
Falls group home, shot the home's former book
keeper, two officials involved in regulating such
homes and one of their relatives. One was
upgraded from critical to serious condition last
night.
The series of shootings spanned about 100 miles
in New Hampshire and Maine within less than
four hours late Saturday and early yesterday,
said state police spokesman Stephen McCausland.
Matterson, 36, was spotted near Gardiner and
two state police cars pursued him at high speeds.
The state troopers saw Matterson shoot himself

during the chase, McCausland said. That sent
his car careening off the road, becoming airborne
for a moment before it landed in a field.
