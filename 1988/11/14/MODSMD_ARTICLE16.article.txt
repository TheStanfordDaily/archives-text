## The 						scarlet letter 
### 
Reinstating the 'F'
is a proposal that
deserves 'no credit'

Although two-thirds
of the faculty responding to
a campus survey are in favor
of the idea, bringing back the 'F'
grade will not alleviate the percep
tion that grade inflation exists at
Stanford.
Accusations of grade inflation
crop up almost every year at Stan
ford. It is true that students in
Humanities and Sciences tend to
receive higher grades than those
in engineering.
But as the Committee on Aca
demic Appraisal and Achievement
remarked, "The notion that Stan
ford suffers from acute grade in
flation seems to be mythical."
Since 1975, the distribution of
grades has hardly changed. In
1986-87, 35 percent of the student
body received 'A' grades, the same
figure as 1975-76.
It would thus appear extreme to
tackle a problem that may not even
exist by reinstituting the 'F' grade,
which few students would receive
anyway. It is the distribution of
'As', 'Bs' and 'Cs' that gives rise
to charges of grade inflation.
It would, in fact, cause more
problems. The University made a
wise decision in 1969 when it
abolished the 'F' and should stick
to its position.
Contrary to the image of laid
back Stanford students, the vast
majority spend countless hours
studying. They realize they are
here to obtain an education and
are go to class with some of the
best and brightest students in the
nation. The competition is already
intense.
Adding the possibility of receiv

ing a permanent 'F' on their tran
scripts would only heighten the
pressure on students, who are al
ready motivated to do well.
When students perform poorly
in a class, there is usually a jus
tifiable reason, such as a family
emergency, a personal problem or
an overcommitted schedule. Per
haps, they were investigating a
particular academic discipline —
plenty of successful history majors
did not excel at chemistry.
Reinstating the 'F v grade may
cause many students simply to
avoid a challenging class within or
outside their major, fearing a per
manent black mark should they not
perform to expectations. There are
only so many pass/no credit classes
a student can take. Thus, the
benefits of a liberal, diverse edu
cation would be more limited.
Many who scorn the "no-credit"
system apparently think those who
drop a class do so happily and with
out compunction. However, many
who accept "no-credits" have al
ready spent countless hours toiling
in these subjects.
In dropping the class, a substan
tial amount of work has gone down
the drain. With a reduced load, a
student has also basically wasted
part of his or her tuition and may
be put on academic probation for
not carrying enough units. These
factors do not make a "no-credit"
a joyful experience.
Moreover, if students habitually
receive "no-credits," their tran
scripts will reflect a limited num
ber of units each quarter. Most
employers and graduate schools
can readily ask students about
their records if they so choose.
However, Stanford's obligation
is to its students — not to graduate
schools or employers. The refusal
to compute GPA's and class rank
is a reflection of this spirit. The
"no-credit" should also continue to
be part of the tradition.
