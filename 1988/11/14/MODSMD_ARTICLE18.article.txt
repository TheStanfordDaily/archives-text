## When diets become deadly 
### 
TODAY'S COLUMN is difficult to
write. Entire books have been pub
lished on the subject. The words
of one or two columns cannot encapsulate
the scope of the problem, nor the pain
endured by those who suffer from an
eating disorder.
Too many readers know exactly what
I am talking about.
Imagine a woman who places much of
her self-esteem upon her weight; who
wastes time and intellectual energy — in
classes, at night, in the library — talking
about dieting, planning, obsessing over
what she'll eat, what she ate, or binging.
She is not necessarily overweight, but
views herself as fat, and inflicts a cruel
level of self-abuse and guilt upon herself
when she does overeat. She sees her
weight as the root of her problems. While
her problems may not be readily appar
ent, she may slowly withdraw from
friends or activities as her sense of self
worth falls.
Indeed, food plays an inordinant role
in the lives of many women. According
to a three-year old Cowell Student Health
Center survey of approximately 2,000 stu
dents, 93 percent of the women responded
that currently they were, or over the past
month had been, on a diet.
Are 93 percent of the women at Stan
ford overweight?
The question is posed by sophomore
Kirsten Sword, coordinator of the out
reach and support group "Body-Image,
Food and Self-Esteem."
"Basically, it indicates that something
else is going on," says Sword. "What
constitutes normal behavior around food

for most women at Stanford isn't healthy
behavior. Just because everyone is con
cerned with dieting doesn't mean they
should be."
She estimates that nearly one-third of
the women at Stanford have "a dangerous
relationship with food." This relationship
need not fit the strict, diagnostic defini
tion of an eating disorder.
Anorexia, or self-induced starvation,
and bulimia, the "binge purge syndrome,"
are unhealthy at the least, and are deadly
in the extreme. Purges involve not only
self-induced vomiting but also the use of
laxatives and diuretics, fasting, and ex
cessive exercise.
Due to ambiguity within the fields of
psychology and psychiatry, researchers
and therapists work from different be
havioral definitions for eating disorders.
Consequently, measures of disorders vary
widely, from one percent to one-third of
college women.
Perhaps an eating disorder should be
defined as any time food and diet become
the determining factors in the way some
one organizes her life.
Eating disorders are symptomatic of
often unrelated, underlying problems. At
Stanford, the pressure to succeed can be
intense. Because our society so strongly
equates success with thinness for women,
food becomes the manifestation of those
underlying problems. Thus, the focus be
comes one's weight rather than problems,
which are not addressed.
The number of women that seek and
receive help is low at Stanford. Since
1978, 300 women with bulimia have
visited CAPS.

However, based on personal experience
many students would agree with Sword
that a great number of women practice
dangerous eating behaviors.
Because much remains to be under
stood about eating disorders and related
issues of food and self-image, a panel of
women visits dorms to speak on their
experiences and answer questions. The
popular outreach program has been
booked all quarter.
According to Sword, "We have found
that after our presentations, there are
always women who come forward and
share their experiences. Many.ask
available resources."
The focus of "Body-Image, Food and
Self-Esteem" is both to increase aware
ness among students and professionals
on campus, and to help those who feel
that food plays too great a role in their
lives. Through weekly support group
meetings and referrals to on- and off
campus help, anyone who is interested
may find "a place to start."
Clearly, an odd and unhealthy relation
ship often exists between women and
food. And the problem is widespread on
this campus.

popular outreach program has been
booked all quarter.
According to Sword, "We have found
that after our presentations, there are
always women who come forward and
share their experiences. Many.ask
available resources."
The focus of "Body-Image, Food and
Self-Esteem" is both to increase aware
ness among students and professionals
on campus, and to help those who feel
that food plays too great a role in their
lives. Through weekly support group
meetings and referrals to on- and off
campus help, anyone who is interested
may find "a place to start."
Clearly, an odd and unhealthy relation
ship often exists between women and
food. And the problem is widespread on
this campus.
