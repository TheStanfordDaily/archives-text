## TAs provide opportunities for genuine learning 
### 
I WAS MORE THAN A LITTLE
upset when I began to read the
Nov. 4 and Nov. 10 Daily articles
concerning cuts in Teaching Assistant's
salaries in the Department of Humani
ties and Sciences.
In some of the large lecture classes
quality TAs are essential to the learn
ing experience. Two or three hundred
students can't possibly have access to
one professor. Consequently, discussion
sections and time spent with TAs
during office hours or review sessions
are the only opportunities that I have
to clarify difficult concepts. Sections

and helpful TAs provide an opportu
nity for some genuine learning to take
place.
I was surprised to read the comment
of Humanities and Sciences Financial
Officer Nancy Padgett who asserts in
the Nov. 4 article that "there were too
many sections out there that were too
small."
Most of my sections contain over 20
students and, although this is better
than the outrageous 30-35 student
average that Padgett recommends, I
still feel that sections are crowded and
do not allow for enough dialogue to

occur between TAs and their students.
Padgett's suggestion is simply incon
ceivable to me.
Thirty-five students and one TA
can't possibly develop a truly inclusive
discussion. I also feel that large sec
tions burden TAs when it comes to
correcting midterms and papers. The
amount of help TAs can give is usually
directly proportional to the number
and size of their sections.
TAs are an important part of our
undergraduate education (especially as
freshmen and sophomores when we are
taking so many large lecture classes).

If Stanford and the Department of
Humanities and Sciences hold dear a
commitment to quality undergraduate
education then they must acknowledge
the importance of TAs to the under
graduate learning experience and find
other innovative solutions to their
budget difficulties.
We have invested a lot in our educa
tion here at Stanford and I hope to see
a responsible response to the problem
that doesn't deny students the quality
that Stanford promises.
