# Proposition 103's impact uncertain
## 
### Ravi Desai Staff writer With wire reports 
Californians are trying to come
to grips with the aftermath of
Tuesday's passage of Proposition
103, the Voter Revolt insurance
initiative, and some Stanford pro
fessors believe the initiative will
have negative effects on both the
industry and the consumer.
On one side, insurance compan
ies are denouncing the measure's
mandatory 20-percent cut in in
surance rates and premiums.
Meanwhile, consumers, the in
tended benefactors of the proposi
tion, are now finding it difficult
to obtain insurance. Neither side
remains certain of the conse
quences of the measure's narrow
passage.
According to Economics Prof.
Ronald McKinnon, "Proposition
103 failed to address the funda
mental issues" of the insurance
problem, namely the rising costs
of insurance and settlement.
McKinnon said the measure ad
versely affects both the insurers
and the consumers. McKinnon
favors curbing both legal fees and
insurance rates as a solution.

Roger Freeman, senior fellow
emeritus at Hoover, said Prop.
103 causes considerable difficulty.
He called the rate reduction a
"hollow promise" that would not
last if the insurance companies
are to remain solvent.
Economics Prof, and Nobel
Laureate Kenneth Arrow said the
initial reductions would be "pain
ful" for the insurance companies.
He said, however, that the 20-
percent reduction in premiums
might be temporary.
According to Arrow, for the in
surance companies to remain sol
vent and break even, the rates
would eventually have to be in
creased. That's assuming, how
ever, that Prop. 103 is even con
stitutional.
Immediately following the elec
tion, insurance companies filed
suit against the measure, ques
tioning its constitutionality, and
the California Supreme Court
responded by ordering an injunc
tion on implementing the proposi
tion until that is decided.
If the measure is voided, the
insurance industry will revert to
current law, which gives insurance
companies more freedom to de
termine rate increases and
premiums.
Otherwise, California is facing
the prospect of a mass exodus of
insurance companies from the
state. As a result, Democratic
state Senators Alan Robbins and
David Roberti have threatened to
introduce legislation that would
inflict severe penalties on insur
ance companies that pull out or
stop selling insurance in Califor
nia.
Freeman said the insurance in
dustries will move out of the state
if the measure is enforced. Ac
cording to Freeman, this is a very
real threat and not a "bluff."
In addition, the senators said
they are requesting Chief Execu
tive Officers from several major
insurance companies to appear at
a legislative hearing in Los An
geles this Friday. If the company
officials do not voluntarily appear,
the senators said they will hand
out subpoenas.

"If they're retaliating against
the voters, we will retaliate
against them," Roberti said.
Arrow also noted the measure s
ban on using geography as a
determinant for rates would help
urban dwellers by lowering their
rates and increase insurance costs
for rural and suburban residents.
