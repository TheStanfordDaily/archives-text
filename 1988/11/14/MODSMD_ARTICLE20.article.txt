# Res Ed policy stifles cultural experience

### 
The cancellation of the tribal dance
at Lambda Nu raises the crucial issue
of how we should judge an incident to
be racist. Lambda Nu did not cancel
the party because the house decided it
was racist.
At a house meeting that carefully
considered every aspect of the party,
the residents concluded that both the
concept and the specific elements of
the party were neither racially degrad
ing nor culturally specific in nature.
The party recreates near universal
phenomena of "tribal" types of cultures
— a cultural type that is the heritage
of all humanity.
Specifically, the experience of tribal
dance is recreated through drumming,
decorations, painting and dancing —
common elements to every "tribal"
culture. No specific culture is singled
out and copied. Therefore, this is not a
racist mockery of another culture;
rather, it is an attempt to enrich our
selves by some experiences that main

stream, white, western culture, unfor
tunately, no longer experiences.
The house cancelled the party be
cause the present interpretation of the
Fundamental Standard, in relation to
alleged racist incidents, leaves Lambda
Nu wide open for an uryust charge of
racism.
According to the Residential Educa
tion letter distributed to all RAs, an
event is judged as racist by its subjec
tive reaction in the community, and
not on a rational assessment as to
whether or not the event degrades
another culture.
Therefore, anyone could have walked
into the party, misconstrued our ac
tions, complained that they were of
fended and Lambda Nu could have
been held in violation of the Funda
mental Standard. This is analogous to
a court of law rendering a verdict of
guilty, merely because there is a
prosecuting party.
This twisted notion of justice has
some ludicrous ramifications:
1) We cannot have Halloween parties
because a fundamentalist Christian
organization could be offended at the
glorification of witches, demons, ghosts
and other Satanic beings.

2) We cannot have luaua, toga par
ties or fiestas.
3) In fact, we cannot even dance at
parties, because our popular social
dance forms are nearly wholly derived
from secular and sacred African
dances.
The above absurdities are more than
possible if an incident is judged as
racist merely by its subjective reaction
in the community. Rather, an incident
should be deemed racist if a rational
assessment of the event itself proves
that it degrades another group.
There is even a more disturbing
attitude that underlies the pressured
cancellation of the party. There seems
to be some notion of cultural isolation
and untouchability, i.e., "this is mine,
don't touch."
We have already shown this party to
be a celebration of the common tribal
heritage of humanity. But nevertheless,
certain people see the party as recreat
ing cultural items that do not belong
to the party-goers, therefore these
people do not have the right to experi
ence them.
We need to challenge this notion of
cultural untouchability as stifling to
the possibilities of enriching one's life

at Stanford.
What a monotonous and sterile life
we would lead if the only ideas and
experiences allowed were those of
mainstream, bourgeois, white western
culture. To fully understand and exper
ience the possibilites of human life, we
cannot be isolated from both the ideas
and activities of ways of life into which
we were not born.
For example, to understand the pow
erful experience of dancing to poly
rhythmic tribal drumming, you cannot
just read a book or have an educa
tional symposium, you must experience
it directly, using the materials you
have available.
If we are going to march under the
banner of cultural diversity and appre
ciation, we cannot accept the present
interpretation of the Fundamental
Standard — an interpretation that
prevents enriching ourselves by experi
encing other types of cultures. The
racial struggle is about opening fron
tiers and increasing appreciation. Let's
actively strive to open these frontiers.
