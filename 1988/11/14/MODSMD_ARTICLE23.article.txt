PASADENA, Calif. — Even Job never
had it this bad.
With help from the No. 6 team in the
nation and the strangest play since The
Play, the Stanford football team suffered
yet another excruciating defeat, falling to
the UCLA Bruins 27-17 in the Rose Bowl
Saturday.

Bruins 27, Cardinal 17

Stanford is now 3-6-1 on the season,
1-5-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference. The
Bruins, 9-1, 6-1, play USC Saturday for
the league title.
"Anything in a game can happen," senior
cornerback Brad Cook said. "Even though
it's disappointing you realize you just have
to go out there and play hard. It's disap
pointing though."
The Cardinal began slowly as UCLA
drove to the Stanford three their first
possesion. But a goal-line stand held the
Bruins to three points.
Two sacks of Stanford quarterback Jason
Palumbis and a 35-yard punt gave the
Bruins the ball again at the Cardinal 43.
Then, five plays later, tailback Brian Brown
ran the ball seven yards for a score to
make it 10-0.
After the score, Palumbis led the Cardi
nal from its own 18 to the Bruin 29 before
throwing an interception to free safety Eric
Turner. Before the interception Palumbis
was 9-for-9 for 71 yards but the intercep
tion was the last pass he would throw
Saturday.
Outside linebacker Rob Hinckley (re
member that name) forced a Brown fumble
on UCLA's second play and outside line
backer Chuck Robinson recovered. New
Cardinal signal-caller Brian Johnson
entered the game.
"I was surprised," Johnson said. "There
wasn't any foresight to see when it would

happen." Johnson, who had started 11 con
secutive games dating to last season, was
pulled at halftime from the game at Notre
Dame Oct. 1 and has served as the backup
since.
According to Stanford Coach Jack El way,
"I thought that Brian was doing well in
practice so I thought we'd take a look at
him." Elway said that he didn't like the
way Palumbis had started the game. "(It
was) probably a series of things when
people were there and we weren't getting
the ball there."
But if Palumbis was 9-for-9 before the
interception, how could he not be getting
the ball to people? "I thought I was playing
pretty well myself," Palumbis said, "until
I made one bad read. I saw the free safety
step up and I read a blitz but he must
have backed off and I didn't see it. . ..
Brian did a great job."
"I thought he was doing a good job,"
Johnson said. "I was surprised at the move
but I was surprised at the move at Notre
Dame also. ... As we were going onto the
field I heard my name. My biggest problem
was finding my mouthpiece; it was in my
sock."
Johnson got a few bad breaks right off
the bat as he had two balls deflected that
ended up as interceptions sandwiching a
failed Bruin drive. UCLA then had the ball
again and Aikman led the Bruins to the
Cardinal three again.
Tailback Shawn Wills got nothing on
first down then fullback Mark Estwick got
a yard on second. Aikman then rolled right,
spotted tight end Charles Arbuckle in the
end zone and threw. He overthrew Ar
buckle, however, who barely tipped the ball
to Code, three yards deep in the endzone.
Cook took off with the ball with only
Aikman between him and six points but
he slowed down to set up a block on Aikman
and was caught from behind.

explained. "They threw to the man behind
him. He tipped it and it came right to
