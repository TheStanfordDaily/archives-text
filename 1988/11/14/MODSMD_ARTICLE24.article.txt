# Hinckley pummels Bruins
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
PASADENA, Calif. - UCLA de
fensive tackle Mike Lodish burst
through the Stanford offensive
line and made a bee line for quar
terback Brian Johnson.
Lodish knocked the ball loose
from Johnson's hand. Before
gravity had a chance to bring the
loose ball to the ground, Lodish
snared it and streaked 17 yards
into the end zone.
It was probably the defensive
play of the season for the Bruins
and quite possibly the best of
Lodish's illustrious career.
But, were the game on national
television, it wouldn't have been
enough to earn him defensive
player of the game honors.
That award would have gone to
Stanford's Rob Hinckley.
The junior linebacker played an
oustanding game and almost
made it look easy. He recorded 20
tackles, 11 of them unassisted.
Among the tackles were 6V2 for
losses including a stunning AV-z
sacks.
And for good measure, Hinckley
also caused a UCLA fumble.
Even though the outstanding
Jono Tunney was on the sidelines
with an injury the Cardinal de
fense excelled against the vaunted
Bruin offense.
The swarming Stanford pass
rush was in the face of UCLA
quarterback Troy Aikman — and

Aikman, the erstwhile
shoo-in for the Heis
man, was obivously
rattled by the con
stant pressure.

all over the rest of him as well
— throughout the game. Stanford
recorded seven sacks.
Aikman, the erstwhile shoo-in
for the Heisman, was obivously
rattled by the constant pressure.
For the day he would only com
plete 13-of-24 for 135 yards. Okla
homa State's Barry Sanders and
crosstown rival Rodney Peete at
USC are probably both ahead of
Aikman on Heisman voters' lists
at this point.
Hinckley for his own part was
unimpressed with his achieve
ments. "It was nice to do things
we wanted to do," he said. "Once
again we didn't do enough. It was
disappointing."
Asked if he did anything special,
Hinckley responded he was "just
trying to do the things I was
trying to do all year."
Hinckley noted that UCLA was
forced into a number of situations,
such as third-and-long, where the
defense could anticipate the pass
and that created a number of op
portunities for sacks.
Yet, after a phenomenal day, the

thing that mattered most to
Hinckley was the defeat. "It's bet
ter to play good than bad,"
Hinckley said. "But the reason
you play good is to win."
Describing his personal success,
Hinckley said, "It's not much con
solation."
Hinckley noted it was easy to
be modest "because we're not win
ning."
"Everyone can brag about how
good they're doing where they're
winning," Hinckley added.
"We're proud of the way we
played .. . especially down by the
goal line," Hinckley said, express
ing some team pride. "We're just
coming up short."
If the outcome had been
reversed, one could imagine a
beaming Hinckley telling the
story instead of the dejected one
at the Rose Bowl.
This weekend, it wasn't to be.
Hinckley and his teammates will
practice hard all week and try to
do it again next Saturday.
Maybe some of the breaks will
fall their way for once.
Card notes
Hinckley was named NCAA defen
sive player of the week by Sports Il
lustrated, and is one of two finalists
for the same award in The Sporting
News.
On one of his sacks, Hinckley said
Aikman fumbled the ball into his
hands. "The ref didn't see it,"
Hinckley said. "[Aikman] wasn't
anywhere near holding onto that ball."

"Everyone can brag about how
good they're doing where they're
winning," Hinckley added.
"We're proud of the way we
played .. . especially down by the
goal line," Hinckley said, express
ing some team pride. "We're just
coming up short."
If the outcome had been
reversed, one could imagine a
beaming Hinckley telling the
story instead of the dejected one
at the Rose Bowl.
This weekend, it wasn't to be.
Hinckley and his teammates will
practice hard all week and try to
do it again next Saturday.
Maybe some of the breaks will
fall their way for once.
