the most of her first starting op

winning streak to 20 by pulling
out a pair of nail-biters this week
end, besting Oregon State Friday
night 15-1, 15-8, 17-19, 15-6 and
squeaking past Oregon Saturday
15-7, 14-16, 5-15, 15-8, 15-6.
The Cardinal now boasts a 25-1
overall record, 15-1 in the Pacific
10 Conference. Oregon State fell
to 12-22, 1-15 after Friday's con
test, while Oregon drops to 8-18,
2-15.
Though Stanford, which holds
a firm lock on second place in the
league, was expected to rout the
Pac-10 basement-dwelling Oregon
schools, providence made other
plans. Starting setter Lara Asper

sprained her ankle en route to
practice Thursday night, forcing
Anderson into the starting spot
light for the first time in her col
legiate career.
Though handicapped all week
end by poor passing, which made
running a balanced offense a dif
ficult task, the sophomore
emerged unscathed and victori
ous. Anderson committed few
mistakes and did not falter when
the pressure was on, delivering
manageable sets to her competent
hitters.
"I thought we played well, con
sidering the line-up," Stanford
Coach Don Shaw said. "We ha
ven't had Anderson setting like
that from start to finish. I thought
she did a real nice job. When we
hit .309 as a team, that should
show how well Karen set."
Such was the team percentage
in Friday night's contest, when
the small, scrappy and determined
Beavers refused to be intimidated
by the nation's No. 2 team.
Though blown out in the first and
second games, OSU came back
with a vengeance in the third,
playing defense like a team pos
sessed.
Oregon State started the game

strongly, pulling out to a surpris
ingly quick 2-7 lead. The Cardinal
soon tied the game at eight, but
the Beavers responded rapidly
with several more points thanks
to the unorthodox but effective
serving of Julie Leamon, who re
corded an astonishing five aces in
the match.
"She seems to be very success
ful against us," Shaw said.
"Looking at the stats over the
season, that serve isn't really that
effective against anyone else, but
for some reason it causes us all
kinds of problems."
Serving was another problem.
The Cardinal committed a dis
couraging 10 service errors, most
in the third game, which only ag
gravated an already frustrating
situation.
After finally notching a 16-15
advantage, Stanford saw the door
begin to close and finally shut 15
plays later, when OSU hitter
Helen Hoonhout scored the game
winning kill.
"The third game, we got a little
sloppy, but I've got to give Oregon
State credit," Shaw said. "That
team fought hard. I respect those
