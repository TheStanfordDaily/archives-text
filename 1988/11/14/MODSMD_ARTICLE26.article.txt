# An emotional odyssey
## 
### 
PASADENA, Calif. â€” It has
probably been said before by
someone, but the emotional
gamut at a football game is not
unlike that found in real life.

All last week there was an
ticipation among Stanford fans
about what might transpire the
coming Saturday against
UCLA in the Rose Bowl. Every
one knew Stanford was playing
v/ell and was a much better
team than its losing record
showed. And the mighty Bruins
looked very vulnerable after
two weeks of poor play, includ
ing blowing a huge lead against
Washington State, a team
Stanford should also have
beaten just a week ago. The
anticipation felt by Stanford
fans could be likened to what
is felt during the days leading
up to that long-awaited first
date with someone you've eyed
for weeks.
There was also fear. Fear
that the Bruin machine might
get untracked and steamroll
the Cardinal, which had beaten
UCLA in its last two trips down
South. Fear that that first date
could be a total flop is quite
similar. And Stanford fans saw
their fears realized through the
first 25 minutes of play.
As per custom, fans were fed
their usual dose of Jon Volpe
up the middle on third and
short. Twice the mammoth
Bruin line stopped the 5-foot-7
star in his tracks. Despair
began to set in among the Stan
ford faithful as UCLA was
marching to an apparent 17-0
lead. This kind of despair corr
elates strongly with that con
fronting a student who knows
very little through the first sec
tion of his midterm exam.
Then, just as the Bruins had

first and goal, lightning struck.
The student found section two
to be exactly what he had
studied most. Unheralded de
fensive back Brad Cook picked
off a Troy Aikman pass in the
end zone and returned it deep
into UCLA territory. The Stan
ford faithful had hope. Sudden
ly, with a couple of minutes
remaining in the half, the
Brian Johnson-led offense
made it 10-7, not 17-0. That
student just completed section
two of the exam and is back
on his feet.
Riding the crest of the wave,
the Cardinal crowd grew rabid
when Aikman was sacked in
the shadow of the Bruin goal
posts. Stanford would get a
shot at a tying field goal before
the end of the half. Disbelief
came over the Stanford sup
porters as they watched
Johnson lead the Cardinal to
the go-ahead TD with 50
seconds left in the half.
The two teams then hit a
comfort zone midway through
the third quarter. They traded
field goals and the crowd
settled in to see if Johnson
could move the Cardinal once
again.
Then tragedy struck. Settled
in the pocket, Johnson peered
to the left, ball held firmly in
both hands at waist level. A
UCLA rusher flailed at it as
he was blocked by Johnson.
The ball popped up in the air
and softly settled in the Bruin's
arms, leaving him open pasture
to a UCLA lead. Half the Stan
ford rooters, seated in the far
end zone, did not know what
had happened. All were in a
state of shock. Silent shock.
Then a surprising thing hap
pened among the Stanford
faithful. Rather than disap
pointment over a blown chance
at a win, there was the reso
lution that the Cardinal had
made a superior team "work
for this win," in the words of
one undaunted fan. And yet,
there was still the helplessness
of knowing that if a flailing
arm hadn't knocked the ball
loose . . .
