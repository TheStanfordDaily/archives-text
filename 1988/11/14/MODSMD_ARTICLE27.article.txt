# Gray shines in Fresno
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Carol Gray led the Cardinal
in Saturday's District-8 cross
country championship meet at
Fresno with a dramatic come
from-behind charge that
earned her second place and
almost carried her to a win.
Men'B coach Scott Chisam
was watching his team warm
up when Gray took off with
about a half-mile to go in the
race. She blew by Pacific 10
Conference Champion Liz Wil
son of Oregon and California's
Sally Wood.
"She came in with the best
kick I've ever seen. Another
200 yards and she could have
won the race," Chisam said.
Gray let someone bear the
early pace after taking out the
pack and getting out-kicked
two weeks ago at Pac-lOs.
Showing her three full years of
experience on the farm, she
stuck to the gameplan that she
and coach Brooks Johnson
devised.
"The race strategy was for
her to go out and relax, and
be up with the leaders with a
mile to go" according to
Johnson. That she did in con
vincing style, setting a new per
sonal record for the five
kilometer race in 16:43.9.
The men's team was beset
by several misfortunes and

finished in sixth place. They
were outrun by Oregon and
Washington for the two NCAA
Championship berths that
were up for grabs, but the mar
gin separating Stanford from
third-place UCLA was bad
luck.
Lightning struck twice with
two miles left in their 10K con
test. Junior Eric Mastalir, who
has been running with a nag
ging achilles tendon for most
of the season, was forced to
drop out. Fifth man Bill
Crowley subsequently was hit
in the head by a low branch,
requiring six stiches after the
race.
Junior Steve Miller was the
first Cardinal finisher in 11th
place, with senior captain
James Alborough next for the
Cardinal in 25th place overall.
"(Eric) has had a really gutsy
season", according to Miller.
Chisam admitted that without
Mastalir, the Cardinal would
lose much of its strength. "Up
until now, we've had pretty
much a picture-perfect season,"
he added.
Gray will be the only Cardi
nal representative at the NCAA
meet. While she had hoped to
go in the company of a full
Stanford contingent, the Stan
ford coaches were confident
that she would qualify.
"This was her best race of
the year," said Johnson.
