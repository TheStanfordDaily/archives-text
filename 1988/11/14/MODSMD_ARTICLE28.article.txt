# Polo enjoys weekend sweep over USC, UCLA
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
USC water polo coach John Williams' words came
back to haunt him this weekend.
The club coach of Stanford holeman Eric Blum
in high school, Williams advised Cardinal skipper
Dante Dettamanti not to bother recruiting the "slow
player".

Water Polo
Cardinal 13, Trojans 12
Cardinal 4, Bruins 3 *

But the skills Williams taught Blum were out in
force when the fifth-ranked Cardinal battled the
previously third-rated aquaflingers of Troy.
Blum merely broke out for seven goals Friday in
carrying Stanford to a 13-12 double-overtime tri
umph and the first half of a Southern California
sweep. The Cardinal continued its underdog tenacity
Saturday, defeating second-ranked UCLA, 4-3, to
raise its record to 21-9, 2-3 in Pacific 10 Conference
play.
"Eric was the story of the game. He singlehan
dedly broke open the contest, giving one of the
greatest performances I've ever seen. In my 12
years here no Stanford player has ever scored seven
goals in one game. And his play was contagious,"
Dettamanti said.
Blum and Co.'s performance is all the more
noteworthy considering the squad did not begin the
day playing national-champion caliber polo. USC
took early control of the contest with a score by
holeman Zoltan Berty in the opening 10 seconds,
and went on to go up 7-2 in the second quarter of
play. At halftime the Cardinal trailed by four, 7-3.
"Everything we could do wrong we did wrong,"
Dettamanti said. "We missed one-on-nobody shots,
six-on-five opportunities, and played terrible de
fense. It was the worst we played all year."

Water polo wonder Erik Blum stuffed the ball into the opponents net eight times
over the weekend, and had two assists, in the Cardinal's sweep of (JSC and UCLA.
The second half a completely
changed squad took to the water,
as the Blum-led Cardinal squad
scored six unanswered goals,
taking a 8-7 lead before surren
dering the game tying strike to
the Trojans to send the contest
into its first overtime.
Each squad answered the
other's shots, and an 11-11 score
after three extra minutes of play
necessitated a second extra peri
od. With a 12th goal under its
belt, the Cardinal held USC score
less until the Trojans tied the con
test for a third time with only 12
seconds remaining.
With only two OTs allowed un
der NCAA rules, the contest ap
peared to be headed into sudden

death play.
But once again it was Blum to
the rescue. With no time remain
ing the junior let off a backhand
shot that nipped the top left cor
ner of the posts before going in
to give the Cardinal its biggest
come-from-behind victory of the
year.
• "Blum was a demi-god. That
play was one of the most exciting
things I've seem in a long time.
It was the type of play we needed
to take us over the edge heading
into the NCAA championships,"
fieldman Andrew Lawson said.
After the high scoring shootout
Friday, Saturday's contest against
the previously No. 1-ranked and
undefeated Bruins proved to be a
defensive battle.
While Blum again rose to the
occasion to help the Cardinal to
its second upset in as many days,
goalie Todd Kemp was also the

man of the hour. The two-time
All American held the usually
potent UCLA squad to three goals
while recording 12 saves to
preserve Stanford's one goal vic
tory.
With its newly reinstated zone
defense Stanford was able to suc
cessfully stop the Bruin's nation
ally acclamined two-meter men
Alex Rousseau and Hank Peter
son for the first time this season,
allowing each only one goal.
Although Stanford could only
muster four scores, one fewer
than it managed in overtime the
previous day, it was enough for
the team's first win of the year
over UCLA.
"Todd played an incredible
game. To shut down the Bruin
holemen we left the outside open,
and Todd saved everything. He
deserves all the credit for the
win," Blum said.
