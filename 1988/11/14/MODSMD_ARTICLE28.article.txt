# Polo enjoys weekend sweep over USC, UCLA
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
USC water polo coach John Williams' words came
back to haunt him this weekend.
The club coach of Stanford holeman Eric Blum
in high school, Williams advised Cardinal skipper
Dante Dettamanti not to bother recruiting the "slow
player".

Water Polo
Cardinal 13, Trojans 12
Cardinal 4, Bruins 3 *

But the skills Williams taught Blum were out in
force when the fifth-ranked Cardinal battled the
previously third-rated aquaflingers of Troy.
Blum merely broke out for seven goals Friday in
carrying Stanford to a 13-12 double-overtime tri
umph and the first half of a Southern California
sweep. The Cardinal continued its underdog tenacity
Saturday, defeating second-ranked UCLA, 4-3, to
raise its record to 21-9, 2-3 in Pacific 10 Conference
play.
"Eric was the story of the game. He singlehan
dedly broke open the contest, giving one of the
greatest performances I've ever seen. In my 12
years here no Stanford player has ever scored seven
goals in one game. And his play was contagious,"
Dettamanti said.
Blum and Co.'s performance is all the more
noteworthy considering the squad did not begin the
day playing national-champion caliber polo. USC
took early control of the contest with a score by
holeman Zoltan Berty in the opening 10 seconds,
and went on to go up 7-2 in the second quarter of
play. At halftime the Cardinal trailed by four, 7-3.
"Everything we could do wrong we did wrong,"
Dettamanti said. "We missed one-on-nobody shots,
six-on-five opportunities, and played terrible de
fense. It was the worst we played all year."
