# Fencers dispose of competition
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Editorial staff 
The Stanford fencing teams
have begun a busy winter season
a little early this year, and just
as the early bird catches the
worm, the Cardinal put some
positive numbers in the 'W'
column with wins against San
Francisco State, UC-Davis, and
UC-Santa Cruz.
Davis and SF State are both
club teams, which means that
they cannot participate in any
NCAA postseason events.
The women's team had no
problem disposing of either
squad however, showing the
poise and finesse one would ex

pect from the defending Western
region champions.
The Santa Cruz Banana Slugs
posed a bit more of a problem,
sliming their way to seven points
before the Cardinal could put
them away in the 16-point
match.
The Cardinal women were led
by Elizabeth Stillman who
"went right through everybody
with no problem," according to
Stanford women's Coach Sherry
Posthumus.
Another standout on the
women's team was Grace
Chang. The freshman helped
the Cardinal to four of its nine
points against the Slugs by win
ning all of her bouts against the

pesky mollusks.
On the men's side, all three
matches were close, but Stan
ford pulled off victories. The
Cardinal was at somewhat of a
handicap, because two of its best
fencers, foilist Nick Braven and
saberist Leonard D'Amico were
in Chicago trying to qualify for
the Junior World teams.
Once again, however it was a
player straight out of the fenc
ing classes that came through
for Stanford and sealed the vic
tory aginst the Banana Slugs.
Derek Stordahl, a foilist,
"really saved the day for us,"
Posthumus said of the junior's
role in a 14-13 win.
