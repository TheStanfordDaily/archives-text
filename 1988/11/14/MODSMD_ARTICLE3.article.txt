### Jay Bhattacharya Staff writer With wire reports 
Stressing the need to fight a history
of an oppressive Soviet government, both
Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov and
Stanford physicist Sidney Drell yesterday
praised those who have challenged the
old Soviet system.
At a meeting of the National Academy
of Sciences in Washington, D.C., Sak
harov said Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev is trying to break traditional resis
tance to reform. He is centralizing polit
ical power through new laws and consti
tutional changes that are "tantamount
to a coup," Sakharov said.
Although supportive of Gorbachev's
progressive agenda, Sakharov said the
Soviet leader may be trying to push his
policies too quickly, which may cause a

conservative backlash.
"It looks like he (Gorbachev) was faced
with the necessity to get all the power
in his hands," he said.
Sakharov, age 67, was internally exiled

in the Soviet Union from
1980 to 1986 for his op
position to the Soviet in
vasion of Afghanistan.
Gorbachev was responsi
ble for Sakharov's re
lease.
While Sakharov fo
cused his speech on Gor
bachev, Drell emphasized
Sakharov's own struggle

against oppression.
"He risked everything and sacrificed
much in his support of prisoners of con
science and opposition of oppression,"
Drell said.
He lauded Sakharov for his stand for

human rights, despite persecution by his
own government.
"(Sakharov) is a moral leader in search
of ethical principles for a humanity striv
ing for peace, for progress and for human
dignity," Drell said. Sakharov, age 67,
won the Nobel Peace prize in 1975 and
is a close personal friend of Drell. The
two met at a seminar organized by the
Soviet Academy of the Sciences in 1973
but contact between them has been lim
ited due to Soviet travel restrictions.
Drell, who introduced Sakharov at the
Academy meeting, described the remark
able contributions that Sakharov has
made to science, human rights and world
peace.
Describing just some of the contribu
tions Sakharov has made to science, Drell
said, "He is a great scientist whose bril
liant career as a theoretical physicist is
distinguished by seminal research contri

butions to fundamental physics, including
the behavior of plasmas and the proper
ties of elementary particles."
While Sakharov received international

attention for his develop
ment of the Soviet hydro
gen bomb, his outspoken
criticism of Soviet
human rights policies
has won him even wider
acclaim in the West.
Sakharov warned that
some of the changes
taking place in the Soviet
Union are "dangerous

and complicated."
"Many laws which are being adopted
. . . are a step backwards in reality," he
said.
"I believe he (Gorbachev) is doing it
with good intentions," he said. "Nonethe
less, I consider it a dangerous develop

ment."
Sakharov cautioned that a failure by
Gorbachev to implement glasnost and
perestroika could prove disasterous to the
Soviet Union.
"The victory of reactionary forces . . .
would mean not merely a return to the
era of stagnation . . . (but the Soviet Un
ion) wouldn't have money for social pro
grams, for glasnost. However, for the
buildup of our military, they would find
the funds anyway," he said.
Sakharov plans to visit President
Reagan in the White House today and
attend a board meeting of the Interna
tional Foundation for the Survival and
Development of Humanity, a Moscow
based group of which he is a director.
In addition to speaking engagements,
Sakharov's visit to the United States in
cluded a medical examination in Boston
for a heart condition.
