In a Nov. 1 article, The Daily
was incorrectly informed about
the circumstances surrounding a
racial incident at Dartmouth Col
lege. Students from the
Dartmouth Review were
suspended for harrassing a black
professor. The students provoked
the professor by entering his class
room with a camera and a hidden
tape recorder and refused to leave
the classroom when asked.
