### Janine DeFao Staff writer 
From churches to football teams, or
ganizations have similarities that fac
ulty and students here now have a
chance to explore through Stanford's
Center for Organizations Research,
which opened Friday.
"Organizations are central to every
thing we do. Everything is done in an
organization or with an organization,"
said Sociology Prof. Richard Scott, the
center's first director.
Organizations Research is the study
of "any collective system created to meet
goals," explained Scott, adding that it
is important to study different types of
organizations, including public, private,
professional and volunteer. Resides
studying the organizations themselves,
the center's researchers will also look
at management and decision-making
cases.
Linking together more than 60 or
ganizations research courses offered by
Stanford's varied graduate schools and

undergraduate departments, the center
will allow for better faculty collabora
tion. More than 76 faculty members
from departments and schools ranging
from the Graduate School of Business
to the Psychology Department will be
affiliated with the center.
The center's goals not only include
further basic and applied research, but
also undergraduate, graduate and
postgraduate training in organizational
theory and research, Scott said.
The center will also provide better
connections between the University and
industries. Such a link is important be
cause industries subsidize universities,
influencing which types of courses will
be offered, according to Scott.
Although Stanford has had an inter
disciplinary group of people working in
organizations research since 1972, Scott
said he believed that recently "the time
was right to move the level of collabora
tion one notch higher." The center will
provide "a much clearer center to con
nect with (researchers at] other univer
sities."

The center will not actually implement
any new courses and will not grant
degrees in organization studies.
Examples of courses that are consid
ered part of the organizations program
are Organizations: Theory and Manage
ment, Organizational Decision Making
and Power and Politics in Organiza
tions.
The University has committed some
core funding, but Scott declined to give
a figure. "It's enough to get started,"
he said.
On Friday, the Business School held
an inaugural reception for the new cen
ter. Organizations research scholars
from across the country also spoke Sat
urday at the center's first conference,
which focused on organizational change
and adaptation.
To stress the importance of organi
zations research, Scott quoted Prof.
Peter Drucker of Claremont Graduate
School: "Young people today will have
to learn organizations the way their
forefathers learned farming."
