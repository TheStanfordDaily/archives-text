# Faculty downplay Baker's role in Bush White House
## 
### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
Stanford professors and Hoover Insti
tution scholars expressed mixed reac
tions yesterday to reports that James
Baker 111, newly designated Secretary
of State, will wield broad, possibly un
precedented, influence in President-elect
Bush's administration.
The lead story in Sunday's New York
Times concluded that Baker, a close
friend of Bush, will have wide influence
not only in foreign policy but also in
domestic and economic affairs in the
next administration.
Unidentified Bush aides told The
Times that pragmatic, moderate Repub
licans with close ties to Baker were likely
to fill other powerful policy positions in
the Bush administration, giving Baker
ability to help shape decisions well out

of the usual sphere of the secretary of
state.
"For all practical purposes, Jim Baker
will be deputy President," Edward Rol
lins, a Republican strategist with con
nections to Bush's transition team, told
The Times. "Excluding the president,
Baker will probably be the most power
ful ally of any president in modern times.
He will run the foreign policy area. His
judgement and respect in the domestic
policy will be very influential. No matter
what the issues, Bush will go to him
for advice and counsel. ... I can't think
of anyone comparable in any previous
administration."
Several Stanford professors disagreed
with Rollins and the article's conclu
sions.
"I tend to read stories like that with
a little bit of skepticism," said
John Ferejohn, professor of polit
ical science and Hoover senior fel
low. "No one can really know how
the Cabinet will operate until it's
in place."
"It strikes me as a bit hyper
bolic," agreed Political Science
Prof. Robert Packenham. Packen
ham, citing Robert Kennedy's in
fluence on his brother John Ken
nedy's decisions as an example,
argued that while Baker might
certainly have significant power,
the level would not be unprece
dented.
Richard Burress, an associate
director and senior fellow at Hoo
ver, said Baker would "have his
hands full as Secretary of State.
Running a department like that,
travelling like they do, conducting
negotiations like they do ... I
would be very surprised if he ac
tually spent that much time on
domestic matters."
Burress also disagreed with Rol

lins, suggesting that the Bush-
Baker relationship would be
similar to that between President
Eisenhower and his secretary of
state, John Foster Dulles.
Warren Christopher, former
president of the Stanford Board
of Trustees and deputy secretary
of state in the Carter administra
tion, agreed with The Times ar
ticle on some points. He said that
Baker would have "unusually
large influence," explaining,
"Since they've been together for
so long, I'd expect that the Pres
ident would consult him broadly."
Christopher, still a member of
the Stanford board, called Baker
"an excellent appointment," citing
his extensive experience and
knowledge in the areas of econom
ics and foreign policy.
While some Bush aides told The
Times that plans were not yet
definite, others suggested that
Richard Darman, Baker's former
deputy at the Treasury Depart
ment, would be appointed director
of the White House Office of Man
agement and Budget. The result
of this instatement could be ab
normal reach for a Secretary of
State into the budgetary and do
mestic matters of the OMB, The
Times reported.
In addition, Baker, a 58-year
old Texas lawyer, would be able
to exert unusually strong influ
ence in forming international and
domestic economic policy.
