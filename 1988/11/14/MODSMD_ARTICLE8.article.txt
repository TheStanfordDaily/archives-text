# Stanford group studies active Alaskan volcano

No phone, no electricity, no
radio — the brisk Alaskan wind
was the only music for a group
of Stanford professors and grad
uate students studying a volcano
in a remote area of Alaska last
summer.
The four members of the ex
pedition made two plane flights,
one bus ride on a dirt road and
a 10-mile hike to reach the object
of their study — Mount Katmai,
a 5,000-foot peak on Alaska's
southern coast.
"Most people go to fish for sal
mon or look at the bears," said
Peter Wallmann, a geology grad
uate student who participated in
the study.
But for the Stanford research
team and others investigating the
volcano, the mountain may hold
some answers to questions which
have long plagued geologists. For
example, by understanding how

molten rock flows underground,
scientists hope to develop methods
to predict volcanic eruptions.
"Our goal is to understand vol
canic eruptions and develop tools
to monitor the eruptions so they
can be predicted," said David Pol
lard, professor of geology and ap
plied earth sciences.
Scientists also hope the results
of the research can be applied to
harnessing geothermal energy as
a source of energy for the future.
The Stanford project, which will
conclude next summer, is part of
a broader study funded by the
National Science Foundation, the
U.S. Geological Survey and the
Department of Energy. Stanford
scientists hope to provide a
geological map that will assist sci
entists in later stages of research
on the mountain.
"We're doing the preliminary
part of a big project," Pollard
added. "Our part is geological
