# Stanford group studies active Alaskan volcano
## 
### Bryan Cooperrider Editorial staff 
No phone, no electricity, no
radio — the brisk Alaskan wind
was the only music for a group
of Stanford professors and grad
uate students studying a volcano
in a remote area of Alaska last
summer.
The four members of the ex
pedition made two plane flights,
one bus ride on a dirt road and
a 10-mile hike to reach the object
of their study — Mount Katmai,
a 5,000-foot peak on Alaska's
southern coast.
"Most people go to fish for sal
mon or look at the bears," said
Peter Wallmann, a geology grad
uate student who participated in
the study.
But for the Stanford research
team and others investigating the
volcano, the mountain may hold
some answers to questions which
have long plagued geologists. For
example, by understanding how

molten rock flows underground,
scientists hope to develop methods
to predict volcanic eruptions.
"Our goal is to understand vol
canic eruptions and develop tools
to monitor the eruptions so they
can be predicted," said David Pol
lard, professor of geology and ap
plied earth sciences.
Scientists also hope the results
of the research can be applied to
harnessing geothermal energy as
a source of energy for the future.
The Stanford project, which will
conclude next summer, is part of
a broader study funded by the
National Science Foundation, the
U.S. Geological Survey and the
Department of Energy. Stanford
scientists hope to provide a
geological map that will assist sci
entists in later stages of research
on the mountain.
"We're doing the preliminary
part of a big project," Pollard
added. "Our part is geological

The mapping will provide infor
mation about the best places to
conduct experimental drilling.
Drilling will help to verify hypoth
eses formulated by the Stanford
team and generate a picture of
the insides of the volcano.
Although Stanford's imyor con
tribution to the project will be
concluded next summer, Stanford
will be involved until the end,

over two summers of mapping.
The project may continue for the
next five years, according to Pol

funds.
A 1912 eruption of Mount Kat
mai has been cited as one of the
largest of this century, 50 times
more powerful than the explosion
of Mount St. Helens, yet only a
single passing ship witnessed the
tremendous explosion.
The Katmai eruption was
unique because "deposits from the

eruption are still visible on the
surface," Pollard said. "That's one
of the attractive things (about
Katmai)."
Accompanying Pollard and Wal
lmann were Geology Prof. Gail
Mahood and geology graduate stu
dent Jake Lowenstern.
Very little equipment was
needed for this expedition — only
"a good set of aerial photos, a
compass, strong backs and a lot
of weather gear," Pollard said.
Although topographic maps al
ready exist, the Stanford team is
trying to generate a more detailed
map of the fracture zones in the
area of the volcano.
"We're not just looking at where
things are, but what they are,"
Wallmann explained.
Most of the lava in this region
of Alaska is very fluid, but at
Katmai the lava was unusually
viscous, Pollard said. "Most of
(the lava) was thrown out as ash."
The valley floor, buried several
hundred meters deep in volcanic
ash and pocketed with thousands
of steaming vents, called
fumaroles, was dubbed the Valley
of 10,000 Smokes by the first

visitor in 1916. Because of the
steaming vents, the valley was
once believed to be the center of
the volcanic activity.
The vents are not nearly of the
same magnitude today as they
were in 1916. "Valley of the Three
Wisps" would be a more appro
priate name, Wallmann said.
The area surrounding Mount
Katmai is very desolate, but "it

was very lush before (the erup
tion)," Pollard said.
Because the top of Katmai col
lapsed after the eruption, scien
tists assumed that the mountain
was the place where the lava
spewed from the earth. By map
ping the thickness of the ash
debris, however, researchers pin
pointed the place where lava
exited the ground at the head of
the Valley of 10,000 Smokes.
Although Katmai collapsed, new
studies of the fracture lines
caused by the movement of molten
rock have led Pollard to theorize
that the lava may have come from
nearby Mount Trident and that
Katmai collapsed because its
magma chamber emptied in order
to fill the chamber in Trident.
Thus, Pollard concluded, Trident
was the source of lava for the
1912 eruption.
The researchers encountered
few problems. "The major im
pedements are the weather and
the remoteness," Pollard said.
"The Alaskan winds change on an
hourly basis."
Wind speeds reach 90 mph, and
the dust blasts they generate
make research progress difficult.

in a remote area of Alaska last
summer.
The four members of the ex
pedition made two plane flights,
one bus ride on a dirt road and
a 10-mile hike to reach the object
of their study — Mount Katmai,
a 5,000-foot peak on Alaska's
southern coast.
"Most people go to fish for sal
mon or look at the bears," said
Peter Wallmann, a geology grad
uate student who participated in
the study.
But for the Stanford research
team and others investigating the
volcano, the mountain may hold
some answers to questions which
have long plagued geologists. For
example, by understanding how

molten rock flows underground,
scientists hope to develop methods
to predict volcanic eruptions.
"Our goal is to understand vol
canic eruptions and develop tools
to monitor the eruptions so they
can be predicted," said David Pol
lard, professor of geology and ap
plied earth sciences.
Scientists also hope the results
of the research can be applied to
harnessing geothermal energy as
a source of energy for the future.
The Stanford project, which will
conclude next summer, is part of
a broader study funded by the
National Science Foundation, the
U.S. Geological Survey and the
Department of Energy. Stanford
scientists hope to provide a
geological map that will assist sci
entists in later stages of research
on the mountain.
"We're doing the preliminary
part of a big project," Pollard
added. "Our part is geological

The mapping will provide infor

Drilling will help to verify hypoth

the insides of the volcano.

A 1912 eruption of Mount Kat
mai has been cited as one of the
largest of this century, 50 times
more powerful than the explosion
of Mount St. Helens, yet only a
single passing ship witnessed the
tremendous explosion.
The Katmai eruption was
unique because "deposits from the

eruption are still visible on the
surface," Pollard said. "That's one
of the attractive things (about
Katmai)."
Accompanying Pollard and Wal
lmann were Geology Prof. Gail
Mahood and geology graduate stu
dent Jake Lowenstern.
Very little equipment was
needed for this expedition — only
"a good set of aerial photos, a
compass, strong backs and a lot
of weather gear," Pollard said.
Although topographic maps al
ready exist, the Stanford team is
trying to generate a more detailed
map of the fracture zones in the
area of the volcano.
"We're not just looking at where
things are, but what they are,"
Wallmann explained.
Most of the lava in this region
of Alaska is very fluid, but at
Katmai the lava was unusually
viscous, Pollard said. "Most of
(the lava) was thrown out as ash."
The valley floor, buried several
hundred meters deep in volcanic
ash and pocketed with thousands
of steaming vents, called
fumaroles, was dubbed the Valley
of 10,000 Smokes by the first

visitor in 1916. Because of the
steaming vents, the valley was
once believed to be the center of
the volcanic activity.
The vents are not nearly of the
same magnitude today as they
were in 1916. "Valley of the Three
Wisps" would be a more appro
priate name, Wallmann said.
The area surrounding Mount
Katmai is very desolate, but "it

was very lush before (the erup
tion)," Pollard said.
Because the top of Katmai col
lapsed after the eruption, scien
tists assumed that the mountain
was the place where the lava
spewed from the earth. By map
ping the thickness of the ash
debris, however, researchers pin
pointed the place where lava
exited the ground at the head of
the Valley of 10,000 Smokes.
Although Katmai collapsed, new
studies of the fracture lines
caused by the movement of molten
rock have led Pollard to theorize
that the lava may have come from
nearby Mount Trident and that
Katmai collapsed because its
magma chamber emptied in order
to fill the chamber in Trident.
Thus, Pollard concluded, Trident
was the source of lava for the
1912 eruption.
The researchers encountered
few problems. "The major im
pedements are the weather and
the remoteness," Pollard said.
"The Alaskan winds change on an
hourly basis."
Wind speeds reach 90 mph, and
the dust blasts they generate
make research progress difficult.

No phone, no electricity, no
radio — the brisk Alaskan wind
was the only music for a group
of Stanford professors and grad
uate students studying a volcano
