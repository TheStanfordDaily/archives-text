VENUS AT GUNPOINT
Today marks the fifth year in a row since the Unilateral Declaration of Independence was an
nounced for the occupied northern part of our country, Cyprus - the birthplace of Venus.
The northern part was taken over by Turkey in the summer of 1974 on the pretext of offering
protection to the Turkish minority on the Island (18%). Turkey announced at the time that the
invasion was temporary until the constitutional order on the Island was restored, yet fourteen
years have passed and Turkey still has thirty thousand troops permanently stationed on the
occupied part. It has also constructed a large submarine base, the biggest military airfield In
the Middle East and scores of military airports and heliports.
On the 15th of November 1983, that illegally occupied part of Cyprus proclai

adamantly refuse to do so on the grounds that such Â«n act only facilitates the tran-
Federal Republic of Cyprus solution, that Is the agreed upon framework by both
for the Island.
What is purposely forgotten and omitted by Turkey and the Turkish-Cypriots, are the immediate
consequences of the Turkish invasion back In 1974, namely the expulsion of 1/3 of the people
of Cyprus from their homes (200,000), thus making them refugees in their own country. By
locking up the territorial conquests of 1974 in the framework of a Federal solution covered with
the mantle of the UDI, It is ensured that no solution will ever be found for the Cyprus Problem.
For the first time in years, the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus have begun talking
to each other in direct negotiations that aspire to bring a "just and lasting settlement" to the
Cyprus Problem.
Despite the smiling faces and warm handshakes and the other public relations stunts by the
two community leaders, everybody knows and realizes that ago-old and, thus, fossilized dif
ferences remain to be resolved. The de facto partition of the Republic of Cyprus via the men
tioned UDI that we are condemning today will only ensure that the road to a solution will be
filled with mines. Future historians could be eventually referring to the UDI as the "coup de
grace of any realistic chance of Cyprus ever bringing Its citizens together in one communal
state with unitary international representation.
Nobody likes to negotiate his future and that of his chMdren at... gunpoint! *
