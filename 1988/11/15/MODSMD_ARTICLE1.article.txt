# 5 'Honkie' stickers confound students
## 
### Brad Hayward Staff writer 
At least five bumper-style stick
ers urging retaliation for recent
racial incidents have appeared on
campus buildings recently, creat
ing confusion among students
about the stickers' origin.
The white stickers read in black
print, "Avenge Ujamaa/Smash the
Honkie Oppressors." The name
of Ujamaa House, the black theme
residence on campus, is mis
spelled. The source of the stickers
remains unknown.
Senior Kristin Barendsen said
she first saw one of the stickers
Nov. 4 on an outside door of the
Graduate School of Business. The
next morning Barendsen, a white
student, saw that stickers had
been posted on the front doors of
the Bookstore and Post Office.
"It angered me," Barendsen
said, adding that the stickers
looked like they may have been
mass-produced and possibly laser
printed.
Louis Jackson, secretary of the
Black Student Union, said that
the stickers were also posted at
Ujamaa and the Black House
about two weeks ago.
Jackson said the stickers on
Ujamaa and the Black House were
removed soon after they were dis
covered. The stickers on the post
office and Business School were
left up for several days but were
removed yesterday.
In a letter to The Daily,
Barendsen said the stickers imply
"violence and hatred" and "are a
deliberate effort to stir up anger
in Stanford's black community
against our white community."
BSU leaders and Ujamaa resi
dence staff said they did not know
who posted the stickers, and some
did not know about the stickers
at all.
