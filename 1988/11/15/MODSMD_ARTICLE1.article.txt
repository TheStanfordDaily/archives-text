# 5 'Honkie' stickers confound students
## 
### Brad Hayward Staff writer 
At least five bumper-style stick
ers urging retaliation for recent
racial incidents have appeared on
campus buildings recently, creat
ing confusion among students
about the stickers' origin.
The white stickers read in black
print, "Avenge Ujamaa/Smash the
Honkie Oppressors." The name
of Ujamaa House, the black theme
residence on campus, is mis
spelled. The source of the stickers
remains unknown.
Senior Kristin Barendsen said
she first saw one of the stickers
Nov. 4 on an outside door of the
Graduate School of Business. The
next morning Barendsen, a white
student, saw that stickers had
been posted on the front doors of
the Bookstore and Post Office.
"It angered me," Barendsen
said, adding that the stickers
looked like they may have been
mass-produced and possibly laser
printed.
Louis Jackson, secretary of the
Black Student Union, said that
the stickers were also posted at
Ujamaa and the Black House
about two weeks ago.
Jackson said the stickers on
Ujamaa and the Black House were
removed soon after they were dis
covered. The stickers on the post
office and Business School were
left up for several days but were
removed yesterday.
In a letter to The Daily,
Barendsen said the stickers imply
"violence and hatred" and "are a
deliberate effort to stir up anger
in Stanford's black community
against our white community."
BSU leaders and Ujamaa resi
dence staff said they did not know
who posted the stickers, and some
did not know about the stickers
at all.
Ujamaa resident assistants Kim
Coleman and Rachel Wiesen both
said they had not seen any of the
stickers, though Wiesen said she
had heard about them.
"The whole thing is questiona
ble," Wiesen said. "Ujamaa is
spelled wrong, and 'honkie' is not
vernacular that the black commu
nity uses anymore."
Jackson called the stickers
"bizarre" and "idiotic" and said
there is some suspicion in the
Stanford black community that
somebody off-campus is responsi
ble.
BSU Chair Mary Dillard said
she doubts that anyone in the
black community at Stanford is
responsible for the stickers. "I
think people are looking toward
the BSU as a vehicle for making
changes that need to be made,
and we're not the kind of people

who run around talking about,
'avenge' this and 'revenge' that."
Dillard added that she was dis
turbed by the stickers because
"someone is trying to implicate
the black community in some
thing we aren't involved in. People
who don't really know what we're
about are putting words in our
mouths."
When The Daily contacted Post
Office Superintendent Kenneth
Duke yesterday, he said he "was
not aware" of the sticker and that
he would remove it immediately.
By yesterday afternoon, the
sticker had been removed from
the Post Office.
Barb Taddeo, building manager
at the Business School, said she
had tried to remove the sticker
on the Business School but was
unable to do more than scratch
part of it away. Soon after The
Daily contacted her yesterday, the
sticker was removed.
