Nearly 20 Stanford students attended a
fall MEChA statewide conference where
resolutions calling for increased funding
for education, the installment of a college
ethnic studies requirement and harsher
punishment for racial offenses were passed
over the weekend.
Held at Cal-State University at Los An
geles, the biannual conference attracted
nearly 1,000 students from 90 campuses
throughout the state, the largest turnout
for a conference in the history of MEChA,
said Stanford conference delegate Alejandro
Sweet.
The delegates discussed different issues
concerning the Chicano community, rang
ing from education to labor support for
farm workers to political empowerment.
Freshmen comprised over half of the

Stanford delegation to the conference. Gina
Hernandez, co-chair of MEChA, attributed
the high level of involvement on the part
of the freshmen to worsening conditions
in predominantly Chicano high schools.
According to Hernandez, cutbacks in
funding as well as racism on and off cam
puses have spurred an "eagerness among
young people to get involved."
MEChA, which stands for Movimiento
Estudiantil Chicano de AztMn (in English,
the Chicano Student Movement of Aztl6n),
campaigns for justice, equality and self
determination for Chicanos. Aztl&n is the
original name of the Mexican territory now
comprising today's southwestern states.
In commemoration of MEChA's 20th an
niversary, conference delegates made plans
to hold a one-day student strike in April
along with a lobby day in Sacramento to
call attention to their demands.
In addition, next April marks the 20th

anniversary of the Third World strikes and
the high school blowouts. In the spring of
1969, 30,000 Chicano students from East
Los Angeles walked out of school to protest
overcrowding, 50 percent drop-out rates
and lack of teachers and materials.

The blowouts of the late '60s gave "im
petus to the whole movement," said Chris
Gonzalez Clark, program director for the
Chicano Fellows program. He added that
"a lot of these conditions still exist now
and may even be worse."
Hernandez contrasted the overcrowding
of barrio classrooms where students are
forced to sit on the floor or in the hall
with the conditions in neighboring Beverly
Hills schools where there is "a microscope
for every student."
But she said the protests of the '60s had
"tremendous significance in raising the
consciousness" of the nation and "brought
enough attention to the campuses to get
university administrations to hire Chicano
professors and admit Chicano students."
Stanford's conference delegation received
some financial backing from El Centro
Chicano.
