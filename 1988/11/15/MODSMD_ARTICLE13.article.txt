# Supreme Court rules for wives' rights to abortion
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme
Court yesterday refused to give hus
bands the legal power to prevent their
wives from having abortions.
The justices, without comment, let
stand an Indiana Supreme Court deci
sion that a husband has no right to
interfere with his wife's constitutional
right to abort her pregnancy.
The state court's ruling last July was
based directly on past rulings by the
nation's highest court.
Erin Conn of Elkhart, Ind., went to
court early last summer in an attempt
to prevent his estranged wife, Jennifer,
from having an abortion. She was about
six weeks pregnant at the time.
A state trial judge issued a temporary
order barring Mrs. Conn from having
the operation performed, but a state
appeals court threw out that order.

The Indiana Supreme Court, acting
on Conn's subsequent appeal, then
adopted the appeals court ruling as its
own.
The state courts said Conn's attempt
to block his wife's abortion was
prohibited by prior Supreme Court
rulings dating back to 1973, when a
landmark decision by the justices
legalized abortion.
In 1976, the court struck down a Mis
souri law requiring spousal consent
before a woman could obtain an abortion
during the first 12 weeks of her preg
nancy.
After the state Supreme Court ruling,
Conn sought emergency help from Chief
Justice William Rehnquist and Justice
John Stevens. Both denied his request,
and the injunction prohibiting Mrs.
Conn's abortion was lifted last July 22.
