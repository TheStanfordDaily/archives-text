SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador
(AP) — Latin American democra
cies have been too permissive of
dictatorships in their midst and
should vigorously promote consti
tutional rule, Secretary of State
George Shultz said yesterday.
"The time is right for a new
diplomacy — a diplomacy based
on democratic solidarity and on
the aggressive advocacy of democ
racy by democratic states," he told
a meeting of Organization of
American States foreign minis
ters.
On what is expected to be the
last of his many trips to Latin
America during six years in office,
Shultz challenged the democracies
to "go out on a limb to pressure
non-democratic neighbors to open
up. We need to confront these
states with a diplomacy by democ
racies, for democracy."
Shultz said the OAS had not
led the struggle for democracy
even though the organization is

based on democratic principles.
The remarks appeared to reflect
Shultz's frustration over the lack
of hemispheric backing for a
stronger stand against Nicara
gua's leftist Sandinista govern
ment.
Reagan administration support
for Nicaraguan rebels, known as
Contras, has been given little ap
proval and sometimes has created
hostility.
The secretary made only a pass
ing reference to Nicaragua, assert
ing that the Sandinista govern
ment has not fulfilled a 1979
pledge to the OAS to establish a
democratic system. The leftist
rebels overthrew the pro-U.S. gov
ernment of the late President
Anastasio Somoza in July 1979.
On the plane from Washington,
Shultz said Paraguay and Cuba
also have have not joined a trend
toward democratic rule that
began nine years ago and now
encompasses about 90 percent of

the hemisphere's people.
In his remarks to reporters, he
offered no specific suggestions
about what the OAS might do to
promote democracy in Nicaragua,
but said it should consider ways
in which "Nicaragua would feel a
sense of isolation."
He said Nicaragua has become
an economic "basket case" but
continues to be a threat to its
neighbors because of its large
army and continued military sup
port from the Soviet Union.
Shultz said the Reagan admin
istration has differences with
President Oscar Arias of Costa
Rica, but he commended Arias for
"forthright" comments on the lack
of progress toward democracy in
Nicaragua.
"As we challenge others to
adopt democracy, we need to hold
them to their promises and com
mitments. No one is fooled by
empty promises," he declared.
