Transport dept. orders drug: tests
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Transportation
Department yesterday ordered a wide range of
drug testing, including random checks, for more
than 4 million transportation workers from air
line pilots and flight attendants to truckers and
railroaders.
Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said the
transportation industries are no more immune
from drug abuse than other parts of society,
listing a series of accidents and other indicators
he said shows narcotics to be a problem among
truck and bus drivers, commercial pilots and
railroad workers.
"The American people demand and expect a
drug-free transportation system. These new rules
will take us as far as practically possible toward
that goal," Burnley said at a news conference.
He acknowledged the tests, which take effect
in a year, likely will be challenged in the courts.
The Supreme Court has before it two separate
drug-testing cases, including one involving post
accident testing of railroad workers, that are ex
pected to be decided next year.
After Burnley's announcement, the head of the

40,000-member Air Line Pilots Association vowed
to go to Congress and to the federal courts to
overturn the requirement for random testing.
"Random testing is a counter-productive, shot
gun strategy that is at the same time an unwar
ranted invasion of privacy and of no significant
value in the battle against drug abuse," said
ALPA President Henry Duffy.
