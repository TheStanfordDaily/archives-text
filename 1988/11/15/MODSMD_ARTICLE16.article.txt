# PLO proclaims homeland
## Parliament leaders implicitly recognize Israel 
### 
ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) - The
PLO*B parliament yesterday
proclaimed an independent Pales
tinian homeland in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip with
Jerusalem as its capital, and ex
tended an olive branch by im
plicitly recognizing Israel.
PLO chairman Yasser Arafat
read the declaration of the inde
pendent state early yesterday
morning to a chamber filled with
delegates to the 450-member
Palestine National Council, Arab
dignitaries and observers, who
broke into long applause and loud
cheers.
Wearing the traditional black
and-white checked headdress,
Arafat read his speech in Arabic
in a low, slow, solemn voice.
"The Palestinian National
Council hereby declares the es
tablishment of a Palestinian state
with Jerusalem as its capital,
which will be for all Palestinians
wherever they are," he said.
The PLO leader declared the
new Palestinian state would be
government by "a democratic, par
liamentary system based on free
dom of opinion, multiple parties,
freedom of worship and equality
between men and women."
In Washington yesterday, Pres
ident Reagan said implicit PLO
recognition of Israel "would be
some progress," but added:

"There are other problems that
remain to be solved."
Israel rejected results of the Al
giers meeting in advance.
"We will not negotiate with the
PLO," said Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir. "It's not a prob
lem of definition and formulations
of various positions. We'll not ne
gotiate with them because they're
opposed to peace with Israel."
Arafat and other PLO leaders
consider the independence decla
ration a historic step toward crea
tion of an independent state in
the West Bank and Gaza. The
council meeting is called the "In
tefadeh" session after the 11-
month-old uprising among the 1.5
million Palestinians of the occu
pied lands.
Israel captured the Gaza Strip
from Egypt and the West Bank
from Jordan in the 1967 Middle
East war.
The Arab League formed the
council in 1964, but it has as
sumed the role of PLO legislature.
When Arafat entered the circu
lar wood-paneled conference hall
with his entourage of aides and
bodyguards, the delegates and ob
servers began chanting the new
slogan launched earlier in the day
by George Habash, the chief op
ponent of Arafat's moves to
moderation.
After reading the declaration,

Arafat directed a band to play the
Palestinian national anthem,
"Balida" (My Country). The four
colored Palestinian flag was raised
by two guerrillas in battle fatigues
behind the podium where Arafat
spoke.
Late last night, the council en
dorsed a new political strategy im
plicitly recognizing the state of
Israel and renouncing terrorism.
The approval of the strategy
marked a major victory for
Arafat's campaign for a more
moderate policy that would meet
some of Washington's conditions
for dealing with the PLO, at
tempting to build on the uprising
in the occupied territories.
The council endorsed the "po
litical declaration," with 253 of
its members voting for it, 46
voting against and 10 abstaining,
reported Assaad Abdel-Rahman, a
council member from Jordan.
Some other members of the
450-seat council were absent be
cause the voting session was
called at short notice, immediately
after the council's political com
mittee completed drafting the dec
laration.
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip
shot off firecrackers, flew balloons
and raised the outlawed Palestin
ian flag to celebrate the declara
tion.
