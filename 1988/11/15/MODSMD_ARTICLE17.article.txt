## Says federal budget deficit is a matter of 'great urgency'

GULF STREAM, Fla. (AP) -
President-elect George Bush, seeking to
calm skittish financial markets, yester
day called the federal budget deficit a
matter of "great urgency" that he in
tends to tackle quickly in the new ad
ministration.
Bush also said he was fully committed
to the Reagan administration's policy
of coordinated actions with other major
countries to stabilize the value of the
dollar on foreign currency markets.
The vacationing president-elect,
talking to reporters on a sunswept
Florida beach, added his voice to a
chorus of Reagan administration and
Bush aides trying to reassure financial
markets after a huge sell-off last week.
The big drop was blamed on investor
concerns over Bush's ability to handle
the economic challenges facing the na
tion.
The words of assurance apparently
had some effect. The Dow Jones indus

trial average of 30 stocks, which had
lost almost 80 points since Bush's elec
tion, including a 47-point drop Friday,
steadied and ended the day down only
1.95 points.
The dollar, which had been battered
last week, recovered some of its losses
as traders reflected on the U.S. state
ments pledging further cooperation to
stabilize the greenback.
Bush noted the dollar's rally when
he spoke to reporters.
"The dollar apparently is stronger this
morning and apparently the Tokyo mar
ket is up, so these gyrations happen,"
he said as he stood on the beach in
front of the home of a millionaire friend,
William Farish.
Economic analysts have said the
shaky markets are reflecting worries
about Bush's ability to bring down the
U.S. budget deficit, especially in light
of his tough "read my lips" stance
against tax increases and his repeated

insistence during the campaign that a
"flexible freeze" on spending was all
that was needed to balance the budget.
Bush told reporters he was "con
vinced that the deficit remains a major
problem."
"I will address myself to that early
on in my presidency," he said. "It is a
matter of great urgency."
"I do not want to start acting like I
am president of the United States yet,"
Bush said.
Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller,
who is also co-director of his White
House transition team, emphasized the
deficit as "priority one" in an interview
on the NBC-TV's "Today" show. Fuller
said he had already "had some good
contacts" with House Speaker Jim
Wright on the matter.
Both Fuller and Bush indicated there
would be no major differences in spend
ing priorities between the Bush and
Reagan administrations.
