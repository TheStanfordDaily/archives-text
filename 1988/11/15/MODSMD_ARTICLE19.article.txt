# Sakharov meets with Reagan

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Andrei
Sakharov, the Nobel laureate and
nuclear physicist, said yesterday
that Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev was pursuing demo
cratic reforms through "un
democratic means."
After meeting with President
Reagan, the human rights activist
told a group of American intellec
tuals that Gorbachev may not
have a long-range perspective for
reform.
Suggesting Gorbachev leads by
"improvisation," Sakharov said
"often this is accompanied by
compromises with existing forces
that negate his efforts."
Specifically, in a discussion at
the Woodrow Wilson Institute for
Scholars, the Soviet nuclear
physicist criticized Gorbachev's
consolidation of power, the ab
sence of multiparty and free

market systems as well as restric
tions on meetings and demonstra
tions.
"There is no clear realization
how this system should be
reformed," Sakharov said.
Before leaving the Soviet Union
on his first trip to the West with
Gorbachev's permission, Sak
harov leveled similar criticisms at
the Soviet leader.
Sakharov supports glasnost —
a term for openness that has
marked Gorbachev's 3Vfe years in
power — but is complaining that
the Soviet leader has accumulated
too much power as both president
and Communist party chief.
"His tactic seems to be getting
democratic reforms through un
democratic means," Sakharov
said. "From my point of view, this
is a dangerous action."
On the human rights front.

Sakharov said some dissidents re
mained in psychiatric institutions
along with many more people who
are chronic critics of their em
ployers.
He called the detention system
"one of the most acute abuses"
in the Soviet Union in recent
years.
Earlier, Sakharov discussed the
plight of dissidents with Reagan
at the White House. Reagan said
until the problem was "completely
eliminated" human rights would
remain an irritant in U.S.-Soviet
relations.
"We've had great success,"
Reagan said as he praised Gorba
chev as more cooperative than any
Kremlin leader before him.
But, Reagan said, "We can only
wait and see" if Gorbachev makes
good on a promise to release all
political prisoners.
