# Pro-life activist fends off hecklers
## 
### Laura Jacobson Senior staff writer 
Attempting to address a
raucous and polarized audience in
Annenberg Auditorium last night,
pro-life leader Randall Terry
fended off questions relating to
his anti-abortion stand, but main
tained poise through heckling and
chanting.
Almost 300 people, including
students, Stanford community
members and activists from San
Francisco and Berkeley, turned
out for the hour-long speech,
which began and ended as a verbal
wrestling match between those
who support a woman's right to
an abortion and those who sup
port an unborn child's right to
life.
"My expressed purpose right
now being on this planet is to call
people who believe that abortion
is murder to act like it, and to
reach out to save children who
are scheduled to die, mothers who
are scheduled to be exploited,"
Terry told the charged crowd.
Terry, who has been arrested

25 times in anti-abortion demon
strations, is the outspoken foun
der of Operation Rescue, a na
tional pro-life organization. Ac
cording to Terry, his "ultimate
end" is to make "child-killing il
legal."
Over the last six months Terry,
age 29, has mobilized Operation
Rescue to stage massive sit-ins
that attempt to close the abortion
clinics.
Verbal abuse from the emotion
ally charged crowd prevented
Terry from delivering a complete
speech. "Operation Rescue —
that's a lie, you don't care if
women die," chanted the pro
choice activists in response to Ter
ry's controversial stand.
Terry ignored the chants. And,
when he could speak, Terry spent
much time responding to pointed
questions from impassioned pro
choice audience members.
Arguing for legislation that
denies a woman the option of
choosing to have an abortion,
Terry said that when a woman

has an abortion "that child is
being denied its most fundamental
civil right and that is its right to
be alive."
He denied allegations from one
pro-choicer that Operation Rescue
has adopted violent demonstration
tactics, such as bombing abortion
clinics and violating the civil
rights of women who try to enter
the clinics.
becpite his bout with the au
dience, Terry began and ended the
event with a prayer. The heckling
drowned out both prayers. Rather
than quell the audience, Terry's
references to Jesus Christ further

aggravated pro-choicers and dis
turbed some pro-life supporters.
Although Terry said that the
pro-life movement does not expect
its supporters to be Christians or
believe in Jesus Christ, he said
"I'm here to call you to repent."
When one pro-choicer asked
Terry what he considered an ap
propriate punishment for women
who have abortions, he responded,
"Until Roe v. Wade is overturned,
then women, I believe, should be
considered the second victim —
they have been lied to and ex
ploited."
In 1973, the Supreme Court
ruled in Roe v. Wade to legalize
abortion.
Terry then suggested that after
abortion has been made illegal
women who have been "exploited"

would be given "remuneration" or
compensation money.
Dissatisfied with this response,
pro-choice activists resumed
chanting and several descended to
the stage, surrounding Terry.
Terry, who was joined by body
guards, remained calm. He
thanked the protestors, claiming
that their anger helpes to "gal
vanize" the pro-life movement.
When one audience member
asked Terry if he would endorse
abortions if a "maniac" raped a
14-year-old girl and got her preg
nant, Terry responded, "An abor
tion will not undo a rape and you
don't kill children for the crimes
of their fathers."
This response elicited applause
from the pro-life contingent.
