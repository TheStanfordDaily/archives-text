## The 						right to choose 
### 
Abortions should not be
outlawed because they
are a woman's right

NOW IS a crucial time for
both proponents and oppo
nents of legalized abortion.
By electing a president who is
against legalized abortion, the
majority of voting Americans have
signalled that they want a change
in the status quo.
And since President-elect George
Bush will most likely appoint
several U.S. Supreme Court jus
tices, the national abortion policy
could change very soon.
In fact, The New York Times
reported last week that the justices
of the Supreme Court are already
reviewing abortion cases in hopes
of finding one that they can use
to overturn the 1973 U.S. Supreme
Court decision Roe v. Wade, which
states that women should have the
right to legally terminate their
pregnancies.
A change in this nation's abor
tion policy would have disastrous
consequences.
The choice of whether to abort
a pregnancy or not is a very per
sonal, moral decision. In the area
of public policy, it stands by itself.
Because of the personal nature
of this decision, it is not the place
of the government to make that
choice for individuals within the
state.

If the Supreme Court were to
make abortion illegal, it would dis
criminate against women. The de
cision would apply only to women
and it would reach into women's
bodies whereas all other laws stop
at skin level.
Women should have the right to
decide what happens to their
bodies. They should not be seen as
vessels of procreation, restricted by
the blind justice of a male
dominated society.
Beyond the personal rights of
women, comes the dangerous med
ical implications of outlawing abor
tions.
Even if abortions were illegal,
some women would still seek them.
Performed under less sanitary and
professional conditions, these abor
tions would pose a greater threat
to the health of mothers. Desperate
women might even resort to self
performed abortions. These basic
health issues are reason enough to
support legalized abortion.
Those who oppose abortion, such
as members of Operation Rescue,
an anti-abortionist group, recog
nize the value of life. But anti
abortionists cannot deny women
their right to choose. They cannot
employ violent, threatening tactics
to prove their point â€” no matter
how strong their convictions might
be.
The value of life can very well
be a starting point for discussing
abortion. But, when that bare
boned absolute is applied to the
context of abortion, it leaves too
many questions unresolved.
