## Racist threats against whites should not be ignored 
### 
WHILE OPENING a main door
of the Business School last
Friday, I saw a sticker which
read, "AVENGE UJAMAA/SMASH
THE HONKIE OPPRESSORS." The
sticker appeared laser-printed and
mass-produced. Upset, I informed The
Daily about it immediately. The staff
member I spoke to said, "That's bad.
But if it's only one sticker, we won't
write an article about it."
The next morning, I saw two identi
cal stickers, on the front doors of the
Post Office and the Bookstore. I again
notified The Daily. Still, they did not

write an article.
If one flier depicting a black Beetho
ven and one flier reading "Niggers"
make national news, shouldn't three
stickers implying violence and hatred
toward white people make local news?
These stickers, which probably number
a lot more than three, are a deliberate
effort to stir up anger in Stanford's
black community against our white
community. Yet The Daily chooses to
run articles about only one side of this
issue — whites' racism toward blacks.
If students are to understand the
reality of the situation, they must be

allowed to see every side.
By overlooking this sticker after days
of headlines about the Ujamaa fliers,
The Daily implies that racism against
blacks is considerably worse than
racism against whites — worse than
racism that urges to "avenge" and
"smash."
America's history contains appalling
crimes against blacks, but we cannot
keep talking about the past as if
today's whites are responsible for it.
We have to move on now and start
over. We have to start taking racist
events at face value, and treat them

with equal gravity.
Now here's a funny thought: what if
a black person wrote "Niggers" on the
Ujamaa flier? What if a white person
produced the anti-white bumper stick
ers? Maybe some thrive on the atmos
phere of racial unrest they can create
with these offenses.
The fact is, we just don't know who
to blame. So why not stop this spread
of hatred that is making so many
Stanford students uncomfortable with
students of another skin color?
