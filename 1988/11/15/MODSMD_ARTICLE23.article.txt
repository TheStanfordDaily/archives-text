# Students should still support and thank University workers
## 
### 
We are thankful that the United
Stanford Workers were able to achieve
a decent contract for the Stanford
workers. After sessions late into Sun
day night, the administration and un
ion officials reached an agreement that
was overwhelmingly ratified at the
USW general membership meeting
Monday afternoon.
Administration proposals that threat
ened the very survival of the union
were taken off the table as late as
Sunday night. While the workers were
not able to gain all that they had
hoped, they were able to achieve slight
improvements in the affirmative action
plan, pension rates and wages.
The workers were able to achieve a
fair contract through their commitment
and strength. It appears to us that the
administration waited so long to make
the movement necessary to achieve a
settlement because they were watching
to see whether the USW really had the

support of its membership and
whether the union could really strike.
After a demonstration of over 700 i
workers and actions in workplaces all
over campus, it was clear. The mem
bers supported USW. They would do
whatever they had to in order to gain
a just contract. And if the administra
tion did not improve its proposals,
there would be a strike. Only then did
the administration's proposals start
coming off the table.
We also hope that the display of
student support contributed to avoiding
a strike over an unjust contract offer.
Students from the Black Student Un
ion, MEChA, the Asian American Stu
dent Association, the Women's Center,
the ASSU Senate and the Council of
Presidents combined efforts with other
individuals in the Student Labor Sup
port Coalition.
We held over 15 dorm presentations,
published one pamphlet and two flyers
informing students about the progress
of negotiations, circulated a petition
calling for a campus-wide forum on the
negotiations and held a benefit party
for the Stanford workers.
The Students of Color Coalition in
cluded a demand in their "Mandate for

Change" that discrimination against
workers end and invited a black
worker to speak at their demonstration
(he received a tremendous response
from the audience when introduced).
And the students who organized the
Jesse Jackson event brought USW rep
resentatives to sit on stage with Jack
son.
As much as we could, we let the
administration know that students care
about the treatment of workers on this
campus and that students would act to
make sure that the workers received a
just contract. The need for students
to support USW will continue. A Bay
Area civil rights organization will be
holding public hearings on campus
regarding racial discrimination in the
workplace at Stanford. The condition
of Latino workers, paid minimum wage
and forced to live in a labor camp on
Stanford land, demands attention and
suport. We will work alongside USW
on these issues, continuing the fight
for the fair treatment of all Stanford
workers.
A* students we are often so caught
up in our studying and partying that
we never pause to thank those people
who let us live the lives we do. We

owe much gratitude to the Stanford
workers who keep this university run
ning. Without their work, our lives at
Stanford would never run so smoothly.
We would like to thank the Stanford
workers for their incredible hard work
and service, letting them know that
the endless hours spent in our dorms,
kitchens and across the campus do not
go unnoticed. Without the Stanford
workers, this university would never be
what it is today. Thank you, Stanford
workers, and congratulations on your
new contract. You have our support
now and in the future.
