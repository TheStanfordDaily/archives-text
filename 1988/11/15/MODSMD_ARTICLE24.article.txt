I would like to bring it to your at
tention that as a foreign graduate stu
dent, I must pay tax on my stipend to
the U.S. government and yet I do not
have any say in how this money is
spent, i.e. I do not get the opportunity
to vote in U.S. elections. Whatever
happened to the principle of "no taxa
tion without representation?"
