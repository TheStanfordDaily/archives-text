# Ted Lieu
## Pro-lifers inconsistent? 
### 
EXACTLY ONE week ago, I entered
the voting booth and punched in
the little hole signifying my sup
port for Vice President George Bush and
Senator Dan Quayle. Something inside
me gnawed at that decision. I kept on
reading the rest of the ballot, trying to
suppress the "gut feeling" that a vote
for George Bush was not a vote for a
better America. The feeling wouldn't go
away. So I left the booth, went to the
registration person, and said, "I made a
mistake. Can I have a new ballot?"
I received a new ballot, went back inside
the booth, and walked out supporting
neither George Bush nor Massachusetts
Governor Michael Dukakis. The time was
9:45 in the morning, before I had talked
to anyone. Little did I know the incredible
amount of criticism, some justified, some
not, that I was about to encounter for
writing an article supporting the rights
of the unborn child.
Perhaps I was misleading in my last
column (Nov. 8) when I only gave two
choices — Bush and Dukakis — and said,
"My conscience will not permit me to
vote for the latter."
Logically, the conclusion would be that
I vote for Bush. But inside the voting
booth that morning, I could not carry
out my own conclusion. Why? Because
the only reason I supported Bush was
because he claims to be pro-life. My con
science, however, told me that was not
the case.
George Bush is not pro-life when he
supports the death penalty. He is not
pro-life when he allows destruction of

our environment. He is not pro-life when
he supports relaxed gun control. In short,
he's pro-life only when it suits his con
venience.
Pro-life in this narrow context means
pro-government legislation against abor
tion. But, in the macroscopic sense, pro
life means showing a regard for the
dignity and sacredness of each human
life, regardless of age, nationality or social
standing.
The consistent pro-life ethic pleads for
the poor, the weak, the sick, the op
pressed and the unborn. The inconsistent
pro-life ethic pleads only for the unborn
at the expense of everyone else.
To concentrate on just one narrow view
of what it means to be pro-life is to lose
sight of the big picture; to lose sight of
life's "seamless garment."
Many people fall into the trap of focus
ing so intensely on just one thread that
the needs and rights of others — espe
cially the poor, the oppressed, the sick
— rank extremely low on the agenda of
social concerns.
Many people fall into the trap of be
coming so entrenched in their views —
whether they are pro-life or pro-choice
— that they become very judgmental,
very intolerant and very self-righteous.
This summer I went to a three-day
pro-life conference in Washington, D.C.
I attended one day, became repulsed by
the self-righteous and intolerant atmos
phere and swore I would never go back.
Intolerant people who claim to be pro-life
are guilty of giving the pro-life ethic a
bad name. George Bush gives an air of
intolerance. Mandatory pledge of alle

giance: case and point.
I am pro-life in the macroscopic sense
and proud of it. But I resent having to
associate myself, just because I'm pro-life,
with the inconsistent policies of Bush. I
resent being associated with narrow
context pro-lifers who confuse conviction
with self-righteousness, confuse convic
tion with intolerance and confuse convic
tion with inflexibility.
As I look back upon my last column,
my knowledge of what it means to be
pro-life has grown significantly. I have
come to greatly respect the arguments of
both sides.
The challenge, the tension and the fun
damental question that I think needs to
be discussed among both pro-life and pro
choice people alike is this: "If one believes
the unborn child is a human being in
every sense of the word, does it neces
sarily follow that one has to do everything
in one's power — including using the
legislative process — to try and stop abor
tions?"
To be honest, many of these thoughts
did not enter my head inside the voting
booth. All I felt was my conscience. And
my conscience would not permit me to
vote for George Bush and Dan Quayle.

"My conscience will not permit me to
vote for the latter."
Logically, the conclusion would be that
I vote for Bush. But inside the voting
booth that morning, I could not carry
out my own conclusion. Why? Because
the only reason I supported Bush was
because he claims to be pro-life. My con
science, however, told me that was not
the case.
George Bush is not pro-life when he
supports the death penalty. He is not
pro-life when he allows destruction of

our environment. He is not pro-life when
he supports relaxed gun control. In short,
he's pro-life only when it suits his con
venience.
Pro-life in this narrow context means
pro-government legislation against abor
tion. But, in the macroscopic sense, pro
life means showing a regard for the
dignity and sacredness of each human
life, regardless of age, nationality or social
standing.
The consistent pro-life ethic pleads for
the poor, the weak, the sick, the op
pressed and the unborn. The inconsistent
pro-life ethic pleads only for the unborn
at the expense of everyone else.
To concentrate on just one narrow view
of what it means to be pro-life is to lose
sight of the big picture; to lose sight of
life's "seamless garment."
Many people fall into the trap of focus
ing so intensely on just one thread that
the needs and rights of others — espe
cially the poor, the oppressed, the sick
— rank extremely low on the agenda of
social concerns.
Many people fall into the trap of be
coming so entrenched in their views —
whether they are pro-life or pro-choice
— that they become very judgmental,
very intolerant and very self-righteous.
This summer I went to a three-day
pro-life conference in Washington, D.C.
I attended one day, became repulsed by
the self-righteous and intolerant atmos
phere and swore I would never go back.
Intolerant people who claim to be pro-life
are guilty of giving the pro-life ethic a
bad name. George Bush gives an air of
intolerance. Mandatory pledge of alle

giance: case and point.
I am pro-life in the macroscopic sense
and proud of it. But I resent having to
associate myself, just because I'm pro-life,
with the inconsistent policies of Bush. I
resent being associated with narrow
context pro-lifers who confuse conviction
with self-righteousness, confuse convic
tion with intolerance and confuse convic
tion with inflexibility.
As I look back upon my last column,
my knowledge of what it means to be
pro-life has grown significantly. I have
come to greatly respect the arguments of
both sides.
The challenge, the tension and the fun
damental question that I think needs to
be discussed among both pro-life and pro
choice people alike is this: "If one believes
the unborn child is a human being in
every sense of the word, does it neces
sarily follow that one has to do everything
in one's power — including using the
legislative process — to try and stop abor
tions?"
To be honest, many of these thoughts
did not enter my head inside the voting
booth. All I felt was my conscience. And
my conscience would not permit me to
vote for George Bush and Dan Quayle.
