## Abortion Women must decide if abortion is the right choice for them 
### 
There have been a few letters here
recently exchanging opinions on the
Women's Center involvement in pro
choice activities. One side has called
abortion an Holocaust of babies, and
the other side has categorized pro-life
sentiments as misogynist. Both have
rudely dismissed the real concerns of
people both for and against legal abor
tion.
First, let me tell you that until re
cently my opinions on abortion fell
more into the "pro-life" camp than the
pro-choice" camp. My reasoning was
as follows: a baby is definitely a
human being. We all know that the
development of a fertilized egg to a
baby is a continuous process, with no
sharp lines anywhere saying, "this is
now a human." So, by a sort of slip
pery slope process, I thought one
should consider even a fertilized egg to
be human. Obviously that rules out
abortion, since to kill a human being
is murder.
But my opinions have changed. I

still believe a baby is fully human, but
when I consider a fertilized egg —
that's not a human being. It has no
desires, no thoughts, no emotional
needs, no drive to communicate. It
doesn't do anything a person does, look
like a person or feel anything a person
deos, for it does not have even the
rudiments of a nervous system with
which to do so.
The miracle of development is that a
fertilized egg becomes a person. Is a
blastula a person? I don't think so.
And a gastrula? Now we're getting into
harder territory, at this point the little
ball of cells is starting the differentia
tion of tissues that will become the
nervous system.
Of course, most abortions take place
after the gastrula stage. Only
"morning-after" pills and intra-uterine
devices and such affect embryos that
are so underdeveloped. But as I mem
tioned before, there is no sign appear
ing on the embryo at any particular

stage saying, "I am now a human."
How can you solve the problem? Do
you consider the little thing human
when it has developed to the complex
ity of a tadpole? I'm not being face
tious. Such a decision is impossible to
make using developmental considera
tion. Refusing to make some kind of
judgment, (by calling any embryo from
the fertilized egg onwards human),
leads to the absurd situation where a
single-celled creature may have legal
rights over a person.
In fact, decisions about whether or
not to allow abortion and how to regu
late it, don't often hinge on such con
siderations, but on the gut feelings of
legislators and of their most vocal lob
byists and the appropriate nature of
the family and appropriate ways to
deal with sex.
Yet biological considerations shape
our opinions about abortion. One rea
son the majority of abortions are per
formed within the first three months

or so after conception is that people
don't want to abort a human being.
Pro-life workers know this. This is
why most anti-abortion literature con
centrates very hard on emphasizing the
personhood of the embryo from concep
tion, even from the one-cell stage.
As I see it, you can't appeal to sci
ence to resolve when an embryo be
comes a baby and, given the diversity
of our society, you can't appeal to
mutual gut feeling either.
So I feel, (a gut feeling, of course),
that you have to give the decision to
the one involved who is definitely and
absolutely a person, with physical and
emotional needs, and who will bear the
physical and emotional consequences of
allowing the embryo to become a child,
or of aborting it — the mother.
Let her consult her conscience and
her beliefs. Let her use her judgment.
In practical terms she probably will
make some kind of decision even if she
can't get a legal abortion: the stakes

will just be higher.
In countries where abortion is illegal,
botched abortions are a substantial
cause of death for young women. The
space is too short to talk about other
issues that come into the abortion
debate, like taking the responsibility
for having sex and having control over
your own body or how different people
have tried to define humanness.
What my argument boils down to is:
since concerned people can't agree, give
the decision to the one who is most
concerned of all — the pregnant wom
an.
Pro-lifers have the responsibility to
try and convince her to do what they
believe is right, but the issue of the
personhood of the embryo is not crys
tal clear. We must respect the judg
ment of the mother and continue to
have pro-choice laws.

In countries where abortion is illegal,
botched abortions are a substantial
cause of death for young women. The
space is too short to talk about other
issues that come into the abortion
debate, like taking the responsibility
for having sex and having control over
your own body or how different people
have tried to define humanness.
What my argument boils down to is:
since concerned people can't agree, give
the decision to the one who is most
concerned of all — the pregnant wom
an.
Pro-lifers have the responsibility to
try and convince her to do what they
believe is right, but the issue of the
personhood of the embryo is not crys
tal clear. We must respect the judg
ment of the mother and continue to
have pro-choice laws.

There have been a few letters here
recently exchanging opinions on the
Women's Center involvement in pro
choice activities. One side has called
abortion an Holocaust of babies, and
the other side has categorized pro-life
sentiments as misogynist. Both have
rudely dismissed the real concerns of
people both for and against legal abor
tion.
First, let me tell you that until re
cently my opinions on abortion fell
more into the "pro-life" camp than the
pro-choice" camp. My reasoning was
as follows: a baby is definitely a
human being. We all know that the
development of a fertilized egg to a
baby is a continuous process, with no
sharp lines anywhere saying, "this is
now a human." So, by a sort of slip
pery slope process, I thought one
should consider even a fertilized egg to
be human. Obviously that rules out
abortion, since to kill a human being
is murder.
But my opinions have changed. I

still believe a baby is fully human, but
when I consider a fertilized egg —
that's not a human being. It has no
desires, no thoughts, no emotional
needs, no drive to communicate. It
doesn't do anything a person does, look
like a person or feel anything a person
deos, for it does not have even the
rudiments of a nervous system with
which to do so.
The miracle of development is that a
fertilized egg becomes a person. Is a
blastula a person? I don't think so.
And a gastrula? Now we're getting into
harder territory, at this point the little
ball of cells is starting the differentia
tion of tissues that will become the
nervous system.
Of course, most abortions take place
after the gastrula stage. Only
"morning-after" pills and intra-uterine
devices and such affect embryos that
are so underdeveloped. But as I mem
tioned before, there is no sign appear
ing on the embryo at any particular

stage saying, "I am now a human."
How can you solve the problem? Do
you consider the little thing human
when it has developed to the complex
ity of a tadpole? I'm not being face
tious. Such a decision is impossible to
make using developmental considera
tion. Refusing to make some kind of
judgment, (by calling any embryo from
the fertilized egg onwards human),
leads to the absurd situation where a
single-celled creature may have legal
rights over a person.
In fact, decisions about whether or
not to allow abortion and how to regu
late it, don't often hinge on such con
siderations, but on the gut feelings of
legislators and of their most vocal lob
byists and the appropriate nature of
the family and appropriate ways to
deal with sex.
Yet biological considerations shape
our opinions about abortion. One rea
son the majority of abortions are per
formed within the first three months

or so after conception is that people
don't want to abort a human being.
Pro-life workers know this. This is
why most anti-abortion literature con
centrates very hard on emphasizing the
personhood of the embryo from concep
tion, even from the one-cell stage.
As I see it, you can't appeal to sci
ence to resolve when an embryo be
comes a baby and, given the diversity
of our society, you can't appeal to
mutual gut feeling either.
So I feel, (a gut feeling, of course),
that you have to give the decision to
the one involved who is definitely and
absolutely a person, with physical and
emotional needs, and who will bear the
physical and emotional consequences of
allowing the embryo to become a child,
or of aborting it — the mother.
Let her consult her conscience and
her beliefs. Let her use her judgment.
In practical terms she probably will
make some kind of decision even if she
can't get a legal abortion: the stakes

will just be higher.
