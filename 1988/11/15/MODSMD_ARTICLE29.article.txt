# Responsible society must pass laws to outlaw abortions
## 
### 
As someone with serious misgivings
about abortion (serious enough for me
to risk arrest at the Oct. 29 Operation
Rescue sit-in), I have the unenviable
task of explaining to my freedom
loving friends why I am not pro-choice.
Let me hasten to say that I am not
anti-choice; I believe that individuals
should be free to make their own
choices, but only if those choices do not
violate the rights of others, particularly
the right to life.
Surely even a devout libertarian
would disavow the following pro-choice
statement: "I'm personally opposed to
burglary, but only the individual rob
ber, together with his financial advisor,
can rightfully choose whether or not to
burglarize a house."
Of course, many people believe that
a fetus, unlike a homeowner, is not
fully human, and these people may be
right. It is beyond me, though, how
anyone familiar with the facts of fetal
development can be dogmatic in this

belief.
I fear that such dogmatism is often
the product of wishful thinking; be
cause abortion seems to solve the prob
lem of unwanted pregnancy so neatly,
people want to believe that abortion is
nothing more than the removal of a
uterine cyst.
As long as there is a reasonable
chance, though, that a fetus is a
human being with even the most basic
of all human rights, no responsible
society can countenance abortion on
demand. I hope that our society will
come to view abortion as it now views
slavery, but it is not enough to hope or
to wait for a consensus.
If we had lived in the nineteenth
century, our concern for the economic
well-being of Southern plantation
owners might have led us to help them
find alternatives to slavery. Our con
cern for whites would not, however,
have justified a timid reluctance to
impose our belief that blacks might
also be human beings with the right to
life and liberty.
In our own day, our concern for the
economic, physical and emotional well
being of women should lead us to help
them find alternatives to abortion. We
must not, however, let our respect for

personal autonomy blind us to the fact
that we are quite possibly killing 1.5
million innocent human beings every
year as a result of misguided compas
sion.
