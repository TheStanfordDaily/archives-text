# Pro-choice coalition stages rally before speech
## 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
A group of 70 pro-choice dem
onstrators chanted and waved
verbally-abusive signs outside An
nenberg Auditorium last night to
protest the speaking engagement
of Randall Terry, the controversial
founder of the national pro-life
group Operation Rescue.
As Terry's 7 p.m. scheduled
speaking time neared, the Bay
Area Coalition Against Operation
Rescue formed a human gauntlet
at the top of the stairs leading to
the auditorium's front doors.
Chanting, "Racists, sexists, anti
gays, born-again bigots, go away!"
they hissed and yelled at speech
goers who walked past them and
down the staircase.
The coalition is a broad-based
activist group, according to dem

onstration organizer Marianne
Jensen. No Stanford students are
part of the coalition. However,
junior Ann Marie Bender said a
group of about 25 to 30 Stanford
women came to Annenberg in
solidarity with the coalition,
joining them in organized chants
and sign-waving.
There was no violence and most
of the people scooted through the
crowd, smiling and waving back
at the vocal demonstrators. Most
of the protest group entered An
nenberg to see Terry.
Emotion at the conclusion of
the speech was high. People slowly
filtered out of Annenberg, discuss
ing what they had heard inside.
No confrontations between pro
choice and anti-abortion support
ers occurred at the end of Terry's
speech.
Despite its vocal protests, last

'We are here for
peace We just
want people to come
and make up their
minds.'

night's coalition appearance
stands in marked contrast to an
emotional anti-abortion demon
stration Oct. 29 at a Sunnyvale
abortion clinic . At that demon
stration, five Stanford students
and staff, who are anti
abortionists, were arrested for
trespassing because they were
blocking the entrances of the
clinic.
Anti-abortionists argue that the
fetus is a human being and there

fore abortion is tantamount to
murder. Pro-choice supporters
belive it is the woman's preroga
tive to decide for or against an
abortion.
Stanford Students for Life, an
anti-abortion group, sponsored
Terry's speech. Students for Life
member Janice Keen said the
demonstration was not unusual.
"We expected it," said Keen, a
junior. "We are here for peace. ...
We just want people to come and
make up their minds."
However, Frank Gerhay, a res
ident of the Palo Alto area who
came to hear Terry, reacted nega
tively to the protesters. "I have
never seen such hatred. They are
acting totally ugly against people
they have never seen."
Members of the pro-choice coa
lition appeared at Annenberg
nearly an hour before Terry's

speaking engagement, preparing
pro-choice banners and literature.
A coalition member, identifying
herself as Chila, said the coalition
wants revolt. "We want to fight
all women's oppression."
Another coalition member said
she thought Operation Rescue's
attempt to outlaw abortion
reflects a fascist mentality. "In
fascist states, there is a ban on
abortion."
Stanford police were present at
Annenberg in anticipation of a
stand-off between supporters of
both sides of this fiercely
polarized topic. None of the four
officers questioned said he knew
exactly haw many other officers
were on duty.
One officer was visible during
the pre-speech demonstration and
four remained to patrol the
auditorium after the speech.
