# Pro-choice is the only choice for a free, liberal society
## 
### 
In her Nov. 2 letter Jennifer Bryson
asserted that a pro-choice position on
abortion was a "left wing" political
view. She is wrong. It is a liberal polit
ical view. After a presidential campaign
in which the word "liberal" has been
applied and accepted as a term of
slander some clarification of these
terms is in order.
Liberalism is defined by a belief in
the primacy of liberty, in the right of
individuals to choose how to live their
own lives. This principle is enshrined
in the great phrases of our Declaration
of Independence: "that all men are
created equal; that they are endowed
by their creator with certain in
alienable rights; that among these are
life, liberty and the pursuit of happi
ness."
Anti-choice position can itself be
argued as a liberal position. If one
wants to argue that the fetus is a per
son, then an inalienable right to life
could plausibly be taken to require the
outlawing of abortion. It is only as a
liberal position that anti-choice views
deserve to be considered in American
politics. Let us consider then; should a
fetus be considered a person, and if so,
should abortion be outlawed?

To maintain that the embryo is a
person from conception (the term fetus
does not apply until the eighth week of
gestation) seems clearly to depend on
the religious doctrine that the soul
inhabits the body at conception. If a
law were passed calling an embryo a
person it should be struck down by the
United States Supreme Court as a
violation of the First Amendment
separation of church and state.
Calling a fetus a person also goes
too far. Still, if there were no other
interests involved one would have no
qualms about protecting the fetus or
the embryo. Once we acknowledge any
interest in the life of the fetus the
question becomes one of balancing
competing rights to "life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness."
On the one side are the woman's
interests. On the other are the inter
ests of the would-be person. But this
is not all. There are also at stake the
interests of other would-be persons.
We live in a country where family
planning is a reality for most people.
Substantial numbers of those who
would have abortions rather than have
children now will, if they are forced to
have children now, choose not to con
ceive later, in accordance with their
family plans. In these cases the com
peting interests of the two would-be
persons cancel (unless, again, the fact
of conception is held to be crucial, but
that is a religious idea). The mother's
interest then stands unopposed and
which child to have should be her own
choice.
When the question is whether to
abort a congenitally diseased fetus,
diagnosed through amniocentesis, this
logic would seem incontrovertible. The
healthy child the woman will not have
if she does not abort is deprived of life
just as much as the unhealthy child if

she does abort.
In some cases these family planning
assumptions will not aply. Then there
can be a conflict between the mother's
interests and the interests of the un
born. For guidance here we can look to
other instances where basic rights con
flict.
In our society no born person is ever
forced to give up even a pint of blood
to save the life of another born person.
That is, a right to life is taken to
mean a right to one's own life, but not
at the cost of anyone else's life or
liberty, and for born people this limita
tion on their rights over others is near
absolute.
The opposite principle would be that
stated by Karl Marx: "From each ac
cording to his ability. To each accord
ing to his needs." In a liberal society,
anyone may live according to Marx's
dictum who wants to, but no one is
forced to. To insist that an unborn
would-be person has a right to the full
use of a woman's body for nine
months against her will is to invoke
the communistic principle and reject
the defining liberal values of our soci
ety. Further, the Declaration of Inde
pendence maintains that all men are
created equal. This value is also vio
lated when the unborn are given rights
over the born that far exceed the
rights that born people have over the
born.
If one believes in the values of the
Declaration it seems to me that, even
in the case most favorable to the anti
choice position — the case when family
planning assumptions do not hold —
one must defend a woman's right to
choose abortion. If there is any
coherent way to arrive at the opposite
conclusion, I would like to hear it.
