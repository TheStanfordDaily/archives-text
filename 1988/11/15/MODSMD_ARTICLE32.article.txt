## Fusing philosophy and dance, Diane Frank lives her heritage 
### Jean Chen 
"I count wasted every day that
I do not dance," wrote Friedrich
Nietzsche. For some, however,
dance is not a distraction from
philosophy; it is the philosophy.
Visiting instructor Diane Frank
challenges students this fall to
dance with commitment that
rivals their commitment to other
academics. Frank herself is com
mitted to teaching the demanding
style of Merce Cunningham, a
controversial innovator in modern
dance.
Rejecting the common critique
of Cunningham's dance form as
cold and unfeeling, Frank explains
the endless opportunities for ex
pression, individuality and
cooperation that she finds in it.
She compares the style to mini
malist painting, which reduces ex
pression to the "bare bones" of
form. In her new class at Stan
ford, Dance Heritage, Frank ex
plores a dance form emphasizing
natural beauty. She likens this
beauty to that of a "cat jumping
over a fence."

Unfortunately, most people are
not naturally born with feline
agility and grace.
Frank is prepared to teach it
to her dancers, but she demands
that they try hard. Frank ob
serves that people now "seem to
need permission to work hard."
She gives them that permission,
and more.
Frank begins the class by clap
ping and snapping a soothing
rhythm. As she coaxes the dance
studio to life, nothing betrays the
internal energy of the dancers.
There is only the quietness of the
studio and the determined,
hushed sound of bare feet sliding
in unison across the wooden floor.
When she is ready, Frank dou
bles the tempo and the class grows
intense.
The level of concentration the
dancers attain shows a new trend
in the dance department. Frank
and her students have doubled the
tempo and brought new serious
ness to Stanford's dance program.
Students in Frank's seedling class
absorb themseves in a demanding
regimen of dancing four times a

week. Dance Heritage is the first
Stanford dance class to meet this
often.
The greater commitment and
demands of the students are part
of the department's effort to
reintroduce dancing as a serious
and thinking discipline, according
to department executive Janice
Ross.
Contrary to Ross' initial fears
that the demands of the class
would frighten students off, dan
cers have accepted the challenge
to work hard and apply them
selves. "It's a great course," said
freshman Tanya Leake. "It's very
rigorous, very disciplined."
The rigor comes from Frank's
innovative style. She emphasizes
learning by individual effort. Stu
dents are not led by the hand
every step of the way Frank dem
onstrates the moves, students
repeat them. She leaves them
freedom to grasp the form of the
movement on their own, although
she will often quietly walk across
the studio floor with an individ
ual, giving specific instruction.
"At first, (being in my class)
feels like a free-fall," Frank said.
"You wonder where the encour
agement is."
But individual effort and
struggle are the heart of Cunning
ham's style. Frank aims to help
dancers become "more inwardly
resourceful performers" who are
"not simply grinning and hot
footing it around," she said.
"They must throw themselves
into it in a much less self
conscious way. Dancing can show
beauty and contentment in the
body," she explained, saying that
Cunningham's style is an appre
ciation for form and a recognition
of natural beauty. "We are expres
sive all the time," said Frank.
"You know, when your eyes are
on your feet, you can't see where
you're going," said the progressive
instructor. And her students and
choreography have much to look
forward to.
Students learn more than sim
ply a style of dance. They learn
a certain frame of mind. Frank
teaches dancers to learn with a
"very adult attitude," asking
them for the same mental inten
sity and concentration they would
put into other academic disci
plines. She asks for the same "at
tention you might give to thread
ing a needle."
Frank received a master's
degree in dance from the Univer
sity of Illinois and taught at the
Cunningham studio in New York
before coming to California. She
continues to do choreography with
partner Deborah Riley, and will

teach here next quarter as well.
Frank, whose husband John
Mitchell is an assistant professor
of computer science here, is also
the mother of her one-year-old
daughter Laura.
Junior Richard Green says he
enjoys the "dedicated seriousness"
of Frank's class. "She pushes you
in a controlled way. People are
really digging in and working,"
he said.
And Frank thrives on this en
ergy.
"I like what happens when you
really apply yourself," she said.
Her opinions about dance relate
directly with her jump-in-and-do
it attitude toward life. Gazing in
tently forward, she puzzles over
the fact that students often appear
reluctant to take chances. "Some
body needs to say that shyness
doesn't function here," she said.
Shyness is something Frank

doesn't know herself, in her danc
ing or in her view of life.
"The most important thing is
dancing with people. I like group
projects. It is a nice way to come
to some small island of agreement
about something — it's very sat
isfying. You can't get more fun
damental than doing something
with someone at the immediate
moment," she said.
"It is interesting to really see
how people work over time, to see
people's capacity for growth and
change, to see what you can rea
sonably [expect to] accomplish."
Frank was most enchanted by
Cunningham's style because she
liked the personal "investigation"
that went on, and the emphasis
on movement rather than appear
ing immediately beautiful. Also,
she celebrates the democratic na
ture of the philosophy. "A great
variety of people are able to dance

well, and all are looked at as in
dividuals."
Her students appreciate the
style and meet the mental chal
lenge. "It is so different from
everything I'm used to," said
junior Cathleen Sheehan, an Eng
lish major. "You have to concen
trate very hard and be focused
on each specific movement."
Likewise, this dance method
elevates the dancer's awareness
of every part of the body, said
Green. This also means greater
consciousness of the difficulty of
the moves, and the accompanying
pain.
Green and Sheehan laughingly
admitted that thoughts of pain
and fear often run through their
minds as they are dancing.
"I think to myself 'Please don't
let me fall!' " said Sheehan.
Frank would let her fall only
as long as she would grow along
the way.
