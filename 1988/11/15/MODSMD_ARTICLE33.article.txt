# Melodies once lulled Meyer library, students still chew-se Trident's flavor
## 
### Mark Smoyer 
In his more sober moments, my
Uncle Arthur used to say in his
scratchy, droning voice, "Boy, as you
smell life's roses, don't forget to stop
and travel the highways." Of course,
since he was sober, I knew he didn't
really mean it.
"You're a great fool, Uncle Arthur,"
I'd say grandly, "but you're rich and
so I like you."
This response always filled him with
immense pleasure. Handing me a 20,
he'd say, "Take this, boy, and get on
with your worthless life."
Dear Bug,
Could you please explain to me why
the desks in Meyer Library have small
boxes with dials in the corner. I once
thought they were for piped-in Muzak
or something, but they don't have any
wires attached to them. Thanks.
—Marilyn McCoo
Reference librarian Pete Johnson
had all the answers for this one.
Johnson said the boxes and dials were
part of an audio system which existed
from 1966 into the early '70s. The
system was discontinued due to lack
of student interest. Basically, the
Audio-Visual Department simply
transmitted music from the first floor
up to the carrels on the other three.
In order to listen to the music, stu
dents would sign out a pair of head
phones then sit at any open carrel and
do their biomechanics to the soothing
sounds of artists ranging in style from
melodious Thelonious Monk to husky
voiced siren Laura Branigan. Every
group of audio-equipped desks would
be playing a different program of
music.
Those dials were simply for volume
adjustment. Unfortunately, these dials
don't even have numbers on them and
so now are useless for those who would

like to play exciting library procras
tination games like Guess What Num
ber My Volume Dial Is On. This ob
servation leaves room for a classic
number joke that should be used when
ever the time is right for rib-ticklin':
Why was six afraid of seven? .. . Be
cause seven ate nine.
If your victim doesn't guffaw at that
one, try this Bug-authored corollary
as punishment: Why did negative one
have to share the victory stand with
zero? Because zero won, too.

Why did negative one
have to share the victory
stand with zero? Be
cause zero won, too.

Incidentally, the Bug also asked
Johnson what the story was with those
Meyer carrels which have a card posted
indicating that they have been
reserved. He said that from the first
day of each trimester, students can
reserve a desk and the locker below it.
More amazingly, he said that stu
dents actually do sign up for carrels,
and that within a trimester's first few
days the reservation list is usually full.
Now I don't have any friends, but if
I did you can be damned sure they
wouldn't have desks reserved at the
library. Do these people think college
is supposed to be an academically
oriented experience, or something?
Dear Bug,
Why would a company name its
sugarless gum Trident when trident
literally means "three teeth," as taken
from the Latin ? I find this a startling
contradiction. Is it a contradiction bred
from simple stupidity or as a subtle

message to the consumer?
—Erik Estrada
Well, Ponch, my commitment to yel
low journalism forces me to answer
your question honestly and completely
Long have I known, and soon must I
tell, of the wily, plotting, conniving,
scheming, conspiratorial, and machi
nationalistic (whether you will or not)
nature of gum marketing.
But first, let's take a look into your
first question. The Bug called the
Warner-Lambert Company of Morris
Plains, New Jersey which manufac
tures Trident and spoke with Public
Relations official Marshall Malloy.
Malloy said he had never realized the
name was sort of inappropriate and
that neither had he ever heard talk
about its real meaning.
Plumbing the depths of profundity,
Malloy said "Frequently product
names don't mean anything literally.
They're not intended to mean any
thing, they just are."
Well, existentialism always throws
me off-kilter a little bit, but before
Malloy had gone too far into a com
parison of Camus and Danielle Steele,
I recovered to ask a couple more ques
tions about Trident.
Interestingly enough, if you're life
is an exercise in utter boredom, is the
fact that Trident was the original
sugarless gum. Mr. Malloy said it was
first marketed in the '60s and has
been competing with Wrigley's for the
top spot on the chewing gum chart
for most of past two decades. Now,
however, Trident has surpassed its
competitor and is the best-selling
chewing gum in the land.
Onwards to the most important
issue as raised by your second ques
tion. There is something fishy about
a gum being "recommended by three
out of four dentists to their patients
who chew gum." Why would a dentist

recommend a gum that would improve
the health of his patients' teeth,
thereby denying himself not only the
money, but also the sadistic release he
gets from fixing sugar-induced
cavities?
And where was tartar five years ago?
Is it such a mysterious substance that
nobody knew about it until a few years
ago, or was it fabricated as a
dental hazard when the toothpaste in
dustry's profit progress became stag
nant?
And is it possible that the person
who named the nation's first sugarless
gum named it "three teeth" because
he knew it was not really good for
one's teeth, but could not explicitly
reveal the vital secret because his
children were being held hostage (and
perhaps still are) by Warner-Lambert's
Division of Information?
And, most significantly, is it really
possible that the "big bubbles, no
troubles" cowboy who defeated his foes
by chewing Hubba Bubba bubble gum
could have gotten a hold of that kind
of gum in the days of the Wild West?
Well, who knows? It's hard to say
what the truth of the matter is, espe
cially if you have a speech impediment.
Until next week, the Bug has spoken.

Johnson said the boxes and dials were
part of an audio system which existed
from 1966 into the early '70s. The
system was discontinued due to lack
of student interest. Basically, the
Audio-Visual Department simply
transmitted music from the first floor
up to the carrels on the other three.
In order to listen to the music, stu
dents would sign out a pair of head
phones then sit at any open carrel and
do their biomechanics to the soothing
sounds of artists ranging in style from
melodious Thelonious Monk to husky
voiced siren Laura Branigan. Every
group of audio-equipped desks would
be playing a different program of
music.
Those dials were simply for volume
adjustment. Unfortunately, these dials
don't even have numbers on them and
so now are useless for those who would

like to play exciting library procras
tination games like Guess What Num
ber My Volume Dial Is On. This ob
servation leaves room for a classic
number joke that should be used when
ever the time is right for rib-ticklin':
Why was six afraid of seven? .. . Be
cause seven ate nine.
If your victim doesn't guffaw at that
one, try this Bug-authored corollary
as punishment: Why did negative one
have to share the victory stand with
zero? Because zero won, too.

Why did negative one
have to share the victory
stand with zero? Be
cause zero won, too.

Incidentally, the Bug also asked
Johnson what the story was with those
Meyer carrels which have a card posted
indicating that they have been
reserved. He said that from the first
day of each trimester, students can
reserve a desk and the locker below it.
More amazingly, he said that stu
dents actually do sign up for carrels,
and that within a trimester's first few
days the reservation list is usually full.
Now I don't have any friends, but if
I did you can be damned sure they
wouldn't have desks reserved at the
library. Do these people think college
is supposed to be an academically
oriented experience, or something?
Dear Bug,
Why would a company name its
sugarless gum Trident when trident
literally means "three teeth," as taken
from the Latin ? I find this a startling
contradiction. Is it a contradiction bred
from simple stupidity or as a subtle

message to the consumer?

Well, Ponch, my commitment to yel
low journalism forces me to answer
your question honestly and completely
Long have I known, and soon must I
tell, of the wily, plotting, conniving,
scheming, conspiratorial, and machi
nationalistic (whether you will or not)
nature of gum marketing.
But first, let's take a look into your
first question. The Bug called the
Warner-Lambert Company of Morris
Plains, New Jersey which manufac
tures Trident and spoke with Public
Relations official Marshall Malloy.
Malloy said he had never realized the
name was sort of inappropriate and
that neither had he ever heard talk
about its real meaning.
Plumbing the depths of profundity,
Malloy said "Frequently product
names don't mean anything literally.
They're not intended to mean any
thing, they just are."
Well, existentialism always throws
me off-kilter a little bit, but before
Malloy had gone too far into a com
parison of Camus and Danielle Steele,
I recovered to ask a couple more ques
tions about Trident.
Interestingly enough, if you're life
is an exercise in utter boredom, is the
fact that Trident was the original
sugarless gum. Mr. Malloy said it was
first marketed in the '60s and has
been competing with Wrigley's for the
top spot on the chewing gum chart
for most of past two decades. Now,
however, Trident has surpassed its
competitor and is the best-selling
chewing gum in the land.
Onwards to the most important
issue as raised by your second ques
tion. There is something fishy about
a gum being "recommended by three
out of four dentists to their patients
who chew gum." Why would a dentist

recommend a gum that would improve
the health of his patients' teeth,
thereby denying himself not only the
money, but also the sadistic release he
gets from fixing sugar-induced
cavities?
And where was tartar five years ago?
Is it such a mysterious substance that
nobody knew about it until a few years
ago, or was it fabricated as a
dental hazard when the toothpaste in
dustry's profit progress became stag
nant?
And is it possible that the person
who named the nation's first sugarless
gum named it "three teeth" because
he knew it was not really good for
one's teeth, but could not explicitly
reveal the vital secret because his
children were being held hostage (and
perhaps still are) by Warner-Lambert's
Division of Information?
And, most significantly, is it really
possible that the "big bubbles, no
troubles" cowboy who defeated his foes
by chewing Hubba Bubba bubble gum
could have gotten a hold of that kind
of gum in the days of the Wild West?
Well, who knows? It's hard to say
what the truth of the matter is, espe
cially if you have a speech impediment.
Until next week, the Bug has spoken.

In his more sober moments, my
Uncle Arthur used to say in his
scratchy, droning voice, "Boy, as you
smell life's roses, don't forget to stop
and travel the highways." Of course,
since he was sober, I knew he didn't
really mean it.
"You're a great fool, Uncle Arthur,"
I'd say grandly, "but you're rich and
so I like you."
This response always filled him with
immense pleasure. Handing me a 20,
he'd say, "Take this, boy, and get on
with your worthless life."
Dear Bug,
Could you please explain to me why
the desks in Meyer Library have small
boxes with dials in the corner. I once
thought they were for piped-in Muzak
