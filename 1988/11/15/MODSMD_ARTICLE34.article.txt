## Logic and fans don't get along 
### 
The annual football road
trip down south, when it
comes right down to it,
is all about having a good time.

Sure, we wanted Stanford to
beat the Bruins badly (in case
you're just now crawling out
from underneath a take-home
midterm, UCLA won 27-17).
But, at least for me, just
making a game of it made that
aspect (of the road trip's many
aspects) worthwhile.
That may seem illogical for
a dedicated Cardinal fan, but
it's true. But then again, calling
a dedicated Cardinal fan illogi
cal is probably redundant.
Exhibit A:
UCLA, after two straight
sub-par performances, was
seemingly ready to kill, and kill
early, and kill often. My shirt
had only been stepped on twice
by the time the Bruins had
shot out to a 10-0 lead.
Apparently undaunted, the
indefatigable Cardinal began
driving back. After two predict
able series of fullback Jon
Volpe up the middle time after
time, Stanford started to drive

with quarterback Jason
Palumbis dumping off short
pass after short pass.
But the drive was suddenly
halted when Palumbis flut
tered a pass inside the UCLA
10 and it was picked off, the
first of many forages to the
interception tree by the Bruins.
Now you have to understand
that, unlike someone watching
the game from the press box
or listening to the radio, I
didn't know Palumbis' statis
tics. In fact, out of 10 passes,
the freshman completed nine;
his only misfire was that in
terception. It was undoubtedly
the best start of his short
career.
Sitting in the stands, the
only numbers I knew were 10-
0. So I didn't feel very good
about Stanford's chances of
winning with him. That's not
very logical, especially since
Palumbis has a history of im
proving as the game goes on.
What makes even less sense
is that as UCLA drove to the
Stanford two-yard line,
seemingly on its way to take a
17-0 lead, I was feeling even
worse about Palumbis, even
though he was out of the game,
on the bench.
Then, in a shocking move,
Stanford Coach Jack El way
sent Brian Johnson in at quar
terback.
Johnson threw an intercep
tion on his first series, but
Stanford got the ball back when
