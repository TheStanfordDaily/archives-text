## Logic and fans don't get along 
### 
The annual football road
trip down south, when it
comes right down to it,
is all about having a good time.

Sure, we wanted Stanford to
beat the Bruins badly (in case
you're just now crawling out
from underneath a take-home
midterm, UCLA won 27-17).
But, at least for me, just
making a game of it made that
aspect (of the road trip's many
aspects) worthwhile.
That may seem illogical for
a dedicated Cardinal fan, but
it's true. But then again, calling
a dedicated Cardinal fan illogi
cal is probably redundant.
Exhibit A:
UCLA, after two straight
sub-par performances, was
seemingly ready to kill, and kill
early, and kill often. My shirt
had only been stepped on twice
by the time the Bruins had
shot out to a 10-0 lead.
Apparently undaunted, the
indefatigable Cardinal began
driving back. After two predict
able series of fullback Jon
Volpe up the middle time after
time, Stanford started to drive

with quarterback Jason
Palumbis dumping off short
pass after short pass.
But the drive was suddenly
halted when Palumbis flut
tered a pass inside the UCLA
10 and it was picked off, the
first of many forages to the
interception tree by the Bruins.
Now you have to understand
that, unlike someone watching
the game from the press box
or listening to the radio, I
didn't know Palumbis' statis
tics. In fact, out of 10 passes,
the freshman completed nine;
his only misfire was that in
terception. It was undoubtedly
the best start of his short
career.
Sitting in the stands, the
only numbers I knew were 10-
0. So I didn't feel very good
about Stanford's chances of
winning with him. That's not
very logical, especially since
Palumbis has a history of im
proving as the game goes on.
What makes even less sense
is that as UCLA drove to the
Stanford two-yard line,
seemingly on its way to take a
17-0 lead, I was feeling even
worse about Palumbis, even
though he was out of the game,
on the bench.
Then, in a shocking move,
Stanford Coach Jack El way
sent Brian Johnson in at quar
terback.
Johnson threw an intercep
tion on his first series, but
Stanford got the ball back when

Stanford's Brad Cook intercepted
UCLA quarterback Troy Aikman
in the end zone and returned it
to the UCLA 34.
The momentum was shifting.
Johnson had yet to really do any
thing, but I felt great about him.

When Stanford took a
14-10 lead at halftime,
due as much to de
fense as to offense,
Johnson was my
write-in vote for Pres
ident of the United
States.

So when Johnson avoided a sack
by dumping the ball out of
bounds, I thought about how in
telligent that was, especially in
light of the two sacks against
Palumbis earlier. When he fired
a ball at a receiver, even when it
was off-target, I thought about
how much more dangerous his
arm was than Palumbis".
And when Stanford took a 14-10

lead at haJftime, due as much to
defense as to offense, Johnson was
my write-in vote for President of
the United States.
I reason this way in my school
work, which explains my grades.
As a result, even when Stanford
sputtered later in the second half
and lost hold of the game, even
after Johnson had ended up with
three interceptions himself, the
quarterback switch by Elway
made sense to me.
Johnson had put Stanford back
in the game. I liked Johnson.
But with a chance to reflect on
Palumbis' numbers, and his
promise, you have to like him as
well.
And so in an illogical season
(five losses by 10 points or less),
with an illogical team, you're
facing Big Game Saturday with a
quarterback controversy that calls
for an illogical answer:
The two-quarterback attack.
Think about it. They'll call it
the make-a-big-wishbone.
Johnson and Palumbis side-by
side in the backfield, with Volpe
behind them at running back. No
one will know who the center is
going to hike to. Fakes by the
dozen. Flea-flickers galore.
Revenge for The Play!
Everybody will be happy. It
makes imperfect sense.
