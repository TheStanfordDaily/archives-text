No. 20 — Stanford.
The Associated Press laid down its official chal
lenge to the Stanford men's basketball team yes
terday, putting the Cardinal in its preseason top-20.
Stanford still has one preseason game left to work
any remaining kinks out, at 7:30 p.m. tonight at
Maples Pavilion against the Czechloslovakian Na
tional Team. But if it is truly a top-20 team, Stanford
has probably exorcised a sufficent amount of kinks
to beat the Czechs.
The Czechs have played tough but have lost the
first four games of their annual tour of NCAA
basketball.
They led Wyoming 50-46 at halftime in their first
game Nov. 9 before falling, 91-80. Tough losses to
UC-Santa Barbara (79-65), UC-Irvine (121-119) and
USC (92-87) followed.
Reportedly, Czechoslovakia is a physical team,
like most European squads, so that should give
Stanford's deep front line of seniors Bryan
McSweeney, Howard Wright, and Eric Reveno,
junior Derek Bruton, sophomore Andrew Vlahov
and freshman Adam Keefe some good work.
But, the Czechs like to bang away from three-point
country as well. Josef Jelinek, a 6-foot-4 guard, has
averaged just under 25 points per game on the tour.
Stanford leaves later this week for Missoula,
Mont., where it opens its regular season against
Montana Friday in the first round of the Big Apple
NIT. The Cardinal's home opener is Dec. 2 against
Cornell in the first round of the annual Apple
Invitational.
