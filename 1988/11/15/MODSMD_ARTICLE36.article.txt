# Palumbis will start Big Game
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
So much for controversy.
Stanford football Coach Jack
Elway announced Jason Palumbis
would start at quarterback in Big
Game Saturday. Although
Palumbis was pulled from the
contest at UCLA last Saturday in
the second quarter in favor of
Brian Johnson, Elway elected to
give him his seventh consecutive
start.
Stanford enters Big Game with
a 3-6-1 record, 1-5-1 in the Pacific
10 Conference, while California is
5-5, 1-5 in league.
"It'll be Jason," Elway said. "All
in all, based on the circumstances
. . . you're going to go with one.
This is not a negative decision
being made; this is a positive de
cision."
Palumbis was 9-of-10 for 71
yards against the Bruins, but his
10th pass was an interception and
it caused Elway to remove him.
Johnson was 14-of-26 for 123
yards, one touchdown and three
interceptions.
" 'Why,' is a question that I get
ridiculous on and say I had a vi
sion," Elway joked. "1 woke up at
four in the morning and said it
was Jason."
More seriously, Elway called
Johnson's performance Saturday
"fine. Brian came in and did some
good things. Got to an uncovered
receiver a couple of times,
scrambled when the receivers
were covered. I talked to Brian
and I thought his performance
was good. There were a lot of

weird things that happened."
Elway removed Johnson from
the Notre Dame game at halftime
and replaced him with Palumbis.
Elway then waited until Thursday
before announcing the starter for
the next game, against San Jose
State. "I wanted to announce it
today [Monday] so neither one . ..
will be held in suspense.
"If we beat Cal I made the right
decision, if I didn't the season is
over."
Palumbis will face a Golden
Bear squad that has had almost
as strange a season as the Cardi
nal. After opening with an easy
win over Pacific, the Bears lost
at Oregon State on a field goal
with 16 seconds remaining and
the timer later admitted that he
had mistakenly added a minute
to the fourth quarter. Thus Cal
led after 60 minutes but lost after
61.
Cal defensive tackle Joel Dick
son was shot outside a party in
Berkeley a few weeks later and
was lost for the season. Then, only
last week, the Bears led 24-3 at
halftime against Washington only
to see the Huskies come back and
win the game on a field goal with
two seconds left.
"We've had some interesting
things happen to this club," Cal
Coach Bruce Snyder said. "I'm
pleased with the team. . . .
They're a really resilient bunch.
They all believe they should have
a few more wins."
The Bears are led by their quar
terback, as most Pac-10 teams ap
pear to be this year. Troy Taylor
has thrown for more than 2100

yards and 15 touchdowns. "Troy
Taylor, this year, statistically is
really having a great year,"
Snyder said. "I'm certainly
pleased with hita as far as leading
our club."
California will be striving for
its first winning season since 1982
in the Big Game this year but is
facing a Stanford team hungry
for victory.

'We're not disap
pointed in how
we're playing. It is
disappointing that
our record is what
it is.'
— Rob Hinckley

"It just means everything to
seniors because it's your last
game," junior offensive guard
Andy Papathanassiou said. "You
go out there and win it for them."
But Papathanassiou doesn't
feel a win over Cal would make
up for all the heartbreaks that
have come Stanford's way this
season. "You can't say, 'Well it
was a good season because we
beat Cal,' " he said. "If you win
this game, it's another category.
It's like your grades and your
SATs in high school. The season
is like your grades and Big Game

is like your SATs, a one-time
shot."
"This is our chance to get a
win," outside linebacker Rob
Hinckley said. "We're not disap
pointed in how we're playing. .. .
It is disappointing that our record
is what it is. .. . This is a chance,
especially to show the people
around here, to show them how
well we can play."
Card notes
Hinckley, who had 20 tackles, 4 and
1/2 sacks and forced a fumble Saturday,
added the Pac-10 Defensive Player-of
the-Week Award to the national Sports
Illustrated Defensive Player-of-the-Week
award he won Sunday.
The Cardinal defense held UCLA
Heisman Trophy candidate Troy Aik
man to 13-of-24 passing Saturday, total
ing 135 yards, which, coupled with last
week's poor performance, would appar
ently leave him behind USC quarterback
Rodney Peete and Oklahoma State tail
back Barry Sanders in the Heisman
derby. The Stanford revolving quarter
backs were a combined 23-for-36 for 194
yards by way of comparison.
Stanford suffered a few injuries in
the game Saturday. Inside linebacker
Barry McKeever dislocated his left
shoulder and will probably not play in
Big Game, the senior's final in a Stan
ford uniform. Coupled with the fact that
inside linebacker Jono Tunney played
only a few plays and Eric Pierce didn't
play at all due to injuries, the Cardinal
is running very thin in the linebacking
corps.
Outside linebacker Bruce Lang suf
fered a dislocated thumb and free safety
Mike Newton strained his neck and both
are listed as questionable.

and I thought his performance
was good. There were a lot of

weird things that happened."
Elway removed Johnson from
the Notre Dame game at halftime
and replaced him with Palumbis.
Elway then waited until Thursday
before announcing the starter for
the next game, against San Jose
State. "I wanted to announce it
today [Monday] so neither one . ..
will be held in suspense.
"If we beat Cal I made the right
decision, if I didn't the season is
over."
Palumbis will face a Golden
Bear squad that has had almost
as strange a season as the Cardi
nal. After opening with an easy
win over Pacific, the Bears lost
at Oregon State on a field goal
with 16 seconds remaining and
the timer later admitted that he
had mistakenly added a minute
to the fourth quarter. Thus Cal
led after 60 minutes but lost after
61.
Cal defensive tackle Joel Dick
son was shot outside a party in
Berkeley a few weeks later and
was lost for the season. Then, only
last week, the Bears led 24-3 at
halftime against Washington only
to see the Huskies come back and
win the game on a field goal with
two seconds left.
"We've had some interesting
things happen to this club," Cal
Coach Bruce Snyder said. "I'm
pleased with the team. . . .
They're a really resilient bunch.
They all believe they should have
a few more wins."
The Bears are led by their quar
terback, as most Pac-10 teams ap
pear to be this year. Troy Taylor
has thrown for more than 2100

yards and 15 touchdowns. "Troy
Taylor, this year, statistically is
really having a great year,"
Snyder said. "I'm certainly
pleased with hita as far as leading
our club."
California will be striving for
its first winning season since 1982
in the Big Game this year but is
facing a Stanford team hungry
for victory.

"It just means everything to
seniors because it's your last
game," junior offensive guard
Andy Papathanassiou said. "You
go out there and win it for them."
But Papathanassiou doesn't
feel a win over Cal would make
up for all the heartbreaks that
have come Stanford's way this
season. "You can't say, 'Well it
was a good season because we
beat Cal,' " he said. "If you win
this game, it's another category.
It's like your grades and your
SATs in high school. The season
is like your grades and Big Game

is like your SATs, a one-time
shot."
"This is our chance to get a
win," outside linebacker Rob
Hinckley said. "We're not disap

It is disappointing that our record

especially to show the people
around here, to show them how
well we can play."
Card notes
Hinckley, who had 20 tackles, 4 and
1/2 sacks and forced a fumble Saturday,
added the Pac-10 Defensive Player-of
the-Week Award to the national Sports
Illustrated Defensive Player-of-the-Week
award he won Sunday.
The Cardinal defense held UCLA
Heisman Trophy candidate Troy Aik
man to 13-of-24 passing Saturday, total
ing 135 yards, which, coupled with last
week's poor performance, would appar
ently leave him behind USC quarterback
Rodney Peete and Oklahoma State tail
back Barry Sanders in the Heisman
derby. The Stanford revolving quarter
backs were a combined 23-for-36 for 194
yards by way of comparison.
Stanford suffered a few injuries in
the game Saturday. Inside linebacker
Barry McKeever dislocated his left
shoulder and will probably not play in
Big Game, the senior's final in a Stan
ford uniform. Coupled with the fact that
inside linebacker Jono Tunney played
only a few plays and Eric Pierce didn't
play at all due to injuries, the Cardinal
is running very thin in the linebacking
corps.
Outside linebacker Bruce Lang suf
fered a dislocated thumb and free safety
Mike Newton strained his neck and both
are listed as questionable.

Jason Palumbis was picked to start Big Game at quarterback by
Jack Elway yesterday, quelling any talk of a QB controversy.
So much for controversy.
Stanford football Coach Jack
Elway announced Jason Palumbis
would start at quarterback in Big
Game Saturday. Although
Palumbis was pulled from the
contest at UCLA last Saturday in
the second quarter in favor of
Brian Johnson, Elway elected to
give him his seventh consecutive
start.
Stanford enters Big Game with
a 3-6-1 record, 1-5-1 in the Pacific
10 Conference, while California is
5-5, 1-5 in league.
"It'll be Jason," Elway said. "All
in all, based on the circumstances
. . . you're going to go with one.
This is not a negative decision
being made; this is a positive de
cision."
Palumbis was 9-of-10 for 71
yards against the Bruins, but his
10th pass was an interception and
it caused Elway to remove him.
Johnson was 14-of-26 for 123
yards, one touchdown and three
interceptions.
" 'Why,' is a question that I get
ridiculous on and say I had a vi
sion," Elway joked. "1 woke up at
four in the morning and said it
was Jason."
More seriously, Elway called
Johnson's performance Saturday
"fine. Brian came in and did some
good things. Got to an uncovered
receiver a couple of times,
scrambled when the receivers
were covered. I talked to Brian
and I thought his performance
was good. There were a lot of

weird things that happened."
Elway removed Johnson from
the Notre Dame game at halftime
and replaced him with Palumbis.
Elway then waited until Thursday
before announcing the starter for
the next game, against San Jose
