# Men's golf in 10th at USF Invite
## 
### Eugene Sakai Staff writer 
The Olympic Golf Course in San
Francisco, one of the most famous golf
courses on the West Coast, is the current
site of the USF Invitational Golf Tour
nament, where the Stanford men's golf
team is trying to improve their standing
in the NCAA Western District.
The somewhat cramped layout of the
Olympic Course stands in stark contrast
to the vast open expanses of the team's
home course at Stanford.
"It's a basic city course," junior Mark
Funseth said. "It's very long, very tight.
If you get it into the trees, you are in
real trouble. It is probably the toughest
course that we will play all year."
The team's scores from the first two
rounds, played yesterday, would seem
to reflect Funseth's analysis. With a
team total of 626, the Cardinal stands
only 10th in a field of 16 teams, 20
shots behind first-place UCLA. Only
freshman Christian Cevaer and junior
Josh Zander were able to perform up
to the high standards that the team
has been setting for itself this year,
each carding a 152.

'[Stanford's golfers]
didn't play as well as they
and I would have liked.'

"It's discouraging to get beaten by
UCLA by 20 shots," Stanford Coach
Wally Goodwin said. "I'm pleased with
the play of Josh and Christian, but the
rest of the guys didn't play as well as
they and I would have liked."
Juniors Funseth and Don Christensen
shot 162 and 163, respectively, and Brad
Geer came in with a two-round total of
166. Goer's high scores were somewhat
of a surprise, as many of the team mem
bers felt that the long fairways of the
Olympic Club were suited to the 6-2
senior's powerful style.
In a practice round prior to the be
ginning of the tournament, Geer had a
hole in one, which seemed to bode well
for both his and the team's fortunes,
but as things turned out, neither was
the case.
"The field is only medium strong,"

Zander said. "It is not as strong as the
field we will be facing in Hawaii, but
UCLA is here, Washington is here,
Cal. . . I think that Cal will end up doing
really well here because they are so
used to city courses."
The team is coming off their best
performance of the year, a first-place
finish in the UOP Tournament almost
a month ago. However, the Cardinal is
not ranked in the top five in the district.
The USF tournament stands as an im
portant opportunity to impress the se
lection committee that will choose who
goes to the regionals of the NCAA tour
ney.
"Now that we won at Stockton, we
have something to show (to the com
mittee)," Zander said. "This type of
course really favors the longer hitters,
but most of us do hit long."
With 20 strokes separating the Car
dinal from the leaders of the Western
District, UCLA and Washington, it
would seem that impressing the NCAA
selection committee will have to wait
until another day. But with a squad as
young and as talented as the one Good
win has assembled, one never can oe
quite sure when writing them off.
