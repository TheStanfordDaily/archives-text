# Bills stampede over Dolphins, 31-6
## First-place Buffalo improves record to 10-1, tops in NFL 
### 
MIAMI (AP) — Ronnie Har
mon ran for one touchdown and
caught a 16-yard pass from Jim
Kelly for another and Robb Rid
dick had two 1-yard scoring runs
as the Buffalo Bills maintained
the NFL's best record by beating
Miami 31-6 Monday night.
It was the sixth straight win
for the Bills, 10-1, who main
tained their lead of four games
over New England and In
dianapolis in the AFC East with
five games to go.
The Bills, who intercepted Dan
Marino three times, scored on
their first possession of the
game. They led 10-6 at halftime
and, relying mainly on a defense
led by Bruce Smith, Cornelius
Bennett and Art Still that held
Miami to just 33 yards rushing,
the Bills handed the Dolphins
their worst home loss since 1970.
Then they put the game away
with two touchdowns two and a
half minutes apart in the third
quarter.
The first score, with 5:33 left
in the period, came on Riddick's
1-yard plunge at the end of an

80-yard drive aided by two
Miami penalties. The second was
a 6-yard run by Harmon set up
by Bennett's interception and
30-yard return of a Marino pass
on Miami's first play after the
kickoff.
Riddick added his second TD
2:16 into the fourth quarter fol
lowing a nine-play, 54-yard drive
set up by free safety Mark
Kelso's interception and 25-yard
return. It was the third straight
game in which Kelso had an in
terception and gave him seven
for the season, second in the
NFL.
The Bills' 10-1 record repre
sents their best start since 1964
and the six-game winning streak
is their longest since 1974. They
lead 8-3 Cincinnati by two games
in the race for the home-field
advantage in the AFC playoffs.
Miami, meanwhile, fell to 5-6,
leaving it behind six 6-5 teams
and the 5-5-1 New York Jets in
the bid for an AFC wild-card
spot.
Riddick carried 16 times for
77 yards and had five receptions
for 48 yards, while Harmon

gained 62 yards in 15 carries
and had four catches for 37
yards. Kelly completed 18 passes
in 26 attempts for 211 yards,
163 of them in the first half as
the Bills stayed mainly on the
ground in the second half.
Marino was 19 of 30 for 224
yards.
Buffalo outgained Miami 416
to 257 with a balanced attack
that netted 205 yards on the
ground and 211 in the air. The
only consolation for the Dol
phins was not allowing a sack
for the seventh straight game,
extending their NFL record, set
last week.
The Bills used the first 5:46
to go 71 yards in 13 plays to
take a 7-0 lead. The scoring play
was a 16-yard pass from Kelly
to Harmon, who took the ball in
front of Liffort Hobley and fell
into the end zone. It was the
first touchdown of the season in
five quarters played by the two
teams — the first game was an
all-field-goal affair won by Buf
falo 9-6.
The Dolphins' first threat

came on a drive that went 60
yards and ended at the Buffalo
5 early in the second quarter
when Miami declined a field goal
try and Woody Bennett was
stuffed by Still on fourth-and-1.
The Bills then drove 81 yards
in 13 plays to the Miami 12,
setting up a 30-yard field goal
by Scott Norwood that gave Buf
falo a 10-0 lead midway through
the second quarter.
Then Miami went 91 yards in
10 plays and two key penalties
to cut the deficit to 10-6 on a
4-yard pass from Marino to
Mark Clayton with 1:36 left in
the half. However, the extra
point failed when the snap went
high and holder Ron Jaworski
futilely threw the ball into the
end zone.
Buffalo had a chance to extend
the lead but Norwood missed
twice at the end of the half, first
from 44 yards, then from 39
after James Pruitt went offside.
It was Norwood's first miss after
11 straight field goals and his
first failure in 19 attempts from
inside 40 yards this season.

to go 71 yards in 13 plays to
take a 7-0 lead. The scoring play
was a 16-yard pass from Kelly
to Harmon, who took the ball in
front of Liffort Hobley and fell
into the end zone. It was the
first touchdown of the season in
five quarters played by the two
teams — the first game was an
all-field-goal affair won by Buf
falo 9-6.
The Dolphins' first threat

came on a drive that went 60
yards and ended at the Buffalo
5 early in the second quarter
when Miami declined a field goal
try and Woody Bennett was
stuffed by Still on fourth-and-1.
The Bills then drove 81 yards
in 13 plays to the Miami 12,
setting up a 30-yard field goal
by Scott Norwood that gave Buf
falo a 10-0 lead midway through
the second quarter.
Then Miami went 91 yards in
10 plays and two key penalties
to cut the deficit to 10-6 on a
4-yard pass from Marino to
Mark Clayton with 1:36 left in
the half. However, the extra
point failed when the snap went
high and holder Ron Jaworski
futilely threw the ball into the
end zone.
Buffalo had a chance to extend
the lead but Norwood missed
twice at the end of the half, first
from 44 yards, then from 39
after James Pruitt went offside.
It was Norwood's first miss after
11 straight field goals and his
first failure in 19 attempts from
inside 40 yards this season.
MIAMI (AP) — Ronnie Har
mon ran for one touchdown and
caught a 16-yard pass from Jim
Kelly for another and Robb Rid
dick had two 1-yard scoring runs
as the Buffalo Bills maintained
the NFL's best record by beating
Miami 31-6 Monday night.
It was the sixth straight win
for the Bills, 10-1, who main
tained their lead of four games
over New England and In
dianapolis in the AFC East with
five games to go.
The Bills, who intercepted Dan
Marino three times, scored on
their first possession of the
game. They led 10-6 at halftime
and, relying mainly on a defense
led by Bruce Smith, Cornelius
Bennett and Art Still that held
Miami to just 33 yards rushing,
the Bills handed the Dolphins
their worst home loss since 1970.
Then they put the game away
with two touchdowns two and a
half minutes apart in the third
quarter.
The first score, with 5:33 left
in the period, came on Riddick's
1-yard plunge at the end of an

80-yard drive aided by two
Miami penalties. The second was
a 6-yard run by Harmon set up
by Bennett's interception and
30-yard return of a Marino pass
on Miami's first play after the
kickoff.
Riddick added his second TD
2:16 into the fourth quarter fol
lowing a nine-play, 54-yard drive
set up by free safety Mark
Kelso's interception and 25-yard
return. It was the third straight
game in which Kelso had an in
terception and gave him seven
for the season, second in the
NFL.
The Bills' 10-1 record repre
sents their best start since 1964
and the six-game winning streak
is their longest since 1974. They
lead 8-3 Cincinnati by two games
in the race for the home-field
advantage in the AFC playoffs.
Miami, meanwhile, fell to 5-6,
leaving it behind six 6-5 teams
and the 5-5-1 New York Jets in
the bid for an AFC wild-card
spot.
Riddick carried 16 times for
77 yards and had five receptions
for 48 yards, while Harmon

gained 62 yards in 15 carries
and had four catches for 37
yards. Kelly completed 18 passes
in 26 attempts for 211 yards,
163 of them in the first half as
the Bills stayed mainly on the
ground in the second half.
Marino was 19 of 30 for 224
yards.
Buffalo outgained Miami 416
to 257 with a balanced attack
that netted 205 yards on the
ground and 211 in the air. The
only consolation for the Dol
phins was not allowing a sack
for the seventh straight game,
extending their NFL record, set
last week.
The Bills used the first 5:46
to go 71 yards in 13 plays to
take a 7-0 lead. The scoring play
was a 16-yard pass from Kelly
