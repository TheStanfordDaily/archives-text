# Three jailed in Lockheed rally

### Jock Friedly Senior staff writer 
Three Stanford students were
arrested yesterday morning at the
Santa Cruz Lockheed plant in a
protest against the building of the
Trident II D-5, a submarine
launched, first-strike nuclear mis
sile.
After blocking an entrance to
the Lockheed plant for almost two
hours in the cold early-morning
mist, Stanford undergraduates
Joanie Mayer, Matt Price and
Maggie Harrison were swept up
by police clad in riot gear just
before dawn.
According to Deputy John Hop
per, a representative of the Santa
Cruz SherrifTs Office, 51 people
were arrested at the protest. The
demonstration involved more
than 200 people, including 16
Stanford students.
The protesters did not resist
arrest, and were held in custody
at the Santa Cruz Municipal
Courthouse, where thev were ar

raigned at 3:30 p.m. The three
Stanford students pleaded no con
test to the charge of blocking a
roadway. The infraction generally
carries a $50 fine, according to
Hopper, but because the three had
spent time in custody, the fine
was dropped and they were re
leased.
The arrests came after the stu
dents sat in a roadway with about
50 other demonstrators, closing
off the only entrance to the
Lockheed plant. Protesters
shouted anti-war slogans amid the
honks of car horns of workers who
were arriving at the plant. As
many as 40 cars in all were
delayed up to an hour by the
protests, according to students
who were at the protest.
The arrests occurred about 6
a.m., one hour before the protest
ended. This was the fourth such
demonstration at the plant in less
than one week, one police repre
sentative said.
The protesters organized for
the demonstration Sunday after

noon at Columbae House, a Row
house with the theme of non
violence. Several of the protesters,
including Price and Mayer are res
idents of Columbae.
At the meeting, the students
created a support group for the
three students who planned to get
arrested at the protest. The sup
port group was formed to get in
formation about the arrested stu
dents, arrange legal support for
those jailed and to tell friends and
family of their whereabouts.
Mayer, a sophomore, led the
meeting, calling for an "absolutely
non-violent" protest. "There are
political reasons for me to stay in
jail," Mayer said, announcing her
intention to get arrested and stay
in jail rather than be cited with
a fine that would release her from
prison.
The demonstrators protested
against Lockheed's development
of one component of the Trident
II D-5, a missile with first-strike
