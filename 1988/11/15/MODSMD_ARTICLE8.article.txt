Three mild earthquakes shook
the Bay Area yesterday morning,
interrupting campus classes for
less than a minute.
The U.S. Geological Survey in
Menlo Park reported earthquakes
at 10:58, 11:21 and 11:52 a.m.
with magnitudes of 2.4, 3.0 and
2.75, respectively, on the Richter
scale. The epicenters were located
eight miles southwest of Menlo
Park and one to two miles west
southwest of Portola Valley.
Most students felt only the sec
ond and largest quake.
An Economics 1 lecture in
Kresge Auditorium was briefly
disrupted when the second
trembler hit. Sofia Sorensen, a
sophomore from Illinois, said she
did not feel Kresge shake but
heard a loud bang. "We didn't

know if it was a gunshot or
firecrackers," she said.
Students talked excitedly
among themselves, causing Eco
nomics Prof. John Taylor to in
terrupt his lecture to tell students
to be quiet.
Taylor had been lecturing about
the technological changes in eco
nomic growth, and when the big
bang from earthquake came, he
added a joke about the"the Big
Bang."
Freshman Mike Soto from
Texas said it was the first earth
quake he had ever felt. "I was
taking a nap and all of a sudden
I felt a shake. I wasn't sure if I
was dreaming or if it was an
earthquake," he said.
Yesterday's series of tremblers
followed last week's larger quake,
which measured 4.7 on the Rich
ter scale.
