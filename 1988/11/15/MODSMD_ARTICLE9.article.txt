# Top political reporter to explain Bush victory
## 
### John Wagner Staff writer 
Following close on the heels of
a presidential campaign, Pulitzer
Prize-winning journalist David
Broder will assess the 1988 elec
tion and the role of the media in
campaign coverage tonight at
Kresge Auditorium.
Broder's speech — "Reflections
on the Press and Presidential
Election" — will begin at 7:30
p.m. and is open to the public,
free of charge.
Broder, the national political

correspondent of The Washington
Post and columnist, is regarded
as "one of the greatest political
journalists ever," said Harry
Press, managing director of the
Knight Fellowship Program,
which is sponsoring the speech.
In 1973, Broder won the Pulit
zer Prize for distinguished com
mentary.
He has been a reporter in Wash
ington since 1956, and has served
as a national political correspon
dent and columnist for The Post
for the last 22 years. His twice

weekly, nationally syndicated
column appears in more than 300
newspapers across the country.
In addition, Broder appears fre
quently on such television shows
as "Today," "Meet the Press" and
"Washington Week in Review."
He has written four books on
journalistic and political topics,
including his most recent book,
"Behind the Front Page: A Candid
Look at How the News is Made,"
published in 1987.
In "Behind the Front Page,"
Broder uses personal anecdotes to

expose the frailties of the news
profession and to critique its
shortcomings, not hesitating to
point the finger at himself. "In
many of the cautionary tales that
follow," Broder wrote in his in
troduction, "the person who
screwed up was the person who
stares back sleepily from the mir
ror when I shave."
Broder has also been a fellow
of the Institute of Politics at the
John F. Kennedy School of Gov
ernment at Harvard University
and a fellow of the Institute of
Policy Sciences and Public Affairs

at Duke University.
Broder's apppearance is spon
sored by the Knight Fellowships
for Professional Journalists. The
fellowships bring to campus 12
U.S. and six international jour
nalists, who spend their academic
year at the University doing class
room work, pursuing independent
studies and attending special
seminars.
According to Press, Broder's ap
pearance will be the first in what
will be an annual campus lecture
by prominent journalists and
public figures.
