[The ASSU NEWS presentsft
RACISM ami CHANGE I
The COP and the ASSU in general have been working hard to inform, educate and provide resources for change. Because racism has had such far-reaching impact at Stanford, the
Office of Public Affairs thought it appropriate to provide a special edition of the ASSU News on Racism and Change. At some point or another, many students get "sick and tired" of
the hype. But this page is designed to put the issues into a user-friendly perspective. So, find a little quiet-time in your day, sit back, and expand your horizons in understanding the
issues of Racism and Change.
