THE MANDATE FOR CHANGE
I. We demand that the following changes be made to begin to strengthen or establish
fully institutionalized ethnic studies departments at Stanford:
• the full institutionalization of the Afro-Amercian Studies Program;
• the strengthening of the Chicano fellow program (1) by hiring a permanent director
and (2) by establishing a Chicano Studies Core Curriculum consisting of three
undergraduate classes;
• the establishment of Asian-American Studies;
• the establishment of Native American Studies.
2. We demand that an Ethnic Studies graduation requirement be instituted.
3. We demand that the following changes be made to establish full institutional support for
our ethnic centers;
• that all of the Ethnic Deans be full-time
• that increased staffing be allotted to fulfill all of the administrative and programming
functions of the center;
• that increased funding be allocated to each center so as to meet their basic as well as
adminstrative, programming and facilities improvement needs.
4. We demand the following increase in the appointment of minority faculty;
• the immediate hiring of Jose Cuellar to teach Chicano Studies;
• the immediate hiring of Greg Sarris as a Native American professor;
• the immediate hiring of an Asian-American history professor to teach the one
Asian-American studies class at the University;
• the immediate hiring of a professor of Black history and of a professor of Black
political science;
• a commitment to setting aside at least half of the Centennial faculty positions for
faculty of color.

• an end to the practice of "last hired, first fired" for Black workers.

FACTS:
• Over the last ten years, despite the University's efforts to increase minority
faculty, the proportion of minority faculty to total faculty has hardly
changed: from 7% to 8%; and the proportion of tenured faculty has remained
the same at 6%.
• Many areas of the University that are heavily involved in undergraduate
instruction, such as Humanities, Natural Sciences, Social Sciences and Earth
Sciences, have experienced little or no change in proportion of minority
faculty.
• In the past ten years, there were 66 new tenure-line minority
appointments, but there were 41 minority departures.
• There were no classes listed in Courses and Degrees between 1984 and
1987, excluding 1986-87, that dealt directly with material on
Asian-Amercians.
• Asian-American and American Indian study programs do not exist at
Stanford.
• General interest of students in ethnic studies related curriculum during
the past three years has increased:
- enrollment in courses dealing directly with material on United States'
racial minority groups increased by 20%;
- in courses offering some material relevant to the study of ethnic
minorities, enrollment has increased 83%.

The Campaign for a Full-Time Dean
A demand high on the list of priorities of the Students of Color Coalition is that all four
communities' deans be elevated to full-time status. This past summer, the Afro-American Dean
achieved full-time status, and the Asian-American Dean increased to three-quarters time; the
Chicano and Native American communities have only half-time deans. MEChA has developed a
detailed proposal outlining the need for the responsibilities of a full-time dean. They are currently
calling for an immediate commitment to the money for a full-time dean and for the hiring of
staff to meet the community's needs before the full-time dean is hired.
The MEChA proposal explains that their dean has the following responsibilities: daily
operation of their full-time community center, management and guidance of the staff
coordination of programming of over twenty Chicano student organizations, facilitation of
communication within the entire community, academic and personal advising of students,
helping student organizations with fundraising needs, organization of leadership training
programs, acting as a liaison with the local Chicano community, and advocating student needs to
other administrators.
All this is supposed to be done by someone working twenty hours per week. This is not
humanly possible. Stanford needs to demonstrate a full commitment to serving the needs of
students of color and raise the deans for the Asian-American, Chicano and Native American
communities to full-time status. The need is clear; the administration should not force groups
like MEC hA to go through a long, drawn out committee process. The money should be made
available now.
