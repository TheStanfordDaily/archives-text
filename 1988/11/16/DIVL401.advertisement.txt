Questions on Racism and the Mandate for Change
by the ASSU Council of Presidents
In discussing the issues of the Mandate for Change and the Students of Color Coaltion with many students,
we encountered a lot of questions. Many of the following questions arose during discussions at dorm
representatives meetings last week at Flo Mo, Branner, Toyon, Lagunita, Stern and Wilbur. This is our
attempt to answer some of them, explain our perspective and contribute our voice tc the effort to build an
equal and democratic university.
Why is there all this fuss over one little flyer? Aren't people overreacting?
• It is a big deal. We cannot isolate the flyer from its context: an unequal society where racism is widespread
and systematic. To post a racially offensive flyer in the Afro-American theme house on the door of a Black
student sends the message, "We're sick of the BSU, we're tired of students of color fighting for empowerment
within the university." That's a pretty serious message.
• The fuss isn't only over the flyer. The flyer has simply drawn the campus' attention to the problem that
exists in every aspect of this university, year after year: the disrespect accorded to the need and experience of
students of color on this campus and in this society. The groups that make up the Students of Color Coalition
(MEChA, the Black Student Union, the Asian-American Student Association, and the Stanford American
Indian Organization) have voiced the same concerns for many, many years.
These guys are the only two people out of the whole school. Why is the BSU blaming
everyone, and saying all white students are racist?
• They aren't. The BSU never said that all white students are racist, and those that make this claim should
seriously examine why they developed this misconception.
• We all do need to take a measure of responsibility for racism; we can't just shrug it off as being the
problem of two misguided individuals. We all grow up in an unequal society plagued with problems like racism,
and we are not immune to the effects. This is what makes it so important that we challenge ourselves to learn
more about the history and experience of people of color and confront our own background and attitudes.
• Most importantly, the problem is institutionalized racism. This institution does not value and support the
needs of students of color. Ethnic Studies programs remain weak and without institutional support, adequate
support services such as full-time deans and decent ethic centers continue to be denied to students of color,
the faculty remains overwhelmingly white... Institutional racism is a serious problem that pervades many levels
of this university.
I'm tired of all this talk about diversity and issues of racism. We should concentrate
on our similarities, not our differences. Why do people of color always separate and
segregate themselves?
• Students of color do not divide people. This society divides people. People are divided and do not fully
appreciate others' cultures because of the existence of racism. A recognition of our differences should not be
a barrier to building respect for one another. We need to learn to appreciate each other because of our differences,
not in spite of them.
• The strength of the organizations of students of color enables us to work toward building a true rainbow
society, one where all peoples and all cultures are respected and valued. Respect comes when we all have a
true appreciation of one another's history and experience. Because this society is unequal, ethnic groups need
to come together to strengthen themselves. Once this happens, then it is possible for all people to come together
on an equal and respectful basis, and it is possible for all of us to learn and gain from their strength. The
existence and strength of the students of color organization on this campus make it more possible to build a
truly equal and diverse society.
Why are they always making "demands?" Wouldn't it be better just to ask for things
and go through normal university channels?
• The demands in the Mandate for Change have been circulating through the university for years; some were
first put forward by students of color in 1968. The problem is that these demands are stuck in university
channels while people take years to "investigate" and "send it to committee."
• Students of color only receive what they ask for when they make demands and exert some pressure. We
can find this just by looking at Stanford's history. When Black students took over the microphone at a
university program in 1968, Stanford started admitting Blacks in large numbers. When students made noise
about Western Culture in 1985, the administration and faculty established the Task Force that eventually
developed CIV. When students sat in the President's Office in 1986, the administration created the "University
Committee in Minority Issues" and established a Dean for Asian-American students. Yet when there has been
no pressure, the administration has seldom moved.
Is it really appropriate for the ASSU to be involved in this? Isn't it special interest?
• The ASSU has the responsiblity to represent all students on this campus. The representative organizations
of students of color have made these demands, and we are responding to the legitimate needs and demands
of a significant part of the student body. In fact, the students of color organization have played the major role
in transforming the ASSU into a student government that seeks to provide relevant services, involve students
at all levels, and take positions on issues of democracy on campus.
• Racism is not a "special interest" concern. It affects all students, and it is of concern to all people who
believe in fairness and justice. We see our role as the representatives of the student body to be to stand up for
what is right; and the Mandate for Change is clearly right. Martin Luther King said that one person cannot be
free until all people are free, and we believe that.
What can I do about this? Do white students have any role?
• We can challenge ourselves to make a personal commitment to working for a society that respects all
people. We can learn more about these issues by taking Ethnic Studies courses and attending programs put
on by the students of color communities. We can also personally confront racist arid insensitive attitudes on
a personal level at all times.
• All students can contribute to building a rainbow society...where all groups are strong and
respected...where the composition of Stanford's students and faculty reflect the diversity of this society...where
the university makes a commitment to meet the needs of all students in staffing and support services...
• We can only do this by getting involved. The students of color organizations, the BSU, MEChA, AASA,
and SAIO are leading the way in defining and fighting for their needs. All students'can help to contribute to
this effort by joing the ASSU Committee on Democracy in Education, which seeks to work for a more just and
democratic university. We meet Monday nights at 6:30 in the ASSU.
Many dorms reps are setting up discussions in the dorms on the Mandate for Change. If you 're interested in participating or
setting up a discussion in your own dorm, please contact your dorm rep or call the COP at 725-/465.
The COP would like to thank the dorm reps for all their imput. Please look for the Dorm Reps Report in the followinq issues
of the ASSU News.
