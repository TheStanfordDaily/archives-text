What are you giving
YOUR COMPUTER
for Christmas?
With an IDEA processor, your com
puter will almost write your book or
theses for you.
Organize
Rite Sort is an IDEA processor for al
most any PC. It organizes your subject
matter, so that you can write each part
of your thesis, book, term paper, what
ever by individual topics that you se
lect. Once you get Rite Sort, you'll never
touch a 3 x 5 card again. Put all of your
research on your computer with your
word processor —in the same format
you now use for index cards—then
sort it out by your outline, not by some
contrived data base key, or word search
that you might have to use on expen
sive data base programs designed for
business use.
Write
Rite Sort will let you spend your time
writing, not sorting index cards. No
body goes to college to be a file clerk.
Besides, Rite Sort is a better file clerk
than you will ever be. Menu driven;
NO codes to learn.
PS: Rite Sort does footnotes—without
interrupting your thoughts with com
puter codes—and bibliographies, too.
Index
And that's not all, RiteDex, another
program for writers, prepares indices
and tables of contents. And it does this
after you have pagination, not while
you are busy writing. Lots of word
processors prepare an index. With
RiteDex, you'll never have to make an
index»on index cards or on your word
processor. Does the table of contents,
too. Menu driven.
