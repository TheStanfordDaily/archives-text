# Growth issue draws Kennedy to Palo Alto
##

In his first personal appearance before the Palo
Alto City Council since 1984, University President
Donald Kennedy spoke Monday at the city council
meeting to allay concerns over the impact of Stan
ford's growth upon the surrounding community.
"The matter of growth is a sustained issue for
us and for the city of Palo Alto," Kennedy said.

"We are doing our best to mitigate
that growth by increasing housing
on campus to minimize traffic."
During his presentation to the city
council, Kennedy projected Stan
ford's population to grow 1 percent
annually for the next 15 to 20 years.
He pointed out that this increase
will mostly be due to growth in the
University's staff.
Council members expressed con-

cern over Kennedy's forecasted growth rate.
Council member Leland Levy disagreed with the
1 percent estimation, saying that it is too low. "We
have the impression that increased activity in traffic
does not amount to merely 1 percent per year," he
said.
However, Kennedy insisted that the population
growth will remain at 1 percent and attributed the
traffic problems to other causes.
"The cost of housing forces our staff to live farther
and farther away from campus," Kennedy said. "[Al
so] outside vendors and contractors are increasing
in numbers at a faster rate than staff or students."
Kennedy said that one way to alleviate the traffic
problems would be to increase on-campus student
and faculty housing. Then tfce commuting from
home to classes would be reduced, he said.
Kennedy cited the Stanford West Project as an
example of on-campus housing expansion. The plans
for Stanford West call for 1 million square feet of
residences northwest of the medical center.
Members of the council expressed concern over
how Stanford would go about providing affordable
housing for faculty.
Council member Larry Klein questioned Kennedy
about the delays over the Stanford West Project,
while Council member Betsy Bechtel charged that
she knew of a member of Stanford faculty who was
prepared to leave Stanford because the cost of living
off campus was too high.
Kennedy said he does not see an acute problem
right now with faculty leaving the University be
cause of high housing costs.
Nevertheless, Kennedy agreed that "the Stanford
West Project has been slower in progress than we'd
like it to be."
Kennedy added that the University is attempting
to make on-campus housing more accessible to stu
dents and faculty in the future.
Along with constructing Stanford West to provide
additional housing for faculty, the University will
offer financial assistance to help staff members with
housing purchases, he said.
