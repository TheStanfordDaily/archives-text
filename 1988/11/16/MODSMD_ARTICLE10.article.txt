# Soviets launch their first space shuttle

MOSCOW (AP) - The Soviets
broke the U.S. monopoly on
reusable spacecraft yesterday by
launching their own space shuttle
on a 30-hour, unmanned orbital
flight that President Mikhail Gor
bachev hailed as a major coup for
his country.
"The space plane has ushered
in a new era in the history of
Soviet space exploration," state
run Radio Moscow declared after
the 100-ton Buran made two or
bits, streaked earthward in a
fireball and landed at a specially
built runaway in Soviet Central
Asia on its maiden mission.
The pilotless flight of the Buran
("snowstorm" in Russian) was a

success for the Soviet space
program after a series of problems
that included the near loss of cos
monauts on a joint Soviet-Afghan
mission in September and loss of
contact with a probe sent to Mars.
The early morning launch of
the Buran fastened to the back
of the 198-foot-tall Energia
booster rocket also ended a seven
year U.S. monopoly on reusable
spacecraft inaugurated by the
launch of the shuttle Columbia in
April 1981.
In Washington, NASA congrat
ulated the Soviets on the mission.
The Buran, as well as other
shuttles still being developed, will
have a central role in the Soviet

space program, the state-run
media said.
"With its help, satellites and
spacecraft will return to Earth
from orbit and crews will be taken
to the orbital complex Mir and
back," Radio Moscow said. It said
the Buran's railway car-sized
cargo bay can house an entire
Salyut space station.
Tass said the Soviet shuttle was
superior to its U.S. counterpart
because of a bigger payload
capacity and its ability to fly au
tomatically. "In the future, this
will allow cosmonauts to pay con
siderably more attention to scien
tific experiments," it said.
The official news agency also

disclosed the shuttle's dimen
sions: Buran, "roughly the same
size as a passenger airliner," is
119 feet long, 180 feet in diameter
and has a wingspan of 79 feet.
Gorbachev was informed of the
flight's success and called it "one
more confirmation of the kind of
huge possibilities the Soviet Un
ion has to solve any problem" and
"a major success for Soviet science
and technology," Tass said.
For years, the Soviets criticized
the U.S. shuttle as wasteful and
unreliable. But Western space spe
cialists say the Soviets began plan
ning their own space plane in
1982 at the latest.
