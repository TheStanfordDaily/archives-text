# Pakistan may have the bomb
## India, Israel, S.Africa also believed to have nuclear weapons 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - There
is "convincing evidence" Pakistan
has finally developed atomic
weapons, leading to the possibility
of a nuclear arms race with its
long-time enemy India, according
to a study published yesterday.
Pakistan has not tested any
atomic weapons and continues to
deny it has built them, a public
stance similar to three other coun
tries which are also believed to
have nuclear weapons, the study
said. The others are India, Israel,
and South Africa.
"Between 1986 and 1988, after
a decade of slow advances, Pakis
tan appears to have become the
fourth country to join this group
of unannounced, de facto nuclear
powers," said the report by the
Carnegie Endowment for Interna
tional Peace.
The review was the fourth such
recent survey published by the
non-profit group, which spe
cializes in national security issues.
It was written by Leonard Spec
tor, author of the previous
reports. Spector formerly worked
on non-proliferation issues at the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission

and the Senate Energy and Nat
ural Resources non-proliferation
subcommittee.
At the State Department,
spokesman Charles Redman said
he had no comment on the find
ings.
Five nations have said they
have nuclear weapons: the United
States, the Soviet Union, China,
Great Britain and France. India
exploded a single atomic device in
1974 but said it was a non
military explosion.
Efforts to halt the spread of
nuclear weapons generally have
focused on the Middle East and
South Asia, the report noted.
Pakistan and India are the chief
source of concern, since the two
countries have fought three wars
in the 41 years since they were
created by the separation of
colonial India from Britain.
The evidence that Pakistan has
the bomb includes production of
highly enriched uranium, a key
component of atomic weapons;
and European reports of a previ
ously clandestine effort by Pakis
tan officials to smuggle sophisti
cated nuclear components out of

West Germany, the report said.
Pakistan may be capable of
producing two to four atomic
weapons, Spector said. "India
responded to this challenge by
continuing the quiet expansion of
its nuclear weapons capabilities
— which far overshadow Pakis
tan's — \yhile maintaining an am
biguous public stance concerning
its nuclear intentions."
A future war between the two
enemies could be devastating, the
report said. "It has been estimated
that a dozen nuclear weapons
used against military targets in
India or Pakistan could cause over
a million casualties."
The Pakistani program is a di
lemma for the United States,
Spector said, noting Pakistan is
a prime recipient of U.S. aid at
the same time U.S. officials are
pushing Pakistan not to develop
atomic weapons.
Two years ago, President
Reagan told Congress that Pakis
tan did not possess nuclear weap
ons, a certification required by
Capitol Hill before the U.S. aid
program could go ahead.
