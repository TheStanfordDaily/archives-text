## TA pay cuts wrong 
### 
University should keep
its priorities straight:
Education is the goal

LAST WEEK'S announcement
to cut teaching assistants'
salaries signals the low pri
ority given to undergraduate edu
cation at Stanford.
In order to compensate for
budgetary mismanagement, the
School of Humanities and Sciences
decided to cut back on TA salaries
and working hours. The conse
quences of this decision will be
keenly felt by most undergradu
ates.
While the emphasis at Stanford
is placed on faculty, TAs are often
more actively involved with stu
dents. TAs in sections give students
the individual attention that pro
fessors in large lecture classes can
not possibly provide. Increasing
section sizes to accomodate as
many as 30-35 students will make
individual attention impossible.
At other universities, such as
Princeton and Harvard, sections
with 20 students or less is the
norm. Sections with 35 students
would be considered huge accord
ing to officials at these schools.
Yet students who are taught by
TAs are not the only ones who will
suffer from the cutbacks in TA
salaries. TAs themselves are al
ready overworked and underpaid.
Cutting their salaries will make a

bad working situation worse.
Last week's decision seems even
more questionable in light of the
findings of the Committee on Ac
ademic Appraisal and Achieve
ment. The committee spent a lot
of time investigating the role of
TAs. They concluded that TAs are
crucial to the quality of undergrad
uate education. TAs make it pos
sible for this University to
accomplish its main goal, which is
to offer peerless undergraduate ed
ucational opportunities.
Yet when cuts had to be made,
TAs, the valuable link between stu
dents and professors, were the first
to go.
Humanities and Sciences Finan
cial Official Nancy Padgett, when
explaining the TA cutback deci
sions, said faculty should be the
main priority when it comes to the
budget. But TAs should not be
sacrificed just because they are not
full-fledged professors.
The Centennial fundraising cam
paign recently surpassed its
projected target of $15 million for
endowed graduate fellowships.
While this achievement should be
applauded, more will be needed to
keep graduate TAs afloat.
It is distressing to see that, even
with the great strides that this
University has made in recent
years, some administrators still do
not have their priorities straight.
When the axe falls and cuts TA
salaries, it cuts at the heart of this
University and at one of the most
vital components of undergraduate
education.
