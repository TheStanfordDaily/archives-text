## University has condoned worker exploitation for years 
### 
MEChA is writing this letter to
the Stanford community to
denounce an outrageous injus
tice that is being committed right here
at Stanford. For those of you who have
never heard of Webb ranch, it is a
piece of Stanford land that lies near
Alpine Road and Highway 280.
On this land, seven families, most of
whom are Mexican immigrants who
were recently granted amnesty, work
under conditions that border on
feudalism. Up to 15 workers are
brought in to Stanford to do grounds
keeping work and other tasks in addi
tion to the work they perform on the
ranch.
These workers work as many as 10
hours a day, seven days a week with
little overtime pay, no sickleave, no
vacations and no pensions. If they get

sick, they have no health insurance
and do not get paid for days lost.
Some of them have been here for as
many as 25 years and are still making
$4.25 an hour, out of which up to one
dollar for every hour worked is
deducted to pay for lodgings.
This is the same kind of super
exploitation of immigrant workers for
which Leland Stanford himself earned
the reputation of being the "robber
baron" of the transpacific railroad.
Why has Stanford allowed this situa
tion to continue? The fact that Webb
ranch is on Stanford land and that
these workers are being brought in to
Stanford to do work that used to be
done by unionized workers raises
serious questions as to the University's
commitment to even the most basic

ethic and moral principles.
The recent incidents at Ujamaa have
made evident for everyone what minor
ity students here have always known:
not even at Stanford can we escape
racism. When these incidents occur, the
administration repeats the usual litany
of expressions of shock and dismay.
However, when it comes to the
workers, the University is reluctant to
even admit that racism exists and even
more reluctant to do anything about it.
The fact that a situation such as
that which exists at Webb ranch is
tolerated by the University, given that
most of the workers are Chicano and
Mexican, sends a very clear message to
us that the University does not really
have a commitment to ending racism
and discrimination in all its forms.

University President Donald Ken
nedy's proclamation that "Bigotry is
Out" is nothing more than a hollow
sounding phrase as long as he allows
Chicano and Mexicano workers at
Stanford to be treated no better than
serfs.
MEChA has stood by the USW in its
struggle for a just contract because we
understand that issues of workers and
issues of oppressed minorities in this
country are intimately linked. Neither
one can be resolved without the other.
If the University is serious about
addressing the issue of racism on this
campus, we demand that something be
done immediately to change the un
bearable working conditions of the
workers at Webb ranch.
