# Conservative student publication clings to narrow view of CIV
## 
### 
Several contributors to the recently
distributed issue of The Stanford
Review, have attacked the creation of
the Cultures, Ideas, and Values re
quirement based on "blatantly left-wing
political reasons."
Iwan and Book in their "CIV in
volves destruction and deconstruction
of the West" refer to the revolutionary
activism, for example, emphasized in
newly-included readings, while New
mann, in an "Opinions" article, asserts
that the CIV debate and related events
explain Stanford's drop to sixth among
the nation's top universities in U.S.
News and World Report annual survey.
Both articles reveal a narrow under
standing of the motivations underlying

CIV and of its long-term significance
both within and beyond this university.
Iwan and Book begin with an attack
on the "minor writers" included in the
new CIV track, writers like Frantz
Fanon, author of The Wretched of the
Earth.
This well-known analysis of racial
and class oppression in the Third
World is given no more consideration
than its cover jacket blurb which,
among other things, calls it a "hand
book of revolutionary practice and so
cial reorganization."
First of all, it would be difficult to
find one of the established or new
readings that does not include some
value-based assumption about the ideal
ordering of society and how this order
ing should be accomplished.
Secondly, instead of questioning in
structors of the CIV track about
reasons for including Fanon's work
and about the method of in-class anal
ysis used, Iwan and Book react with

what seems an unfortunate hysteria
over "Radical" manifestos which chal
lenge the standard American outlook.
We are accustomed to being told that
the only road open is revolution or
transformation toward a more socially
just order, but we are ourselves con
founded, for example, by the growing
problem of homelessness.
We're desperately in need of better
answers to this problem, and such
answers are difficult to find in The
Iliad or The Republic, noteworthy as
these works may be. Perhaps if Aris
totle and Plato had treated questions
of social justice and social transforma
tion in a manner we could more easily
relate to our contemporary reality, it
wouldn't be as critical to include
Fanon, Cinerros, Hurston and others
who are important minority voices and
not minor writers.
The Review writers miss the point
entirely. We need not hold (though it
may be argued) that Fanon be re-

garded as the "equal" of Plato, Augus
tine or other "great Western Think
ers." But in a rapidly changing world,
we must recognize that our perspec
tives on the root causes of racial, class
and gender tensions flaring on this
campus and around the globe.
This said, I don't know enough
about the current handling of the CIV
track to disprove assertions of bias in
material or teaching, but Iwan and
Book have used irresponsible research
and a narrow presentation.
CIV, imperfections notwithstanding,
is best seen as an experiment, and an
extremely significant one, which must
be developed through thoughtful
criticism by all members of this com
munity. I hope and believe that "con
servatives" and "liberals" alike, can
find less accusatory, more constructive
ways to communicate in the cause of
such development.
