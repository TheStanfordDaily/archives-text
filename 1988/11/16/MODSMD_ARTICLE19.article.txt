## Is my soul a wet burrito? 
### 
IT BEGAN as a dream, one where I
was aware that I was indeed dream
ing. In that dream, I was sitting in
some nebulous space, when I asked to
see a vision of my innermost being. Two
imbricated pyramids appeared. Then, I
said to myself, it is good to see what my
innermost being looks like, but it is not
yet enough. I must must now become
one with that pyramid. But when I tried
to achieve this, I felt as if my brain was
exploding with light, and then I woke up."
So says Alexandro Jodorowsky, creator
of the bizarre seventies cult classics El
Topo and Holy Mountain seen every year
at our own Tuesday Films.
But other than this obviously different
person, who really has such dreams? I
can't help but think that if I ever asked
in my dream to see a vision of my in
nermost self, I would be presented with
something decrepit like a crinkled-up can
of Bud. Or at least something wholly
unprofound and senseless like a big soggy
burrito.
This isn't to say that dreams can't be
self-revelatory. A lot of late night discus
sions with friends seem eventually to
gravitate around dreams and dreaming.
People are always willing to divulge their
most interesting and bizarre nighttime
flights of fancy. And why are they so
eager? Because they think that their
dreams are in fact self-revelatory, that
they reflect their waking personalities.
Thus, the more rich and complex and
multi-dimensional the dream is, the more
interesting the dreamer.
Naturally, this belief makes the discus
sion a little competitive. Discussions tend

My parents and my sister
had all turned into vam
pires and were chasing
me. Oh, that's pretty hairy,
but listen to this...

to get that way when people are talking
about themselves, especially through
such a a subtle medium. It's not that
people start "thinking up" better dreams,
they just start digging into their dream
histories a lot deeper, just to find that
one outrageous and lush dream that will
show once and for all their natural orig
inality.
Illustration of the point. The topic this
one evening was nightmares. I offered
one that I remembered from when I was
about ten years old. In it, my parents
and my sister had all turned into vam
pires and were chasing me. Not very
original, but at the time pretty scary.
Needless to say, this opener brought com
ments of "Oh, that's pretty hairy, but
listen to this. . Then came the dreams
of intense horror and evil symbolism, each
one more vivid than the last. I felt very
feeble with my simple little dream. And
there was nothing I could come up with
that could match the "Poe"-ian tales
being told.
In search of more impressive dreams,
I came across a copy of Stephen Laßerge's
book on lucid dreaming (controlling your
own dreams). To humble dreamers like

myself, this was a boon. Instead of my
usually simple and short dreams reflect
ing an impoverished mind, I could make
ap some really cool dreams to show off
my keen imagination. So I tried the meth
od, which, in simplified form, consists of
telling yourself you're going to lucid
dream while you are falling asleep. Not
much success, I'm afraid. And believe
me, I tried.
Maybe it was all for the good, though.
If my dreams can hold my attention
enough when I'm sleeping, that's proba
bly all I should ask for. After all, dreams
are a fun little escapist experience. I
shouldn't try to overanalyze, rationalize,
control or in any other way demystify
them because projecting my unconscious
onto my conscious may well reveal some
things I don't care to know. My uncon
scious is well enough without me, thank
you very much. I should just leave my
dreams in bed.
Besides, if I could actually orchestrate
my dreams, I might become too obsessed
with them, constantly planning out my
next night's adventure. Eventually I
might come to the point, as Jodorowsky
did, where I would ask to see my soul.
And, in all honesty, I really don't want
to face that burrito any time soon.
