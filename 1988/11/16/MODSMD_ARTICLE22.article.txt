## Finding rewards beyond the thrill of the paycheck Willing students trade private gain for public service 
### Susan Infantino 
In the mists beyond graduation lie in
distinct images of business suits and
briefcases, or medical texts and grad
school libraries. Yet with persistent
straining of the eyeballs, one can discern
other images — Dept. of Commerce seals,
AIDS centers and Peace Corps volunteers
— images of jobs in public service.
Interest in public service is on the rise
at Stanford as more students elude the
business suits and make the executive
decision to seek employment in public
service.
Participation in the public service sec
tor has increased dramatically from last
year to this year alone. In 1987-88, for
example, the Peace Corps received a total
of 47 applications from graduating Stan
ford students. This year the organization
has already received 89.
Anne Greenblatt, public and commu
nity service career specialist at the Career
Planning and Placement Center, is aware
of Stanford's rising need for information
about public service careers.

"We definitely have public service
recruitment and we're definitely looking
to expand it. . .. We are approaching a
much wider range of organizations for
on-campus recruitment, particularly
focusing on non-profit organizations and
local government."
Jobs in the public service sector, ac
cording to Greenblatt, are divided into
two main categories: public and non
profit.
The non-profit organizations are
privately operated. Health, human serv
ice, environmental and political organiza
tions are all represented in the non-profit
sector. For example, Planned Parenthood
and the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion are two non-profit organizations.
The "public sector" is comprised of
government organizations, 90 percent of
which fall under the authority of the
executive branch, such as the IRS, the
Dept. of Commerce and the Environmen
tal Protection Agency.
A government agency more likely to
conjure up images of public service than
the IRS is the Peace Corps. According

to Libby Blackwell, a recruitment spe
cialist with the San Francisco Peace
Corps office, "The Peace Corps has al
ways gotten a lot of support from this
campus, and we have had an increased
amount of interest this year. . . . Stanford
students are highly qualified. It's easy to
place them."
Many students opt for Peace Corps or
non-profit work after Stanford as a
prelude to graduate school or work in
private industry. It's a common stepping
stone on the way to graduate school,
Blackwell said.
Working for the Peace Corps provides
valuable experience that companies view
as a highly respectable pre-career foun
dation, Blackwell added.
Non-profit organizations provide valu
able experience as well but also offer
career possibilities. Although the salaries
of individuals working in the non-profit
sector is 25 percent lower than those
received in the corporate world, according
to CPPC resources, many graduates con
sider the non-monetary benefits enough
compensation for the difference in pay.
Rosemarie Day, a 1988 Stanford grad
uate, presently works as administrative
assistant at the Mid-Peninsula YWCA in
Palo Alto. "I can't stress enough that
there are definite non-monetary
rewards," she said. "You're working for
something you believe in. As a result, I
feel happy every day. I'm working for a
greater good."
Day was very involved in public service
as a Stanford undergraduate and spent
last summer working with State Sen.
Becky Morgan. The lack of grassroots
understanding among policy makers, said
Day, influenced her decision to work for
a non-profit organization before pursuing
graduate school and a possible political
career.
"I felt like many of the people there
in the state political office hadn't had
enough experience outside of the
capitol. ... If I want to get into that work

The Peace Corps has al
ready received 42 applica
tions more than last year
from Stanford seniors.

I want some experience with the people
that are affected by my decisions in of
fice," Day explained.
In order to help students find public
service employment, the CPPC sponsors
two main events for public service recruit
ment on campus. Every fall the center
holds the Career Faire in White Plaza,
where students can speak to different or
ganization representatives.
This fall 32 public service organiza
tions, 25 percent of the represented
groups, attended — the largest turnout
ever.
In addition, the CPPC sponsored the
first annual public service career faire
last spring.

The second form of on-campus recruit
ment is for employers to hold interviews
and information sessions. Last year 25
government and eight non-profit recruit
ers visited Stanford.
Other resources available for students
are Odyssey, the computerized database
containing information on over 500 paid
and unpaid internships, both profit and
non-profit, and the Clearinghouse at
Owen House Public Service Center.
The Clearinghouse is primarily geared
towards information for undergraduate
volunteer work, but Sue Gray, Clearing
house Coordinator, encouraged students
to drop by with questions. "We're good
resource people with lots of contacts."
Yet in spite of the wealth of informa
tion and contacts available on campus,
the student must continue "a self-directed
job search," Greenblatt said. In the public
service sector, where most organizations
are small, not necessarily based in Cali
fornia, and without the capabilities to
actively recruit here, the students must
take the initiative and conquer the mists
obscuring life after Stanford.
