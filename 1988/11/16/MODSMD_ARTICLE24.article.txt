Carlson meets Mickey
The Miss America watch continues this week
as Stanford's own Gretchen Carlson visited the
"State Fair at Disneyland" as part of her year
long duties.
Said Carlson, who is stopped out from Stan
ford while she reigns, "Usually I have to be
serious from 9 to 5. This is the first day I've
been able to just have fun all day."
Rumors to the effect that Carlson will make
the ceremonial first sack in Saturday's Big
Game are greatly exaggerated, but stay tuned
for more of the continuing adventures of
"Gretchen Carlson: Miss America and Part-Time
Stanford Student."
Don't dog that dog
There are still individual tickets available for
"Gaieties '88: Follow That Dog." You can pick
yours up in White Plaza between noon and 1
p.m. at the Ram's Head booth. Cost is a mere
six bucks.
Don't miss "Follow That Dog," which plays
tomorrow night, Friday afternoon, and Friday
evening. It's the best Big Game Week activity
that doesn't involve things being burned,
tackled or impaled on The Claw.
