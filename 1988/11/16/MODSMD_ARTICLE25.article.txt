## The
						band to end all bands

Don't read this review. Just put down
the paper and run to the nearest record
store. Because every second spent reading
— or doing anything else, for that matter
— is time you could be listening to "Vol.
1," the astonishingly brilliant debut album
by the Traveling Wilburys.
Who? That's right, the Traveling Wil
burys. As the fictional liner notes for
their album read, they are a tiny remnant
of "a sophisticated musical culture" which
developed independently of managers,
finding themselves "of interest to tour
operators and recording executives."
But in the real world, they're a super
group boasting five of today's brightest
musical stars: Bob Dylan, George Har
rison, Jeff Lynne (of E.L.0.), Tom Petty
and Roy Orbison.
According to Rolling Stone, the whole
thing started when Petty, Orbison and
Lynne agreed to help Harrison with a
final track for a European EP he had
mentioned over dinner one night. George
suggested they visit Bob — who turned
out to be Bob Dylan — and do some
recording. Thrilled with the first single,
"Handle With Care," they shifted to Dave
(Eurythmics) Stewart's recording studio
and completed "Vol. 1."
And what they completed is a master
piece. "Vol. 1" is a tour de force of each
member's talents, and the whole is far
more than the sum of the five already
impressive parts.
A unique country/rock flavor permeates
the album; nothing but guitars, drums
and occasional horns are to be heard. And
with five rhythm guitars going at once,
you can guesstimate the type of sound to
expect. From the casual chords of the
opener, "Handle With Care," to the rock
abilly bounce of the Bo Diddley-sung
"Rattled," relentless excitement abounds.
The brilliance of each Wilbury shines
on "Vol. 1." In "Heading For the Light,"
Harrison pleasantly echoes his solo "AJI
Those Years Ago" without committing
musical plagiarism.
Likewise, Dylan's gravel-and-dust bal
lad "Tweeter And the Monkey Man" nar
rates the misery of a Vietnam vet turned
drug dealer much in the tone of "I and
I." And hear for yourself if the opening
riff from "End of the Line" doesn't sound
alarmingly like the Beatles' "I'm Looking
Through You."
Yet the Wilburys' album is as much a
salute to their peers as a celebration of
their own talents. Aerosmith's "Dream
On" shows up both literally and themati
cally in "Handle With Care." Tom Petty
alludes to Jimi Hendrix's guitar master
work in "End of the Line," and "Tweeter
and the Monkey Man" likens itself to the

Bearing an eerie resemblance to Tom Petty both in face and voice, Charlie
T. Wilbury, Jr. sets the house afire as one of the "Traveling Wilburys."
Charlie T., Jr. and the rest of the Wilbury clan have come up with one of
the finest albums of the year.
