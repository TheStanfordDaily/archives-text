# Blood, guts and dolls
## 
### Alex Kostich 
In the wake of the Halloween
season two new films have been
released in the hope of cashing in
on scares. One fails — the other
delivers the goods.
Tom Holland's "Child's Play"
is another slasher film, except in
stead of a Jason or a Freddy we
get a possessed Cabbage-Patch
like doll (the invincible killer is
now inanimate as well!).
The implausibility posed by the
script would have been easier to
swallow if the movie didn't take
itself so seriously; unfortunately,
Holland is solely aiming for
screams.
The film opens with a detective
shooting at a maniacal killer who
has taken refuge in a toy store.
As the murderer is shot through
the heart, he utters a voodoo spell
and his soul is transferred to the
nearest object — a three-foot tall
"Chucky" doll.
The plot really gets going when
a mother buys the possessed toy
for her cute little son, and
"Chucky" begins to talk (sans bat
teries). What follows are the oblig
atory murders and the final
showdown between "Chucky" and
the detective (played flatly by
Chris Sarandon).
John Carpenter's "They Live"
has the sense of humor which
"Child's Play" so desperately
needs. The story takes place in

the near future when aliens have
discreetly invaded earth and inte
grated themselves into society.
The creatures lock like normal
human beings unless you put on
a special pair of sunglasses; the
shades reveal aliens that resemble
Norman Bates' mom.
Some human scientists have
found out about the invasion and
they create hundreds of "alien
spotters" for the unknowing
public. Unfortunately, the
monsters find out and destroy all
but a few of the Ray-Bans.
In comes "Rowdy" Roddy Piper,
who made a name for himself in
professional wrestling. He finds a
stray pair of shades and decides
he wants to save the planet after
he sees who is visiting. In one of
the best lines in recent cinema
history, he growls, "I'm here to
chew bubble gum and kick ass . . .
and I'm all outta bubble gum."
Whoa! This man means busi
ness! In any case, what follows is
standard B-movie mayhem with
enough artillery to make Rambo
blush. Carpenter is smart enough
to avoid real drama and opts for
a witty script instead. Piper,
whose acting range rivals that of
a Kiwi fruit, is perfect in his role
as the thick construction worker.
Carpenter has intentionally
made a B-movie and his sense of
humor is heightened by the laugh
able effects.
