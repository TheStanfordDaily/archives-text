Check out the knees and elbows of the Stanford
men's basketball team. They show the floor burns
of a contender.
Led by Adam "Darth Vader" Keefe, the No. 20
Cardinal came out tumbling and diving last night
before 3,800 at Maples Pavilion and rolled right
over the Czechoslovakian National team in an ex
hibition game, 107-71.

Keefe, wearing a plexiglass mask-hybrid of some
unknown genus to protect a broken nose suffered
in practice two weeks ago, highlighted the rousing
floor gymnastics with his head-first dive into some
offcourt tables to save a ball from going out of
bounds. But there was hardly any Cardinal player
that didn't get into the act.
"I was really pleased with the hustle," Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said. "If we can maintain
that enthusiasm, that's gonna go a long long way
for us. I told the kids that we were on the floor
more (tonight) than in the past two years.
If you needed a quick fix of Stanford's bang-'em
up hustle last night, you could have gotten it during
a 70-second sequence by the star of the game, senior
center Eric Reveno.
With 17:32 left in the second half and Stanford
leading 66-51, Reveno turned for a quick jump hook
to give him two of his game-high 26 points (on
11-of-13 shooting).
Seconds later, Reveno stole the ball at the top of
the key and went downcourt for a lay in. Then, he
blocked a shot. And finally, he made a perfect touch
pass to senior Howard Wright coming down the
lane, who got the shot and the foul for a three-point
play and a 73-51 Stanford lead.
"I was having fun," Reveno said. "I remember
that sequence; that was just a good time."
Reveno continues to give new meaning to the
phrase, "pleasant surprise." Before this season
began, he was a promising player who was a question
mark after missing 1987-88 due to a back injury.
Now .. . next question please.
"I'm 22 (years old) now vs. 20," Reveno said.
"The maturity that comes with that and some hard
work I've put in has helped."
Reveno says he's not afraid to go up against any
center in the nation, and is disappointed that he
won't get a chance opposite North Carolina's J.R.
Reid Nov. 28. Reid is currently sidelined after having
had foot surgery.
"I don't want to say I'd rather lose . .Reveno
said, framing his words carefully. "I would rather
have the opportunity to compete against J.R. Reid
than have a shoo-in win against North Carolina
without him.
"I also wanted to play against a guy (Reid) on
the Olympic team, a big butt and a great player."
Senior guard Todd Lichti had 18 points in just
22 minutes of action and Wright added eight
rebounds to lead the Cardinal in a game in which
it was never really challenged. Stanford out
rebounded the Czechs 47-30 and had only six turn
overs to Czechoslovakia's 21.
In the first half, the Czechs stayed close thanks
largely to some nifty three-point shooting. Five dif
ferent players hit from downtown in the first half
for Czechoslovakia, who were only down 37-34 with
7:14 to go.
But Stanford opened up the game for good with
an 11-2 run over the next 3:14, capped by a long
jump hook from Reveno. Stanford later closed out
the half with an 8-1 skein to lead, 58-41.
Reveno's additional 70 seconds of glory boosted
Stanford's lead above 20 for the first time, and

Center Eric Reverto goes up for a shot. The senior crashed the boards and lit up
the scoreboard last night with a total of eight rebounds and 26 total points on
11-for-13 shooting.
