# Webb Ranch labor practices draw fire
## 
### Robert Landon Staff writer 
Representatives of MEChA, a Chicano
student organization, and the United Stan
ford Workers have charged the University
with allowing and perpetuating feudalistic
labor practices on campus.
USW Field Representative Rodney Bar
nette told The Daily yesterday that agricul
tural laborers at Webb Ranch are presently
paid minimum wage and receive no sick
pay, no pension plan, no vacation pay and
no health insurance, even though some
have worked at Stanford for more than 20
years.
Webb Ranch is a 250-acre horse and
vegetable farm in the west part of campus
off Alpine Road. The Webb family has
leased the farm from the University for
over 60 years.
Webb Ranch contracts out labor to the
University at a rate of $8.50 an hour per
worker. Of every $8.50 it receives, Webb
Ranch gives its workers half.
Linda Crouse, chief steward of the USW,
called Stanford's relationship with Webb
Ranch "scandalous and immoral. Stanford
is actually profiting from this exploitation
by taking advantage of cheap labor."
Thomas Hubbard, a manager at the
ranch, confirmed these charges. However,
he denied that any of the ranch's practices
are illegal.
"Our books are open to both state and
federal officials every year," Hubbard said.
The Department of Athletics employs as
many as 15 of these laborers to maintain
athletic facilities, Hubbard said.

Webb Ranch contracts out
labor to the University at a

Most of the workers are Spanish
speaking immigrants from Mexico. They
were all granted "legal alien" status by the
amnesty clause of the Immigration Reform
and Control Act of 1986.
In 1982, Crouse, then a University main
tenance worker, worked with a Webb Ranch
gardener who "received much less pay [than
USW members], had no rights and had to
do exactly as he was told if he did not
want to be fired."
Herb Fong, a manager at the Department
of Operations and Maintenance, said his
department stopped using Webb Ranch
workers in 1985 because "we felt it was
not in the spirit of the contract with the
USW."
There is no single University policy about
contracted labor on campus, although it
was a issue in the recent labor ne
gotiations between USW and the Univer
sity, according to Crouse.
"Here is a concrete example of the kind
of problems that arise when the University
is allowed to contract out work," Crouse
said.
