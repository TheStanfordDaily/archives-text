# Stanford skippers leave others behind in Redwood City regatta
## 
### Hugh R. Bethell Staff writer 
On a weekend that featured
a bit of nearly every weather
condition, the members of the
Stanford sailing team proved
that even Mother Nature
couldn't stop them, as they won
their own Stanford Invitational
Regatta at Redwood City by a
margin of over 60 points.
Finishing in first for the Car
dinal were senior Bill
Shoemaker and junior Paula
Gani, who sailed to first place
in the "A" Division. Junior
Robert Brown and sophomore
Heidi Park contributed with a
win in the "B" Division.
Behind Stanford in the final
standings was the top boat from
California, which edged out
Stanford's second boat by one
point. UC-Santa Cruz took
fourth place, and another entry
from Cal ended up in fifth.
All of the 17 boats that com
peted at the regatta found the
weather one of the toughest ob
stacles to high performance on
the waters of Redwood Creek.
Light rain and shifting zephyrs
on Saturday gave way to storm
winds on Sundav morning,
which peaked at over 25 m.p.h.
and left many of the competitors
bobbing in the water next to
their overturned boats.

'We have sailors out there that are
constantly rising above new plateaus.'
â€” Blake Middleton

By noon on Sunday, however,
the storm had crossed the Bay
and was replaced- by sunshine
and a dead calm. The race com
mittee then had to wait several
hours for a sufficiently strong
and consistent breeze in which
to finish the regatta's last three
races.
Thrbugh all of nature's trials,
however, the Stanford team con
sistently finished at the front of
the pack. While regattas like the
Invitational are often decided by
just a few points, the runner-up
behind this year's winning boat
was 64 points back.
Indeed, Stanford boats won
16 of the 22 races held, even
though the event attracted
strong entries from as far away
as San Diego. While some at
tributed the dominance to local
knowledge, Stanford Coach
Blake Middleton credited his
team's ever increasing level of
performance.
"We have sailors out there
that are constantly rising above
new plateaus," Middleton said.
An unusual highlight of the

regatta was Saturday's dedica
tion ceremony at which Stan
ford's new fleet of Flying Junior
sailboats was christened. At a
lunch hosted by the Stanford
team for competitors and
guests, Sailing Director Joe
Petrucci thanked the many gen
erous donors who made possible
the purchase of the team's new
fleet and the continued opera
tion of the sailing team.
Because the sailing team is a
varsity-two sport, it must raise
all of its operating and improve
ment budget from alumni ap
peals and other fundraising ef
forts.
This weekend's win at home
follows several recent strong
performances that should boost
the Cardinal's national ranking
from No. 16 up into the top ten.
Critical to that move, however,
will be the team's success at the
upcoming sloop nationals, to be
held this coming weekend at
Santa Cruz. As the regatta's lo
cal favorites, Stanford has a shot
at earning its first-ever national
title.
