# Linksters take 10th at Olympic

### Eugene Sakai Staff writer 
Going into yesterday's final
round of play with 20 strokes be
tween them and the pacesetters,
the Stanford men's golf team was
unable to make up any ground
and finished a disappointing 10th
in the USF Invitational at the
Olympic Golf Course.
With a team total of 941, the
Cardinal golfers ended up 35
strokes behind the victorious
Washington team, who also had
the individual winner in Todd
Tibke.
Stanford was led by junior Josh
Zander and freshman Christian
Cevaer, who matched each other's
scores round-for-round over the
two-day tourney, firing 77-75-77.
Their total of 229 was a mere six
strokes behind the Tibke's win
ning total.
"Christian and Josh played
some really good golf on that
course," said Coach Wally Good
win. "With the course in the con
dition that it was in, par was ac
tually about 75 Vi."
The high scores carded by Mark
Funseth, Don Christensen, and
Brad Geer reflect the difficulty
that many golfers had at the San
Francisco tournament. Juniors
Christensen and Funseth shot 240
and 246, respectively. Geer, a
senior, struggled home with a
three-round total of 250.

"Funseth and Geer play the big
game," Goodwin said, referring to
their long-hitting style. "If they
are just a little bit off, they have
big problems."
Goodwin then drew from an
elementary analogy of classical
physics. "If you swing the club as
hard as they do, if you are just
a little bit off, the farther the ball
will go astray when it lands."
Despite his relatively high total,
Don Christensen impressed the
coach with the fact that he im

proved from round to round.
"I'm really pleased with Don's
performance," said Goodwin, add
ing that Christensen, along with
teammates Cevaer and Zander,
would be exempt from the quali
fying playoff for the team's next
tournament in Las Vegas.
"(Don) was only three over par
going into the 16th today, which
is a long, tough par five," Good
win said. "He double-bogeyed it,
which sort of ruined an otherwise
great round."
