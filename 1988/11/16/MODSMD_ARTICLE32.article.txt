# Big Game is worth trip to Weenieland
## 
### 
Be there.
This Saturday at
Memorial Stadium in
Berkeley, the Stanford Cardi
nal and the California Golden
Bears will renew their rivalry
for the 91st time in Big Game.
True, most of the country
could care less. UCLA and USC
are battling for a Rose Bowl
berth 400 miles to the south.
Perennial powerhouses Okla
homa and Nebraska have a
showdown in Norman, Okla.
Those games mean far more
than Big Game — this year
and almost every other.
But to fans at Stanford and
Cal this game means every
thing.
It's the time of year where
the Bay Area faithful take off
their kid gloves, put down their
white wine and brie and scream
their bloody heads off.
Even though both teams
have been out of the
hunt in the Pacific 10
Conference for some time, and
dreams of bowl bids are a dis
tant memory, a Big Game win
can go a long ways toward was
hing the salt out of the wounds
and making the long winter
seem shorter.
For Stanford, downing the
Bears could ease the pain of
all the should'ves, could'ves
and would'ves of this what
might-have-beon year.
For Cal ...
Actually, I don't care what
Cal thinks. I just hope
we knock the bloody
stuffing out of 'em.
For those of you who aren't
yet caught up in the hoopla,
some recommendations to
make you angry:
See The Play: The multiple
lateral, unbelievably-illegal,
kickoff-return-for-touchdown
fiasco from the 1982 Big Game
is a must-see for all Stanford
fanatics.
You can rent a copy from
Res Ed or Tower Records or
someone. Buy 20 pounds of
gummi bears then bend, fold,
spindle and mutilate them as
you watch the dirtiest Golden
Bears of all time steal the Axe
and a winning season from
John Elway and Co. in the
great quarterback's final
season on The Farm.
This alone should get your
blood boiling. But if you
need more help....
Go to Gaieties: This tradi
tional musical revue/satirical
spoof always has its share of
hysterical moments.
Granted, the humor is incon
sistent. But with its non-stop
jabs at the wholly inferior uni
versity somewhat north and
east of here should give you a
newfound distaste for the Uni-

versity of California's flagship
campus. .
Drop by the Bonfire: Alright,
if you've been there before it's
a little bit dull. Same stories
about the Axe and, yes, if
you've seen one fire ...

California has escaped
with the Axe but once
in my tenure here. That
was two years ago in the great
Gator Bowl season. John Paye
was like a gladiator as he tried
to rally the Cardinal with the
little that was left of his right
shoulder.
The year before, Stanford
took a huge 24-0 lead only to
squander most of it away.
Ironically, a kicker named
Leland missed a chip-shot field
goal to preserve the win.
Twelve months ago, the
Golden Bears looked like a
bunch of high schoolers in com
parison to the mighty Cardinal.
The 31-7 massacre provided a
delightful finale to a strong
season finish for Stanford.
Almost has been the
operative word for the
Cardinal this year. Al
most beat USC. Almost beat
Oregon State. Almost beat
UCLA.
Despite the disappointments,
the team has shown incredible
poise and maturity in coming
out every week and playing
hard.
The critics may find many
faults with this year's team but
as Coach Jack Elway said, "We
keep coming back from tough
losses and playing hard.
"We have out limitations in
some areas, but there's no lim
itation on effort."
Leave your objectivity be
hind and head for
Berkeley by car, bus or
BART Saturday.
Some fine football players
are playing their last game in
cardinal and white and would
no doubt appreciate your sup
port.
Enjoy the one day a year
where the Bay Area feels likes
the Football Capital of the Uni
verse and watch Stanford blow
Cal off the gridiron.

seem shorter.
For Stanford, downing the
Bears could ease the pain of
all the should'ves, could'ves
and would'ves of this what
might-have-beon year.
For Cal ...
Actually, I don't care what
Cal thinks. I just hope
we knock the bloody
stuffing out of 'em.
For those of you who aren't
yet caught up in the hoopla,
some recommendations to
make you angry:
See The Play: The multiple
lateral, unbelievably-illegal,
kickoff-return-for-touchdown
fiasco from the 1982 Big Game
is a must-see for all Stanford
fanatics.
You can rent a copy from
Res Ed or Tower Records or
someone. Buy 20 pounds of
gummi bears then bend, fold,
spindle and mutilate them as
you watch the dirtiest Golden
Bears of all time steal the Axe
and a winning season from
John Elway and Co. in the
great quarterback's final
season on The Farm.
This alone should get your
blood boiling. But if you
need more help....
Go to Gaieties: This tradi
tional musical revue/satirical
spoof always has its share of
hysterical moments.
Granted, the humor is incon
sistent. But with its non-stop
jabs at the wholly inferior uni
versity somewhat north and
east of here should give you a
newfound distaste for the Uni-

versity of California's flagship
campus. .
Drop by the Bonfire: Alright,
if you've been there before it's
a little bit dull. Same stories
about the Axe and, yes, if
you've seen one fire ...

California has escaped
with the Axe but once
in my tenure here. That
was two years ago in the great
Gator Bowl season. John Paye
was like a gladiator as he tried
to rally the Cardinal with the
little that was left of his right
shoulder.
The year before, Stanford
took a huge 24-0 lead only to
squander most of it away.
Ironically, a kicker named
Leland missed a chip-shot field
goal to preserve the win.
Twelve months ago, the
Golden Bears looked like a
bunch of high schoolers in com
parison to the mighty Cardinal.
The 31-7 massacre provided a
delightful finale to a strong
season finish for Stanford.
Almost has been the
operative word for the
Cardinal this year. Al
most beat USC. Almost beat
Oregon State. Almost beat
UCLA.
Despite the disappointments,
the team has shown incredible
poise and maturity in coming
out every week and playing
hard.
The critics may find many
faults with this year's team but
as Coach Jack Elway said, "We
keep coming back from tough
losses and playing hard.
"We have out limitations in
some areas, but there's no lim
itation on effort."
Leave your objectivity be
hind and head for
Berkeley by car, bus or
BART Saturday.
Some fine football players
are playing their last game in
cardinal and white and would
no doubt appreciate your sup
port.
Enjoy the one day a year
where the Bay Area feels likes
the Football Capital of the Uni
verse and watch Stanford blow
Cal off the gridiron.
