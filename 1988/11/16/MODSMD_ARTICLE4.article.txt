# Survey says: Stanford not anti-intellectual

Does Stanford really have a non
intellectual atmosphere?
The majority of last year's seniors
disagreed with that notion in the 1987-
88 Senior Survey, the results of which
were released to The Daily over the
weekend.
In addition to answering "yes" or
"no," many seniors also responded
with comments.
"If it were any more intellectual, I
wouldn't be able to breathe," said one
senior among the 63 percent who an
swered "no" to the question.
"If you want it, you can find it,"

many seniors commented.
However, other seniors disagreed.
"It's not 'cool' to talk about ideas
and learning in social situations.
Everyone looks at you as if you were
trying to talk about depression or
gloom or something," one senior said.
"Everyone would rather be a ditz
than risk an opinion," said another.
Moreover, a sizable portion of those
who agreed that Stanford has a non
intellectual atmosphere were quick to
say they like it that way.
"This is good so that the stress level
does not become unbearable as at some
schools back East," a senior said.
Surveys were completed by 38 per
cent of the seniors (635 out of 1,648)

who graduated in winter or were can
didates for graduation last spring. The
total was up from last year's 31 percent
response rate, including a rise in re
sponses from minority students on
campus.
As in past years, three-fourths of
the respondents came from middle
and upper-class families.
One senior said "many of us end up
living above our means" at Stanford
in order to keep up with more well-off
friends.
Financial and work constraints have
limited the participation of one-third
of the respondents in activities includ
ing overseas study, volunteer service,
dorm outings and membership in fra

ternities and sororities, according to
the survey.
"I hashed for three years and was
always working through the popular
dinner-hour dorm programming," a
senior said.
"If I didn't need the money I
would've loved to have been more in
volved in my studies (honors work)
and professors," said another.
Loan debts affected the post
graduation plans of 39 percent of the
respondents.
"I plan to work for two years so I
can stabilize my debts," wrote one
senior.
