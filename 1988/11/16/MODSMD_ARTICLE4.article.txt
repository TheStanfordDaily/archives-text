# Survey says: Stanford not anti-intellectual
## 
### Elaine Riggs Staff writer 
Does Stanford really have a non
intellectual atmosphere?
The majority of last year's seniors
disagreed with that notion in the 1987-
88 Senior Survey, the results of which
were released to The Daily over the
weekend.
In addition to answering "yes" or
"no," many seniors also responded
with comments.
"If it were any more intellectual, I
wouldn't be able to breathe," said one
senior among the 63 percent who an
swered "no" to the question.
"If you want it, you can find it,"

many seniors commented.
However, other seniors disagreed.
"It's not 'cool' to talk about ideas
and learning in social situations.
Everyone looks at you as if you were
trying to talk about depression or
gloom or something," one senior said.
"Everyone would rather be a ditz
than risk an opinion," said another.
Moreover, a sizable portion of those
who agreed that Stanford has a non
intellectual atmosphere were quick to
say they like it that way.
"This is good so that the stress level
does not become unbearable as at some
schools back East," a senior said.
Surveys were completed by 38 per
cent of the seniors (635 out of 1,648)

who graduated in winter or were can
didates for graduation last spring. The
total was up from last year's 31 percent
response rate, including a rise in re
sponses from minority students on
campus.
As in past years, three-fourths of
the respondents came from middle
and upper-class families.
One senior said "many of us end up
living above our means" at Stanford
in order to keep up with more well-off
friends.
Financial and work constraints have
limited the participation of one-third
of the respondents in activities includ
ing overseas study, volunteer service,
dorm outings and membership in fra

ternities and sororities, according to
the survey.
"I hashed for three years and was
always working through the popular
dinner-hour dorm programming," a
senior said.
"If I didn't need the money I
would've loved to have been more in
volved in my studies (honors work)
and professors," said another.
Loan debts affected the post
graduation plans of 39 percent of the
respondents.
"I plan to work for two years so I
can stabilize my debts," wrote one
senior.
Similar to previous years, 90
percent of the respondents
planned to acquire a graduate or
professional degree in the future.
Thirty-three percent of the re
spondents had already accepted a
job, and another 38 percent were
looking for a job, but had not
received offers yet.
In rating student services, the
seniors favored Green Library
over Meyer Library with 84 per
cent rating Green as "very good"
or "excellent" compared to 48 per
cent for Meyer.
When asked to evaluate the im
pact of interaction with faculty,

advisers, residence staff, room
mates and other students, 78 per
cent of the seniors said roommates
had "a lot" of impact on their
personal growth.
When asked to rate 18 personal
goals in their lives in a range from
"not important" to "essential," 47
percent of the respondents rated
"developing a meaningful philos
ophy of life" as "essential."
Forty-four percent of the
seniors surveyed rated "raising a
family" as "essential."
Twelve percent of the respon
dents rated "being financially well
off' as "essential," with 73 percent
selecting "somewhat important"
or "very important" on this goal.
Only two percent of the respond
dents rated "being accomplished
in the performing arts" as "es

sential," making this goal the least
essential in the seniors' perspec
tives.
The seniors rated "intellectual
achievement" most highly among
15 areas of life nurtured by the
Stanford environment.
Nevertheless, some seniors ex
pressed disappointment with cer
tain aspects of their academic ex
perience.
Respondents voiced their com
plaints with the academic advising
program, with 42 percent rating
it as "poor."
When asked to evaluate their
courses by subject area, respon
dents showed the most dissatis
faction with the natural sciences
and mathematics, with only 54
percent giving "very good" or "ex
cellent" ratings in these areas.
