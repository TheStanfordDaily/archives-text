# Commercialization of ASSU Sunday Flicks disturbs students
## 
### Mark Richman 
Students who attended the ASSU Sun
day Flicks these past two weeks had
mixed reactions about the idea of an ad
vertisement before the movie, but all
agreed that the ASSU should stop
showing the provocative advertisement
for Body-Glove sportswear before the
film.
The ASSU has shown the minute-long
commercial before the last two Sunday
Flicks as part of an arrangement with
the ASSU's film distribution company
and Body-Glove.
The commercial depicts a shirtless man
in blue jeans and a young woman in a
skin-tight Body-Glove outfit peeking at
each other until they finally meet in a

lagoon and clasp hands.
At last Sunday's late showing, the
crowd loudly booed the clip as it ended.
Most students concurred that the ad
vertisement was offensively sexist.
The advertisement was "offensive and
distracting," according to freshman
Jaime Fischer.

Freshman Alan Gutman called the ad
vertisement "degrading" and more an "in
sult."
Senior Glenn Schneider and freshman
Roman Roszkewycz both called the com
mercial "sexist."
Lisa Yumul, also a freshman, called it
a "mild irritant" and said, "[The com
mercial] didn't make me want to buy
Body Glove."
Tim Cahill, the ASSU Flicks coordina
tor, said he did not see the clip before
it was shown, saying he was only "told
briefly what it was about."
Cahill said the ASSU did not solicit
the advertisement from Body Glove.
Body Glove offered to pay the ASSU's
film distributor an undisclosed sum if
the ASSU showed the clip for two weeks

at the Sunday Flick, according to Cahill.
The distributor then suggested the idea
to the ASSU.
For showing the clip, the ASSU will
receive a "discount on a movie next quar
ter .. . which will allow the ASSU to rent
a more expensive movie," Cahill said.
"He added that the ASSU probably will
not advertise on a regular basis. "It's not
a practice we will continue," Cahill said.
But many students were offended by
the idea of any kind of commercial before
something as sacred as Flicks.
"I'd rather pay more money than see
commercials," freshman Jamie Fischer
said.
Gutman said he didn't think commer
cials were necessary because people are
happy with the movies right now and no

more money is needed to purchase more
expensive movies that are not necessarily
better.
Others, however, did not mind the idea
of commercials at Flicks, as long as they
were done in good taste.
"If it will reduce our prices commer
cials are okay," according to Eto.
Many others did not know the clip was
an advertisement until the end.
Many said they were unprepared to
see a commercial at Flicks. One woman
said the commercial took away the special
qualities of seeing a movie, making it
"like [watching] television."
Freshman Merritt Eto said, "It did not
look like a commercial at first, but after
a while you say, 'I think this is a com
mercial.' "
