Soviet Prof. Alexander Fur
senko blamed former Soviet
leader Josef Stalin for the present
ills of the Soviet Union while
speaking yesterday at History
Corner on glasnost and
perestroika.
"Stalin's views are not forgot

them," said the Soviet scholar.
"Despite irrefutable evidence,
many people still think Stalin is
a great leader and they continue
to support him. I could speak

Stalin's collectivism."
Fursenko, who spoke to 12 stu

hour here, is on a two month tour
of the United States. Fursenko
previously spoke at Harvard Uni

days.
Through much of his prepared
speech, Fursenko criticized the
policies of Stalin and called for a

Fursenko lauded General Sec

policies of perestroika, sweeping
political and social restructuring,

"Theoretically perestroika may
fail, but practically it must survive
for the USSR," said Fursenko.
"Perestroika gives us an opportu

Fursenko, 62, is the chair of

the USSR Academy of Sciences in
Leningrad.
He specializes in U.S. history
and international relations and
has published books on subjects
ranging from oil trusts in the
United States to American foreign
policy in China.
He is visiting the United States
as a USSR Exchange Scholar
through the American Council of
learned Societies.

the opening of Politburo archives.
