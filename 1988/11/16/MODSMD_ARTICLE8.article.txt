# Soviet professor blames USSR's plight on Stalin
## 
### Nathanael Cousins Staff writer 
Soviet Prof. Alexander Fur
senko blamed former Soviet
leader Josef Stalin for the present
ills of the Soviet Union while
speaking yesterday at History
Corner on glasnost and
perestroika.
"Stalin's views are not forgot
ten, but we are retreating from
them," said the Soviet scholar.
"Despite irrefutable evidence,
many people still think Stalin is
a great leader and they continue
to support him. I could speak
much of the damage caused by
Stalin's collectivism."
Fursenko, who spoke to 12 stu
dents and faculty members for an
hour here, is on a two month tour
of the United States. Fursenko
previously spoke at Harvard Uni
versity and will attend a confer
ence in Honolulu in the coming
days.
Through much of his prepared
speech, Fursenko criticized the
policies of Stalin and called for a
"re-interpretation of Soviet his
tory."
Fursenko lauded General Sec

retary Mikhail Gorbachev for his
policies of perestroika, sweeping
political and social restructuring,
and glasnost, the new openness
in the Soviet Union.
"Theoretically perestroika may
fail, but practically it must survive
for the USSR," said Fursenko.
"Perestroika gives us an opportu
nity for modernization. Without
modernization, the USSR is un
predictable."
Fursenko, 62, is the chair of
the Institute of USSR History at
the USSR Academy of Sciences in
Leningrad.
He specializes in U.S. history
and international relations and
has published books on subjects
ranging from oil trusts in the
United States to American foreign
policy in China.
He is visiting the United States
as a USSR Exchange Scholar
through the American Council of
learned Societies.
In the spirit of glasnost, Fur
senko demanded a re-examination
of Stalin and World War II and
the opening of Politburo archives.

victory is equal to devastating
defeat," said Fursenko about
World War 11. "But what price?
Was it reasonable to pay such a
price? That is on debate now.
Many people continue to believe
Stalin is a great leader. Despite
evidence that he initialed the lines
of people to be executed, they
don't believe he started the
Purges."
Fursenko cited Stalin's refusal

to retreat forces from Kiev and
the Soviet offensive stance as
causes of millions of senseless So
viet deaths. He estimated direct
Soviet losses in World War II at
23 to 27 million and described
Stalin's war record as, "terrible
miscalculations and a crime."
Fursenko also blamed Stalin for
difficulties in U.S.-Soviet rela
tions.
"We look at America from
Stalin's perspective: the main or
ganizer of anti-Soviet interven
tion,"* he said. "This created an
image of the enemy and distorted
the approach to U.S.-Soviet rela

tions. We are re-interpreting this
data and could do it faster if the
archives are open."
Fursenko looked optimistically
to the future of perestroika and
glasnost. "You will see a more
pluralistic approach, but this does
not mean a destruction of Mar
xism," he said.
He identified the media as one
area in which the Soviet Union
has radically improved under glas
nost. "Now your newspapers are
incredibly dull compared to ours.
In every issue there is new infor
mation, critical information, that
we have never heard before."
