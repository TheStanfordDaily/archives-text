## Judge won't drop North charge 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The judge in the
Iran-Contra conspiracy case refused yesterday
to dismiss a charge that former presidential
aide Oliver North illegally used a tax-exempt
foundation to raise money for Nicaraguan
rebels.
U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell upheld
the legal validity of the charge that North
conspired to defraud the government by using
the tax-exempt National Endowment for the
Preservation of Liberty to raise money for
the non-tax deductible purpose of helping arm
the Contras.
Gesell rejected North's contention that the
charge failed to allege an offense, saying it
"recites all necessary elements of a fraudulant
conspiracy, and it is specific in its description
of North's involvement."
The judge also dismissed North's argument
that donations to finance aid to the Contras
were legally charitable contributions under
the tax code.
"The issue is not whether lethal and other
military or humanitarian aid can ever be

charitable, rather, the issue according to the
indictment is fraud," Gesell said.
"The court understands this fraud to be
the soliciting of funds for military purposes
by representing that the money gained could
be deducted by the donor on his tax return
while knowing that no exemption had been
granted for NEPL's activities as alleged in
the indictment," the judge said.
Gesell noted that NEPL's statement of pur
pose when it applied for a tax-exempt status
with the Internal Revenue Service makes "no
mention of Central America, military or non
military assistance, or humanitarian aid of
any kind for any group anywhere in the
world."
The statement quoted in Gesell's opinion
states that the foundation "was formed to
educate memnbers of the general public on
Amwerican political systems and societal in
stitutions" through study and research.
Two conservative fund-raisers, Carl "Spitz"
Channell and Richard Miller, pleaded guilty

last year to charges they participated in the
conspiracy.
Both are cooperating with independent
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh and implicated
North in the operation of the foundation,
which raised $3.2 million from private donors
for the Contras.
The illegal fund-raising charge is one of 15
against North, the former National Security
Council aide and retired Marine lieutenant
colonel who is first of four defendants set to
be tried in the Iran-Contra conspiracy case.
No date has been set for North's trial.
He is also accused of conspiring with former
national security adviser John Poindexter and
arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air
Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, to defraud
the government by diverting U.S.-Iran arms
sale profits to the Contras.
Gesell, meanwhile, rejected a motion by
Hakim for a hearing on whether prosecutors
violated his attorney-client privilege by ques
tioning Geneva-based lawyer Willard Zucker.
