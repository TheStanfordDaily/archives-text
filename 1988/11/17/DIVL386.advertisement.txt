Attention: Microdisc prices
on Apple® Macintosh®
computers will increase on
January 13,1989
On October 15,1988 Apple Computer, Inc. increased its prices for
certain computer products. Microdisc, at the Stanford Bookstore, has
been able to hold off on increasing its prices because of a special large
purchase it made before October 15. Microdisc expects its inventory to
run out by January 13,1989, at which point it will raise its prices.
However, if Microdisc's inventory runs out before January 13,1989,
Microdisc will have to increase its prices earlier, so don't wait to
purchase a Macintosh! Products affected by the price increase include:
Macintosh SE, Macintosh 11, LaserWriter lINT & lINTX, and Apple
3.5" drive. Price comparisons are listed below.
This table does not include all price increases.
Please visit Microdisc for a complete listing.
