# Conference suggests Bush economic plan
## 
### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
With an eye to the deficit and American compet
itiveness, Hoover fellows joined with leading con
servative scholars and policy analysts from around
the nation over the past three days to pre
pare economic recommendations for President-elect
George Bush.
"The U.S. economy is still strong and there's no
apparent disaster ahead," said Senior Research Fel
low Walter Hoadley, chair of the conference. "But
we have been spending more than we've been taking
in — living beyond our means — and we need to
put our house in order," he said, summing up the
conclusions of the conference.
The annual Hoover Institution economic confer
ence concluded yesterday with workshop leaders
presenting session summaries. Over the next two
weeks, conference committee members will compile
a final report to be issued to Vice President Bush
and selected members of Congress.
In his keynote address on Tuesday evening, James
Miller 111, former director of the Office of Manage
ment and Budget, said government tends to "create
more problems than it solves."
He also stressed that the economy was not as
bad as some might suggest. He said the United
States is not a debtor nation "if you measure lia
bilities correctly," and foreign investments in U.S.
real estate "are a tiny portion of the total (of
privately held U.S. land)."
Here are some of the issues Miller touched on
that may be included in the conference's final report:
• Education. Because there is "increasing dis
parity between performance of U.S. students and
those of our major trading partners," the United
States should encourage competition among private
and public schools by providing tax vouchers to
parents who send their children to private schools.
• Budget. Congress allocates too much money for
low-priority, pork-barrel projects, Miller said. This
can be solved by giving the president a line-item veto.
• Social Security. Benefits to Social Security
recipients too often exceed the amounts those indi
viduals contributed to Social Security, so that dif
ference should be taxed in order to keep the system
alive.
• AIDS. In order to reduce emotional suffering
and the need for $30 billion spent annually for
treatment, the transmission of AIDS should be made
a crime and efforts to reduce drug abuse should
continue.
