# Women's Center urges move

### Malinda McCollum 
The Women's Center is push
ing for a move from the Toyon
Eating Clubs to the Old Union
because of the center's current
out-of-the-way location.
Women's Center coordinator
Sarah Bryer said the present lo
cation near Toyon is "out of the
normal traffic patterns for stu
dents." According to Bryer, part
of the center's purpose is to
serve as a referral center and
the current location hinders stu
dent drop-ins. "We're not able
to serve our constituency as well
as we'd like," she said.
An Old Union location would
alleviate that problem, Bryer
said. She noted that other com
munity centers — like the
Chicano-Latino; gay, lesbian
and bisexual and black commu
nities — are located in or near
Old Union and that it is a cen
tral location for students.
The Committee on Student
Space issued a report last spring
recommending that community

centers be centrally located. The
Women's Center proposal is
therefore likely to win the com
mittee's approval, according to
Michael Ramsey-Perez, commit
tee co-chair and coordinator of
Student Organization Services.
The committee has yet to set
a definite date for announcing
a decision.
The Women's Center could be
moved to a central part of
campus within two years,
Ramsey-Perez said, but an Old
Union location is not guar
anteed.
The center currently offers job
listings for women, a library of
books related to women's issues
and space for women's events.
The Rape Education Project
also operates from the center.
A possible casualty of relocat
ing the Women's Center could
be the popular self-defense class
that the center sponsors. The
techniques taught to the 15-
student class require a large
area. The "urgency" of the col
lective's desire to move to a bet

ter location may lead it to at
first "compromise space for lo
cation," which might result in
an area too small for the class,
Bryer explained.
However, Women's Center
staffer Karen Bernstein said
that the Women's Center pro
grams are so important that the
new area "is going to have to
accomodate" all of the existing
programs.
According to Bryer, the im
petus for the move came from
a Committee on Student Space
report. Since it was released, the
Center has been trying "to show
the administration that there is
lots of (Stanford) community
support" for the move and to
persuade University officials.
The center circulated a peti
tion favoring the move and col
lected "about 1,000" signatures,
according to Bernstein. In addi
tion, ASSU senators Kathleen
Cole and Julie Martinez and
COP member Stacey Leyton
have drafted a resolution in sup
port of the move.
