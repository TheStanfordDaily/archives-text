## Fed chair wants deficit slashed Greenspan calls budget imbalance greatest threat to economy 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The National
Economic Commission opened its post
election attempt to break a seven-year
deadlock on the budget deficit with
repeated warnings yesterday that the
deficit represents the nation's greatest
economic threat.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan, one of the leadoff witnesses
before the bipartisan panel, said "The
deficit already has begun to eat away
at the foundations of our economic
strength, and the need to deal with it
is becoming ever more urgent."
Greenspan joined other witnesses in
saying that Congress and President
elect George Bush must reach agree
ment quickly on ways to slash the deficit
or run the risk that foreigners will stop
financing America's borrowing needs.
"We must put our fiscal house in
order so that we can address the other
problems which are important to us as
a nation," said Alice Rivlin, former head
of the Congressional Budget Office.
"Getting the budget deficit behind us
is a test of our ability to govern."
The comments offered a sharp con
trast to much of the debate during the
presidential campaign when both candi
dates sidestepped questions concerning
the deficit because they did not want
to offer detailed solutions.

However, some of the witnesses said
Bush, now that he is president-elect,
very well could be forced by events in
financial markets to seriously bargain
with Congress or risk triggering a free
fall in the value of the U.S. dollar.
"The rest of the world may well give
up on the dollar if it foresees four more
years of towering twin (budget and
trade) deficits," said C. Fred Bergsten,
head of the Institute for International
Economics.
Investors have been unusually jittery
in the past week over concerns that
Bush's tough stance against new taxes
and the larger Democratic marjorities
in Congress would translate into further
gridlock on solving the deficit problem.
The dollar has come under heavy sel
ling pressure and that has put down
ward pressure on U.S. stocks. The Dow
Jones industrial average was down al
most 15 points by mid-afternoon Wed
nesday, resuming a sharp decline that
began after Bush's election last week.
A fall in the dollar sends U.S. stocks
tumbling because investors fear that
interest rates will have to rise in this
country to continue to attract the
needed foreign investments. Rising U.S.
interest rates reduce business prospects
and raise threats of a recession.
Responding to the market concerns,

Bush has pledged to make the budget
deficit a top priority. However, he has
not indicated any willingness to aban
don his "flexible freeze" proposal by
which overall spending increases, ex
cluding Social Security and interest on
the debt, would be held to the rise in
inflation each year.
While Bush's economic advisers have
insisted that the country could grow its
way out of deficit problem without sharp
spending cuts or tax increases,
Greenspan rejected such a notion. He
indicated that tough choices would have
to be made on spending cuts to get the
deficit under control.
But Greenspan supported the Bush
contention that the deficit should be
reduced on the spending side rather
than by boosting taxes.
However, if spending cuts alone are
not sufficient to narrow the deficit,
Greenspan said tax hikes should be con
sidered because the need to cut the
deficit was so critical.
"How it is done is less relevant than
that it be done," Greenspan said.
The 12-member economic commis
sion, chaired by Democrat Robert
Strauss and Republican Drew Lewis,
was created by Congress a year ago to
come up with a blueprint for reducing
the federal budget deficit.
