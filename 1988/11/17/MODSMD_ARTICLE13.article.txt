U.S. trade deficit narrows slightly
WASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S. trade deficit
narrowed by almost 15 percent to $10.5 billion
in September, the government said yesterday, but
not enough to prevent a new assault on the dollar
over worries about what the head of the Federal
Reserve called a "dangerous corrosion" of the
American economy.
Exports rose by $700 million to a record high
$28.2 billion, the Commerce Department said.
Imports declined by 2.5 percent or $1.1 billion
to $38.7 billion from a record high in August.
The $10.5 billion trade gap for September was
down by $1.8 billion from the revised August
trade deficit figure of $12.3 billion, a drop of
about 14.6 percent.
But neither change was big enough to stem a
new selling wave of dollars by traders worried
about inflation from an overheating economy and
skeptical of President-elect George Bush's prom
ise to reduce the federal budget deficit through
"a freeze" without any tax increases.
Is Mickey a closet Republican?
WASHINGTON (AP) - Mickey Mouse cele
brated his 60th birthday two days early yesterday
with balloons, a four-tiered cake and a jazz band
party, where his tailless friends disclosed he's a
contented bachelor and a closet Republican.
"I think he's been a Republican," said Roy

Disney, who ought to know.
No sooner had Walt Disney's nephew uttered
the R-word than Michael Eisner, board chairman
of Disney's $3 billion corporate empire, grabbed
the microphone and said, "No, he's non-partisan."
But the elephant was out of the bag, and
Mickey didn't deny it.
It was 60 years ago tomorrow, on Nov. 18,
1928, at the Colony Theater in New York City,
that Mickey made his film debut in "Steamboat
Willie," the first synchronized sound cartoon in
black and white.
Sakharov criticizes Teller on SDI
WASHINGTON (AP) — Soviet physicist Andrei
Sakharov warned yesterday that deploying a Star
Wars strategic defense system could tempt a pre
emptive attack against it and trigger nuclear
world war.
Sakharov delivered his stark message at a din
ner honoring Edward Teller, the U.S. physicist
often dubbed the father of the American hydrogen
bomb who is a strong advocate of deploying a
space-based nuclear missile defense system.
It was the first meeting between the two, and
Sakharov, winner of the Nobel and Albert
Einstein peace prizes, used it to emphasize his
differences with Teller and to say that the world
could be on the doorstep of significant arms
control efforts if Star Wars is not allowed to
stand in the way.
