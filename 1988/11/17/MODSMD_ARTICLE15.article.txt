ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) —
Benazir Bhutto claimed victory
yesterday after election returns

ing the opposition in Pakistan's
first open elections in more than
a decade.
With 103 of 205 districts report
ing, the Pakistan People's Party
had 52 seats in the National As
sembly compared with 21 for its
main rival, the right-wing Islamic
Democratic Alliance.

The nine-party alliance includes
loyalists of President Mohammacr

months ago. Another 30 seats in
the assembly went to independents
and minor parties.

of the PPP," Bhutto told the njws

About 48 million of Pakistan's
107 million people were eligible

the Bhutto party, a bicycle for the
Islamic Democratic Alliance and
other symbols such as a ladder,
flower or ink pot for nearly 30
smaller parties.
