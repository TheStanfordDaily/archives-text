## Let's start talking 
### 
Red Ed should create
a setting where students
can speak more freely

THE SILENCE is deafening.
In the aftermath of the
racially offensive fliers at
Ujamaa House and elsewhere, and
the ensuing atmosphere of racial
tension, people are afraid to talk
about it at all.
Many students completely evade
the issue, especially when speaking
on the record to The Daily, for fear
of being labeled a racist. Other stu
dents, particularly minority stu
dents, are rightfully indignant that
others are not addressing their
concerns.
As University President Donald
Kennedy noted in his speech to
freshmen during orientation, we
should try to live together like a
family. In a cohesive community,
it is not so difficult to air griev
ances and differences. The problem
is that many people simply do not
comprehend what racism really is.
Although Residential Education
has urged resident assistants to
facilitate discussions about the in
cidents at Ujamaa, few have oc
curred. Moreover, those discus
sions that have taken place have
been marked by a reluctance of
students to express strong opinions
or delve into the most controversial
issues.
And formal discussions, like sen
ate forums have not adequately
reached the people who most need
to understand why actions are
racist.
An informal discussion in the
relatively comfortable, in-house at
mosphere of a dorm would be much
preferable to no discussion or a
polarized, accusatory discourse. In

a less formal setting, students can
more easily listen to what others
are thinking without worrying
about receiving a label. Airing and
understanding grievances is the
best method to attenuate anger.
However, as some have already
experienced, the informal discus
sion does not go very far without
the help of a formal structure. A
trained moderator can bring out
the salient points as well as en
courage students with strong but
silent opinions to speak out.
For example, Res Ed could ex
tend to all dorms the role-playing
scenario similar to that which oc
curs during RA training. Through
such a dialogue-encouraging activ
ity, students could learn about the
opinions of those with whom they
might disagree who do not share
their view without worrying about
being labeled a racist or a com
plainer.
By understanding the views of
other members of the Stanford
family, students will better com
prehend their own intellectual and
moral evolution and be better
prepared to defend their own po
sitions â€” especially when they
return home for the holidays and
find that their values and ideals
are somewhat different from their
family and high school friends.
An open, informal airing of griev
ances is only a short term solution,
but it does open up the lines of
communication. An ethnic studies
program is still a feasible and nec
essary goal, which would enable
students to better understand and
empathize with the backgrounds
of others.
Sweeping the problem of racism
under the mat is no way to alle
viate it. The anger and bitterness
will not be eliminated by ignoring
the tension or paying lip service
to it. In fact, the anger may simmer
without an airing of opinions, ex
ploding in bitter acrimony later.
