## Quality time with Dad 
### 
A FEW WEEKS AGO I had the rare
opportunity to finally spend some
time watching my dad at work.
Not only was it rare because he lives
in New York, and therefore I don't see
him much, but it was rare because he
was at work in the Pacific Ocean, 60
miles off the coast of Monterey.
My dad is a marine geologist or an
oceanographer, depending on how he
chooses to answer, at any particular time,
the question, "Dad, what's the name of
your job?" His homebase is a geological
observatory where he compiles his re
search to write papers and grants (to
support further research), but he spends
somewhere between one-fifth and one
fourth of every year out on the open seas
doing the research itself.
It is then that he actually tows his
underwater camera and sonar equipment,
collecting raw data on the morphology of
the ocean floor that he will later use to
draw his maps, organize presentations
and make his predictions.
I don't fully understand what he does,
but having taken a few college level sci
ence courses and having seen what one
goes through to earn a Ph.D., I am proud
of his brains and his commitment.
Until this last month, no one in my
family had ever been able to spend time
at sea with my dad because he is usually
gone for at least one month, and we all
have our own lives to lead. But when
the opportunity came for me to join my
dad for a weekend, I jumped at the
chance.
That weekend out on the ocean turned
out to be both an adventure and a mean

ingful experience. The adventure started
Friday night when I was transported, via
a rubber dinghy about the size of a life
raft, through the dark, open nighttime
waters to the larger ship where my dad
awaited me. I was sure that the unwel
coming waves would suck me up, but
somehow, I safely arrived on board.
Saturday I awoke to a ship gently rock
ing back and forth. I was lucky the
weather was good, or else I may have
spent the weekend in the "head," and I
was able to manage the steady movement
of the decks as I manage the jolting and
swaying subways of New York. It was
on these decks that I realized I had never
before been on a boat surrounded solely
by blue, blue skies and blue seas, with
no land in sight. It was quite an awesome
feeling.
Most of the day I tried to make myself
useful by helping my dad develop the
film they had shot earlier in the week
with his underwater camera equipment.
Saturday night he and his graduate stu
dents monitored the camera they were
towing along the ocean floor, but despite
my youth compared to his, I couldn't
handle an "all-nighter."
Sunday we returned to Monterey, and
my dad and I packed up his equipment
for transport back to the East. As I
relaxed on the deck, the beauty of the
open ocean, the smogless sky and the
salt air really struck me; a beauty only
to be enhanced by the two blue whales
1 saw as we entered the bay.
As we worked, ate and talked, my dad
explained his objectives and how he would
analyze the pictures and data he had

collected. I got lost in the physics of
sound waves for awhile, but in the end,
I understood him. I could finally share
in his excitement over his scientific pur
suits, and he could finally share his ex
periences at sea, so much an integral part
of himself by now, with someone in our
family.
Three days later he came up to Stan
ford before heading back home, and it
became my turn to show off my world.
The open sea is his domain, and we spent
our time on the ship talking about his
job and his interests; however, Stanford
is my domain and here I shared with
him my life and my feelings about my
friends, my school work and my state of
well-being, or non-well-being.
I think I respect my dad more than
anyone else, but he is a hard person to
get close to, and sometimes I feel that
respect is from too far a distance.
Since I see my dad less and less each
year, it is important that the time we
spend together is quality time. This past
visit was a quality visit: not only because
I learned more about him and what he
does, but because he also learned more
about me, and this sharing of ourselves
will inevitably bring us closer and make
us better friends.

support further research), but he spends
somewhere between one-fifth and one
fourth of every year out on the open seas
doing the research itself.
It is then that he actually tows his
underwater camera and sonar equipment,
collecting raw data on the morphology of
the ocean floor that he will later use to
draw his maps, organize presentations
and make his predictions.
I don't fully understand what he does,
but having taken a few college level sci
ence courses and having seen what one
goes through to earn a Ph.D., I am proud
of his brains and his commitment.
Until this last month, no one in my
family had ever been able to spend time
at sea with my dad because he is usually
gone for at least one month, and we all
have our own lives to lead. But when
the opportunity came for me to join my
dad for a weekend, I jumped at the
chance.
That weekend out on the ocean turned
out to be both an adventure and a mean

ingful experience. The adventure started
Friday night when I was transported, via
a rubber dinghy about the size of a life
raft, through the dark, open nighttime
waters to the larger ship where my dad
awaited me. I was sure that the unwel
coming waves would suck me up, but
somehow, I safely arrived on board.
Saturday I awoke to a ship gently rock
ing back and forth. I was lucky the
weather was good, or else I may have
spent the weekend in the "head," and I
was able to manage the steady movement
of the decks as I manage the jolting and
swaying subways of New York. It was
on these decks that I realized I had never
before been on a boat surrounded solely
by blue, blue skies and blue seas, with
no land in sight. It was quite an awesome
feeling.
Most of the day I tried to make myself
useful by helping my dad develop the
film they had shot earlier in the week
with his underwater camera equipment.
Saturday night he and his graduate stu
dents monitored the camera they were
towing along the ocean floor, but despite
my youth compared to his, I couldn't
handle an "all-nighter."
Sunday we returned to Monterey, and
my dad and I packed up his equipment
for transport back to the East. As I
relaxed on the deck, the beauty of the
open ocean, the smogless sky and the
salt air really struck me; a beauty only
to be enhanced by the two blue whales
1 saw as we entered the bay.
As we worked, ate and talked, my dad
explained his objectives and how he would
analyze the pictures and data he had

collected. I got lost in the physics of
sound waves for awhile, but in the end,
I understood him. I could finally share
in his excitement over his scientific pur
suits, and he could finally share his ex
periences at sea, so much an integral part
of himself by now, with someone in our
family.
Three days later he came up to Stan
ford before heading back home, and it
became my turn to show off my world.
The open sea is his domain, and we spent
our time on the ship talking about his
job and his interests; however, Stanford
is my domain and here I shared with
him my life and my feelings about my
friends, my school work and my state of
well-being, or non-well-being.
I think I respect my dad more than
anyone else, but he is a hard person to
get close to, and sometimes I feel that
respect is from too far a distance.
Since I see my dad less and less each
year, it is important that the time we
spend together is quality time. This past
visit was a quality visit: not only because
I learned more about him and what he
does, but because he also learned more
about me, and this sharing of ourselves
will inevitably bring us closer and make
us better friends.
