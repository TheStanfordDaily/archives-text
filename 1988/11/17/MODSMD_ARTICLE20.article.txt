## University will remove racist symbols immediately 
### 
TWO PAINTED SWASTIKAS were
found recently in areas of Stan
ford student housing. The first
was reported to the Facilities Supervi
sor at Lagunita Court. It was part of a
wall of graffiti in a basement area of
that residence.
The second was located on the inside
of a stall door within a bathroom in
the Lambda Nu house. In both cases,
the swastikas were not newly painted.
It appears that both had been in place
for some time.
Both symbols have been removed by
housing facilities staff. Concern has
been raised about the lack of quick
response to the intial request to re-

move the swastika in the basement of
Lagunita Court. The fact is that the
Lagunita Court Facilities Supervisor
was approached about its existence and
failed to make a written note of the
request to have it removed.
As a result, the request was not
acted on immediately. After approxi
mately two weeks, the issue of its
existence was raised again and it was
painted out that same afternoon. The
Facilities Supervisor has apologized
directly to students for the delay in the
removal.
When the swastika in the Lambda
Nu bathroom was brought to our
attention, the Row Housing facilities

We sincerely regret the
delay and have
instructed our staff to
respond differently in
the future.

staff had it painted over immediately.
We lament the existence of these
symbols in Stanford student housing.
We have no knowledge of their source
or how long ago they were painted.

The fact that we failed to respond
immediately to the first request has
been carefully evaluated. We sincerely
regret that delay and have instructed
our staff to respond differently in the
future.
The policy of Housing and Food
Service is that all such symbols will be
removed from University housing
facilities immediately upon their dis
covery. If students, faculty or staff are
aware of the existence of others please
bring them to our attention.
