# Heckling at talk reveals ignorance
## 
### 
The faculty and administration of
Stanford University are failing in
educating the young people at this
institution. The heckling of Randall
Terry, the founder of Operation Res
cue, to the point where he was not
able to give his speech yesterday indi
cates that there are students who are
not learning the most valuable lesson
of listening.
What is worse is that these students
feel they can get away with such tac
tics because they know the administra
tion will condone the action if it agrees
with the so-called "liberal agenda."
These students will fail in the real
world where the only way to succeed is
to listen to all sides of the problem in
order to find a solution. These stu
dents obviously are incapable of an
original thought, for that ability comes
from a personal evaluation of all points
of view.
I am embarrassed to say that al-

though I attend this university I would
not send my child to it for fear that I
would be hindering his education.
