# Kristallnacht event, speech not covered
## 
### 
One of the primary purposes of The
Daily, as a student newspaper, should
be to keep readers apprised of signifi
cant events on campus, as well as those
throughout the nation and the world.
At Stanford, where so many students
depend on The Daily as their principal
news source, this service is particularly
important. Unfortunately, on Nov. 11,
The Daily failed us all in this regard.
On Thursday night, Nov. 10, hun
dreds of students, faculty and commu
nity members attended a program com
memorating the 50th anniversary of
Kristallnacht, the events which marked
the beginning of Nazi atrocities against

Jews, in particular, and against ethnic,
racial and religious minorities, in gen
eral.
At Stanford, where minority issues
are appropriately considered so mean
ingful, this should have been a front
page story. Yet, it did not even appear
in the Friday, Nov. 11 edition.
On Thursday afternoon, a Kristall
nacht address to the West German
parliament by parliament president
Philipp Jenninger demonstrated such
insensitivity, at best, and anti-
Semitism, at worst, that numerous
members of parliament walked out in
protest, some in tears. This event,
which led to Jenninger's resignation in
disgrace on Friday, was apparently not
deemed newsworthy by The Daily staff.
The lessons of the Holocaust are no
more for Jews alone than those of
slavery in America and the Civil
Rights Movement are for blacks alone.
The worldwide commemoration of the
50th anniversary of Kristallnacht last
week was one of the most important
occurrences in recent years. By failing
to cover these stories, The Daily
robbed its readership of the impetus to

contemplate the legacy of the
Holocaust and implicitly minimized
their importance.
