# Clarification of section v. class size
## 
### 
In order to make a rational budget
allocation, we ask departments within
the School of Humanities and Sciences
to have a minimum course size of 35
students before hiring a TA to conduct
discussion sections, grade papers, etc.
Departments then set their own policy
as to section size; many departments
ask the TA to divide his or her "35
students" into smaller sections, depend
ing upon the nature of the curriculum
and the wishes of the faculty. We do
not require that each section in each
department have a minimum of 35
students.
