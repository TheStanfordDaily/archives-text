"Woman in the Dark"

He rubbed the fire of his cigarette out in an
ashtray on the dressing table and came around the
bed to her.
She stood up straight and tall, awaiting him.
He stood close to her for a moment, looking at
her with eyes that weighed her beauty as imper
sonally as if she had been inanimate. Then he
pushed her head back rudely and kissed her.
She made neither sound nor movement of her
own, submitting completely to his caress, and when
he released her and stepped back, her face was as
unaffected, as masklike, as his.
— from "Woman in the Dark"
Raymond Chandler said of Dashiell Hammet, that
in his hands the American language "had no over
tones, left no echo, evoked no image beyond a distant
hill." "Woman in the Dark," Hammett's short 1933
novel reissued this year, brilliantly supports
Chandler's remark.
In "Woman in the Dark," Hammett creates a
narrative of the inanimate. In varying shades of
black and white, he precisely renders a world of
telephones ringing in empty rooms, automobiles
abandoned in rundown parts of town and diamond
rings tossed on the floor beside an unconscious
body. Isolated objects signal Hammett's thematic
emphasis on loneliness and decay.
Hammett carefully erases the emotions, motiva
tions and opinions of his characters. Their faces
are "expressionless." Their motions are limited to
the lighting of cigarettes or the pouring of whiskey.
On the rare occasions when they speak with each
other, they move through a language of dead end
streets.
In Hammett's world, when a woman asked a man
a question, he cut her off "ignoring the question
he had interrupted." When a man posed a question
to a woman, "whatever answer he received was
inaudible in the room." When a man began to speak,
he "went upstairs without finishing the sentence."
The thorough creation of this silent, inanimate
world is as great a stylistic achievement as any in
20th century American fiction — Hammett's world
is based on a profound insight into the American
imagination.
In accordance with the Puritan and capitalist
world view, in America we believe that a man who
doesn't move has the greatest potential for violence.
We believe that a woman who refuses to acknowledge
attraction of desire is the most erotic. And we

believe that the silent people who will not offer
promises, answers or absolutions are the only people
who have the power to give them.
In the creation of his characters, Hammett taps
into this heritage of repression, in which the ability
to conceal sexuality has become more erotic than
the ability to flaunt it and where the power of
wealth is registered by one's lack of concern for
money.
This is the aesthetic of the American hero em
bodied in Bogart's fulfillment of Sam Spade, and
in our other, silent figures of erotic indifference —
Brando, Deitrich, Bacall and Eastwood.
In "Woman in the Dark," this power of indif
ference and inaction is represented by the linguistic
economy of the double negative. When a woman
tells a policeman that her lover has "done nothing,"

the officer replies, "I haven't neither." Later, an
other officer explains to the same woman, "we got
nothing to do with you . . . don't give us no trouble
and we don't give you none."
Like the police in the story, Hammett continually
assures us that nothing is happening by stacking
the figures of absence. But, grammatically, the
duplicity of negation suggests an imminent presence.
In Hammett's narrative, negation is balanced by
negation until we are convinced that "trouble" is
precisely what does exist.
If "Woman in the Dark" has a failing, it lies in
the inexplicable intrusion of sentimentality into the
narrative. As the novel approaches its conclusion,
Hammett seems strangely overcome with a sudden
desire for speech, gesture and assurance. He instills
the story with the three dimensions of a romantic
novel scratching the surface of his narrative.
But, at his best, Hammett creates the perfect
inanimate text. Realizing that the thrill of reading
approaches its peak as icons become empty of sig
nification, he usually carefully effaces his characters.
Harnett's project is perfectly figured in the black
statuette of his greatest novel, "The Maltese Fal
con." His work is cast in lead and enameled in
black, a mysterious concrete symbol into which we
can read a history of betrayal, a wealth of gold, a
curse of violence and a cause for obsession and
destruction.
It is an object without value, but with an ominous
beauty.

"Woman in the Dark"
by Dashiell Hammett
Knopf, $15.95
Reviewed by Amor Towles
He rubbed the fire of his cigarette out in an
ashtray on the dressing table and came around the
bed to her.
She stood up straight and tall, awaiting him.
He stood close to her for a moment, looking at
her with eyes that weighed her beauty as imper
sonally as if she had been inanimate. Then he
pushed her head back rudely and kissed her.
She made neither sound nor movement of her
own, submitting completely to his caress, and when
he released her and stepped back, her face was as
unaffected, as masklike, as his.
— from "Woman in the Dark"
Raymond Chandler said of Dashiell Hammet, that
in his hands the American language "had no over
tones, left no echo, evoked no image beyond a distant
hill." "Woman in the Dark," Hammett's short 1933
novel reissued this year, brilliantly supports
Chandler's remark.
In "Woman in the Dark," Hammett creates a
narrative of the inanimate. In varying shades of
black and white, he precisely renders a world of
telephones ringing in empty rooms, automobiles
abandoned in rundown parts of town and diamond
rings tossed on the floor beside an unconscious
body. Isolated objects signal Hammett's thematic
emphasis on loneliness and decay.
Hammett carefully erases the emotions, motiva
tions and opinions of his characters. Their faces
are "expressionless." Their motions are limited to
the lighting of cigarettes or the pouring of whiskey.
On the rare occasions when they speak with each
other, they move through a language of dead end
streets.
In Hammett's world, when a woman asked a man
a question, he cut her off "ignoring the question
he had interrupted." When a man posed a question
to a woman, "whatever answer he received was
inaudible in the room." When a man began to speak,
he "went upstairs without finishing the sentence."
The thorough creation of this silent, inanimate
world is as great a stylistic achievement as any in
20th century American fiction — Hammett's world
is based on a profound insight into the American
imagination.
In accordance with the Puritan and capitalist
world view, in America we believe that a man who
doesn't move has the greatest potential for violence.
We believe that a woman who refuses to acknowledge
attraction of desire is the most erotic. And we

believe that the silent people who will not offer
promises, answers or absolutions are the only people
who have the power to give them.
In the creation of his characters, Hammett taps
into this heritage of repression, in which the ability
to conceal sexuality has become more erotic than
the ability to flaunt it and where the power of
wealth is registered by one's lack of concern for
money.
This is the aesthetic of the American hero em
bodied in Bogart's fulfillment of Sam Spade, and
in our other, silent figures of erotic indifference —
Brando, Deitrich, Bacall and Eastwood.
In "Woman in the Dark," this power of indif
ference and inaction is represented by the linguistic
economy of the double negative. When a woman
tells a policeman that her lover has "done nothing,"

the officer replies, "I haven't neither." Later, an
other officer explains to the same woman, "we got
nothing to do with you . . . don't give us no trouble
and we don't give you none."
Like the police in the story, Hammett continually
assures us that nothing is happening by stacking
the figures of absence. But, grammatically, the
duplicity of negation suggests an imminent presence.
In Hammett's narrative, negation is balanced by
negation until we are convinced that "trouble" is
precisely what does exist.
If "Woman in the Dark" has a failing, it lies in
the inexplicable intrusion of sentimentality into the
narrative. As the novel approaches its conclusion,
Hammett seems strangely overcome with a sudden
desire for speech, gesture and assurance. He instills
the story with the three dimensions of a romantic
novel scratching the surface of his narrative.
But, at his best, Hammett creates the perfect
inanimate text. Realizing that the thrill of reading
approaches its peak as icons become empty of sig
nification, he usually carefully effaces his characters.
