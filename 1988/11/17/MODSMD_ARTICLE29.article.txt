# John Updike comes to Stanford
## 
### 
One of the most brilliant and important writers
of our time, John Updike will read at Aimenberg
Auditorium, Friday, Nov. 18 at 4 p.m., spon
sored by the ASSU Speakers Bureau.
Updike's canon of thirteen novels, nine short
story collections, four volumes of poetry, three
collections of essays and criticism and a play
makes him not only one of our more prolific
writers, but one of our most versatile. His formal,
stylistic and thematic diversity has lead to such
distinct works as "Rabbit, Run"and "The
Witches of Eastwick."
Updike is best known for his uncanny vision
of American middle class life. In his Rabbit
trilogy, he has given expression not only the
American male experience of Harry Angstrom,
but to the Middle American experience of 1950-
1980.
Upon acceptance of the National Book Critics
Circle Award for "Rabbit is Rich," Updike de
scribed his book as "em unsensational render
ing of equivocal normal life, as It is led in
middle age, by a man as ordinary as any Amer
ican is ordinary."
Although Updike's stories chronicle everyday
life, his work itself is never ordinary. Through
his seemingly boundless verbal and visionary
genius, pot roast, vericose veins and basketball
become haunting and effective artistic images.
He is a living room reporter with an eloquent
and sounding voice.
John Hoyer Updike was bom in 1932, in
Shilington, Penn, the only child of Wesley Rus
sell Updike, a high school mathematics teacher,
and Linda Grace Hoyer.
Updike graduated Harvard College summa
cum laude and attended the Ruskin School of
Drawing and Fine Arts at Oxford. From 1955
to 1957, he worked as a reporter for The New
Yorker, in which he has continued to publish
stories, poems and criticism.
Updike is the recipient of the O'Henry Award
for 1967-68, the American Book Award, the
National Books Critic Circle Award for both
criticism and fiction and the 1981 Pulitzer Prize.
Tickets for this major event are free. A recep
