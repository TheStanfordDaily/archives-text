# War journalist fills in minority experience
## 
### Diane Bisgeier Staff writer 
It took two trips across the
Pacific Ocean and almost 17 years
of haggling with editors and pub
lishers before journalist and Bap
tist minister Wallace Terry could
finally publish the previously un
told story of black-American war
veterans.
After spending more than two
years in Vietnam as a war corre
spondent for Time magazine,
Terry returned in 1969 with what
he termed "a 700-page news
story."
The topic of the role of black
Americans in Vietnam occurred
to Terry when he noted a blatant
absence of the black war experi
ence in the media. "I grew up
believing Henry Fonda won the
American Revolution, Gary Coop
er made the world safe for de
mocracy and John Wayne won
World War II," said Terry, who is
also a fellow at Harvard Univer
sity and Yale University. "I didn't
want Hollywood to forget this

war."
In Vietnam, Terry discovered
firsthand how inaccurate the
media's portrayal of the war ex
perience actually was. He ex
plained that blacks, although com
prising only 11 percent of the gen
eral population, actually made up
about 17 percent of the troops in
Vietnam.
"Blacks accounted for up to 23
percent of the combat casualties,"
said Terry, who said blacks were
often assigned the worst military
duties. He added that the front
lines were known as "soulville"
because of the high concentration
of blacks there.
Terry added that "blacks now
make up 30 to 40 percent of our
rifle units in the Marines" and
that there are a disproportionate
amount of Hispanics in the armed
services as well.
"I think it is unfair that we put
the burden of carrying the gun
on the poor because they have no
opportunities elsewhere," he said,
pointing out that 24 graduates

high school were killed in Viet
nam, while only 20 graduates
from all of the Ivy League schools
combined were killed.
Although racism still existed in
wartime, including cross bur
nings, lack of promotions and
recognition and unfair military
assignments, Terry said the situ
ation also resulted in a "human
bonding" between blacks and
whites.
"It is the great untold story
because coming home, no black
could tell his family that his best

friend from Vietnam was white.
Whites couldn't tell their families
either," he said.
Terry added that it was ironic
that Martin Luther King Jr.'s
dream of white and black coopera
tion was actually realized in the
war that King abhorred.
The speech culminated Stan
ford's annual Achievement Week,
which aims "to inspire race pride,
to present influential role models,
to provide a meaningful service
to the community and to address
a current event." The week is
sponsored by the Omega Founda
tion, the community service
branch of Omega Psi Phi frater
nity, a black fraternity on campus.
"Terry's presentation was right
on," said black Vietnam veteran
Ralph Hamilton, who attended the
speech. "I'm glad that Stanford
chose to involve itself in a subject
that is not elitist but very brown
bag in terms of the people it af
fects."
