## Spikers set for showdown with No. 1 UCLA No. 2 Stanford travels to L.A. to face 26-0 Bruins 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Without a doubt, this is the biggest
college volleyball match of the year.
Pitting this season's titans against
each other for the Pacific 10 Conference
crown and the bragging rights of being
the best team in the West, the No. 2
Stanford spikers travel to No. 1 UCLA
tonight before facing 13th-ranked USC
tomorrow. The action will be broadcast
live from Pauley Pavilion on KZSU FM
-90.1 starting at 6:45 pm.
"We're looking forward to this game,"
Stanford Coach Don Shaw said. "It'll
be a big crowd — they'll probably have
5,000 people down there, I would imag
ine, in Pauley. Prime Ticket television
is going to cover it, tape-delay. It's going
to be fun — we haven't seen a little of
that for a while."
Stanford enters tonight's match
riding the wave of the longest winning
streak in school history. This past week
end's pair of victories against Oregon
and Oregon State extended the string
to 20, upping the record to 25-1 overall
and 15-1 in Pac-10 play.
The loss? That's right: UCLA. The
Bruins left the Farm in early September
with a fairly easy win, and have not
slowed down since. UCLA now holds
the Pac-10 record for straight wins at
26 overall, 16 in the league, without a
single loss blemishing its record.
Enter the Cardinal, a team that in
the past few months has just refused
to lose. Even with their backs against
the wall several times of late — most
recently Saturday night, when Oregon
put Stanford at a two-games-to-one dis
advantage before the host team battled
back to win — the spikers have managed
to get the job done.
Is the Cardinal ready this time
around?
"I hope so," Shaw replied. "As a coach,
you never think you're ready. I'm still
losing sleep over whether we're going
to play well enough. But this team has
had a tendency to play well when they've
had to, and I'm just looking forward to
going down there and just turning them
loose.
"We're just going to go out there and
go for it, and see how we stack up at
this point in time knowing that we're
going to have to play them again most

likely in the playoffs. This will be a
good measuring stick to see where we
are and see if we have what it takes to
win the championship."
At least tonight, what the Cardinal
will need most of ail is a strong defense
and consistent passing. UCLA has been
hitting like a team possessed, rating
first in the league and ninth in the
nation in attack percentage, and could
do serious damage to Stanford on all
sides if the Bruin offense is allowed to
run out of Cardinal control.
Especially deadly is junior middle
blocker Daiva Tomkus, a first-team All-
American last year and a lock for Pac
-10, if not NCAA, Player of the Year.
Tomkus leads the conference with a
stellar .403 hitting percentage and tops
the Bruins in five statistical categories.

California 7-9 19-11
Washington St. 5-11 22-15
Oregon 2-15 8-18
Oregon St. 1-16 12-23

But the valuable stat the last time
Stanford met UCLA was digs. Tomkus
accumulated 16 in September, passing
well enough to give All-America setter
Ann Boyer a full range of offensive op
tions.
At least lately, Stanford has not been
so lucky. The Cardinal's passing has
been shaky at times, forcing setters Lara
Asper and Karen Anderson to continu
ally set left-side hitters Kristin Klein
and Amy Hayes.
"We're going to have to pass well,
we're going to have to serve tough and
probably have to side-out real well,"
Shaw said. "We can put a little pressure
on them and not give them points with
the ease that they're used to getting
them.
"They've been rolling over opponents

and haven't really been pushed or pres
sured all year long. If we play well,
that'll be plenty of pressure for them.
We'll see how they react to that."
The Bruins will also need to deal with
Stanford's star right-side hitter and
Pac-10 Player of the Week Jennifer
Chaffee, a player who just can do no
wrong. In every aspect of her game and
especially her hitting, the junior has
consistently excelled and has pulled the
Cardinal through many tough matches.
Coupled with Klein, the Cardinal's
leading hitter and a clear choice for
national Freshman of the Year, Chaffee
poses a definite threat as a right-side
and back-row option for a good-passing
Stanford team.
"After tonight, we'll be ready," said
Chaffee before last night's practice.
"We're going to go down there and go
after them. We've got nothing to lose
— they re No. i ana we're No. 2 in the
rankings, not that the rankings matter.
The Pac-10 championship is on the line,
and we've got some things to prove."
"We didn't really give them a game
when they played here in September,"
Shaw recalled. "We're going to give
them something to think about."
Card notes
Here's the scoop on the Pac-10 title race:
Assuming that both teams will win their
Friday night matches (Stanford over USC,
UCLA over Cal), UCLA has a one-game lead
going into tonight's match-up.
If UCLA wins, the Bruins will claim the
conference crown outright. Along with the
automatic NCAA berth that the league
champion earns, UCLA will most likely also
get the right to host the West Regional and
gain a home-court advantage for the Final
Four qualifier.
Should Stanford emerge victorious, how
ever, the teams will be named co-champions
of the Pac-10, giving each team its second
title in three years.
To determine who receives the automatic
bid, the league has decreed the following:
according to this week's press release, "the
tie will be broken by first comparing the
games won against each other, then points
won against each other, game-winning per
centage in Pac-10 play, points winning per
centage in Pac-10 play and, finally, a coin
toss."
If all else fails, the two coaches fight
Tyson. Whoever lasts longer gets the berth.

But the valuable stat the last time
Stanford met UCLA was digs. Tomkus
accumulated 16 in September, passing
well enough to give All-America setter
Ann Boyer a full range of offensive op
tions.
At least lately, Stanford has not been
so lucky. The Cardinal's passing has
been shaky at times, forcing setters Lara
Asper and Karen Anderson to continu
ally set left-side hitters Kristin Klein
and Amy Hayes.
"We're going to have to pass well,
we're going to have to serve tough and
probably have to side-out real well,"
Shaw said. "We can put a little pressure
on them and not give them points with
the ease that they're used to getting
them.
"They've been rolling over opponents

and haven't really been pushed or pres
sured all year long. If we play well,
that'll be plenty of pressure for them.
We'll see how they react to that."
The Bruins will also need to deal with
Stanford's star right-side hitter and
Pac-10 Player of the Week Jennifer
Chaffee, a player who just can do no
wrong. In every aspect of her game and
especially her hitting, the junior has
consistently excelled and has pulled the
Cardinal through many tough matches.
Coupled with Klein, the Cardinal's
leading hitter and a clear choice for
national Freshman of the Year, Chaffee
poses a definite threat as a right-side
and back-row option for a good-passing
Stanford team.
"After tonight, we'll be ready," said
Chaffee before last night's practice.
"We're going to go down there and go
after them. We've got nothing to lose
— they re No. i ana we're No. 2 in the
rankings, not that the rankings matter.
The Pac-10 championship is on the line,
and we've got some things to prove."
"We didn't really give them a game
when they played here in September,"
Shaw recalled. "We're going to give
them something to think about."
Card notes
Here's the scoop on the Pac-10 title race:
Assuming that both teams will win their
Friday night matches (Stanford over USC,
UCLA over Cal), UCLA has a one-game lead
going into tonight's match-up.
If UCLA wins, the Bruins will claim the
conference crown outright. Along with the
automatic NCAA berth that the league
champion earns, UCLA will most likely also
get the right to host the West Regional and
gain a home-court advantage for the Final
Four qualifier.
Should Stanford emerge victorious, how
ever, the teams will be named co-champions
of the Pac-10, giving each team its second
title in three years.
To determine who receives the automatic
bid, the league has decreed the following:
according to this week's press release, "the
tie will be broken by first comparing the
games won against each other, then points
won against each other, game-winning per
centage in Pac-10 play, points winning per
centage in Pac-10 play and, finally, a coin
toss."
If all else fails, the two coaches fight
Tyson. Whoever lasts longer gets the berth.

Freshman Kristin Klein leads the Cardinal volleyball team against first-ranked and
undefeated UCLA tonight !n Pauley Pavilion.
Without a doubt, this is the biggest
college volleyball match of the year.
Pitting this season's titans against
each other for the Pacific 10 Conference
crown and the bragging rights of being
the best team in the West, the No. 2
Stanford spikers travel to No. 1 UCLA
tonight before facing 13th-ranked USC
tomorrow. The action will be broadcast
live from Pauley Pavilion on KZSU FM
-90.1 starting at 6:45 pm.
"We're looking forward to this game,"
Stanford Coach Don Shaw said. "It'll
be a big crowd — they'll probably have
5,000 people down there, I would imag
ine, in Pauley. Prime Ticket television
is going to cover it, tape-delay. It's going
to be fun — we haven't seen a little of
that for a while."
Stanford enters tonight's match
riding the wave of the longest winning
streak in school history. This past week
end's pair of victories against Oregon
and Oregon State extended the string
to 20, upping the record to 25-1 overall
and 15-1 in Pac-10 play.
The loss? That's right: UCLA. The
Bruins left the Farm in early September
with a fairly easy win, and have not
slowed down since. UCLA now holds
the Pac-10 record for straight wins at
26 overall, 16 in the league, without a
single loss blemishing its record.
Enter the Cardinal, a team that in
the past few months has just refused
to lose. Even with their backs against
the wall several times of late — most
recently Saturday night, when Oregon
put Stanford at a two-games-to-one dis
advantage before the host team battled
back to win — the spikers have managed
to get the job done.
Is the Cardinal ready this time
around?
"I hope so," Shaw replied. "As a coach,
you never think you're ready. I'm still
losing sleep over whether we're going
to play well enough. But this team has
had a tendency to play well when they've
had to, and I'm just looking forward to
going down there and just turning them
loose.
"We're just going to go out there and
go for it, and see how we stack up at
this point in time knowing that we're
going to have to play them again most

likely in the playoffs. This will be a
good measuring stick to see where we
are and see if we have what it takes to
win the championship."
At least tonight, what the Cardinal
will need most of ail is a strong defense
and consistent passing. UCLA has been
hitting like a team possessed, rating
first in the league and ninth in the
nation in attack percentage, and could
do serious damage to Stanford on all
sides if the Bruin offense is allowed to
run out of Cardinal control.
Especially deadly is junior middle
blocker Daiva Tomkus, a first-team All-
American last year and a lock for Pac
-10, if not NCAA, Player of the Year.
Tomkus leads the conference with a
stellar .403 hitting percentage and tops
the Bruins in five statistical categories.
