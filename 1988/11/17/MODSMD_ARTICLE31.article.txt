# Richardson decimates offenses
## 
### Doug Boeschen Staff writer 
In Shatter, a small town just 15 miles
from Bakersfield, CA, you are "expected
to play football." So that's what Kevin
Richardson did. Now, in his final year
of Cardinal football, No. 46 is wrecking
opposing offenses and has become the
hero of little Shafter. While his days of
high school football may be long past,
Richardson is still largely the "down
home" boy that grew up in that small
farming community.
Although most people know that the
225-pound Richardson is a great football
player, few people know that the inside
linebacker is most comfortable sitting
behind the wheel of his Chevy truck,
wearing cowboy boots, and listening to
the tunes of Hank Williams Jr. blasting
from 12-inch speakers.
If this sounds like a "good ol* boy"
from the farm — it is. It has earned
Richardson the nickname "Shafter"
after the town he so obviously repre
sents. And Richardson is quick to admit
his small-town origins.

"I look up at the stadium stands and
I realize that more people are sitting
in one section than are in my whole
town," he says with a smile.
But he is very glad to be here. Coming
from a conservative small town, Rich
ardson didn't know what to expect. The
Bay Area was a shocking introduction
to different cultures and attitudes.
"Where I'm from people think they
know everything and when I got here
I realized I didn't know anything," he
admits. He remembers that it was frus
trating at first, but it was "good to see
some different things."
A very straightforward person, Rich
ardson thinks this may be his biggest
problem. "I guess I don't B.S. people
enough." He says that Shafter was a
very open and straightforward place. If
you liked someone, you told them, and
if you didn't, you told them anyway.
This openness is reflected in the sup
port he receives from his friends and
family. He has a very close-knit family
and has always counted on their sup
port. Richardson says he still keeps close
contact with many of his high school

friends. This friendship is evident a:i he
says that about 10 of those buddies will
be in the stands on Saturday for his
final game in a Cardinal uniform. Rich
ardson also states that he gets a great
deal of his support from his girlfriend,
Teresa Smith, who was an All-America
volleyball player at Stanford. "She un
derstands athletics and helps me out a
lot," he says.
But it would seem that this gridiron
cowboy doesn't need much help. On the
football field linebacker coach Larry
Kerr describes Richardson as an "in
tense, hard worker." As a dedicated ath
lete he is "in the weight room
year-round and is always out running,"
according to teammate Greg Ennis. He
takes films of opposing teams home
every night and, as a result, is often
making the calls and adjustments for
the defense on the field. Kerr calls Rich
ardson the "key man" in the defense.
This dedication to football is also ob
vious in other ways. Normally amiable
and polite, Richardson becomes a very
