# Coach has destroyed his QBs' confidence
## 
### 
Imagine you are a quarterback.
Imagine you are playing with a
very capable backup waiting to
take over if you can't handle the
job.

Now imagine trying to play
with the knowledge that you may
be yanked after one errant pass.
That's the message that was
sent to Stanford's quarterbacks
last Saturday against UCLA in
Pasadena.
Redshirt freshman Jason
Palumbis has been Stanford's
starter since he replaced sopho
more Brian Johnson after the
fourth game of the season. Car
dinal Coach Jack Elway an
nounced Monday that Pa
lumbis will start Saturday's Big
Game in Berkeley. But Palumbis

can't be comfortable in that po
sition.
You see, Palumbis was pulled
from the UCLA game after com
pleting nine of his first 10 passes.
He was intercepted on his last
throw and Johnson was inserted.
The move surprised everyone.
When I noticed Johnson behind
center, I started clamoring for an
explanation. My first thought was
that Palumbis had been hurt
while my head was turned. But
he seemed fine on the sideline.
And I certainly didn't expect the
change after one misguided pass.
In fact, I'm confident that
either quarterback would have
moved the Cardinal to its first
touchdown after defensive back
Brad Cook's inspiring interception
return.
I'm also certain that a 9-for-lO
quarterback cannot shoulder the
blame for Stanford's inability to
move the football throughout
much of the first half. It's fairly
clear that Palumbis executed
most of the plays that were sent
in to him.
Which brings us back to the
question of why. Why was


ROBERT PORTNOY
Palumbis removed from the
game?
No one knows. Not even Elway.
When asked why he had made the
quarterback change, the coach
replied, "After the interception, I
just wanted to give Johnson a
shot, just so I could have some
thing to think about over the
weekend."
Well, he thought about it over
the weekend, and nothing
changed. Palumbis will start Sat
urday, with all the confidence of
a one-year-old walking on a
freshly waxed linoleum floor.
Quoth Palumbis after Satur
day's benching, "Obviously, Coach
Elway doesn't have any confi
dence in me, or something. He's
the coach, and I guess he decided
he wanted to go with Brian."
Quoth Johnson after playing
Saturday, "I thought (Pa
lumbis) was doing a good job. I
was surprised at the move. But
to tell you the truth, I was sur
prised at the move back at Notre
Dame (when Palumbis replaced

Johnson)."
Does this sound like a stable
situation to you? "The job seems
pretty unstable at this point, and
that's tough," Palumbis said fol
lowing the game.
These poor guys don't know
whether they're coming or going.
If I was surprised by the switch
Saturday, the two QBs were
downright shocked. Johnson was
so dumbfounded at being called
into the game, he couldn't locate
an essential piece of equipment.
"I had a hard time finding my
mouthpiece. It was in my sock,"
he said.
Even with Elway's Monday an
nouncement, little seems to have
changed. Elway assured us then
that he has to answer to no one
but himself. In response to the
question of why he had decided
on Palumbis, Elway offered no
clear answer and openly joked
about being asked to explain his
decision.
For all that has gone unex
plained, Palumbis does know one
thing for sure: He is Saturday's
starter. But if Palumbis misfires
on a pass, Johnson had better
know where his mouthpiece is.
