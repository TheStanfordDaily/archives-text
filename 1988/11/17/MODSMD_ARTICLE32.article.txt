# Coach has destroyed his QBs' confidence
## 
### 
Imagine you are a quarterback.
Imagine you are playing with a
very capable backup waiting to
take over if you can't handle the
job.

Now imagine trying to play
with the knowledge that you may
be yanked after one errant pass.
That's the message that was
sent to Stanford's quarterbacks
last Saturday against UCLA in
Pasadena.
Redshirt freshman Jason
Palumbis has been Stanford's
starter since he replaced sopho
more Brian Johnson after the
fourth game of the season. Car
dinal Coach Jack Elway an
nounced Monday that Pa
lumbis will start Saturday's Big
Game in Berkeley. But Palumbis

can't be comfortable in that po
sition.
You see, Palumbis was pulled
from the UCLA game after com
pleting nine of his first 10 passes.
He was intercepted on his last
throw and Johnson was inserted.
The move surprised everyone.
When I noticed Johnson behind
center, I started clamoring for an
explanation. My first thought was
that Palumbis had been hurt
while my head was turned. But
he seemed fine on the sideline.
And I certainly didn't expect the
change after one misguided pass.
In fact, I'm confident that
either quarterback would have
moved the Cardinal to its first
touchdown after defensive back
Brad Cook's inspiring interception
return.
I'm also certain that a 9-for-lO
quarterback cannot shoulder the
blame for Stanford's inability to
move the football throughout
much of the first half. It's fairly
clear that Palumbis executed
most of the plays that were sent
in to him.
Which brings us back to the
question of why. Why was
