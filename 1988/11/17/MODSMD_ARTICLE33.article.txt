# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
What do you do when a water
polo player scores seven goals in
one game — against one of the
nation's top-ranked teams —
nnd an outside linebacker wins
national defensive player-of-the
week honors?
Easy. You make them both
Athletes of the Week. Congrat
ulations are in order for Erik
Blum and Rob Hincklcy. Oh,
and lest we forget the women,
congrats to Jennifer Chaffee.

Blum, a 6-foot-2 junior
holeman from Fullerton, Calif.,
scored an unbelievable eight
goals in fifth-ranked Stanford's
weekend sweep against its
Southern California rivals.
Friday, in knocking off No. 3
USC, Blum pumped in seven
goals — a feat that led Coach
Dante Dettamanti to remark,
"Erik was the story of the
game. ... [It was) one of the
greatest performances I've ever

seen."
Blum buried the Trojans by
scoring the Cardinal's 13th goal
with no time remaining in the
second extra period.
The team followed up the
double-overtime thriller with a
4-3 triumph over No. 2 UCLA
Saturday. In dealing the Bruins
only their second defeat of the
season, Blum tallied yet another
score and added two assists.
Hinckley, a 6-5, 245-pound
junior outside linebacker from
Walnut Creek, Calif., gave UCLA
quarterback Troy Aikman head
aches all day last Saturday.
Hinckley recorded 4Vi sacks
of the Heisman Trophy candi
date among his 20 tackles.
Eleven of those were unassisted
and 6V2 were for losses totaling
38 yards.
For his incredible efforts,
Hinckley was named Defensive
Player of the Week by both
Sports Illustrated and the
Pacific 10 Conference.
Chaffee, a 6-2 junior outside
hitter from Colorado Springs,
Colo., also garnered Pac-10
Player of the Week accolades.
Tuesday, Chaffee recorded 25
kills to lead the Cardinal from
a 2-0 deficit en route to a five

game win over 12th-ranked Uni
versity of the Pacific.
Friday, she added 21 kills in
a four-game win over Oregon
State. Finally, Chaffee put home
19 more in leading the Cardinal
to a five-game victory over
Oregon.
For the week, Chaffee hit an
astonishing .394 and surpassed
her previous career high of 18
kills in all three matches.
