The Stanford men's ultimate
team cruised victoriously
through six games en route to
a first-place finish last week
end at a pre-season collegiate
ultimate tournament hosted by
San Diego State.
After crushing UC-Santa
Barbara for the second time in
24 hours 13-3, Stanford beat
The Nomads, a collegiate team
with no official university af
filiation, 13-10 in the finals
Sunday.
The John "The Truth"
Knuth/Barry Saik combo
singlehandedly dismantled the
Nomads' zone on the first
point. However, the Nomads
came back with three straight
points and led 3-2. It was a
tough fight until Stanford re
taliated with three straight
points to go up 10-7 and sped
to victory from there.
"Almost flawless play by
handlers Knuth, Keith
Sarkisian and Wes Sanford was

key in winning the tourna
ment," according to co-captain
Dave Lipscomb.
Stanford easily beat UCLA
11-3, Cal Tech 11-2 and UCSB
11-5 in the round-robin portion
of the tournament Saturday.
Stanford had its toughest
match against San Diego State,
the first game of the day,
beating them 11-8. However,
Stanford suffered from a seven
point penalty at the onset of
the game for arriving late.
"The competition really
wasn't that stiff," Lipscomb
said. "Berkeley, Santa Cruz and
Chabot will all provide more
competition in the spring and
Santa Barbara was without its
top four players. We were just
more consistent."
"I do worry that all of our
rookies might get the wrong
idea that this year's team com
pares right now to last year's
37-1 team. We still have a long
way to go," he added.
