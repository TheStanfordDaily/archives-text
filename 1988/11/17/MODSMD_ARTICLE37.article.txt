## 'Three's Company' actor stresses ease of job 
### Raoul Mowatt 
Perhaps freshman Jack Gauld
put it best, saying "I came here
just because he was Mr. Angelino
on "Three's Company," but actu
ally, he was really informative."
In fact, "Mr. Angelino" is only
one of the many faces of Jordan
Charney, a character actor who
discussed his wide-ranging back
ground Tuesday.
Addressing about 40 people in
Branner Lounge, Charney opened
by stating, "Chances are that all
of you have seen me at one time
or another; you just don't realise
it." Charney's credentials include
roles in soap operas, commercials,
movies such as "Ghostbusters"
and "Network" and classical
theater. Currently, he is the ar
tistic director for a repertory com
pany.
According to Charney, "Acting
is very simple. You have an in
tention to do something, and then
you create an obstacle that

prevents you, and then you un
cover the results." He said too
many people forget this type of
fundamental principle when act
ing.
Charney also tried to eliminate
some stereotypes about his pro
fession. For instance, he denied
that most actors could pick and
choose their roles. "If you just
think about stars, TV stars who
had their own series, often you
don't see them any more. And
you won't see them. It's not that
they aren't talented. It's just that
there isn't any place for them to
g0.... You are very grateful for
the job."
While playing Jack Tripper's
boss in the series, Charney had
a recurring line: angrily yelling,
"Tripper!" He recreated that line
for the audience to contrast it to
a reading from Shakespeare's
"Richard III," showing his versa
tility as an actor and getting a
big laugh from the crowd.
