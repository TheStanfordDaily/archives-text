# TA cutbacks not a national trend

While teaching assistants here
receive comparable salaries to TAs
at similar universities, they are
in charge of more students and
did not get a pay increase this
year, as did TAs at the other
schools.
Due to budgetary cuts in the
School of Humanities and
Sciences, the school's departments
are receiving less funding. Conse
quently, TAs this year have not
gotten a raise. In the past several
years, TA funding here has in
creased annually by at least 6 per
cent.
However, at universities such
as Brown, Duke, Harvard, North
western, Princeton, UC-Berkeley,
UCLA and the University of Mich
igan, TA salaries continue to rise.
At all eight schools, the salaries
have increased over the past
several years.
At Berkeley, Princeton and
UCLA, salaries have generally in
creased at the same rate as faculty
salaries.
Leigh DeNeef, associate dean of
the graduate school at Duke, said
TA salaries there have increased
in recent years because the de
partments "saw they were not
competitive and asked the univer
sity to raise them."
For a Stanford TA, the Univer
sity mandated minimum salary is

$8,650 per year.
This figure places Stanford
about in the middle of the eight
schools surveyed. Salaries at
Princeton, Harvard, UCLA and
Berkeley are higher while at
Brown, Northwestern and Michi
gan, salaries are lower.
However, TAs here are respon
sible for a substantially greater
number of students than their
counterparts at other schools.
At Stanford, the policy in Hu
manities and Science requires
that a course have a minimum
enrollment of 35 students before
a professor can request TA fund
ing, according to Nancy Padgett,
a Humanities and Sciences finan
cial official.
This does not mean that a pro
fessor needs a minimum of 70
students to request two TAs.
Once the money has been al
lotted, there are no set guidelines
for the number of students in a
TA section. These decisions are
up to the particular departments
and faculty members, Padgett
said.
At Princeton, the average sec
tion there has about 13 to 15
students, Redman said. "It is the
sense of the faculty that sections
should never be more than 18,"
he said, adding that Princeton
TAs are never responsible for
more than 30 to 35 students each
