# Oski to say goodbye
## Mascot announces return to Cal after game 
### DJ Berinstein Staff writer 
Oski the Bear's whereabouts
may soon be discovered.
Oski, the UC-Berkeley mascot
that was stolen from Cal over two
years ago, allegedly wrote a letter
received by the Stanford Univer
sity News Service yesterday, ex
plaining that he "has had a great
time on the Farm, but I think
it's about time to go back. While
I've been away, Cal has fallen from
7th to 24th in the U.S. News and
World Report survey."
The letter continued, "If I stay
away any longer, it may become
a junior college."
Included with the letter to Stan
ford News was a photocopied pic
ture of a large fuzzy creature with
a copy of Sunday's San Fransisco
Examiner pinned to its chest.
The Stanford Axe Committee,
in charge of Big Game festivities,
claimed to know nothing about
the letter or of Oski's where
abouts over the past two years.
"The traditional line from the
Axe Committee has always been
'no comment,"' said an alumnus
member of the committee.
"Who is Oski?" one freshman
on the committee asked.
Acting Axe Committee Chair
Rob Eno said the committee will
try to monitor the situation, add
ing that Oski might reappear at
the Bonfire tonight.
Last week, Berkeley students
placed a second bear on Sand Hill
Road near Stanford in prepara
tion for Saturday's Big Game, but

soon the bear vanished. One Axe
Committee member said he hopes
that the two bears are not "off
mating somewhere. Then those
poor Cal people will have to build
extra, smaller cases to contain all
those baby bears."
Oski's immediate plans are to
stay "one last weekend, celebrate
Stanford's victory over Cal and
then go home."
Bonfire note
The traditional Bonfire ceremo
nies will undergo a small change
this year due to mud and swamp
problems at Lake Lagunita. The
Band will lead students from
Gaieties to the steps of the Book
store, where the rally will take
place. It had been scheduled to be
held in Lag's lake bed. From the
Bookstore, the Band will lead stu
dents to the lake's periphery, but
students will not be allowed into
the lake bed near the Bonfire.
