# Broder proposes government intervention in campaigns

### John Wagner Staff writer 
Asserting that the campaign
season "must belong to the
voters," Pulitzer Prize-winning
political journalist David Broder
proposed several presidential cam
paign reforms in a speech he gave
Tuesday night to a near-capacity
crowd at Kresge Auditorium.
Broder's suggested reforms in
cluded:
• The availability of weekly 10-
minute segments on network tele
vision for candidates to address
particular issues;
• A legislative stipulation that
would require campaign adver
tisements to be viewed at a press
conference at which a campaign
representative would be present
to verify facts presented in the
ad; and
• legislation that would make
the reception of public campaign
funds contingent on the candi
dates' participation in debates.
The suggested reforms, Broder
said, would give the press more
"leverage" in forcing candidates
to fully explicate their stands on
issues.

"We have to challenge the as
sumption of the candidates and
their managers that they have the
exclusive right to determine how,
when and where the candidates
are seen and questioned," Broder
said.
Broder is the national political
correspondent for The Washing
ton Post and a nationally
syndicated columnist. In 1973, he
won the Pulitzer Prize for distin
guished commentary.
In an interview with The Daily
following his speech, Broder ex
plained that if, beginning after
Labor Day, the networks would
invite the candidates to appear on
their main news program once a
week, "neither campaign would
refuse."
"If the networks opened up
those long boxes of time," Broder
said, "candidates would not have
any choice (but) to talk discur
sively about a subject for 10
minutes."
These longer appearances, he
said, would give voters a "very
different impression of what the
candidates think, what they know
and what they would do."
If the networks balk at volun

tarily creating these time seg
ments, Broder said he would see
"nothing objectionable" about
Congress, by legislation, allocat
ing a portion of the money from
public campaign funds for the
purchase of the extended network
time blocks.
The federal government all
ocates millions of dollars in public
funds to the two parties'
presidential candidates, a reform
that was part of the Federal Elec
tion Campaign Act of 1974.
The format for the weekly net
work time segment could be de
termined by a bipartisan commis
sion, Broder said, much in the
same way a two-party commission
derived the formats for this year's
presidential debates. If candidates
opt not to appear in a segment,
they would be penalized by the
forfeit of their time to their op
ponents, Broder said.
In his speech, Broder also
asserted that presidential candi
dates should be required by law
to participate in debates during
the campaign season if they ex
pect to collect public campaign
