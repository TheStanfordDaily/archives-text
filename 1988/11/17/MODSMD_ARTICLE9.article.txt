# Doctor scorns minority isolation

Minority students should not is
olate themselves from other cul
tures, said a clinical psychiatrist
Tuesday night at Okada House in
a discussion with Asian-American
students.
At an event sponsored by the
Asian-American Student Associa
tion as part of a weekly series
about the Asian-Amercian exper
ience, Frank Matsumoto, a psy
chiatrist at the Stanford Medical
Center, gave a lecture about the
difficulties of assimilating into
American culture.
Matsumoto said minority stu
dents should "take to heart the
enormous cultural gifts" they pos
sess through their heritage, but
should also identify themselves
with "all the cultural groups
[students] represent."
Culture cannot only be defined
in terms of ethnicity, but also in
a wide range of categories, he ex
plained. "The greatest cultural
jump can be the perspective of a
fat person vs. someone who is not
fat It can be a completely dif
ferent world."

Matsumoto said Asian and
Western values differ in the ways
the two cultures raise their
children. "The average American
family wants the child to grow up
and leave the house ... become
a rugged individual," Matsumoto
said.
Asian cultures do not place such
a premium on independence. The
Japanese, for example, have a con
cept of "passive love" in which
the children expect "the right to
be unconditionally loved and
taken care of," he said. This de
pendence on the parents lasts into
young adulthood and leads many
Japanese to "feel helpless," Mat
sumoto said.
On the other hand, "the average
American feels embarrassed by
that thought. Pride is not having
to run to Mom and Dad," he said.
Asian Americans face difficulty
relating to their parents because
of the conflicting desires of loyalty
to their family and of indepen
dence.
A Korean student attending the
discussion said his parents tell
him stories about their lives dur
ing the Korean War to urge him
to study harder. "They always

remind me 'You got Walkmans
while we walked miles to sell pen
cils,' " he said.
The student said Asians view
the world like a circle, in which
everyone is linked and therefore
interdependent. Any attempt to
express individuality is seen as a
betrayal of that system, he said.
A Vietnamese student said pres
sures by Asian parents place a
"weight of guilt" on children,
which "becomes a negative thing."
She said that sometimes when she
argues with her parents and tells
them a decision they made is not
fair, her parents respond, "Fair is
a Western idea. Morality and tra
dition are more important."
Matsumoto also related his ex
periences growing up in Chicago
during World War 11. His father
had a panel of Japanese callig
raphy hung over an archway in
their home. The panel could be
seen from the street through the
window, however, and Matsumoto
urged his father to take it down.
Matsumoto said, "My dad was a
proud man," but he understood
the necessity to hide their
Japanese ethnicity.
