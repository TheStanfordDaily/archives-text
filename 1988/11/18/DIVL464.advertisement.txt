• It's never been difficult for students to
convince their parents of the need for a
Macintosh* computer at school.
Persuading them to write the check,
however, is another thing altogether.
Which is why Apple created the Student
Loan-to-Own Program. An ingenious loan
program that makes buying a
Macintosh as easy as using one.
Simply pick up an application
at the location listed below, or
call 800-831-LOAN. All your
parents need to do is
fill it out, sign it, and
send it. If they quality, they'll receive a
check for you in just a few weeks.
There's no collateral. No need to prove
financial hardship. No application fee.
Best of all, the loan payments can be
spread over as many as 10 years.
Which gives you and your parents
plenty of time to decide just who pays for
it all. ,
