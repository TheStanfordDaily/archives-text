# Ethicist to discuss nuclear weapons

"We threaten evil in order not
to do it, and the doing of it would
be so terrible, that the threat seems
in comparison to be morally defen
sible. n
— Michael Walzer
For almost everyone, the chal
lenge to control and harness
atomic power provokes ethical
consideration of the consequences
of developing earth-threatening
weapons. For some, including pro
fessors at Stanford and other
universities, these moral issues
are more than topics for after
dinner conversation; they are the
subject of serious scholarship and
probing debate.
One such scholar, Father J.
Bryan Hehir, will address these
questions tonight in a lecture at

Terman Auditorium.
According to Hehir, a professor
of ethics at Georgetown Univer
sity, the public involvement in the
nuclear debate is greater in this
decade than ever before, joining
close scrutiny of the morality be
hind nuclear weapons develop
ment and control with the
standard political and strategic
considerations.
Hehir, also secretary of the De
partment of Social Development
and World Peace of the U.S. Cath
olic Conference, will give his lec
ture entitled "The Changing
Shape of the Nuclear Debate" at
8:00 p.m. tonight. The appear
ance, sponsored by Stanford's
Center for International Security
and Arms Control (CISAC), is
open to the public and admission
is free. The Center, of which Hehir
is a member, works to promote

understanding and study of the
complex issues of conflict and
peace.
The subject of Hehir's address
tonight, and his call for greater
moral influence in nuclear policy,
find various degrees of support
on campus.
Prof. Steven Krasner, chair of
the Political Science Department,
sees the role of ethics in military
strategy somewhat differently
from Hehir.
Concerning the application of
moral considerations in policy
making, he said leaders "cannot
evoke ethical principles without
an analytical view of how things
function." Moral judgments must
be made within a set framework
that dictates the general approach
to finding and evaluating infor-
mation, he said.
Krasner argued that nuclear
weapons have prevented war.
Without them, he said the United
States and the Soviet Union
would start a military confronta
tion much sooner.
He said the situation in the
United States is highly stable, and
will remain so in the future. Kras
ner doubted that economic pres
sure requires cut-backs in the
production of weapons, but said
that the United States has an un
necessary surplus of nuclear
arms.
According to David Bernstein,
associate director of CISAC, ethics
should play a greater role, but the
balance of pragmatism and
morality is sometimes hard to
strike. He agreed with Krasner
the United States has many more
weapons than it needs, emphasiz
ing the necessity to negotiate
agreements to reduce the
numbers.
He underlined the importance
of verification in arms control
agreements, because he said
treaties and the relationships be
tween countries are "not based on
trust." He also said if we reduce
the amount of weapons in our

nuclear arsenal, the probability of
their use may also diminish.
Bob Hamerton-Kelly, the
former dean of the Stanford
Chapel, approaches arms control
with a particular concern for re
flecting religious principles in de
veloping nuclear strategy.
Now head of the ethics division
of CISAC, Hamerton-Kelly sees an
important role for churches and
synagogues in educating the
public about nuclear weaponry
and the arms race. Nonetheless,
he finds reconciling moral prin
ciples and nuclear weapons to be
"highly problematic."
Hamerton-Kelly doubts nuclear
weapons will ever be used in the
future — mainly because of their
menacing and unprecedented
power.
In agreement with Bernstein
and Hamerton-Kelly, Philosophy
Asst. Prof. Deborah Satz consid
ers moral dimensions critical to
decision-making about nuclear
weapons. Satz, who teaches Ethics
in International Relations; Philos
ophy 77, said there is "both a
technical and ethical dimension"
to arms control negotiations. She
said "strategy and policies cannot
replace moral analysis".
Hehir has published numerous
articles on ethics and arms con
trol, is affiliated with many na
tional advisory boards and has
addressed many universities.
