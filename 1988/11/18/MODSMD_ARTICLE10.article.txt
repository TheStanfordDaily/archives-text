"We threaten evil in order not
to do it, and the doing of it would
be so terrible, that the threat seems

â€” Michael Walzer
For almost everyone, the chal
lenge to control and harness
atomic power provokes ethical
consideration of the consequences
of developing earth-threatening
weapons. For some, including pro
fessors at Stanford and other
universities, these moral issues
are more than topics for after
dinner conversation; they are the
subject of serious scholarship and
probing debate.
One such scholar, Father J.
Bryan Hehir, will address these

of ethics at Georgetown Univer

Hehir, also secretary of the De

Shape of the Nuclear Debate" at
8:00 p.m. tonight. The appear

Center for International Security
and Arms Control (CISAC), is
open to the public and admission
is free. The Center, of which Hehir
is a member, works to promote

understanding and study of the
complex issues of conflict and
peace.
The subject of Hehir's address
tonight, and his call for greater
moral influence in nuclear policy,
find various degrees of support
on campus.
Prof. Steven Krasner, chair of
the Political Science Department,
sees the role of ethics in military
strategy somewhat differently
from Hehir.
Concerning the application of
moral considerations in policy
making, he said leaders "cannot
evoke ethical principles without
an analytical view of how things
function." Moral judgments must
be made within a set framework
that dictates the general approach
