American, objectivist Harry
Binswanger attacked American
collectivism and trade protec
tionism in a lecture to the Stan
ford Objectivists Wednesday
night in Jordan Hall.
Binswanger defined collec
tivism as a sort of Soviet-style
economic nationalism. The in
dividuals in society act for the
benefit of the state as a whole.
He added that protectionism
involves placing barriers on the
sale of imported goods to aid
domestic industry.
"The good news is there is
a resurgence in American pa
triotism," said Binswanger.
"The bad news is that this pa
triotism is being exploited by
intellectuals through the 'Buy
American' slogan."
Binswanger spoke for 80
minutes to a predominantly
male audience of about 85. The

speech was sponsored by the
Ayn Rand Institute and the
Stanford Objectivists, a Uni
versity organization interested
in Ayn Rand's philosophy of
objectivism.
The essential tenets of objec
tivism are that reality is objec
tive, reason is man's basic tool
of survival and man is an in
dividual who must control his
own destiny. Laissez-faire
capitalism, in which the eco
nomy is free from government
intervention, is the political im
plementation of these ideals.
"Collectivism is the premise
of the 'Buy American' cam
paign," said Binswanger. "You
can't get more anti-American
than collectivism."
"If you buy an American
product because it is better
made, more reliable or less ex
pensive, that is not what I am
talking about," he added.
"There is no rational or semi
rational case that it helps
America to 'Buy American.' "
