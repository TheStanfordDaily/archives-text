## Fugitive landlady charged Suspect says she cashed checks; denies role in deaths 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - A
landlady suspected of killing seven el
derly tenants at her boardinghouse to
collect their Social Security money said
yesterday she had cashed some checks
but was no killer.
Dorothea Montalvo Puente, who van
ished Saturday after police unearthed
the first body buried in her yard, was
arraigned yesterday but did not enter
a plea.
Clad in an orange jail jumpsuit,
Puente listened quietly as the charge of
one murder count was read and nodded
her head to indicate she wanted a public
defender to represent her.
Asst. District Attorney Dan Kinter
said additional murder charges and spe
cial circumstances would be filed. Spe
cial circumstances mean the penalty
upon conviction could be death or life
in prison without possibility of parole.
The case was continued until Dec. 15
and she was ordered held in jail without
bail.
Puente, 59, was arrested at a down

town Los Angeles motel late Wednesday
after a pensioner she had approached
in a bar became suspicious.
Assistant public defenders Kevin
Clymo and Peter Vlautin, surrounded
by dozens of reporters outside the court
room, questioned the propriety of an
interview Puente gave KCRA-TV while
the jet leased by the station was taking
her and police back to Sacramento early
yesterday.
"I have not killed anyone. I told you
that. I have not killed anyone. The
checks I cashed, yes," Puente told
KCRA-TV reporter Mike Boyd.
Boyd said he didn't ask specific ques
tions about the murders, but only talked
with Puente about general subjects. She
also told Boyd, "I used to be a very
good person at one time."
"It's unheard of that a law enforce
ment agency would team up with a news
organization to transport a person to
jail," Vlautin said.
Puente was put on the jet with detec

tives and the television crew with "no
opportunity to talk to anybody who had
her interests in mind," Clymo said. "At
this time, I do not believe she was given
an opportunity to talk to a lawyer
(before the flight)."
"Our client denies killing anybody.
The true facts will come out in the
courtroom," said Vlautin. "The
Sacramento Police Department has en
listed the aid of the media to create a
circus atmosphere."
Police Chief John Kearns said he did
not learn about the jet arrangements
until yesterday morning.
The matronly ex-convict walked away
from her boarding house Saturday
morning, after the first body was un
earthed by officers.
At that time, police said they didn't
have enough evidence to detain her. But
after the other bodies were discovered,
a murder warrant was issued for Puente
and a search launched in California,
Nevada and Mexico.
