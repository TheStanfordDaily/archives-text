WASHINGTON (AP) - President-elect
George Bush named New Hampshire
Gov. John Sununu as his White House
chief of staff and announced campaign
manager Lee Atwater as his choice to
head the Republican National Committee
yesterday.
The selection of Sununu prompted a
decision by long-time aide Craig Fuller
to leave Bush's service. Fuller had served
as the vice president's chief of staff and
made it clear he wanted the powerful
White House post.
"John Sununu has the background and
experience necessary to work not only
with his former colleagues in the nation's
statehouses but also to build a construc

tive relationship with the U.S. Congress,"
Bush said.
He said the outgoing three-term gover
nor's background as an engineer, college
professor, small businessman and gover
nor "will bring a refreshing new perspec
tive that in my view is critical. He is the
right man in the job."
"I'm eager to take up the challenge. It
is going to be a very important, few y<*wrs."
the new chief of staff told reporters.
Sununu's selection appeared to fuel the
departure of Fuller.
In a telephone interview, Fuller said
he told Bush in October that "I wanted
to return to the private sector." But he
said he also told Bush during that con

versation that "obviously, I would be
eager" to serve as chief of staff, often
called the second most powerful position

in the White House.
Fuller, who served as
Bush's vice presidential
chief of staff since 1985,
said he will resign when
Bush's transition is com
pleted in January.
Sununu, credited with
engineering Bush's New
Hampshire primary win,
brings to the job a repu-

tation as an aggressive, hands-on mana
ger.
His appointment cheered conservatives,

but worried some on Capitol Hill as well
as Jewish leaders. He was the only one
of 50 governors who refused to back a
statement denouncing a United Nations
resolution that equated Zionism with rac
ism.
He said he would remain governor
through his term, which ends Jan. 5. But
he said he would continue to consult with
Bush's transition team.
As Bush's choice, Atwater was certain
to be elected to succeed Frank Fah
renkopf as chairman of the Republican
Party. Fahrenkopf is a 48-year-old Reno
lawyer whose seven years in the post
make him the longest-serving GOP chief
in this century.

"I expect the party to move forward
and grow. I will strongly recommend to
members of the national committee Lee
Atwater to become the chairman," said
Bush, describing Atwater as a master of
grassroots politics.
"He's a friend; I'm proud of his ac
complishments," Bush said of the man
who helped orchestrate his presidential
victory
Atwater, 37, is a South Carolina native
who earlier served as an aide to President
Reagan and also worked for Sen. Strom
Thurmond of South Carolina. After the
1984 election, Atwater became a partner
in the lobbying firm of Black, Manafort
& Stone.
