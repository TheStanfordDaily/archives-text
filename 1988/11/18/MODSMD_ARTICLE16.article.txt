Britian expels 3 Iraqi diplomats
LONDON (AP) — A Foreign Office spokesman
said last night that Britain expelled three mem
bers of the Iraqi Embassy in London for activities
incompatible with their status, a diplomatic ex
pression for spying.
Iraq retaliated by expelling three members of
the British Embassy in Baghdad and the three
Britons have returned home, he said.
The spokesman, who in accordance with British
practice refused to let his name be used, said
the Iraqis were told on Oct. 18 they must leave
and were given two weeks to do so. "I believe
they have left," he said.
No immediate explanation was offered as to
why the announcement of the expulsions was
delayed until last night, 16 days after the Nov.
1 expiration of the time limit set for the departure
of the three Iraqis.
Germans acquit ex-Gestapo chief
BONN, West Germany (AP) — A former Nazi
was acquitted yesterday of complicity in the mur
der of 177 French Jews sent to Auschwitz, a
verdict that drew shouts of "Nazi murderer!"
from victims' relatives and spectators.
Count Modest Korff was accused of ordering

the deportations of Jews from the Chalons-sur-
Marne region of northeastern France, where he
served as Gestapo chief in 1942 and 1943.
State Court Judge Martin Lickfett said the
five-member panel decided there was insufficient
evidence to tie Korff to the deaths of 177 people
he was accused of deporting.
"The proceedings were interrupted by shouts
of 'Nazi murderer!' and 'this is a Nazi court!'"
said a court spokeswoman, Eva Marie Zakosek-
Ruehling.
The acquittal follows a period of extreme sen
sitivity over Germany's Nazi past after last
week's 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, when
Nazi thugs destroyed Jewish homes and busi
nesses and beat up Jews.
PTL must be sold soon — or else
COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A U.S. Bankruptcy
judge yesterday rejected two offers for the PTL
ministry, ordered bidding to "start from scratch"
and said he'd liquidate the evangelical empire if
the sale is not completed by Dec. 13.
"It's either then or nothing," Judge Rufus
Reynolds said.
The judge directed PTL bankruptcy trustee
M.C. "Red" Benton to draft guidelines for pro
spective buyers that incorporate certain condi
tions he previously set forth.
