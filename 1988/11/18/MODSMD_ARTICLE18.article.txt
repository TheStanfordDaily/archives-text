### 
SPOON keeps food
from going to waste in
Food Service dumpster

Heaps of mashed pota
toes, platefuls of roasted
turkey, sweet cranberry
sauce, pumpkin pie topped with
ice cream . . . and the delectable
list goes on.
Just around the corner is the
holiday of consumption, Thanks
giving. But while some are eating
to their hearts content, other are
going hungry. More than 20 mil
lion Americans suffer from hunger
each month, and 10 percent of Bay
Area residents will rely on hunger
relief programs this year, accord
ing to statistics from Palo Alto's
urban ministry.
But some Stanford students are
making a dent in the hunger prob
lem. At least 50 students are now
participating in the Stanford Proj
ect on Nutrition. SPOON delivers
leftovers — that would have other
wise gone into the trash — to the
hungry and homeless of Palo Alto.
SPOON's food feeds an esti
mated 60 people a week, with lef
tovers now coming from about 23
different self-ops, co-ops eating
clubs and Stanford fraternities.
But so much potential exists for
more student participation. Still,
leftovers from several campus res
idences that could go to the needy
are ending up in the garbage. This
food should not go to waste; start
making a difference and participate

in SPOON.
And what better time than the
holidays to start up the project in
your own residence? To join in the
effort, contact SPOON through the
Public Service Center at 725-1488.
Though only a year old, SPOON
has made a difference. Through
the students' initiative, University
Food Service has agreed to partic
ipate in the program. All leftovers
from Branner Hall now go to
SPOON. Within the next year,
Food Service might start up the
program in Lagunita Hall as well.
Over the holiday, take some time
out and learn how precious a com
modity food really is.
Volunteer to serve a meal to the
homeless of Palo Alto on Thanks
giving day. Captain Cosmos, a res
taurant in Palo Alto, is offering a
free, traditional Thanksgiving to
the needy. The restaurant needs
volunteers from 10 a.m. until 3
p.m. to help make and serve sand
wiches. Volunteers are also needed
the Tuesday and Wednesday nights
before Thanksgiving. To sign up
and help, call the Stanford Volun
teer Network at 723-0054.
Furthermore, SPOON and the
Stanford International Develop
ment Organization are co
sponsoring a fast on Dec. 1 to in
crease awareness about hunger is
sues and to raise money for inter
national and domestic hunger
relief agencies.
Sensitivity should extend beyond
the holidays. But why not use the
season as a first step for reaching
out to the less fortunate?
