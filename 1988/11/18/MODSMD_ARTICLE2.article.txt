# Panel says the press ignores minorities

Stories about minorities are
largely ignored by most news or
ganizations because they lack mi
nority editors and publishers, a
panel of experts on Latinos and
the media concluded yesterday.
"Unless you teach Anglo [jour
nalism] students how to perceive
minority stories, they won't be
able to deal with minority issues,"
said Mercedes Lynn de Uriarte, a
journalism professor at the Uni
versity of Texas.
Over 40 people heard de Uriarte
and four others at El Centro dis
cuss the media's portrayal of
Latinos, and other minorities, lo
cally and nationally and how the
coverage affects viewers and
readers.
Sandra Close, editor of the
Pacific News service, said there
is "a gap in media coverage of
minority issues." This inadequacy
stems from the lack of minority
journalists covering such events,
she said, noting that the media
establishment holds the naive
belief that "the people make the
event rather at the elite."
Echoing Close, Rigo Chacon, a
news bureau chief at KGO-TV in
San Francisco, said that although
all reporters must attempt to be
objective, "minority reporters will
respond with both objectivity and
sensitivity." While reporters
"can't take a side based on eth

nicity," he said, they must realize
that it is easy to incorrectly
portray minorities in their stories.
According to Frank Del Olino,
a Pulitzer Prize-winning colum
nist at the Los Angeles Times,
the people who decide what con
stitutes a story is often a group
of "a dozen white men." He
asserted the need to get minority
input into the process of decision
making. The "most common type
of journalism is reactive, rather
than 'proactive,' " he said, point
ing out the need for journalists
to explore the issues that directly
affect minorities and that would
not normally be considered
"newsworthy."
According to de Uriarte, a story
is deemed newsworthy by the sub
jective determination of an editor.
This decision directly "has to do
with cultural perspective," she
said.
Sergio Guerrero, associate pro
ducer of ABC's Nightline, said
there is a need to have minorities
in high positions throughout the
media in order to "shake the sen
sibilities of the decision makers."
He also noted that "high-powered
media is incestuous," meaning
that stories, and consequently
decision-making, often echo from
one organization to another. The
evening news programs often look
at newspapers for their
story ideas, he said, and this re
lationship feeds on itself, creating
a uniform notion of news.
