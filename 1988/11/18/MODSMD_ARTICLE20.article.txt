## Censorship of the Right 
### 
I disapprove of what you say, but I will
defend to the death your right to say it.
— Voltaire
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, while
hardly alone in academe, has suf
fered a recent rash of censorship by
the Left of the Right. In the spring of
1987, a student referendum repulsed the
proposed Ronald W. Reagan Library. This
year the ASSU Senate effectively barred
contra leader Adolfo Calero from Stan
ford. Finally, this Monday, pro-choice
demonstrators verbally, then physically,
disrupted a campus address by Operation
Rescue founder Randall Terry.
Before moving on, let's be crystal clear
on a point or three. I strongly oppose
the philosophies of Reagan, Calero and
Terry. Most students do. But students
also must resist the temptation to deny
a forum to a viewpoint simply because
they find it wrong.
Stanford students, whom none can ac
cuse of adoring the President, drove the
Reagan Library from campus back in
1987, even after the search committee
agreed not to build a conservative think
tank next door to it. In doing so, they
believed they had thumbed their noses
at What Reagan Represents, whatever
that might be: "We don't want to be
stigmatized — to be associated, even sym
bolically, with Ronald Reagan."
Sadly, though, the referendum also
banished millions in apolitical historical
materials: free books. Even more sadly
for those who believe Reagan to be a
bumbler at best and a crook at worst,
the vote blew Stanford's chance to house

Reagan's papers when they are released
early in the 21st century. Smart liberals,
eager to pore over Ronnie's doodle pads
for hard evidence of idiocy and
criminality, voted to bring that library
here, notwithstanding its ephemeral
Reagan stigma.
Like all censors, those ASSU senators
who voted to bar the use of ASSU monies
for bringing contra honcho Adolfo Calero
to campus, began the defense of their
action by claiming not to be censors. The
contras, they aver, form an internation
ally recognized terrorist squad; Calero is
simply trying to sucker college students
and grab money for his thugs; and, since
Nicaraguan officials are barred from the
U.S., no one of Calero's stature could be
found to debate him.
To the first point: some see the contras
as terrorists and some, including Demo
crats like Bill Bradley, D-N.J., do not.
No meaningful consensus exists. It seems
safe to assume, for the sake of compar
ison, that the same senators would have
little trouble in inviting Yasser Arafat,
whose violence (whether justified or "ter
rorist") is viewed as leftist where that of
the contras is seen as rightist.
Second: the $4,000 Calero would have
received from the Speakers Bureau could
not have gone far in fueling the contra
army. Contrast this with the $8,000 given
Dr. Ruth and $11,000 given Nicholas
Daniloff. Calero's a bargain.
Third: If the Ortega brothers can't fly
up to debate Calero, then get Oscar Arias.
Jerry Brown. Mario Cuomo. Rest as
sured, contra opponents of high stature
would line up for the chance to debate

the contra leader. Not only, then, is the
argument — that no person of Calero's
fame could be brought to debate him —
irrelevant to the issue of his speaking
here, it is also demonstrably false.
Like the loss of the library, the loss of
Calero ought to be most disappointing
not to conservatives but rather to liberals.
For a measly $4,000, they could have
seen Calero debated into humiliation.
This Monday provided a final illustra
tion of Stanford's intolerance for the
Right. In brief, some pro-choice demon
strators used verbal and physical intim
idation to disrupt a speech by Randall
Terry, founder of the controversial
abortion-clinic-blockers, Operation Res
cue. Again, this censorship of the Right
proved unnecessary. The rescuers cannot
confirm any fetuses "saved" as yet, and
Terry undermined his own position as
"pro-life" by telling the San Jose Mercury
News that rapists should be castrated
and shot.
Worse, like the rejection of Calero and
the library, it backfired on the Left by
illustrating their opposition to the same
free speech they fought so hard to win,
now that the Right attempts to employ
it as well.
