## Pro-choice protesters inhibited academic freedom 
### 
W'E ARE CONCERNED that the
issues of academic freedom and
justice were not addressed in
the Daily's article (Nov. 15) on the
talk by Randall Terry, founder of
Operation Rescue, held on Nov. 14,
which was sponsored by Stanford
Students for Life.
The invited speaker's academic free
dom was denied by those in attend
ance, who by their chanting and hostil
ity, prevented the planned meeting
from taking place. We are, naturally,
outraged by this inhibition of academic
freedom at a prestigious university.
The invited speaker generously
acceded to the protesters' requests by

responding to questions, almost exclu
sively posed by the pro-choice contin
gent, reported to be about 70 among
an attendance of 350, during the more
than hour-long session.
Stanford Students for Life paid to
have an audio technician and a video
technician present to record the event.
It was intended to record the com
ments of Randall Terry and allow the
audience to provide written questions
which the moderator would pose.
This is common practice in presenta
tions held at Stanford on contentious
issues. Due to the raucous heckling of
some of the pro-choice advocates, and
despite the best efforts of the tech-

We are accustomed to
expect a high degree of
civility from those of the
Stanford community who
oppose our position but
nevertheless respect our
opinions.

nicians, tapes quite unsuitable for
viewing and listening were obtained
There was, therefore, an additional

injustice incurred due to the loss in
time and funds invested on the part of
those involved in the organization of
the event.
We were glad to read that the
leaders of this gravely impolite opposi
tion were not Stanford affiliated. We
are accustomed to expect a high degree
of civility from those of the Stanford
community who oppose our position
but nevertheless respect our opinions.
