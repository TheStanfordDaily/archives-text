# Carter's modern symphony defended
## 
### 
Simon Mcßae's criticism of the San
Francisco Symphony's performance of
Elliot Carter's "Symphony for Three
Orchestras" (Nov. 9) demands a re
sponse.
First of all, Mcßae claims that the
piece was not well-received. This is
simply not true. The audience ap
plauded enthusiastically, the maestro
took a few curtain calls, and the San
Francisco Chronicle reviewer praised
the conductor for programming the
work.
More offensive, however, is Mcßae's
attack on Carter's symphony: "There
was no hint of a theme or rhythm or
harmony or anything musical." Absurd
Thematically, the symphony opens
with a beautiful trumpet solo and has
twelve distinct themes woven together
to create what Carter calls a "kaleido
scope of musical themes." Rhythmical
ly, Carter is one of the great in-

novators of this century. Rhythmic
intensity is a central element in most
of Carter's work, and the symphony is
no exception. Harmonically, the work is
rich in textures and colors. Nothing
musical?
Well, Mcßae has a right to an opin
ion, but I hope that readers will lode
somewhere other than his column for
serious musical criticism.
In his 1938 article, "Orchestras and
Audiences," Elliot Carter describes two
types of listeners: active (attentive) and
passive (inattentive). The passive lis
tener, he writes, "generally rejects any
music which jars him out of himself
and threatens to afford a new experi
ence, giving way to anger as a protec
tion."
It is clear that Mcßae is such a lis
tener. Carter's music is very rewarding
and exciting when listened to "active
ly." He is one of America's greatest
living composers. I urge readers to
judge his music by listening to it, not
by reading Mcßae's "criticism."
