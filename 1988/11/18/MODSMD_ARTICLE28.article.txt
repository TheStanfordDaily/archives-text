## Stanford still seeing red after 16 years without a mascot Thunderchickens lost out to Cardinal, Cal will follow suit

"Cardinal triumphs o'er gold
and blue." This newspaper head
line announcing Stanford's vic
tory over Cal in the first Big
Game in 1891 settled a campus
debate about the choice of a school
color between cardinal and gold.
Yet, that choice not only deter
mined the color of Stanford sweat
shirts for the past four decades,
but originated the nickname that
has become Stanford's unusual
symbol. In 1972, when the Stan
ford Indian was judged inap
propriate as the school's mascot,
a decade-long battle ensued over
the choice of a Stanford symbol.
Not opting for the ordinary, a
mascot committee soon proposed
The Thunderchickens as a re
placement. The name referred to
the nickname of the defensive
front four of the previous season's

football team. This recommenda
tion was quickly renounced by the
administration as unsuitable to
represent the entire University
and then President Richard
Lyman reinstated the Cardinal as
the official symbol.
Throughout the 19705, several
student referendums for a new
mascot surfaced, each introducing
a different symbol. In 1975 stu
dents selected the Robber Baron
as the new mascot. Creating con
troversy in its own right, the Rob
ber Baron mascot faced the
criticism that it slandered railroad
tycoon Leland Stanford. Thus, the
Cardinal remained.
In 1978 the Griffin appeared
as a popular choice for mascot. A
Griffin is a mythological figure,
half eagle and half lion. At the
time, a member of Friends of the
Stanford Griffin articulated the
reasoning behind this choice,

harking back to the qualities of
the mythic beast. "A griffin can
be ferocious at times while also
symbolizing wisdom and courage,
a quality desired by athletes."
In anticipation of a new mascot,
two cast-iron griffins were moved
from the Children's Hospital to
the front of Encina Gym. The
move proved to be premature, as
only 35 percent of students voted
to make the griffin Stanford's
mascot in the spring of 1979.
Various groups continued the
search for a mascot supported by
a greater majority of the Univer
sity.
Termed "the greatest non-issue
of all time" by Dean of Student
Affairs and head of the University
Mascot Committee James Lyons,
the choice of mascot was put up
to a final referendum in the fall
of 1981. This time, the Cardinal

defeated both the Tree and the
Griffin.
Just days before the 1981 Big
Game, University President
Donald Kennedy, on recommen
dation from the Mascot Commit
tee, announced the Cardinal
would endure as Stanford's offi
cial symbol.
Stanford's infamous unofficial
mascot, the Tree, finds it close to
insulting. "How the *?@# can
you be a silly color? It's so, so
uncreative."
"A mascot should be .. . fun
and wacky . . . something the
crowd can enjoy," said the Tree,
sophqmore 'William Thomas.
Despite its speckled history, the
Cardinal has been the symbol ral
lying Stanford together for 55
years. Tomorrow, Stanford fans
will undoubtedly once more cheer
a Cardinal triumph o'er gold and
blue.
