# Play Pictionary with the Band

This year's Big Game will be the sight of the
world's biggest game, according to Rob Angel,
creator of the popular Pictionary.
Halftime at Memorial Stadium in Berkeley will
feature the Stanford Band as living line drawings.
The Band will form pictures on the field, while an
announcer reads off a list of possible answers. The
crowd will guess at the words by cheering for the
likely answer.
The Band's antics in front of the expected tens
of thousands of spectators this Saturday may qualify
for a spot in the Guiness Book of World Records
as the largest group game ever played.
Bill Stoller, media representative for The Games
Gang, which distributes Pictionary, said the Band
had contacted them about using the Pictionary con
cept during Big Game. "We thought it was a natural
tie-in," he said, noting that Pictionary is a huge
hit on campuses across the country. "We get clip
pings all the time about college students, dorms,
playing all-night games of Pictionary."
Not wanting to spoil the Band's fun, Angel was
not willing to give out the words chosen for the.
halftime show, but he did suggest one possibility!
Some Band members might arrange themselves in?
the shape of a blender. Others would then run
around the bottom of the figure. Got it? The word,
he revealed, is "puree."
Angel created Pictionary shortly after graduating
from college, while waiting on tables and trying to
decide what to do with himself. Whenever he had
friends over to his house, he entertained by playing
charades on paper. The object was to describe words
by using only simple hand-drawn pictures and no
other words or numbers.
These living room contests evolved into Pictionary.
Prompted by his friends, Angel spent 14 months
compiling and refining a list of 2,500 words for the
final product. Since then, over 10 million copies of
the game have been sold.

Pictionary is more than fun and games. Some
college students now play the game for charitable
causes. One example of this Stoller cited is "Students
against Multiple Sclerosis," which is raising money
this year in 1,200 universities, including Stanford,
to fight multiple sclerosis.
