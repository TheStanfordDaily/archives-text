Today we are going to talk
about dieting. Or more specifi
cally, the new miracle diet
which, according to several of
the finer journalistic publica
tions available at supermarket
checkstands, allowed talk-show
hostess Oprah Winfrey to lose
67 pounds in 24 minutes.
OK, I exaggerate, but not by
much. Oprah, who prior to her
diet could have easily been mis
taken for several of your better
known dirigibles, lost 67 pour ds
in just months by going on a
new diet program called "Op
tifast."
I happen to be an expert on
the "Optifast" diet because my
Dad went on the program
shortly before I left for school
this year. Previously, my Dad
had a physique which could best
be described as "Basic Sumo,"
but since he went on the diet I
am pleased to report that he
has experienced results very
similar to those of Oprah
Winfrey. It will be fun to see
the changes in his physique over
Christmas break, although it
will be difficult to get used to
my Dad as a black, female talk
show host.
Since he went on the diet in
the middle of September my
Dad has lost 41 pounds (metric:
18.6 kilopounds), or roughly the
equivalent of Nancy Reagan. At

this current rate of weight loss
he is expected to disappear en
tirely on Oct. 21, 1989.
"Optifast" is known as a
"very low calorie liquid-diet."
The way it works is that each
day the dieter is allowed to eat
the following:
• Four high-protein, low
calorie beverages which are
prepared by stirring a packet of
low-calorie "stuff" into water.
• Fifteen extra calories. This
can be taken in any form the
dieter wishes — a few leaves of
lettuce, a couple diet soft
drinks, a molecule of chocolate,
etc.
This approach of completely
eliminating solid food from the
diet has its advantages and its
disadvantages.
Advantages: Rapid weight
loss; no small portions of food
to "tease" the dieter; cheap
grocery bills.
Disadvantages: Pets risk
being stabbed in desperation
with meat thermometers.
Four times each day my Dad
goes through the elaborate proc
ess of opening one of the
"protein packets," mixing it
with water, saying grace and
drinking his meal.
Anyway, the diet is working
for my Dad, and he doesn't even
feel a craving for solid food, al
though last night I was making

a salad and he called me from
Anchorage to say it smelled
good.
You'd think it would be hard
for someone on one of these "no
food" diets to live around other
family members who are eating
large volumes of real food, but
that isn't a problem at his
household. Nope. His girlfriend
— with whom he lives — is also
on the "Optifast" program, the
end result being that they sim
ply don't buy any food.
Luckily, this whole diet busi
ness has a happy ending; my
Dad and his girlfriend are get
ting married in January. By
then they'll both be on their
way to sveltehood, and can share
the rest of their lives together
basking in each other's thin
ness.
