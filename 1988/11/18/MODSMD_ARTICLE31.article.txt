Win, Lose or Bust
International recording artist and occasional
topless model Samantha Fox proves that pop
stars can be intellectual too when she appears
on the daytime quiz show "Win, Lose or Draw"
later this month. The show, which is similar to
the popular board game "Pictionary," was taped
a few weeks ago in Los Angeles.
Apparently, Fox hasn't quite got a handle on
her American geography yet — she was
stumped by a drawing of Arkansas — but that
shouldn't stop her album from finding its way
into stores across the country. Look for her
third LP, "I Wanna Have Some Fun," in stores
now.
She wants to have some fun? Shoulda tried
Wheel of Fortune...

A full-page ad in the Nov. 2 issue of Variety
magazine showed a drawing of George Lucas
holding a light-saber, and posed the question":
"Dear George Lucas — When are you going
to make another Star Wars?"
The advertisment was paid for by 40 mem
bers of a French "Star Wars" fan club on the
11th anniversary of "Star Wars"' release in
France.
No word yet on whether Monsieur Luke and
Mademoiselle Leia will be returning to the silver
screen anytime soon.
