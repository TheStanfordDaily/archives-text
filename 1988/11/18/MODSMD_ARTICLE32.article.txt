## Ellington arrives on the 'A' Train 
### Morty Posner 
The Duke Ellington legacy. It includes
songs like "Sophisticated Ladies,"
"Satin Doll" and"It Don't Mean a Thing
if it Ain't Got That Swing." It is a
history of jazz that encompasses five
decades with tunes that are immediately
recognizable as classics.
Monday that legacy comes to
Memorial Auditorium in the form of
Mercer Ellington and the 17-piece or
chestra that bears his father's name.
Growing up in the shadow of the
Duke was no mean feat. Young Mercer's
jazz arrangements rarely got play during
the Ellington band's rehearsals, so he
gave his work to other bandu so he
could hear it.
Mercer went off on his own for a brief
period in the 19405, forming a group
called the "Mad Men." Duke was su
perstitious and wouldn't allow his son
to use the Ellington name when he ad
vertised.
"Let's just keep this thing to one
name," Duke admonished Mercer,
noting that Cab Calloway was perform
ing simultaneously with his sister and
there were two Dorsey bands at that
time; those weren't ideal arrangements.
"It was a takeoff on the old adage 'a
house divided doesn't stand,'" explained
Mercer Ellington in a telephone inter
view with The Daily. Whether it was
superstition or fear of competition, Mer
cer got some experience on his own so
"he'd take me on in his orchestra —
which took some time."
"Actually (Duke) didn't take me on
for my musical ability," demurred Mer
cer, who studied at Julliard and is an
accomplished conductor, composer, ar
ranger and trumpeter. "He needed a
road manager."
Mercer had been the successful
former road manager of trumpeter
Cootie Williams.
As the years went by, however, Mercer
accepted more arranging and playing
duties, finally taking up direction of the
band after Duke's death in 1974. "As
the days continue, (Duke) takes over
my body. I once in a while feel someone
tap me on the shoulder and I think it's
him," said Mercer.
Mercer comes to Stanford straight
from a whirlwind, 31-city tour of the
Orient. Traveling comes naturally to the
younger Ellington.
"Basically, we're minstrels," Mercer
observed. "I don't know any other life."
The Ellington Orchestra's perform
ance will include four of Mercer's com
positions: "Moon Mist," "Things Ain't
What They Used To Be," "Danish Eyes"
(a tribute to Mercer's wife), and selec
tions from "Music is My Mistress." The
latter tune, also the title of Duke's au
tobiography, is a work which pays

homage to the five women Mercer con
siders instrumental in his father's life
and music. It was also Duke's preferred
response to inquiries about his amorous
peccadillos.
Asked if he has a favorite work of
his father's, Mercer replied he's always
been fond of "Mood Indigo."
"It's so simple. Nothing else ap
proaches it." Duke once claimed he
wrote the tune while Mercer's mother
was making dinner. It will be featured
in the show at Stanford.
The Ellington band's signature song,
"Take the 'A' Train," was actually not
even composed by Duke and almost
never came to be, explained Mercer.
Longtime Ellington arranger Billy
Strayhorn wrote the song but didn't
think it was good enough. He and Mer
cer were roommates on the road at the
time, and Strayhorn's job was to come
up with an arrangement a week.
Strayhorn threw the song away. Luck
ily, said Mercer, the maid in the hotel
hadn't emptied the trash in the room
in four days. When Duke asked for
Strayhorn's weekly assignment, having
nothing else ready, he fished "'A' Train"
out of the garbage. The song has been
in the repertoire ever since.
Ellington is currently touring with
vocalist Tina Fabrique, who will appear
in the April Ist New York opening of
Duke's comic opera "Queenie Pie."
Mercer Ellington has been perfecting
"Queenie Pie" over the past few years,
performing it in Philadelphia and Wash

ington aa a "work-in-progress." Duke
had just finished the composition when
he died.
The Duke Ellington era was a less
enlightened one, and Mercer has tried
to update "Queenie Pie," as he did with
the Broadway hit "Sophisticated
Ladies," by changing the racial empha
sis and integrating the cast.
"(Duke) didn't limit the roles you
could have. If you were good enough,
you were good enough to have a job,"
Mercer said, who feels he's entirely jus
tified in adapting some of the material.
"I know Duke Ellington's mind. If I
don't know anything else it's that," said
Mercer.

'Actually (Duke) didn't
take me on for my musi
cal ability He needed
a road manager. 1

Keeping the act vibrant is a job Mercer
undertakes by reintroducing audiences
to earlier Ellington compositions.
"One of the tricks is not to keep (the
act) too fresh. In order to achieve that
we go back in time," playing some less
heard works. "It lets the audience hear
something they're not used to hearing,"
Mercer added.
Will the Ellington dynasty continue
to a third generation? Mercer has
several musical children, but the one
with most promise, he says, is his 10-
year-old son who can play scales on the
piano and claims to have written two
songs for his father's band.
"Has the band played them yet?" I
asked.
"Oh no," replied Mercer with his in
fectious laugh. "We only play things
that are tried and true. My son won't
get any special treatment. Especially if
he's my son."

The Stanford Jazz Band and the Duke
Ellington Orchestra play Monday night
at 8 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium. Tick
ets are $16-$22 (students $3 off) and
are available at the Tresidder Ticket

house divided doesn't stand,'" explained
Mercer Ellington in a telephone inter
view with The Daily. Whether it was
superstition or fear of competition, Mer
cer got some experience on his own so
"he'd take me on in his orchestra —
which took some time."
"Actually (Duke) didn't take me on
for my musical ability," demurred Mer
cer, who studied at Julliard and is an
accomplished conductor, composer, ar
ranger and trumpeter. "He needed a
road manager."
Mercer had been the successful
former road manager of trumpeter
Cootie Williams.
As the years went by, however, Mercer
accepted more arranging and playing
duties, finally taking up direction of the
band after Duke's death in 1974. "As
the days continue, (Duke) takes over
my body. I once in a while feel someone
tap me on the shoulder and I think it's
him," said Mercer.
Mercer comes to Stanford straight
from a whirlwind, 31-city tour of the
Orient. Traveling comes naturally to the
younger Ellington.
"Basically, we're minstrels," Mercer
observed. "I don't know any other life."
The Ellington Orchestra's perform
ance will include four of Mercer's com
positions: "Moon Mist," "Things Ain't
What They Used To Be," "Danish Eyes"
(a tribute to Mercer's wife), and selec
tions from "Music is My Mistress." The
latter tune, also the title of Duke's au
tobiography, is a work which pays

homage to the five women Mercer con
siders instrumental in his father's life
and music. It was also Duke's preferred
response to inquiries about his amorous
peccadillos.
Asked if he has a favorite work of
his father's, Mercer replied he's always
been fond of "Mood Indigo."
"It's so simple. Nothing else ap
proaches it." Duke once claimed he
wrote the tune while Mercer's mother
was making dinner. It will be featured
in the show at Stanford.
The Ellington band's signature song,
"Take the 'A' Train," was actually not
even composed by Duke and almost
never came to be, explained Mercer.
Longtime Ellington arranger Billy
Strayhorn wrote the song but didn't
think it was good enough. He and Mer
cer were roommates on the road at the
time, and Strayhorn's job was to come
up with an arrangement a week.
Strayhorn threw the song away. Luck
ily, said Mercer, the maid in the hotel
hadn't emptied the trash in the room
in four days. When Duke asked for
Strayhorn's weekly assignment, having
nothing else ready, he fished "'A' Train"
out of the garbage. The song has been
in the repertoire ever since.
Ellington is currently touring with
vocalist Tina Fabrique, who will appear
in the April Ist New York opening of
Duke's comic opera "Queenie Pie."
Mercer Ellington has been perfecting
"Queenie Pie" over the past few years,
performing it in Philadelphia and Wash

ington aa a "work-in-progress." Duke
had just finished the composition when
he died.
The Duke Ellington era was a less
enlightened one, and Mercer has tried
to update "Queenie Pie," as he did with
the Broadway hit "Sophisticated
Ladies," by changing the racial empha
sis and integrating the cast.
"(Duke) didn't limit the roles you
could have. If you were good enough,
you were good enough to have a job,"
Mercer said, who feels he's entirely jus
tified in adapting some of the material.
"I know Duke Ellington's mind. If I
don't know anything else it's that," said
Mercer.

'Actually (Duke) didn't
take me on for my musi
cal ability He needed

Keeping the act vibrant is a job Mercer
undertakes by reintroducing audiences
to earlier Ellington compositions.
"One of the tricks is not to keep (the
act) too fresh. In order to achieve that
we go back in time," playing some less
heard works. "It lets the audience hear
something they're not used to hearing,"
Mercer added.
Will the Ellington dynasty continue
to a third generation? Mercer has
several musical children, but the one
with most promise, he says, is his 10-
year-old son who can play scales on the
piano and claims to have written two
songs for his father's band.
"Has the band played them yet?" I
asked.
"Oh no," replied Mercer with his in
fectious laugh. "We only play things
that are tried and true. My son won't
get any special treatment. Especially if
he's my son."

The Stanford Jazz Band and the Duke
Ellington Orchestra play Monday night
at 8 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium. Tick
ets are $16-$22 (students $3 off) and
are available at the Tresidder Ticket
Office.


Mercer Ellington
The Duke Ellington legacy. It includes
songs like "Sophisticated Ladies,"
"Satin Doll" and"It Don't Mean a Thing
if it Ain't Got That Swing." It is a
history of jazz that encompasses five
decades with tunes that are immediately
recognizable as classics.
Monday that legacy comes to
Memorial Auditorium in the form of
Mercer Ellington and the 17-piece or
chestra that bears his father's name.
Growing up in the shadow of the
Duke was no mean feat. Young Mercer's
jazz arrangements rarely got play during
the Ellington band's rehearsals, so he
gave his work to other bandu so he
could hear it.
Mercer went off on his own for a brief
period in the 19405, forming a group
called the "Mad Men." Duke was su
perstitious and wouldn't allow his son
to use the Ellington name when he ad
vertised.
"Let's just keep this thing to one
name," Duke admonished Mercer,
noting that Cab Calloway was perform
ing simultaneously with his sister and
there were two Dorsey bands at that
time; those weren't ideal arrangements.
"It was a takeoff on the old adage 'a
house divided doesn't stand,'" explained
Mercer Ellington in a telephone inter
