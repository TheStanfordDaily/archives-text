## Cardinal falls in volleyball's 'Clash of the Titans' 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES - The 4,158
fans in Pauley Pavilion got their
money's worth and more last
night, when the No. 2 Stanford
women's volleyball team came
south to challenge the undefeated
and top-ranked UCLA Bruins. At
stake was the Cardinal's defense
of the Pacific 10 Conference
crown.

Women's Volleyball

When the dust had settled 2
hours and 20 minutes after the
opening serve, the league had a
new champion as the Bruins
bested an oft-brilliant but unfor
tunately inconsistent Stanford
squad 15-17, 15-12, 15-6, 15-7.
The win extends UCLA's season
record to 27-0, 17-0 and a record
win streak in the Pac-10. Stan
ford's record rests at 25-2, 15-2
in league, putting a cap on the
Cardinal's own string at 20 vic
tories.
For Stanford, this match goes
down as a might-have-been, as the
Cardinal pulled out a tight first
game win and had 9-4 and 12-10
leads that some how evaporated
with the heat of the Bruin attack.
Stanford never quite regained the
momentum of the first half, play
ing well but not steadily enough
to claim the upper hand.
"The first two were as close as
you can get," UCLA Coach Andy
Banachowski said. "I certainly ex
pect that we both should get to
the final of the regional, and the
fans will be in for a great match."
"I thought we played really well
the first two games — we battled
back and had a couple of great
comebacks," Stanford Coach Don
Shaw said. "The turning point
was when we got back tied 12-all
in the second game.

"If we could have been able to
maintain that «md shut the door,
it would have been a very different
match. These guys (UCLA) are
much better when things are
going well for them."
The first two games proved that
point. After staving off three
match points, Stanford took a
commanding position.
A 15-all tie quickly became a
16-15 Cardinal match point, and
a quick hit by reserve middle
blocker Nicole Appleman ended
any UCLA thoughts of a repeat
performance of the last Cardinal-
Bruin meeting.

If we could have
been able to maintain
that and shut the
door, it would have
been a very different
match. These guys
(UCLA) are much bet
ter when things are
going well for them.'

That match, played in early
September at Maples Pavilion to
open both teams' Pac-10
schedules, became a showcase for
Bruin freshmen Elaine Youngs
and Jenny Evans as UCLA swept
their host 15-7, 15-3, 15-9 to give
Stanford its first loss of the
season.
Youngs and Evans were again
potent players, notching 20 and
19 kills respectively. Bruin middle
blocker Daiva Tomkus also played
well, though not quite as domi
nant as in other UCLA wins, the
junior recorded 18 kills, 20 digs,
seven blocks and two aces.
Even more significantly,
Tomkus hit above her Pac-10
leading hitting percentage, finish
ing the match with a sterling .421.
The middle blocking tandem of

Tomkus and Youngs finally did
the Cardinal in, capping Stan
ford's second game resurgence
before the visitors could gain a
2-0 advantage going into halftime.
A Tomkus block solo on a hit by
Stanford's Amy Cooper brought
up game point, and Youngs un
leashed a tough serve to start the
game-ending play.
"They've got some good players
— they're solid all the way
around," Shaw observed. "We
managed to get one player out of
the game, (Samantha) Shaver, but
(Lori) Jones came in and did a
pretty good job for them."
The departure of Shaver was a
surprise, as the sophomore leads
the Bruins in digs and has been
one of the team's most consistent
passers. With the remainder of
the team passing well, however,
Jones' height and hitting more
than compensated for the defen
sive prowess exhibited by the
remaining starters.
As in the past several matches,
passing was the key to the match.
Whichever team happened to be
passing well unsurprisingly held
an offensive advantage, able to set
any of the hitters eligible to at
tack.
"Ball control," replied Shaw re
garding the essential part of the
match. "They made some broken
plays and popped some balls up
that they got, and there were
plays that we didn't make in the
third and fourth games espe
cially."
Ball control will be equally im
portant tonight, when the Cardi
nal wraps up its Pac-10 season
with a match against No. 17 USC.
The Trojans, at the end of a three
match losing streak, will have a
tough fight on their hands from
the disappointed Cardinal.
"It's very important for us to
have a good match tomorrow
night," Stanford setter Lara
Asper said. "I think we're capable
of doing that. .. . We all want to
prove ourselves."

Freshman Kristin Klein passes one up to the front line. Despite her 19 kills and 18 digs, the Cardinal
was unable to defeat the No. 1-ranked Bruins in Pauley Pavilion.
