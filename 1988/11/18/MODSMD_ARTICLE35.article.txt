# Get out the hibachi: The weenies will roast tomorrow

Grab those pompons, warm up
the vocal cords and dust off The
Axe: Big Game is here.
Both Stanford and California's
football teams enter 1988's finale
with an axe to grind. The
heartbreaking losses that have
followed the Cardinal this season
are well-known to all, but the
Golden Bears have had more than
their share of woes as well.
"We've had some interesting
things happen to this club," Bear
Coach Bruce Snyder said. "I'm
pleased with the team. . . .
They're a really resilient bunch.
They all believe they should have
a couple more wins."
Perhaps foremost in Snyder's
mind was the contest with Wash
ington Saturday. Cal started well,
jumping out to a 24-3 halftime
lead, before the Huskies came
roaring back to kick the winning
field goal with two seconds
remaining.
Noseguard Majett Whiteside
summed up the game on Sports
Final Sunday night, using the

dreaded C-word. "I thought we
had it,"he said. u ... We choked."
The Bears also lost a game ear
lier at Oregon State on a field
goal with 16 seconds left and after
the game the official timekeeper
admitted to inadvertently allowing
the fourth quarter to run 16
minutes instead of 15. Cal was
up 16-3 in the fourth quarter of
that one.
The Bears do enter Big Game
with a 5-5 record, however,
despite all the pitfalls along the
way, and have a shot at their first
winning season since 1982. Cal is
1-5 and in last place in the Pacific
10 Conference.
Stanford is currently 3-6-1, 1-
5-1 in the Pac-10.
But Stanford Coach Jack Elway
is optimistic about the Cardinal's
chances of ending this season on
a positive note. "If this football
team does exactly what I tell them
I have no doubt we'll beat Cali
fornia," he said. "I'll tell them we
need three big plays for touch
downs, three long drives of 80
yards or more with the run, a
great pass rush and keep [Cal

quarterback Troy] Taylor con-*
tained, cover every damned
receiver all the time . . . then we'll
win.
Realistically, Elway feels that
the Stanford defense is in a
groove. "[Against UCLA] that's
the best pass rush we've had all
year without having to commit
too many people," he said. "I
think it affected the accuracy of
[Bruin quarterback Troy] Aik
man. . . . What we want to do now
is preserve this."
Against Taylor the Cardinal de
fense will have to be at its best.
Taylor has thrown a touchdown
pass in 18 of his last 19 games
and has thrown for 2,190 yards
this season. "He's pretty elusive
back there," outside linebacker
Rob Hinckley said, "When the
play breaks down he still gets a
lot done. We're going to have to
be a lot more disciplined. I think
he's probably a lot like [Timm]
Rosenbach of Washington State."
Hinckley has been the leader of
the Cardinal defense lately, tally-

The Cardinal will have to do without the services of senior noseguard Ray Huckstein after Big Game.
He has three quarterback sacks and 29 total tackles going into tomorrow's contest
ing three sacks and 14 tackles
two weeks ago and 4Vi sacks and
20 total tackles against UCLA last
week. For his efforts he was
named both the Pac-10 and Sports
Illustrated national defensive
Player of the Week.
"Obviously Hinckley is playing
well and seems to be having a
great time out there," Elway said.
"He has continued to perform that
way all year."
Hinckley and Co. will also face
a healthy Chris Richards. The
Bears' tailback ran 32 times for
152 yards last week and has 682
yards on the season. His return
from injury revitalized a Cal
ground attack that had produced
only 264 yards in its last four
games, combined.
Defensively Stanford will have
to deal with Whiteside and line
backer David Ortega. Ortega leads
the squad with 119 tackles while
Whiteside has 6V2 tackles for
losses.
"We have a defense that has
been very good at times, especially
against the run," Snyder said.
"We've been hurt by the pass. . ..
I think the entire group needs to
do better."
The Cardinal will also face per

haps the nation's top kicker in
sophomore Robbie Keen. Keen has
hit on 17 of 19 field goals this
season, including a perfect 10-for
-10 from beyond 40 yards. He is
also tied for the Pac-10 lead in
punting, averaging 42.6 yards per
boot.
The Cardinal, on the other
hand, has received up-and-down
performances from special teams
all season. "We get a big play on
a punt [block] by [free safety
Mike] Newton," Elway said. "It
was an excellent play. Then you
have a mistake in terms of rough
ing the punter. I think we're going
to have to step it up a notch on
special teams in terms of our
