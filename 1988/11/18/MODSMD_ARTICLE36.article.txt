# Cardinal wrestling takes on the Aggies
## 
### Greg Gottesman Staff writer 
Maybe it's because guys like
Hulk Hogan and Cowboy Bob
Orton don't have the SAT
scores to get into Palo Alto
High, let alone Stanford.
Maybe it's because Stanford
doesn't give wrestling scholar
ships.
Maybe it's because tennis,
baseball and swimming are
more "California."
Whatever it is, Stanford's
wrestling team has not been a
powerhouse in the world of col
lege wrestling — yet.
Coming off a 28-15 victory
over San Francisco State, Stan
ford's wrestling squad squares
off against UC-Davis tonight
in the Aggie home gym.
"We should beat them (UC-
Davis). The way I look at it is
that we will have lots of trouble
competing against big schools
that give athletic scholarships.
But, we should beat all the
regional teams that don't have
scholarships — they have no
advantage," said head coach
Chris Horpel.
The Cardinal starting lineup
includes Dave Norwick (118

lbs. weight class), Mark For
man (126 lbs.). Josh Lisle (134
lbs.), James Dinette (142 lbs.),
Geoff Baum (150 lbs.), Matt
Nowlis (158 lbs.), Steve Yar
brough (167 lbs.), NCAA
qualifier Ron Perry (190 lbs.),
and Dave Nahama (Heavy
weight).
"Traditionally, we have been
strong in the upper weights
and not as strong in the lower
weights. After the meet against
San Francisco State, it lodes
like it's going to be more of
the same. We do have some
new lightweights this year that
are going to help us. One ob
jective is going to be to get the
most possible out of the
lightweights," commented Hor
pel.
Despite losing two-time
NCAA qualifier Terry Mcln
tyre, Stanford's future looks
bright. Mclntyre is the only
starter from last year's squad
to leave. More experienced and
deeper at the various weight
divisions, Stanford should
definitely improve on last
year's 5-8-0 dual meet record
and its 10th place finish in the
Pac-10/Western Regional
Championships.
