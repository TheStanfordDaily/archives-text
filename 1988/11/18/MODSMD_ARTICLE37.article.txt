# Hoops is NIT-bound
## 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
Last March, the Stanford men's
basketball team's season ended in
the National Invitational Tourna
ment. Tonight, it begins there.
Stanford, ranked 20th by the
AP and tied for 18th in the UPI
poll, faces the Montana Grizzlies
in the first round of the Big Apple
NIT Classic, an immediate test to
see how the highly-regarded Car
dinal will fare against tough na
tional competition.
Game time is 6:30 p.m., with
the radio-only broadcast from
Dahlberg Arena in Missoula,
Mont., on KZSU (90.1 FM) and
KCBS (740 AM). If the Cardinal
beats Montana, the second-round
game will be broadcast Sunday.
Second-round pairings will be an
nounced following the games
tonight.
Besides Montana, which was 18-
11 last year, is 1-0 this year and
is a co-favorite in the Big Sky
Conference, there are several
noteworthy schools in the 16-team
tourney that Stanford could face,
including Syracuse, Missouri, In
diana, Louisville and North
Carolina.
Also participating in the tour
nament is Arkansas State, which
ended Stanford's season March 22
in the second round of the
postseason NIT with a 60-59
squeaker over the Cardinal at
Maples Pavilion.
If it's potentially ironic that

Stanford could face Arkansas St.
again in the NIT, then there's
plenty of irony operating tonight
as Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery returns to his former
stomping grounds in Missoula.
Before replacing Tom Davis at
Stanford in 1986, Montgomery
manned Montana for eight sea
sons, averaging 19 wins a season
and leading the Grizzlies to two
NIT berths. Montgomery, as at
Stanford, never had a losing
season in Montana.
Montgomery, interestingly, was
not excited about his homecom
ing.
"I'd rather be doing something
else, to be honest," he said. "It's
very tough on me. I think the
fans will eryoy it, but I'll be glad
to put that one behind us."
If anything, his experience in
Montana will not allow him to
take the Grizzlies lightly. Three
of Montana's four returning
seniors led the team to its season
opening 87-61 pasting of little
Simon Fraser.
"It's a very veteran team,
picked to win its league," Mont
gomery said.
Nate DuChesne, a 6-foot-3,170-
pound guard, was by far the star
of the game as he handed out a
school-record 14 assists and made
14-of-14 free throws to finish with
20 points. K.C. McGowan, a 6-5
guard, added 17 points and eight
rebounds, and 6-9 forward Wayne


Michael Topotovac — Daily
Forward Howard Wright airs it out. The senior is one reason the
Cardinal basketball team has been so highly regarded in the
preseason.
Tinkle had 16 points and nine
rebounds.
According to Montana Coach
Stew Morrill (37-22 since Mont
gomery left), the Grizzlies play a
high-percentage offense, running
the ball when they can but mostly
trying to get points in the low
post. Sound familiar?
"We try and do a lot of the
things we did when Mike was
here," Morrill said.
When asked what scares him
about Stanford, Morrill replied,
"everything."
"They've got better players
than we will face at any other
time in the year," Morrill said.
"Our league is competitive, but
we won't face any other players
the caliber of Todd Lichti and
Howard Wright."

Morrill said Montana's success
depends on its ability to defend
Lichti and Wright and how well
it crashes the boards against last
year's Pacific 10 Conference
rebounding champions.
With the regular season begin
ning, it will be interesting to see
what combinations Montgomery
uses on the court.
During Stanford's two exhibi
tions, a 104-84 win over Brewstier
Heights Packing and a 107-71
drubbing of Czechoslovakia,
Montgomery has utilized all 12
players. Sophomore Deshon Win
gate, who has averaged just over
seven minutes per game this year,
has been the first forward off the
bench, and Montgomery has ex
perimented with both the 6-7 Win
gate and 6-7 sophomore forward
Andrew Vlahov at the off-guard
position.
Montgomery said there
wouldn't be any set combinations
for awhile and that they would

always depend on the opponent's
style of play, but added that the
Wingate and Vlahov could con
tinue to play at the "two" spot.
"We just feel like we need them
on the floor," Montgomery said.
"Andrew's a good passer and Des
hon is very active on the boards."
Card notes
As the regular season opens, several
Stanford players have a shot at some
milestones this year. The most
noteworthy, certainly, is that Todd
Lichti is only 652 points away from
tying the Pac-10 career scoring mark,
set by Lew Alcindor (known to you
as Kareem Abdul-Jabar), whose
UCLA class picture was shown in
Monday's Once Around The Quad.
Lichti already has Stanford's career
standard with 1,673 points. Senior
forward Howard Wright is currently
15th — but if he equaled last season's
total of 518 points he would be No.
2 all-time behind Lichti.

post. Sound familiar?
"We try and do a lot of the
things we did when Mike was
here," Morrill said.
When asked what scares him
about Stanford, Morrill replied,
"everything."
"They've got better players
than we will face at any other
time in the year," Morrill said.
"Our league is competitive, but
we won't face any other players
the caliber of Todd Lichti and
Howard Wright."

Morrill said Montana's success
depends on its ability to defend
Lichti and Wright and how well
it crashes the boards against last
year's Pacific 10 Conference
rebounding champions.
With the regular season begin
ning, it will be interesting to see
what combinations Montgomery
uses on the court.
During Stanford's two exhibi
tions, a 104-84 win over Brewstier
Heights Packing and a 107-71
drubbing of Czechoslovakia,
Montgomery has utilized all 12
players. Sophomore Deshon Win
gate, who has averaged just over
seven minutes per game this year,
has been the first forward off the
bench, and Montgomery has ex
perimented with both the 6-7 Win
gate and 6-7 sophomore forward
Andrew Vlahov at the off-guard
position.
Montgomery said there
wouldn't be any set combinations
for awhile and that they would

always depend on the opponent's
style of play, but added that the
Wingate and Vlahov could con
tinue to play at the "two" spot.
"We just feel like we need them
on the floor," Montgomery said.
"Andrew's a good passer and Des
hon is very active on the boards."
Card notes
As the regular season opens, several
Stanford players have a shot at some
milestones this year. The most
noteworthy, certainly, is that Todd
Lichti is only 652 points away from
tying the Pac-10 career scoring mark,
set by Lew Alcindor (known to you
as Kareem Abdul-Jabar), whose
UCLA class picture was shown in
Monday's Once Around The Quad.
Lichti already has Stanford's career
standard with 1,673 points. Senior
forward Howard Wright is currently
15th — but if he equaled last season's
total of 518 points he would be No.
2 all-time behind Lichti.
Last March, the Stanford men's
basketball team's season ended in
the National Invitational Tourna
ment. Tonight, it begins there.
Stanford, ranked 20th by the
AP and tied for 18th in the UPI
poll, faces the Montana Grizzlies
in the first round of the Big Apple
NIT Classic, an immediate test to
see how the highly-regarded Car
dinal will fare against tough na
tional competition.
Game time is 6:30 p.m., with
the radio-only broadcast from
Dahlberg Arena in Missoula,
Mont., on KZSU (90.1 FM) and
KCBS (740 AM). If the Cardinal
beats Montana, the second-round
game will be broadcast Sunday.
Second-round pairings will be an
nounced following the games
tonight.
Besides Montana, which was 18-
11 last year, is 1-0 this year and
is a co-favorite in the Big Sky
Conference, there are several
noteworthy schools in the 16-team
tourney that Stanford could face,
including Syracuse, Missouri, In
diana, Louisville and North
Carolina.
Also participating in the tour
nament is Arkansas State, which
ended Stanford's season March 22
in the second round of the
postseason NIT with a 60-59
squeaker over the Cardinal at
Maples Pavilion.
If it's potentially ironic that

Stanford could face Arkansas St.
again in the NIT, then there's
plenty of irony operating tonight
as Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery returns to his former
stomping grounds in Missoula.
Before replacing Tom Davis at
Stanford in 1986, Montgomery
manned Montana for eight sea
sons, averaging 19 wins a season
and leading the Grizzlies to two
NIT berths. Montgomery, as at
Stanford, never had a losing
season in Montana.
Montgomery, interestingly, was
not excited about his homecom
ing.
"I'd rather be doing something
else, to be honest," he said. "It's
very tough on me. I think the
fans will eryoy it, but I'll be glad
to put that one behind us."
If anything, his experience in
Montana will not allow him to
take the Grizzlies lightly. Three
of Montana's four returning
seniors led the team to its season
opening 87-61 pasting of little
Simon Fraser.
"It's a very veteran team,
picked to win its league," Mont
gomery said.
Nate DuChesne, a 6-foot-3,170-
pound guard, was by far the star
of the game as he handed out a
school-record 14 assists and made
14-of-14 free throws to finish with
20 points. K.C. McGowan, a 6-5
guard, added 17 points and eight
rebounds, and 6-9 forward Wayne


Michael Topotovac — Daily
Forward Howard Wright airs it out. The senior is one reason the
Cardinal basketball team has been so highly regarded in the
preseason.
Tinkle had 16 points and nine
rebounds.
According to Montana Coach
Stew Morrill (37-22 since Mont
gomery left), the Grizzlies play a
high-percentage offense, running
the ball when they can but mostly
trying to get points in the low
post. Sound familiar?
"We try and do a lot of the
things we did when Mike was
here," Morrill said.
When asked what scares him
about Stanford, Morrill replied,
