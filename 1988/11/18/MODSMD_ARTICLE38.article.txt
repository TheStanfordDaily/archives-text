# No. 3 polo takes on top-ranked Bears
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
The Cardinal's final regular
season contest of the year comes
down to the battle of the two
Italies — Northern and Southern.
When the water polo squad hits
the deck of California's Spieker
Aquatic Center Saturday at 10:15
a.m., the nation's premier coaches
will be leading their squads into
a clash for national rankings and
NCAA tournament seedings in ad
dition to cross-Bay tradition. They
will also be fighting for hometown
bragging rights.
Stanford Coach Dante Det
tamanti, winner of five national
championships, has his roots in
Northern Italy. Cal skipper Pete
Cutino, who has led the Cardinal's
conference rival to a nation
leading seven titles, hails from a
more southern point on the boot.
But from whichever place of the
penninsula, together the friendly
opponents equal the nation's
greatest water polo rivalry.
The annual end-of-season con
test is almost always a display
between two of the top, if not the
best, water polo squads. A prelude
to the NCAA Tournament, the
game has showcased the talents
of the past five champions. In the
12 years of the end-season
Stanford-Cal game, one, if not

everyone scores his average and Todd and
the guys play good defense we don't need a
hero.'

both, of the teams has been
ranked either first or second.
This season is no different. The
third-ranked Cardinal, jumping
two places in the rankings after
upsetting both Southern Califor
nia and UCLA last weekend, has
its biggest challenge of the year
in taking on the No. 1 Bears and
their out-for-blood fans in
Berkeley. Coming off a five-game
winning streak in which it
defeated every top-five team in
the country except Cal, the 21-9
Stanford squad is ready to do bat
tle.
"We're playing pretty well right
now," Dettamanti said. "The two
teams match up well and we know
their personnel better than any
other team."
Although Stanford is 0-2
against the Bears this season,
both games have been close con
tests, with the Cardinal falling by
no more than two goals. At the
UC-Irvine Tournament in Sep-

tember, Stanford fell 4-3, while
in their first Pacific 10 Conference
meeting Stanford led until the
fourth quarter and ultimately fell
8-6. Coming off its two biggest
victories of the year, the squad
feels it has the talent and momen
tum to knock off the No. 1 team
in the nation and regain its Bay
Area bragging rights.
"The UCLA game definitely
helped our mindset. We had the
capability all season but now we
have finally proved it to ourselves.
Since we are ranked below Cal
we have nothing to lose," Stanford
goalie Todd Kemp said.
Momentum or not, the Cardinal
will definitely have its hands full
come Saturday. While the Bears
have no big stars as UCLA and
USC do, they have risen to the
top through a balanced attack, a
deadly defense and the deepest
squad in the nation.
Two-meter man Kirk Everist
leads the squad with 64 goals, but

Cal's strengh has been its ability
to provide a different savior every
contest. "Their depth is their
stength," Dettamanti said. "You
can't try to stop just one player
because a different guy comes
through every game and they can
beat you in so many ways. They're
a really solid team."
And while the Bears provide a
balanced offensive attack, their
true stength lies in their defense.
The squad's "D" is anchored by
goalie Jeff Brush, an Olympic
team alternate. Surrounded by a
strong supporting cast, Brush and
Co do not make life for opposing
holemen and drivers easy. Both
the Cardinal squad and Det
tamanti agree the final score will
be low.
To pull off its third straight
upset, Stanford must hold Cal's
scoring down, through shutting
down the holemen and relying on
Kemp's All-American blocking
skills. In addition, the team must
be able to activate its scoring po
tential and get the ball in the goal.
"Everybody's got to have a good
game. If everyone scores his
average and Todd and the guys
play good defense we don't need
a hero," Dettamanti said.
While the Cardinal is battling
Cal for honor and conference

standings, the outcome of the
game can also have an impact on
national standings and NCAA
seedings. If Stanford can pull off
the victory it has an outside
chance of being voted into the
country's second spot, and from
there being given the second-seed
position at the NCAA Champion

ships in Long Beach.
"It is really important to keep
our momentum going heading into
NCAA's," driver Collin Keely said.
"If we beat USC, UCLA and Cal
in a row it will really give us
confidence going into the tourna
ment. We will be the team to look
out for."

season contest of the year comes
down to the battle of the two
Italies — Northern and Southern.
When the water polo squad hits
the deck of California's Spieker
Aquatic Center Saturday at 10:15
a.m., the nation's premier coaches
will be leading their squads into
a clash for national rankings and
NCAA tournament seedings in ad
dition to cross-Bay tradition. They
will also be fighting for hometown
bragging rights.
Stanford Coach Dante Det
tamanti, winner of five national
championships, has his roots in
Northern Italy. Cal skipper Pete
Cutino, who has led the Cardinal's
conference rival to a nation
leading seven titles, hails from a
more southern point on the boot.
But from whichever place of the
penninsula, together the friendly
opponents equal the nation's
greatest water polo rivalry.
The annual end-of-season con
test is almost always a display
between two of the top, if not the
best, water polo squads. A prelude
to the NCAA Tournament, the
game has showcased the talents
of the past five champions. In the
12 years of the end-season
Stanford-Cal game, one, if not

everyone scores his average and Todd and
the guys play good defense we don't need a
hero.'

both, of the teams has been
ranked either first or second.
This season is no different. The
third-ranked Cardinal, jumping
two places in the rankings after
upsetting both Southern Califor
nia and UCLA last weekend, has
its biggest challenge of the year
in taking on the No. 1 Bears and
their out-for-blood fans in
Berkeley. Coming off a five-game
winning streak in which it
defeated every top-five team in
the country except Cal, the 21-9
Stanford squad is ready to do bat
tle.
"We're playing pretty well right
now," Dettamanti said. "The two
teams match up well and we know
their personnel better than any
other team."
Although Stanford is 0-2
against the Bears this season,
both games have been close con
tests, with the Cardinal falling by
no more than two goals. At the
UC-Irvine Tournament in Sep-

tember, Stanford fell 4-3, while
in their first Pacific 10 Conference
meeting Stanford led until the
fourth quarter and ultimately fell
8-6. Coming off its two biggest
victories of the year, the squad
feels it has the talent and momen
tum to knock off the No. 1 team
in the nation and regain its Bay
Area bragging rights.
"The UCLA game definitely
helped our mindset. We had the
capability all season but now we
have finally proved it to ourselves.
Since we are ranked below Cal
we have nothing to lose," Stanford
goalie Todd Kemp said.
Momentum or not, the Cardinal
will definitely have its hands full
come Saturday. While the Bears
have no big stars as UCLA and
USC do, they have risen to the
top through a balanced attack, a
deadly defense and the deepest
squad in the nation.
Two-meter man Kirk Everist
leads the squad with 64 goals, but

Cal's strengh has been its ability
to provide a different savior every
contest. "Their depth is their
stength," Dettamanti said. "You
can't try to stop just one player
because a different guy comes
through every game and they can
beat you in so many ways. They're
a really solid team."
And while the Bears provide a
balanced offensive attack, their
true stength lies in their defense.
The squad's "D" is anchored by
goalie Jeff Brush, an Olympic
team alternate. Surrounded by a
strong supporting cast, Brush and
Co do not make life for opposing
holemen and drivers easy. Both
the Cardinal squad and Det
tamanti agree the final score will
be low.
To pull off its third straight
upset, Stanford must hold Cal's
scoring down, through shutting
down the holemen and relying on
Kemp's All-American blocking
skills. In addition, the team must
be able to activate its scoring po
tential and get the ball in the goal.
"Everybody's got to have a good
game. If everyone scores his
average and Todd and the guys
play good defense we don't need
a hero," Dettamanti said.
While the Cardinal is battling
Cal for honor and conference

standings, the outcome of the
game can also have an impact on
national standings and NCAA
seedings. If Stanford can pull off
the victory it has an outside
chance of being voted into the
country's second spot, and from
there being given the second-seed
position at the NCAA Champion

ships in Long Beach.
"It is really important to keep
our momentum going heading into
NCAA's," driver Collin Keely said.
"If we beat USC, UCLA and Cal
in a row it will really give us
confidence going into the tourna
ment. We will be the team to look
out for."
