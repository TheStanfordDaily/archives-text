# Ex-Olympian Morales dives in with the Greeks for Big Game week
## 
### 
The Greeks return to wander
among the populace this week,
attired appropriately in red and
white polyester, i.e. the ready-to
tailgate look. And leading the pack
is this week's Guest Greek,
former Stanford Daily staffer
Pablo Morales.
"Jimmy The Greek [a distant
relative of a couple members of
the panel] was always one of my
childhood idols and even though
he's become rather infamous I'm
glad to have the chance to follow
in his footsteps," Morales said. "I
only wish I could have worked
side-by-side with Brent Musberger
on this one."
Morales came up with some fine
picks of his own anyway, tabbing
the Cardinal to cruise to a Big
Game victory over the Weenies.
He also picked Columbia (1-8) to
beat Brown (0-8-1), "by a safety,
2-0."
Morales, who covered the Stan
ford women's hoops team for two
seasons, also found the time to
graduate, work as a volunteer for
several organizations and even

swim a little.
He did have one complaint, liow
ever. "The predictions are biased
in that there are no swimming
picks," he said. "I'm out of my
element here but I'll still try to
move the Greek up a notch or
two."
The Guest Greek is currently
in sixth place, two games ahead
of sports editor Cameron Macky,
who may change his name to Wil
lard after spending so much time
with the cellar rats. Card Today
editor Dave Earnest continues to
lead the pack but Mark Rogowsky,
Robert Pardington and even the
upwardly-mobile Bruce "shark"
Sarkisian will challenge.
This week marks the penul
timate week for the Greeks to do
battle, and with tensions high on
this end, beware of semi-psychotic
Greeks wanting to scan the Sun
day sports page.
We leave you now, but with Big
Game tomorrow, remember this
simple cheer for the fourth quar
ter: "Bring on the mustard, bring
on the bun; these Weenies are
DONE!"
