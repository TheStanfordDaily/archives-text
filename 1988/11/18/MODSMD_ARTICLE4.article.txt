# USW accuses Stanford of unfair labor practices
## 
### Robert Landon Staff writer 
The United Stanford Workers have accused Stan
ford of unfair labor practices through contracting
too many outside workers from a private farm on
Stanford lands.
This charge comes just three weeks after the
University and the USW signed a new three-year
contract.
USW representative Rodney Barnette says it is
"scandalous" that "at least a dozen" union jobs are
going to workers at the local Webb Ranch, which
is on the west side of campus, off Alpine Road.
But Stanford attorney Susan Herger says, "There

has been no violation of collective bargaining in the
use of Webb Ranch employees."
In the recent negotiations, the union sought more
control over the number of outside contractors the
University hires, but it dropped most of the demands
and got other concessions on pay increases, benefits
and the pension plan.
Between four to seven Webb Ranch laborers come
to campus every day to work for the Athletics
Department, according to Thomas Hubbard, a man
ager at the ranch. As many as 15 come on special
occasions like graduation and football games, he
said.
At present, Stanford pays Webb
Ranch $8.50 for each hour of
labor, of which the workers
receive as little as $4.25. The
workers have no health insurance
plan, no pension plan, and no sick
leave or vacation leave.
Athletics Department official
Allan Cummings explained that
the amount of grounds work fluc
tuates, so the department requires
a "floating crew. The size of the
work force depends on the how
much work there is."
However, he confirmed that at
least two workers have been at
Stanford on a full-time basis,
which may put the University on
shaky ground.
Faced with a similar situation
in 1985, the Department of Op
erations and Maintenance stopped
employing full-time workers
through outside contractors.
"Certain allegations were
made" that such a practice vio
lated the contract with the USW,
said Herb Fong, manager of Op
erations and Maintenance.
And as far as Barnette is con
cerned, there is no difference be
tween that problem and the pres
ent problem. "Stanford is violating
the spirit of good faith in collective

bargaining," he said.
It may not be technically illegal
for Stanford to contract out work
at the University, he said, but
"anyone at the University who
does technical maintenance or
service should be in the bargain
ing unit, according to the the Na
tional Labor Relations Board."
The NLRB is the federal agency
that enforces labor law.
Union membership has declined
from a high of 1,500 to 1,200
today, even though more jobs have
been created at the University,
Barnette said. He attributed this
decline to practices like the out
side contracting from Webb Ranch
and other sources.
The University's Fong agreed
with the union that "it is not in
the spirit of the contract" to em
ploy contract labor on a perma
nent, full-time basis.
"We now try to use temporaries
as little as possible," Fong added.
Ralph Buchanan, Fong's supe
rior at Operations and Mainte
nance, said, "We restructured our
program and set up six new per
manent positions," which are
filled by union workers.
Linda Crouse, chief steward of
the USW, praised the Deparment
of Operations and Maintenance.
"We're not trying to get rid of
the Webb workers. We want them
to be hired at union wages and
with union rights."
