# USW accuses Stanford of unfair labor practices

The United Stanford Workers have accused Stan
ford of unfair labor practices through contracting
too many outside workers from a private farm on
Stanford lands.
This charge comes just three weeks after the
University and the USW signed a new three-year
contract.
USW representative Rodney Barnette says it is
"scandalous" that "at least a dozen" union jobs are
going to workers at the local Webb Ranch, which
is on the west side of campus, off Alpine Road.
But Stanford attorney Susan Herger says, "There

has been no violation of collective bargaining in the
use of Webb Ranch employees."
In the recent negotiations, the union sought more
control over the number of outside contractors the
University hires, but it dropped most of the demands
and got other concessions on pay increases, benefits
and the pension plan.
Between four to seven Webb Ranch laborers come
to campus every day to work for the Athletics
Department, according to Thomas Hubbard, a man
ager at the ranch. As many as 15 come on special
occasions like graduation and football games, he
said.
