Taking on California in an in
formal but traditional Big Game
Week meet yesterday at
DeGuerre Pool, the Stanford
men's and women's swim teams
doubled their pleasure by dou
bling up squads as well as event
distances. Sounds like a
doublemint gum ad, hold the
bikini-clad twins.
Because both teams are pres

over Cal's Rocque Santos.

Last year's top high school
distance swimmer, freshman
standout Alex Kostich was vic
torious in the men's 800 indi
vidual medley and secured a
solid second place in the 2,000
meter freestyle.
All was not golden for the Car
dinal men however. Passed in
the final yards by Cal freestyle
dynamo and Texas transfer Jeff
Olsen, Stanford's 800 freestyle
relay was narrowly defeated,
much to Kenney's dismay. "You
don't let your opponent back in
