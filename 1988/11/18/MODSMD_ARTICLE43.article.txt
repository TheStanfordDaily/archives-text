### Brad Hayward Staff writer 
University Food Service and
the Stanford Project on Nutri
tion will likely expand their dis
tribution of leftover food to the
homeless in Palo Alto and other
Peninsula communities.
Leaders of SPOON, a student
volunteer organization, and
Food Service officials will meet
today to consider the possibility
of extending the hunger project
to more residences on campus.
Branner Hall and 20 self-ops,
fraternities and eating clubs
currently participate in the
project.
"It's very likely that the proj
ect can be expanded," said Lois
Ohms, assistant director of
Food Service, adding that "they
(SPOON) probably couldn't
handle all of Food Service at
one time â€” it would be
gradual."
SPOON was founded last
year by three students, includ
ing current seniors Doug

Abrams and Amira Leifer. Fifty
students altogether distribute
the leftovers to about 60 home
less people a week in Palo Alto,
according to the Rev. Jim
Burklo of the Palo Alto Urban
Ministry.
Last spring, Branner Food
Service joined the project.
Leifer said Branner's partici
pation has worked out well and
has continued this year.
If Food Service agrees to al
low more dormitories to par
ticipate in the program,
SPOON will be able to start
distributing food to homeless
in other Peninsula cities in ad
dition to Palo Alto, Leifer said.
"We'd like the whole Univer
sity to be involved," Leifer said.
