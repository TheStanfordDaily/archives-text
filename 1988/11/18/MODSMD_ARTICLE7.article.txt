## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Staff writer 
In their quarterly State of the Association report,
the Council of Presidents said last night that bring
ing the community together to understand the prob
lem of racism is at the top of the their agenda.
In addition, the COP hopes to strengthen student
services and the educational experience at Stanford
according to COP member Stacey Leyton.
The COP will be working on building student
involvement in the ASSU through the ASSU Com
mittee on Democracy in Education and ASSU dorm
representatives.
According to the report, the committee will work
toward the adoption of an ethnic studies require
ment for all undergraduates and the hiring of full
time ethnic deans. In January, the committee will
hold a forum on the "Mandate for Change," a list
of demands made by the Students of Color Coalition,
an organization of campus minority groups.
This week, the committee began small forums in
dorms to discuss racism and the coalition's demands.
According to sophomore Dan Rosenberg, a resident
of 353 Campus Drive, there was a clear difference
of opinion evident at a forum held there Wednesday
night.
"Some people were sensitive to racial issues and
some didn't see it as such a big deal," Rosenberg
said. "There was some understanding and the two
sides got to know each other's position.
"But I don't think any great revelation came
about," he added.
According to Branner RA Julie Lythcott, the
forum at Branner Monday night "led to a lot of
understanding" and "definitely satisfied the objec
tives of the COP."
"Nobody was labeled racist for saying anything,"
Lythcott said, adding that she thought "a lot of
people gained from it."
These forums are part of the COP's desire to
"bring the Stanford community together and deal
with the issues of racism" through educational pro
grams, Leyton said.
Further, Leyton said, the COP would like to
"build and strengthen" student services offered
through the ASSU. They have already begun to do
this through programs such as the "Beat the Book
store" drive that offers supplies at lower rates than
the Bookstore and by placing course consultants in
White Plaza to advise students on courses.
