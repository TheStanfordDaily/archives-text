California

Cardinal linebacker Rob
Hinckley's stellar performance
against UCLA last weekend gar
nered him the Pacific 10 Confer
ence and Sports Illustrated De
fensive Player of the Week awards.
His 11 unassisted tackles and 4Va
sacks against the Bruins could
spell trouble for California's
elusive quarterback Troy Taylor.
Taylor, who has passed for 2190
yards and 15 touchdowns this
season, threw nine of his TD
tosses last year when scrambling
out of the pocket.

Reserve left cornerback Brad
Cook has lead a stingy Cardinal
pass defense in the '88 campaign
with four interceptions, including
an end zone interception of UCLA
quarterback Troy Aikman last
week that Cook returned 66 yards.
Golden Bear tight end Darryl In
gram is the Bears' second-leading
receiver with 35 receptions for
468 yards. Playing in his last col
legiate game, Ingram will try to
lead Cal to its first winning record
since 1982.

Quarterback Jason Palumbis,
in only his first year of eligibility,
will start for Stanford today in
spite of a short-lived outing
against UCLA last weekend.
Palumbis was 9-for-10 with one
interception when he gave way to
reserve Brian Johnson, who
guided the Cardinal to a spirited
but brief lead. Palumbis and wide
receiver Walter Batson will have
to work around California corner
back John Hardy, the Bears'
leader in interceptions.

Stanford left guard Andy Papat
hanassiou and California
noseguard Majett Whiteside face
off in a key line battle. Junior
Papathanassiou, along with All-
America candidate center Andy
Sinclair, have provided impressive
pass protection for Stanford quar
terbacks all year. Whiteside and
right tackle Natu Tuatagaloa have
performed well in the absence of
injured starting defensive tackle
Joel Dickson, compiling a com
bined five sacks.

Both Stanford's John Hopkins
and Cal's Robbie Keen punt in
addition to their placekicking
duties. Keen has been exceptional
this year, hitting 17-of-19 field
goal attempts while averaging
42.6 yards per punt. Keen is the
nation's top combination kicker
punter. Hopkins is 15-of-20 field
goal attempts and is averaging
35.6 yards per punt.
