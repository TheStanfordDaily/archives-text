# Stanford not as weak as record shows
## Although the '88 season is a disappointment, '89 may hold some surprises 
### 
The 1988 Stanford Cardinal
football team may well be the best
3-6-1 football team in history.
On the surface, that seems to
say very little. But this year's
squad is better than last year's
5-6 team, and this year's defense
in many respects compares with
that of the Gator Bowl season,
1986.

One needs only look at Stan
ford's 1988 schedule to see how
close to greatness the Cardinal
has come this season.
The list of nationally-ranked
opponents is long. Stanford was
routed by then fifth-ranked Notre
Dame on Oct. 1. Without a doubt
the Cardinal's worst effort of the
season. Even 9-1 teams have off
weeks. And Notre Dame is now
the No. 1 team in the land.
If you dismiss this performance
against the Fighting Irish, Stan
ford has been competitive against
every top-20 team it has faced.

Check that, Stanford has at least
been in a position to win against
every top-20 team it has faced.
First, there's the Cardinal's
rout of Arizona State. On Oct. 15
in Stanford Stadium Stanford
cleaned ASU's clock. In an effort
typical of its play all season, the
Cardinal defense battered and
bruised the Sun Devils, sacking
quarterbacks Daniel Ford and
Paul Justin four times and hur
rying them into five interceptions,
two by linebacker Jono Tunney,
the defensive star of the game.
You don't remember Arizona
State being in the top 20? Well,
the hapless Devils somehow snuck
their way into list of the country's
20 best teams. They were ranked
20th last week. Right before they
got clobbered by USC 50-0 in
Tempe.
The Cardinal also played USC,
back on Sept. 10. The current No.
2 team in the country needed a
touchdown drive in the waning
moments to win. And that drive
was led by the man who should
win the Heisman Trophy this
year, Trojan quarterback Rodney
Peete. But for the last drive, the
Cardinal defense was flawless.
Similarly, Stanford fought
gamely and lost in Seattle to the
Washington Huskies on Oct. 29.
And, surprise, the Huskies have
been in the bottom five of the top
20 as well. This one had a rather

different scenario. Stanford had a
forgettable first half, but a furious
fourth-quarter rally left the Car
dinal three bucks short, 28-25.
Stanford had no excuse after
its Nov. 5 loss to the Washington
State Cougars, the No. 19 team
in the nation. Stanford had first
and goal from the one with less
than two minutes to play. On first
down, the offense lost two yards.
Second down saw QB Jason
Palumbis' pass fall into the
waiting arms of a WSU defender,
and Cardinal hopes were dashed.
Linebacker Rob Hinckley's three
sacks and 14 tackles were a hint
at why some will consider him a
pre-season All-American next
year.
Yet another heartbreaking loss
was suffered in Oregon on Sept.
24, when the Ducks, who rose as
high as 16th in the polls, scored
their only touchdown in the
fourth quarter to beat Stanford
7-3. For more than three quarters
of play, the Cardinal defense
proved why it will be one of the
best in the Pacific 10 Conference
in the fall of '89.
Stanford most recently traveled
to Pasadena, where the Cardinal
had UCLA on the ropes until a
freak play ruined a dominant ef
fort from the defense. QB Brian
Johnson had the ball stripped
from his hanHa Kv rt Rrnin
lineman, who caught the flutter-

ing ball in full stride and scam
pered in for the go-ahead score.
Against UCLA, Hinckley
solidified his status as a deity,
recording 20 tackles — 11 unas
sisted — 4 V2 sacks and forcing
one fumble. One sack appeared
to sever Bruin QB Troy Aikman's
torso at the waist. Unless Aikman
rolls and Peete folds in this week
end's battle for L.A. bragging
rights — and the Pac-10 title —
Hinckley's devastation of Aikman
and the UCLA passing game may
have solidified Peete as the
leading Heisman candidate. You
see, Peete had his best day as a

collegian against ASU the same
day Aikman became very familiar
with Hinckley's No. 43.
Anyway, are you getting the
idea yet? The Cardinal played
seven top-20 teams and was blown
out by just one. One of the
remaining six was a Stanford
rout, and the others were
should'ves or could'ves.
A quick examination of the Car
dinal's returnees for next year is
all that's needed to see Stanford
can only be better next season.
Hinckley, Tunney, lineman
Lester Archambeau, strong safety
Rob Englehardt and cornerback
and punt/kick returner Alan
Grant will anchor a defensive unit
that has been solid through most
of '88.
On offense, quarterbacks Brian
Johnson and Jason Palumbis will
have a year of experience — har
rowing as it may have been —
under their belts. And Jon Volpe,
who could set the Stanford single
season rushing record today, will
be back to spearhead the running
attack. The receiving corps
returns everybody except Henry
Green — Walter Batson, Chris
Walsh, Jon Pinckney and red
shirted Ed McCaffrey will all be
a season smarter.
All systems are go for '89. And
a demolition of cross-bay rival
California would salvage an other
wise disappointing '88.
