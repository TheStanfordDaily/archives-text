# Huckestein plays final game
## 
### Josh Kreinberg Staff writer 
Mud, blood and running backs
are hardly the fixings for the
breakfast of champions. Never
theless, they seem to suit
defensive linemen just fine.
Stanford senior noseguard Ray
Huckestein has grown to a
healthy 6-foot-2, 265 pounds
thriving on this diet for the last
eight years.
Huckestein devoured opposing
offenses last season compiling 64
tackles, the third highest on the
team. He was also third in quar
terback sacks with five for a total
of minus 30 yards.
"Ray plays very, very strong,"
Cardinal defensive coordinator
and defensive line Coach Dick
Mannini said of Huckestein's play.
"He has good natural quickness
and plays with intensity. He does
a great job of controlling the
middle [of the linel."
That control of the line earned
Huckestein the status of an
Honorable Mention Collegiate All-
America from both the Associated
Press and Sporting News at the
end of last season. In addition,
Huckestein won honors as the sec
ond team All-Pacific-10 Confer
ence noseguard and was named
Stanford's Defensive Player of the
Game in the Cardinal's 1987
defeat of Oregon.
"I just try to get my job done,"
Huckestein said. "As soon as the
defense is called, I think of what
I'm going to do if the play comes
my way and how I'm going to
pursue if it doesn't."
Huckestein, who started all 11
games for Stanford last year, has
been hampered by injuries this
season. He started seven games
and shared time with senior Steve
Weber in an eighth.
"In the beginning of the year
it (the injury) was my back,"
Huckestein said. "Then my foot
got smashed and that's what held
me out of the games."

In spite of his injuries, Huck
estein has compiled 29 tackles this
season, 11 of which were unas
sisted, and has three sacks for
minus 13 yards, tying him for
fourth in the current team stand
ings.
Huckestein felt his performance
in last weekend's 27-17 loss to
UCLA was merely "okay, " but
that the defense as a whole played
well.
"It was a tough loss, like so
many we've had this year," Huck
estein said. "I thought we played
well enough to win. We held their
offense [pretty well! all day long."
Unfortunately for Stanford,
Huckestein, who didn't redshirt
as a freshman, will be donning
the cardinal and white for the last
time today against California.
"[Huckesteinl is really an in
tense player, and he puts a lot of
pressure on himself to play well,
but he's had a tough time this
year with his injuries," Stanford
outside linebacker Rob Hinckley
said. "Everyone on the team likes
him, and we're really going to
miss him."
Huckestein, who doesn't seem
to be bothered by nostalgia at the
moment, is preparing for today's
game just as he has for all others
during his Stanford career.
"I'm sure when the final bell
sounds and I realize that I've
played my last game, it's going to
be tough," Huckestein said. "But
I'm going to approach it just the
same as all the others over the
past four years."
Huckestein predicts that the
game itself will be "interesting."
"[Both teams arel going to be
up for it," Huckestein said. "They
have a 5-5 record, so you know
they're not an easy team [to
beat.]"
After tomorrow's game and an
offseason to reflect on his Stan
ford career, Huckestein, a sociol
ogy major, thinks he'll "give the
NFL a shot." He has no preferred
professional team becauses he

feels he could fit in well with any
program.
Huckestein would definitely
have problems giving up a football
career that's now 15 years old. In
the second grade, he started the
sport as an offensive lineman and
linebacker.
He continued his career at
North Allegheny High School in
Pennsylvania, where he played
both offensive guard and defensive
tackle.
Despite Huckestein's 70
tackles, 60 assists and 14 sacks,
North Alleghany finished a dis
apointing 3-7 during his senior
year.
Although his school never won
a conference title, Huckestein, the
team captain, impressed a num
ber of people in the collegiate foot
ball business.
Huckestein was a three-time
Quad A West All-Conference Se
lection, a consensus High School
All-America, a USA Today first
team All-America, a Bally's first
team All-America, a Max Enfinger
first team All-America and a
member of The Sporting News'
top 100 list.
Huckestein also participated in
track and field in high school. He
threw the shot put and the discus,
but said his performance was only
"average" in those events.
He also wrestled in high school
for three years. He placed fifth
in the heavyweight division at the
state meet his junior year, but
was unable to wrestle his senior
year due to a knee injury.
Huckestein chose to play foot
ball instead of wrestle in college
because he felt he had a better
chance to excel in football.
"They're both great sports,"
Huckestein said, "But there was
more opportunity for me in foot
ball."
Huckestein definitely took ad
vantage of the opportunity as he
was one of the select few who


courtesy Stanford Sports Information

didn't redshirt. He began playing
immediately his freshman year.
"One of the reasons I chose
Stanford was to get a chance to
play," Huckestein said. "I knew
Stanford was an up-and-coming
program, and I wanted to be a
part of it."
Huckestein became a part of it
even in his freshman year when
he began sharing time at
noseguard with Eric Volta. At the
Stanford Spring Awards Banquet,
he won the Grogan Award, an
nually awarded to the most out
standing Stanford freshman
football player.
Huckestein doesn't seem to
regret his move to noseguard. "1
like being in the middle of things,"
Huckestein said. "Not too many
things happen on the field that I
don't know about."
Much to other coaches chagrin.

was unable to wrestle his senior
year due to a knee injury.
Huckestein chose to play foot
ball instead of wrestle in college
because he felt he had a better
chance to excel in football.
"They're both great sports,"
Huckestein said, "But there was
more opportunity for me in foot
ball."
Huckestein definitely took ad
vantage of the opportunity as he
was one of the select few who


courtesy Stanford Sports Information

didn't redshirt. He began playing
immediately his freshman year.
"One of the reasons I chose
Stanford was to get a chance to
play," Huckestein said. "I knew
Stanford was an up-and-coming
program, and I wanted to be a
part of it."
Huckestein became a part of it
even in his freshman year when
he began sharing time at
noseguard with Eric Volta. At the
Stanford Spring Awards Banquet,
he won the Grogan Award, an
nually awarded to the most out
standing Stanford freshman
football player.
Huckestein doesn't seem to
regret his move to noseguard. "1
like being in the middle of things,"
Huckestein said. "Not too many
things happen on the field that I
don't know about."
Much to other coaches chagrin.
Mud, blood and running backs
are hardly the fixings for the
breakfast of champions. Never
theless, they seem to suit
defensive linemen just fine.
Stanford senior noseguard Ray
Huckestein has grown to a
healthy 6-foot-2, 265 pounds
thriving on this diet for the last
eight years.
Huckestein devoured opposing
offenses last season compiling 64
tackles, the third highest on the
team. He was also third in quar
terback sacks with five for a total
of minus 30 yards.
"Ray plays very, very strong,"
Cardinal defensive coordinator
and defensive line Coach Dick
Mannini said of Huckestein's play.
"He has good natural quickness
and plays with intensity. He does
a great job of controlling the
middle [of the linel."
That control of the line earned
Huckestein the status of an
Honorable Mention Collegiate All-
America from both the Associated
Press and Sporting News at the
end of last season. In addition,
Huckestein won honors as the sec
ond team All-Pacific-10 Confer
ence noseguard and was named
Stanford's Defensive Player of the
Game in the Cardinal's 1987
defeat of Oregon.
"I just try to get my job done,"
Huckestein said. "As soon as the
defense is called, I think of what
I'm going to do if the play comes
my way and how I'm going to
pursue if it doesn't."
Huckestein, who started all 11
games for Stanford last year, has
been hampered by injuries this
season. He started seven games
and shared time with senior Steve
Weber in an eighth.
"In the beginning of the year
it (the injury) was my back,"
Huckestein said. "Then my foot
got smashed and that's what held
me out of the games."

In spite of his injuries, Huck
estein has compiled 29 tackles this
season, 11 of which were unas
sisted, and has three sacks for
minus 13 yards, tying him for
fourth in the current team stand
ings.
Huckestein felt his performance
in last weekend's 27-17 loss to
UCLA was merely "okay, " but
that the defense as a whole played
well.
"It was a tough loss, like so
many we've had this year," Huck
estein said. "I thought we played
well enough to win. We held their
offense [pretty well! all day long."
Unfortunately for Stanford,
Huckestein, who didn't redshirt
as a freshman, will be donning
the cardinal and white for the last
time today against California.
"[Huckesteinl is really an in
tense player, and he puts a lot of
pressure on himself to play well,
but he's had a tough time this
year with his injuries," Stanford
outside linebacker Rob Hinckley
said. "Everyone on the team likes
him, and we're really going to
miss him."
Huckestein, who doesn't seem
to be bothered by nostalgia at the
moment, is preparing for today's
game just as he has for all others
during his Stanford career.
"I'm sure when the final bell
sounds and I realize that I've
played my last game, it's going to
be tough," Huckestein said. "But
I'm going to approach it just the
same as all the others over the
past four years."
Huckestein predicts that the
game itself will be "interesting."
"[Both teams arel going to be
up for it," Huckestein said. "They
have a 5-5 record, so you know
they're not an easy team [to
beat.]"
After tomorrow's game and an
offseason to reflect on his Stan
ford career, Huckestein, a sociol
ogy major, thinks he'll "give the
NFL a shot." He has no preferred
professional team becauses he

feels he could fit in well with any
program.
Huckestein would definitely
have problems giving up a football
career that's now 15 years old. In
the second grade, he started the
sport as an offensive lineman and
linebacker.
He continued his career at
North Allegheny High School in
Pennsylvania, where he played
both offensive guard and defensive
tackle.
Despite Huckestein's 70
tackles, 60 assists and 14 sacks,
North Alleghany finished a dis
apointing 3-7 during his senior
year.
Although his school never won
a conference title, Huckestein, the
team captain, impressed a num
ber of people in the collegiate foot
ball business.
Huckestein was a three-time
Quad A West All-Conference Se
lection, a consensus High School
All-America, a USA Today first
team All-America, a Bally's first
team All-America, a Max Enfinger
first team All-America and a
member of The Sporting News'
top 100 list.
Huckestein also participated in
track and field in high school. He
threw the shot put and the discus,
but said his performance was only
"average" in those events.
He also wrestled in high school
for three years. He placed fifth
in the heavyweight division at the
state meet his junior year, but
was unable to wrestle his senior
year due to a knee injury.
