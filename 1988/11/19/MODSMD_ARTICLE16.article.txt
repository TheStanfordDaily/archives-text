# Sinclair keeps backfield happy
## 
### Steve Apfelberg Staff writer 
When fifth-year senior Andy
Sinclair steps onto the field
against California, he will be
starting his 45th straight game
as the center of the Stanford Car
dinal football team. The 6-foot-3,
280-pound Sinclair, an All-
America candidate, plays the
leading role in keeping Cardinal
quarterbacks on their feet.
Sinclair started playing football
at Edison High School in Hunt
ington Beach, Calif, where he
dabbled in basketball and base
ball. He played on the offensive
line and earned All-America
honors for his efforts during his
senior year. College football
powers such as Notre Dame, USC
and UCI.A recruited him. Sinclair
chose Stanford, however, because
Jack Elway was the new coach
and because of the school's aca
demic reputation.

"It was the best decision I could
have made," Sinclair said. "I have
been pretty lucky to have had a
lot of fun. I have no regrets. I
am glad to have been a part of it."
After redshirting his freshman
year, Sinclair has been the team's
starting center in every game for
the last four years. His favorite
Stanford football highlight was
meeting all of the people that arc
now his great friends. However,
wins against California, UCLA,
Texas and a trip to the Gator
Bowl are other highlights.
Sinclair describes the 1988
season as a very frustrating one,
especially since the team has been
playing so hard. He is proud,
though, that the team has never
given up. They have bounced back
each week and have been in every
game. "Those are the breaks that
can occur in the game of football,"
he said. "The team is young,
though, and has lots of talent that
will make the future good."

During the offseason, the public
policy mtyor hits both the books
and the weights. The second team
All-Pacific 10 Conference and
third-team All-America, Sinclair
hopes to earn first team Pac-10
honors this year. However, he
said, "I just control my own play
because you never know what is
going to happen."
Sinclair plans to enter the Na
tional Football League draft this
spring.
Although he doesn't have any
definite post-football plans,
Sinclair has thought about going
to law school because of his in
terest in law and the legal system.
He will take the LSAT this spring
to keep this option a possibility.
Although he has considered
making the law his profession, his
preference is to earn a living by
protecting quarterbacks. For four
years at Stanford, Sinclair has
certainly earned his keep.
