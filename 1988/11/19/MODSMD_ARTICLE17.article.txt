# Will intangibles decide game?
## 
### Andrew Berkowitz Senior staff writer 
It's Big Game week again —
that time of the year when two
of the nation's finest teams clash
in a titanic battle for bragging
rights to the Pacific 10 conference.
But besides the game,
don't forget the Stanford-
California contest.
No, ha ha ha, just a little joke
there. Even though Stanford and
Cal probably won't qualify for any
of the bowl games this year —
not even the ones for teams with
really mediocre records such as
the Bluebonnet Bowl or the
Liberty Bowl or the Slime Bowl
or the Nasty Stuff That Some
times Comes Out Of Your Nose
When You Sneeze Bowl — there
is much to look forward to in Big
Game.
For one thing, it gives us News
paper Football Experts a chance
to analyze every little teeny-weeny
detail about the game, to the point
that most of you may decide to
spend Saturday staring blankly at
an empty wall and chanting quar
terback statistics until the well
trained and competent doctors at
Cowell come over and put a band
aid on your brain stem.
Most of us who analyze statis
tics and make predictions about
football games are known as
"Greeks," a term derived from the
following well-known ancient
Greek myth:
The Myth of the Origin of Greeks
In the beginning there were two
gods: Zeus, the king of the gods,
and Uranus, the god of loud snick
ering in junior high, particularly
during the skit in seventh grade
when Dave Bowers said: "What's
up, Uranus?"
So Zeus sat on Mount Olympus,
and he called down to Uranus on
Mount Nikon, "I would take the
points if I were you."
But Uranus did not take the
points, for he had heard from Mer
cury, the messenger of San Jose,
that Brian Johnson, the god of
left field, might start at quarter
back for the Cardinal.
"I will not take your points,"
said Uranus.
And this angered Zeus, and he

rumbled and fumed for a day and
a night, and threw down lightning
bolts from the heavens and caused
earthquakes to rock the earth.
Finally, when Zeus saw that
Uranus would not relent, he was
forced to go to Guido's Bookmak
ing Salon to lay the points,
knowing full well that if he did
not come up with the payments
on his bet that Guido would send
Hercules, the god of Nautilus
equipment, to "teach him a les
son."
So as you can clearly see from
the above passage that first I
should probably be confined to a
padded room, but second that
there is a long and glorious his
tory of people with funny names
predicting football games.
I think this year we need to go
beyond the same old boring pre
dictions — you know, the ones
based on "completion percentage"
and "rushing average per carry
on third down" and "field goals
made by kickers who prefer stuff
ing instead of potatoes." No, this
year we need to take a look at
the "Intangibles," or, "Those
Things Which Have No Real
Bearing On the Game, But If
Analyzed In Print Could Very
Well Allow Us to Sell Lots More
Ad Space to Chinese Restaurants
Throughout the South Bay."
Therefore, ignoring the statis
tics related to the game, I have
summarized below the strengths
and weaknesses of both the Car
dinal and the Golden Bears based

"Hail Stanford, Hail" ?
Sounds like a weather
report.

solely on an analysis of the In
tangibles:
Location
Stanford is located in Palo Alto,
primarily due to the fact that
Leland Stanford Jr. died before
his parents could get all the way
to San Francisco. Berkeley, in con
trast, is located just minutes from
beautiful, vibrant, crime-free Oak
land.
Edge: Stanford.

Fight Song
I don't know what Cal's fight
song is, but it doesn't really mat
ter. Stanford's is just plain lame.
"Hail Stanford Hail?" Sounds like
a weather report. "All Right
Now?" Sounds like the fight song
for the Hoover Institute.
Edge: Cal.
Mascot
Stanford: The tree.
Yes, a tree. Not that there's
anything WRONG with having a
tree for a mascot, although as a
general rule there are better
things to strike fear into the
hearts of opponents than plants.
Cal: Vacant since 1986.
Edge: UC-Santa Cruz Banana
Slugs.
Housing
Stanford: Wilbur, Stern, Flo
Mo, Manzanita, Cro-Mem.
Cal: N/A.
Edge: Stanford.
Other Sports
Stanford students are able to
get into the spirit of Big Game
by watching their Top-20 basket
ball team, their Top-10 water polo
team and their Top-10 volleyball
team.
Cal students are able to get into
the spirit of Big Game by listening
to several top-40 radio stations.
Edge: Stanford.
Favorite Campus Rumors
Stanford: If your roommate dies
you automatically get straight-
A's.
Cal: The Axe.
Edge: U2's guitarist.
So based on a careful analysis
of the Intangibles it is clear that
Stanford should have no trouble
defeating California Saturday.
But remember the wise words of
famous late football coach Vince
Lombardi: "Boy it's cold here in
Green Bay!"
