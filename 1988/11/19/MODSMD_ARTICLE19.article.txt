# Senior Richardson anchors developing linebacking corps
## 
### Steve Apfelberg 
When fifth-year senior Kevin
Richardson began to play football
here five years ago, Stanford
coaches had no idea that he would
someday be a key player for the
Cardinal.
Now, however, the coaching
staff would have no idea what to
do without him. The 6-foot-3, 225-
pound starting left-inside line
backer doubles as the defensive
team captain.
Richardson, a Shafter, Calif, na
tive, has progressed slowly but
surely over the years. He began
playing in seventh grade and made
the varsity as a sophomore in high
school. He played offensive tackle
and linebacker at Shafter High
School.
Although Shafter is a small
town, while Richardson was on
the gridiron, an older teammate
accepted a football scholarship to
Brigham Young University. This
attention brought much exposure
to Richardson's high school and
would later help him.
After earning All-League
honors as a senior, Richardson

debated between Stanford and
California, both of which offered
him football scholarships. He
chose the Farm because of the
coaching staff and the campus.
"Stanford was definitely the
right place for me," Richardson
said. "I have no regrets."
Richardson redshirted as a
freshman. He long-snapped and
played special teams as a sopho
more and a junior. Finally, he
earned the starting spot at left
inside linebacker as a senior and
still holds that spot now as a fifth
year senior.
The highlight of Richardson's
Stanford football career has been
meeting so many good people.
"The people that I've met through
football will remain in my
memory more than any victory,"
he said.
Richardson's swan-song season
has been a rollercoaster ride. "The
loss to Washington State was very
frustrating, but much more so be
cause it was my last home game."
However, he continued, "It's
been a damn character builder.
It's been neat to see us hang to
gether so well. Most teams would
have crumbled, but we keep pat
ting each other on the back to
help keep the fighting spirit."
Richardson, an applied earth
sciences major, plans to pursue
the possiblity of a professional
football career. "I will milk foot
ball for all it's worth, if it's worth
anything," he said.
When he is finished with foot
ball, number 46 would like to
teach and to coach football. Before
then, however, Richardson has
one Big Game left.
