# Stanford travels to Cal for 91st Big Game
## 
### Robert Pardington Editorial staff 
The intensity meter reads one notch
higher than normal for today's 91st Big
Game in Berkeley. Both combatants have
reloaded since last year's 31-7 Stanford
victory over California and this year's con
test finds each teams coming off of a bruis
ing Pacific 10 Conference schedule but also
improved significantly over a year ago.
The Cardinal (3-6-1, 1-5-1 in the Pac-10)
faces the Golden Bears (5-5, 1-5) in a match
for possession of the coveted Stanford Axe
today at 1 p.m. at Memorial Stadium in
Berkeley.
California has made huge gains over last
year, particularly offensively. The Golden
Bears managed only 201 yards of total
offense last November without injured
quarterback Troy Taylor. Taylor, who will
play in his first Big Game Saturday, is
back in great form this year.
Through 10 games, Taylor has completed
almost 62 percent of his passes for 2190
yards and 15 touchdowns. The Bear signal
caller, though overshadowed by the slew
of great Pac-10 quarterbacks, has played
well by any standard.
The junior from Rancho Cordova, Calif,
has steered the Golden Bear offense to a
No. 19 ranking nationally, and has placed
himself in the top five of four different
all-time Cal passing statistics. He needs
only three touchdowns to be the No. 1
career performer in that category in Cal
history.
"[Taylor] has been having statistically a
great year," California Coach Bruce Snyder
said. "I'm certainly pleased with him as
far as leading the club. He is an excellent
quarterback."
The club that Taylor leads has had its
share of bad luck this season, suffering a
substantial number of uncontrollable mis
haps on its quest for its first winning
season since 1982.
The most blatant example of the plague
that the Golden Bears have endured is the
ridiculous "61-minute game" at Oregon
State September 17, in which Cal was
ahead after 60 minutes (the regulation
game length) but lost officially by the score
of 17-16. A referee from the Pac-10 office
later admitted that the timekeeper had
accidentally added a minute to the game
clock during the fourth quarter.
The Cardinal has been equally beset by

unfortunate turns of events, and that fact
has overshadowed many developing strong
points of this year's young group of players.
For Stanford, the defensive unit is per
haps the best the Cardinal has offered for
several years, allowing an average of 19.7
points per game. The defense held high
powered Washington State to 24 points,
their lowest output of the season, and kept
four other opponents under 12 points for
the game.
The Stanford team, as a whole, doesn't
feel like the season has been disappointing.
"We're not disappointed in how we're
playing, we've been with everyone," junior
outside linebacker Rob Hinckley said.
Indeed, the Cardinal has "been with"
almost every team it has played this year,
losing four contests by a total of 14 points.
Against USC and UCLA, both still con
tenders for the national championship,
Stanford led early on before losing by small
margins.
Last week at UCLA, the Cardinal led
14-10 at halftime only to fade in the second
half and fall 27-17. The talented Stanford
defense, spearheaded by the amazing per
formance of Hinckley and his 4Vi sacks,
diminished the Heisman Trophy hopes of
Bruin quarterback Troy Aikman by holding
him to only 170 yards passing.
The Cardinal's strength on defense
centers on junior inside linebacker Jono
Tunney and Hinckley. Tunney leads the
team in tackles with 138 but missed last
week's game against UCLA with a bruised
thigh. He is listed as "probable" for Big
Game.
Hinckley deserves all the praise in the
world after last week's performance, which
earned him the national Defensive Player
of the Week from Sports Illustrated mag
azine. Hinckley compiled 20 tackles to go
with his sacks, and has unquestionably
earned the title "impact player."
Against Cal, the Cardinal defense will
have to keep tabs on senior tailback Chris
Richards. Richards gained 152 yards and
ran for one touchdown last week against
Washington, and has 702 yards in eight
games this season.
Senior fullback Todd Powers rounds out
a solid Cal backfield. Powers is especially
dangerous as a receiver, leading the Golden
Bears in receptions with 40 on the year.
On defense, the superstar Bear is junior
inside linebacker David Ortega. Ortega had
an incredible 24 tackles against Stanford

in last year's Big Game, and leads Cal with
119 total tackles so far this year.
The Bear's best offensive weapon may
be sophomore placekicker and punter
Robbie Keen. Keen has not missed an extra
point this year in 22 tries, and is a remark
able 17-of-19 on field goals.
From beyond 40 yards, Keen is an un
heard of 10-for-10, including a blast of 55
yards that is the best in the Pac-10 this
year. Keen also handles the punting duties
for California, and is tied for the Pac-10

lead with an average of 42.6 yards per kick.
Stanford counters with their own soph
omore placekicker/punter, John Hopkins.
Hopkins numbers are average as regular
kickers go, but compared to a phenom like
Keen, his accomplishments look paltry.
Hopkins has been good on 75 percent of
his attempts this year, and has missed only
one extra point. Both young kickers should
improve even more and become prime can-

Although hobbled by nagging injuries this season, junior defensive end Lester
Archambeau, has been a mainstay of the Cardinal pass rush this season, gathering
58 tackles, including five for losses.
