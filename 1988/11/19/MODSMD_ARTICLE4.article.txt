# Receiver Pinckney thrives on emotion, hype
## Freshman likes packed stadiums, hushed opponents 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Making his first collegiate start
in front of 59,075 boisterous, hos
tile fans and a national television
audience is nerve-racking for
many a gridiron star. For Cardinal
wide receiver Jon Pinckney, how
ever, that afternoon in South
Bend, Ind. was the highlight of
his season.
For the redshirt freshman,
starting against Notre Dame was
the fulfillment of a childhood
dream. It was watching Penn
State and others every autumn
Saturday that made collegiate ball
Pinckney's athletic goal. And al
though neither the Notre Dame
squad nor spectators were too
kind to the Cardinal, he's itching
to return.
"I'd rather play any day of the
week in Notre Dame with its hos
tile crowd than in Oregon with
only 15,000 people," Pinckney
said. "People try to psych you out
about big road games, but I love
it when the stadium is packed and
we shut up the home crowd."
While Pinckney's name has
been at least recognized by fellow
students since his 75-yard touch
down reception against Oregon
State, he has not exactly been a
household word among the Car
dinal faithful. In fact, in Septem
ber, the backup was not even
slated to see much time this
season.
One of five receivers in his
recruiting class, Pinckney was
third on the receiving depth chart
after spring ball and was told to
be prepared for a possible role as

backup slotback. But an intense
summer and a key injury dram
atically altered Pinckney's role in
the coaching staff s plans.
While fellow students were
home visting high school friends
and hitting the beaches, Pinckney
was on campus playing football
But working out with former
Stanford stars Jeff James, Toi
Cook and a number of 49er hope
fuls gave the speedy receiver the
extra edge in adjusting to college
ball. Not only did the current pro
fessional players help the Penn
sylvania native's offensive skills,
but they also helped prepare
Pinckney for the moves he would
soon be needing to outwit col
legiate defensive backs.
"It really helped me out a lot
because I learned things a coach
might not be able to tell me —
especially adjusting to the second
ary," Pinckney said.
"He definitely was not in my
plans to play as much as he is,"
receivers Coach Dave Baldwin
said. "But after this summer dur
ing which he really improved his
running and reading defense
skills, he came into my picture
this fall."
Coupled with a season-ending
injury to starting wide receiver
Ed McCaffrey (who has been red
shirted for the year), Pinckney's
new-found skills were enough to
thrust him into the Cardinal's
master plans for this season. So
much so, in fact, that he has
platooned at starting wide
receiver with senior Henry Green.
In addition to the caliber of the
secondary he is facing this season,
the high school gridiron hotshot

from Bethlehem Catholic in the
heart of Penn State country has
also had to adjust to a new type
of passing game. Whereas
Pinckney averaged 30 yards a
reception in high school, the Car
dinal has been using a primarily
short passing game this season.
Even his 75-yard reception was
actualy a six-yard outlet pattern,
after which he burned his
defender.
"I didn't even know there was
such a thing as a pass under 10
yards when I got here," he said.
Stanford's passing game was
the primary reason Pinckney
chose the Farm for his collegiate
football career, however. Highly
recruited out of high school, he
narrowed his future down to
Stanford, Vanderbilt and Penn
State before signing with the Car
dinal. His reasons aside from the
Cardinal's tendency to taking to
the air? The weather.
"It was minus 10 degrees when
I left home and 55 when I stepped
off the plane that January. Be
sides not being a pass oriented
squad, it's just too cold in Penn
sylvania." he said. "In addition,
Stanford is just too hard to turn
down. The Pac-10 is a great league
and the school just sells itself."
After only his first year of ac
tion, Pinckney feels he is adjust
ing fairly well to Stanford and
collegiate ball. Pacific 10 Confer
ence defensive backs no longer in
timidate him, especially after
going against Notre Dame's sec
ondary. While Southern Califor

against Oregon State.
of most skilled defender in
Pinckney's opinion, Notre Dame's
defensive backs prepared him for
the remainder of this season.
"After playing against them I've
really felt comfortable on the
field," Pinckney said. "I really
learned how to take a beating.
They play just as hard in the
fourth quarter as in the first."
And Pinckney's statistics echo
this sentiment. While sixth on the
Cardinal in total receptions, his
14 yards a catch ranks him second
on the squad behind fellow wide
receiver Walter Batson. And his
106 yards against the Beavers still
is the most receiving yards in a
single contest this season.
In addition to his receiving abil
ity, however, Pinckney is known
among his teammates for a second
on field skill — out-talking his
opponents. While not the only
player in the NCAA, or even on
the Cardinal, to use the tactic of
verbal abuse to try to gain an
advantage over his defenders, the
first-year player seems to have
honed his extra curricular field
talents.
"I talk to defensive backs just

to upset them and get them going.
If you can get someone riled up
they might lose their concentra
tion and do something stupid. I've
paid the price a couple of times,
but its fun when it works."
Pinckney does not just wait for
game day to try out his psycho
logical tactics. He even practices
on teammates during the week,
especially on cornerback Kevin
Scott. Pinckney thinks the verbal
assault may have paid off in the
Oregon State contest, when he
made five catches and burned his
defender for the 75 yard touch
down.
While not encouraged by his su
periors, Pinckney's actions are
not forbidden. "I prefer that we
show our emotions through our
actions," Baldwin said. "But as
long he's clean we're not going to
stop him."
Although senior Henry Green
is starting today's contest,
Pinckney, sure to see action, is
excited to use his various talents
against California in his first Big
Game.
"After playing against Notre
Dame and UCLA, I'm not im
pressed by the (California)
players, and if we don't win I'll
be disappointed. But I still can't
wait to play in the Big Game,"
he said.
