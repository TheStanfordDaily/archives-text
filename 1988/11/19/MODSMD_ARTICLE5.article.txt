# Crazy Tree likes the wild
## 
### John Louie 
One of the most integral parts of life at
Stanford is the Tree. Omnipresent at every
football and basketball game, band rally
and cultural event, the Tree is as common
to the Farm as Mickey Mouse is to Dis
neyland. One can't help but notice the
8-foot-6, foam-and-cloth character lumber
ing around to the beat of the Stanford
Band.
When one first meets the Tree one ex
pects to see the character in costume. One
expects to suppress the urge to laugh while
attempting to conduct a conversation with
an awkwardly adorned mascot.
But, when one meets the Tree, the one
thing known for certain is that the Tree
is, as he puts it, one "wild and crazy guy."
Even in his civilian identity, it wasn't
difficult locating the Tree in a room full
of people. Calmly reclining on a couch, he
was reading James Joyce while stabbing
an effigy of Oski, the Cal mascot, with a
gilded plastic sword.
"Let me tell you a little about my roots,"
he said.
"I was born in Mascoutah, 111., a real
Midwest town," the Tree explained. "In
high school, I was an Indian mascot, just
like Stanford used to have. I jumped
around, danced with cheerleaders, skipped
around the track and basically got the
coaches to laugh and play with me. It was
fun, but it was rough."
The Tree felt destined in his younger
years to don the pinery that is symbolic
of the spirit of Stanford.
"Last year," the Tree said, "as a fresh
man, I was at Big Game, and last year's
Tree, Paul Brendan Kelly 111, was getting

knocked around by the Cal band. My first
instinct was to rush down from the crowd
and save him. That's when I knew I was
destined to be the Tree.
"But one doesn't become a tree over
night," he said. "I had to undergo a long,
arcane process, like an interview for IBM.
There was an application to fill out, with
questions like 'What's your favorite dog?'
Luckily, I already knew that mine was
poodle with chives and seasonings â€” lightly
broiled," he said.
"Then it gets kooky. In order to actually
win the position of the Tree, you basically
have to go through the entire Band
hierarchy. I had to bribe and lust my way
up to the top."
And his fellow members in the band
definitely feel the shadow of the Tree. "He's
a total psycho," said one freshman Band
member. "The Tree is the scariest guy
you've ever seen."
Those dedicated foresters who have fol
lowed the antics of the Tree since its origin
in 1978 might be shocked at this Tree's
comments. Last year's Tree was, in his
sucessor's words, "big on the image bit.
He saw the Tree as an icon, a demi-god."
"I see the Tree as a big, fun, rooting
section for Stanford," he said. "I'm a little
bit more laid back with the 'image' deal.
Basically, I'm just a party tree."
One person who could attest to this self
definition is the cameraman who accom
panied the Tree during the Stanford-USC
game. "In honor of USC," said the Tree,
"I put a big condom on the top of myself
and went over to the visitors' section at
halftime.
