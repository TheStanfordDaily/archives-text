# QB 'controversy' hushed by both starters
## Palumbis will start after being replaced last week 
### Andrew Wilcox 
On the heels of Stanford red
shirt freshman quarterback Jason
Palumbis' abrupt removal in fa
vor of backup Brian Johnson in
the second quarter of last week's
27-17 loss to UCLA, a quarter
back controversy seemed to be
brewing.
However, coach Jack Elway dis
pelled this notion by naming
Palumbis as the starter for
today's game early this week.
Palumbis will be starting his
seventh consecutive game since
replacing Johnson in the season's
fourth contest against Notre
Dame. "I didn't know what to
think after being pulled. I was
surprised, but I don't second
guess Elway," Palumbis said. "I
know he does what's best for the
team. . . . Brian did a great job."
The removal of Palumbis last
week was unexpected, especially
in light of his statistics before the
change. He completed 9-of-10
passes for 71 yards, but his 10th
pass was intercepted by the
Bruins, who appeared on the
verge of a blowout with a 10-0
lead at that juncture.
Johnson seemed to inject life
into the Cardinal offense, leading
Stanford to a 14-10 halftime lead
and finishing 14-of-26 for 123
yards, with one touchdown and
three interceptions, although two
of those resulted from deflections.
In spite of Johnson's effective
ness against the sixth ranked
Bruins, Elway affirmed Palumbis'
position Monday at a press con
ference. "It'll be Jason. ... If we
beat Cal I made the right decision,

if I didn't the season is over,"
Elway said.
Explaining his decision, Elway
joked. "I had a vision. I woke up
at four in the morning and said
it was Jason," Elway said.
Palumbis said he is glad Elway
announced the starter early in the
week. "It's better for Brian and
I to know who will be playing and
it's better for the team," Palumbis
said. " It's good knowing early in
the week that you'll be playing

because you know you'll have to
be mentally prepared."
Elway added that he decided to
announce his choice early to alle
viate any pressure or suspense for
the two quarterbacks regarding
the decision.
The prospect of being replaced
again does not bother Palumbis.
"It could if I dwelled on it,"
Palumbis said. "I just know I have
to do my job. I'm counting on
playing the whole game." He
added that he does not feel pres
sure from Johnson. "Brian is a
friend and an awful good quar
terback, " Palumbis said.
Although Johnson, who started
the season's first four games, will
again convert to the backup role,
Elway was content with Johnson's
relief performance against UCLA.

"Brian came in and did some good
things. He got to an uncovered
receiver a couple of times,
scrambled when the receivers
were covered," Elway said.
Going into his first Big Game,
Palumbis said he does not know
quite what to expect. "I haven't
stepped on the field yet (for a Big
Game), but I'm excited to go out
and give it my best shot. There's
such a great tradition surround
ing Big Game," Palumbis said.

It's better for Brian and I to know who will be
playing and it's better for the team. It's good
to know early in the week that you're going to
play'

Johnson led the Cardinal to a
31-7 shellacking of the Golden
Bears in last year's Big Game,
finishing 14-of-21 for 202 yards
with one touchdown and one in
terception.
On the season, Palumbis has
superior stats to Johnson, having
completed 57 percent of his passes
for 1,388 yards, with eight touch
downs and six interceptions. By
comparison, Johnson has con
nected on 53 percent for 767
yards, with three touchdowns and
seven interceptions.
Beginning next year, Palumbis
and Johnson will have to face yet
another contender to the quarter
back position. Freshman Steve
Smith, from Louisiana, is ex
pected to press for the starting
slot.

Redshirt freshman quarterback Jason Palumbis Stanford's starting
signal caller the last six games, will start again today inspite of
being replaced by sophomore Brian Johnson against UCLA.
On the heels of Stanford red
shirt freshman quarterback Jason
Palumbis' abrupt removal in fa
vor of backup Brian Johnson in
the second quarter of last week's
27-17 loss to UCLA, a quarter
back controversy seemed to be
brewing.
However, coach Jack Elway dis
pelled this notion by naming
Palumbis as the starter for
today's game early this week.
Palumbis will be starting his
seventh consecutive game since
replacing Johnson in the season's
fourth contest against Notre
Dame. "I didn't know what to
think after being pulled. I was
surprised, but I don't second
guess Elway," Palumbis said. "I
know he does what's best for the
team. . . . Brian did a great job."
The removal of Palumbis last
week was unexpected, especially
in light of his statistics before the
change. He completed 9-of-10
passes for 71 yards, but his 10th
pass was intercepted by the
Bruins, who appeared on the
verge of a blowout with a 10-0
lead at that juncture.
Johnson seemed to inject life
into the Cardinal offense, leading
Stanford to a 14-10 halftime lead
and finishing 14-of-26 for 123
yards, with one touchdown and
three interceptions, although two
of those resulted from deflections.
In spite of Johnson's effective
ness against the sixth ranked
Bruins, Elway affirmed Palumbis'
position Monday at a press con
ference. "It'll be Jason. ... If we
beat Cal I made the right decision,

if I didn't the season is over,"
Elway said.
Explaining his decision, Elway
joked. "I had a vision. I woke up
at four in the morning and said
it was Jason," Elway said.
Palumbis said he is glad Elway
announced the starter early in the
week. "It's better for Brian and
I to know who will be playing and
it's better for the team," Palumbis
said. " It's good knowing early in
the week that you'll be playing

because you know you'll have to
be mentally prepared."
Elway added that he decided to
announce his choice early to alle
viate any pressure or suspense for
the two quarterbacks regarding
the decision.
The prospect of being replaced
again does not bother Palumbis.
"It could if I dwelled on it,"
Palumbis said. "I just know I have
to do my job. I'm counting on
playing the whole game." He
added that he does not feel pres
sure from Johnson. "Brian is a
friend and an awful good quar
terback, " Palumbis said.
Although Johnson, who started
the season's first four games, will
again convert to the backup role,
Elway was content with Johnson's
relief performance against UCLA.

"Brian came in and did some good
things. He got to an uncovered
receiver a couple of times,
scrambled when the receivers
were covered," Elway said.
Going into his first Big Game,
Palumbis said he does not know
quite what to expect. "I haven't
stepped on the field yet (for a Big
Game), but I'm excited to go out
and give it my best shot. There's
such a great tradition surround
ing Big Game," Palumbis said.

It's better for Brian and I to know who will be
playing and it's better for the team. It's good
to know early in the week that you're going to
play'

Johnson led the Cardinal to a
31-7 shellacking of the Golden
Bears in last year's Big Game,
finishing 14-of-21 for 202 yards
with one touchdown and one in
terception.
On the season, Palumbis has
superior stats to Johnson, having
completed 57 percent of his passes
for 1,388 yards, with eight touch
downs and six interceptions. By
comparison, Johnson has con
nected on 53 percent for 767
yards, with three touchdowns and
seven interceptions.
Beginning next year, Palumbis
and Johnson will have to face yet
another contender to the quarter
back position. Freshman Steve
Smith, from Louisiana, is ex
pected to press for the starting
slot.
