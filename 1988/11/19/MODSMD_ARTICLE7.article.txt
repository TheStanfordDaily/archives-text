# Stanford fans will never forget the Play

Kevin Moen still gets calls about
it.
It has been six years (almost to
the day) since Moen scored the
game-winning touchdown for Cal
ifornia in the 1982 Big Game on
"The Play," a stranger-than
fiction kickoff return that in
cluded five laterals and ended
with Moen cutting through the
Stanford Band into the end zone,
where he collided with Band trom
bonist Gary Tyrrell.
That game was Moen's last at
Cal. He is out of football now. He
tried out for the Los Angeles
Raiders and Denver Broncos of
the National Football League, but
was released by both teams. Then
he worked as a history teacher
and football coach at South High
School in Torrance for a few years.
Now he is working for a develop
ment company in Torrance. He is

married and has a 2Vfe-year-old
baby girl, Jamie.
The years since the Play have
"just kind of flown by," Moen says.
Six years, in fact, have flown
by since Nov. 20, 1982, and still
people call Moen about the Play.
"I don't mind talking about it,"
he says. "It's a good feeling ...
it was a real pleasant note to end
my senior year on."
But Moen says he can under
stand how Stanford fans might
be tired of hearing about the Play.
"I was on the right side of it, so
it's nice to remember," he says.
"If I had been on the other side
of it, I'd probably be getting sick
of hearing about it."
A lot of people from Stanford,
in fact, would just as soon forget
that the Play ever happened. For
them, mention of the Play, even
six years later, is about as pleasant
as a poke in the eye with a sharp
stick.

Asked about it, they reply
testily if at all.
Stanford Athletic Director Andy
Geiger is one of those people.
Would you mind answering
some questions about the Play?
Geiger was asked a year ago this
week.
"Yes."
FYbu would mind?
"Yes."
Okay...
"1 just blot it out of my
memory. .. . Does that give you
some idea of how I feel about it?"
Yes.
Paul Wiggin, who was Stan
ford's head coach in 1982 and is
now the defensive line coach for
the Minnesota Vikings of the
NFL, also doesn't want to talk
about the Play.
"I've answered all those things
so many damn times ... they're
in every film and every story,"
he said in a phone interview from
the Vikings office in Minneapolis
last year. "I don't think there's
anything else to be said.
"You just go on with your life."
And the Play seems to be going
on with a life of its own. It's
immortalized in countless high
light films and videotapes, on T
shirts (a red shirt with the title
"The 11-20-82 Robbery" for Stan
ford and a gold shirt with the
title, "The Play" for Cal fans), in
a 12-page Sports Illustrated story
that is the definitive account of
the episode, and in the memories
of everyone who witnessed the
game or saw the tape on the news
that day or in ensuing weeks.
That people's memories of the
Play are so clear is testimony to
its singular place in college foot
ball history.
"It will go down in history as
the all-time unusual football
game," said referee Charles Mof
fett.
The 1982 Big Game was Mof
fett's second-to-last as a Pacific
10 Conference official. He worked
the USC-Notre Dame game a
week later, then retired from of
ficiating.

The Play was not a factor in
his decision to retire. But was it
the strangest play he had seen in
23 years of Pac-10 officiating?
"By far," he says. "That beat
everything."
There's plenty of agreement on
that point.
"Sure, it's the most amazing
thing I've ever seen in college foot
ball," says Stanford Sports Infor
mation Director Steve Raczynski.
"It's the most amazing thing
anyone has ever seen in college
football. ... I feel very confident
in saying that. There's nothing
that even comes close to that."
For Raczynski, the Play was an
eye-opening introduction to the
world of Big Game football. He
had come to Stanford the previous
summer after leaving a job as
sports information director at
Princeton University in Prince
ton, N.J.
That fall he was an assistant
sports information director at
Stanford and — fatefully or seren
dipitously ... he was slated to
take over as sports information
director the day after the 1982
Big Game.
Raczynski was in the press box
of California's Memorial Stadium
as the game wound to a finish.
"I was feeling pretty good about
the game," he recalls. "We had
just taken a 20-19 lead on a mar
velous drive engineered by (quar
terback) John Klway.
That drive included a fourth
and-17 play at Stanford's own 13-
yard line, with Elway drilling a
29-yard pass to wide receiver
Emile Harry for the first down.
With eight seconds left in the
game, sophomore kicker Mark
Harmon kicked a 35-yard field
goal to give Stanford the lead.
Four seconds remained on the
clock after the field goal.
"We were four seconds away
from going to a bowl game," Rac
zynski nays.
Indeed, the bowl representative
from the Hall of Fame Bowl was
sitting in the press box, near Rac
zynski, narrating the game over

the phone to his secretary. After
Harmon's field goal, he was
making arrangements to confirm
that Stanford, whose season
record would go to 6-5 with the
victory, would be a participant in
the bowl, to be held that year in
Birmingham, Ala. Stanford stood
to gain valuable national exposure
and healthy revenues . . . both of
which help immeasurably with
recruiting . . . from the bowl ap
pear an ce.
Then Stanford lined up to kick
off. The Cardinal had been
penalized 15 yards on the kickoff
because several players and
coaches had run onto the field in
celebration after Harmon's appar
ently game-winning field goal.
So Harmon was lined up to kick
from his own 25-yard line. Mof
fett, meanwhile, was stationed
well behind the Cal receiving
team, at "about the 5- or 10-yard
line," he says.
When Harmon's squib kick was
fielded by Moen around the Cal
44, "I was about 40 yards behind
the play," Moffett says."l trailed
the play slowly, expecting that the
ballcarrier would be tackled at any
second and the game would be
over."
What unfolded in front of Mof
fett's eyes was almost too much
for even a long-time football ob
server like himself to believe.
"All of a sudden I notice that
the ball isn't going down," Moffett
says.
Moffett watched as Moen threw
an overhand lateral to teammate
Richard Rodgers, who advanced a
few yards before lateraling to
Dwight Garner. Garner, who
fielded Rodgers' toss at the Cal
43, advanced about six yards
before getting hit by Cardinal
linebacker David Wyman. An
other Cardinal linebacker, Mark
Andrew, joined Wyman, and still
another linebacker, redshirt
freshman Jack Gilmete, was the
third man to hit Garner.
At that point, Raczynski, in the

1982 Big Game.
press box, turned away from the
play. "Every Stanford person will
tell you that Garner was down,"
he said. "When Garner was going
down, I turned away, because to
my mind, the play was over."
He was wrong. Gilmete, who is
now the outside linebackers coach
for the Stanford team, picks up
the narrative:
"I was the third guy to hit him
(Garner), and I thought he was
down," he says. "But the ball just
sort of squirted out of the pile."
"I actually know him (Garner),"
Gilmete says,"and I've asked him
a few times since then if he was
down, but he won't admit it."
Whether or not his knee hit the
artificial turf or his forward prog
ress was stopped, Garner man
aged to get off a toss back to
Rodgers, and the play continued.

In the locker room after the game, Elway
uttered his now well-known quote:
'These guys (the officials) ruined my
last game as a college player. This is a
farce and a joke.'

Moffett was still trailing the ac
tion at a somewhat leisurely pace
at that point. "Then I saw the
Stanford Band starting to march
out on the field," he says. "When
I saw that, I said . .. well, I can't
tell you on the phone what I said.
But when I saw that I started to
run a little faster."
The Band had come down onto

the field level of Memorial Sta
dium near the end of the game
to get into position for its tradi
tional postgame concert.
Because Cal's stadium is a true
football stadium, there is little
space between the stands and the
field, so as the Band snaked be
hind the end zone on its way to
the Stanford student section,
some Band members naturally
spilled into the back of the end
zone.
"(In Cal's stadium] you're
either in the stands or on the
field, so we were on the field,"
says then-Drum Major "Disco"
Ray Gruenewald, who now works
for Boeing in Seattle. "And then
we were even more on the field."
When Harmon kicked his field
goal, the Band had broken into
its traditional fight song, "All
Right Now."
Most of the Band members
were still off the field at that time.
From where they were standing,

they could see very little of the
action because of the "dramatic"
crown of the Memorial Stadium
field, says John Howard, who was
the manager of the Band then.
They could, however, see the clock
tick down to :00 and they could
see several Stanford players run
onto the field when Garner was
apparently down.

Both of those things signalled
that the game must be over, and
the Band charged the field. Tyr
rell, meanwhile, held his ground
in the end zone, "just kind of
celebrating," as he says now.
"I don't think that Gary (Tyr
rell) was in the wrong place,"
Howard says.
Rodgers, meanwhile, had taken
Garner's desperate lateral and
run to the Stanford 46, at which
point he lateraled to Mariet Ford.
Ford carried the ball to the 24
before flipping the ball behind
him, hoping that the trailing Moen
would pick it up. Moen grabbed
the ball and soon found himself
in the middle of the Stanford
Band.
"I thought it was kind of weird
that there were that many people
on the field," Moen recalls. "But
my main intention was just to
score, so I just put my head down
and ran."
Then, fatefully, the paths of
Moen and Tyrrell crossed. Tyrrell
was still in the end zone celebrat
ing when Moen arrived there to
do a little celebrating of his own.
"I just saw him out of the cor
ner of my eye," Tyrrell says."ln
fact there was a picture in The
San Jose Mercury News the next
day, of [Moen] jumping up to spike
the ball, and that was almost ex
actly what I saw."
Moen, for his part, didn't see
Tyrrell until it was too late. "I
really didn't fully intend to run
over him," Moen says."l was just
kind of celebrating and he hap
pened to be in the way."
And when Moen came down
from his exultant leap, he landed
square on Tyrrell, who was sent
sprawling in the end zone.
Moffett, of course, didn't see
any of this. Moen had "just dis
appeared into the Band," he says.

But as pandemonium broke out
in the stadium, Moffett, as chief
of the officiating crew, had to de
termine just what had happened.
"I gathered all the officials .. .
which was pretty difficult because
there were so many people on the
field," he says."And I asked all
of them two questions: 'Did
anybody blow their whistle, call
ing the play dead?' and 'Were all
those laterals legal?' Then I asked

Whether or riot his knee hit the artificial turf
or his forward progress was stopped, Garner
managed to get off a toss back to Rodgers
and the play continued.

one guy a third question: 'Did he
(Moen) score?' He said, 'Yes,' and
I said, 'Well, then we have a score,'
and I put up my arms to signal
a touchdown. . . .
"It didn't really sink in until a
little later what had happened,"
he continues. "Then we were in
the locker room, and we just said
to ourselves, 'Gosh, we'd just seen
history made.' "
Stanford's players weren't
happy to have been part of the
history-making.
"We were furious," Gilmete
recalls. "There were just so many
things wrong with that play."
In the locker room after the
game, Elway uttered his now
well-known quote: "These guys
[the officials] ruined my last game
as a college player. Tnis is a farce
and a joke."
Moffett said he occasionally
sees Elway these days when the
Denver Bronco quarterback comes
to Seattle to play the Seahawks.
"We've talked about [the Play],"

Moffett says."He (Elway) was bit
ter, and understandably so ... but
we laugh about it now."
Moffett says that he and Elway
have agreed in talking about the
1982 Big Game that Stanford's
biggest mistake probably was not
running down the clock more
before Harmon's field goal.
He also says that even if Moen
hadn't scored on the Play — if
he had been knocked down by a

Band member or even by a Stan
ford player — the game wouldn't
have been over.
"We would have had to call a
penalty on Stanford for having
too many men on the field (several
had run on, thinking Garner was
down), and would have given Cal
one more play to score," he says.
The Play made celebrities out
of Moen and Tyrrell. For a year
after it happened, Tyrrell got an
average of a call a week, he says.
"I sort of got to appreciate it
more later," he says. "But right
after it happened, I was concerned
because it wasn't really humorous
to the football team."
Relations between the football
team and the Band were "tense
for a while," Howard says.
Howard is another person who
doesn't enjoy talking about the
Play. "It was devastating at the
time," he says. "A lot of us worked
really hard to make that Hand
pood ... we thought we'd made
real solid gains and |the Play] was
a PR disaster."
Predictably, the Play raised the
Band's profile. Rut that wasn't
an entirely good thing. "It was
sort of like Andy Warhol's 15
minutes," Howard says. "We be
came notorious, but that's not the
image we wanted to have."
Still, the Hand made between
$20,000 and $50,000 in appear

ance fees the following year, 10
times more than it had ever made
in any previous year, says Gary
D. Robinson, who, in the tradi
tional Band transition, was sched
uled to become Band manager as
soon as the 1982 Big Game ended.
"1 was the assistant manager
when the Play started, and the
manager when it ended," he says
now, with a rueful laugh.
Robinson and the rest of the
Band took a lot of heat for a while
("We had that hellish period when
everyone was down on us," Rob
inson says), but managed to retain
their sense of humor. At the 1983
Rig Game, they poked fun at

themselves, recreating the Play
and turning it inside out.
With Cal returning the kickofT,
Tyrrell, playing himself, leaped
from a wheelchair to force a
fumble and then ran the ball back
for a touchdown. "It gave me a
great deal of joy to hear the crowd
hooting and cheering for that"
says Tyrrell, who now works for
an electronics company in Red
wood City.
Stanford also lost that Big
Game, though, to close out the
1983 season with a 1-10 record.
How much the Play bad to do
with that is subject to debate
Wiggin, who had announced nis

resignation under pressure a week
before the 1983 Big Game, says
the Play's impact was negligible.
"I don't think it carried over (into
the 1983 season 1," he says."l just
think we weren't a real good foot
ball team."
Tyrrell still attends Stanford's
home football games. Looking
back, what does he think of the
Play? "I think it represented a
clear lack of control over the game
by the officials and the fans," he
said.
Moffett, though, feels confident
that his crew made the right call.
And he's thankful to have been
part of the historic game. "That

was one of the great football
games of all time long before that
five-lateral thing," he says. "It's
just too bad somebody had to
lose."
Six years afler the fact, Gilmete
has similar feelings about the
Play. "It's the kind of thing you
can laugh about later," he says.
"It's kind of unique, but kind of
humiliating at the same time."
The lesson of the Play, Gilmete
says, is simple: When it comes to
Big Game, "you just can't take
anything for granted."
