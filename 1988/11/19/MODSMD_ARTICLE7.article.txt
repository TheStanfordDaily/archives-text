# Stanford fans will never forget the Play

Kevin Moen still gets calls about
it.
It has been six years (almost to
the day) since Moen scored the
game-winning touchdown for Cal
ifornia in the 1982 Big Game on
"The Play," a stranger-than
fiction kickoff return that in
cluded five laterals and ended
with Moen cutting through the
Stanford Band into the end zone,
where he collided with Band trom
bonist Gary Tyrrell.
That game was Moen's last at
Cal. He is out of football now. He
tried out for the Los Angeles
Raiders and Denver Broncos of
the National Football League, but
was released by both teams. Then
he worked as a history teacher
and football coach at South High
School in Torrance for a few years.
Now he is working for a develop
ment company in Torrance. He is

married and has a 2Vfe-year-old
baby girl, Jamie.
The years since the Play have
"just kind of flown by," Moen says.
Six years, in fact, have flown
by since Nov. 20, 1982, and still
people call Moen about the Play.
"I don't mind talking about it,"
he says. "It's a good feeling ...
it was a real pleasant note to end
my senior year on."
But Moen says he can under
stand how Stanford fans might
be tired of hearing about the Play.
"I was on the right side of it, so
it's nice to remember," he says.
"If I had been on the other side
of it, I'd probably be getting sick
of hearing about it."
A lot of people from Stanford,
in fact, would just as soon forget
that the Play ever happened. For
them, mention of the Play, even
six years later, is about as pleasant
as a poke in the eye with a sharp
stick.

Asked about it, they reply
testily if at all.
Stanford Athletic Director Andy
Geiger is one of those people.
Would you mind answering
some questions about the Play?
Geiger was asked a year ago this
week.
"Yes."
FYbu would mind?
"Yes."
Okay...
"1 just blot it out of my
memory. .. . Does that give you
some idea of how I feel about it?"
Yes.
Paul Wiggin, who was Stan
ford's head coach in 1982 and is
now the defensive line coach for
the Minnesota Vikings of the
NFL, also doesn't want to talk
about the Play.
"I've answered all those things
so many damn times ... they're
in every film and every story,"
he said in a phone interview from
the Vikings office in Minneapolis
last year. "I don't think there's
anything else to be said.
"You just go on with your life."
And the Play seems to be going
on with a life of its own. It's
immortalized in countless high
light films and videotapes, on T
shirts (a red shirt with the title
"The 11-20-82 Robbery" for Stan
ford and a gold shirt with the
title, "The Play" for Cal fans), in
a 12-page Sports Illustrated story
that is the definitive account of
the episode, and in the memories
of everyone who witnessed the
game or saw the tape on the news
that day or in ensuing weeks.
That people's memories of the
Play are so clear is testimony to
its singular place in college foot
ball history.
"It will go down in history as
the all-time unusual football
game," said referee Charles Mof
fett.
The 1982 Big Game was Mof
fett's second-to-last as a Pacific
10 Conference official. He worked
the USC-Notre Dame game a
week later, then retired from of
ficiating.

The Play was not a factor in
his decision to retire. But was it
the strangest play he had seen in
23 years of Pac-10 officiating?
"By far," he says. "That beat
everything."
There's plenty of agreement on
that point.
"Sure, it's the most amazing
thing I've ever seen in college foot
ball," says Stanford Sports Infor
mation Director Steve Raczynski.
"It's the most amazing thing
anyone has ever seen in college
football. ... I feel very confident
in saying that. There's nothing
that even comes close to that."
For Raczynski, the Play was an
eye-opening introduction to the
world of Big Game football. He
had come to Stanford the previous
summer after leaving a job as
sports information director at
Princeton University in Prince
ton, N.J.
That fall he was an assistant
sports information director at
Stanford and — fatefully or seren
dipitously ... he was slated to
take over as sports information
director the day after the 1982
Big Game.
Raczynski was in the press box
of California's Memorial Stadium
as the game wound to a finish.
"I was feeling pretty good about
the game," he recalls. "We had
just taken a 20-19 lead on a mar
velous drive engineered by (quar
terback) John Klway.
That drive included a fourth
and-17 play at Stanford's own 13-
yard line, with Elway drilling a
29-yard pass to wide receiver
Emile Harry for the first down.
With eight seconds left in the
game, sophomore kicker Mark
Harmon kicked a 35-yard field
goal to give Stanford the lead.
Four seconds remained on the
clock after the field goal.
"We were four seconds away
from going to a bowl game," Rac
zynski nays.
Indeed, the bowl representative
from the Hall of Fame Bowl was
sitting in the press box, near Rac
zynski, narrating the game over

the phone to his secretary. After
Harmon's field goal, he was
making arrangements to confirm
that Stanford, whose season
record would go to 6-5 with the
victory, would be a participant in
the bowl, to be held that year in
Birmingham, Ala. Stanford stood
to gain valuable national exposure
and healthy revenues . . . both of
which help immeasurably with
recruiting . . . from the bowl ap
pear an ce.
Then Stanford lined up to kick
off. The Cardinal had been
penalized 15 yards on the kickoff
because several players and
coaches had run onto the field in
celebration after Harmon's appar
ently game-winning field goal.
So Harmon was lined up to kick
from his own 25-yard line. Mof
fett, meanwhile, was stationed
well behind the Cal receiving
team, at "about the 5- or 10-yard
line," he says.
When Harmon's squib kick was
fielded by Moen around the Cal
44, "I was about 40 yards behind
the play," Moffett says."l trailed
the play slowly, expecting that the
ballcarrier would be tackled at any
second and the game would be
over."
What unfolded in front of Mof
fett's eyes was almost too much
for even a long-time football ob
server like himself to believe.
"All of a sudden I notice that
the ball isn't going down," Moffett
says.
Moffett watched as Moen threw
an overhand lateral to teammate
Richard Rodgers, who advanced a
few yards before lateraling to
Dwight Garner. Garner, who
fielded Rodgers' toss at the Cal
43, advanced about six yards
before getting hit by Cardinal
linebacker David Wyman. An
other Cardinal linebacker, Mark
Andrew, joined Wyman, and still
another linebacker, redshirt
freshman Jack Gilmete, was the
third man to hit Garner.
At that point, Raczynski, in the
