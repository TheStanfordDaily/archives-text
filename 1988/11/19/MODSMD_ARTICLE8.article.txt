# Coveted Axe has sordid past, rich tradition
## 
### Chris Myers 
A sharp piece of metal suitable
for cutting wood, rendered virtu
ally useless by its lack of a handle.
An object of jealousy, thievery,
competition, bloodlust. A symbol
of one of the longest-standing and
richest rivalries in collegiate ath
letics. The spoils of Big Game.
The Axe.
Now it is mounted neatly on
polished mahogony, its 14-inch
blade shined and clean. Below it
is a plaque bearing the scores of
past Big Games. Its heading
reads, "The Stanford Axe —
Forged March 1899. Captured by
California April 15, 1899. Recap
tured by Stanford April 3, 1930.
To be awarded annually to the
winner of the Big Game."
It is a simple inscription; it
belies the coveted weapon's
tumultuous past. The sharp edge
of passion surrounding the Axe
seems to have been dulled in
recent years, perhaps because its
transfer from school to school is
so orderly now, with the trophy
tidily turning over to, or being
retained by, the Big Game winner.
But in days of old, the Axe was
more of a mascot than a trophy,
and its owner could hold on to it
as long as it liked, unless the
enemy stole it away. Back then,
the history of the blade was, as
a 1947 Daily headline read,
"replete with raids, blood, tri
umph, dull despair."
The yell
But before that, before there
was ever an Axe, there was an
Axe yell.
By the mid-1890s, shortly after

the opening of Stanford, the nat
ural geographic rivalry between
the nascent school in Palo Alto
and its more established cross-
Bay neighbor had begun to heat
up.
The Axe yell, growing out of
this budding rivalry, came from
somewhere in the imagination of
Will Irwin and Chris Bradley,
Stanford Class of '98. Just why
the two chose an axe as Stanford's
figurative instrument of spleen
venting is unclear. In his book
titled "The Stanford Axe," R.G.
O'Neil posited this theory:
"The axe was the most terrible
of weapons. Even as an instru
ment of domestic utility, we think
of the axe not as the great boon
to the pioneers of old who forced
back our frontiers . . . but rather
as the means for stopping the
squawks of excited chickens by
one clean blow which severed the
head and covered the ground with
spurting blood.

"And the stark-naked truth of
the matter is simply this: The axe
is the symbol which most ac
curately describes the subcon
scious feelings of those loyal to
Stanford and California" toward
the opposing school.
And Will Irwin, according to
O'Neil, "put his finger unerringly
on this feeling, and came through
with the famous yell," which goes
as follows:
Give 'em the Axe, the Axe, the Axe!
Give 'em the Axe, the Axe, the Axe!
Give 'em the Axe, give 'em the
Axe, give 'em the Axe!
Where?
Right in the neck, the neck, the
neck!
Right in the neck, the neck, the
neck!
Right in the neck, right in the
neck, right in the neck!
There!
The Axe yell was born in 1896,
but some observers, including Ar
chie Cloud in his book "The Stan
ford Axe," have noted that the
cadence of the yell imitates the
rhythm of the chorus in the At
henian comedy, "The Frogs,"
penned by Aristophanes some
2,000 years earlier.
Whether or not its creation was
the result of some Western culture
plagiarism, the Axe yell was ini
tially the sole possession of Stan
ford rooters (and probably a tad
tiresome to the Golden Bear faith
ful).
Baseball crisis
It was not until 1899 that
anyone had the idea of a real axe
to accompany the Axe yell. And

even then, it was only because the
Stanford baseball team was in a
crisis.
Facing Cal in April 1899 in a
best-of-three series to decide the
intercollegiate champion, the
Stanford nine dropped the first
contest.
Despairing Stanford backers
sensed that the team needed spe
cial inspiration before the second
contest. Yell-leader Billy Erb,
along with a few classmates, gath
ered $4.50 and purchased a rusty
broadaxe which had a 14-inch
blade and weighed over 10
pounds. He painted the blade red
and attached a makeshift 4-foot
long handle.
At the huge bonfire rally two
nights before the baseball game,
Erb brought out the Axe, made
a big display of sharpening it on
a grindstone and then dramati
cally chopped the head off a blue
and-gold-clad effigy.
The crowd responded wildly,
and two days later Erb appeared
at the ballgame (which was played
at old Recreation Park in down
town San Franciso), brandishing
the blade menacingly in the faces
of the Bear rooters and leading
the Stanfordites in the Axe yell.
Although the Axe and its atten
dant yell apparently irked Cal's
backers, it had litle effect on the
Bears team, which rolled to a 9-7
victory to wrap up the champion
ship.
The theft
The Stanford fans felt betrayed
by their new totem, and paid little
attention to the Axe's safety in
the aftermath of the disappointing
loss. It was entrusted to the

keeping of three Stanford men,
who barely were out the gate of
the park before they were jumped
by a mob of Bear bullies. The
Berkeleyites seized the Axe and
dashed away.
A wild chase through the streets
of the City ensued. The thiefs
paused in a butcher shop long
enough to cut off the Axe's han
dle, then made for the wharf,
where, concealing the head of the
Axe, they were able to sneak past
a gauntlet of San Francisco police
and Stanfordites, board a ferry
and ride to safety across the Bay.
Stanford students were out
raged by the theft. Raids between
the two schools became rampant.
So much ill will was generated in
the ensuing days that Stanford
President David Starr Jordan had
to issue a formal public admoni
tion to the Stanford student body,
saying, "Let no old axe cut off
our dignity and self-respect."
Eventually, both school's admin
istrations agreed that the Axe was
Cal's "by right of conquest" and
outlawed all further raids.
Still, recovery of the Axe re
mained an all-consuming passion
on the Farm, and plots to get it
back were soon being hatched.
The Axe in Berkeley
Meanwhile, the Cal faithful co
opted the Axe yell for their own
use, using it like salt in the
wounds of the Stanford faithful
at every opportunity. Each year
in April, Cal held a huge bonfire
and Axe rally in its Greek Theater.
The safekeeping of the weapon
was entrusted to the Axe Cus
todian, usually a member of the

Bear baseball team, who was
elected annually by vote of the
student body. When not out for
its single annual appearance at
the rally, the Axe was kept locked
up in a bank vault at the Amer
ican Trust Company in Berkeley.
For 31 years the Axe rested in
the hands of the Bears,
"estranged from the Farm, its
birthplace, and subjected to the
crazed gloatings of its malefac
tors," as the 1930 Quad said.
The Immortal 21
But in 1930 the Axe made a
sudden and glorious return to the
Farm.
A group of 21 Stanford under
graduates and recent graduates
(subsequently given the name,
"The Immortal 21") had been
plotting the recovery of the Axe
for several years. Their attempts
in 1928 and 1929 were foiled, but
in 1930 their scheme was flawless.
On the eve of Cal's rally, April
3, 1930, the 21, led by Don Kropp,
drove in three cars to Berkeley.
Several of them were dressed as
Cal freshmen, the others as
newspapermen.
As the rally came to a close,
four of the Stanfordites, incon
spicuously clad in blue and gold
and posing as protectors of the
Axe, managed to hop aboard the
armored car transporting the Axe
back to the bank. Meanwhile, the
others parked their cars outside
the bank and waited, poised with
fake cameras and a tear gas bomb
created in a chemistry lab back
at Stanford.
When the Axe, with its coterie
of guardians, arrived at the bank,
the bogus newsmen implored Axe
Custodian Norman Horner to
pose for a few photographs. They
then popped a bright flash in
Horner's eyes, blinding him mo
mentarily. The Stanfordites
nabbed the Axe and amidst the
tumult created by the exploding

tear gas bomb, passed it quickly
through the throng around the
bank, and whisked it into the
waiting getaway car.
Triumphant return
Fifty minutes later, the Axe was
back on the Farm. Stanford stu
dents were exultant, rising from
their slumbers for an impromptu
late-night celebration
News of the theft spread quick
ly, inspiring hyperbolic prose and
oratory on both sides of the Bay.
The Daily's banner headline the
next day screamed "AXE
REGAINED!" in 3V2 high letters.
The Daily Californian moaned
"AXE STOLEN" in letters just as
large.
"The Stanford Axe is Stanford's
once more," said The Daily in
reporting the event. "While the
Blue and Gold horde literally
slumbered on its feet last night,
a band of 21 intrepid wearers of
the Cardinal whisked the precious
implement from under the nose
of the Berkeleyans in whose pos
session it had rested since that
fatal day in 1899, and brought it
back to the Stanford campus."
At a campus-wide rally honor
ing the 21, Dan Evans, Class of
'20, spoke for the alumni, saying,
"During the last 31 years, there
hasn't been a Stanford man or
woman who hasn't dreamed of
this day."
The Axe itself, meanwhile, was
stored in Roble Hall its first night
on campus, then was moved to a
steel vault at the Palo Alto Amer
ican Trust Bank.
On the other side of the Bay,
a pall of gloom fell over the
Berkeley campus. Considerable
bitterness was directed toward the
Farm, manifested by several "hate
Stanford" editorials in The Daily
Cal.
Cal was quite quick to propose
a plan to make the Axe the official
trophy of the annual Big Game,
to be awarded automatically to
the winner every year.
Stanford did not receive this
proposal with overwhelming en
thusiasm.
"The Axe is not and never was
a trophy to be passed from hand
to hand," said a Stanford Daily
editorial. "It is a symbol of Stan
ford. ... It is not and never was
California's. ... If men and
women here on the Farm are in
clined to treat this matter serious
ly, they should propose that Cal
ifornia put up her Golden Bear
along with the Cardinal Axe as a
Big Game trophy. Would not that
be more equable, more reason
able?"
Nonetheless, in 1933 the stu
dent body presidents of the two
schools signed an agreement desig
nating the Axe as the official Big
Game trophy and arranging for
its orderly annual transfer to the
campus of the victor.
The Infamous Three
Since then, there have been nu
merous attempted thefts of the
Axe, meeting with varying
degrees of success.
The most colorful incident oc
curred in November 1973. Three

members of Stanford's Theta
Delta Chi fraternity (later dubbed
"The Infamous Three") cooked up
a ruse startlingly reminiscent of
the Immortal 21's daring deed 43
years earlier.
Impersonating California foot
ball Coach Mike White, one of the
Three called the general manager
of the Cal student union and
asked that the Axe be brought to
that week's meeting of the North
ern California Football Writers,
to be held at Ming's Restaurant
in Palo Alto.
When the Axe arrived outside
the restaurant, another of the
Three, clad in a Cal letterman's
jacket, persuaded the Axe's
keepers to let him hold the Axe
for a minute. As soon as he got
his hands on the precious trophy,
he bolted; a tussle ensued and a
carload of backup fraternity
brothers arrived just in time to
carry the Axe and its rescuers to
safety.
The Axe disappeared mysteri
ously for a few days, and was
eventually given back to Cal six
days later, just before the kickoff
of that year's Big Game. Stan
ford's victory in the game
diminished the significance of the
gutsy theft, but the Infamous
Three had lost none of their pluck.

"We thought we might steal the
Axe back from Stanford and give
it to Cal," one of them said in
the wake of the Stanford victory.
"That would be really classy."
Although the intensity of feeling
generated by the Axe has dimmed
somewhat during its 87-year life,
the shiny blade remains the sym
bol of a grand and long-lived
rivalry. Hear the timeless words
of the editor of the Stanford Il
lustrated Review as he reflected
on the 1930 capture of the Axe:
"There is a side to this affair
(the recovery of the Axe) that lifts
it out of the commonplace of col
lege rivalries. For 31 years we
have carried the determination to
regain the symbol of Stanford
spirit.
"Just a sharp piece of metal!
But it represents a unifying object
— a force that holds us together,
students and alumni, to pit com
bined brain and energy against a
friendly rival."

cadence of the yell imitates the
rhythm of the chorus in the At
henian comedy, "The Frogs,"
penned by Aristophanes some
2,000 years earlier.
Whether or not its creation was
the result of some Western culture
plagiarism, the Axe yell was ini
tially the sole possession of Stan
ford rooters (and probably a tad
tiresome to the Golden Bear faith
ful).
Baseball crisis
It was not until 1899 that
anyone had the idea of a real axe
to accompany the Axe yell. And

even then, it was only because the
Stanford baseball team was in a
crisis.
Facing Cal in April 1899 in a
best-of-three series to decide the
intercollegiate champion, the
Stanford nine dropped the first
contest.
Despairing Stanford backers
sensed that the team needed spe
cial inspiration before the second
contest. Yell-leader Billy Erb,
along with a few classmates, gath
ered $4.50 and purchased a rusty
broadaxe which had a 14-inch
blade and weighed over 10
pounds. He painted the blade red
and attached a makeshift 4-foot
long handle.
At the huge bonfire rally two
nights before the baseball game,
Erb brought out the Axe, made
a big display of sharpening it on
a grindstone and then dramati
cally chopped the head off a blue
and-gold-clad effigy.
The crowd responded wildly,
and two days later Erb appeared
at the ballgame (which was played
at old Recreation Park in down
town San Franciso), brandishing
the blade menacingly in the faces
of the Bear rooters and leading
the Stanfordites in the Axe yell.
Although the Axe and its atten
dant yell apparently irked Cal's
backers, it had litle effect on the
Bears team, which rolled to a 9-7
victory to wrap up the champion
ship.
The theft
The Stanford fans felt betrayed
by their new totem, and paid little
attention to the Axe's safety in
the aftermath of the disappointing
loss. It was entrusted to the

keeping of three Stanford men,
who barely were out the gate of
the park before they were jumped
by a mob of Bear bullies. The
Berkeleyites seized the Axe and
dashed away.
A wild chase through the streets
of the City ensued. The thiefs
paused in a butcher shop long
enough to cut off the Axe's han
dle, then made for the wharf,
where, concealing the head of the
Axe, they were able to sneak past
a gauntlet of San Francisco police
and Stanfordites, board a ferry
and ride to safety across the Bay.
Stanford students were out
raged by the theft. Raids between
the two schools became rampant.
So much ill will was generated in
the ensuing days that Stanford
President David Starr Jordan had
to issue a formal public admoni
tion to the Stanford student body,
saying, "Let no old axe cut off
our dignity and self-respect."
Eventually, both school's admin
istrations agreed that the Axe was
Cal's "by right of conquest" and
outlawed all further raids.
Still, recovery of the Axe re
mained an all-consuming passion
on the Farm, and plots to get it
back were soon being hatched.
The Axe in Berkeley
Meanwhile, the Cal faithful co
opted the Axe yell for their own
use, using it like salt in the
wounds of the Stanford faithful
at every opportunity. Each year
in April, Cal held a huge bonfire
and Axe rally in its Greek Theater.
The safekeeping of the weapon
was entrusted to the Axe Cus
todian, usually a member of the

Bear baseball team, who was
elected annually by vote of the
student body. When not out for
its single annual appearance at
the rally, the Axe was kept locked
up in a bank vault at the Amer
ican Trust Company in Berkeley.
For 31 years the Axe rested in
the hands of the Bears,
"estranged from the Farm, its
birthplace, and subjected to the
crazed gloatings of its malefac
tors," as the 1930 Quad said.
The Immortal 21
But in 1930 the Axe made a
sudden and glorious return to the
Farm.
A group of 21 Stanford under
graduates and recent graduates
(subsequently given the name,
"The Immortal 21") had been
plotting the recovery of the Axe
for several years. Their attempts
in 1928 and 1929 were foiled, but
in 1930 their scheme was flawless.
On the eve of Cal's rally, April
3, 1930, the 21, led by Don Kropp,
drove in three cars to Berkeley.
Several of them were dressed as
Cal freshmen, the others as
newspapermen.
As the rally came to a close,
four of the Stanfordites, incon
spicuously clad in blue and gold
and posing as protectors of the
Axe, managed to hop aboard the
armored car transporting the Axe
back to the bank. Meanwhile, the
others parked their cars outside
the bank and waited, poised with
fake cameras and a tear gas bomb
created in a chemistry lab back
at Stanford.
When the Axe, with its coterie
of guardians, arrived at the bank,
the bogus newsmen implored Axe
Custodian Norman Horner to
pose for a few photographs. They
then popped a bright flash in
Horner's eyes, blinding him mo
mentarily. The Stanfordites
nabbed the Axe and amidst the
tumult created by the exploding

tear gas bomb, passed it quickly
through the throng around the
bank, and whisked it into the
waiting getaway car.
Triumphant return
Fifty minutes later, the Axe was
back on the Farm. Stanford stu
dents were exultant, rising from
their slumbers for an impromptu
late-night celebration
News of the theft spread quick
ly, inspiring hyperbolic prose and
oratory on both sides of the Bay.
The Daily's banner headline the
next day screamed "AXE
REGAINED!" in 3V2 high letters.
The Daily Californian moaned
"AXE STOLEN" in letters just as
large.
"The Stanford Axe is Stanford's
once more," said The Daily in
reporting the event. "While the
Blue and Gold horde literally
slumbered on its feet last night,
a band of 21 intrepid wearers of
the Cardinal whisked the precious
implement from under the nose
of the Berkeleyans in whose pos
session it had rested since that
fatal day in 1899, and brought it
back to the Stanford campus."
At a campus-wide rally honor
ing the 21, Dan Evans, Class of
'20, spoke for the alumni, saying,
"During the last 31 years, there
hasn't been a Stanford man or
woman who hasn't dreamed of
this day."
The Axe itself, meanwhile, was
stored in Roble Hall its first night
on campus, then was moved to a
steel vault at the Palo Alto Amer
ican Trust Bank.
On the other side of the Bay,
a pall of gloom fell over the
Berkeley campus. Considerable
bitterness was directed toward the
Farm, manifested by several "hate
Stanford" editorials in The Daily
Cal.
Cal was quite quick to propose
a plan to make the Axe the official
trophy of the annual Big Game,
to be awarded automatically to
the winner every year.
Stanford did not receive this
proposal with overwhelming en
thusiasm.
"The Axe is not and never was
a trophy to be passed from hand
to hand," said a Stanford Daily
editorial. "It is a symbol of Stan
ford. ... It is not and never was
California's. ... If men and
women here on the Farm are in
clined to treat this matter serious
ly, they should propose that Cal
ifornia put up her Golden Bear
along with the Cardinal Axe as a
Big Game trophy. Would not that
be more equable, more reason
able?"
Nonetheless, in 1933 the stu
dent body presidents of the two
schools signed an agreement desig
nating the Axe as the official Big
Game trophy and arranging for
its orderly annual transfer to the
campus of the victor.
The Infamous Three
Since then, there have been nu
merous attempted thefts of the
Axe, meeting with varying
degrees of success.
The most colorful incident oc
curred in November 1973. Three

members of Stanford's Theta
Delta Chi fraternity (later dubbed
"The Infamous Three") cooked up
a ruse startlingly reminiscent of
the Immortal 21's daring deed 43
years earlier.
Impersonating California foot
ball Coach Mike White, one of the
Three called the general manager
of the Cal student union and
asked that the Axe be brought to
that week's meeting of the North
ern California Football Writers,
to be held at Ming's Restaurant
in Palo Alto.
When the Axe arrived outside
the restaurant, another of the
Three, clad in a Cal letterman's
jacket, persuaded the Axe's
keepers to let him hold the Axe
for a minute. As soon as he got
his hands on the precious trophy,
he bolted; a tussle ensued and a
carload of backup fraternity
brothers arrived just in time to
carry the Axe and its rescuers to
safety.
The Axe disappeared mysteri
ously for a few days, and was
eventually given back to Cal six
days later, just before the kickoff
of that year's Big Game. Stan
ford's victory in the game
diminished the significance of the
gutsy theft, but the Infamous
Three had lost none of their pluck.

"We thought we might steal the
Axe back from Stanford and give
it to Cal," one of them said in
the wake of the Stanford victory.
"That would be really classy."
Although the intensity of feeling
generated by the Axe has dimmed
somewhat during its 87-year life,
the shiny blade remains the sym
bol of a grand and long-lived
rivalry. Hear the timeless words
of the editor of the Stanford Il
lustrated Review as he reflected
on the 1930 capture of the Axe:
"There is a side to this affair
(the recovery of the Axe) that lifts
it out of the commonplace of col
lege rivalries. For 31 years we
have carried the determination to
regain the symbol of Stanford
spirit.
"Just a sharp piece of metal!
But it represents a unifying object
— a force that holds us together,
students and alumni, to pit com
bined brain and energy against a
friendly rival."

Chris Myers graduated from
Stanford in 1988.
A sharp piece of metal suitable
for cutting wood, rendered virtu
ally useless by its lack of a handle.
An object of jealousy, thievery,
competition, bloodlust. A symbol
of one of the longest-standing and
richest rivalries in collegiate ath
letics. The spoils of Big Game.
The Axe.
Now it is mounted neatly on
polished mahogony, its 14-inch
blade shined and clean. Below it
is a plaque bearing the scores of
past Big Games. Its heading
reads, "The Stanford Axe —
Forged March 1899. Captured by
California April 15, 1899. Recap
tured by Stanford April 3, 1930.
To be awarded annually to the
winner of the Big Game."
It is a simple inscription; it
belies the coveted weapon's
tumultuous past. The sharp edge
of passion surrounding the Axe
seems to have been dulled in
recent years, perhaps because its
transfer from school to school is
so orderly now, with the trophy
tidily turning over to, or being
retained by, the Big Game winner.
But in days of old, the Axe was
more of a mascot than a trophy,
and its owner could hold on to it
as long as it liked, unless the
enemy stole it away. Back then,
the history of the blade was, as
a 1947 Daily headline read,
"replete with raids, blood, tri
umph, dull despair."
The yell
But before that, before there
was ever an Axe, there was an
Axe yell.
By the mid-1890s, shortly after

the opening of Stanford, the nat
ural geographic rivalry between
the nascent school in Palo Alto
and its more established cross-
Bay neighbor had begun to heat
up.
The Axe yell, growing out of
this budding rivalry, came from
somewhere in the imagination of
Will Irwin and Chris Bradley,
Stanford Class of '98. Just why
the two chose an axe as Stanford's
figurative instrument of spleen
venting is unclear. In his book
titled "The Stanford Axe," R.G.
O'Neil posited this theory:
"The axe was the most terrible
of weapons. Even as an instru
ment of domestic utility, we think
of the axe not as the great boon
to the pioneers of old who forced
back our frontiers . . . but rather
as the means for stopping the
squawks of excited chickens by
one clean blow which severed the
head and covered the ground with
spurting blood.

"And the stark-naked truth of
the matter is simply this: The axe
is the symbol which most ac
curately describes the subcon
scious feelings of those loyal to
Stanford and California" toward
the opposing school.
And Will Irwin, according to
O'Neil, "put his finger unerringly
on this feeling, and came through
with the famous yell," which goes
as follows:
Give 'em the Axe, the Axe, the Axe!
Give 'em the Axe, the Axe, the Axe!
Give 'em the Axe, give 'em the
Axe, give 'em the Axe!
Where?
Right in the neck, the neck, the
neck!
Right in the neck, the neck, the
neck!
Right in the neck, right in the
neck, right in the neck!
There!
The Axe yell was born in 1896,
but some observers, including Ar
chie Cloud in his book "The Stan
ford Axe," have noted that the
cadence of the yell imitates the
rhythm of the chorus in the At
henian comedy, "The Frogs,"

and Axe rally in its Greek Theater.
The safekeeping of the weapon
was entrusted to the Axe Cus
todian, usually a member of the

Bear baseball team, who was
elected annually by vote of the
student body. When not out for
its single annual appearance at
the rally, the Axe was kept locked
up in a bank vault at the Amer
ican Trust Company in Berkeley.
For 31 years the Axe rested in
the hands of the Bears,
"estranged from the Farm, its
birthplace, and subjected to the
crazed gloatings of its malefac
tors," as the 1930 Quad said.
The Immortal 21
But in 1930 the Axe made a
sudden and glorious return to the
Farm.
A group of 21 Stanford under
graduates and recent graduates
(subsequently given the name,
"The Immortal 21") had been
plotting the recovery of the Axe
for several years. Their attempts
in 1928 and 1929 were foiled, but
in 1930 their scheme was flawless.
On the eve of Cal's rally, April
3, 1930, the 21, led by Don Kropp,
drove in three cars to Berkeley.
Several of them were dressed as
Cal freshmen, the others as
newspapermen.
As the rally came to a close,
four of the Stanfordites, incon
spicuously clad in blue and gold
and posing as protectors of the
Axe, managed to hop aboard the
armored car transporting the Axe
back to the bank. Meanwhile, the
others parked their cars outside
the bank and waited, poised with
fake cameras and a tear gas bomb
created in a chemistry lab back
at Stanford.
When the Axe, with its coterie
of guardians, arrived at the bank,
the bogus newsmen implored Axe
Custodian Norman Horner to
pose for a few photographs. They
then popped a bright flash in
Horner's eyes, blinding him mo
mentarily. The Stanfordites
nabbed the Axe and amidst the
tumult created by the exploding

tear gas bomb, passed it quickly
through the throng around the
bank, and whisked it into the
waiting getaway car.
Triumphant return
Fifty minutes later, the Axe was
back on the Farm. Stanford stu
dents were exultant, rising from
their slumbers for an impromptu
late-night celebration
News of the theft spread quick
ly, inspiring hyperbolic prose and
oratory on both sides of the Bay.
The Daily's banner headline the
next day screamed "AXE
REGAINED!" in 3V2 high letters.
The Daily Californian moaned
"AXE STOLEN" in letters just as
large.
"The Stanford Axe is Stanford's
once more," said The Daily in
reporting the event. "While the
Blue and Gold horde literally
slumbered on its feet last night,
a band of 21 intrepid wearers of
the Cardinal whisked the precious
implement from under the nose
of the Berkeleyans in whose pos
session it had rested since that
fatal day in 1899, and brought it
back to the Stanford campus."
At a campus-wide rally honor
ing the 21, Dan Evans, Class of
'20, spoke for the alumni, saying,
"During the last 31 years, there
hasn't been a Stanford man or
woman who hasn't dreamed of
this day."
The Axe itself, meanwhile, was
stored in Roble Hall its first night
on campus, then was moved to a
steel vault at the Palo Alto Amer
ican Trust Bank.
On the other side of the Bay,
a pall of gloom fell over the
Berkeley campus. Considerable
bitterness was directed toward the
Farm, manifested by several "hate
Stanford" editorials in The Daily
Cal.
Cal was quite quick to propose
a plan to make the Axe the official
trophy of the annual Big Game,
to be awarded automatically to
the winner every year.
Stanford did not receive this
proposal with overwhelming en
thusiasm.
"The Axe is not and never was
a trophy to be passed from hand
to hand," said a Stanford Daily
editorial. "It is a symbol of Stan
ford. ... It is not and never was
California's. ... If men and
women here on the Farm are in
clined to treat this matter serious
ly, they should propose that Cal
ifornia put up her Golden Bear
along with the Cardinal Axe as a
Big Game trophy. Would not that
be more equable, more reason
able?"
Nonetheless, in 1933 the stu
dent body presidents of the two
schools signed an agreement desig
nating the Axe as the official Big
Game trophy and arranging for
its orderly annual transfer to the
campus of the victor.
The Infamous Three
Since then, there have been nu
merous attempted thefts of the
Axe, meeting with varying
degrees of success.
The most colorful incident oc
curred in November 1973. Three

members of Stanford's Theta
Delta Chi fraternity (later dubbed
"The Infamous Three") cooked up
a ruse startlingly reminiscent of
the Immortal 21's daring deed 43
years earlier.
Impersonating California foot
ball Coach Mike White, one of the
Three called the general manager
of the Cal student union and
asked that the Axe be brought to
that week's meeting of the North
ern California Football Writers,
to be held at Ming's Restaurant
in Palo Alto.
When the Axe arrived outside
the restaurant, another of the
Three, clad in a Cal letterman's
jacket, persuaded the Axe's
keepers to let him hold the Axe
for a minute. As soon as he got
his hands on the precious trophy,
he bolted; a tussle ensued and a
carload of backup fraternity
brothers arrived just in time to
carry the Axe and its rescuers to
safety.
The Axe disappeared mysteri
ously for a few days, and was
eventually given back to Cal six
days later, just before the kickoff
of that year's Big Game. Stan
ford's victory in the game
diminished the significance of the
gutsy theft, but the Infamous
Three had lost none of their pluck.

"We thought we might steal the
Axe back from Stanford and give
it to Cal," one of them said in
the wake of the Stanford victory.
"That would be really classy."
Although the intensity of feeling
generated by the Axe has dimmed
somewhat during its 87-year life,
the shiny blade remains the sym
bol of a grand and long-lived
rivalry. Hear the timeless words
of the editor of the Stanford Il
lustrated Review as he reflected
on the 1930 capture of the Axe:
"There is a side to this affair
(the recovery of the Axe) that lifts
it out of the commonplace of col
lege rivalries. For 31 years we
have carried the determination to
regain the symbol of Stanford
spirit.
"Just a sharp piece of metal!
But it represents a unifying object
— a force that holds us together,
students and alumni, to pit com
bined brain and energy against a
friendly rival."

Chris Myers graduated from
Stanford in 1988.
A sharp piece of metal suitable
for cutting wood, rendered virtu
ally useless by its lack of a handle.
An object of jealousy, thievery,
competition, bloodlust. A symbol
of one of the longest-standing and
richest rivalries in collegiate ath
letics. The spoils of Big Game.
The Axe.
Now it is mounted neatly on
polished mahogony, its 14-inch
blade shined and clean. Below it
is a plaque bearing the scores of
past Big Games. Its heading
reads, "The Stanford Axe —
Forged March 1899. Captured by
California April 15, 1899. Recap
tured by Stanford April 3, 1930.
To be awarded annually to the
winner of the Big Game."
It is a simple inscription; it
belies the coveted weapon's
tumultuous past. The sharp edge
of passion surrounding the Axe
seems to have been dulled in
recent years, perhaps because its
transfer from school to school is
so orderly now, with the trophy
tidily turning over to, or being
retained by, the Big Game winner.
But in days of old, the Axe was
more of a mascot than a trophy,
and its owner could hold on to it
as long as it liked, unless the
enemy stole it away. Back then,
the history of the blade was, as
a 1947 Daily headline read,
"replete with raids, blood, tri
umph, dull despair."
The yell
But before that, before there
was ever an Axe, there was an
Axe yell.
By the mid-1890s, shortly after

the opening of Stanford, the nat
ural geographic rivalry between
the nascent school in Palo Alto
and its more established cross-
Bay neighbor had begun to heat
up.
The Axe yell, growing out of
this budding rivalry, came from
somewhere in the imagination of
Will Irwin and Chris Bradley,
Stanford Class of '98. Just why
the two chose an axe as Stanford's
figurative instrument of spleen
venting is unclear. In his book
titled "The Stanford Axe," R.G.
O'Neil posited this theory:
"The axe was the most terrible
of weapons. Even as an instru
ment of domestic utility, we think
of the axe not as the great boon
to the pioneers of old who forced
back our frontiers . . . but rather
as the means for stopping the
squawks of excited chickens by
one clean blow which severed the
head and covered the ground with
spurting blood.

"And the stark-naked truth of
the matter is simply this: The axe
is the symbol which most ac
curately describes the subcon
scious feelings of those loyal to
Stanford and California" toward
the opposing school.
And Will Irwin, according to
O'Neil, "put his finger unerringly
on this feeling, and came through
with the famous yell," which goes
as follows:
Give 'em the Axe, the Axe, the Axe!
Give 'em the Axe, the Axe, the Axe!
Give 'em the Axe, give 'em the
Axe, give 'em the Axe!
Where?
Right in the neck, the neck, the
neck!
Right in the neck, the neck, the
neck!
Right in the neck, right in the
neck, right in the neck!
There!
The Axe yell was born in 1896,
but some observers, including Ar
chie Cloud in his book "The Stan
ford Axe," have noted that the
cadence of the yell imitates the
rhythm of the chorus in the At
henian comedy, "The Frogs,"
penned by Aristophanes some
2,000 years earlier.
Whether or not its creation was
the result of some Western culture
plagiarism, the Axe yell was ini
tially the sole possession of Stan
ford rooters (and probably a tad
tiresome to the Golden Bear faith
ful).
Baseball crisis
It was not until 1899 that
anyone had the idea of a real axe
to accompany the Axe yell. And

even then, it was only because the
Stanford baseball team was in a
crisis.
Facing Cal in April 1899 in a
best-of-three series to decide the
intercollegiate champion, the
Stanford nine dropped the first
contest.
Despairing Stanford backers
sensed that the team needed spe
cial inspiration before the second
contest. Yell-leader Billy Erb,
along with a few classmates, gath
ered $4.50 and purchased a rusty
broadaxe which had a 14-inch
blade and weighed over 10
pounds. He painted the blade red
and attached a makeshift 4-foot
long handle.
At the huge bonfire rally two
nights before the baseball game,
Erb brought out the Axe, made
a big display of sharpening it on
a grindstone and then dramati
cally chopped the head off a blue
and-gold-clad effigy.
The crowd responded wildly,
and two days later Erb appeared
at the ballgame (which was played
at old Recreation Park in down
town San Franciso), brandishing
the blade menacingly in the faces
of the Bear rooters and leading
the Stanfordites in the Axe yell.
Although the Axe and its atten
dant yell apparently irked Cal's
backers, it had litle effect on the
Bears team, which rolled to a 9-7
victory to wrap up the champion
ship.
The theft
The Stanford fans felt betrayed
by their new totem, and paid little
attention to the Axe's safety in
the aftermath of the disappointing
loss. It was entrusted to the

keeping of three Stanford men,
who barely were out the gate of
the park before they were jumped
by a mob of Bear bullies. The
Berkeleyites seized the Axe and
dashed away.
A wild chase through the streets
of the City ensued. The thiefs
paused in a butcher shop long
enough to cut off the Axe's han
dle, then made for the wharf,
where, concealing the head of the
Axe, they were able to sneak past
a gauntlet of San Francisco police
and Stanfordites, board a ferry
and ride to safety across the Bay.
Stanford students were out
raged by the theft. Raids between
the two schools became rampant.
So much ill will was generated in
the ensuing days that Stanford
President David Starr Jordan had
to issue a formal public admoni
tion to the Stanford student body,
saying, "Let no old axe cut off
our dignity and self-respect."
Eventually, both school's admin
istrations agreed that the Axe was
Cal's "by right of conquest" and
outlawed all further raids.
Still, recovery of the Axe re
mained an all-consuming passion
on the Farm, and plots to get it
back were soon being hatched.
The Axe in Berkeley
Meanwhile, the Cal faithful co
opted the Axe yell for their own
use, using it like salt in the
wounds of the Stanford faithful
at every opportunity. Each year
in April, Cal held a huge bonfire
and Axe rally in its Greek Theater.
The safekeeping of the weapon
was entrusted to the Axe Cus
todian, usually a member of the

Bear baseball team, who was
elected annually by vote of the

steel vault at the Palo Alto Amer
ican Trust Bank.
On the other side of the Bay,
a pall of gloom fell over the
Berkeley campus. Considerable
bitterness was directed toward the
Farm, manifested by several "hate
Stanford" editorials in The Daily
Cal.
Cal was quite quick to propose
a plan to make the Axe the official
trophy of the annual Big Game,
to be awarded automatically to
the winner every year.
Stanford did not receive this
proposal with overwhelming en
thusiasm.
"The Axe is not and never was
a trophy to be passed from hand
to hand," said a Stanford Daily
editorial. "It is a symbol of Stan
ford. ... It is not and never was
California's. ... If men and
women here on the Farm are in
clined to treat this matter serious
ly, they should propose that Cal
ifornia put up her Golden Bear
along with the Cardinal Axe as a
Big Game trophy. Would not that
be more equable, more reason
able?"
Nonetheless, in 1933 the stu
dent body presidents of the two
schools signed an agreement desig
nating the Axe as the official Big
Game trophy and arranging for
its orderly annual transfer to the
campus of the victor.
The Infamous Three
Since then, there have been nu
merous attempted thefts of the
Axe, meeting with varying
degrees of success.
The most colorful incident oc
curred in November 1973. Three

members of Stanford's Theta
Delta Chi fraternity (later dubbed
"The Infamous Three") cooked up
a ruse startlingly reminiscent of
the Immortal 21's daring deed 43
years earlier.
Impersonating California foot
ball Coach Mike White, one of the
Three called the general manager
of the Cal student union and
asked that the Axe be brought to
that week's meeting of the North
ern California Football Writers,
to be held at Ming's Restaurant
in Palo Alto.
When the Axe arrived outside
the restaurant, another of the
Three, clad in a Cal letterman's
jacket, persuaded the Axe's
keepers to let him hold the Axe
for a minute. As soon as he got
his hands on the precious trophy,
he bolted; a tussle ensued and a
carload of backup fraternity
brothers arrived just in time to
carry the Axe and its rescuers to
safety.
The Axe disappeared mysteri
ously for a few days, and was
eventually given back to Cal six
days later, just before the kickoff
of that year's Big Game. Stan
ford's victory in the game
diminished the significance of the
gutsy theft, but the Infamous
Three had lost none of their pluck.

"We thought we might steal the
Axe back from Stanford and give
it to Cal," one of them said in
the wake of the Stanford victory.
"That would be really classy."
Although the intensity of feeling
generated by the Axe has dimmed
somewhat during its 87-year life,
the shiny blade remains the sym
bol of a grand and long-lived
rivalry. Hear the timeless words
of the editor of the Stanford Il
lustrated Review as he reflected
on the 1930 capture of the Axe:
"There is a side to this affair
(the recovery of the Axe) that lifts
it out of the commonplace of col
lege rivalries. For 31 years we
have carried the determination to
regain the symbol of Stanford
spirit.
"Just a sharp piece of metal!
But it represents a unifying object
— a force that holds us together,
students and alumni, to pit com
bined brain and energy against a
friendly rival."

Chris Myers graduated from
Stanford in 1988.
A sharp piece of metal suitable
for cutting wood, rendered virtu
ally useless by its lack of a handle.
An object of jealousy, thievery,
competition, bloodlust. A symbol
of one of the longest-standing and
richest rivalries in collegiate ath
letics. The spoils of Big Game.
The Axe.
Now it is mounted neatly on
polished mahogony, its 14-inch
blade shined and clean. Below it
is a plaque bearing the scores of
past Big Games. Its heading
reads, "The Stanford Axe —
Forged March 1899. Captured by
California April 15, 1899. Recap
tured by Stanford April 3, 1930.
To be awarded annually to the
winner of the Big Game."
It is a simple inscription; it
belies the coveted weapon's
tumultuous past. The sharp edge
of passion surrounding the Axe
seems to have been dulled in
recent years, perhaps because its
transfer from school to school is
so orderly now, with the trophy
tidily turning over to, or being
retained by, the Big Game winner.
But in days of old, the Axe was
more of a mascot than a trophy,
and its owner could hold on to it
as long as it liked, unless the
enemy stole it away. Back then,
the history of the blade was, as
a 1947 Daily headline read,
"replete with raids, blood, tri
umph, dull despair."
The yell
But before that, before there
was ever an Axe, there was an
Axe yell.
By the mid-1890s, shortly after

the opening of Stanford, the nat
ural geographic rivalry between
the nascent school in Palo Alto
and its more established cross-
Bay neighbor had begun to heat
up.
The Axe yell, growing out of
this budding rivalry, came from
somewhere in the imagination of
Will Irwin and Chris Bradley,
Stanford Class of '98. Just why
the two chose an axe as Stanford's
figurative instrument of spleen
venting is unclear. In his book
titled "The Stanford Axe," R.G.
O'Neil posited this theory:
"The axe was the most terrible
of weapons. Even as an instru
ment of domestic utility, we think
of the axe not as the great boon
to the pioneers of old who forced
back our frontiers . . . but rather
as the means for stopping the
squawks of excited chickens by
one clean blow which severed the
head and covered the ground with
spurting blood.

"And the stark-naked truth of
the matter is simply this: The axe
is the symbol which most ac
curately describes the subcon
scious feelings of those loyal to
Stanford and California" toward
the opposing school.
And Will Irwin, according to
O'Neil, "put his finger unerringly
on this feeling, and came through
with the famous yell," which goes
as follows:
Give 'em the Axe, the Axe, the Axe!
Give 'em the Axe, the Axe, the Axe!
Give 'em the Axe, give 'em the
Axe, give 'em the Axe!
Where?
Right in the neck, the neck, the
neck!
Right in the neck, the neck, the
neck!
Right in the neck, right in the
neck, right in the neck!
There!
The Axe yell was born in 1896,
but some observers, including Ar
chie Cloud in his book "The Stan
ford Axe," have noted that the
cadence of the yell imitates the
rhythm of the chorus in the At
henian comedy, "The Frogs,"
penned by Aristophanes some
2,000 years earlier.
Whether or not its creation was
the result of some Western culture
plagiarism, the Axe yell was ini
tially the sole possession of Stan
ford rooters (and probably a tad
tiresome to the Golden Bear faith
ful).
Baseball crisis
It was not until 1899 that
anyone had the idea of a real axe
to accompany the Axe yell. And

even then, it was only because the
Stanford baseball team was in a
crisis.
Facing Cal in April 1899 in a
best-of-three series to decide the
intercollegiate champion, the
Stanford nine dropped the first
contest.
Despairing Stanford backers
sensed that the team needed spe
cial inspiration before the second
contest. Yell-leader Billy Erb,
along with a few classmates, gath
ered $4.50 and purchased a rusty
broadaxe which had a 14-inch
blade and weighed over 10
pounds. He painted the blade red
and attached a makeshift 4-foot
long handle.
At the huge bonfire rally two
nights before the baseball game,
Erb brought out the Axe, made
a big display of sharpening it on
a grindstone and then dramati
cally chopped the head off a blue
and-gold-clad effigy.
The crowd responded wildly,
and two days later Erb appeared
at the ballgame (which was played
at old Recreation Park in down
town San Franciso), brandishing
the blade menacingly in the faces
of the Bear rooters and leading
the Stanfordites in the Axe yell.
Although the Axe and its atten
dant yell apparently irked Cal's
backers, it had litle effect on the
Bears team, which rolled to a 9-7
victory to wrap up the champion
ship.
The theft
The Stanford fans felt betrayed
by their new totem, and paid little
attention to the Axe's safety in
the aftermath of the disappointing
loss. It was entrusted to the

keeping of three Stanford men,
who barely were out the gate of
the park before they were jumped
by a mob of Bear bullies. The
Berkeleyites seized the Axe and
dashed away.
A wild chase through the streets
of the City ensued. The thiefs
paused in a butcher shop long
enough to cut off the Axe's han
dle, then made for the wharf,
where, concealing the head of the
Axe, they were able to sneak past
a gauntlet of San Francisco police
and Stanfordites, board a ferry
and ride to safety across the Bay.
Stanford students were out
raged by the theft. Raids between
the two schools became rampant.
So much ill will was generated in
the ensuing days that Stanford
President David Starr Jordan had
to issue a formal public admoni
tion to the Stanford student body,
saying, "Let no old axe cut off
our dignity and self-respect."
Eventually, both school's admin
istrations agreed that the Axe was
Cal's "by right of conquest" and
outlawed all further raids.
Still, recovery of the Axe re
mained an all-consuming passion
on the Farm, and plots to get it
back were soon being hatched.
The Axe in Berkeley
Meanwhile, the Cal faithful co
opted the Axe yell for their own
use, using it like salt in the
wounds of the Stanford faithful
at every opportunity. Each year
in April, Cal held a huge bonfire
and Axe rally in its Greek Theater.
The safekeeping of the weapon
was entrusted to the Axe Cus
todian, usually a member of the

Bear baseball team, who was
elected annually by vote of the
student body. When not out for
its single annual appearance at
the rally, the Axe was kept locked
up in a bank vault at the Amer
ican Trust Company in Berkeley.
For 31 years the Axe rested in
the hands of the Bears,
"estranged from the Farm, its
birthplace, and subjected to the
crazed gloatings of its malefac
tors," as the 1930 Quad said.
The Immortal 21
But in 1930 the Axe made a
sudden and glorious return to the
Farm.
A group of 21 Stanford under
graduates and recent graduates
(subsequently given the name,
"The Immortal 21") had been
plotting the recovery of the Axe
for several years. Their attempts
in 1928 and 1929 were foiled, but
in 1930 their scheme was flawless.
On the eve of Cal's rally, April
3, 1930, the 21, led by Don Kropp,
drove in three cars to Berkeley.
Several of them were dressed as
Cal freshmen, the others as
newspapermen.
As the rally came to a close,
four of the Stanfordites, incon
spicuously clad in blue and gold
and posing as protectors of the
Axe, managed to hop aboard the
armored car transporting the Axe
back to the bank. Meanwhile, the
others parked their cars outside
the bank and waited, poised with
fake cameras and a tear gas bomb
created in a chemistry lab back
at Stanford.
When the Axe, with its coterie
of guardians, arrived at the bank,
the bogus newsmen implored Axe
Custodian Norman Horner to
pose for a few photographs. They
then popped a bright flash in
Horner's eyes, blinding him mo
mentarily. The Stanfordites
nabbed the Axe and amidst the
tumult created by the exploding

tear gas bomb, passed it quickly
through the throng around the
bank, and whisked it into the
waiting getaway car.
Triumphant return
Fifty minutes later, the Axe was
back on the Farm. Stanford stu
dents were exultant, rising from
their slumbers for an impromptu
late-night celebration
News of the theft spread quick
ly, inspiring hyperbolic prose and
oratory on both sides of the Bay.
The Daily's banner headline the
next day screamed "AXE
REGAINED!" in 3V2 high letters.
The Daily Californian moaned
"AXE STOLEN" in letters just as
large.
"The Stanford Axe is Stanford's
once more," said The Daily in
reporting the event. "While the
Blue and Gold horde literally
slumbered on its feet last night,
a band of 21 intrepid wearers of
the Cardinal whisked the precious
implement from under the nose
of the Berkeleyans in whose pos
session it had rested since that
fatal day in 1899, and brought it
back to the Stanford campus."
At a campus-wide rally honor
ing the 21, Dan Evans, Class of
'20, spoke for the alumni, saying,
"During the last 31 years, there
hasn't been a Stanford man or
woman who hasn't dreamed of
this day."
The Axe itself, meanwhile, was
stored in Roble Hall its first night
on campus, then was moved to a
steel vault at the Palo Alto Amer
ican Trust Bank.
On the other side of the Bay,
a pall of gloom fell over the
Berkeley campus. Considerable
