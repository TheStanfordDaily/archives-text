# Cardinal escapes with 19-19 Big Game tie
## Le 						blocks field goal as time expires 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
There couldn't be a more fitting ending.
The Cardinal football team, which never
gave up this season even after six
heartbreaking games, recorded a blocked
field goal on the last play of the season to
salvage a 19-19 tie with California in Big
Game.
Stanford finished the season 3-6-2 over
all, 1-5-2 and in ninth place in the Pacific
10 Conference. The Golden Bears end the
year 5-5-1, 1-5-1 and 10th in the Pac-10.
Cal's mark ended a streak of four consecu
tive losing seasons for the Bears.
"They're an outstanding group of young
men — that's a fact," Stanford Coach Jack
Elway said of his players. "Everyone played
hard throughout a difficult schedule."
There was almost no hope remaining for
the Cardinal when Cal got the ball on the
Stanford 29 with three minutes, 39 seconds
to play. Stanford quarterback Jason
Palumbis was trying to drive the Cardinal
to the winning score when his arm was
hit while he was throwing. The ball floated
through the air and was rebounded by
inside linebacker David Ortega to set up
the Bears.
Quarterback Troy Taylor and fullback
Todd Powers drove Cal to the Cardinal
three and the Bears set up for a field goal
on third down with four seconds remaining.
Robbie Keen, 21-for-24 in field goal at
tempts this season, came in to kick the
game-winner, but redshirt freshman Tuan
Van Le raced untouched around the left
end and got both hands on the ball, which
then bounced through the end zone.
"It was just an all-out," Le said. "It was
weird. Before the field goal I had this
feeling I was going to get a jump. I took
a chance.
"So many times I've come so close to

blocking 0ne.... The coaches told me to
keep trying It just felt good that they
didn't win."
The game started well for Cal when
Powers ran for 32 yards on the first play
from scrimmage and Taylor's passing and
Chris Richards' running brought the ball
to the Cardinal seven.
A sack by Lester Archambeau and good
defense forced the Bears to settle for a
Keen field goal, however, his first of four
on the day.
Stanford responded by driving into Bear
territory but the Bear defense forced Stan
ford to bring in its field goal kicker, John
Hopkins, for a 44-yarder, also his first of
four.
After the Cardinal defense held the Bears
to two yards on three plays, Stanford got
the ball on its 39. After getting a first
down, a clipping penalty gave the Cardinal
first and 24 and an incomplete pass and
two-yard Scott Eschelman run (a handoff
to the fullback on second and 24?) made
it third and 22.
But Palumbis found slotback Chris
Walsh for a first down at the Cal 34. A
third-down touchdown pass thrown to
Walsh on a post pattern was nullified by
offsetting penalties, however, forcing the
Cardinal to settle for a 46-yard field goal.
Keen then added two more field goals,
but with the score 9-6 Cal, Stanford return
specialist Kevin Scott took the kickoff 95
yards for a touchdown, Stanford's first
kickoff return for a touchdown since 1986.
"It was a middle return," Scott said.
"The wedge took off toward the middle.
They kind of blocked everybody toward the
middle. I was able to break outside and it
was only the kicker. I hope I can beat the
kicker."

goal and the score was 13-12 Stanford at
the half.
The biggest reason for the plethora of
field goals was the ability of the Cardinal
defense to rise to the occasion in saving
touchdowns and the inability of the Stan
ford offense to move the ball. At halftime
the Bears had more than double the time
of possession and had held the Cardinal
to 17 net yards rushing. The good news
for Stanford was that the damage wasn't
as bad as last week when UCLA held Stan
ford to minus one yards rushing for the
game.
"They played pretty well against us,"
fullback Jon Volpe said of the Bears' de
fense. "They were doing a pretty good job.
Football
Cardinal 19, Bears 19
It didn't seem like I had too much room
[to run]."
The Cardinal opened the second half by
marching 71 yards for a field goal followed
by a flourish of punting by both teams.
The Cardinal got a break when Keen missed
a 46-yarder (he was previously 11-11 from
40-plus yards), and that coupled with a
50-yard punt from Hopkins and a 37-yard
Alan Grant return of a Keen punt gave
the Cardinal the ball at the Cal 43 with
13 minutes left.
A 22-yard Palumbis pass to Walter Bat
son moved the ball to the nine but two
running plays and a muffed quarterback
draw forced Stanford to settle for yet an
other 3-pointer. Hopkins' fourth kick tied
a school record he had tied previously this
season for most field goals in a game.
Taylor scrambled for 18 yards on the
first play of the next drive, then hit Vince
Delgado for 11 more. On the next play
Taylor's pass was intercepted by strong
safety Rob Englehardt, but a roughing-the
passer penalty nullified it and added insult
to injury by giving the Bears 15 yards.
Taylor scrambled for 17 more yards the
next play, then hit a wide-open Mike Ford
on a post pattern to tie the score with 9:08
left on the clock.

'Before the field goal I
had this feeling I was
going to get a jump. I
took a chance.'
— Tuan Van Le

Stanford and California were then both
stopped on three plays, and after the ex
change, Palumbis threw the freak inter
ception, the game's only turnover. The
Bears drove down and Le saved the day
for the Cardinal.
"That salvaged a loss," senior inside line
backer Kevin Richardson said. "I don't
know how happy you can be over a tie
though. I think we can be happy [with the
season]. I know we can be happy."
"I think we played pretty well. I know
we played hard. Big Game, big hearts."
Richardson summed up his final season
as, "frustrating in a way — win-loss column
— but damn rewarding in the way we all
hung in there top to bottom, from Coach
Elway to Ramon Chapa, the water boy."
Card notes
Volpe became only the third Stanford player
to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a season
as his 56 yards gave him 1,029. Volpe wasn't
too interested in reaching 1,000 Saturday, how
ever. "I'm not feeling it right now," he said.
"All I can think about is our record."
Thanks to the longest kickoff return of the
season and the longest punt return of the season,
Stanford totaled 209 yards in return yardage.
The Cardinal only mustered 208 yards of total
offense.
Hopkins broke the school record of 18 field
goals in a season by finishing with 19. Hopkins
was 19-of-24 for the season and finished with
12 straight.
Hopkins also had his best game of the season
punting, averaging 47.4 yards on five punts,
including a high 50-yarder under great pressure.
The eight field goals tied an NCAA record
set twice before. Nebraska and Missouri com
bined for that many 3-pointers Oct. 19, 1985
as did Western Michigan and Marshall Sept. 29,
1984. The 10 field-goal attempts set a new
NCAA mark.

in a game. Hopkins also broke the school record of 18 field goals in a season by finishing the year 19-for-24.
