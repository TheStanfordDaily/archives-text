There couldn't be a more fitting ending.
The Cardinal football team, which never
gave up this season even after six
heartbreaking games, recorded a blocked
field goal on the last play of the season to
salvage a 19-19 tie with California in Big
Game.
Stanford finished the season 3-6-2 over
all, 1-5-2 and in ninth place in the Pacific
10 Conference. The Golden Bears end the
year 5-5-1, 1-5-1 and 10th in the Pac-10.
Cal's mark ended a streak of four consecu
tive losing seasons for the Bears.
"They're an outstanding group of young
men — that's a fact," Stanford Coach Jack
Elway said of his players. "Everyone played
hard throughout a difficult schedule."
There was almost no hope remaining for
the Cardinal when Cal got the ball on the
Stanford 29 with three minutes, 39 seconds
to play. Stanford quarterback Jason
Palumbis was trying to drive the Cardinal
to the winning score when his arm was
hit while he was throwing. The ball floated
through the air and was rebounded by
inside linebacker David Ortega to set up
the Bears.
Quarterback Troy Taylor and fullback
Todd Powers drove Cal to the Cardinal
three and the Bears set up for a field goal
on third down with four seconds remaining.
Robbie Keen, 21-for-24 in field goal at
tempts this season, came in to kick the
game-winner, but redshirt freshman Tuan
Van Le raced untouched around the left
end and got both hands on the ball, which
then bounced through the end zone.
"It was just an all-out," Le said. "It was
weird. Before the field goal I had this
feeling I was going to get a jump. I took
a chance.
"So many times I've come so close to

blocking 0ne.... The coaches told me to
keep trying It just felt good that they
didn't win."
The game started well for Cal when
Powers ran for 32 yards on the first play
from scrimmage and Taylor's passing and
Chris Richards' running brought the ball
to the Cardinal seven.
A sack by Lester Archambeau and good
defense forced the Bears to settle for a
Keen field goal, however, his first of four
on the day.
Stanford responded by driving into Bear
territory but the Bear defense forced Stan
ford to bring in its field goal kicker, John
Hopkins, for a 44-yarder, also his first of
four.
After the Cardinal defense held the Bears
to two yards on three plays, Stanford got
the ball on its 39. After getting a first
down, a clipping penalty gave the Cardinal
first and 24 and an incomplete pass and
two-yard Scott Eschelman run (a handoff
to the fullback on second and 24?) made
it third and 22.
But Palumbis found slotback Chris
Walsh for a first down at the Cal 34. A
third-down touchdown pass thrown to
Walsh on a post pattern was nullified by
offsetting penalties, however, forcing the
Cardinal to settle for a 46-yard field goal.
Keen then added two more field goals,
but with the score 9-6 Cal, Stanford return
specialist Kevin Scott took the kickoff 95
yards for a touchdown, Stanford's first
kickoff return for a touchdown since 1986.
"It was a middle return," Scott said.
"The wedge took off toward the middle.
They kind of blocked everybody toward the
middle. I was able to break outside and it
was only the kicker. I hope I can beat the
kicker."
