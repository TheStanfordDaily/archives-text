## Canadians prepare for elections today 
### 
TORONTO (AP) — Supporters
and opponents of the U.S.-Canada
free trade agreement combined
last-minute electioneering yester
day with a final advertising blitz
on the eve of today's national elec
tions.
Prime Minister Brian Mul
roney, buoyed by recent polls that
showed his Progressive Conserva
tive Party back in the lead, toured
his native Quebec while his
leading rival, Liberal Party leader
John Turner, campaigned in Van
couver, British Columbia.
Both have focused on the trade
deal — the issue in today's
race.
Mulroney told a Saturday news
conference in Quebec that he
would call Parliament back into
session quickly to proceed with
final passage of the pact, which
Turner has vowed to reject.
In an interview with this week's
Maclean's magazine, Mulroney
was quoted as saying he would
try to pursue the trade agreement
even if his party can only form a
minority government.
"The trade deal is a must for
Canada's future," he was quoted
as saying. "It's a visionary instru
ment of job creation and new
wealth and it is clearly something
that is on the right side of his
tory."
But Turner has revived his
campaign by saying the pact
threatened to make Canada a U.S.
colony.

Speaking at a Saturday cam
paign rally, Turner repeated his
call to "keep Canada Canadian for
Canadians" and cancel the pact
with a vote for his party.
In this week's Maclean's,
Turner was quoted as saying the
pact "would radically change the
direction of our country. It yields
the economic levers of sover
eignty: our energy, our investment
policy, our capital markets,
supply-management of agricul
ture."
The socialist New Democratic
Party also opposes the agreement
that President Reagan and Mul
roney signed in January, so only
a megority Conservative govern
ment ensures that it will proceed
as scheduled.
The 10-year agreement would
start phasing out all remaining
tariffs between Canada and the
United States on Jan. 1. It has
passed the U.S. Congress but still
needs Canadian parliamentary ap
proval.
Mulroney spent the campaign's
last weekend in his native French
speaking Quebec, where he is
counting on support for the free
trade agreement to come through
with a solid showing for the prov
ince's 75 seats.
"We're on the road to Baie-
Comeau, and we're on the road
to victory," a confident-looking
Mulroney said at a rally yesterday
in Trois-Rivieres, Quebec. The
prime minister, the first bilingual

native of Quebec to lead his party,
was returning to his hometown
of Baie-Comeau for election day.
Turner was in Vancouver,
British Columbia, on the Pacific
coast, where he will vote in his
home district today. He reiterated
his call for Canadians to vote for
his party to halt the trade agree
ment.
election is still to be
won," he said.
Quebec and Ontario have the

majority of Canada's 26 million
people. The House of Commons
was newly expanded this year to
295 seats, so a party needs 148
seats to form a majority govern
ment.
The Conservatives are hoping
for a second successive majority,
which has not happened in
Canada since 1953. Mulroney led
his party to an overwhelming vic
tory four years ago, taking 210
of the then 282 seats in Commons.
