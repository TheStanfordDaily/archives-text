## U.N. asked to help build coalition Afghan government

NEW DELHI, India (AP) -
Soviet President Mikhail Gorba
chev and Indian Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi yesterday asked
the United Nations to help es
tablish a broad-based govern
ment in Afghanistan.
"A U.N.-supported interna
tional conference may be needed
for this purpose," said a joint
statement, released on the last
day of Gorbachev's three-day
visit. He arrived back in Moscow

last night.
The communique did not
reflect a change in the Kremlin's
position, but it coincides with
increasing Soviet efforts for a
political settlement of the war.
After nine years of Soviet mil
itary intervention, the war still
rages.
Under a U.N.-sponsored ac
cord signed in April, the Soviet
Union is to complete the with
drawal of its troops from Af

ghanistan by Feb. 15. About half
of an estimated 100,000 Soviet
soldiers have already left.
The statement on Afghani
stan said "the process of na
tional reconciliation should be
encouraged."
"National reconciliation" is
the term President Najib of Af
ghanistan has used in his efforts
to persuade Moslem guerrillas
to stop fighting and participate
in his government.
