MOSCOW (AP) - Estonian ac
tivists put undue pressure on
their legislators and resorted to
threats to win approval for a chal
lenge to the Kremlin's authority
over their Baltic republic, an Es
tonian lawmaker was quoted as
saying yesterday.
In an interview with the Com
munist Party daily, Vasily Kol
takov, an ethnic Russian and one
of seven deputies to vote against
the measure Wednesday,
portrayed the unprecedented ac
tion as excessive and dangerous
to ethnic relations.

The Estonian Supreme Soviet,
or parliament, approved an
amendment to the republic's con
stitution requiring that any new
Soviet laws be approved by local
authorities. They also passed a
"declaration of sovereignty" in all
areas except foreign affairs and
defense.
Koltakov, a factory worker, told
Pravda that "on the eve of the
session there was an overt 'coach
ing' of deputies."
Koltakov said the People's
Front, the Estonian organization
that sponsored the amendment,

advised him to "abstain from
voting when they learned about
my stand.
"Moreover, as one of the women
deputies told me, unidentified per
sons telephoned her on the eve of
the session and uttered threats
to make her cast an 'aye' vote."
Felix Undusk, a spokesman for
the People's Front, said the
Pravda interview was read in Es
tonian on the republic's official
radio yesterday.
"That's propaganda pressure,"
Undusk said in a telephone inter
view from Tallinn.
