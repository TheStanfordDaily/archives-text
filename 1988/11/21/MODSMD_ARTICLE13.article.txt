PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -
Thousands of ethnic Albanians
marched in a blizzard through
this provincial capital yesterday
in defiance of government orders
to end a wave of ethnic unrest
and street demonstrations.
The demonstrations in the
southern province of Kosovo are
the biggest there since World War
n.
Yesterday's protests, the fourth
straight day of unrest since the
forced resignation of two ethnic
Albanian leaders, started when
about 500 chanting students
braved the snow to march on the
headquarters of Kosovo's Com
munist Party.
Waving Yugoslav flags and eth
nic Albanian emblems, the crowd
swelled to about 4,000 within two
hours, roaming city streets and
gathering outside a student can
teen and party headquarters.
The crowd first ignored an or
der by security forces to disperse,
but the demonstrators later began
leaving the city center and it was
quiet by 8 p.m.
Up to 100,000 people marched
from dawn until midnight Satur
day to protest Thursday's resigna
tions of Azem Vlasi and Kacusa
Jasari, members of Kosovo's 13-
member ruling Politburo.
Police blocked roads into Pris
tina late Saturday to prevent more
protesters from joining the bois
terous crowds that demonstrated

almost continously since Vlasi and
Jasari resigned.
Snow fell through the night,
driving chanting columns of pro
testers off the streets, and in
creased police patrols appeared on
the streets yesterday.
The province's acting Commu
nist Party head, Remzi Koljgeci,
tried to defuse the tension by an
nouncing Saturday night that the
resignations might be reviewed
and reversed. But he also warned
that "extraordinary measures of
security" could be introduced if
demonstrations continued.
"In the past three days, we went
through a situation which we
could not control," he said in a
television interview yesterday
morning.
Slobodan Milosevic, the Com
munist Party chief of the republic
of Serbia, which controls Kosovo,
put what Vlasi called "terrific po
litical pressures" on him and
Jasari to resign as part of his
campaign for more control over
the autonomous province.
Kosovo, which is dominated by
an ethnic Albanian population, is
the heartland of Serbia's medieval
empire. The Slav minority, com
posed of 200,000 Serbs and Mon
tenegrins, alleges it is being
harassed by the 90 percent Al
banian population.
In his speech, Milosevic vowed
the Serbs would not stop until
their battle for Kosovo is won.
