## Not in good faith

Hiring Webb Ranch
workers takes jobs
away from the USW

According to its con
tract with the United Stan
ford Workers, the University
can hire non-union workers for
temporary projects, but should hire
union workers for permanent jobs.
But in spite of the concept of
good-faith agreements, as many as
15 non-union workers from Webb
Ranch, a private farm located on
University property, have been
hired by the University for gar
dening jobs â€” some of which ap
pear to be permanent.
An official from the Athletic De
partment, where the gardeners
work, and an official at Webb
Ranch have confirmed that at least
two of the employees work five
days a week, on a full-time basis,
and have held the same University
job for at least six months. The
Webb Ranch official said up to
seven workers come to campus
daily to work for the Athletic De
partment.
According to the contract, non
union workers must not be
employed in jobs "regularly and
customarily" performed by union
workers.
Gardening work at the Athletic
Department is work that should be

"regularly and customarily" done
by permanently employed gar
deners. If the University needs
more workers to help keep up the
grounds on a regular basis, then
permanent union workers need to
be given the jobs.
In 1985, the University seemed
to acknowledge that contracting
out labor to non-union workers for
full-time jobs violated a good-faith
agreement. After contract negotia
tions in 1985, the University
responded to charges that it was
hiring non-union workers for other
full-time jobs, according to Dept.
of Operations and Maintenance
manager Herb Fong.
The University stopped employ
ing full-time workers from outside
contractors and allowed those
workers who were already
employed to join the union.
While hiring non-union workers
in an emergency situation or for
specific short-term jobs is permis
sible, the Webb Ranch situation is
different. Six months is not "short
term" and gardening does not fall
into the category of "emergency"
or "specific."
In the Webb Ranch case, the Uni
versity is violating the spirit of the
contract and is demonstrating un
fair labor practices.
In light of the recent difficulty
in reaching a contract agreement,
the University should do every
thing in its power not to break it.
If the hiring of workers from Webb
Ranch threatens the contract, then
the practice should be stopped.
