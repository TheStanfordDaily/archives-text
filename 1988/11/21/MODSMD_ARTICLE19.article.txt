## Flicks paper-throwing as offensive as commercial 
### 
I WAS SURPRISED to see a front
page article discussing the inap
propriateness of a Body Glove
commercial shown at the ASSU Flicks.
While I agree that the commerical
was irritating, it was less irritating
than the fact that many in the audi
ence were throwing wads of paper at
each other in total disregard of those
around them.
I think it's commendable that Stan
ford students are sophisticated and
critical enough to protest the commer
cialization of the Flicks, but perhaps
they should concentrate on some of the
more obvious problems at such events.

As I sat in the orchestra section of
the auditorium last Sunday to see
"Stand and Deliver," I, and everyone
else not engaged in paper-throwing,
were caught in the cross-fire of incon
siderate, puerile boys and girls. I
couldn't believe that students at Stan
ford could act so, yes I'll say it, imma
ture.
If people want to throw things in
their dorm rooms or at a party, where
those who don't want to be involved
can leave, that is their prerogative.
However, this is inappropriate behavior
for a public auditorium. I personally
don't appreciate being beaned in the
head with paper-wads while I'm trying

to watch a movie. While I don't think
there is any danger of someone's eye
being put out, I think throwing things
in a public place shows a complete lack
of consideration for others.
I am amazed that students can
sound so high-minded about the "of
fensive" and "distracting" nature of*
the Body Glove commercial, when the
paper-throwing was far more distract
ing and tasteless.
The zoo-like behavior of the audience
at the Flicks "takes away the special
quality of seeing a movie" (to quote a
student who complained about the
commercial) in a more concrete way

than does a minute-long commercial.
My intent in this letter is not to
berate those students who offered their
opinions about the Body Glove com
mercial. They are right to question the
kinds of commercials that the ASSU
runs.
However, I would |ike to see the
ASSU exert some authority in monitor
ing the behavior of the audiences at
the Flicks so they can be enjoyed by
everyone. Those students who act like
children at the Flicks should be treated
like children and sent to bed without
seeing the movie.
