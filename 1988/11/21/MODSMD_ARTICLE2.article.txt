# Boskin denies media rumor
## Prof, says Bush has not selected chief economic adviser yet 
### Liz Lempert Staff writer With wire reports 
Despite an Associated Press
story last night naming Econom
ics Prof. Michael Boskin as the
chair of President-elect George
Bush's Council of Economic Ad
visers, Boskin told The Daily late
last night that this was an "un
substantiated rumor."
"Why would I be here at home
if the announcement were to be
made in Washington tomorrow
(today) at 9 a.m.," he asked, add
ing "This is news to me."
According to AP, Bush's official
announcement is expected this
morning. AP received its informa
tion from transition sources who
spoke only on the condition that
they not be identified.
Boskin said he expects Bush to
announce some appointments
today in Washington, but he
would not be included among
them.
He said his nomination was still
"up in the air," although there
has been wide speculation about
his appointment.
Boskin, who is also a senior fel
low at the Hoover Institution,
served informally as the economic
adviser to the Bush campaign.
The president-elect is trying to

build "the best,
most talented,
most cohesive
team he can,"
Boskin said.
"There are
many outstand
ing men and wo
men who would
make excellent
candidates for an

economic policy job," he added,
suggesting that his appointment
is still uncertain.
Boskin helped inspire Bush's
idea of a "flexibile freeze" in gov
ernment spending to wipe out
budget deficits now running at
$155 billion a year.
Touted as an authority on the
Social Security system, Boskin
argued in a recent book titled "Too
Many Promises" that the program
should be overhauled to separate
its welfare and pension functions.
Boskin proposed a two-tier sys
tem, with a flat monthly payment
aimed at helping people stay out
of poverty and the upper tier tied
strictly to how much people paid
into the system.
Currently there is a sharp tilt
to Social Security benefits, with
lower-income workers getting a
far heftier return on their payroll
taxes than middle- and upper
income workers.

'Why would I be here
at home if the an
nouncement were to
be made in Washing
ton (today) at 9 a.m.?'
— Michael Boskin

Economics Prof. Victor Fuchs
said Boskin specializes in an area
that most needs attention in the
new U.S. administration — the
budget.
In his book "Reagan and the
Economy: The Successes, Failures
and Unfinished Agenda," pub
lished last year, Boskin argued
that while real government spend
ing grew faster under Reagan
than Carter, Reagan's economic
program changed the nation's
agenda and created an opportu
nity for improved long-term eco
nomic performance.
He has also taken stands warn
ing against protectionist or panic
legislation.
While Hoover economist Martin
Anderson may also be given a po
sition in the Bush Administration,
he remained equanimous about
the possibility. "I never reject or
accept job offers I haven't re
ceived," he said recently.
