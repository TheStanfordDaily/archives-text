# Exploitation and racism unrelated
## 
### 
While the Webb ranch may indeed be
treating its workers poorly in terms of
pension, sick leave, etc., Stanford's
contracting these workers does not
necessarily mean that the University is
condoning the poor treatment of the
workers and it certainly doesn't seem
to me to be racially motivated.
Before condemning the University
for knowingly exploiting these workers,
we must first ask if the University
was aware of the terms under which
the workers were hired by Webb ranch.
After all, the University more than
adequately compensates Webb ranch for
the work.
How Webb ranch distributes the
money is not up to the University.
This is indeed a peril of contracting
out labor and may be a valid reason to
end the practice of hiring non-union
labor.
MEChA's charges of racism seem
totally unfounded. Assuming that the

$8.50 an hour paid to Webb ranch is
less than the pay a union worker
would receive, the University was un
doubtedly operating under the principle
of paying the least for the labor they
needed that they could. If I remember
my economics, it has something to do
with a free market and capitalism.
It would be extremely difficult, if not
impossible, to prove that the Univer
sity was hiring the Webb labor because
they are Mexican immigrants. Stanford
is simply making its labor dollar go as
far as it can go. Exploitation and rac
ism are not "intimately linked" as
MEChA puts it but merely two prob
lems confronted by the same group.
The exploitation stems not from the
race of the workers but from their lack
of education and marketable skills. The
answer is not to fight racism but to
fight illiteracy. The workers who have
been with Webb ranch for 25 years are
not forced to work there by the ranch
or by their race but by their lack of
education.
Stanford perhaps should not contract
out labor and Webb ranch almost cer
tainly should be more humanitarian

with their workers but I don't think
either of these problems indicates that,
as MEChA puts it,"the University
does not really have a commitment to
ending racism."
