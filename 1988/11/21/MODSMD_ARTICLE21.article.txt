# CAPS helps treat eating disorders

Dierdre Lyell has made a great con
tribution to the Stanford community
with her piece on "deadly dieting."
Although recent data indicate that
about 1 percent of women and 0.2 per
cent of men on college campuses are
bulimic, it is quite apparent from our
studies both of Stanford varsity ath
letes as well M the student body in
general that maladaptive eating be
haviors, obsession with food, dieting
and distorted body image are much
more widespread than the statistics
would indicate.
I would like to clarify some of the

statistics reported in Lyell's column.
Counseling and Psychological Services
and Women's Care at Cowell have seen
close to 400 women in treatment over
the past 10 years. In addition, we have
evaluated many more and referred
them to resources in the community
for long-term treatment. Thus in any
one year, we may see 40 to 50 women.
We are also aware of many who seek
out specific programs within the com
munity, and we encourage women to
utilize those resources which they feel
would most closely meet their needs.
The much larger issue is the educa
tion of the great mtyority of women
who, as they go through adolescence,
become increasingly unhappy with
their bodies. Part of this is media in
fluence; another is societal and/or
familial expectations for acceptability.
If there are any who would be inter
ested in forming a task force to exam
ine this issue and how we can inter
vene at a community level, I would ask
that you contact me at CAPS.
