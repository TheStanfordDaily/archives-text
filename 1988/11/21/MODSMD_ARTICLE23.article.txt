## Calories and size-five jeans 
### 
This is the second of a two-part series.
I READ THREE disturbing books this
summer: my sixth, eighth and
eleventh grade diaries.
Reading these diaries showed me not
only how quickly my world changed, but
also how much time, energy and self
esteem I wasted by obsessively focusing
upon my weight.
If I were to write an English paper on
these three masterpieces, I would say the
recurring theme of my adolescent life
would be that, while I allowed the world
to live as it chose, I was a slave to what
I thought others thought of me. While it
is true that many adolescents think this
way, my perception of their thoughts al
ways centered upon my weight.
By the 11th grade I was sure that the
world thought that I was fat (I was not)
and that my problems would disappear
if only I lost weight. Thus, my adolescent
insecurities remained unaddressed as I
focused single-mindedly on calories, car
bohydrates and size-five jeans.
Tuesday, Jan. 15, 1980 was a miserable
day in the history of my eighth-grade
existence. I had gained a pound since the
day before. I weighed 93 pounds. (I
meticulously recorded my weight daily,
at the top of each page) Frustrated, I
broke my diet at my friend Roberta's
birthday party I ate pizza and cake and
was certain that another bad day would
follow because I would probably gain an
other pound.
Two years earlier, on Feb. 8, I ex
pounded upon the merits and shortcom
ings of candy. As a sixth grader, I worried

that candy was fattening, and thought
that if I were fat, I would be a worthless
person.
Even at that early age, and even as a
tomboy, I received the subtle message
that I must be slim to be accepted.
Given a media image which often re
quires that a woman fight what is biologi
cally natural, it is easy for a woman to
think that she is overweight. Like I did,
many women attribute their problems to
their weight; they condition themselves,
or are conditioned, to find their self
worth in an often unattainable physical
ideal.
More important than understanding
where this cycle begins, as there are many
different sources, is learning to view one's
weight as external to one's self-worth.
Last week I discussed the extent and
nature of food-related problems at Stan
ford. The physical consequences of dis
orders such as bulimia and anorexia are
both deadly in their extremes.
In addition to psychological effects,
both can cause malnutrition and severely
upset one's metabolism (bulimics may
actually gain weight). Excessive self
induced vomiting destroys the stomach,
the lining of the esophagus and mouth,
and the teeth. Most significantly, it causes
electrolyte imbalances which may cause
heart failure. Unfortunately, where
anorexia is eventually detectable, bulimia
may be hidden for years.
To the person who suffers from an
eating disorder, or from a dangerous re
lationship with food, recovery may seem
impossible. However, many women do
recover, and most agree that talking

about their problems is the most healing
solution.
Friends often misunderstand those
with eating disorders. They may misin
terpret a friend's withdrawal as rejection
or become angry with her because of her
self-destructive behavior. They should
keep in mind, however, that she is most
likely lonely, ashamed and suffering from
an increasingly distorted self-image.
She may not even know herself that
her eating behavior is unhealthy; what
ever the case, she needs her friends' sup
port.
Friends can help by expressing concern,
respectfully, in a non-confrontational
manner. Gaining trust is important and
may require time and patience.
Many resources exist on this campus
to help those who suffer from eating dis
orders, and to help their friends to un
derstand the diseases. Each counselor at
CAPS is trained in eating disorders. Over
eaters Anonymous meets almost every
noon at the Bridge. The support and
discussion group "Body-Image, Food and
Self-Esteem" meets Monday nights at
8:30. In addition, this group and CAPS
sponsor dorm-outreach programs.
All of these resources are here to help.
Take advantage of them.
