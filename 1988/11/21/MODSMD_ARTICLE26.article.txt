## Clamping down on the post-nasal drip Cowell Cold Clinic provides lasting relief for victims of the seasonal sniffles 
### Kevin Wacknov 
Is your throat sore? Have you been
coughing, sneezing or feeling chilled? De
spite the considerable time and energy
advertisers and modern medicine spend
promoting the phenomenon of the com
mon cold, a proven cure for the not-so
simple ailment remains unknown.
Nonetheless, the Cowell Cold Clinic
staff helps ease the symptoms of the
common illness that plagues students
every year all over campus, particularly
this time of year.
On average, Americans catch three
colds per year, a higher incidence of af
fliction than all other diseases combined.
About $24 billion may be lost annually
in the United States because people stay
home with colds, estimates Linus

Pauling, two-time Nobel Laureate in
Chemistry and Peace. However, a fortu
nate 6 to 10 percent of the population
never experience the common cold blues.
Although no cure is known for the
common cold, a British cold researcher,
Christopher Andrewes, has written that
most people lodge their trust in at least
one or two folk remedies. Andrewes doc
umented his study of colds and cold cures
at the Cold Research Unit in Salisbury,
England, in his book called "The Common
Cold." Included in the "miracle" cures
he unearthed are: "smoking tobacco . . .
rubbing menthylated spirit into a bald
head, rubbing the body with vaseline . . .
transient exposure to tear-gas or other
war-gas, . . . inhaling powdered dry
licorice leaves . . . taking up fencing,
avoiding people with poisonous auras,
mental concentration especially on math
ematics and . . . standing on one's head
underwater."
Because colds are caused by viruses,
not bacteria, they cannot be cured by
antibiotics. Moreover, since about 150 dif
ferent cold viruses have been recorded,
immunity to one kind does not preclude
infection by the more than 149 others.
Furthermore, one can easily catch the
same cold twice, because a specific virus
can "change its superficial features like
you can change your collar," says Jim
MacMahon of Stanford's Children's
Hospital.
Hands are the primary means by which
cold viruses spread, according to Mac-
Mahon. You shake hands with someone
with a cold, inadvertently wipe your eye
or nose, and the cold virus invades. Also,
some activities involving close quarters,
such as playing cards, allow viruses to
spread easily between players; even the
cards can transport a virus.
Therefore, the parental admonishment
to wash one's hands frequently is actually
sound advice, whether to avoid giving or
getting a cold.
Air-borne particles carry cold viruses
as well, says Cowell nurse Lou Shaw.

Thus, the polite gesture of covering one's
mouth and nose with tissue when cough
ing or sneezing has clinical utility —
keeping virus-infected particles out of the
air. Well-ventilated rooms help prevent
the spread of viruses as well.
Shaw also suggests assertiveness is a
valid means to protect oneself from colds.
"Tell someone next to you to cover their
mouth when they cough, if they are not
doing so already," Shaw says.
Not accidentally, colds proliferate dur
ing the winter, according to Andrewes.
A researcher at the Cold Research Unit
Andrewes' research on colds and cold
cures shows that although cold viruses
abound all year, our defense mechanisms
which ordinarily can fight symptoms dur
ing the summer months, are weakened
by the cold weather change.
Likewise, stress, lack of sleep and poor
diet also contribute to lowering the body's
resistance to disease, says MacMahon.
Along with Andrewes' abundant po
tions and folk remedies, cold symptoms
can be effectively eased today with a num
ber of over-the-counter medicines, such
as cough suppressants, decongestants and
nasal sprays. Other time-honored meth
ods of relief include gargling with salt
water to soothe the throat. Nasal con
gestion and cough can be treated with
plenty of fluids such as juice and tea,
which also "help loosen secretions in your
respiratory tract and prevent complica
tion such as bronchitis, ear infection and
sinusitis," says a flier from the Cold
Clinic.
As a benefit to the good health of Stan
ford students, the recently-created Cold
Clinic not only provides free medicine,
professional advice and hot tea, but en
courages self-diagnosis, emphasizing that
the infected sufferers best knows their
own needs.
Begun in April by students Yen-Chi
Huang and Susan Charette, the Cold
Clinic is a project of the Student Health
Advisory, Review and Evaluation Group.
The group was created specifically to as

sist the Cowell Student Health Center to
help it more effectively meet all student
needs. Currently, 12 students operate the
organization, actively working to assuage
some of the Cowell crunch around cold
season.
During opening week at the Cold Clinic,
16 people came the first day,25 the
second. Not only does the clinic relieve
students of their colds, but also relieves
doctors and nurses of the responsibility
for treating these less technical cases,
allowing the staff to help students with
more serious illnesses.
Upon entering the clinic, located on
the first floor of Cowell, the attending
nurse or student assistant hands the cold
afflicted patient a questionnaire to fill
out. It helps ascertain the degree of sick
ness, and whether there is secondary in
fection, in which case a doctor may take
a look and prescribe an antibiotic. If the
symptoms indicate only a simple cold,
the clinic's staff provides information on
available medicines, and the patient is
free to choose a treatment from them.
In this way, the Cold Clinic encourages
"the individual to become an active and
informed participant in his or her own
health care," according to the Clinic
charter.
Senior Lauren Friedly, Cold Clinic vol
unteer, says colds often resist transmis
sion. While she has worked at the clinic,
a cold has yet to strike her. "Get plenty
of sleep and avoid all-nighters," she ad
vises cold victims.
Either Shaw, Friedly or Bonnie Fields,
another registered nurse, are available
for consultation during Cold Clinic hours,
Tuesday and Wednesday from 2 p.m. to
4:30 p.m.
Contrary to the beliefs of the main
stream medical establishment, Pauling
believes that a cure to the common cold
does exist: large doses of vitamin C. This
vitamin, ascorbic acid, can reduce the
frequency of birth defects, decrease sus
ceptibility to the common cold and other
diseases, lengthen one's life, and even

the second.

increase one's I.Q. by several points, he
says.
In his bestseller, "Vitamin C, the Com
mon Cold, and the Flu," Pauling writes
that a couple of grams of vitamin C per
day protects against the common cold
with 48 percent effectiveness. "Morever,
.. . almost every cold can be prevented
or stopped by taking a large amount [of
vitamin C] when you think you are in
danger of catching a cold or that a cold
is beginning," he writes.
Pauling warns, however, that the cold
may return if the vitamin C treatment
ends too shortly after the cold disappears.
Opposing Pauling's assertions of vita
min C's wondrous effects, MacMahon
says, "There is no evidence that vitamin
C will benefit you. 1 don't believe it shor
tens the duration of the cold. Most of
the vitamin C you take will be carried
out with your urine."
"I remain to be convinced (of the
benefits of vitamin C]," says Cowell's
John Dorman. "I don't believe there is
a cure — other than time."

antibiotics. Moreover, since about 150 dif
ferent cold viruses have been recorded,
immunity to one kind does not preclude
infection by the more than 149 others.
Furthermore, one can easily catch the
same cold twice, because a specific virus
can "change its superficial features like
you can change your collar," says Jim
MacMahon of Stanford's Children's
Hospital.
Hands are the primary means by which
cold viruses spread, according to Mac-
Mahon. You shake hands with someone
with a cold, inadvertently wipe your eye
or nose, and the cold virus invades. Also,
some activities involving close quarters,
such as playing cards, allow viruses to
spread easily between players; even the
cards can transport a virus.
Therefore, the parental admonishment
to wash one's hands frequently is actually
sound advice, whether to avoid giving or
getting a cold.
Air-borne particles carry cold viruses
as well, says Cowell nurse Lou Shaw.

Thus, the polite gesture of covering one's
mouth and nose with tissue when cough
ing or sneezing has clinical utility —
keeping virus-infected particles out of the
air. Well-ventilated rooms help prevent
the spread of viruses as well.
Shaw also suggests assertiveness is a
valid means to protect oneself from colds.
"Tell someone next to you to cover their
mouth when they cough, if they are not
doing so already," Shaw says.
Not accidentally, colds proliferate dur
ing the winter, according to Andrewes.
A researcher at the Cold Research Unit
Andrewes' research on colds and cold
cures shows that although cold viruses
abound all year, our defense mechanisms
which ordinarily can fight symptoms dur
ing the summer months, are weakened
by the cold weather change.
Likewise, stress, lack of sleep and poor
diet also contribute to lowering the body's
resistance to disease, says MacMahon.
Along with Andrewes' abundant po
tions and folk remedies, cold symptoms
can be effectively eased today with a num
ber of over-the-counter medicines, such
as cough suppressants, decongestants and
nasal sprays. Other time-honored meth
ods of relief include gargling with salt
water to soothe the throat. Nasal con
gestion and cough can be treated with
plenty of fluids such as juice and tea,
which also "help loosen secretions in your
respiratory tract and prevent complica
tion such as bronchitis, ear infection and
sinusitis," says a flier from the Cold
Clinic.
As a benefit to the good health of Stan
ford students, the recently-created Cold
Clinic not only provides free medicine,
professional advice and hot tea, but en
courages self-diagnosis, emphasizing that
the infected sufferers best knows their
own needs.
Begun in April by students Yen-Chi
Huang and Susan Charette, the Cold
Clinic is a project of the Student Health
Advisory, Review and Evaluation Group.
The group was created specifically to as

sist the Cowell Student Health Center to
help it more effectively meet all student
needs. Currently, 12 students operate the
organization, actively working to assuage
some of the Cowell crunch around cold
season.
During opening week at the Cold Clinic,
16 people came the first day,25 the
second. Not only does the clinic relieve
students of their colds, but also relieves
doctors and nurses of the responsibility
for treating these less technical cases,
allowing the staff to help students with
more serious illnesses.
Upon entering the clinic, located on
the first floor of Cowell, the attending
nurse or student assistant hands the cold
afflicted patient a questionnaire to fill
out. It helps ascertain the degree of sick
ness, and whether there is secondary in
fection, in which case a doctor may take
a look and prescribe an antibiotic. If the
symptoms indicate only a simple cold,
the clinic's staff provides information on
available medicines, and the patient is
free to choose a treatment from them.
In this way, the Cold Clinic encourages
"the individual to become an active and
informed participant in his or her own
health care," according to the Clinic
charter.
Senior Lauren Friedly, Cold Clinic vol
unteer, says colds often resist transmis
sion. While she has worked at the clinic,
a cold has yet to strike her. "Get plenty
of sleep and avoid all-nighters," she ad
vises cold victims.
Either Shaw, Friedly or Bonnie Fields,
another registered nurse, are available
for consultation during Cold Clinic hours,
Tuesday and Wednesday from 2 p.m. to
4:30 p.m.
Contrary to the beliefs of the main
stream medical establishment, Pauling
believes that a cure to the common cold
does exist: large doses of vitamin C. This
vitamin, ascorbic acid, can reduce the
frequency of birth defects, decrease sus
ceptibility to the common cold and other
diseases, lengthen one's life, and even

increase one's I.Q. by several points, he
says.
In his bestseller, "Vitamin C, the Com
mon Cold, and the Flu," Pauling writes
that a couple of grams of vitamin C per
day protects against the common cold
with 48 percent effectiveness. "Morever,
.. . almost every cold can be prevented
or stopped by taking a large amount [of
vitamin C] when you think you are in
danger of catching a cold or that a cold
is beginning," he writes.
Pauling warns, however, that the cold
may return if the vitamin C treatment
ends too shortly after the cold disappears.
Opposing Pauling's assertions of vita
min C's wondrous effects, MacMahon
says, "There is no evidence that vitamin
C will benefit you. 1 don't believe it shor
tens the duration of the cold. Most of
the vitamin C you take will be carried
out with your urine."
"I remain to be convinced (of the
benefits of vitamin C]," says Cowell's
John Dorman. "I don't believe there is
a cure — other than time."

Is your throat sore? Have you been
coughing, sneezing or feeling chilled? De
spite the considerable time and energy
advertisers and modern medicine spend
promoting the phenomenon of the com
mon cold, a proven cure for the not-so
simple ailment remains unknown.
Nonetheless, the Cowell Cold Clinic
staff helps ease the symptoms of the
common illness that plagues students
every year all over campus, particularly
this time of year.
On average, Americans catch three
colds per year, a higher incidence of af
fliction than all other diseases combined.
About $24 billion may be lost annually
in the United States because people stay
home with colds, estimates Linus

Pauling, two-time Nobel Laureate in
Chemistry and Peace. However, a fortu
nate 6 to 10 percent of the population
never experience the common cold blues.
Although no cure is known for the
common cold, a British cold researcher,
Christopher Andrewes, has written that
most people lodge their trust in at least
one or two folk remedies. Andrewes doc
umented his study of colds and cold cures
at the Cold Research Unit in Salisbury,
England, in his book called "The Common
Cold." Included in the "miracle" cures
he unearthed are: "smoking tobacco . . .
rubbing menthylated spirit into a bald
head, rubbing the body with vaseline . . .
transient exposure to tear-gas or other
war-gas, . . . inhaling powdered dry
licorice leaves . . . taking up fencing,
avoiding people with poisonous auras,
mental concentration especially on math
ematics and . . . standing on one's head
underwater."
