# Making ends meet: Stanford center studies conflict resolution
## 
### Eric Muñoz 
The headlines reporting conflict
are all too familiar. The union
threatens to strike. Bombing and
riots in the occupied territories
continue. Trade practices draw
fire. Congress divided over wel
fare legislation.
And sometimes, news of reso
lution also appears on front pages.
Agreement between negotiating
teams prevents strike at last min
ute. Mid-East peace talks pro
posed. Import regulations
stiffened. House and Senate com
promise on work requirement for
welfare recipients.
Other conflicts don't gain public
attention, but determine personal
and private life. Corporate barter
ing, divorce, property damage law
suits, paying the restaurant bill.
Even in light of a happy ending
or agreeable solution, processes
facilitating resolution often seem
unacceptably inefficient,
protracted, costly and unsatisfy
ing.
A new center at Stanford has
been established to illuminate
these processes. Aiming to under
stand why and how acceptable
compromises and concessions
often elude individuals, interest
groups, corporations and nations,
the Stanford Center on Conflict

and Negotiation was recently es
tablished.
"To resolve disputes more ef
fectively in this society and among
nations," the center courts the
knowledge and skills of
anthropologists, sociologists, po
litical scientists, historians,
philosophers and others.
The center itself will not find
solutions or compromises to prob
lems but will harbor interdiscipli
nary research and theory-building
on conflict and resolution in all
areas of life. Members of the cen
ter will work to uncover barriers
impeding negotiations and solu
tions of public and personal con
flict and create innovative ways
to reduce or overcome such bar
riers.
With funding from the William
and Flora Hewlitt Foundation,
the Law School, the Graduate
School of Business, the School of
Humanities and Sciences and
private corporations, the center is
a collaboration of five disciplines
— law, economics, business man
agement and cognitive and social
psychology.
With this store of research
power, the center will tackle all
conflicts with the assumption that
all have the potential for
profitable solutions.

"There is almost no type of con
flict that cannot be diagnosed and
resolved more effectively than it
is today," says Daniel Abbasi, as
sociate director of the center.
"Right now we are in the midst
of what has been called the 'al
ternative dispute resolution revo
lution', which amounts to
dramatically increasing use of
procedures such as third-party
mediation to help disputants avoid

litigation."
The center hopes to keep Stan
ford in the forefront of this alter
native dispute resolution field,
and will extend the research to
applications outside the legal
arena.
Says Abbasi, "We are investi
gating fundamental barriers that
will hopefully apply to resolving
and managing interpersonal con
flict, community disputes, Arab-

Israeli conflicts, and ultimately,
U.S.-Soviet conflict."
The principle faculty members
of the center include Law Prof.
Robert Mnookin, Economics Prof,
and Nobel laureate Kenneth Ar
row, Psychology Profs. Amos
Tversky and Lee Ross and Busi
ness School Economics Prof.
Robert Wilson.
Already, with involvement from
faculty of various disciplines as
well as professionals in dispute
resolution, the center has come
up with some innovative theories.
Research done at the center
shows that potential "gains from
trade" often exist in bargaining
situations but go unutilized be
cause participants withhold their
true interests and feign agreement
to the proposed concessions. Ne
gotiators mistakenly think this
will maximize their returns.
Two people wanting the same
orange illustrates this idea of po
tential "gain from trade." Al
though not admitting to each
other how one wants the orange
only for its pulp and the other
for the rind, the two individuals
reach an agreement to cut the or
ange in half. Absurdly, much of
the orange goes to waste and each
party gets half of what they hoped
for.

In real life situations, the stakes
are usually much higher and the
losses much greater.
In other recent work, Mnookin,
director of the Center, and Wilson
collaborated on a project exploring
the legal and institutional barriers
impeding settlement of the largest
commercial dispute in American
history — between Texaco and
Penzoil.
Their research showed that cer
tain laws created incentives uni
ntentionally div ding the interests
of Texaco's stockholders and the
company officers.
They reasoned that an early
settlement would have benefitted
the stockholders but not the offi
cers, and consequently, the com
pany spent much time and money
to protract the litigation.
Wilson is currently studying
how strikes and lockouts are used
to escalate the costs of delayed
agreement.
Researchers at the center have
also explored the realm of sub
conscious barriers in the minds
of negotiators.
As Abbasi sees it, the center is
"holding out a challenge to both
graduate students and faculty to
apply their own methodologies to
helping us understand how better
to resolve conflict."

With this store of research
power, the center will tackle all
conflicts with the assumption that
all have the potential for
profitable solutions.

"There is almost no type of con
flict that cannot be diagnosed and
resolved more effectively than it
is today," says Daniel Abbasi, as
sociate director of the center.
"Right now we are in the midst
of what has been called the 'al
ternative dispute resolution revo
lution', which amounts to
dramatically increasing use of
procedures such as third-party
mediation to help disputants avoid

litigation."
The center hopes to keep Stan
ford in the forefront of this alter
native dispute resolution field,
and will extend the research to
applications outside the legal
arena.
Says Abbasi, "We are investi
gating fundamental barriers that
will hopefully apply to resolving
and managing interpersonal con
flict, community disputes, Arab-

Israeli conflicts, and ultimately,
U.S.-Soviet conflict."
The principle faculty members
of the center include Law Prof.
Robert Mnookin, Economics Prof,
and Nobel laureate Kenneth Ar
row, Psychology Profs. Amos
Tversky and Lee Ross and Busi
ness School Economics Prof.
Robert Wilson.
Already, with involvement from
faculty of various disciplines as
well as professionals in dispute
resolution, the center has come
up with some innovative theories.
Research done at the center
shows that potential "gains from
trade" often exist in bargaining
situations but go unutilized be
cause participants withhold their
true interests and feign agreement
to the proposed concessions. Ne
gotiators mistakenly think this
will maximize their returns.
Two people wanting the same
orange illustrates this idea of po
tential "gain from trade." Al
though not admitting to each
other how one wants the orange
only for its pulp and the other
for the rind, the two individuals
reach an agreement to cut the or
ange in half. Absurdly, much of
the orange goes to waste and each
party gets half of what they hoped
for.

In real life situations, the stakes
are usually much higher and the
losses much greater.
In other recent work, Mnookin,
director of the Center, and Wilson
collaborated on a project exploring
the legal and institutional barriers
impeding settlement of the largest
commercial dispute in American
history — between Texaco and
Penzoil.
Their research showed that cer
tain laws created incentives uni
ntentionally div ding the interests
of Texaco's stockholders and the
company officers.
They reasoned that an early
settlement would have benefitted
the stockholders but not the offi
cers, and consequently, the com
pany spent much time and money
to protract the litigation.
Wilson is currently studying
how strikes and lockouts are used
to escalate the costs of delayed
agreement.
Researchers at the center have
also explored the realm of sub
conscious barriers in the minds
of negotiators.
As Abbasi sees it, the center is
"holding out a challenge to both
graduate students and faculty to
apply their own methodologies to
helping us understand how better
to resolve conflict."

The headlines reporting conflict
are all too familiar. The union
threatens to strike. Bombing and
riots in the occupied territories
continue. Trade practices draw
fire. Congress divided over wel
fare legislation.
And sometimes, news of reso
lution also appears on front pages.
Agreement between negotiating
teams prevents strike at last min
ute. Mid-East peace talks pro
posed. Import regulations
stiffened. House and Senate com
promise on work requirement for
welfare recipients.
Other conflicts don't gain public
attention, but determine personal
and private life. Corporate barter
ing, divorce, property damage law
suits, paying the restaurant bill.
Even in light of a happy ending
or agreeable solution, processes
facilitating resolution often seem
unacceptably inefficient,
protracted, costly and unsatisfy
ing.
A new center at Stanford has
been established to illuminate
these processes. Aiming to under
stand why and how acceptable
compromises and concessions
often elude individuals, interest
groups, corporations and nations,
the Stanford Center on Conflict

and Negotiation was recently es
tablished.
"To resolve disputes more ef
fectively in this society and among
nations," the center courts the
knowledge and skills of
anthropologists, sociologists, po
litical scientists, historians,
philosophers and others.
The center itself will not find
solutions or compromises to prob
lems but will harbor interdiscipli
nary research and theory-building
on conflict and resolution in all
areas of life. Members of the cen
ter will work to uncover barriers
impeding negotiations and solu
tions of public and personal con
flict and create innovative ways
to reduce or overcome such bar
riers.
With funding from the William
and Flora Hewlitt Foundation,
the Law School, the Graduate
School of Business, the School of
Humanities and Sciences and
private corporations, the center is
a collaboration of five disciplines
— law, economics, business man
agement and cognitive and social
psychology.
With this store of research
power, the center will tackle all
conflicts with the assumption that
all have the potential for
profitable solutions.
