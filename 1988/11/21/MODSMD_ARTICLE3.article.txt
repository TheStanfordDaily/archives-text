# Stanford secures large EPA grant
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
Working in conjunction with Oregon State Uni
versity, Stanford recently beat out six West Coast
competitors to secure a $3.75 million Environmental
Protection Agency research grant to study problems
of hazardous waste.
The funds will be used to house the EPA Western
Regions Hazardous Substances Research Center at
Stanford. Stanford and Oregon researchers at the
center will investigate the manufacture, use, trans
portation and disposal of hazardous substances in
West Coast states, including California.
The EPA gave groups of universities, chosen from
four other regions of the country, comparable fund
ing to set up their own regional centers for the
study of hazardous waste.
At Stanford, the center will bring together faculty
from many departments campus wide — including
geology, physics and several engineering depart
ments. These staff members will receive, approve
and implement research proposals from members
of the two universities.
With work at the center scheduled to begin in
January 1989, the center's director, Civil Engineer
ing Prof. Perry McCarty, said researchers there will
have their work cut out for them.
"Hazardous substances create
enormous problems of enormous
complexity," he said. "Right now,
residue is just put somewhere,
and the chemicals can vaporize
into air or leak into groundwater."
Calling current waste manage
ment technology "primitive,"
McCarty said the research center
will provide an important oppor
tunity to explore new ways in
which hazardous wastes can be
reduced or eliminated in the fu
ture.
In addition, McCarty said he
hopes future research will reveal
more cost efficient ways of dealing
with hazardous wastes.
Currently, the EPA's Superfund
legislation, which aims to identify
areas which need to be cleaned

up, has already located nearly
1,000 severely polluted sites
nationwide.
McCarty said the cost of clean
ing a single site can climb to $25
million, while the total cost of
cleaning these sites may be as
high as $300 billion.
In fighting for the privilege of
running the center, the Stanford
Oregon State consortium com
peted against six other teams of
schools to receive the EPA funds.
The rival teams of universities
were led by the California Insti
tute of Technology, UCLA, UC-
Berkeley, UC-Davis, the Univer
sity of Southern California and
the University of Alaska.
Stanford and UCLA were tied
in the competition for two weeks
prior to the EPA's final decision
on Oct. 28, according to Environ
mental Microbiology Prof. Dunja
Grbic-Galic, also a member of the
center's staff.
