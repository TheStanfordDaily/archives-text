Working in conjunction with Oregon State Uni
versity, Stanford recently beat out six West Coast
competitors to secure a $3.75 million Environmental
Protection Agency research grant to study problems
of hazardous waste.
The funds will be used to house the EPA Western
Regions Hazardous Substances Research Center at
Stanford. Stanford and Oregon researchers at the
center will investigate the manufacture, use, trans
portation and disposal of hazardous substances in
West Coast states, including California.
The EPA gave groups of universities, chosen from
four other regions of the country, comparable fund
ing to set up their own regional centers for the
study of hazardous waste.
At Stanford, the center will bring together faculty
from many departments campus wide â€” including
geology, physics and several engineering depart
ments. These staff members will receive, approve
and implement research proposals from members
of the two universities.
With work at the center scheduled to begin in
January 1989, the center's director, Civil Engineer
ing Prof. Perry McCarty, said researchers there will
have their work cut out for them.
