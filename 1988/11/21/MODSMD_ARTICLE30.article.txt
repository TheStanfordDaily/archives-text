# Card football: the final word
## 
### 
It was the best of years; it
was the worst of years.
And, it came to a close
with the classiest of teams and
the most classless.

So ends the 1988 football
season for the Stanford Cardi
nal and the California Golden
Bears.
A 19-19 tie in Big Game was
not exactly the sweet finish
Stanford had hoped for to re
move the bad taste this season
has left in its mouth. Nonethe
less, it was fitting that Califor
nia failed to come away with
a victory and a winning season.
"We're ticked off. The other
team (Stanford) — they're just
happy they got a tie off us. I
think that speaks for it," Cal's
David Ortega said.
Gimme a break!
While Ortega and his im
potent Bear teammates were
beating up on high-school
quality foes like Pacific,
Temple and Kansas — perhaps
the worst team in Division I-A
— in their non-conference
games, Stanford took on teams

like No. 1 Notre Dame and No.
2 USC.
USC is in the Pacific 10 Con
ference, you say. True, but
Stanford would've missed the
Trojans in the normal Pac-10
rotation this season.
Instead, the Cardinal passed
up a cream-puff opponent and
scheduled USC among its eight
games against conference foes.
The Bears chose to play only
seven teams in the nation's
toughest league this year.
And, while Stanford has but
three wins to show for its ef
forts, the Cardinal can look
back and take some pride in
what it has accomplished:
• Jon Volpe emerged as a
star running back. The sopho
more had one of the best sea
sons in Stanford history. He'll
be back.
• Rob Hinckley and Jono
Tunney established themselves
as two of the top linebackers
in the country. Coming out of
nowhere, Hinckley, Public
Enemy No. 1 to quarterbacks
everywhere, and "Tackling Ma
chine" Tunney will both be
back.
• Alan Grant carried around
a clipping that suggested the
Cardinal had the Pac-10's
worst seconday with him all
year. He and teammates Kevin
Scott and Rob Englehardt
proved that Stanford's is one
of the best. They'll all be back
too.
• Lester Archambeau and

Scott Palmbush were standouts
on the defensive line and will both
be back.
• Walter Batson, Jon Pinckney,
Jim Price, Chris Walsh and
Charlie Young provided ample
targets for the run-and-shoot of
fense.
• John Hopkins provided
stability at the placekicker posi
tion for the first time in a while.
After Big Game, Tunney said
"I don't really care about the Axe,
so [keeping it] is no consolation."
Hopefully, after Tunney and his
mates heal their wounded bodies,
they'll find some consolation in
the fact that much of this year's
talented team is coming back.
The biggest losses come on the
offensive line, where three of five
starters are graduating. In addi
tion, defensive leader Kevin Rich
ardson and noseguard Ray Huck

estein, one of classiest athletes
one could hope to meet and one
who I will miss personally, have
played their last game for Stan
ford.
Certainly for center Andy
Sinclair and possibly for Huckes
tein, NFL careers lie in the future.
To them, the best of luck.
And, to the entire team, a sin
cere hope that they'll take the
next couple of weeks off to
recuperate. Then as they begin
winter conditioning, and take the
first steps down the long road to
next year's opener, let us hope
they maintain the gritty determi
nation and team spirit that was
manifest all year.
At this time next year, they
should be savoring the sweetness
of winning, and possibly, dare I
say it, making travel plans to a
bowl game.
