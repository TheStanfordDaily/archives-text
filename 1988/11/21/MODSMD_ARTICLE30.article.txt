# Card football: the final word
## 
### 
It was the best of years; it
was the worst of years.
And, it came to a close
with the classiest of teams and
the most classless.

So ends the 1988 football
season for the Stanford Cardi
nal and the California Golden
Bears.
A 19-19 tie in Big Game was
not exactly the sweet finish
Stanford had hoped for to re
move the bad taste this season
has left in its mouth. Nonethe
less, it was fitting that Califor
nia failed to come away with
a victory and a winning season.
"We're ticked off. The other
team (Stanford) — they're just
happy they got a tie off us. I
think that speaks for it," Cal's
David Ortega said.
Gimme a break!
While Ortega and his im
potent Bear teammates were
beating up on high-school
quality foes like Pacific,
Temple and Kansas — perhaps
the worst team in Division I-A
— in their non-conference
games, Stanford took on teams

like No. 1 Notre Dame and No.
2 USC.
USC is in the Pacific 10 Con
ference, you say. True, but
Stanford would've missed the
Trojans in the normal Pac-10
rotation this season.
Instead, the Cardinal passed
up a cream-puff opponent and
scheduled USC among its eight
games against conference foes.
The Bears chose to play only
seven teams in the nation's
toughest league this year.
And, while Stanford has but
three wins to show for its ef
forts, the Cardinal can look
back and take some pride in
what it has accomplished:
• Jon Volpe emerged as a
star running back. The sopho
more had one of the best sea
sons in Stanford history. He'll
be back.
• Rob Hinckley and Jono
Tunney established themselves
as two of the top linebackers
in the country. Coming out of
nowhere, Hinckley, Public
Enemy No. 1 to quarterbacks
everywhere, and "Tackling Ma
chine" Tunney will both be
back.
• Alan Grant carried around
a clipping that suggested the
Cardinal had the Pac-10's
worst seconday with him all
year. He and teammates Kevin
Scott and Rob Englehardt
proved that Stanford's is one
of the best. They'll all be back
too.
