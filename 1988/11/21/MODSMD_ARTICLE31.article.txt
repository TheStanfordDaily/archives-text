# Hoosiers defeat Card hoopsters
## 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
Fouling up, and most of all,
fouling out, the Stanford men's
basketball team missed a golden
opportunity to start establishing
itself as a national power last
night when it was eliminated from
the Big Apple National Invitation
Tournament by Indiana, 84-73.
Men's Basketball
Hoosiers 84, Cardinal 73
The No. 20 Cardinal, which
opened its season Friday night
with an easy first-round NIT win
at Montana, 79-63, trailed the
Hoosiers by between five and 11
points virtually the entire contest
but could never put together a
run to take over the game, wit
nessed by 12,078 at Assembly Hal!
in Bloomington, Ind.
"I was disappointed we didn't
play better than we did," Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said.
"We got out of sync in the first
half and didn't take advantage of
the things we can do."
And it only got harder when
one-by-one, the active roster for
the Cardinal was reduced from
12 to seven as Eric Reveno,
Howard Wright, Andrew Vlahov,
Deshon Wingate and Todd Lichti
all fouled out. Referees whistled
Stanford for 34 fouls compared
to 20 for the Hoosiers.
Indiana took advantage of the
Cardinal fouls to make 33-of-44
free throws in advancing to the
NIT final four at Madison Square
Garden along with North

Carolina, Missouri and Syracuse.
Hoosier center Todd Jadlow,
fouled almost every time he went
up for a shot, nailed 17-of-19 from
the line and finished with 23
points to go with 12 rebounds.
And Jay Edwards, last year's Big
Ten Conference Freshman of the
Year, showed that it was no fluke
that he led the Big Ten in free
throw and 3-point field-goal per
centage when he canned 8-of-10
from the line along with five 3-
pointers for a game-high 27
points.
Lichti led the way for Stanford
with 22 points and seven
rebounds. Terry Taylor scored 12
and Reveno 11.
In the first half, Stanford
quickly fell behind 5-0 but came
back to tie at 11 when Jadlow
goaltended a Lichti shot while
fouling him.
Stanford could have then gone
ahead but Lichti missed the free
throw. That ended up being Stan
ford's last chance at the lead, as
Indiana ran off nine in a row to
take its biggest lead of the half,
20-11.
Thanks mainly to the Hoosiers'
12 first-half turnovers, however,
Stanford stayed close, going into
halftime trailing only 32-27.
A layin by Wright (8 points) cut
Indiana's lead to three early in
the second half, but a 10-0 run
by the Hoosiers boosted the mar
gin to 44-31.
Taylor's 22-footer with 6:02 left
shaved the lead back down to five,
but 80 seconds later, Reveno be
came the first of the foulsome
fivesome to have to leave the
game, and Stanford would get no
closer.
