LOS ANGELES — Finishing
stronger than they started, the
Stanford women's volleyball team
ended the weekend road trip and
the Cardinal's Pacific 10 Confer
ence schedule with a 15-17, 15-12,
15-9, 15-10 win over 17th-ranked
USC in a match marked by
streaky play and proficient middle
hitting by both squads.

Stanford concludes its regular
season home schedule this evening
at 7:30 p.m. against Colorado
before taking a hiatus until the
start of postseason play Dec. 1.
After a Thursday night loss to
No. 1 UCLA and the victory at
USC, Stanford settles for second

in the Pac-10 and in the nation
with a 16-2 conference mark, 26-2
overall. The Bruins have also as
sured themselves a nod to host
the West Regional of the NCAA
Tournament, in which the Cardi
nal should be the second seed.
The Trojans may also receive
an NCAA berth, but their seeding
will certainly be less generous.
The loss to Stanford dropped
USC's record to 9-8,17-12 overall,
but did not dislodge the team from
fourth place in the league.
At points in the match, however,
the Trojans did not play like a
fourth place team. Physically
strong and motivated, USC was
quick to capitalize on streaks of
poor Stanford passing and keep
the match within reach.
But in the end, Stanford was
too tough an opponent to contain.
Led by middle blocker Amy
Cooper — who finished the match
with 19 kills, two block solos, four
block assists and a scorching .531

hitting percentage — Stanford
rode out the periodic Trojan of
fensive gusts to secure its 26th
win.
"Under the circumstances,
having to come down and get
pumped up for UCLA and go
through a match like that, and
then come back and play a team
like [USC] that has that much
physical talent, it's a tough, tough
weekend for any team," Stanford
Coach Don Shaw said.
"We had chances to win the first
game and we kind of handed it
away," he added. "Shoot, to come
back and beat that team three
straight, that's the mark of a good
team. It's never easy to win down
here in this gym."
Fortunately for the Cardinal,
North Gym turned into a smaller
scale Maples Pavilion filled with
Stanford supporters. With most
