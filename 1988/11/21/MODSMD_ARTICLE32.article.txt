LOS ANGELES — Finishing
stronger than they started, the
Stanford women's volleyball team
ended the weekend road trip and
the Cardinal's Pacific 10 Confer
ence schedule with a 15-17, 15-12,
15-9, 15-10 win over 17th-ranked
USC in a match marked by
streaky play and proficient middle
hitting by both squads.

Stanford concludes its regular
season home schedule this evening
at 7:30 p.m. against Colorado
before taking a hiatus until the
start of postseason play Dec. 1.
After a Thursday night loss to
No. 1 UCLA and the victory at
USC, Stanford settles for second

in the Pac-10 and in the nation
with a 16-2 conference mark, 26-2
overall. The Bruins have also as
sured themselves a nod to host
the West Regional of the NCAA
Tournament, in which the Cardi
nal should be the second seed.
The Trojans may also receive
an NCAA berth, but their seeding
will certainly be less generous.
The loss to Stanford dropped
USC's record to 9-8,17-12 overall,
but did not dislodge the team from
fourth place in the league.
At points in the match, however,
the Trojans did not play like a
fourth place team. Physically
strong and motivated, USC was
quick to capitalize on streaks of
poor Stanford passing and keep
the match within reach.
But in the end, Stanford was
too tough an opponent to contain.
Led by middle blocker Amy
Cooper — who finished the match
with 19 kills, two block solos, four
block assists and a scorching .531

hitting percentage — Stanford
rode out the periodic Trojan of
fensive gusts to secure its 26th
win.
"Under the circumstances,
having to come down and get
pumped up for UCLA and go
through a match like that, and
then come back and play a team
like [USC] that has that much
physical talent, it's a tough, tough
weekend for any team," Stanford
Coach Don Shaw said.
"We had chances to win the first
game and we kind of handed it
away," he added. "Shoot, to come
back and beat that team three
straight, that's the mark of a good
team. It's never easy to win down
here in this gym."
Fortunately for the Cardinal,
North Gym turned into a smaller
scale Maples Pavilion filled with
Stanford supporters. With most
of the team members' families
living in Southern California, the
crowd contained a vocal pro-
Cardinal contingent that matched
the Trojan band and sparse fans
in their enthusiasm and volume.
Especially integral in the Car
dinal comeback was setter Lara
Asper, who ran a diverse enough
offense to keep the Trojan block
ers guessing while consistent
enough to place four hitters in
double figures for kills and the
team attack percentage at .307.
"Lara did a great job setting
tonight," Shaw said. "She ran the
middle really well from off the
net, which is something we ha
ven't done and need to do more
of. We were able to get that going,
and that really opened things up.
"We struggled early, we didn't
use the middle well enough. On
the outside, USC changed their
lineup since the first time we

played them and put some bigger
blockers out there, so until we
started using the middle we were
really going against odds."
The Cardinal was equally out
of sort for a time with the unor
thodox USC offense. The Trojans
outhit the Cardinal in game one
by a sizeable .260-. 178 margin,
but Stanford soon adjusted and
put up a stronger defensive front.
"Basically they run a really
quick offense. They pass the ball
low to the net and they run slides
and double-quicks, and that's not
something you see in practice
every day," said Stanford hitter
Kristin Klein, who added 14 digs
and three blocks to her 13-kill
offensive performance.
"We prepared for it, because we
knew they do it, but it's not the
same as actually playing and
trying to dig and defend it,"the
freshman added.
The Cardinal modified its de
fense well enough to win the final
two games, though periods of un

steady passing and offensive ex
plosions by McAllister and
powerful outside hitter Lonise
Norfleet kept the match respect
able.
Card notes
The match tonight in general re
mains nebulous, as Colorado is a
young and unfamiliar opponent for
the Cardinal. Winners in nine of their
past 10 matches, however, the Buf
faloes will not be taken lightly by
Stanford in the last regular season
match and the final home match for
senior Amy Hayes.
"I know a little about their players
from last year, but every coach I've
talked to says they're 60 to 70 percent
better than last year," Shaw said.
"This year they've really improved —
they've got the same kids, they're just
a year older and they have good
coaches.
"It's going to be a good battle for
us. We may try a couple of things
that we will want to use in the
playoffs."
