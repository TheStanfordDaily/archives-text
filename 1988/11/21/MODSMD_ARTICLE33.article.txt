While most Cardinal fans
reminisce about the excitement
and joy always associated with
tie games, Stanford's wrestling
team concentrates on the more
boring task of winning.
Wrestling
Cardinal 29, Aggies 10
Hold the phone!
Is this the same "senior-less"
wrestling team that finished 5-
8-0 and 10th in the Pac-10 last
year? You bet.
Despite having no seniors, no
scholarships, ana a losing record
in 1987-88, this year's Cardinal
squad stands at an impressive

2-0 and looks forward to squar
ing off against Western Oregon
State Nov. 25 and Oregon Nov.
26 in Maples Pavilion.
Last Friday, Stanford
whipped UC-Davis 29-10 at the
Aggie home stadium. The meet,
however, looked bleak in the be
ginning. Stanford freshman
standouts Dave Nowick and
Mark Forman lost close matches
in the 118- and 126-pound
weight classes, respectively. In
the third contest, sophomore
Josh Lisle (118 lbs.) tied Davis'
John Nelson. Sophomore James
Dinette provided the team with
its first spark as he scored a
msyor decision (12-4) over Brian
Spillman in the 142-Ib. class.
Dinette had lost 7-4 to Spillman
last year, making the victory es
pecially "sweet," according to
Dinette.

After the Dinette triumph,
Geoff Buam won a rmyor deci
sion over Bruce Pearson in the
150 lbs. division. Stanford
Coach Chris Horpel commented,
"Geoff looked especially good.
He totally dominated the guy."
In the 158 lbs. class, sop
homor Matt Nowlis tied Dan
Gwaltney. Coming off injuries
to his knee and elbow, junior
Steve Yarbrough won a decisive
match (10-4) in the 167 lbs. di
vision.
In perhaps the most impres
sive victory of the competition,
undefeated sophomore Steve
Buddie recorded a mtgor deci
sion (13-5) over the Aggies' Don
Zeman, a 1987-88 top-six finis
her in the Division II nationals.
Junior Ron Perry followed suit
by pinning Brian Ard in under
two minutes.
