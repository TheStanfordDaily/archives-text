Water Polo
Bears 5, Cardinal 4
The sophomore's strike, his
third of the day, could not rescue
the Cardinal from California's
potent defense and its previous
inability to convert on scoring op
portunites, and he and the water
polo squad were forced to watch
the clock run out on a 5-4 Bear
victory. The loss in the season
concluding game put Stanford at
21-10 for the year, 2-4 in Pacific
10 Conference play.
True to Coach Dante Det
tamanti's prophetic words, the
low scoring contest went to the
team who took early control.
Definitely not outplayed, the
third-rated Cardinal, nonetheless,
was unable to overcome an early
3-0 deficit against the nation's

top-ranked team.
"We got down 3-0 right away
and it was just too tough to come
back," sophomore driver Chuck
Maguy said. "We didn't get any
thing from our set offense."
The contest started out as a
defensive battle, with Stanford
stealing the ball from Cal on the
Bear's first three possessions and
both squads trading blocked shots.
But Cal's Ivan Ortiz put away the
first score of the game, and a
four-meter penalty shot by leading
scorer Kirk Everist put the Bears
up 3-0 at the beginning of the
second quarter. Back to back
scores by McNair and Andrew
Lawson temporarily put Stanford
back in the game, but the squad
was unable to maintain its mo
mentum.
"It was really hard to get any
thing going in the first half on
account of the turnovers, bad
passes, and the high amount of
offensive fouls called. We never
had a chance to run an offense,"
Dettamanti said.
The Bears went up 5-2 in the
third period, and offensive fouls,
an inability to capitalize on six
on-five situations, and Cal's strin
gent defense kept Stanford off the
board the entire quarter. One min

ute into the final quarter McNair
tallied his second score of the day,
but it was to be the second-to-last
tally of the contest.
Not only did the battle between
two strong defensive squads keep
the score low, it also turned the
game into something less than an
exhibition of championship water
polo. The clash between Stan
ford's potent "D", anchored by
two-time All-American Kemp, and
the Bear's renowned backcourt,
led by Olympic-alternate goal
tender Jeff Brush, led to a fairly
sloppy game. "It was exciting be
cause it was so close, but it was
pretty sloppy — the game was
not well-played by either team,"
Dettamanti said.
According to Dettamanti, the
final result came down to which
squad was able to convert its man
up opportunites into scores. Stan
ford went 0-3 in the six-on-five
situations Cal handed them. The
Bears utilized their gifts a little
more wisely. The Cardinal was un
able to overcome the disadvan
tage.

just didn't play well at first and

Todd Kemp stopped this shot, but the All-American wasn't able to hold off the Cal attack as the
Bears won the regular season finale 5-4.
On account of its record and
strength of schedule, Stanford has
been seeded fourth for the upcom
ing NCAA Tournament. Although
the loss does not add to the Car
dinal's end-of-the season momen
tum, the squad does not consider
the defeat a step backward in its
post-season title quest.
"We're still in a position where
we have a pretty good chance at
winning. Maybe the loss put us
back a litte but we're been playing
good water polo these past few
weeks. I'm confident," Maguy
said.
"Losing by one to the number
one team in the country is actu
ally going to give us confidence
heading into NCAA's," Det
tamanti said.
