Stanford cross-country runner Carol
Gray will face the best in the country
at the NCAA Championships today in
Des Moines, lowa.
Gray was second at the District-8
championship meet, giving coach Brooks
Johnson the confidence that she could
finish with the winners.
She was 25th at the NCAA meet in
1986 in 17:39.52, winning All-American
honors.
This talented junior has been the heart
of the women's cross-country team. She
started the season strong, winning the
Stanford Invitational early in October.
She went out in the lead at the Pacific
10 Championships with a five-minute
first mile, but faded to sixth over the
backstretch of the 5,000-meter race.
By contrast, Gray ran a more conser
vative race at the District meet and

kicked to second place. In today's race,
however, she will have to run at the
front and stay in front. At the NCAA
Championships, the pace goes out fast
and stays fast, with the survivors coming
out on top.
Gray is considered the hardest
working athlete on the women's team,
and has not let success in athletics affect
her academic life. Her name will most
likely remain a continued presence on
the newly-instituted Athletic Honor
Award for academics.
"She has had to make sacrifices," ac
cording to Johnson. As the new team
captain for the women, Gray has had
an expanding leadership role on a team
consisting primarily of underclassmen.
In addition, he noted, Gray cut short
"her best chance" to make the 1988
United States Olympic team to be ready
for the season.
Gray is hoping that her race today
will make it all worthwhile.
