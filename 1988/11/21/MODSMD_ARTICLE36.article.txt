# Stanford dominates Cal fencers
## 
### Doug Boeschen Staff writer 
Stanford's men's and women's fencing
teams, picked by many as the best in
the western region for this season,
squared off against California's duelers
last Friday in their own version of the
Big Game. Although this contest wasn't
as close as the football game, the match
was just as exciting and the Stanford
teams both raised their records to 4-0.

The Cardinal team was psyched up
for their match with the Bears. "We're
basically gonna kick their ass," claimed
epee swordsman Rich Reader just prior
to the match. With blades flying, the
action was hot and heavy until the Stan
ford teams emerged as the victors. The
men's team came out on top 17-10 and

the women won easily 13-1.
The men were ready for the Cal fenc
ers and were led by undefeated showings
from Reader and freshmen Leonard
D'Amico and Nick Bravin. Reader, like
many of the Stanford fencers, showed
great poise in winning two close bouts
5-4.
The products of what women's coach
Sherry Posthumus calls a "very good
recruiting year," Bravin and D'Amico
had no trouble in defeating their oppo
nents. D'Amico helped lead the starting
saber team of himself, Dave Russ, and
captain Mike Cramer to an impressive
7-2 record over the Bears. Bravin was
impressive in allowing only three
touches against him in three bouts. -His
reverse over-the-shoulder touch in his
final bout led one of his teammates to
exclaim, "Wow! I don't think we even
have a name for that move." ' ' ,
The Cardinal women were awesome
in defeating the weak Cal team. The
starting squad of seniors Juliet Johnson
and Tracy Schmidt, juniors Elisabeth

Spilman and Grace Chang, and sopho
more Olivia Judson went undefeated in
leading the team to victory. With the
match wrapped up early, the women
starters began to rotate in the other
fencers until every member of the team
had dueled.
But the Stanford women were the
first to admit that the Cal team was
very weak. Last year's NCAA Western
Regional champions, the Cardinal is
looking forward to their road trip to
the east coast in two weeks. The com
petition there will be much tougher.
Men's coach Zoran Tulum says, "Fenc
ing in the east is much more developed
than here in the west."
But as D'Amico said, "The team goal
is always just to win." And win they
did in dominating the unfortunate
Bears. The football game may have
resulted in a tie but there was never
any doubt as to the outcome of this
match. Stanford fencers showed Cal that
they just may be the best in the west.
