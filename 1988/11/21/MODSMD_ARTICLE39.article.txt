# Expert claims that computer use differs by gender
## 
### Jock Friedly Senior staff writer 
A new method should be used
for teaching women computer pro
gramming because women and
men take different approaches to
problem solving, Deborah Brec
her, an expert on how females use
computers, said Saturday.
Brecher, founder and director
of the Women's Computer
Literacy Project in San Francisco,
said a distinction should be made
between what she termed "male
type learners" and "female-type
learners."

"I'm not talking about women
being better or worse (than men).
I'm talking about a different kind
of interaction (with computers),"
she said, pointing out that females
tend not to be "computer nerds"
like men. Instead, women interact
better in social groups and don't
like to spend all of their time alone
in front of a computer screen.
Brecher said the distinction be
tween "male-type" and "female
type" learners was gender-based
as opposed to sex-based, since not
all women had to be "female-type
learners" and not all men had to
be "male-type learners."

She spoke to a predominantly
male group in Cubberley Audito
rium during a weekend-long con
ference of Computer Professionals
for Social Responsibility.
While "male-type learners" ex
cel in rule-base learning and sol
ving problems by trial and error,
"female-type learners" should
take a more holistic approach to
learning how the whole computer
functions and should then try to
understand computer program
ming, Brecher said.
This different approach to
learning applies to all problem sol
ving, not just to computer

programming, Brecher said, call
ing for a new approach to educa
tion starting in elementary school
when problem solving begins. "If
there's a difference in learning
styles, we have to change our
methods of teaching," she said.
She said the two different type
of learning styles are based on
childhood patterns. Boys tend to
play games that are rule-based
such aa football or baseball. They
tend to build model airplanes
based on a set of rules, while girls
play with dolls or play games with
out rules, Brecher said.
"You can't ask why three

strikes are out." They just are,
she noted.
Although the talk was generally
well received, one audience mem
ber challenged Brecher in the
question-and-answer period,
saying he was was "offended" by
her terminology of "female-types"
and "male-types." Brecher
stressed that her language was
not based on sex, but gender.
However, Catherine Richard
son, a computer science professor
at the University of Southern Mis
sissippi, said "naming the labels
male and female is loaded."
