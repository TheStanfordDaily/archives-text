# Cowell staff miffed by Review article
## Officials deny paper's charge that center overprescribes 'morning after' drug 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
In response to a recent article in The
Stanford Review, which states that
Cowell Student Health Center encour
ages abortions through the use of a
heavy dosage of estrogen several hours
after sexual intercourse, Cowell officials
have countered that the center provides
a service but does not take a moral
stance on abortion.
An article in the November issue of
the conservative student publication
said Cowell is sidestepping ethical and
legal issues by prescribing "dangerously
high doses" of a "morning-after" pill
called Ovral.
The Review further charged that
Cowell breaks the law by prescribing
Ovral because it "has never been legally
approved by the Food and Drug Admin
istration as an abortive drug "
Ovral has been approved as a daily
birth control pill.
The article prompted Cowell's asso
ciate director to write a letter of censure
to the Review's chief editor and caused
contraceptive peer counselors to ques
tion the reporter's motives in obtaining
her information, according to Bart
Bartlett, director of Cowell's Contracep

tive Information Center.
Senior Jennifer Bryson, the author of
the half-page article, is a member of
Stanford Students for Life, an organi
zation opposed to abortion.
Ovral, manufactured and supplied by
Wyeth Laboratories in Pennsylvania,
contains a high dosage of the hormone
estrogen and is used to prevent preg
nancy in the event that a woman has
unprotected intercourse.
With the treatment, four Ovral pills
must be taken within 72 hours after
intercourse.
The high dose of estrogen, in most
cases, prevents a fertilized egg from im
planting itself into a woman's uterine
lining.
Arguing that Cowell fails to inform
women of the ethical and moral impli
cations when taking Ovral, Bryson said
her piece serves as a "medium to make
sure women make a more informed de
cision" about the oral contraceptive.
However, Bartlett said the center does
not attempt to take a moral stand on
birth control. "I want to get information
to someone so they can make their
choice," he said.
Bartlett, along with other contracep
tive information counselors and Assoc.

Director of Cowell John Dorman,
charged that the Review article contains
factual errors.
Dorman said Cowell's practices using
Ovral are not illegal because "the FDA
does not 'legally approve' drugs. Once
the FDA has approved a drug, a
physician may use it for any purpose
he/she feels medically appropriate."
Nationwide, Ovral has been used as a
morning after pill for five to eight years,
he said.
According to a consumer safety officer
at the FDA, the government's circle of
influence stops when a drug has been
approved for marketing. He said the
FDA will once again become involved
only if a patient complains about not
being properly informed before taking
a drug or if it has side-effects that were
not discussed.
Dorman, in an interview Thursday,
gave The Daily a letter addressed to
Peter Thiel, The Review's editor in
chief. Not yet delivered to Thiel, the
letter outlines the "distortions and un
truths" Dorman sees in the article as
well as "the one grain of truth in Ms.
Bryson's article."
That one grain is Bryson's point
that Ovral "may cause an abor
tion." Dorman's letter said the
treatment "does not prevent preg
nancy, if defined as the fertiliza
tion of the ovum. It does prevent
implantation of the fertilized egg,
and our literature will be changed
to further clarify that dis
crepancy."
An information sheet on Ovral,
currently provided by Cowell, says
that if the treatment fails,
"women are strongly advised to
consider a therapeutic abortion."
The Review's accusations that
Cowell is harming students by
providing the treatment are un
founded, Dorman contends in his
letter.
There are no conclusive long

term risks for women, and
damage to the fetus or to the
woman does not appear to be a
factor with Ovral, according to
Dorman.
Before taking the pill, women
must speak with a registered
nurse or doctor and read litera
ture informing them of the pos
sible hazards of the treatment.
Aside from the alleged fallacies
in The Review article highlighted
by Dorman, many of Cowell's con
traceptive peer counselors said
they were bothered that Bryson
did not identify herself as a
reporter when she met with them
to get information.
Bryson said when she talked to
counselors at Cowell she still had
not decided to write an article.
Bryson and Thiel both said they
see nothing wrong with Bryson's
reporting methods because, if she

identified herself as a reporter,
she might not be able to get the
same treatment as other women.
Bartlett said the center does not
give different information to dif
ferent people, so, "If you come in
as a representative of a publica
tion, let us know."
He said some counselors felt
used after reading the article.
Many no longer feel confident that
the information given during a
private session will be kept con
fidential, he said.
Bryson said she is planning to
pursue the matter of Cowell's Ov
ral distribution further. She said
a lawyer advised her to take her
concerns to the Board of Medical
Quality Assurance. According to
Bryson, the Sacramento-based
board fields questions of medicine
and heads investigations of med
ical programs.

board fields questions of medicine
and heads investigations of med
ical programs.
In response to a recent article in The
Stanford Review, which states that
Cowell Student Health Center encour
ages abortions through the use of a
heavy dosage of estrogen several hours
after sexual intercourse, Cowell officials
have countered that the center provides
a service but does not take a moral
stance on abortion.
An article in the November issue of
the conservative student publication
said Cowell is sidestepping ethical and
legal issues by prescribing "dangerously
high doses" of a "morning-after" pill
called Ovral.
The Review further charged that
Cowell breaks the law by prescribing
Ovral because it "has never been legally
approved by the Food and Drug Admin
istration as an abortive drug "
Ovral has been approved as a daily
birth control pill.
The article prompted Cowell's asso
ciate director to write a letter of censure
to the Review's chief editor and caused
contraceptive peer counselors to ques
tion the reporter's motives in obtaining
her information, according to Bart
Bartlett, director of Cowell's Contracep

tive Information Center.
Senior Jennifer Bryson, the author of
the half-page article, is a member of
Stanford Students for Life, an organi
zation opposed to abortion.
Ovral, manufactured and supplied by
Wyeth Laboratories in Pennsylvania,
contains a high dosage of the hormone
estrogen and is used to prevent preg
nancy in the event that a woman has
unprotected intercourse.
With the treatment, four Ovral pills
must be taken within 72 hours after
intercourse.
The high dose of estrogen, in most
cases, prevents a fertilized egg from im
planting itself into a woman's uterine
lining.
Arguing that Cowell fails to inform
women of the ethical and moral impli
cations when taking Ovral, Bryson said
her piece serves as a "medium to make
sure women make a more informed de
cision" about the oral contraceptive.
However, Bartlett said the center does
not attempt to take a moral stand on
birth control. "I want to get information
to someone so they can make their
choice," he said.
Bartlett, along with other contracep
tive information counselors and Assoc.

Director of Cowell John Dorman,
charged that the Review article contains
factual errors.
Dorman said Cowell's practices using
Ovral are not illegal because "the FDA
does not 'legally approve' drugs. Once
the FDA has approved a drug, a
physician may use it for any purpose
he/she feels medically appropriate."
Nationwide, Ovral has been used as a
morning after pill for five to eight years,
he said.
According to a consumer safety officer
at the FDA, the government's circle of
influence stops when a drug has been
approved for marketing. He said the
FDA will once again become involved
only if a patient complains about not
being properly informed before taking
a drug or if it has side-effects that were
not discussed.
Dorman, in an interview Thursday,
gave The Daily a letter addressed to
Peter Thiel, The Review's editor in
chief. Not yet delivered to Thiel, the
letter outlines the "distortions and un
truths" Dorman sees in the article as
well as "the one grain of truth in Ms.
Bryson's article."
That one grain is Bryson's point
that Ovral "may cause an abor
tion." Dorman's letter said the
treatment "does not prevent preg
nancy, if defined as the fertiliza
tion of the ovum. It does prevent
implantation of the fertilized egg,
and our literature will be changed
to further clarify that dis
crepancy."
An information sheet on Ovral,
currently provided by Cowell, says
that if the treatment fails,
"women are strongly advised to
consider a therapeutic abortion."
The Review's accusations that
Cowell is harming students by
providing the treatment are un
founded, Dorman contends in his
letter.
There are no conclusive long

term risks for women, and
damage to the fetus or to the
woman does not appear to be a
factor with Ovral, according to
Dorman.
Before taking the pill, women
must speak with a registered
nurse or doctor and read litera
ture informing them of the pos
sible hazards of the treatment.
Aside from the alleged fallacies
in The Review article highlighted
by Dorman, many of Cowell's con
traceptive peer counselors said
they were bothered that Bryson
did not identify herself as a
reporter when she met with them
to get information.
Bryson said when she talked to
counselors at Cowell she still had
not decided to write an article.
Bryson and Thiel both said they
see nothing wrong with Bryson's
reporting methods because, if she

identified herself as a reporter,
she might not be able to get the
same treatment as other women.
Bartlett said the center does not
give different information to dif
ferent people, so, "If you come in
as a representative of a publica
tion, let us know."
He said some counselors felt
used after reading the article.
Many no longer feel confident that
the information given during a
private session will be kept con
fidential, he said.
Bryson said she is planning to
pursue the matter of Cowell's Ov
ral distribution further. She said
a lawyer advised her to take her
concerns to the Board of Medical
Quality Assurance. According to
Bryson, the Sacramento-based
board fields questions of medicine
and heads investigations of med
ical programs.
