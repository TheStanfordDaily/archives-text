# Conference focuses on 'at risk' students
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
About 450 educators, public officials
and representatives of educational in
terest groups came to Stanford last
week for a conference focusing on the
need to improve the education of "at
risk" children across the nation.
At risk students, comprising about
one-third of the nation's school children,
are those who fall behind in academic
achievement because of poverty, unsta
ble families and cultural or linguistic
differences.
Approximately half never graduate
from high school. And their numbers
are growing.
"This is a very, very serious problem,"
said Education and Economics Prof.
Henry Levin, conference director.
"We're going to have to face some sub
stantial consequences from this in terms
of labor markets and cost of public serv
ices."
Held as part of the University's Cen
tennial Celebration, the conference was
jointly sponsored by the University and
the School of Education. Those attend
ing were from across the nation and
represented all levels of educational in
stitutions.
After addressing the causes of at risk
children, the conference, held Thursday
and Friday in Cubberley Auditorium,

called for a move away from remedial
education to accelerated studies.
"We need to accelerate the education
of those kids to bring them into the
educational mainstream at an early
age," he said. "The standard approach
is to try to 'fix' them — but they just
get in a crawling pace and fall farther
and farther behind."
In a paper delivered at the conference,
James Catterall, a professor of educa
tion at UCLA, and Eugene Cota-Robles,
assistant vice president for academic af
fairs at UC-Berkeley, described the mag
nitude of the dropout problem.
They said each added year of second
ary schooling reduces the probability of
welfare dependency by 35 percent. Get
ting a high school diploma reduces the
probability of having an out-of-wedlock
birth by 50 percent. And a diploma also
reduces the probability of arrest by
more than 90 percent.
Tax revenues, the cost of public as
sistance, the criminal justice system and
the nation's ability to compete interna
tionally are greatly damaged by the in
creasing number of high school
dropouts, Levin added.
Catterall's and Cota-Robles' figures
showed that the 20 million at risk
children in America include the 12.5
million who live in poverty, plus those
living above the poverty line who are
black, Latino, limited in English

proficiency or are white children in
households headed by single females.
Part of the conference focused on an
accelerated program for such students
that Levin and colleagues in the School
of Education developed last year in two
elementary schools in Redwood City and
in San Francisco. Pilot projects have
now also sprung up in Missouri and
Salt Lake City.
Using children's natural abilities to
express themselves verbally or artisti
cally and to learn through hands on
projects, the programs aim to bring
educationally disadvantaged children up
to grade level achievement by the sixth
grade.
Increased parent participation, coop
erative learning strategies and after
school programs are also components of
the accelerated school project.
Levin said the presentation of the
project and the conference were timed
to coincide with the recent elections in
the hope that the discussion would at
tract the attention of new public officials
about to take office across the country.
Levin added that he was "very
pleased" with the outcome of the con
ference and said the attendance could
have quadrupled if larger facilities had
been available.
"There was a lot of enthusiasm. I
think we might see some things move
forward on a national basis," he said.
