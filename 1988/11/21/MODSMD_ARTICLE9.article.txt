# Updike enthralls crowd with his story readings

### Amy Rosenfeld Senior staff writer 
Pulitzer prize winning author John
Updike captivated a standing room only
crowd in Annenberg Auditorium Friday
afternoon with readings and bits of wis
dom from his prolific 30-year career.
Referring to Big Game weekend, Up
dike thanked the mostly student audi
ence for coming on a day that was "full
of excitement of all kinds that make this
particular excitement seem fairly pallid."
However, the author's readings and
answers to audience questions were far
from dull.
Updike described two short stories
from his latest collection "Trust Me" as
having "some glimmer of the theme of
betrayed, undeserved trust."
The first, "The Lovely Troubled
Daughters of Our Old Crowd," was a
monologue by the father of one of five
young women returning to live alone in
the town in which they and their families
grew up and grew apart.
"We were all so young, parents and
children, learning it ail together — how

to grow up, how to deal with time.
Updike read, bringing his characters to
life in Annenberg.
For his second story, Updike trans
ported the audience to an attic where a
newly divorced couple and their two sons
come across old board games, which are
maybe "Still of Some Use" — the title
of the story.
"Their lives had touched these tokens
and counters once; excitement had
flowed along the paths of these stylized
landscapes. But the day was gone, and
scarcely a memory remained."
After about an hour of readings, Up
dike answered questions from the crowd
about everything from his golf game,
which he said has "reached a certain
fascinating plateau of mediocrity," to the
explicit sex in some of his novels. "Any
thing that's in a novel should be explicit
rather than vague," he said.
Updike told of an author's life and
his involvement in his characters' lives.
"You return each day to a little island
that you are building a few pages at a
time and you become very much a part
time citizen of that island," he said.
