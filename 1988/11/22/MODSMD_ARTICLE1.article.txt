# China abridges student visas, forcing return
## 
### Baldwin Lee 
To combat fears of a national "brain drain," the
People's Republic of China is forcing students abroad
to return to China. The government's move might
force several Stanford students to leave here abrupt
ly, regardless of the extent of their studies.
Believing too many Chinese might not return
from their studies abroad, the Chinese government
is enforcing tighter visa restrictions on its students.
Last spring, the government released a list of 300
Chinese students in the United States who had
soon-to-expire J-l visas. The Chinese government
asked that the United States require the students
to return home, according to Marvin Baron, foreign
student adviser at UC-Berkeley. China has set es
pecially strict visa guidelines including a five-year
expiration date on all J-l visas.
In addition, the government is attempting to clas
sify all students who have received financial aid
from the Chinese government under the J-l visa.
A recent San Jose Mercury News article predicted
that the government's actions might force home as
many as 5,000 Chinese students studying in the
United States. But Marcia Makino, Stanford's
foreign student adviser, said it is impossible to es
timate how many students will be affected by the
government's policy because it has yet to be applied
to a student.
She added that the effect on Stanford's 148 Chi
nese students remains unclear.
Downplaying the Mercury News' prediction,
Makino, who was in China just last month, said
she could not predict whether the Chinese govern
ment would enforce the policy strictly.
While in China, Makino asked officials there about
governmental enforcement of the new visa policy.
"When we asked about this, the officials said yes,
there were the rules, but if a student needed more
time (to finish studies or research) he would not
be jerked away."
No Stanford students have contacted Makino
about the expiration of their J-l visas and the
possible effects of the governmental restrictions.
However, Makino said she believed that some stu
dents' visas would expire within the next year.
Fearing that the Chinese Consulate might take
action against them, Stanford students from China
are refusing to comment on the Chinese govern
ment's policies. The consulate is located in San
Francisco.
Edward Lau, an attorney representing several
students on the Chinese government's list, was un
available for comment.
A representative from the consulate said the office
is not responsible for enforcing immigration policy.
"We do nothing. We know nothing (regarding im
migration policies). That's all U.S. government."
The consulate representative refused to elaborate
further.
In regards to the U.S. government's stance, Baron
said a U.S. Immigration Agency official would arrive
in San Francisco tomorrow for a conference that
should clarify the U.S. role.
The Immigration Agency has the final say in the
status of foreign students. The agency has acknowl
edged that they received the Chinese government's
list of 300 students.
Baron said he has spoken with an immigration
official who told him that the U.S. government
would not take the 300-person list at "face value"
and send the students home.
