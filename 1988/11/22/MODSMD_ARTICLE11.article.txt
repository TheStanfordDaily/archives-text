# Marguerite changes welcomed
## 
### Maryellen Driscoll 
As of Jan. 1, Marguerite bus
routes will be altered in order to
better serve commuters to
campus.
During commute hours, the
Marguerite will travel to campus
from the CalTrain stations on
University Avenue and California
Avenue without driving down
Palm Drive and around as much
of campus as it now does. The
normal route, which circles
campus, will resume between
commuter hours.
The University wants "to make
(Marguerite) a commuter service
rather than an on-campus serv
ice," said Roland Home, chair of
the Committee on Parking and
Transportation.
The new schedule is also de

signed to improve service to Es
condido Village, whose residents
comprise two-thirds of the Mar
guerite riders.
Jeff Erickson, an Escondido res
ident, said because the nearest Es
condido stop is currently too far
from his residence, "it takes
longer often to take the Margue
rite (than biking) . .. sometimes
a half hour."
Plans for the new schedule were
presented during yesterday's CPT
public meeting.
University officials also pre
sented plans for renovating the
near West Campus over the next
10 years. According to Susan Cal
deron, project manager of Facili
ties Project Management, the
section of Serra Street by many
of the biology and engineering
buildings will eventually be closed

to traffic making it "an exciting
region, a pedestrian region ... like
the feeling of the Quad."
Calderon speculated that some
buildings near the Physics Tank
will be torn down along with some
nearby engineering labs. In addi
tion, she said that there would bo
additional new offices at the Cen
ter for Integrated Systems.
Plans for a new parking struc
ture near Panama Street and For*
sythe Hall were also presented.
The structure will provide for "A"
and "C" lot parking and m#Â» f cr
parking. Lewis Darrow, a project
manager of Facilities Project
Management, said each individual
parking space will cost the Uni
versity $12,500. Construction is
expected to be completed in
March.
