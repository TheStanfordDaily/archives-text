## Mulroney wins majority in Canada Conservatives get enough House seats to save free trade agreement 
### 
TORONTO (AP) - Prime Min
ister Brian Mulroney and his Con
servative Party won the House of
Commons majority needed to save
the free trade agreement with the
United States, the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp. projected last
night. ,
The projection at about 8:40
p.m. EST, before the polls closed
in western Canada, had Conser
vatives leading for 107 of the 295
seats in the Commons.
John Turner's opposition
Liberals, who fiercely attacked the
trade pact, were leading for 71
seats, and the socialist New
Democratic Party of Ed Broad

bent, which also opposed the ac
cord, was ahead in 12 races.
Conservatives were expected to
do well in the Western districts,
which were not included in the
projections.
They had a jittery start in the
four Atlantic Maritime provinces,
but did well enough in central
Quebec and Ontario to get at least
the 148 seats necessary for a
majority, according to the CBC
projection.
President Reagan and Mulroney
signed the free trade agreement
last Jan. 2 and Mulroney needed
a majority in the Commons to
keep it alive. The U.S. Congress

has approved the pact, but Par
liament has yet to do so.
The plan is to take effect Jan.
1, 1989 and phase out remaining
tariffs over the next 10 years be
tween Canada and the United
States, whose two-way trade is
worth $150 billion a year.
Mulroney was buoyed in the
last days by polls that showed his
party back in the lead with a
chance at a majority. He told
reporters he would convene Par
liament quickly to act on the trade
deal.
He led the Conservatives to a
smashing victory in 1984 that
gave them 210 of the 282 seats,

but no party has won two succes
sive msyorities in Canada since
1953.
Turner used a weekend rally to
repeat his plea that voters "keep
Canada Canadian for Canadians"
and kill the agreement by voting
for his party.
Mulroney spent the last cam
paign weekend in his native
Quebec, the huge French
speaking province that has 75 of
the 295 seats in the Commons.
Turner hoped for a big score in
the 99 seats of Ontario, a pre
dominantly English-speaking
province where opposition to the
agreement was strongest.
