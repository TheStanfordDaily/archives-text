# North trial waits for Reagan's decision
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The judge in the
Iran-Contra case appealed yesterday for Pres
ident Reagan to decide once and for all whether
to let Oliver North stand trial and thereby
risk the disclosure of national security secrets.
U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell warned
that if the former White House aide went to
trial, probably in late January, the court would
have "very little control" over the testimony
of many witnesses "acquainted with high
security matters."
The judge invited a final administration

decision on the problem, noting the dangers
posed by public questioning of current and
former government officials who will be called
to testify as prosecution witnesses.
Gesell was not suggesting, as some of
North's supporters have, that the president
consider pardoning North before he even goes
to trial. Rather, the judge was referring to
the president's discretion as the nation's chief
law enforcement officer, either to directly or
der that the case be dropped or by invoking
secrecy laws to prevent disclosure of classified

information — which could have the same
effect.
Reagan, at a ground-breaking ceremony for
his presidential library at Simi Valley, Calif.,
meanwhile, was asked if he had made a de
cision on whether to pardon North.
The president replied: "No, and I don't think
it would be any time to make such a decision
while it's still before the courts."
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said, "The president believes the legal process
should take its course."
