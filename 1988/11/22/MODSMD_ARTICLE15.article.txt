# Carter, Ford urge deficit cuts

WASHINGTON (AP) -
Former Presidents Carter and
Ford said in a report yesterday
that the federal budget deficit, the
No. 1 problem facing President
elect George Bush, could be
reduced by cutting spending and
raising taxes on motor fuel, beer,
wine and cigarettes.
The ex-presidents said they
went over the report with Bush,
though they wouldn't give details
of their meeting with him at the
Old Executive Office Building ad
jacent to the White House. They

said he listened to them attentive
ly-
While Bush says his economics
team will move swiftly to tackle
deficits once he takes office Jan.
20, he has promised not to raise
taxes. Asked by reporters about
the report's proposal to increase
excise taxes, he replied the ex
presidents "didn't mention that to
me."
Carter and Ford were the co
chairmen of a bipartisan group
that wrote the report, titled
"American Agenda." Some 340 ex

perts, including former Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger and
former Treasury Secretary Mi
chael Blumenthal, contributed to
what Ford called "a full platter
of recommendations."
During the presidential cam
paign, Bush occasionally derided
the most recent Democratic ad
ministration, presided over by
Carter. But Carter said Monday
he felt no bitterness toward Bush
or other Republicans.
"Now is a time of healing," he
said.
