# Parliament storms into session

### 
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel's
12th parliament opened yesterday
with fiery exchanges between po
litical rivals and a plea from Pres
ident Chaim Herzog to save the
institution "from the weakening
of its foundations."
Fifteen members initially
refused to take the oath of office
â– from a representative of the ex
treme right, dramatizing their op
position to his party's advocacy

of expelling Arabs from the occu
pied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
About 1,000 Israelis, most of
them teen-agers, demonstrated
outside against demands by ultra-
Orthodox religious parties that
only conversions to Judaism by
Orthodox rabbis be recognized.
In the atmosphere of sharp di
vision, Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir continued seeking a
broadly based coalition including

the rival Labor Party of Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres.
Likud won 40 seats in the 120-
member Knesset, or parliament,
in the Nov. 1 elections and Labor
got 39.
Israeli media quoted Shamir as
saying "the chances of forming a
broad government are close to
nil," but his spokesman Yossi
Ahimeir said the question re
mained open.
