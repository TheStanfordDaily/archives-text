## Women on the move 
### 
The Women's Center
needs more centrally
located office space

THE WOMEN'S CENTER
would like to say it's on the
move, unfortunately it is un
able to do so.
Located amidst the Toyon
Eating Clubs, it is likely that for
most members of the Stanford
community the center's location is
a mystery.
In order to alleviate that prob
lem, Sarah Bryer, the center's co
ordinator would like to move to a
location nearer to the middle of
campus, say Old Union. "[We're]
far away from the constituency
we're trying to reach," she says.
Bryer correctly notes that other
community centers, such as those
for the Chicano/Latino, black, and
lesbian, gay and bisexual commu
nities all have central campus lo
cations in or around Old Union.
The center works to serve as a
resource and referral center for
women in a number of areas. There
are job listings for women, a library
of books on women's issues and
space for women's events.
In addition, the vital Rape Ed
ucation Project, Students Against
Sexism and the Women's Self De
fense Collective all work out of the
center.
They are the kind of services
one might use on a drop-in basis.
The average student, however, is
unlikely to drop by the Eating
Clubs all that often. That same
student would be hard pressed to

go more than a day or two without
visiting White Plaza — and thereby
passing Old Union.
Student Organization Services
coordinator Michael Ramsey-Perez
says the center could be moved to
a central location within two years,
though he won't guarantee an Old
Union address.
Still, a two-year timetable and
lack of definite promise on the
issue underlie a deeper problem —
the University seems disinterested
about the concerns of the Women's
Center.
As Bryer says, the inaction on
the move "says something about
University priorities on these is
sues."
She also notes that while the
ethnic community centers have ad
ministrators like assistant deans
working with them, she is the
women's center's only paid staffer
— and her position is funded for
only 15 hours a week.
When Bryer tries to visit the
other centers to engage in network
ing and resouce sharing she is often
forced to close up shop at the Wom
en's Center — making it completely
unavailable — and go halfway
across campus.
In Old Union, El Centro Chicano
would be a next door neighbor.
Sadly, leaving the center in the
Eating Clubs, on the fringe of
campus activity, sends a subtle
message that the issues the center
works to address aren't that im
portant on the campus.
In light of the way the recent
racial incidents on campus have
heightened awareness and sensitiv
ity to minority concerns, that's a
message that simply shouldn't be
sent.
