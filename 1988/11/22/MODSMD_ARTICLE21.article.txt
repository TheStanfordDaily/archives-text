## Policy: national service 
### 
"Costs for public and private colleges have
far outstripped the growth in family in
come and in federal support for higher
education."
— Democratic Leadership Council
THE TWOFOLD PURPOSE and
promise of the American dream is
to provide to all people personal
success in the hope and trust that they
will become thereby of greater service to
the public. America has defaulted on both
counts.
When the gap between the rich and
poor is widening, when college enrollment
from low-income and minority families
is dropping, when the ranks of the home
less are swelling, when 17 million adults
are functionally illiterate, the American
dream crumbles.
We must instill an ethic of service in
the "me" generation, we must empower
the "forgotten half," of our society. We
must implement national service.
National service proposals come in
many forms — from modest bills to ex
pand existing community service efforts
to sweeping measures designed to create
a national service infrastructure. In this
column, I shall focus on the latter. The
most grandiose proposal to date has been
the Citizen Corps program, set forth by
the Democratic Leadership Council.
The blueprint of the Citizen Corps goes
as follows — in return for one or two
years' work at subsistence wages in either
civilian or military service, young enlis
tees would earn vouchers worth $10,000
($12,000 for military service), which
could be used to reduce college expenses,

finance vocational training or make a
down-payment on a home.
While the focus is on youth service,
the Citizen Corps will also enlist a limited
number of senior citizens to work at
modest hourly wages ($4-$5). The esti
mated cost to Washington of a full-blown
Citizen Corps with 800,000 volunteers is
$5.3 billion. In order to defray the federal
cost, existing financial aid programs —
such as Perkins loans, guaranteed student
loans, college work study — would be
phased out as national service is phased
in.
The beauty of the Citizen Corps is that
the returns significantly outweigh the
costs. Consider the awesome impact of
800,000 volunteers: extended child care,
extended senior citizen care, better
housing, cleaner parks, safer streets,
fewer illiterate citizens, a stronger and
more diverse military. And the list goes
on.
I challenge those who are against na
tional service to first do community serv
ice work — to help the illiterate, the
poor, and the hungry. For if you have
never tutored a twice-held-back Hispanic
fourth grader in English, never seen the
conditions of poverty up close, never
delivered food to families in need, then
you will never understand the moral ur
gency of implementing a Citizen Corps.
You will never feel the frustration of
realizing that if only more people tutored,
if only more people became teachers, if
only more people knew, illiteracy would
cease to be a problem.
Although the benefits of the Corps are
overwhelming, critics charge that $5.3

billion is an unreasonable amount, espe
cially in a time of budget restraint and
deficit reduction. This charge itself is
unreasonable. In a trillion-dollar federal
budget, there are countless ways to
achieve annual savings of $5.3 billion.
Consider: limiting the amount of de
ductible expenses for business meals and
entertainment from 80' to 50 percent will
save, over a five year period, $18.4 billion.
Consider: in a 580 ship navy, three Aegis
destroyers cost $2.13 billion. Given the
political will, sufficient resources can be
freed to finance the Citizen Corps.
Because we have the resources to make
10,000 points of light a reality, not a
campaign theme; to prevent social ills
before the fact, not after; to make higher
education a right, not a privilege; we
have a duty to implement national serv
ice. We have a duty to restore the Amer
ican dream.

Because we have the resources to make
10,000 points of light a reality, not a

ican dream.

Ted Lieu is a sophomore in computer
science and political science. His column

the first in a two-part series on national
service.


We must implement na
