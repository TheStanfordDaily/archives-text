## Both men and women are affected by eating disorders 
### 
IN RESPONSE to the Nov. 14
column "When diets become dead
ly," I would like to agree with the
statement that "too many readers
know exactly what I am talking
about."
In my dorm, I have yet to find one
girl who is content with her body, or
even not obsessively aware of how
many calories she has eaten that day. I
too feel that I fall into the category of
people who have "a dangerous relation
ship with food." Unfortunately, many
people who do, don't realize it or
aren't able to admit it.
My only disagreement with the
column was that it failed to address a
significant portion of people with
eating disorders: MEN.
It may come as a surprise to many
people just how many men are overly
concerned with their weight. Just go to

Encina or Roble weight rooms during
dinner and count how many men you
see working out instead of eating. Or
just talk to the men around your dorm
and see how many feel that they are
at an ideal weight. I'm not saying that
all these men have eating disorders,
but many at least have a dangerous
relationship with food.
Society doesn't just put pressure on
women to be thin; men must be thin
and muscular too. Imagine trying to
attain most men's "ideal" image: male
athletes like Carl Lewis.
Add to that the fact that in our
society those underlying problems that
drive most women to food are also
problems men have, but men aren't
supposed to show their feelings: it's a
sign of weakness.
Going to the weight room, running
or binging and purging — yes, men do

it too — appear to many men as the
only acceptable, however inneffective,
solution. How many men have you
seen eat a huge meal and then won
dered to yourself, "how does he stay so
slim?"
The group "Body Image, Food and
Self-Esteem" was formerly "Women,
Self-image and Food," and it is a
credit to the group and its realistic
view of the situation here on campus
that the name was changed.
The group came to my dorm to
speak and had a decent turnout,
though mostly women. I think that it's
necessary for each individual dorm to
form some sort of discussion group,
not necessarily focusing on eating
disorders, but on the everyday prob
lems that each and every person has.
Focusing on "eating disorders" tends
to scare people off because they either

haven't admitted it to themselves that
they have a problem — it really is
frightening to recognize a problem
within yourself — or they just don't
know they have a problem. Many men
also feel that they would feel out of
place since, for a long time, eating
disorders have mistakenly been labeled
by society as a disease exclusive to
women.
The attitudes of society towards
equating beauty with thinness need to
be changed, but that cannot happen
until both sexes recognize the inac
curacy of the equation and we under
stand the pressures each sex puts on
the other. Maybe if more men attended
these meetings, they would see that
they, like the women with eating disor
ders, are not alone.
