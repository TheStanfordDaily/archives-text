# Halftime events remain a mystery
## 
### 
We, the Immoral Twenty-two and
Friends, do hereby submit this state
ment that we take absolutely no re
sponsibility for the events occurring at
halftime of the Big Game.
We did not smuggle a smoke grenade
into the stadium inside of an empty
Coke can, nor did we sneak an RC-1/10
Traxxas High-Performance Off-Road
Racer right under the noses of Cal
Security.
We had nothing to do with slipping
the car onto the field undetected, and
we most certainly did NOT pilot it by
remote from the thirty-fifth row, en
gulfing the Cal Marching Band in bil
lowing clouds of yellow smoke.
In fact, we think the whole scheme

reproachful, and we hope that you will
in no way glorify it by printing ac
counts of Saturday's actions in The
Daily.
We thank you for joining us in our
attempt to ensure that terrorist acts
like these will not happen again. Ever.
The Immoral Twenty-two
