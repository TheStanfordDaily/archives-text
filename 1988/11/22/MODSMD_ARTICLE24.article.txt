# Axe Committee did not give up early
## 
### 
There seemed to be much confusion
over the Axe in the last few minutes
of the Big Game on Saturday, so I
think I should make some clarifica
tions.
First, the Axe belongs to the team
that wins the game.
If there is a tie, then the team that
last won the game (in this case Stan
ford) retains possession of the Axe.
Second, there seemed to be some
talk that the Axe Commitee was giving
up the game as lost because we walked
over to face the UC Rally Committee.
THIS IS MOST CERTAINLY NOT
THE CASE.
In the agreement by which the Axe

became the trophy of the Big Game, it
specifically states that the Axe shall be
transferred immediately as the game is
decided.
There is an established tradition that
the committees meet at the designated
transfer point, and if within two
minutes of the end of the game there
is any chance of an exchange, we must
walk toward their side.
We would have walked over even had
we been leading by 7 points, because
there would still be a chance they
could win.
I am truly sorry that this offends
anyone, but these rules were followed
in order to limit confusion on the Held
after the game.
We are certainly open to suggestions
for doing this better while adhering to
the general rules of the Axe Trophy.
