: The following article is par
tially reprinted from a special
edition of The Daily which was
distributed in the afternoon of
Nov. 22, 1963.

Friday noon on the Quad,
and, like any day at noon, the
Quad is almost empty. A boy
wearing a red and white Stan
ford jacket stands at Engineer
ing Corner. He pulls a "Beat
Cal" pin from his jacket, and
throws it to the ground.
• Another student approaches
him, "Have you heard?" "Yes,
I've heard." The two walk on
silently. The "Beat Cal" pin lies
• on the ground.
The President of the nation
is dead, and Stanford, a uni-'
versity whose daily life has
; little direct relation to the ac
tions of men in Washington, is
part of the nation. In a moment
: of great shock and disbelief
comes the realization that
America, a conglomeration of
peoples of vastly different
beliefs, interests, goals, and
daily lives, is one.
THE REACTION of the na
tion as a whole is paralleled in
the groups of silent; subdued
students crowded around tele
vision sets in dormitory living
rooms, listening to the latest
news bulletins. I
Tresidder is packed; a group
of about 40 people stand in
front of the television set. The
conversations at the tables
revolve around one topic and
the tone is everywhere the
same. "I don't believe it," is
the most common remark.
"How?" one girl asks, "it can't
be real."
But it is real, and with the
first reaction of stunned dis
belief and shock comes a fear
of the unknown future. "What
•' now?" a student questions.
"Civil rights?" "And Johnson's
from Texas," a girl answers.
"But he's president now, and
the office does mean some
thing," the boy responds.
"JOHNSON'S AN UN
KNOWN to me," a woman
says. "Kennedy, at least, is —

was," she corrects the tense of
the verb, but does not finish
her sentence.
Again and again the same
words, "How?" "What now?"
... "Who could have believed
it?" and the response, "Who
can believe it now?"
Two professors eating lunch
in the Old Union dining room
look at the reporter for a mo
ment, shake their heads, "No
comment, I don't have any
thing to say."
"We feel like we're in a coun
try as stable as South Viet
nam," a hasher in the dining
room comments. A janitor stops
sweeping and remains silent for
a moment, "I feel pretty bad
... all the good he's done ...
and his family. I sympathize
with his family."
A FEW STUDENTS ques
tion each other, "They'll call
off Big Game, won't they?"
"How could they go ahead with
it?" And a Sigma Chi member
leaves the Dean of Men's office
on his way to his fraternity to
begin tearing down house
decorations.
And yet, perhaps because it
is a truism, the cliche that life
does go on regardless persists.
The nation may mourn, but
the daily routine does not stop.
The workmen in front of the
Post Office continue laying
bricks; students stand in long
lines in front of the registration
office in order to pre-register
for winter quarter classes.
"How can all this still matter?"
one girl questions. But no one
leaves the line.
If the routine does go on, it
goes on with a subdued air.
Few people laugh. "I feel funny
just smiling," one girl says.
The reporter leaves the
building and crosses Union
Courtyard. A girl passes by. She
carries her time schedule and
pre-registration cards. On the
arm of her jacket she has
pinned a black band of mourn
ing.
A girl seated on a bench tells
the reporter, "I just don't feel
as though I know anything any
more. But at least there's
that." She is looking at the
black band of mourning.

it?" And a Sigma Chi member
leaves the Dean of Men's office
on his way to his fraternity to
begin tearing down house
decorations.
And yet, perhaps because it
is a truism, the cliche that life
does go on regardless persists.
The nation may mourn, but
the daily routine does not stop.
The workmen in front of the
Post Office continue laying
bricks; students stand in long
lines in front of the registration
office in order to pre-register
for winter quarter classes.
"How can all this still matter?"
one girl questions. But no one
leaves the line.
If the routine does go on, it
goes on with a subdued air.
Few people laugh. "I feel funny
just smiling," one girl says.
The reporter leaves the
building and crosses Union
Courtyard. A girl passes by. She
carries her time schedule and
pre-registration cards. On the
arm of her jacket she has
pinned a black band of mourn
ing.
A girl seated on a bench tells
the reporter, "I just don't feel
as though I know anything any
more. But at least there's
that." She is looking at the
black band of mourning.
