# Remembering A Day of Mourning

"The one thing that's certain after the Ken
nedy assassination is that things were never
the same." This assessment, by Sociology Prof.
Sanford Dornbusch of the historical signifi
cance of President Kennedy's death, aptly cap
tures the shocked disbelief and fear for the
future evident at Stanford in the days follow
ing the President's death.
On November 22, 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald
took the life of President John F. Kennedy as
he rode through the streets of Dallas. As the
news spread across the country, citizens
reacted with shock and outrage, and the stu
dents, faculty and staff of Stanford University
were no exception.
Soon after word of the President's serious
wounding reached Stanford, teachers dis
missed their classes, and everyone flocked to
watch the unfolding drama on television.
With Kennedy's death confirmed, conspir
acy theories abounding, and an unfamiliar
President sworn in, Stanford joined the the
rest of the nation and looked back with sorrow
upon the leader they had lost and to the
uncertain future of the days to come.
In some sense, Stanford could lay claim to
Kennedy. After Harvard, where he had spent
his undergraduate years, the President called
Stanford his second alma mater. In the fall
of 1940, Kennedy came to Palo Alto to audit
courses at the Stanford Business School and
with appropriate portent, in the Political Sci
ence Department.
Although he studied at Stanford only one
quarter, he invoked his brief tenure to enlist
the support of Stanford students during a
campus campaign stop during the 1960 Demo
cratic primary campaign.
In accordance with the Stanford political
tradition of supporting the losing national
candidate, Nixon carried the campus while
Kennedy found the country's favor.
While unsuccessful in his bid to stir Stan
ford's loyalty in 1960, Kennedy posthumously
reaped the devotion that had earlier eluded
him. His death elicited, almost without excep
tion, extreme disbelief and sorrow.
American Studies Visiting Associate Prof.
Richard Gillam, then a student in the
Stanford-in-Germany program, recalls the re
action of his peers abroad as they listened to
American news reports. "Shock is scarcely a
sufficient word ... an enormously emotional
response was characteristic of most students."
English Prof. Arturo Islas, then a graduate
student, recalls hearing the news in his show
er, as the first frantic bulletins — bracketed
by radio silence — incorrectly reported both
Kennedy and Johnson had been shot. Accord
ing to Islas the news hit "like a bomb."
When he arrived on campus, later that af
ternoon, he was struck by the mood. "Ire

member mostly the silence, unbelievable
silence." Wherever Stanford's students fol
lowed the day's events, Islas observed "dis
belief," as if "everyone were waiting to hear
that it was a joke ... It was awful in the
great sense of that word."
Political Science Prof. Charles Drekmeier
heard the President had been shot before he
began his lecture on Montesquieu that morn
ing. After one of his teaching assistants, who
had a portable radio with him, reported the
gravity of Kennedy's condition, Drekmeier
canceled his lecture.
Reconsidering the day's events, he says,"it
was an anomalous experience for me. I was
expecting to be interrupted by the appearance
of Oski ... I suppose I was thinking more
about the expectations of the proper behavior
of a Stanford professor confronted by an emer
gency than I was about the historical mo
ment."

25 YEARS
LATER

Dornbusch recalls that among members of
the Stanford community, "there was a lot of
crying, a lot of disbelief. .. . They just couldn't
believe the first news. It was too shocking to
quickly assimilate."
Dornbusch, Drekmeier and former faculty
member Otis Pease, now a member of the
Trustees, addressed a gathering of students
in order to issue "a kind of reassurance that
life goes on," according to Drekmeier.
He remembers his own speech drew upon
the rhetoric of Thomas Hobbes. "How is it
possible that we are able to continue as a
species when any one person can do so much
wrong — and when each of us seems capable
of doing so little good? And yet the good we
do, collectively, can manage to meet the chal
lenge of the destruction of the few."
Big Game, along with all other sporting
events, was postponed. When the Game actu
ally took place a week late, before a large
crowd in Stanford Stadium, the Stanford Band
unveiled its new interpretative version of the
Star Spangled Banner, now regularly per
formed.
According to Islas, the Band's rendition left
many in the stands crying as it evoked the
late President's memory.
Islas remarks, "What he did bring to the
office — what historians won't talk about —

is his appeal to youth." Ventures Craig: "[Ken
nedy] may have been the last political hero
for the younger generation."
Clearly, the Kennedy appeal rested upon
more than the President's youth and glamor.
As Craig's comment implies, students tended
to associate President Kennedy with the
idealistic causes they supported.
Islas describes a more general sense of ex
citement and optimism in the Kennedy
presidency. "There was just something about
the Kennedys that woke people up . . . One
felt hopeful. .. . However the facts would turn
out, he gave people hope — for good or ill."
The morbid novelty of the assassination of
a president and a more general sense of in
nocence may have contributed to the extreme
grief felt on campus and around the country
at Kennedy's death. According to Drekmeier,
"the only thing that had happened to get
people really concerned [in the 1960's] was
the civil rights movement. . . . Stanford un
dergraduates lived in a dream world, where
nothing awful could happen."
History Emeritus Prof. John Johnson re
marks that, "the generation in the early '60s
had forgotten World War II and the earlier
problems." Perhaps most importantly, no his
tory of assassination had hardened people,
particularly idealistic students, to the loss of
their leaders, as the assassinations of the late
1960s did.
"(Assassinations were) simply not part of
the national experience [in 1963J," says Gil
lam.
Although those who witnessed Stanford's
reaction to the assassination may disagree on
the lessons imparted by such an event, they
draw similar conclusions about the killing's
impact on the students of the day. "Political
naivete died then . . . there was a sense of
youth betrayed," says Islas.
Gillam says the "Kennedy myth" conveys
a message of "pervasive pessimism" that pro
motes the idea that "this is the way things
were once, and [they] will not be that way
again." He disagrees with the public's percep
tion of the assassination as marking the
"death of a time."
Whatever the final legacy of Kennedy's as
sassination for Stanford students, Drekmeier's
recollection of his own reaction, as he walked
across White Plaza to address students on the
topic of Kennedy's death, captures the mood
on campus 25 years ago today.
"Perhaps my most vigorous memory ... is
the tolling of the Hoover bells. They weren't
really belTs, of course — just a low carillon
note at an interval of several seconds. A dirge.
My feet followed the pattern, despite myself.
I wanted that moment to last forever. Because
I had no idea what I would say to Stanford
freshmen."

ternoon, he was struck by the mood. "Ire

member mostly the silence, unbelievable
silence." Wherever Stanford's students fol
lowed the day's events, Islas observed "dis
belief," as if "everyone were waiting to hear
that it was a joke ... It was awful in the
great sense of that word."
Political Science Prof. Charles Drekmeier
heard the President had been shot before he
began his lecture on Montesquieu that morn
ing. After one of his teaching assistants, who
had a portable radio with him, reported the
gravity of Kennedy's condition, Drekmeier
canceled his lecture.
Reconsidering the day's events, he says,"it
was an anomalous experience for me. I was
expecting to be interrupted by the appearance
of Oski ... I suppose I was thinking more
about the expectations of the proper behavior
of a Stanford professor confronted by an emer
gency than I was about the historical mo
ment."

25 YEARS
LATER

Dornbusch recalls that among members of
the Stanford community, "there was a lot of
crying, a lot of disbelief. .. . They just couldn't
believe the first news. It was too shocking to
quickly assimilate."
Dornbusch, Drekmeier and former faculty
member Otis Pease, now a member of the
Trustees, addressed a gathering of students
in order to issue "a kind of reassurance that
life goes on," according to Drekmeier.
He remembers his own speech drew upon
the rhetoric of Thomas Hobbes. "How is it
possible that we are able to continue as a
species when any one person can do so much
wrong — and when each of us seems capable
of doing so little good? And yet the good we
do, collectively, can manage to meet the chal
lenge of the destruction of the few."
Big Game, along with all other sporting
events, was postponed. When the Game actu
ally took place a week late, before a large
crowd in Stanford Stadium, the Stanford Band
unveiled its new interpretative version of the
Star Spangled Banner, now regularly per
formed.
According to Islas, the Band's rendition left
many in the stands crying as it evoked the
late President's memory.
Islas remarks, "What he did bring to the
office — what historians won't talk about —

is his appeal to youth." Ventures Craig: "[Ken
nedy] may have been the last political hero
for the younger generation."
Clearly, the Kennedy appeal rested upon
more than the President's youth and glamor.
As Craig's comment implies, students tended
to associate President Kennedy with the
idealistic causes they supported.
Islas describes a more general sense of ex
citement and optimism in the Kennedy
presidency. "There was just something about
the Kennedys that woke people up . . . One
felt hopeful. .. . However the facts would turn
out, he gave people hope — for good or ill."
The morbid novelty of the assassination of
a president and a more general sense of in
nocence may have contributed to the extreme
grief felt on campus and around the country
at Kennedy's death. According to Drekmeier,
"the only thing that had happened to get
people really concerned [in the 1960's] was
the civil rights movement. . . . Stanford un
dergraduates lived in a dream world, where
nothing awful could happen."
History Emeritus Prof. John Johnson re
marks that, "the generation in the early '60s
had forgotten World War II and the earlier
problems." Perhaps most importantly, no his
tory of assassination had hardened people,
particularly idealistic students, to the loss of
their leaders, as the assassinations of the late
1960s did.
"(Assassinations were) simply not part of
the national experience [in 1963J," says Gil
lam.
Although those who witnessed Stanford's
reaction to the assassination may disagree on
the lessons imparted by such an event, they
draw similar conclusions about the killing's
impact on the students of the day. "Political
naivete died then . . . there was a sense of
youth betrayed," says Islas.
Gillam says the "Kennedy myth" conveys
a message of "pervasive pessimism" that pro
motes the idea that "this is the way things
were once, and [they] will not be that way
again." He disagrees with the public's percep
tion of the assassination as marking the
"death of a time."
Whatever the final legacy of Kennedy's as
sassination for Stanford students, Drekmeier's
recollection of his own reaction, as he walked
across White Plaza to address students on the
topic of Kennedy's death, captures the mood
on campus 25 years ago today.
"Perhaps my most vigorous memory ... is
the tolling of the Hoover bells. They weren't
really belTs, of course — just a low carillon
note at an interval of several seconds. A dirge.
My feet followed the pattern, despite myself.
I wanted that moment to last forever. Because
I had no idea what I would say to Stanford
freshmen."
"The one thing that's certain after the Ken
nedy assassination is that things were never
the same." This assessment, by Sociology Prof.
Sanford Dornbusch of the historical signifi
cance of President Kennedy's death, aptly cap
tures the shocked disbelief and fear for the
future evident at Stanford in the days follow
ing the President's death.
On November 22, 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald
took the life of President John F. Kennedy as
he rode through the streets of Dallas. As the
news spread across the country, citizens
reacted with shock and outrage, and the stu
dents, faculty and staff of Stanford University
were no exception.
Soon after word of the President's serious
wounding reached Stanford, teachers dis
missed their classes, and everyone flocked to
watch the unfolding drama on television.
With Kennedy's death confirmed, conspir
acy theories abounding, and an unfamiliar
President sworn in, Stanford joined the the
rest of the nation and looked back with sorrow
upon the leader they had lost and to the
uncertain future of the days to come.
In some sense, Stanford could lay claim to
Kennedy. After Harvard, where he had spent
his undergraduate years, the President called
Stanford his second alma mater. In the fall
of 1940, Kennedy came to Palo Alto to audit
courses at the Stanford Business School and
with appropriate portent, in the Political Sci
ence Department.
Although he studied at Stanford only one
quarter, he invoked his brief tenure to enlist
the support of Stanford students during a
campus campaign stop during the 1960 Demo
cratic primary campaign.
In accordance with the Stanford political
tradition of supporting the losing national
candidate, Nixon carried the campus while
Kennedy found the country's favor.
While unsuccessful in his bid to stir Stan
ford's loyalty in 1960, Kennedy posthumously
reaped the devotion that had earlier eluded
him. His death elicited, almost without excep
tion, extreme disbelief and sorrow.
American Studies Visiting Associate Prof.
Richard Gillam, then a student in the
Stanford-in-Germany program, recalls the re
action of his peers abroad as they listened to
American news reports. "Shock is scarcely a
sufficient word ... an enormously emotional
response was characteristic of most students."
English Prof. Arturo Islas, then a graduate
student, recalls hearing the news in his show
er, as the first frantic bulletins — bracketed
by radio silence — incorrectly reported both
Kennedy and Johnson had been shot. Accord
ing to Islas the news hit "like a bomb."
When he arrived on campus, later that af
ternoon, he was struck by the mood. "Ire
