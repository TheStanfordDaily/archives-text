## The
						recruits that Stanford missed 
### 
Without dopes like
myself, other writers
wouldn't be taken
seriously.
So in the spirit of mediocre
literary craftsmanship, prepare
to be enlightened as to how
Stanford lost a No. 1 ranking
in women's volleyball, a top-20
ranking in men's basketball
and, in effect, Big Game.

Recruiting. While we have an
exceptional talent base, Stan
ford has failed to recruit the
clinchers â€” the key players to
ensure us the continued na
tional athletic prominence we
so richly deserve.
Though I'm not suggesting
following the model of the best
professional football team in
Florida, the Miami University
Hurricanes, there are still ways
outside the mainstream to
color the national polls Cardi
nal. And believe me, those who
know me well know that I am
the authority on colors.
Women's Volleyball
"Head of the Class" star
Robin Givens has the perfect
qualities of a volleyball player.
She deflects anything that
comes at her, most notably
popularity, and can go on the
attack in subtle, effective ways.
Witness how she filed from
divorce for heavyweight cham
pion Mike Tyson (bump), but
announced she wouldn't ask
for any money during the
divorce procedings from Tyson
(set), because she knew that
eventually Iron Mike would say
something defamatory enough

about her that she could sue
him for $125 million (spike!).
Men's Basketball
What happened Sunday
night in Indiana? Stanford's
plans for an undefeated season
and NCAA Championship (or
something like that) were un
dermined by a Hoosier squad
that had the gall to re
emphasize the value of a home
court advantage.
If only Stanford had remem
bered that Eddie Haskell, who
lives in Mayfield, which is prob
ably in one of those states like
Indiana, is still around. Good
ol' Eddie always had that ar
tificially real charm that al
ways gave him a certain depth
and three-dimensional quality
beyond any other character on
"Leave it to Beaver."
Eddie also got away with
everything. Stanford could
have matched up Eddie against
Indiana center Todd Jadlow,
who made 17 free throws Sun
day. Every time Eddie would
have committed a foul, he
would have just gone up to the
ref and began in that sac
charinely beguiling tone, "Aw,
gee Mr. Referee..
Stanford would have ended
up with 17 goaltending calls,
and Indiana would have
learned an important lesson by
the end of the show.
Football
Many, in the land where
"Volpe up the middle" has in
fact become a cliche symboliz
ing campus dating life, would
point to the obvious lack of im
agination in Stanford's football
coaching as the reason for the
Cardinal's many close losses
and, by definition, closer ties.
This is simply not true. No
matter what plays you run, no
matter how well you perform,
you can't lose the game if you
don't give the opponent the
ball.
