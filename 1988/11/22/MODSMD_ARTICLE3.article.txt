# TA wages not cut
## Hours will decrease along with salary 
### Amy Rosenfeld Senior staff writer 
Attempting to clear up uncer
tainty over teaching assistant
salaries, Dean of Graduate
Studies Elizabeth Traugott sent a
letter last week to all Humanities
and Sciences department chairs
and administrators outlining Uni
versity guidelines for TA salaries.
Recent cuts in departmental
funding by the School of Human
ities and Sciences have led to con
cern that teaching assistants'
salaries could be reduced.
In the Nov. 14 letter, Traugott
reminded departments that TA
salaries are fixed across the Uni
versity. If it is necessary to reduce
stipends because of budget cuts,
she wrote, hours would have to
be reduced proportionally.
Thus, TA salaries will not
decrease relative to the number
of hours a TA works. In fact, the
University-allotted stipend for a
"50 percent" TA — 20 hours a
week — increased 6.7 percent last
year, according to Karlene Dickey,
associate dean of graduate
studies.
What will decrease are the TA's
absolute salaries, a combination
of department-financed stipends
— which are supposed to cover
room and board — and tuition
grants. Tuition grants are
awarded by the University based
on the amount of time a TA works
per week.
The School of Humanities and
Sciences has mandated cuts in TA
funding of between 6 and 14 per
cent for each department.
In an article in the Nov. 4 Daily,
Dean of Humanities and Sciences

Ewart Thomas said the budget
cuts result from sloppy budgeting
in the past and shifts in student
enrollment in various depart
ments.
Dickey said that cuts in funding
by Humanities and Sciences may
result in one of three outcomes,
or some combination of the three.
Departments will either have to
reduce the number of hours each
TA works, reduce the number of
TAs they hire or limit class en
rollment, Dickey said.
Whatever happens, both TAs
and students could suffer. If a de
partment reduces a TA's hours,
then that TA's earnings would
decrease, regardless of whether
the TA wanted reduced hours.
If a department hires fewer TAs
and enrollment stays the same,
then each TA would have to be
responsible for more students,
leading to larger sections and less
individualized attention for stu
dents.
Finally, limited class enroll
ments would mean that some stu
dents will be shut out of classes
they are interested in taking.
Several department representa
tives expressed concern that these
problems may arise in the future.
Barbara Dillard, undergraduate
secretary in the Physics Depart
ment, said she did not think the
cuts would affect the Physics De
partment this year, but they may
in the future. "At this point" the
department has enough TAs, she
said.
The case is different in the Eco
nomics Department. According to
department administrator Ed
wenna Werner, the department
does not have enough funds to
hire as many TAs as it would like.
However, she added, this is not
a problem this year because there
are more slots available for eco
nomics TAs than there are stu
dents who wish to be TAs.
A lack of available TAs can lead
to larger sections. Currently, the
average economics TA is respon
sible for two sections per week
averaging about 25 students each
— a total of about 50 students
per TA, Werner said.
TAs in the Human Biolpgy core
are also responsible for an average
of 50 students each, according to
Deana Fabbro-Johnston, Human
Biology program administrator.

What will decrease
are the TAs' absolute
salaries, a combina
tion of department
financed stipends
and tuition grants.

"We could hire more with no
problem except that our budget
doesn't allow for it," she said.
Fabbro-Johnston added that the
program has not been hurt yet
this quarter but could be if class
enrollment changes.
Still, the department has not
limited class enrollment yet and
has no plans to in the the future,
Fabbro-Johnston said. "It's not
fair to our student body to do
that," she said.

a problem this year because there
are more slots available for eco
nomics TAs than there are stu
dents who wish to be TAs.
A lack of available TAs can lead
to larger sections. Currently, the
average economics TA is respon
sible for two sections per week
averaging about 25 students each
— a total of about 50 students
per TA, Werner said.
TAs in the Human Biolpgy core
are also responsible for an average
of 50 students each, according to
Deana Fabbro-Johnston, Human
Biology program administrator.

What will decrease
are the TAs' absolute
salaries, a combina
tion of department
financed stipends
and tuition grants.

"We could hire more with no
problem except that our budget
doesn't allow for it," she said.
Fabbro-Johnston added that the
program has not been hurt yet
this quarter but could be if class
enrollment changes.
Still, the department has not
limited class enrollment yet and
has no plans to in the the future,
Fabbro-Johnston said. "It's not
fair to our student body to do
that," she said.
