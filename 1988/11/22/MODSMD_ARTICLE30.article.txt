# Volleyball banishes Buffaloes
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
After competing in a couple of
marathons, the Stanford women's
volleyball team was glad to stick
to sprints. Closing out the regular
season with a quick 58-minute,
three-game match, the No. 2 Car
dinal streaked past a young and
outmatched Colorado club 15-12,
15-3, 15-8.

Women's Volleyball
Cardinal 3, Buffaloes 0

The win capped the Stanford
record at 27-2 and assured the
squad the status of being the sec
ond seed in the West region in
the upcoming NCAA Tournament.
At 21-12, the unranked Buffaloes
have little chance of a tournament
berth but showed the signs of a
rapidly developing volleyball pro
gram.
So steady was Colorado at the
outset that the team put the Car
dinal's back to the wall early in
the first game. The Buffaloes
earned a 12-5 advantage, only to
see Stanford come back and score
nine unanswered points for the
game.
After that, it was all Stanford.
Awakening from a slight defensive
haze, the Cardinal began to show
the block that is ranked 11th na
tionally and the overbearing of
fense that has barraged competi
tors all season long. The end
rapidly arrived.
"It's nice to have a quick one
like that," Stanford Coach Don
Shaw said. "It's been a while, it
seems, since we had a good 3-0
win.
"We started out a little cold,
but I think the gym had a lot to
do with it. We may have taken
them a little too lightly, but that's
a pretty good little squad."
Especially impressive was
Susan Magda, a southpaw left
side hitter whose unusual ap
proach and smart hitting helped
the Buffaloes early on. Possessing
a quick lateral leap, Magda moved
fluidly on the net and evaded
Stanford blockers until the Car
dinal adapted its block to her
style.
"It's unusual to see a lefty com

ing out there like that, and we
had a little trouble with it early,
but after a while it wasn't too
much of a problem," Shaw said.
"I knew it was going to take us
a while to adjust; luckily it didn't
take us longer than one game. It
was a case of us waking up and
adjusting to what they were
doing."
Colorado, on the other hand,
never did seem to adjust. They
were consistently fooled by the
Stanford "X" play (where the
middle blocker pretends to hit but
the ball is actually set to and hit
by an attacker jumping behind
her), as well as by the Cardinal's
other misdirection ploys.
The Buffaloes also couldn't stop
Jennifer Chaffee, who led the
match with nine kills and re
corded a .500 hitting percentage.
Especially from the back row,
Chaffee was on fire.
But the real boost came from
serving. Stanford recorded nine
aces — two each from Lara Asper
and Laura Olesen, one each from
Chaffee and Hayes — and served
well enough to keep the visitors
from passing proficiently.
"I knew that the key would be
serving and passing," Shaw said.
"We served them tough — we
knew that if we took them out of
their offense, they'd have a tough
time, because that's the type of
offense that relies on good pass
ing. Serve them tough, and
they're going to have problems."
Enough problems to give Hayes
a smooth send-off. Although Stan
ford will probably host a first
round match of the NCAA tour
nament, tonight marked Hayes'
last regular season match in
Maples.
"It was kind of anticlimactic,
but I'm glad we didn't lose,"
Hayes said of the finale. "We
didn't let down a whole lot or
drag it out. I liked it as a last
match.
"Of course I feel a little bit sad,
because this has been probably a
third of my life at Stanford. It
will definitely be a shock not
having it every day in the winter
and spring. It will be nice to have
the extra free time, and I'll see
the team — that will be one of
the huge things I will miss — the
people."

Junior Lara Asper led the Cardinal to a quick victory over the
Colorado Buffaloes last night. The setter performed her job well,
garnering 30 assists In Stanford's three-game win.
After competing in a couple of
marathons, the Stanford women's
volleyball team was glad to stick
to sprints. Closing out the regular
season with a quick 58-minute,
three-game match, the No. 2 Car
dinal streaked past a young and
outmatched Colorado club 15-12,
15-3, 15-8.

Cardinal 3, Buffaloes 0

The win capped the Stanford
record at 27-2 and assured the
squad the status of being the sec
ond seed in the West region in
the upcoming NCAA Tournament.
At 21-12, the unranked Buffaloes
have little chance of a tournament
berth but showed the signs of a
rapidly developing volleyball pro
gram.
So steady was Colorado at the
outset that the team put the Car
dinal's back to the wall early in
the first game. The Buffaloes
earned a 12-5 advantage, only to
see Stanford come back and score
nine unanswered points for the
game.
After that, it was all Stanford.
Awakening from a slight defensive
haze, the Cardinal began to show
the block that is ranked 11th na
tionally and the overbearing of
fense that has barraged competi
tors all season long. The end
rapidly arrived.
"It's nice to have a quick one
like that," Stanford Coach Don
Shaw said. "It's been a while, it
seems, since we had a good 3-0
win.
"We started out a little cold,
but I think the gym had a lot to
do with it. We may have taken
them a little too lightly, but that's
a pretty good little squad."
Especially impressive was
Susan Magda, a southpaw left
side hitter whose unusual ap
proach and smart hitting helped
the Buffaloes early on. Possessing
a quick lateral leap, Magda moved
fluidly on the net and evaded
Stanford blockers until the Car
dinal adapted its block to her
style.
"It's unusual to see a lefty com

ing out there like that, and we
had a little trouble with it early,
but after a while it wasn't too
much of a problem," Shaw said.
"I knew it was going to take us
a while to adjust; luckily it didn't
take us longer than one game. It
was a case of us waking up and
adjusting to what they were
doing."
Colorado, on the other hand,
never did seem to adjust. They
were consistently fooled by the
Stanford "X" play (where the
middle blocker pretends to hit but
the ball is actually set to and hit
by an attacker jumping behind
her), as well as by the Cardinal's
other misdirection ploys.
The Buffaloes also couldn't stop
Jennifer Chaffee, who led the
match with nine kills and re
corded a .500 hitting percentage.
Especially from the back row,
Chaffee was on fire.
But the real boost came from
serving. Stanford recorded nine
aces — two each from Lara Asper
and Laura Olesen, one each from
Chaffee and Hayes — and served
well enough to keep the visitors
from passing proficiently.
"I knew that the key would be
serving and passing," Shaw said.
"We served them tough — we
knew that if we took them out of
their offense, they'd have a tough
time, because that's the type of
offense that relies on good pass
ing. Serve them tough, and
they're going to have problems."
Enough problems to give Hayes
a smooth send-off. Although Stan
ford will probably host a first
round match of the NCAA tour
nament, tonight marked Hayes'
last regular season match in
Maples.
"It was kind of anticlimactic,
but I'm glad we didn't lose,"
Hayes said of the finale. "We
didn't let down a whole lot or
drag it out. I liked it as a last
match.
"Of course I feel a little bit sad,
because this has been probably a
third of my life at Stanford. It
will definitely be a shock not
having it every day in the winter
and spring. It will be nice to have
the extra free time, and I'll see
the team — that will be one of
the huge things I will miss — the
people."
