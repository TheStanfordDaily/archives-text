That's the rundown of Stanford guard
Terry Taylor's shooting last year. 65
three-point goals, nine two-pointers.
Now, 3-point shots are supposed to
be more difficult than 2-pointers. After
all, they bring 50 percent more of a
return when they succeed.
Not for Terry Taylor, the 6-foot-2,
180-pound senior from Aurora, Colo. If
Taylor were a football player, he'd build
up his scoring by piling up safeties. If
he were a baseball player, he'd
ameliorate his RBI totals through bases
loaded walks. His points don't come
cheaply, but they do come easily.
Taylor thrives in 3-point land. You've
heard of the guy who wouldn't touch
something with a 10-foot pole? Taylor
doesn't touch the basket with a 10-foot
shot. Nineteen feet-nine suits Taylor
just fine.
"He's a great 3-point shooter," Stan
ford Coach Mike Montgomery said,
"(but) he's like a fish out of water when
he's inside."
It seems as if the 3-point rule was
created for Taylor, who is now only five
away from former Arizona great Steve
Kerr's Pacific 10 Conference career
record of 114.
"It's helped my game a lot," Taylor
said. "I was always a good shooter from
outside, but it didn't really set me apart.

It gives me a little more stock as far
as my credibility."
The trend has continued this year, as
Taylor has hit four 3-pointers compared
to one conventional basket. But even
though Taylor's marquee value lies in
his 3-point shooting, his true value to
the team is in running the offense.
Last week began Taylor's third
straight year at the helm of the Cardinal
offense. He has two of the top three
single-season assist totals in Stanford's
history (161 last year and 142 in 1986-
87).
"I don't worry about scoring," said
Taylor, whose career averages going into
this season were 6.9 points per game
and 3.8 assists per game. "My main job
is to run the team, get it to a guy when
he needs it, keep everyone happy"
Montgomery has emphasized that
with all Stanford's talent, the Cardinal
may only be able to go as far as its
point guard can take it. Montgomery
praised Taylor's performance in those
respects.
"[Taylorl does an exceptional job of
handling the ball," Montgomery said,
"giving us an offense and not turning
the ball over."
Taylor doesn't really do a paint job
— going into the lane — when he's
running the offense either. That's sim
ply not his style.
"Some guards are great penetrator
creators like (UCLA's) Pooh Richard
son, (New York Knicks') Mark Jack
son," Taylor said. "I just read the de
fense; I don't try and force anything.

Just having good scorers on your team
helps."
His teammates may give Taylor a lift,
but in a team game such as basketball,
what goes around comes around, and
Taylor gives the Cardinal squad, as well
as many fans, a lift as well. His most
famous (some might say notorious) way
of doing so is by pumping his fist in
the air after — what else — a three
pointer.
"[Terry] is real competitive," senior
guard Todd Lichti said. "He has an
inner confidence. At times it's seen as
cockiness, (but) it's something that
makes him as good as he is."
"I probably don't even realize I'm
doing it," Taylor said. "When I do some
thing good, I just pump my fist because
I want everyone else to get into it. It's
just part of my emotional release and
I think it gets the fans into it."
The fist-pump is another constant of
Taylor's game. Taylor is basically the
same kind of player he was when he
entered Stanford in 1985 after having
been Colorado Player of the Year at
Range view High School. But, after hold
ing his own over the last three years
against the likes of Richardson and
former North Carolina and California
guards Kenny Smith and Kevin
Johnson, Taylor said he has gained ex
perience and confidence.
That's refined his skills of reading
the game and shooting the ball, both
from the field and from the line (83

Running the offense
Senior Terry Taylor looks to pass it inside. The point guard is fast approaching
Arizona legend Steve Kerr's Pac-10 record for 3-pointers.
