## Skippers only 5 points out of first in tight race

After winning several qualify
ing regattas by only a few points,
the Stanford sailing team found
itself on the other side of a slim
margin this weekend at the North
American Sloop Championship at
Santa Cruz, where the Cardinal
finished fifth, just five points be
hind the winners.
Throughout the regatta, the
best teams in the nation dueled
for the sloop title in light, shifting
breezes and variable seas. No one
team dominated in the confused
conditions, and the results of the
championship weren't decided un
til the event's final race.
By the end of that race, Old
Dominion had earned this year's

title by winning a tie-breaker with
Rhode Island, which also finished
with 22 points. Third place was
claimed by the College of Charles
ton, which had 26 points, and in
fourth was Texas, which won a
tie-breaker with Stanford.
Stanford's entry in the cham
pionship was sailed by seniors Bill
Shoemaker and Brad Swett,
junior Robert Brown, and sopho
more Scott Dale.
Though the Cardinal team was
disappointed to come so close to
the title without finishing in the
top three, all agreed that they had
sailed against some of the nation's
best during the weekend regatta.
All of the top three boats were
sailed by 1988 All-Americas.
"It was a tough regatta, and
everyone had bad races and good

races. We sailed as well as we
could, but it just didn't work out,"
Brown said.
According to Stanford Coach
Blake Middleton, the Cardinal
boat was in it until the very end,
when it started the last race just
four points out of first place.
"We were definitely sailing in
their league, which isn't always
the case when you travel to a
regatta of this caliber. If we had
been able to move up during the
last race, we would have finished
in the top three. Given who we
were sailing against, though, I'm
happy that the team ended up in
the top rive," Middleton said.
The sloop championship is one
of five event titles that college
sailing teams compete for during
the year.
