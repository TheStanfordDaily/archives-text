# Team USA to meet Cuba at Maples tonight
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
As will be evident tonight in
Maples Pavilion, Stanford has
achieved a place among the na
tions elite volleyball schools on
the men's and women's levels.
Featuring three players off of
the 1986 top-five Cardinal squad
— All-America Jon Root, Chris
Braun and current senior Scott
Fortune — the U.S. National
Volleyball Team comes to the
Farm tonight to close out an
eight-match tour with Cuba.
So far, the undisputed cham
pion of champions has had little
difficulty dispatching the visit
ing Cubans. Fresh off its gold

medal defense at the Seoul
Olympics, Team USA has
claimed a 7-0 lead in the series
coming into tonight's standing
room-only contest.
For anyone who has followed
international volleyball for the
past four years, this is hardly a
surprise. Though Cuba defeated
the U.S. when the teams last
met at Maples in 1986, the
American squad has achieved an
unprecedented predominance in
the past quadrennium by sweep
ing every Grand Slam event in
cluding back-to-back Olympic
gold medals.
This tour will serve as the
final proving ground for a team
destined to be labelled as the

best ever. With Cuba excluded
from Olympic competition due
to the nation's boycott, USA now
has an opportunity to show that
it could have earned its medal
even with Cuba in the fray.
For Stanford, tonight's game
will provide an opportunity to
see the exploits of its national
team representatives first hand.
With the departure of starting
middle blockers Doug Partie and
Craig Buck as well as outside
hitter Dave Saunders, the Car
dinal trio should see a fair share
of action.
Root, a middle blocker at Stan
ford and a right-side hitter on
Team USA, could play either po
sition this evening, depending on

where interim Coach Gary Sato
places the squad's leading
blocker and most prolific hitter
Steve Timmons.
Braun stands an equally good
chance for action. Also capable
of playing the outside and the
middle, the Stanford record
holder for most kills in a match
(a phenomenal 49) should be one
of the first players off the bench.
That leaves Fortune, the
player who scored the gold
medal-winning point against the
Soviet Union. Fortune missed
most of the tour, but stands a
great chance of starting at
middle blocker tonight as he has
periodically over the past year.
