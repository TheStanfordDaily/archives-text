# Reagans start library
## 
### 
Scooping three shovel-fulls of
Southern California earth yester
day, President Reagan broke
ground for the presidential library
that was once destined to be built
in the Stanford foothills.
The president and Mrs. Reagan
gathered with close friends at the
Simi Valley site, about 45 miles
northwest of Los Angeles, to cel
ebrate the ground-breaking for
the $42 million facility and to
reflect on the last eight years.
"What this library will house is
the record of ideas and policies
that have undergirded our ac
complishments," Reagan said.
"There will be much to study
here, much to discuss, much to
mull over."
The Stanford Board of Trustees
voted in 1985 to approve construc

tion of the library in the under
developed foothills west of
campus. But in April 1987, the
Reagan Presidential Foundation
withdrew the offer to build the
facility at Stanford after the emer
gence of widespread opposition
here from environmentalists and
from faculty who feared the li
brary of a conservative president
would compromise Stanford's ac
ademic integrity.
The library will be the
repository for an expected 62 mil
lion papers, the most ever
generated by a U.S. president.
The library will be built from
donations to the private Ronald
Reagan Library Foundation. It
will sit in an area of rolling hills
covered with brush, beavertail
cactus and wildflowers.
