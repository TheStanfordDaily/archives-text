# University claims ignorance in ranch dispute
## 
### Robert Landon Staff writer 
According to University officials,
there is no process by which the Uni
versity monitors the labor practices of
outside employers who provide
workers for full- and part-time Uni
versity jobs.
This response by the University
comes after recent reports that some
workers at the Athletics Department
receive as little as $4.25 an hour for
their work, although the University
pays their direct employer $8.50.
These workers also lack any health or
pension benefits and receive no sick
leave or vacation pay.
Since the late 19705, as many as 15
workers have been supplied by Webb
Ranch, a private, family-owned farm
on the west side of campus that is
leased from the University, according
to Thomas Hubbard, a ranch manager.
Most are Mexican immigrants and

speak little, if any, English.
The contract between Webb Ranch
and the University makes no reference
to Webb Ranch's responsibility to its
employees except that the ranch obey
all federal and state labor regulations,
according to Jim Gallaher, director of
the Procurement Office, which handles
all contracts between Stanford and
outside businesses.
However, Gallaher added that the
University does not make any specific
efforts to ensure these regulations are
followed.
University Vice President Ralph Bu
chanan agreed that as far he knows
there is no process by which the Uni
versity monitors outside contractors.
Gallaher said the University never
tried to find out from Webb Ranch
how much it was paying the laborers
who work on campus. Even though a
similar controversy arose over the use
of Webb Ranch workers in 1985, Gal-

Cummings referred to
the contract with Webb
Ranch as a 'purchase
order.' Gallaher called
Webb Ranch a 'vendor'
of labor.

laher said he was only aware that the
University payed the ranch $8.50 an
hour for each worker.
However, Senior Assoc. Director of
Athletics Alan Cummings said he was
aware that ranch workers were receiv
ing less than the $8.50 his department
payed Webb Ranch. But he said that
for the eight years he has been with
the Athletics Department, he never in
vestigated how much less the workers
received.
"We have not investigated the con

tract with Webb Ranch beyond the
contractual arrangements established
by the University's procurement de
partment," said Cummings.
He referred to the contract with
Webb Ranch as a "purchase order."
Gallaher called Webb Ranch a "vendor"
of labor.
Even though the relationship be
tween Webb Ranch and Stanford is a
problematic one, Cummings said he
has praise for the ranch.
"We've enjoyed a fine relationship
with Webb Ranch. They provide good
labor dependably and conveniently," he
said.
The Athletics Department employs
two Webb Ranch workers on a full
time basis at the golf course, Cum
mings said. Hubbard said two to five
more workers come in on a daily basis.
The United Stanford Workers have
contended that this lies in violation of
the spirit of the union's contract with
the University.
