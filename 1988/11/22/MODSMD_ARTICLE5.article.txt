# Cal's Oski found with statue in City

As he promised last Wednesday, Oski
the Bear has returned to UC-Berkeley,
but not without kind words for his ab
ductors.
"I sure will miss my friends at Stan
ford," read a note attached to the stuffed
Cal mascot when it was discovered yes
terday. "You never know, they could
come up and liberate me again (it was
so easy the first time)."
After a two-year hiatus, the bear reap
peared chained to a fence near San Fran

cisco's Vaillancourt Fountain. He was
"rescued" by Melanie Morgan and Nick
Martin of radio station KGO, who cut
off his chains.
Before returning home to Berkeley in
a chauffeured limousine, Oski made a
guest appearance on KGO-TV's 9 a.m.
news show. At 12:30 p.m. he was wel
comed home by the Cal band, the Rally
Committee — the equivalent of Stan
ford's Axe Committee — a representa
tive of the Cal student government and
Michele Woods-Jones, director of Cal
Student Activities and Services.
The bear demanded that "the

weenies, I mean the people at Cal, re
spect me when I return." He asked that
he be called Oski, which he was named
by his kidnappers, instead of the
"Golden Bear," though he was quick to
add that he did not want to be confused
"with that wimp who walks around on
the field during football games."
He added that Cal had to prove that
it really wanted him back "by springing
for a good pair of bolt-cutters."
Mohammed Qureshi, chair of Cal's
Rally Committee said: "We at Cal still
don't call him Oski. We know he
changed his name, but we don't
buy that." He added that the bear
may be renamed if the students
feel that it is important.
Last Wednesday, the Stanford
News Service received a note from
Oski saying that he was planning
to return to Cal soon.
The bear was returned to his
home in a glass case in the Cal
student union, from which it was
abducted in 1986. Security has
not yet been improved, but there
has been discussion of adding
locks to the case.
The identity of the kidnappers
is still unknown, but speculation
has centered on several Stanford
student groups.
Axe Committee Chair Tom

Smegal said that the group's of
ficial comment was: "No com
ment." However, he added, "I sure
would like to know who (the kid
nappers) are. I'd like to party with
them."
Michele Fellows, director of
rallies for the Rally Committee,
said: "It's kind of cool, but a lot
of people are like 'Oh, it's just a
bear. It's getting kind of old.' "
Fellows added that the Rally
Committee is happy to have the
original bear back because it fits
in the case. Several stuffed bears
have been donated to Cal to take
Oski's place, but none was the
right size, she said.
Rally Committee officials said
that the bear was in good condi
tion, although one of its paws was
damaged, possibly when the
chains were removed.
"We were expecting much
worse," Fellows said.
