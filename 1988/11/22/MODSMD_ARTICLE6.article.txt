# Water saving goal not met
## Officials fine Stanford, though use drops 32 percent 
### Nathanael Cousins Staff writer 
University average monthly water use
has dropped 32 percent since July, but Stan
ford still has not met the water conserva
tion goals set by the San Francisco Water
District Conservation Department.
"We need to try harder," said Julie
Coopet, coordinator of the University
Housing Energy Conservation Center. "It's
a slow process, but we need to get every
one's awareness up about the drought in
California, and we have to keep conserv
ing."
According to Matt Mullin, water conser
vation administrator for the San Franciso
Water District, Stanford has been fined
$6,100 since the water "access use charge"
began in August. The fee is levied each
month if water conservation targets are
not met.
Mullin said Stanford missed its target
conservation by 6.5 percent in October and
was fined $3,824. Fines for September and
August were $1,236 and $1,040.

He explained that the target water re
duction level is set through a formula of
minimal indoor and outdoor water use from
the previous year. The target level is 10
percent lower for indoor use and 60 percent
lower for outdoor use, based on an average
of the lowest water use months â€” Decem
ber, January, February and March, from
the previous year.
Stanford's target conservation level for
October was 33 percent. The target for
November is 18.1 percent.
Stanford's conservation is consistent
with the 32 other suburban water districts,
he said, adding that so far the University
has been doing a better job than more than
half of the other districts. However, the
Conservation Department will continue the
fee program until at least February.
Over the last three months, the Conser
vation Department has issued more than
$1 million in water use charges.
Despite the earlier fines, San Francisco
conservation officials are optimistic.
