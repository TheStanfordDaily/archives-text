# Greeks confront racism
## Fraternities, sororities discuss recent incidents 
### Laura Jacobson Senior staff writer 
In the wake of racial incidents that
hit Stanford last spring and this fall,
some fraternities and sororities have
joined the plethora of campus groups
addressing sensitive issues of race, cul
ture and sexual preference.
Through sponsoring discussions, en
couraging joint minority-fraternal pro
gramming and promoting attendence at
events sponsored by minority groups,
the Greek system is making an effort
to examine prejudice and to educate its
members.
After the recent incidents, particularly
the discovery of two racially offensive
fliers at Ujamaa House, there is a "ten
dency on campus toward calling people
on incidents and mistakes," Interfrater
nity Council President Chris Erlin said.
"These kinds of incidents tend to pop
up because of an ignorance about the
black community," Erlin said. "The best
way to combat negative action is to ed
ucate (people) and teach them about the
black community so they don't make
the mistake again."
"Multicultural incidents are high on
everybody's agenda," said Michael Jack
son, assistant dean of Student Affairs.
"We're not in the business of changing
viewpoints, but trying to get people to
explore new information and be respect
ful of differences.
Jackson added that Residential Edu
cation, ethnic culture centers, the ASSU
and the Disability Resource Center are
taking the initiative to encourage pro
gramming and discussion. "(But) stu
dents say things to students better than
we can," he said.
As a result of incidents last spring,
the Phi Delta Theta fraternity and the

Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority have been
pressured by the Fraternal Affairs Office
to hold race-related programming. Seven
Phi Delts participated in a vigil outside
Otero House last May, suggesting to
many the tactics of the Ku Klux Klan.
The Kappa Kappa Gammas held a "cow
boy and Indian party" that offended a
number of students.
This fall, the Phi Delta Theta frater
nity has organized multicultural pro
grams. On Nov. 13, the Phi Delts invited
a representative of Students on Culture,
Class and Race to their house.
"The entire house was there. They
were genuine and trying to search for
better understanding," said Jackson,
who attended the three-hour program.
In addition, a group from the the
Woman's Center talked to the Phi Delts
about feminist issues last Monday,
Pangborn said. The fraternity has
planned programs with the Black Stu
dent Union, MEChA and the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance at Stanford, Pangborn
added.
The Kappas held a program earlier
this month with the Native American
theme house to learn more about the
history and culture of Native Americans.
Fraternities and sororities are trying
to increase their attendance at programs
sponsored by minority communities.
"There are so many programs on
campus ... why try to compete," Inter
sorority Council President Tina Niu said.
"The ISC is making an effort to support
other programs in ethnic theme houses."
A program called "The Role of Greeks
in the Black Community" has been or
ganized by the IFC and ISC intended to
educate the the predominantly white
Greek system. The Black Greek letter
Council has been invited to attend the
event, scheduled for Dec. 1.
