# Business School falls in poll
## Stanford drops to ninth in Business Week rankings 
### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
University officials yesterday
downplayed the Graduate School of
Business' drop in national rankings
from first in a 1987 poll by U.S. News
and World Report to ninth in a recent
poll by Business Week.
"There are many better ways to judge
the relative merits of schools," said
Robert Jaedicke, dean of the Business
School. "Rankings have a tendency to
become the lead indicator, thus obscur
ing the fact that top schools approach
management education and research in
quite different ways."
When U.S. News and World Report
ranked Stanford first in 1987, Jaedicke
gave the same response.
The Business Week poll, which sur
veyed corporate recruiters and the grad
uates of 23 top business schools, placed

Northwestern University at the top, fol
lowed by universities including Har
vard, Dartmouth, Wharton and Cornell
in descending order.
UC-Berkeley dropped from ninth in
the U.S. News and World Report poll
to 17th in the Business Week rankings.
Although the overall ranking placed
Stanford's business school ninth, corpo
rate recruiters ranked the school
seventh and graduates ranked it eighth.
While Stanford is not at the top of
Business Week's ranking, its graduates
are at the top of the pay scales.
The magazine's comparison of the
schools showed that Stanford graduates
receive the highest average starting
salary of $65,176. while Northwestern
graduates average $53,031.
Karen Nierenberg, director of admis
sions at the Business School, said mag
azine polls have had little effect on the
number of applicants in the past.

"[The applicants] are a pretty discern
ing bunch and I don't think they're
going to rely on an article in a magazine
to make their choice," she said.
Nierenberg said the number of appli
cations roughly corresponds to the num
ber of people taking the GMAT, the
standardized test that prospective grad
uate students in business take nation
ally.
The number of people taking the
GMAT has not increased in the past
few years, Nierenberg said. And the
number of applicants to the Business
School has remained consistent, even
last year when Stanford was ranked No.
1.
The methods that Business Week used
in ranking the schools differed from the
methods that U.S. News and World
Report used last year.
Instead of polling business
school deans and faculty as U.S.
News and World Report did, Busi
ness Week claims to have taken
"a strikingly different approach,"
surveying 112 corporate recruit
ers and 1,245 recent graduates
from 23 schools.
Because faculty were not in
volved in the rating, a school's
reputation for academic research
did not have as much weight, ac
cording to Business Week.
Graduates were asked to rate
the teaching, curriculum, environ
ment and placement offices at
their schools.
Stanford graduates responding
to the survey gave teaching a
grade of C and curriculum a B.
In contrast to Stanford officials,
who are indifferent to magazine
rankings, Donald Jacobs, dean of
Northwestern's Kellogg School of
Business, said he enjoys holding
the top spot.
"You're darned tootin' we want
to be N0.1," he told Business
Week.
