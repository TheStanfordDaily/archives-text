# Arafat says U.S. will issue him a visa

CAIRO, Egypt (AP) â€” Yasser Arafat
said yesterday the United States has
agreed to issue him a visa so he can
address the U.N. General Assembly, but
the State Department said the PLO
chairman hasn't even applied for one.
State Department officials acknowl
edged privately, however, that Egypt
and other moderate Arab nations had
asked that Arafat be granted a visa.
Arafat indicated President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt helped obtain a prom
ise of a visa. The Palestine Liberation
Organization leader spoke to reporters
after meeting with Foreign Minister Es
mat Abdel-Meguid, who said last week
that Egypt was interceding on Arafat's
behalf.
"President Mubarak informed me
today through Dr. Esmat Abdel-Meguid
that the U.S. administration has agreed
to grant me an entry visa so I can

address the United Nations," Arafat
said.
In Washington, State Department
spokesman Charles Redman said no visa
application had been received and if one
arrived it would be given "severe scru
tiny."
Redman said on Nov. 10 that the
Reagan administration would take into
account "applicable laws and regula
tions and other pertinent circum
stances" if Arafat requested a visa.
Under the 1947 agreement placing
U.N. headquarters in New York, the
United States is not supposed to "im
pose any impediment to transit" of
people involved in official business with
the United Nations.
Congress has authorized denying
visas to people who support terrorism,
however, and many terrorist acts have
been blamed on PLO factions over the

years.
Washington said last week the decla
ration of an independent state by the
Palestine National Council, which acts
as the PLO legislature, did not go far
enough in renouncing terrorism and was
too ambiguous in its implicit recognition
of Israel.
In a letter responding to 51 U.S.
senators who asked that Arafat be
denied a visa, Secretary of State George
Shultz said he has "no desire whatever
to see Arafat in the United States."
L. Paul Bremer, head of the State
Department counter-terrorism office,
said yesterday:"It is simply incorrect
to assert that by its recent declaration
the PLO renounced terrorism."
Arafat did not specify a date for his
second address to the General Assembly.
The first, in 1974, occurred after the
PLO was accepted as a U.N. observer.
