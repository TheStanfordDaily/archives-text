MANILA, Philippines (AP) —
Police arrested the leader of a
militant transportation union
today after he threatened to ex
pand a strike by drivers of pas
senger jeeps, a relative said.
Deogracias Espiritu, secretary
of a drivers' association known as
PISTON, had threatened to
broaden the walkout after Presi
dent Corazon Aquino refused the
group's demands for an immedi
ate reduction in commodity prices
or a freeze in fare reductions.
A relative said Espiritu was ar
rested later yesterday at his home.
Espiritu was the second union
leader arrested since PISTON,
which represents thousands of
passenger jeep drivers, launched
a transport strike Monday in
Manila and Cebu. PISTON Pres
ident Medardo Roda was arrested
Monday and charged with inciting
sedition.
Passenger jeeps are the main
form of land transport in the
Philippines.
Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre,
commander of the Philippine Con
stabulary's Capital Command,
said he ordered the arrest of strike

; Drivers have said
they are demand
ing cuts in com
' modity prices.

■ leaders who allegedly pressure
other jeep drivers to join the
i walkout.
"If we have ordered the arrest
of striking drivers who harrass
non-striking drivers, then we
should also arrest the leaders
since these drivers are just fol
lowing orders," Aguirre said in a
radio interview.
Aquino met yesterday with rep
resentatives of the transport in
dustry and promised to set up a
commission to study drivers' com
plaints. She said the commission
would complete its study within
30 days.
But she made no commitment
to reduce commodity prices and
rejected a demand to suspend a
government-ordered reduction in
passenger fares pending cuts in

the price of auto parts.
Drivers have said they are de
manding cuts in commodity
prices, but so far have specified
only reductions in auto parts.
Later, Espiritu told reporters
that drivers could not wait for
the study and would expand their
strike today.
Elementary and high schools in
Manila were closed today in an
ticipation of the strike, but police
said traffic appeared normal dur
ing the morning rush hour.
Espiritu said two other drivers
associations would join the
walkout, but Manila radio sta
tions said they changed their
minds and decided to work today.
Espiritu said drivers in Angeles
and the Bicol region of southeast
ern Luzon island would join the
strike. No reports emerged from
those areas early today.
In previous transport protests,
militants were successful in get
ting large numbers of drivers to
join on the first day of a strike
but participation dwindled after
ward because many operators
could not afford the loss of reve
nue.
