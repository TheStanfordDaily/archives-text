# Chun addresses Korea
## Ex-President apologizes for abuses, corruption 
### 
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) â€” Former
President Chun Doo-hwan apologized to
the nation today for human rights abuses
and corruption under his harsh rule and
said he was surrendering millions of dol
lars.
"I am pained and ashamed of my past.
x have no intention at all to make an ex
cuse," Chun said in a nationally televised,
30-minute address.
Chun, who said he was taking responsi
bility for all misdeeds under his rule, ended
by saying, "My dear people, I am really
sorry."
About 50 radical students armed with
iron rods and firebombs tried to break
through thousands of riot police around
Chun'B house in Seoul right after he spoke,
apparently to stop him from leaving, but
Chun already had left for rural exile.
"Arrest Chun Doo-hwan!," the students
shouted as police dispersed them.
Chun told the nation he would not try
to defend or explain his past actions and
deeply regretted the abuses under his gov
ernment.
Many Koreans have been demanding
Chun be arrested and tried for abuses and
corruption during his seven-year term that
ended in February. Opposition groups
staged violent protests as anger over Chun
mounted.
President Roh Tae-woo, another former
general and associate of Chun, is trying to
defuse the crisis without damaging his gov
ernment's position.
Chun left his home right after the speech
to go into exile some place in the country
side.
Yonhap, the South Korean news agency,
said Chun and his wife were going to a
Buddhist monastery in the mountains east
of Seoul. Rural exile is a traditional Korean
form of atonement for disgraced officials.
Roh must somehow satisfy public in
dignation against Chun while distancing
his government from past abuses.
Some opposition groups have called for
Roh's resignation or overthrow, contending
the government is a front for military rule
and part of the system erected by Chun.
To atone, the 57-year-old Chun said
today that he was surrendering all his per
sonal property, including his house and
land, about $3.3 million in cash and mem
bership in two golf clubs.
Chun also said he was returning about
$20 million in surplus political funds left
over at the end of his term. He said he
did not have any property or money hidden
overseas, even though he knew many people
would not believe him.
Chun, a former general, took power with
military backing in 1980. He has denied

any personal corruption, but about a dozen
of his relatives and associates have been
convicted or charged with embezzlement
and other crimes.
He said today he took responsibility for
all wrongs committed under his govern
ment. "For all the misdeeds and mistakes
committed in the seven years of office, I
am responsible because I was the man who
held ultimate responsibility for state af
fairs," he said.
Chun specifically apologized for the
forced dismissal of government officials and
journalists when he took power; the deaths
of opposition supporters who were sent to
harsh re-education camps; and corruption
and embezzlement by relatives and as
sociates.
He made a special apology for the bloody
1980 suppression of an uprising by students
and citizens in the southern city of
Kwangju that left about 200 people dead.
He called it a "tragedy."
He said in turning his property over in
atonement, "I am now turning this over.
I hope this property and assets will be
disposed of in accordance with the people's
wishes and desires.
"This is all I have. There is nothing
hidden."
Many observers doubted that Chun's
apology would defuse the public anger
against the former president. Large num
bers of Koreans want Chun punished for
his harsh rule and demand a full, legal
accounting of his rule.
A National Assembly committee probing
the bloody military suppression of the
Kwangju uprising voted yesterday to sub
poena Chun to explain his role in the in
cident.
Opposition lawmakers on the committee
ignored pleas from government members
to wait until Chun made his statement to
the nation Wednesday before deciding
whether to proceed with a subpoena. The
committee voted 16-12 to subpoena Chun,
with members of the governing Democratic
Justice Party voting against.
Roh indicated he is considering pardon
ing Chun after Chun apologized, according
to South Korean press reports. But gov
ernment officials indicate they will initiate
a probe against Chun if the apology fails
to quiet public anger.
Chun was a senior general and in effec
tive control of the government when troops
quashed the uprising by citizens and stu
dents in Kwangju. Dissident groups claim
up to 2,000 people were killed.
Assembly committee officials indicated
Chun would be summoned in early Decem
ber. He would face prosecution if he did
not obey the subpoena.
