company is voluntarily recalling some of its fresh
whole turkeys from seven states, a Norbest Inc.

in some of the "Family Tradition" brand turkeys,

FAA praises Delta improvements
WASHINGTON (AP) — While there have been
improvements, pilots at Delta Air Lines continue
to have problems with cockpit crew coordination
and at times skirt established procedures, the
Federal Aviation Administration said yesterday.
The FAA said that while Delta's management
"has taken strong and positive action" in response
to a critical review of the airline's operations 14
months ago, much of its program has yet to be
fully implemented.
"Both line operations and training were found
to be improved," an FAA inspection team re
ported in a summary of findings from follow-up
checks conducted at the Atlanta-based airline in
early October.
A copy of the report became available yesterday.
