## First Thanksgiving 
### 
American Indians have
been exploited by the
Pilgrims' descendants

Tomorrow the citizens of
this nation will join together
to celebrate and give thanks.
Many students will consume
their turkey, cranberry sauce,
pumpkin pie and stuffing while
sharing the experience of one quar
ter at Stanford with friends and
family.
Most will relax during the tem
porary interlude before finals and
more than a few will watch the
USC-Notre Dame football game.
Some will even contemplate the
meaning of Thanksgiving, reflect
ing on the plight of the pilgrims
who paved the way for the settling
of the United States by immigrants
from around the world.
Only a few, however, will ponder
the fate of American Indians,
whose generosity allowed the
pilgrims to survive the arduous
winter. Were it not for Chief Mas
sasoit and his followers, there
would be no Thanksgiving. Miles
Standish and his fellow pilgrims
would have surely perished had the
Native Americans not provided
sustenance.
Ironically, the generosity was not
re-paid. Instead of showing grati
tude to the American Indians, con
tracts were abrogated unilaterally
by the federal, state and territorial
governments. Settlers chased
American Indians across the con

tinent and eventually confined
them to reservations where many
of them died from hunger and dis
ease. In the process, American In
dians were robbed not only of their
land but of much of their cultural
and political identity.
In the face of this opposition,
American Indian culture has en
dured. Today, there are an esti
mated one to one-half million
American Indian citizens in the
United States. As some tribes
struggle to maintain their exis
tence, others are returning to their
cultural roots.
For example, the Cherokee na
tion under the leadership of Wilma
Mankiller is prospering in its ef
forts to reinvigorate the tribe.
There is a renewed sense of pride
and an improved educational sys
tem for the Cherokees in Oklaho
ma.
Last year, the U.S. Congress
declared this week to be American
Indian Week. It is important to
understand the contributions of
American Indians to the United
States and to be reminded of the
flourishing culture that was here
before most of our ancestors ar
rived.
But that is not enough. In
today's modern world, individuals
must not make the same mistakes
as the settlers. The respect of
treaties and all cultures is neces
sary to keep this world moving
forward.
Tomorrow, remember for a mo
ment those who made the day pos
sible and recognize the many
contributions of American Indians
to this country.
