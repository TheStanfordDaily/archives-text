Members of this
community should
respect each other
IN THE DAYS that have elapsed
since two racist posters were
brought to light and discussed at
Ujamaa, the Stanford community has
been involved in ongoing discussion
and speculation.
What possible explanation is there
for the way the posters were defaced?
How will the University respond? What
will be the fate of the two students
who admitted defacing one of the
posters?
What effects have events had on
students of color in Ujamaa and
throughout Stanford? What have ef
fects been on white students?
What does all of this say about our
ongoing efforts to promote a pluralistic
educational environment at Stanford?
First, it is important to state again
clearly and without qualification that
regardless of motivation or the pres
ence or absence of intention to do
harm, actions that have the effect of
degrading or demeaning others because
of their race, religion, sex, sexual
orientation, national origin or disability
are intolerable.
Ignorance — especially in a setting
like this — is not and cannot be an
excuse for doing harm to others. Sim
ply put, it is expected at Stanford that
people will think before they act, and
that before acting they will consider all
possible outcomes (not merely the
consciously intended ones) of their
actions.
In case anyone is tempted to con
clude that what happened was an
isolated event at a comfortable remove
from the daily lives of most Stanford
students, let us quickly recall that
insensitive and harmful acts have
happened before and can happen again.
They are everybody's problem.

There is an investigation underway
of the specifics of this most recent
event. When it is concluded, the Judi
cial Affairs Office will determine how
to proceed under the terms of the
Fundamental Standard.
However, waiting for that outcome is
not the best thing concerned members
of this community can do with our
time.
We can also:
• Reflect on what has happened, how
it could have happened and how it
might have been prevented.
• Consider what it is about racism
and other forms of objectification of
others that cuts so deeply and that
strikes at the heart of the identity of
the victims.
• Examine the dynamics involved
around the two students who admitted
defacing one of the posters — is there
particular relief in having someone to
blame?
How much of that feeling comes
from the specifics of their action and
how much from a desire to look out
ward rather than inward to find
wrongdoing?
• Pause to wonder at the term
"over-reaction," and consider what
causes someone to judge and try to
invalidate the feelings of another per
son.
How can we assess someone else's
pain or grief? How can we calibrate it
and decide what is just the right
amount of anguish for that person to
feel?
On the other hand, how do we find
the courage it takes to hear, accept
and even empathize with another's
suffering?
• Ask ourselves why some individuals
even now see what happened as
Ujamaa's problem, or Lagunita's prob
lem, or a problem for people of color
to cope with? What allows some of us
to feel unaffected by what has hap
pened?
• Talk about these questions in our
residences. Don't turn to students of
color to explain things, and please

don't conclude that if there are no
people of color in a given residence
then there is no need to have the
conversation.
The outcome of the judical process
in this instance is only one part of
what needs to be a response from the
whole community.
Just as it is wrong to behave as if
the two students who defaced a poster
are the only ones capable of such an
act, so too is it wrong to wash our
hands of the need to be part of the
response to the act. In reality, "the
University" is all of us.
The responsibility for shaping our
community as a place where everyone
can feel accepted and respected belongs
to us all.
As members of the staff of Residen
tial Affairs, we are committed to help
ing move this community toward the
achievement of that goal.

Different views
on abortion are not
mutually exclusive
In all of the recent polarized argu
ments about pro-choice (for the wom
an) and pro-life (for the fetus), it is
always assumed that these two rights
are mutually exclusive, as is certainly

currently the case.
To provoke some thought, I would
like to add the point of view expressed
a few years ago by Dr. Robert Wen
nberg, a philosopher and theologian:
.. should the woman have the
right to determine what happens in
and to her body, even to the point of
removing a developing fetus from her
womb, it does not follow that she also
has the right to the death of the fetus.
"Of course, in exercising her right of
bodily self-determination she will as a
matter of fact usually cause the death
of the fetus.
"But should artificial wombs be
created (no longer technologically in
conceivable) which would enable the
fetus to be kept alive by being trans
ferred from the mother's womb to the
artificial womb, the woman could then
exercise her right to bodily self
determination without killing the fetus.
"The woman would not have the
right to deny the fetus access to the
artificial womb based on her right to
bodily self-determination.
"These are, after all, different rights.
But in many cases of abortion, possibly
most, the woman wants the death of
the fetus, not just the ridding of her
womb of its presence.
"No doubt many women who now
have abortions would not have them if
an "abortion" meant merely transfer
ring the fetus to a life-sustaining ar
tificial womb, there to be cared for
and brought to maturity.
"Therefore we may wonder about
the moral integrity of invoking the
right to bodily self-determination in
order to secure something quite differ
ent, namely, the death of the fetus."
Wennberg has correctly described the
current debate as one which is "charac
terized ... by heated exchanges that
often display a greater desire for con
verts than for integrity of argument."
Hopefully in a thoughtful academic
community we at Stanford will in the
future pay more attention to the lattei
Joal.

exercise her right to bodily self
determination without killing the fetus.
"The woman would not have the
right to deny the fetus access to the
artificial womb based on her right to
bodily self-determination.
"These are, after all, different rights.
But in many cases of abortion, possibly
most, the woman wants the death of
the fetus, not just the ridding of her
womb of its presence.
"No doubt many women who now
have abortions would not have them if
an "abortion" meant merely transfer
ring the fetus to a life-sustaining ar
tificial womb, there to be cared for
and brought to maturity.
"Therefore we may wonder about
the moral integrity of invoking the
right to bodily self-determination in
order to secure something quite differ
ent, namely, the death of the fetus."
Wennberg has correctly described the
current debate as one which is "charac
terized ... by heated exchanges that
often display a greater desire for con
verts than for integrity of argument."
Hopefully in a thoughtful academic
community we at Stanford will in the
future pay more attention to the lattei
Joal.

Members of this
community should
respect each other
IN THE DAYS that have elapsed
since two racist posters were
brought to light and discussed at
Ujamaa, the Stanford community has
been involved in ongoing discussion
and speculation.
What possible explanation is there
for the way the posters were defaced?
How will the University respond? What
will be the fate of the two students
who admitted defacing one of the
posters?
What effects have events had on
students of color in Ujamaa and
throughout Stanford? What have ef
fects been on white students?
What does all of this say about our
ongoing efforts to promote a pluralistic
educational environment at Stanford?
First, it is important to state again
clearly and without qualification that
regardless of motivation or the pres
ence or absence of intention to do
harm, actions that have the effect of
degrading or demeaning others because
of their race, religion, sex, sexual
orientation, national origin or disability
are intolerable.
Ignorance — especially in a setting
like this — is not and cannot be an
excuse for doing harm to others. Sim
ply put, it is expected at Stanford that
people will think before they act, and
that before acting they will consider all
possible outcomes (not merely the
consciously intended ones) of their
actions.
In case anyone is tempted to con
clude that what happened was an
isolated event at a comfortable remove
from the daily lives of most Stanford
students, let us quickly recall that
insensitive and harmful acts have
happened before and can happen again.
They are everybody's problem.

There is an investigation underway
of the specifics of this most recent
event. When it is concluded, the Judi
cial Affairs Office will determine how
to proceed under the terms of the
Fundamental Standard.
However, waiting for that outcome is
not the best thing concerned members
of this community can do with our
time.
We can also:
• Reflect on what has happened, how
it could have happened and how it
might have been prevented.
• Consider what it is about racism
and other forms of objectification of
others that cuts so deeply and that
strikes at the heart of the identity of
the victims.
• Examine the dynamics involved
around the two students who admitted
defacing one of the posters — is there
particular relief in having someone to
blame?
How much of that feeling comes
from the specifics of their action and
how much from a desire to look out
ward rather than inward to find
wrongdoing?
• Pause to wonder at the term
"over-reaction," and consider what
causes someone to judge and try to
invalidate the feelings of another per
son.
How can we assess someone else's
pain or grief? How can we calibrate it
and decide what is just the right
amount of anguish for that person to
feel?
On the other hand, how do we find
the courage it takes to hear, accept
and even empathize with another's
suffering?
• Ask ourselves why some individuals
even now see what happened as
Ujamaa's problem, or Lagunita's prob
lem, or a problem for people of color
to cope with? What allows some of us
to feel unaffected by what has hap
pened?
• Talk about these questions in our
residences. Don't turn to students of
color to explain things, and please

don't conclude that if there are no
people of color in a given residence
then there is no need to have the
conversation.
The outcome of the judical process
in this instance is only one part of
what needs to be a response from the
whole community.
Just as it is wrong to behave as if
the two students who defaced a poster
are the only ones capable of such an
act, so too is it wrong to wash our
hands of the need to be part of the
response to the act. In reality, "the
University" is all of us.
The responsibility for shaping our
community as a place where everyone
can feel accepted and respected belongs
to us all.
As members of the staff of Residen
tial Affairs, we are committed to help
ing move this community toward the
achievement of that goal.

Different views
on abortion are not
mutually exclusive
In all of the recent polarized argu
ments about pro-choice (for the wom
an) and pro-life (for the fetus), it is
always assumed that these two rights
are mutually exclusive, as is certainly

currently the case.
To provoke some thought, I would
like to add the point of view expressed
a few years ago by Dr. Robert Wen
nberg, a philosopher and theologian:
.. should the woman have the
right to determine what happens in
and to her body, even to the point of
removing a developing fetus from her
womb, it does not follow that she also
has the right to the death of the fetus.
"Of course, in exercising her right of
bodily self-determination she will as a
matter of fact usually cause the death
of the fetus.
"But should artificial wombs be
created (no longer technologically in
conceivable) which would enable the
fetus to be kept alive by being trans
ferred from the mother's womb to the
artificial womb, the woman could then
exercise her right to bodily self
determination without killing the fetus.
"The woman would not have the
right to deny the fetus access to the
artificial womb based on her right to
bodily self-determination.
"These are, after all, different rights.
But in many cases of abortion, possibly
most, the woman wants the death of
the fetus, not just the ridding of her
womb of its presence.
