# Virtues of public service debated
## 
### Lisa Lawrence Staff writer 
In an emotionally charged debate at
the Law School, University and local
public officials argued Monday evening
whether government supported public
service programs help or harm students.
"If you do not serve the society in
which you are located, ultimately you
produce the Ivan Boesky's of the world,"
said Robert Burkhardt, director of the
San Francisco Conservation Corps.
However, Hoover Fellow Bill Evers
argued that national service would limit
federal student aid to students who per
form public service. The system is more
like the draft than a voluntary program,
he charged.
"If we believe we have an inalienable
right to life, liberty and happiness, then
we do not want national servitude," said
Evers.
In the debate, sponsored by Stanford
in Government, former Silicon Valley
Rep. Paul "Pete" McCloskey and Cath
erine Milton, director of Stanford's

Public Service Center, joined Burkhardt
in arguing that students should feel
morally obligated to help their society
and that national service offers incen
tives that would encourage students to
volunteer.
Among other legislators, Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., and Sen. Barbara
Mikulski, D-Md., hope to create federal
programs similar to the "G.I. Bill."
By offering financial incentives, na
tional service programs would encour
age public service of college-age
students. If such a program were to
become law, volunteers could earn
vouchers toward college tuition in ex
change for service in the military or
social sector.
However, Evers disagreed with the
implementation of such programs.
He compared national service volun
teers to indentured servants of colonial
America and said he believes involun
tary servitude goes against the 13th
Amendment of the Constitution.
"It's a moral evil and we should fight
it every step of the way," he said, stress

ing that we should not let politicians
tell us what to do with our lives.
Mathematics Prcf. John Hancock and
History Prof. Paul Seaver agreed with
Evers, emphasizing that the abolition
of federal student aid would make na
tional service essentially mandatory for
the poor who wish to go on to higher
education.
Meanwhile, the rich, who can afford
higher education, can opt not to serve,
Seaver said.
He also said some students would dis
cover conflicts between their public
service jobs and their ethical, political
and religious biases.
For example, a national service pro
gram might assign a student who op
poses abortion to volunteer in a family
planning project, he said.
Nevertheless, Burkhardt insisted that
"everyone ought to be called on to serve.
Each of us owes a debt to society that
we need to repay."
He explained that students could not
be good leaders without being
good servers first.
"Whole hosts of tasks in the
United States are not best done
by corporations or government
agencies but are best done by
young people," McCloskey said.
"You need young people to tell
other young people to get out of
drugs. The best person to tell
them that is someone of their age
who they can trust," he said.
McCloskey added that it is the
young people in government in
ternships who have the greatest
new ideas and have the greatest
influence in political changes.
According to Milton, many stu
dents are interested in national
service but do not have the op
portunity to serve because of tre
mendous pressure to pay back
college loans.
Moderator Larry Horton, asso
ciate vice-president of University
Public Affairs, called the forum a
"very spirited interchange with no
holds barred."
