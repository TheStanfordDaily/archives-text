## The 						heart of the holiday 
### 
ASTRA NGER approached me while
I was reading the paper on Tres
idder back patio not too long back.
He seemed a little confused.
"Can you please help to explain some
thing to me?" he said, with an accent I
couldn't place.
"Keep it short, bub, I have a 1:15."
"I understand. My question is this:
What is it, this Thanksgiving time?" He
took a seat across the table from me.
I looked up from my paper for the first
time. Facing me was a disheveled, dis
traught individual wearing a "WE ARE
THE WORLD" sweatshirt and an ample
head of messy blond curls. Hearing the
question, I immediately determined that
Thanksgiving was not something I could
explain quickly. I was about to suggest
he explore some literature on the subject
when he continued.
"In my country we have what you call
Christmas, and we celebrate the New
Year, and National Day.. ."
"On July the 4th?" I asked.
"No. On September 7th," he replied
flatly. "Anyway, we have none of this
Thanksgiving."
After wondering for a few intense mo
ments why a country would choose Pearl
Harbor Day instead of July the 4th to
celebrate the nation, I decided to set this
guy straight, tell him what's what.
"Listen up. Thanksgiving is where you
eat a big turkey dinner real early in the
afternoon. And that way you can get to
sleep early, and wake up early, and get
a good start at shopping for Christmas
presents. That's why it's called 'Thanks
giving,' see. When you're done giving all

your cash to the department store clerk,
they always say: Thanks."
The curly blond head nodded slowly.
"So let me to understand," he said,
"Thanksgiving is when you go to buy the
Christmas gifts?"
"Well, you're supposed to," I admitted.
""I don't usually get around to that until
much later, though."
"What do you do, then?"
"Well, I usually go out in front of my
house to put up the American flag. Then
I stand there and just consider myself
lucky to be living in a country where we
celebrate Thanksgiving."
"I'm afraid I don't have a flag," he
confessed.
"Better hurry up and get one," I told
him. "You're in America now, you know."
But I don't think he was listening.
"When my country was first settled
many centuries ago," he started, "the
First People went through much hard
times. But they survived, and today we
are who we are because of that."
"Nice," I said. "When do you celebrate
this holiday?"
"We don't. In our mind's back, we are
just all the time reflecting how lucky we
are."
"Well, what time of year was your coun
try discovered?"
"Legends say, just as snows were mel
ting on mountains, so our fathers first
took steps on land."
"Hmm. That wouldn't work," I sug
gested. "A Christmas season from spring
to December is too long."
"I was just maybe thinking Thanks
giving was similar in the U.S." He looked

at me blankly.
"Well, I see what you mean," I said.
"I usually spend the long weekend re
flecting. . . on all the papers I have to
write!" I laughed at myself. He smiled
mysteriously.
"Are you going home for Thanksgiv
ing?" he asked.
"Sure am." The bell tower struck one.
I started folding the paper.
But he went on. "Then I think that
this Thanksgiving is happiest time of all
holidays. And I think so because it only
celebrates you and your happiness of fam
ily. Other holidays, they for other things
like your country or the heroes."
"Hey, hey," 1 said, "don't go knocking
Christmas. Nothing wrong with the
gifts." Again, I don't think he was lis
tening.
He said, "I think I shall take this op
portunity to relax, and to have a peaceful
and tranquil time."
After telling him not to have too much
fun, I got up to leave. He thanked me
for my time and said he hoped I would
ei\joy my visit home. I said I always do,
to which he said he always did his, as
well. I walked away thinking maybe I
would eryoy this Thanksgiving a little
more.

"Can you please help to explain some
thing to me?" he said, with an accent I
couldn't place.
"Keep it short, bub, I have a 1:15."
"I understand. My question is this:
What is it, this Thanksgiving time?" He
took a seat across the table from me.
I looked up from my paper for the first
time. Facing me was a disheveled, dis
traught individual wearing a "WE ARE
THE WORLD" sweatshirt and an ample
head of messy blond curls. Hearing the
question, I immediately determined that
Thanksgiving was not something I could
explain quickly. I was about to suggest
he explore some literature on the subject
when he continued.
"In my country we have what you call
Christmas, and we celebrate the New
Year, and National Day.. ."
"On July the 4th?" I asked.
"No. On September 7th," he replied
flatly. "Anyway, we have none of this
Thanksgiving."
After wondering for a few intense mo
ments why a country would choose Pearl
Harbor Day instead of July the 4th to
celebrate the nation, I decided to set this
guy straight, tell him what's what.
"Listen up. Thanksgiving is where you
eat a big turkey dinner real early in the
afternoon. And that way you can get to
sleep early, and wake up early, and get
a good start at shopping for Christmas
presents. That's why it's called 'Thanks
giving,' see. When you're done giving all

your cash to the department store clerk,
they always say: Thanks."
The curly blond head nodded slowly.
"So let me to understand," he said,
"Thanksgiving is when you go to buy the
Christmas gifts?"
"Well, you're supposed to," I admitted.
""I don't usually get around to that until
much later, though."
"What do you do, then?"
"Well, I usually go out in front of my
house to put up the American flag. Then
I stand there and just consider myself
lucky to be living in a country where we
celebrate Thanksgiving."
"I'm afraid I don't have a flag," he
confessed.
"Better hurry up and get one," I told
him. "You're in America now, you know."
But I don't think he was listening.
"When my country was first settled
many centuries ago," he started, "the
First People went through much hard
times. But they survived, and today we
are who we are because of that."
"Nice," I said. "When do you celebrate
this holiday?"
"We don't. In our mind's back, we are
just all the time reflecting how lucky we
are."
"Well, what time of year was your coun
try discovered?"
"Legends say, just as snows were mel
ting on mountains, so our fathers first
took steps on land."
"Hmm. That wouldn't work," I sug
gested. "A Christmas season from spring
to December is too long."
"I was just maybe thinking Thanks
giving was similar in the U.S." He looked

at me blankly.
"Well, I see what you mean," I said.
"I usually spend the long weekend re
flecting. . . on all the papers I have to
write!" I laughed at myself. He smiled
mysteriously.
"Are you going home for Thanksgiv
ing?" he asked.
"Sure am." The bell tower struck one.
I started folding the paper.
But he went on. "Then I think that
this Thanksgiving is happiest time of all
holidays. And I think so because it only
celebrates you and your happiness of fam
ily. Other holidays, they for other things
like your country or the heroes."
"Hey, hey," 1 said, "don't go knocking
Christmas. Nothing wrong with the
gifts." Again, I don't think he was lis
tening.
He said, "I think I shall take this op
portunity to relax, and to have a peaceful
and tranquil time."
After telling him not to have too much
fun, I got up to leave. He thanked me
for my time and said he hoped I would
ei\joy my visit home. I said I always do,
to which he said he always did his, as
well. I walked away thinking maybe I
would eryoy this Thanksgiving a little
more.
