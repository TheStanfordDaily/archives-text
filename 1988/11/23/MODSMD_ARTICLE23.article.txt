## Original, topical, accurate? The
						Bug debugs Gaieties 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
If the orientation of this
week's column seems especially
negative to you, then the Bug
advises that you adopt a nega
tive tone as well so that we
might combine to create a pos
itive effect on ourselves and
those we love.
Commentary both negative
and positive is welcomed by the
Bug Me box at the Daily offices
or through Lots to B.bug-me.
Dear Bug,
Why did Gaieties suck?
— Andrew Lloyd Webber
So, am I to infer that you
thought this year's Gaities was
lousy entertainment? Were you
amazed at how two hours was
made to feel like seven or eight
consecutive lectures given in
monotone by an uninspired as
sociate professor?
Well, you're welcome to your
opinion. However, it must be
realized by the discerning
among us that a lot of people
seemed to enjoy Follow That
Dog. I mean, a solid contingent
of Friday night's audience
laughed and cheered for a good

portion of the show; then again,
Bush was elected President and
acid-washed jeans are quite
popular.
Also, I suppose one isn't to
expect a really impressive
Gaieties production. With all the
accoustical difficulties and num
bers involved and the necessity
for musical numbers and the
competition for rehearsal time
from other college demands,
Gaieties seems to get away with
mediocrity every year. And
surely there is no more com
fortable or well-populated sta
tion in life than that of
mediocrity.
The phrase "Easier said than
done" also should be kept in
mind.
Still, a lot of people were un
satisfied with this year's
Gaieties, and I will attempt an
incomplete analysis of why,
since that's the question.
Of the humor components —
originality, topicality and ac
curacy — at least one seemed
to be missing from many of the
so-called jokes.
• Originality: According to the
Bug's humor manual, if comedy
is not original, it loses a good
deal of impact because the
viewer will not experience that
vital feeling of revelation.
The take-off on Monty Python
was the first I had ever seen
... since high school. Usually,
comedy sketches based on film
take a serious movie and add a
humorous twist or satirize the
film's most foolish aspects.
"Monty Python and the Holy
Grail" already is filled with
humorous twists and satire.
Then again, when the dean of
admissions has an English ac
cent, you should probably take
advantage of it.
And do you think we could
hear some jokes about Stanford
students and dating? Boy,
there's a subject that's never
been exploited, certainly not by

past Gaieties productions.
• Topicality: As the most recent
of an annual tradition, it is the
duty and privilege of each
Gaieties to address the mtgor
news, entertainment and per
sonalities of the past year.
Not only is "Monty Python
and the Holy Grail" an un
original base for humor, but the
film came out about 14 years
ago. And "Star Wars"? That was
1977. Isn't 1988 a little late to
be doing a "Star Wars" scene?
There are a number of films
released within the last year or
so which just beg to be satirized
— "Fatal Attraction," the series
of boy/man films ("Big," "18
Again," "Like Father, Like
Son") and "Who Framed Roger
Rabbit," just off the top of my
antennae.
And events such as the pres
idential race and the Western
Culture debate deserved atten
tion. Pretentious jerks like Cher
or Lyndon Larouche or Bill
Cosby (I'm sorry, that's Dr. Bill
