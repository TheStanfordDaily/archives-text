## Breimhourst dispels misconceptions about disabled persons 
### Helen Willey Staff writer 
Mark Breimhourst stands tall
in uniform — dressed in his black
guis like the others in the Kenpo
karate class. But unlike the rest,
he has no hands. No one seems
to take notice of his disability,
and if they do, they quickly lode
away as if they hadn't seen it.
Breimhourst, a freshman in
Rinconada, explains this reaction
to him is typical at Stanford.
Nonetheless, he describes himself
as no more handicapped than
anyone else.
When people ignore his dis
ability, Breimhourst views this as
one of the "more considerate"
ways people react to his physical
challenge.
"It seems the more intellectual
the society the more understand
ing and the more common sense
people have." Breimhourst ex
plained that he finds people's
staring, pitying and hypersensi
tive accomodation for him a less
considerate reaction.
And according to Breimhourst,
the ignorance about handicapped
people's worldview is prevalent in
society, prevalent enough that he
recently decided to do something
about it. Breimhourst and other
students with disabilities recently
decided to form a speakers'
bureau aiming to educate the
Stanford community about
"handicappers."
"There are a lot of people who
are curious and ignorant, and I
and a lot of other handicapped
people are willing to help them,"
said Breimhourst.
The bureau will begin sponsor
ing speakers during winter quar
ter, according to its coordinator,
sophomore Alison May.
Three weeks ago Breimhourst
spoke to freshmen at Trancos
House about relating to disabled
persons. The message he relayed:
Treat them as any other human
beings, while understanding their
handicap.
"Treat a person in a wheelchair

as any other person, but don't
expect them to be a jogger,"
Breimhourst said.
Before coming to Stanford,
Breimhourst occasionally spoke to
parents of children with dis
abilities as part of the Shriners
organization that funds hospitals
for handicapped and injured
children.
Sometimes having no hands

causes more problems for others
than it does for himself, Breim
hourst said. Living with his hand
icap since birth, Breimhourst said
he often forgets he has a disability.
"There are rarely things I can't
do and if there is I just have
someone do it for me."
Or he lives without it. Jim Bou

Freshman Mark Breimhourst shows his stuff in Kenpo karate class.
Breimhourst, who has no hands, rarely lets his disability hinder
his activites, and has plunged into efforts at Stanford to educate
others about the lives of disabled persons.
quin, an assistant dean of student
affairs and the director of the Dis
ability Resource Center, called
Breimhourst to offer to change
the dorm's door knobs as well as
the shower faucets to accommo
date Breimhourst. He declined the
offer.
"It was like they were going to
adapt the whole world to me in
stead of me adapting to the world
as I've always done and everyone
has always done," said Breim
hourst.
"Everyone's handicapped and
everyone's disabled. Everyone's
challenged though it may not be
physically," explained Breim
hourst. He added that most fre
quently others' defects lie in their
personalities. "I'd rather be hand
icapped like I am than have some
of the problems people have."
Other than occasional trouble
with getting his credit card out
of his wallet, Breimhourst has
truly mastered his disability. He
has shied away from few sports

and immerses himself in social
interaction.
Though he modestly admits
that he is an "average athlete,"
Breimhourst achieved varsity
status in cross-country, track and
soccer in high school, while recrea
tionally playing basketball, volley
ball and football.
But for Breimhourst, it's a con
stant struggle to dispel peoples'
initial beliefs and attitudes toward
his handicap. "It took three weeks
for the quarterback on my intra
mural football team to figure out
I could catch." For Breimhurst,
others' doubts of his athletic abil
ity are personally frustrating as
well as typical.
He admits that he faces greater
social challenges than physical
challenges. His roommate and
friend, Brian Harmon, said that
he sees Breimhourst's handicap
often creating social obstacles.
But Harmon added those un
conscious barriers don't thwart
Breimhourst's social ability. "He's
good at talking to people," said
Harmon, describing Breimhourst
as extremely perceptive of others'
moods.
