## Breimhourst dispels misconceptions about disabled persons 
### Helen Willey Staff writer 
Mark Breimhourst stands tall
in uniform — dressed in his black
guis like the others in the Kenpo
karate class. But unlike the rest,
he has no hands. No one seems
to take notice of his disability,
and if they do, they quickly lode
away as if they hadn't seen it.
Breimhourst, a freshman in
Rinconada, explains this reaction
to him is typical at Stanford.
Nonetheless, he describes himself
as no more handicapped than
anyone else.
When people ignore his dis
ability, Breimhourst views this as
one of the "more considerate"
ways people react to his physical
challenge.
"It seems the more intellectual
the society the more understand
ing and the more common sense
people have." Breimhourst ex
plained that he finds people's
staring, pitying and hypersensi
tive accomodation for him a less
considerate reaction.
And according to Breimhourst,
the ignorance about handicapped
people's worldview is prevalent in
society, prevalent enough that he
recently decided to do something
about it. Breimhourst and other
students with disabilities recently
decided to form a speakers'
bureau aiming to educate the
Stanford community about
"handicappers."
"There are a lot of people who
are curious and ignorant, and I
and a lot of other handicapped
people are willing to help them,"
said Breimhourst.
The bureau will begin sponsor
ing speakers during winter quar
ter, according to its coordinator,
sophomore Alison May.
Three weeks ago Breimhourst
spoke to freshmen at Trancos
House about relating to disabled
persons. The message he relayed:
Treat them as any other human
beings, while understanding their
handicap.
"Treat a person in a wheelchair

as any other person, but don't
expect them to be a jogger,"
Breimhourst said.
Before coming to Stanford,
Breimhourst occasionally spoke to
parents of children with dis
abilities as part of the Shriners
organization that funds hospitals
for handicapped and injured
children.
Sometimes having no hands

causes more problems for others
than it does for himself, Breim
hourst said. Living with his hand
icap since birth, Breimhourst said
he often forgets he has a disability.
"There are rarely things I can't
do and if there is I just have
someone do it for me."
Or he lives without it. Jim Bou

his activites, and has plunged into efforts at Stanford to educate
others about the lives of disabled persons.
