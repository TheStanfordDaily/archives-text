Pink Floyd's new live double-LP, "Delicate
Sound of Thunder," has been chosen to ac
company the Soyuz 7 cosmonauts on the first
French-Soviet joint space mission, set for a
November 26 launch (yeah, sure).
Says Pink Floyd manager Steve O'Rourke:
"We supplied them with the first cassette to be
transferred direct from the master tape several
weeks ago." Since obtaining the cassette, the
mission has processed, weighed and kept it
in quarantine. No word yet on when the Soviet
spacecraft will be updated to include compact
disc technology.
The French and Soviet cosmonauts will be
in space for 30 days, during which time they
will make a stop at the MIR Space Station,
leaving the cassette with the resident cos
monauts there. "Obviously, to say we are thrilled
at the thought of being the first rock band to
be played in space is somewhat of an under
statement," commented Pink Floyd writer/vocal
ist/guitarist David Gilmour.
Pink Floyd will be flying to Moscow to attend
the launch on Saturday. The album, chronicling
Pink Floyd's 1987-88 world tour, was released
yesterday.
Gee, where's Connie?
If you get back from Thanksgiving break by
Sunday you might want to check out the in
ternationally acclaimed Chung Trio, playing
Sunday afternoon at Dinkelspiel Auditorium at
2:30. The program will include two works by
Shostakovich — Trio No. 1 in C Minor, Op. 8,
and Trio No. 2 in E Minor, Op. 67 — and
Schubert's Trio in B-flat Major, Op. 99.
The members of the sibling trio, originally
from Seoul, are established solo artists who
set aside time each year to perform as a cham
ber ensemble.
