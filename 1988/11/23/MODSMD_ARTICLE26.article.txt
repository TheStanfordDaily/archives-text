# Bill Murray is huge in 'Scrooged'
## 
### Kathy Kleist Staff writer 
I went with a friend to see "Scrooged,"
and my friend was very skeptical: "An
other remake of 'A Christmas Carol'?
I've seen 12 versions already! What
could they possibly offer in "Scrooged"
that's new or different?"
A good question, but the answer is
even better. The movie delivers the
manic, screwball and wonderful talents
of Bill Murray, and it's not to be missed.
Murray's been missing from the big
screen for nearly four years; his last
major role was in "Ghostbusters." He
spent much of the intervening time
studying acting in Paris, and what he

seems to have learned is how to make
his comic best better, and how to bal
ance it with other emotions.
No one could out-cynical the cynical
Murray, who as Frank Cross, the pres
ident of the IBC television network, is
planning the best live telethon of Christ
mas ever. Cross, you see, is cross, and
he plans on wringing the holidays for
every dollar he can.
No one could display the deadpan
humor Murray revels in as he faces his
three Christmas ghosts. Nothing has
changed from the old Bill Murray, except
that his grasp and timing are even surer
than before.
What seems new, however, is the
genuine feeling Murray brings to the
touching moments in "Scrooged." Pre

viously, the only tears Murray ever
brought to my eyes were tears of
laughter. Now, it seems possible for him
*.o move me to other emotions as well.
And Murray's greatness is wonder
fully reflected in the cast of supporting
characters. Always delightful Carol
Kane is especially worth a mention as
the very physical Ghost of Christmas
Present.
Buy yourself an early Christmas pres
ent — and a great time — by going to
see "Scrooged." I can't imagine a better
way to kick off the holiday season.

"Scrooged " opens today at a theater near
you. Unless you live on campus, because
there are no theaters near you.
