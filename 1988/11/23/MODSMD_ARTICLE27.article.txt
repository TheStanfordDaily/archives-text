## Water polo takes on 49ers in NCAA tourney 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
The six NCAA water polo titles
Stanford has won were garnered
by Cardinal teams seeded either
first or second heading into the
NCAA tournament. Stanford is
going for a first this year.
Looking to continue the na
tion's second-longest water polo
dynasty, the Cardinal enters the
NCAA championships this week
end in Long Beach seeded fourth.
But with a 21-10 record and vic
tories over all but one of the
squads seeded ahead of it, the
team is confident about its ability
to score its first underdog victory.
"Since I've been here the team
seeded first or second has always
won, but it can be done because
squads are so close this year,"
Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti
said. "Everyone is more evenly
matched."
For only the second time in the
tournament's history, the Pacific
10 Conference's four squads oc
cupy the top four places in the
eight-team field. California,
ranked number one for the past
three weeks, was given the top
seed, and is followed by UCLA
and Southern California. Only
two teams outside of California,

Navy and the University of
Arkansas at Little Rock, were in
vited to compete.
To even consider challenging
favorites Cal or UCLA for the
championship, the Cardinal must
get by Cal State-Long Beach in
the first round Friday at 7:30.
And the fifth-seeded squad will
not hand Stanford an easy entry
into the tournament semifinals.
In fact, the 49ers have been some
what of a nemesis this season,
giving their northern rivals even
more trouble than more highly
rated USC. The Cardinal is 1-2
against Long Beach for the year,
with every game decided by only
one goal.
The last time the two squads
met at the Pac-10/PCAA tourna
ment, Stanford recorded its first
victory of the year over the 49ers,
prevailing 5-4. But Long Beach
had the upper hand in the previ
ous two contests, scoring 9-8 and
5-4 victories.
"Long Beach is good but emo
tionally we're closer as a team,"
driver Colin Keely said. "We've
played well the past few weeks
and everyone is going to rise to
the occasion."
Like the Cardinal, Long Beach
is a strong defensive squad which
has had problems generating its

offense this season. But whereas
Stanford depends on a balanced
scoring attack and has no domi
nant offensive player, the 49ers
rely on holeman Kyle Kopp, who
has already tallied 59 goals for
the year. Stanford's primary de
fensive goal is to shut down the
two-meter man with its pressing
defense, forcing Long Beach to
shoot from the outside and reckon
with stingy goalie Todd Kemp.
While Dettamanti feels the
game will be fairly low-scoring,
the Cardinal, which at times this
season looked like a championship
squad but on other occasions
could not seem to locate the op
ponent's goal, is going to have to
break out offensively, or at least
take advantage of any scoring op
portunities it is provided. In ad
dition to counting on its usual
multi-player scoring attack, the
Cardinal plans on relying on
newly-emerged leader Rick
McNair. While the holeman is only
third on the squad's scoring list
with 34 goals, his three strikes
against Cal last week kept Stan
ford in the game.
"Whichever team generates an
offense or at least gets a goal here
or there is going to win because

game at the NCAAs.
