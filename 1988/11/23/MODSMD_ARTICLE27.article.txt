## Water polo takes on 49ers in NCAA tourney 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
The six NCAA water polo titles
Stanford has won were garnered
by Cardinal teams seeded either
first or second heading into the
NCAA tournament. Stanford is
going for a first this year.
Looking to continue the na
tion's second-longest water polo
dynasty, the Cardinal enters the
NCAA championships this week
end in Long Beach seeded fourth.
But with a 21-10 record and vic
tories over all but one of the
squads seeded ahead of it, the
team is confident about its ability
to score its first underdog victory.
"Since I've been here the team
seeded first or second has always
won, but it can be done because
squads are so close this year,"
Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti
said. "Everyone is more evenly
matched."
For only the second time in the
tournament's history, the Pacific
10 Conference's four squads oc
cupy the top four places in the
eight-team field. California,
ranked number one for the past
three weeks, was given the top
seed, and is followed by UCLA
and Southern California. Only
two teams outside of California,

Navy and the University of
Arkansas at Little Rock, were in
vited to compete.
To even consider challenging
favorites Cal or UCLA for the
championship, the Cardinal must
get by Cal State-Long Beach in
the first round Friday at 7:30.
And the fifth-seeded squad will
not hand Stanford an easy entry
into the tournament semifinals.
In fact, the 49ers have been some
what of a nemesis this season,
giving their northern rivals even
more trouble than more highly
rated USC. The Cardinal is 1-2
against Long Beach for the year,
with every game decided by only
one goal.
The last time the two squads
met at the Pac-10/PCAA tourna
ment, Stanford recorded its first
victory of the year over the 49ers,
prevailing 5-4. But Long Beach
had the upper hand in the previ
ous two contests, scoring 9-8 and
5-4 victories.
"Long Beach is good but emo
tionally we're closer as a team,"
driver Colin Keely said. "We've
played well the past few weeks
and everyone is going to rise to
the occasion."
Like the Cardinal, Long Beach
is a strong defensive squad which
has had problems generating its

offense this season. But whereas
Stanford depends on a balanced
scoring attack and has no domi
nant offensive player, the 49ers
rely on holeman Kyle Kopp, who
has already tallied 59 goals for
the year. Stanford's primary de
fensive goal is to shut down the
two-meter man with its pressing
defense, forcing Long Beach to
shoot from the outside and reckon
with stingy goalie Todd Kemp.
While Dettamanti feels the
game will be fairly low-scoring,
the Cardinal, which at times this
season looked like a championship
squad but on other occasions
could not seem to locate the op
ponent's goal, is going to have to
break out offensively, or at least
take advantage of any scoring op
portunities it is provided. In ad
dition to counting on its usual
multi-player scoring attack, the
Cardinal plans on relying on
newly-emerged leader Rick
McNair. While the holeman is only
third on the squad's scoring list
with 34 goals, his three strikes
against Cal last week kept Stan
ford in the game.
"Whichever team generates an
offense or at least gets a goal here
or there is going to win because

the game is going to be low
scoring. It's going to be tough and
it's going to be close but I think
we have a good chance of beating
Long Beach," Dettamanti said.
"The only question is being able
to put the shot away at the right
time, but I really feel like we're
going to score a lot this weekend,"
driver Steve Millham said.
If the Cardinal gets past the
first round, which it was not able
to do last season, it will most
likely face Cal in the semifinals,
as the top-ranked team plays
eighth-seeded Arkansas in its
opening contest. While the Cardi
nal is taking one game at a time,
the thought of having to get by
the favorite to make the finals
does not daunt the squad. "I feel
good about playing Cal if we get
by Long Beach; they're really
overconfident," Millham added.
"Even though they've beaten good
teams, Cal is really confident
about facing us and it's going to
work against them."
Stanford has yet to beat the
Bears in three attempts this
season, but no game has been
decided by more than two goals,
and according to the squad, reg
ular season matchups do not
count when the semifinals roll
around. In the two teams' last
battle, last Saturday in Berkeley,
Cal escaped with a 5-4 victory but
definitely did not dominate the
Cardinal in any aspect of the
game, unless one counts six-on
five conversions.
Dettamanti, who has led the
Cardinal to five national champi
onships in the past 12 years,
stresses that anything can happen
in the final four, especially this
year since no team has truly
dominated the season. And if
Stanford can defeat its semifinal
opponent Saturday evening, the
outcome of the battle for national
bragging rights Sunday night will
be up for grabs. "Once you get to
the final four anybody can win,"

Dettamanti said. "Cal does have
a slight advantage in that most
of the guys on last year's cham
pionship squad have returned, but
I like our chances even if most
team members have never played
in the semis."
While the teams may be tech
nically even, Stanford does have
an emotional advantage over Long
Beach and Cal: revenge. Last
season, for the first time in five
years, the Cardinal did not make
the semifinals, eventually placing
sixth. Although the mjyority of
team members were not a part of
the 1985-86 championship
squads, the squad's reputation
during the past decade and a half
constantly hovers in the back of
players' minds.
Whether or not the odds
makers are giving the Cardinal
an outside shot to win its record
tying seventh national title, Det
tamanti and Co. are ready for the
challenge.
