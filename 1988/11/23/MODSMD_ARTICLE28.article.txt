# Team USA downs Cubans in thriller
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Undoubtedly, the national
teams of the United States and
Cuba gave Maples Pavilion its
best match ever last night. In a
two-and-a-half hour marathon of
non-stop action that showcased
Stanford's members of Team
USA, the U.S. concluded its eight
match tour by defeating Cuba 13-
15, 15-7, 17-16, 15-7.
Without a doubt, the standing
room-only crowd relished a chance
to see stars Karch Kiraly and
Steve Timmons in action, perhaps
for the last time with Team USA.
But the audience's heart was
clearly with the Stanford trio —
senior Scott Fortune and 1986
graduates Jon Root and Chris
Braun — who each had their mo
ments of brilliance in the well
played match.
"It was great," Braun exuded.
"It was kind of scary though, be
cause we had a full house tonight.
I personally wanted to play well,
and I think I was putting a little
too much pressure on myself. But
I'm glad that this place was sold
out, I'm glad it was a good match
to watch."
As if part of a Cardinal fan's
dream, it was that Root emerged
as the U.S. team's hero, providing
the extra artillery need to lift the
U.S. over an inspired and
defensively-tough Cuban team.
Root finished the evening with a
phenomenal 30 kills and showed
his alma mater how much he has
improved in the past several
years.
Especially impressive was his
back-row hitting, a skill he got to
demonstrate many times over the
course of the match. Even with
some of the team's more cele
brated hitters in the front row,
setter Jeff Stork had the confi
dence to set Root from the back
row and saw his efforts greatly

rewarded with resounding kills.
"He played amazing," Braun
said. "He is such a great athlete
that we have to try to find some
way to get him in there. I think
he hit particularly well tonight."
"He's been playing well the
whole tour," Fortune added.
Braun also played well, making
the transition from outside hitler
to middle blocker with amazing
alacrity. Though not as domineer
ing as Craig Buck or Doug Partie,
(the retired starting middle block
ers of the 1988 Olympic squad
whose remnants make up the core
of Team USA), but he played well
enough to knock 11 kills past the
block-happy Cubans.
That left Fortune, who came in
halfway through each game to
relieve Braun. Fortune only joined
up with the tour on Sunday in
Sacramento, so he did not have
much time to return to the
polished form of his Olympic per
formance, but he was consistent
and at ease on the court.
"It was fun to go out there and
make a guest appearance," For
tune said.
The stars of the U.S. squad
were hardly silent behind their
Stanford teammates, making the
most of every play in this final
match of 1988 competition. The
quartet of Kiraly, Timmons, Stork
and Bob Ctvrtlik (yes, his last
name has just one vowel) wowed
the crowd with a dazzling display
of incredible volleyball and
showed why they are considered
four of the best players in the
world.
In all, the match was a happy
homecoming for the Stanford trio,
who enjoyed a rare chance to play
together in front of especially en
thusiastic hometown crowd. For
themselves and for the Cardinal
team they watched develop over
the years, it was a proud moment
indeed.
