# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Though the 91st Big Game ended in a
tie, the Daily's selection for Athletes of the
Week were nearly unanimous. Amy Cooper
and John Hopkins, welcome to the honor
roll.
Cooper, a 6-foot-2, middle blocker from
Aurora, 111. was a dominant force for the
Cardinal women's volleyball team on last
weekend's Southern California road trip.
The freshman started ofT with 11 kills
against No. 1-ranked UCLA Thursday. De
spite her efforts, Stanford fell in a tense

four-game match 15-17, 15-12, 15-6, 15-7.
The following evening against USC, the
second-ranked Cardinal bounced back to
post a 15-17, 15-12, 15-9, 15-10 win against
the Women of Troy.
Cooper was outstanding in recording a
career-high 19 kills. For the week Cooper
hit .400 to raise her team-leading percentage
to .341. She also leads the team in solo
blocks with 32.
"Coop" and her teammates will be in ac
tion again in the NCAA tournament. Stan
ford is likely to host a first-round match
Dec. 1.

Hopkins, a 6-3 sophomore placekicker out
of Highland Park, Texas, accounted for most
of the Cardinal's points in Big Game at
Berkeley.
In a game marred by Stanford's inability
to score touchdowns while deep in California
territory, Hopkins was called on four times
to attempt field goals.
Four times he was successful, tying the
school record he had equaled previously this
season. Hopkins joined with Bears' kicker
Robbie Keen in tying the NCAA record for
most field goals in one game with eight.
The four 3-pointers brought Hopkins'
season total to 19 (in 24 attempts), which
broke the old school record (18) for most
field goals in a season.
In addition, Hopkins punted five times
for a 47.4-yard average — the best of his

career. He got off a high 50-yarder under
heavy pressure at one point and added a
personal best 54-yarder as well.
For his efforts, Hopkins earned Pacific 10
Conference special teams Player of the Week
honors.
The game was the best of the season for
Stanford's special teams. The unit scored
all 19 of the Cardinal's points, with Hopkins
accounting for 13 and Kevin Scott adding
the other six on a 95-yard kickofT return
— the longest in the history of Big Game.
