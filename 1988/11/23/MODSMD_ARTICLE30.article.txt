# Gray takes fourth All-America honor
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Carol Gray has done what
few Stanford athletes can boast
of â€” she won her fourth All-
America award Monday at the
NCAA Cross-country Champi
onships.
Gray took 19th in the race
with a time of 17 minutes,
seven seconds over the five
kilometer circuit.
Gray first competed in the
Championships in 1986 as a
freshman, when she took 25th
in a field of almost 200 of the
nation's top athletes. She did
not match her season's best
time today, but her time
dropped about 20 seconds from
1986.
The main difficulty at the
NCAA meet this year was a
large lead pack, which made it
difficult for Gray to move up
during the final stretch. A week
ago at the District-8 Champi
onships, she ran with the pack
and kicked into second place
over the last half mile. Monday,
however, there was a field of
dozens in front rather than just
a few.
Gray was the only Stanford
competitor. She placed second
in the District-8 Champion
ships November 12 to earn the
trip, while the men's team
finished out of contention.
Gray won her last All-
America award in track last
spring, taking sixth at the
NCAA meet in the 10,000-
meter run with a time of
33:23.8. "It is not an easy thing
to repeat," noted men's cross
country coach Scott Chisam. At

the national level it is especially
difficult to maintain this level
of excellence.
Gray, however, has come
through every season except
last fall, when she was sick and
had an off-day at the qualifica
tion meet. The junior had
showed the ability to be one of
the top cross-country runners
in the nation, a conviction her
coach Brooks Johnson has long
held, by running a 16:18.8
5,000-meters in track last
season.
This meet capped off an ex
tremely strong season for Gray.
It began with a win at the Stan
ford Invitational with the best
performance of hundreds of
women on her home turf. Her
next race, the Pacific-10 Con
ference Championships, was
less happy. She started out in
first but slipped to sixth.
Gray has also been an espe
cially versatile performer. In
1986 she was seventh at the
NCAA meet in the 3,000-
meters, and last year she ran
a personal best of 9:20.90. Last
year she could have run any
distance from 3,000 meters to
10,000 meters at the NCAA
meet. In addition, she also
began the season by winning
a mile competition at Washing
ton in 4:54 during winter train
ing.
Johnson, who left immedi
ately after the race for a two
week East Coast recruiting
trip, has been grooming Gray
as a potential superstar. While
she has been an individual
sucess, she was also appointed
team captain as a symbol of
her leadership.
