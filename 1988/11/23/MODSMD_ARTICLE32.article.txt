# The 						final picks
## 
### 
With tears in their collective
eyes, the Greeks return for one
last curtain call this autumn
before leaving to winter in parts
unknown (although I hear a few
of them may be staying in this
apartment in Tahiti recently
vacated by a seven-foot bear).
Sort of along the lines of saving
the best for last, this week's Guest
Greek should be an expert on col
lege football, as John Paye as
sumes that role. Also along the
lines of saving the best for last,
we are proud to present a battle
between the nation's No. 1 and
No. 2 teams: the Notre Dame
Fighting Irish and the USC Fight
ing Condoms. Of course another
game this week is the Colorado
State-Tulsa contest. Well, they

can't all be winners.
As far as the race for chief
Greek, Dave Earnest has an al
most insurmountable lead of
three games and pursuer Mark
Rogowsky has given up. He does
have a few interesting picks this
week, however, tabbing Sunshine
State St. over Sunshine State 6-3
and Boston College over Temple
44-27 (nine 3-pointers by sopho
more guard Mark Macon). He also
expects the Miami Hendersons (as
in Rickey, as in "My hammy, my
hammy!!!") to triumph over un
defeated Arkansas.

feels a week in Greekdom is "a
dream come true."
Due to the fact that the Ivy
League schedule was completed
last weekend there are no Ivys
this week, but it is hoped that
Boston College-Temple should
provide an equally-attractive non-
Ivy alternative.
Among the other picks this
week, Chris Crader selected
Colorado State over Tulsa be
cause, "although Tulsa is favored,
the Lady Ram volleyball team
would kick the Golden Hur
ricanes' collective butts and that's
all that matters."
And that's all that's needed to
explain why Crader is in fifth
place.

feels a week in Greekdom is "a
dream come true."
Due to the fact that the Ivy
League schedule was completed
last weekend there are no Ivys
this week, but it is hoped that
Boston College-Temple should
provide an equally-attractive non-
Ivy alternative.
Among the other picks this
week, Chris Crader selected
Colorado State over Tulsa be
cause, "although Tulsa is favored,
the Lady Ram volleyball team
would kick the Golden Hur
ricanes' collective butts and that's
all that matters."
And that's all that's needed to
explain why Crader is in fifth
place.
Well, it's been real and it's been
dumb ...
With tears in their collective
eyes, the Greeks return for one
last curtain call this autumn
before leaving to winter in parts
unknown (although I hear a few
of them may be staying in this
apartment in Tahiti recently
vacated by a seven-foot bear).
Sort of along the lines of saving
the best for last, this week's Guest
Greek should be an expert on col
lege football, as John Paye as
sumes that role. Also along the
lines of saving the best for last,
we are proud to present a battle
between the nation's No. 1 and
No. 2 teams: the Notre Dame
Fighting Irish and the USC Fight
ing Condoms. Of course another
game this week is the Colorado
State-Tulsa contest. Well, they

can't all be winners.
As far as the race for chief
Greek, Dave Earnest has an al
most insurmountable lead of
three games and pursuer Mark
Rogowsky has given up. He does
have a few interesting picks this
week, however, tabbing Sunshine
State St. over Sunshine State 6-3
and Boston College over Temple
44-27 (nine 3-pointers by sopho
more guard Mark Macon). He also
expects the Miami Hendersons (as
in Rickey, as in "My hammy, my
hammy!!!") to triumph over un
defeated Arkansas.
