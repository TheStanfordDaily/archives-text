# Hoops hosts Wisconsin

Many people will spend this
Thanksgiving weekend consum
ing turkey with their family and
friends; the Stanford women's
basketball team is going hunting.
Opening the regular season
after a preseason exhibition win
over the Australian Junior Na
tional Team, the Cardinal will try
to bag the Badgers in Friday
night's game against Wisconsin.
Tip-off time is 7:30 p.m. at Maples
Pavilion.
Stanford enters the match
riding the crest of a wave of
publicity. Ranked eighth on the
Associated Press preseason poll,
10th by Sports Illustrated and as
high as fifth on several other
polls, the Cardinal has emerged
as the brightest new face in the
West.
By contrast, Wisconsin is an
old-timer filled to the rim with
fresh talent. The Badgers return
only two starters from last year's
team, which finished a disappoint
ing 10th in the Big Ten Confer
ence after several stronger sea
sons.
"Wisconsin is pretty much a
young team, a rebuilding team,

but I think it's a very good
opening game for us," Stanford
Coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"We'll be able to judge where
we're at, what we need to work
on, and I think it's probably an
important game for two people
from the state of Wisconsin."
The two people are Stanford
guards Sonja Henning and
Martha Richards, two of the finest
players to emerge from the Dairy
State. For the pair, Friday's
match will be a homecoming away
from home.
For the rest of the squad, how
ever, the game will be a routine
springboard into a promising
season. With the exhibition game
against Australia as the only
gauge for their progress, the Car
dinal is excited to see some real
competition beyond the challenges
of practice.
The one tangible benefit of the
exhibition was the revelation of a
possible Achilles' heel in the form
of sustained defense. Though
Stanford easily held the Aus
tralian Juniors to a 53-24 first
half deficit, the Cardinal defense
lapsed in the second half and al
lowed scoring opportunities that
were eliminated earlier.
Stanford will also try to im

prove its post play, using its
height advantage to the fullest
over the more diminutive Badger
forwards. Coupled with the al
ready well-developed running
game, strong post positioning and
a strong defense should give the
home team a fairly easy win.
One of the biggest strengths of
the Cardinal effort will be senior
Evon Asforis, a center/forward
who came alive in the exhibition.
"I think Evon is playing very
well," VanDerveer said. "I think
at this point she's the person who
is most improved from last year.
She's worked really hard, she's
got herself really right in a top
front-line rotation and she's play
ing really well."
Wisconsin, however dishearten
ing their record was last year,
should not be overlooked. Accus
tomed to playing top-notch oppo
nents and featuring the talented
Kay Fredrickson, the Badgers will
not be hapless prey for the Car
dinal gunners.
"We're talking about a team
that plays a lot of tough compe
tition," VanDerveer said. "For
Wisconsin, I think this game will
help them get ready for their Big
Ten season just like it will help
us get ready for the Pac-10."
