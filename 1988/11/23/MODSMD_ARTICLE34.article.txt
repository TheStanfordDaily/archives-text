## Another winner in Shepard's flock 
### Mark Tompkins Staff writer 
"Far North" is Sam Shepard's debut as a film
director, and it's a pleasant but rather timid movie.
No sprawling epic here — anyone expecting a movie
on the scale of "Paris, Texas," which Shepard wrote,
ought to lower their expectations way, way down.
"Far North" is such a gentle, wispy movie there's
almost nothing to it. If it turned sideways you
wouldn't be able to see it any more.
Sam Shepard is, we are constantly reminded,
America's Greatest Living Playwright, and he's no
fogey either. He got his start by having his one-acts
produced in dingy little avant-garde theaters so far
off-Broadway they were practically in Hoboken. That
was 20 years ago.
Since then, Shepard's soundtrack has gone from
rock-n'-roll to country and western, from The Velvet
Underground to The Red Clay Ramblers. That's
what happens when you go from being a Greenwich
Village acid casualty to being a hillbilly superstar.
He used to be cool, now he's John Denver.
But Shepard's rep is no hype. His plays really
are good. Absurd, vulgar, almost as funny as they
are violent; they haven't yet been ruined by being
taught in classrooms. Probably because most of
them — the early ones, at any rate — resolutely
defy any kind of gassy analysis. His more recent
plays have a single-minded preoccupation with fam
ily; it's as if Shepard suddenly became good drinking
buddies with Eugene O'Neill and Tennessee Wil
liams.
Written as well as directed by Shepard, "Far
North" is about a family, too. It's only natural that
Shepard would want to direct his own material —
after crawling out from the wreckage of Robert
Altman's adaptation of "Fool For Love," he vowed
never to let his work be sullied by no-'count directors
again. (He acted in that one, too, as well as in"The
Right Stuff' and a few others, some good, some
lame. God only knows why he starred in "Baby
Boom" last year).
Set in the depopulated backwoods of Minnesota,
"Far North" opens with a crusty middle-aged
patriarch named Bertrum (Charles Durning) taking
a nasty spill when his horse Mel starts galloping so

fast that the buckboard overturns. Bertrum's
daughter Kate (Jessica Lange), pregnant, and single,
leaves her job in New York to visit her father in
the hospital. Humiliated by his fall, Bertrum urges
Kate to shoot Mel, saying, "You're the only one
mean enough to do it."
This idea doesn't sit well at all with Kate's sister
Rita (Tess Harper), a single mom who still lives at
her parents' farmhouse, taking care of her senile
mother (Ann Wedgeworth) and her own rebellious
teen-aged daughter (Patricia Arquette).
Not much happens in this gentlest of comedies.
People talk a bit, and then everybody wanders
around in the woods for what seems like forever.
My God, do you see a lot of birch trees in this film.
The dialogue is mostly concerned with one thing:
men, or rather the lack of them. "Where are all
the menfolk?" "Where's your man, Rita?" There
just aren't any men around. Their time is past.
This could be, like, you know, the theme of the
movie. Welcome to "Designing Women" with a
higher pedigree.
The occasional bit of heavy-handedness aside,
"Far North" is a nice little movie. The details are
cleverly observed, the outdoor shots are often artily
composed, and once in a while the dialogue is very
funny. Pretty good cast, too. True, as the dotty
mother Ann Wedgeworth is all glassy eyes and a
knowing smile; it's a performance which gets ir
ritating in about two minutes. And Charles Durning
is kind of a one-note actor, too, but everyone else
is unassailable.
Jessica Lange is quite winning, which is no great
surprise. She should be billed as The Woman That
Time Forgot: it's a little spooky, how she only gets
more and more attractive, the older she gets. Eerie
science-fiction music ought to follow her around
on-screen. (Shepard and Lange are a couple, of
course. Chances are that if you don't know anything
else about him, you at least know that. Damn, the
resume this guy has).
Finally, the horse they found to play Mel, the
horse, is really something. His performance is the
most convincing portrayal of a character I've seen
all year. Truly, a triumph of Method acting.

"Far North" opens today at the Aquarius Theater
in Palo Alto.
