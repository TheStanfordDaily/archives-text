# THEATER
## David Copperfield in Hell 
### Andrew Berkowitz Editorial staff 
Borrow a car — steal one if
you have to — or get dorm tick
ets. You don't want to miss the
hippest magic/comedy show ever
to hit Broadway and now San
Francisco.
You've probably seen them
performing their hijinks on
"Saturday Night Live" or "Late
Night with David Letterman,"
or maybe in RUN DMC's music
video "It's Tricky." Penn and
Teller, the magical-comedy duo
that defies description.
The show, which is at the Cur
ran Theater in San Francisco
until Jan. 15 as part of their
nationwide tour, is a wacky
compilation of magical tricks,
stunts and scams, each built
around some ridiculous premise
of a sort that renders the whole
thing wickedly humorous.
Penn, the big one, does the
talking. All of it. Teller, the
small one, doesn't talk at all.
He doesn't even mime it up
much. He's a prop, stagehand,
assistant and partner in one.
To open the show, Teller at
tempts to escape from a
straightjacket hung over shar
pened spikes as Penn reads
poetry to the audience.
And the rest of the evening
is filled with such tricks — both
the death defying and the not
so-death-defying. In fact, much
of the show encompasses varia
tions on the oldest magic tricks
in the book: card tricks, cups

and balls, levitation, etc.
This is not serious magic,
though it is quite good. The
point is not the illusions them
selves but the wonderful loud
mouth patter that goes along.
Anyone looking for the grand,
fiery illusions of Doug Hen
ning's long-running Broadway
"Magic Show," had best look
elsewhere. This is comedy with
a little magic thrown in, or as
they put it themselves, "two ec
centric guys who have learned
to do a few cool things."
The whole evening is tricky,

funny and refreshingly infor
mal. The show ran on Broadway
for Pete's sakes and the stars
still stand around in the lobby
after the show selling souvenir
T-shirts.

"Perm and Teller" plays at the
Curran Theater, 445 Geary
Street in San Francisco, until
Jan. 15. Tickets are $12-$3 O. To
charge tickets by phone and for
information about schedules

Penn Jiilette and Teller star in "Penn and Teller." The self
described "two guys who have learned to do a few cool things"
are currently performing in their magic-comedy show in San
Francisco.
