## The
						1969 school year: Welcome to the jungle 
### Gene Anaya Staff writer 
1969, ah, what a year.
When else could a guy have an attractive
female come up to him in his Volkswagen van
painted with psychedelic leaves and ask him
to make love to her? Now those were good
times!
Even with this scene, however, "1969" falls
short of expressing the full intensity of the
times. With Kiefer Sutherland and Robert
Downey, Jr. (any relation to Morton Downey,
Jr.?) as a pair of college friends struggling to
make sense of their lives, "1969" takes us
back to the days of peace symbols, violent
police-student encounters and students think
ing about more than just their grades. (Wow,
now there's a concept!)

The two friends, Ralph (Downey) and Scott
(Sutherland) come from a small, conservative
New England town and experience the thrills
and fears of being young in the late 60s.
Together, they explore the realm of drugs
(Ralph takes them and Scott takes care of
Ralph), begin questioning the Establishment
and share a desire to really change the world.
Then, Scott's Marine brother heads off to
Vietnam while Ralph flunks out of college
and into the danger of being drafted.
In 1969 life was a lot more free — but at
the same time more intense — for college
students than it is now. But hey, they had a
war to protest. Kinda makes the stench in
White Plaza seem pretty petty, huh.
The only fault with "1969" is that it just
doesn't go far enough, perhaps because writer
director Ernest Thompson chose the wrong

year to present the topic of the Vietnam era.
This is a present-day audience, after all, which
is busy trying to make the error of 58,000
deaths in Vietnam into a "noble cause."
"1968" would have offered the violence of
Tet, the National Democratic Convention and
the pain caused by Martin Luther King Jr.
and Robert Kennedy's assassinations, which
split the nation apart; while "1970" would
have offered the U.S. invasion of Cambodia
which sparked the horror of Kent State and
subsequent college protests.
Both of these years offer much more op
portunity to present the chaos and pain of
the Vietnam era. But, as usual, Hollywood
chose the wimpy, conservative approach and
glossed over the real issues and events of the
time, even failing to mention the 1969 events
of Woodstock and the horror of MyLai-4 (now
that's stupid).
