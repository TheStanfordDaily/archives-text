### Hugh R. Bethell Staff writer 
For the second year in a row,
the Stanford women's sailing
team has established itself as
the best in the West. The team
won this year's Women's Fall
Championship in convincing
style, winning six of the ten
races held to build a lead of 11
points over second place South
ern California.
The champkvisHp, held this
year in Long Boacli in light and
variable winds, drew the Pacific
Coast district's best women
skippers and crews together for
a one-division regatta in which
every team sailed against all of
the other boats in each race.

Winning the regatta for Stan
ford were junior Kim Grose and
senior Rita Snape. Another
Stanford boat, sailed by fresh
man Kathy Petzold and sopho
more Katie Burke, finished fifth
in the final standings. In be
tween were second-place USC,
a team from California that
ended up in third, and a team
from Orange Coast that left
with fourth place.
Unlike the two-division sys
tem under which most collegiate
regatta's are held, which allows
teams to rest in between races,
the one-division format of the
Women's Championship kept
competitors out on the Pacific
all day Saturday in a grueling
contest of endurance.

Grose and Snape attributed
their success to conservative,
consistent sailing and inspira
tion from the Cardinal football
squad.
"The race committee had a
portable television, and before
every start we'd hear that Stan
ford was leading the Big Game.
That inspired us to win our own
match against Cal," Grose ex
plained.
For Petzold and Burke, who
were sailing in their first Wom
en's Championship, the regatta
provided a different sort of in
spiration,
"We learned a lot, and we're
looking forward to beating
everyone next year," Burke
said.
