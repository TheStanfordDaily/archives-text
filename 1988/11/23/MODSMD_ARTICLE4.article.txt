## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
In a live interview on KZSU last night,
former 12th District Congressman Paul
"Pete" McCloskey called for the United
States' immediate recognition of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
In the 45-minute question-and-answer
session, McCloskey also expressed his
support for national service programs
that offer federal student aid and other
incentives to young people who engage in
public service.
In addition, McCloskey discussed the
campaign tactics in the recent 12th Dis
trict Congressional race.
McCloskey, a Republican, represented
the 12th district in Congress for 15 years,
leaving office in 1982 when he was
defeated by Pete Wilson in the primary

race for U.S. Senate.
He also ran against Richard Nixon in
the 1972 presidential race. He now prac
tices law in Palo Alto.
For the majority of the radio show,
McCloskey spoke on the recent develop
ments in the Arab-Israeli struggle in the
Middle East.
"Israel is no longer a reliable ally of
the United States," McCloskey said. "We
need to take a very tough position with
Israel.
"I could see peace in the Mideast if
Israel signs a nuclear non-proliferation
treaty, if they give up settlements on the
West Bank because they're illegal under
U.N. law, and if they give autonomy to
the West Bank," he added.
Charging that Israel continues to vio
late U.N. law today, McCloskey said,
"There are two examples of institutional

racism in the world
today. One is apartheid
in South Africa, and the
other is the way the Is
raelis treat the Palestin
ians."
McCloskey said that
because the PLO has
recognized U.N. Resolu
tion 242, it is "quite
clear" that the PLO has

also recognized Israel's right to exist.
Last week in Algeria, the PLO's par
liament accepted U.N. Resolution 242,
which calls for an end to hostilities and
Israeli withdrawal from territories occu
pied in the 1967 war. It implicitly recog
nizes Israel by referring to the right of
all states in the area to live within secure
and recognized borders.
The 450-member Palestine National

Council proclaimed an independent Pal
estinian homeland in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip with Jerusalem as
its capital.
McCloskey added that Israel should re
spond by withdrawing from the lands it
occupied during the 1967 Arab-Israeli
War, including the Gaza Strip, the West
Bank and East Jerusalem.
He argued that it is time for the United
States to recognize the PLO because it
has accepted the U.N. resolution, recog
nized Israel and ended terrorist tactics.
McCloskey said he thinks a movement
toward resolution of the dispute will oc
cur faster under the Bush administra
tion: "With Bush we might find the first
president to stand up to the Israeli lobby."
McCloskey emphasized that the battle
for Palestinian independence is being
waged in the United States, not in the

trenches of the Mideast.
"The real debate is for the soul of the
Jewish community. Will it continue to
support Israel right or wrong, as it has
for the last 10 years?" he asked.
In the interview, McCloskey also an
swered questions on the recent elections,
focusing on the 12th district congres
sional race between Stanford Law Prof.
Tom Campbell and Anna Eshoo.
He said Democratic candidate Eshoo
was a "quality, classy candidate" who was
hurt by the early prediction Michael Du
kakis would lose.
"It was a rare case when you were
choosing the best of two candidates," he
said.
Following the live radio interview, Mc-
Closkey also criticized the apathy of
American youth in elections.
