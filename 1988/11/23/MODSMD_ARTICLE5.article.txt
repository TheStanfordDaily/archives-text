# Journalist critiques Kennedy presidency
## 
### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
John F. Kennedy was a failure as president, yet
his assassination caused a fundamental change in
the atmosphere of the United States, a noted col
umnist said last night in a wide-ranging talk in
Arroyo House lounge.
Speaking on the evening of the 25th anniversary
of the president's assassination, Leonard Koppett
told an audience of about 20 that Kennedy, now
one of the nation's most venerated leaders, "hadn't
accomplished anything Everything he was ad
vocating wait stalled in Congress."
Koppet is a columnist for both The New York
Times and the Times Tribune, a paper serving the
South Bay.
"Affection for Kennedy was at that point
sporadic," said Koppett, who had been working for
The New York Times for seven months when Ken
nedy was assassinated. "Martyrdom created an in
delible Kennedy image that didn't exist two seconds
before."
But Kennedy's death smashed the security shared
by Americans in the post-war era, Koppett said. He
suggested that the tragedy was especially shocking
and difficult because the American continent had
been physically isolated from the violence of World
War 11. "We had no experience with national emer
gencies."
Kennedy's death also ruined the respect and trust
many people had for their government, Koppett
explained. "People at the time by and large had no
suspicion about government. Authorities were people
you trusted."
Koppett added that a tacit, blind faith many Amer
icans had in institutions was shattered by the killing.
This trust could never return, Koppett said, and

the subsequent assassinations of
Robert Kennedy and Martin Lu
ther King Jr. were just "incre
ments" in the erosion of faith.
Asked if he thought Kennedy
would have prevented the United
States from wide- scale interven
tion in the Vietnam conflict, Kop
pett said that "Kennedy seemed
no smarter than anyone else
about Vietnam." Koppett went on
to charge Kennedy with crafting
policy designed for mass appeal
rather than national interest.
Labeling him America's first
"image president," Koppett said,
"Kennedy was the first president
to make public relations his pri
mary concern."
Kennedy's success in this area,
as well as the glorification he has
received since his death and five
straight unsatisfactory presi
dents, contributed to the apathy
that Americans had toward the
recent presidential race, Koppett
said. "We would like a president
to be what we idolize Kennedy to
have been."

Several students questioned
Koppett about the numerous dif
ferent theories that have devel
oped explaining the assassination.
Asked what he thought happened,
Koppett said, "I don't know ....
I don't think we'll ever find out."
When pressed by members of
the audience, Koppett said he con
siders Lee Harvey Oswald to be
the killer, but is not convinced
that he acted alone. "I find it very
difficult to believe that it hap
pened exactly the way the Warren
Report stipulated," he said, refer
ring to the voluminous govern
ment report which concluded that
Oswald was not part of a larger
conspiracy.
"I do think the investigations
at the time were flawed and ex
cessively secret," he added. "I
think a more convincing report
could have forestalled many sub
sequent conspiracy theories."
Koppett, a former Times
Tribune editor in chief who is best
known for his sports columns,
ended the discussion with com
ments about journalism and
sports.
"TV has downgraded sports
writing," he said.
