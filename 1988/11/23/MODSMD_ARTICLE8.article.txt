Students staying on campus over the Thanksgiv
ing holiday won't necessarily stay thinner than their
peers who go home to feast on turkey and stuffing.
Students can find food at several places on campus
at various times throughout the break, including
Thanksgiving day.
The Bechtel International Center, the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance at Stanford and the Breakers Co-op
will all serve Thanksgiving dinner.
The I-Center gave tickets to 100 students last
week for Thanksgiving dinners.
Meanwhile, GLAS is hosting a "semi-traditional,
potluck dinner," according to graduate student
Daniel Bao. Students interested in the GLAS dinner
can still sign up at the Fire Truck House (Old
Firehouse).
The Breakers Co-op is also serving a dinner on
Thursday, and 15 spaces are still available. Chris
Lauwers, a member of the co-op, said anyone may
sign up, but he added that students who eat at
Breakers Thursday must commit to work as a cook,
hasher or dishwasher.
University Food Service will not shut down this
year on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, according to
Lois Ohms, assistant director of Food Service.
However, Food Service will not serve Thanksgiv
ing dinner.
"It its very expensive to bring in the employees,"
Ohms said. "Often students have plans for Thanks
giving so the demand just isn't tnere."
Food Service will provide brunch and dinner at
Wilbur Hall on Friday and Saturday. Students can
eat brunch at Wilbur or Stern Hall on Sunday.
Food Service will resume regular operation across
campus Sunday evening.
