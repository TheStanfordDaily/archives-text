# Local needy thankful for B-School's aid
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Over 1,000 local needy people had a cheerier
Thanksgiving due to the expert money-making ef
forts of students at the Stanford Graduate School
of Business, who raised over $16,000 for local hunger
programs.
The money, raised at a Business School auction
held Nov. 18, was divided equally between two local
charities: the St. Anthony's Dining Room and the
Palo Alto Ecumenical Hunger Program.
"It (the money) was five times what I needed to
do that meal," said Dan Fillin, a fundraiser for the
St. Anthony's Padua Dining Room. Describing the
over $8,000 he received from the Business School
as a "substantial amount," Fillin said the money
will help fund the center's meals from Thanksgiving
to Christmas.
Fillin said the dining hall fed about 1,100 people
on Thanksgiving while 200 more were fed at the
Samaritan House Dining Room in San Mateo. The
St. Anthony's dining hall usually feeds about 650
people per day, according to Fillin.
Other student groups besides the Business School
volunteers helped at St. Anthony's. Fillin said 25
Stanford Reach Out Today volunteers worked to
help clean out the freezers at the kitchen. Also, the
Stanford Project on Nutrition is working to collect
leftover food from student residences to give to local
kitchens, said senior Amira Leifer, project coordi
nator.
Michael Matthys, co-chair of the Graduate School
of Business Volunteers, said there was a similar
auction held last year that raised $5,000. The reason
for this year's dramatic success, said Matthys, was
that "we organized more students, working more
hours... . We also tried to make an event out of it."
The students also worked all week before the
auction selling $5 raffle tickets for an all-expenses
paid trip for two to Tahiti, said Matthys. When the
ticket for the Tahiti vacation was drawn, the winner,
Sally Falkenhagen, who is the wife of a business
student, gave back the prize to be auctioned off.
The returned trip raised another $3,400 in bid
ding. The students gave Falkenhagen a standing
ovation for her gesture.
The trip was donated by the consulting firm of
Booz, Allen and Hamilton, who
also sponsored refreshments for
the event. The firm "was inter
ested in having visibility at the
Business School. .. We kind of
struck a deal," said Matthys.
The prizes auctioned off in
cluded lunch with venture
capitalists arranged by Business
Prof. H. Irving Grousbeck, an aer
ial tour over San Francisco Bay
flown by a student, and Macintosh
hardware donated by Apple.
In addition to the auction, the
Business School Volunteers also
helped work at the kitchens and
raise contributions for the St. An
thony's dining hall. Last year, a
Business School student who knew
David Jensen of the NBC televi
sion network helped get Fillin on
the "Today" show.
The Business School Volunteers
are also working on other long
term public service projects, such
as tutoring through the Stanford
Adult Literacy Project and work
ing with Big Brothers and Big
Sisters.
