## 21 civilians killed in Guatemala massacre 
### 
GUATEMALA CITY (AP) - Leftist
rebels killed a civilian liaison to the mili
tary, then massacred 20 friends and rela
tives who went to search for him, the gov
ernment said yesterday.
It said army patrols had found the bodies
buried in common mountain graves in the
region west of Guatemala City.
The victims included at least 12 relatives
of Carlos Humberto Guerra Callejas, a ci
vilian assigned to the military in the village
of El Aguacate, the government said. Agu
acate is about 40 miles from Guatemala
City in Chimaltenango province.
Guerra Callejas disappeared Wednesday,
and his friends and relatives organized a
search Friday. The government described
the search party as a group of poor farmers
with an evangelical pastor, Antonio
Olivares.
A few of them said they managed to
escape while the other 20 fell into the
hands of guerrillas belonging to the Revolu
tionary Organization of the People in
Arms, according to the government state
ment.
Troops at a military base in the city of
Chimaltenango, about 20 miles west of
Guatemala City, also launched a search.
They found Guerra Callejas' body and
fought two skirmishes with rebels before
finding the bodies of the other 20 victims
on Saturday night, the government said.

Army patrols had found
the bodies buried in
common mountain
graves in the region
west of Guatemala City.

One military officer was reported wounded
in the fighting.
Civilians who work with the military like
Guerra Callejas are often powerful people
in small Guatemalan communities because
of their military connections. They have
often been accused of involvement in
human rights abuses.
The government said the alleged mas
sacre "reached the limits of the incredible
and shows total contempt for the most
elemental principles of humanity."
It gave no details of exactly how it
believed the people were killed or why.
The dead were identified yesterday by
family members who were taken into the
isolated mountains by military patrols.
The massacre is the largest blamed on
the Organization of the People in Arms.
The group and two others make up the
leftist guerrilla resistance in Guatemala.
