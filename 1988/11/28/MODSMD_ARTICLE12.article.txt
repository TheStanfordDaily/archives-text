# U.N. Secretary-General blasts U.S. on Arafat visa denial
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar said the United States is
violating its U.N. treaty by pre
venting PLO chief Yasser Arafat
from speaking to the General As
sembly.
He warned that the U.S. deci
sion could hamper Middle East
peace efforts.
Arab diplomats, meanwhile,
said they have enough votes to
move the session from New York
to Geneva so Arafat can address
the world body on the Palestinian

issue.
Perez de Cuellar, in a statement
released through a spokesman,
said the decision to deny Arafat
a visa to enter the country runs
counter to the 1947 agreement un
der which the United States
promises not to interfere in U.N.
matters.
"The secretary-general regrets
the denial of the visa application
of Mr. Yasser Arafat, chairman of
the Palestine Liberation Organi
zation, by the U.S. authorities,"
said spokesman Francois Giuliani

last night.
"Such a decision is incompatible
with the obligations of the host
country under the Headquarters
Agreement. If maintained, this ac
tion is likely to complicate and
render more difficult the further
debates on the question of Pales
tine and the situation in the
Middle East in the current session
of the General Assembly.
"This would be unfortunate at
a time when, in the view of the
secretary-general, the recent
meeting of the Palestine National

Council in Algiers provides fresh
opportunities for progress
towards peace in the Middle
East," Giuliani said.
The Palestine National Council,
a PLO parliament-in-exile,
proclaimed an independent Pales
tinian state during its meeting in
Algiers on Nov. 15.
It also implicitly recognized Is
rael by endorsing a U.N. resolu
tion that guarantees all Middle
East states the right to exist in
peace, and promised to restrict
guerrilla activity.

The PLO has non-voting obser
ver status at the United Nations,
and is a member of the Arab
League.
Secretary of State George
Shultz said Saturday that Arafat
would not be allowed to attend
this week's U.N. debate.
President Reagan told reporters
in Santa Barbara, Calif., on Sun
day that he supported Shultz' de
cision. "I think the other way
would have sent out the wrong
signal — that we are patsies," he
said.
