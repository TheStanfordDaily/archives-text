# Gorbachev stands by reforms
## Local authorities blamed for not halting Soviet ethnic unrest 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) - Soviet Pres
ident Mikhail Gorbachev said in
a speech televised yesterday that
his social and economic reforms
are being unfairly blamed for a
wave of ethnic strife.
Meanwhile, two Communist
Party officials in the southern
republic of Azerbaijan were fired,
and Soviet newspapers charged
that local authorities are not help
ing soldiers halt the ethnic vio
lence in the republic.
Rallies of up to 500,000 people
were reported yesterday in Baku,
the republic's capital.
Gorbachev said in a speech
given Saturday but televised yes
terday that "attempts are being
made to kindle dislike in the inter
ethnic sphere.
"This would be disastrous, it
would put perestroika in

jeopardy," he said, referring to his
program of economic and social
reforms. "It would even make
some people think that it is, per
haps, perestroika that is to blame
for all that."
He said his policy of opening
up information and opinion is not
the cause, but the solution to eth
nic problems.
Gorbachev's remarks come on
the heels of violent tensions be
tween the neighboring republics
of Armenia and Azerbaijan and
demands for increased autonomy
in the Baltic republics of Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania.
The military newspaper Red
Star said local officials are not
helping troops trying to keep the
clashing Azerbaijanis and Ar
menians apart in the Azerbaijani
city of Kirovabad.

At least seven people have died
and 160 have been injured in
Kirovabad in last week's wave of
violence between the mainly
Christian Armenians and Moslem
Azerbaijanis.
The Red Star report said three
soldiers died after a bus driver
refused to transport wounded
troops to a hospital and local med
ical personnel apparently refused
to treat them. It said a fourth
soldier was killed last week push
ing two of his companions out of
the path of a truck that apparently
was about to run them over.
A duty officer at the Azerbaijani
Communist Party headquarters
in the city of Baku denied charges
that local authorities were not
helping the military quell the vi
olence, saying "The party is in
control."
