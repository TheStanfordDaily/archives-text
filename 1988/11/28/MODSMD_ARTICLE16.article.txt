## Too hard to hear 
### 
Mem Aud needs an
audio svstem that
can meet its demand

IMAGINE DEVOTING count
less hours writing a gem line
for Gaieties — and then having
nobody hear it.
According to the Gaieties' pro
gram, this was supposed to be the
year that the audience would ac
tually hear the show: "We will see
some traditions continued (sheep
and Janet, again?), some end (You
can't understand the words. .
Despite the program's promise,
one tradition that refuses to die is
Memorial Auditorium's faulty
sound system.
During Gaieties, audience mem
bers in the upper balcony of Mem
Aud had to keep leaning forward
yet still could not hear many of
the performers' lines. Sometimes,
entire scenes from the show went
unheard. And at other times, the
faulty sound system emitted noisy
squeals, causing the audience to
cringe.
Jonathan Stern, producer of this
year's Gaieties, complained that
performing in Mem Aud is "like
singing in a rock quarry."
It is unclear where the problems
with the sound system lie — some
people blamed student technicians
working on the Gaieties show while
others pointed fingers at the sys
tem itself. But regardless of the
source, the sound problems have
got to stop.

For instance, at the start of the
year, University President Donald
Kennedy's speech to the incoming
freshman class was interrupted
when the sound system went awry.
Problems like this cannot be ig
nored.
Mem Aud is the largest per
fomance hall on campus. Its vast
size allows it to host more per
forming artists, speakers and pro
ductions than any other Stanford
auditorium.
Bill Cleveland, technical coordi
nator for Events and Services, ad
mits that there are problems with
the sound system — which is 15
years old.
According to Cleveland, Events
and Services is looking into upgrad
ing the system. Yet he refused to
comment on the problems that oc
curred at the Gaieties' show be
cause he had not spoken with
technicians directly involved with
the system.
In the future, it is only fair that
students have an adequate sound
system to work with. Students in
volved in the production devoted
huge amounts of time to Gaieties,
beginning as early as April, only
to have their efforts thwarted by
a problematic sound system.
These students lost out. Audi
ence members who spent money
on tickets and expected to hear a
fine production got a raw deal as
well.
Regardless of where the fault
rests, it is clear that Mem Aud has
an inherent audio problem that
must not go unheard. It is time
the University figures out what's
wrong and fixes it.
