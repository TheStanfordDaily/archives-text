## Seeing sharp contrasts 
### 
WE CYCLED IN SILENCE.
The green Kentucky moun
tains were beautiful, but at that
particular moment I saw beauty in none
of them. A dog lay dying at the side of
the road two miles back, and we could
do nothing.
We, the cyclists from the San Francisco
route of Bike-Aid '88, were riding out of
one of the poorest areas of the poorest
town of the poorest county in Kentucky,
where we had spent the last few days.
We had seen plenty of road-kills while
cycling across the country — deer, dogs,
squirrels, snakes, you name it. This old
gray dog, however, was still breathing.
He was unconscious and bleeding from
his nose and mouth.
"Let's call the A.5.P.C.A.," suggested
one of the few cyclists who had begun
to gather around the dog. We hadn't
realized that a poor county like Harlan
has no A.S.P.C.A.
The bleeding dog lifted his head and
began to bark, as cars whizzed by the
narrow freeway shoulder. Upset, one
cyclist rode away. The rest of us fought
about what to do.
"Leave it to die," said one. "There's
nothing we can do, anyway."
Nothing we can do. For days we had
been frustrated by that feeling of help
lessness.
During the previous few days, we had
seen incredible contrasts in the way
people live. As we rode south from Cin
cinnati, we had passed through the enor
mous Kentucky horse farms. We had seen
Secretariat, the horse that had twice won
the triple crown, and that was now valued

at $36 million.
The further into the mountains we
rode, the more outhouses and litter we
saw. We had passed what had once been
beautiful hillsides, now scarred by old
strip-mines. We had seen polluted creeks
colored orange from the coal's acid.
In Harlan, we had stayed with two
natives, Becky and Bobby Simpson. Both
have only third grade educations. While
roosters ran through their house and
yard, they had told us about the danger
ous life of the coal-miners — about black
lung and mining accidents that leave
several men in town amputees each year.
They had described local homes with
rotted floorboards and without running
water. Insufficient septic systems polluted
well-water, also used as drinking water.
It seemed much like a developing country.
In response to the poverty that has
been a fact of life in Harlan since long
before the Depression, the Simpson's had
created the Cranks Creek Survival Cen
ter, which distributes donated food and
clothing locally to anyone in need.
The owner of the dying dog explained
that it was just hit by three cars, but
that she couldn't afford a vet. The bill
from the last dog she took in nearly wiped
her out.
We finally settled upon tying the dog
to a tree so that it wouldn't wander back
into the street, and left it some moist
food.
Although it was only a day's bicycle
ride away, when we arrived in Norton,
Virginia, it seemed a world away from
the same morning, where we were
awakened by the roosters and flies of

Harlan.
Our Norton hosts asked if we'd like to
play tennis on their newly lit courts. They
let us soak in their jacuzzi. And they
proudly showed us the huge cabin behind
their palatial home, which they had im
ported log-by-log from Tennessee.
Our hosts were wonderful, but given
our long ride from Harlan I couldn't help
but feel that I had entered Oz. As their
dog, Sweetpea, licked my hand, I won
dered if the old gray dog still lay dying
off the side of the road.
I'm not sure what to make of the con
trasts. Maybe nothing. Some will say
"That's life" or "That's America." But
at least once a year, at Thanksgiving, we
turn our attention to the contrasts, to
remind ourselves that we are better off
than others.
Last Wednesday, the day before
Thanksgiving, Becky Simpson was fea
tured on the evening news. Explaining
why she started the survival center, she
said, "You can't just play dead because
you ain't got (money)."
If you do have money, however, you
can afford to play dead.
To be truly thankful, we should try to
recognize and remedy the poverty that
surrounds us, or that lies directly east.
