TAs are important,
says Humanities
and Sciences dean
I have read with interest and some
concern the recent articles and letters
in The Daily about Teaching Assistants
in the School of Humanities and
Sciences.
I write now to add some more fact
to the commentary, fact that, hopefully,
will show that the School does recog
nize the important role of graduate
student teachers in maintaining the
high quality of undergraduate educa
tion here.
Over two years ago, the Dean's Of
fice asked departments and programs
to examine their course offerings, en
rollment patterns, graduate student
teaching needs and the adequacy of
their TA budget allocations.
We have used this information to
provide TAs more equitably across
departments, especially for courses with
undergraduate enrollments over 35.
Of course, there are many courses
with fewer than 35 students that, for
sound pedagogical reasons, continue to
have TAs assigned to them. However,
we have focused on large classes be
cause that is where a shortage of TAs
can have the most deleterious effect on
the quality of undergraduate education.
Last July, we introduced the goal of
a 'modest curtailment of TA expendi
tures' into the allocation plan. We want
to keep the 1988-89 TA expenditures
to last year's level of about $3.3 mil
lion.
Since TA salaries have increased by
about 6 percent this year, achieving
this goal would entail a 'modest cur
tailment' in real terms for the School
as a whole.
We have encouraged departments to
plan their TA assignments within their
budgets, and to do so without com-

promising the quality of instruction.
Our conversations with the depart
ments confirm that they deploy their
graduate students teachers in a variety
of formats.
For example, the Department of Po
litical Science might assign a TA to
about 35 students and ask the TA to
meet with these students in sections of
about 12. Another department might
use a combination of graders, who are
paid by the hour, and TAs to assist its
professors in some courses.
We have every reason to believe that
modest curtailment without loss of
quality can be achieved by using
readers and graders, rather than TAs,
in courses where this substitution is
appropriate, or by increasing slightly
the number of undergraduates assigned
to a TA.
Admittedly, there has been the unin
tended consequence that at least one
graduate student teacher is receiving
less take-home pay than expected. This
student expectation appears to have
been set in June, before changes in
budget allocations were contemplated.
We hope to avoid such unhappy conse
quences in the future.
A brief look at some historical data
on graduate student teaching is helpful.
Over the last five years, the size of the
undergraduate student body and the
number of course units they take have
remained roughly the same.
However, the number of TAs per
year has increased by an average of
just over 4 percent per year; total ex
penditures on graduate student teach
ers have increased by just over 4 per
cent per year, after correcting for
salary increases; and TA salaries have
grown in previous years by 6 to 10
percent per year, raises that are higher
than those for staff and faculty
salaries.
These data indicate that the School
has been allocating an increasing
amount of resources to this facet of
undergraduate education.
This positive development should not

be obscured by my attempt to hold
1988-89 expenditures to the 1987-88
level, or by the regrettable shortfall
this quarter between actual and ex
pected take-home pay for a small num
ber of graduate student teachers.

Paper-throwing at
Sunday Flicks is
just harmless fun
Lynne Bourgault's comments on the
paper-throwing at the ASSU Flicks
frankly surprised me. I feel that her
opinions generally represent those of
only a minority of Stanford students.
Disagreeing with her is an uncom
fortable task, however; most people do
not want to publicly endorse behavior
that is "puerile" and "immature."
I must admit, though, that I er\joy
the frolicsome atmosphere this creates,
and I don't think that this implies
there is something abnormal about me.
On the contrary, I am confident that
most people find the melee fun and
stress-relieving rather than "offensive."
It is generally accepted that allowing
oneself to momentarily let loose and
show one's playful side can be benefi
cial. Part of Stanford's appeal for me
is the happy-go-lucky attitude which
the student population exhibits (this
paper-throwing is a prime example).
Despite appearances, however, there is
a constant pressure among students to
get good grades while never seeming to
do any work.
As an academic week progresses, this
tension builds; having the Flicks' paper
fights is a handy outlet for this ten
sion, as well as a harmless way to
succumb to peer pressure.
I also disagree with Bourgault's
claim that there is no way for those
people who do not wish to become
involved in the paper-throwing to avoid

it. Experience shows that the early
Flick is consistently more sedate than
the late Flick.
If for some reason these people are
unable to attend the first show, coming
a few minutes later than the doors
open for the second Flick is another
alternative. Most of the paper-throwing
dies down by the time the feature
starts (as well it should).
I agree that the whole idea of a
paper wad fight is somewhat childish.
However, the fights don't harm anyone
while helping those involved to get rid
of some frustration. Having the ASSU
tighten the reins on what has become
a Flicks tradition is not realistic, nor is
it as effective in guarding the feelings
of those who dislike the paper-throwing
as is a little planning on their part.

A brief response...
In a letter in the Nov. 18 Daily, a
student expressed that she was of
fended by comments made by a Repub
lican during the Stanford Republicans'
victory celebration on Nov. 9.
She states, "that Republican is enti
tled to his opinion, provided that he
has seriously studied the situation and
has valid justification for his beliefs
. . Since when does the right to an
opinion in the United States for one
student depend on another student's
definition of "serious study" and "valid
justification"? These qualifications are
subjective and thus cannot apply to
one's right to have and express an
opinion.
I agree that the manner in which
the young man chose to express his
opinions was "politically irresponsible."
However, he is entitled to his opinion
and free speech â€” basic rights which
are not always acknowledged at Stan
ford.

is the happy-go-lucky attitude which
the student population exhibits (this
paper-throwing is a prime example).
Despite appearances, however, there is
a constant pressure among students to
get good grades while never seeming to
do any work.
As an academic week progresses, this
tension builds; having the Flicks' paper
fights is a handy outlet for this ten
sion, as well as a harmless way to
succumb to peer pressure.
I also disagree with Bourgault's
claim that there is no way for those
people who do not wish to become
involved in the paper-throwing to avoid

it. Experience shows that the early
Flick is consistently more sedate than
the late Flick.
If for some reason these people are
unable to attend the first show, coming
a few minutes later than the doors
open for the second Flick is another
alternative. Most of the paper-throwing
dies down by the time the feature
starts (as well it should).
I agree that the whole idea of a
paper wad fight is somewhat childish.
However, the fights don't harm anyone
while helping those involved to get rid
of some frustration. Having the ASSU
tighten the reins on what has become
a Flicks tradition is not realistic, nor is
it as effective in guarding the feelings
of those who dislike the paper-throwing
as is a little planning on their part.

A brief response...
In a letter in the Nov. 18 Daily, a
student expressed that she was of
fended by comments made by a Repub
lican during the Stanford Republicans'
victory celebration on Nov. 9.
She states, "that Republican is enti
tled to his opinion, provided that he
has seriously studied the situation and
has valid justification for his beliefs
. . Since when does the right to an
opinion in the United States for one
student depend on another student's
definition of "serious study" and "valid
justification"? These qualifications are
subjective and thus cannot apply to
one's right to have and express an
opinion.
I agree that the manner in which
the young man chose to express his
opinions was "politically irresponsible."
However, he is entitled to his opinion
and free speech â€” basic rights which
are not always acknowledged at Stan
ford.

TAs are important,
says Humanities
and Sciences dean
I have read with interest and some
concern the recent articles and letters
in The Daily about Teaching Assistants
in the School of Humanities and
Sciences.
I write now to add some more fact
to the commentary, fact that, hopefully,
will show that the School does recog
nize the important role of graduate
student teachers in maintaining the
high quality of undergraduate educa
tion here.
Over two years ago, the Dean's Of
fice asked departments and programs
to examine their course offerings, en
rollment patterns, graduate student
teaching needs and the adequacy of
their TA budget allocations.
We have used this information to
provide TAs more equitably across
departments, especially for courses with
undergraduate enrollments over 35.
Of course, there are many courses
with fewer than 35 students that, for
sound pedagogical reasons, continue to
have TAs assigned to them. However,
we have focused on large classes be
cause that is where a shortage of TAs
can have the most deleterious effect on
the quality of undergraduate education.
Last July, we introduced the goal of
a 'modest curtailment of TA expendi
tures' into the allocation plan. We want
to keep the 1988-89 TA expenditures
to last year's level of about $3.3 mil
lion.
Since TA salaries have increased by
about 6 percent this year, achieving
this goal would entail a 'modest cur
tailment' in real terms for the School
as a whole.
We have encouraged departments to
plan their TA assignments within their
budgets, and to do so without com-

promising the quality of instruction.
Our conversations with the depart
ments confirm that they deploy their
graduate students teachers in a variety
of formats.
For example, the Department of Po
litical Science might assign a TA to
about 35 students and ask the TA to
meet with these students in sections of
about 12. Another department might
use a combination of graders, who are
paid by the hour, and TAs to assist its
professors in some courses.
We have every reason to believe that
modest curtailment without loss of
quality can be achieved by using
readers and graders, rather than TAs,
in courses where this substitution is
appropriate, or by increasing slightly
the number of undergraduates assigned
to a TA.
Admittedly, there has been the unin
tended consequence that at least one
graduate student teacher is receiving
less take-home pay than expected. This
student expectation appears to have
been set in June, before changes in
budget allocations were contemplated.
We hope to avoid such unhappy conse
quences in the future.
A brief look at some historical data
on graduate student teaching is helpful.
Over the last five years, the size of the
undergraduate student body and the
number of course units they take have
remained roughly the same.
However, the number of TAs per
year has increased by an average of
just over 4 percent per year; total ex
penditures on graduate student teach
ers have increased by just over 4 per
cent per year, after correcting for
salary increases; and TA salaries have
grown in previous years by 6 to 10
percent per year, raises that are higher
than those for staff and faculty
salaries.
These data indicate that the School
has been allocating an increasing
amount of resources to this facet of
undergraduate education.
This positive development should not

be obscured by my attempt to hold
1988-89 expenditures to the 1987-88
level, or by the regrettable shortfall
this quarter between actual and ex
pected take-home pay for a small num
ber of graduate student teachers.

Paper-throwing at
Sunday Flicks is
just harmless fun
Lynne Bourgault's comments on the
paper-throwing at the ASSU Flicks
frankly surprised me. I feel that her
opinions generally represent those of
only a minority of Stanford students.
Disagreeing with her is an uncom
fortable task, however; most people do
not want to publicly endorse behavior
that is "puerile" and "immature."
I must admit, though, that I er\joy
the frolicsome atmosphere this creates,
and I don't think that this implies
there is something abnormal about me.
On the contrary, I am confident that
most people find the melee fun and
stress-relieving rather than "offensive."
It is generally accepted that allowing
oneself to momentarily let loose and
show one's playful side can be benefi
cial. Part of Stanford's appeal for me
is the happy-go-lucky attitude which
the student population exhibits (this
paper-throwing is a prime example).
Despite appearances, however, there is
