## An interview with BSU chair Mary Dillard 'Stanford's not going to change unless somebody says something' 
### John Wagner Staff writer 
Although it was a few minutes
after four in the afternoon, Mary
Dillard had not yet had the chance
to eat lunch. After asking if I
would mind if she were to eat in
front of me, she removed a sand
wich and bottle of fruit juice from
her buldging backpack.
The chair of the Black Student
Union and I were sitting in the
Upper Lounge at Tresidder Un
ion, about to engage in an inter
view which had been billed as an
assessment of the direction in
which she hoped to lead the BSU
this year.
During the course of the next
hour, as she nibbled on her sand
wich, sipped her juice and fielded
an array of questions, Dillard was
generally introspective and dispas
sionately analytical about the role
of the BSU on campus. Only upon
occasion, when frustration spring
ing from past and ongoing battles
surfaced, did she show traces of
the underlying fervor that drives
her public speaking.
The BSU's controversial past
When Dillard was elected BSU
chair last May, she inherited an

organization which, by her own
admission, had been a source of
"a lot of misunderstanding" dur
ing the past year.
In an April visit, U.S. Secretary
of Education William Bennett
claimed that the BSU had
employed "tactics of intimidation"
in furthering their political
agenda in the Western Culture
debate.
Earlier that month, the BSU
had alleged the selection process
used to fill three ASSU positions
was racially biased, discriminating
against black applicants. The
Daily subsequently ran an edito
rial stating that the BSU was
"trigger-happy" and had not done
"its homework before making
very serious charges of racism."
The BSU had been put on the
defensive earlier in the year as
well by charges that the organi
zation's membership policy was
racially discriminatory. Under the
BSU's constitution, black stu
dents are automatically members
of the organization, while non
black students must demonstrate
their committment to black issues
to gain membership.
And the BSU came frighten
ingly close to losing its fee request
in last spring's jumbled ASSU

elections. According to initial
results, the BSU had lost its as
sessment by eight votes. The de
cision was overturned two weeks
later, when late returns were col
lected from overseas campuses.
The slim margin of approval
stood nonetheless in stark con
trast to the results of the 1987
election, in which 67 percent of
the student body had voted to allot
ASSU funds to the BSU.
Had the fee request approval
percentage been higher, "it would
have meant that more people un
derstood what the BSU was
about," Dillard said.
Reflecting concerns
"I am concerned with what our
image is to other people and about
what other people think, but it's
more a question of explaining
what we're doing. Sometimes
people will disapprove because
they don't know what we're
doing."
The more pertinent concern for
Dillard, though, is how black stu
dents on campus feel about the
BSU. "When people criticize us I
will listen to the criticism from
the outside, but I'm listening
more to the criticism from the
BSU membership, because that's

what my job is."
In general terms, Dillard sees
her job and the role of the BSU
"as a service to black students."
"We do whatever the black com
munity asks us to," she said. "If
we can do it, we do it."
The job of BSU chair, Dillard
said, is to reflect the concerns of
black students on campus. "Even
though I'm the chair of the BSU,"
she said, "I don't run the BSU.
It's the officer corps that runs
the BSU. If anything, the officer
corps gets general direction from
the body of the BSU. It's not me
pushing my agenda."
Why a political agenda
Although campus political activ
ity is the most visible component
of the BSU agenda, it is only a
fraction of the BSU's function at
Stanford, Dillard said.
"We don't spend all of our time
preparing speeches and tes
timonials to the University," she
said. "We spend a lot of time figur
ing out how we are going to sup
port each other and how we are
going to stay here."
In addition to its role as a sup
port network, the BSU also or-

ganizes numerous cultural pro
grams throughout the year and is
involved in community service
work.
While Dillard plans to put more
emphasis on community service
work this year, she said she has
no plans to "downplay" the BSU's
political activity.
The BSU's "political agenda is
incredibly important because
Stanford's not going to change un
less somebody say 3 something.
"What we're trying to let people
know is just because everything's
fine with you, that doesn't mean
that everything's fine with every
body. If you don't feel like you
have to go in and deal with the
dean of Student Affairs or deal
with President Kennedy, then
that's good . . . but there is a large
group of students on this campus
who is feeling that need."
Dillard said she feels it is the

duty of the BSU to address these
needs, regardless of the effects
doing so may have on the organ
ization's popularity. "If there
wasn't a need for the BSU to be
political, we would not be politi
cal,** she said.
Changing administrative policy
While Dillard said she saw last
year's main political battle as
reform of the Area One require
ment, the focus so far this year
has centered around the "Man
date for Change" of the Students
of Color Coalition. Dillard nailed
the list of nine demands intended
to combat racism at Stanford to
Donald Kennedy's office door on
Oct. 26.
Included in the demands of the
coalition were the institution of
an ethnic studies graduation re
quirement, the strengthening of
ethnic studies programs at Stan
ford and a clause in the Funda
mental Standard that clearly

states that racist acts are a viola
tion of the standard.
Contrary to the misunderstand
ing of some white students, Dil
lard said, the BSU agenda is fo
cused primarily on changing ad
ministrative policy as a means of
fighting racism. "We don't go to
different people's doors and tack
mandates on their door. We went
to President Kennedy's office."
Dillard said she was disap
pointed by Kennedy's response to
the Coalition's demands. In a
statement he released on Oct. 28,
Kennedy indicated that the de
mands would be handled through
separate faculty and administra
tive channels, not his office.
"It's frustrating," she said, "to
say you need something and then
have people say, 'No you don't.' "
"We've talked with President
Kennedy," she said. "We've met
with President Kennedy. He has
the power to do a lot of things.
As far as I'm concerned, he runs

this place."
Struggling for support
The frustration that resulted
from Kennedy's decision is typical
of the sense of struggle the BSU
has felt in its dealings with Lhe
administration, Dillard said. "For
a long time we've said we want
support from the University. We
don't want to battle the Univer
sity. We want our concerns to be
recognized by the University."
Some of the BSU's more con
troversial attempts at gaining the
attention of the administration —
holding demonstrations, staging
sit-ins, and posting demands —
have only been used as last
resorts, Dillard said.
"It cracks me up when people
[say], 'Couldn't you write a letter?
Couldn't you form a committee?'
The thing is that we do go
through all these channels. We do
form committees and we do write
proposals."

When these approaches fail to
produce a response, Dillard said,
more dramatic tactics such as
those employed during the rally
for the Mandate for Change, are
used to advance their political
agenda. "We don't make demands
out of thin air," Dillard said.
A need for ethnic studies
One of the primary concerns
on the BSU's political agenda this
year is advocating the addition of
an ethnic studies requirement to
the Stanford curriculum.
Although Dillard said the ethnic
studies demand was "in the
works" prior to the incidents that
took place earlier this quarter in
Ujamaa House, she said the inci
dents were "obvious implications
of not teaching respect for other
cultures in the curriculum.
"One thing that the incidents
in Ujamaa showed people was how
our individual programming, our
going to different dorms and

talking about what is the BSU
and the history of this and the
history of that can only go so far.
There has to be something in the
curriculum."
Without the institution of an
ethnic studies requirement, Dil
lard said, the minority groups are
"programming in a vacuum."
"Students of color need to learn
about each other, and white stu
dents need to learn about us. I
really think that's the way to go."
Though optimistic about the
role of the requirement would
have in eliminating racism on
campus, Dillard said she cannot
be certain that the requirement
by itself would prevent incidents
such as those that took place in
Ujamaa.
"I don't know if these students
will be changed," she said. "I cer
tainly hope so. But what else is
there? Our pain should not be
what educates people."
