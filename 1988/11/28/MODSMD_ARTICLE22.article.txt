## An interview with BSU chair Mary Dillard 'Stanford's not going to change unless somebody says something' 
### John Wagner Staff writer 
Although it was a few minutes
after four in the afternoon, Mary
Dillard had not yet had the chance
to eat lunch. After asking if I
would mind if she were to eat in
front of me, she removed a sand
wich and bottle of fruit juice from
her buldging backpack.
The chair of the Black Student
Union and I were sitting in the
Upper Lounge at Tresidder Un
ion, about to engage in an inter
view which had been billed as an
assessment of the direction in
which she hoped to lead the BSU
this year.
During the course of the next
hour, as she nibbled on her sand
wich, sipped her juice and fielded
an array of questions, Dillard was
generally introspective and dispas
sionately analytical about the role
of the BSU on campus. Only upon
occasion, when frustration spring
ing from past and ongoing battles
surfaced, did she show traces of
the underlying fervor that drives
her public speaking.
The BSU's controversial past
When Dillard was elected BSU
chair last May, she inherited an

organization which, by her own
admission, had been a source of
"a lot of misunderstanding" dur
ing the past year.
In an April visit, U.S. Secretary
of Education William Bennett
claimed that the BSU had
employed "tactics of intimidation"
in furthering their political
agenda in the Western Culture
debate.
Earlier that month, the BSU
had alleged the selection process
used to fill three ASSU positions
was racially biased, discriminating
against black applicants. The
Daily subsequently ran an edito
rial stating that the BSU was
"trigger-happy" and had not done
"its homework before making
very serious charges of racism."
The BSU had been put on the
defensive earlier in the year as
well by charges that the organi
zation's membership policy was
racially discriminatory. Under the
BSU's constitution, black stu
dents are automatically members
of the organization, while non
black students must demonstrate
their committment to black issues
to gain membership.
And the BSU came frighten
ingly close to losing its fee request
in last spring's jumbled ASSU

elections. According to initial
results, the BSU had lost its as
sessment by eight votes. The de
cision was overturned two weeks
later, when late returns were col
lected from overseas campuses.
The slim margin of approval
stood nonetheless in stark con
trast to the results of the 1987
election, in which 67 percent of
the student body had voted to allot
ASSU funds to the BSU.
Had the fee request approval
percentage been higher, "it would
have meant that more people un
derstood what the BSU was
about," Dillard said.
Reflecting concerns
"I am concerned with what our
image is to other people and about
what other people think, but it's
more a question of explaining
what we're doing. Sometimes
people will disapprove because
they don't know what we're
doing."
The more pertinent concern for
Dillard, though, is how black stu
dents on campus feel about the
BSU. "When people criticize us I
will listen to the criticism from
the outside, but I'm listening
more to the criticism from the
BSU membership, because that's

what my job is."
In general terms, Dillard sees
her job and the role of the BSU
"as a service to black students."
"We do whatever the black com
munity asks us to," she said. "If
we can do it, we do it."
The job of BSU chair, Dillard
said, is to reflect the concerns of
black students on campus. "Even
though I'm the chair of the BSU,"
she said, "I don't run the BSU.
It's the officer corps that runs
the BSU. If anything, the officer
corps gets general direction from
the body of the BSU. It's not me
pushing my agenda."
Why a political agenda
Although campus political activ
ity is the most visible component
of the BSU agenda, it is only a
fraction of the BSU's function at
Stanford, Dillard said.
"We don't spend all of our time
preparing speeches and tes
timonials to the University," she
said. "We spend a lot of time figur
ing out how we are going to sup
port each other and how we are
going to stay here."
In addition to its role as a sup
port network, the BSU also or-
