### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
A seventh national champion
ship title was not added to the
Cardinal's collection, but the
water polo squad did manage to
surprise the experts.

Water Polo
Cardinal 4th in NCAA Tournament

Picked to finish sixth at the
beginning of the season, the
rebuilding squad defied the early
predictions by placing fourth in
the NCAA championships this
weekend in Long Beach. While the
squad eventually went 1-2 in tour
nament play, it defeated Long
Beach State 5-4 Friday in its first
post-season contest to earn a
berth in the semifinals for the
first time in two years.
Falling 10-6 to top-ranked Cal
ifornia for the right to advance
to the finals Saturday, the team
could not rebound Sunday, losing
10-7 to Southern California in the
consolation finals match.
Stanford's first nemesis proved
to deserve its seeding, defeating
UCLA 14-11 for its second
straight national crown. Long
Beach, Irvine, Arkansas, and
Navy took fifth through eighth
places.
For the third time this season

the score of a Stanford-Long
Beach contest was 5-4. But this
time the Cardinal was on top. Al
though the score was close, the
Cardinal thoroughly dominated
the 49ers, taking accurate shots
and playing tight defense to pull
out the victory. While goalie Todd
Kemp recorded eight saves to
preserve the win, Rick McNair led
scoring with two strikes. Erik
Blum, Steve Millam, and Greg
Morris each added one.
As expected, the nation's top
team stood between Stanford and
its ninth final-round appearance.
The Cardinal could not get around
its larger-than- life barrier, how
ever, and dropped its fourth
straight contest to its cross-bay
rival.
The Cardinal began the contest
matching the defending national
champions shot for shot. But mo
mentum shifted with 12 seconds
remaining in the period. After
Stanford tied the score at 2-2 Cal
wisked the ball downpool and with
one second remaining took the
lead for good.
"That shot really took the wind
out of our sails. We thought we
were heading into the next period
tied, but the score really deves
tated us," coach Dante Dettamanti
said.
Behind 5-2 with the clock run
ning out on the second quarter
Stanford again rallied, putting an
other shot away with 21 seconds
left to play. But again the tena

cious Bears would not give an
inch, regaining their three goal
lead with one tick on the timer.
Stanford attempted one last rally,
but the young squad just could
not equal Cal's experience.
"We played a good game but
they simply played a little better
than us," Dettamanti said.
"They're the No. 1 team and they
played like it. The better team
won."
In addition to the Bear's ability
to make timely shots, the squad
also capitalized on any mental
lapses the Cardinal had. While the
squad was able to hold the Bears'
leading scorer, Kirk Everist, to
one goal, left-handed holemen
Chris Humbert and Julian Baily
took over, scoring three apiece.
Holeman Erik Blum, the
squad's lone All Pacific 10 selec
tion, led the way for Stanford,
tallying three of his own. Rick
McNair, Jon Swerdloff, and Steve
Millham each added one.
"We worked and worked for
every shot we made while it
seemed like they just tossed one
and it would go in. While our
efficiency was better than usual
they just converted everthing,"
Dettamanti added.
In its final game of the season
Stanford came out flat and re
mained flat aginst the Trojans.
