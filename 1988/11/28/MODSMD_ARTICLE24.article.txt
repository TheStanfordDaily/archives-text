# Women's hoops bullies Badgers, 119-62

One day after the Thanksgiving
holiday, the Stanford women's
basketball team found a lot to be
grateful for.

Women's Basketball
Cardinal 119, Badgers 62

Courtesy of effective shooting,
tenacious defense and a stunning
Maples Pavilion regular season
debut by freshman Martha Ric
hards, the No. 8 Cardinal utterly
annihilated Richards' home state
school Wisconsin 119-62 to set a
new Stanford and Pacific 10 Con
ference scoring record.
With six players in double fig
ures after the final buzzer and
an astounding team field goal per
centage of .530, Stanford turned
its season opener into target prac
tice and shot past the smaller,
outmatched Badgers. The Cardi
nal excelled equally on defense,
pressing and pressuring the entire
game.
For Richards and teammate
Sonja Henning, another native of
America's Dairyland, the win was
especially sweet. Facing players
they played during their high
school years in Racine, the game
was a happy homecoming of sorts.
"The state of Wisconsin has
been good to us," Stanford Coach

Tara VanDerveer said. "Sonja is
a franchise player — we wouldn't
be going anywhere without her."
With the sophomore point
guard on the court and running
the offense, however, Stanford
went far and fast. In her 27
minutes of play, Henning scored
11 points and dished off a game
high seven assists.
But it was Richards' late-in-the
game explosion that really cap
tured the crowd's attention. After
being held scoreless in the first
half, she unleashed a 13-point bar
rage including the shots that put
Stanford over 100 points and past
the previous school high score of
112.
The shot that broke the double
digit barrier, in fact proved to be
the most exciting play of the
game. Richards stole the ball from
Wisconsin guard Mynette Clark
down in Badger territory and,
with some smooth behind-the
back ball handling, broke free to
record a lay-in that gave Stanford
a dominant 101-58 lead with 3:20
remaining.
"I saw the ball and saw Mynette
standing there," Richards
recounted. "It was just natural,
like stuff I'd done in high school.
It was a great feeling."
The freshman racked up six
more points before time expired,
including a second 3-pointer and
a 12-foot jumper with just one
second remaining. In all, it was

an auspicious introduction to col
lege competition.
"Being a freshman in her first
game aginst her home state put
a lot of pressure on her, but I
think Martha handled it well,"
VanDerveer said. "She got her
shot going, and she is a shooter.
She knows where that basket is,
I'll tell you that."
But Stanford's real sharp
shooter was sophomore forward
Trisha Stevens, who finished the
game with 21 points after a phe
nomenal 16-point first-half per
formance. Stevens spent much of
the second half on the bench after
setting the new personal best of
her short college career.
"I had some excellent passes
from Jennifer (Azzi), Katy
(Steding) and Sonja," Stevens
said. "There was nothing else I
could do but score when they were
setting me up like that."
True, but it was Stevens' phys
ical dominance that accounted for
much of her success. Stevens
powered her way past the smaller
defenders and set herself up with
smooth shots throughout the con
test.
"Trisha has improved so
much," VanDerveer said. "She's
running the floor real well, she's
real strong — when I looked out
there in the warm-ups, there was
no one out there who could match
up with her. She was too strong,
too physical and she just worked
too hard.''

Stevens got a lengthy break in
the second half along with most
of the starting lineup, giving the
talented bench a chance to show
its stuff. From Evon Asforis'
rebounding to Tammy Svoboda's
inside shooting to Richards' offen
sive outburst, the Cardinal
reserves proved that the differ
epce between the starting five and
the remaining nine is not all that
dramatic on the team with per
haps the deepest bench in the
West.
"With 10 minutes left, I knew
we were in control and I wanted
to play a lot of people and get
some experience," VanDerveer ex
plained.
Unfortunately for the visitors,
Wisconsin does not share Stan
ford's bounty of talent. Losing the
state's two best players to Stan
ford, the Badgers found them
selves with but one stand-out in
the school's worst bludgeoning
ever.
Kay Fredrickson, the Big Ten
Conference Freshman of the Year
last season, provided - about the
only light shining on the Wiscon
sin side of the court that was not
incandescently induced. Fredrick
son finished the game with a
team-high 15 points.
But the contest clearly belonged
to Stanford's pair of Wisconsin
expatriots. "I think that for
Martha and Sonja it was a real
important game," VanDerveer
said.

the remaining nine is not all that
dramatic on the team with per

West.
"With 10 minutes left, I knew
we were in control and I wanted
to play a lot of people and get
some experience," VanDerveer ex
plained.
Unfortunately for the visitors,
Wisconsin does not share Stan
ford's bounty of talent. Losing the
state's two best players to Stan
ford, the Badgers found them
selves with but one stand-out in
the school's worst bludgeoning
ever.

Conference Freshman of the Year

only light shining on the Wiscon
sin side of the court that was not

But the contest clearly belonged
to Stanford's pair of Wisconsin
expatriots. "I think that for
Martha and Sonja it was a real

Sophomore forward Trisha Stevens led a Cardinal scoring explosion
against Wisconsin, garnering 16 points in the first half and a
career-high 21 overall.
One day after the Thanksgiving
holiday, the Stanford women's
basketball team found a lot to be
grateful for.

Cardinal 119, Badgers 62

Courtesy of effective shooting,
tenacious defense and a stunning
Maples Pavilion regular season
debut by freshman Martha Ric
hards, the No. 8 Cardinal utterly
annihilated Richards' home state
school Wisconsin 119-62 to set a
new Stanford and Pacific 10 Con
ference scoring record.
With six players in double fig
ures after the final buzzer and
an astounding team field goal per
centage of .530, Stanford turned
its season opener into target prac
tice and shot past the smaller,
outmatched Badgers. The Cardi
nal excelled equally on defense,
pressing and pressuring the entire
game.
For Richards and teammate
Sonja Henning, another native of
America's Dairyland, the win was
especially sweet. Facing players
they played during their high
school years in Racine, the game
was a happy homecoming of sorts.
"The state of Wisconsin has
been good to us," Stanford Coach

Tara VanDerveer said. "Sonja is
a franchise player — we wouldn't
be going anywhere without her."
With the sophomore point
guard on the court and running
the offense, however, Stanford
went far and fast. In her 27
minutes of play, Henning scored
11 points and dished off a game
high seven assists.
But it was Richards' late-in-the
game explosion that really cap
tured the crowd's attention. After
being held scoreless in the first
half, she unleashed a 13-point bar
rage including the shots that put
Stanford over 100 points and past
the previous school high score of
112.
The shot that broke the double
digit barrier, in fact proved to be
the most exciting play of the
game. Richards stole the ball from
Wisconsin guard Mynette Clark
down in Badger territory and,
with some smooth behind-the
back ball handling, broke free to
record a lay-in that gave Stanford
a dominant 101-58 lead with 3:20
remaining.
"I saw the ball and saw Mynette
standing there," Richards
recounted. "It was just natural,
like stuff I'd done in high school.
It was a great feeling."
The freshman racked up six
more points before time expired,
including a second 3-pointer and
a 12-foot jumper with just one
second remaining. In all, it was

an auspicious introduction to col
lege competition.
"Being a freshman in her first
game aginst her home state put
a lot of pressure on her, but I
think Martha handled it well,"
VanDerveer said. "She got her
shot going, and she is a shooter.
She knows where that basket is,
I'll tell you that."
But Stanford's real sharp
shooter was sophomore forward
Trisha Stevens, who finished the
game with 21 points after a phe
nomenal 16-point first-half per
formance. Stevens spent much of
the second half on the bench after
setting the new personal best of
her short college career.
"I had some excellent passes
from Jennifer (Azzi), Katy
(Steding) and Sonja," Stevens
said. "There was nothing else I
could do but score when they were
setting me up like that."
True, but it was Stevens' phys
ical dominance that accounted for
much of her success. Stevens
powered her way past the smaller
defenders and set herself up with
smooth shots throughout the con
test.
"Trisha has improved so
much," VanDerveer said. "She's
running the floor real well, she's
real strong — when I looked out
there in the warm-ups, there was
no one out there who could match
up with her. She was too strong,
too physical and she just worked
too hard.''

Stevens got a lengthy break in
the second half along with most
of the starting lineup, giving the
talented bench a chance to show
its stuff. From Evon Asforis'
rebounding to Tammy Svoboda's
inside shooting to Richards' offen
sive outburst, the Cardinal
reserves proved that the differ
epce between the starting five and
the remaining nine is not all that
dramatic on the team with per
haps the deepest bench in the
West.
"With 10 minutes left, I knew
we were in control and I wanted
