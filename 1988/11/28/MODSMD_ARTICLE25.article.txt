# Card travels to UNC looking for an upset
## 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
Before this season, tonight's
Stanford-North Carolina men's
basketball game would have been
one of those in which the Cardinal
would only have been wanting to
not be embarrassed, just so it
could file it under the "moral vic
tory" department.
Then all the preseason hype
came out, giving No. 24 Stanford
a lot more to shoot for in its 4:30
p.m. (PST) battle with the fifth
ranked Tar Heels (3-1) at Chapel
Hill, N.C. No longer would just a
moral victory would be satisfying.
But Stanford (1-1) may be back
to hoping it just holds its own
against UNC. Senior center Eric
Reveno (10.5 points, 6.5 rebounds
per game) stretched ligaments in
the top of his foot late in practice
Saturday. Reveno, who has been
on crutches since, is listed as
doubtful, and Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery plans to start
junior Derek Bruton in his place.
Before that, reserve guard
Oliver Cunningham, a defensive
specialist who had taken only one
snot this season, quit the team
for personal reasons and did not
make the trip.
So Stanford only has 10 healthy
bodies in one of its toughest, and
in a way most important, games
of the year.
Stanford (1-1) has been a pro
hibitive bet to qualify for the
NCAA tournament this year. But
strong early showings by Pacific

10 Conference rivals indicate that
clinching an NCAA bid by winning
the Pac-10 title or conference
tournament will not be easy.
That means it's more important
for Stanford to prove itself by win
ning tough non-conference con
tests, in case it is vying in March
for an NCAA at-large berth.
The Cardinal is 0-for-l in that
respect, as it lost at No. 20 In
diana last Sunday, 84-73 in the
second round of the Big Apple
National Invitutional Tournan
ment. Indiana was subsequently
pummeled by UNC Friday in the
NIT consolation game, 106-92.
Stanford has only one other
mt\jor intersectional game this
year after tonight, at No. 15
Florida Feb. 4. So if Stanford loses
to UNC tonight, it may look back
at the month of November as a
month of opportunities lost.
However, if Stanford pulls off
the upset, the Indiana game will
be as distant a memory as the
Heisman trophy hopes of Los An
geles quarterbacks.
There is hope. Forward/center
J.R. Reid is recovering from foot
surgery and won't play until 1989.
Finding UNC without Reid (18.0
points and 8.9 rebounds per game
last year) in the lineup is like
finding a final that's suddenly be
come open-book.
Admittedly, four-fifths of The
Sporting News' top-ranked front
line remains in Steve Bucknall,
Pete Chilcutt, Rick Fox and Scott


K»n Beer — Dally file
Senior center Eric Reveno will not have to contend with the likes
of Tarheel all-star J.R, Reid, who is out for the season with an
injury. Reveno himself is listed as doubtful for tonight's game in
Chapel Hill with streched ligments.
Williams.
Also, Jeff Lebo hit six of his
first seven 3-point attempts
against Indiana. Stanford has
been vulnerable to 3-point
shooters in the early going and
Lebo, if nothing else, will stretch
out Stanford's defense. Lebo also
passed for a UNC-record 17 as
sists Nov. 18.
So if Stanford wins, it would
definitely be showing the mettle
of an NCAA tournament team.
Card notes
No television station deigned to
cover tonight's game, but KZSU (90.1
FM) and KCBS (740 AM) will pick
up the action live at 4:30 p.m.
No word on any roster decisions in
the wake of Oliver Cunningham's
departure have been planned. Kenny
Ammann, a junior transfer from
Ranch Santiago College in Santa Ana,
is highly regarded but, as a shooting
guard, was being saved to replace
Todd Lichti after Lichti graduates.
The only other guard is 6-foot-4 fresh
man Peter Dukes.
Stanford's seven front-line players
(Howard Wright, Eric Reveno, liryan
McSweeney, Andrew Vlahov, Adam
Keefe, Deshon Wingate and Derek
Bruton) are shooting just 42.6 per

Todd Lichti after Lichti graduates.
The only other guard is 6-foot-4 fresh
man Peter Dukes.
Stanford's seven front-line players
(Howard Wright, Eric Reveno, liryan
McSweeney, Andrew Vlahov, Adam
Keefe, Deshon Wingate and Derek
Bruton) are shooting just 42.6 per
cent.
Before this season, tonight's
Stanford-North Carolina men's
basketball game would have been
one of those in which the Cardinal
would only have been wanting to
not be embarrassed, just so it
could file it under the "moral vic
tory" department.
Then all the preseason hype
came out, giving No. 24 Stanford
a lot more to shoot for in its 4:30
p.m. (PST) battle with the fifth
ranked Tar Heels (3-1) at Chapel
Hill, N.C. No longer would just a
moral victory would be satisfying.
But Stanford (1-1) may be back
to hoping it just holds its own
against UNC. Senior center Eric
Reveno (10.5 points, 6.5 rebounds
per game) stretched ligaments in
the top of his foot late in practice
Saturday. Reveno, who has been
on crutches since, is listed as
doubtful, and Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery plans to start
junior Derek Bruton in his place.
Before that, reserve guard
Oliver Cunningham, a defensive
specialist who had taken only one
snot this season, quit the team
for personal reasons and did not
make the trip.
So Stanford only has 10 healthy
bodies in one of its toughest, and
in a way most important, games
of the year.
Stanford (1-1) has been a pro
hibitive bet to qualify for the
NCAA tournament this year. But
strong early showings by Pacific

10 Conference rivals indicate that
clinching an NCAA bid by winning
the Pac-10 title or conference
tournament will not be easy.
That means it's more important
for Stanford to prove itself by win
ning tough non-conference con
tests, in case it is vying in March
for an NCAA at-large berth.
The Cardinal is 0-for-l in that
respect, as it lost at No. 20 In
diana last Sunday, 84-73 in the
second round of the Big Apple
National Invitutional Tournan
ment. Indiana was subsequently
pummeled by UNC Friday in the
NIT consolation game, 106-92.
Stanford has only one other
mt\jor intersectional game this
year after tonight, at No. 15
Florida Feb. 4. So if Stanford loses
to UNC tonight, it may look back
at the month of November as a
month of opportunities lost.
However, if Stanford pulls off
the upset, the Indiana game will
be as distant a memory as the
Heisman trophy hopes of Los An
geles quarterbacks.
There is hope. Forward/center
J.R. Reid is recovering from foot
surgery and won't play until 1989.
Finding UNC without Reid (18.0
points and 8.9 rebounds per game
last year) in the lineup is like
finding a final that's suddenly be
come open-book.
Admittedly, four-fifths of The
Sporting News' top-ranked front
line remains in Steve Bucknall,
Pete Chilcutt, Rick Fox and Scott


K»n Beer — Dally file
Senior center Eric Reveno will not have to contend with the likes
of Tarheel all-star J.R, Reid, who is out for the season with an
injury. Reveno himself is listed as doubtful for tonight's game in
Chapel Hill with streched ligments.
Williams.
Also, Jeff Lebo hit six of his
first seven 3-point attempts
against Indiana. Stanford has
been vulnerable to 3-point
shooters in the early going and
Lebo, if nothing else, will stretch
out Stanford's defense. Lebo also
passed for a UNC-record 17 as
sists Nov. 18.
So if Stanford wins, it would
definitely be showing the mettle
of an NCAA tournament team.
Card notes
No television station deigned to
cover tonight's game, but KZSU (90.1
FM) and KCBS (740 AM) will pick
up the action live at 4:30 p.m.
No word on any roster decisions in
the wake of Oliver Cunningham's
departure have been planned. Kenny
Ammann, a junior transfer from
Ranch Santiago College in Santa Ana,
is highly regarded but, as a shooting
guard, was being saved to replace
Todd Lichti after Lichti graduates.
The only other guard is 6-foot-4 fresh
man Peter Dukes.
Stanford's seven front-line players
(Howard Wright, Eric Reveno, liryan
