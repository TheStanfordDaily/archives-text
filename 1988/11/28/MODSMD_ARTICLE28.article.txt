While many were sharing
Thanksgiving dinner with
Grandma and basking in the
rain of the great Northwest,
Stanford's wrestling team was
devouring Western Oregon
State — almost saving enough
room for Oregon the following
day.

Indeed, Stanford stomped
Western Oregon State 43-3 Fri
day and lost a heartbreaker to
Oregon 20-19 Saturday, mov
ing the Cardinal record to 3-1-
0.
"We had some close matches
against Western Oregon State.
We just were in better shape.
Our conditioning has been bet
ter than anyone else we have
faced this year. We were also
a little more 'psyched' than
they were," commented Stan
ford Coach Chris Horpel.
Against Oregon, the meet
came down to the last match.

Before the heavyweight bout,
Stanford was leading 19-16 oft
the strength of wins by fresh
man Mark Forman (126 lbs.
weight class), sophomore
James Dinette (142 lbs.), junior
Steve Yarobrough (167 lbs.),
sophomore Steve Buddie (177
lbs.) and junior Ron Perry
(190 lbs.).
In the final duel, Junior
Trent Smith, who usually
wrestles at 177 lbs., was forced
to give almost 70 pounds to
Oregon's James Knott. "It was
like David versus Goliath," said
Horpel.
Knott ended up winning by
a mfyor decision in the waning
seconds, giving his team four
points and the narrow margin
of victory.
"Last year, we lost pretty
handily to Oregon 34-9. The
same basic teams were out
there this time. To have been
right in there at the end is a
positive sign showing the prog
ress we have made this year.
It always feels good to go even
with teams that give scholar
ships," Horpel expounded
Oregon finished second in
the Pac-10 last year and in the
top 20 nationally.
