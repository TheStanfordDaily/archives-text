# NC grade stands for Not Common
## Similar schools put F grades on transcripts 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
While the F grade has not been
recorded on Stanford student
transcripts since 1969, the loath
some letter is a mainstay at
similar universities, according to
campus newspapers surveyed.
The Faculty Senate reopened
the debate concerning reinstating
the F grade after a University
committee's survey showed over
250 faculty members favored its
return. The University Commit
tee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement conducted a survey
last spring and received 404 re
sponses from instructors in the
School of Humanities and
Sciences. Currently, if students fail
or do not receive credit for classes,
it does not appear on their tran
scripts.
Stanford's 1969 decision to not
record students' classroom fail
ures sets it apart from such
schools as University of Wisconsin
at Madison, Yale University, Har
vard University, Swarthmore Col
lege, Columbia University and
UC-Berkeley.
The Daily Californian univer
sity editor Irene Chang said stu
dents' transcripts show all classes
taken and the grades received.
Berkeley students can opt for
pass/no credit. However, they are
not encouraged to declare the pas
s/no credit option for any of the
six core classes required of ali un
dergraduates.
At Swarthmore, the F grade ap
pears on a student's transcript
and students can declare the pass/
fail option up to four times while
at the college, Swarthmore
Phoenix news editor Ben Rothfeld
said. However, its first-semester
freshmen take classes on a
credit/no credit basis only, he

added.
Columbia University students
are placed on "academic warning"
if they received too many Ds on
their transcript or if their GPA
dips below 2.0, said Robert Hardt,
an associate editor for the edito
rial page of the Daily Spectator.
UW-Madison records only seven
letter grades: A, AB, B, BC, C,
DF and F, according to Anthony
Shadid, campus editor of the Daily
Cardinal. Pluses and minuses are
not attached to letter grades, he
added.
Among the school's surveyed,
only Brown University and UC-
Santa Cruz do not report failing
grades. However, Brown and
Santa Cruz are known for their
less than traditional academic re
quirements.
The academically liberal Santa
Cruz goes one step further and
discourages the use of letter
grades on transcripts.
Santa Cruz's campus editor
Sarah Lavender said that profes
sors or teaching assistants write
narrative evaluations of a stu
dent's performance in class. The
written evaluation also tells
whether a student passed, failed
or did not complete the course
work.
Brown instructors grade from
A to C, but use a system that
does not allow prospective em
ployers or graduate schools to see
if a student gets a D or no credit.
This policy is similar to Stanford's
in that a failing grade does not
appear on the transcript.
According to Johnathan Levine,
managing editor at the Brown
Daily Herald, the university uses
an external and internal tran
script. The external transcript,
which is available to people out-
side of Brown, shows only what
the student passes, he said. The
internal transcript records every
grade in every class and is used
by university officials and by stu
dents.
The double transcript system
came about in 1969, the same
year as Stanford's policy, as a
result of the "reactionary 60's,"
Levine said.
Although grading policies are as
diverse as the universities them
selves, no student newspaper

editor interviewed said these pol
icies hindered academic freedom.
Chang echoed a general sentiment
when she said students are not
scared off from taking classes in
which they may not get a high
grade.
"One's educational experience
extends beyond a GPA" and so
"the general attitude at Berkeley
is that if you want to take it and
you are interested in it, you will
take it — whether it affects your
grades positively or negatively,"
she said.
Although senate members here
have just begun debating the
merits of the F grade, the issue

has already received regional and
national media attention. Bay
Area as well as national television
crews and newspapers have
carried the story in recent weeks.
In yesterday's Washington Post,
the debate was covered in a page
three story.
No date has been set for the
senate to vote on reinstating the
F grade, but most senate members
were against the idea of bringing
back the F. The University Com
mittee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement will continue their
study until the end of the aca
demic year. At that time it will
make its final recommendation to
the senate.

extends beyond a GPA" and so
"the general attitude at Berkeley
is that if you want to take it and
you are interested in it, you will
take it — whether it affects your
grades positively or negatively,"
she said.
Although senate members here
have just begun debating the
merits of the F grade, the issue

has already received regional and
national media attention. Bay
Area as well as national television
crews and newspapers have
carried the story in recent weeks.
In yesterday's Washington Post,
the debate was covered in a page
three story.
No date has been set for the
senate to vote on reinstating the
F grade, but most senate members
were against the idea of bringing
back the F. The University Com
mittee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement will continue their
study until the end of the aca
demic year. At that time it will
make its final recommendation to
the senate.
While the F grade has not been
recorded on Stanford student
transcripts since 1969, the loath
some letter is a mainstay at
similar universities, according to
campus newspapers surveyed.
The Faculty Senate reopened
the debate concerning reinstating
the F grade after a University
committee's survey showed over
250 faculty members favored its
return. The University Commit
tee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement conducted a survey
last spring and received 404 re
sponses from instructors in the
School of Humanities and
Sciences. Currently, if students fail
or do not receive credit for classes,
it does not appear on their tran
scripts.
Stanford's 1969 decision to not
record students' classroom fail
ures sets it apart from such
schools as University of Wisconsin
at Madison, Yale University, Har
vard University, Swarthmore Col
lege, Columbia University and
UC-Berkeley.
The Daily Californian univer
sity editor Irene Chang said stu
dents' transcripts show all classes
taken and the grades received.
Berkeley students can opt for
pass/no credit. However, they are
not encouraged to declare the pas
s/no credit option for any of the
six core classes required of ali un
dergraduates.
At Swarthmore, the F grade ap
pears on a student's transcript
and students can declare the pass/
fail option up to four times while
at the college, Swarthmore
Phoenix news editor Ben Rothfeld
said. However, its first-semester
freshmen take classes on a
credit/no credit basis only, he

added.
Columbia University students
are placed on "academic warning"
if they received too many Ds on
their transcript or if their GPA
dips below 2.0, said Robert Hardt,
an associate editor for the edito
rial page of the Daily Spectator.
UW-Madison records only seven
letter grades: A, AB, B, BC, C,
DF and F, according to Anthony
Shadid, campus editor of the Daily
Cardinal. Pluses and minuses are
not attached to letter grades, he
added.
Among the school's surveyed,
only Brown University and UC-
Santa Cruz do not report failing
grades. However, Brown and
Santa Cruz are known for their
less than traditional academic re
quirements.
The academically liberal Santa
Cruz goes one step further and
discourages the use of letter
grades on transcripts.
Santa Cruz's campus editor
Sarah Lavender said that profes
sors or teaching assistants write
narrative evaluations of a stu
dent's performance in class. The
written evaluation also tells
whether a student passed, failed
or did not complete the course
work.
Brown instructors grade from
A to C, but use a system that
does not allow prospective em
ployers or graduate schools to see
if a student gets a D or no credit.
This policy is similar to Stanford's
in that a failing grade does not
appear on the transcript.
According to Johnathan Levine,
managing editor at the Brown
Daily Herald, the university uses
an external and internal tran
script. The external transcript,
which is available to people out-
side of Brown, shows only what
the student passes, he said. The
internal transcript records every
grade in every class and is used
by university officials and by stu
dents.
The double transcript system
came about in 1969, the same
year as Stanford's policy, as a
result of the "reactionary 60's,"
Levine said.
Although grading policies are as
diverse as the universities them
selves, no student newspaper

editor interviewed said these pol
icies hindered academic freedom.
Chang echoed a general sentiment
when she said students are not
scared off from taking classes in
which they may not get a high
grade.
"One's educational experience
extends beyond a GPA" and so
"the general attitude at Berkeley
is that if you want to take it and
you are interested in it, you will
take it — whether it affects your
grades positively or negatively,"
she said.
