# S. African students share diverse experiences under apartheid
## 
### John Wagner Staff writer 
The panel discussion was an opportu
nity "to focus on the human face of apart
heid," said moderator Jonathan Jansen
last Tuesday night.
Five Stanford students who had grown
up in South Africa shared their personal
experiences of living under apartheid. Al
though the students had all grown up in
the same country, their ethnic back
grounds were diverse and their experi
ences directly reflected this diversity.
In addition to Jansen, who is a black
graduate student in the School of Edu
cation, two of the students are white,
while the other three are black.
The discussion, held in Ujamaa House
lounge, was sponsored by the Stanford
African Students Association.
According to Jansen, who spoke to an
audience of about 50, the South African
government classifies its citizens into four
categories: white, Indian, colored and
black. All oppressed groups, however,

"see themselves as one," and refer to
themselves as black, he said.
Duduzile Moerane, a black student on
the panel, explained that even more im
portant than the black vs. white distinc
tion, is a for the system vs. against the
system dilineation.
Moerane, a graduate student in the
School of Education, spoke about the in
tense fear she had felt as a black South
African teacher and mother. "Whether
asleep or awake," she said, apartheid was
a pervasive part of her life.
In contrast to Moerane, Hilary Sanger,
a white South African who is also a grad
uate student in the School of Education,
explained that despite having grown up
in a "multi-cultural" country, she was
never made aware of the harsh conditions
non-whites endure. "Those kind of expe
riences were never part of my immediate
consciousness," she said.
Moerane said that although black
teachers are often viewed "as very brave
people," she was always afraid because
of the presence of soldiers outside her

classroom. About 10 to 20 soldiers often
stand guard outside schools for black
children, according to Moerane.
The soldiers sometimes lure students
out of class because "they (the soldiers)
are in need of action," she said. Soldiers'
methods often include the use of dogs or
verbal attacks, Jansen explained.
Moerane spoke about a particular 11-
year-old girl in her class who was gunned
down by soldiers when a group of students
had been drawn out of the school after
being incited by the soldiers.
The girl "had to die like a dog because
nobody cares," Moerane said.
"As a teacher you get used to seeing
children you are fond of die," she added.
As a parent, Moerane said she lived in
fear for her own children's safety at
school. "You're never sure you'll be able
to see your child after school."
Sanger explained that, for the most
part, her childhood had been very shel
tered.
"The whole idea (of apartheid) is to

'... you get used to
seeing children you are
fond of die.'
— Duduzile Moerane

make non-awareness a way of life," she
said.
Sanger said that while "on holiday"
when she was 14 years-old, she met "a
completely gorgeous guy." She said she
remembers being confused when she was
told that she could not become involved
with him because he was black. If the
two of them were to have a relationship,
she was told, he could be arrested.
Sanger said that her first real contact
with black South Africans did not take
place until she attended Western Cape
University.
"I've learned much more about South
Africa having left it," Sanger said, who

currently lives in the United States.
The other white member of the panel,
Jan Van Egmond, a graduate student in
Chemical Engineering, also said he did
not become aware of the division between
blacks and whites in his country until
attending college.
Van Egmond said that throughout his
childhood, when he raised questions
about non-whites, his questions were not
answered. He said he was only told "black
people are black people and white people
are white people." Growing up, most of
his friends were "very apathetic" about
black-white relations, Van Egmond said.
Currently, apartheid is "destroying
South Africa," he said.
"I think a lot of white people want to
get rid of apartheid," Van Egmond said,
"but they don't know how. It's a monster
they created but they don't know how
to get rid of it."
According to Sanger, white South
Africans are reluctant to challenge a sys-
tem from which they benefit eco
nomically. "Life is very comfort
able (for white citizens)," she said.
"The immediacy of material goods
and good jobs can be very seduc
tive."
Some of the panelists, however,
were optimistic about the future
demise of apartheid.
According to panelist Ben
nedette September, despite 300
years of white oppression, "there
is hope for the future." September
is a black student who has been
classified as colored by the gov
"The young people are opting
for change," explained Sanjay
Raghu, a black member of the
panel whom the government has
classified as an Indian.
The Students for a Free South
Africa, a Stanford group, have
designated this week "South
Africa Awareness Week." The or
ganization will sponsor a series
of films and discussions through
out the week to raise awareness
about apartheid.

The Students for a Free South
Africa, a Stanford group, have
designated this week "South
Africa Awareness Week." The or
ganization will sponsor a series
of films and discussions through
out the week to raise awareness
about apartheid.
The panel discussion was an opportu
nity "to focus on the human face of apart
heid," said moderator Jonathan Jansen
last Tuesday night.
Five Stanford students who had grown
up in South Africa shared their personal
experiences of living under apartheid. Al
though the students had all grown up in
the same country, their ethnic back
grounds were diverse and their experi
ences directly reflected this diversity.
In addition to Jansen, who is a black
graduate student in the School of Edu
cation, two of the students are white,
while the other three are black.
The discussion, held in Ujamaa House
lounge, was sponsored by the Stanford
African Students Association.
According to Jansen, who spoke to an
audience of about 50, the South African
government classifies its citizens into four
categories: white, Indian, colored and
black. All oppressed groups, however,

"see themselves as one," and refer to
themselves as black, he said.
Duduzile Moerane, a black student on
the panel, explained that even more im
portant than the black vs. white distinc
tion, is a for the system vs. against the
system dilineation.
Moerane, a graduate student in the
School of Education, spoke about the in
tense fear she had felt as a black South
African teacher and mother. "Whether
asleep or awake," she said, apartheid was
a pervasive part of her life.
In contrast to Moerane, Hilary Sanger,
a white South African who is also a grad
uate student in the School of Education,
explained that despite having grown up
in a "multi-cultural" country, she was
never made aware of the harsh conditions
non-whites endure. "Those kind of expe
riences were never part of my immediate
consciousness," she said.
Moerane said that although black
teachers are often viewed "as very brave
people," she was always afraid because
of the presence of soldiers outside her

classroom. About 10 to 20 soldiers often
stand guard outside schools for black
children, according to Moerane.
The soldiers sometimes lure students
out of class because "they (the soldiers)
are in need of action," she said. Soldiers'
methods often include the use of dogs or
verbal attacks, Jansen explained.
Moerane spoke about a particular 11-
year-old girl in her class who was gunned
down by soldiers when a group of students
had been drawn out of the school after
being incited by the soldiers.
The girl "had to die like a dog because
nobody cares," Moerane said.
"As a teacher you get used to seeing
children you are fond of die," she added.
As a parent, Moerane said she lived in
fear for her own children's safety at
school. "You're never sure you'll be able
to see your child after school."
Sanger explained that, for the most
part, her childhood had been very shel
tered.
"The whole idea (of apartheid) is to

'... you get used to
seeing children you are
fond of die.'

make non-awareness a way of life," she
said.
Sanger said that while "on holiday"
when she was 14 years-old, she met "a
completely gorgeous guy." She said she
remembers being confused when she was
told that she could not become involved
with him because he was black. If the
two of them were to have a relationship,
she was told, he could be arrested.
Sanger said that her first real contact
with black South Africans did not take
place until she attended Western Cape
University.
"I've learned much more about South
Africa having left it," Sanger said, who

currently lives in the United States.
The other white member of the panel,
Jan Van Egmond, a graduate student in
Chemical Engineering, also said he did
not become aware of the division between
blacks and whites in his country until
attending college.
Van Egmond said that throughout his
childhood, when he raised questions
about non-whites, his questions were not
answered. He said he was only told "black
people are black people and white people
are white people." Growing up, most of
his friends were "very apathetic" about
black-white relations, Van Egmond said.
Currently, apartheid is "destroying
South Africa," he said.
"I think a lot of white people want to
get rid of apartheid," Van Egmond said,
"but they don't know how. It's a monster
they created but they don't know how
to get rid of it."
According to Sanger, white South
Africans are reluctant to challenge a sys-
tem from which they benefit eco
nomically. "Life is very comfort
able (for white citizens)," she said.
