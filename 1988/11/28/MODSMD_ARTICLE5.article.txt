Are you falling asleep in class?
Are you tired of teaching assis
tants who are unable to teach?
The ASSU Council of Presidents
hopes to do something about these
concerns.
In response to student com
plaints about the inadequacies of
the current advising system, the
COP plans to expand its Course
Consultants program.
During three days at the begin
ning of winter quarter, upper di
vision students sitting at tables
in White Plaza offer advice on
courses and professors in their
particular mcyor.
"Advising Associates only know
about the classes they took, and
advisors usually only know about
their own department," explained
COP member David Brown. The
ASSU program provides students
with academic advice on a wider
range of courses, he said.
Consultants will answer such
questions as which calculus pro
fessors and TA they liked, Brown
said. "I just thought I was stupid
until I got to a section I under
stood," he said.
In addition to providing Course
Guides and Time Schedules, the
course consultants will offer in

formation on educational rights
such as ethnic studies and TA
wages, Brown said.
Concern about the quality of
TA instruction has been an on
going issue. Because of budget
cuts, TAs may have to work fewer
hours to receive the same fixed
salary. In addition, the Faculty
Senate discussed ways of improv
ing TA training in its meeting
this month.
To combat these concerns about
the quality of TAs and other ad
vising needs, the COP initiated
the program over the summer
with help from the Undergradu
ate Advising Center.
UAC director Audrey Bernfield
said the center encourages stu
dents to "talk to as many people
as [theyl can." The ASSU is pro
viding a "wonderful service," she
added.
Last quarter the ASSU held
four days of course consulting in
White Plaza at noontime and
served over 100 students, accord
ing to Brown.
"We want to really expand upon
this program next quarter, and
allow the ASSU Course Guide and
our new Course Consultants pro
gram to develop alongside each
other," the COP said in their
State of the Association report.
