# For six, service is key to rewards
## Dean announces recipients of second annual service commendations 
### Laura Jacobson Senior staff writer 
Six students were called into
Dean Lyons' office two weeks ago.
"I wondered what I had done
wrong." junior Tina Mercer said.
Actually Mercer hadn't done
anything wrong at all. Instead,
Lyons informed Mercer and the
other five students they had won
the Dean's Award for Service.
Each quarter, a handful of stu
dents are chosen to receive the
dean's award for their "excep
tional contribution" to the com
munity.
"There's no money, no fame,
no fortune. Its intended to be a
very modest thank you," said
Lyons, the dean of student affairs.
The recipients of this quarter's
dean's award are Mercer, senior
Dinesh Vazirani, senior Russell
Korobkin, senior Jae Choi, law
student Shauna Jackson and
senior Lesley Jackson.
"I feel honored," Vazirani said,
expressing a sentiment shared by
several other award winners.
"You always appreciate the fact
that people appreciate what you
are doing."
Recently, Senators Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., and Barbara Mikulski, D-
Md., proposed extending that ap
preciation to include national
public service, during which stu
dents could earn financial aid

from the federal government if
they engage in public service.
"That s a good idea," Korobkin
said. "Some people want to do
public service work but can't af
ford to."
Lesley Jackson said the na
tional service idea "makes sense.
A lot of people would become more
involved."
It would be especially beneficial,
she added, because lower income
and minority students, who know
their own problems well, would
be able to suggest ways to help
their own situations. "Its a good
way to get to the root of the com
munity. "
Most of the recipients expressed
surprise that they were chosen out
of the countless number of stu
dents who contribute long hours
to public service. Almost all said
they felt many unrecognized stu
dents also deserved the award.
"There are so many people who
have done so much more than I
have," Choi said. "A lot of people
don't get recognized."
Choi, a human biology rmyor,
created a new Asian-American
sourcebook over the summer.
Given to incoming Asian Ameri
can students during Orientation,
the sourcebook presents a "slice
of life of the Asian American com
munity," Choi said.
Choi also helps run Stanford
Students on Class, Culture and

Race, a student group which
facilitates dorm discussions about
minority issues.
Vazirani, who is from Bombay,
India, spent much of his summer
developing an Orientation wel
come program for international
students. The activities he initi
ated included a retreat to Pajaro
Dunes in September for first-year
International students and a ban
quet for 800 held at the Bechtel
International Center.
Mtyoring in art design and in
dustrial engineering, Vazirani
said he intends to return to India
and work in a village for a year
after graduation.
Korobkin, an American Studies
was chosen for the award
partly because he proposed his
sophomore year to establish a
phone-a-thon that contacted all
2,500 high-school seniors accepted
to Stanford. In the ongoing pro
gram, students speak with pro
spective Stanford students to help
them "make an informed decision
about where to go to college,"
Korobkin said.
Lesley Jackson, who is from the
Crow Indian reservation in south
ern Montana, merited attention
not only as an outspoken leader
in the Native American commu
nity, but also for her decisive lead
ership and firm stand on issues
