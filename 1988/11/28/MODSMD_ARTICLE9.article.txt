Male homecoming queen
treated differently at Rice

Homecoming Queen-elect Mike
Grubbs will not represent Rice Univer
sity at the Cotton Bowl unless a female
representative selects him as her escort,
Assoc. Athletic Director Bobby May said.
"I don't think it would be very fair
of me to select her date. But it'd be
great ... if she wants him," May said.
These words appear to be the final
ones from the Athletic Department re

garding Grubbs's participation in Cot
ton Bowl activities for Rice.
A group of Baker College members
have circulated a petition demanding
Grubbs be sent to the Bowl.
Grubbs has not received the same
treatment that a female winner might
receive. The public address announcer
did not recognize Grubbs as homecom
ing queen at the homecoming football
game against Baylor.
"I was told the homecoming queen
gets a crown, some roses and a plaque,"
Grubbs said. "I haven't seen any of those

yet."
Grubbs said his parents, who came to
Houston for their 25th Rice reunion,
attended the game to see him honored.
"They were disappointed," he said.

UCLA opts not to read
most admissions essays

For those who sweated over their per
sonal statements on admissions applica
tions to the University of California,

Los Angeles, here's something to sink
your teeth into — they may not have
been read.
About 16,000 UCLA freshman appli
cants for fall quarter of this year were
rejected solely on their test scores, CPA's
and classes taken. And here's more food
for thought: Some of the most qualified
students are turning the tables and re
jecting UCLA.
Fifty-two students turned down
UCLA scholarships and opted for Stan
ford. Another 87 chose UC-Berkeley and
declined the UCLA scholarships. Har

vard University attracted 10 of these
scholars and Yale University attracted
nine.
According to the Adademic Senate's
Committee on Undergraduate Admis
sions and Relations with Schools, less
than 3 percent of the personal state
ments in students' applications were ac
tually read. The other 97 percent were
admitted or rejected based solely on test
scores, grades and the number of honors
or advanced placement classes taken.
