# Banks boost prime rate
## New level of 10.5 percent marks three-year high 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - Magor U.S.
banks boosted their prime lending
rate a half percentage point yes
terday to 10.5 percent, the
steepest level since mid-1985 and
the fourth rise this year.
The increase will mean a jump
in rates on a variety of consumer
loans pegged to the prime, includ
ing home-equity loans. It also will
raise borrowing costs for compan
ies that rely on banks for financ
ing.
Economists had been predicting
a prime rate increase because in
terest rates in the bond markets
rose recently due to inflation fears
and the dollar's weakness in
foreign exchange markets.
The financial markets had no
major reaction to the announce
ment. Stock and bond prices were
up modestly, while the dollar
steadied against other mtyor cur
rencies.
"It comes as no surprise. In
fact, they (banks) seem to have
held back longer than I expected,"

said Edward Yardeni, chief econ
omist for the investment firm
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
Federal Reserve Board Chair
man Alan Greenspan also has
warned of higher short-term rates
unless the government trims its
huge budget deficit, the source of
the dollar's woes.
"There's a building perception
in the marketplace that the Fed
is, in fact, tightening conditions
.. said William Sullivan, an
economist for the investment firm
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
Sullivan and other economists
predicted the Fed might soon
raise its discount rate, or the in
terest it charges on loans to mem
ber banks. If that happened, the
prime rate could be increased
again, they said.
"I'd look for something (from
the Fed) in the next two weeks,"
said Yardeni.
Chase Manhattan was the first
institution to increase its prime
rate yesterday, and other major

banks quickly joined the move.
The prime stood at 8.5 percent
at the start of the year and has
been raised four times since. Yes
terday's increase put the key lend
ing rate at its highest level since
May 20, 1985, when it was
lowered a half percentage point to
10 percent.
The prime rate reflects a bank's
costs of borrowing money, includ
ing interest it pays on savings ac
counts and certificates of deposit,
and trails subtler increases in
other interest rates.
But the rate is watched closely
because bankers use it as a basis
for calculating loans to businesses
and for determining many types
of fixed and adjustable-rate con
sumer loans. Mortgage rates are
not included in that category.
Economists were uncertain
what effect the latest increase
would have on the economy, and
more specifically on consumers'
spending during the holiday
season.
