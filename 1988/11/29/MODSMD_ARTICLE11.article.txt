# U.N. session may move to Geneva
## State Dept. calls decision to deny Arafat's visa 'firm and final' 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Arab na
tions said yesterday the General Assem
bly session will move to Geneva so PLO
chief Yasser Arafat can address it, un
less the United States reverses itself
within 48 hours and grants him a visa.
In Washington, the State Department
said the U.S. decision to deny the visa
was "firm and final." It gave reluctant
consent to moving the debate on Pales
tinian issues, scheduled to begin Thurs
day.
U.N. legal counsel Carl-August
Fleischhauer told a U.N. committee the
United States was violating the 1947
U.S.-U.N. Headquarters Agreement,

which requires the host country to grant
visas to people invited by the United
Nations.
"I am of the opinion that the host
country was and is under an obligation
to grant the visa request of the chairman
of the executive committee of the Pales
tine Liberation Organization, an organ
ization which has been granted observer
status by the General Assembly,"
Fleischhauer said.
"The agreement does not contain a
reservation of the right to bar the entry
of those who represent, in the view of
the host country, a threat to its
sovereignty and security," the lawyer

added.
Patricia Byrne, alternate U.S. repre
sentative, said the U.S. government dis
agreed with Fleischhauer's interpreta
tion. She did not elaborate.
Arab diplomats called the U.S. visa
denial a "slap in the face" and a violation
of the agreement.
The PLO's U.N. observer, Zuhdi
Labib Terzi, complained, "We have a
message of peace that we want to bring
to the General Assembly through Chair
man Arafat. The United States is im
posing some obstacles that would im
pede easy access, so we have to do it
somewhere else."
