LONDON (AP) â€” Pablo Picasso's
"Acrobat and Young Harlequin" brought
$38.46 million last night at Christie's,
the highest price ever paid at auction
for a 20th century work of art.
Spokesmen for the auction house said
the buyer was Japanese and attended
the sale, but chose to remain anony
mous. The seller was identified only as
a private owner.
The 1905 work from the artist's Rose
Period was sold in three minutes. Bid
ding opened at 5 million pounds ($9.2
million) and ended at 20.9 million
pounds ($38.46 million). The price
topped the previous record for a 20th

century painting, $24.75 million paid for
Picasso's "Maternity" Nov. 14 in New
York.
Yesterday's auction of 60 works by
40 artists brought 55.44 million pounds
($102.01 million), a record for an Im
pressionist and modern art sale in Lon
don. Individual records were set for
works by Picasso, Paul Gauguin, Alberto
Giacometti, Paul Klee and Paul Signac.
The Japanese buyer pushed through
the crowd, escorted by a security guard,
after buying the painting. He would not
answer questions and was taken into a
private room by Christie's directors
while the sale continued.
