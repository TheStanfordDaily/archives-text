Sandinistas may end cease-fire
MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) — The
Nicaraguan rebel-commander yesterday said the
Sandinista government has ended an eight-month
cease-fire by staging offensive military operations
in eastern and northern Nicaragua.
"We have alerted our combatants that the San
dinistas are declaring war," said Enrique Ber
mudez in a broadcast over the rebels' clandestine
Radio Liberacion.
The director of the rebels' Nicaraguan Resis
tance umbrella organization also said the Sandi
nistas received new shipments of Soviet military
aid since August. These included large numbers
of ground-based AC-2 and AC-3 missiles and Mi
-17 helicopters, he said.
Party ready for Supreme Soviet
MOSCOW (AP) — The Communist Party Cen
tral Committee yesterday endorsed constitutional
changes that critics say give the Kremlin too
much power, setting the stage for approval over
the objection of several restive republics.
Officials in Estonia, the tiny Baltic republic

that led the challenge to Kremlin authority by
declaring its sovereignty in internal policy and
its right to review all new Soviet legislation, said
they would stand firm despite a ruling the move
was unconstitutional.
The more than 300 members of the party's
policy-making body, meeting on the eve of an
extraordinary meeting of the Supreme Soviet, or
national parliament, declared the amendments
"will mean a major step along the road of de
mocratization of Soviet society," the official Tass
news agency said.
OPEC approves new output level
VIENNA, Austria (AP) — OPEC oil ministers
ended nearly two weeks of tense discussions yes
terday with a formal agreement to limit produc
tion and pump prices back toward the cartel's
benchmark of $18 per barrel.
The accord, which ended the winter meeting
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, set an output ceiling of 18.5 million
barrels a day for the 13 OPEC members, well
under the 22.5 million that analysts estimate the
cartel is currently pumping.
