# Tornadoes skip across Carolinas

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - Tor
nadoes skipped without warning
like a "big bouncing ball" across
North Carolina's capital city early
yesterday, smashing homes and
churches before heading into rural
areas. Four people were killed and
at least 151 injured.
"I can remember hearing a big
gust of wind like a hurricane and
then I could hear the wood tearing
and I thought 'Oh God, this is it,
I'm gone.' I just buried myself
under the bed," said Betty Bell
of Raleigh.
The storms brought reminders
of the 24 twisters that ripped a
250-mile path through the state
in 1984, killing 44 people, injuring
more than 800 and leaving 2,300
homeless.
Yesterday's twisters destroyed

mobile homes, damaged churches,
toppled several houses onto their
sides and threw power lines onto
houses and streets, leaving more
than 6,500 homes without elec-
tricity for several hours. Trees

snapped several feet from the
ground along the storm's path,
About 500 people were left
homeless in Raleigh, where the
storms struck without any ad
vance notice.
