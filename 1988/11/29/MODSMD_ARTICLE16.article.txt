## South Africa Week 
### 
Programming began Sunday
night with the screening of "Cry
Freedom" at the ASSU Sunday
Flicks and will continue every
night through Friday.
"Cry Freedom" chronicles the
experiences of South African free
dom fighter Steven Biko. Biko, and
others like him, died in a South
African prison. The government re
ported the cause of his death as a
"hunger strike."
Similar deaths went unex
plained, while others received ab
surd classifications like "slipped in
shower," and "fell down stairs."
Tonight, another film about Biko
will be shown, "Biko: Breaking the
Silence," in the Madera House
lounge.
Another film, "South Africa: A
Profile," is also scheduled for
tonight and will introduce a back
ground of the black South African
condition.
For example, black South
Africans cannot own land in 87
percent of South Africa, designated
"white only areas."
While there are just 4.5 million
white citizens and 25 million black
citizens in South Africa, the white
population controls the govern
ment and wealth of the country.
Black South Africans have no
effective political freedom and no
freedom of movement.
The injustice and inhumanity of
the apartheid regime is new to no
one. But knowledge of what goes
on in South Africa must stay at
the forefront of our consciousness.
Stay aware.

Programs this week
aim to teach students
more about apartheid

ON MARCH 21, 1960, 69
peaceful black demonstra
tors were killed when South
African police opened fire on a
demonstration in Sharpeville,
South Africa. To anti-apartheid ac
tivists, this tragic incident is
known as the Sharpeville mas
sacre.
More than 100 black student
protestors were slaughtered and
1,000 others injured on June 16,
1976, when South African anti
terrorist police and army reinforce
ments began shooting at 10,000
peaceful demonstrators in the
South African township of Soweto.
To anti-apartheid activists, it's
known as the Soweto massacre.
Related demonstrations through
the month of August brought the
death toll to 234.
Through this week's South
Africa Awareness Week program
ming, Students for a Free South
Africa will be sponsoring speakers,
films and discussions in an effort
to further inform Stanford stu
dents about the oppression of black
South Africans.
Other sponsors include the
ASSU, Student Organization Serv
ices, the Black Community Service
Center, the International Relations
Program, Afro-American Studies
and the Linguistics Department.
