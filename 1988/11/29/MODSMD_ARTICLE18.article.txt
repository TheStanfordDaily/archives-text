## Service is the answer

"When the Athenians finally wanted not
to give to society, but for society to give
to them, when the freedom they wished
for most was freedom from responsibility,
then Athens ceased to be free."
— Edward Gibbon
WITH THE UNVEILING of the
Citizen Corps proposal by the
Democratic Leadership Council,
the concept of national service has once
again been legitimized. Although the
DLC's proposal may be too grandiose for
many to accept, it has at least made
other national service bills appear modest
in contrast. Of these bills, the Higher
Education Volunteer Amendments pro
posal and the American Conservation
Corps Act both deserve to be made into
law.
The former bill, proposed by Sen. Dale
Bumpers, D-Ariz., and Rep. Gerry
Sikorski, D-Minn., targets college gradu
ates by aiming to ease the burden of
paying back student loans. The first part
of the bill directs the Department of Ed
ucation to more fully publicize an already
existing program (the Higher Education
Act of 1965) in which college graduates
may defer loan payments for up to three
years if they work for low-paying, non
profit organizations.
The second, and more interesting, part
of the bill would supplement the current
program by partially forgiving repayment
of student loans in exchange for service.
Fifteen percent of the loans would be
canceled for the first and second year of
service in charitable and community serv
ice organizations; 20 percent for the third
and fourth year.

With nearly 40 percent of Stanford
graduating seniors indicating that debts
from student loans impacted their career
choice, the Bumpers-Sikorski bill could
not have come sooner.
Targeting a lesser privileged group of
people, the American Conservation Corps
Act seeks to empower disadvantaged
youngsters aged 16 to 25 by encouraging
them to volunteer for up to two years of
environmental work on federal, state and
private lands. Proposed by Rep. Morris
Udall, D-Utah, and Sen. Daniel
Moynihan, D-N.Y., this bill earmarks $75
million in federal funds, supplemented
by state-matching funds.
These two modest bills — Bumpers-
Sikorski and Udall-Moynihan — seek to
address perhaps the two fundamental
problems, and challenges, facing our gen
eration — the decreasing concern for
altruism and the growing lack of social
conscience.
A look at 20 years of surveys conducted
by UCLA and the American Council On
Education shows "a steady increase in
student concern with being affluent and
a decrease of altruism and social con
cern." A look at the last 8 years reflects
a nation with its social conscience on
hold. Howard Beach, the environment,
Ivan Boesky, Iran-Contra, cases in point.
It is not surprising, then, that during
those eight years the Reagan Adminis
tration has cut funding to a number of
service-type employment packages and
shelved any adequate version of an ethics
bill. In 1984, Congress passed the Amer
ican Conservation Corps bill — Reagan
vetoed it. Just recently, Congress passed
a strong ethics bill — Reagan pocket

vetoed it.
Critics who approve of shelving na
tional service proposals often argue that
national service is equivalent to national
"servitude." Purely from a rational stand
point, those critics must be either self
interested, confused, blind or all three.
With the poor getting poorer and the
rich getting richer; with the rising influ
ence of crime, crack, Crips and Bloods;
with the swelling ranks of homeless
people in our cities; with the decreasing
enrollment of college students from low
income and minority families, with no
high school located in East Palo Alto, any
person willing to open their eyes will
realize that tne underclass is already in
servitude, that life, liberty and the pJui
suit of happiness are rights reserved for
the few, the privileged, the rich.
If we want the American dream open
to everyone, not just the rich or sly; if
we want a "kindler, gentler nation," not
just hollow rhetoric; if we want a truly
free nation, not just an enslaved under
class, then we must win the moral equiv
alent of war, we must implement national
service.

them to volunteer for up to two years of
environmental work on federal, state and
private lands. Proposed by Rep. Morris
Udall, D-Utah, and Sen. Daniel
Moynihan, D-N.Y., this bill earmarks $75
million in federal funds, supplemented
by state-matching funds.
These two modest bills — Bumpers-
Sikorski and Udall-Moynihan — seek to
address perhaps the two fundamental
problems, and challenges, facing our gen
eration — the decreasing concern for
altruism and the growing lack of social
conscience.
A look at 20 years of surveys conducted
by UCLA and the American Council On
Education shows "a steady increase in
student concern with being affluent and
a decrease of altruism and social con
cern." A look at the last 8 years reflects
a nation with its social conscience on
hold. Howard Beach, the environment,
Ivan Boesky, Iran-Contra, cases in point.
It is not surprising, then, that during
those eight years the Reagan Adminis
tration has cut funding to a number of
service-type employment packages and
shelved any adequate version of an ethics
bill. In 1984, Congress passed the Amer
ican Conservation Corps bill — Reagan
vetoed it. Just recently, Congress passed
a strong ethics bill — Reagan pocket

vetoed it.
Critics who approve of shelving na
tional service proposals often argue that
national service is equivalent to national
"servitude." Purely from a rational stand
point, those critics must be either self
interested, confused, blind or all three.
With the poor getting poorer and the
rich getting richer; with the rising influ
ence of crime, crack, Crips and Bloods;
with the swelling ranks of homeless
people in our cities; with the decreasing
enrollment of college students from low
income and minority families, with no
high school located in East Palo Alto, any
person willing to open their eyes will
realize that tne underclass is already in
servitude, that life, liberty and the pJui
suit of happiness are rights reserved for
the few, the privileged, the rich.
If we want the American dream open
to everyone, not just the rich or sly; if
we want a "kindler, gentler nation," not
just hollow rhetoric; if we want a truly
free nation, not just an enslaved under
class, then we must win the moral equiv
alent of war, we must implement national
service.
