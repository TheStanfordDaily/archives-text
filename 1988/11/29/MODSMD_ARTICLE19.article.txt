## Free South Africa Fund allows people to take a stand 
### 
AS FACULTY, staff, alumni and
friends of Stanford, we are
strong supporters of her educa
tional mission. It is important to us
that Stanford has one of the largest
endowments of any university in the
world, ensuring that today's excellence
will last well into the future.
Unfortunately, we easily forget that
a portion of that endowment (about 10
percent) is invested in over 80 compan
ies with subsidiaries in South Africa.
These companies pay taxes to the
South African government, obey apart
heid laws and provide the technical
expertise, foreign exchange and interna
tional respectability that the South
African government needs to stay in
power.
The vast majority of black South
African leaders call for us to take any
measures, symbolic or otherwise, that
will help to remove these external
props from the apartheid system.
The Free South Africa Fund at
Stanford is one way to help. Incor-

porated in May 1987, the fund offers
us an opportunity to support black
South Africans' efforts to free them
selves, while helping Stanford.
Contributions to the fund are held in
escrow for the University, in companies
and banks which do not have invest
ments in South Africa. Contributions
plus earnings will be given to the
University as soon as the University
itself divests from all South Africa
related stock, or mtyority rule is
achieved in South Africa.
If, by May 1997, neither has oc
curred, then the fund will dissolve and
its proceeds will be spent on the educa
tion of black South Africans, at Stan
ford and elsewhere.
Contributions to the fund may also
be designated for current activities
educating the Stanford community
about apartheid and how we can help
those working towards democracy in
South Africa.
The Free South Africa Fund exists
because the University's current invest-

ment policy, in our judgment, is inade
quate. Since 1977 the University has
judged companies on a case-by-case
basis, with seven cases of divestment to
date.
This policy is weak because it funda
mentally misstates the problem: it is
the laws of South Africa, not the
management of individual companies,
which cause harm. To think that our
companies can do good despite these
laws is wishful thinking.
We feel that an alternative invest
ment policy is needed, and are writing
now to request your support for the
new Free South Africa Fund. We are
asking those who can to contribute to
the fund, to inform local alumni
groups about the fund and to commu
nicate with the University administra
tion directly about the importance of
this issue.
Donations are tax-deductible, and
may be mailed to Free South Africa
Fund, PO Box 8625, Stanford CA
94309. Please specify how much, if any,

of your gift may be used for publicity,
and whether the fund may use your
name as an endorser of its goals. The
fund also welcomes inquiries about the
issue, at the same address. This issue
concerns all of us, and demands our
attention.
