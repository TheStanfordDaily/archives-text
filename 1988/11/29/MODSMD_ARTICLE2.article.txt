# Drell resigns arms control center job
## Dispute over appointments prompts move 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
Arms control expert and
Physics Prof. Sidney Drell has
resigned as co-director of the
Stanford Center for International
Security and Arms Control, effec
tive Aug. 31, because of his two
year struggle with the University
to maintain continuity and excel
lence at the center.
Drell's resignation was made
public yesterday after he sent a
letter to the members of the cen
ter last week, which stated his
reasons for leaving.
Drell told The Daily that Uni
versity rules have "stymied" his
attempts to gain professorships
for several research and science
fellows at the center. Fellows cur
rently serve for two to three year
periods, but Drell said he believes
more permanent posts are war
ranted to maintain the center's
work.
Those associated with the center
said Drell's departure, along with
the probable exodus of some of
his colleagues, will cause a setback
at the center, which specializes in
arms control research and train
ing scholars in the field.
Political Science Prof. Coit
Blacker, a senior research associ
ate at the center, left Stanford for
a tenured position at UCLA at
the end of spring quarter.
Drell will maintain his posts as
physics professor and as deputy
director of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center. He said he will
continue work in arms control
through his contacts in govern
ment. Political Science Prof. John
Lewis, the center's co-director,
will become director.

Though some of Drell's un
tenured colleagues at the center
have received offers of professor
ships at other universities, he said
he has no intention of leaving
Stanford.
Drell's associates generally

showed much
concern for the
future of center
without Drell as
the head.
According to
David Bernstein,
assistant to the
co-directors at
the center, Drell's
departure will

have a "very serious, enormous
impact" on the center, especially
on the center's scientific achieve
ments, "but it will continue."
University President Donald
Kennedy said Drell's resignation
will be a great loss to the center
and Drell's complaints will be con
sidered.
"Sid's decision saddens me, for
he has long been one of the most
creative and influential voices for
policy studies," said Kennedy.
"His evident disappointment
with the administration's re
sponse to his request points up a
difficult problem for us, and the
provost and I will continue to
wrestle with it in consultation
with the faculty," Kennedy added.
The issue which prompted
Drell's resignation concerns Uni
versity policy on the appointment
of tenured faculty. Drell wants
some of his untenured colleagues,
who stay at the center only briefly,
to receive professorships to
preserve the continuity and main
