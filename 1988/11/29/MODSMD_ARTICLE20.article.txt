# Arafat should be allowed to speak at United Nations
## 
### 
Since last December we have read
daily reports of Israeli soldiers break
ing the bones of Palestinians, shooting
children, blowing up homes, torturing
prisoners and bombing Lebanese vil
lages.
Nearly 400 Palestinians have been
shot, beaten or gassed to death. Three
were burned alive. The U.S. State De
partment has been silent about this
brutality yet now claims that the Pal
estinians' chief, Yasser Arafat, has no
right to speak before the United Na

tions in New York because he supports
terrorism.
No one will be fooled by this trans
parent excuse from an administration
that has dealt willingly with the
Khomeni regime and with South
Africa's white racists.
The decision had nothing to do with
principle. It was a deliberate rebuff to
the Palestine National Council, which
has offered to accept Israel's right to
exist within secure borders in exchange
for an independent Palestinian state.
The State Department's action dam
pens any hope for negotiations to end
the conflict. It will increase the despair
of Palestinians and Israelis who favor
peaceful co-existence as equals, and
give encouragement to hard-liners on
both sides.

At the same time, the U.S. refusal
to let the Palestinians' case be pre
sented at the United Nations shows
utter disregard for the right of Ameri
cans to hear both sides of the issue.
Secretary of State George Shultz will
no doubt be honored as an elder
statesman when he returns to his en
dowed chair at Stanford next year, but
with this latest action he has struck a
devastating blow to peace.
