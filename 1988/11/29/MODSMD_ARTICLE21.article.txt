This letter is openly addressed to
Stanford faculty, staff and students
who use bikes on campus urging you

to, think before you park!
The entrances to many buildings on
campus (especially Green Library) are
often choked with bikes parked ran
domly around them.
Not only is this a hazard in case of
emergencies, but it makes passage ex
tremely difficult for the handicapped,
particularly the blind.
So when you park your bike, please
consider not only your own conven
ience, but someone else's also. Use the
designated areas, or park far enough
away from an entrance ramp or
walkway that your bike poses no ob
stacle to the handicapped. Thanks!
