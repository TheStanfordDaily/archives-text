## Life after law school: Making firm decisions with prudence 
### Steve Miller 
Graduation from Stanford Law School
is not a ticket to easy street. Instead, it
leaves students at a crossroads of career
paths, weighing the different costs and
means of arriving at various destinations.
Often the choice is between work in public
or private law.
According to statistics compiled by the
Stanford Office of Law Career Services,
an overwhelming number of Stanford
Law School graduates enter immediately
into large private law firms, while a small
minority chooses to pursue public service
duties.
From the class of 1988, 63 percent
accepted offers from private law firms in
cities such as Los Angeles, New York and
San Francisco; 23 percent worked in jud
icial clerkships; and 3 percent entered
into non-law, public interest, government
or post-graduate legal study.
Even more law students will enter into
large firms after their short-term judicial
clerkships. "(Clerkships) are a great thing
to do for a year if you need a little time
[to decide]," says Dan Pretel, a third-year

student.
Part of the attraction of private-sector
law is its appeasement of institutionalized
pressures facing law school graduates.
Young lawyers flock to the more lucrative
offers and more aggressive recruiting of
private firms â€” often to pay off debts
incurred by exorbitant tuition bills. The
ticket to Stanford Law School this year
costs $13,180.
Therefore, greed is not the chief mo
tivation behind graduates' choice of high
salaried posts in private practice. Stu
dents face harsh monetary reality imme
diately upon graduation. "Many students
come out of law school thousands of dol
lars in debt," says Laurie Albright, di
rector of Law Career Services.
Thus, the significant disparity between
the wages of private and public law plays
an influential role in post-law school
plans. Private firms offered 1987 Stan
ford Law School graduates yearly salaries
of up to $70,000 while those in public
law averaged close to $25,000.
In addition, private firms frequently
offer more flexibility as well as more
money. "If you get a job in the private

sector, you know that you can move into
just about anything else," says Mary
Dent, president of the Student Law As
sociation.
To others, private law firm work is
simply more appealing than positions in
public service. Michael Grooen, a second
year law student, describes most private
sector responsibilities as "uniquely com
plex and satisfying."
"If you're going to be working 80 hours

a week, you want to work on something
that captivates you," adds Grooen.
The swank, aesthetic atmosphere of
many large firms also entices many a
potential employee. Appearing attractive
and professional is imperative to impress
clients and potential employees, Grooen
points out.
Despite the material comforts of these
firms, the long hours and a pressure
packed, competitive atmosphere may con
vince law students to consider public law.
Public sector law tends to keep its
devotees, as job satisfaction causes a
notably low turnover rate, points out
third-year student Cathy Ruckelshaus.
"It really is .. . satisfying work," agrees
Pretel.
Also public work often provides the
opportunity to develop a deep knowledge
about a certain area of law and directly
influence litigation in that field.
Agencies and groups with opportunities
for public law, however, do not court law
students the way private firms do. To
the contrary, the low turnover and tough
competition make public service positions
virtually unobtainable.

"Not only do the jobs not pay, but you
can't get them," says Pretel.
In addition to the glut of public sector
employment, limited exposure to the op
portunities creates more obstacles. "Most
of the public law agencies don't have the
money to come here to recruit," says
Dean of Stanford Law School Paul Brest.
The impetus is on the student to go
and seek these public service positions.
Often daunted by the effort and uncertain
results of the public law track, students
meanwhile are tempted with the abun
dance and easy access of beckoning op
portunities in private law.
Should a student beat the odds and
secure fall interviews in the public sector,
he or she would not be informed of the
job offer until the spring. Most private
law firms will notify prospective employ
ees several weeks after the interview.
Additionally, large law firms often fly
recruits to their headquarters in order
to convince law students to work for
them.
