# Tiny little phrases and admittedly sincere praises
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
Dear Bug,
When I got my acceptance letter,
I thought that Dean Jean's little
phrase of congratulations was
something personal and unique.
I thought it was a nice gesture.
Actually, I thought she was hin
ting that I was the cream of the
crop out of my class.
1 was wrong. How many current
Stanford students would be
Weenies right now if not for those
mass-produced words of encour
agement. Can Dean Jean be held
liable for deceptive advertising
practices?
— Dean Rusk
Your original rush of self
importance is understandable.
Also, the Bug can see why you'd
feel a little cheated when you
found out that your high school's
chief loser not only also got in,
but also got a personal note.

I was greatly disappointed when
I found out others had received
a special mention. The particular
note on my letter of acceptance,
"You were this year's most qual
ified applicant," led me to believe
Stanford was especially anxious
to have me join the Class of '89.
But despite this sort of shady
practice, Stanford students should
have reason to believe Dean Fet
ter is an astute and worthy di
rector of admissions. She was
smart enough to accept you, right?
How many other admissions offi
cers were that smart? Probably
few.
The Bug did give Dean Fetter
a call, and she very willingly dis
cussed her notes of congratula
tions. "It really is meant; it's a
heartfelt personal touch," she
said. "It isn't meant to be a gim
mick."
Fetter said writing the short
postscript is something she does
to evidence not only that she has

Eight bravos, seven
greats, six supers, six
terrifies, four good
jobs, three great jobs,
two good works and
one wonderful.

considered the applicant closely
and seriously, but that she cares,
as she thinks the student will find
Stanford cares, about him as an
individual (if it's a him/her
nobody seems to care).
Fetter has seven or eight con
gratulatory words, and which one
she chooses to write on any one
letter depends on "how the spirit
moves (her)." She adds a couple
new words once in a while and
tries to use words which are
roughly equivalent in degree of
kudos.

Students often do think they're
part of a special group at first.
This, according to Fetter, may
have a dual effect. At first, she
said students probably think Stan
ford is particularly friendly and
conscientious. However, the dis
covery that everyone else has re
ceived similar attention may have
some negative impact.
"It's the ultimate catch-22, but
1 hope people take it with the
spirit with which it's intended,"
she said, adding that any student
commentary about this or any
other facet of the admissions proc
ess is always very welcome.
Of the 50 students asked, 13
did not remember what Dean Fet
ter had written on their letters of
acceptance. The breakdown of
those words or phrases that were
recalled goes like this: eight
bravos, seven greats, six supers,
six terrifies, four good jobs, three
great jobs, two good works and
one wonderful.

A football player and perhaps
now ex-friend said his note read,
"Congratulations, big guy, you're
dumb but large."
Inside sources so anonymous
that they don't even exist told the
Bug that, amazingly enough, Fet
ter also goes to the trouble of
writing personal notes on letters
denying admission.
Her most commonly-used
denial phrases last year were,
"You never had a chance," "Not
likely," and "Have you tried Vo-
Tech?" This upcoming April she
plans to use these gems: "You
wasted my valuable time," "You
wasted valuable paper," "You've
lived a valueless life," and "Be all
that you can be; I think you'll
make a fine soldier."
As for "deceptive advertising
practices," the Bug's legal counsel
said that if you are deceived by
an advertisement, that's just
tough luck. That is, it's your prob
lem if you watch a Reeboks com

mercial and then rush to buy a
pair because U. want so desper
ately to 8.U., just like everyone
else.
Until next week, the Bug has
spoken.

Your original rush of self
importance is understandable.
Also, the Bug can see why you'd
feel a little cheated when you
found out that your high school's
chief loser not only also got in,
but also got a personal note.

I was greatly disappointed when
I found out others had received
a special mention. The particular
note on my letter of acceptance,
"You were this year's most qual
ified applicant," led me to believe
Stanford was especially anxious
to have me join the Class of '89.
But despite this sort of shady
practice, Stanford students should
have reason to believe Dean Fet
ter is an astute and worthy di
rector of admissions. She was
smart enough to accept you, right?
How many other admissions offi
cers were that smart? Probably
few.
The Bug did give Dean Fetter
a call, and she very willingly dis
cussed her notes of congratula
tions. "It really is meant; it's a
heartfelt personal touch," she
said. "It isn't meant to be a gim
mick."
Fetter said writing the short
postscript is something she does
to evidence not only that she has

Eight bravos, seven
greats, six supers, six
terrifies, four good
jobs, three great jobs,
two good works and
one wonderful.

considered the applicant closely
and seriously, but that she cares,
as she thinks the student will find
Stanford cares, about him as an
individual (if it's a him/her
nobody seems to care).
Fetter has seven or eight con
gratulatory words, and which one
she chooses to write on any one
letter depends on "how the spirit
moves (her)." She adds a couple
new words once in a while and
tries to use words which are
roughly equivalent in degree of
kudos.

Students often do think they're
part of a special group at first.
This, according to Fetter, may
have a dual effect. At first, she
said students probably think Stan
ford is particularly friendly and
conscientious. However, the dis
covery that everyone else has re
ceived similar attention may have
some negative impact.
"It's the ultimate catch-22, but
1 hope people take it with the
spirit with which it's intended,"
she said, adding that any student
commentary about this or any
other facet of the admissions proc
ess is always very welcome.
Of the 50 students asked, 13
did not remember what Dean Fet
ter had written on their letters of
acceptance. The breakdown of
those words or phrases that were
recalled goes like this: eight
bravos, seven greats, six supers,
six terrifies, four good jobs, three
great jobs, two good works and
one wonderful.

A football player and perhaps
now ex-friend said his note read,
"Congratulations, big guy, you're
dumb but large."
Inside sources so anonymous
that they don't even exist told the
Bug that, amazingly enough, Fet
ter also goes to the trouble of
writing personal notes on letters
denying admission.
Her most commonly-used
denial phrases last year were,
"You never had a chance," "Not
likely," and "Have you tried Vo-
Tech?" This upcoming April she
plans to use these gems: "You
wasted my valuable time," "You
wasted valuable paper," "You've
lived a valueless life," and "Be all
that you can be; I think you'll
make a fine soldier."
As for "deceptive advertising
practices," the Bug's legal counsel
said that if you are deceived by
an advertisement, that's just
tough luck. That is, it's your prob
lem if you watch a Reeboks com

mercial and then rush to buy a
pair because U. want so desper
ately to 8.U., just like everyone
else.
Until next week, the Bug has
spoken.
