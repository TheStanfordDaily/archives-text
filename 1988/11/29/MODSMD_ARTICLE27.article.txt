CHAPEL HILL, N.C. - For
almost 25 minutes, the Stanford
men's basketball team was pulling
off its latest upset of the century.
But No. 10 North Carolina
struck back with a 13-2 run in
the second half and cruised there
after to an 87-76 victory over the
Cardinal before 17,878 at the
Dean Smith Center, named after
UNC's coach.

Men's Basketball.
Tar Heels 87, Cardinal 76

"This is the most consistent
we've played all year," Smith said.
"Stanford's an excellent team
with five seniors coming back. I
think we did a good defensive job
on (Todd) Lichti. We tried not to
make any changes for him; in
stead we just tried to pressure
every shot that he took."
Lichti scored 10 points in each
half to lead the Cardinal, but was
plagued by foul trouble. He
missed more than five minutes of
the second half after he was called
for his fourth foul with 10:38 to
go before finally fouling out with
less than a munute left.
"Of course I would have liked
to have been in," Lichti said, "but
the fouls shouldn't have affected
my play. ... It's tough going in
there with four fouls, but what

are you going to do?"
Fouls weren't Stanford's only
handicap. The Cardinal (1-2) was
playing without starting center
Eric Reveno, who is sidelined with
a sprained foot, and reserve guard
Oliver Cunningham, who left the
team for personal reasons, but
still led 43-40 at halftime.
This didn't surprise Smith.
"(Arizona Coach) Lute Olson said
that Stanford could've beaten
anyone in the NCAA tournament
last year," Smith said. "That
probably was true."
Stanford senior guard Scott
Meinert was a key in the first
half, scoring seven points in a 10-2
spurt that put Stanford ahead 36-
33 late in the first half.
"I'm not the kind of player that
can create a lot," Meinert said.
"All I do is hit the open shots
when they come to me — which
I think is just part of being a
good basketball player. Tonight
the shots in the first half just
happened to come to me."
But North Carolina guard Jeff
Lebo, who led all scorers with 24
points, made a 3-point jumper
that gave the Tar Heels a 51-49
lead with 15:33 left and started
a 13-2 run by the Tar Heels.
Adam Keefe (7 points, all in the
first half) fouled Lebo on the shot.
Lebo then missed the free throw,
but the Tar Heels got the offen
sive rebound and, 14 seconds later
Kevin Madden (16 points) dunked
— the first of three straight buck
ets by the UNC guard. Stanford
never bounced back.
"We definitely were (encour
aged by the first half)," Mont

gomery said. "We wish we had
played the second half the way
we had played the first."
North Carolina led by as much
as 76-62 when Lebo made two
free throws with 5:32 left. Stan
ford closed within eight points
several times but got no closer.
"In the second half we forced
the action, and put ourselves in
the tough situation of having to
play from behind on the road,"
Montgomery said.
To get a glimpse of what went
wrong for the Cardinal, one need
look no further than the rebound
ing statistics: 38 for UNC, 18 for
Stanford.
"We got killed on the boards,"
Montgomery said. "We gave up
117] oltensive boards."
Also, forward Howard Wright
led Stanford with a mere four as
sists. Guards Meinert, Lichti and
Terry Taylor combined for only
five assists.
Also, Stanford shot 54 percent
from the floor in the first half,
but missed the front ends of one
and-ones three times.
Card notes
Stanford forward Bryan
McSwecney returned for the second
time to the site where his father,
Bryan Sr., played from 1960-64 —
including Dean Smith's first three
years at Chapel Hill.
"It was great coming in here and
confronting the mystique of Carolina
basketball," Bryan Jr. said. "It was
special for me to play here.
"I just wish I could have logged a
few more minutes," he added with a
grin.

Forward Howard Wright contributed 13 points and a team-high seven rebounds and four assists to
the Cardinal cause last night, but it wasn't enough to hold off North Carolina.
