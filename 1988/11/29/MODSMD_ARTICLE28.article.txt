# Setter Asper guides the Cardinal
## 
### Laurie McLean 
After spending two years in the
shadow of Wendi Rush, Stanford's All-
America setter and Olympic volleyball
hopeful, this year's starting setter Lara
Asper has proven that she is ready to
play. And in terms of replacing Rush,
Asper has consistently shown that she
can hold her own.
Coming to Stanford as one of the
nation's top setters out of high school,
Asper had to wait two years before be
coming a setter at Stanford. She spent
her freshman year as a backcourt spe
cialist and had a somewhat frustrating
sophomore year playing right-side hit
ter, opposite the setter, and not getting
the amount of practice time setting that
she would have liked.
This season, however, Asper is back
doing what she loves and is getting
plenty of practice doing it. "I'm really
excited to be setting. I've been looking
forward to it for a long time," Asper
says."I spent the entire summer at
home training and concentrating on my
new setting responsibility."
It is apparent that the time she spent
preparing for her new responsibilities
was time well spent. Asper has led the
Stanford spikers to an overall record of
27-2 and finished the regular season
ranked second in the Pacific 10 Con
ference in assists.
As the setter, Asper plays a crucial
role in the overall performance of the
team. Fortunately, she has the ability
to concentrate as well as the natural

'There aren't enough
good things to say about
the team. They make it
easy for me to do my job.
The fact that we are so
close and into pushing
each other and helping
each other out makes it
simple. It's a team effort.'

charisma and enthusiasm required to
be good at what she does.
"Lara has a really hard position be
cause she basically has to run the of
fense. It is a hard position to have
because you always have to be think
ing," Cardinal captain Laura Olesen
comments. "Everyone can be
celebrating a play and she has to be
thinking about where the blockers are
on either side of the net and where the
hitters are and who's the strongest
where. She does a great job of staying
in control.
"Sometimes she may not get credit
for leading everybody, but she does a
good job," Olesen continues. "Basically,
she's a great person and very positive.
She really tries to get everyone fired

up and psyched to play."
Freshman hitter Kristin Klein adds,
"I know when she gives me a certain
look what she wants me to do. She leads
the team calmly, she's not really loud.
She is really positive and gets the job
done. She is a great hustler. She sets
the ball quickly"
Being a part of the team and playing
a leading role are two things that Asper
extremely enjoys.
"There aren't enough good things to
say about the team. They make it easy
for me to do my job," Asper says."The
fact that we are so close and into push
ing each other and helping each other
out makes it simple. It's a team effort.
When we win or lose, you can't single
out one person.
"And especially this year, as compared
to years past, people are much more
interested in the team success than the
individual success. And I think that that
has helped us out a lot this year."
Asper believes that if the squad con
tinues to play at its current level that
its chances of winning the national title
are good.
"Right now the attitude of the team
is really good. The worst thing that we
could do now would be to give anything
less than 100 percent," she says."In
years past we've always played great
up until the end, and then, somehow,
we couldn't do it. We may win now,
but it's at the end that counts. In order

to win in the end, we have to
keep doing what we're doing, and
that's giving 100 percent."
Off the court, Asper is a recently
declared English with an
interest in creative writing. She
really eryoys life on the Farm and
is just happy to be a part of it all.
"It's amazing how many special
people are here, so many neat
people, that I feel so lucky to
know," she says."It seems as if
everyone here has something
amazing about them." Just in
talking to her, it is obvious that
her enthusiasm for volleyball
carries over into her everyday life.
With so many positive factors,
it is no wonder that Asper has
been a leading factor in the Car
dinal's impressive record this
season. Stanford Coach Don Shaw
has nothing but praise for his
starting setter.
"Lara has been in Wendi's
shadow all her life, in high school
and in club. She hasn't gotten the
credit that she deserves," Shaw
says. "Now this is her chance.
Wendi Rush has graduated, now
Lara can be Lara Asper. Now she's
running the offense and is doing
a great job at it."

doing what she loves and is getting
plenty of practice doing it. "I'm really
excited to be setting. I've been looking
forward to it for a long time," Asper
says."I spent the entire summer at
home training and concentrating on my
new setting responsibility."
It is apparent that the time she spent
preparing for her new responsibilities
was time well spent. Asper has led the
Stanford spikers to an overall record of
27-2 and finished the regular season
ranked second in the Pacific 10 Con
ference in assists.
As the setter, Asper plays a crucial
role in the overall performance of the
team. Fortunately, she has the ability

good things to say about

charisma and enthusiasm required to
be good at what she does.
"Lara has a really hard position be
cause she basically has to run the of
fense. It is a hard position to have
because you always have to be think
ing," Cardinal captain Laura Olesen
comments. "Everyone can be
celebrating a play and she has to be
thinking about where the blockers are
on either side of the net and where the
hitters are and who's the strongest
where. She does a great job of staying
in control.
"Sometimes she may not get credit
for leading everybody, but she does a
good job," Olesen continues. "Basically,
she's a great person and very positive.
She really tries to get everyone fired

up and psyched to play."
Freshman hitter Kristin Klein adds,
"I know when she gives me a certain
look what she wants me to do. She leads
the team calmly, she's not really loud.
She is really positive and gets the job
done. She is a great hustler. She sets
the ball quickly"
Being a part of the team and playing
a leading role are two things that Asper
extremely enjoys.
"There aren't enough good things to
say about the team. They make it easy
for me to do my job," Asper says."The
fact that we are so close and into push
ing each other and helping each other
out makes it simple. It's a team effort.
When we win or lose, you can't single
out one person.
"And especially this year, as compared
to years past, people are much more
interested in the team success than the
individual success. And I think that that
has helped us out a lot this year."
Asper believes that if the squad con
tinues to play at its current level that
its chances of winning the national title
are good.
"Right now the attitude of the team
is really good. The worst thing that we
could do now would be to give anything
less than 100 percent," she says."In
years past we've always played great
up until the end, and then, somehow,
we couldn't do it. We may win now,
but it's at the end that counts. In order

to win in the end, we have to
keep doing what we're doing, and
that's giving 100 percent."
Off the court, Asper is a recently
declared English with an
interest in creative writing. She
really eryoys life on the Farm and
is just happy to be a part of it all.
"It's amazing how many special
people are here, so many neat
people, that I feel so lucky to
know," she says."It seems as if
everyone here has something
amazing about them." Just in
talking to her, it is obvious that
her enthusiasm for volleyball
carries over into her everyday life.
With so many positive factors,
it is no wonder that Asper has
been a leading factor in the Car
dinal's impressive record this
season. Stanford Coach Don Shaw
has nothing but praise for his
starting setter.
"Lara has been in Wendi's
shadow all her life, in high school
and in club. She hasn't gotten the
credit that she deserves," Shaw
says. "Now this is her chance.
Wendi Rush has graduated, now
Lara can be Lara Asper. Now she's
running the offense and is doing
a great job at it."
After spending two years in the
shadow of Wendi Rush, Stanford's All-
America setter and Olympic volleyball
hopeful, this year's starting setter Lara
Asper has proven that she is ready to
play. And in terms of replacing Rush,
Asper has consistently shown that she
can hold her own.
Coming to Stanford as one of the
nation's top setters out of high school,
Asper had to wait two years before be
coming a setter at Stanford. She spent
her freshman year as a backcourt spe
cialist and had a somewhat frustrating
sophomore year playing right-side hit
ter, opposite the setter, and not getting
the amount of practice time setting that
she would have liked.
This season, however, Asper is back
doing what she loves and is getting
plenty of practice doing it. "I'm really
