# Women's hoops at Fresno
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
In tonight's game at Fresno State, the
Stanford women's basketball team may
have more problems with the crowd than
with the Bulldogs. Playing to a projected
packed crowd in a gym not much bigger
than Roble, the Cardinal continues its
season after a blowout opening win against
Wisconsin last Friday.
The 119-62 victory, besides setting a
Pacific 10 Conference team scoring record,
started Stanford's season off on sound
footing and validated all of the accolades
that have been inundating the Farm.
Ranked 10th preseason by Street and
Smith's and sixth on the current Associated
Press poll (the team's highest ranking
ever), the Cardinal has established itself
as one of the powerhouse programs on the
West Coast.
Fresno State, who until last year had its
way with Stanford almost every time they
met, would like to voice its own opinion.
Bolstered by a big front line and a tangible
home-court advantage, the Bulldogs will
try to avenge last year's 61-53 loss.
"The place will be sold out and they will
be loud and really try to intimidate our
team," Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer
said. "But hopefully our experience at Mon
tana and Texas (in the NCAA tournament)
will help us with that. The crowd will really
take it to us — it's not an easy place to
play."
The other challenge will come from
Fresno's unheralded talent and the big
front line. Sizeable and quick, the Bulldogs
utilize an effective zone defense that gave
Stanford trouble in the first half last year.
The team also boasts a strong center,
Simone Srubek. Towering at 6-foot-6,
Srubek proved a defensive hassle for the
Stanford shooters last season.

"She blocked I think at least 25 shots
— it wasn't that many, but it felt like 25
shots," VanDerveer recalled. "She really
clogs up the middle."
But the key last year was rebounding,
a lesson VanDerveer hopes her players re
member tonight. If Stanford can contro»
the boards, its transition offense will be
all that more effective.
On that count, Evon Asforis can expect
to see action early in the game. The senior
forward led the team in rebounding against
Wisconsin and could well do the same
again.
In fact, the entire front line for Stanford
should contribute nicely to the cause, if
Friday night was a reasonable indicator.
With everyone who was able to play re
ceiving time against Wisconsin, the Cardi
nal proved that it is one of the deepest
teams around, especially among the for
wards.
"They've got quick moves inside, our big
people do, and if they double up our post
(they're) really good at kicking the ball
out," guard Martha Richards said. "If we
get our high-low combinations going, I
think we should be able to take it to them."
Whatever happens, the Cardinal is de
termined to set the pace and win the game
its own way. Rather than taking a reactive
role, the Stanford players will assert their
own style of play and force the home team
to adjust.
"I think we're just trying to play our
game — instead of worrying about what
they're doing, we're going to let the other
team worry about what we're doing," for
ward Trisha Stevens said.
"I think that we've just got to keep in
tense, no matter who we're playing," she
added. "[Friday night] we didn't let up and
we beat them by 50, so I think the key is
to stay tough no matter what the score is."
