# Bridge may lose office space
## Live-in counselors would be displaced, possibly ending 24-hour service 
### Malinda McCollum Staff writer 
University officials are consid
ering eliminating some of the
Bridge's space, placing the future
of the 24-hour counseling service
in jeopardy.
As part of an overall plan to
redistribute University office
space, the Committee on Student
Space recently asked Bridge staff
members to prepare a report jus
tifying the Bridge's live-in stu
dents, according to Eddie Wagner,
one of the live-in counselors.
Currently, four trained students
live in the Bridge, a 24-hour coun
seling service, which also or
ganizes workshops and houses
support groups such as Over
eaters Anonymous and Adult
Children of Alcoholics.
While Bridge staff member
Stephanie Kondik stressed that a
24-hour service is "desperately
needed," Coordinator of Student
Organization Services Michael

Ramsey-Perez said he was not
sure about the necessity of live-in
students or 24-hour counseling at
the Bridge.
Perez, who is co-chair of the
Committee on Student Space, said
the group is "looking to make cer
tain that the Bridge is using the
space it has in the best possible
way."
Asserting that their 18-year old
service is efficient and successful,
Bridge staffer members said 24-
hour counseling is essential to the
Bridge.
"Live-ins are the backbone of
the Bridge," Wagner commented.
"To do it (counseling) without the
live-ins is impossible."
Kondik noted that Bridge staff
members have counseled five stu
dents contemplating suicide this
quarter. Most of the sessions oc
curred past 11 p.m. â€” a time
when "normal support systems
aren't accessible," Wagner said.
Without live-in students, no one
would be available to counsel

people from 11 p.m. to 8 a.m., he
said.
According to Wagner, Bridge
staff members are now busy pre
paring the report for the commit
tee that will "justify" the need
for live-in students. Wagner said
the report will focus on "how live
ins are critical to the Bridge, how
live-ins are critical to a 24-hour
service and how a 24-hour service
is critical to the Bridge."
Ramsey-Perez said committee
members will hold off on a deci
sion until they have looked at the
Bridge's report and will try "to
make recommendations within
the year." But Wagner said "the
implications were clear" that live
in space might be removed.
"We're preparing for the
worst," he added.
According to Wagner, staff
members at the Bridge felt left
out of the committee's decision

making process. "We feel that
somewhere a decision is being
made, and we're not being in
volved."
But Ramsey- Perez said the
committee just wants "a report to
talk about what it is they (Bridge
counselors) do."
"There is nothing secret going
on. We are in consultation with
the Bridge."
While Bridge counselors are
now preparing their report for the
committee, they are also still busy
with advising.
Kondik estimated about 50 stu
dents a quarter use the peer coun
seling service, and about 15
students participate in each of the
seven support groups the Bridge
houses.
