# Are the Irish No. 1?

### 
LOS ANGELES - Stan
ford's claim to the No. 1
spot in college football
was laid Saturday at the Los
Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

Before 93,829 fans, USC and
Notre Dame proved that nei
ther of them should feel secure
with the notion that either is
the best college football team
in the country.
USC showed this in more ob
vious fashion, coming up on
the short end of a 27-10 deci
sion to the Fighting Irish.
But Notre Dame shouldn't
be buying those "We're number
one" T-shirts yet, if ever. Notre
Dame's offense and defense,
despite the big plays and the
big score, bordered on the inept
â€” that is to say, they were far
from ept.
The Fighting Irish scored
four times, yet they only had
one sustained drive, coming in
the fourth quarter with the
game all but out-of-reach.
The winning team's quarter
back, Tony Rice, completed

nine passes for 91 yards. On
an admittedly brilliant call by
Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz,
Notre Dame play-action-faked
on its own 2-yard line on its
first play from scrimmage and
threw long. The receiver, Rag
hib Ismail, was 10-15 yards be
yond any USC defender.
This should have been a 98-
yard touchdown. But Rice
lofted the pass too high, and
while waiting for it, Ismail
tripped and fell down. It was
still an eye-opening 55-yard
pass, but Notre Dame ended
up punting.
Rice passed for 36 yards over
the next 50-plus minutes.
Of course, Rice came back
later in the first quarter with
a 65-yard option sprint down
the left sideline to give Notre
Dame a 7-0 lead. This capped
a scintillating 72-yard, three
play drive by the Fighting
Irish.
There's no denying this was
a fine play as well. But those
two plays accounted for 47 per
cent of Notre Dame's total of
fense for the game.
Notre Dame's next two
scores came on another rip
roaring, wake-up-the-kids
drive of 19 yards, and a 64-yard
interception return by Stan
Smagala after USC receiver
John Jackson fell down while
running his route.
