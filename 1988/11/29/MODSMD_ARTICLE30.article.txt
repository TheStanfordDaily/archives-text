# Are the Irish No. 1?
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES - Stan
ford's claim to the No. 1
spot in college football
was laid Saturday at the Los
Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

Before 93,829 fans, USC and
Notre Dame proved that nei
ther of them should feel secure
with the notion that either is
the best college football team
in the country.
USC showed this in more ob
vious fashion, coming up on
the short end of a 27-10 deci
sion to the Fighting Irish.
But Notre Dame shouldn't
be buying those "We're number
one" T-shirts yet, if ever. Notre
Dame's offense and defense,
despite the big plays and the
big score, bordered on the inept
— that is to say, they were far
from ept.
The Fighting Irish scored
four times, yet they only had
one sustained drive, coming in
the fourth quarter with the
game all but out-of-reach.
The winning team's quarter
back, Tony Rice, completed

nine passes for 91 yards. On
an admittedly brilliant call by
Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz,
Notre Dame play-action-faked
on its own 2-yard line on its
first play from scrimmage and
threw long. The receiver, Rag
hib Ismail, was 10-15 yards be
yond any USC defender.
This should have been a 98-
yard touchdown. But Rice
lofted the pass too high, and
while waiting for it, Ismail
tripped and fell down. It was
still an eye-opening 55-yard
pass, but Notre Dame ended
up punting.
Rice passed for 36 yards over
the next 50-plus minutes.
Of course, Rice came back
later in the first quarter with
a 65-yard option sprint down
the left sideline to give Notre
Dame a 7-0 lead. This capped
a scintillating 72-yard, three
play drive by the Fighting
Irish.
There's no denying this was
a fine play as well. But those
two plays accounted for 47 per
cent of Notre Dame's total of
fense for the game.
Notre Dame's next two
scores came on another rip
roaring, wake-up-the-kids
drive of 19 yards, and a 64-yard
interception return by Stan
Smagala after USC receiver
John Jackson fell down while
running his route.
By the end of the third quar


JON WEISMAN
ter, Notre Dame had four first
downs. After taking its 14-0 lead
late in the first period, Notre
Dame gained seven yards over al
most the entire next two quarters.
Meanwhile, USC was rolling up
356 yards in total offense, and
was only taking itself out of the
game for two reasons: repeated
mistakes (four painful turnovers
and an abhorrent penalty on third
and-goal) and a very un-Stanford
like and seemingly desparate need
to throw long every time it faced
third-and-short.
USC pulled out more stops than
teenage kids going after red signs
at midnight, but put them to no
better use than the kids would.
Still, you say, Notre Dame is
11-0. They won when it counted;
they won with two of their top
players, Ricky Watters and Tony
Brooks, suspended, and according
to NCAA custom (c.f. Brigham
Young, 1984) if the Fighting Irish
defeat 11-0 West Virginia Jan. 2
in the Fiesta Bowl, they would be
the undisputed national cham
pions.
Fine.
But even if Notre Dame is No.
1, the Fighting Irish are far from
perfect. So far from perfect, in
fact, that Stanford would have
beaten them on Saturday.

Notre Dame
shouldn't be
buying those
'We're number one'
T-shirts yet, if ever.

Certainly, it grows a bit
tiresome to hear about how easily
Stanford could have been 5-6, or
7-4, or 10-1, instead of 3-6-2, if
it had only pulled out the close
ones.
Furthermore, Notre Dame was
the one team in 1988 that un
equivocally, mercilessly and com
prehensively destroyed the Cardi
nal this season, with a 42-14
thwacking at South Bend Oct. 1.
But the only thing that the
Notre Dame team I saw was able
to stop was USC's long passes on
third-and-short, and Stanford
never, never threw long on third
and-short. Stanford wouldn't even
risk a pass on first-and-short if it
had the chance.
Call it mere speculation, but
Notre Dame has not shown itself
to be any more of a No. 1 team
than Stanford has. That is to say,
there is no No. 1 team in football
this year — just a bunch of No.
2 teams bunched together.

yard touchdown. But Rice
lofted the pass too high, and
while waiting for it, Ismail
tripped and fell down. It was
still an eye-opening 55-yard
pass, but Notre Dame ended
up punting.
Rice passed for 36 yards over
the next 50-plus minutes.
Of course, Rice came back
later in the first quarter with
a 65-yard option sprint down
the left sideline to give Notre
Dame a 7-0 lead. This capped
a scintillating 72-yard, three
play drive by the Fighting
Irish.
There's no denying this was
a fine play as well. But those
two plays accounted for 47 per
cent of Notre Dame's total of
fense for the game.
Notre Dame's next two
scores came on another rip
roaring, wake-up-the-kids
drive of 19 yards, and a 64-yard
interception return by Stan
Smagala after USC receiver
John Jackson fell down while
running his route.
By the end of the third quar

ter, Notre Dame had four first
downs. After taking its 14-0 lead
late in the first period, Notre
Dame gained seven yards over al
most the entire next two quarters.
Meanwhile, USC was rolling up
356 yards in total offense, and
was only taking itself out of the
game for two reasons: repeated
mistakes (four painful turnovers
and an abhorrent penalty on third
and-goal) and a very un-Stanford
like and seemingly desparate need
to throw long every time it faced
third-and-short.
USC pulled out more stops than
teenage kids going after red signs
at midnight, but put them to no
better use than the kids would.
Still, you say, Notre Dame is
11-0. They won when it counted;
they won with two of their top
players, Ricky Watters and Tony
Brooks, suspended, and according
to NCAA custom (c.f. Brigham
Young, 1984) if the Fighting Irish
defeat 11-0 West Virginia Jan. 2
in the Fiesta Bowl, they would be
the undisputed national cham
pions.
Fine.
But even if Notre Dame is No.
1, the Fighting Irish are far from
perfect. So far from perfect, in
fact, that Stanford would have
beaten them on Saturday.

Notre Dame
shouldn't be
buying those
'We're number one'
T-shirts yet, if ever.

Certainly, it grows a bit
tiresome to hear about how easily
Stanford could have been 5-6, or
7-4, or 10-1, instead of 3-6-2, if
it had only pulled out the close
ones.
Furthermore, Notre Dame was
the one team in 1988 that un
equivocally, mercilessly and com
prehensively destroyed the Cardi
nal this season, with a 42-14
thwacking at South Bend Oct. 1.
But the only thing that the
Notre Dame team I saw was able
to stop was USC's long passes on
third-and-short, and Stanford
never, never threw long on third
and-short. Stanford wouldn't even
risk a pass on first-and-short if it
had the chance.
Call it mere speculation, but
Notre Dame has not shown itself
to be any more of a No. 1 team
than Stanford has. That is to say,
there is no No. 1 team in football
this year — just a bunch of No.
2 teams bunched together.

LOS ANGELES - Stan
ford's claim to the No. 1
spot in college football
was laid Saturday at the Los
Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

Before 93,829 fans, USC and
Notre Dame proved that nei
ther of them should feel secure
with the notion that either is
the best college football team
in the country.
USC showed this in more ob
vious fashion, coming up on
the short end of a 27-10 deci
sion to the Fighting Irish.
But Notre Dame shouldn't
be buying those "We're number
one" T-shirts yet, if ever. Notre
Dame's offense and defense,
despite the big plays and the
big score, bordered on the inept
— that is to say, they were far
from ept.
The Fighting Irish scored
four times, yet they only had
one sustained drive, coming in
the fourth quarter with the
game all but out-of-reach.
The winning team's quarter
back, Tony Rice, completed

nine passes for 91 yards. On
an admittedly brilliant call by
Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz,
Notre Dame play-action-faked
on its own 2-yard line on its
first play from scrimmage and
threw long. The receiver, Rag
hib Ismail, was 10-15 yards be
yond any USC defender.
This should have been a 98-
yard touchdown. But Rice
lofted the pass too high, and
while waiting for it, Ismail
tripped and fell down. It was
still an eye-opening 55-yard
pass, but Notre Dame ended
up punting.
Rice passed for 36 yards over
the next 50-plus minutes.
Of course, Rice came back
later in the first quarter with
a 65-yard option sprint down
the left sideline to give Notre
Dame a 7-0 lead. This capped
