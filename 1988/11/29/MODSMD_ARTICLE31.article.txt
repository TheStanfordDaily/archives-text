# Golfers in fourth place
## 
### Eugene Sakai Staff writer 
It was apparently something
in the weather that didn't agree
with them.
Bidding good riddance to the
driving rain and pea soup-thick
fog of the Olympic Course in
San Francisco, the Stanford
men's golf team played their
way into a tie for fourth place
after yesterday's first round of
action at the Rebel Classic in
Las Vegas, Nevada.
The Cardinal's team total of
299 leaves them trailing only
Fresno State, Oklahoma State,
and Arizona State with two
more rounds forthcoming.
Fresno's 295 paced the field.
As one might expect from a
young yet highly talented team,
Stanford's play this season has
been somewhat erratic. After
storming back in the final round
to win the UOP invitational a
little over a month ago, the
linksters could manage only a
lOth-place finish at the USF In
tercollegiate at Olympic.
"There are only two teams
from the Pac-10 here...so this
is basically a Big West tourney.

With a well-rested Cevaer and a
rejuvenated Mahon in tow, Goodwin is
expecting a strong final two rounds out of
his team. 'It's good to see that no one ran
out and got away from us. I think we have a
chance.'

This is definitely an important
tournament for us," Stanford
Coach Wally Goodwin said, re
ferring to the fact that the
NCAA regional tournament se
lection committee is following
the progress of all of the teams
in the Western region very close
ly-
The Cardinal was led by
senior John Mahon, who has ex
perienced a resurrection of
sorts. After being one of the
team's top golfers a year ago,
Mahon has struggled somewhat
this season. If his opening
round 73 is an indication that
he has returned to last season's
form, the team could become
even more competitive.
In what is a first for his
heretofore meteoric collegiate

career, frosh Christian Cevaer
shot the team's high score, an
uncharacteristic 80.
"Christian came in at mid
night last night and only got
five hours of sleep," Goodwin
said. The reason for Cevaer's
tardy arrival in Las Vegas is
that he was competing in the
American Junior Golf Classic in
Innsbrook, Florida, where he
qualified for the championship
round of 16 before being elim
inated in the third round of play.
