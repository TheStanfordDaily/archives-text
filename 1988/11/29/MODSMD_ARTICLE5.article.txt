"Europe and the Americas," this
year's experimental Area One course, is
proving to be an excellent model for
next year's Cultures, Ideas and Values

current knowledge of non-Western cul
ture on a scale from poor to excellent.
With 48 students, "Europe and the
Americas" was deemed an experimental
track last year by the Western Culture
Committee. It is the only track this

One Committee is a new body designed

the committee during winter quarter.

Western country and to concentrate on
issues of class, gender and race. The
