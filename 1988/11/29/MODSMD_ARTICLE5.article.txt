# Experimental Area One track doing well
## 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
"Europe and the Americas," this
year's experimental Area One course, is
proving to be an excellent model for
next year's Cultures, Ideas and Values
tracks, according to its instructors and
students.
This course, in accordance with CIV
legislation, pays substantial attention to
race, gender and class through its
reading list. Instructors continually
"show the playback between Europe and
America," said Anthropology Prof.
Renato Rosaldo, one of three faculty
members teaching the course.

It explores a series of themes by jux
taposing modern, non-Western writings
with canon texts, according to Classics
and Comparative Literature Prof. Greg
son Davis, who also teaches the course.
Statements declaring the initial suc
cess of the course follow a recently re
leased survey in which a majority of
the Class of 1988 stated they only had
a fair knowledge of non-Western cul
ture. A total of 640 seniors ranked their
current knowledge of non-Western cul
ture on a scale from poor to excellent.
With 48 students, "Europe and the
Americas" was deemed an experimental
track last year by the Western Culture
Committee. It is the only track this

year following CIV legislation, which
goes into effect next fall.
However, the course has to be ap
proved by the Area One Committee in
order to continue next year. The Area
One Committee is a new body designed
to ensure that all tracks conform to
CIV standards. "Europe and the Amer
icas" will come under consideration by
the committee during winter quarter.
Last year, the Faculty Senate voted
to expand the Western Culture require
ment to include the study of one non-
Western country and to concentrate on
issues of class, gender and race. The
implementation of CIV guidelines
came after more than a year of
students and faculty members
calling for change, which gained
national media attention.
Rosaldo pointed out that the
books chosen for the course "are
classics in their own right," al
though they are not seen as part
of the accepted canon in regular
Western culture classes.
Some of the authors read this
quarter are Juan Rulfo, a Latin-
American writer; Zora Neale
Hurston, an Afro-American
woman who wrote in the 1930s
and '40s; and Sandra Cisneros,
another contemporary Latin-
American author.
Rosaldo added that such canon
authors as St. Augustine, Karl

Marx and Sigmund Freud are also
assigned.
Assoc. Spanish and Portugese
Prof. Mary Pratt, the third in
structor of the course, said the
combination of canon and non
canon writers strikes a happy
medium, which creates a class
that is "more exciting than imag
ined."
Pratt and Rosaldo said approval
for the track is not as big a hurdle
as finding depth of faculty to
teach the course next year. They
will have to look for someone else
to help teach the track next year
when Davis leaves Stanford for a
professorship at Cornell Univer
sity.
Rosaldo said the ideal number
of faculty for the course ranges
from six to 10. He said they might
look for instructors who are affil
iated with the American Studies
program or from the Cultural
Studies Research Group, a collec

tion of about 13 faculty members
in a reading group.
While the search to keep the
course going next year has begun,
the freshmen in the track seem
to be eryoying their studies and
find it a good alternative to the
current Western Culture tracks.
Chris Eisenberg said he took
the course so that he could see
what the controversy surrounding
Area One was all about. He said
he expected nothing from the
course and knew nothing about
"Europe and the Americas."
Eisenberg said he learned "it is
possible to look at subjects in a
new manner."
Eisenberg said he was also in
trigued at being part of the expe
rimental track. "I felt like I was
just a part of the experiment. .. .
I knew it was not going to be
stale [because] the professors are
going through it just like we are."
