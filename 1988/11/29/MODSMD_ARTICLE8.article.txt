# Lack of minority faculty impedes implementation of CIV program
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Senior staff writer 
A lack of sufficient numbers of faculty
members qualified to teach ethnic and
women's studies might impede the transi
tion in Stanford's Area One requirement,
University officials said yesterday.
Currently, nine faculty members and
three students are part of the Area One
Committee â€” a group that is overseeing
this year's change of the Western Culture
requirement to Cultures, Ideas and Values.
Faced with establishing guidelines to
evaluate and approve existing and proposed

CIV tracks, which are supposed to be fully
implemented next fall, the committee was
established last March by the Faculty Sen
ate.
According to Faculty Senate CIV legis
lation, the Area One tracks should "con
front issues relating to class, ethnicity, race,
religion, gender and sexual orientation, and
. . . include the study of works by women,
minorities and persons of color."
Despite this call for a more diverse cur
riculum, committee member Clay Carson
said the group is not likely to bring about
substantial change unless the
University hires more professors
in ethnic and women's studies.
Carson, an associate professor
of history, said he fears that the
few qualified faculty members
who can teach next year's CIV
tracks are already overburdened.
"When you only have one per
son in the Afro-American history
field or one in Islamic history or
one who teaches women's
studies," it is unfair to ask these
faculty members to take on the
added responsibilty of creating
and teaching a new CIV track, he
said.
Carson called for a greater Uni
versity commitment to hiring
more women and minority faculty
members. Stanford "has to be

serious about its commitment to
bring women and racial minorities
onto the faculty," he said.
Committee chair Paul Robinson
said this "shortage of qualified
and willing people" to teach and
develop the new tracks has
resulted in a lack of proposals for
CIV tracks. According to CIV leg
islation, the committee must ap
prove six to 10 tracks for the re
quirement.
But so far, this year's experi
mental Area One track "Europe
and the Americas" is the only pro
posal the group has received. If
the committee does not receive
any new proposals CIV will con
sist of revamped Western Culture
tracks.
Although encouraging faculty to
develop new tracks is a msyor goal
of the committee, those qualified
to propose new tracks are "over
burdened" with other responsibil
ities, according to sophomore

Hilary Skillings, a student com
mittee member.
For these faculty members to
develop and teach new tracks
"would mean giving up teaching
something else, say in ethnic
studies," she said. Yet, "who is
better to teach [minority issues]
than minority faculty."
Carson added he hoped that, in
approving new tracks, the com
mittee would "not just give token
recognition of the contribution of
non-whites and women to Western
culture but [would] instead alter
the basic themes of the courses."
"I would like to see these kinds
of concerns made central rather
than peripheral," he said.
Committee member Louis Jack
son, a sophomore, also expressed
fear that there is insufficient mi
nority representation on the fac
ulty and that, consequently, the
Area One requirement "is not
going to significantly change."
