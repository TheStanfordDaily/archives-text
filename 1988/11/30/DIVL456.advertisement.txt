COMMITTEE OF THE WEEK
The Committee on Athletics, Physical Education and
Recreation (CAPER) deals with the University politics
in the areas of intercollegiate and internal athletic,
physical education and recreation programs.
Last year the committee's activities included creating a
revised stadium alcohol policy, creating a stadium
smoking policy, discussing maintenance problems in
DeGuerre's locker rooms, setting priorities for
renovating and building athletic facilities and
reviewing a report from the Band.
This year the committee will be looking at the AFIRE
fund for students in non-varsity sports and the effect
that a possible decision by the Committe on
Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid to
require Achievement Tests may have on recruiting, as
well as other issues.
If you have any comments, questions, or complaints
about the condition of University athletic facilities,
varsity or non-varsity sports, intramurals, etc., you can
contact either of the student members on the
committee.
