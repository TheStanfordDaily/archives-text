Arab-Americans upset
Arafat was denied visa

In response to a local Arab-
American organization's call to
bar Secretary of State George
Shultz from teaching in Stanford
classrooms, University officials
yesterday dismissed the group's
demand as politically motivated
and not educationally based.
On Monday, the South Bay

Arab-American
Organization
wrote a letter to
University Presi
dent Donald Ken
nedy, stating that
Shultz should be
denied his teach
ing position be
cause he refused
to grant PLO

chief Yasser Arafat a visa to enter
the United States and address the
United Nations in New York on
Palestinian independence.
The Reagan Adminstration an
nounced Saturday that Arafat
would not be permitted to enter
the United States because he
"knows of, condones and lends
support to" acts of terrorism.
Shultz decided not to recommend
a waiver of the law that prohibits
people identified as terrorists to
enter the country.
"We feel that a university is a
place where people are given the
opportunity to give differing view
points, a place of academic free
dom," said Victor Aljouny, the or
ganization's coordinator.
"Based on his recent decision,
we feel Mr. Shultz obviously does
not uphold the same ideals of open
discussion," he said.
Shultz was appointed an
honorary fellow of the Hoover In
stitution last year and is a pro
fessor of international economics
for the Graduate School of Busi
ness. He is expected to return to
Stanford when the Reagan admin
istration leaves office in January.
Faculty at both Hoover and the
Business School said the organi
zation's unusual request should


Shultz
