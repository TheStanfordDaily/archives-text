Arab-Americans upset
Arafat was denied visa

In response to a local Arab-
American organization's call to
bar Secretary of State George
Shultz from teaching in Stanford
classrooms, University officials
yesterday dismissed the group's
demand as politically motivated
and not educationally based.
On Monday, the South Bay

Arab-American
Organization
wrote a letter to
University Presi
dent Donald Ken
nedy, stating that
Shultz should be
denied his teach
ing position be
cause he refused
to grant PLO

chief Yasser Arafat a visa to enter
the United States and address the
United Nations in New York on
Palestinian independence.
The Reagan Adminstration an
nounced Saturday that Arafat
would not be permitted to enter
the United States because he
"knows of, condones and lends
support to" acts of terrorism.
Shultz decided not to recommend
a waiver of the law that prohibits
people identified as terrorists to
enter the country.
"We feel that a university is a
place where people are given the
opportunity to give differing view
points, a place of academic free
dom," said Victor Aljouny, the or
ganization's coordinator.
"Based on his recent decision,
we feel Mr. Shultz obviously does
not uphold the same ideals of open
discussion," he said.
Shultz was appointed an
honorary fellow of the Hoover In
stitution last year and is a pro
fessor of international economics
for the Graduate School of Busi
ness. He is expected to return to
Stanford when the Reagan admin
istration leaves office in January.
Faculty at both Hoover and the
Business School said the organi
zation's unusual request should


Shultz
not affect Shultz's positions at
Stanford.
"It doesn't make any sense,"
said Charles Bonini, associate
dean of the Business School. "It's
a political statement by a group.
I don't think they expect it to
really happen."
Hoover Senior Fellow Kenneth
Arrow called the request "a
remarkable invasion of academic
freedom" and added, "I don't
think it will have any effect."
John Ferejohn, a senior fellow
at Hoover, said, "It seems silly to
me. I don't see the point of this."
Mandy Maccalla, an assistant
in the Office of the President, said
that although her office received
the letter yesterday, Kennedy had
not seen it yet.
Ajlouny said his organization
represents seven South Bay Arab

American groups, each of which
has a membership of 100 to 150.
The group holds Shultz entirely
responsible for the restriction of
Arafat.
"[ShultzJ openly admits it was
his decision and he made it on
his own without consulting
anyone above him," Ajlouny said.
"If you were to look at the broad
spectrum and Shultz's feeble rea
son for denying the visa, you
would find that he doesn't want
to hear opposing views."
Defending Shultz's decision,
senior Vered Sharon, co-chair of
Stanford's Hillel Committee for
Peace in the Middle East, said
Arafat did not receive a visa be
cause of the PLO's use of terrorist
tactics both in Israel and the
United States.
"To say someone cannot teach
because of his political views is
discriminatory," Sharon said,
Sharon added that her views
were not the official position of
the Hillel Foundation.
