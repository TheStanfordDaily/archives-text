# Fast will raise money to feed the hungry
## 
### Nathanael Cousins Staff writer 
To encourage campus-wide
participation in a hunger relief
effort, Cathy Ross of the Stan
ford International Development
Organization is asking students
to "experience a little of what
world hunger is like" by fasting
all day Thursday.
By not eating at University
Food Service on Thursday, stu
dents can help relieve local and
world hunger, according to Ross,
who is helping to plan Thurs
day's fast for SIDO and the
Stanford Project on Nutrition,
better known as SPOON.
For each student who fasts to
morrow, University Food Service

will donate the money it saves
in food expenses to SIDO and
SPOON.
"Sometimes people think that
an individual can't do much
alone, but with our group move
ment we have been able to do
some impressive things and
change people's lives," she said.
"Our goal is first to increase
awareness," said Ross, a resident
assistant at Mirlo. "But we don't
want people to have a guilt trip.
That is the wrong motivation."
Students who do not have a
Food Service meal plan can also
help by donating to the program
individually or as a group, Ross
said.
For example, Toyon students
have created an arrangement

with the eating clubs that allows
them to fast and donate the
money to the hunger project.
"It's a great thing to do," said
Toyon freshman Howard Chow.
"It's not a big religious thing,
but if it helps somebody, then
all the better."
According to Lois Ohms, a
Food Service dietician, the Uni
versity will donate $1.85 for each
meal a student misses on Thurs
day. She estimated that up to
half of the students with Food
Service meal plans had partici
pated in the fast in past years.
Ohms predicted a strong turn
out this week because of good
organization and publicity.
"We lose money, but we've al
ways done it and we believe it

is the right thing to do," said
Ohms, adding that overhead and
labor costs prevented the dona
tion from being larger.
"[University Food Service] is
very helpful," said Ross. "It is
really a hassle for them."
Proceeds from the fast, which
totaled about $4,000 last year,
will be used to combat local and
world hunger and to support
world development projects, ac
cording to Steve Babb of the
Overseas Development Network.
Sixty percent of the funds sup
port SIDO projects abroad, Babb
said.
Money from the fast will also
fund an emergency food project
in East Palo Alto.
