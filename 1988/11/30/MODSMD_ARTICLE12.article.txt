# COP's dorm rep program
## gauges campus opinion 
### Aileen Resnick Staff writer 
In an effort to keep students
informed about the ASSU, the
Council of Presidents has
recruited more than 100 students
for its Dorm Representatives pro
gram, which began last month.
According to COP member
Miguel Marquez, the goal of the
Dorm Rep program is "to keep in
touch with students" on the issues
and events important to the
ASSU.
The dorm representatives are
responsible for "find[ing] out
what students in their dorm think
about the issues we work on,
ask[ing] them what things they
would like to see the ASSU work

on (and) inform[ing] students
about our upcoming projects and
activities," according to a COP
statement.
This quarter, the program has
recruited dorm reps from Stern,
Wilbur, Lagunita, Florence
Moore, Branner and Toyon Halls.
The COP plans to involve students
housed in the Row, Sterling Quad
and other upperclass housing
complexes next quarter.
COP member Stacey Leyton
said the people involved in the
program represent a "pretty good
mix of opinions" on campus con
cerns.
"The thing that's helped the
most is that ... dorm reps are
providing angles about issues,"
Leyton t aid. "It has been their
initiative that's made it work so
far."
ASSI' senators conduct weekly
meeting; with dorm reps, and at
least one COP member attends
each meeting.
Marquez said the meetings aim
to address topics that students
may not know much about. Past
meetings, i'or example, have dealt
with the issue of cutbacks in
teaching assistants' wages and the
Students of Color Coalition's
"1 andate for Change."
The meetings provide a "non
threatening atmosphere where
people can be comfortable raising
questions," Leyton said.

The COP has been recruiting
people to be dorm reps since the
start of the year, said Leyton.
Between 75 and 85 percent of
the dorm representatives are
freshmen, she said.
The program may be more
popular among freshmen "par
tially because we did a recruit
ment drive among freshmen, and
also because a lot of people have
a negative opinion of the ASSU,"
Leyton speculated.
Freshman Kelly Breslin, a dorm
rep in Paloma House, said the
program "gives a chance for fresh
men and other students to get
involved'.'
Breslin said she learned about
COP-sponsored committees such
as the recently-formed Committee
on Democratic Education through
the dorm rep meetings.
