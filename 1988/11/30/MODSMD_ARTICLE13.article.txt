## Canada to extradite Ng 
### 
EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) â€”
A judge ruled yesterday that
Charles Ng should be extradited
to the United States to stand trial
for a string of sex-related murders
in California.
Justice Marguerite Trussler of
Alberta Court of Queen's Bench
decided that the former U.S.
Marine, born in Hong Kong,
should be extradited on 19 of the
25 offenses he is charged with in
California. She said she would
issue a warrant that would keep
Ng in prison in Canada until he
is surrendered to U.S. authorities.

Charges of murder, kidnapping
and burglary have been filed
against Ng in California. He is
accused in the murders of 12
people.
Eleven of the deaths of men,
women and children involved
grisly sex slayings at a rural cabin
in Calaveras County, 120 miles
east of San Francisco. The 12th
involved the death of a San Fran
cisco disc jockey.
Ng could face the gas chamber
if convicted.
Defense lawyer Don MacLeod
said he will appeal Judge Trus

sler's ruling. MacLeod said earlier
arguments could take the case all
the way to the Supreme Court of
Canada, which could take up to
five years.
Ng, who was educated in British
private schools, is serving a 4-year
sentence at a maximum-security
federal penitentiary in Prince Al
bert, Saskatchewan, for shooting
a security guard in the hand in
December 1985 during a botched
shoplifting attempt at a depart
ment store in Calgary.
The judge dismissed five other
charges.
