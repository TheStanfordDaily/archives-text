LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” An 18-year-old man who
was released from a juvenile probation camp this
summer has been arrested for investigation of two
rapes and an attempted kidnapping at the University
of Southern California, police said yesterday.
Deon Proby of Los Angeles was arrested Thanks
giving Day for investigation of a kidnapping and
robbery that occurred earlier in the day in North
Hollywood, said Sgt. Dan Pugel. Bail was set at
$250,000.
Detectives subsequently began investigating Proby
in connection with three attacks on women at USC
in the last two months, he said.
A fourth assault occurred on Friday, after Proby

was jailed, and authorities said at the time that it
appeared unrelated to the earlier attacks because
the assailant's description differed.
Detective John Rice said Proby was being held
for investigation of rapes that occurred Oct. 29 and
Nov. 5, and an attempted kidnapping on Nov. 9.
During the Nov. 9 attack the assailant was fright
ened off by a passer-by, but did steal the victim's
car, which was later recovered, he said.
In the North Hollywood incident the assailant
approached two women and forced them to drive
off with him in their car at gunpoint. They were
later released. Rice said the women were not sexually
assaulted.
