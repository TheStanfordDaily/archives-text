# World Health Organization lowers AIDS estimates

### 
GENEVA (AP) - The World Health
Organization yesterday slashed its esti
mate of the number of people expected
to contract AIDS by 1991, saying the
lower figures resulted from changes in
the behavior of high-risk groups.
The organization projected that within
the next three years, six to seven million
people are expected to be infected with
the HIV virus that causes the fatal dis
ease.
That figure is sharply lower than
WHO's estimate in March 1987, when it
said 50 million to 100 million people could
be infected by 1991. That report said
even that estimate "will be conservative

if HIV penetrates and spreads through
South America and Asia."
In its statement yesterday WHO also
said the worldwide total of officially re
ported AIDS cases climbed to 129,385 in
142 countries in November, an increase
of 4.1 percent from October.
It estimated that the true number of
AIDS victims was twice the reported
number, and that five to 10 million people
worldwide may currently be infected with
the HIV virus.
AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, is a disease in which a virus
attacks the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to a wide va

riety of infections and cancers. There is
no known cure.
AIDS is most often transmitted
through sexual contact. Other means of
transmission include transfusions of
tainted blood or blood products, and the
sharing of contaminated hypodermic
needles or syringes by drug abusers.
AIDS can also be passed from mother to
child at or before birth.
Jonathan Mann, director of WHO's
special program on AIDS, told a news
conference that the organization sees
"evidence for optimism in the question
of people's behavior.
"We have seen dramatic evidence of

worldwide may currently

virus.

behavior change" in high-risk groups
such as female prostitutes, male homo
sexuals and intravenous drug users of
some countries, Mann said.
He said, for example, that in San Fran
cisco in 1982, the infection rate for
homosexual men was about 15 percent a

year. But the figure now is one percent,
Mann said, because many gay men have
begun taking precautions such as using
condoms and reducing the number of sex
partners.
He said in Amsterdam the figure has
dropped from 10 percent in 1983 to less
than one percent.
But he cautioned that "the evidence is
clear that the danger is widespread and
is continuing to spread."
Mann also said WHO is "a bit optimis
tic" that HIV will spread less than earlier
predicted because worldwide education
programs have been successful in inform
ing people how to avoid getting AIDS.
