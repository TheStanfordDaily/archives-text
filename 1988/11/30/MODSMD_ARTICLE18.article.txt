# U.S. groups lobby Israeli leaders
## Jewish groups protest controversial 'Who is a Jew' legislation 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) - Leaders
of 25 major U.S. Jewish groups
met with Israeli officials yester
day to lobby against a controver
sial new proposal that would nar
row the definition of a Jew.
The delegation met with Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir and
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
on the first day of a two-day visit
to Israel to protest the so-called
"Who is a Jew" legislation.
Four religious parties emerged
as power brokers in the Nov. 1
election. They won a promise from
Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc
that a Likud-led government will
pass legislation granting Orthodox
rabbis sole power over conver
sions to Judaism.
Such legislation has been pro
posed in various forms, including
as an amendment to the Law of

Return, which now defines Jews
as those born to a Jewish mother
or converted to Judaism. The
amendment would add the phrase
"converted according to Orthodox
regulations."
Most affiliated American Jews
belong to the Reform and Con
servative streams of Judaism and
many consider such legislation a
symbolic repudiation. It would
prevent Reform and Conservative
converts from emigrating to Israel
under the Law of Return.
Rabbi Daniel Syme of Stamford,
Conn., vice president of the
Reform movement's Union of
American Hebrew Congregations,
said the delegates told Shamir and
Peres of the "tremendous anger,
frustration and disillusionment"
felt by American Jews over the

proposed changes.
Both leaders offered disappoint
ing responses, Syme told a news
conference. "Both clearly misread
the depth and the significance of
the emotions attached to any pro
posed change in the Law of
Return."
Syme called Shamir's reaction
a "non-response, a lack of recogni
tion of the significance of the
issue." He said Shamir made no
promises.
Shamir later met with Orthodox
rabbis from the United States who
backed the proposed legislation.
Shamir has said he would keep
his promise to the religious par
ties even if Peres' left-of-center
Labor Party joined a Likud-led
coalition and rendered the reli
gious parties superfluous.
