# U.S. policy toward South Africa decried
## 
### John Wagner Staff writer 
For decades, U.S. policy toward
South Africa has been a "funda
mentally racist" reflection of the
economic interests of "old, white,
rich males" who make government
and corporate decisions, South
Africa expert Kevin Danaher said
Monday night.
Arguing that the United States
needs to encourage further divest
ment and approve more compre
hensive sanctions against South
Africa, Danaher spoke to a 40-
person audience in the Political
Science Building. His talk is part
of "South Africa Awareness
Week," a series of programs spon
sored by Students for a Free
South Africa.
The purpose of the awareness
week is to rekindle an interest at
Stanford in South Africa, said Nat
Sheidley, co-chair of the recently
established student group.
A white U.S. citizen, Danaher
is an author and lecturer as well
as a co-founder of Africa Ex
change, a grassroots organization
in San Francisco that seeks to

teach people how to build direct
links to African development ef
forts.
He has written several books in
which he proposes reforms in U.S
policy toward South Africa.
According to Danaher, sanc
tions and divestment will not
liberate black South Africans but
will force the white minority to
be more receptive to negotiations.
Danaher said for the past cen
tury the white elite in the United
States has had "very close direct
material ties" with the ruling
white minority in South Africa.
These ties, he said, have been es
tablished through trade, invest
ment, diplomatic relations and the
sharing of military intelligence.
Danaher said the results of a
study he recently conducted
revealed that many high U.S. gov
ernment officials sit on corporate
boards that have invested in
South Africa.
"These officials are against pol
icies that would break ties with
South Africa," he said. "There is
no way a white minority that
small is going to rule over such
a large majority without outside
help."
White South Africans con
stitute less than 15 percent of the
country's population, Danaher
said.
Casual expressions of racism
made by leading U.S. policy
makers are also indicative of an
underlying racial bias that affects
U.S. dealings with South Africa,
he said.
Danaher said U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Chester
Crocker told him in 1980, "All
Reagan knows about Southern
Africa is [that] he's on the side
of the wh'ites."
Danaher called Reagan "the
most right-wing racist president
we've had."
U.S policy-makers are also

blinded by the racist assumption
that oppressed peoples in South
Africa, and in the Third World,
are motivated to rebel against
their governments primarily by
communist ideology, he added.
Policies that reflect such an as
sumption, he explained, are "fun
damentally racist."
"It is saying people of color —
be they in Asia, Latin America or
Africa — are so ignorant and are
so passive that they will not rebel
because their children are starv
ing, but will rebel because some
white guy from Moscow comes
and says, 'Hey look, this book by
Lenin says you should rebel,'" he
said.
Individuals in Third World
countries, Danaher said, are
viewed by the U.S. government as
"inanimate objects, not thinking
people can take control of their
own lives."
U.S. policymakers are also
racist in their assumption that
liberated countries desire to fall

under Soviet control, he said.
"It is equally racist to assume
that when a Third World country
succeeds in accomplishing an
overthrow of the previous regime,
the first thing they're going to do
is run to Moscow and say, 'Here,
take control of us please,'" he said.
To further illustrate his point,
Danaher asked the audience to
imagine what policy the United
States would pursue if the racial
situation in South Africa were
reversed.
"If a black minority government
attacked nine neighboring white
countries in its region and were
shooting white South African
children dead in the street, how
many days would it take Western
gunboats to appear off the coast
of South Africa?" he asked.
If such were the case, U.S.
troops would have intervened
"decades ago," Danaher said.
In addition to the racist bias of
government officials, the Ameri
can public has been indoctrinated

by a number of myths that rein
force the bias of the white elite,
Danaher said.
As an example, he cited the ten
dency of the press to describe
apartheid as "a system of segre
gation" or "racial separation."
"It's as if black people are just
dying to be next to us white
people," he said.
The real struggle, Danaher said,
is not simply for integrating the
use of public facilities, but for end
ing "a system of labor control."
Borrowing the words of a black
South African trade union organ
izer, Danaher said, "Liberation is
not me being able to put my ass
on a toilet seat that you sat on."
According to Danaher, U.S.
policy toward South Africa ulti
mately reflects a "bigger ques
tion!'
"We let old, rich white men run
the country," he said. "For cen
turies they've been screwing it up.
Are we going to have real democ
racy here or not?"
