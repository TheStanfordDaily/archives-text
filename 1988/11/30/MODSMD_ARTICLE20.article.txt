## Living Dead Week 
### 
It is that time of the
quarter and we still
have Dead Week classes

DEAD WEEK — a dead time
period when students can
concentrate their efforts on
synthesizing course material with
out distraction, or a period when
students go brain-dead due to an
overflow of new material?
The intent of Stanford's policy
reflects the first purpose, but
reality for students more closely
resembles the latter. Often during
Dead Week, instructors bombard
students with a combination of as
signments, term papers, lectures
and review sessions.
According to the Dead Week
Policy Statement, which appears in
the Time Schedule, "Dead Week is
a period of reduced social and ex
tracurricular activity preceding
final examinations. Its purpose is
to permit students to concentrate
on academic work and to prepare
for final examinations."
Unfortunately, several ambigu
ous words that appear later in the
Dead Week statement allow for new
course work, preventing students
from total concentration and from
a true integration of the quarter's
material.
According to the statement, work
can be due or even assigned during
Dead Week, as long as it is
"routine," assigned with "reason
able notice," and not "extraordi
nary."
In addition, classes can be "reg
ularly scheduled" to be used by
the instructor "in whatever way
seems best." The policy does not
allow professors to add class meet
ings to "catch up" on missed ma
terial, although many professors
use the week to make up lost time.

Stanford should follow the ex
ample of other universities, schools
of equal caliber, that have extended
study periods during which there
are no classes or assignments. Uni
versities such as Yale and Harvard
have one and two week "reading
periods" respectively, designed pri
marily for students to catch up on
readings and interrupted only by
review sections. Libraries have
longer hours, which are used ex
tensively by students.
Administrative officials here of
ten argue that the time constraint
imposed by the quarter system
warrants Stanford's current Dead
Week policy. Professors claim nine
weeks is not enough time to com
plete course material; a 10th week
of lectures and assignments is
needed.
However, professors have always
known that Stanford is on a quar
ter system, so their courses should
be tailored to fit the time period.
Professors should recognize that
they are falling behind and accom
modate well before Dead Week.
Other schools on the quarter sys
tem, such as Northwestern's Col
lege of Arts and Sciences, the
largest of Northwestern's six col
leges, follow a real Dead Week
policy.
Implementing a true Dead Week
would give students the needed free
time to synthesize nine weeks of
material into long-term knowledge,
rather than simply cramming the
information into short-term
memory during the weekend
before finals. Finals would test
knowledge more than test-taking
skills.
If the University is sincerely
committed to undergraduate edu
cation, it should only allow optional
study sessions for the benefit of
students during the week before
finals. The University should put
the "Dead" back into Dead Week.
