## Return of the F grade... 
### 
OUR WAYS OF LIFE are being
threatened. And by none other
than the very people who are sup
posed to be enriching them — the Stan
ford faculty. It seems that they now want
the ability to flunk someone in their class;
they want to be able to give 'em the ole
one, two for being lazy and not at all
productive.
And who can claim that this funda
mental change in academia at Stanford
will not in some way affect the way they
approach courses in the future, either
positively or negatively? Not I.
Think about it. No longer will we be
able to simply doodle on the final exam,
knowing full well that we'll just get
dropped from the class. No way. The
University Committee on Academic Ap
praisal and Achievement is gonna give us
all a rude awakening, right back into the
real world with places like Harvard and
Yale and UC-Berkeley where the students
aren't a bunch of pampered babies like
they are here.
But enough of my dallying on this hot
topic. Knowing other people have impor
tant points to make, I decided to explore
their opinions. Here is what some of them
were:
"Taking away the no credit rule is an
insult, an attack on the integrity of the
student, and a clear violation of the Honor
Code which the students hold dear to
their academic hearts."
— Pete, the third-year sophomore
"I say 'good,' is what I say. Look here,
if all those flunkies stay on the curve,
that means I get a better grade. See?"
— Chet, the "fiddler"

"We 11... I guess that means a easier
curve and all."
— Howard, the echo-er
"We need to get back to the days of
honest work for honest grades. It was
the damned liberal '60s that ruined us."
— Betty, the historian
"You're asking me ?"
— The Amazing Weasel Boy
"I'm gonna study and get straight As
this quarter. I'll go to the library four
nights a week. So it won't affect me. Not
at all."
— Frat-guy Steve
"A good start. But I shall not be fully
placated until this institution does away
with all the relativistic, wishy-washy,
diluted CIV tracts and reinstates close
study of the masters — and I'm not
talking about Freud and all that corrup
tive, closed-minded lot, either."
— Allan Bloom, Jr.
"But I can still drop classes up to 24
hours before the final, can't I?"
— Pristina, the sorority pledge
"I might say that I would rip my fin
gernails out and plunge my hands into
a vat of boiling oil if they ever brought
back the F grade."
— Drunk Ed
"It seems pretty trivial to me."
— Joe
"Besides, dumbheads don't deserve to
get off Scot-free."
— Chet, again
"Give them a break. At least they try
hard, sometimes. I'm sure they can't help
it if they have one or two bad classes.
Be eleemosynary."
— The Jordan Scholar

"It just means that now students will
have to do a little paperwork if they don't
want to complete a class."
— Sally
There we have it. As is apparent from
these candid quotes, even among the stu
dents, the issue is nowhere near resolved.
Although the relative pros and cons are
still being fiercely debated, the outcome
will not be resolved until the end of the
year, when the committee has completed
its investigation.
I just have one complaint about the
whole affair. If this committee is propos-f
ing to reinstate the F grade, I believe
they are not taking enough steps. I think
they should also have the courage to limit
our ability to drop courses whenever we
want (maybe by only allowing four weeks
at the beginning of the quarter to drop
a class). Otherwise, this gesture they're
now making seems pretty empty.
But whatever the case, I would like to
see the committee make up its mind,
completely. Either the system stays the
way it is, or we get strict and impose
the above-mentioned limitations.
Anything would be better than the in
consistency that we seem to be headed
for now.
