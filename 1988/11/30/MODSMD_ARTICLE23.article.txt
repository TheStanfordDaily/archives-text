Media ignored vote
counts for third
party candidates
I WOULD LIKE to call your atten
tion to the election results you
published on Nov. 15. The Daily,
like most of the national media, didn't
bother to list the returns of any third
party candidates. You also calculated
the percentages so that the two major
parties seemed to capture 100 percent
of the vote.
By perpetuating the myth that the
United States is purely a two-party
government, you are doing your
readers a great disservice. You are
telling them that all ballots cast on
campus were for either Bush or Duka
kis, which is untrue.
In an election year where few were
happy with these two candidates for
president, you reinforce the belief that
there are no alternatives. By voting for
the lesser of two evils, people give the
Democrats and the Republicans no
reason to search for satisfactory
nominees: better to have a bland,
inoffensive candidate than one who will
actually take a stand.
This has been a difficult year to get
election returns for third parties. The
National Election Service, which was
set up to coordinate the tabulation of
votes for the national media, decided
to not include third party votes and to
tally the Democratic and Republican
votes as equalling 100 percent.
As a result, while my friends knew
of their candidates' votes almost as
they were cast, I am still waiting for a
good estimate of how many people
voted for Ron Paul. The Daily, how
ever, was not dependent on NES
counts. While write-in ballots are still
being counted, the Santa Clara County
Registrar of Voters will give you all
the current vote counts for president.
When I called, they told me that of

5,417 votes cast on campus, 46 (.85
percent) were for Ron Paul and 20 (.37
percent) were for Lenora Fulani. While
they would not give me other races
over the phone, I know that Liber
tarians in these races won between 2
and 3 percent.
I and 65 other Stanford residents did
not vote for either Bush or Dukakis,
please don't tell Stanford that we did.

publication did not
research CIV facts
A recent article in the conservative
Stanford Review about the new CIV
requirement contains so many errors,
misrepresentations and outright distor
tions that I feel compelled to clarify
certain basic facts for the benefit of
the Stanford community.
Despite the allegations of the au
thors, Mike Iwan and Norm Book,
there is not "a transitional Cultures,
Ideas and Values track."
There are eight: Great Works, His
tory, Humanities, Literature and the
Arts, Philosophy, SLE, VTSS and a
new track, Europe and the Americas,
which follows the precedent of an ear
lier, highly successful Comparative
Literature track in taking a thematic
rather than a chronological approach.
Without bothering to confront the
syllabi of these courses, all of which
are readily available, authors Iwan and
Book have fabricated the notion that
"CIV . . . has jettisoned many of the
great books written by Western think
ers."
This is patently and demonstrably
false. The most cursory examination of
the fall quarter syllabi confirms the
"survival" of the Bible, Homer, Hesiod,
Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Plato,
Aristotle, assorted Latin and early

Christian thinkers, and new voices
from the Americas.
True, there are also some new texts
— the "Epic of Gilgamesh," the
"Analects" of Confucius, the Koran —
but none but the Stanford Review and
its faculty patron Prof. Robert Cohn
could seriously describe them as the
work of "minor authors chosen for
left-wing political reasons."
It is impossible to respond to various
abusive and uninformed arguments
advanced by the authors of the Review
article, none of which rises above the
level of innuendo, association and
name-calling, and all of which are
based upon a truly stupendous ignor
ance of the contents of the courses
they presume to judge.
I have long been worried about the
politics of Stanford's neo-conservatives;
now I am worried about their reading
skills.

University actions
speak louder than
University words
I would like to respond to the Nov.
23 Daily letter submitted by Norman
Robinson, Alice Supton, Jean Kim,
Diana Conklin, Rodger Whitney and
Elizabeth Hiyama entitled "Members of
this community should respect each
other."
The questions that the letter raised
are very valid and ones that we must
try to answer, as a community as well
as individuals. Furthermore, the posi
tion taken by the authors of the letter
towards racism is very commendable:
.. without qualification that re
gardless of motivation or the presence
or absence of intention to do harm,
actions that have the effect of degrad
ing or demeaning others because of
their race, religion, sex, sexual orienta-

tion, national origin or disability are
intolerable."
However, I feel that this is just inef
fective rhetoric. The judgment made by
the Judicial Affairs office about last
year's "Otero incident" on Oct. 17,
1988, had in fact demonstrated to the
Stanford community that the absence
in intention to do harm is indeed
tolerable.
The seven individuals involved in the
May 24, 1988 candlelight vigil outside
Otero were acquitted of charges of
violating the Fundamental Standard.
A reason used for the decision was
the absence of intent in doing harm
not only to Otero residents, but also
members of the gay and lesbian, black
and other minority communities.
Quite loudly, action speaks much
louder than words. Perhaps, the
decision-makers of the University must
also undergo some introspection and
demand the same standards from the
Judicial Affairs office that they right
fully demand of members of the Stan
ford community.
