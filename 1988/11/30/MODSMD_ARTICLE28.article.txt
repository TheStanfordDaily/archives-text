## The
						Stanford Flying Club reaches Stanford's loftiest heights Flying high from the Foothills to the Bay — with a twist 
### Susan McKean Editorial staff 
The pin wheels of the roof fans on the cogeneration
plant slip by. At my imposing altitude I suddenly
invade the privacy of someone sunbathing on the
roof of Alpha Sig. There's my room with the window
open. I glimpse the warm-up plays of the football
team in the stadium before the crowds arrive. The
Oval proves actually to be an asymmetrical ellipse.
Stanford's paved, tree-speckled and red-roofed ex
panse gives way to the pool-dotted foothills. We
climb through a noticeable layer of smog, into the
hazy clouds and then above them. The misty cliffs
of Monterey beckcn in the distance as we fly over
the suede hillsides toward the sea.
The Bay Area's birdlife is as lucky to live here
as the ground inhabitants. That is, if a bird can
appreciate the view from the skies as much as
anyone would who has ever flown with the Stanford
Flying Club.
Since its founding in 1936, the Flying Club has
offered the thrills of aviation to the Stanford com
munity. With an unscarred safety record, the non
profit organization provides the sky-bound initiates
of Stanford with instruction, equipment and exper
tise.
The club, independent of the University except
for some minimal funding from the ASSU, includes
90 percent students and 10 percent faculty, staff
and alumni. Members pay moderate annual dues
for use of the 15 planes now owned or leased by
the club.
In addition, the club offers flying lessons for all
levels — from beginners to highly advanced pilots.
Only nine to 18 hours of flight time is required to
obtain a solo pilot license, and a pilot can bring
passengers along after completing the 40 hours
needed for a private pilot license.
Although flying lessons do not count for academic
credit, they do offer students a "practical" and
"thrilling" skill, according to Bert Postma, acting
director of the club. Students can start any time of
the year and arrange their own schedule.
Along with primary flight training, the club
teaches more difficult and professional types of
flying as well, including acrobatic, instrument and
transport flying.
The club operates from offices across from the
single-runway Palo Alto airfield off Highway 101.

Even the most well-traveled students might not
know that the Palo Alto airfield is one of the coun
try's busiest airports, at least in terms of traffic
per runway.
Yet, learning with the Stanford Flying Club at
the Palo Alto airport is "learning in the big time.
After training here, you can handle anything," ac
cording to Bill Lange, the club's chief pilot and
foremost expert in all forms of aviation.
Waiting on the runway, we hear two pilots ahead
of us speaking French over the radio. At 12:05 p.m.
we tune into the nighttime Paris weather forecast.
Foreign visitors often fly out of the field, Lange
said, noting the high percentage of international

student Flying Club members. Flight instruction is
not only taught in English, but is available in
Spanish, Dutch, French, German, Norwegian and
Swedish as well.
Lange pointed out that obtaining a license in
other countries costs much more and involves more
extensive requirements, thus making the Stanford
Flying Club even more attractive to foreign students
interested in learning how to fly.
This day, Paris is cloudy. Visibility was reported
at 90 miles in sunny Tahoe, only an hour's flight
away. For us, the haze tucks itself into the wrinkles
of the coastal hills below us.
I take the steering wheel, and experiment. Pulling

the handles - not actually a wheel - towards me,
the nose rises. The shadow of our four-seater Cessna
dances over the meadow and pines as we level off
at 1,500 feet. In less than a minute, our visibility
increased from four miles to 100 miles.
Later, within a cloud bank, our pilot Lange treats
us to a tame sampling of the expert acrobatic flying
that is also a trademark of the club.
A brief climb and a gentle banked curve deceivingly
begin the topsy-turvy maneuver. Suddenly, the
feeling of a headrush from standing up too fast is
magnified 100 times, the plane is inverted and all
orientation to up and down, land and sky, is lost.
We twist upside-down and turn as though whisking
the clouds. And then suddenly we are righted. Back
to normal.
The acrobatic, instrument and airline transport
training offered by the Flying Club is "unusual"
for a small club and some of the best available in
the country, according to Lange. "People . . . from
all over," recognize the program, he said, partly
due to the combination of the club's impeccable
safety record and its tradition of fearlessly pushing
the limits.
"We go out in the heaviest clouds; we go out in
the bad weather. We go looking for it,"in order to
fully train the pilots, Lange said.
And still, in the history of the group, no member
has ever been injured flying under club instruction
or using club equipment.
Consequently, the club's insurance rates are low,
some of the lowest in the area, according to Postma.
We continue buzzing high above the Stanford
area on our way back to the airfield near the
Baylands mudflats. We leave behind the hills strung
with dental floss-like telephone lines. I need only
to turn my head once to take in all of SLAC's three
miles.
Our perspective transforms the golf course into
a cell, with sand pits as vacuoles and putting greens
as mitochondria. The bold Grateful Dead symbol on
the Alpha Delt driveway reaches out to our wings.
We pass over a small desert of the Rodin sculpture
garden. And a wave of six soccer players passes a
ball down the field by deGuerre pool.
Soon the splotchy marshlands grow close as we
descend. Some fine tuning of the complex controls,
some cryptic airspeak over the radio — and we
land. No bumps.
Don't miss the view, or the thrill.
