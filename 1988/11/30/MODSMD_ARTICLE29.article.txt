Combat improv
Today at 8 p.m. in the Christine Ricker Dining
and Performance Center (Crudpuck) you can
catch a Bay Area Theatre Sports competition
for a mere two bucks.
Theatre Sports is comedy improvisation with
a twist: contestants are divided into teams, and
these teams perform against one another under
the close scrutiny of professional Theatre Sports
judges.
The two teams take turns executing chal
lenges which are hurled from the other teams
or the audience members. Theatre Sports teams
can be required to perform such improv im
possibilities as "N-Word Sequences" (each
sentence in the scene must be a specific num
ber of words long); or "Scene in Reverse"
(audience supplies last line; scene must play
backward to humorous origin). And so forth.
Beyond the specific requirements of any chal
lenge, players must also avoid "wimping" (not
committing to developing the scene's story
line), "waffling" (not choosing a direction for
the scene to follow), "blocking" (rejecting an
idea from a teammate) and gagging (interrupt
ing or killing the story line just to get a laugh).
And. don't forget The Bag — a paper bag
contestants are required to don while sitting
out a scene if they resort to racist, sexist or
crude references.
The judges score points in each match, and
the winners go on to face each other in the
finals. Part of the fun is booing the judges —
this is encouraged, believe it or not — when
your favorite team gets low scores. And the
judges are even permitted to declare a scene
over if it gets too stupid or unfunny.
