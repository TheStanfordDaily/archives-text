## Return of the geriatric pod people 
### Alex Kostich 
Chances are if you enjoyed the
original "Cocoon," you'll like the sequel
just as much.
"Cocoon: The Return," produced by
Stanford graduate Richard Zanuck (BA,
sociology, 1956), aims at being a "holiday
family film." As the title suggests, this
sequel to the 1985 hit brings the senior
citizens (who left for outer space in the
end of the original) back to earth to
rescue the four remaining cocoons.
The interesting twist is that the
"rejuvenated oldsters" who opted for im
mortal life in outer space begin to age
when they return to their home planet.
Although the original film focused on
the cocoon creatures, the sequel dwells
almost entirely on the elderly people's
dilemma: Should they stay on earth and
follow a natural course of life, or should
they return to the Fountain of Youth
in Space, and outlive their grand
children?
The question is answered in a very
satisfying manner, although it takes
about 20 minutes too long. The prin
cipal actors: Don Ameche, Hume
Cronyn and Jessica Tandy, give inspired
performances as the aged but energetic
earthlings. Unfortunately, the talents of
Maureen Stapleton and Steve Gutten
berg are neglected due to small roles.
The film gets tiresome in the creature
episodes — one of the cocoons is dis
covered by Men in White Lab Coats,
and naturally they want to use the alien
inside for government operations.
Courtney Cox (Michael J. Fox's
girlfriend on "Family Ties") plays a
Woman in a White Lab Coat who sym
pathizes with the alien captive after she

sees it do card tricks (?!).
These fantasy elements do not mix
well with the more serious questions
the film poses about mortality. The
editors have cut the film so that it has
no rhythm — there are short scenes,
drawn-out scenes, action scenes, fantasy
scenes and romantic interludes all glued
together in random fashion. The movie
lacks a constant pace.
As a "holiday family film," (a label
to which many movies attach them

selves these days), "Cocoon: The
Return" is slightly off-center. Elderly
people will be entertained and amused
by the antics of the older cast, and
children will eat up the special effects
show. But middle-aged people and young
adults (i.e. the parents or older siblings
who take children to the movies) won't
have too much to identify with and will
find the movie a bit aimless.
Ideally, this is a film grandma and
grandpa can take the kids to.
