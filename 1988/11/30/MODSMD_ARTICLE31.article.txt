"Fresh Horses" is "Fatal Attraction"
with all the "Fatal" taken out.
Andrew McCarthy plays an already
engaged college boy who falls in love
with Jewel (Molly Ringwald), a 16-year
old "fresh horse." He calls off his en
gagement and begins pursuing the
uninhibited youngster.
And that's it for plot, folks — not
much happens after these first 15
minutes.
To make matters worse, the dialogue
(by award-winning playwright Larry
Ketron) is pitifully pseudo-sexy. In one
scene, McCarthy asks Ringwald how she
can go through a deck of cards without
looking and tell what each one is. "By
heat," she whispers, licking her lips.
(Editor's note: Oh barf!) That's it —
the scene ends right there. These sup

posedly steamy moments end up being
just ridiculous.
It has been said that Molly Ringwald
is hoping for an Oscar nomination in
this role. What category? Best hairdo?
She stomps around angrily in most
scenes, displaying her internationally fa
mous pout. This one expression is the
deepest emotion that "Fresh Horses"
conveys.
The print ads for this film (which is
based on an off-off-Broadway play) show
McCarthy smoking on a bed, while
Ringwald lurks in the foreground. Don't
be fooled by the sexual suggestions of
the photo; the hottest — and only —
love scene in the movie is a brief kiss
between the two leading brat-packers.
This teen drama tries too hard to be
romantic — and it gets nowhere with
its overly-suggestive dialogue.
"Fresh Horses" should have been
titled "Cold Turkeys."
