# The 						ASSU NEWS presents...
## 'ASSU'RING YOUR NEEDS 
### 
Our philosophy as Council of Presidents (COP) is that we believe student government should involve as many student as possible in the decision-making process as
well as in the actual planning of projects and working on issues. We also believe that the ASSU should work to meet the needs and concerns of students by either
initiating new services or working for institutional change, whichever is appropriate. The projects we have developed and the issues we have taken up so far this
year reflect our commitment to making student government an institution that is dedicated to serving students.

ASSU Course Consultants
Every year students complain about the undergraduate advising
system—most of the complaints are that faculty advisors and AA's
are not able to provide adequate advice on a variety of courses and
professors outside of their major field. Working with the
Undergraduate Advising Center (UAC), we were able to find out
which courses and professors they cannot afford to miss and which
they would be better off avoiding. So during the first week of
Autumn quarter, our Course Consultants sat out in White Plaza
during lunch hours and gave personal advice on Autumn quarter
courses that they had already taken or knew about. This quarter we
not only want to make students more aware of the program, we also
want to get more people involved as Consultants, so students can
benefit from a broad and diverse "panel of experts."
We will hold Consulting hours in White Plaza—on the grass
between Old Union and the Bookstore—from 11:30 am-l:15 pm for
three (3) days of Winter quarter:
• Monday, January 9th: Engineering, Math and Computer
Science majors
• Tuesday, January 10: Humanities and Social Science majors
• Wednesday, Januarv 11: Natural Science majors

Beat the Bookstore
We all know how outrageous prices are at the Bookstore for
just about everything. Right? Well, we are tired of students
having to pay so much for school supplies and so this quarter
we offered inexpensive school supplies and telephones at
non-profit to save students money. When our COP slate ran
last year, we went door to door to see what students' needs
were. When the idea of a bookstore competition came up, most
students seemed really excited about the idea. In fact, when we
announced our projects to freshmen at The Fire Within, Beat the
Bookstore received a spontaneous outburst of applause. The
project achieved some unexpected accomplishments. After only
four days of sales the Bookstore placed all of the items that we
were selling "on sale" at close to or lower than our prices. We
were happy to save money for students who bought supplies
from the Bookstore during their sale.
The first week of Winter Quarter we are going to be selling
inexpensive school supplies in White Plaza during the noon
hour. We will have the most popular items in stock—binder
paper, quad ruled paper; notebooks, folders, highlighters, pens
and pencils — so that students can buy them right away.

Used Book Faire
Since the Bookstore also rips students off when
it come to Used Books—buying them back for
nearly nothing and then selling them for almost
lull price—we have plans to hold a non-profit
Used Book Faire the beginning of next quarter. We
will buy your books for more and sell them for less
than the Bookstore does. At the end of this
quarter, we will be buying books back for large
lecture courses that are repeated each quarter, i.e.
Calculus, Hum-Bio 1, Psych 1, Physics, Econ 1,
and Chem. We will make announcements in those
classes within the next week to tell you when and
where we will buy your books. Next quarter we
will sell back those books as well as offer students
the chance to sell their other books in our Book
Faire. If you have a book not included in the above
list that you'd like to sell, just drop it off in the
morning of our Book Faire and return in the
afternoon to see if it's been sold. You've got
nothing to lose and only money to gain...

ASSU Dorm Representatives
We started the Dorm Rep program so that we could better represent and serve students by finding out what students think on the issues and projects we're working on
and also to suggest what things wc should take up in the future. Through the Dorm Reps wc can also inform students about our upcoming projects and activities, hold
educational programs and discussions in their dorm, and get students involved in planning new student services and working for institutional change.
The program has been very successful so far as we have over 75 Dorm Reps in the major dorm complexes—Branner, Flo Mo, Lagunita, Stern, Toyon, and Wilbur for this
first quarter. We're now looking to expand the program to the Row and Governor's Corner next quarter.

Educational Issues:
Fighting Against the Funding Cutbacks for TA's
We are now developing plans to campaign against the budget cuts that
have reduced the funding for TA's in the School of Humanities and
Sciences. An overwhelming majority of students are opposed to cutbacks,
becuase of the effect that less money for TA's will have on graduate
students' financial situations and the quality of teaching for
undergraduates. Studies have shown that there is a direct correlation
between small class sizes and better grades, and we feel this is a issue of
extreme importance in providing a quality education for all students. We
have already met with Ewart Thomas, the Dean of Humanities and
Sciences, and have set-up meetings with concerned faculty and graduate
students in different departments. Several students are working with us on
this issue through our new ASSU Committee on Democracy in Education
which meets on Monday nights at 6:30 pm at the ASSU.
Bringing Back the 'F'?!
Several faculty are now in the process of trying to get the Faculty Senate
to overturn a 1969 decision (which students fought for) to have all F grades
be counted as no credit and not show up on students' transcripts. Almost
all the students we have talked to are opposed to this idea since "bringing
back the F" will not enhance our educational experience by making us more
disciplined students, but rather discourage student from taking more
challenging courses. Since the 'F' grade issue is still in the committee stage,
we will monitor its progress and make sure the student voice is heard. If the
issue comes to the Faculty Senate next year, we will organize students to
fight against it.
Increased Swimming Pool
Working with concerned students and senators, we were able to set-up a
very successful meeting with Athletics Director, Andy Geiger, in which he
agreed to open DeGuerre Pool for more hours on weekdays. The pool now is
open at 10 am instead of 12 noon and the evening hours are extended to
8:30. We look forward to working with students on other issues like this,
for better student life.

Financial Aid Advocates:
As sure as the sun comes up in the morning, Stanford students' financial aid packages go down after their
frosh year. Regardless of whatever reasonable arguments the Financial Aid Office (FAO) gives us, the reality of
the situation is that some students are forced to stop out or go through tremendous hardship to make up the
difference. Students that have to deal with this problem have become more experienced in how to get the mone'
that they deserve from Financial Aids. We hired a few of these experienced students to help other students as
they venture into the the FAO for the first time.
We received alot of calls asking for general information, because the FAO's phone was usually busy and some
students felt more comfortable calling us. In addition, several students wanted advice on how to go about
getting the money they deserved from the Financial Aid Office. In both cases, we found that the program was
very helpful to students. For next fall, we will be looking to improve the program and to help the FAO better
serve students.

Voter Registration JDrtve
Because of our commitment to a more democratic education and society, we felt it important to sponsor a
non-partisan voter registration drive during this fall's compaign to help empower groups that have traditionally
been underrepresented in the political process. Thus our goal was to register as many students as possible and
also to help out with community-initiated drives in East Palo Alto and Rewood City. We coordinated our efforts
with the Stanford Volunteer Network (SVN) of the Public Service Center, which enabled us to get so much done
in short time span.
Over twenty students, mostly frosh, helped us register over 800 students and 300 residents of East Palo Alto
and Redwood City—all this in only two and one-half weeks!! We coordinated an extensive dorm-based
registration drive, and also registered students at our White Plaza tabling hours, before the Cardinal home
football game, and at a noon time "Voter Registration Festival" where the band O'Mighty Isis encouraged over
50 people to register in just one hour! In the community, we spent two Sundays registering voters with
community groups as they continued their efforts to empower Blacks and Chicanos.

If you are interested in working on or taking part in any of these services or issues pi east
call the COP at 725-ASSU.
People's Platform in the ASSU...dedicated to serving you!!
