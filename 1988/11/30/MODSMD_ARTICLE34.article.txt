## Card hoopsters send FSU to the doghouse 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
While coaches love to talk
about character-building wins,
Stanford women's basketball
Coach Tara VanDerveer and her
team got a little more character
than they wanted last night in
Fresno.
Women's Basketball
Cardinal 62, Bulldogs 58
The No. 6 Cardinal eked out
a 62-58 win over Fresno State
last night in a game that, while
a blowout on paper, ended up
much too close on the hardwood.
The Cardinal is now 2-0 going
into this weekend's tournament
at Northwestern. The Bulldogs,
picked sixth in the Big West Con
ference in a preseason coaches
poll, look like a darkhorse this
season as they are currently 3-1.
The Cardinal trailed 34-31 at
the half but rallied behind 14
second-half points by junior
guard Jennifer Azzi. Azzi
finished with 22 points on 7-of
-11 shooting (including 3-of-5
from 3-point land). Junior for
ward Katy Steding added 20 and
had game-highs in rebounds
(11), steals (two) and blocks
(three).

Fresno State was led by 6-foot
-6 center Simone Srubek with 18
points, 11 boards and two blocks.
"We were pleased with the
overall effort in the game against
Stanford," Bulldogs Coach Bob
Spencer said. "I think that even
though we lost this game it will
help us in the two or three games
we have coming up."
Spencer's knowledge and prep
aration (he is tied with Texas'
Jody Conradt as the nation's
winningest active coach with 503
wins) coupled with the home
court advantage (the Bulldogs
are 63-14 (.818) over the past
six seasons) almost gave the Car
dinal a rude awaking from what
is expected to be a dream season.
Stanford came back strong in
the second stanza to take a 35-34
lead but the Bulldogs tenaciously
fought for a 46-40 advantage
with 12:13 remaining.
The Cardinal showed why it
is ranked sixth nationally, how
ever, going ahead 47-46 after
holding Fresno State scoreless
for more than five minutes. The
teams exchanged leads until Azzi
hit a turn-around jumper to put
Stanford ahead for good at 54-
52.
Sophomore guard Sor\ja Hen
ning, who led the team with eight
assists, then went coast-to-coast
for a layin to make it 56-52 with
2:22 left.

After Srubek hit two free
throws, it was senior Evon As
foris' turn to save the day. With
the 30-second clock about to ex
pire, Henning threw up a des
peration shot that just hit the
backboard. But Asforis pulled
down the rebound and layed it
in to make it 58-54.

Yvette Roberts then hit a jumper
to cut the lead to two, but
Steding hit a jumper of her own
to make the cushion four again.
Freshman Kelsey Kline coun
tered to make it 60-58 but Azzi
calmly hit two free throws with
12 seconds left to seal the win.
The Cardinal was unable to
get its run-and-gun game out on
the floor and was intimidated in
side by Srubek, but kept itself
in the game by holding Roberts
to a mere eight points, ending a
33-game double-figure scoring
streak for the woman who will
likely graduate this year as the
all-time leading scorer at FSU.
And it's a safe bet VanDerveer
will take all the character
building she has to as long as a
"W" comes along with it.
Card notes
The Cardinal shot an anemic 35
percent in the first half, 40 percent
in the second half. By comparison
Stanford shot 53 percent in a win over
Wisconsin Friday.
