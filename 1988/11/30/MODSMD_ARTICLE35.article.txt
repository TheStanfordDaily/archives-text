# Hayes is a backcourt machine for the Cardinal
## 
### T.C. Hall 
lt is a normal game for the
Stanford women's volleyball team
and this means they are winning.
For all the many points that the
team racks up, the pattern re
mains fairly consistent: The ball
TTmit'H screaming across the net
and makes it's way into the back
court where it is met by Amy
Hayes. The team's lone senior
makes the dig and passes the ball
up to the setter who sets up what
turns out to be the point winning
spike. This is normal. This is how
Stanford wins.
"In the serve-receive game of
woman's volleyball, the primary
passer is key," says coach Don
Shaw. "Without a good primary
passer, you can't play and win."
Amy Hayes is Stanford's pri
mary passer (and is a big reason
that the team is doing so well this
season), but do not worry if this
information does not register.
Most people who are not volleyball
gurus do not remember how a
play develops, only how it ends.
The big spikes look the best and
get the attention. Passing is just
the means to a spiking end.
The problem here of course is
that Hayes is the means, not the
end. This helps her get lost in the
publicity shuffle. It is the nature
of the role, however, and Hayes
cannot do much about it.
As Don Shaw says himself,
Hayes will never look "spectacu
lar" because it goes against the
way she operates within the team.
Hayes' job is for the rest of the
team to look good. Says Shaw,
"When Amy has a good game, the
team has good game."

This sort of individual spot
lighting probably would not sit
well with Hayes. As much as she
holds the team together defensive
ly, making the big digs that turn
into spikes, she does not see her
self as a role player. She likes to
think that she is like anyone else
on the team, playing hard and
doing her job. In her eyes, the job
she has to do is play the whole
game, not just defense.
As she says herself, "I don't
feel like I've played a complete
game unless everything has been
there — serving, defense and play
at the net."
The serve is Hayes' best offen
sive weapon. Coach Shaw admits
that it is the kind of serve he
does not try to control; he just
lets her use it as she will. The
result is often a Cardinal point.
Hayes leads the team in aces this
year with 31.
Though she performs well in
the backcourt, both with her serv
ing and digging/passing abilities,
Hayes runs into trouble when the
rotation brings her up to the net.
Even though she is a talented all
around player, Hayes does not
possess the hitting skills of some
of her teammates, and at times
gets taken out when she reaches
the net. The net is a place that
Hayes knows she has trouble
with, and this drives her to per
form that much better in the
backcourt.
"I probably put more pressure
on myself (while on defense) to
make up for my height and play
at the net," she says.
This self-applied pressure gets
results, but again Hayes does not
think she is doing anything spe

rial. "Sure I go hard (for digs),"
she says, "but so does everybody
else." This kind of sentiment is
ever present with Hayes: When
ever she says something about
herself the next breath is used to
say something about the team.
This strong sense of team impor
tance is shown further when she
talks about what she will take
away from her volleyball experi
ences here on the Farm.

It will not be the number of
wins and losses, she says, but the
friendships.
"The friendships I've made
from the team," she says, "are
amazing."
The way that the Cardinal plays
and wins probably makes being
friends a lot easier. Stanford heads
into the homestretch of the season
with the NCAA Championship on
it's mind and the way their de

fense plays will dictate how close
to that goal they get.
Knute Rockne once said that
"The best defense is a good of
fense." For the Cardinal the exact
opposite is true: The best offense
is a good defense. Amy Hayes is
a key to that defense. She will
make the digs that evolve into
spikes and points. This is how
Stanford woman's volleyball
plays, and this is how they win.
