# Spikers '88: Bridesmaids no longer??
## 
### 
Last year an era came to an
end at Stanford. A trio of
seniors — three of the finest
athletes in any sport ever to wear
the Cardinal — hoped to go out
in style by winning an NCAA
women's volleyball championship.

Unfortunately, Nancy Reno,
Wendi Rush and Teresa Smith
came up short last year. The
Pacific 10 Conference champs
marched all the way to the NCAA
finals in Indianapolis, Ind.
Then they ran into Division I's
No.l buzz saw Teee Williams of
Hawaii. The Rainbow Wahines
were simply too tough and the
Cardinal was once again the
bridesmaid.
They had come close before, too.
As sophomores, Reno, Rush and
Smith were joined by a supporting
cast that included Olympian,
NCAA Player of the Year and all
world star Kim Oden. Even that
was not enough, though.
Stanford marched into the Final
Four as the top-ranked team in
the nation. After knocking off
UCLA in the semis, the team
faced Pacific, led by Kim's sister
Elaina — a freshman at the time.
The younger Oden led the
Tigers to an upset win, and an
NCAA title.
Two years ago, it was a some
what different scenario. Stanford
was not really expected to chal
lenge for the title. Nonetheless,
the squad stunned No. 1 BYU in
Utah in the regional finals.
They couldn't follow up the win
at the Final Four though. In the
semifinals, Nebraska put an end
to the Cardinal's title hopes.
In six straight years, Stanford
made six appearances in the hal
lowed Final Four. Three times the
team finished second, twice third
and once fourth. Never in the his
tory of the program could the
team take the last step and be
crowned NCAA champions.
Many felt that with Reno,
Rush and Smith graduat
ing, last year had to be
the year. It would be a couple of
seasons, they reckoned, before the
Cardinal could challenge again for
a national title.
How wrong they were.
Coach Don Shaw came up big
in recruiting last spring inking
five players to national letters of
intent.
Among those recruits were out
side hitter Kristin Klein of Pacific
Palisades, Calif., and middle
blocker Amy Cooper of Aurora, 111.
The two would impress before
the regular season was done. They
merely went on to win All-Pac-10
honors.
That's not to say they were the
only two quality players on this
year's squad. Junior Lara Asper
finally got to step out of Rush's
shadow and take over at setter.
Given the opportunity to shine,
Asper established herself as one

of the better quarterbacks in the
nation. Asper finished second in
the conference in assists.
Junior Jennifer Chaffee, who
saw time on the front row last
year, came into her own as well.
The 6-foot-2 hitter from Colorado
Springs, Colo, became a powerful
outside force this season.
Chaffee invoked fear in oppo
nents hearts and became the only
two-time recipient of The Daily's
Athlete of the Week award.
And, one mustn't forget the
team's lone senior — Amy Hayes.
One of the top clutch players in
the country, Hayes will be playing
her final match in Maples Pavilion
Thursday night when Stanford
meets USC in the first round of
the NCAA tournament.
Interestingly, it is also probably
the last women's volleyball match
ever to be played in Maples. With
Old Pavilion currently being re
turned to its original raison d'etre
— to serve as a sports facility —
the team is slated to play there
next season.
Given Old Pavilion's smaller
size, there should finally be a
home court advantage for small
but raucous crowds will nearly
fill the building to capacity.
But I digress. . . .
Klein and Cooper meshed
well with the team's re
turning players and the
Cardinal had one of the best sea
sons in its history this year.
