In a disappointing finish to their fall
season, four members of the Stanford sail
ing team travelled all the way to Chicago
over Thanksgiving only to collide with a
number of frustrations that left them in
eleventh place at the prestigious Timme
Angsten Regatta.
Hosted by the Chicago Yacht Club, the
annual event draws the best sailors in the
nation together for three days of intense
racing on cold Lake Michigan. For the sec
ond year in a row, California was the top
scoring West Coast team at the regatta, as
the sailors from Berkeley scored an im
pressive top-five finish.
Throughout the regatta, Stanford's two
two-person teams had trouble getting up
to speed. Senior Bill Shoemaker and soph
omore Paula Gani sailed the Cardinal boat
in A-Division, while sophomore Scott Dale
and freshman Cathy Petzold competed for
Stanford in B-Division.
One of the problems the Cardinal squad
faced was getting used to the unusual boats
in which the races were held. The event is
sailed in Dyer Flyer class sailboats, which
have only one sail and are under ten feet
long. The Stanford team normally sails in
bigger boats with two sails, and were un
able to match the speed of competitors
more practiced in the cat-boats.

off the water, where both pairs were dis
qualified from a race for violating the right
of-way rules. Each disqualification carried
with it a heavy penalty in extra points.
Most basically, however, the Stanford
sailors were disappointed with their own
performance at the event.
"It didn't go well," Shoemaker said,
"we're a top team, and we should have
been sailing better than we did."
According to Stanford Coach Blake Mid
dleton, the regatta was frustrating, but it
was not without its bright side.
"Though we didn't sail very well, the
team learned some important lessons. I
think Cathy will improve a lot now that
she's met some talented skippers and had
a chance to discuss tactics with them,"
Middleton said.
For the four who went to Chicago and
the rest of the sailing team, the next two
months will be spent in hibernation,
waiting for the winds of late winter and
early spring. The competitive season
resumes midway through February, when
the Northern California championship se
ries begins.


The Stanford sailing team found rough waters over Thanksgiving weekend, finishing In 11th place at the Tlmme
Angsten Memorial Regatta In Chicago.
