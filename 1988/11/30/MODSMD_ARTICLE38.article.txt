# Columbia football coach resigns; accused of professional misconduct

### 
NEW YORK (AP) - Larry
McElreavy resigned as Columbia
football coach Tuesday, a week
after one of his assistants accused
him of professional misconduct.
McElreavy denied the charges
and the university said it believed
his denials, but McElreavy felt he
could not continue amidst the con
troversy.
Doug Jackson, Columbia's of
fensive coordinator, had accused
McElreavy of drinking before
games, missing team meetings,
and said McElreavy was "reeking
of alcohol" during Columbia's
game against Dartmouth on Nov.
5.
But two doctors who treated the

coach denied the allegations and
said McElreavy suffered a stress
attack complicated by high blood
pressure
"The charges are completely
untrue," McElreavy said Tuesday.
"But I cannot subject those I love
and admire to further public
abuse. I have therefore decided to
step down as head football coach,
even though the university gave
me a vote of confidence."
It was yet another blow for Co
lumbia, the university with the
worst record among Division I
teams over the last 25 years.
The Lions lost the first 23
games McElreavy coached and set
a record among meyor colleges

with a 44-game losing streak that
ended with a 16-13 victory over
Princeton on Oct. 8. The Lions
were 2-10 this season, their best
record since 1978.
McElreavy, who led Columbia
2-28 record, said he would be paid
through the remainder of his con
tract, which expires after the 1990
season. Columbia's new coach will
be its fourth in six seasons.
McElreavy said he informed the
school of his decision on Monday,
but the announcement was
delayed a day until he could meet
with the team.
"He had made up his mind,"
said A 1 Paul, Columbia's athletic
director. "You don't talk someone

out of it when he makes up his
mind."
McElreavy said he decided to
quit on Sunday night when he
and his familty watched a televi
sion news account of Jackson's
charges.
"The one thing I have never
done since I've been in coaching,
which is a mistake, is put my
family first," he said Tuesday in
his office, his voice cracking with
emotion.
"It didn't take long to see the
look in my wife's face, mv
daughter's, that my family is first.
Something clicked right there."
McElreavy, 42, said that during
the two-hour meeting with his

team he "bared his soul."
"I've gone through so much
that I don't think I would feel an
emotion it I stepped over it,"he
said.
McElreavy said he probably
should have addressed the allega
tions before Jackson went public
with them last week.
"That might not have been a
bad idea, but like I said,
hindsight's always great," he said.
McElreavy came to Columbia
after three seasons as head coach
at New Haven and three seasons
as an assistant at Pennsylvania,
where Jackson also was an assis
tant. After McElreavy was named
head coach at Columbia, he hired

Jackson from Pcnn as an assis
tant.
McElreavy said he has not
spoken with Jackson since the
charges were made. Jackson, the
1975 Ivy League Player of the
Year while a running back at Co
lumbia, did not show up for work
on Monday or Tuesday.
McElreavy replaced Jim Gar
rett following the 1985 season
after Garrett called his players
"drug-addicted losers'.'
In addition to on-field contro
versy, in 1986 and 1987 Columbia
asked and received permission
from the Ivy League to admit 11
players who fell below conference
standards for football recruits.
