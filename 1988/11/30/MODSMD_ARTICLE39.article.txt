# The 						Cardinal had one of the best seasons in its history.
## 
### 
Losing only twice — both times
to No. 1-ranked UCLA — Stan
ford won 27 games, including a
school-record 20-match win streak
between the two Bruins' matches.
The Cardinal knocked off arch
rival Hawaii in a thrilling five
setter at the Josten's Invitational
Oct. 8. A month later to the day,
Stanford stopped nemesis Pacific
in another heart-stopping five
game match.
If all goes according to plan,
Stanford should meet UCLA in
the regional finals Dec. 10 at
Pauley Pavilion.
The Cardinal, having fallen to
the Bruins in both meetings this
season, will be underdogs. UCLA,
riding on the crest of an unbe
lievable 31-0 record, will be ex
pected by the pundits to knock
off Stanford and go all the way.
UCLA is led by Pac-10 Player
of the Year Daiva Tomkus, All-
Pac-10 setter Ann Boyer and All-
Pac-10 freshman sensation Elaine
Youngs. Naturally, they'll be
tough to beat.
But as the old sports cliche goes:
On any given day . . .
If Stanford should upset UCLA,
they'd head for Minneapolis,
Minn, with yet another shot at a
national championship. Maybe
this time they'll come out on top.
