# Faculty: Stanford is intellectual
## 
### Elaine Riggs Staff writer 
University professors and administra
tors agreed with last year's seniors in
rejecting the notion that Stanford lacks
an intellectual atmosphere.
The 1987-88 seniors were asked the
following question in their senior sur
vey: "Some have criticized Stanford as
lacking an intellectual atmosphere. Do
you think that this is a valid criticism?"
Sixty-three percent of the respondents
replied "no."
Asst. Dean of Residential Education
Alice Supton said she does see intellec
tual activity here, but added that there
is room for a lot more.
"1 don't know how many students feel
comfortable talking with other students

about what's important to them in
terms of ideas, and for me, that's what
characterizes an intellectual environ
ment," Supton said.
Asked if she saw ongoing intellectual
discussion in students' dorm dining
rooms, Supton said, "I think it happens
and it could happen more."
English Prof. Ron Rebholz said he is
concerned about students' reluctance to
volunteer intellectual ideas at the dinner
table.
"Students don't want to admit ignor
ance about anything. (But) one of the
conditions for leading the intellectual
life is being able to admit ignorance,"
Rebholz said.
Rebholz said many students feel "in
timidated" at the dinner table.
This means that students live out

most of their intellectual lives privately,
according to Rebholz.
"I heard about those 1 a.m. discus-

sions, and I suspect
that is happening in
small groups," Rebholz
said.
Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons said
some students think
"that if one is to be in
tellectual that one is
therefore grim, serious
and troubled."

The atmosphere at Stanford tends to
be more easy-going than that at many
other highly rated schools, according to
Lyons.

"There's a substantially differ
ent feel to life on the Stanford
campus (as compared) to life on
Eastern campuses," Lyons said.
The warmer weather here and
relatively spacious campus allows
students to feel freer to live "a
more balanced life" than their
counterparts back East, according
to Lyons.
"Certainly there's less grimness
here," Lyons said.
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody, who has taught here since
1962, says he has seen shifts in
Stanford's degree of intellec
tualism.
During the '60s, Brody said,
students showed an increasing

preoccupation with intellectual
ideas.
The '70s saw many students
moving in much more career
oriented paths, according to
Brody.
Now, Brody cites evidence
showing Stanford's alleged trend
back toward a more intellectual
environment.
"Students are much more likely
to attend class," Brody said.
"In the past, it wouldn't be un
usual for a third or more of the
students to miss lecture. Now, al
most all the time — even the day
before holidays — most students
are in lecture," Brody said..
Students are also much more
attentive in class than previous
generations, according to Brody.
Rebholz offered an explanation
for the perceived lack of intellec
tualism here.

Rebholz said the University's
"stupid academic calendar" —
that is, the quarter system —
hampers intellectual life here.
"Intellectual life requires a
measure of leisure in which stu
dents can read, reflect and inte
grate their thoughts — and the
quarter system does not create
the atmosphere for that leisure,"
Rebholz said.
Criticism of the University's in
tellectual atmosphere from the
outside is not difficult to find.
Edward Fiske, a popular New
York Times education columnist,
wrote in the 1989 edition of "The
Fiske Guide to Colleges:"
"For all of its success, Stanford
is still looking for that elusive
quality — call it 'intellectual at
mosphere' — that has been the
hallmark of great universities."
