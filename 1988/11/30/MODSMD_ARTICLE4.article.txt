# Faculty: Stanford is intellectual
## 
### Elaine Riggs Staff writer 
University professors and administra
tors agreed with last year's seniors in
rejecting the notion that Stanford lacks
an intellectual atmosphere.
The 1987-88 seniors were asked the
following question in their senior sur
vey: "Some have criticized Stanford as
lacking an intellectual atmosphere. Do
you think that this is a valid criticism?"
Sixty-three percent of the respondents
replied "no."
Asst. Dean of Residential Education
Alice Supton said she does see intellec
tual activity here, but added that there
is room for a lot more.
"1 don't know how many students feel
comfortable talking with other students

about what's important to them in
terms of ideas, and for me, that's what
characterizes an intellectual environ
ment," Supton said.
Asked if she saw ongoing intellectual
discussion in students' dorm dining
rooms, Supton said, "I think it happens
and it could happen more."
English Prof. Ron Rebholz said he is
concerned about students' reluctance to
volunteer intellectual ideas at the dinner
table.
"Students don't want to admit ignor
ance about anything. (But) one of the
conditions for leading the intellectual
life is being able to admit ignorance,"
Rebholz said.
Rebholz said many students feel "in
timidated" at the dinner table.
This means that students live out

most of their intellectual lives privately,
according to Rebholz.
"I heard about those 1 a.m. discus-

sions, and I suspect
that is happening in
small groups," Rebholz
said.
Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons said
some students think
"that if one is to be in
tellectual that one is
therefore grim, serious
and troubled."

The atmosphere at Stanford tends to
be more easy-going than that at many
other highly rated schools, according to
Lyons.
