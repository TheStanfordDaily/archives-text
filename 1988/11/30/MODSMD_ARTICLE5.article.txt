# Fellow expert not surprised Drell resigned
## 
### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
A former senior researcher at Stanford's Center
for International Security and Arms Control yes
terday affirmed Prof. Sidney Drell's contention that
the quality of research at CIS AC will suffer unless
the University gives the center the capacity to ap
point professors.
Coit Blacker, a political science professor at USC
and an arms control expert who worked at CISAC
under Drell for 11 years, said he has known that
Drell would resign since October. Blacker left the
center last spring.
Drell's "strategy over the last three years has
been to try to work quietly on the inside" to obtain
professorial appointments for fellows at CISAC,
Blacker said. "Apparently he just became so angry
that he decided to go public" with his protest.
Drell resigned on Nov. 23 from his post as co
director of CISAC, effective Aug. 31, because the
University refused to grant the center the power to
appoint professors. Drell will continue to work at
CISAC and at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter, where he is the deputy director.
An editorial in yesterday's Los Angeles Times
stated, "Drell says that the trouble started about
two years ago when he tried to get a full profes
sorship for one of his best lecturers and found that
it could not be done."
It is not clear which of Drell's colleagues are
planning to follow his departure in 1989.
A front-page story in yesterday's San Jose Mer
cury News included speculation that former
astronaut Sally Ride and noted physicist and en
gineer Theodore Postol might also resign.
Blacker emphasized the two reasons why he left
were "that there was no prospect of my professorial
appointment becoming regularized, [and] the job
that was offered to me at USC was very, very
attractive."
But his choice would have been very difficult to
make if Stanford's policy had allowed CISAC to
offer him professorship, he said.
Echoing many of Drell's recent comments, Blacker
said, "If Stanford wants to maintain places such as
the arms control center ... the University needs to
come up with some other mechanism to make profes
sorial appointments" outside existing departments.
Blacker suggested that SLAC could be a model
for giving interdisciplinary groups such as CISAC
the ability to grant professorships.
While SLAC is not a University department, it
appoints faculty through normal procedures.
In a telephone interview last night, Drell agreed
with Blacker.
Drell admitted that the appointments problem
was very difficult and complex, but he questioned
why the power "which obviously serves SLAC very
well" could not be given to CISAC.
