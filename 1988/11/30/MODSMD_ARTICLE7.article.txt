# Condom sales are sluggish
## Campus dispensers draw light response, but will stay 
### Lara Filson 
The 82 condom machines installed in
campus residences this September have
yielded minimal sales, said Suzanne
Tamiesie, manager of Student Housing
Operations.
According to figures released yester
day by Tamiesie, only 432 condoms have
been sold through the dispensers be
tween Sept. 14 and Oct. 21.
Last January, Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Norm Robinson proposed that
the University install the machines as
a way to educate students about prac
ticing safe sex.
Robinson said he was unsure whether
the condoms, which cost 50 cents, wore
too expensive and if the high price dis
couraged student purchasers.
It is hard to determine whether the
432 condoms sold at 50 cents apiece is
"a lot," Robinson said. "We installed the
machines thinking they would be used
only in last-minute situations."
The machines were proposed not to
make money but to "make a loud and
direct message" to students, Tamiesie
said. "We wanted the students to be
aware of practicing safe sex."
Despite the slow sales, Tamiesie said
there are no plans for removing the

machines.
Saying that the condoms sold in the
dispensers are too expensive, Bart
Bartlett, co-director of the Contraceptive
Information Center at the Cowell Stu
dent Health Center, explained that male
students do not want to fork out 50
cents for a condom.
"If a student is sexually active, he
won't want to spend 50 cents when he
could be getting them for 10 cents at a
store," said Bartlett, a senior.
The contraceptive center gives away
condoms for free, Bartlett said. "We've
given away around 1,600 this quarter."
Nevertheless, Bartlett said, "I think
the machines are successfully marketing
safe sex to a greater extent across
campus."
Senior David Cline, a resident assis
tant in Faisan House, agreed that the
machines are a good thing.
"The machines make the students
aware of the dangers of having unpro
tected sex," he said.
A growing number of college campuses
around the country are installing con
dom machines, according to Sam
Dlugatch, executive vice-president of
sales at National Sanitary Laboratories.
