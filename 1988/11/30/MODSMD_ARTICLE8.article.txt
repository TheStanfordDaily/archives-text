# Report on minority life at Stanford delayed until January
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
The long-awaited report of the Univer
sity Committee on Minority Issues will be
submitted to University President Donald
Kennedy by the beginning of next quarter,
according to Assoc. History Prof. Albert
Camarillo, the committee chair.
Camarillo said the report will contain
specific policy recommendations and will
have a significant impact on University
minority policies.
The effect of the report will be "far
reaching" because it will influence how
other universities around the country view
minority issues, he said.
A year and a half ago, Kennedy and
Provost James Rosse formed UCMI in re

sponse to pressure by student groups to
improve minority life on campus. The com
mittee was charged with submitting

recommendations to the
president and provost by
Oct. 1.
However, due to delays
in gathering data, the com
mittee knew early last
spring that it would not
make the October deadline,
Camarillo said. He then
told Kennedy and Rosse
that the report would be
completed by late this fall

Joseph Thomas, a student member of
UCMI, said the committee took extra time
to evaluate the compiled data. He said the
process of making a statistical evaluation

of the data took longer than was expected.
The committee was concerned with doing
a "thorough job," he said.
The committee is divided into five work
ing groups, each responsible for examining
different minority issues. The issues the
working groups are studying include: cur
riculum, student recruitment, admissions
and retention, faculty and staff recruit
ment, hiring and promotion and student
affairs.
UCMI staff member Cecilia Burciaga said
part of the reason for the delay was the
unexpectedly long wait in receiving data
from privately contracted consulting firms.
All the data have now been received,
according to Burciaga.
Burciaga said committee members are
"writing fast and furiously" in order to

submit the report by the deadline.
"It's like finals time," she said, "We all
wish we had a Dead Week."
Thomas said that in addition to writing
the report, the committee is also taking
time to meet with the people whom the
recommendations will afTect "in order to
get their input."
Camarillo said the committee is going
"full steam ahead" in its efforts to finish
the report by the extended January dead
line.
The committee is in the process of col
lecting the findings from all the working
groups to make its final report, according
to Camarillo.
Student committee member Brian Kim
said, "The problem of minority issues on
campus is not easily dealt with."
