Stanford students and faculty will
have more recreational facilities avail
able to them beginning next fall, thanks
to the renovation of Old Pavilion that
began early last month.
The renovation is the first step in
the construction of the Ford Center for
Sports and Recreation. This center will
be the first indoor athletic facility
built on campus since Maples Pavilion
opened in 1969, according to Senior As
soc. Athletic Director Alan Cummings.
The Ford Center will consist of the
renovated Old Pavilion and an addition
holding a basketball and volleyball prac
tice court and a gymnastics facility.
"It's unbelievably exciting," said Ath
letic Director Andy Geiger. "This will

have a major impact on intramurals
and recreational opportunities on
campus. It's something we've been
working on for a long time."
The Ford Center will cost $9 million,
all of which will come from gifts. The
center will be named for the principal
donors, Tom Ford, who is a University
trustee, and his wife, Joan.
Work began Nov. 11 on Old Pavilion,
located on Serra Street across from En
cina Hall.
The renovated building will be used
for general recreation and physical ed
ucation classes. The men's and women's
volleyball teams will also practice and
compete there, Cummings said.
Greg Asbury, athletic facilities direc
tor, said the project began in reponse
to an athletic facilities master plan
drawn up in 1987. Officials in the Ath

letic Department were concerned with
relieving the overbooked Maples Pavil
ion and providing more indoor recrea
tional space for students and faculty.
The master plan calls for two new
athletic complexes to be developed on
campus over the next decade.
The first is the East Athletic Quad,
consisting of the Ford Center, Encina
Gym and existing tennis courts in the
area.
The second project, the West Athletic
Quad, will be built across from Gover
nor's Corner and will eventually replace
Roble Gym.
The Old Pavilion renovation is the
first step toward fulfilling the master
plan.
"We've long been concerned about the
lack of recreational facilities for the size
of the campus," Cummings said.
