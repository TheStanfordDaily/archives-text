In a business he described
as "sleazoid," sports and media
agent Leigh Steinberg told an
audience in the Law School yes
terday that he tried to "use
law as a craft to make a dif
ference."
Steinberg is an extremely
successful agent who represents
50 National Football League
players including Waren Moon
and 11 other quarterbacks, 20
League Baseball players
including San Francisco Giant
Will Clark and local media
celebrities like Anna Chavez, a
news anchor for an ABC-TV
affiliate.
He emphasized to the audi
ence of over 50 people, mostly
law students, that he only rep
resents athletes willing to
"utilize that profile and try to
make an impact and a differ
ence."
Steinberg explained that he
challenges each athlete to find
a charitable cause he or she is
interested in helping. As exam
ples, Steinberg mentioned
former San Diego Charger Rolf
Benirschke's "Kicks for Crit
ters" program that donated
money to the preservation of
endangered species for each

field goal he kicked and Will
Clark's donation of money to
the United Way for each home
run he hits.
In addition, 32 of Steinberg's
clients have returned to their
high schools and established
scholarship programs.
At the start of his anecdotal
speech, Steinberg described
how he broke into the business
of representing athletes. While
he was attending Boalt Law
School at UC-Berkeley, he was
a counselor in the undergrad
ute dormitory that housed foot
ball players.
After Steve Bartkowski, one
of the undergraduates Stein
berg advised, was selected first
in the NFL draft, he asked
Steinberg to represent him.
With Steinberg's help, Bart
kowski signed the largest
rookie contract up to that point
in NFL history.
When Bartkowski and Stein
berg arrived in Atlanta where
the young quarterback would
spend his career, the adolation
and attention of fans made both
realize "gee Toto, we're not in
Northern California anymore."
According to Steinberg, it
was at that point that he
realized the real potential ath
letes had to impact communi
ties.
