# Rabbi discusses black Jews in United States
## 
### Diane Bisgeier Staff writer 
"Black Jews remain one of the
best kept secrets in American
life," according to Rabbi David
Joel Brooks, who estimates there
to be about 100,000 black Jews
currently living in the United
States.
Brooks shared his knowledge of
black Jews and the connections
between the black and Jewish
communities with about 20 people
in Ujamaa lounge Tuesday night.
Brooks began to notice the
inter-relationship between blacks
and Jews in the United States
when, after majoring in black
studies and race relations, he went
South to work for the Congress
on Racial Equality, a civil rights
group, in the early 19605.
There, Brooks noted "a high
percentage of the whites in the
Southern civil rights movement
were Jewish."
But the relationship between
blacks and Jews extends beyond
the purely political.
"Many of the black Jews in the
United States believe that the
original Jews in the Bible were
all black," said Brooks, who him
self believes that many of the Old
Testament figures were dark
skinned. "I'm not really hung up
on what color they were," he said,
stating that Judaism is a color
blind religion.
Brooks further linked the

Jewish Old Testament to blacks,
saying, "There seems to be a nat
ural affinity on the part of blacks
for the Old Testament. In black
culture, you'll notice an emphasis
on Old Testament themes in songs
and spirituals."
Brooks added that evidence
exists that Moses led both African
and Hebrew slaves out of Egypt
and had an African wife as well.
Describing black Jews, Brooks
outlined four groups: Falashan
Jews, African Jews who come pri
marily from Ethiopia; descendants
of ex-slaves of Jewish slaveowners
who converted to their ex
masters' religion; descendants of
West Indian blacks who inter
married with Jews who had fled
there from the Spanish Inquisi
tion in the 15th century; and
nationalistic blacks in the 1930s
who converted to Judaism because
they associated it with ancient
Africa.
The first group, which traces
its origins to the biblical figures
Solomon and Sheba, received
world attention three years ago
when, in response to famine and
political strife in Ethiopia, the Is
raeli government airlifted more
than 15,000 of them out of Africa.
The last group converted
largely under the influence of Ar
nold Ford, himself a descendant
of the West Indian Jewish tradi
tion, who claimed that blacks are
really the descendants of the prop
hets and ancient kings of Israel.

After accompanying nationalist
Marcus Garvey to Africa, Ford ap
pointed Winthrop Matthew, for
merly a Protestant bishop, to take
his place as the dean of the black
Jewish community in the United
States.
Matthew established a rabbini
cal academy where most of the
current black rabbis have been
trained. According to Brooks, only

two blacks have attended Yeshiva
University in New York, one of
the most prominent seminaries
for mainstream American Ju
daism.
Brooks said that, unlike most
other congregations, those started
by black Jews are in primarily
lower socioeconomic areas and
remain scattered "largely in
ghetto areas."
