MEXICO CITY (AP) - Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, a Mexican
nationalist with U.S. academic
training, becomes Mexico's presi
dent today and begins a race
against time to restructure his
country economically, politically
and psychologically.
Six years of economic crisis and
austerity have fed discontent and
political opposition. Salinas him
self has said that the "future of
the system" — a system that has
served Mexico for almost 60 years
— is at stake.
With Cabinet appointments an

nounced yesterday, however,
Salinas served notice that he in
tends to extend free-market poli
cies. Several young appointees
worked with Salinas under out
going President Miguel de la
Madrid and, like Salinas, hold
degrees in economics from top
ranked U.S. schools.
When he takes the oath in the
legislative palace for his six-year
term, Salinas will look out at an
example of how times have
changed. Out of 500 congressmen,
263 belong to his Institutional
Revolutionary Party and an un

precedented 237 to the opposition.
Salinas' victory July 6 with just
over 50 percent of the vote was
marred by accusations of fraud,
and the result still is being
protested. Over the weekend
members of the National Demo
cratic Front occupied city halls in
Michoacan state.
Despite all his difficulties, there
are signs that Salinas may have
an easier time than de la Madrid,
whose biggest accomplishment
was to stop an economic
downslide and prevent social un
rest.
