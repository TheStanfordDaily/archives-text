NAACP supports black Santa
CARSON, Calif. (AP) — Fifty people furious
over the firing of a black Santa Claus picketed
the Carson Mall yesterday, threatening a boycott
by the black community unless the shopping cen
ter's general manager is replaced.
"We will call for a boycott on tomorrow if the
demand isn't met," said Ruth Anderson of the
Los Angeles Chapter of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People.
It was a racial remark by a mall official on
Friday and the firing of Rodney Newton that led
to the protest.
"There is no such thing as a black Santa Claus,"
the employee told Newton, according to Ander
son. The employee was subsequently suspended
pending an investigation, but the NAACP also
wants her boss removed.
"We want him suspended or terminated and
the general manager replaced with someone more
sensitive to the black community," Anderson said.
Pickets carrying signs reading "Is Christmas

for whites only?" and "Is there such thing as a
black Santa?" will march at the mall until the
owners respond.
Mall owner Mark McGaughey said race had
nothing to do with Newton's firing, noting a
second black Santa was quickly hired. Newton
was fired because he was too big for a box used
in a holiday program stunt, he said.
USS Nimitz accident claims life
MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) — A jet fighter's gun
fired by mistake yesterday, setting six planes
ablaze on the USS Nimitz flight deck and killing
a sailor, but crews averted disaster by dousing
the flames quickly, U.S. officials said.
A second crewman was severely burned in the
fire, which was brought under control in about
20 minutes, Navy spokesmen reported. They said
a cannon on an A-7 Corsair was fired accidentally
during "troubleshooting maintenance" aboard the
carrier in the Arabian Sea.
