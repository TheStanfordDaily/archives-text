## White House takes stand on secret Iran-Contra evidence 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
White House has told the chief
Iran-Contra prosecutor that it op
poses releasing certain classified
information during Oliver
North's trial because of national
security concerns, a senior Reagan
administration official said yes
terday.
The official, who spoke on
grounds he not be identified, said
that this, in effect, was President
Reagan's response to U.S. District
Judge Gerhard Gesell's recent
challenge to spell out his position
on secrets that might be disclosed
if the case goes to trial, possibly
in late January.
"Now, it's up to the judge to
decide what to do next," said the
source.
The official would not disclose
the volume of information the
White House was seeking to block,
or what steps the administration
might take. He said the White
House position was stated to in
dependent counsel Lawrence
Walsh "earlier this week."
The decision to try to withhold

an unspecified number of docu
ments, the official said, was based
on "national security grounds" â€”
and was not an attempt to help
North scuttle his prosecution.
Asked on Nov. 21 whether he
was moving toward a decision to
pardon his former National Secu
rity Council aide, Reagan replied,
"No, and I don't think it would
be any time to make such a de
cision while it's still before the
courts."
The White House position was
made known as Gesell began
closed hearings on some of the
classified documents in the case.
Gesell conducted the secret
hearing to consider the former
presidential aide's objections to
deleting sensitive references from
350 classified documents that
Walsh wants to use as evidence.
North objects to virtually all of
the proposed deletions, arguing
the references to countries,
foreign officials and U.S. intelli
gence agents are necessary to
defend charges that he conspired
to divert more than $14 million

in U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to
the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
Gesell must decide whether the
material is relevant to North's de
fense.
Walsh, who attended yester
day's hearing with several associ
ate prosecutors, contends that the
former National Security Council
aide is merely trying to scuttle
the case by forcing disclosure of
some of the nation's best-kept in
telligence secrets.
With North and his attorneys
present, Gesell took the bench
after court security officers used
electronic countersurveillance
equipment to make sure there
were no bugging devices in the
courtroom.
A day after Gesell upheld vir
tually all the charges against
North, the judge shifted his focus
to the difficult issues posed by
thousands of pages of classified
documents in the case.
While objecting to the deletions,
North also wants permission to
disclose 40,000 pages of classified
material during the trial.
