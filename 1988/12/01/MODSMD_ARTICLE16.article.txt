# Shuttle set for secret mission

### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Technicians
used glue for a quick fix on Atlantis' nose yesterday
and prepared to load the space shuttle with fuel
for a launch today on a top-secret military mission.
An approaching storm loomed as the only obstacle
to liftoff.
The glue was a last-minute substitute for two
bolts on an access panel that could not be tightened.
Replacing them would have meant a delay.
After deciding the glue would hold, NASA rolled
back the service tower which has surrounded the
shuttle, clearing the way for filling the huge external
fuel tank with a half-million gallons of liquid oxygen
and liquid hydrogen.
"The bond is OK and we are proceeding on a
decision for tanking," said Barbara Selby, a NASA
headquarters spokeswoman.
The start of fueling, another of many milestones

leading to a launching, awaited a late-evening
weather assessment by shuttle managers. In similar
situations in the past, NASA has proceeded with
the tanking while hoping for a break in the weather.
The bolts were two of 10 that secure a 24-by-18
inch access cover on the right side of the shuttle's
nose. The access plate, which is covered by 14 of
the shuttle's heat protection tiles, is normally
removed before flight to fuel a tank for the steering
rockets the shuttle uses while in orbit.
The problem surfaced as workmen replaced the
cover.
"We have to have assurance that panel isn't going
to come off in flight," said Lisa Malone, a Kennedy
Space Center spokeswoman.
Weathermen, meanwhile, continued to predict that
there was an 80 percent chance the weather would
not permit Atlantis to be launched on Thursday.
