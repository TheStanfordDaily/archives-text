TEL AVIV, ISRAEL (AP) -
The ruling body of the left-leaning
Labor Party rejected yesterday a
bid by the party's leaders to talk
with the rival, right-wing Likud
bloc on forming a coalition gov
ernment.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Sha
mir, leader of the Likud, vowed
to create a narrow-based govern
ment this week.
He said in a statement: "I'm
sorry that we have lost an oppor
tunity to form a broad govern
ment as was the wish of the
majority of the people. Within the
next few days I will present to
the Knesset (parliament) a gov
ernment that will serve well the
people and the country."
Shamir now must try to con
struct a coalition Cabinet with the
far-right and ultra-Orthodox par
ties. The Labor revolt also raises
the possibility of changes in the
party leadership.
The 61-57 vote by Labor's ex
ecutive bureau came in defiance
of party leaders Shimon Peres,

the foreign minister, and Yitzhak
Rabin, the defense minister.
There was one abstention.
Peres and Rabin argued at the
closed-door meeting in favor of
entering into negotiations with
the Likud, a party spokeswoman
said.
At the Labor meeting, Rabin

said that "it is a serious mistake
not to enter negotiations," party
spokeswoman Michal Cohen said.
But many in the party spoke
against the proposal, saying Labor
would have to give up its prin
ciples to join in a government with
Likud such as the joint Cabinet
of the last four years.
