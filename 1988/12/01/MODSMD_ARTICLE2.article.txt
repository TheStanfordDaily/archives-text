# IBM gets $396 million in arbitration case

### Burke Smith Editorial staff 
A six-year-old copyright dispute
between International Business
Machines Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd.,
Japan's largest computer compa
ny, was settled Tuesday by two
private arbitrators who awarded
IBM $396 million.
Stanford Law Prof. Robert

Mnookin and
John Jones, an
independent com
puter specialist,
worked together
over the last 14
months to arbi
trate the dispute
under the auspi
ces of the Ameri
can Arbitration
Association.

According to Association Pres
ident Robert Coulson, the process
developed by the two men was
one of the most significant and
unusual in the history of arbitra
tion.
Both companies gave extensive
flexibility to the arbitrators and
agreed that their decisions would
be binding and need not reflect
the specific related laws of either
home country.
The sum of $396 million was
arrived at as a payment for
Fiyitsu's continued use of existing

programs that IBM claimed as in
tellectual property. With past pay
ment credits of $159 million, the
balance owed by Fujitsu to IBM
totals $237 million.
This year's payment to IBM will
boost the company's yearly prof'ts
substantially.
In addition, a framework was
established for future use by
Fujitsu of IBM programming
technology. The framework allows
Fujitsu to utilize specific
proprietary technology released
by IBM before June 25, 1997.
"Under this arrangement,
IBM's investment in its operating
software is protected," Mnookin
said, adding "IBM will be fairly
compensated for Fujitsu's past
and future use of IBM program
ming material and there will be
tight safeguards on all Fujitsu
access to new IBM programs."
Fujitsu will pay between $26
million and $51 million to IBM
in 1989, varying with the extent
of Fujitsu's use of IBM programs.
According to Jones, "Our deci
sions will allow Fujitsu to have a
reasonable opportunity to inde
pendently develop and maintain
IBM compatibility in the future
and to continue to compete in the
marketplace."
