UCMI's long-awaited
report warrants very
serious consideration

THE UNIVERSITY Commit
tee on Minority Issues is
definitely not rushing the re
lease of its long-awaited report on
the quality of minority life on
campus. We trust that that is good
news. The issue has long been a
source of tension at Stanford and
definitely needs a thorough exam
ination.
If the report deals definitively
and decisively with the critical is
sues pertaining to minority life,
then the report will be worth the
wait. When it was commissioned
in the Spring of 1987, the UCMI
was given two charges â€” one by
the students of color who held a
sit-in to demand the formation of
the committee, and one by the
president and provost who commis
sioned the creation of the com
mittee.
The University charge states,
"The University Committee on Mi
nority Issues shall assess the in
stitutional environment of people
of color at Stanford and shall col
laborate with legislative bodies and
executive officers to move the Uni
versity with wisdom, conviction
and speed further toward policies
and practices that implement the
University's commitment to a
genuinely pluralistic community."

The charge further says that the
Committee can "recommend ap
propriate action."
After nearly two years of work,
it is critical that UCMI produce a
report that is true and faithful to
that charge and make clear recom
mendations for action.
The report must specifically
cover five areas: curriculum, espe
cially ethnic studies, and Cultures,
Ideas and Values; student recruit
ment; admissions and retention;
faculty and staff recruitment,
hiring and promotion; and student
affairs.
Everyone has been patient and
understanding while the deadline
was pushed back twice from the
initial Oct. 1 deadline. So upon the
release of the report, there will be
no excuse for any delay in action.
Students of color risked the dra
matic action of a sit-in to demand
the report's creation. The Univer
sity has put its credibility on the
line in commissioning a body to
undertake a review of this scope
and significance.
And above all, the recent racist
incidents followed by heightened
tensions and confusion signify the
urgency of the UCMI report. The
community is waiting anxiously for
concrete measures that will im
prove the quality of life for every
body.
As we celebrate our Centennial,
Stanford can seize the national
mantle of leadership with an en
thusiastic and active response to
the report.
