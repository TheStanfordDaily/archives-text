## McCloskey doesn't understand Arab-Israeli history 
### 
WHO IS PETE McCLOSKEY
and why is the racism that he'
elicits allowed to sully the
front pages of Stanford's newspaper?
Pete McCloskey makes a mockery of
the United States' policy towards
Israel. He deliberately ignores the
reality that the Palestine Liberation
Organization is still a terrorist organi
zation, and most importantly he fails
to understand the history of Israel and
its Arab neighbors.
McCloskey charges that Israel is no
longer a reliable ally of the United
States. Does he not know that Israel is
the only democratic, and truly pro-
American country in the militarily
strategic Middle East?

McCloskey charges that Israel's
treatment of the Palestinians is one of
the two examples of institutionalized
racism in the world today, the other
being South Africa.
Does he not consider Israel's right to
protect its citizens from the terrors of
Palestinian youths, who reside within
10 miles of Israel's msgor cities? Or its
necessity to maintain secure borders
from proven hostile neighbors?
Furthermore, Israel's occupation of
the West Bank has been far from
destructive. During the 20 years of
occupation, Israel has constructed
universities, hospitals and schools
throughout the land.
How can Israel rationally be com-

pared to South Africa, perhaps the
world's premier racist state. Where
does the Iraqi massacre of the Kurds
fit on McCloskey's list? Or the Syrians
at Hamma? Or the Sudanese slaughter
of their black countrymen? Come on
Mr. McCloskey!
Israel is legitimately fearful of PLO
terrorist attacks (there certainly have
been many) and the declaration in
Algiers does nothing to alleviate those
fears. Surely, the PLO now recognizes
Israel's existence, but they do not
recognize Israel's right to exist, a very
subtle, but important, distinction.
They accept United Nations Resolu
tion 242, but only in the context of
other U.N. resolutions, including the

1975 infamous "Zionism is Racism,"
which impicitly denies Israel the right
to exist. Lastly, the PLO renounces
terrorism, but only outside of Israel
and the Occupied Territories; they
retain that right there.
The 1947 U.N. resolution on Pales
tine proposed a two-state solution. The
Israelis accepted that resolution. The
Arabs responded with a war intended
to throw the Jews into the sea.
The PLO statement comes 40 years
and five wars too late. Who are they
to now claim the moral high ground,
and who is Pete McCloskey to give it
to them?
