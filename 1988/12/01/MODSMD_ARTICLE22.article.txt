At Stanford, student of color organi
zations and other committed students,
faculty and staff, have been in the
forefront of an effort to help Stanford
recognize and overcome institutional
racism. Their vision of a more egalitar
ian and pluralistic community has
helped to change this University for
the better.
Racism infects the entire country
and Stanford is no exception. The
recent discovery of offensive flyers at
Ujamaa is merely a symptom of the
deeper problem of racism.
Much of this country was built on
the lands of American Indians and
Mexicans and from the labor of black
slaves and Chinese railroad workers,
among others. This historic exploita
tion has led to inequality in American
society for people of color, even today
At Stanford, we are trying to over
come this problem by working to

create a pluralistic university commu
nity.
Prior to 1968, there were but a
handful of students of color at Stan
ford. The assassination of Martin Lu
ther King Jr., touched off a movement
led by the Black Student Union to
bring greater numbers of students of
color to Stanford. This challenge to
Stanford's admissions policies resulted
in a conscious effort on the part of the
University to overcome the inequality
of access to education and opportunity.
Today Stanford boasts a minority
population of over 30 percent and
hopes to increase the percentages to
reflect more accurately the changing
demographics and future needs of this
country.
Once black, Chicano, Asian and
American Indian students were present
in greater numbers at Stanford, they
could come together in these organiza
tions to support each other and to
work toward changing University struc
tures, social climate and attitudes that
made them feel as outsiders not
deserving of a quality education.
The recent changes in the Area One

requirement, largely stimulated by stu
dent critiques, have begun the process
of making the Stanford curriculum and
research agenda more responsive to the
concerns of students of color and wom
en. Moreover, the new curriculum will
help us understand the various cul
tural traditions that shape the United
States and will lay the groundwork for
building a truly democratic society and
prepare the leaders of the future for
an increasingly interdependent world.
The BSU, MEChA, the Asian-
American Students' Association and the
Stanford American Indian Organization
and other key faculty, staff and stu
dents have helped bring about changes
that have enriched the entire Stanford
community.
This is a point often missed when
thinking about the role of these organ
izations. Why do some students in each
of these communities invest so much
time and energy in them? Sure â€” they
seek a better life for minority students.
But they are also doing this out of a
caring for their university; they want it
to be even better than it is.
Students of color and their organiza

tiona are often called upon at Stanford
to educate the University about condi
tions facing their communities and to
make suggestions for positive change.
But the burden is not theirs alone: I
encourage all students to participate in
this process.
The members of these four organiza
tions who work to improve the ethnic
cultural centers, theme houses and
University structures and programs,
and to fight against sexism and homo
phobia, have been educators for us all.
In representing and leading their
communities toward a better education,
the BSU, MEChA, AASA and SAIO
hpve shown that they are organizations
to be strengthened, valued and nur
tured. For it is the work they do, to
gether with their supporters, that
keeps Stanford moving forward so that
it can approach its next 100 years with
vision, a sense of purpose and a com
mitment to creating a strong multicul
tural environment.
