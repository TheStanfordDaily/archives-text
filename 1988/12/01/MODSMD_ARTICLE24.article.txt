## Protesting apartheid 
### 
SUNDAY NIGHT'S FLICK, "Cry
Freedom," marked the beginning of
South Africa Awareness Week,
which has since encompassed daily pro
grams aimed at raising a greater knowl
edge and consciousness of the real issues
facing South Africa today
We are all aware of the system of apart
heid in South Africa that segregates the
races and perpetuates the dominance of
the "superior" whites over the blacks,
but few of us have pursued a true study
of this system and its implications for
both South Africa and the rest of the
world. Most of us are disgusted and an
gered by apartheid, but this disgust and
anger seldom surfaces, except when we
listen to the news, read the headlines
and occasionally watch a film or attend
a lecture.
I am one of those people whose anger
arrives only on occasion, but I never seem
to harness that energy and channel it
back against apartheid. Instead, I let it
dissipate and find its way to my uncon
scious, where it sits and festers until I
read the next article or hear the next
story.
I am frustrated by my pattern of ap
athy and would like to become more ac
tive in the struggle to end apartheid, but
as soon as I begin to become involved,
the injustices I discover are so shocking
and disturbing that they overwhelm me.
I feel powerless against them, and it be
comes easy to retreat from any action
and to "file away" the problems of apart
heid as things beyond my control.
I tell myself it is better for me to focus
my attention and efforts on improving

racial harmony within my own country
or community, rather than expend my
energy to a nation 10,000 miles away
with a history, culture and people about
which I know very little.
But I can expend some extra energy
against apartheid without shirking my
responsibilities here: the two are not
mutually exclusive. I may not choose to
spend a majority of my time as an activist
in South African issues, but I can alter
my daily routine, taking these issues into
account.
If I support divestment from companies
involved in South Africa but don't want
to participate in sit-ins or rallies, I can
pay attention to which gasoline companies
are involved in South Africa and can
perhaps drive a bit further or pay a bit
more to avoid doing business with such
companies.
If I support economic sanctions against
South Africa but don't know how to pres
sure our government or big business, I
can make a conscious effort myself to
not purchase gold or diamonds mined in
South Africa.
I can more thoroughly read the news
papers and watch the news so that South
African issues don't escape to the uncon
scious of my mind. I can talk to my
friends and family over dinner about
these issues and use their opinions and
ideas to better formulate my own. I can
ask people who have either been to or
seriously studied South Africa what they
see as the best solutions and hope for
the future.
Constant discourse without action can
frustrate me, and I sometimes question

whether my increased self-awareness will
actually help children living in black
townships like Soweto. I realize that one
reason I have avoided facing issues in
South Africa is that I tun scared I can't
help. Apartheid sickens me, and when I
see movies like "Cry Freedom" I get a
knot in my stomach and a lump in my
throat. I leave the theater knowing some
thing needs to be done, but not knowing
what to do.
As a result, I have chosen to sit in my
safe world at Stanford and ignore what
is happening on the other side of the
globe, rather than try to fight it, but I
can do this no longer. The people of South
Africa cannot ignore apartheid, and nei
ther can we.
There are people actively committed to
the struggle to free South Africa, and I
commend them highly. They have an
enormous and emotional task ahead of
them.
I also thank them for bringing South
Africa Awareness Week to Stanford. It
has made me think a lot about South
African issues recently, causing me to
re-examine, re-evaluate and reconfirm
my committment to end apartheid.
AMANDLA!
