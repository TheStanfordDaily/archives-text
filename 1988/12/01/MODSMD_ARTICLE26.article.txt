## The face of new leadership in Namibia
### 
For many pan-africanists,
the pervading fear during the
American presidential campaign
was that the ongoing intensive negotia
tions for Namibian independence were a
mere electoral ploy, and that they would
fall apart after the Republicans had
achieved electoral victory in the Novem
ber presidential elections.
Consequently, almost a month after the
Bush victory, it should be to the credit
of all the sides at the negotiating table
— including the mediating American of
ficial team led by Assistant Secretary of
State Chester Crocker — that a tentative
agreement was recently reached for South
Africa to grant independence to Namibia
in early 1989, and for Cuban troop with
drawal from Angola to take place over a
27-month period.
From all indications, the accord
reached during five days of hectic nego
tiations in Geneva is still a delicate one
because it has yet to receive the final
approval of the Angolan, Cuban and
South African governments.
Historically, the complex nature of past
internal disputes in several other African
regions obviously points to the fact that
whatever agreement has been reached by
the Angolan, Cuban and South African
representatives can be rendered both un
easy and even useless to implement if

the interests and active involvement of
certain crucial regional forces are over
looked.
In Angola itself, any negotiator who
takes for granted the American-backed
rebel troops of the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola, led by
Dr. Jonas Savimbi, and thereby tramples
upon their expectations, is simply making
a huge joke of any expected peaceful
settlement in the entire southern African
area.
Then, in the case of Namibia, it is very
important for the negotiators to bear in
mind that — whether Western and South
African interests like it or not — the
leadership of the South West African
People's Organization, led by Sam
Nujoma, must be sufficiently consulted
in all aspects of the tentative agreement's
implementation process.
Above all, the leadership of the Organ
ization of African Unity should not be
grossly overlooked because after
Namibia's independence, its new leaders
would certainly wish to be considered for
membership in the continental organiza
tion, despite its seemingly impotent pres
ence in past delicate African issues.
To an extent, what the negotiators of
the Namibian independent settlement and
their proxies wish to achieve generally is
genuine peace for the southern African

region amid plans for the relinquishing
of South Africa's 73-year-old occupation
of Namibia.
Yet, if care is not taken, a partial agree
ment to the undue advantage of any of
the negotiating countries can turn the
military-cum-political scales in the nega
tive direction, a situation which can easily
throw the entire southern African basin
later into the ambit of confusion to make
it one of the world's worst conflagrations.
One can draw examples from past
African conflicts. Turmoil, created by po
litical opponents in various independent
African nations, has often led either to
eventual destabilizing processes in those
countries or to an outright overthrow of
uncompromising political leaders.
Consequently, it is hoped that the so
called rebel forces in Angola and Namibia
would respectively be considered crucial
and significant factors in any negotiated
settlement in the southern African region
if genuine peace is to be enjoyed.
Otherwise, any settlement reached with
half measures to the exclusion of all the
relevant forces within the area would
simply rest on the altar of perpetual
fragility and utter unreasonableness.
