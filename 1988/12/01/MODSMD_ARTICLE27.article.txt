Students should be
smart enough to
get lights on bikes
I don't want to be a killer, but I
nearly was one tonight in front of En
cina Hall.
Dammit, will you stupid people put
lights on your bikes?
You're bright enough to get into
Stanford, and naturally you think
you're immortal. But I came within
inches of smashing one of you to
death, and it wouldn't have been my
fault. Some comfort.
I'm probably one of the more ancient
bike-commuters at Stanford. Every day
that it hasn't been pouring rain for
the last 22 years, I've ridden my bike
to and from home, and all over the
campus. I've survived a couple of bad
falls. I've always had a working head
light at night.
A week or so ago The Daily carried
a letter and a column, both complain
ing about being stopped by police for
not having a light.
What the writers ignored, as do the
hundreds of you who ride at night
without lights, is this simple fact:
while you can see a car, the driver
cannot see you.
That's what happened to me at 7

p.m. tonight as I drove out of the En
cina Hall parking area onto Serra St.
A cyclist — headed home to his family
in Escondido village, probably — gave
me a glare as he swerved away from
the front of my car. I had looked both
ways, but he had no light and I never
saw him until my headlights illumi
nated him. Both of us were very lucky.
Please use common sense. Get a
light. Use it. No driver wants to be a
killer.
