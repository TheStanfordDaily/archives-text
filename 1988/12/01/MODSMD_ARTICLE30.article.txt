## South African freshmen give measure of Stanford education From townships to scholarships 
### J. Eric Jones Editorial staff 
Staring blankly at the Food Service
tray in front of him, Omphemetse Mooki
wonders aloud what makes him "more
than an isolated speck in a mess of fresh
men."
At times, he likes the security of being
lost in the crowd, free to sit back and
observe the world around him; at others,
he prefers the excitement of mixing into
that world, making new friends, rambling
through the countless parties, dinners
and speeches that freshman year has to
offer.
A typical freshman. Yet beyond the
Boston Red Sox T-shirt on his back and
the newly-wrinkled copy of "The Odys
sey" in his hand, there is something dis
tinctly atypical about Mooki — he is one
of the first black freshmen at Stanford
from the Republic of South Africa.
Although there have been a handful of
black South Africans to study as under
graduates at Stanford in the past, Mooki
and fellow countryman Owen Maubane
are the very first to matriculate as fresh
men.
Both have come to the United States
in pursuit of educational opportunity, a
chance at the higher quality education
that eludes much of the black and mixed
racial majority back home.
Studying at Stanford was little more
than a dream a few short years ago, yet
a dream that seemed real enough to lead
both Mooki and Maubane down the long
road from inspiration to application and
finally acceptance.
Owen Maubane: Realizing a dream
Maubane has lived much of his life in
the townships of Ga-Rankuwa and At
teridgeville, near Pretoria, although he
lived in Swaziland for several years as a
child.
His father's successes, as a self-made
business executive and chief executive of
ficer of the first black financial institu
tion in South Africa, enabled Maubane
to live what he says might be termed a
"relatively privileged" existence in com
parison with the m£\jority of blacks in
South Africa.
Yet Maubane took advantage of his en
vironment to break some ground of his
own. At the predominately white pre

marketplace ... That's
what I like about it.'

paratory school he attended in At
teridgeville, he was chosen as the first
black prefect and deputy of his house.
He also participated in an educational
outreach program, which sponsored ex
changes and organized special classes for
students from neighboring townships.
Maubane points to the inspiration of
his father and the emphasis his family
placed on education for his own desire
to excel in his studies. "It was always a
team effort ... a very good supportive
environment at home," he says. "Even
now, because of that background, I don't
feel stranded."
Although his family may have first
planted the seeds of inspiration in his
mind, the idea of studying in the United
States did not germinate until his older
sister was accepted to Principia College
in Illinois. After some discussion with a
counselor at his high school and a chance
meeting with a Harvard student research
ing an honors thesis on South Africa,
Maubane set his sights on finding a schol
arship which would enable him to attend
college in the United States.
Initially, Maubane had his heart set
on Harvard University when he filed his
applications. "I was really pumped up to
get into Harvard," he admits with an
embarrassed grin.
Yet Stanford, and in particular the Ad
missions Office, ultimately won over his
affections. "The style and the kind of
thinking at Stanford was all in the in
formation [included in the admissions
packet]," Maubane says. "That's where
Stanford was really outstanding."
Since he applied directly to Stanford
from his home in Atteridgeville, the bro
chures and admissions materials were his
only way of learning about the faraway
university he would eventually attend.
Maubane was particularly drawn to the
photographs and the descriptions of the
myriad possibilities for overseas studies
and a in international relations at

Stanford.
"The atmosphere was so incredibly
flexible .. . the academics . .. the weather
.. . San Francisco . .so many things,"
he says.
Now that he has finally come to Cal
ifornia and has submerged himself in the
rigorous schedule of a freshman year at
Stanford, Maubane is pleased with his
experience so far. "Here it's sort of like
a marketplace . . . competing for classes.
That's what I like about it."

And Maubane says his presence here
can do as much to teach others about
life in South Africa as it can to fulfill
his own educational goals. "I don't see
myself necessarily on a crusade to educate
Stanford students about the issues raging
in South Africa — these issues are of
great importance to me — my role here
is as a resource."
Maubane affirms that he does not want
his individuality to be lost in a typecast
image of his life as a black South African.

He adds with a pointed glance, "But I'm
a human being as well."
Omphemetse Mooki: A 'small droplet'
Mooki shares many of the same beliefs
about the limited educational opportuni
ties in South Africa, even though his
circuitous route to Stanford was dis
tinctly different from the one Maubane
travelled.
