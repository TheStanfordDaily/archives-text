## South African freshmen give measure of Stanford education From townships to scholarships 
### J. Eric Jones Editorial staff 
Staring blankly at the Food Service
tray in front of him, Omphemetse Mooki
wonders aloud what makes him "more
than an isolated speck in a mess of fresh
men."
At times, he likes the security of being
lost in the crowd, free to sit back and
observe the world around him; at others,
he prefers the excitement of mixing into
that world, making new friends, rambling
through the countless parties, dinners
and speeches that freshman year has to
offer.
A typical freshman. Yet beyond the
Boston Red Sox T-shirt on his back and
the newly-wrinkled copy of "The Odys
sey" in his hand, there is something dis
tinctly atypical about Mooki — he is one
of the first black freshmen at Stanford
from the Republic of South Africa.
Although there have been a handful of
black South Africans to study as under
graduates at Stanford in the past, Mooki
and fellow countryman Owen Maubane
are the very first to matriculate as fresh
men.
Both have come to the United States
in pursuit of educational opportunity, a
chance at the higher quality education
that eludes much of the black and mixed
racial majority back home.
Studying at Stanford was little more
than a dream a few short years ago, yet
a dream that seemed real enough to lead
both Mooki and Maubane down the long
road from inspiration to application and
finally acceptance.
Owen Maubane: Realizing a dream
Maubane has lived much of his life in
the townships of Ga-Rankuwa and At
teridgeville, near Pretoria, although he
lived in Swaziland for several years as a
child.
His father's successes, as a self-made
business executive and chief executive of
ficer of the first black financial institu
tion in South Africa, enabled Maubane
to live what he says might be termed a
"relatively privileged" existence in com
parison with the m£\jority of blacks in
South Africa.
Yet Maubane took advantage of his en
vironment to break some ground of his
own. At the predominately white pre

'Here it's sort of like a
marketplace ... That's
what I like about it.'

paratory school he attended in At
teridgeville, he was chosen as the first
black prefect and deputy of his house.
He also participated in an educational
outreach program, which sponsored ex
changes and organized special classes for
students from neighboring townships.
Maubane points to the inspiration of
his father and the emphasis his family
placed on education for his own desire
to excel in his studies. "It was always a
team effort ... a very good supportive
environment at home," he says. "Even
now, because of that background, I don't
feel stranded."
Although his family may have first
planted the seeds of inspiration in his
mind, the idea of studying in the United
States did not germinate until his older
sister was accepted to Principia College
in Illinois. After some discussion with a
counselor at his high school and a chance
meeting with a Harvard student research
ing an honors thesis on South Africa,
Maubane set his sights on finding a schol
arship which would enable him to attend
college in the United States.
Initially, Maubane had his heart set
on Harvard University when he filed his
applications. "I was really pumped up to
get into Harvard," he admits with an
embarrassed grin.
Yet Stanford, and in particular the Ad
missions Office, ultimately won over his
affections. "The style and the kind of
thinking at Stanford was all in the in
formation [included in the admissions
packet]," Maubane says. "That's where
Stanford was really outstanding."
Since he applied directly to Stanford
from his home in Atteridgeville, the bro
chures and admissions materials were his
only way of learning about the faraway
university he would eventually attend.
Maubane was particularly drawn to the
photographs and the descriptions of the
myriad possibilities for overseas studies
and a in international relations at

Stanford.
"The atmosphere was so incredibly
flexible .. . the academics . .. the weather
.. . San Francisco . .so many things,"
he says.
Now that he has finally come to Cal
ifornia and has submerged himself in the
rigorous schedule of a freshman year at
Stanford, Maubane is pleased with his
experience so far. "Here it's sort of like
a marketplace . . . competing for classes.
That's what I like about it."

And Maubane says his presence here
can do as much to teach others about
life in South Africa as it can to fulfill
his own educational goals. "I don't see
myself necessarily on a crusade to educate
Stanford students about the issues raging
in South Africa — these issues are of
great importance to me — my role here
is as a resource."
Maubane affirms that he does not want
his individuality to be lost in a typecast
image of his life as a black South African.

He adds with a pointed glance, "But I'm
a human being as well."
Omphemetse Mooki: A 'small droplet'
Mooki shares many of the same beliefs
about the limited educational opportuni
ties in South Africa, even though his
circuitous route to Stanford was dis
tinctly different from the one Maubane
travelled.

Owen Maubane, left, and Omphemetse Mooki are the first two black students from South Africa to attend Stanford as
freshmen.
"Mostly in a society like ours,
you feel like you have to go out
side somewhere to get a decent
education," Mooki says.
The long path to finding that
decent education overseas began
in the town of Mmabatho, the
capital of the black homeland of
Bophuthatswana, where Mooki
was born and where he lived dur
ing most of his 18 years. In
Mmabatho, he spent three years
at Kebalepile School, an all-black
high school whose "very low" ed
ucational standards, Mooki ex
plains, are typical of most South
African public schools.
"Only a handful of people fi
nally receive [a good education],"
he says."I felt very limited . ..
and there was nothing I could do
about it."
Nonetheless, the stifling atmos
phere at Kebalepile did not deter
Mooki from looking elsewhere for
his secondary education — first
in the United Kingdom and later
in the United States. Initially, the
British school system seemed the
most accessible of the numerous
avenues Mooki explored with the
aid and encouragement of a close
relative who had gone to the Uni
versity of Cardiff in Wales.
As he was checking out all his
options, Mooki heard talk of a
program specially designed to
place interested students into
boarding schools in the eastern
United States. The Independent
Schools South African Education
Program, organized by a consor
tium of six select private schools
in New England, provided Mooki
with the chance to spend a transi
tional year in the United States
before making the leap to univer
sity life.
Ultimately, Mooki chose to at
tend Milton Academy in Mass.
when he was accepted into the

ISSAEP program. Yet, stepping
out of an all-black public high
school in South Africa and into a
90 percent white, elite American
boarding school was not an al
together simple cultural adjust
ment.
"I was very much apprehensive
that I had gotten into a place that
wouldn't work very well," Mooki
says."I just trudged through and
it worked out fine."
And the experience seems to
have paid off. At Milton, Mooki
had the opportunity to explore all
of his options for studying biology
and pre-medicine at different
American universities. He claims
that now, because of his year at
Milton, he feels more comfortable
with the liberal arts philosophy
and individual orientation of Stan
ford. •
Mooki adds that Stanford has
also given him the chance to serve
as an example for other black
South Africans who might wish
to study abroad but who are dis
couraged by the prohibitive cost
and the physical as well as cul
tural distance.
"It might be a one in a million
.. . but it may give some people
more hope to see there's one more
person who went to study abroad,"
Mooki says."It may be a small
droplet but you only need a few
to start a flood."
Yet, Mooki's experience at Stan
ford is much more than a drop
in a bucket of inspiration. As he
finishes the last of his orange
juice at the picnic table outside
Wilbur dining hall, he sets the
rest of his words in perspective
by humbly pointing to the exam
ple of his father — just as
Maubane had done.
"He knows what ultimately is
good for a person is to succeed
as a person, not just to succeed
in terms of material possession
— but as a human being as well,"
Mooki says.
