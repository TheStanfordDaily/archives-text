# Class teaches women to fight harassment
## Learning to say 'no' to victimization 
### Michelle Latvala 
Striking life-size, cut-out figures of men
conspicuously appeared on campus walls
early this week. The figures are not part
of a new psychology project nor an innovative
alternative to dating at Stanford.
Grabbing attention, the black silhouettes
are designed to cause Stanford to do a
double-take and open its eyes to the in
cidence and prevention of sexual abuse.
"The biggest problem on campus is the
lack of awareness of rape, sexual harrass
ment and sexual discrimination," explained
Stephanie Teal, a student co-instructor for
the SWOPSI course "Issues in Self-Defense
for Women."
Women in the class created the cardboard
silhouettes and organized the project of
educating the community about sexual har
assment. In addition to the cut-out figures,
students have posted informational flyers
campus-wide, dispelling myths of sexual vi
olence and illustrating the body points to
aim for when defending oneself against at
tack. The project culminates today in a rally
in White Plaza at noon.
"We want to get rid of the preconceptions
and myths surrounding rape and sexual har
assment," emphasized junior Angela Quail,
a class member. "Women can and should
defend themselves."
"Sexual harassment is very much a prob
lem at Stanford," explained class-member
Julianne Coleman. "People have got to wake
up to the fact that it's not just crazy men
in dark alleys; more often than not, rape
occurs right in the home by someone the
woman knows."
Some statistics used in the class support
the strong existence of violence against wom
en, especially on college campuses. Rape is
the most prevalent violent crime, happening
more frequently than murder, according to
a U.S. Department of Justice 1980 crime
report. The same report found that one in
four women will be the victims of some
form of sexual aggression in their lifetimes.

Eighty-four percent of these assaults are
by dating partners, according to a Ms. mag
azine report on "Recognizing, Fighting and
Surviving Acquaintance Rape."
Resources from the American College
Health Association document that one in
four college men admitted using sexual ag
gression against women in 1987. In addition,
35 percent of college men said they might
commit rape if they were sure they would
not get caught, according to a study reported
by the Chronicle of Higher Education in
1983.
The course, which is offered every quarter
due to its popularity, arms Stanford women
with skills and information to battle sexual
harassment both physically and intellectu
ally.
"We are giving [women] the skills to have
choices, by channelling the strength and in
herent knowledge that are already there
within each person," Teal explained.
"If you don't know how to defend yourself,
you are always on the defense."
Self-defense is divided into three parts in
the class: physical aspects, assertiveness and
discussion. The physical part is practiced
on a punching bag and consists of learning
how to effectively hit and kick to protect
oneself.
Teaching assertiveness aims at building
confidence and affirming the emotions nec
essary for self-defense. Students learn the
legitimacy of their defense, and it reinforces
the fundamental idea that "you are worth
defending," Coleman explained.

MYTH: Rapists are strangers who at
tack on the streets at night.
FACT: Fifty percent of all reported
rapes occur in the home. More than
80 percent of rape victims know the
rapist on a first-name basis (Ms. mag
azine report "Recognizing, Fighting
and Surviving Acquaintance Rape").

It has been proven that women who make
some sort of resistance to rape are much
more likely to escape, according to class
resources. Coleman said resistance does not
always need to be physical. Verbal resistance
or unspoken pep-talks by the woman often
fend off attack, she said.
The class enacts several scenarios and con
ducts role-playing to develop that confi
dence, since rapists often "test" the resis
tance of potential victims.
"Women have been socialized to be
weaker," Teal said. "We are often helpful
and trusting to the detriment of our own
needs."
Thirdly, the class studies different prob
lems and types of oppression women con
front. The topics range from pornography
to job discrimination to racism.
"[The oppression of womenl is all tied in
together with people's philosophies," Teal
said. "Until people stop perceiving minorities
as lesser or women as weaker, the problem
will not be solved."
"Women have limited their activities be
cause of their fears; now we are finally
saying no to victimization," Coleman added.
The demonstration and informational ses
sion held today by class members aims to
encourage the rest of the community to join
them in renouncing sexual harassment and
learn facts of self-defense.
To start the noon program, everyone is
invited to shout "No" in chorus with class
members as an arousal of strength and a
reaffirmation of resistence against sexual
abuse and discrimination. The program will
continue with a discussion of myths about
sexual violence and class members will pres
ent the facts.
"All women should learn self-defense. It
really changed my whole outlook," Quail
said.
"The class really made me like men a lot
better because now I don't feel as scared;
I feel free to smile and talk to strangers
because I am confident and more secure,"
Teal said.

Grabbing attention, the black silhouettes
are designed to cause Stanford to do a
double-take and open its eyes to the in
cidence and prevention of sexual abuse.
"The biggest problem on campus is the
lack of awareness of rape, sexual harrass
ment and sexual discrimination," explained
Stephanie Teal, a student co-instructor for
the SWOPSI course "Issues in Self-Defense
for Women."
Women in the class created the cardboard
silhouettes and organized the project of
educating the community about sexual har
assment. In addition to the cut-out figures,
students have posted informational flyers
campus-wide, dispelling myths of sexual vi
olence and illustrating the body points to
aim for when defending oneself against at
tack. The project culminates today in a rally
in White Plaza at noon.
"We want to get rid of the preconceptions
and myths surrounding rape and sexual har
assment," emphasized junior Angela Quail,
a class member. "Women can and should
defend themselves."
"Sexual harassment is very much a prob
lem at Stanford," explained class-member
Julianne Coleman. "People have got to wake
up to the fact that it's not just crazy men
in dark alleys; more often than not, rape
occurs right in the home by someone the
woman knows."
Some statistics used in the class support
the strong existence of violence against wom
en, especially on college campuses. Rape is
the most prevalent violent crime, happening
more frequently than murder, according to
a U.S. Department of Justice 1980 crime
report. The same report found that one in
four women will be the victims of some
form of sexual aggression in their lifetimes.

Eighty-four percent of these assaults are
by dating partners, according to a Ms. mag
azine report on "Recognizing, Fighting and
Surviving Acquaintance Rape."
Resources from the American College
Health Association document that one in
four college men admitted using sexual ag
gression against women in 1987. In addition,
35 percent of college men said they might
commit rape if they were sure they would
not get caught, according to a study reported
by the Chronicle of Higher Education in
1983.
The course, which is offered every quarter
due to its popularity, arms Stanford women
with skills and information to battle sexual
harassment both physically and intellectu
ally.
"We are giving [women] the skills to have
choices, by channelling the strength and in
herent knowledge that are already there
within each person," Teal explained.
"If you don't know how to defend yourself,
you are always on the defense."
Self-defense is divided into three parts in
the class: physical aspects, assertiveness and
discussion. The physical part is practiced
on a punching bag and consists of learning
how to effectively hit and kick to protect
oneself.
Teaching assertiveness aims at building
confidence and affirming the emotions nec
essary for self-defense. Students learn the
legitimacy of their defense, and it reinforces
the fundamental idea that "you are worth
defending," Coleman explained.

MYTH: Rapists are strangers who at
tack on the streets at night.
FACT: Fifty percent of all reported
rapes occur in the home. More than
80 percent of rape victims know the
rapist on a first-name basis (Ms. mag
azine report "Recognizing, Fighting
and Surviving Acquaintance Rape").

It has been proven that women who make
some sort of resistance to rape are much
more likely to escape, according to class
resources. Coleman said resistance does not
always need to be physical. Verbal resistance
or unspoken pep-talks by the woman often
fend off attack, she said.
The class enacts several scenarios and con
ducts role-playing to develop that confi
dence, since rapists often "test" the resis
tance of potential victims.
"Women have been socialized to be
weaker," Teal said. "We are often helpful
and trusting to the detriment of our own
needs."
Thirdly, the class studies different prob
lems and types of oppression women con
front. The topics range from pornography
to job discrimination to racism.
"[The oppression of womenl is all tied in
together with people's philosophies," Teal
said. "Until people stop perceiving minorities
as lesser or women as weaker, the problem
will not be solved."
"Women have limited their activities be
cause of their fears; now we are finally
saying no to victimization," Coleman added.
The demonstration and informational ses
sion held today by class members aims to
encourage the rest of the community to join
them in renouncing sexual harassment and
learn facts of self-defense.
To start the noon program, everyone is
invited to shout "No" in chorus with class
members as an arousal of strength and a
reaffirmation of resistence against sexual
abuse and discrimination. The program will
continue with a discussion of myths about
sexual violence and class members will pres
ent the facts.
"All women should learn self-defense. It
really changed my whole outlook," Quail
said.
"The class really made me like men a lot
better because now I don't feel as scared;
I feel free to smile and talk to strangers
because I am confident and more secure,"
Teal said.
Striking life-size, cut-out figures of men
conspicuously appeared on campus walls
early this week. The figures are not part
of a new psychology project nor an innovative
alternative to dating at Stanford.
