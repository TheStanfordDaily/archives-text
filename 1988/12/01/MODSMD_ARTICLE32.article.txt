Someone has been killing the
vampires of London. Not present
day London, but the London of
Sherlock Holmes. Not cardboard,
vampires, like our usual
pictures of Dracula, but vampires
like Dom Simon Ysidro, the oldest
living vampire of Europe.
Author Barbara Hambly brings
such conviction and detail to her
writing, that her latest novel,
"Those Who Walk the Night" not
only completely transports the
reader to that post-Victorian time,
but also fully reveals that strange,
dark world in which vampires like
Dom Ysidro reside.
Dom Ysidro became a vampire
more than 300 years ago, when
he was a Spanish nobleman and
courtier to King Philip. For a vam
pire, he is rare, not only because
he is so long-lived, but because
he remains independent of the
vampire community.
This lack of concern for other
vampires' opinions leads him to
hire human help to find who is
murdering London's undead — a
course of action which all other
vampires loathe and fear.
But Dom Ysidro is particularly
concerned about these murders
because, as he explains, they are
not the occasional, revenge-

Excerpt
'As a vampire, lam conscious at all times of the aura, the scent, of
the human psyches near me, as much as I am conscious of the smell
of live blood. Some vampires find this almost unbearably exciting,
which is why they play with their victims. There is never a time — I
am told — when they are not thinking, "Shall it be now or later?"
And that psychic hunger, that lust for the draining of the soul, is as
far beyond the knife-edge instant before the cresting of sexual orgasm
as that instant is beyond — oh — after you have had two pieces of
marzipan, and you are wondering whether you might like a third one,
or a bit of honey cake instead.'

killings by relatives of the vam
pires' victims. "When a friend, or
a lover, or a member of (the vic
tim's) family guesses what has
happened to them, as occasionally
chances," he notes, "we usually
have warnings of their sus
picions."
But not this time. Four vam
pires have been murdered in the
traditional way, by exposure to
sunlight (which, for those un
familiar with vampire lore, burns
the flesh and bones of vampires
to ash). This time, however, they
have been killed without warning.
Since the killer is working dur
ing the daylight hours, Dom
Ysidro seeks human help. So, over

the objections of the other vam
pires, enters Prof. James Asher.
Asher seems on the surface like
a strange choice as a savior to
vampires. He is a mild-mannered
professor at New College, Oxford,
teaching philology, etymology and
comparative folklore.
What most people don't know,
however, is that he was also a
very successful spy for His
Majesty's government. With his
beloved wife's well-being held
hostage to his successful hunting
of the vampire killer, Dr. Asher
is reluctantly recruited as Dom
Ysidro's employee.
Hambly builds a truly excellent
story from this premise, in part

because the book holds several un
expected plot twists which bring
the killer horrifyingly closer to As
her than he (or the reader) would
ever have guessed.
Even more riveting, however, is
Hambly's remarkable power to
develop characters.
James Asher and his wife Lydia
both prove to be much more than
a college don and his wife. They
face true evil and horror with as
tounding prowess and determina
tion.
The vampires, especially Dom
Ysidro, are even more fascinating.
The reader will struggle along
with Prof. Asher in trying to
decide which is more evil, the
vampires or the vampire killer.
Throughout Asher's investiga
tion, he and the reader learn
about just what it means to be a
vampire. Hambly's greatest
achievement is her ability to bring
so many facets of vampirism to
light, weaving them together into
a comprehensive, believeable pic
ture. The reader will not easily
dismiss these characters from the
imagination. The book lingers in
the memory for a good, long time.
This is a wonderful book, a
fantasy-horror-murder mystery
with a tremendous cast of char
acters, a wealth of convincting
detail, an exciting plot and a res
olution which doesn't abandon the
moral tensions of Prof. Asher's
working for evil to defeat evil.
Read this book — but not when
you're alone in the house at night!
