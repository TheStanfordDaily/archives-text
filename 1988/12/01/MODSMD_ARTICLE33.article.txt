Robert Campbell, 'The Cat's Meow" (New American Library,
$16.95)
Could a dead cat possibly be the successful beginning of a
suspenseful whodunit? Could be, but not in Robert Campbell's
latest mystery, "The Cat's Meow."
The sudden death of a cat named Iggy initiates the action in
Campbell's mystery. Old Father Mulrooney, St. Pat's perennial
resident priest and Iggy's master, hears Iggy's nerve-wracking
howls issuing from the church's sanctuary the night after Iggy's
mysterious death.
He explores, and to his dismay, finds "the blood of sacrifice
inscribing a pentagram on the floor of the chapel and the corpse
of a black cat on the altar itself before a black wooden cross
turned upside down."
The story's detective is Jimmy Flannery, a would-be Nemesis
of the Gutters. Flannery is an Irish sewage inspector, a Democratic
precinct organizer for Chicago's 27th Ward — and an occasional
sleuth.
Father Mulrooney shows Jimmy the scene of the desecration
but, of course, when he does, the remnants the the Black Mass
are gone.
Jimmy decides to investigate, suspecting that the rowdy youth
of the Catholic boys' school adjacent to the church have been
causing the mischief. Another Black Mass soon occurs, however,
this time with Father's Mulrooney's dead body sprawled near the
pentagram.
This is all fairly interesting stuff for a quick reading fix. But,
unfortunately, the ultimate denouement in"The Cat's Meow" is
disappointing and Campbell's colloquial narrative voice often
seems trite.
Campbell does make ingenious use of chemicals, but unless
you hate cats, this is really one of the few redeeming qualities
of the book.

"Seasons of Light," photographs and stories by Peter Brown,
poems and essay by Denise Levertov (Rice, $24.95).
Stanford graduate Peter Brown's photography explores the
mystical role that light plays in establishing objects in space.
"Season of Light" is a unique blend of fiction and photography
that shows how a work of art evolves in the mind of the artist.
Because this book is both visual and literary, it works to establish
a dialogue between two media. This is a beautiful hardcover book
with wonderful color reproductions.
"The Greywolf Annual Five: Multi-Cultural Literacy," Rick
Simonson and Scott Walker, eds. (Greywolf Press, $8.50)
A long-needed response to Allan Bloom and E.D. Hirsch
Greywolf s Multi-Cultural Literacy" is a beautiful and important
collection of essays by James Baldwin, Paula Gunn Allen, Gloria
Anzuldua, Wendell Berry, Carlos Fuentes and others. The book
also contains a provocative list of important names and concepts
omitted from Hirsch's popular "Cultural Literacy." "The list compiled
by Hirsch and his colleagues is fine as far as it goes," note the
editors, "but their list is alarmingly deficient in its male and
European bias. This book will help define what America is and
who we are as a people.
