# Making history with the mystery
## Women writers venture out of the house and into whodunits 
### Meg Jeffrey 
A career change from housewife
to private investigator may be
non-traditional, but it's a common
phenomenon within the fictitious
worlds of women mystery writers.
Mystery fiction has risen to a
new golden age in the last five
years and, influenced by the rise
of feminist consciousness and con
cerns, many of its women ex
ponents are approaching intrigue
and suspense in a remarkably new
way.
"Women writers have less of a
tendency to exploit the female,"
says Lora Smith, author of "Mur
der in Palo Alto: Revolting Devel
opment." "Back in the olden days,
women were there pretty much
just to scream and lie down."
But, according to Smith and
eight other Bay Area mystery
writers who appeared at the Stan
ford Bookstore on Nov. 4, all that
is changing. These authors have
recognized that the skills of a
housewife can be remarkably ap
plicable to the job of P.I.
"There's no place in a P.l.'s life
for impatience, faintheartedness
or sloppiness. I understand the
same qualifications apply to
housewives," notes Sue Grafton
in her book "B Is for Burglar."
"Tough private eyes have be
come modified," says Susan
Thompson, co-editor of "SILK
STALKINGS: When Women
Write of Murder." "They don't

have to shoot someone's kneecap
out first thing to be respected."
Thompson also notes that in
women's mystery fiction, "the
murders are secondary to the en
tanglements people get them
selves into."
"Our theory is that men and
women do have different ways of
thinking," adds Victoria Nichols,
Thompson's co-editor. "Men think
in a linear fashion and women in
a circular, because so much of
what [women] do is intercon
nected."
"Once in a while," Nichols
notes, "a woman writer can pull
off a really successful murder by
a child. A man would see this
[child] as an aberrant thing; a
woman [and mother] would [be
more likely] to see this child as
a normal person."
Referring to Doris Lessing's
"The Fifth Child," in which a child
dofes commit murder, Thompson
says, "There's a sense of power
lessness. As a mother, I felt sym
pathy for this little child who was
wafting between moral values, not
knowing what to do."
Whatever their approaches, the
entertainment value of these au
thors' mystery fiction remains
central to their work.
Nichols notes, "If you've got a
really busy life, then you'll love
mysteries. They're short. They're
easy to read. It's not going to
wear your brain out. It's es
capism."
