Question: What book most profoundly influenced your life and why?

Kenneth Fields (English)
"In Defense of Reeson," by Yvor
Winters. "I was 20 years old when I
read this collection of critical essays
about American literature. I had been
interested in American literature, but
I didn't know too much about it. About
the time that I read 'Defense,' I was
also reading Winter's poetry. His work
showed me how someone could have
a passion for literature. For him,
literary experience was a form of in
tuition to be improved upon. The book
also enlivened me to the business of
writing poetry. I eventually came to
Stanford to study with Winters."
Marjorie Perloff (English)
"Remembrances of Things Past," by
Marcel Proust. "The book is the most
profound, subtle, all encompassing
novel that teaches us what life really
is. I like it too much to write about it."
Frank Donoghue (English)
"Beyond Good and Evil" by Friedrich
Nietzche. "When I started the book
at age 18, I was a practicing Catholic
and when I finished it, I wasn't. It
supplied me with the vocabulary to
describe the state of mind that I was
quickly approaching."
Ren£ Girard (French)
"Remembrances of Things Past" by
Marcel Proust and"The Bible." "When
I was young, the first book that got
me started was Marcel Proust's 'Re
membrances of Things Past.' I was
17 and I remember reading it and
feeling what an adolescent feels about
certain things. I was young in those
days of surrealism, when you tried to
do exciting things with words but
weren't supposed to express your in
nermost feelings as Proust did."
'"The Bible' brings together the idea
that the private can be said in words.
I'm concerned with human relations
and I think that 'The Bible' talks of it
powerfully. It gives you hope that
there is something meaningful beyond
the words."
Lee Yearly (Religious Studies)
"Summa Theolgia" by St. Thomas
Aquinas. "What impressed me most
was the quality and range of Aquinas'

analysis. He attempted to bring to
gether developments and traditions
that seemed unable to be brought
together. It was this combination of
very intensive analysis with a sense
for the mystery of human affairs that
attracted me to his work."
Paul Ehrlich (Biology)
"Road to Survival," by William Vogt.
"I read 'Road to Survival' when I was
an undergraduate. It first called my
attention to the population resource
problem. Though it's somewhat out of
date now, I still find it frightening.
Vogt was concerned in '48 when the
population rates were at 1 to 2 per
cent. Now they're at 3.5 percent and
things are getting worse."
George Collier (Anthropology)
"The Blood of Spain," by Ronald
Fraser and "El Erasmo en Espana,"
by Marcel Bataillon. "This was an im
portant book because it opened up an
historical perspective of the long
term ways in which political con
sciousness is shaped by contempo
rary states. It's based on first-hand
interviews with participants in the
Spanish American war. I read it in my
405."
"Bataillon's book is about the influ
ence of Erasmus on Spain. It's a mon
umental study that illuminates the
character of Spain's religious and po
litical ideology. Before reading this
book, I never understood how religion
and politics affected each other."
Bill Durham (Human Biology)
"Origin of the Species," the 1859
edition, by Charles Darwin. "Initially, I
was attracted to the opening chap
ters, the basic conceptual argu
ments. Later, I became interested in
those chapters in which Darwin dealt
with the exceptions to his theory.
There's no romance in Darwin. I try
not to glamorize the man. His writings
show a serious bias of the times. He
also was sometimes a careless scien
tist and made mistakes as a
naturalist. But it was his abilitv to
perceive issues and challenges to nis
theories that really attracted me."

Vogt was concerned in '48 when the
population rates were at 1 to 2 per
cent. Now they're at 3.5 percent and
things are getting worse."

"The Blood of Spain," by Ronald
Fraser and "El Erasmo en Espana,"
by Marcel Bataillon. "This was an im
portant book because it opened up an
historical perspective of the long
term ways in which political con
sciousness is shaped by contempo
rary states. It's based on first-hand
interviews with participants in the
Spanish American war. I read it in my
405."
"Bataillon's book is about the influ
ence of Erasmus on Spain. It's a mon
umental study that illuminates the
character of Spain's religious and po
litical ideology. Before reading this
book, I never understood how religion
and politics affected each other."

"Origin of the Species," the 1859
edition, by Charles Darwin. "Initially, I
was attracted to the opening chap
ters, the basic conceptual argu
ments. Later, I became interested in
those chapters in which Darwin dealt
with the exceptions to his theory.
There's no romance in Darwin. I try
not to glamorize the man. His writings
show a serious bias of the times. He
also was sometimes a careless scien
tist and made mistakes as a
naturalist. But it was his abilitv to
perceive issues and challenges to nis
theories that really attracted me."
