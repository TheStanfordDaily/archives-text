## Volleyball hosts USC to begin NCAA quest Spikers seek seventh straight berth in the Final Four 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women's volleyball
team's road to the Final Four will never
leave Pacific 10 Conference territory.
With every team in the West Region
hailing from the league, the No. 2 Car
dinal will be on familiar ground through
most of the NCAA Tournament, which
begins tonight with Stanford's first
round match against No. 17 USC.
The match, simulcast on KZSU 90.1-
FM, will begin at 7:30 pm in Maples
Pavilion.
As first-round opponents go, Stanford
has the toughest challenge of any
highly-seeded team in the tournament.
Physically tough, the Women of Troy
gave Stanford trouble in both Pac-10
season matchups with their unorthodox
yet effective offense and roster of
talented players.
The teams last met two weeks ago
in Los Angeles, where the Cardinal
rallied from a one-game deficit to win
the match 15-17, 15-12, 15-9, 15-10. As
close as the game scores suggest, the
match represented one of USC's finest
outings of the year and validated the
team's fourth-place finish in one of the
nation's two toughest conferences.
"They played real well," Stanford
Coach Don Shaw recalled. "They had
their team back healthy for the first
time in a few weeks — they had some
people hurt earlier this year, and that's
one of the reasons why their record
isn't as good as some of the other teams
in this region.
"But when they have their team to
gether, they're as good as any team in
the country. They're capable of beating
anybody, so that's what makes them a
tough draw. For a first-round game,
they are not indicative of a seventh seed
in any of the other regions."
Four of their starters, in fact, would
be star players on many of the teams
in the tournament. Setter Christine
Brigman, the Pac-10 leader in assists,
has at her disposal two of the most
lethal hitters in the league in Lonise
Norfleet and All-Pac-10 middle blocker
Megan McCallister, while All-Pac-10 hit
ter Nancy Hillman provides some of the
toughest backcourt defense in the coun
try.
Also working in USC's favor is a com
plicated offense, designed to keep the
opponent's blockers guessing with
prolonged spike approaches and quick
setting. Even the Cardinal, ranked 13th

in team blocking, experienced difficul
ties covering the hitters of Troy in the
beginning of both matches.
"They run a different type of offense
that runs a lot of slides and a lot of
misdirection plays where its tough to
keep with them at the net," Shaw ex
plained. "They keep our blockers on
their toes. They move you around and
attack real quickly. If they pass well,
they can be a real tough team to stop."
But if Stanford passes well — as it
began to do in the last two games of
the USC match — the Cardinal will be
an impossible team to stop. With every
starter a competent spiker (including
setter Lara Asper, who spent last season
as an outside hitter before moving back
to her high school position), the home
team has a wide array of offensive op
tions available.

The most potent weapon by far has
been left-side hitter Kristin Klein, the
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year as well
as a member of the All-Pac-10 Team.
Klein leads the Cardinal in kills, ranks
fourth in the league in hitting percent
age at .329 and is tied with senior Amy
Hayes for the team high in digs.
Junior Jennifer Chaffee has given ex
cellent right-side support, surprising the
coaches and fans with every appearance.

powerful hitting, Chaffee is developing

their team together, they're

country.'

into one of the Cardinal's most well
rounded players with her big block and
ever-improving ball-handling.
But the Trojans' biggest worry has
to be middle blocker Amy Cooper, Stan
ford's other representative on the All-
Conference and All-Freshman teams.
Cooper racked up a match- and career
high 19 kills against the Women of Troy
in Los Angeles.
The freshman has also been a front
line force defensively, tying with captain
Laura Olesen for the team lead in block
ing and finishing the regular season
rated sixth in the Pac-10.
In all, the Cardinal is well up to the
first round task assigned by the NCAA.
"It'll be a big test for us, but we'll come
through," Chaffee said.
Card notes
KZSU continues its coverage of Cardinal
volleyball with tonight's 7:15 broadcast.
Adam Fogelson, Stanford's answer to Vin
Scully, will once again handle the play-by
play duties, while the übiquitous KZSU beat
reporter Jay Tucker will add his special
touches with color commentary.
Along with being the final home match
for graduating senior Hayes, tonight's con
test may well be the whole team's Maples
Pavilion curtain call. Renovation on Old Pa
vilion (the most unusual office complex on
campus) recently began, and the spikers are
scheduled to return to the team's ancestral
home next fall. With the same springy floor
as Maples without all the empty seats, the
Cardinal will finally have a true lioine-court
advantage.
If No. 1 UCLA beats California at home
tomorrow, it will receive the honor of hosting
the West Regional it is considered the top
seed of. If till goes as planned, Stanford will
face the winner of the Washington-ASU
match to be held in Seattle for a chance to
play the Bruins for the regional title and a
berth in the Final Four in Minneapolis.
Stanford has appeared in the last six Final
Fours, an NCAA record. With three second
place finishes, two thirds and one fourth,
the team has never been able to cap off a
season with a national title. Should the Car
dinal upset UCLA, however, an NCAA title
is well within reach.

Four of their starters, in fact, would
be star players on many of the teams
in the tournament. Setter Christine
Brigman, the Pac-10 leader in assists,
has at her disposal two of the most
lethal hitters in the league in Lonise
Norfleet and All-Pac-10 middle blocker
Megan McCallister, while All-Pac-10 hit
ter Nancy Hillman provides some of the
toughest backcourt defense in the coun
try.
Also working in USC's favor is a com
plicated offense, designed to keep the
opponent's blockers guessing with
prolonged spike approaches and quick
setting. Even the Cardinal, ranked 13th

in team blocking, experienced difficul
ties covering the hitters of Troy in the
beginning of both matches.
"They run a different type of offense
that runs a lot of slides and a lot of
misdirection plays where its tough to
keep with them at the net," Shaw ex
plained. "They keep our blockers on
their toes. They move you around and
attack real quickly. If they pass well,
they can be a real tough team to stop."
But if Stanford passes well — as it
began to do in the last two games of
the USC match — the Cardinal will be
an impossible team to stop. With every
starter a competent spiker (including
setter Lara Asper, who spent last season
as an outside hitter before moving back
to her high school position), the home
team has a wide array of offensive op
tions available.

The most potent weapon by far has
been left-side hitter Kristin Klein, the
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year as well
as a member of the All-Pac-10 Team.
Klein leads the Cardinal in kills, ranks
fourth in the league in hitting percent
age at .329 and is tied with senior Amy
Hayes for the team high in digs.

cellent right-side support, surprising the
coaches and fans with every appearance.

into one of the Cardinal's most well
rounded players with her big block and
ever-improving ball-handling.
But the Trojans' biggest worry has
to be middle blocker Amy Cooper, Stan
ford's other representative on the All-
Conference and All-Freshman teams.
Cooper racked up a match- and career
high 19 kills against the Women of Troy
in Los Angeles.
The freshman has also been a front
line force defensively, tying with captain
Laura Olesen for the team lead in block
ing and finishing the regular season
rated sixth in the Pac-10.
In all, the Cardinal is well up to the
first round task assigned by the NCAA.
"It'll be a big test for us, but we'll come
through," Chaffee said.
Card notes
KZSU continues its coverage of Cardinal
volleyball with tonight's 7:15 broadcast.
Adam Fogelson, Stanford's answer to Vin
Scully, will once again handle the play-by
play duties, while the übiquitous KZSU beat
reporter Jay Tucker will add his special
touches with color commentary.
Along with being the final home match
for graduating senior Hayes, tonight's con
test may well be the whole team's Maples
Pavilion curtain call. Renovation on Old Pa
vilion (the most unusual office complex on
campus) recently began, and the spikers are
scheduled to return to the team's ancestral
home next fall. With the same springy floor
as Maples without all the empty seats, the
Cardinal will finally have a true lioine-court
advantage.
If No. 1 UCLA beats California at home
tomorrow, it will receive the honor of hosting
the West Regional it is considered the top
seed of. If till goes as planned, Stanford will
face the winner of the Washington-ASU
match to be held in Seattle for a chance to
play the Bruins for the regional title and a
berth in the Final Four in Minneapolis.
Stanford has appeared in the last six Final
Fours, an NCAA record. With three second
place finishes, two thirds and one fourth,
the team has never been able to cap off a
season with a national title. Should the Car
dinal upset UCLA, however, an NCAA title
is well within reach.

Freshman Kristin Klein, who was named to the AII-Pac-10 volleyball team last week,
leads the Cardinal into its opening-round NCAA matchup against USC tonight at
Maples Pavilion.
The Stanford women's volleyball
team's road to the Final Four will never
leave Pacific 10 Conference territory.
With every team in the West Region
hailing from the league, the No. 2 Car
dinal will be on familiar ground through
most of the NCAA Tournament, which
begins tonight with Stanford's first
round match against No. 17 USC.
The match, simulcast on KZSU 90.1-
FM, will begin at 7:30 pm in Maples
Pavilion.
As first-round opponents go, Stanford
has the toughest challenge of any
highly-seeded team in the tournament.
Physically tough, the Women of Troy
gave Stanford trouble in both Pac-10
season matchups with their unorthodox
yet effective offense and roster of
talented players.
The teams last met two weeks ago
in Los Angeles, where the Cardinal
rallied from a one-game deficit to win
the match 15-17, 15-12, 15-9, 15-10. As
close as the game scores suggest, the
match represented one of USC's finest
outings of the year and validated the
team's fourth-place finish in one of the
nation's two toughest conferences.
"They played real well," Stanford
Coach Don Shaw recalled. "They had
their team back healthy for the first
time in a few weeks — they had some
people hurt earlier this year, and that's
one of the reasons why their record
isn't as good as some of the other teams
in this region.
"But when they have their team to
gether, they're as good as any team in
the country. They're capable of beating
anybody, so that's what makes them a
tough draw. For a first-round game,
they are not indicative of a seventh seed
in any of the other regions."
