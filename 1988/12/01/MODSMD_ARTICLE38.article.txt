# Will the Bruins remain perfect?
## NCAA Volleyball Tournament preview 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
It's NCAA Tournament time
again.
Okay, it's not the March Mad
ness of the NCAA men's basket
ball tournament, but the women's
volleyball tournament stirs a few
emotions, especially at Stanford,
home of the second-ranked Car
dinal.
Thirty-two teams were selected
for the field, but Dec. 17 only one
of them will be able to call itself
national champion. Here then is
a rundown of the field, region by
region, beginning with the West.
Stanford versus USC is, of
course, the most important match
to the locals. But if the Cardinal
defeats the 17th-ranked Women
of Troy this evening, the team
will still be four matches from the
title.
Tonight's winner will go against
the survivor in a match between
Washington and Arizona State to
morrow night in Seattle. The
Huskies come in as a big favorite
after finishing third in the Pacific
10 Conference, three places ahead
of the Sun Devils.
Washington is led by senior All-
America candidate Laurie Wetzel,
one of the top all-around players
in the Pac-10. The Sun Devils can
counter, however, with senior
Christy Nore, the national digs
leader. Nore is also ASU's top hit
ter but does not have nearly the
supporting cast the Huskies have.
Led by setter Melinda Becken
hauer, outside hitters Lisa
McCammond and Kayley Grim
and middle blocker Gail Thorpe,
Washington clearly deserves its
No. 9 national ranking.
UCLA lurks in the other half
of the West region. The Bruins
are 31-0, have been ranked No. 1
since September and are the
favorites to win the NCAA title.
"I think we're playing very
well," freshman outside hitter
Laurie Jones said. "We work
really well together. . . . We're
hoping to go all the way."
California is the first team that
will try to end UCLA's season.
The Golden Bears visit the Bruins
Friday night and are led by the
trio of Tiffany Rochelle, Lisa Arce
and Holly McPeak. Cal, the Pac
10's seventh-place squad, is pretty
thin after those three, however,

and has not won a game from the
Bruins this season.
With Pac-10 Player of the Year
Daiva Tomkus, All-America setter
Ann Boyer, Jenny Crocker,
Samantha Shaver and freshmen
Elaine Youngs, Jones and Jenny
Evans, the Bruins have been
forced to only two five-game
matches this season.
"It's great," Youngs said of the
unexpected success. "I just
thought we'd be maybe the No.
5 team, like we were at the start
of the season. It's a great exper
ience."
Arizona travels to Brigham
Young in the region's other
matchup to determine who will
face the UCLA-Cal winner. Ari
zona is led by the outside hitting
of sophomore Terry Lauchner, an
All-Pac-10 selection, but the Wild
cats will face NCAA career kills
leader Dylann Duncan and the
Cougars.
Duncan, who is ranked nation
ally in hitting percentage, kills
average, blocks average and serv
ice ace average, has more than
2100 kills in her career. Senior
Jill Plumb joins Duncan to form
one of the most devastating one
two punches in Division I.
"They're not bad," Jones said
o. the Cougars, a team UCLA beat
last week. "We're lucky we won
in three (games)."
Events could then set up a
UCLA-Stanford match-up for a
Final Four berth. The two teams
have met twice this season,
causing the two blemishes on the
Cardinal's 27-2 record.
"That'll be a tough match, too,"
Jones said. "They're all going to
be tough."
Those comments were echoed by
Stanford Coach Don Shaw. "We
got a tough draw," Shaw said.
"It's going to keep us on our toes
all the way through. If we're going
to win this thing, we're going to
have to play good matches all the
way through — each match we're
going to have to play better and
better."
The winner of the West would
then become the favorite in the
Final Four. "We're going to try
pretty dang hard [to win the
NCAA title]," Jones said. "I think
we can do it if we play well."
California teams aren't the only
ones that are optimistic, however.

Laura Bush, a sophomore outside
hitter for fourth-ranked Illinois,
feels the Ulini have a shot as well.
Illinois reached the Final Four
last season before losing a close
three-game match to eventual na
tional champion Hawaii in the
semifinals. The Illini have lost to
both UCLA and the Rainbow
Wahines this season, but both
those losses were in September.
"I think we're a lot better; we're
more versatile," Bush said.
"There's a lot more cohesiveness
between us than ever before."
Illinois opens against Illinois
State, a team Bush feels they
"cannot take lightly," but should

advance to face either Notre Dame
or Penn State. Although the Nit
tany Lions sport an impressive
36-2 mark, and the Fighting Irish
have one of the nation's top block
ers in Mary Kay Waller, Illinois
should easily advance to the
Mideast Regional final behind the
play of middle blockers Mary Eg
gers and Nancy Brookhart and
outside hitters Bush and Bridget
Boyle.
Nebraska will be the likely op
ponent, as the Cornhuskers
should have little problem with
Weber State and the Western

campaign.
