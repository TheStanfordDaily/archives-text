# Hoops doubters shouldn't worry

With all the "hoop-la"
surrounding the men's
basketball team this
season, the one big fear was
that they'd somehow suffer a
letdown and fail to live up to
expectations.

After posting a 1-2 mark in
their first three games, the
Cardinal has done much to fuel
the fires of the naysayers' im
aginations.
But is such skepticism war
ranted? The thinking here is
probably not.
Let's examine the negatives
first to see why.
• Road loss #1, Indiana: The
committee in charge of the Na
tional Invitation Tournament
wasn't particularly interested
in seeing Stanford pull off an
upset and wind up in New
York.
Why? A little known team
like the Cardinal might
seriously depress ticket sales
at Madison Square Garden and
reduce revenues for the NIT
folks.
So they sent the team to In
diana, where legend-in-his
own-mind Bob Knight did his
usual intimidation number on
the officials.
That, coupled with an over
zealous Stanford defense, sent
unathletic and mildly talented
center Todd Jadlow to the
charity stripe about four zillion
times.
Jadlow's free throws, along
with Jay Edwards' 3-point
shooting, were the difference in
the contest.
It seemed that Coach Mike
Montgomery hadn't made any

offseason adjustments to
defend against the trey. But,
that brings us to . . .
• Road loss #2, North
Carolina: Okay, they lost again
— in the hallowed Dean Dome.
But, the defense seemed to
show an ability to extend out
to the rainbow line and at least
partially stop the 3-point bomb
ing of Jeff Lebo and Co.
The bad news was the Car
dinal was once again unable to
cope with the trapping, pres
sure defense provided by North
Carolina in the second half.
A three-point halftime lead
quickly turned into a big Tar
Heel advantage thanks to
Coach Smith's defense.
Still, the game never turned
into a rout and the travel
weary Cardinal has nothing to
be ashamed of after losing in
Bloomington, Ind. and Chapel
Hill, N.C.
Personnel shuffle: Oliver
Cunningham, the team's best
defensive guard, is gone. Adam
Keefe's progress was slowed by
his Friday the 13th mask. Eric
Reveno is sidelined indefinitely
with a foot injury
That's the breaks a good
team has to overcome.
Cunningham's loss isn't
good news, but with Stanford's
depth it shouldn't hurt too
much. John Patrick seems
more than ready to take up the
slack and may become one of
the team's best jump shooters.

Alright then, what's the good
news?
There's no place like home:
Finally, in a non-exhibition
contest, Stanford gets to take
the floor at Maples Pavilion.
At last year's Miracle of
Maples 11, the Arizona game,
the Cardinal faithful screamed
their heads off and brought a
home-court advantage to the
Farm for the first time in
recent memory. For the first
