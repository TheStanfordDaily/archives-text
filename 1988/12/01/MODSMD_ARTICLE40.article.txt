# Thomas adjusting well to life after competition

The second time around is even
better for Stanford's most famous
premed student. Or at least, this
time things are a little less hectic.
After stopping out for a year to
concentrate on practice and com
petition, 1986 World Figure

Skating Champion and 1988
Olympic bronze medalist Debi
Thomas is back on the Farm. And
student life for the junior is a
little more similar to her fellow
classmates' during this stint.
Between getting through re
quirements, premed courses, six
hours of daily training and a va
riety of national and international

competitions, Thomas did not
have much time to spend hanging
out with friends, hitting parties
or throwing paper at Flicks her
first two years at Stanford. In
fact, other than attending classes,
studying, and sleeping she did not
experience much traditional Stan
ford undergraduate life.
Now retired from international
competition, Thomas is excited to
discover many of the aspects of
Stanford she did not know were
here during her first two years.
"There are five million new libra
ries I didn't even know existed.
There really was so much I never
had time to do before," she says.
With medical school on the
horizon, specifically a career in
orthopedic surgery, Thomas' first
priority is academics. Although
still technically a "student
athlete," she is emphasizing the
academic part of the definition,
taking 19 units, all but Psychology
falling under premed require
ments. While her load does not
sound too exciting to the average
student, the skater is enjoying her
heavy schedule now that she has
time to sit back and contemplate
what she is being fed in class.
"Now I get to do what I should
be doing in my premed classes,"
she says."I look back and laugh
at what I tried to do before, such
as taking a chem exam and having
no idea about what was on the
test."
In addition to having time to
meet people in her classes,
Thomas is enjoying other non
intellectual facets of Stanford now
that she has time to sit back and
take a five-minute breather every
once in a while. Stopping and
chatting to friends after class is
everyday behavior for most stu

skater. So is drinking coffee and
studying on the Tresidder porch,
her favorite post-competition
campus activity.
Thomas is living off campus
now that she is married, but still
enjoys hanging around the Farm
after class. In fact, she cannot
wait for parties at Alpha Sig, her
sophomore residence, as she al
ways seemed to miss them due to
training or travel two years ago.
"I could play a little spring quar
ter because competitions were
basically over, but I missed every
single good party at Alpha Sig,"
she says.
After 12 years of daily training
and national and international
competitions, Thomas does not
long for the rink. In fact, she is
quite happy to be away from the
ice. Training, the compo
nent of competitive skating, is not
exactly her favorite activity. "I
don't miss competing yet," she
says."I got bored when I just
skated the same thing over and
over."
Little known to her adoring
fans, the queen of American ice
skating for the past three years
was dragging herself to practice
by the time the Olympics rolled
around. In fact, Thomas would
not have made it to the rink while
living and training in Boulder, Co.

last winter if it had been up to
her. "By last December I probably
would have just stayed in bed in
the morning if I hadn't been
pulled out," she says."I really
would have just missed practice,
even when the Olympics were
coming up."
Training is what made the
Olympics, supposedly the pinnacle
of an amateur athlete's career, a
disappointment for Thomas. The
skater always enjoyed competi
tions because it got her out of
practice, but after marching in the
Opening Ceremonies her coach
made her return to Boulder for
an extra week of preparation. And
even when she returned to Cal
gary, all the junior saw was the
rink.
"I thought the Olympics were
much bigger on TV than when I
actually got there," she says.
"Basically all I saw was the rink,
which made it really tiring. I
would have loved to get out and
watch skiing or bobsled."
While she did not get to view
any downhill winter sports,
Thomas did see a lot of the press,
harping on why she folded, or why
she let ice princess Katarina Witt
slip by her in the long program.
According to Thomas not only
wasn't she nervous, her morning
run-through of her program went

so perfectly that she did not know
what to think when the actual
competition came around and did
not focus on what she wanted her
final performance to be like. But
winning a bronze medal cannot
exactly be called folding.
While Thomas has quit the com
petitive circuit, she has not left
the ice completely. The student is
currently a member of Stars on
Ice, a new show comprised of
former Olympic and World Cham
pion figure skaters. Fellow show
members include Scott Hamilton,
Brian Orser and Rosalyn Sum
mers. Because the 30-city tour has
only two or three trips a month,
mostly on weekends, Thomas can
fit performing in with her aca
demic life.
While she had said before the
Olympics that she was not turn
ing professional and was return
ing to school, Stars allows Thomas
to be a full-time student and con
tinue skating as well, whereas a
show such as the Ice Capades is
a full-time job. In addition,
Thomas enjoys the freedom Stars
gives its members, allowing each
performer to design his own num
bers and choose his own music.
Thomas also enjoys the amount
of work she has to put in to pre
paring for each show. She hits the
rink no more than three times a
week for a couple of hours of prac
tice. "I'm definitely not sick of
skating any more," she says."I
don't skate too much and I really
like my programs when I get out
there."
Stars has had the past few
weeks off before it hits the Cow
Palace this Saturday, December 3
for its Bay Area show. Thomas
has been using the time to catch
up on her Psych 1 reading.

members include Scott Hamilton,
Brian Orser and Rosalyn Sum
mers. Because the 30-city tour has
only two or three trips a month,
mostly on weekends, Thomas can
fit performing in with her aca
demic life.
While she had said before the
Olympics that she was not turn
ing professional and was return
ing to school, Stars allows Thomas
to be a full-time student and con
tinue skating as well, whereas a
show such as the Ice Capades is
a full-time job. In addition,
Thomas enjoys the freedom Stars
gives its members, allowing each
performer to design his own num
bers and choose his own music.
Thomas also enjoys the amount
of work she has to put in to pre
paring for each show. She hits the
rink no more than three times a
week for a couple of hours of prac
tice. "I'm definitely not sick of
skating any more," she says."I
don't skate too much and I really
like my programs when I get out
there."
Stars has had the past few
weeks off before it hits the Cow
Palace this Saturday, December 3
for its Bay Area show. Thomas
has been using the time to catch
up on her Psych 1 reading.

Junior Debi Thomas, her competitive skating days behind her, is
getting used to being "just another student" on the Farm.
The second time around is even
better for Stanford's most famous
premed student. Or at least, this
time things are a little less hectic.
After stopping out for a year to
concentrate on practice and com
petition, 1986 World Figure

Skating Champion and 1988
Olympic bronze medalist Debi
Thomas is back on the Farm. And
student life for the junior is a
little more similar to her fellow
classmates' during this stint.
Between getting through re
quirements, premed courses, six
hours of daily training and a va
riety of national and international

competitions, Thomas did not
have much time to spend hanging
out with friends, hitting parties
or throwing paper at Flicks her
first two years at Stanford. In
fact, other than attending classes,
studying, and sleeping she did not
experience much traditional Stan
ford undergraduate life.
Now retired from international
competition, Thomas is excited to
discover many of the aspects of
Stanford she did not know were
here during her first two years.
"There are five million new libra
ries I didn't even know existed.
There really was so much I never
had time to do before," she says.
With medical school on the
horizon, specifically a career in
orthopedic surgery, Thomas' first
priority is academics. Although
still technically a "student
athlete," she is emphasizing the
academic part of the definition,
taking 19 units, all but Psychology
falling under premed require
ments. While her load does not
sound too exciting to the average
student, the skater is enjoying her
heavy schedule now that she has
time to sit back and contemplate
what she is being fed in class.
"Now I get to do what I should
be doing in my premed classes,"
she says."I look back and laugh
at what I tried to do before, such
as taking a chem exam and having
no idea about what was on the
test."
In addition to having time to
meet people in her classes,
Thomas is enjoying other non
intellectual facets of Stanford now
that she has time to sit back and
take a five-minute breather every
once in a while. Stopping and
chatting to friends after class is
everyday behavior for most stu
dents, but it's all new for the

skater. So is drinking coffee and
studying on the Tresidder porch,
her favorite post-competition
campus activity.
Thomas is living off campus
now that she is married, but still
enjoys hanging around the Farm
after class. In fact, she cannot
wait for parties at Alpha Sig, her
sophomore residence, as she al
ways seemed to miss them due to
training or travel two years ago.
"I could play a little spring quar
ter because competitions were
basically over, but I missed every
single good party at Alpha Sig,"
she says.
After 12 years of daily training
and national and international
competitions, Thomas does not
long for the rink. In fact, she is
quite happy to be away from the
ice. Training, the compo
nent of competitive skating, is not
exactly her favorite activity. "I
don't miss competing yet," she
says."I got bored when I just
skated the same thing over and
over."
Little known to her adoring
fans, the queen of American ice
skating for the past three years
was dragging herself to practice
by the time the Olympics rolled
around. In fact, Thomas would
not have made it to the rink while
living and training in Boulder, Co.

last winter if it had been up to
her. "By last December I probably
would have just stayed in bed in
the morning if I hadn't been
pulled out," she says."I really
would have just missed practice,
even when the Olympics were
coming up."
Training is what made the
Olympics, supposedly the pinnacle
of an amateur athlete's career, a
disappointment for Thomas. The
skater always enjoyed competi
tions because it got her out of
practice, but after marching in the
Opening Ceremonies her coach
made her return to Boulder for
an extra week of preparation. And
even when she returned to Cal
gary, all the junior saw was the
rink.
"I thought the Olympics were
much bigger on TV than when I
actually got there," she says.
"Basically all I saw was the rink,
which made it really tiring. I
would have loved to get out and
watch skiing or bobsled."
While she did not get to view
any downhill winter sports,
Thomas did see a lot of the press,
harping on why she folded, or why
she let ice princess Katarina Witt
slip by her in the long program.
According to Thomas not only
wasn't she nervous, her morning
run-through of her program went

so perfectly that she did not know
what to think when the actual
competition came around and did
not focus on what she wanted her
final performance to be like. But
winning a bronze medal cannot
exactly be called folding.
While Thomas has quit the com
petitive circuit, she has not left
the ice completely. The student is
currently a member of Stars on
Ice, a new show comprised of
former Olympic and World Cham
pion figure skaters. Fellow show
members include Scott Hamilton,
Brian Orser and Rosalyn Sum
mers. Because the 30-city tour has
