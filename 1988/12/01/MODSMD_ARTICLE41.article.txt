# Wrestlers dismantle S.F. State
## 
### Greg Gottesman Staff writer 
True competitors — Stanford wrestlers included
— have oft uttered the phrase, "It doesn't have
to be pretty, just give us the win."
Indeed, Stanford's 24-19 victory over San
Franscico State Tuesday night wasn't good
looking in the slightest, but it was a win — and
that's something Stanford wrestlers have been
getting pretty used to lately.
Barely more than a quarter through the season,
the Cardinal stands at 4-1, only one victory away
from equaling the win total of last year's 5-8-0
squad. Not too shabby, considering that Stanford,
unlike other Pacific 10 Conference schools, gives
no wrestling scholarships.
Stanford's only loss this year came against
Oregon, in the waning seconds of the last match
of the meet. Oregon finished second in the Pac-10
last year and finished the season ranked in the
top 20 nationally.
Against San Franscico State Tuesday, Stanford
needed some last-minute victories in the upper
weight divisions to secure the win. After losing
matches in the first two weight classes, junior
Josh Lisle provided Stanford with its first spark
as he decisioned his opponent in the 134 lbs.
division 7-5.
Sophomore Steve Buddie (177 lbs.), junior Ron
Perry (190 lbs.) and junior Steve Yarbrough (167
lbs.) remained undefeated as they scored easy
wins in their respective divisions.
In the last match, Trent Smith, who usually
wrestles at 177 lbs., moved up to the heavyweight
class, where he eventually pinned his opponent.
"It was like David versus Goliath out there.
Thankfully, the smaller guy won," Stanford Coach
Chris Horpel said.
Horpel, disappointed with the performance of
the lower weights, commented, "San Franscico
State and its light weights were fired up. They
caught us off guard. We had already beaten them
once and had just come off a tough meet against
Oregon. Sometimes it's the little things that make
a difference."
Horpel added, "We didn't fight inspiration with
inspiration, but when we had to stop the trend,
we did."

Junior Ron Perry, a 190-pounder, is 5-0 thus far this season for the Cardinal.
