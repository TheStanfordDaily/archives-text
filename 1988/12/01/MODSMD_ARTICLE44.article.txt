# Mancall denounces Shultz decision
## History prof. says U.S. should welcome PLO's moves toward peace 
### Lisa Lawrence Staff writer 
History Prof. Mark Mancall
denounced the U.S. decision to
deny PLO chief Yasser Arafat a
visa to enter the country and
address the United Nations,
calling it a "misplaced and stu
pid decision" in a live interview
Tuesday on KZSU.
What was supposed to have
been a lively debate on this
week's Campus Conference pro
gram, pitting self-proclaimed
Zionist Mancall against former
12th District Congressman Paul
"Pete" McCloskey, who has
called Israel's treatment of the
Palestinians one form of insti
tutional racism, was instead a
question-and-answer interview
with Mancall because McClos
key did not show up.
In the interview, Mancall said
that although he believes in the
right of the Jewish people to
have an Israeli homeland, "if
the PLO is making real moves
in terms of political peace, then
it must be encouraged."
The State Department denied

the visa because it said the Pal
estinian Liberation Organiza
tion has engaged in terrorism

against U.S.
citizens, and, as
head of the
PLO, Arafat
must be held re
sponsible and
should be con
sidered a threat
to U.S. security.
Mancall said
the U.S. re-

sponse to Arafat exaggerates his
importance. He is not in com
plete control of the PLO and is
not responsible for everyone in
the organization, Mancall said.
Arafat is merely the PLO's
"chairman of the board," Man
call said and that is how Arafat
sees himself. The U.S. decision
builds up Arafat in the eyes of
the world as a powerful and
threatening leader. Addressing
the United Nations in New
York, according to Mancall,
would not have made a differ
ence in Arafat's importance.
Mancall found the PLO's
recognition of U.N. Resolution

242, which calls for an end to
hostilities in the Middle East
states, to be a positive step in
Israeli-Palestinean relations. He
said he encourages a compro
mise between Israel and the
PLO, but did not say whether
he supports creation of a Pales
tinean state in the territories
occupied by Israel, which the
PLO called for in its declaration
of independence last week.
But in terms of a complete
solution to problems facing the
Middle East, Mancall said he
does not believe there is one.
"We Americans tend to look for
solutions to problems. The rest
of the world knows that there
aren't solutions to problems. We
need to resolve intangible prob
lems into problems we can work
at, but don't hold your breath
looking for a final solution."
In a separate interview last
week, McCloskey called for im
mediate U.S. recognition of the
PLO and said Israel is no longer
a reliable ally to the United
States. He also said Israel
should give up the settlements
it acquired.
