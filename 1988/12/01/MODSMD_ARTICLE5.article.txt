# Ride and Postol are planning to leave
## Arms control center thrown into 'chaos'

Astronaut Sally Ride and arms control
expert Ted Postol will resign from the Cen
ter for International Security and Arms
Control, if the University does not make
concessions to the center immediately, Pos
tol told The Daily last night.
Citing the University's "inaction and ne
glect," Postol said "it's a certainty I'll be
gone" if the University doesn't address the
center's concerns.
Ride has shunned interviews with the
press and was unavailable for comment,
but Postol said he could speak, in general
terms, on her behalf.
At the heart of the controversy is that
the center be allowed to make professorial

appointments. The planned resignations of
Postol and Ride are a show of support for
world-renowned physicist Sidney Drell, who
resigned last week as co-director of the
center over that issue.
The arms control center, recognized as
one of the world's finest, would be in severe
jeopardy if the resignations take place. Pos
tol predicted a mass exodus of researchers
from the center, leaving its previous
dominance in arms control crippled.
The arms control center is left in "chaos"
with the recent developments, said David
Bernstein, assistant to the co-directors of
the center.
University President Donald Kennedy
refused to comment last night when asked
how the resignations would affect the cen-
ter.
Postol said that "Stanford will
be out of the business [of the
technical analysis of arms con
trol]."
He said he is already negotiat
ing with other universities, which
he would not name, to establish
arms control centers there.
"I have several verbal offers
from major universities that are
competitive with Stanford," Pos
tol said. "I am carrying on
detailed discussions with those
universities."
"I think Dr. Ride will almost
certainly be gone from the cen
ter," Postol said. "She's looking
at a wide range of alternative op
portunities."
"I intend to build a center where

I go, which is not Stanford," Pos
tal said. He also said he probably
would take some of the funding
of the Stanford center with him
to another university, but he did
not want to elaborate.
The center's inability to select
professors prompted Drell's res
ignation, Drell said when he
stepped down. Without this
power, he said, the arms control
center can't guarantee its best as
sistant professors will receive ten
ure in their own departments,
such as political science and
physics. He said the researchers'
specializations often do not fit
with the emphases of the depart
ments, making it tougher for them
to receive tenure.
The University appears not to
respect the center's research and
teaching excellence, Postol said.
"The issue of academic excellence
has never been raised."
