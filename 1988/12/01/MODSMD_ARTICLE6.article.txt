# Request to ban Shultz called 'outrageous'
## 
### Brad Hayward Alicia Kent Senior staff writers 
University President Donald Kennedy
called an Arab-American group's request
that Secretary of State George Shultz be
barred from teaching at Stanford "outra
geous" in a letter sent yesterday to the
group's coordinator.
"Stanford University has no intention of
considering your request," Kennedy stated
in his three-sentence letter, which was in
response to the group's demand that Shultz
be denied his teaching position here because
he refused to grant PLO chief Yasser Arafat
a visa to enter the United States.
Victor Ajlouny, coordinator of the South
Bay Arab American Organizations, told
The Daily last night that "obviously we
(he and Kennedy) have a difference of op
inion." Ajlouny said he could not comment
further on the letter because he had not
yet received it. -
Ajlouny added that he will meet with
leaders of the seven groups that his organ
ization represents to determine what action

to take. "This won't be our last comment,"
he said.
Last night Kennedy told The Daily that
Ajlouny's request was "one of the silliest
ones I have ever heard."
The Reagan administration announced
Saturday that Arafat would not be permit-

ted to enter the United
States in order to address
the United Nations in New
York because, as head of
the Palestinian Liberation
Organization, he "knows
of, condones and lends sup
port to" acts of terrorism.
Shultz, who is an
honorary Hoover fellow
and professor in the Grad-

uate School of Business, decided not to
recommend a waiver of the law that
prohibits people identified as terrorists
from entering the country.
Kennedy said he would not comment on
whether he agreed with Shultz's move.
"That is not germain to the issue. I will


Kennedy
not try to second guess the sec
retary of state. The decision he
made, whichever way he made it,
has no bearing on whether he is
a professor here."
In a letter Monday sent to Ken
nedy, Ajlouny wrote, "It is our
strongest feeling that a university
is a place of academic freedom
and a forum which allows for the
open exchange of opposing views.
Shultz's decision ... is an affront
to these basic principles."
He explained that Shultz's de
cision to deny Arafat a visa was
a policy decision. To expect
Shultz's professorship at Stanford
to be questioned "is to profoundly
misunderstand the academic proc
ess."
Shultz, who has a home on
campus, has been on leave since
he joined the Reagan administra
tion in 1982.
