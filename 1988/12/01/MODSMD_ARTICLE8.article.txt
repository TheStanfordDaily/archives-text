# Berkeley wrestles with possible ethnic studies requirement
## 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
While the Stanford community debates whether
ethnic studies courses should be mandatory, UC-
Berkeley is evaluating a controversial proposal that
would make such classes a requirement.
The Special Committee on Education and Eth
nicity at Berkeley, composed of nine faculty mem
bers and two students, produced a proposal last
spring that would require students to take one
course on "American culture and pluralism."
Berkeley faculty met to vote on the issue but
ended up postponing a decision to allow for revisions
in the proposal.
Stanford officials were interested in the events
at Berkeley, but Stanford Vice Provost Raymond
Bacchetti said, "Their [decisionl will have no effect
on us." Bacchetti, a member of the University Com
mittee on Minority Issues, added that "Stanford
always stood independent of trends; we have our

own conscience."
Stanford History Prof. Peter Duus, chair of the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies, agreed. "I
can't imagine Berkeley's decision will have an im
pact on what happens here at Stanford," he said.
Berkeley's proposal stated that students must take
a class that presented substantial material about
two of the four following minority groups â€” Asian,
black, Hispanic and American Indian, according to
Ray Colvig, Berkeley's public information officer.
William Simmon, chair of the committee and a
professor of anthropology at Berkeley said, "We
didn't feel we had to list every ethnic group in
America," explaining why only four minority groups
were listed. He added that the four are by no means
the only cultures that would be included in such a
course.
Stanford's Dean of Undergraduate Studies Tom
Wasow did not comment on whether a new course
should be created here. He said,
however, that present courses
should more closely address issues
such as ethnicity, race and mul
ticulturalism.
Wasow added, "I sympathize
with my counterparts over there
and understand how difficult
[their decision is.]"
Noting that difficulty, Simmon
arranged for a postponement of a
decision on the issue. He said the
proposal was "misinterpreted"
and was not meant to be an ethnic
studies requirement but an
"American culture" requirement.
Speaking for the committee
Simmon said he felt the proposal
could be improved and the group
was working to do so. The new
one will be "more general [and
include] a series of course out
lines" that would serve as guides,
Simmon said.
In addition, the committee is
sending out a survey to all faculty
requesting suggestions for the
new proposal.
"A large section of the faculty
don't favor (the current proposal)
but a meyority are open-minded,"
said Simmon. "They believe it has
academic merit but by making it
a requirement, it would become
political."
Duus said that the determining
factor at Stanford would be
whether another course car
into the distribution require
ments.
Based on the committee's rec
ommendations, Stanford's distri
bution requirements will be re
evaluated. Wasow said it would
"undoubtedly incur major ex
penses to change the distribution
requirements," but added that it
is "quite conceivable that within
the next few years there might
be a degree (offered) in ethnic
studies."
