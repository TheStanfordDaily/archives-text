# Berkeley wrestles with possible ethnic studies requirement

While the Stanford community debates whether
ethnic studies courses should be mandatory, UC-
Berkeley is evaluating a controversial proposal that
would make such classes a requirement.
The Special Committee on Education and Eth

spring that would require students to take one
course on "American culture and pluralism."
Berkeley faculty met to vote on the issue but
ended up postponing a decision to allow for revisions
in the proposal.
Stanford officials were interested in the events

Committee on Undergraduate Studies, agreed. "I
can't imagine Berkeley's decision will have an im
pact on what happens here at Stanford," he said.
Berkeley's proposal stated that students must take
a class that presented substantial material about
two of the four following minority groups â€” Asian,
black, Hispanic and American Indian, according to
Ray Colvig, Berkeley's public information officer.
William Simmon, chair of the committee and a
professor of anthropology at Berkeley said, "We
didn't feel we had to list every ethnic group in
America," explaining why only four minority groups
were listed. He added that the four are by no means
the only cultures that would be included in such a
course.
