### Ken Yew Staff writer 
A recommendation that the
University increase the number
of ethnic studies courses is likely
to be included in the long-awaited
report by the University Commit
tee on Minority Issues, committee
chair A 1 Camarillo revealed yes
terday.
In a meeting of Stanford's Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies,
Camarillo, an associate professor
of history, disclosed that the rec
ommendations have been consid
ered in the closely guarded UCMI
meetings and could appear in the
UCMI report, which will be kept

secret until its release early next
quarter.
Camarillo was asked to attend
the CUS meeting because for the
last month that body has been
"working on parallel tracks" with
the UCMI on the requirement of
ethnic studies, according to CUS
Chair Peter Duus. Recently, the
Subcommittee on Distribution
Requirements was charged to con
sider the possiblity of an ethnic
studies requirement.
Camarillo said the UCMI plans
to suggest recommendations to
develop more ethnic studies
courses, to recruit faculty with
ethnic studies expertise and to ex
amine the possibility of requiring
an ethnic studies distribution re
quirement. He pointed out that
these recommendations are still
tentative and may not be included
in the UCMI's final report.
Members of the CUS said that
the committee will make no deci

sions on minority issues until
UCMI's final report is released.
"There were no discussions, no
decisions made," said Ellen
Woods, assistant to the under
graduate dean. She said the CUS
is waiting for the "real recommen
dations and not the draft ones."
Duus said in addition to requir
ing ethnic studies, the CUS is con
sidering "strengthening the non-
Western Culture requirement . . .
(and) the possibility of accomodat
ing a gender studies requirement."
The UCMI's final report which

will contain specific policy recom
mendations is to be submitted to
University President Donald Ken :
nedy and Provost James Rosse
for their consideration.
Kennedy and Rosse formed the
UCMI a year and a half ago in
response to demands by student
groups to improve minority life
on campus.
Camarillo told the CUS that
"key elements of (those) demands"
voiced the need for more courses
dealing with racial and ethnic mi
norities in the United States.
