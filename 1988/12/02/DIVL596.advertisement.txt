Honest Abe had one. Ivan the Terrible
had one. Even Curious George had one, too.
You may wear yours like a top hat, a suit of
armor, or a silk scarf. So why not flaunt it?
The International Registry of Nicknames
will permanently register your nickname and
send you a handsome, hand-lettered parchment
certificate with a gold Registry seal. You may
also request publication of your names, city,
and state in our annual Register of Nicknames.
Subscribe to the Register. Find old friends.
Make new ones. It's a great gift idea!
