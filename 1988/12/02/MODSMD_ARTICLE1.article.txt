# Center may lose half of grants
## Foundations withhold over $700K until problems adequately solved 
### Robert Landon Staff writer 
In the wake of the recent upheaval
at Stanford's Center for International
Security and Arms Control, the Car
negie Corporation is threatening to
withdraw nearly $500,000 in funding
from the center.
The Mac Arthur Foundation has also
said it is reconsidering its annual award
of $260,000 to the influential arms con
trol center. If both awards are
withdrawn, it would deliver a crippling
blow to the center by cutting in half its
total annual budget of $1.5 million.
Fred Mosher, chair of Carnegie's pro
gram for avoiding nuclear war, told The
Daily that the sudden resignation of the
center's co-director Sidney Drell was a
"tragedy," and that he will ask Stanford
administrators for a report on its plans

for replacing Drell and an explanation
of the consequences of that change.
One result already has been the threat
of resignation by two mzyor figures at
the center who support Drell's action.
Former astronaut Sally Ride and Senior
Research Associate Ted Postol have con
firmed that they may leave the center
if the appointments conflict is not re
solved.
"Drell is a very key figure, and it is
sad to see this happen," Mosher said.
He said at least half the money from
the Carnegie Foundation supports work
Drell is centrally involved in.
The $500,000 is the third installment
in a $1.35 million grant that was to be
handed out over three years.
Mosher added that it may mean the
end of a potential long-term relationship
between Carnegie and the center. "We
would have considered renewal of this

However, Mosher held out hope, say

worked out for Drell to continue work

director, there would be a good chance
funding would continue.
