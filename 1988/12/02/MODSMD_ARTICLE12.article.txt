Although Stanford's Center for
International Security and Arms
Control is having structural prob
lems, it has enjoyed a long and
fruitful relationship with Stan
ford. The center is considered one
of a kind in the United States has
had considerable influence on gov
ernment policy.
Founded in 1970 and revamped
and expanded in 1983, the center's
annual budget of $1.5 million
comes almost entirely from
private foundations, including the
Carnegie, Hewlett, Ford and
Mac Arthur foundations.
It receives little direct financial
support from the University.
Furthermore, many of the cen
ter's researchers are not faculty
members, which means that they
cannot teach without a faculty
sponsor. According to Senior Re
search Associate Ted Postol, the

center "does not have the author
ity or the independence for the
program to have any influence on
the University." This makes it
hard to recruit the best young
researchers.
The center is made up of two
parts. The "Northeast Asia-
United States Forum on Interna
tional Policy" studies security is
sues specifically related to China,
Japan and tha Korean Peninsula.
Its researchers examine the polit
ical, military and economic devel
opment in those swiftly develop
ing, potentially volatile nations.
The forum is headed by the cen
ter's other co-director, Political
Science Prof. John Lewis, who was
unavailable for comment.
The International Strategic In
stitute at Stanford makes up the
other half of the center. This half
is "heavily technical, and at the
same time oriented towards large
issues of policy," Postol said.
