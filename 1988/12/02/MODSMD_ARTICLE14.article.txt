# Kennedy explains recent conflict over procedures
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
In a statement released at yes
terday's Faculty Senate meeting,
University President Donald Ken
nedy revealed details of the two
year hidden debate over profes
sorial appointments that preceded
Sidney Drell's highly publicized
resignation from Stanford's Cen
ter for International Security and
Arms Control.
Kennedy outlined various pro
posals that Drell and the admin
istration debated prior to Drell's
resignation, none of which could
satisfy either party.
Members of a faculty committee
examining the professorial ap
pointment process also said yes
terday that their committee has
not addressed the center's issue
yet, though future discussion is
possible.
In his statement, Kennedy said
University Provost James Rosse
and Richard Lyman, director of
the Institute for International
Studies, presented Drell with two
proposals.
"The first was a commitment
to provide two Senior Research
Fellow positions in lIS that would
be open to center scholars, with
the possibility of consulting or
courtesy professorial appoint
ments in related Schools or De
partments," Kennedy's statement
read.
The second proposal would have
created "a Division of Science and
Technology Policy within the De
partment of Engineering and Eco
nomic Systems, to which center
scientists could have been appoint
ed."
Kennedy's statement said Dean
of Engineering James Gibbons
gave "strong support" to the sec
ond proposal.
In a Nov. 23 letter to members
of the center, Drell said this pro
posal alone "is inadequate to meet
the center's needs which . . . also
include a broad spectrum of non
technical policy areas."
The statement added that Drell
presented the two proposals to his
colleagues, after which they were
rejected.
"It was made plain to us that
perhaps the only satisfactory so
lution would be the creation of a

new, non-departmental structure
in which center members could
have professorial appointments,"
the statement read.
Drell said last night that he had
not seen Kennedy's statement and
would not comment on it until he
read it.
According to Kennedy, Drell
suggested that the arms control
center be modeled after the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center
with regard to academic appoint
ment procedures. Kennedy said
other alternatives were appoint
ing faculty to an existing non
departmental unit or the creation
of another department.
None of these options was
adopted by the University.
Kennedy's statement said Rosse
created four Academic Council
slots in lIS to be used to make
professorial appointments in exist
ing departments for the arms con
trol staff.
David Holloway, a center re
search fellow, was granted a
professorship in the Political Sci
ence Department through lIS, and
the three remaining positions are
still open. Drell said Lyman and
his staff will determine what de
partments those professorships
will be granted in.
But Drell feels that this plan
has not solved the problem.
"There are few established de
partments that want to become
the home department for technical
policy areas," he said.
Drell's letter said that a faculty
committee's 1985 recommenda
tion that lIS be given the author
ity to make four professorial ap
pointments not based in existing
departments was "immediately
rejected" by the administration.
Kennedy's statement said that
a new department would require
a degree program, which the arms
control center can't provide.
"There are doubts that the ap
pointment and promotion proc
esses (of interdisciplinary pro
grams) could be managed with the
same rigorous quality standards
as those regularly applied by the
groups of disciplinary peers that
are available in the departments,"
Kennedy added.
Kennedy also stressed that
"promotions to tenure often re
quire the interested support and
participation of a group of scholars
in the same discipline as the can
didate" and that junior faculty
members in an interdisciplinary
program might lack this kind of
support.
Aside from these attempts by
the University administration to
avoid the arms control center
crisis, another official explanation
hinges on the progress of a Fac
ulty Senate committee that may
overhaul the entire appointment
process within two years.
Last spring the senate created
an "ad hoc Committee on the

Professoriate" to examine how the
Stanford faculty gets its titles.
But in fact Peter Gregory, as
sociate dean of the Medical School
and a member of the committee,
said the group has not yet ad
dressed Drell's issue: getting
professorial appointments for in
terdisciplinary programs.
Rosse, who also sits on the com
mittee, said the issue "is on the
agenda" of the committee.
Rosse said the issue "is not
something easy to resolve" and
that "it probably is not solvable
on the terms Mr. Drell wants to
solve it in."
Kennedy told The Daily yester
day that Drell "probably feels that
if we were more committed, we
would have found a way" to
resolve the issue.
