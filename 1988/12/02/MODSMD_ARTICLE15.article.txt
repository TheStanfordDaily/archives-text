## RJR sale could lead to breakup 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - The pos
sibility of a corporate breakup
loomed yesterday over RJR
Nabisco Inc. after Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co. agreed to
buy the food-and-cigarette giant
for a record $24.53 billion, but
the buyout specialist said there
would be no "wholesale" selloff.
Meanwhile, RJR's debt ratings
sank and a major RJR bondholder
that had sued RJR said it might
sue Kohlberg also.
After an exhaustive bidding
free-for-all overseen by a special
RJR directors committee,
Kohlberg triumphed over an RJR
management group led by chief
executive F. Ross Johnson late
Wednesday. Kohlberg's package of
cash and securities was valued at
$109 a share for each of RJR's
225 million shares, making it the
biggest takeover agreement in his
tory
RJR's directors accepted the bid
over an apparently higher offer
from Johnson's group valued at
$112 a share or $25.2 billion.
They said both offers were nearly
the same but Kohlberg's offer
would give shareholders a 25 per
cent stake in the acquired compa
ny, compared with a 15 percent
stake offered by Johnson.
Securities analysts surveying
the aftermath of the chaotic
takeover auction for the Atlanta
based RJR said they were await

ing more details of the securities
portion of Kohlberg's bid to
emerge before making any con
clusions.
Nevertheless, many said it was
certain Kohlberg would have to
sell at least part of RJR's wide
ranging food operations — which
include Nabisco crackers, Life
Savers candies, Del Monte fruits
and other valuable brand names
— to service the enormous debt
acquired to engineer the deal.
"I can't conceive of them
keeping it intact," said Neal
Kaplan, who follows RJR for
Interstate-Johnson Lane Securi
ties in Charlotte, N.C.
Kohlberg principal Henry
Kravis told a few selected finan
cial journalists in New York that
there would be "no wholesale dis
memberment" of RJR, although
"obviously some businesses will
have to be sold," according to
people familiar with his remarks.
No decisions have been made
on what to shed, Kravis said.
New York-based Kohlberg is the
undisputed leader in leveraged
buyouts, in which it puts up a
small amount of money and bor
rows the rest, repaying the debt
with the acquired company's
earnings, assets or both. Post
buyout companies usually have
high debt-to-equity ratios, such as
10-to-l, often forcing them to sell
parts of their operations to pay
for borrowing.
