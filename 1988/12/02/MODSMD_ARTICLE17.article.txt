# Space shuttle will try again

### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Acting on an
optimistic weather report, NASA decided to try
again today to send Atlantis on the secret military
mission that was scrubbed yesterday because of
violently shifting 104 mph winds in the shuttle's
flight path.
Officials were briefed by weather experts late
yesterday and gave a go-ahead to fuel the spacecraft
again for a launch today in a three-hour period
beginning at 6:32 a.m. EST.
Air Force weathermen said there was a 70 percent
chance that winds would not interfere again if At
lantis could be launched soon after sunrise. But the
winds were expected to strengthen later in the morn
ing.
"There is no rain in the forecast; clouds are no
problem," the Air Force said.
Earlier, launch director Bob Sieck had said that
if it appeared to be a "no-go" for today, NASA
would wait until tomorrow to try again. "We don't
want to exercise the launch team, the crew and the
systems" unnecessarily, he said.
Navy Cmdr. Robert Gibson and his four-man
military crew, dressed in uncomfortable, bulky es
cape suits, had been lying on their backs in cabin
seats for nearly five hours Thursday when the de
cision was made to scrub.
"They took it in stride, so did the rest of the
team," Sieck said. "We've been talking about the
threat of this, so it came as no surprise."
The astronauts themselves were not heard from
publicly because NASA, operating under strict Air
Force secrecy requirements, did not carry the usual
shuttle-to-launch control conversations over its radio
circuit.
Using all the resources at its command — high
altitude weather balloons, radar, and a shuttle pilot
flying through the clouds — NASA continuously
sampled the weather before finally calling it quits.
"We were watching the weather all the way and
finally scrubbed due to the winds aloft," Sieck said.
