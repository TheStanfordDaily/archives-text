ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) - A
doctor charged with killing his terminally
ill wife with a drug overdose after she
unsuccessfully tried to commit suicide
was cleared of all charges yesterday in a
case sparked by a TV interview.
Peter Rosier, who said he wanted to
end his wife's suffering from cancer, was
found innocent of first-degree murder,
attempted murder and conspiracy.
The state charged that Rosier obtained
Seconal sedatives for his wife to commit

suicide, administered morphine when the
Seconal only left her comatose, and even
tually manipulated her adoptive father
and brothers into finishing the job by
smothering her.
Rosier, a Fort Myers pathologist who
faced a life-sentence in prison, jumped to
his feet and wept when the verdict was
read.
Later, he said all he felt was "relief.
The pain of this trial was over. The love
of my life was vindicated."

The charges were brought after Rosier
appeared on a television interview and
described administering the drug over
doses to his wife, Patricia, who was 43
when she died Jan. 15, 1986. Prosecutors
contended he hoped to profit from her
death with a book about it.
The Pinellas County Circuit Court jury
deliberated slightly more than three
hours after hearing four weeks of tes
timony.
An alternate juror who was excused

when deliberations began said that while
he was opposed to mercy killing, he didn't
think the state proved premeditated mur
der.
"I couldn't specifically find him guilty
of first-degree murder myself. Maybe at
tempted. Maybe conspiracy," said Glenn
Ford, 29, a savings and loan security
guard. "From the evidence, I just don't
think he met the key elements in ending
the life. I think that's what the Almighty
God is supposed to do."

The prosecution charged that Rosier,
47, pained by his wife's fast-spreading
cancer, obtained 20 Seconals for her to
take and administered morphine injec
tions and suppositories when she didn't
die from the sedatives.
After she lingered for 12 hours in a
comatose state, her father, Vincent Del
man, testified he decided "enough's
enough," went into her bedroom and
smothered her while his two sons
watched.
