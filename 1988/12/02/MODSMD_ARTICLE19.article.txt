Alleged Nazi to lose citizenship
PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — A Lithuanian im
migrant who the Justice Department claims
helped murder Jews during World War II has
agreed to surrender his U.S. citizenship, but he
will not be deported, an official said.
Under an agreement signed this week, Jonas
Klimavicius, 81, will provide evidence on other
members of the Nazi paramilitary outfit known
as the Lithuanian Shutzmannschaft.
Israel reopens West Bank schools
RAMALLAH, Occupied West Bank (AP) —
Thousands of Palestinian children streamed to
West Bank elementary schools yesterday after the
army lifted an order that shut down classes for

most of 10 months.
There were no reports of violence at the 612
private, state and U.N.-run schools attended by
about 230,000 first-through-sixth graders.
But elsewhere yesterday, a Palestinian teen
ager was killed and 15 Arabs were wounded when
troops opened fire at rock-throwing demonstra
tors in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
hospital officials said.
The 17-year-old Palestinian was killed in the
West Bank village of Kifin, north of Jenin, when
soldiers searching for protesters opened fire after
they were attacked with stones and a fire bomb,
an army statement said.
The latest death raised to at least 317 the
number of Palestinians killed since they launched
their uprising against Israeli rule in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip on Dec. 8, 1987. Eleven
Israelis also have died.
