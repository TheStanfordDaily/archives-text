# A 						year older and deeper in debt
## Provost announces $11 million budget deficit that is growing fast 
### Eric Grunwald Staff writer 
Stanford faces a "significant crisis"
in a several-million-dollar budget
shortfall, Provost James Rosse told the
Faculty Senate yesterday, and that may
mean belt-tightening throughout the
University and a renewed fund-raising
effort or larger than normal tuition in
creases in coming years.
An $11 million gap exists between
forecasted income and expenses for fis
cal year 1989-90, Rosse said, with a
similar deficit projected for the follow
ing year. This year's projected shortfall
is twice as large as last year's projected
deficit.
Rosse revealed the problem in his an
nual fall budget report to the senate.
As provost, Rosse is the University's
chief budget officer.
"I don't anticipate any significant im
pact on undergraduate education,"
Rosse said in a phone interview last

night. "We will do everything we can
not to cut educational programs. That's
what we're all about."
But Rosse added that if budget prob
lems persist, Stanford could face a fac
ulty of lower quality and fewer teaching
assistants in 15 or -20 years. TA teaching
has already been cut back this year.
"We're hardly broke," Rosse said, "but
we have to understand that we have
limited resources and that we can't do
everything we want to."
A deficit between forecasted income
and expenses is not unusual. "This time
of year," Rosse said, "budget forecasts
always show a gap . .. and then we
work our tails off to close it." Even this
year's budget has not been completely
balanced yet.
But the gap predicted for next year
is over twice as large as the prediction
made last November for this year, which
was between $4 million and $5 million.
Rosse cited the "buoyant expectations
of a university involved in a fundraising

campaign" as a msyor cause of this
year's larger gap, referring to Stanford's
five-year Centennial Fund-raising Cam
paign begun in 1987. Financial deci
sions may be made during such a cam
paign that wouldn't be made otherwise,
Rosse said, as allocations are overes
timated when rosy fund-raising
forecasts don't correspond to the actual
cash inflow.
"Every time we raise more money,
we have a bigger budget problem,"
Rosse said. As an example, Rosse said,
"We might not have tried to develop a
Washington campus (had we not been
in the middle of the Centennial Cam
paign)."
Rosse also cited unexpected Health
and Safety expenses, a change in budget
systems, increases in student aid costs,
increased costs in faculty recruitment
— especially in the sciences — and an
expected shortfall in unrestricted gifts
to the University as other causes
of the large deficit.
Attempting to obtain more un
restricted gifts and increasing tui
tion are the two solutions the
Rosse's budget team has proposed
so far.
Rosse declined to speculate on
how likely a large tuition increase

would be, but emphasized, "It's
only one in a list of possible so
lutions we're considering."
Asked how long the budget
problems are likely to continue,
Rosse predicted, "We'll be past the
worst of it in the next two years."
But he added that unexpected eco
nomic problems such as high Uni
versity utility costs, a drop in the
value of the dollar in world
markets or another stock market
crash could extend the problems.
