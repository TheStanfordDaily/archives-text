ATHENS, Greece (AP) -
Three bombs exploded in Athens
early today a few hours before the
opening of the European Eco
nomic Community summit this
weekend on the Greek island of
Rhodes, police reported. No in
jures were reported.
One blast was at the Athens
office of the EEC.
The other two explosions were
at the offices of the Greek Invest
ment Hank in central Athens and
at the offices of the Hellenic Man
agement Institute in the capital's
northern suburb of Kifissia.
All three offices were empty and
nobody was hurt in the explo
sions, said a police spokesman who
was not identified in keeping with
Greek practice.

The spokesman said
police believe a
group called the
Popular Revolution
ary Struggle carried
out the bombings.

No details were immediately
available about the extent of
damage.
The spokesman said an anony
mous caller telephoned two Ath
ens left-wing newspapers with a
warning 10 minutes before the

blasts, which occurred between
1:15 a.m. and 1:35 a.m.
No group immediately claimed
responsibility. But the spokesman
said police believe a group called
the Popular Revolutionary
Struggle carried out the bom
bings.
ELA, as the leftist group is
known, has claimed responsibility
for more than 100 explosions since
1975, many at the premises of
Greek public services.
Political leaders of the 12 EEC
states are gathering in Rhodes in
the southern Aegean Sea about
270 miles southeast of Athens for
the start of the summit meeting
tomorrow. Greece currently holds
the rotating six-month presidency
of the EEC.
