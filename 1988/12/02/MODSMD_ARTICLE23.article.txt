The Bridge's live-in
counselors provide an
indispensable service

OTHERS are fast asleep. Dur
ing those late-night hours,
students sometimes need a
souding board, someone ready to
listen when things aren't just right.
University officials are mulling
over the elimination of some of
the Bridge's space, endangering
the future of their 24-hour peer
counseling service.
To limit the operations of the
Bridge would be a grave mistake
on the part of the University be
cause 24-hour peer counseling of
fers help when students may need
it most.
The Committee on Student
Space has asked Bridge staff to
prepare a report justifying the
Bridge's live-in students, in effect
calling into question the necessity
of 24-hour trained peer counselors.
While clearly there is a shortage
of office space for student organi
zations around campus, the Bridge
is not the place to look for more
room.
Curtailing the extent of the
Bridge's services by eliminating
the four live-in counselors would
be detrimental to the welfare of
many students. Without them,
there can be no around-the-clock
assistance.
According to a Bridge staff mem
ber, over 50 students a quarter
make use of the counseling services
offered by the Bridge. This quarter
Bridge staff have counseled five
students who have contemplated
suicide, most of them after 11 p.m.
Although Counseling and Psy
chological Services staff at Cowell
Student Health Center are on call
24 hours a day to provide expert
psychological assistance, some stu

dents feel more comfortable dis
cussing their problems with peers.
Were the live-in staff to be
evicted, students experiencing emo
tional or psychological distress
could not consult a trained peer
between 11 p.m. and 8 a.m. In
some cases, this could literally
mean the difference between life
and death.
Even if Bridge counselors aid
only one student a quarter, the
service is worthwhile.
Emotional distress does not arise
only when the sun is out. In fact,
many students need most counsel
ing late at night, after their friends
have gone to bed. Often in the wee
hours of the morning, students'
most severe worries crop up — the
situation can seem hopeless or too
stressful to handle alone.
Being able to talk to a peer
trained at dealing with these con
cerns may ease these tensions im
measurably.
Rather than curtail the Bridge's
peer counseling hours, the Univer
sity should find other ways to save
office space. Though the existence
of around-the-clock peer counsel
ing services may seem unnecessary
to some, the Bridge has served
many members of the Stanford
community for 18 years.
By asking the Bridge staff to
prepare a report justifying the use
of their space, the University has
created a tense situation. Natural
ly, the staff will devote a great
amount of attention to the report
to insure that their 24-hour service
stays alive. Such time and energy
will take away from the staff s real
work — counseling.
Because counseling is what the
Bridge is all about, perhaps the
staff might want to better publicize
their services. The Bridge will be
most effective when all students
are aware of its existence.
Who can say how many lives they
have saved, and how many more
they will.
