## The 						U.S. won't play nice 
### 
THE UNITED NATIONS General
Assembly will soon approve a tem
porary move to Geneva so that Yas
ser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, may finally ad
dress that body.
Keep it there.
Move the whole U.N. apparatus to
Switzerland or some other developed
neutral country. Permanently. The
United States no longer deserves it.
With its denial of a visa to Arafat, the
United States displays a fundamental fail
ure to play by, or even to comprehend,
the sacrosanct rules of weltpolitik in gen
eral and of the United Nations in par
ticular. One can despise Arafat and still
lament this action, which has made
America look childish while clothing
Arafat as a martyr, a champion of free
speech. It adds to his power and influence,
while sapping ours and Israel's.
Secretary of State George Shultz chose
to ignore the 1947 U.N. Headquarters
Agreement, in which the United States
swore never to "impose any impediments
to transit" on those visiting the world
body. Those words bear rereading.
The State Department points to an
other law: the United States may bar
persons or members of organizations
believed to present a national security
threat.
Shultz has nothing but contempt for
the PLO's murderous record through the
1970's and 80's: Munich. Black Septem
ber. Jordanian Prime Minister Wasfi Tell.
American ambassador to Khartoum Cleo
Moore. Leon Klinghoffer.
In 1974, despite the PLO's atrocities

in the earlier 70's, Arafat was allowed
to address the United Nations. How
curious that now, after the guardedly
positive results of the Palestinian Na
tional Congress in Algiers last month,
Arafat should be prevented from address
ing the body in New York.
For access to the U.N. podium is no
privilege accorded only to those of whose
behavior the United States deigns to ap
prove. No. It is a right.
Even if presenting a security risk were
the standard, then the United States still
appears the hypocrite. Do not Iran and
Syria threaten our security when they
seize our citizens as hostages? Does not
Libya, when its minions bomb our sol
diers in West Germany? By even the nar
rowest of definitions, such actions are
"terrorist." So why not kick those nations
out too?
None of this is to say that the PLO
should now be viewed as cleansed of sin
and wholly trustworthy — at least, not
yet. While the PNC's Algiers resolutions
offer hope, they also spark suspicion,
riddled as they are with ambiguities as
to their recognition of Israel and their
renunciation of organized violence. These
suspicions are precisely what needed to
be hashed out in New York.
But now Arafat cannot lose. Before he
speaks a single word at the podium in
Geneva, he can revel in his new and
undeserved role as defender of interna
tional law and free speech.
And the United States cannot win. On
Wednesday, every single member nation
of the United Nations condemned
America's action, excepting only Israel.

Britain abstained.
Shultz, while assuredly not believing
that Arafat presents a personal threat to
[America's security, hoped to send a mes
sage against terrorism. He hoped that
his action would empower PLO
moderates. This stratagem will backfire:
Iby snubbing Arafat, Shultz eliminates a
mtyor peaceful means to peace, frustrat
ing moderates and instead empowering
extremists.
The irony is triple: that Shultz's act
shall produce the- opposite -of-what +ie
hoped; that he had previously been thjb
very model of impartiality, of hearing all
sides of the Mideast dispute; and finally,
that Shultz, the only truly outstanding
and upstanding member of the Reagan
cabinet, should close his commendable
public service career with an endnote of
ignominy.
So when the United Nations packs off
to Switzerland, let it stay there. Like the
bully who won't let another child bat in
a neighborhood ballgame because the
field is in his backyard, the United States
petulantly breaks the rules whenever it
damn well pleases. Until America grows
up, let's find a new backyard.

Even if presenting a security risk were
the standard, then the United States still
appears the hypocrite. Do not Iran and
Syria threaten our security when they
seize our citizens as hostages? Does not
Libya, when its minions bomb our sol
diers in West Germany? By even the nar
rowest of definitions, such actions are
"terrorist." So why not kick those nations
out too?
None of this is to say that the PLO
should now be viewed as cleansed of sin
and wholly trustworthy — at least, not
yet. While the PNC's Algiers resolutions
offer hope, they also spark suspicion,
riddled as they are with ambiguities as
to their recognition of Israel and their
renunciation of organized violence. These
suspicions are precisely what needed to
be hashed out in New York.
But now Arafat cannot lose. Before he
speaks a single word at the podium in
Geneva, he can revel in his new and
undeserved role as defender of interna
tional law and free speech.
And the United States cannot win. On
Wednesday, every single member nation
of the United Nations condemned
America's action, excepting only Israel.

Britain abstained.
Shultz, while assuredly not believing
that Arafat presents a personal threat to
[America's security, hoped to send a mes
sage against terrorism. He hoped that
his action would empower PLO
moderates. This stratagem will backfire:
Iby snubbing Arafat, Shultz eliminates a
mtyor peaceful means to peace, frustrat
ing moderates and instead empowering
extremists.
The irony is triple: that Shultz's act
shall produce the- opposite -of-what +ie
hoped; that he had previously been thjb
very model of impartiality, of hearing all
sides of the Mideast dispute; and finally,
that Shultz, the only truly outstanding
and upstanding member of the Reagan
cabinet, should close his commendable
public service career with an endnote of
ignominy.
So when the United Nations packs off
to Switzerland, let it stay there. Like the
bully who won't let another child bat in
a neighborhood ballgame because the
field is in his backyard, the United States
petulantly breaks the rules whenever it
damn well pleases. Until America grows
up, let's find a new backyard.
