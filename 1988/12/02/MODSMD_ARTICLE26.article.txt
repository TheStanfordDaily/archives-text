The Bridge is not a
large house, but for
mang, it's a home
When I read in The Daily that The
Bridge could possibly lose part of the
space we are currently using, I was, to
say the least, dismayed. When I was a
live-in during the summer of 1987,
there was talk that we might have a
problem with our space sometime in
the future. It seemed to be resolved
after several meetings. However, it
seems that once again, we are in
jeopardy of losing what I consider an
asset to Stanford as well as the
surounding community.
During the three years that I have
been affiliated with The Bridge, I have
had countless incredible experiences,
which have been fostered by the home
like community The Bridge offers. It is
not a large house, but it is a home. A
home that offers counseling, discus
sions, movie nights, a space for Al
coholics Anonymous to hold their meet
ings, as well as other important
groups, and a home that fosters friend
ship and openness.
To take away any space at all, is to
take away the personality and charac
ter that we have worked so hard to
build over the years. We are no longer
considered the '60s generation throw
backs; we are a place that students can
feel comfortable calling in the middle
of the night during finals, a hotline
that can give a rape victim some com
fort and guidance, a crisis center for
an individual who might be suicidal.
Perhaps the argument against The
Bridge is that we have too much space
and could easily give up a room or
two. However, I disagree. Every room
is used in the best and most efficient
manner, whether housing a live-in, who
is indeed the backbone of our home, or
allowing a women's group to meet,
which might otherwise have no place

to go.
Perhaps the argument is that The
Bridge is a service that not enough
people take advantage of and a service
that is not highly publicized. Again, I
disagree. If we help one anorexic
woman seek medical help, or one high
school student think of other ways out
rather than commit suicide, then we
are indeed worthy of the space we use.
If we help just one individual, we must
be given due respect as well as keep
our home intact.
To take away office space and give it
to another group, could divide The
Bridge. How do you think an individ
ual might feel if she or he wants to
drop by a counseling center but is
afraid that someone else might be
there to greet her or him, specifically
someone who is not a trained coun
selor?
We would no longer be a home for
fellow counselors to gather to discuss
strategies for reaching out to freshman
dormitories; we would no longer be a
haven for upset, stressed and even
potentially suicidal individuals; we
would no longer offer the purely con
fidential services that we have boasted
over the years. Not only would our
confidentiality be at stake, but the
atmosphere of warmth and caring
would be threatened by such a divisive
move as to eliminate office space.
Of course, I understand the diffi
culty of providing space for other stu
dent groups, and I empathize with
their plights. However, I ask Univer
sity to consider another place to house
those groups. The Bridge has been an
active part of the Stanford community
for many years. We are an integral
element to the surrounding communi
ties as well as providing information
and referral for the entire Bay Area.
We cannot and should not be expected
to change what we have worked at for
so many years.
I am concerned, not only because I
have been a counselor for three years;
not only becuase I have taught other
Stanford students the skills it takes to

become a peer counselor; not only be
cuase I have been a live-in and have
seen the perseverance one must have
to be an administrator of a multi
faceted counseling center; and not only
because I have seen the wonderful
things we have accomplished.
I am concerned as a member of the
community around Stanford who would
see a very worthwhile organization be
changed so drastically that its services
would surely suffer.

Fliers for women's
self-defense class
in the men's room?
I went to the bathroom yesterday
and found myself the captive audience
of a flier on the SWOPSI women's
self-defense class. First of all, let me
express my support and encouragement
for such a class. Now let me express
my disapproval of this circular.
Around the edges of the flier are
various myths and facts about rape, all
of which we Stanford students, espe
cially males, need to hear about (tor
example, rape is not a crime of pas
sion, but one of violence).
However, the flier's overwhleming
impact comes from its depiction of a
male body with various "targets" of
vulnerability highlighted. In effect, this
blank-faced figure equates manhood
with sexual assault, and I, for one,
resent the equation.
I have always been opposed to un
jusitified assault, even before reading
"Against Our Will," but this applies to
any sort of wholesale attack.
I support the idea of getting self
defense information out to women, but
for men, unfortunately, the SWOPSI
flier's verbal information gets over
shadowed by an intimidating how-to
chart of physical violence.

What is the purpose of putting such
a flier in a men's toilet? Is it to
frighten men? We already know we can
be kicked in the balls; just please don't
do it when we're trapped in the toilet
stalls.

Chinese students
must not be limited
by visa regulations
It would be a shame if a student
from the People's Republic of China
had to abandon a course of study be
cause of new visa regulations described
in a Nov. 22 Daily article.
The Nov. 7 issue of The New Re
public suggests that while student ex
changes seemed like a good idea, per
haps they are hurting party credibility.
It quotes Jerry Qian, described as a
product of Rutgers and son of the vice
minister of transportation in China, as
saying, "All high-level cadres have kids
overseas â€” about 50 percent in the
U.S. and rest in Japan and Europe."
Cited as having children who are or
were in U.S. schools were Zhao Ziyang,
head of China's Communist Party and
Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount
leader.
It named as students or former stu
dents Peng Xiaofei, whose father
headed the Petroleum Ministry, and
Qian Jeahua, daughter of China's
former minister of health.
Also, a story last summer in The
Asian Wail Street Journal said some
Chinese who had earned American
MBAs were being frozen out by the
business bureaucracies in which they
were placed.
It quoted one of them as saying he
was better off running a fruit stand on
the sidewalk.
