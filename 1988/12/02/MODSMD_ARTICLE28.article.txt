## Denying Arafat entry affirms anti-terrorist stance 
### 
IN HER RECENT LETTER to The
Daily, Rachelle Marshall misrepre
sented the facts concerning Secretary
of State George Shultz's decision to deny
a United States visa to Palestine Liber
ation Organization Chairman Yasser
Arafat.
Marshall argued that given Israeli
brutality in the West Bank and the PLO's
peaceful declarations at the Palestinian
National Council Conference in Algiers,
there is no reason why Arafat should not
be allowed in the United States.
Marshall's argument is based on false
statements. There do exist valid reasons
for denying Arafat entry into the United
States. Moreover, such a decision can be
viewed as furthering the Middle East
peace process.
Although the connection to her argu
ment is unclear, Marshall began her letter
with a distorted synopsis of what she
called "Israeli brutality" in the West
Bank. She cited Palestinian-Arab deaths
at the hands of Israeli soldiers through
torture, breaking bones, bombing and
even gassing.
There have been deaths in the Israeli
occupied West Bank. And these deaths
have been tragic. Yet these deaths have
occured as a result of the Palestinian-
Arab uprising.
In attempting to quell violent disturb

ances, Israeli soldiers have used tear gas,
rubber bullets and other means which,
although they are restrained measures,
have caused deaths.
Israeli soldiers are ordered to use min
imum force. They are allowed to use live
ammunition only if attacked and if it is
clear that their lives are in danger. In
cidents have occured where soldiers have
stepped out of line in their conduct. But
to argue, as Marshall has, that these
incidents are the norm and not the ex
ception is a gross misrepresentation.
The next part of Marshall's letter dealt
more with Shultz's decision to bar Arafat
from entering the United States. Marshall
deplored the Secretary of State for using
terrorism as a "transparent excuse" since
at the recent PNC Conference the PLO
had recognized Israel's right to exist and
presumably had also renounced terror
ism.
The fact of the matter is that Arafat
has engaged in verbal gymnastics in order
to avoid the explicit recognition of the
state of Israel and renunciation of ter
rorism.
While the PNC Conference was still in
session, Arafat was reported by Kuwaiti
newspapers as still affirming a plan the
PLO had devised in 1967 called the "Two
Phase Solution". This plan calls for secur
ing the West Bank first, and then

peace process.

proceeding to secure the rest of Palestine
(Israel).
PLO Executive Committee Member
Abd-Allah Hourani also made statements
demonstrating that the PLO had no in
tention of recognizing Israel's right to
exist. As recently as November of this
year, Hourani explained in the Egyptian
newspaper Al-Akhrar that "the declara
tion of the Palestinian state is the be
ginning of the road to the elimination of
the fascist Zionist State (Israel)."
More importantly perhaps, from the
U.S. standpoint, the PLO, contrary to
Marshall's implication, has not
renounced terrorism. Abu Abbas, the
mastermind of the Achille Lauro hijack
ing in which an innocent American was
murdered, was welcomed at the recent
PNC meeting in Algiers.
Arafat's spokesperson, Abu Iyad, ex
plained in the Egyptian newspaper Al-
Itihad that the PLO will not abandon its

military struggle against Israel. Finally,
the PLO has yet to amend its charter so
that it no longer encourages terrorism
against innocent Israeli civilians.
Because of all that, Shultz decided
against Arafat's entry into the United
States. As chairperson of a terrorist or
ganization which has committed crimes
against American citizens, Arafat does
not qualify for a visa. Indeed, if he were
an American citizen, he would be in
prison and would not be free to go speak
to the United Nations Assembly.
For those who truly want to see a peace
ful end to the Arab-Israeli conflict, ex
plicit recognition of the self
determination of all parties involved (in
cluding the Palestinian-Arab people and
Israel) must come first. Terrorism must
be renounced emphatically. These are
necessary prerequisites for peace.
Shultz, through his decision to deny
Arafat entry into the United States, af
firmed America's position against terror
ism, conveying to the PLO that its empty
declarations at the PNC Conference were
not enough. In this way, Shultz helped
pave the way for the possibility of real
peace to ensue between Israel and the
Palestinian-Arab people.
