'Curtailing' budget
for TAs lowers the
quality of education
Dean Ewart Thomas says the Teach
ing Assistant budget can be cut with
out "compromising the quality of in
struction" (The Daily, Nov. 28).
Don't you believe it.
Law students who once TA'd 20
hours a week in political science
courses have been cut to 12. This 40
percent "curtailment" may well elimi
nate discussion sections or make them
so large they're not worth having.
The quality of undergraduate educa
tion at Stanford has just been lowered.

Professor, political science
