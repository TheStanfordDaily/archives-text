They have different back
grounds. Some are Hawaiians.
Others are Korean, Japanese,
Chinese, Filipino or Vietnamese.
But although Asian Americans
have different cultures and tradi
tions, their similar immigration
experiences tie them together as
a group.
Tomorrow night, Asian Ameri
cans from several Northern
Californian colleges will gather at
Stanford to affirm their identity.
The "Waves of Pride" Cultural
Night will celebrate Asian-
American culture and history and
will be held at the Christine
Ricker Dining and Performance
Center in Sterling Quad at 8 p.m.
The cultural night, sponsored
by the Asian/Pacific Islander Stu
dent Union (APSU), showcases
several performances of Asian-
American live art including music
and dance. In addition, speakers
will relate experiences of native
Hawaiians and describe Korean
immigration patterns.

After the event, the Stanford
Asian-American Student Associa
tion and the Korean-American
Student Association will host a
dance for all Stanford students
and students from other colleges
involved in "Waves of Pride."
Several colleges — including
San Jose State, Santa Clara Uni
versity, UC-Santa Cruz, and UC-
Berkeley — are expected to send
representatives.
Performances presented by
Stanford students include the
debut performance of the new
Chinese Folk Dance Group, a
Hula dance by the Ho'oikaika - a
Hawaiian student group, a selec
tion from last year's acclaimed
play, "Paper Angels" and an Obon
dance by the newly-formed Stan
ford Univerisity Nikkei — a
Japanese student group.
The theme of the cultural night,
"Waves of Pride" alludes to the
waves of Asian immigration to the
United States.

Asian-American Theater Project,
depicts the discrimination against
Chinese entering the United
States in the late 19th century.
All Asian immigrants passed
through Angel Island in Califor
nia where some were brutally
treated.
Another example of the Asian-
American experience is the efforts
and struggles of Asian-American
communities to organize, con
gregate and celebrate their Asian
heritage. The Obon Dance is a
traditional dance used by
Japanese-Americans to tighten
their community.
The sponsor of the cultural
night is an organization com
prised of Asian groups from col
lege campuses state wide that
provides a means of communica
tion and support for Asian stu
dents. The organization works to
empower Asian-American
peoples, as does Stanford's Asian-
American Student's Association.
Founded in 1978, the associa
tion arose from a nation-wide stu
dent movement that established
minority student groups on cam
puses. Originally, students organ
ized to preserve affirmative action
policies and other civil rights
developments of the 19605.
The association sponsors many
activities along the West Coast,
such as cultural events,
workshops, conferences on Asian-
American social issues, as well as
