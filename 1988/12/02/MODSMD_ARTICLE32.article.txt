They have different back
grounds. Some are Hawaiians.
Others are Korean, Japanese,
Chinese, Filipino or Vietnamese.
But although Asian Americans
have different cultures and tradi
tions, their similar immigration
experiences tie them together as
a group.
Tomorrow night, Asian Ameri
cans from several Northern
Californian colleges will gather at
Stanford to affirm their identity.
The "Waves of Pride" Cultural
Night will celebrate Asian-
American culture and history and
will be held at the Christine
Ricker Dining and Performance
Center in Sterling Quad at 8 p.m.
The cultural night, sponsored
by the Asian/Pacific Islander Stu
dent Union (APSU), showcases
several performances of Asian-
American live art including music
and dance. In addition, speakers
will relate experiences of native
Hawaiians and describe Korean
immigration patterns.

After the event, the Stanford
Asian-American Student Associa
tion and the Korean-American
Student Association will host a
dance for all Stanford students
and students from other colleges
involved in "Waves of Pride."
Several colleges — including
San Jose State, Santa Clara Uni
versity, UC-Santa Cruz, and UC-
Berkeley — are expected to send
representatives.
Performances presented by
Stanford students include the
debut performance of the new
Chinese Folk Dance Group, a
Hula dance by the Ho'oikaika - a
Hawaiian student group, a selec
tion from last year's acclaimed
play, "Paper Angels" and an Obon
dance by the newly-formed Stan
ford Univerisity Nikkei — a
Japanese student group.
The theme of the cultural night,
"Waves of Pride" alludes to the
waves of Asian immigration to the
United States.
For example, one of the
performances, part of "Paper An
gels," presented by Stanford's

All Asian immigrants passed
through Angel Island in Califor
nia where some were brutally
treated.
Another example of the Asian-
American experience is the efforts
and struggles of Asian-American
communities to organize, con

heritage. The Obon Dance is a
traditional dance used by
Japanese-Americans to tighten
their community.
The sponsor of the cultural
night is an organization com
prised of Asian groups from col
lege campuses state wide that
provides a means of communica
tion and support for Asian stu
dents. The organization works to
empower Asian-American
peoples, as does Stanford's Asian-
American Student's Association.
Founded in 1978, the associa
tion arose from a nation-wide stu
dent movement that established
minority student groups on cam
puses. Originally, students organ
ized to preserve affirmative action
policies and other civil rights
developments of the 19605.
The association sponsors many
activities along the West Coast,
such as cultural events,
workshops, conferences on Asian-
American social issues, as well as
action on political issues such as

redress and reparations for
Japanese-Americans incarcerated
during World War 11.
This APSU Cultural Night in
dicates the increasing activity of
Asian-American groups at Stan
ford. Recently, new Asian groups
have emerged, signaling
heightened awareness of Asian-
Americanism on campus.
In order to better represent
Japanese in the Stanford commu
nity, sophomore Lisa Kimura
started Stanford Univerisity Nik
kei. The group's activities include
feasting on Japanese cuisine as
well as learning about Japanese
culture.
Other Asian groups which have
formed since last year are the
Stanford Vietnamese Association,
the Asian-American Theater Proj
ect, the Asian-American Graduate

Student Association, Ho'oikaika,
the Asian-American Business Stu
dent's Association, Undergradu
ate Chinese-American Association
and the Asian-American Women's
Journal Club.
"It seems like a lot of new Asian
groups are sprouting up. It's prob
ably because of more resources
and support for the Asian com
munity, especially from the Asian-
American Activities Center.
"The logic behind it is that if
people can help you get started
and help get funding, generally
there is a greater chance of you
starting a group," says Joann Lin,
who started the Chinese Folk
Dance troupe which will perform
a native Taiwanese dance and a
tambourine dance Saturday night.
The Asian-American Activities
Center has become a cornerstone
of the Asian community at Stan
ford since its birth in 1987. The
center found University sponsor
ship after students of the Rainbow
Coalition demanded official

recognition and funding.
Kimura, founder of the
Japanese student group said, "I
wouldn't have started the group
if the Asian-American Activity
Center hadn't been there."
The center is managed by the
three-quarters time Asian-
American ethnic dean Julian Low,
and seven paid student and non
student staff members.
The center serves as a support
group and a resource center, with
its own library and an Asian-
American counselor, Karen
Huang, who has weekly office
hours. In addition, the center
facilitates communication be
tween Asian-American students
and the University administra
tion, as well as between Asian
groups themselves.
The cultural night offers non-
Asians a rare chance to partake
of Asian-American culture. For
Asian Americans, the event aims
to remind, or perhaps teach, them
about their heritage which is now
finding a renaissance at Stanford.

Stanford Vietnamese Association,
the Asian-American Theater Proj

Student Association, Ho'oikaika,
the Asian-American Business Stu

"It seems like a lot of new Asian
groups are sprouting up. It's prob
ably because of more resources
and support for the Asian com
munity, especially from the Asian-
American Activities Center.
"The logic behind it is that if
people can help you get started
and help get funding, generally
there is a greater chance of you
starting a group," says Joann Lin,
who started the Chinese Folk
Dance troupe which will perform
a native Taiwanese dance and a
tambourine dance Saturday night.
The Asian-American Activities
Center has become a cornerstone
of the Asian community at Stan
ford since its birth in 1987. The
center found University sponsor
ship after students of the Rainbow
Coalition demanded official

recognition and funding.
Kimura, founder of the
Japanese student group said, "I
wouldn't have started the group
if the Asian-American Activity
Center hadn't been there."
The center is managed by the
three-quarters time Asian-
American ethnic dean Julian Low,
and seven paid student and non
student staff members.
The center serves as a support
group and a resource center, with
its own library and an Asian-
American counselor, Karen
Huang, who has weekly office
hours. In addition, the center
facilitates communication be
tween Asian-American students
and the University administra
tion, as well as between Asian
groups themselves.
The cultural night offers non-
Asians a rare chance to partake
of Asian-American culture. For
Asian Americans, the event aims
to remind, or perhaps teach, them
about their heritage which is now
finding a renaissance at Stanford.
They have different back
grounds. Some are Hawaiians.
Others are Korean, Japanese,
Chinese, Filipino or Vietnamese.
But although Asian Americans
have different cultures and tradi
tions, their similar immigration
experiences tie them together as
a group.
Tomorrow night, Asian Ameri
cans from several Northern
Californian colleges will gather at
Stanford to affirm their identity.
The "Waves of Pride" Cultural
Night will celebrate Asian-
American culture and history and
will be held at the Christine
Ricker Dining and Performance
Center in Sterling Quad at 8 p.m.
The cultural night, sponsored
by the Asian/Pacific Islander Stu
dent Union (APSU), showcases
several performances of Asian-
American live art including music
and dance. In addition, speakers
will relate experiences of native
Hawaiians and describe Korean
immigration patterns.

After the event, the Stanford
Asian-American Student Associa
tion and the Korean-American
Student Association will host a
dance for all Stanford students
and students from other colleges
involved in "Waves of Pride."
Several colleges — including
San Jose State, Santa Clara Uni
versity, UC-Santa Cruz, and UC-
Berkeley — are expected to send
representatives.
Performances presented by
Stanford students include the
debut performance of the new
Chinese Folk Dance Group, a
Hula dance by the Ho'oikaika - a
Hawaiian student group, a selec
tion from last year's acclaimed
play, "Paper Angels" and an Obon
dance by the newly-formed Stan
ford Univerisity Nikkei — a
Japanese student group.
The theme of the cultural night,
"Waves of Pride" alludes to the
waves of Asian immigration to the
United States.
For example, one of the
performances, part of "Paper An
gels," presented by Stanford's

Asian-American Theater Project,
depicts the discrimination against
Chinese entering the United
States in the late 19th century.
All Asian immigrants passed
through Angel Island in Califor
nia where some were brutally
treated.
Another example of the Asian-
American experience is the efforts
and struggles of Asian-American
communities to organize, con
gregate and celebrate their Asian
heritage. The Obon Dance is a
traditional dance used by
Japanese-Americans to tighten
their community.
The sponsor of the cultural
night is an organization com
prised of Asian groups from col
lege campuses state wide that
provides a means of communica
tion and support for Asian stu
dents. The organization works to
empower Asian-American
peoples, as does Stanford's Asian-
American Student's Association.
Founded in 1978, the associa
tion arose from a nation-wide stu
dent movement that established
minority student groups on cam
puses. Originally, students organ
ized to preserve affirmative action
policies and other civil rights
developments of the 19605.
The association sponsors many
activities along the West Coast,
such as cultural events,
workshops, conferences on Asian-
American social issues, as well as
action on political issues such as

redress and reparations for
Japanese-Americans incarcerated
during World War 11.
This APSU Cultural Night in
dicates the increasing activity of
Asian-American groups at Stan
ford. Recently, new Asian groups
have emerged, signaling
heightened awareness of Asian-
Americanism on campus.
In order to better represent
Japanese in the Stanford commu

started Stanford Univerisity Nik

feasting on Japanese cuisine as
well as learning about Japanese
culture.
