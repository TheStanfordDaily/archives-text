# In search of the human brain
## 
### 
There has been a push re
cently in the scientific commu
nity to develop a greater
understanding of the human
mind. After all, a thorough com
prehension of the brain and its
function would allow us to an
swer such questions as "How
do we learn?" and "What deter
mines intelligence?" and "Why
do grown-ups listen to country
music?"
The brain itself is a remark
able object to behold, its ridges
and folds miraculously holding
the entire knowledge of a
lifetime of learning. Although to
be honest, the one time I did
have the chance to behold a
brain it was lying on my dinner
plate, while my mother sat
across from me grinning inces
santly at the notion that her
son — her son that is too picky
to eat brussels sprouts, mind
you — would think of chewing
and swallowing a brain.
Needless to say I smuggled
the brain under the table to the
cat while her back was turned,
although I made sure to com
plement her profusely on the
fine culinary masterpiece she
had created. ("Nice hemi
spheres, mom, and boy that
cerebellum was juicyf)
Nowadays we know far more
about the human mind than
they did in medieval times. Back
then it was thought that mental
disease was caused by evil
demons in your head, and the
only known cure was to drill
holes in the skull to allow them
to escape. Of course now, thanks

to sophisticated, modern medi
cal knowledge, we understand
that these demons can only be
driven away after being sub
jected to several thousand dol
lars worth of psychoanalysis.
From a historical perspective,
Sigmund Freud is known as the
father of psychoanalysis, or sim
ply "Dad." He theorized that the
human personality is divided
into three parts: the id, the ego,
and the Winnebago. Further
more, he showed that children
go through five main develop
ment stages: the oral stage, the
anal stage, the nasal stage, the
phallic stage and the decorating
the bedroom with heavy metal
posters stage.
Boys, he proved, suffer from
the "Oedipus complex" (desire
to add a silent "o" to one's
name), while women suffer from
"Penis envy" (desire to have
one's sexual organs on the out
side, where they can become
noticeably engorged at ex
tremely inopportune moments,
such as when wearing a Speedo.)
Freud, however, was not the
first to study the mind. Before
him, a Russian scientist named
Ivan Pavlov discovered that by
consistently ringing a bell before
he fed his dog, eventually the
animal would begin drooling at
the mere sound of the bell. Un
fortunately, Pavlov was slow to
realize the significance of this
discovery, and died unhappy and
penniless, spending his waking
hours trying to find bells to feed
to his dog.
Later scientists improved

upon Pavlov's findings, eventu
ally discovering that the human
psyche is actually divided into
the conscious (eating, speaking,
breakdancing), the unconscious
(breathing, sweating, fantasiz
ing) and the semi-conscious
(Ronald Reagan). This discovery
provided import inroads into our
understanding of the human
mind and laid the groundwork
for Modern Psychologists.
Modern Psychology itself has
come a long way since the days
of Freud when the only require
ment for being a psychologist
was to own a couch. Today in
California, for instance, to be
come a licensed psychologist you
must have either: (a) a Ph.D
from an accredited university,
or (b) a beard.
In addition to having a beard,
psychologists — especially im
portant ones — must have a
funny name: Sigmund Freud,
B.F. Skinner, B.F. Goodrich,
Phil Zimbardo. You get the pic
ture.
Of these great psychologists
with funny names, B.F (pro
nounced "barf") Skinner prob
ably made the greatest
contribution to our modern un
derstanding of human behavior.
Skinner proved in an experi
ment that rats could be taught
to repeatedly press a lever as
long as they were "rewarded"
with food. Eventually the rats
