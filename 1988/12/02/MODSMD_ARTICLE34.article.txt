Heavy breathing alert
World-class studs Mel Gibson, Kurt Russell
and Raul Julia star opposite the beautiful Mi
chelle Pfeiffer in the new movie "Tequila Sun
rise" which opens today across the country.
Russell plays a cop assigned to put his former
high-school buddy, Gibson, behind bars for
dealing drugs. Pfeiffer is the beautiful restaurant
owner that tantalizes them both.
You won't get another chance to see so
many beautiful people together on one screen
until, well, Christmas Day. That's when "Working
Girl," opens, starring Melanie Griffith, Sigourney
Weaver and Harrison Ford.
Until then, let's have one big collective
sigh
Damned to metal hell
It's hard to be a rebel these days.
Used to be you could throw a heavy metal
album on the ol' stereo and know you were
bucking the mainstream. These days, however,
bands with long hair, power licks and sexual
misogynistic lyrics are as plentiful as Kevin
Seal's face on MTV.
This week's pop charts include no less than
eight "heavy metal" bands in the top 20: Guns
N' Roses, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Poison, Cin
derella, Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen and Ratt.
Metallica dropped out of the top 20 this week
after charting as high as No. 10.
Wait'll they break into the Adult Contemporary
charts!
