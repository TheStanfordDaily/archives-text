## A 						nifty nouveau 'Nutcracker' 
### Shirky Herkha 
For many people, "The Nutcracker"
evokes images of a traditional Christmas
celebration. However, Santa Cruz-based
Tandy Beal has taken the well-known
ballet and transformed it into an inno
vative dance theater.
Beal's "Nutcracker" features many
traditional elements of the holiday clas
sic — the music of Tchaikovsky, the
Sugar Plum Fairy, Clara, the Prince,
Drosselmeyer, Land of the Snow, Land
of Marzipan Sweets and an enormous
Christmas tree — but incorporates jug
glers, roller skaters (watch out "Star
light Express") and gymnasts as well
to create an unusual but refreshing new
show.
One hallmark of Tandy Beal's
"Nutcracker" is her use of local talent,
and this production is no exception. In
cluded in the cast for the Stanford shows
(there is another group of performers
for next weekend's shows in Santa Cruz)
are 20 dancers from Stanford who were
selected throught auditions in October
and who have been rehearsing with the
company ever since.

Featured are a pair of
championship roller
skaters from Redwood
City, the Stanford
Gymnastic Club and
Tecali, a Mexican
dance group com
posed of former mem
bers of Stanford's Bal
let Folklorico.

Also featured are a pair of champi
onship rollerskaters from Redwood City,

Beal herself has had quite an exten
sive dance and theater career, perform
ing both as a solo artist and with her
own troupe in New York, Paris, London,
Tokyo and Hong Kong. Her wide
ranging interests and talent for sucess
fully blending the traditional and non
traditional have involved her in many
varied projects. She worked for three
years with singer Bobby McFerrin to
produce an extensive Calfornia and na
tional tour, as well as a television pro

duction "Voice/Dance," which was first
broadcast nationally in 1987.
Beal b'egan her work on her
"Nutcracker" in 1982, rehearsing with
more than 65 performers and designers
in 13 different locations throughout
Santa Cruz County. She originally
played with the idea of creating a 21st
century setting for the ballet, but, re
alizing that tradition is an intrinsic el
ement of the Christmas season, eventu
ally decided to create "a madcap version
based around Hoffmann's well-known
tale."
According to The San Francisco
Chronicle, Beal's contemporary version

succeeds in presenting "an entirely fresh
look at the Christmas classic ... that
honors the tradition of the original Pal
let at the same that it challenges all
our expectations."

Tandy Beal's "Nutcracker" plays
tonight and Saturday at 8 p.m. and
Sunday at 2:30 p.m at Memorial Au
ditorium. The Sunday show is sold out,
