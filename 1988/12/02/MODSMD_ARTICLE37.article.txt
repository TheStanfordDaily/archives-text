## New Hollywood trend: Motherhood in the movies 
### Alex Kostich Staff writer 
In the weeks preceding the
holiday movie season a trio of
films have been released that deal
with the issue of motherhood.
Diane Keaton, Meryl Streep and
Shirley MacLaine have each been
cast as mothers or motherly fig
ures in"The Good Mother," "A
Cry in the Dark" and "Madame
Sousatzka" respectively.
While all three actresses per
form up a storm, only one's char
acter can be labeled a "good
mother".
In"The Good Mother," Diane
Keaton plays Anna Dunlap, a
divorced woman who falls in love
with a street musician. The man
moves in with Anna and her 4-
year-old daughter, Molly, and con
flict develops when Anna's former
husband begins questioning Anna
and Leo's lifestyle, and sues for
the custody of his daughter.
While Anna is a nice lady (she
smiles and lends quarters to
strangers), she's too much of a
softie when she's with Molly.
In the first five minutes of the
film, the little girl spills milk,
refuses to eat her breakfast and
loses her shoe while dressing for
school. Keaton's Anna takes it all
with a smile, not once becoming
exasperated or authoritative.
While a good mother should not
slap her child for such behavior
(children will be children), a rep
rimand would ensure in the
child's mind that spilling milk
(etc.) is not acceptable, whether
by accident or on purpose.
In the book of the same name,

Anna truly is a "good mother" —
but the translation to the screen
loses most of the descriptive char
acter detail the novel has, and
Anna ends up looking like a softie.
Meryl Streep's Lindy Chamber
lain in "A Cry in the Dark" is
the worst mother of the lot —
she is a cold, unemotional and
careless woman. On a camping
trip with her family, she leaves
her baby in a tent unattended.
The infant disappears, supposedly
eaten by a wild dog.
The rest of the film is a court

room drama which tries to prove
that Mrs. Chamberlain killed her
baby and fabricated the wild dog
story. Whether or not Mrs. Cham
berlain is guilty of murder, the
fact that she left her daughter
alone in a tent is reason enough
to deem her a "bad" mother —
a woman with such a young child
should not be so careless.
After the incident, Streep's
character never offers support or
affection to her two remaining
children, who are devastated at
the loss of their newborn sister.

Streep's Chamberlain is not
much of a mother at all — she
is a stonelike presence who seems
relatively unaffected by the loss
of her baby. She neglects her other
children, too.
In "Madame Sousatzka," Shir
ley MacLaine plays the title char
acter, a piano teacher with high
standards. An Indian boy signs
up for music lessons, and
Sousatzka unearths his extraordi
nary talent.
The film focuses on their rela
tionship, both at and away from

the piano. Ironically, Sousatzka is
not a mother by definition (she
has no children), yet she possesses
a maternal instinct which Anna
and Lindy Chamberlain lack.
With her pupils, Sousatzka is
strict but never overbearing.
When the students make mistakes
(wrong notes are like spilling milk
or refusing to eat breakfast),
Sousatzka scolds but never in
timidates. She is also affectionate
with her star pupil, hugging him
in moments of triumph and visit
ing his home when he falls ill.

Most importantly, MacLaine's
character sacrifices her own hap-
Diness for the sake of her student.
The conclusion of the film fea
tures an experience all mothers
face; the growing up of their child
and the inevitable separation
from it. While Sousatzka has the
power to keep her pupil/son under
her wing, she lets him follow his
own course.
Madame Sousatzka has the
firmness that Anna needs, and
the warmth and caring that Lindy
Chamberlain lacks. She is truly
the "good" mother.


Warner Bros.

and Shirley MacLaine star in "Cry in the Dark," "The Good Mother" and "Madame
