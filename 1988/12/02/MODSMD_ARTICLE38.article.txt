## Women roll Trojan's horse out of Maples 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
1 — 2 — 3 — Final Four.
Exhibiting signs of brilliance
hitherto only hinted at in the reg
ular season, the Cardinal
launched itself down the road to
a possible seventh straight Final
Four appearance with an impres
sive first round win over USC
last night at Maples Pavilion that
highlighted the talents of gradu
ating senior Amy Hayes and Car
dinal captain Laura Olesen.

Cardinal 3, Women of Troy 0

With the 15-13, 15-7, 15-11 vic
tory, the Cardinal increased its
season tally to 28-2 and validated
its No. 2 position on the final
Tachikara/AVCA poll. Stanford
also advances to the next round
of the NCAA Tournament, namely
the West Regional scheduled for
next weekend at UCLA should the
undefeated Bruins knock off Cal
ifornia tonight.
For the No. 17 Women of Troy,
the contest marked the end of
their championship hopes and the
conclusion of a disappointing 18-
16 season. Though last night's
visitors managed to out-dig the
Cardinal 59-50 and out-serve the
home team 12 aces to seven, USC
fell short in the crucial areas of
hitting and blocking and saw its
season end one hour and 17
minutes after its postseason play
began.
"We were well-prepared and
played real well," Stanford Coach
Don Shaw said. "We had a few
spells where we shanked some
passes into the bleachers, but we
do that every game so that's noth
ing unusual. We got down 8-11
in the third game by missing a
few passes, but instead of losing
the third game we came back and
pulled it off."
In Los Angeles two weeks ago,
Stanford's win was a hat trick of
sorts. Staving off prolonged spells
of inconsistent passing, the Car
dinal recovered from a one-game
deficit to record a four-game win.
The spells were few last night,
allowing setter Lara Asper to use
her skilled hitters to their fullest.
Much of the credit belongs to
Hayes, playing the final home

match of her collegiate career.
Hayes got her forearms on almost
every serve and many Trojan
spikes, notching a team-high 13
digs and delivering perfect passes
to Asper time and time again.
"I thought Amy Hayes played
really well in the backcourt," USC
Coach Chuck Erbe said. "In the
first two times that we played,
especially the last time we played,
they had some real difficulty pass
ing and this time they didn't. This
time she came in really focused
and determined."
"I felt like I was really concen
trating well tonight," Hayes con
curred. "We all can pass — it's
just a matter of being able to con
centrate well enough to make a
good pass."
The Women of Troy, by con
trast, found themselves
entrenched by Stanford's strong
hitting for most of the match.
With a 13-kill barrage from Kris
tin Klein and 10-kill performances
from Jennifer Chaffee and Olesen,
the Cardinal capitalized on the
visitors' inconsistent defense to
side-out and score at crucial junc
tures.
The middle was particularly
helpful for the Cardinal cause,
with starting middle blockers
Olesen and Cooper each playing
well. Cooper, who led Stanford
two weeks ago with a carrer-high
19 kills in Trojan territory, gar
nered eight kills, a .500 hitting
percentage and five blocks. Olesen
added a team-high six blocks to
her shrewd hitting.
"I knew coming into this match,
as my team did, that we had to
break down their serve receive,"
Erbe said. "We had to serve tough,
serve consistently and have a lot
of aces, and serve in such a man
ner as to keep Cooper and Olesen
out of the match."
USC fulfilled Erbe's game plan
but was still unable to signifi
cantly stall Stanford's middle at
tack. Even All-Pacific 10 Confer
ence player Nancy Hillman's
backcourt prowess, good for a phe
nomenal 22 digs, was not enough
to stop the on-fire offense or
chestrated by Asper.
Added to the Cardinal's best
blocking display in recent
memory, Stanford's balanced at
tack sent USC back home with
but a single chance to attend the
remainder of the NCAA Tourna
ment — as spectators.

19 kills in Trojan territory, gar
nered eight kills, a .500 hitting
percentage and five blocks. Olesen
added a team-high six blocks to
her shrewd hitting.
"I knew coming into this match,
as my team did, that we had to
break down their serve receive,"
Erbe said. "We had to serve tough,
serve consistently and have a lot
of aces, and serve in such a man
ner as to keep Cooper and Olesen
out of the match."
USC fulfilled Erbe's game plan
but was still unable to signifi
cantly stall Stanford's middle at
tack. Even All-Pacific 10 Confer
ence player Nancy Hillman's
backcourt prowess, good for a phe
nomenal 22 digs, was not enough
to stop the on-fire offense or
chestrated by Asper.
Added to the Cardinal's best
blocking display in recent
memory, Stanford's balanced at
tack sent USC back home with
but a single chance to attend the
remainder of the NCAA Tourna
ment — as spectators.

1 — 2 — 3 — Final Four.
Exhibiting signs of brilliance
hitherto only hinted at in the reg
ular season, the Cardinal
launched itself down the road to
a possible seventh straight Final
Four appearance with an impres
sive first round win over USC
last night at Maples Pavilion that
highlighted the talents of gradu
ating senior Amy Hayes and Car
dinal captain Laura Olesen.

With the 15-13, 15-7, 15-11 vic
tory, the Cardinal increased its
season tally to 28-2 and validated
its No. 2 position on the final
Tachikara/AVCA poll. Stanford
also advances to the next round
of the NCAA Tournament, namely
the West Regional scheduled for
next weekend at UCLA should the
undefeated Bruins knock off Cal
ifornia tonight.
For the No. 17 Women of Troy,
the contest marked the end of
their championship hopes and the
conclusion of a disappointing 18-
16 season. Though last night's
visitors managed to out-dig the
Cardinal 59-50 and out-serve the
home team 12 aces to seven, USC
fell short in the crucial areas of
hitting and blocking and saw its
season end one hour and 17
minutes after its postseason play
began.
"We were well-prepared and
played real well," Stanford Coach
Don Shaw said. "We had a few
spells where we shanked some
passes into the bleachers, but we
do that every game so that's noth
ing unusual. We got down 8-11
in the third game by missing a
few passes, but instead of losing
the third game we came back and
pulled it off."
In Los Angeles two weeks ago,
Stanford's win was a hat trick of
sorts. Staving off prolonged spells
of inconsistent passing, the Car
dinal recovered from a one-game
deficit to record a four-game win.
The spells were few last night,
allowing setter Lara Asper to use
her skilled hitters to their fullest.
Much of the credit belongs to
Hayes, playing the final home

match of her collegiate career.
Hayes got her forearms on almost
every serve and many Trojan
spikes, notching a team-high 13
digs and delivering perfect passes
to Asper time and time again.
"I thought Amy Hayes played
really well in the backcourt," USC
Coach Chuck Erbe said. "In the
first two times that we played,
especially the last time we played,
they had some real difficulty pass
ing and this time they didn't. This
time she came in really focused
and determined."
"I felt like I was really concen
trating well tonight," Hayes con
curred. "We all can pass — it's
just a matter of being able to con
centrate well enough to make a
good pass."
The Women of Troy, by con
trast, found themselves
entrenched by Stanford's strong
hitting for most of the match.
With a 13-kill barrage from Kris
tin Klein and 10-kill performances
from Jennifer Chaffee and Olesen,
the Cardinal capitalized on the
visitors' inconsistent defense to
side-out and score at crucial junc
tures.
The middle was particularly
helpful for the Cardinal cause,
with starting middle blockers
Olesen and Cooper each playing
well. Cooper, who led Stanford
two weeks ago with a carrer-high
19 kills in Trojan territory, gar
nered eight kills, a .500 hitting
percentage and five blocks. Olesen
added a team-high six blocks to
her shrewd hitting.
"I knew coming into this match,
as my team did, that we had to
break down their serve receive,"
Erbe said. "We had to serve tough,
serve consistently and have a lot
of aces, and serve in such a man
ner as to keep Cooper and Olesen
