# Men's hoops hosts Apple Invitational
## 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
Though it failed to harvest big
wins at the Big Apple National
Inviational Tournament, the
Stanford men's basketball team
hopes the fruits at its own Apple
Invitational will be delicious.
Stanford (1-2, ranked 19th by
UPI, 30th by AP) opens its home
season against defending Ivy
League champion Cornell (1-1) at
6:30 p.m. tonight at Maples Pa
vilion. Colorado State plays
Pacific in the other first-round
game following the conclusion of
the Cardinal-Big Red battle of the
monochromatics.
The consolation game will be
played Saturday at 6:30 p.m., with
the championship game to follow.
Stanford junior Derek Bruton
starts for the second time in place
of senior Eric Reveno at center.
Reveno has undergone extensive
treatment this week for a sprained
right ankle and foot.
Reveno may play for a short
stretch to get him into a game
flow, according to Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery, but will not
do anything over the weekend to
jeopardize his health.
Stanford will use a rotation that
moves senior Howard Wright into
the center, or five spot, with fresh
man Adam Keefe picking up the
slack, but Big Bru will have the
first crack at the Big Red.
"Against North Carolina (Mon
day) I was really nervous," said
Bruton, who had four points
against the Tar Heels. "If I was
to start again a lot of those nerves
would be gone."
Another aspect of Stanford's
flexible rotation will involve the
guard position, as the Cardinal
must make up for the departure
of guard Oliver Cunningham, who
quit the team Saturday for per
sonal reasons.
"I think it was a personal
thing," senior guard Terry Taylor
said. "I guess in his mind basket
ball wasn't a thing to him
anymore. I guess he figured com
ing to practice every day wasn't
worth it."
"We all support his decision,"
Bruton said. "We all think

Oliver's a hell of a guy. We miss
him as a player, but it's his life
and if that's his decision we have
to support him."
Sophomores Andrew Vlahov
and Deshon Wingate, both 6-foot
7, had already been seeing
minutes at the off-guard position,
so expect to see them and 6-4
classmate John Patrick even more
in the upcoming games to com
pensate.
The odd-man out of the rotation
so far has been senior forward
Bryan McSweeney, who has
averaged 13.3 minutes and 3.0
points per game so far.
McSweeney seemed to be taking
the decreased playing time well.
"I knew coming in we were
going to have a rotation,"
McSweeney said. "I'm still not
positive about what Coach's rota
tion is; I'm not sure he is either.
"We've got three people who can
play," McSweeney continued. "It's
a matter of [Montgomery] getting
together the team that has the
best chemistry."
Despite these question marks,
the Cardinal has to be considered
the favorite in the Apple Inviata
tional.
Cornell went 17-10 last year
while winnig its first Ivy League
title in 34 years, but seven players
of that team graduated and took
80 percent of Cornell's points and
74 percent of its rebounds with
them.
What's more, starting forward
Nate Grant and reserve guard
Terrell Dillard both suffered
season-ending knee injuries in the
last week, and the Big Red's
leading scorer, senior guard Josh
Wexler (14.0 ppg) is plagued by a
heel bruise.
"If anyone has any eligilibilty,
we have extra uniforms," Cornell
Coach Mike Dement said.
If Cornell needs someone to ex
plain what hard times are, how
ever, it can look at Pacific. Wed
nesday night, the Tigers (5-24 last
year, 1-1 this year) ended a 23-
game losing streak by beating Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo, a Division
II school.
First-year coach Bob Thomason
has begun to turn the program
around, but he still acknowledges

there are problems. When asked
about his team's defensive
rebounding on Wednesday night,
Thomason quipped, "It was going
pretty good at one stretch because
they (Ca! Poly-SLO) scored nine
times in a row."
The biggest threat to Stanford
looks like Colorado St. The Rams
(2-0) are picked by Street and
Smith's and The Sporting News
to win the Western Athletic Con
ference, a conference rated just
below the Pacific 10.
Senior 6-8 forward Pat Durham
(27.0 ppg, 10.5 rpg) led the Rams
back from down 14 in the second
half against Colorado Wednesday
to a 73-72 win. Colorado St. shot
78 percent in the second half of
what Rams Coach Boyd Grant
called one of the greatest com
ebacks he had ever seen.

Card notes
Hob Murphy and John Platz will
carry the Stanford action live on
KCBS (740 AM), while Adam Fogel
son and a cohort to be named later
will man the headsets for KZSU (90.1
FM).
Selected stats: Todd Lichti is shoot
ing 58.1 percent from the field and
is averaging 21.3 ppg. He passed
UCLA's David Greenwood to move
into 13th place on the all-time Pac-10
scoring list. .. Scott Meinert is shoot
ing 71.4 percent on 3-pointers (6-for
-7)....
Adam Keefe is averaging one
rebound every four minutes. His 4.3
rebounds per game are third on the
team. Howard Wright is shooting 50
percent from the field, 46.7 percent
from the free-throw line.
Stanford is making its third try at
the 900 th win in school history.

vilion. Colorado State plays
Pacific in the other first-round
game following the conclusion of
the Cardinal-Big Red battle of the
monochromatics.
The consolation game will be
played Saturday at 6:30 p.m., with
the championship game to follow.
Stanford junior Derek Bruton
starts for the second time in place
of senior Eric Reveno at center.
Reveno has undergone extensive
treatment this week for a sprained
right ankle and foot.
Reveno may play for a short
stretch to get him into a game
flow, according to Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery, but will not
do anything over the weekend to
jeopardize his health.
Stanford will use a rotation that
moves senior Howard Wright into
the center, or five spot, with fresh
man Adam Keefe picking up the
slack, but Big Bru will have the
first crack at the Big Red.
"Against North Carolina (Mon
day) I was really nervous," said
Bruton, who had four points
against the Tar Heels. "If I was
to start again a lot of those nerves
would be gone."
Another aspect of Stanford's
flexible rotation will involve the
guard position, as the Cardinal
must make up for the departure
of guard Oliver Cunningham, who
quit the team Saturday for per
sonal reasons.
"I think it was a personal
thing," senior guard Terry Taylor
said. "I guess in his mind basket
ball wasn't a thing to him
anymore. I guess he figured com
ing to practice every day wasn't
worth it."
"We all support his decision,"
Bruton said. "We all think

Oliver's a hell of a guy. We miss
him as a player, but it's his life
and if that's his decision we have
to support him."
Sophomores Andrew Vlahov
and Deshon Wingate, both 6-foot
7, had already been seeing
minutes at the off-guard position,
so expect to see them and 6-4
classmate John Patrick even more
in the upcoming games to com
pensate.
The odd-man out of the rotation
so far has been senior forward
Bryan McSweeney, who has
averaged 13.3 minutes and 3.0
points per game so far.
McSweeney seemed to be taking
the decreased playing time well.
"I knew coming in we were
going to have a rotation,"
McSweeney said. "I'm still not
positive about what Coach's rota
tion is; I'm not sure he is either.
"We've got three people who can
play," McSweeney continued. "It's
a matter of [Montgomery] getting
together the team that has the
best chemistry."
Despite these question marks,
the Cardinal has to be considered
the favorite in the Apple Inviata
tional.
Cornell went 17-10 last year
while winnig its first Ivy League
title in 34 years, but seven players
of that team graduated and took
80 percent of Cornell's points and
74 percent of its rebounds with
them.
What's more, starting forward
Nate Grant and reserve guard
Terrell Dillard both suffered
season-ending knee injuries in the
last week, and the Big Red's
leading scorer, senior guard Josh
Wexler (14.0 ppg) is plagued by a
heel bruise.
"If anyone has any eligilibilty,
we have extra uniforms," Cornell
Coach Mike Dement said.
If Cornell needs someone to ex
plain what hard times are, how
ever, it can look at Pacific. Wed
nesday night, the Tigers (5-24 last
year, 1-1 this year) ended a 23-
game losing streak by beating Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo, a Division
II school.
First-year coach Bob Thomason
has begun to turn the program
around, but he still acknowledges

there are problems. When asked
about his team's defensive
rebounding on Wednesday night,
Thomason quipped, "It was going
pretty good at one stretch because
they (Ca! Poly-SLO) scored nine
times in a row."
The biggest threat to Stanford
looks like Colorado St. The Rams
(2-0) are picked by Street and
Smith's and The Sporting News
to win the Western Athletic Con
ference, a conference rated just
below the Pacific 10.
Senior 6-8 forward Pat Durham
(27.0 ppg, 10.5 rpg) led the Rams
back from down 14 in the second
half against Colorado Wednesday
to a 73-72 win. Colorado St. shot
78 percent in the second half of
what Rams Coach Boyd Grant
called one of the greatest com
ebacks he had ever seen.

Card notes
Hob Murphy and John Platz will
carry the Stanford action live on
KCBS (740 AM), while Adam Fogel
son and a cohort to be named later
will man the headsets for KZSU (90.1
FM).
Selected stats: Todd Lichti is shoot
ing 58.1 percent from the field and
is averaging 21.3 ppg. He passed
UCLA's David Greenwood to move
into 13th place on the all-time Pac-10
scoring list. .. Scott Meinert is shoot
ing 71.4 percent on 3-pointers (6-for
-7)....
Adam Keefe is averaging one
rebound every four minutes. His 4.3
rebounds per game are third on the
team. Howard Wright is shooting 50
percent from the field, 46.7 percent
from the free-throw line.
Stanford is making its third try at
the 900 th win in school history.
