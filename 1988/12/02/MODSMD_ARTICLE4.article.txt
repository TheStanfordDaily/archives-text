# Invites needed for SAE parties
## Under insurance pressure, frat votes to limit bar night crowds 
### DJ Berinstein Staff writer 
The beer will still be flowing at
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity's
weekly bar nights next quarter,
but it might flow to a smaller,
more select group of people.
In a policy change effective win
ter quarter, the SAEs will close
their previously open Wednesday
bar nights, in order to limit the
number of party-goers and the
fraternity's liability in the case of
an accident.
Although SAE has never been
sued because of party mishaps,
said SAE President Scott Yeager,
"people don't deal with the prob
lems until something happens. We
want to get a jump on it before
something does."
The fraternity's move came in
dependent from policy debates in
the Inter-Fraternity Council and
was applauded by University of
ficials. Other fraternities have
been considering the idea, but
SAE was the first to act.
Stanford's SAEs were pres

sured by their national chapter
and alumni to close their parties.
According to Yeager, most other
chapters of the fraternity already
have closed parties or will close
them soon.
In order to attend an SAE party,
guests will have to present an in
itiation at the door, which will
be verified through a name on a
guest list and a picture ID.
Although the invitations may
seem selective, they could turn
out to be fairly easy to obtain. To
get one, interested persons may
come to the house any time before
a party and introduce themselves
to the social chair. Once issued,
the invite is valid for the entire
year.
Although the national chapter
urged the action, the individual
fraternity is not bound to follow
national bylaws, thanks to a Uni
versity policy. For a fraternity to
receive Stanford recognition, Uni
versity bylaws require it to be au
tonomous from its national chap
ter.
On the other hand, if the SAEs

did not conform to their national
policy in this case, they would not
be included on their national
chapter's insurance policy.
"There is one goal here (to
reduce risks at parties), but it
might create a lot of side effects,"
said IFC President Chris Erlin.
"Whether it turns into elitism or
creates a stronger nuclear system
remains to be seen."
The University reaction was
cautious approval. "It's a bold
move by the SAEs," said Frater
nal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano. "I
applaud their effort to be respon
sible hosts and to have safe par
ties. I'm hoping people won't be
put off, and I'd like it to work."
Despite the liability issue,
Pisano said he is concerned that
the act might seem as "exclusion
ary." Understanding this dilem
ma, Yeager said, "If no other fra
ternities close their parties we
may look bad, but hopefully they
will come around."
It is open to question whether

A sign in the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity house announces a new policy to lower party attendance
by requiring invitations. Effective winter quarter, the SAEs will close their previously open Wednesday
bar nights.
