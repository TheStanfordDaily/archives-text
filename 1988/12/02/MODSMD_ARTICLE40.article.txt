# Olesen, Hayes make sweet pair for the Cardinal
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Oh, what a sweet send-off for
Amy Hayes.
•
It was not only Hayes' final
match at Maples Pavilion, but
quite probably the last ever there
for the women's volleyball team
(they're slated to move to Old Pa
vilion next year).
And what a match it was as
Stanford stormed through the
first round of the NCAA tourna
ment last night, trouncing USC
in three straight games.
Hayes and senior Laura Olesen,
who has a year of eligibility
remaining, were key cogs in a Car
dinal machine that was clicking
on all cylinders and purring more
smoothly than at anytime this
year.
Only seven members of the 12-
person squad saw significant ac
tion last night because the
starters rarely faltered. Stanford
Coach Don Shaw noted that he
makes "situational substitu
tions," bringing in a defensive spe
cialist like Tracy Hughes when it
is appropriate or a big blocker like
Jessica Benton if the block is
weak.
Hughes took over for middle
blocker Amy Cooper in the back
row last night and played ad
mirably. But it was Hayes and
Olesen, two of the players Shaw
often substitutes for, who re
mained on the court throughout
the match as a result of their
excellent play.
Benton never got into the match
because Olesen, who acknowl
edged her reputation as a slow
but steady player afterward, came
out fast and remained strong.
Olesen led a strong Cardinal
block assisting on a game-high six
of the team's total of 12. The
block frustrated USC's complex
offense all night, never allowing
the Women of Troy to mount a
substantial run and take a game.
For good measure, the Cardi
nal's captain also hit a sterling
.444 while tallying 10 kills.
Hayes, on the other hand, did
it not with hitting and blocking,
but with digging and passing.
But the block wasn't the only
incentive for USC's hitters to
think about taking up jai alai or
some other sport where you beat
a ball into a wall. When Megan
McCallister, Lonise Norfleet, et al.
actually succeeded in penetrating
the Cardinal's first line of defense,
Hayes took to the ground and
lifted the ball skyward.
Thirteen times, Hayes dug USC
spikes — a match high. Freshman
sensation Kristin Klein scooped
up almost everything Hayes
didn't, recording 12 digs herself.
And while Hayes contributed
only a modest seven kills, they
seemed to come at key moments:
either squelching USC rallies or
igniting Cardinal runs.
It is almost ironic that in a year
where much of the team's spec
tacular success is a result of the
play of two freshman — Klein
and Cooper — in the biggest
match of the season the squad's
two most experienced members
stole the show.
Klein and Cooper, the All-
Pacific 10 Conference team mem
bers certainly both played well
last night. But it was Hayes and
Olesen, two of the team's wily
veterans who made the difference.
The Cardinal now stands only
four wins away from an NCAA
championship. For Amy Hayes,
that would be the sweetest send
off of them all.
