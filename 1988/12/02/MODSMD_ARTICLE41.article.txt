in the Las Vegas Invitational is
like placing at the NCAA's. If they
don't place, at least the three will
improve by going up against the
best guys in the nation."
According to Horpel, the other
three grapplers, Nowick (118 lbs.),
Vigil (126 lbs.), and Dinette (142
lbs.) are "knocking on the door"

"tough" matches in Las Vegas.

wrestlers exposure to the best
competition in the nation. Just
seeing great athletes perform
makes you get better," concluded
Horpel.
