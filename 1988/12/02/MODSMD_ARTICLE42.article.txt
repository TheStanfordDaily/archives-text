# Rugby hosts 10-a-side
## 
### 
Big Game: most people prob
ably think of football when they
hear that phrase; most people,
that is, except for rugby
players. As any member of the
Stanford rugby team is quick
to point out, the original Big
Game between California and
Stanford was a rugby match.
This weekend Stanford's
rugby players kick off their
83rd season by hosting the
Stanford Ten-a-Side Tourna
ment all day Saturday on the
IM Fields. According to Cap
tain Bill Bradford, this year's
men's team has high hopes of
recapturing some of the glory
it has garnered in the past and
perhaps even besting perennial
rival Cal.
"We're pretty sure we'll have
a winning season," says Brad
ford. "We'd like to go out hard
(at the season's start) and be
a painful surprise to a lot of
people."

Accordingly, the team is ex
cited about its game this week
end. At least 65 other teams
from around Northern Califor
nia will be playing in this
"open" tournament, so called
because entrance is not
restricted to college teams. Col
lege, high school, and recrea
tional clubs will all be playing.
The Cardinal will be fielding
five teams for this tournament,
including one women's team.
Although a team usually has
15 players per side, these
matches will have only 10 in
dividuals from each school.
This limitation results in a
"less cluttered field" and a
"more open game," according
to Bradford.
Some faces to watch for on
the men's "first," or best, team
will be those of seniors Will
Wall and John Fitzpatrick and
freshman Joe Croft.
