# Women's basketball looks to tame Wildcat Invitational
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
It has often been said that the grass is
always greener on the other side of the
fence.
The Stanford women's basketball team
is finding out how true that is.
Since Coach Tara VanDerveer came to
the program four years ago the team has
been striving to become a national power.
With that accomplished, the sixth-ranked
Cardinal is finding out it's not easy to stay
on top.
The team is coming off a narrow 62-58
win over Fresno State Tuesday and will
take its 2-0 record against upset-minded
Missouri tonight in the first round of the
Wildcat Invitational in Evanston, 111.
"Every time we play a team its a big
game for them," VanDerveer said. "So it
has to be a big game for us. . . . Beating
Stanford would make a lot of teams' sea
sons.
With the nation's top freshman class,
and five returning starters, the Cardinal
is expected to continue the improvement
seen under VanDerveer. "I think we've got
a lot more potential in players and depth,"
junior forward Katy Steding said, "but it
seems like we have farther to go. Our goals
are higher."
This weekend's field — Stanford, Mis
souri, Brigham Young and host Northwest
ern — should provide the Cardinal with
some good competition. "The teams are all
very good teams," VanDerveer said. "[Mis
souri] is a traditionally strong team.
They're a quick team. They play pressure
man-to-man defense, which is what most
of the best teams play. . . . Defensively
they're going to give us a good challenge."
VanDerveer still feels the team is playing
better than the narrow win over Fresno
State, a team picked to finish sixth in the
Big West Conference, would indicate.
"I know that we are much-improved,"
she said. "We're obviously not jelling yet.

Some individual people are doing some good
things [though].. .. We've worked on some
things and almost ignored other things.
Fresno State did all those other things.
Half of it is things we have to do; half of
it we have no control over."
"It was the first time we played against
a zone (defense)," guard Jennifer Azzi said.
"We weren't aggressive in attacking it. ...
As a whole I think we're playing better
now than we did last year at this point
but we need to play a lot better if we want
to go for . . . the Final Four."
The Final Four? A team that went 27-5
last season but 14-14 in 1987, 13-15 in
1986, 9-19 in 1985 and 5-23 in 1984? Is
that possible?
"I think so," Azzi said. "I think we have
to be a lot more consistent."
The team also needs more balance than
they had against Fresno State where Azzi
and Steding combined for 42 of the teams'
62 points.
"We have to play within a team effort,"
VanDerveer said. "We can't depend on one
or two people to win the game for us. . ..
It's really early right now and we need to
develop some consistency."
There were some positives out of the
Fresno State game as well, in addition to
augmenting the team's record with a win.
"I saw some good things," VanDerveer said.
"People hitting some big shots, sinking
some key free throws. I saw a team without
any doubts about who was going to win
the game."
Besides the confidence and talent, this
year's team is very motivated towards
playng well. "I think we've got a long way
to go," Steding said, "but we're working
hard. I think the attitude on this team is
a lot beter than in the past."
"I think we are dealing with a great
group of ladies with great attitudes," Van-
Derveer said. "But the question is: How
much do we want to win? How hard do
we want to work? ... I think winning a
tournament like this would help a lot."

After dramatic off-season improvement, senior forward Evon Asforis has contributed
considerably to the Cardinal's fortunes this season. "I'm really pleased with Evon,
with the way she's playing," Coach Tara VanDerveer said.
