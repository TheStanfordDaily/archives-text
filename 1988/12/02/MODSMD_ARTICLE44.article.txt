Cardinal Bth in UNLV Invitational

Oklahoma State won the tour
nament with a three-round total
of 881, while Arizona State, the
only other Pacific 10 Conference
competitor in the tournament be
sides Stanford, finished second
with 889. The Cardinal's 54-hole
total was 906.
One constant for Stanford
Coach Wally Goodwin's team this
year has been the stellar play of
freshman Christian Cevaer. After
starting out slowly with an 80
Monday, he paced the Cardinal in
the final two rounds with 77 and
69 for a total of 226 for the tour

nament. Cevaer's final round
score was the best 18-hole score
by any golfer in the tournament.
Rounding out the Cardinal's
scoring were junior Don Christen
sen at 227 (75-76-76), junior Josh
Zander with 230 (76-80-74),

senior John Mahon with 232 (73-
80-79) and senior Brad Geer, who
carded 233 (75-83-75).
Goodwin was disappointed that
the team did not improve every
round, which must happen if
Stanford is to be competitive in

the Western region.
But the coach did carry away
a positive attitude from Nevada.
"It's great that we've come this
far in a year. Last year we
wouldn't have even done this
well," he commented.
