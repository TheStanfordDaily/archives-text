# Swordsmen go east
## 
### Doug Boeschen Staff writer 
After having little trouble in
defeating their early-season
West Coast opponents,. the
men's and women's fencing
teams are packing up their
blades and heading for tougher
competition on the East Coast.
The 4-0 women's team will
face Wellesley on Friday and
then join the undefeated men's
team for a tournament on Sat
urday against Vassar, Cornell,
Brandeis, and St. Johns. The
teams will then travel to
Cambridge, Mass. for duelings
with Harvard, MIT, and
Brown.
Although they have been un
challenged in their matches so
far this year, the Cardinal fenc
ers realize that the Eastern
teams will be tough. An older
traditional sport, fencing has
long been established on the
East Coast and is relatively
young here in the west. Against
Harvard the fencing promises
to be intense as the Cardinal
will be facing the oldest college
fencing team in the nation.
Men's coach Zoran Tulum is

especially excited about the
trip. Before coining to Stanford
Tulum was an assistant coach
at Harvard for two years.
"Their women's team will be
particularly strong," Tulum
said, adding that the Harvard
men have a powerful epee
team. He explains that the trip
will be fun for him because he
is looking forward to beating
many of his former students.
"I'm going over there because
I want to win," he stated con
fidently.
But the Yugoslavian-born
coach also has other objectives
in mind for the trip. Tulum
believes that it is important to
have fun and make friends. He
would also like to make a name
for Stanford fencing in the
East.
"When I was at Harvard we
beat Stanford easily. Now that
I'm here I want to turn that
around and show them what
we can do."
With an undefeated record,
a bunch of talented fencers, and
a positive attitude, it would
seem that Zoran Tulum is off
to a good start. As usual, Stan
ford is well-represented.
