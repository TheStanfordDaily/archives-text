# Men's swimming goes to Husker country
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Looking to exert early season
dominance, the men's swim team opens
regular season competition today
through Saturday in The Husker Invi
tational at Nebraska.
Coming off a third place finish at last
year's NCAA Championships, the dom
inant collegiate swimming squad of the
80's is hoping to once again establish
itself as the team to beat as it faces
four of the country's other top ten pro
grams in a three-day NCAA-style meet.
Defending champion Texas, UCLA,
Southern Methodist University and host
Nebraska will put the Cardinal to an
early-season test in every official col
legiate event, including the new 200-
yard relays (freestyle and medley).
Although the squad graduated two

national champions in the likes of Olym
pic backstroker Sean Murphy and Olym
pic bronze-medal butterflier Anthony
Mosse, Olympian and two-time NCAA
champion Jay Mortenson and national
champion John Witchel return, along
with six other All-Americas. In addition,
the squad is bolstered by what coach
Skip Kenney calls "potentially the best
ever freshman class at Stanford," a com
ment not to be taken too lightly con
sidering All-Everything Pablo Morales
and Jeff Kostoff entered the Farm dur
ing the same year.
The meet will not be a breeze by any
means, however. In addition to the
caliber of teams competing, a number
of squads, including Nebraska and
SMU, will most likely be tapered and
shaved for the competition in order to
give themselves an early-season speed
advantage. A number of squads also

have a training advantage, due to the
fact that classes started in early August
on the semester system. Not only did
the Cardinal not begin training until
September, it has a tradition of not
shaving and holding regular workouts
up until the Pacific-10 Conference
Championships in March.
"We're going to be a little tired and
it is going to be tough to swim fast but
we're looking to establish a good atti
tude," co-Captain Mortenson said.
"With some good racing thrown in it
will be a good weekend."
The Cardinal also competed in the
Great Husker Sprint-Off yesterday. The
meet, consisting of the same teams that
will compete for the next three days,
was a 10-event contest with no races
longer than 200 yards. Unlike regular
competition, each team could enter only
one swimmer.
