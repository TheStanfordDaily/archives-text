Bukowski, he edited the poetry journal Laugh
Litcran and Man the Humping Guns. He will sign
copies of his most recent book WHITMAN'S WILD

Bukowski, Allen Ginsberg. Lawrence Ferlinghetti,
John Wieners, James Broughton, Philip Lamantia,
Bob Kaufman, William Everson, Gregory Corso,
and Harlod Norse.

Nick Herbert, one of the leading researchers in the
field of quantum theory, as well as one of our finest
science writers, opens up the provocative,
fascinating, and imagination-expanding universe of
superluminal speed to the general reader. He does
this in his new book FASTER THAN LIGHT:
SUPERLUMINAL LOOPHOLES IN PHYSICS,
which he will sign at the Stanford Bookstore.
Herbert has a doctorate in physics from Stanford
University and has written on faster-than-light and
quantum theory for such journals as American
Journal of Physics and New Scientist.
