# Heated panel debates S. African sanctions
## 
### John Wagner Staff writer 
In a discussion which at one
point exploded into verbal foray,
participants last night on a three
member panel sharply disagreed
over the role morality and sanc
tions should play in U.S. foreign
policy toward South Africa.
Claiming to be "a loner in
academia," Hoover Senior Re
search Fellow Lewis Gann argued
in front of a 60-member audience
that, while economic sanctions
"are not without effect," they are
not a useful tool of foreign policy.
When U.S. companies pull out
of South Africa, Gann said, the
company is usually taken over by
white South Africans, making
conditions even worse for black
laborers. "Disinvestment doesn't
mean a factory is somehow cast

in the sea," he said.
Gann also argued that U.S.
policy-makers should not judge
South Africa by Western stand
ards of morality. Although South
Africa is now "a developed
capitalist" economy, Gann said, it
"is also an African country to be
judged by African standards (of
morality)."
Gann holds his B.A. and doc
torate from Oxford University
and has lived in Africa for many
years.
Jonathan Jansen, a black South
African graduate student in the
School of Education, strongly op
posed Gann's view. "We cannot
judge South Africa by African
standards because it does not
judge itself by African standards,"
he said. "It wants to be a so-called
Western democracy."
Jansen called the South African

government a "racial tyrant" and
said the system of government has
to be "destroyed."
The panel discussion was part
of "South Africa Awareness
Week," a series of programs spon
sored by Students for a Free
South Africa. Also included on the
panel was Political Science Prof.
David Abernethy.
The discussion hit its emotional
peak during Jansen's opening pre
sentation. A few minutes into his
speech, he described an earlier
point made by Gann as "dis
honest."
Gann immediately stood up,
slammed his hand on the table in
front of him, and yelled, "Would
you mind not insulting me per
sonally? ... I will not be called
dishonest. Is that absolutely
clear?!"

In the midst of the emotional
exchange that followed, Gann
threatened to leave the room. He
agreed to continue in the discus
sion only after panel moderator
Mike McFaul, a visiting scholar
from Oxford, assured him that
Jansen had attacked his ideas and
not his person.
Abernethy took the middle
ground in the discussion, arguing
that the United States should use
sanctions to "increase the costs"
to the South African government
of maintaining their "evil" polit
ical system.
At the same time, though, the
United States must be careful not
to proceed in a "self-righteous"
manner and should realize that
sanctions alone will not bring "the
temple of apartheid crumbling
down," Abernethy said.
