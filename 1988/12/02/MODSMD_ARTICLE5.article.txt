# Senate takes stands against TA cuts and the Bridge move
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate voted to oppose cuts
in teaching assistant funding and maintain
the Bridge's current amount of space at
their final meeting of the quarter last night.
Passing a bill submitted by the Student
Affairs Committee, the senate expressed op
position to TA budget cuts and concern
that these cuts would adversely affect both
the undergraduate and graduate experience
at Stanford.
TA funding has been cut in varying
degrees in the School of Humanities and
Sciences this year. Although this cut will
not reduce TAs' hourly salaries, it may
reduce TA hours, thereby decreasing their
take-home pay. It may also warrant replace
ment of TAs with graders or readers, who
are hired just to grade or read assignments
and exams and receive lower salaries than
TAs.
Senator Katherine Van Uum related the
events of a meeting between several mem
bers of the ASSU and Humanities and
Sciences Dean Ewart Thomas, when
Thomas justified cuts in TA funding.
Van Uum said the students were not
satisfied with Thomas' statement that
replacing TAs with graders and readers

would not hurt students.
Besides affecting undergraduates with
larger sections and less qualified graders,
the cuts may harm graduate students who
depend on TA salaries for support and may
find it difficult to tell professors if they
feel overburdened, graduate senator David
Fallek added.
The senate also passed a bill in favor of
allowing the Bridge to keep its current
amount of office space. According to senior
Chris Adamson, a counselor at the Bridge,
Student Organizational Services has asked
the Bridge to justify its use of space — the
first step on the road to losing the space
to another organization.
Stanford has not had any new student
office space since the Storke Publications
Building opened 30 years ago, Adamson
said. In its search for more space, SOS has
looked into cutting the Bridge's space by
eliminating the Bridge's three live-in coun
selors and using their living space for stu
dent office space, he said.
Live-in counseling at the Bridge is the
"only such 24-hour general peer counseling
center in the Bay Area," Adamson said.
So far this quarter, counselors at the
Bridge have handled over 50 counseling
requests, five suicide calls and 100-200
referrals for information and other services.
