# Vigil commemorates deaths in El Salvador
## 
### Caitlin Liu 
A circle of 13 people gathered
after sundown yesterday on the
lawn between Meyer and Green
libraries for the first candlelight
vigil at Stanford honoring four
American churchwomen who were
killed in El Salvador in 1980.
After singing "Amazing Grace,"
the somber circle listened as a
speaker briefly outlined the lives
of three nuns and one laywoman,
who were raped and killed. Sal
vadoran soldiers were implicated
in the crimes.
The four women — Maura
Clarke, Ita Ford, Jean Donovan
and Dorothy Kazel — were vol
unteers who gave up stable lives
in the United States to work with
poor villagers during El Sal
vador's civil war, the speaker said.
The idea for the vigil was in
troduced to Stanford by the
speaker, Ann Neelon, a Stegner
Fellow in creative writing.
"I had been involved with a vigil
on a larger scale back in Boston,"
Neelon said before the vigil. "It's
done in many places in this coun
try; a lot of peace and justice
groups hold annual vigils honoring
these women."
Last night's vigil, sponsored by
the Stanford Central American
Action Network, was held on the
eve of the eighth anniversary of
the women's murders.
The candles were lit after
Neelon finished speaking. As each
candle was passed to ignite an
other, the holder of the candle
spoke aloud the name of a person
who inspired him or her. In an
emotional moment, the names of
Maura Clarke, Steven Biko and
Martin Luther King Jr. were in
voked as the flames lit up one by
one around the circle.

The somber circle lis
tened as a speaker
briefly outlined the
lives of three nuns
and one laywoman,
who were raped.

After the pronouncement of
each name, the rest of the group
repeated "Presente," indicating
solidarity with those who were
voices for those who could not
otherwise be heard.
At the vigil's conclusion, Neelon
asked if any of the participants
had thoughts to share with the
rest of the group.
One student spoke up after
some silence. "We're taking this
occasion to remember the martyrs
who were Americans," he said. "I
hope we also remember the Sal
vadoran victims of injustice."
Some participants also hope the
act will illuminate the problems
of U.S. intervention in El Salvador
and other Latin American coun
tries. Ann Marie Benders, a mem
ber of SCAAN, pointed out that
the United States spent $437 mil
lion to support the Salvadoran
government in 1986. This is the
same government whose military
was responsible for the murder
of these U.S. citizens, she said.
"It's Americans who died and
that's significant because it's our
tax dollars that support this," said
Benjamin Robinson, another
SCAAN member.
Said Bender: "I don't feel that
U.S. aid to El Salvador is address
ing the problems of civil war. It's
just perpetuating the violence of
that country."
