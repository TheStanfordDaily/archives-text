### Baldwin Leo Staff writer 
Although the University is still wrestling
with developing an anonymous AlDS
testing policy, Stanford this week released
guidelines addressing the treatment of
AIDS issues in the community, according
to Paul Walters, director of Cowell Student
Health Center.
Walters, who was head of the committee
established by Student Affairs to develop

at the root of the problem," he added.
Without an anonymous-testing policy,
students might not realize that their testing
records at Cowell could be released, accord
ing to Sternbergh.
The guidelines also recommend educat
ing the Stanford community on AIDS is
sues. Specifically, they targeted Residential
Education staff and athletic administra
tors, coaches and trainers.
