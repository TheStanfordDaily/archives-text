# Other departments face appointment difficulties
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Senior staff writer 
One of the main accusations to
emerge from the crisis at the arms
control center is that Stanford
lacks a mechanism for appointing
professors in interdisciplinary
programs and thus has trouble
making progress in important
fields of this kind.
That was the charge of Ted Pos
tol, a senior research associate at
the Center for International Se
curity and Arms Control, who said
the fault caused Prof. Sidney Drell
to resign his position as co
director of the center.
A survey of three interdiscipli
nary programs reveals that the
problem is not unique to the arms
control center, but has been dealt
with satisfactorily in two in
stances: the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center and the Food
Research Institute.
Currently all professorial ap
pointments at Stanford must be
made within a specific University
department. However, a single ex
ception to this rule is SLAC,
which, though not a department
in any school of the University,
has slots for its own professors.
The slots are known as "billets"
in University parlance.
According to Eileen Brennan,
the SLAC administrative assistant
for faculty appointments, SLAC
follows the same guidelines as
University departments in its
professorial appointment proce
dure. Drell himself is a member
of the Academic Council, a full
professor at SLAC, without being
associated with a department.
The president and provost allo
cate billets to SLAC, and faculty
are then recruited following the
standard national searching pro
cedure, Brennan said.
Although SLAC faculty are
treated the same as regular Uni
versity professors, the unique fea
ture of a SLAC professorship is
that professors are not required
to teach — but may if they want.
Consequently, tenure decisions
are based solely on research and
qualifications, not on teaching.
This exception, which has been
the case since SLAC opened in
1967, is due to the unique nature
of SLAC, Brennan said. "To fulfill

SLAC's goals, a professor is better
utilized doing research than
teaching," she said.
The Food Research Institute,
another interdisciplinary Stan
ford institution, also has its own
billets for professors, but it got
them through a route slightly dif
ferent from SLAC. The institute
was incorporated as a regular de
partment in the School of Human
ities and Sciences in 1976.
According to Susan Maher, the
department administrator, the In
stitute formed in 1921 as an au
tonomous institution reporting
directly to the president.
Even after introducing its grad
uate degree program in the mid
-19505, the institute still retained
autonomy in recruiting and re
taining faculty, although these
faculty were not professors.
When it became an official de
partment in 1976, the institute
adopted the same procedures for
appointment and recruitment as
any University department and
now has 14 available billets.
However, the fact that the in
stitute has no undergraduate
degree program — though it does
teach undergraduates — means
that its faculty have a lighter
teaching load than most other fac
ulty and can devote more time to
research, Maher said.
Among Stanford's other depart
ments, there are a number of in
terdisciplinary programs that
award undergraduate degrees. Yet
these programs draw faculty from
related departments and don't
have their own professors.
The distinction is a "real obsta
cle" for the interdisciplinary
African and Afro-American
Studies Program, according to
program Chair Kennell Jackson.
According to Jackson, an asso
ciate professor of history, a pos
sible solution for a program
unable to appoint its own profes
sors is to provide joint appoint
ments with other departments.
That is done in a few instances.
Jackson said he would be will
ing to settle for joint appointments
because it would tremendously
help the program. But he said he
is skeptical that the University
will allow even joint appointments.
Universities like Harvard,
Princeton and Yale all have joint
appointments in Afro-American
studies and are thus able to "build
themselves up" in that area, Jack
son said.
This issue, the lack of profes
sorships in interdisciplinary pro
grams, was Drell's reason for
resigning. The arms control cen

ter's demand is not necessarily
for an appointment power similar
to SLAC's, but for a mechanism
to bestow a professorship on a
person doing interdisciplinary
work.
Professors for the arms control
center would not have to be spe
cifically appointed there but could
be appointed under the Institute
for International Studies, a goal
Drell hoped would be accom
plished when lIS opened in Sep
tember, Postol said.

ments with other departments.
That is done in a few instances.
Jackson said he would be will
ing to settle for joint appointments
because it would tremendously
help the program. But he said he
is skeptical that the University
will allow even joint appointments.
Universities like Harvard,
Princeton and Yale all have joint
appointments in Afro-American
studies and are thus able to "build
themselves up" in that area, Jack
son said.
This issue, the lack of profes
sorships in interdisciplinary pro
grams, was Drell's reason for
resigning. The arms control cen

ter's demand is not necessarily
for an appointment power similar
to SLAC's, but for a mechanism
to bestow a professorship on a
person doing interdisciplinary
work.
Professors for the arms control
center would not have to be spe
cifically appointed there but could
be appointed under the Institute
for International Studies, a goal
Drell hoped would be accom
plished when lIS opened in Sep
tember, Postol said.
One of the main accusations to
emerge from the crisis at the arms
control center is that Stanford
lacks a mechanism for appointing
professors in interdisciplinary
programs and thus has trouble
making progress in important
fields of this kind.
That was the charge of Ted Pos
tol, a senior research associate at
the Center for International Se
curity and Arms Control, who said
the fault caused Prof. Sidney Drell
to resign his position as co
director of the center.
A survey of three interdiscipli
nary programs reveals that the
problem is not unique to the arms
control center, but has been dealt
with satisfactorily in two in
stances: the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center and the Food
Research Institute.
Currently all professorial ap
pointments at Stanford must be
made within a specific University
department. However, a single ex
ception to this rule is SLAC,
which, though not a department
in any school of the University,
has slots for its own professors.
The slots are known as "billets"
in University parlance.
According to Eileen Brennan,
the SLAC administrative assistant
for faculty appointments, SLAC
follows the same guidelines as
University departments in its
professorial appointment proce
dure. Drell himself is a member
of the Academic Council, a full
professor at SLAC, without being
associated with a department.
The president and provost allo
cate billets to SLAC, and faculty
are then recruited following the
standard national searching pro
cedure, Brennan said.
Although SLAC faculty are
treated the same as regular Uni
versity professors, the unique fea
ture of a SLAC professorship is
that professors are not required
to teach — but may if they want.
Consequently, tenure decisions
are based solely on research and
qualifications, not on teaching.
This exception, which has been
the case since SLAC opened in
1967, is due to the unique nature
of SLAC, Brennan said. "To fulfill

SLAC's goals, a professor is better
utilized doing research than
teaching," she said.
The Food Research Institute,
another interdisciplinary Stan
ford institution, also has its own
billets for professors, but it got
them through a route slightly dif
ferent from SLAC. The institute
was incorporated as a regular de
partment in the School of Human
ities and Sciences in 1976.
According to Susan Maher, the
department administrator, the In
stitute formed in 1921 as an au
tonomous institution reporting
directly to the president.
Even after introducing its grad
uate degree program in the mid
-19505, the institute still retained
autonomy in recruiting and re
taining faculty, although these
faculty were not professors.
When it became an official de
partment in 1976, the institute
adopted the same procedures for
appointment and recruitment as
any University department and
now has 14 available billets.
However, the fact that the in
stitute has no undergraduate
degree program — though it does
teach undergraduates — means
that its faculty have a lighter
teaching load than most other fac
ulty and can devote more time to
research, Maher said.
Among Stanford's other depart
ments, there are a number of in
terdisciplinary programs that
award undergraduate degrees. Yet
these programs draw faculty from
related departments and don't
have their own professors.
The distinction is a "real obsta
cle" for the interdisciplinary
African and Afro-American
Studies Program, according to
program Chair Kennell Jackson.
According to Jackson, an asso
ciate professor of history, a pos
sible solution for a program
unable to appoint its own profes
sors is to provide joint appoint
ments with other departments.
That is done in a few instances.
Jackson said he would be will
ing to settle for joint appointments
because it would tremendously
help the program. But he said he
is skeptical that the University
will allow even joint appointments.
