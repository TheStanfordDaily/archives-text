In an effort to send the football program in
the same upwardly mobile direction as most of
Stanford's other varsity sports. Athletic
Director Andy Geiger said he felt a "new
direction" was necessary.
Stating, "I believe it is in the best interest of
Stanford football to take a new direction,"
Geiger announced the firing of football Coach
Jack Elway yesterday.
Elway headed the program the past five
years compiling a 25-29-2 record. He began to
come under fire this season, however, as a
talented Cardinal squad suffered many narrow
defeats en route to a 3-6-2 mark.
"This extremely difficult decision came
after a very careful evaluation and review of
every aspect of our football program," Geiger
said. "Jack Elway has given a great deal to
Stanford and Stanford football and I'm grateful
for his many contributions.
"The search for his successor will begin
immediately," he added.
While no list of candidates has been
announced, the early inside track belongs to
Texas-El Paso Coach Bob Stull. Under Stull's
leadership, the Miners compiled a 10-2 mark
and arc headed for the Independence Bowl.
Stull is also the leading candidate for the
Missouri job. He has not announced a decision
about that position.
Other candidates include: Earl Bruce, die
former Ohio State coach who is currently at
Northern lowa, and Dennis Erickson, who
turned around the Washington State program
and was named Pacific 10 Conference co-
Coach of the Year.
Elway has earned praise for his recruiting.
At the time of his hiring he commented diat
coaching was 80 percent recruiting and 20
percent coaching.
Unfortunately, it was in the 20 perccnt
where Elway came up short this season.
Stanford was in a position to win 10 games this

year — all but the Notre Dame contest — but
came up with only three wins.
The Cardinal's inability to score from near
the goal line cost the team several chances for
victories. Against Washington on Oct. 29, for
example, Stanford reached the Husky 10, 8, 5
and 3 yard lines on four separate drives and

came away with only three field goals and an
unsuccessful fourth and two play.
Washington won that game, 28-25.
Elway was also head coach at San Jose
State for five years and at Cal State Norlhridge
for three years. His combined carecr record is
80 58-4.
