You don't need your patent money
Id buy a Macintosh.
Just their signature.
It's never been difficult for students to con
vince their parents of the need for a Macintosh*
computer at school.
Persuading them to write the check, however,
is another thing altogether.
Which is why Apple created the Student Loan
to Own Program. An ingenious loan program
that makes buying a Macintosh as easy as using
one.
Simply pick up an application at the location
listed below, or call 800 831 LOAN. All
your parents need to do is fill it out,
sign it, and send it. If they qualify, they'll receive
a check for you in just a few weeks.
There's no collateral. No need to prove finan
rial hardship. No application fee.
Best of all, the loan payments can be spread
over as manv as 10 vears.
/
Which gives you and your parents plenty of
time to decide just who pays for it all.
