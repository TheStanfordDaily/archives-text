Ifyouwantto
make Santa Cruz
inunder 2 hours,
without hassles,
you need abetter
set of wheels.
The CalTrain Peninsula
Commuter and new Santa Cruz Con
nector, to be exact.
Two high-performance on
and off-road vehicles with one great
built-in luxury: you don't have
to drive!
And with 9 round trips daily—
8 on holidays and weekends—there's
a train-bus combination for every
schedule. One every other hour.
Just hop a southbound
CalTrain anywhere on the Penin
sula. Then, when you arrive in San
Jose, there'll be a special dedicated
Santa Cruz Connector waiting to
pick you up at the station and wisk
you off to the Santa Cruz Metro
Center — just a few blocks from
the beach!
For a lot less than the price
of a full tank of gas. And that's
important if you'd rather spend your
cash at the Boardwalk instead of
getting there.
So if you'd like to get to Santa
Cruz without a car breakdown (or
a nervous breakdown!), get on the
phone and call CalTVain for more
information: 1-800-558-8661.
