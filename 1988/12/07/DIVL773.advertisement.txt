Since the invention of th integrated circuit 30 years ago, microelectronic
chips have grown in capability until they are pervasive in our society
today. How has this happened? Are we looking at the past 30 years as only
the beginning? What limits will we eventually reach that may slow down
or stop the movement? What kinds of technical capabilities will we have by
the turn of the century? in a JARGON-FREE talk, Professor Plummer will
discuss the prospects of continuing the microelectronics revolution over
the next 30 years.
