The Smith Corona Correcting Cassette.
We've reformed the
correction system.
Prisoners of old-fashioned
correction systems, freedom is
here.
Smith Corona's Correcting
Cassette means an end to
twists, tangles and fumbles.
It's an easy-to-load, drop-in
correction tape you can insert in
mere seconds.
There are no spools to
unwind. No complicated thread
ing. No more muttering under
your breath. Its that simple.
What's just as simple is
our Right Ribbon System." It
simply prevents you from
using the wrong combination
of ribbon and correcting
cassette.
You'll find our Correcting
Cassette and Right Ribbon
System on the Smith Corona
SL 600 typewriter.
You'll also find lots of other
great features on the SL 600-
like the Spell-Right " 1 50,000
word electronic dictionary, full
line correction. W<)rdEraser'
and more.
You might expect a type
writer this sophisticated to cost
a bundle, but the SL 600 is
surprisingly affordable.
All of which makes it
one of the best values
you can find today.
Case closed.
