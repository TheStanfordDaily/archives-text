Hey sports fans!
Did you see the leaflets on the seats at the
Apple Invitational? They looked like this:
Dear Stanford Student,
Year One: Standing and Yelling.
Year Two: Standing and Intimidating.
Make Maples a place they hate to visit.
Thanks,
Mike Montgomery
Men's basketball coach
Those rocket scientists at the NCAA office sched
uled the Arizona game for Jan. 5. If you are going
to be out of town during winter break, leave your
student season ticket with someone who can be at
the game!
