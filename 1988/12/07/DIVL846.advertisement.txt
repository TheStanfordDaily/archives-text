/t is a rainy Sunday afternoon, you are at the
library, you arc watching a little boy with a book
in his lap who is staring out the window, day
dreaming. a look of concentration on his face so
intense that he might be counting raindrops one
by one.
uddenly you recall yourself, one
rainy day when you were ten, and
you had just finished the most
enchanting book, and you were sad and lonely
because the story, which deserved to go on forever,
was now over. And you were staring out the window,
and somehow, as if they had found themselves in the
dance of the rain itself, the storybook characters
re-invented themselves, returned to you, continued
speaking and laughing and car
rying on, and it was then that
you discovered what your mind,
alone, could do, and where your
true self really was.
J, his is what imagination
is for: to outnumber the
possibilities, connect the
here and now with the where
and whenever, to call time out
on Time and make way for sen
sibility. whim, and vision. Close
your eyes and you may find it is
not so bad to be alone, there, in
the dimension of imagination,
where space and time are yours
to make of what you wish.
W' atch people reading something they really
like. Watch that look on their faces, as if
they were lost but had just found their way
