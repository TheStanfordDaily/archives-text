# Bush selects Boskin for top economic post
## 
### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
After months of rumor and speculation, Stanford
Economics Prof. Michael Boskin was appointed yes
terday to chair President-elect George Bush's chief
economic policy group, the Council of Economic
Advisers.
Boskin, a 43-year-old senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution and a self-described "mainstream con
servative," advised Bush during his campaign and
was the primary architect of Bush's "flexible freeze"
proposal to reduce the federal deficit.
"I'm honored at the nomination and, if confirmed

by the Senate, I will do everything
I can to make sure the president
has the highest quality economic
advice possible for his decision
making," Boskin said in a prepared
statement yesterday.
"If confirmed, I will do everything
I can to make sure there is an or
derly transition to my duties in
Washington,"he said. Senate con
firmation hearings will be held in
late January at the earliest.

Boskin's Stanford colleagues see him as an ex
cellent choice for the job.
"Michael Boskin is an outstanding scholar and a
congenial colleague, and I wish him well," Senior
Hoover Fellow Alvin Rabushka said in an interview
before the appointment. Rabushka, who worked with
Boskin on a task force studying the future of the
California economy, said, "I have found him to be
reliable, responsible and extremely competent."
Economics Prof. Victor Fuchs agreed that Boskin
is "an excellent choice. He's an excellent economist
and very centrist in terms of political philosophy
â€” he's not an ideologue."
Fuchs also noted that Boskin's specialty, the
budget, especially needs attention in the new Bush
administration.
While calling the Boskin appointment "good for
the country and the administration," Fuchs said,
"We'll certainly miss him at Stanford."
In his 1987 book, "Reagan and the Economy: The
Successes, Failures and Unfinished Agenda," Boskin
expressed optimism that President Reagan's eco
nomic program, by changing the nation's agenda,
created an opportunity for improved long-term eco
nomic performance.
Boskin currently directs the Stanford Center for
Economic Policy Research. He has served as an
economics adviser and consultant to President
Reagan, the Treasury Department, the Senate
mtyority leader and members of both parties in
both houses of Congress.
