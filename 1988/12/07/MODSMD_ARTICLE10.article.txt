# Student coalition pushes changes
## Minority graduate student groups want commitment to proposals 
### John Wagner Staff writer 
Following a meeting with University
President Donald Kennedy Monday
morning, members of a coalition of mi
nority graduate student groups said they
were disappointed by Kennedy's "lack
of support and commitment" to recom
mendations the group issued Friday to
improve ethnic minority student life.
Initial implementation of the United
Graduate Student Association's various
proposals, which are presented in a 52-
page report, carries a price tag exceeding
$100,000. The proposals include:
• Increasing recruitment of minority
faculty and graduate students;
• Establishing a theme residence in
the just-opened Rains Complex for mi
nority graduate students; and
• Allocating $98,875 to minority grad
uate student groups to be used "to
mitigate further problems of isolation,
fragmentation and ignorance now
prevalent on Stanford's campus."
The graduate coalition represents 13
student groups of black, Chicano-Latino,
Native-American and Asian-American
backgrounds. The group's report is the
first broad review of minority issues by
graduate student groups during a period
that has been dominated by the de
mands of undergraduate minority stu
dent organizations.
Kennedy told The Daily Monday af
ternoon that although he thought the
meeting with members from the coali
tion had been productive, he was "not
surprised that they had a different
view."

Any formal commitments to the rec
ommendations would have been impos
sible due to time constraints, Kennedy
said. He said the lengthy report was
not handed to him until Friday after
noon, "just one working day" before his
meeting with the coalition's members.
"I wasn't prepared to respond," Ken
nedy said, adding that a fuller discus
sion will take place when he meets with
the coalition in mid-January.
Kennedy said he would also prefer to
wait to act on the group's recommen
dations until after the release of the
long-awaited report by the University
Committee on Minority Issues. The
UCMI report, which should be submit
ted to Kennedy at the beginning of next
month, is expected to contain specific
policy recommendations to improve mi
nority life on campus.
Because members of the group as
sured him that many of their recom
mendations would be "congruent" with
those of the UCMI report, Kennedy said
he thought a formal response to their
recommendations would be inappropri
ate prior to the release of the UCMI
report.
"We, of course, respect [Kennedy's]
need for more time, but [the delay] is
disappointing to us," said coalition
member Cheryl Kettell at a press con
ference following the meeting with Ken
nedy.
Coalition members said they were also
disappointed by the emphasis Kennedy
placed on the "financial burden" that
would be created by implementation of
their proposals.
"He said throughout the meeting that

(because) the University faces an $11
million deficit... we should temper our
expectations," said coalition member
George Yeltatzie.
"The requests we have made are for
a lot of money, but they aren't for that
much money in relative terms," Yal
tatzie said. "Because the University has
not put much money into these areas
in the past, it's costing them more now."
Kennedy told The Daily that the Uni
versity budget deficit does in fact "make
everything harder."
In its report, the coalition requested
that the administration "institution
alize a minimum line-item budget clause
in its spending agenda specifically ear
marked for disbursement to the minor
ity graduate student groups."
These funds would be used by the
various minority graduate student
groups for general operating expenses,
cultural programming, community serv
ices programming, and recruitment and
retention programming.
"Recruitment and retention of minor
ity students doesn't just happen," coa
lition member Josie Saldana said. "It
does require investment and the Uni
versity has to start taking these steps."
" The institution of the housing option
"would provide greater opportunities for
personal interaction between minorities
and non-minority graduate students,"
the report says. The coalition would
like to see the institution of this housing
option for fall quarter of the 1989-90
academic year.
According to Kettell, the goal of the
coalition is to make Stanford "a more
attractive place for minority students."
