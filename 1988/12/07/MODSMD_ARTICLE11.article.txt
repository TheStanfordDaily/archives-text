## Gorbachev arrives in New York 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev got
his first look at New York on yes
terday during a 40-minute motor
cade ride through the city to the
privacy of the Soviet Mission to
the United Nations, a luxury
high-rise on the Upper East Side
of Manhattan.
If he carried a surprise propos
al, as some advisers hinted, Gor
bachev kept the secret to himself.
The Soviet leader, accompanied
by his closest foreign policy ad
visers, prepared to address the
United Nations today and to meet
with President Reagan and
President-elect George Bush.
Soviet officials were close
mouthed about details of Gorba
chev's schedule but hinted he was
bringing some surprises on his
second visit to the United States,
which comes almost a year to the
day after the summit meeting in
Washington at which he and
Reagan signed a treaty to elimi
nate a class of nuclear weapons.
The Soviet leader, accompanied
by his wife, Raisa, and key ad
visers, arrived at John F. Kennedy
International Airport and stepped
from his special Aeroflot Ilyushin
jet precisely on schedule at 3 p.m.
after a direct flight from Moscow.
In brief remarks at the airport,
Gorbachev said the Soviet Union
"intends to broaden and expand
its cooperation within the United
Nations framework with all the
states that make up the United
Nations."
"We are living in a world that
is going through some very crucial
changes, and we all — all nations
— have their own concerns, their

own interests. We shall be sharing
our interests in analyzing and
thinking over the current situa
tion," he said.
On the topic of the meeting
with Reagan and Bush, the Soviet
leader said, "We have not ar
ranged any formal agenda, so
either side will be free openly and
frankly to raise any questions that
it wishes to."
The American side, however,
has shown no inclination to try
to negotiate any complex new
agreements as Reagan moves off
the world stage and Bush
prepares to take over.

Gorbachev nonetheless brought
along his top foreign policy ad
visers, including Alexander
Yakovlev, a former ambassador to
Canada and member of the Com
munist Party's ruling Politburo
who recently took charge of the
international affairs portfolio in
the party Central Committee.
Yakovlev is among those closest
to Gorbachev and is regarded as
an architect of his plan to reall
ocate Soviet resources from de
fense and foreign aid to improving
domestic life.
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze also accompanied

the president to New York, as did
Anatoly Dobrynin, the longtime
Soviet ambassador to the United
States who recently retired from
his Central Committee post but
remains a Gorbachev adviser.
Gorbachev predicted his meet
ings in New York "will doubtless
promote greater dialogue and an
expansion of cooperation between
our two countries."
One official told reporters at a
U.N. news conference that Gor
bachev wants "to take as many
bites as possible out of the Big
Apple."
