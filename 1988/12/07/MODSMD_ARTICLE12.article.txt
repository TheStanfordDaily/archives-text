# Bush fills five top Cabinet positions
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
President-elect George Bush, once
more calling on friends and gov
ernment veterans to fill key posi
tions, yesterday selected Texas oil
man Robert Mosbacher to be com
merce secretary, named Washing
ton lawyer Carla Hills as trade
representative and said he would
keep William Webster as CIA di
rector.
Bush also named Thomas Pick
ering, a career diplomat who is
currently U.S. ambassador to Is
rael, as U.N. ambassador, but said
he had decided that the post
would no longer carry Cabinet
level status.
The vice president, announcing
his latest choices at a news con
ference in the Old Executive Of
fice Building, said he was com
pleting his economic team with
the naming of Stanford economist
Michael Boskin as chairman of
the Council of Economic Advisers.
Bush also told reporters he had
decided to "take the offensive" on
coming up with a budget strategy
that attacks with federal deficit
without new taxes. "It is my re
sponsibility to do that. What that
means in terms of form, I am not
quite sure yet," he said.
On the subject of today's meet
ing in New York with Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Bush
continued to stress that he was
going to the meeting "as vice pres
ident" but indicated that he
planned to engage in a careful
review of U.S.-Soviet relations
once he takes office on Jan. 20.
"I'm confident they (the
Soviets) know our system well
enough to know that it is only
prudent to review national secu
rity policy, and to review our re

lationship with them," he said.
"Stay tuned, we're only about
halfway through this act," Bush
said as he headed off stage. The
five announcements were the first
in a week; no more are expected
until after Bush's meeting with
Gorbachev.
Hills, 54, who was secretary of
housing and urban development
in 1975-77 under President Ford,
is the first woman Bush has des
ignated for a high-level position
in his administration.
Although the trade post was not
originally a Cabinet-level job,
Reagan elevated it to such. Hills
told reporters that Bush had
agreed to retain the post as a
Cabinet position in his adminis
tration.
Mosbacher, 61, is an old friend
from Bush's oil days in Houston
in the 19605. Bush said that Mos
bacher would bring "tremendous
energies to promoting exports
abroad" in the post.
Currently the chairman of the
Mosbacher Energy Co. of Hous
ton, Mosbacher was finance chair
man of Bush's presidential cam
paign.
Sources said Bush had decided
to delay his announcement of a
defense secretary, widely expected
to be former Senate Armed Serv
ices Committee chairman John
Tower of Texas, until later in the
week.
Bush declined to add to specula
tion about that post, but voiced
"a great high regard for Sen.
Tower" when asked by a reporter
about recent news reports con
cerning the Texan's personal life.
Bush said his decision to keep
Webster on as CIA chief was "open
ended."
