# Space Shuttle Atlantis arrives home after successful mission

### 
EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE,
Calif. (AP) â€” Atlantis streaked
out of orbit from its secret spy
satellite mission yesterday and
glided to an unusual 1 afternoon
landing as a small band of spec
tators cheered the five astronauts'
safe return.
"They have been given the wel
come back call," said Billie Deason
at Mission Control in Houston
after the spaceship had rolled to
a halt on the 7.5-mile-long run
way.
Two loud sonic booms crackled
overhead as Atlantis descended

through partly sunny skies and
made its swooping approach to
Rogers Dry Lake in the Mojave
Desert.
One tire on the shuttle's left
landing gear had a slow leak, but
NASA said it was not a concern.
It certainly did not seem to affect
the smoothness of the touchdown,
which was televised live by the
networks.
About 55 minutes after landing,
the crew emerged from the orbiter
and were greeted by NASA ad
ministrators, and then inspected
the underside of the craft.

"Dings" could be seen in the black
protective tiles," Deason said.
It was only the seventh after
noon shuttle landing, the time ap
parently dictated by tho orbit At
lantis had to follow in deploying
a radar satellite to spy on the
Soviet Union. NASA prefers
morning landings at Edwards be
cause winds tend to gather force
later in the day.
Because of the military secrecy,
yesterday's landing was closed to
public viewing from the observa
tion site on this military base 80
miles north of Los Angeles. Only

a few hundred journalists, NASA
employees and invited guests were
witnesses.
Scattered applause echoed
across the hardpan in front of
NASA's main hangar as Atlantis
rolled across the dry lakebed. The
National Anthem blared from a
loudspeaker.
In contrast, an estimated
425,000 people had watched Dis
covery return Oct. 3 from the
flight that put Americans back in
space for the first time since the
Challenger tragedy.
Deason said all systems per

formed normally during landing
and rollout. Tests of the new nose
wheel steering system and brakes
proved suctessfbf, 'she said.' Pre
vious shuttles experienced brake
problems and before Challenger,
shuttles were steered during land
ing by applying brake pressure on
one side of the orbiter or the
other.
Although NASA and the Air
Force permitted live television
coverage of the landing, as they
did for Friday's launch from Cape
Canaveral, Fla., everything in be
tween was blacked out.
