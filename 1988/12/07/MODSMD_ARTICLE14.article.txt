# Estonia exercises its sovereignty

TALLINN, U.S.S.R. (AP) â€” The parliament
of the tiny Baltic republic of Estonia exercised
its newly declared sovereignty for the first time
yesterday by banning further industrial develop
ment in an ecologically devastated area.
The action puts Estonia, with a population of
1.6 million people, on a collision course with
Moscow ministries.
Estonia's Supreme Soviet, or parliament,
declared sovereignty Nov. 16 over all its internal
affairs. The Presidium, or executive council of
the national parliament, promptly deemed the
action illegal, but the Estonians have refused to
abide by that order, saying their own constitu
tional amendments take precedence over
Presidium decrees.
An Estonian constitutional amendment gave
the republic's parliament the power to veto Soviet
laws, but Estonian officials have used the mea
sure cautiously.
Yesterday, they postponed plans to override
two controversial nationwide decrees limiting

demonstrations and dissent, deciding to ignore
the decrees and instead to enforce only a more
liberal Estonian law on the same subject passed
in January.
The parliamentary decision to crack down on
pollution was a response to public anger over
the worst of the Moscow ministries' excesses.
"Life lately has shown the ministries don't
have the desire to go to court over matters of
environmental protection," Estonian Prime Min
ister Indrek Toome said in explaining why Es
tonia's government was stepping in.
Supreme Soviet deputy Endel Lippmaa said
the new environmental protection law could not
have been passed without the powers contained
in the Nov. 16 Estonian constitutional amend
ment.
The law bans expansion of mining or other
polluting industries in northeastern Estonia,
which has suffered environmental damage from
mining and pollution from power plants, said
Lippmaa and fellow representative Juhan Aare.
