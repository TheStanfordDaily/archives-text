# Argentina quells military unrest

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina
(AP) â€” President Raul Alfonsin
said yesterday only "a fool could
ignore" the simmering unrest in
the military, and he said he made
no deals to end a four-day insur
rection.
The last military installation
taken over by the rebels, an in
fantry regiment 60 miles west of
the capital, was to be turned back
to the government yesterday.
Rebel leader Col. Mohamed Ali
Seineldin surrendered Sunday,
ending the third military insur
rection in 20 months. It was the
worst threat to Alfonsin's civilian
government since it replaced a
military dictatorship in 1983.
Seineldin was released to direct
the dismantling of his Villa Mar
telli arsenal Monday before for
mally relinquishing command. He
was taken to a military garrison
in Buenos Aires for questioning.
Most of the estimated 500
rebels returned to their units, and
"an investigation will take place
to clear up who is responsible,
and they will be punished," said

Defense Ministry spokesman
Faustino Altamirano.
The unrest began Thursday
when 63 coast guardsmen robbed
an arsenal and deserted their
base. They were imprisoned yes
terday at the suburban Campo de
Mayo army base for questioning.
There was widespread support
for Seineldin or attempts to incite
troops at other bases.
Alfonsin has said since Sunday
the insurrection was resolved by
negotiation, but contended the
government did not concede to
any rebel demands.
Only "a fool could ignore" the
fact that military unrest contin
ues, but "the bulk of Argentina's
armed forces" believes in democ
racy, he said, attributing the in
surrection to a "Messianic" mi
nority.
Rebels demanded an end to the
prosecution of officers for human
rights abuses committed during
the 1976-83 dictatorship,
wholesale changes in the military
hierarchy, and better pay and
equipment.

"The convincing and persuad
ing took so long precisely because
no condition was accepted," Al
fonsin told leaders of a farm co
operative. "A dialogue of more
than two hours (is better than) a
battle, even if it lasted just five
minutes, which could have cost
Argentine lives."
Alfonsin denounced critics who
have wondered aloud whether a
secret deal was made. He called
them "vampires .. . who appar
ently feel sad because solutions
were arrived at without the spill
ing of blood."
Doubts stemmed from the un
willingness of government troops
to fire on the rebels, the failure
to disarm and arrest rebels fol
lowing their surrender Sunday,
and the maintenance of army
bases in rebel hands after the gov
ernment declared the mutiny over.
Defense Minister Horacio
Jaunarena Wednesday was to
brief the Senate, where opposition
Peronist Party members ex
pressed doubts on how the insur
rection was resolved.
