# Reagan to hold news conference
## Tomorrow's prime-time exchange may be his last in office 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Reagan will hold a prime time
news conference tomorrow, likely
the last such formal question-and
answer exchange before he leaves
office Jan. 20.
"Be nice. It's his last one," first
lady Nancy Reagan told reporters
yesterday after she accepted the
official White House Christmas
tree.
Chief presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater, asked whether
it would be Reagan's last news
conference, said, "Well, this is the
December press conference, and
you just never know after that."
The session, to be held in the

East Room of the White House,
will be Reagan's fifth formal news
conference this year and 46th of
his nearly 8-year-old presidency.
Two of Reagan's previous four
news conferences this year were
held out of the country — one at
the conclusion of his summit with
Soviet President Mikhail Gorba
chev in Moscow on June 1, and
another, just 20 days later at the
end of the seven-nation economic
summit in Toronto.
The session will come a day
after Reagan's meeting in New
York with Gorbachev. Besides dis
cussing East-West relations,
Reagan likely will be asked to

state his views on the pending
trial of former aide Oliver North,
a key defendant in the Iran-
Contra case. He also will surely
be asked about his personal
feelings as his two-term adminis
tration draws to a close.
By historical standards, Reagan
has held relatively few formal
question-and-answer sessions
with news reporters, and this was
criticized recently by a Harvard
commission of scholars and jour
nalists.
The Harvard report said White
House news conferences have fal
len into "a serious state of disar
ray" under Reagan.
