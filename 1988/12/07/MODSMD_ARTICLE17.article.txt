Jim Bakker indicted for fraud
PI NEVILLE, N.C. (AP) — Defrocked evangelist
Jim Bakker is "wholly comfortable with the
honorable character of the way Heritage USA
was operated under his leadership" and will plead
innocent to fraud charges, his attorney said yes
terday.
A federal grand jury on Monday indicted Bak
ker, founder of the PTL ministries, and former
aide Richard Dortch on charges of diverting more
than $4 million in PTL money to their own use.
Each was charged with eight counts of mail fraud,
15 counts of wire fraud, and one count of con
spiracy to commit wire and mail fraud.
A second 11-count indictment charged David
Taggart, Bakker's former personal aide, and Tag
gart's brother, James, with evading nearly
$500,000 in income taxes and diverting about
$1.1 million of PTL funds for personal expenses.
Bakker's wife, Tammy, was not indicted.
Although Bakker himself remained silent yes
terday on the charges, his attorney, Jim Toms,
said the former TV evangelist planned to preach
Sunday at his new church in a converted roller
rink.
Toms said his client would plead innocent to
all of the charges in the 24-count indictment.
The indictment said Bakker, 48, and Dortch, 57,
engaged in a conspiracy designed to "create and
continue lavish and extravagant lifestyles" by
defrauding supporters who bought lifetime
partnerships at PTL's Heritage USA complex.

The maximum penalty for each count is five
years in prison and a $250,000 fine, which means
Bakker faces a possible sentence of 120 years in
prison and $6 million in fines. Bakker and the
other defendants are scheduled to appear in court
Dec. 15.
Three killed, 6 hurt in Azerbaijan
MOSCOW (AP) — The Kremlin lashed out
again yesterday at officials in the republics of
Armenia and Azerbaijan for their handling of an
ethnic dispute in which at least three more people
have been killed and six others injured.
The Communist Party's Central Committee
and Council of Ministers, or Cabinet, passed a
resolution saying local officials were partly re
sponsible for a mass exodus and eviction of Ar
menians and Azerba\janis from their homes.
More than 180,000 people have crossed the
border of the two southern republics, and the
resolution said "extremist groups" were not the
only ones to blame.
"These actions are taking place with the con
nivance and frequently with the direct involve
ment of individual local party, government and
economic officials," the official news agency Tass
quoted the resolution as saying.
The evening news program "Vremya" vesterday
showed refugees arriving with truckloads of their
belongings in Azerbaijan, and a train arriving in
the Armenian capital of Yerevan with other ref
ugees.
