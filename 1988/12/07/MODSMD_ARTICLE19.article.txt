University should offer
arms center researchers
some sense of security

THE CENTER for Interna
tional Security and Arms
Control fills a vacuum for
both academia and the govern
ment. Since 1970, the center has
proven to be a much needed and
respected resource nationwide.
Although the center focuses pre
dominantly on research and does
not give out degrees, it contributes
immensely to undergraduate and
graduate education here. Ap
proached constantly by the com
munity, researchers teach classes,
aid in theses and provide valuable
advice on various arms control is
sues.
Few other places in the country
host centers dealing strictly in arms
control. Stanford is extremely for
tunate to have one located here.
Yet, Stanford has been unable
to offer the researchers tenure at
the center, which they rightfully
deserve. As co-director until resign
ing last week, Sidney Drell has
tried for years to get the University
to allow him to appoint professors.
What Drell has been demanding
is not unprecedented. Similar to
the center, SLAC currently ap
points its own professors although
it deals strictly in research and
does not offer classes to the general
student body.
Nor is he asking for free rein to
appoint professors. The University
does not even have to offer the
researchers a "professorship." The
University could give the center
the ability to create parenthetical

positions, such as "profes
sor/research."
Drell's concern is not with
semantics and he has already
stated that he is quite liberal with
the choice of the final title. Drell's
goal, as should be the University's,
is to get the researchers to stay.
And it's now or never for the
University. Now a tenured profes
sor of International Relations at
USC, arms control expert Coit
Blacker left last spring because he
could not get the security he
wanted and needed. Fellow expert
and Senior Research Associate Ted
Postol seems to be headed to an
other university, and former
astronaut Sally Ride will make no
guarantees that she will return
after her grant ends this summer.
In addition, the Carnegie Corpo
ration refuses to give the center a
$500,000 grant, a third of the cen
ter's annual budget, until the fu
ture of the center's research
stabilizes. Postol, and especially
Drell, are such integral parts of
the center, that losing them really
means losing the heart of the cen
ter.
Understandably, changing the
center's policy could take up to one
year because the University must
go through several channels in
cluding the Faculty Senate. How
ever, the University should have
listened to Drell two years ago
when he started making his de
mands. There has been plenty of
time to take action.
The future of the entire center
rests in the University's hands,
and it is no longer wise for Stan
ford to withhold its desired course
of action. The University must
grant the center the right to tenure
some members now to ensure that
this invaluable resource does not
die.
