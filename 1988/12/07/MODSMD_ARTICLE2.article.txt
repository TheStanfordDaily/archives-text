# Alpha Delts lose house
## Residence will be included in this year's Draw 
### Malinda McCollum Staff writer 
The University announced yesterday
that the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity house
will be placed in the Draw this spring
because of the group's financial problems
and a chronic inability to fill its house.
Director of the Row Diana Conklin and
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano in
formed surprised Alpha Delt officers of the
decision at a meeting last Friday.
The fraternity's loss of housing because
of a recruiting failure is the first such
example at the University. Other fraterni
ties have lost housing because of discipli
nary problems, most recently the Delta
Upsilon fraternity in 1986.
In a statement of reaction, the Alpha
Delts said: "We do not like this decision.
We intend to explore all of our options for
successfully protesting this decision, and
we intend to emerge from this crisis as a
strong and united group."
According to Conklin, the Alpha Delts
have failed to pledge their share of the
fraternity quota three out of the last four
years, a violation of University rules. With
nine vacancies and 17 boarders out of 51
spots, the group faces a $22,000 debt in
rent to the University. This year is the
ninth out of the last 13 that the Alpha
Delts have been warned by the University
about not meeting their quota.
The quota violation is not uncommon.
Five other fraternities are in similar
predicaments: the Beta Theta Pi, Delta
Kappa Epsilon, Delta Tau Delta, Theta
Delta Chi and Theta Xi houses. However,
these fraternities will retain their houses
until at least next year, when they will be

re-evaluated, Pisano and Conklin said.
Conklin and Pisano said the Alpha Delts
were singled out for the Draw because
when the entire fraternity system fails to
meet the pledge quota, the fraternity with
the greatest share of the deficit risks losing
its house. The Alpha Delts had the largest
quota deficit, but the Betas are not far
behind, Conklin and Pisano said.
Another possible reason for the loss of
the house is the closure of Roble Hall last
year, which greatly burdened the under
graduate housing system, Conklin said.
Despite the appearance of problems for
several fraternities, Interfraternity Council
President Chris Erlin said the fraternity
system as a whole is not weak. The Alpha
Delts had problems, he said, because their
"bad reputation" of a few years ago dis
couraged people from committing to the
house.
The reputation Erlin alluded to was for
drug and academic problems in the house,
a reputation which Conklin and Pisano
said has been cleared up and was not a
factor in their decision.
The decision "was not motivated in any
sense as a disciplinary action," Pisano said.
Alpha Delt President Eric Gai protested
the decision in a meeting last night with
Pisano and Dean of Residential Education
Norm Robinson. "We were aware that our
position was in jeopardy, but we were not
aware that it was so urgent," Gai said
before the meeting, charging that the Uni
versity was not clear enough about the
criteria it used to make the decision.
