University should try
to attract more CIV
track proposals soon

Students did not struggle
for eight years to change the
Western Culture program
just to produce token modifications
in the program. Yet, sadly, it ap
pears that there is an acute danger
that that scenario will come to
pass.
Recent comments by members of
the Area One Committee indicate
that the committee feels hampered
in its ability to attract proposals
from faculty of color. Committee
Chair Paul Robinson has explained
that the few minority faculty at
Stanford are already overworked
and therefore reluctant to take on
teaching an entire new track.
To make matters worse, Gregson
Davis, one of the minority faculty
currently teaching an alternative
track, is leaving Stanford at the
end of the year to accept an ap
pointment at Cornell.
Another disturbing factor is the
concern raised by student members
of the committee that some of the
faculty do not actually support
changing the program. The student
groups that led the struggle were
acutely aware that the battle over
implementation was equally as cri
tical as the actual vote in the Fac
ulty Senate.
For that reason, they insisted on
language that guaranteed the pres
ence of people of color on the com
mittee. In a compromise move, the
language was modified to stress
that interest in the issues of people
of color should be a requirement
for membership on the committee.
If, in fact, there are members of
the committee who oppose the
whole concept of Cultures, Ideas
and Values, then the University

has been negligent in carrying out
the intent of the legislation, and
Provost James Rosse should im
mediately look into the issue.
It is the duty of the provost and
the committee to actively seek out
and solicit new proposals for the
program. The provost and depart
ment chairs should do all they can
to accomodate the schedules of fac
ulty of color and to provide the
necessary back-up in terms of
teaching assistants and other staff
support.
In addition, the University sim
ply must do more to attract faculty
of color. Clay Carson, associate pro
fessor of history, said, "Stanford
has to be serious about its com
mitment to bring women and racial
minorities onto the faculty."
As the resignation of Co-director
Sidney Drell from the Center for
International Security and Arms
Control shows, Stanford is doing a
poor job overall of expanding the
scope of the faculty. We cannot sim
ply proceed with business as usual
and expect there to be significant
changes. Only significant effort
will produce significant results.
It is not too late to make the
vision of multicultural education
at Stanford a reality. Over the
break, the provost, the Area One
Committee and all concerned fac
ulty should work to develop new
proposals that will expand the
horizons of the program. When the
committee reconvenes next year, it
should carefully scrutinize all exist
ing tracks and insist upon substan
tive changes.
This struggle for CIV was the
focus of national attention last
year, and people across the country
are anxiously awaiting the work of
the committee. Our program will
be a model for the higher education
community, and we must take that
responsibility seriously. Let's not
allow this opportunity to slip away
because of laziness and insufficient
effort.
