TIS THE SEASON to be jolly. .., or
so they say. The Christmas season
is upon us, but I always seem to
forget about it amidst the anxiety and
exhaustion of Dead Week and finals.
Christmas cards never get sent on time,
presents are bought at the last minute,
going to church is often neglected and
taking time out with my friends to tell
them I love them, the true meaning of
Christmas for me, seldom seems to hap
pen.
That is why it is nice for me, as a
Christian, to see Palo Alto decorated in
iwreaths and bows, to wander through
the Stanford Christmas Fair, and to dis
play a Christmas tree in my residence.
These things remind me that Christmas
is here and help put me in the Christmas
spirit.
But just because it is nice for me, it
doesn't mean these things should happen.
Every year resident fellows, resident
assistants and residents are faced with
the same issue: whether or not to have
a Christmas tree in the dorm. Most
people argue in favor of the tree, claiming
it is not a religious symbol and that it
simply inspires the spirit of giving and
receiving.
Others argue that regardless of the
tree's origins, it is a symbol of Christmas
and Christianity, and that many non-
Christians feel alienated by having such
a symbol in their residences. This second
argument is very valid and very impor
tant, and as a result, the Christmas tree
must go.
We live in a largely Christian society
where non-Christians face prejudice and

fear their religious existence is threat
ened. Non-Christian children grow up
being told by the media and the commu
nity that Christmas is more important
than their own religious traditions. Non-
Christian adults compete in a job market
that does not easily amend itself to their
religious needs.
This general attitude that teaches that
other religions are less significant than
Christianity is what can cause people to
feel alienated by public Christian sym
bols. They are not accepted by our Chris
tian society and these symbols serve to
reinforce that lack of acceptance. It is
only when this attitude is changed to one
of respecting all religious traditions
equally that public Christmas trees can
ornament our Stanford residences.
There has been much talk at Stanford
this quarter about multiculturalism and
diversity. We see ourselves as a unique
community where respect for other cul
tures can develop. Thus far, most dis
cussion has focused on racial harmony,
but it needs to be extended to religious
understanding as well.
A good place to begin this understand
ing would be with the Jewish community.
Stanford consistently begins fall quarter
at or around Yom Kippur, the Jewish
Day of Atonement, and as a result, Jews
at Stanford must often choose between
observing their religious holiday and
meeting their academic or professional
obligations.
This is ridiculous. The Jewish commu
nity at Stanford is important enough that
it should not have to make such a deci
sion, and this holiest day of the Jewish

year should be a University holiday. This
would be a first step away from our
Christian bias and toward a respect for
all religious traditions on this campus.
By allowing everyone to celebrate their
own traditions, we will all learn much
about religious differences and tolerance.
I love celebrating Christmas and am
glad that there are structures in society
that allow me to. But they only belong
there if they can somehow cease to
alienate people. This can be accomplished
by removing society's preference for
Christianity through a wider acceptance
of other traditions.
As Stanford sees itself as a leader in
the struggle for multiculturalism, it
needs to reach out and modify itself to
the different religious communities on
this campus. The Jewish and other non-
Christian members of the Stanford com
munity must truly be made to feel that
their religions are respected, and if this
happens, then perhaps the Christmas tree
can return to my residence.
