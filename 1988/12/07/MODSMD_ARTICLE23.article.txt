## 'Skinhead' fliers are sick 
### 
WE LEARNED on Monday that
an unnamed person or persons
have been distributing on
campus a handbill espousing white
supremacy.
The distributors and sponsors list
themselves as the White Aryan Resis
tance, who are more commonly known
as the Skinheads. They list a postal
address in San Francisco and a phone
number. But is that identification
enough? We think not.
We personally find the ideas that the
White Aryan Resistance espouse to be
sick, even disgusting.
We understand why the author or
authors seek to hide under a cloak of
personal anonymity. Their ideas are so
foreign to the core values of this com
munity that we can understand their
desire to avoid taking responsibility for
their words.
These folks mock the very freedom
guaranteed in our society by using it
to peddle their platform of hate. They

want to use their free speech rights
but not be held accountable for what
they say.
Is there room for this kind of cowar
dice in a university that is grounded in
the principles of free and open discus
sion?
Here all ideas, no matter how un
popular, can be heard and debated.
There is, however, a quid pro quo that
the speakers must subject themselves
to the caring and informed judgment of
others.
In a peculiar way, we could all feel
complimented that our University
attracts the ire of extremist groups
like this. They must really be scared
that our collective search for a better
way, for a truly pluralistic community,
is working.
