# 3,000 condoms have been given away so far this quarter
## 
### 
Contrary to what appeared in The
Daily's Nov. 30 article, "Condom sales
are sluggish," I did not say that I
thought the condom dispensers are too
expensive.
I said that people who plan ahead
are likely to be attracted by the fact
that the Contraceptive Information
Center is giving condoms out for free.
Fifty cents (the cost of condoms from
a condom machine) is a trivial amount
to spend to prevent a possible preg-

nancy.
The first direct quote is both sexist
and wrong.
"If a student is sexually active, he
won't want to spend 50 cents when he
could be getting them for 10 cents at a
store." I did not say this.
It takes two to tango â€” condom use
is not gender specific. We give 50 per
cent of our condoms to women.
Finally, I gave The Daily the number
1,600 as a rough estimate of how
many condoms we have given out this
quarter.
In fact, we have given out approxi
mately 3,000 condoms this quarter.
