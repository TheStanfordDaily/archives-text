## Women who have abortions should not be viewed as murderers 
### 
AS A WOMAN who has had an abor
tion, I find it very hard to read in
The Daily that some people who
attend the same university and even the
same classes as I do, think that I am a
murderer.
It is painful and infuriating to read
that some of these people believe that I
and millions of other women are on a
moral level equivalent to that of the per
petrators of the Holocaust, and that we
hold ideas about human life equatable
with those of 19th-century racists who
denied the humanity of black people in
the interests of maintaining a social sys
tem that enslaved millions of living,
breathing, thinking, feeling, productive
human beings.
And it terrifies me to think that many
people sharing these views of women like
me also support the death penalty for
murder.
Although it is somewhat questionable
to Monday-morning-quarterback one's
own life, it is clear to me that if I had
not gotten an abortion when I was 19
years old, I would not now have the
dubious privilege of attending Stanford

with these people.
Much more importantly, I would not
now have the privilege of sharing my life
with my son, who supplies one of my
most important reasons for living.
I do not believe any woman should
have to explain or justify her choice to
get an abortion, but I do think that given
the rather abstract level upon which the
debate is frequently carried out, it might
be beneficial for me to try to relate some
of the circumstances surrounding my de
cision to do so.
When I got an abortion I was involved
with a particularly unstable man. I had
a job which barely gave me enough money
to support myself, and which provided
no maternity leave, no job security, no
day care and no medical benefits. And I
saw nothing and no one in my life who
could give me the support and hope for
the future which would have made the
prospect of life-long single motherhood
conceivable.
Three years later my life had changed
enough for me to be able to plan for a
child and to give my son a life. This
undoubtedly would not have been the

case if I had not gotten the abortion.
I do not understand what gives those
people who consider me a murderer the
right to say that my son should not be
alive today, or that I should have been
forced to go on welfare at age 19 and to
give up the chance to ever participate in
the education and opportunities which
so many Stanford students see as their
birthright.
It's very easy for men, or privileged
women who would never themselves have
to consider the possibility, to say that I
should have foregone the abortion and
given the child up for adoption.
However, considering how difficult it
was to decide to give up a potential but
untenable motherhood, and considering
what I now know about the ties that
bound me to my son during the process
of labor and delivery, I know that I would
not have had the courage to give up a
living, breathing baby.
This may mean that I lack the fortitude
and strength of character of those women
who do give life only to give up their
babies, but I do not believe it makes me
a murderer.

What makes a fertilized egg become a
human being is the process of gestation
within the body of a woman. A fertilized
egg, an embryo, or a fetus in the early
stages of development is not separable
from the life and humanity of the woman
who gives it the means to develop into
a separate human being.
To say a woman has no right to decide
whether she can or cannot give the means
by which an embryo can achieve human
ity, or to call the woman who decides —
for whatever reason — that she cannot
do so a murderer, is to rob a woman of
the control over what makes all of us
human: our bodies.
For me, and I assume for many other
women who have had abortions, the
choice to do so was not a moral one. I
believed that the fetus I was carrying
was not a human being yet.
My choice was an emotional one, and
it was based on the realities of my self
and my life. It was also guided by the
alternatives available to me in a society
which does not provide well for single
mothers or their children.
Laws prohibiting abortion would not

change my belief system, they would not
convince me that I'm a murderer, and
they woud not change the bleak realities
of single motherhood.
What provides women with alternatives
to abortion is not patronizing, terrifying
demonstrations outside abortion clinics.
Nor is it unfeeling exhortations to give
life to a child only to give it up for
adoption.
If pro-lifers really see their calling as
providing women with alternatives to
abortion, they should be fighting with all
their might for paid maternity leaves at
all places of employment; for universal
medical care; for equal pay for women;
and for job training programs, free day
care and adequate scholarships for moth
ers.
However, personal belief sytems cannot
be legislated, and attempts to humiliate,
alienate, frighten, intimidate or coerce
women into giving up control over their
own lives and bodies are only destructive
and inhuman.

with my son, who supplies one of my
most important reasons for living.
I do not believe any woman should
have to explain or justify her choice to
get an abortion, but I do think that given
the rather abstract level upon which the
debate is frequently carried out, it might
be beneficial for me to try to relate some
of the circumstances surrounding my de
cision to do so.
When I got an abortion I was involved
with a particularly unstable man. I had
a job which barely gave me enough money
to support myself, and which provided
no maternity leave, no job security, no
day care and no medical benefits. And I
saw nothing and no one in my life who
could give me the support and hope for
the future which would have made the
prospect of life-long single motherhood
conceivable.
Three years later my life had changed
enough for me to be able to plan for a
child and to give my son a life. This
undoubtedly would not have been the

case if I had not gotten the abortion.
I do not understand what gives those
people who consider me a murderer the
right to say that my son should not be
alive today, or that I should have been
forced to go on welfare at age 19 and to
give up the chance to ever participate in
the education and opportunities which
so many Stanford students see as their
birthright.
It's very easy for men, or privileged
women who would never themselves have
to consider the possibility, to say that I
should have foregone the abortion and
given the child up for adoption.
However, considering how difficult it
was to decide to give up a potential but
untenable motherhood, and considering
what I now know about the ties that
bound me to my son during the process
of labor and delivery, I know that I would
not have had the courage to give up a
living, breathing baby.
This may mean that I lack the fortitude
and strength of character of those women
who do give life only to give up their
babies, but I do not believe it makes me
a murderer.

What makes a fertilized egg become a
human being is the process of gestation
within the body of a woman. A fertilized
egg, an embryo, or a fetus in the early
stages of development is not separable
from the life and humanity of the woman
who gives it the means to develop into
a separate human being.
To say a woman has no right to decide
whether she can or cannot give the means
by which an embryo can achieve human
ity, or to call the woman who decides —
for whatever reason — that she cannot
do so a murderer, is to rob a woman of
the control over what makes all of us
human: our bodies.
For me, and I assume for many other
women who have had abortions, the
choice to do so was not a moral one. I
believed that the fetus I was carrying
was not a human being yet.
My choice was an emotional one, and
it was based on the realities of my self
and my life. It was also guided by the
alternatives available to me in a society
which does not provide well for single
mothers or their children.
Laws prohibiting abortion would not

change my belief system, they would not
convince me that I'm a murderer, and
they woud not change the bleak realities
of single motherhood.
What provides women with alternatives
to abortion is not patronizing, terrifying
demonstrations outside abortion clinics.
Nor is it unfeeling exhortations to give
life to a child only to give it up for
adoption.
If pro-lifers really see their calling as
providing women with alternatives to
abortion, they should be fighting with all
their might for paid maternity leaves at
all places of employment; for universal
medical care; for equal pay for women;
and for job training programs, free day
care and adequate scholarships for moth
ers.
However, personal belief sytems cannot
be legislated, and attempts to humiliate,
alienate, frighten, intimidate or coerce
women into giving up control over their
own lives and bodies are only destructive
and inhuman.

AS A WOMAN who has had an abor
tion, I find it very hard to read in
The Daily that some people who
attend the same university and even the
same classes as I do, think that I am a
murderer.
It is painful and infuriating to read
that some of these people believe that I
and millions of other women are on a
moral level equivalent to that of the per
petrators of the Holocaust, and that we
hold ideas about human life equatable
with those of 19th-century racists who
denied the humanity of black people in
the interests of maintaining a social sys
tem that enslaved millions of living,
breathing, thinking, feeling, productive
human beings.
And it terrifies me to think that many
people sharing these views of women like
me also support the death penalty for
murder.
Although it is somewhat questionable
to Monday-morning-quarterback one's
own life, it is clear to me that if I had
not gotten an abortion when I was 19
years old, I would not now have the
dubious privilege of attending Stanford

with these people.
Much more importantly, I would not
now have the privilege of sharing my life
with my son, who supplies one of my
most important reasons for living.
