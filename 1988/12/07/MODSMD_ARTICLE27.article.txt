'Skinhead' /Tiers
are signs of a very
flawed world-view
We, as residents of Toyon Hall, are
writing to express our disgust at the
distribution of white supremacist fliers
in our dorm.
We recognize the right to free
speech, but we are angered by the
invasion of our privacy and by the
flier's obvious intention: to divide our
home and destroy our community.
Written and distributed by White
Aryan Resistance, the flier perpetuates
misconceptions and promotes a kind of
ignorant hysteria about race relations
in a multi-ethnic society.
Issuing "A Challenge to White
People," the writers of this flier would
have us hate our roommates and
friends on purely racial grounds
("Race-mixing is treason," as the ac
companying newspaper states); would
have us believe that the sole blame for
the critical problems of our times lie
with "non-whites"; that whites are
essentially blameless with regard to
unemployment, racial inequality and
squandered resources, among other
things.
Asking "Are you tired of ... a non
white crime wave which makes our
own cities unsafe for our families," the
group engages in the most despicable
kind of rabble-rousing.
Attributing as complex a problem as
crime to a certain group based on coloi
alone, the group plays on the kinds of
fears reminiscent of Nazi Germany. Do
they really think us ignorant and ir
responsible enough to latch on to such
cop-out answers, to find scapegoats for
difficult social dilemmas?
It is not our intention to contribute
to the "false sense of racial guilt im
posed on whites," which the group
mentions, nor is it to substitute
"white-bashing" for the groundless
attacks on non-whites which the flier
contains.
Our point is that any constructive
dialogue toward a society that is more
just toward and more inclusive of all
its members is set back by such ar
chaic appeals to prejudice. The group
asks us to ignore the painful lessons of
the Civil Rights Movement, as well as
every other significant movement for
social change. "White men built
Americd, White men are America,"

claims an advertisement in the newspa
per.
It is frightening that it 1988 such a
backward mentality exists, is well or
ganized and appears to be growing.
"Skinheads are the Ail-American white
youth; they love mom and love their
flag," the group tells us. There is a
clear association of the American
Dream with the unrealistic and
destructive worldview.
The really irritating thing about this
incident is that it isn't internal; it's
not one Stanford group against an
other. Unlike the Ujamaa House inci
dent, this act can't be punished by the
administration. It can't suspend the
group and require white supremacists
to take Western Culture. This is the
real world intruding on Stanford
idealism, and like it or not, the ugli
ness is out there and it isn't going to
go away easily or quickly.
We need to be aware of the fact that
there are those who see nothing wrong
with the group's stance. We also need
to openly reject the incredible ignor
ance and narrow-mindedness of such
racial stereotypes and to support mem
bers of our community who feel partic
ularly alienated and attacked.
What's more, we need to be able to
discuss among ourselves why this is
happening. Why is the group becoming
so militant now, and why toward us?
Is it because of Stanford's outspoken
support of pluralism?
Perhaps we are particularly suscepti
ble to this kind of extremist backlash
precisely because our community em
phasizes racial diversity and multicul
tural understanding so strongly. There
is clearly a disparity between the
average views on race relations held
here at Stanford and those held across
America.
Perhaps we each need to examine
just how far removed this environment
is from the "real world" norm, as well
as how responsible we are to affect
that norm.

Home environment
of the Bridge is key
to confidentiality
The Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Coming-out Rap Group is one of the
many groups that depend on the safe,

comfortable, confidential environment
of the Bridge Counseling Center. The
home-like atmosphere makes it easier
for people to become part of a
mutually supportive peer counseling
group.
Currently, people who attend groups
at the Bridge know that their con
fidentiality will be respected by the
staff and their peers.
This safe haven would be destroyed
if the University put other groups into
the building, since confidentiality could
no longer be guaranteed. The Bridge
would become an office building,
rather than a home.
The comfortable and familiar feeling
of the Bridge stems not just from the
house but from the live-in staff.
Day or night, a peer counselor is
available to listen to concerns, give
information, make referrals to other
sources of support.
As co-facilitators of the Coming-out
Rap Group, we've seen cases where
people have sought counseling at all
hours and been referred to us. The
continuity provided by the live-ins
makes the Bridge very easy to work
with, and guarantees that it is aware
of our concerns and needs.
The Bridge in its current home is an
important resource of the University.
Leaving it intact is more important
than the slight amount of office space
that could be gained.

Alpha Delt house
is a gathering place
for many students
As an incoming freshman, Stanford
lay before me with its seemingly infi
nite diversity. It was clear that I would
soon find a niche at Stanford, a place
where I truly enjoyed the living condi
tions and could prosper both academi
cally and socially.
This niche didn't open up immedi
ately upon my arrival at Stanford but
rather during spring quarter of my
freshman year. I originally had no
desire to join a fraternity but found
the Alpha Delta Phi to be something
different. I had joined a group that
was recognized as a fraternity but
which most affiliates would agree is
inherently "un-fratlike" in nature. A
group that desires a low-key approach
to fraternity activities and provides a
relaxed atmosphere to all students.
In the course of the past several
days, I have begun to think that the
University ideal of individuals shaping

their Stanford experience is a sham.
The Alpha Delta Phi fraternity was
informed that it would be losing its
housing at the end of this school year
and that our house would irrevocably
be entered into the Draw regardless of
anything that we did.
The reason for the loss of housing
was that we had failed to meet the
quota of new pledges required by the
University. The fact that we have been
well below the University's quota for
most of the past several years is unde
niable.
It is my belief, however, that the
quota system is an unfair practice and
has no grounds for denying housing.
The quota has not been met simply
because the Alpha Delts do not draw
as many new pledges as many of the
more mainstream fraternities.
The quota system is completely ob
jective, quotas being determined solely
by the number of rooms in the house.
Are we to believe that a group can be
denied the right to exist simply be
cause it doesn't have as many mem
bers as the University wishes? If this
were the case, then literally hundreds
of organizations would no longer be in
existence.
We feel that the Alpha Delta Phi
fraternity tradition and experience
would not be able to survive in an
unhoused situation. Without housing,
our group would dwindle to a few
members dispersed among on- and
off-campus housing with no realistic
chance of surviving more than a couple
of years.
The number of members in the Al
pha Delts is small compared to the
number of people that enjoy spending
time at the Alpha Delts. For anybody
who has attended Alpha Delt functions,
it is clear that the house is a gathering
place for hundreds of students and
provides a unique atmosphere which
cannot be duplicated anywhere else on
campus.
Are we to be denied this opportu
nity? Are we to be denied the right to
create our own Stanford experience?
Our existence in its present form is a
valuable asset to the University. It
provides a comfortable gathering place
for a substantial segment of the stu
dent population.
We feel an unfair stance has been
taken and we urge your support in
fighting it. The University is creating
a hypocritical philosophy where diver
sity is supposedly recognized yet is in
actuality denied.
We believe that the loss of our
housing is not going to be an isolated
incident, but rather, it is the intention
of the University to deny many organi
zations, mostly fraternal, the ability to
exist in the next few years.
Stanford's position in this matter is
clearly against the policies that it adv

ocates. The University supposedly
exists for the benefit of the students
and guarantees the right to diversity.
In this case, neither of these policies
is being upheld. It is clear that we the
students will suffer if the University's
current position is maintained.

CIV will mean that
fewer classics will
be taught to frosh
Barry Katz's charges do nothing to
dispel the simple facts: a long list of
classic works are being removed from
the Western Culture course (now to be
CIV) in favor of minor writers chosen
for ideological reasons.
The journalistic reaction to this edu
cational disaster has been widespread
and across the political spectrum. Most
of the pieces have been from moderate
figures and organs (Krauthammer,
Will, Himmelfarb: "Time," "Washing
ton Post" and "Newsweek").
The reading list for Prof. Renato
Rosaldo's pilot course, currently being
taught, gives one a good idea: most of
the items for this quarter are obscure
authors with chips on their shoulders
or knives in their teeth.
A sample title is "With a Pistol in
my Hand". Frantz Fanon is better
known than many of the authors, as is
his program to murder white people en
masse (in his preface Sartre recom
mends their mass suicide).
One can easily imagine the kind of
treatment the Platos and Augustines
will get in courses like that. Mostly
they will just disappear (9 of 15 clas
sics, average, as the newspapers re
ported).
Incidently, I am not a "patron" of
"Stanford Review", merely someone
they consulted because I had been
active in the restoration of Western
Culture. I do like their style and
nerve.
Stanford is being brought low by a
group of ruthless fanatics who have
intimidated the administration, it is
plain to some of us old-timers who
have seen it all before. We are only
beginning to see the cost.

'Skinhead' /Tiers
are signs of a very
flawed world-view
We, as residents of Toyon Hall, are
writing to express our disgust at the
distribution of white supremacist fliers
in our dorm.
We recognize the right to free
speech, but we are angered by the
invasion of our privacy and by the
flier's obvious intention: to divide our
home and destroy our community.
Written and distributed by White
Aryan Resistance, the flier perpetuates
misconceptions and promotes a kind of
ignorant hysteria about race relations
in a multi-ethnic society.
Issuing "A Challenge to White
People," the writers of this flier would
have us hate our roommates and
friends on purely racial grounds
("Race-mixing is treason," as the ac
companying newspaper states); would
have us believe that the sole blame for
the critical problems of our times lie
with "non-whites"; that whites are
essentially blameless with regard to
unemployment, racial inequality and
squandered resources, among other
things.
Asking "Are you tired of ... a non
white crime wave which makes our
own cities unsafe for our families," the
group engages in the most despicable
kind of rabble-rousing.
Attributing as complex a problem as
crime to a certain group based on coloi
alone, the group plays on the kinds of
fears reminiscent of Nazi Germany. Do
they really think us ignorant and ir
responsible enough to latch on to such
cop-out answers, to find scapegoats for
difficult social dilemmas?
It is not our intention to contribute
to the "false sense of racial guilt im
posed on whites," which the group
mentions, nor is it to substitute
"white-bashing" for the groundless
attacks on non-whites which the flier
contains.
Our point is that any constructive
dialogue toward a society that is more
just toward and more inclusive of all
its members is set back by such ar
chaic appeals to prejudice. The group
asks us to ignore the painful lessons of
the Civil Rights Movement, as well as
every other significant movement for
social change. "White men built
Americd, White men are America,"

claims an advertisement in the newspa
per.
It is frightening that it 1988 such a
backward mentality exists, is well or
ganized and appears to be growing.
"Skinheads are the Ail-American white
youth; they love mom and love their
flag," the group tells us. There is a
clear association of the American
Dream with the unrealistic and
destructive worldview.
The really irritating thing about this
incident is that it isn't internal; it's
not one Stanford group against an
other. Unlike the Ujamaa House inci
dent, this act can't be punished by the
administration. It can't suspend the
group and require white supremacists
to take Western Culture. This is the
real world intruding on Stanford
idealism, and like it or not, the ugli
ness is out there and it isn't going to
go away easily or quickly.
We need to be aware of the fact that
there are those who see nothing wrong
with the group's stance. We also need
to openly reject the incredible ignor
ance and narrow-mindedness of such
racial stereotypes and to support mem
bers of our community who feel partic
ularly alienated and attacked.
What's more, we need to be able to
discuss among ourselves why this is
happening. Why is the group becoming
so militant now, and why toward us?
Is it because of Stanford's outspoken
support of pluralism?
Perhaps we are particularly suscepti
ble to this kind of extremist backlash
precisely because our community em
phasizes racial diversity and multicul
tural understanding so strongly. There
is clearly a disparity between the
average views on race relations held
here at Stanford and those held across
America.
Perhaps we each need to examine
just how far removed this environment
is from the "real world" norm, as well
as how responsible we are to affect
that norm.

Home environment
of the Bridge is key
to confidentiality
The Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Coming-out Rap Group is one of the
many groups that depend on the safe,

comfortable, confidential environment
of the Bridge Counseling Center. The
home-like atmosphere makes it easier
for people to become part of a
mutually supportive peer counseling
group.
Currently, people who attend groups
at the Bridge know that their con
fidentiality will be respected by the
staff and their peers.
This safe haven would be destroyed
if the University put other groups into
the building, since confidentiality could
no longer be guaranteed. The Bridge
would become an office building,
rather than a home.
The comfortable and familiar feeling
of the Bridge stems not just from the
house but from the live-in staff.
Day or night, a peer counselor is
available to listen to concerns, give
information, make referrals to other
sources of support.
As co-facilitators of the Coming-out
Rap Group, we've seen cases where
people have sought counseling at all
hours and been referred to us. The
continuity provided by the live-ins
makes the Bridge very easy to work
with, and guarantees that it is aware
of our concerns and needs.
The Bridge in its current home is an
important resource of the University.
Leaving it intact is more important
than the slight amount of office space
that could be gained.

Alpha Delt house
is a gathering place
for many students
As an incoming freshman, Stanford
lay before me with its seemingly infi
nite diversity. It was clear that I would
soon find a niche at Stanford, a place
where I truly enjoyed the living condi
tions and could prosper both academi
cally and socially.
This niche didn't open up immedi
ately upon my arrival at Stanford but
rather during spring quarter of my
freshman year. I originally had no
desire to join a fraternity but found
the Alpha Delta Phi to be something
different. I had joined a group that
was recognized as a fraternity but
which most affiliates would agree is
inherently "un-fratlike" in nature. A
group that desires a low-key approach
to fraternity activities and provides a
relaxed atmosphere to all students.
In the course of the past several
days, I have begun to think that the
University ideal of individuals shaping

their Stanford experience is a sham.
The Alpha Delta Phi fraternity was
informed that it would be losing its
housing at the end of this school year
and that our house would irrevocably
be entered into the Draw regardless of
anything that we did.
The reason for the loss of housing
was that we had failed to meet the
quota of new pledges required by the
University. The fact that we have been
well below the University's quota for
most of the past several years is unde
niable.
It is my belief, however, that the
quota system is an unfair practice and
has no grounds for denying housing.
The quota has not been met simply
because the Alpha Delts do not draw
as many new pledges as many of the
more mainstream fraternities.
The quota system is completely ob
jective, quotas being determined solely
by the number of rooms in the house.
Are we to believe that a group can be
denied the right to exist simply be
cause it doesn't have as many mem
bers as the University wishes? If this
were the case, then literally hundreds
of organizations would no longer be in
existence.
We feel that the Alpha Delta Phi
fraternity tradition and experience
would not be able to survive in an
unhoused situation. Without housing,
our group would dwindle to a few
members dispersed among on- and
off-campus housing with no realistic
chance of surviving more than a couple
of years.
The number of members in the Al
pha Delts is small compared to the
number of people that enjoy spending
time at the Alpha Delts. For anybody
who has attended Alpha Delt functions,
it is clear that the house is a gathering
place for hundreds of students and
provides a unique atmosphere which
cannot be duplicated anywhere else on
campus.
Are we to be denied this opportu
nity? Are we to be denied the right to
create our own Stanford experience?
Our existence in its present form is a
valuable asset to the University. It
provides a comfortable gathering place
for a substantial segment of the stu
dent population.
We feel an unfair stance has been
taken and we urge your support in
fighting it. The University is creating
a hypocritical philosophy where diver
sity is supposedly recognized yet is in
actuality denied.
We believe that the loss of our
housing is not going to be an isolated
incident, but rather, it is the intention
of the University to deny many organi
zations, mostly fraternal, the ability to
exist in the next few years.
Stanford's position in this matter is
clearly against the policies that it adv

ocates. The University supposedly
exists for the benefit of the students
and guarantees the right to diversity.
In this case, neither of these policies
is being upheld. It is clear that we the
students will suffer if the University's
current position is maintained.

CIV will mean that

be taught to frosh
Barry Katz's charges do nothing to
dispel the simple facts: a long list of
classic works are being removed from
the Western Culture course (now to be
CIV) in favor of minor writers chosen
for ideological reasons.
The journalistic reaction to this edu
cational disaster has been widespread
and across the political spectrum. Most
of the pieces have been from moderate
figures and organs (Krauthammer,
Will, Himmelfarb: "Time," "Washing

The reading list for Prof. Renato
Rosaldo's pilot course, currently being
taught, gives one a good idea: most of
the items for this quarter are obscure
authors with chips on their shoulders
or knives in their teeth.
A sample title is "With a Pistol in
my Hand". Frantz Fanon is better
known than many of the authors, as is
his program to murder white people en
masse (in his preface Sartre recom
mends their mass suicide).

cational disaster has been widespread
and across the political spectrum. Most
of the pieces have been from moderate
figures and organs (Krauthammer,
Will, Himmelfarb: "Time," "Washing
ton Post" and "Newsweek").
The reading list for Prof. Renato
Rosaldo's pilot course, currently being
taught, gives one a good idea: most of
the items for this quarter are obscure
authors with chips on their shoulders
or knives in their teeth.
A sample title is "With a Pistol in
my Hand". Frantz Fanon is better
known than many of the authors, as is
his program to murder white people en
masse (in his preface Sartre recom
mends their mass suicide).
One can easily imagine the kind of
treatment the Platos and Augustines
will get in courses like that. Mostly
they will just disappear (9 of 15 clas
sics, average, as the newspapers re
ported).
Incidently, I am not a "patron" of
"Stanford Review", merely someone
they consulted because I had been
active in the restoration of Western
Culture. I do like their style and
nerve.
Stanford is being brought low by a
group of ruthless fanatics who have
intimidated the administration, it is
plain to some of us old-timers who
have seen it all before. We are only
beginning to see the cost.

'Skinhead' /Tiers
are signs of a very
flawed world-view
We, as residents of Toyon Hall, are
writing to express our disgust at the
distribution of white supremacist fliers
in our dorm.
We recognize the right to free
speech, but we are angered by the
invasion of our privacy and by the
flier's obvious intention: to divide our
home and destroy our community.
Written and distributed by White
Aryan Resistance, the flier perpetuates
misconceptions and promotes a kind of
ignorant hysteria about race relations
in a multi-ethnic society.
Issuing "A Challenge to White
People," the writers of this flier would
have us hate our roommates and
friends on purely racial grounds
("Race-mixing is treason," as the ac
companying newspaper states); would
have us believe that the sole blame for
the critical problems of our times lie
with "non-whites"; that whites are
essentially blameless with regard to
unemployment, racial inequality and
squandered resources, among other
things.
Asking "Are you tired of ... a non
white crime wave which makes our
own cities unsafe for our families," the
group engages in the most despicable
kind of rabble-rousing.
Attributing as complex a problem as
crime to a certain group based on coloi
alone, the group plays on the kinds of
fears reminiscent of Nazi Germany. Do
they really think us ignorant and ir
responsible enough to latch on to such
cop-out answers, to find scapegoats for
difficult social dilemmas?
It is not our intention to contribute
to the "false sense of racial guilt im
posed on whites," which the group
mentions, nor is it to substitute
"white-bashing" for the groundless
attacks on non-whites which the flier
contains.
Our point is that any constructive
dialogue toward a society that is more
just toward and more inclusive of all
its members is set back by such ar
chaic appeals to prejudice. The group
asks us to ignore the painful lessons of
the Civil Rights Movement, as well as
every other significant movement for
social change. "White men built
Americd, White men are America,"

claims an advertisement in the newspa
per.
It is frightening that it 1988 such a
backward mentality exists, is well or
ganized and appears to be growing.
"Skinheads are the Ail-American white
youth; they love mom and love their
flag," the group tells us. There is a
clear association of the American
Dream with the unrealistic and
destructive worldview.
The really irritating thing about this
incident is that it isn't internal; it's
not one Stanford group against an
other. Unlike the Ujamaa House inci
dent, this act can't be punished by the
administration. It can't suspend the
group and require white supremacists
to take Western Culture. This is the
real world intruding on Stanford
idealism, and like it or not, the ugli
ness is out there and it isn't going to
go away easily or quickly.
We need to be aware of the fact that
there are those who see nothing wrong
with the group's stance. We also need
to openly reject the incredible ignor
ance and narrow-mindedness of such
racial stereotypes and to support mem
bers of our community who feel partic
ularly alienated and attacked.
What's more, we need to be able to
discuss among ourselves why this is
happening. Why is the group becoming
so militant now, and why toward us?
Is it because of Stanford's outspoken
support of pluralism?
Perhaps we are particularly suscepti
ble to this kind of extremist backlash
precisely because our community em
phasizes racial diversity and multicul
tural understanding so strongly. There
is clearly a disparity between the
average views on race relations held
here at Stanford and those held across
America.
Perhaps we each need to examine
just how far removed this environment
is from the "real world" norm, as well
as how responsible we are to affect
that norm.

Home environment
of the Bridge is key
to confidentiality
The Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Coming-out Rap Group is one of the
many groups that depend on the safe,

comfortable, confidential environment
of the Bridge Counseling Center. The
home-like atmosphere makes it easier
for people to become part of a
mutually supportive peer counseling
group.
Currently, people who attend groups
at the Bridge know that their con
fidentiality will be respected by the
staff and their peers.
This safe haven would be destroyed
if the University put other groups into
the building, since confidentiality could
no longer be guaranteed. The Bridge
would become an office building,
rather than a home.
The comfortable and familiar feeling
of the Bridge stems not just from the
house but from the live-in staff.
Day or night, a peer counselor is
available to listen to concerns, give
information, make referrals to other
sources of support.
As co-facilitators of the Coming-out
Rap Group, we've seen cases where
people have sought counseling at all
hours and been referred to us. The
continuity provided by the live-ins
makes the Bridge very easy to work
with, and guarantees that it is aware
of our concerns and needs.
The Bridge in its current home is an
important resource of the University.
Leaving it intact is more important
than the slight amount of office space
that could be gained.

Alpha Delt house
is a gathering place
for many students
As an incoming freshman, Stanford
lay before me with its seemingly infi
nite diversity. It was clear that I would
soon find a niche at Stanford, a place
where I truly enjoyed the living condi
tions and could prosper both academi
cally and socially.
This niche didn't open up immedi
ately upon my arrival at Stanford but
rather during spring quarter of my
freshman year. I originally had no
desire to join a fraternity but found
the Alpha Delta Phi to be something
different. I had joined a group that
was recognized as a fraternity but
which most affiliates would agree is
inherently "un-fratlike" in nature. A
group that desires a low-key approach
to fraternity activities and provides a
relaxed atmosphere to all students.
In the course of the past several
days, I have begun to think that the
University ideal of individuals shaping

their Stanford experience is a sham.
The Alpha Delta Phi fraternity was
informed that it would be losing its
housing at the end of this school year
and that our house would irrevocably
be entered into the Draw regardless of
anything that we did.
The reason for the loss of housing
was that we had failed to meet the
quota of new pledges required by the
University. The fact that we have been
well below the University's quota for
most of the past several years is unde
niable.
It is my belief, however, that the
quota system is an unfair practice and
has no grounds for denying housing.
The quota has not been met simply
because the Alpha Delts do not draw
as many new pledges as many of the
more mainstream fraternities.
The quota system is completely ob
jective, quotas being determined solely
by the number of rooms in the house.
Are we to believe that a group can be
denied the right to exist simply be
cause it doesn't have as many mem
bers as the University wishes? If this
were the case, then literally hundreds
of organizations would no longer be in
existence.
We feel that the Alpha Delta Phi
fraternity tradition and experience
would not be able to survive in an
unhoused situation. Without housing,
our group would dwindle to a few
members dispersed among on- and
off-campus housing with no realistic
chance of surviving more than a couple
of years.
The number of members in the Al
pha Delts is small compared to the
number of people that enjoy spending
time at the Alpha Delts. For anybody
who has attended Alpha Delt functions,
it is clear that the house is a gathering
place for hundreds of students and
provides a unique atmosphere which
cannot be duplicated anywhere else on
campus.
Are we to be denied this opportu
nity? Are we to be denied the right to
create our own Stanford experience?
Our existence in its present form is a
valuable asset to the University. It
provides a comfortable gathering place
for a substantial segment of the stu
dent population.
We feel an unfair stance has been
taken and we urge your support in
fighting it. The University is creating
a hypocritical philosophy where diver
sity is supposedly recognized yet is in
actuality denied.
We believe that the loss of our
housing is not going to be an isolated
incident, but rather, it is the intention
of the University to deny many organi
zations, mostly fraternal, the ability to
exist in the next few years.
Stanford's position in this matter is
clearly against the policies that it adv

ocates. The University supposedly
exists for the benefit of the students
and guarantees the right to diversity.
In this case, neither of these policies
is being upheld. It is clear that we the
students will suffer if the University's
current position is maintained.
