# 'Skinhead' group targets campus with fliers
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Senior staff writer 
University officials and students at
several campus residences said they
were shocked and disgusted by a flier
distributed this weekend by the White
Aryan Resistance, a neo-Nazi organi
zation based in Southern California
that includes the "skinhead" youth.
Scores of the offensive fliers were
distributed anonymously at various lo
cations around campus. The fliers seek
to recruit WAR members among those
whites who are tired of "discrimination
against whites" â€” which the fliers say
includes affirmative action, "a non

white crime wave" and "forced inte
gration of schools."
They offer "A Challege to White
People" to join WAR, listing a phone
number for a WAR office and a San
Francisco post office box address reg
istered to Tom Metzger, the head of
the organization.
Metzger, a former grand dragon of
the California Ku Klux Klan, was un
available for comment yesterday.
University President Donald Ken
nedy responded yesterday to the fliers
with disgust. "The leaflet from the
White Aryan Resistance is, as (Dean
of Student Affaris) Jim Lyons and (As
soc. Dean of Student Affairs) Michael

Jackson said elsewhere in today's Dai
ly, disgusting."
"Because these groups have some
times been associated with violence
that goes beyond rhetoric, the director
of Public Safety and I have discussed
various measures we might take to
identify further the source of the
leaflets and to be certain that these
activities do not go beyond the bounds
of Constitutionally protected speech,"
Kennedy said.
According to Lyons, the address
shows that WAR is "clearly not a
University-related group."
Lyons called WAR one of the "classic
hate groups of our society." He also

denounced the group's anonymous dis
tribution of fliers, saying that there
is "no room for the one-way issuement
of ideas" on a campus where he said
ideas should be freely offered, criticized
and debated.
This incident is particularly disturb
ing for many students in light of the
recent racist incidents on campus. Ear
lier this quarter a different anti-
Semitic group distributed fliers, which
denounced Holocaust studies, to Hillel,
a Jewish student organization. Also
this quarter posters in Ujamaa House,
the black theme dormitory, were
