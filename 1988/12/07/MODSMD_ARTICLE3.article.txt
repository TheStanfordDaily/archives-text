# 'Skinhead' group targets campus with fliers
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Senior staff writer 
University officials and students at
several campus residences said they
were shocked and disgusted by a flier
distributed this weekend by the White
Aryan Resistance, a neo-Nazi organi
zation based in Southern California
that includes the "skinhead" youth.
Scores of the offensive fliers were
distributed anonymously at various lo
cations around campus. The fliers seek
to recruit WAR members among those
whites who are tired of "discrimination
against whites" — which the fliers say
includes affirmative action, "a non

white crime wave" and "forced inte
gration of schools."
They offer "A Challege to White
People" to join WAR, listing a phone
number for a WAR office and a San
Francisco post office box address reg
istered to Tom Metzger, the head of
the organization.
Metzger, a former grand dragon of
the California Ku Klux Klan, was un
available for comment yesterday.
University President Donald Ken
nedy responded yesterday to the fliers
with disgust. "The leaflet from the
White Aryan Resistance is, as (Dean
of Student Affaris) Jim Lyons and (As
soc. Dean of Student Affairs) Michael

Jackson said elsewhere in today's Dai
ly, disgusting."
"Because these groups have some
times been associated with violence
that goes beyond rhetoric, the director
of Public Safety and I have discussed
various measures we might take to
identify further the source of the
leaflets and to be certain that these
activities do not go beyond the bounds
of Constitutionally protected speech,"
Kennedy said.
According to Lyons, the address
shows that WAR is "clearly not a
University-related group."
Lyons called WAR one of the "classic
hate groups of our society." He also

denounced the group's anonymous dis
tribution of fliers, saying that there
is "no room for the one-way issuement
of ideas" on a campus where he said
ideas should be freely offered, criticized
and debated.
This incident is particularly disturb
ing for many students in light of the
recent racist incidents on campus. Ear
lier this quarter a different anti-
Semitic group distributed fliers, which
denounced Holocaust studies, to Hillel,
a Jewish student organization. Also
this quarter posters in Ujamaa House,
the black theme dormitory, were
defaced with racist epithets.
Members of WAR "must think
there's a potential for interest
here in light of some of the re
sponses to what happened in
Ujamaa and people who thought
it wasn't a big deal," said senior
Gina Hernandez, co-chair of
MEChA, a Chicano-Latino stu
dent group.
In Toyon Hall, where about 30
fliers were distributed Sunday at
around 4 p.m., students stayed up
late discussing the leaflets and
posting copies of the fliers, news
clippings about WAR and blank
sheets of paper for anonymous
student comments in the dorm's
bathrooms.
According to Toyon resident as
* sistant Frank Beadle, a senior,
£ many students were very upset
* by the fliers, which he said
threaten to "tear apart the idea
. of a community that we try to
build."
Toyon resident Alyse Aiello, a
freshman, said she thinks it is
"sick that people think they can
find a quick and easy solution for

problems" like unemployment and
inflation by blaming them on mi
norities.
Aiello also said she found the
fliers "intellectually offensive" to
believe that Stanford students
would want to join WAR.
Senior Xavier Briggs, also an
RA at Toyon, said it is important
for people to understand that
Stanford is an "atypical" environ
ment where people can openly dis
cuss racism and learn from each
other. Briggs said he finds it
"frightening that these [racist]
groups may be gaining ground."
Briggs said "a quick survey of
[comments posted in] the men's
and women's bathrooms" revealed
"pretty much a consensus
against" the fliers.
Aiello agreed that she hadn't
heard any people speak in favor
of WAR but speculated that
people who see nothing wrong
with the fliers probably would not
say anything.
Students wrote various re
sponses to the fliers, calling them
"absurd, scary, moronic and stu
pid," Briggs said. One student
wrote that "even racist pigs" have
the right, under the First Amend
ment, to express their views and

quoted French philosopher
Francois Voltaire: "I disapprove
of what you say but I will defend
to the death your right to say it."
Toyon RA Jessica Evans, a
senior, said there were a number
of running dialogues on the
sheets, from people who were in
tears to one woman who wrote "I
am scared for the human race."
In addition to Toyon, fliers were
found at Branner Hall, Manzanita
Park, Ujamaa and Wilbur Hall as
well as Cubberley, Dinkelspiel and
Memorial auditoriums. Several
dozen fliers were found in the Law
School on faculty doors and near
the law students mailboxes, as
well as under the door of The
Stanford Law Journal, the Law
School's newspaper.
According to Cathy Sandoval, a
law student, the fliers were not
posted on minority professors'
doors. "They targetted white
people," she said. "It really made
us wonder if it had been an inside

job."
Although the flier mentioned
nothing about neo-Nazism, copies
of "WAR '88," the organization's
newspaper that promotes not only
a white supremacist view but also
sexist and anti-Semitic opinions,
were found outside El Centro
Chicano, Cubberley and Stern
Hall.
According to the Aryan Update
hotline advertised in the newspa
per, WAR considers itself neither
right-wing conservative nor Marx
ist left.
The recorded message also
derides what WAR considers to
be "Orwellian newspeak" on tele
vision. "If you by your own de
termination feel you have been
verbally assaulted, you now have
a perfect right, according to the
media, to attempt to kill your ver
bal attacker," it says, referring to
the October brawl on the Geraldo
Rivera show in which black activ
ist Roy Innis attacked White

Aryan Resistance Youth member
John Metzger, Tom Metzger's
son.
WAR, which reportedly has
about 2,000 followers, includes a
number of young skinheads
among its ranks. A call to the
number listed on the fliers circu
lated around Stanford reveals a
recording of a child's voice pro
claiming the "holy mission" of the
group against a background of
loud punk music.
English Prof. John Felstiner,
who teaches Holocaust literature,
said "the presence of young people
is one of the most disturbing
things" about the group.
"That means it's getting bred
into the bloodstream" of young
people instead of being the view
point of older people who are just
"holding onto old-world ideas," he
said.
Felstiner said the incident is "at
best" merely indicative of "a virus
in the bloodstream of any coun
try." However, "If someone has
not studied history and never met
this before, then it is important
to get angry and get informed,"
he said.
Junior Kevin Anderson, an RA
at Ujamaa, where a number of

fliers were found, said there were
some individuals who were "upset
and concerned" by the papers.
Anderson said he is "disap
pointed" but not surprised. "Ac
tions like that and the existence
of organizations like that don't
surprise me," he said, adding that
the "covert" distribution of fliers
was in keeping with his image of
the organization.
Fliers were also distributed in
several clusters at the Manzanita
trailers.
Senior Juliana Horseman said
she found the flier after working
all day on a paper about fascism.
"Just to see it so alive today on
my back doorstep after studying
fascism in the 19305" was ironic
and upsetting, she said.
"We don't need people like this
to offset the progress we've
made," she said.
Sandoval said that because
many people at the Law School
were so concerned, there will be
a forum today at 1:15 p.m. at the
Law School, room 190. "People
are very concerned about the vi
olence these people (WAR) use;
whether they are physically or
psychologically violent, people are
feeling threatened," she said.

'We don't need people like this to offset
the progress we've made [on the issue
of racism].'

University officials and students at
several campus residences said they
were shocked and disgusted by a flier
distributed this weekend by the White
Aryan Resistance, a neo-Nazi organi
zation based in Southern California
that includes the "skinhead" youth.
Scores of the offensive fliers were
distributed anonymously at various lo
cations around campus. The fliers seek
to recruit WAR members among those
whites who are tired of "discrimination
against whites" — which the fliers say
includes affirmative action, "a non

white crime wave" and "forced inte
gration of schools."
They offer "A Challege to White
People" to join WAR, listing a phone
number for a WAR office and a San
Francisco post office box address reg
istered to Tom Metzger, the head of
the organization.
Metzger, a former grand dragon of
the California Ku Klux Klan, was un
available for comment yesterday.
University President Donald Ken
nedy responded yesterday to the fliers
with disgust. "The leaflet from the
White Aryan Resistance is, as (Dean
of Student Affaris) Jim Lyons and (As
soc. Dean of Student Affairs) Michael

Jackson said elsewhere in today's Dai
ly, disgusting."
"Because these groups have some
times been associated with violence
that goes beyond rhetoric, the director
of Public Safety and I have discussed
various measures we might take to
identify further the source of the
leaflets and to be certain that these
activities do not go beyond the bounds
of Constitutionally protected speech,"
Kennedy said.
According to Lyons, the address
shows that WAR is "clearly not a
University-related group."
Lyons called WAR one of the "classic
hate groups of our society." He also

denounced the group's anonymous dis
tribution of fliers, saying that there
is "no room for the one-way issuement
of ideas" on a campus where he said
ideas should be freely offered, criticized
and debated.
This incident is particularly disturb
ing for many students in light of the
recent racist incidents on campus. Ear
lier this quarter a different anti-
Semitic group distributed fliers, which
denounced Holocaust studies, to Hillel,
a Jewish student organization. Also
this quarter posters in Ujamaa House,
the black theme dormitory, were
defaced with racist epithets.
Members of WAR "must think
there's a potential for interest
here in light of some of the re
sponses to what happened in
Ujamaa and people who thought
it wasn't a big deal," said senior
Gina Hernandez, co-chair of
MEChA, a Chicano-Latino stu
dent group.
In Toyon Hall, where about 30
fliers were distributed Sunday at
around 4 p.m., students stayed up
late discussing the leaflets and
posting copies of the fliers, news
clippings about WAR and blank
sheets of paper for anonymous
student comments in the dorm's
bathrooms.
According to Toyon resident as
* sistant Frank Beadle, a senior,
£ many students were very upset
* by the fliers, which he said
threaten to "tear apart the idea
. of a community that we try to
build."
Toyon resident Alyse Aiello, a
freshman, said she thinks it is
"sick that people think they can
find a quick and easy solution for

problems" like unemployment and
inflation by blaming them on mi
norities.
Aiello also said she found the
fliers "intellectually offensive" to
believe that Stanford students
would want to join WAR.
Senior Xavier Briggs, also an
RA at Toyon, said it is important
for people to understand that
Stanford is an "atypical" environ
ment where people can openly dis
cuss racism and learn from each
other. Briggs said he finds it
"frightening that these [racist]
groups may be gaining ground."
Briggs said "a quick survey of
[comments posted in] the men's
and women's bathrooms" revealed
"pretty much a consensus
against" the fliers.
Aiello agreed that she hadn't
heard any people speak in favor
of WAR but speculated that
people who see nothing wrong
with the fliers probably would not
say anything.
Students wrote various re
sponses to the fliers, calling them
"absurd, scary, moronic and stu
pid," Briggs said. One student
wrote that "even racist pigs" have
the right, under the First Amend
ment, to express their views and

quoted French philosopher
Francois Voltaire: "I disapprove
of what you say but I will defend
to the death your right to say it."
Toyon RA Jessica Evans, a
senior, said there were a number
of running dialogues on the
sheets, from people who were in
tears to one woman who wrote "I
am scared for the human race."
In addition to Toyon, fliers were
found at Branner Hall, Manzanita
Park, Ujamaa and Wilbur Hall as
well as Cubberley, Dinkelspiel and
Memorial auditoriums. Several
dozen fliers were found in the Law
School on faculty doors and near
the law students mailboxes, as
well as under the door of The
Stanford Law Journal, the Law
School's newspaper.
According to Cathy Sandoval, a
law student, the fliers were not
posted on minority professors'
doors. "They targetted white
people," she said. "It really made
us wonder if it had been an inside

job."
Although the flier mentioned
nothing about neo-Nazism, copies
of "WAR '88," the organization's
newspaper that promotes not only
a white supremacist view but also
sexist and anti-Semitic opinions,
were found outside El Centro
Chicano, Cubberley and Stern
Hall.
According to the Aryan Update
hotline advertised in the newspa
per, WAR considers itself neither
right-wing conservative nor Marx
ist left.
The recorded message also
derides what WAR considers to
be "Orwellian newspeak" on tele
vision. "If you by your own de

verbally assaulted, you now have

posting copies of the fliers, news
clippings about WAR and blank
sheets of paper for anonymous
student comments in the dorm's
bathrooms.
According to Toyon resident as
* sistant Frank Beadle, a senior,
£ many students were very upset
* by the fliers, which he said
threaten to "tear apart the idea
. of a community that we try to
build."
Toyon resident Alyse Aiello, a
freshman, said she thinks it is
"sick that people think they can
find a quick and easy solution for

problems" like unemployment and
inflation by blaming them on mi
norities.
Aiello also said she found the
fliers "intellectually offensive" to
believe that Stanford students
would want to join WAR.
Senior Xavier Briggs, also an
RA at Toyon, said it is important
for people to understand that
Stanford is an "atypical" environ
ment where people can openly dis
cuss racism and learn from each
other. Briggs said he finds it
"frightening that these [racist]
groups may be gaining ground."
Briggs said "a quick survey of
[comments posted in] the men's
and women's bathrooms" revealed
"pretty much a consensus
against" the fliers.
Aiello agreed that she hadn't
heard any people speak in favor
of WAR but speculated that
people who see nothing wrong
with the fliers probably would not
say anything.
Students wrote various re
sponses to the fliers, calling them
"absurd, scary, moronic and stu
pid," Briggs said. One student
wrote that "even racist pigs" have
the right, under the First Amend
ment, to express their views and

quoted French philosopher
Francois Voltaire: "I disapprove
of what you say but I will defend
to the death your right to say it."
Toyon RA Jessica Evans, a
senior, said there were a number
of running dialogues on the
sheets, from people who were in
tears to one woman who wrote "I
am scared for the human race."
In addition to Toyon, fliers were
found at Branner Hall, Manzanita
Park, Ujamaa and Wilbur Hall as
well as Cubberley, Dinkelspiel and
Memorial auditoriums. Several
dozen fliers were found in the Law
School on faculty doors and near
the law students mailboxes, as
well as under the door of The
Stanford Law Journal, the Law
School's newspaper.
According to Cathy Sandoval, a
law student, the fliers were not
posted on minority professors'
doors. "They targetted white
people," she said. "It really made
us wonder if it had been an inside

job."
Although the flier mentioned
nothing about neo-Nazism, copies
of "WAR '88," the organization's
newspaper that promotes not only
a white supremacist view but also
sexist and anti-Semitic opinions,
were found outside El Centro
Chicano, Cubberley and Stern
Hall.
According to the Aryan Update
hotline advertised in the newspa
per, WAR considers itself neither
right-wing conservative nor Marx
ist left.
The recorded message also
derides what WAR considers to
be "Orwellian newspeak" on tele
vision. "If you by your own de
termination feel you have been
verbally assaulted, you now have
a perfect right, according to the
media, to attempt to kill your ver
bal attacker," it says, referring to
the October brawl on the Geraldo
Rivera show in which black activ
ist Roy Innis attacked White

Aryan Resistance Youth member
John Metzger, Tom Metzger's
son.
WAR, which reportedly has
about 2,000 followers, includes a
number of young skinheads
among its ranks. A call to the
number listed on the fliers circu
lated around Stanford reveals a
recording of a child's voice pro
claiming the "holy mission" of the
group against a background of
loud punk music.
English Prof. John Felstiner,
who teaches Holocaust literature,
said "the presence of young people
is one of the most disturbing
things" about the group.
"That means it's getting bred
into the bloodstream" of young
people instead of being the view
point of older people who are just
"holding onto old-world ideas," he
said.
Felstiner said the incident is "at
best" merely indicative of "a virus
in the bloodstream of any coun
try." However, "If someone has
not studied history and never met
this before, then it is important
to get angry and get informed,"
he said.
Junior Kevin Anderson, an RA
at Ujamaa, where a number of

fliers were found, said there were
some individuals who were "upset
and concerned" by the papers.
Anderson said he is "disap
pointed" but not surprised. "Ac
tions like that and the existence
of organizations like that don't
surprise me," he said, adding that
the "covert" distribution of fliers
was in keeping with his image of
the organization.
Fliers were also distributed in
several clusters at the Manzanita
trailers.
Senior Juliana Horseman said
she found the flier after working
all day on a paper about fascism.
"Just to see it so alive today on
my back doorstep after studying
fascism in the 19305" was ironic
and upsetting, she said.
"We don't need people like this
to offset the progress we've
made," she said.
Sandoval said that because
many people at the Law School
were so concerned, there will be
a forum today at 1:15 p.m. at the
Law School, room 190. "People
are very concerned about the vi
olence these people (WAR) use;
whether they are physically or
psychologically violent, people are
feeling threatened," she said.

'We don't need people like this to offset
the progress we've made [on the issue
of racism].'
