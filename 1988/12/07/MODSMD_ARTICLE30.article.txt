## Confronting difficult questions Frosh evaluate implications of diversity 
### Sophia Shing 
The class of 1992 is "the most ethnically
diverse class ever in the history of Stanford,"
according to Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter.
Students from the District of Columbia and
every state except North Dakota are repre
sented, as well as 44 frosh arriving from
foreign countries. Ten percent of the enrolling
freshmen are black, 8.6 percent Chicano and
16 percent Asian Americans.
Nonetheless, minority life and race relations
especially have ballooned this fall into an even
more urgent issue for all Stanford students.
Early in the quarter two freshmen posted
a racially offensive flier in Ujamaa House.
This incident in particular, because it was
precipitated by two freshmen, has raised ques
tions of frosh cultural baggage and if — or
how — Stanford repacks students' bags of
ideas about diversity and race relations.
A survey of over 100 frosh conducted by
The Daily indicates conflicting opinions,
varying backgrounds and a limited familiarity
with the topic of minority life at Stanford.
For instance, diversity is not mirrored in
statistics in Valerie Stackel's opinion. Stackel
is a frosh from Honolulu, where virtually no
ethnic group composes a majority.
In September, she echoed University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy's welcoming message
to the freshmen, urging a more supportive
spirit in approaching differences. "We need to
realize that diversity is not when you make
an extra effort to recognize differences, but

when you can look at a person and not notice
that they're of another race."
Discovering and questioning the meaning
of her ethnicity, Stackel, who was born in
Japan, comes from a multiracial family. Be
cause she does not belong to only one race,
Stackel wondered how she fit into the picture
of Stanford's diversity. She commended Stan
ford for its efforts to explore diversity, al
though she said orientation overly emphasized
the theme.
After her first quarter at Stanford, Stackel
commented that "a lot of uproar" is made
about racism but "it just fizzles out." She is
disappointed to note that so much attention
is given to the problem and so little to the
solution.
Diversity was a completely new issue for
Benji Chui, from Hong Kong. Because there
is virtually no racial mix in Hong Kong, Chui
had never previously questioned discrimina
tion. His initial reaction was that "it's a good
idea that students are given the chance to
mature in an environment which tries to elim
inate prejudice."
At the end of 10 weeks, Chui says he has
found people willing to express various
opinions about racism. He claims, moreover,
that he has not experienced "any real in
stances of prejudice." Chui says he has ob
served that "only a minority of people have
strong racial feelings," but says he has found
the Stanford community in general quite un
derstanding.
A Mexican frosh from Montebello, Califor

nia, Denise Navarro, says she could count the
number of white students from her high school
on her fingers. Coming from an environment
in which many of her classmates were of the
same race as she, Navarro was a little in
timidated by coming to Stanford. She had
been warned that white people would not ac
cept her.
After a quarter, she says nobody has openly
discriminated against her, but she still notices
subtle expressions of it. Contrary to some of
her classmates, Navarro argues it is better to
overstress diversity than understress it.
Generally more comfortable around people
of her own race, she admits feeling shy about
approaching people of other races. She adds
she often finds it is easier to "always assume
that people are Mexican even if they're not."
Another frosh, Alex Raskin, also knows
about the importance of cultural differences.
Born and raised for much of his childhood in
the USSR, Raskin now lives in Los Angeles.
Upon arrival at Stanford, Raskin did not
believe the campus to be "diverse at all" in
comparison to his large city high school which
represented a fairly even cross-section of the
ethnic communities. He questioned the
relevancy of the orientation programs explor
ing the meaning and actuality of diversity.
Raskin said he thinks the attention given
to pluralism is often solely intended "to prevent
accusations of prejudice," rather than elimi
nate the prejudice.
