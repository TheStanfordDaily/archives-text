# Envisioning a 'rainbow society' at Stanford

Members of minority commu
nities, student leaders and faculty
commented on various concerns
and ideals for a Stanford with
more mature diversity and sound
minority life.
Mary Dillard, chair of the Black
Student Union, said in her vision
of an ideal Stanford environment,
the curriculum and institutional
support would reflect sincere re
spect for minority differences and
needs.
"The students of color could
study about themselves and
others could recognize the
legitimacy of their concerns about
ignorance," Dillard said.
She advises the administration
to take an active role in "looking
to the future," and cautions

against transferring this respon
sibility from the University's
hands to students of color organ
izations, asking them "to take the
lead in action."
Chair of the Asian-American
Students Association Brian Kim
said, "Unless we have evenly
divided power structures, then the
students of color do not have the
type of representation they need."
Challenging community mem
bers to examine the types of
people who hold the positions of
power at Stanford, Kim noted
they are mostly "white males."
"Racism does not exist only on
a personal level," Kim added,
"Just because laws say there is
representation, doesn't mean
there is truly equality."
Delia Ibarra, co-chair of the
MEChA, said Stanford has the

potential to be "truly pluralistic"
because of the quantity and
quality of its students of color.
Ibarra argued that "having
racist emotions doesn't mean that
you're racist." Fearing accusa
tions of racism, however, she said
causes people to "harbor these
emotions and never come to terms
with them." An ethnic studies re
quirement would help solve this,
as would greater minority faculty
representation, she said, arguing
Stanford must take action in
these areas.
"Too often," Ibarra said, "stu
dents experience culture shock
when they arrive at Stanford."
She noted that many people have
never been exposed to the really
underprivileged. "Orientation was
a good start," she added, "but
people had questions which were

not answered."
Daniel Bao, speaking as a mem
ber of the Gay, Lesbian and
Bisexual Community Center, said
he has found the Stanford com
munity to assume that there are
no problems in minority life un
less something surfaces in public.
Bao recommended that the Uni
versity act pro-actively, explaining
that the Ujamaa and Otero inci
dents indicate daily problems of
many students' lives rather than
illustrate exceptions to generally
healthy minority relations.
Tracey Le√üeau, chair of the
Stanford American-Indian Organ
ization, shared Dillard's
sentiments. She sees the admin
istration "pushing the responsi
bility of change onto the color
