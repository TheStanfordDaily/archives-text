# Envisioning a 'rainbow society' at Stanford
## 
### Sophia Shing 
Members of minority commu
nities, student leaders and faculty
commented on various concerns
and ideals for a Stanford with
more mature diversity and sound
minority life.
Mary Dillard, chair of the Black
Student Union, said in her vision
of an ideal Stanford environment,
the curriculum and institutional
support would reflect sincere re
spect for minority differences and
needs.
"The students of color could
study about themselves and
others could recognize the
legitimacy of their concerns about
ignorance," Dillard said.
She advises the administration
to take an active role in "looking
to the future," and cautions

against transferring this respon
sibility from the University's
hands to students of color organ
izations, asking them "to take the
lead in action."
Chair of the Asian-American
Students Association Brian Kim
said, "Unless we have evenly
divided power structures, then the
students of color do not have the
type of representation they need."
Challenging community mem
bers to examine the types of
people who hold the positions of
power at Stanford, Kim noted
they are mostly "white males."
"Racism does not exist only on
a personal level," Kim added,
"Just because laws say there is
representation, doesn't mean
there is truly equality."
Delia Ibarra, co-chair of the
MEChA, said Stanford has the

potential to be "truly pluralistic"
because of the quantity and
quality of its students of color.
Ibarra argued that "having
racist emotions doesn't mean that
you're racist." Fearing accusa
tions of racism, however, she said
causes people to "harbor these
emotions and never come to terms
with them." An ethnic studies re
quirement would help solve this,
as would greater minority faculty
representation, she said, arguing
Stanford must take action in
these areas.
"Too often," Ibarra said, "stu
dents experience culture shock
when they arrive at Stanford."
She noted that many people have
never been exposed to the really
underprivileged. "Orientation was
a good start," she added, "but
people had questions which were

not answered."
Daniel Bao, speaking as a mem
ber of the Gay, Lesbian and
Bisexual Community Center, said
he has found the Stanford com
munity to assume that there are
no problems in minority life un
less something surfaces in public.
Bao recommended that the Uni
versity act pro-actively, explaining
that the Ujamaa and Otero inci
dents indicate daily problems of
many students' lives rather than
illustrate exceptions to generally
healthy minority relations.
Tracey Leßeau, chair of the
Stanford American-Indian Organ
ization, shared Dillard's
sentiments. She sees the admin
istration "pushing the responsi
bility of change onto the color
coalition when it should actually
be a shared endeavor."
She emphasized that the teach
ing of different cultures should
not only concern ethnic groups,
but all students investing in an
education.
All too often, according to
Leßeau, students of color feel
"pressured to teach others about
themselves."
Ethnic theme houses combat
this problem and contribute con
structively to minority life, she
said, because students can simply
relax there, without always serv
ing as cultural resources.
Along with others, Leßeau
noted increased residential and
staff training and financial com
mitment as crucial elements in im
proving minority life.
Julian Low, the director of the
Asian-American Activities Center
and a three-quarters time ethnic
dean, took part in the residential
education training for orientation.
He found that the importance
Stanford confers to diversity is an
unfamiliar and challenging con
cept to many freshmen, whose
pre-Stanford understanding of
minority issues may be overes
timated by residential and curric
ulum planners.
"The freshmen appeared inter
ested in learning about diversity,
but some felt frustrated by not
being given the opportunities to
sort through all of the new ideas,"
Low said. "Their ideas were chal
lenged and it was overwhelming,
but they [wanted] to deal with it."
Nevertheless, many obstacles
slow change. Bao said progress
often gets entangled in a web of
procedure. For instance, the res
olution of the Otero incident in
volved an extensive search for
"proof* of the problem in order
to make "concrete recommenda
tions to the university," Bao said.
History Prof. Kennell Jackson
echoed Bao's criticism of the
laborious University procedure
for dealing with minority affairs.
He suggested implementing
changes to address the problems

rather than launching studies to
verify the existence of the sore
spots.
Jackson said racial or other dis
criminatory transgressions should
be dealt with as any disciplinary
questions — they should be mea
sured by the Fundamental Stand
ard of acceptable behavior
through established judicial mech
anisms and handled promptly.
Thus, extreme drunkenness or
racist acts would be judged by the
same terms and treated with the
same efficiency. He said, "It is
really just a question of the Fun
damental Standard and the order
that should be maintained on
campus."
The Student's of Color Coali
tion's Mandate for Change calls
for racism to be included as a
violation of the Fundamental
Standard.
In describing a more positive
university environment for minor
ities, Jackson suggested the need
for students to feel at liberty to
communicate and share personal
experience limited only by the
principles of respect embodied in
the Fundamental Standard.

Although Allison May, a dis
abled staff member at the Dis
ability Resource Center, said
physical disabilities are often a
"less hostile and touchy topic,"
than race relations, she noted that
they sometimes prove "a lot
harder for people to deal with."
She said discrimination against
disabled persons is often over
looked and not discussed because
it is less noticeable than other
forms, and because people are of
ten not atune to it.
May said she realizes handicaps
are "an issue of fear, awkward
ness and discomfort" for many
students but she says"it hurts
anyway" when people are "not
willing to ask you questions be
cause of fear." Echoing both

Dillard and Leßeau, she added,
"I don't want to be separated as
somebody's instrument for educa
tion."
Molly Sandperl, assistant direc
tor of the Disability Resource Cen
ter, commended the admini
stration for its support, but ob
served that handicapped students
face insensitivity and ignorance
among their peers.
"The assumption that people
with disabilities are not as bright
as others is still present and com
pletely outrageous," Sandperl
said.
Nevertheless, Sandperl empha
sized that "more services for the
disabled are available at Stanford
than many other Ivy League in
stitutions."
David Brown, a member of the
Council of Presidents, said he
hopes students might work to
gether for "a rainbow society
where the individual is respected
for (his or her) uniqueness and
not in spite of it."
One's uniqueness might also be
called race, difference, sex, ethnic
heritage. And some argue that
how one frames the issues deter
mines the quality of debate.
Psychology Prof. Lee Ross sug
gested the negative connotations
associated with the word "racism"
create unnecessary awkwardness
in talking about differences.
He called the Stanford commu
nity "incredibly race conscious,"
and said racist incidents cannot
be eliminated in society or on
campus.
Implementing programs for fos
tering more positive campus re
lations should be an imperative
aim of the University, without the
need of occurrences such as those
at Ujamaa and Otero serving as
reminders or justification for
launching constructive policies,
Ross said.
Searching for a "cure" to rac
ism, he claimed, is reaching for
an unattainable goal, but it does
serve as an impetus for ameliorat
ing relations and enacting desir
able programs.
He also noted Stanford's long
term responsibility to society to
send out students informed and
practiced in understanding and
dealing with differences.

aim of the University, without the
need of occurrences such as those
at Ujamaa and Otero serving as
reminders or justification for
launching constructive policies,
Ross said.
Searching for a "cure" to rac
ism, he claimed, is reaching for
an unattainable goal, but it does

He also noted Stanford's long

send out students informed and
practiced in understanding and
dealing with differences.

'Just because laws

Members of minority commu
nities, student leaders and faculty
commented on various concerns
and ideals for a Stanford with
more mature diversity and sound
minority life.
Mary Dillard, chair of the Black
Student Union, said in her vision
of an ideal Stanford environment,
the curriculum and institutional
support would reflect sincere re
spect for minority differences and
needs.
"The students of color could
study about themselves and
others could recognize the
legitimacy of their concerns about
ignorance," Dillard said.
She advises the administration
to take an active role in "looking
to the future," and cautions

against transferring this respon
sibility from the University's
hands to students of color organ
izations, asking them "to take the
lead in action."
Chair of the Asian-American
Students Association Brian Kim
said, "Unless we have evenly
divided power structures, then the
students of color do not have the
type of representation they need."
Challenging community mem
bers to examine the types of
people who hold the positions of
power at Stanford, Kim noted
they are mostly "white males."
"Racism does not exist only on
a personal level," Kim added,
"Just because laws say there is
representation, doesn't mean
there is truly equality."
Delia Ibarra, co-chair of the
MEChA, said Stanford has the

potential to be "truly pluralistic"
because of the quantity and
quality of its students of color.
Ibarra argued that "having
racist emotions doesn't mean that
you're racist." Fearing accusa
tions of racism, however, she said
causes people to "harbor these
emotions and never come to terms
with them." An ethnic studies re
quirement would help solve this,
as would greater minority faculty
representation, she said, arguing
Stanford must take action in
these areas.
"Too often," Ibarra said, "stu
dents experience culture shock
when they arrive at Stanford."
She noted that many people have
never been exposed to the really
underprivileged. "Orientation was
a good start," she added, "but
people had questions which were

not answered."
Daniel Bao, speaking as a mem
ber of the Gay, Lesbian and
Bisexual Community Center, said
he has found the Stanford com
munity to assume that there are
no problems in minority life un
less something surfaces in public.
Bao recommended that the Uni
versity act pro-actively, explaining
that the Ujamaa and Otero inci
dents indicate daily problems of
many students' lives rather than
illustrate exceptions to generally
healthy minority relations.
Tracey Leßeau, chair of the
Stanford American-Indian Organ
ization, shared Dillard's
sentiments. She sees the admin
istration "pushing the responsi
bility of change onto the color
coalition when it should actually
be a shared endeavor."
She emphasized that the teach
ing of different cultures should
not only concern ethnic groups,
but all students investing in an
education.
All too often, according to
Leßeau, students of color feel
"pressured to teach others about
themselves."
Ethnic theme houses combat
this problem and contribute con
structively to minority life, she
said, because students can simply
relax there, without always serv
ing as cultural resources.
Along with others, Leßeau
noted increased residential and
staff training and financial com
mitment as crucial elements in im
proving minority life.
Julian Low, the director of the
Asian-American Activities Center
and a three-quarters time ethnic
dean, took part in the residential
education training for orientation.
He found that the importance
Stanford confers to diversity is an
unfamiliar and challenging con
cept to many freshmen, whose
pre-Stanford understanding of
minority issues may be overes
timated by residential and curric
ulum planners.
"The freshmen appeared inter
ested in learning about diversity,
but some felt frustrated by not
being given the opportunities to
sort through all of the new ideas,"
Low said. "Their ideas were chal
lenged and it was overwhelming,
but they [wanted] to deal with it."
Nevertheless, many obstacles
slow change. Bao said progress
often gets entangled in a web of
procedure. For instance, the res
olution of the Otero incident in
volved an extensive search for
"proof* of the problem in order
to make "concrete recommenda
tions to the university," Bao said.
History Prof. Kennell Jackson
echoed Bao's criticism of the
laborious University procedure
for dealing with minority affairs.
He suggested implementing
changes to address the problems

rather than launching studies to
verify the existence of the sore
spots.
Jackson said racial or other dis
criminatory transgressions should
be dealt with as any disciplinary
questions — they should be mea
sured by the Fundamental Stand
ard of acceptable behavior
through established judicial mech
anisms and handled promptly.
Thus, extreme drunkenness or
racist acts would be judged by the
same terms and treated with the
same efficiency. He said, "It is
really just a question of the Fun
damental Standard and the order
that should be maintained on
campus."
The Student's of Color Coali
tion's Mandate for Change calls
for racism to be included as a
violation of the Fundamental
Standard.
In describing a more positive
university environment for minor
ities, Jackson suggested the need
for students to feel at liberty to
communicate and share personal
experience limited only by the
principles of respect embodied in
the Fundamental Standard.

Although Allison May, a dis
abled staff member at the Dis
ability Resource Center, said
physical disabilities are often a
"less hostile and touchy topic,"
than race relations, she noted that
they sometimes prove "a lot
harder for people to deal with."
She said discrimination against
disabled persons is often over
looked and not discussed because
it is less noticeable than other
forms, and because people are of
ten not atune to it.
May said she realizes handicaps
are "an issue of fear, awkward
ness and discomfort" for many
students but she says"it hurts
anyway" when people are "not
willing to ask you questions be
cause of fear." Echoing both

Dillard and Leßeau, she added,
"I don't want to be separated as
somebody's instrument for educa
tion."
Molly Sandperl, assistant direc
tor of the Disability Resource Cen
ter, commended the admini
stration for its support, but ob
served that handicapped students
face insensitivity and ignorance
among their peers.
"The assumption that people
with disabilities are not as bright
as others is still present and com
pletely outrageous," Sandperl
said.
Nevertheless, Sandperl empha
sized that "more services for the
disabled are available at Stanford
than many other Ivy League in
stitutions."
David Brown, a member of the
Council of Presidents, said he
hopes students might work to
gether for "a rainbow society
where the individual is respected
for (his or her) uniqueness and
not in spite of it."
One's uniqueness might also be
called race, difference, sex, ethnic
heritage. And some argue that
how one frames the issues deter
mines the quality of debate.
Psychology Prof. Lee Ross sug
gested the negative connotations
associated with the word "racism"
create unnecessary awkwardness
in talking about differences.
He called the Stanford commu
nity "incredibly race conscious,"
and said racist incidents cannot
be eliminated in society or on
campus.
Implementing programs for fos

hopes students might work to
gether for "a rainbow society
where the individual is respected
for (his or her) uniqueness and
not in spite of it."
One's uniqueness might also be
called race, difference, sex, ethnic
heritage. And some argue that
how one frames the issues deter
mines the quality of debate.
Psychology Prof. Lee Ross sug
gested the negative connotations
associated with the word "racism"
create unnecessary awkwardness
in talking about differences.
He called the Stanford commu
nity "incredibly race conscious,"
and said racist incidents cannot
be eliminated in society or on
campus.
Implementing programs for fos
tering more positive campus re
lations should be an imperative
aim of the University, without the
need of occurrences such as those
at Ujamaa and Otero serving as
reminders or justification for
launching constructive policies,
Ross said.
Searching for a "cure" to rac
ism, he claimed, is reaching for
an unattainable goal, but it does
serve as an impetus for ameliorat
ing relations and enacting desir
able programs.
He also noted Stanford's long
term responsibility to society to
send out students informed and
practiced in understanding and
dealing with differences.

'Just because laws
say there is represen
tation, doesn't mean
there is truly equality.'
