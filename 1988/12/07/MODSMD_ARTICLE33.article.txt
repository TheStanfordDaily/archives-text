# Dead week vacation ideas: hiking the Ribitor trail
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
My fellow lovers of life and
its bounty, it is upon us! Yes,
indeed, the holiday season has
finally arrived, chock-full of
cheer, love, rosy-red cheeks and
cold hard cash (that'll teach you
to dip your wallet in liquid
nitrogen).
However, friends, many
Americans fall into a deep, dark
depression at this time of year.
Maudlin, melancholic, misty
eyed, mournful and melo
dramatic, many Americans find
that these weeks touch heart
chords better left unstrummed.
But don't despair, my jejune
Philistines, the Bug says, "Hey,
you can make a difference!"
Lend a hand, or just go crazy
with love and give it away. Invite
the neighbors over for a game
of Pictionary. Enjoy General
Foods International coffees with
your sweetheart in front of the
hearth or the gas stove.
Celebrate the goodness in
your heart you so often compro
mise. Give to the Salvation
Army and finally rid yourself of
those bothersome pennies and
Canadian coins. Eat an entire
Sara Lee coffee cake in one sit
ting. Buy an offensive Christ
mas card for your grandmother
and sign it with your sister's
name.
Strengthen friendships and
end enemyships, at least tempo
rarily — extend your hand and
heart in forgiveness of thy foes
so that the next time you screw
'em over it will be just that
much more devastating.
Dear Bug,
How did they stick those little
yellow reflector things on the
road? Why did they do it? They
cause bike crashes. Can they be
removed surreptitiously with a

minimum of equipment?

There are things going on be
hind the scenes on the Stanford
campus which you would never
believe. The glossy, smiling
veneer of Stanford hides a
nefarious underground bustling
with unscrupulous activity
which despite its nature is vital
to the smooth operation of the
University.
Unfortunately, the Bug
knows no specifics concerning
this activity. However, and per
haps also unfortunately, he will
tell you about the innocuous
system of intra-campus traffic
control.
Some of what follows was
learned courtesy of Operations
and Maintenance Asst. Director
Bruce Wiggins and Campus
Planning administrator Tom
Richman. Some is simply the
product of an imagination that
just won't quit, no matter how
many times it is demoted.
Reiterbisectilluminators
(Ribitors), as "those little yellow

reflector things" are known in
the business, have been placed
along the roadways to guide
delivery and service vehicles
around the campus. They have
been laid out in a manner which
allows for minimum student
road kills and deviation from
reiterbisectilluminated roads is
a traffic violation.
The National Park Service
gives backpacking tours of each
reiterbisectilluminator trail
every hour on the hour, seven
days a week, except Sunday and
Wednesday. A heavy sweater or
light parka and comfortable
walking shoes are recommend
ed. The tour lengths vary ac
cording to the walking pace*
Based on a brief glance as he
walked by a row of the Ribitors
the other day, the Bug would
say they are attached to the road
surface by a cement-like sub
stance. It looks like putty but,
surprisingly, is much harder and
does not bounce or lift off
reverse images of the Sunday
comics.
In the course of finding the
answer to your last question,
the Bug dusted off his mini
jackhammer and went on a mid
night hunt for Ribitors last
night. At first, he had no suc
cess; he was unable to remove
any Ribitors "surreptitiously"
because it was so dark. Luckily,
two Stanford police patrol cars
were in the area, and they di
rected their headlights on my
prey, greatly facilitating the
process.
Actually, I think it would be
very difficult to remove a
Ribitor intact from the road. But
gee, if you could, it sure would
be a nifty item to add to any
fraternity's zany, authority-be
damned collection of street signs
and traffic pylons.
Until next year, the Bug has
spoken.

(Ribitors), as "those little yellow

reflector things" are known in
the business, have been placed
along the roadways to guide
delivery and service vehicles
around the campus. They have
been laid out in a manner which
allows for minimum student
road kills and deviation from
reiterbisectilluminated roads is
a traffic violation.
The National Park Service
gives backpacking tours of each
reiterbisectilluminator trail
every hour on the hour, seven
days a week, except Sunday and
Wednesday. A heavy sweater or
light parka and comfortable
walking shoes are recommend
ed. The tour lengths vary ac
cording to the walking pace*
Based on a brief glance as he
walked by a row of the Ribitors
the other day, the Bug would
say they are attached to the road
surface by a cement-like sub
stance. It looks like putty but,
surprisingly, is much harder and
does not bounce or lift off
reverse images of the Sunday
comics.
In the course of finding the
answer to your last question,
the Bug dusted off his mini
jackhammer and went on a mid
night hunt for Ribitors last
night. At first, he had no suc
cess; he was unable to remove
any Ribitors "surreptitiously"
because it was so dark. Luckily,
two Stanford police patrol cars
were in the area, and they di
rected their headlights on my
prey, greatly facilitating the
process.
Actually, I think it would be
very difficult to remove a
Ribitor intact from the road. But
gee, if you could, it sure would
be a nifty item to add to any
fraternity's zany, authority-be
damned collection of street signs
and traffic pylons.
Until next year, the Bug has
spoken.
