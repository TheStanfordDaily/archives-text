# Stanford moms juggle kids and careers

"You just want to go to law school because
you haven't gotten married yet." Many
women of the '80s would probably shrug
off such a statement. But in 1960, when a
Stanford Law School dean used these words
to daunt undergraduate Sharon Gadberry,
the statement caused painful feelings and
confusion.
"Nobody had told me I was supposed to
get married and get engaged," said Gadberry,
now the owner of a prominent firm in San
Francisco that helps executives find new
jobs.
"I wanted to have a career ... [but the
dean's comments) made me think 'maybe
people think I'm strange because I want to
do this.'"
But times have changed and women, in
increasing numbers, are pursuing profes
sional careers.
According to March 1988 article in The
Psychology of Women Quarterly, "Sixty per
cent of married mothers with school-age
children were in the labor force in March
1984, compared with 40 percent in 1970."
And the influx of women to the working
world has created a different environment
there, according to Gadberry. Women lend
common sense, honesty and an ability to
"get things done" to the business environ
ment, she said.
Stanford alumnus and Board of Trustee
member Linda Clever, a mother and inter
nist at Pacific Presbyterian Hospital, agreed
that the inclusion of women in the work
force makes "more talent available to our
country and world."
However, despite these working women's
convictions, questions arise as to how women
may not be able to manage both career and

Economics Prof. Victor Fuchs speculated
that "one of the reasons women are disad
vantaged economically is because of their
desire for children."
Fuchs probes the ramifications of this
situation in his newly-published book,
"Women's Quest for Economic Equality."
According to Fuchs, a government
sponsored allowance of $2,000 per child per
year would help women much more than
legislation requiring companies to provide
child care.
Fuchs said providing child care in the
workplace poses other problems. "It makes
it seem like somebody else is paying for it."
People will still end up paying for such
benefits in the forms of price increases and
lower wages, he said.
Although Fuchs predicted that a more
equitable future for men and women may
evolve, he said he that a low birth rate
would probably result. "For those women

who are as serious about their careers as
men, their answer is going to be having one
child or no children," he said.
Fuchs also noted that college-age women
are often disillusioned when they first hit
the professional world. "Young women come
through college with an egalitarian view of
the world," so it sometimes shocks them to
face problems like economic inequality.
"After the initial shock they are glad that
they've thought of this," Fuchs added.
"Young men need to be more sensitive to
the problems that young women face, women
need to be more realistic about what they're
going to face."
Clever advised undergraduate women to
"get accustomed to juggling, get accustomed
to setting priorities, get accustomed to com
municating what you really want."
Gadberry also had some suggestions for
juggling both motherhood and a career. Both
parents need to be involved with raising the
children. Flexible work schedules and shared
responsibility will help working mothers, she
said.
"It makes men nicer when they have to
watch kids," Gadsberry added. "It makes
them better in business, too — they learn
sensitivity, how to deal with unstructured
situations and distractions, flexibility, the
ability to work on several different projects
at once and time management."
For Clever, managing career and family
represents more of a challenge than a prob
lem. "If a person is determined to have a
satisfying life (it takes) eternal vigilance and
hard work no matter how you slice it," she
said.
Clever asserted that "superb child care,"
as well as "a partnership between the
spouses," is essential to a successful balance
of parenting and career.
