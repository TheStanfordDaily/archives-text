# County approves plan for biology building
## 
### Ravi Desai Staff writer 
The Santa Clara County-
Planning Commission last
week cleared the way for con
struction of a new biological
sciences facility by unani
mously approving an environ
mental impact report, or EIR,
for the proposed building.
The new building "would not
have a significant adverse im
pact" on several areas of con
cern, including public health,
water supply and transporta
tion, according to the report.
The commission's 7-0 vote
on the report allows the Uni
versity to start building a new
facility to provide more office
space and laboratories for the
Biology Department.
The University had planned
to start building in November.
But after several groups had
raised concerns about the
building's potential effect on
the environment, the Univer
sity commissioned an EIR.
Several environmental and

animal rights groups have long
opposed the construction of the
science building. The Silicon
Valley Toxics Coalition opposes
the construction project be
cause scientists in the building
will use toxic materials. They
question the University's waste
disposal measures.
Ted Smith, a representative
of the Toxics Coalition, was un
available for comment yester
day.
Animal rights activists are
opposed to the project because
research involving animals will
take place in the new labora
tories.
The building will cost $33
million dollars. As planned, the
facility will be connected to the
Herrin building. Construction
is scheduled to begin in Feb
ruary, and the building will be
completed in 1991, according
to Biology Prof. Robert Simoni.
The structure is part of the
Near West Campus construc
tion plan, which aims to rebuild
and expand the Science and En
gineering quad.
