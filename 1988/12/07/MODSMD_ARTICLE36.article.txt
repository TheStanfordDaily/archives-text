# Nine Chinese students pressed to return home
## Home government pushes United States not to renew their visas, Stanford offers help 
### Baldwin Lee Staff writer 
The People's Republic of China
is forcing at least nine Stanford
students from China to return
home regardless of the condition
of their studies or research, ac
cording to Edward Lau, a San
Francisco attorney who is repre
senting 40 Chinese students
nationwide.
The Stanford students are
among about 5,000 students from
the People's Republic of China
that are on lists of students being
forced to leave the United States
and return home through a provi
sion of their J-l visas.
J-l visas are issued by the U.S.
government to foreign students,
allowing them to come here to
complete a course of study. Before
the Chinese government released
their lists, students could apply
for visa extensions or a new type
of visa before their visa expired.
The Chinese government's pres
sure aims to prevent U.S. exten
sions or issuing of such visas,
thereby forcing Chinese students
to return home.
The students are "some of the
brightest scholars in America,"
and China fears that they will

never return to their home coun
try, explained Marvin Dansziger,
a Washington, D.C. attorney.
However, Dansziger said many
students may not return despite
the new Chinese government mea
sure. "Even if forced, a large per
centage will not go back to China,
preferring to go to countries such
as Canada and France, who will
readily accept them," Dansziger
said. Canada and France have less
stringent visa policies regarding
foreign scholars, he explained.
In response to the recall, Stan
ford recently defined a policy re
garding students here. Although
the University will not seek out
students on the lists, it will offer
assistance to students who request
help in talking with the U.S. gov
ernment, according to Marcia
Makino, foreign student adviser
at the Bechtel International Cen
ter.

Makino said the policy followed
the University's desire not to take
a stand either encouraging stu
dents to stay in the United States
or forcing the students to return
home. "Although I may disagree
with the policies, personal sym
pathies would be inappropriate for
me in this governmental policy,"
she added.

The University has no copy of
the Chinese government's lists
and will make no attempt to
procure one, Makino said. It re
mains unclear whether listed stu
dents themselves know that they
are included in the recall, but

Dansziger said most affected stu
dents would have been informed
somehow.

The students are being forced
home under a provision of their
J-l visas that affects students who
received financial support from
either the U.S. or Chinese gov
ernments. However, Dansziger
said "nearly 100 percent of the
students on the lists did not
receive governmental aid, [but
are] being funded by U.S. univer
sities."
Lau said he knew that at least

four Stanford students currently
receive major fellowships, and
that one student has received over
$lOO,OOO during his six years
here.

In addition to the financial aid
dispute, hardship is a second rea
son students are resisting the Chi
nese government's recall.
According to U.S. immigration
laws, a foreign visa holder may
be allowed to stay in the United
States through a hardship waiver
if significant hardship can be
proved.
However, Lau said the U.S. In
formation Agency, which is in
charge of student visas, is "ben
ding backward to accomodate
China and is rejecting all
waivers." He cited a case the
agency rejected as "insufficient
hardship" in which a Chinese stu
dent had married a U.S. citizen
and the couple had a child.
Lau said legislation is currently
pending in the U.S. Congress to
firmly define "sufficient
hardship" in order to limit the
agency's range of interpretation.
Dansziger said he believed that
students would not return home
because China was about 30 years
behind in research, and the stu
dents would feel frustrated.

ernments. However, Dansziger
said "nearly 100 percent of the
students on the lists did not
receive governmental aid, [but
are] being funded by U.S. univer
sities."
Lau said he knew that at least

four Stanford students currently
receive major fellowships, and
that one student has received over
$lOO,OOO during his six years
here.

In addition to the financial aid
dispute, hardship is a second rea
son students are resisting the Chi
nese government's recall.
According to U.S. immigration
laws, a foreign visa holder may
be allowed to stay in the United
States through a hardship waiver
if significant hardship can be
proved.
However, Lau said the U.S. In
formation Agency, which is in
charge of student visas, is "ben
ding backward to accomodate
China and is rejecting all
waivers." He cited a case the
agency rejected as "insufficient
hardship" in which a Chinese stu
dent had married a U.S. citizen
and the couple had a child.
Lau said legislation is currently
pending in the U.S. Congress to
firmly define "sufficient
hardship" in order to limit the
agency's range of interpretation.
Dansziger said he believed that
students would not return home
because China was about 30 years
behind in research, and the stu
dents would feel frustrated.

The students are
'some of the brightest
scholars in America,'
and China fears that
they will never return
to their home country.
