### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
The number two post at Stan
ford Hospital will be vacated at
the end of the year when William
Arnold, executive vice president
and chief operating officer, steps
down.
Arnold announced in a press
release last week that he will leave
Dec. 31 to become chief executive
officer of Parkview/Westside Med
ical Complex in Nashville, Tenn.,
a new branch of the medical care
giant, Hospital Corporation of
America.
No replacement has been found
yet, according to Hospital Presi
dent Sheldon King. After a na
tional search, King said, he hopes

to name Arnold's successor by
March.
"I regret leaving Stanford and
all my friends here," Arnold said
yesterday."I also feel a great an
ticipation of joining Hospital Cor
poration of America."
Arnold began work at the hospi
tal nine years ago as an assistant
director, after serving as assistant
administrator at Santa Barbara
Cottage Hospital. He achieved his

present post in February 1986
after a management reorganiza
tion.
Arnold obtained a master's
degree in hospital administration
from UCLA in 1974. As chief op
erating officer, Arnold tended the
hospital's daily business, includ
ing planning, program develop
ment and cost management.
Arnold said his two largest ac
complishments at the hospital
were introducing a "service excel
lence program" to improve the
"caring environment" there and
also maintaining the hospital's fi
nancial integrity.
Saying that job mobility is not
surprising in hospital manage
ment, King observed: "He has an
excellent background."

'I regret leaving
Stanford and all my
friends here.'
