# Technology and political relations are focus of Centennial conference
## 
### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
International leaders in govern
ment, industry and academics
came to Stanford last weekend to
discuss how advances in technol
ogy affect commercial and politi
cal relations between highly de
veloped economic powers and
newly industrializing countries.
Technical and policy specialists
flew here from as far away as
India and Hong Kong to take part
in "Technology Policy in the
Americas," a Centennial confer
ence sponsored by the Americas
Program at Stanford and the In
stitute of the Americas in La Jolla.
Innovations in high technology
are having profound, challenging
effects in the international eco
nomy, Food Research Institute
Prof. Clark Reynolds, an organ
izer of the conference, said Mon
day.
The conference focused on com
puter and telecommunication
technology and industry in Latin
America, Canada and the United
States.
"The potential for new technol
ogies will only be realized if there
is cooperation," said Reynolds.
"There is unlimited potential if

we work together."
Paul Boeker, president of the
Institute of the Americas and one
of the symposium's concluding
speakers, echoed Reynolds in his
final words: "The problem is not
to reconcile our differences, but
to work together for mutual ben
efit."
According to Reynolds, two
msyor threats to this cooperation
were addressed during the con
ference's series of presentations
and discussions.
First, there is "a fear in the
United States that if we let our
technology out of the bag" by
sharing new equipment and meth
ods, "we'll lose our leadership ir
revocably," he said.
Second, industrially developing
countries like Brazil often have
erected economic barriers —
tariffs and legal restrictions — to
nurture and protect their local
high-tech companies.
Leaders in these countries
worry that if they "open them
selves up" by dropping these
protections, giant multi-national
corporations from the West will
overwhelm their markets, snuff
ing out the smaller local compan
ies and forcing the countries into

technological dependence.
Latin American countries have
a "distinct bias against big busi
ness — especially big business
from the United States," said
Eugene Creighton, from IBM's
World Trade Americas Group, in
a presentation last Thursday.
There are, however, msgor in
centives for cooperation.
Developing nations want coun
tries such as the United States to
transfer technological advances to
them so that they can share in
the benefits of the inventions.
Western corporations would
like to expand their production to
developing countries in order to
take advantage of the inexpensive
labor and new markets they pro
vide.
A goal of the conference was to
develop methods of possible com
promise — policies acceptable to
the fears and interests of both
developing and developed.
Reynolds suggested that one
promising idea produced by the
meetings was that, for an in
dustrializing country, "some com
bination of initial protection and
increasing internal competition al
lows you to be eventually compet
itive internationally."
