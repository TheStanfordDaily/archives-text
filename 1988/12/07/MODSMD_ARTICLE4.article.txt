# Elway firing leads to speculation about new coach possibilities
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer With wire reports 
In the wake of Monday's firing
of Stanford football Coach Jack
Elway, Texas-El Paso's Bob Stull
and Jim Sochor of UC-Davis have
emerged as the leading candidates
to replace Elway for the 1989
season.
"The search for [Elway'si suc
cessor will begin immediately,"
Athletic Director Andy Geiger
said Monday.
Geiger's decision may have been
influenced by alumni donors to
the Athletic Department, as well
as player dissatisfaction with

various aspects of Elway's coach
ing.
While no list of candidates has
been announced, the early
favorites — at least in terms of
how frequently their names have
been publicly mentioned — are
Stull and Sochor.
In only Stull's third season, the
Miners have compiled a 10-2 mark
and are headed for the Indepen
dence Bowl. Stull is also consid
ered the leading candidate for the
head coaching vacancy at the Uni
versity of Missouri, but he has
made no comment about either
position and was unavailable last
night.
Sochor, the Aggies' coach for 19

seasons, is a
familiar name to
those following
Bay Area sports,
having been
linked to Stan
ford and UC-
Berkeley in ear
lier searches. Soc
hor was a leading
candidate for the

Cardinal post after the 1983
season — a job Elway won to
replace Paul Wiggin — and was
also one of the finalists when
Bruce Snyder was named Joe
Kapp's replacement at Cal prior
to the 1987 season.
Sochor released a statement yes

terday afternoon regarding the
opening. "I still have a great job
here at UC-Davis," he said. "It is
more of a question of what Stan
ford wants to do at this point. I
have not been contacted by Stan
ford at this point.... I would be
receptive to talking with Stanford
should they contact me."
Sochor has a 156-41-5 record at
Davis and has led the Aggies into
the NCAA Division II playoffs in
six of the past seven years. He
has never suffered a losing season
and has more Division II wins
than any other current coach at
that level.
Other candidates include Earle
Bruce and Dennis Erickson. Bruce

recorded a series of 9-3 seasons
for Ohio State before losing his
job in a controversial firing fol
lowing an 8-4 campaign. He is
currently coaching at the Univer
sity of Northern lowa.
Erickson turned around the
Washington State program and
was named Pacific 10 Conference
co-Coach of the Year this season
after leading the Cougars to an
8-3 record and a berth in the
Aloha Bowl, their first bowl bid
since 1981. Because of his success
at WSU, however, it is not thought
likely Erickson would choose to
leave Pullman for the Farm.
Erickson was the offensive co
ordinator under Elway at San

Jose State University from 1979
to 1981.
No matter who ends up at the
helm, one thing Elway's successor
will have to do is recruit, some
thing Elway was particularly
adept at, despite the University's
stringent entrance requirements.
At the time of his hiring Elway
said coaching was 80 percent
recruiting and 20 percent coach
ing.
It was in the 20 percent that
Elway came up short this season.
Stanford was in a position to win
10 games this year — all but the
Notre Dame game — but came


Elway
