# Elway firing leads to speculation about new coach possibilities
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer With wire reports 
In the wake of Monday's firing
of Stanford football Coach Jack
Elway, Texas-El Paso's Bob Stull
and Jim Sochor of UC-Davis have
emerged as the leading candidates
to replace Elway for the 1989
season.
"The search for [Elway'si suc
cessor will begin immediately,"
Athletic Director Andy Geiger
said Monday.
Geiger's decision may have been
influenced by alumni donors to
the Athletic Department, as well
as player dissatisfaction with

various aspects of Elway's coach
ing.
While no list of candidates has
been announced, the early
favorites — at least in terms of
how frequently their names have
been publicly mentioned — are
Stull and Sochor.
In only Stull's third season, the
Miners have compiled a 10-2 mark
and are headed for the Indepen
dence Bowl. Stull is also consid
ered the leading candidate for the
head coaching vacancy at the Uni
versity of Missouri, but he has
made no comment about either
position and was unavailable last
night.
Sochor, the Aggies' coach for 19

seasons, is a
familiar name to
those following
Bay Area sports,
having been
linked to Stan
ford and UC-
Berkeley in ear
lier searches. Soc
hor was a leading
candidate for the

Cardinal post after the 1983
season — a job Elway won to
replace Paul Wiggin — and was
also one of the finalists when
Bruce Snyder was named Joe
Kapp's replacement at Cal prior
to the 1987 season.
Sochor released a statement yes

terday afternoon regarding the
opening. "I still have a great job
here at UC-Davis," he said. "It is
more of a question of what Stan
ford wants to do at this point. I
have not been contacted by Stan
ford at this point.... I would be
receptive to talking with Stanford
should they contact me."
Sochor has a 156-41-5 record at
Davis and has led the Aggies into
the NCAA Division II playoffs in
six of the past seven years. He
has never suffered a losing season
and has more Division II wins
than any other current coach at
that level.
Other candidates include Earle
Bruce and Dennis Erickson. Bruce

recorded a series of 9-3 seasons
for Ohio State before losing his
job in a controversial firing fol
lowing an 8-4 campaign. He is
currently coaching at the Univer
sity of Northern lowa.
Erickson turned around the
Washington State program and
was named Pacific 10 Conference
co-Coach of the Year this season
after leading the Cougars to an
8-3 record and a berth in the
Aloha Bowl, their first bowl bid
since 1981. Because of his success
at WSU, however, it is not thought
likely Erickson would choose to
leave Pullman for the Farm.
Erickson was the offensive co
ordinator under Elway at San

Jose State University from 1979
to 1981.
No matter who ends up at the
helm, one thing Elway's successor
will have to do is recruit, some
thing Elway was particularly
adept at, despite the University's
stringent entrance requirements.
At the time of his hiring Elway
said coaching was 80 percent
recruiting and 20 percent coach
ing.
It was in the 20 percent that
Elway came up short this season.
Stanford was in a position to win
10 games this year — all but the
Notre Dame game — but came


Elway
up with only three wins.
Time and time again the Car
dinal would drive the ball to the
opponent's 10 yard line or so and
falter. Only nine points were
scored on four drives inside the
10 against Washington. First and
goal from the three against Wash
ington State in the last two
minutes without any points
scored. Numerous calls of run,
run, run and kick a field goal in
situations where a touchdown
would have later made the final
difference.
A common suggestion was that
Elway hire an offensive coordina
tor, something Stanford hasn't
had since Steve Axman left Stan
ford to become UCLA's offensive
coordinator in 1987. Elway
wanted to fill the role of offensive
coordinator himself, however, and
has thus become a target for all
those complaining about the Car
dinal's offensive problems. Axman
also has been mentioned by some
as a possible Elway replacement,
although UCLA's Sports Informa
tion Office insists that everything
is peachy there.
Like the offense, Stanford's de
fense has also had its problems.
Despite the presence of first-team
All-Pacific 10 Conference selec
tion Rob Hinckley and honorable
mention Jono Tunney in the
linebacking corps, teams com
pleted six- to eight-yard passes
almost all day, all season. Why

was no adjustment made to cor
rect this?
The biggest trouble may have
come from the players, however.
Elway apparently had problems
dealing with many members of
his team, especially quarterbacks
Jason Palumbis and Brian
Johnson. After a quarterback con
troversy in 1987, Elway began one
in 1988 by pulling Johnson at
halftime of the Notre Dame con
test.
Palumbis played well in the sec
ond half, well enough to win the
starting job. But in the second
quarter of the UCLA game five
weeks later, Elway pulled
Palumbis — he had completed
nine of 10 passes at the time —
in favor of Johnson.
Johnson led the team back to
take the lead, but Stanford
couldn't hold on and lost. The
following week Palumbis was the
starter again, although it seemed
the two players never really knew
why they were starting or being
benched.
This communication problem
culminated when a few players
met with Geiger after Big Game.
Geiger, Elway and the team met
on Friday, and Sunday a few
players met with Geiger to tell
him the players felt Elway was
not the solution. The following
day he lost his job.
"When a team as a whole goes
to the (Athletic Director) and says
there's a problem stemming from
the coach, then you have to make
a change," said junior cornerback
Alan Grant.

to the (Athletic Director) and says
there's a problem stemming from
the coach, then you have to make
a change," said junior cornerback
Alan Grant.
In the wake of Monday's firing
of Stanford football Coach Jack
Elway, Texas-El Paso's Bob Stull
and Jim Sochor of UC-Davis have
emerged as the leading candidates
to replace Elway for the 1989
season.
"The search for [Elway'si suc
cessor will begin immediately,"
Athletic Director Andy Geiger
said Monday.
Geiger's decision may have been
influenced by alumni donors to
the Athletic Department, as well
as player dissatisfaction with

various aspects of Elway's coach
ing.
While no list of candidates has
been announced, the early
favorites — at least in terms of
how frequently their names have
been publicly mentioned — are
Stull and Sochor.
In only Stull's third season, the
Miners have compiled a 10-2 mark
and are headed for the Indepen
dence Bowl. Stull is also consid
ered the leading candidate for the
head coaching vacancy at the Uni
versity of Missouri, but he has
made no comment about either
position and was unavailable last
night.
Sochor, the Aggies' coach for 19

seasons, is a
familiar name to
those following
Bay Area sports,
having been
linked to Stan
ford and UC-
Berkeley in ear
lier searches. Soc
hor was a leading
candidate for the

Cardinal post after the 1983
season — a job Elway won to
replace Paul Wiggin — and was
also one of the finalists when
Bruce Snyder was named Joe
Kapp's replacement at Cal prior
to the 1987 season.
Sochor released a statement yes

terday afternoon regarding the
opening. "I still have a great job
here at UC-Davis," he said. "It is
more of a question of what Stan
ford wants to do at this point. I
have not been contacted by Stan
ford at this point.... I would be
receptive to talking with Stanford
should they contact me."
Sochor has a 156-41-5 record at
Davis and has led the Aggies into
the NCAA Division II playoffs in
six of the past seven years. He
has never suffered a losing season
and has more Division II wins
than any other current coach at
that level.
Other candidates include Earle
Bruce and Dennis Erickson. Bruce

recorded a series of 9-3 seasons
for Ohio State before losing his
job in a controversial firing fol
lowing an 8-4 campaign. He is
currently coaching at the Univer
sity of Northern lowa.
Erickson turned around the
Washington State program and
was named Pacific 10 Conference
co-Coach of the Year this season
after leading the Cougars to an
8-3 record and a berth in the
Aloha Bowl, their first bowl bid
since 1981. Because of his success
at WSU, however, it is not thought
likely Erickson would choose to
leave Pullman for the Farm.
Erickson was the offensive co
ordinator under Elway at San

Jose State University from 1979
to 1981.
No matter who ends up at the
helm, one thing Elway's successor
will have to do is recruit, some
thing Elway was particularly
adept at, despite the University's
stringent entrance requirements.
At the time of his hiring Elway
said coaching was 80 percent
recruiting and 20 percent coach
ing.
It was in the 20 percent that
Elway came up short this season.
Stanford was in a position to win
10 games this year — all but the
Notre Dame game — but came


Elway
up with only three wins.
Time and time again the Car
dinal would drive the ball to the
opponent's 10 yard line or so and
falter. Only nine points were
scored on four drives inside the
10 against Washington. First and
goal from the three against Wash
ington State in the last two
minutes without any points
scored. Numerous calls of run,
run, run and kick a field goal in
situations where a touchdown
would have later made the final
difference.
A common suggestion was that
Elway hire an offensive coordina
tor, something Stanford hasn't
had since Steve Axman left Stan
ford to become UCLA's offensive
coordinator in 1987. Elway
wanted to fill the role of offensive
coordinator himself, however, and
has thus become a target for all
those complaining about the Car
dinal's offensive problems. Axman
also has been mentioned by some
as a possible Elway replacement,
although UCLA's Sports Informa
tion Office insists that everything
is peachy there.
Like the offense, Stanford's de
fense has also had its problems.
Despite the presence of first-team
All-Pacific 10 Conference selec
tion Rob Hinckley and honorable
mention Jono Tunney in the
linebacking corps, teams com
pleted six- to eight-yard passes
almost all day, all season. Why

was no adjustment made to cor
rect this?
The biggest trouble may have
come from the players, however.
Elway apparently had problems
dealing with many members of
his team, especially quarterbacks
Jason Palumbis and Brian
Johnson. After a quarterback con
troversy in 1987, Elway began one
in 1988 by pulling Johnson at
halftime of the Notre Dame con
test.
Palumbis played well in the sec
ond half, well enough to win the
starting job. But in the second
quarter of the UCLA game five
weeks later, Elway pulled
Palumbis — he had completed
nine of 10 passes at the time —
in favor of Johnson.
Johnson led the team back to
take the lead, but Stanford
couldn't hold on and lost. The
following week Palumbis was the
starter again, although it seemed
the two players never really knew
why they were starting or being
benched.
This communication problem
culminated when a few players
met with Geiger after Big Game.
Geiger, Elway and the team met
on Friday, and Sunday a few
players met with Geiger to tell
him the players felt Elway was
not the solution. The following
day he lost his job.
