# Completion date for Lomita Mall rolled back
## Continued delays prompt Stanford to assess damages to responsible contracting firm 
### Janine DeFao Staff writer 
The date for the completion of
the Lomita Mall construction,
which was originally planned for
the end of the summer and then
delayed until mid-December, has
been postponed yet again until
mid-January, according to Uni
versity Facilities Project Manager
John Kennedy.
The construction, located be
tween the west side of the Quad
and the Physics Tank and Varian
Physics Building, is one of six
phases in a $4.7 million project
to improve utilities in the area.
This segment, phase 2, is digging
trenches and laying utilities lines,
according to Kennedy.
Currently, the entire area be
tween the Quad and the physics
buildings has been blocked off ex
cept for two narrow paths, creat
ing an inconvenience for many
students and faculty.
An official for the company that
is contracted to do the work has
attributed the delay to the late
delivery of supplies that should
have arrived early this summer.
Lou Payne, project foreman for
Pacific Underground Construc
tion, said this was the same cause
of the original delay.
Kennedy, however, said that the
late supply delivery does not suf
ficiently explain the project's
delay, and Stanford has begun as

sessing damages against the firm.
The two parties had set an Oct.
20 deadline in their contract,
which contains a clause permit
ting the University to withhold
$500 a day for every day after
the deadline, Kennedy said.
If the contractor can provide
documentation to justify the time
extension, the money will be re
turned, Kennedy said. "But I
think he will have a difficult time
doing this," he added.
"The contractor has success
fully completed projects for us for
about five years. He just took on
a bigger job than he should have,"
Kennedy said, pointing out that
Stanford is somewhat responsible
because it should not have allowed
the firm to bid on this large-scale
project.
However, Kennedy said that the
problem was not being taken
seriously by the contractor, so the
University decided to "put [its]
foot down."
But he said that Stanford would
continue to use the contractor in
future projects.
Stanford is losing money be
cause of the cost of having Uni
versity personnel monitor the
construction for a longer period.
Kennedy said he was unsure
whether the liquidated damages
would cover these costs. He esti
mated that this $1.6 million phase
will now cost $1.7 million.
Increases in cost are not the

only problem, according to many
students. The limited access to
both the Physics Tank and the
Varian Physics Building have
greatly inconvenienced some.
"This is just another example
of the University hiring incompe
tent construction firms," said
sophomore John Manning. He
added, "It's really absurd to have
500 people rushing through [the
narrow pedestrian and bicycle
path] at one time."

Asst. Physics Prof. Zein-Eddine
Meziani, who teaches in Varian,
said that his class has not been
interrupted by noise from the con
struction. "The inconvenience is
really nothing compared to what
they are trying to do," he said.
Physics Prof. Doug Osheroff,
who teaches in the Physics Tank,
agreed that the noise is not af
fecting classes. He added, "The
points where you can cross are
reasonably convenient."
