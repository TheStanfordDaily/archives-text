## Cardinal easily captures Apple Invitational 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
You just wanted to call for a
medic, or an ambulance, or some
thing.
The offenses of Cornell and
Colorado State were laid out on
the Maples Pavilion floor this
weekend and they just couldn't
breathe. They were being suf
focated. It was frightening.

You might have tried to shield
your eyes, but nothing could have
hid the defensive dominance of
the Stanford men's basketball
team as it stifled all comers into
submission and won the fifth an
nual Apple Invitational, held Fri
day and Saturday.
Stanford (3-2, ranked 30th by
the Associated Press) throttled
the Big Red of Cornell 90-45 Fri
day, and then wore down the
Colorado St. Rams (3-1) 63-49 in
the championship Saturday to win
its tourney for the fourth time.
Pacific (2-2) blew open a close
game in the second half to beat
Cornell (1-3) 90-76 and take third
place honors.
Stanford All-America candidate
Todd Lichti scored 42 points and
grabbed 10 rebounds in the two
games to take tourney MVP
honors for the second straight
year.
Stanford bit into the Apple by
blasting out to a 27-2 lead against
Cornell, which didn't even register
its first field goal until a six-foot
baseline jumper by Paul Mcßae
(17 points) with 8:40 to go in the
half. The shot drew cheers from
the standing Stanford student sec
tion.
The Big Red finally hit double
figures on a free throw by Shawn
with 27 seconds left in
the first half, but a layup by Stan
ford senior Howard Wright closed
out the opening stanza by giving
Stanford a 48-10 lead.
Cornell made three baskets in
21 attempts in the first half —
14.3 percent.

"It's obvious that this was a
men-against-boys situation," Cor
nell Coach Mike Dement said.
The Cardinal built the lead up
to 70-17 on a baseline drive by
Wright with 10:24 remaining in
the game, and seemed on its way
to its largest victory ever. But
Stanford coasted from there, and
a 65-point win over Duquesne in
1937-38 still reigns supreme.
Though the score was closer
against Colorado St., which
dropped to 45th in the latest AP
poll, the defense was hardly less
dominating, as Stanford held its
opponent under 20 in the first
half for the second straight night.
Rams Coach Boyd Grant
figured his only way to stay with
Stanford was to slow down the
tempo, and it was working for a
while. With over seven minutes
elapsed, the game was tied at just
6-6.
But then Wright scored twice
in a row on a baseline drive and
a slam dunk, and then forced
Rams forward Pat Durham into
a missed shot. Before you knew
it, Stanford had made a 9-0 run,
and the 911 calls were going out
for Colorado St.
Though Stanford as a team
played exceptional defense,
Wright definitely deserved special
mention for shutting down Dur
ham, who had scored 27, 27 and
28 in his previous three games.
Wright repeatedly denied Durham
the ball, and when he got it, forced
him into impossible shots. Dur
ham finished with four points.
"Durham is an excellent player
and Howard just took him out of
the game," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said, adding that
pressure on the Colorado St.
guards was also key.
After trailing 32-17 at halftime,
Colorado St. was hanging in at
40-25 before the Stanford back
court put the game on ice for good.
Lichti hit an 18-foot baseline
jumper, and after teammate Terry
Taylor forced Lynn Tryon into a
traveling violation, Lichti came
back and drove along the baseline
to a slam dunk.
Taylor then made a steal, and
on the ensuing fast break Lichti

pulled up for a short bank snot
that made it 46-25 and sent the
Rams into a time out.
Grant later illustrated how
swarming Stanford's attack
looked when he asked, "Is the
floor smaller here?"
And though Colorado State
finished the game by outscoring
Stanford 13-4 to make the final
score closer; by then Durham was
on the bench and Grant was using
the time to experiment with other
players.
"Durham was sick at halftime,"
Grant said. "When I didn't feel
he was playing well, Durham be
came my assistant in the second
half."
Basically, according to Grant,
there was nothing that Durham
was going to do to change the
outcome of the game.
"Stanford was tough," Grant
said. "I think when you play de
fense like Stanford plays it you
always have a chance to be a
champion."
After consecutive losses to big
name schools Indiana and No. 10
North Carolina, that's an encour
aging sign for Stanford.
Card notes
Lichti was joined on the all-tourney
team by Pacific guard Chris Fox (39
points and 12 rebounds), Rams for
ward Pat Durham (28 points and 8
rebounds against Pacific Friday) and
Stanford teammates Taylor (15 as
sists), Adam Keefe (11 rebounds) and
Wright (26 points, 14 rebounds).
Right now, Stanford's Achilles's
heel is free-throw shooting. After
going 7-for-14 against Cornell and 12-
for-21 against Colorado St., Stanford
is shooting 62.8 percent from the line
this year. By comparison, the Cardinal
hits 51.9 percent of its 3-point at
tempts (28-for-54).
Sophomore guard John Patrick tied
career highs in points (six on two
3-pointers) and rebounds (two) and
set a career high of two assists against
Cornell. Also, Keefe's 10 points estab
lished a career high, and Scott
Meinert's six assists tied his single
game milestone in that category Fri
day.

North Carolina, that's an encour
aging sign for Stanford.
Card notes
Lichti was joined on the all-tourney
team by Pacific guard Chris Fox (39
points and 12 rebounds), Rams for
ward Pat Durham (28 points and 8
rebounds against Pacific Friday) and
Stanford teammates Taylor (15 as
sists), Adam Keefe (11 rebounds) and
Wright (26 points, 14 rebounds).
Right now, Stanford's Achilles's
heel is free-throw shooting. After
going 7-for-14 against Cornell and 12-
for-21 against Colorado St., Stanford
is shooting 62.8 percent from the line
this year. By comparison, the Cardinal
hits 51.9 percent of its 3-point at
tempts (28-for-54).
Sophomore guard John Patrick tied
career highs in points (six on two
3-pointers) and rebounds (two) and
set a career high of two assists against
Cornell. Also, Keefe's 10 points estab
lished a career high, and Scott
Meinert's six assists tied his single
game milestone in that category Fri
day.

Freshman forward Julie Zeilstra, a member of the
nation's best recruiting class, leads the Cardinal
into a busy winter break schedule.
You just wanted to call for a
medic, or an ambulance, or some
thing.
The offenses of Cornell and
Colorado State were laid out on
the Maples Pavilion floor this
weekend and they just couldn't
breathe. They were being suf
focated. It was frightening.

You might have tried to shield
your eyes, but nothing could have
hid the defensive dominance of
the Stanford men's basketball
team as it stifled all comers into
submission and won the fifth an
nual Apple Invitational, held Fri
day and Saturday.
Stanford (3-2, ranked 30th by
the Associated Press) throttled
the Big Red of Cornell 90-45 Fri
day, and then wore down the
Colorado St. Rams (3-1) 63-49 in
the championship Saturday to win
its tourney for the fourth time.
Pacific (2-2) blew open a close
game in the second half to beat
Cornell (1-3) 90-76 and take third
place honors.
Stanford All-America candidate
Todd Lichti scored 42 points and
grabbed 10 rebounds in the two
games to take tourney MVP
honors for the second straight
year.
Stanford bit into the Apple by
blasting out to a 27-2 lead against
Cornell, which didn't even register
its first field goal until a six-foot
baseline jumper by Paul Mcßae
(17 points) with 8:40 to go in the
half. The shot drew cheers from
the standing Stanford student sec
tion.
The Big Red finally hit double
figures on a free throw by Shawn
with 27 seconds left in
the first half, but a layup by Stan
ford senior Howard Wright closed
out the opening stanza by giving
Stanford a 48-10 lead.
Cornell made three baskets in
21 attempts in the first half —
14.3 percent.

"It's obvious that this was a
men-against-boys situation," Cor
nell Coach Mike Dement said.
The Cardinal built the lead up
to 70-17 on a baseline drive by
Wright with 10:24 remaining in
the game, and seemed on its way
to its largest victory ever. But
Stanford coasted from there, and
a 65-point win over Duquesne in
1937-38 still reigns supreme.
Though the score was closer
against Colorado St., which
dropped to 45th in the latest AP
poll, the defense was hardly less
dominating, as Stanford held its
opponent under 20 in the first
half for the second straight night.
Rams Coach Boyd Grant
figured his only way to stay with
Stanford was to slow down the
tempo, and it was working for a
while. With over seven minutes
elapsed, the game was tied at just
6-6.
But then Wright scored twice
in a row on a baseline drive and
a slam dunk, and then forced
Rams forward Pat Durham into
a missed shot. Before you knew
it, Stanford had made a 9-0 run,
and the 911 calls were going out
for Colorado St.
Though Stanford as a team
played exceptional defense,
Wright definitely deserved special
mention for shutting down Dur
ham, who had scored 27, 27 and
28 in his previous three games.
Wright repeatedly denied Durham
the ball, and when he got it, forced
him into impossible shots. Dur
ham finished with four points.
"Durham is an excellent player
and Howard just took him out of
the game," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said, adding that
pressure on the Colorado St.
guards was also key.
After trailing 32-17 at halftime,
Colorado St. was hanging in at
40-25 before the Stanford back
court put the game on ice for good.
Lichti hit an 18-foot baseline
jumper, and after teammate Terry
Taylor forced Lynn Tryon into a
traveling violation, Lichti came
back and drove along the baseline
to a slam dunk.
Taylor then made a steal, and
on the ensuing fast break Lichti

pulled up for a short bank snot
that made it 46-25 and sent the
Rams into a time out.
Grant later illustrated how
swarming Stanford's attack
looked when he asked, "Is the
floor smaller here?"
And though Colorado State
finished the game by outscoring
Stanford 13-4 to make the final
score closer; by then Durham was
on the bench and Grant was using
the time to experiment with other
players.
"Durham was sick at halftime,"
Grant said. "When I didn't feel
he was playing well, Durham be
came my assistant in the second
half."
Basically, according to Grant,
there was nothing that Durham
was going to do to change the
outcome of the game.
"Stanford was tough," Grant
said. "I think when you play de
fense like Stanford plays it you
always have a chance to be a
champion."
