# Forward Wright shines on defense

### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Statistically speaking, Stan
ford's Todd Lichti was a worthy
winner of the fifth-annual Apple
Invitational's MVP award. The
senior shooting guard scored 42
points and pulled down 10
rebounds as the Cardinal won
both games in convincing fashion.
As is often the case, however,
statistics don't tell the whole
story. In Saturday night's contest,
Stanford faced a tough Colorado
State team led by NBA-prospect
Pat Durham.
If the Cardinal had failed to do
a better job shutting down Dur
ham than the University of the
Pacific had done Friday (allowing
him to score 28 points), Stanford
could very well have been the
runner-up in the tournament.
But shut down Durham they
did — or more specifically, he did.
Nope, not MVP Lichti but senior
forward Howard Wright.
Maybe it would be more accu
rate to say Wright chewed up Dur
ham and spit him out.
After scoring 82 points in his
previous three games, Durham
was held to just four points on
l-of-6 shooting. Mere numbers,
however, don't explain how
thoroughly Wright dominated
Durham. Consider this partial
list:
• With 16:45 to go in the first
half, Durham finally gets the ball
down low. Wright is on him like
a blanket, yet somehow Durham
sinks an improbable shot. It will
turn out to be his only field goal
of the evening.
• With 10:52 left, Wright again
forces Durham into a bad shot,
and he misses it. Stanford has a
4-0 run going.
• Two minutes and 42 seconds
later, Durham again takes a bad
shot near the blocks. The four
point run has ballooned into a 9-0
run.
• Undaunted, Durham again
gets the ball with 5:08 remaining.
He tries to get around Wright.
There's no daylight and Durham
takes an impossible 15-foot fall
away jumper. No good.
• Twenty seconds after the in
termission, Colorado State throws
up an alley-oop intended for Dur
ham. Wright intercepts.
• With 17:46 to play, Wright
tips a pass intended for Durham.
It goes out of bounds off Dur
ham's fingers. Stanford ball.
• Forty-five seconds later,
Terry Taylor fouls Durham. He
sinks both free throws, bringing
his point total to four. A few
minutes later he's taken out of
the game for good.

Whew!
"Basically, coming into the
game we didn't want him (Dur
ham) to touch the ball, period,"
Wright said. "[We wanted tol
make sure that every point, he
had to bleed for."
"I figured they would come out
and try to play tough defense, but
God, I didn't expect anything like
that," a subdued Durham said af
terwards. "It wasn't just me; they
put pressure on all of us."
Wright said he hadn't really
done anything special to prepare
for Durham. "[Other times] I've
thought I've played good defense
and the guy scored 16 points,"
Wright said.
For good measure, he chipped
in 26 points and 14 boards in the
Apple. If the trophy had been
awarded to Wright instead of
Lichti, it's unlikely anyone would
have complained.
