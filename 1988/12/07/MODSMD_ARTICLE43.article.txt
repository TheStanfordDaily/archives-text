# Spikers in West Regional battle
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
A little history: Two years ago, the
Stanford women's volleyball team
traveled to Brigham Young to compete
in the West Regional. BYU was ranked
No. 1 in the final poll of the season,
the Cardinal 11th, and a fifth straight
Final Four appearance seemed out of
reach for the Stanford spikers.
Stanford won. Stanford went to the
Final Four. The Cougars watched it on
ESPN.
Two years later, only the opponent
and the ranking have changed. Return
ing to the regional round of the NCAA
Tournament for an unprecedented
eighth straight time, No. 2 Stanford
will face Washington Friday night for
a chance to face the host and top seed
of the West Regional, undefeated and
top-ranked UCLA, for yet another Final
Four appearance.
Match time Friday is tentatively
slotted for 8 p.m., but the first ball
won't be served until 45 minutes after
the conclusion of the UCLA-BYU con
test at 6. Regardless of the starting
time, KZSU-90.1 FM will broadcast all
the action live from Pauley Pavilion, as
well as the 7:30 final on Saturday.
Assuming that Stanford will automat
ically be in the Saturday match, how
ever, is a hasty decision indeed. Al
though the Cardinal has reached the
final for the past seven years and won
it six times, the Huskies have proven
to be the dark-horse team of the year
that has been upset-bent from the start
of the season.

In the preseason Pacific 10 Confer
ence poll, the league coaches predicted
that Washington,' with a new coach at
the helm in former Oregon asst. Debbie
Buse, would finish Pac-10 play in ninth
place. The Huskies felt otherwise,
notching a convincing third-place finish
even with two losses at the hands of
the Cardinal and closing its regular
season ranked ninth nationally.
"I expect a tough match," Stanford
Coach Don Shaw said. "They're going
to be real tough, because they don't like
us. For some reason, they really get
fired up to play against us, and they're
in that position where they've gone far
ther than they've ever gone before.
"They've got absolutely nothing to
lose. We're expected to win this match
and everybody is looking forward to that
Stanford-UCIA. matchup in the regional
finals. Well, that works to Washington's
advantage. We have to make sure that
we don't take them lightly."
Based on Washington's first round
performance at Seattle — where they
upended Arizona State 15-11, 15-10, 15-
11 — the Cardinal has ample cause for
concern. All-Pac-10 hitter Laurie Wetzel
continued her kills campaign by garner
ing a match-high 17 along with 12 digs
and three blocks.
Complementing her efforts was
Kayley Grim, a swift southpaw who re
corded 15 kills and a .333 hitting per
centage. A right-side player, Grim will
provide an ample matchup for either of
Stanford's left-side hitters, senior Amy
Hayes or Pac-10 Freshman of the Year
Kristin Klein.
"Grim's a good player," Shaw said.

"They went to her quite a bit against
us, as I recall. She's probably second
for them in terms of spike attempts,
and is their second-best hitter next to
Wetzel.
"She's someone we definitely need to
keep an eye on, especially because they
will probably try to attack us from their
right side. She's a key player for their
team."
But the most interesting matchup will
be at setter, pitting All-Pac-10 Melinda
Beckenhauer against Stanford's Lara
Asper. Two of the league's shrewdest
play-callers and most aggressive
defenders, the pair should make the
match an offensive extravaganza.
Asper, spending her first year at start
ing setter, made the most of her debut
by finishing the year ranked second in
the league in assists and ninth nation
ally. The junior also rates third on the
Cardinal in both digging and blocking.
Beckenhauer, a native of Mountain
View who transferred from defending
national champion Hawaii two years
ago, is another junior who made a name
for herself this year. Technically sound,
she runs a smooth offense that is
suitably deceptive even with only two
dominant outside hitters.
"She's a real battler, too," Shaw
noted. "She's really competitive and
she's really strong physically up at the
net. Whenever she attacks, she does it
with authority."
Sounds like Stanford's starting hit
ters. Supporting the clutch killer Hayes
and the prolific pounder Klein, right-


Michael Topolovac — Dally
Lara Asper and the Cardinal recovered from this surprise spike to advance to the
West Regional, to be held this weekend in Los Angeles.
