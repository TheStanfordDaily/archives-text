# Men's hoops won't get much rest over Christmas break

### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
By the time the next issue of The Daily
comes out, the Stanford men's basketball
team could be entrenched as a top-20
team — or have disappeared from the
rankings altogether.
The 30th-ranked Cardinal plays eight
games between now and Jan. 9, including
four Pacific 10 Conference games, three
against Associated Press top-40 oppo
nents: Oregon State, UCLA and Arizona.
Stanford also plays at St. Mary's, con
sidered a co-favorite with Loyola Mary
mount in the West Coast Athletic Con
ference, and might play Vanderbilt, which
upset No. 15 Louisville last month, in
the Music City Invitational in Nashville,
Tenn.
Here's a rundown of the schedule:
San Jose State at Maples Pavilion
Dec. 10, 7:35 p.m.
The Spartans were a 14-15 team last

year in the Pacific Coast Athletic Con
ference (renamed the Big West this year),
and that was with 1988 Sacramento King
first-round draft pick Ricky Berry.
This year, the Spartans are led by
senior guard Steve Haney, who is averag
ing 23 points per game. SJSU, 2-1 going
into Monday night's game at Creighton,
suffered its first loss of the season in
bizarre fashion. Despite leading Nebraska
Saturday with six minutes remaining,
SJSU ended up losing by 14, 90-76.
Oregon State at Maples Pavilion
Dec. 17, 7:35 p.m.
No. 33 Oregon State (2-0) comes into
Stanford to open the Pac-10 season
looking even better than expected, due
to the surprising emergence of freshman
Yugoslavian import Teo Alibegovic, who
is notching 20 ppg.
Guards Eric Knox and Gary Payton
are each averaging 16.5 ppg, and in ad
dition, Payton is averaging 10 assists, 8
rebounds and 3.5 steals per game. Ad

mittedly, these numbers have been built
up against Portland and Kansas State,
but there's no denying Stanford has a
tough opponent for its Pac-10 opener.
UCLA at Los Angeles
Dec. 23, 8:30 p.m.
Television — ESPN
Stanford has never won at Pauley Pa
vilion since it opened in 1965, and though
this year's Cardinal is more likely than
ever to break that streak, the beginnings
of a renaissance are rumbling down
south.
The Bruins' only senior starter, Pooh
Richardson, is passing off a cool 9.7 as
sists per game. Junior forward Trevor
Wilson is at 16.7 ppg, 10.3 rpg and junior
center Kevin Walker is at 16 ppg, 7 rpg.
But leading everybody is freshman-par
excellence Don Mac Lean (22.3 ppg, 9.3
rpg). After romping in its first four
games, UCLA is No. 21 with a bullet.
St. Mary's at Moraga
Dcc. 27, 7:30 p.m.

The ultimate season-long battle be
tween offense and defense is being waged
in the WCAC, where St. Mary's counters
No. 25 LMU's point-a-minute attack with
one of the nation's best defenses. Going
into Tuesday night's game against U.S.
International, St. Mary's had only al
lowed 53.7 points per game in posting a
3-0 record.
Like Stanford, St. Mary's boasts a
gaggle of senior returnees. Like Stanford,
St. Mary's won at Montana earlier this
year. Like Stanford, St. Mary's has the
chance to win any game it plays.
Music City Invitational at Nashville
Dcc. 29 — Furman
Dec. 30 — Colgate or Vanderbilt
Furman's Paladins finished second in
the Southern Conference last year, and
went 18-10 overall. They are led by 5-
foot-10, 152-pound senior mighty-mite
David Brown.
Don't expect Stanford to play the Red
Raiders of Colgate, who have gone 4-23

each of the last two seasons and are 0-4
this year. Vanderbilt has weathered a
tough early schedule with a 2-3 record,
including its 65-62 win over Louisville.
Arizona at Maples Pavilion
Jan. 5, 8:00 p.m.
Television — ESPN
The 2-1 Wildcats moved into the top
10 despite losing 79-72 to North Carolina
last weekend at the Charlotte Tourna
ment of Champions. It helped that they
beat 26th-ranked Temple, which replaced
Arizona as the nation's No. 1 team last
year after the Miracle at Maples.
All-America candidate Sean Elliott is
averaging 17 points and 7.7 rebounds per
game, with Anthony Cook coming in at
13.3 and 8. Also, many might not have
expected junior Jud Buechler to be con
tributing, but he's nabbing 7.3 boards in
the early going.
Arizona has a chance to avenge each
of its losses during last year's 35-
3, Final-Four campaign. It beat
New Mexico Nov. 30, 80-67, and
also meets Oklahoma Feb. 12.
Arizona State at Maples Pavilion
Jan. 7, 1:00 p.m.
The Sun Devils (3-1) are living
it up during their pre-conference
schedule, averaging over 94 points
per outing. Their only loss has
been 84-83 to Alabama in over
time. This pace figures to slow
once Pac-10 play starts.
Still, junior guard Tarence
Wheeler is getting 22.5 ppg, and
ASU has three players with over
seven rebounds per game: Mark
Becker (8.5), junior redshirt Alex
Austin (8.3) and Trent Edwards
(7.8).
