# Chaffee is a spiking force

It is certainly appropriate that
Jennifer Chaffee likes David
Bowie's music, because no one on
the Stanford women's volleyball
team has gone through more
"Changes" than Chaffee.
Recruited out of high school as
a middle blocker but moved to
the left side by the Cardinal
coaches last year, the junior has
settled into the starting right-side
hitter spot this season and become
one of the team's most consistent
and potent players.
She is also one of the main
reasons that Stanford is entering
the NCAA West Regional this
weekend with a chance to take it
all, becoming an unwitting star
on a balanced team that insists
it has no stars.
Beginning with an amazing off
the-bench performance in last
year's NCAA semifinal match —
where she almost single-handedly
pulled the Cardinal past Texas
and into the national champion
ship match with Hawaii — and
continuing through a 1988 season
highlighted by Pacific 10 Confer
ence Player of the Week honors,
Chaffee has steadily improved
into one of the best right-side
players in the nation.
Three years ago, this claim
would have seemed the overly op
timistic rantings of someone
biased by Chaffee's lively and en
dearing personality. But after add
ing steady ball-handling skills and
sure setting to an already strong
repertoire of hitting and blocking,
Chaffee's play brings as many
smiles as her jovial nature.
All this from a player who, until
this season, disliked playing the
position she now excels in — yet
another change for the trans

planted Colorado Springs native.
"I love the right side," Chaffee
says of her new-found niche. "It's
kind of a surprise attack, that's
what it is. Not very many teams
expect it, so I get one blocker up
to 80 percent of the time, and
that's when I just swing away. I
always have some sort of hole,
especially the way Lara (Asper)
sets.
"(The) right side is thought of
as a place to put middle blockers
that didn't make it," she adds.
"They're big and they put up a
really big block out there. But
we've turned it into a third of our
attack instead of an eighth of our
attack."
Indeed, rather than get sucked
into the black hole located oppo
site the setter on a coach's lineup
card, Chaffee has added a new
dimension to the position. With a
back row attack as but one of the
new facets Chaffee has brought
to the Cardinal, it is impossible
to categorize her as a washed-up
middle blocker that just couldn't
cut the mustard of collegiate com
petition.
"I'll tell you, I feel like a winner,
because middle blocker just didn't
click with me," Chaffee enthusi
astically explains. "I played
middle in high school and it was
a different paradigm, basically.
Here (as a Stanford middle block
er) I have 14 things to look at,
and I just couldn't do it. Right
side has a few things to concen
trate on, and that's it."
One of the most important
things she has focused on is the
aforementioned back-row option
that Stanford has often employed
this year. A good hitter at the
net, Chaffee has turned out to be
equally effective from behind the
10-foot line, making her an eligi
ble hitter in every rotation instead

of restricting her hitting to front
row appearances.
To say the least, the results
have been striking and successful.
Few teams expected the back-row
barrages Chaffee unleashed
throughout the season, leaving
her an open net and a free choice
of hitting angles on almost every
back-row outing. More often than
not, Chaffee's response has been
a resounding kill.
Like most of her volleyball
landmarks, Chaffee initiated her
behind-the-line attack in a
competition, when Stanford be
came the first team in 103
matches to sweep the University
of the Pacific Tigers, one of the
Cardinal's arch rivals, in three
games at UOP's Spanos Center.
"I think that pretty much de
veloped in a game where we
weren't passing well," Chaffee
recalls. "Lara had to set it up
somewhere-we didn't have a four
hitter (on the left side), so she
gave it back to me. I think in the
UOP match I played out of my
mind, I didn't know what hap
pened, but that's when it really
became a part of our attack."
Pacific may have been sur
prised, but not Stanford Coach
Don Shaw.
Though most members of the
volleyball world only discovered
Chaffee's talents this year, Shaw
saw the makings of a stellar player
when he recruited her four years
ago.
Most obviously an asset is her
height, all 6-foot-2 of it. Coupled
with a good vertical leap, Chaffee
can hit over many blockers while
forming a solid block of her own.
Add speed and agility to the pic
ture, and the ingredients for
greatness are all there at Chaf-

Jennifer Chaffee has blossomed this season as the Cardinal's right-side hitter. The junior is second
on the team in kills, with 322, and is hitting .284 for the year.
fee's disposal.
But it is her mentality that has
evoked the greatest changes.
Always academically adept, the
anthropology mtyor has gained an
increased understanding of her
sport and a positive change in at
titude over the past several years
that has helped her succeed off
the court as well as on it.
"Her practice habits and her
work ethic have changed since
she's been here at Stanford,"
Shaw says."In her first two years
she wasn't that consistent in her
effort — not that she wasn't al
ways trying, but she would get
down on herself.
"Since last off-season, she's de
veloped a work habit where she's
hungry, plays well, concentrates

and doesn't get down when things
aren't going right. I think that's
been the key to her blossoming."
In the whirlwind of adjustment,
however, her personality has re
mained constant. Armed with a
gentle wit and soothing demeanor,
Chaffee earned the repect of her
teammates long before her play
commanded it.
"I know the players really eryoy
being around her," Stanford Asst.
Coach Ruben Nieves says. "She's
a fun person to be around."
With Chaffee's motivation and
talents that blend well with the
other five starter's strengths, the
Cardinal could go far indeed. With
a seventh consecutive appearance
at the Final Four on the line this
weekend in Los Angeles, Stanford
could finally win the national
championship it has yet to claim.
For Chaffee, that would be the
nicest change of all.
