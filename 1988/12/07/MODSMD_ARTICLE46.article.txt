# Stanford, Arizona vie for Pac-10 title
## 
### 
Stanford and Oregon State officially open
the Pacific 10 Conference men's basketball
season Dec. 17 at 7:35 p.m. at Maples
Pavilion.
The 1988-89 Pac-10 is easily divisible
into four groups. USC, Oregon and Arizona State are
all depleted by graduation and/or lack of recruiting,
and are at least two years from contending. Washing
ton and Washington State are closer, but their role
in the race will be limited to that of spoiler. None of
these five can win the conference.
Oregon State, UCLA and California each have
great starting lineups that could help them make a
run for the title, but probably lack the depth to
withstand a grueling race. That leaves Arizona and
Stanford.
Arizona lost a huge chunk of last year's conference
championship team, but the Wildcats were so good
last year that they still have to be considered the
team to beat. Stanford's ability to overtake Arizona
will depend on how well Coach Mike Montgomery
can manipulate the deepest team in the Pac-10.
