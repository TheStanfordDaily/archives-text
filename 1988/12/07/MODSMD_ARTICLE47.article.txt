Best combination of forwards in the conference in likely
All-American Sean "Cobra" Elliott and Anthony Cook.
Arizona also boasts a capable point guard in Ken
Lofton, and size at center in Mark Georgeson and Sean
Rooks (both 6-foot-10). Coach Lute Olson is the Tara
VanDerveer of men's basketball — turning Arizona
around from a 4-24 season in 1982-83.
Todd Lichti (21.2 ppg this year) has already shown the
benefits of his summer Olympic trials experience. Eric
Reveno, if he can avoid injury, leads a deep, bruising
front line. Even with the loss of Oliver Cunningham (left
team), Stanford's talent goes 11 deep — all the way to
John Patrick. Stanford has the ability to play an
absolutely stifling defense.
Guard Gary Payton, who has already recorded the
Pac-10's second triple-double in history (20 points, 14
rebounds and 11 assists vs. Portland Nov. 26), could
easily take the Pac-10 Player-of-the-Year Award from
Elliott or Lichti. Backcourt partner Eric Knox also does
well in all three departements. And the team, which last
year had no starter taller than 6-6, has added some size.
However. . .
Bruin 6-10 forward Don Mac Lean has already clinched
the 1989 Pac-10 Freshman-of-the-Year award. He and
forward Trevor Wilson will probably average 40-45
points and 20-25 rebounds per game. Sophomore
Kevin Williams has come out of nowhere to be the
team's shooting guard, and another freshman phenom,
Darrick Martin, will be a fine third guard. Kevin Walker
gives the Bruins 3-point shooting ability at center, for
what that's worth.
Those five returning starters do not include forward
Leonard Taylor, who missed 1 Vfc seasons due to back
and foot injuries but who will single-handedly take the
Bears from 20 losses to 20 wins. He grabbed 15
rebounds in leading Cal over then-No. 15 Florida Nov.
25. Keith Smith is an underrated point guard.
Great outside shooting led by David Sanders and Brian
Wright, the inside play of forward Neil Evans and the
return of injured Brian Quinnett (16.5 ppg, 5.2 rpg in
1986-87) lead the arsenal of the new Wizard of
Washington, 33-year-old Coach Kelvin Sampson.
Best tandem of stars in the second division with
AII-Pac-10 guard Eldridge Recasner and 1987-88
Freshman-of-the-Year Mike Hayward.
Oregon has better depth than the Washington schools.
Three senior starters, led by guard Frank Johnson and
forward Randy Grant will try to keep the Ducks over
.500.
Guard Anthony Pendleton has displayed early scoring
punch and Ronnie Coleman shows no signs of tailing
off from his all-frosh season. Almost-a-Cardinal
forward/center Chris Munk has put his academic
probation problems behind him.
Tarence Wheeler may end up doubling his 1987-88
averages of 10.8 ppg, 4.4 apg. The Sun Devils also have
size and talent in 6-11 sophomore Emory Lewis and 6-9
junior Mark Becker.

Huge losses in talent, experience and leadership with
the graduation of guards Steve Kerr and Craig McMillan,
and center Tom Tolbert. Particularly lacking proven
scoring ability at center. Bench is not deep, but with this
team, it doesn't really need to be.
♦
Despite last year's win over Arizona, Stanford has not
proven its ability to win tough games, especially on the
road, on a consistent basis. Perhaps a stronger press is
needed. Perhaps it's just that the Cardinal needs to
shake its perpetual underdog psychology. But the only
team that usually beats Stanford is itself.
Bill Sherwood may have been outsized but was rarely
outclassed at center last year, so replacing him won't
make the Beavers better. Coach Ralph Miller still has a
dubious bench, but then again, he knocked Stanford
out of second place at Maples last season by playing
his starters for 40 minutes. Besides Payton and Knox,
the team is relatively inexperienced.
If Gerald Madkins, a starter as a freshman last year,
hadn't suffered a season-ending pelvic fracture in a car
accident, and if Pooh Richardson ever consistently usee
his enormous talent to take over a game, UCLA could
make a claim for the best backcourt in the nation. As it
is, the Bruins can't. And Kevin Walker is a 3-point
shooter at center, for what that's worth.
Cal is definitely weaker at shooting guard then the first
four teams in the conference. Despite being named to
the Pac-10 all-frosh team last year, Ryan Drew needs to
provide more consistency there. Also, it may be hard to
completely erase the memory of tying for last in the
Pac-10 last year.
No true center after the graduation of 7-0 Todd
Anderson, no bench to speak of and, even more than
Cal, does not match up well against the top Pac-10
teams.
Washington also lacks a true center. If 6-10 sophomore
Todd Lautenbach can't fill the bill, it will be up to 6-7
Mark West — which may be too much responsibility for
him.
The only solace the Ducks can take in losing No. 7
all-time Pac-10 scorer Anthony Taylor is that he is now
playing for a worse team (the Miami Heat). The Ducks
simply lack the star quality of their northern neighbors.
No point guard, no team leader, no good percentage
shooters and, even though 93,829 USC-Notre Dame
fans were given free admission to that night's USC
home hoops game, the attendance was a stark 875.
The losses of guard Arthur Thomas and forward Eric
Holloway, with no one on the bench to come close to
replacing them, could not have come at a worse time fo
ASU.

This team may have some trouble early, so look for a
repeat of the Miracle at Maples on Jan. 5. But Olson
should have the team jelled by the end of the season,
and Elliott turned down first-round NBA stardom just to
go for the championship — the NCAA Championship.
The Cobra will do as he pleases this year.
The deepest talent and most experience make Stanford
the best team on paper in the Pac-10. As The Sporting
News said, "Though Stanford hasn't even been to the
NCAA playoffs since 1942, hopes of winning the 1988
title are not unrealistic." The volume of home
attendance, both in numbers and in screams, will make
a significant difference.
This team may seem somewhat ordinary (2 great
starters, the rest merely solid), but never bet against a
team with swan-song motivation. Miller, who will retire
after this season, has won 652 games in 37 years —
take a look at the Kareem Abdul-Jabaar and Julius
Erving farewell tours if you doubt the significance of this.
Everybody will be looking at new coach Jim Harrick to
be the latest to turn the Bruins around. But whatever
happens in the Pauley Pavilion pressure cooker this
season, he already has — by recuriting Mac Lean and
Martin for this year and the top two West Coast recruits
for 1989-90.
It's actually possible that, game-by-game, Taylor could
carry Cal to the conference title. But looking at how the
Bears match up position-by-position against the other
contenders, they don't seem to hold many advantages.
If Cal had had this team in the weaker Pac-10 last year, it
might have finished as high as second.
Wins will come again as if by magic, such as when the
Cougars knocked off Stanford at Maples on a 3-pointer
by Sanders in overtime. Still, although the team is a year
older and a year better, conference rivals will be ready
this season for the Cougars.
It seems like the young duo of Recasner and Hayward
could still be mainstays on the all-conference team
when Dan Quayle starts running for President. But don't
expect the Huskies to contend before that day comes.
Oregon should beat up on the lesser second-division
rivals and may outlast a contender in double-overtime,
but that's about it.
USC has some decent young talent, but with no
leadership on the court, and with George Raveling's
repuation as a coach sinking fast, this team could be
mired at the bottom for a while.
The Sun Devils lost their last nine games and their two
best players last year. They are the only team, besides
perhaps Oregon, that is significantly regressing in the
Pac-10. They're already thinking baseball season in
Tempe.
