# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
It's tip-off time for the Stan
ford men's and women's basket
hall teams, and last week they
came out with a vengeance.
Though solid team efforts led
to the teams' success (the men
went 2-1, the women went 3-0)
a couple of stars stood out.

And so, without further ado,
the Daily's Athletes of the Week
for this autumn quarter Dead
Week — the tallest duo thus far
— are Katv Steding and Howard
Wright.
Steding, a 6-foot junior from
Lake Oswego, Ore., led the Car
dinal to a sweep of its three game
road trip.
First, against Fresno State
Tuesday, Steding scored 20
points and had game-highs in
rebounds (11), blocks (3) and
steals (2). The Cardinal won in
front of a tough Bulldog crowd
62-58.
Stanford headed for Evanston,
111. to play in the Roger L. White
Invitational over the weekend.
Friday, the Cardinal took on
Missouri in a first-round game.
Steding chipped in 10 points and
grabbed five boards as Stanford
clawed the Tigers 75-60.
The next night, in the final
against Northwestern, Steding
poured in another 20 points,
yanked down a game-high eight
rebounds and nabbed a school
record 10, that's right 10, steals.

Stanford won 94-82 to capture
the tourney title.
Steding was named tourna
ment MVP.

Wright, a 6-foot-8 senior for
ward from San Diego, was the
thinking man's choice for MVP
of this weekend's Apple Invita
tional.
While Todd Lichti led the team
in scoring, it was Wright's stellar
defensive play against future
NBA forward Pat Durham of
Colorado State.
In the tourney final, Wright
repeatedly denied Durham the
ball. When the Rams' forward
finally got bis bands on the ball,
he was forced into shots ranging
from difficult to nearly impossi
ble.
Durham managed but four

points after averaging over 27
in his three previous games.
For good measure, Wright
pumped in 26 in the fifth-annual
Apple tourney and ripped down
14 rebounds. For his efforts,
Wright was named to the all
tournament team.

Wright and Steding
were both named to
all-tourney teams.
