# Hoopsters take Invitational

And the beat goes on.. ..
Continuing in the winning tradition
begun last season, the No. 6 Stanford
women's basketball team added another
pair of victories and a tournament title
to its 2-0 record with a 75-60 decision
over Missouri and a 94-82 win over host
Northwestern for the Roger L. White
Invitational championship.

"I thought we played two good
teams," Stanford Coach Tara VanDer
veer said. "Missouri was a very aggres
sive team that gave us some problems
with picking up our guards — their
perimeter defense was pretty good.
"The Missouri team was stronger
than the Northwestern team, I think.
Northwestern wasn't quick — Missouri
was really quick around the perimeter.
But Northwestern is a well-coached
team that executed really well."
More significant for Stanford than
the tournament title, the weekend
marked the rise of the Stanford for
wards, namely Evon Asforis, Trisha
Stevens and Katy Steding. Though the
acclaimed backcourt duo of Sonja Hen

ning and Jennifer Azzi have been
lavished with preseason All-America
honors, it was the front-line trio that
carried the offensive load for the Car
dinal this weekend.
Stevens, a Pacific 10 Conference All-
Freshman Team selection last season,
has been no stranger to the local
limelight. The sophomore scored a
career-high 21 points in the Cardinal's
season opener against Wisconsin, and
added another 23 points this weekend
after an 18-point showing against Mis
souri.
Asforis, however, stole the show. Also
a recorder of 18 points, the senior shot
8-for-12 from the field and pulled down
four rebounds.
"We didn't shoot the ball well from
outside, but I thought that Evon and
Trisha had exceptionally strong games,"
VanDerveer said. "Katy also had a good
game, and Evon played her best game
ever — she did just about everything
we need her to do."
Steding followed up her 10-point, five
rebound performance the first night
with a showing fine enough to earn
tournament MVP honors. Tying for the
game high in scoring with 20, the junior
also led the field with eight rebounds
and an incredible 10 steals in 31 minutes
of play.
"I don't know where she got the steals
from," VanDerveer laughed. "She got
some steals, she hit her bank-shot, she

was running the floor really well, shp
hit 3-pointers, she rebounded really well
and her defense was improved."
The other rising star that shone in
Illinois was Stacy Parson, a junior guard
who rose to prominence with a career
performance last year at USC. Parson
scored 10 points and four assists over
the weekend in 28 minutes of action.
All told, the road trip was an excellent
outing for the Stanford squad. Apart
from claiming two more wins, the cagers
gained the commodity of experience,
which is especially valuable to younger
players.
"Both teams were stronger than any
team we've played so far," VanDerveer
said. "Every game seems to be getting
tougher and tougher, which is good."
The going will get much rougher im
mediately, as in this Friday at Maples
Pavilion. Returning to its home court
before an extended eastern road trip,
Stanford hosts Colorado, an unbeaten
and tough team that participated in the
NCAA tournament last season.
Bolstered by guard Bridget Turner
and center Crystal Ford, the Lady Buffs
should infuse a little life and excitement
into the doldrums of Dead Week.
"That should be one of our best home
games this season," VanDerveer said.
The next stop for the Cardinal may
be the one that ends the victory tour,
