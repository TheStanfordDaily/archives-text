# Arms center struggles in battle for survival
## 
### Jock Friedly Senior staff writer 
Commanding a world-class rep
utation in technical analysis of
arms control just two weeks ago,
the Center for International Se
curity and Arms Control is now
dissolving, leaving arms control
experts and funding organizations
in doubt about Stanford's com
mitment to arms control studies.

The center has suffered enor
mous losses in the past couple
weeks, perhaps irretrievable, with
the resignation of co-director Sid
ney Drell — a top physicist and
arms-control expert — and threat
ened resignations of former
astronaut Sally Ride and Senior
Research Associate Ted Postol.
Other members of the center may
follow suit.
Despite the publicity about
resignations, the center has shown
tenacity, hoping to continue in the
wake of the major upheaval.
Several center members have
stressed that the center will still
struggle along, if in a much
reduced capacity. And Political

Science Prof. John Lewis, co
director of the center who will take
over as director when Drell leaves,
has shown no sign that he will
let the center die.
But the future of the center,
and arms control research at Stan
ford, appears grim. Funding to
the center has been thrown in
jeopardy by the unfolding crisis,
and the Carnegie Corporation has
revoked a $500,000 grant to the
center for next year unless the
University commits itself soon to
restoring its technical expertise on
arms control.
While the future funding for
the center lies in doubt, so does
the center's potential for attrac
ting top arms-control experts and
outstanding young scientists. The
ability to attract young research
ers — a long-time characteristic
of the center — depends heavily
on the establishment of a solid
core of top researchers.
"If for whatever reason, the cri
tical mass slips away, it's much
harder to attract outstanding
people to the center," said Coit
Blacker, an international relations
professor at USC.
"It is a terrible blow to Stanford
... and perhaps just as important,

a loss to the field [of arms con
trol]," Blacker said. According to
Blacker, only about six such aca
demic centers exist, with MIT and
Harvard University leading
strong programs.
Blacker's case is the clearest
example of the crisis over profes
sorial appointments, which is the
central item of contention between
the University and members of
the center. A noted arms-control
expert and former adviser to
former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart,
Blacker sought tenure here, but
he was denied it by the Political
Science Department. Stanford's
refusal to award him a professor
ship led him to leave Stanford
and the arms control center last
summer. He had been an acting
co-director of the center and a
popular teacher.
University officials have com

mented little on the crisis, leading
professors across the country to
question whether Stanford cares
if the arms control center disin
tegrates, notwithstanding Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy's
official expressions of regret and
concern.
Blacker said the center's
probable downfall will wound the
public policy program, which
Stanford is trying to make a
"first-rate, first-rank" program.
The University has recently
opened the Institute for Interna
tional Studies in the hope of
bolstering the program.
"I think an opportunity is
squandered," Blacker said about
the damage to the public policy
program. "It raises serious doubts
about Stanford's commitment to
that program."
According to Jack Ruwina, di
rector of an international rela
tions institute at MIT, "It's a loss
[for Stanford]." Ruwina noted
though, that the center's difficul
ties will give other institutions

the chance to build strong pro
grams by picking up the pieces
from the exodus.
"I would personally love to see
a lot Stanford people here,"
Ruwina said.
In fact, Postol has been speak
ing with Ruwina about the pos
sibility of moving his research to
MIT, according to Ruwina. Postol
said he has received "verbal of
fers" by making arrangements
with other universities, perhaps
taking some of the center's qual
ified researchers with him.
Around the country, other offi
cials at top universities said they
are looking at the center's losses
as their gains. Directors of similar
centers are eager to grab up Stan
ford's losses to bolster their own
programs.
Whether the center can recover
from the losses is uncertain. For
now, it appears to be knocked
down by the blows of the past
two weeks. Unless the University
acts, it could be down for the
count.
