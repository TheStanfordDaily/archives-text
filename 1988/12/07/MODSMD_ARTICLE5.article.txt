# Arms center struggles in battle for survival
## 
### Jock Friedly Senior staff writer 
Commanding a world-class rep
utation in technical analysis of
arms control just two weeks ago,
the Center for International Se
curity and Arms Control is now
dissolving, leaving arms control
experts and funding organizations
in doubt about Stanford's com
mitment to arms control studies.

The center has suffered enor
mous losses in the past couple
weeks, perhaps irretrievable, with
the resignation of co-director Sid
ney Drell — a top physicist and
arms-control expert — and threat
ened resignations of former
astronaut Sally Ride and Senior
Research Associate Ted Postol.
Other members of the center may
follow suit.
Despite the publicity about
resignations, the center has shown
tenacity, hoping to continue in the
wake of the major upheaval.
Several center members have
stressed that the center will still
struggle along, if in a much
reduced capacity. And Political

Science Prof. John Lewis, co
director of the center who will take
over as director when Drell leaves,
has shown no sign that he will
let the center die.
But the future of the center,
and arms control research at Stan
ford, appears grim. Funding to
the center has been thrown in
jeopardy by the unfolding crisis,
and the Carnegie Corporation has
revoked a $500,000 grant to the
center for next year unless the
University commits itself soon to
restoring its technical expertise on
arms control.
While the future funding for
the center lies in doubt, so does
the center's potential for attrac
ting top arms-control experts and
outstanding young scientists. The
ability to attract young research
ers — a long-time characteristic
of the center — depends heavily
on the establishment of a solid
core of top researchers.
"If for whatever reason, the cri
tical mass slips away, it's much
harder to attract outstanding
people to the center," said Coit
Blacker, an international relations
professor at USC.
"It is a terrible blow to Stanford
... and perhaps just as important,
