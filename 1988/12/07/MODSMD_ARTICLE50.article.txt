Lay one on, Charlie Brown
Remember your first kiss? Wasn't that a wonderful moment.
Well, okay, maybe you did lock braces with Carla Hollingsworth
and have to go to the emergency room to be surgically separated.
But still, that first kiss is always a magical moment.
And what better way to relive the wonder, the spectacle, the
embarrasing goop that came oui of your nose when you tried
french-kissing Gianna DeCiccio, than by renting "It's Your First
Kiss, Charlie Brown."
Lovable Charlie Brown is ready to escort the homecoming
queen — the little red-haired girl — to the dance, but he balks
when he learns that he will have to (gulp!) kiss her and lead
her in the first dance.
Yes, it's a chance to relive your fondest memories from high
school — such as the time Christi Trimble threw up on you
during the Sadie Hawkins Dance. Be sure to rent "It's Your
First Kiss, Charlie Brown." In video stores Jan. 17.
