## Have films finally gone to the dogs? 
### Lori Gottlieb 
You may not have realized it at the time,
but this year's Gaieties theme, "Follow That
Dog," was the ultimate in chic. It's true —
man s canine companions are beginning to
make their mark on the current entertainment
scene, and in Hollywood, a number of pooches
are successfully barking their way up the tree
to stardom.
And I'm not talking about old-timers like
Snoopy and Lassie. Like Virginia Slims, Mighty
Dog has come a long way — all the way to
landing mtyor motion picture roles. In fact,
the annual Canine Oscar Awards ceremony
recently took place in the land of showbiz, and
already, speculation has begun as to who will
be nominated for the coveted honors next year.
Critics who have seen Richard Benjamin's
new film, "My Stepmother is an Alien," a
romantic comedy opening Friday, are focusing
their predictions on up-and-coming canine
celebrity Peanut, who plays Dave the Dog in
the film opposite Dan Aykroyd, Jon Lovitz
and Kim Basinger.
Like his eminent co-stars, Peanut is no new
comer to the screen. Before landing the role
°112 Dave the Dog in "My Stepmother is an
Alien," the seven-year acting veteran appeared
in several films, including "Used Cars" with
Kurt Russell. In his most recent film, Peanut
shared the big screen with Jim Belushi and
Whoopi Goldberg in "Homer and Edy."
Despite his success so far, Peanut still has
plenty of competition from the hundreds of
other animals pursuing acting careers. He
shares this ambition with the almost 200
celebrity animals — including cats, hawks,
owls, snakes, pigs and a racoon — managed
by professional trainer Moe di Sesso and his
son Frank.
The di Sessos have cast their
"clients" in literally hundreds of
vintage parts: who can forget Ar
nold the Pig in the television se
ries "Green Acres," Jimmy the
Raven in the Vincent Price film
"The Raven" or the dogs in
"Annie." It wasn't on good looks
alone that Peanut got the part of
Dave. According to Moe di Sesso,
the canine actor is also intelligent,
able to learn his lines quickly, and
responds well to stage directions.
Peanut proved his abilities during
the film's audition when he was
asked to a "roof scene — a dif
ficult sequence in which he had
to obey commands coming from
his trainer on the ground.
"They [the casting directors]
knew it would be hard to find
another dog who could be con
trolled from so far away," recalls
di Sesso. "Even from the roof,
Peanut never loses his concentra
tion. He watches the trainer like
a hawk."
Although it was Moe di Sesso
who took his canine protege to
the audition, it was actually his
30-year-old son Frank Di Sesso
who spent almost two months pre
paring Peanut to play Dave. And
while neither of the di Sessos has
ever had any formal education in
animal domestication, both have
become widely renowned in the
film industry.
"My animals don't need an
agent," explains the modest Moe
di Sesso, who has been in the

business for 42 years. "All of the
directors know me and my
animals."
So how does an aspiring animal
actor embark on a showbiz career?
Because the di Sessos only "sign"
animal actors who genuinely love
to work in front of the camera,
it's not easy to pass their prelim
inary screen test.
"When we first meet a dog, his
tail better be wagging," insists
Frank di Sesso about the selection
process. "No matter what breed
his is, if a dog has a sullen look
on his face, we won't take him
because that indicates that he's
not interested in other people. We

look for dogß whose eyes sparkle,
who run to the front of the cage
to get our attention."
And Peanut certainly loved the
attention he got from co-stars
Aykroyd and Lovitz.
With such talent and determi
nation, Peanut may well be on
his way to winning critical acclaim
at next year's Canine Oscars cer
emony. Just as the Mighty Dog
commercials gave the tyro actor
wide exposure, an award-winning
performance in "My Stepmother
is an Alien" could place the rising
celebrity at the head of the pack
for future motion picture roles.
And that's worth a lot of biscuits.

performance in "My Stepmother
is an Alien" could place the rising
celebrity at the head of the pack
for future motion picture roles.
And that's worth a lot of biscuits.

As you probably guessed, this isn't Dave the Dog. It's Kim the
Basinger, star of "My Stepmother is an Alien."
You may not have realized it at the time,
but this year's Gaieties theme, "Follow That
Dog," was the ultimate in chic. It's true —
man s canine companions are beginning to
make their mark on the current entertainment
scene, and in Hollywood, a number of pooches
are successfully barking their way up the tree
to stardom.
And I'm not talking about old-timers like
Snoopy and Lassie. Like Virginia Slims, Mighty
Dog has come a long way — all the way to
landing mtyor motion picture roles. In fact,
the annual Canine Oscar Awards ceremony
recently took place in the land of showbiz, and
already, speculation has begun as to who will
be nominated for the coveted honors next year.
Critics who have seen Richard Benjamin's
new film, "My Stepmother is an Alien," a
romantic comedy opening Friday, are focusing
their predictions on up-and-coming canine
celebrity Peanut, who plays Dave the Dog in
the film opposite Dan Aykroyd, Jon Lovitz
and Kim Basinger.
Like his eminent co-stars, Peanut is no new
comer to the screen. Before landing the role
°112 Dave the Dog in "My Stepmother is an
Alien," the seven-year acting veteran appeared
in several films, including "Used Cars" with
Kurt Russell. In his most recent film, Peanut
shared the big screen with Jim Belushi and
Whoopi Goldberg in "Homer and Edy."
Despite his success so far, Peanut still has
plenty of competition from the hundreds of
other animals pursuing acting careers. He
shares this ambition with the almost 200
celebrity animals — including cats, hawks,
owls, snakes, pigs and a racoon — managed
by professional trainer Moe di Sesso and his
son Frank.
The di Sessos have cast their
"clients" in literally hundreds of
vintage parts: who can forget Ar
nold the Pig in the television se
ries "Green Acres," Jimmy the
Raven in the Vincent Price film
"The Raven" or the dogs in
"Annie." It wasn't on good looks
alone that Peanut got the part of
Dave. According to Moe di Sesso,
the canine actor is also intelligent,
able to learn his lines quickly, and
responds well to stage directions.
Peanut proved his abilities during
the film's audition when he was
asked to a "roof scene — a dif
ficult sequence in which he had
to obey commands coming from
his trainer on the ground.
"They [the casting directors]
knew it would be hard to find
another dog who could be con
trolled from so far away," recalls
di Sesso. "Even from the roof,
Peanut never loses his concentra
tion. He watches the trainer like
a hawk."
Although it was Moe di Sesso
who took his canine protege to
the audition, it was actually his
30-year-old son Frank Di Sesso
who spent almost two months pre
paring Peanut to play Dave. And
while neither of the di Sessos has
ever had any formal education in
animal domestication, both have
become widely renowned in the
film industry.
"My animals don't need an
agent," explains the modest Moe
di Sesso, who has been in the

business for 42 years. "All of the
directors know me and my
animals."
So how does an aspiring animal
actor embark on a showbiz career?
Because the di Sessos only "sign"
animal actors who genuinely love
to work in front of the camera,
it's not easy to pass their prelim
inary screen test.
"When we first meet a dog, his
tail better be wagging," insists
Frank di Sesso about the selection
process. "No matter what breed
his is, if a dog has a sullen look
on his face, we won't take him
because that indicates that he's
not interested in other people. We

look for dogß whose eyes sparkle,
who run to the front of the cage
to get our attention."
And Peanut certainly loved the
attention he got from co-stars
Aykroyd and Lovitz.
With such talent and determi
nation, Peanut may well be on
his way to winning critical acclaim
at next year's Canine Oscars cer
emony. Just as the Mighty Dog
commercials gave the tyro actor
wide exposure, an award-winning
performance in "My Stepmother
is an Alien" could place the rising
celebrity at the head of the pack
for future motion picture roles.
And that's worth a lot of biscuits.
