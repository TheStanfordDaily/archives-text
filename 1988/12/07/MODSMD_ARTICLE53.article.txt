## Guns N' Roses strikes again with a new EP Their appetite for destruction sated, this one's drastic, caustic and (gasp!) acoustic 
### 
So much for Guns N' Roses. Write it off. Whatever
future it might have had after "Appetite for Destruc
tion" has vanished with its latest insult to civiliza
tion, "GN'R Lies." As far as I'm concerned, Guns
N' Roses is shooting blanks.
"GN'R Lies" is awkwardly balanced since it's
actually two separate albums. The first four songs
are simply a reissue of the hard-to-find 1986 EP
"Live Like a Suicide" (Doesn't that tug at the ol'
heartstrings?). New material covers the rest.

The EP side, recorded live, makes you wonder
how Guns N' Roses ever managed to crawl out of
L.A.*B sewers. The kickoff track, "Reckless Life," is
mind-numbing, pseudo-speed metal which could
have been written only by a fully numbed mind.
It's wanna-be Spinal Tap, as pathetically predictable
as Full Moon in the Quad.
"Nice Boys" is a bit better, though it suffers from
the same Ratt/Dokken/Poison/Whitesnake twang.
Someone in my dorm said he's seen an original
copy of "Live Like a Suicide" in Los Angeles for
$96; it scares me to think of who would shell out
so much for so little.
Admittedly, I'm impressed with the competence
of their live performance on this record. Over the
summer I saw G&R in concert opening for Aero
smith, and besides showing up a half-hour late and
setting a new expletives-per-minute record, it put
on the sloppiest show I've ever seen.
The entire band was stoned; during one song,
lead singer Axl Rose hunched over his mike and
managed to wail, "I'm trippin' so bad, I gotta go
sit down somewhere. I'm just gonna let the guys
dick around for awhile."
They did.
But what can you expect from a band who titled
their breakthrough album "Appetite for Destruc
tion". .. well, I dunno ... I don't ask for much .. .

oh, some decent new music, perhaps?
We should be so lucky. The new stuff on "GN'R
Lies" is rotten. All four new tracks are acoustic —
about the last thing you'd expect, considering what's
made them successful: thrash (not trash!) classics
like "Welcome to the Jungle," "Sweet Child 0' Mine"
and "It's So Easy."
Acoustic is simply the antithesis of their hard-edge
style. "Patience," a six-minute marathon of misery,
comes across about as sincerely as one of Oral
Roberts' money pleas. Conspicuously (and quite sad
ly) absent are the riveting guitar licks of Slash;
apparently he's been doomed to a career of calm,
smooth strumming instead of the informal,

stronger-than-steel chords that distinguished him.
I'm furious at Guns N' Roses for ruining "You're
Crazy," previously one of its best romps. Although
it opened its concert set with a blistering version
of the song, it is here in its original, acoustic and
horridly inferior version.
Likewise, "Used to Love Her" is lessened by acous
ticization. G&R serves up a scalding version in
concert, but it's been tamed for the album. Even
so, it's pretty good. Tongue planted firmly in cheek,
Rose screamsings, "I used to love her/but I had to
kill her/I had to put her/six feet under/but I can
still hear her complain." Not the most tasteful
lyrics, though when taken lightly they're bearable.
