## Tequila makes Mel look great 
### Kathy Kleist Staff writer 
Lust. A good old-fashioned, red
blooded American feeling, and a
great reason to go see Mel Gibson,
Kurt Russell and Michelle Pfeiffer
in "Tequila Sunrise."
The steamy hot tub scene be
tween Mel and Michelle is reason
enough to like this fast-paced
flick, but even those who don't
melt at the sight of The Ultimate
in Male Perfection should con
sider checking it out.
Mel and Kurt play a drug dealer
and a cop who have been friends
since high school. Pfeiffer is the
woman caught between their
friendship and their "business"
conflict. Raul Julia is his usual
urbane and sinister self as a
Mexican drug dealer and Mel's
friend.
Mel, of course, is really worth
watching.
"Tequila Sunrise" delivers a
suspenseful two hours in which
people aren't what they seem: the
bad guys are good and the good
ones repulsive; friendship is a
weary grind pushing three men
to their limits, while at the same
time being their real reason for
existing; and love is the complica
tion that none of them need, but
that they desperately want.
Any woman would want it, with
Mel.
The plot twists are constant,

and often confusing, yet the
movie's motion is so relentless and
interesting that the viewer doesn't
have a chance to think for very
long about what he or she doesn't
understand.

And, of course, there's always
Mel to drool over.
If the movie isn't always
coherent, it is always exciting, and
all four of the main characters
are beautifully played.
