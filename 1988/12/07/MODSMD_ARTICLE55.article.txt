## John Updike shares his ordered, ambiguous vision 
### Torben von Staden 
Daily: Are you and Rabbit sur
viving the decade? How and how
well?
Updike: I'm surving it. It's been
a very kind decade to me. It's
sort of president Reagan's decade,
isn't it? And without having voted
for Reagan, I have, like many
Americans, eryoyed the illusion of
peace and prosperity that he's
given us, and I assume Harry in
his realm is also enjoying it.
It's almost time for me and
Harry to rendezvous, since the
ninth year of the decade is ap
proaching. I haven't begun on the
book yet and can't really talk
about it, except to say that I do
want to write it.

Interview

Daily: You've said that as a
child you used to draw quite a
lot and that in your drawings you
connected disparate objects with
lines to form "impossible trees."
You have described this tendency
as a "collecting impulse."
Elsewhere, you have suggested
that a novel, among other things,
explores "connections between un
like things" and "imitates reality
through a certain opacity, a proud
opacity."
How do you feel the "collecting
impulse" and these two charac
teristics of the novel might be
related?
Updike: The collecting impulse
is really a mode of the order
seeking impulse, and I think that
fiction is, among other things, an
attempt to put life into some kind
of order. We collect in it moments
that are meaningful to us, and in
a way that's how the story looks
before you begin it; it has just a
few little spots of things that you
want to convey, and then you try
to draw the lines between them.

The collecting Im
pulse is really a mode
of the order seeking
impulse, and I think
that fictioniifs 112 among
other things, an at
tempt to put life into
some kind of order.'

As to the opacity, I suppose that
I'm not sure I'd emphasize that
at this stage of my life. But it's
been a comfort to me as I write
fiction to believe that where
reality is mysterious, there fiction
should be also somewhat myste
rious. It shouldn't yield up easy
or ready answers to the basic
questions.
The fiction writer's attempt is
to say what he knows, but not
bluff more than he knows.
Daily: Earlier this evening, you
mentioned a collection of essays
on art which is soon to be pub
lished. What connections have you
experienced between the visual
arts and your writing?
Updike: Well, the connection
was very sharp at the beginning
of my career because I really
rather slowly went from being a
would-be cartoonist to being than
many writers do.
The visual side of my self has
been pretty dormant these many
years of writing for a living, but
I have been allowed to do a few
art show reviews, and also I've
written an occasional essay on a
work of art. There were enough,
it turned out, to make a kind of
Christmas book, and that's what's
being collected.
I ei\joy having them collected,
but I don't really feel I'll set up
as a real art critic; I think I'm
too old and furthermore what I
have to say about art is pretty

well said in this collection. It's
called "Just Looking," and it's
basically an amateur's approach
to art.
Daily: How do you see your ex
perience with the visual arts as
affecting you perception of the
world and the rendering in writ
ing of that vision ?
Updike: I think I'm probably
more visual than some people. I've
always had pretty good eysight;
it'B not perfect, but I've lived
through my eyes to a degree, and
I'm very aware of the sensual ex
citement of seeing things.
I have a number of friends who
are color blind (it's amazing how
many color blind people there are
in the world), golfing friends who
can't spot a red ball against green
grass. So this has made me ap
preciate the fact of not being color
blind.
For whatever reason, I think
the human animal is dependent
on its eyes and developed bioptic
vision up in the trees, and that
there's also some link between
male sexuality and the visual. So
that all these things I'm aware
of come into my writing. There's
a lot of seeing in my fiction.
It's made me try hard to get
the look of something on the page
without piling on adjectives end
lessly. Too many adjectives be
come numbing in fiction, and we
cease to see anything if we're
asked to visualize too much, but
to find just the right mix that
will make the reader see pretty
much what you see, never exactly,
but pretty much.
Daily: You've described your na
tive region of southeastern Penn
sylvania as "a land fertile even
for the absentee farmer," and ear
lier this evening, you mentioned
a memoire you've been working
on. Would you describe briefly a
bit of how you feel memory and
remembering function in your
writing?
Updike: One of the reasons that
I've never much kept a journal,

I think, is my belief that you re
member what is important, and
that part of the fiction-making
process is to assemble those things
that stuck in our minds as in
some way meaningful and to find
their meaning. So, it's very im
portant as a selecting agency; if
we remembered everything, we'd
be overwhelmed every time we
sat down because we'd know too
much.
As to Pennsylvania, in some
way we're all, I think, excited by
nostalgia: This place we've keen
and so on. My early fiction was
very nostalgic, and I found that
when I wrote the first sequel to
"Rabbit, Run," when I wrote
"Rabbit Redux," even though I'd
been away a number of years, it
came to life for me in a way that
nothing set in New England could
because it was somehow in my
bones, and that was true of "Rab
bit is Rich," and I hope will be
true of the fourth one.
Daily: Earlier, you described fic
tion as a rendering of contempo
rary experience. Obviously both
remembering and living are
tremendously important to your
work. How do you feel contempo
rary and past experience function
differently or similarly in your
writing, and how do you ensure
the maintenance of you own con
temporary experience?
Updike: A work of fiction can
be both an exercise in memory
for the writer and a comment

upon contemporary life for the
reader, I think, since 10 years
isn't a great span.
Sometimes when I write, I'm
very aware of the exact moment
and the fads of the day; the Rabbit
books are full of the news of the
day and so on, but a story like
the two I read tonight could hap
pen, I would think, anytime in
the last 20 years.
Look a memory maybe as one
of the ways we try to sift out
what is important about the way
we live now. I don't think a
writer's prime function is to
describe the way a sociologist
would what's around him, but we

do to draw our images from
what is around us, and also we
draw our sense of what needs to
be said.
We live in a world much less
theologically saturated than say
Dickens' world, so the kind of sig
nificance we assign a thing is
other than the kind Dickens did.
Away from my desk, I try to
just be a normal American and
to ei\joy and instruct myself, and
to have something other than
writing to think about-and cer
tainly golf and science are two
things that do take my mind away
from my own professional con
cerns.

'Look at a memory

portant about the

Away from his desk, John Updike escapes from professional con
cerns by spending lazy days off the shores of Massachusetts.
