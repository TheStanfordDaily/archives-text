# Chimera offers a book-browser's eclectic paradise
## 
### Kristen Fehlhaber 
Chimera Books is a well-kept
secret among Stanford students,
but it shouldn't be. While it lies
off the beaten track for most of
us, this used book store enjoys a
great reputation among Bay Area
bibliophiles, and it brings them
in from as far away as San Jose
and Berkeley.
Chimera isn't your typical
stuffy antiquarian bookshop,

where astronomical prices take
the fun out of browsing. Owner
Walter Martin describes it as "a
bookstore with books that people
actually read." The store offers a
high quality selection at afforda
ble prices.
You'll know Chimera Books
when you see it. Located one block
off University Ave. on the corner
of Kipling and Lytton, Chimera
sits in one of the few remaining
Victorians in downtown Palo Alto.

Built in 1897 in the Classical
Colonial Revival style, the green
and white, two story house is itself
worth a visit.
Inside, there are chairs and a
sofa, and you are encouraged to
feel at home while you look
through new and used books,
records, CDs and postcards that
fill the house's seven rooms.
The bookstore opened in 1970,
on a somewhat more modest scale.
"We started out in one room of

the house," says Martin, who
opened the store with two friends.
"(We had only) 10 boxes of per
sonal books and records. . .(and)
we didn't know anything about
the book business. But we knew
books."
The owners settled upon the
name Chimera, a mythological
three-headed creature and a sym
bol of their partnership.
Chimera Books has changed
over past 20 years. It has moved
away from its original focus on
the social sciences and now em
phasizes its literature collection.
Two of the original partners have
left and Martin remains the sole
owner.
Chimera has a unique and
eclectic collection of books.
Upstairs, there are books about
political science, economics and
anthropology. Chimera's foreign
language books (the French and
German are the best) are also
upstairs, as are its books about
fine and performing arts, classics,
philosophy, cooking, history and
science.
There's also a bookcase marked
"Conservative Arts," with a good
part of a shelf devoted to William
F. Buckley. Other special cat
egories include "The Constitu
tion," "Shakespeare" and "Books
about Books."
Poetry and fiction make up
Chimera's largest holdings and
are located on the first floor.
Fiction is divided into hardback
and paperback, with sub-sections
containing anthologies and books
about writing. (Edward Gorey
fans will appreciate the collection
of books whose dustjackets he de
signed.)
The poetry section fills up a
large wall and, since Chimera is
celebrating the 100 th anniversary
of T.S. Eliot's birth, a number of
first edition volumes of his poetry,
including a rare copy of "The Love
Song of J. Alfred Prufrock," are
on display.

You'll find new books in a small
area of the hardback room. Best
sellers are noticeably absent here,
in keeping with Martin's philos
ophy of stocking what he calls
"best editions." These new books
are primarily quality reprints of
well known works, including a
number of soft cover editions,
which make available the lesser
known works of writers such as
Austen, Chekhov and Waugh.
Used records and CDs, which
account for half of Chimera's
sales, fill the remainder of the
first floor. The album collection
is strongest in jazz and rock, but
you'll also find opera, blues, folk
and reggae.

The used CDs range from clas
sical to Kitaro, and generally cost
$10. You can also get a CD for
$2.50 by trading in one of your
own.
Finally, don't forget to lode at
the postcards. There are portraits
of many of the authors whose
books sit on the shelves.
Above all else, when you visit
Chimera, leave yourself a lot of
time.
Chimera Books is located at 405
Kipling (at Lytton), one block
north of the Varsity Theater.
Hours are Monday through Fri
day 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., Saturday
10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and Sunday
noon to 5 p.m. (415) 327-1122.

large wall and, since Chimera is
celebrating the 100 th anniversary
of T.S. Eliot's birth, a number of
first edition volumes of his poetry,
including a rare copy of "The Love
Song of J. Alfred Prufrock," are
on display.

You'll find new books in a small
area of the hardback room. Best
sellers are noticeably absent here,
in keeping with Martin's philos
ophy of stocking what he calls
"best editions." These new books
are primarily quality reprints of
well known works, including a
number of soft cover editions,
which make available the lesser
known works of writers such as
Austen, Chekhov and Waugh.
Used records and CDs, which
account for half of Chimera's
sales, fill the remainder of the
first floor. The album collection
is strongest in jazz and rock, but
you'll also find opera, blues, folk
and reggae.

The used CDs range from clas
sical to Kitaro, and generally cost
$10. You can also get a CD for
$2.50 by trading in one of your
own.
Finally, don't forget to lode at
the postcards. There are portraits
of many of the authors whose
books sit on the shelves.
Above all else, when you visit
Chimera, leave yourself a lot of
time.
Chimera Books is located at 405
Kipling (at Lytton), one block
north of the Varsity Theater.
Hours are Monday through Fri
day 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., Saturday
10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and Sunday
noon to 5 p.m. (415) 327-1122.

'We didn't know anything about the book
business,' says Walter Martin, 'but we knew
books.'
Chimera Books is a well-kept
secret among Stanford students,
but it shouldn't be. While it lies
off the beaten track for most of
us, this used book store enjoys a
great reputation among Bay Area
bibliophiles, and it brings them
in from as far away as San Jose
and Berkeley.
Chimera isn't your typical
stuffy antiquarian bookshop,

where astronomical prices take
the fun out of browsing. Owner
Walter Martin describes it as "a
bookstore with books that people
actually read." The store offers a
high quality selection at afforda
ble prices.
You'll know Chimera Books
when you see it. Located one block
off University Ave. on the corner
of Kipling and Lytton, Chimera
sits in one of the few remaining
Victorians in downtown Palo Alto.

Built in 1897 in the Classical
Colonial Revival style, the green
and white, two story house is itself
worth a visit.
Inside, there are chairs and a
sofa, and you are encouraged to
feel at home while you look
through new and used books,
records, CDs and postcards that
fill the house's seven rooms.
The bookstore opened in 1970,
on a somewhat more modest scale.
"We started out in one room of

the house," says Martin, who
opened the store with two friends.
"(We had only) 10 boxes of per
sonal books and records. . .(and)
we didn't know anything about
the book business. But we knew
books."
The owners settled upon the
name Chimera, a mythological
three-headed creature and a sym
bol of their partnership.
Chimera Books has changed
over past 20 years. It has moved
away from its original focus on
the social sciences and now em
phasizes its literature collection.
Two of the original partners have
left and Martin remains the sole
owner.
Chimera has a unique and
eclectic collection of books.
Upstairs, there are books about
political science, economics and
anthropology. Chimera's foreign
language books (the French and
German are the best) are also
upstairs, as are its books about
fine and performing arts, classics,
philosophy, cooking, history and
science.
There's also a bookcase marked
"Conservative Arts," with a good
part of a shelf devoted to William
F. Buckley. Other special cat
egories include "The Constitu
tion," "Shakespeare" and "Books
about Books."
Poetry and fiction make up
Chimera's largest holdings and
are located on the first floor.
Fiction is divided into hardback
and paperback, with sub-sections
containing anthologies and books
about writing. (Edward Gorey
fans will appreciate the collection
of books whose dustjackets he de
signed.)
The poetry section fills up a
large wall and, since Chimera is
celebrating the 100 th anniversary
of T.S. Eliot's birth, a number of
first edition volumes of his poetry,
including a rare copy of "The Love
Song of J. Alfred Prufrock," are
on display.
