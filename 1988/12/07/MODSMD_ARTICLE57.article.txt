"Holidays in Hell"
by PJ. O'Rourke
Atlantic Monthly, $16.95
Reviewed by James Mills
Patrick Jake O'Rourke is a very
funny man.
Now, with the publication of
"Holidays in Hell," he seems to
have really hit his stride.
The first-time reader may be
taken aback by O'Rourke's con
servative views — views that are
often offensive. A look at his con
tributions to National Lampoon
will explain.
O'Rourke straddles the edge be
tween good and bad taste (usually
leaning toward the latter) and
takes the ride for all the laughs
he can squeeze from our wonder
ful world's "hot spots."
As the International Affairs
Desk Chief at Rolling Stone, his
worldview boils down to one con
cern: "Some people are worried
about the difference between right
and wrong," said O'Rourke in an
Atlantic Monthly press release.
"I'm worried about the difference
between wrong and fun."
In "Holidays," O'Rourke is the
quintessential caustic ugly Amer
ican, jaunting through El Sal
vador, Lebanon, South Korea, the
Phillipines, Poland and, yes, even
South Africa. Also included is a
hilarious trip to Heritage USA,
Jim and Tammy Bakker's sinful
and unique PTL Disneyland.
Instead of providing the reader
with a journalist's objective view

point on the causes and effects of
the world's tumultuous political
events, O'Rourke said he provides
the answers to questions we
might find ourselves asking when
visiting a foreign vacation hot
spot: "How's the food? The drink?
Where can I get a good night's
sleep? How can I find the local
arms dealer?"
Like Hunter S. Thompson,
O'Rourke seems to dwell in an
absurdist reality.
"Holidays" is, however, a sober
ing work. Rather than dwelling
in Thompson's surreal universe,
O'Rourke's writings are firmly
grounded in political reality. All
the ugliness O'Rourke describes
is happening somewhere, far
removed from our own lives.
About his visit to South Africa,
titled "In Whitest South Africa,"
O'Rourke conveys the tone that
permeates his writing: "Every
where you go in the world some
body's raping women, expelling
ethnic Chinese, enslaving Stone
Age tribesmen, shooting Commu
nists, rounding up Jews, kidnap
ping Americans, setting fires to
Sikhs, keeping Catholics out of
country clubs and hunting
peasants from helicopters with
automatic weapons," writes
O'Rourke.
"Either somebody is doing these
things or wants to real bad.
"The world is built on discrim
ination of the most horrible kind,"
he continues. "The problem with
South Africans is that they admit
it.

"They don't say, like the French
'Algerians have a legal right to
live in the fifth arrondisement,
but they can't afford, to.' They
don't say, like the Israelis, 'Arabs
have a legal right to live in West
Jerusalem, but they're afraid to.'
They don't say, like Americans,
'Indians have a legal right to live
in Ohio, but, oops, we killed them
all.'
"The South Africans just say,
'Fuck you.' I believe it's right
there in their constitution: 'Arti
cle IV: Fuck you. We're bigots.'
We hate them for this. And we're
going to hold indignant demon
strations and make our univer
sities sell their Krugerrands until
the South Africans learn to stand
up and lie like white men."
Missing from O'Rourke's writ
ing is the self-righteous indigna

tion that runs rampant on the
op-ed pages of U.S. newspapers
— and the reader is better-off for
it. Americans seem to have be
come numbed to the point of in
difference from the inundation of
condescension from this nation's
leaders and journalists.
O'Rourke looks at the world
from our point of view, the per
spective of not-so-innocent, ignor
ant American. Through the
laughs, readers can draw their
own conclusions, realizing that
there are profound and pervasive
problems with our little world,
and that a little comic relief goes
along way in helping us under
stand just what our part in all of
this is.

Desk Chief at Rolling Stone, his
worldview boils down to one con
cern: "Some people are worried
about the difference between right
and wrong," said O'Rourke in an
Atlantic Monthly press release.
"I'm worried about the difference
between wrong and fun."
In "Holidays," O'Rourke is the
quintessential caustic ugly Amer
ican, jaunting through El Sal
vador, Lebanon, South Korea, the
Phillipines, Poland and, yes, even
South Africa. Also included is a
hilarious trip to Heritage USA,
Jim and Tammy Bakker's sinful
and unique PTL Disneyland.
Instead of providing the reader
with a journalist's objective view

point on the causes and effects of
the world's tumultuous political
events, O'Rourke said he provides
the answers to questions we
might find ourselves asking when
visiting a foreign vacation hot
spot: "How's the food? The drink?
Where can I get a good night's
sleep? How can I find the local
arms dealer?"
Like Hunter S. Thompson,
O'Rourke seems to dwell in an
absurdist reality.
"Holidays" is, however, a sober
ing work. Rather than dwelling
in Thompson's surreal universe,
O'Rourke's writings are firmly
grounded in political reality. All
the ugliness O'Rourke describes
is happening somewhere, far
removed from our own lives.
About his visit to South Africa,
titled "In Whitest South Africa,"
O'Rourke conveys the tone that
permeates his writing: "Every
where you go in the world some
body's raping women, expelling
ethnic Chinese, enslaving Stone
Age tribesmen, shooting Commu
nists, rounding up Jews, kidnap
ping Americans, setting fires to
Sikhs, keeping Catholics out of
country clubs and hunting
peasants from helicopters with
automatic weapons," writes
O'Rourke.
"Either somebody is doing these
things or wants to real bad.
"The world is built on discrim
ination of the most horrible kind,"
he continues. "The problem with
South Africans is that they admit
it.

"They don't say, like the French
'Algerians have a legal right to
live in the fifth arrondisement,
but they can't afford, to.' They
don't say, like the Israelis, 'Arabs
have a legal right to live in West
Jerusalem, but they're afraid to.'
They don't say, like Americans,
'Indians have a legal right to live
in Ohio, but, oops, we killed them
all.'
"The South Africans just say,
'Fuck you.' I believe it's right
there in their constitution: 'Arti
cle IV: Fuck you. We're bigots.'
We hate them for this. And we're
going to hold indignant demon
strations and make our univer
sities sell their Krugerrands until
the South Africans learn to stand
up and lie like white men."
Missing from O'Rourke's writ
ing is the self-righteous indigna

tion that runs rampant on the
op-ed pages of U.S. newspapers
— and the reader is better-off for
it. Americans seem to have be
come numbed to the point of in
difference from the inundation of
condescension from this nation's
leaders and journalists.
O'Rourke looks at the world
from our point of view, the per
spective of not-so-innocent, ignor
ant American. Through the
laughs, readers can draw their
own conclusions, realizing that
there are profound and pervasive
problems with our little world,
and that a little comic relief goes
along way in helping us under
stand just what our part in all of
this is.
