# Reagan's gonzo apologist discusses life, art and liberalism
## 
### James Mills 
P.J. O'Rourke strikes you as
your typically "average" Ameri
can, with medium build and Mid
western features. He also reminds
you of every College or Young
Republican you may have ever
met.

Wearing an oxford and tie and
khaki slacks, O'Rourke, was in
the midst of packing for his flight
to Portland — the next stop on

his whirl-wind publicity tour —
when we began our interview in
his suite at the Westin St. Francis
Hotel.
Lighting the first of three Merit
100's he smoked during our hour
together, O'Rourke discussed the
success of his last book, "Repub
lican Party Reptile," his hopes for
his latest titled, "Holidays in
Hell," and anything else that had
been bothering him recently.
Daily: How do you feel about
being compared to Hunter S.
Thompson ?
O'Rourke: I may be flattered
to be compared with Hunter — I

think he's really a genius, but
what he and I do are actually
worlds apart.
He's not primarily a humorist
— more of an absurdist, and his
stuff has mostly to do with his
interior landscapes.
My persona and my writing is
very much an ordinary person
going to extraordinary places.
What I'm doing is much more
outwardly directed than Hunter's
work. I'm much more of a
reporter than he is, but he is a
good reporter.
Part of what Hunter and I share
is that we seek sources of inspi
ration. We both like to write a
lot, to be bright, the idea of doing
jazz in words. One of the things
I really admire about what Hunter
does is his building "roof." Get
on it! It's like jazz in words —
there's an underlying melody,
sometimes as if even on a stage.
Hunter is a master. I mean, he's
a poet.
Daily: How did you get from
receiving your M.A. from Johns
Hopkins to where you are today'?
O'Rourke: I started writing
when I was in college. Between
my sophomore and junior year I
wrote a novel — it really stunk.
I wrote another one between my
junior and senior year. I was very
determined to be like a serious
novelist sort of character.
And while I was doing that, I
took a writing workshop at Hop
kins, where I actually got my M.A.
While I was a there, I started
to write for the smallest under
ground anti-war newspapers, and
that was where I really got started
writing, where I discovered, for

one thing, that I wasn't likely to
become some sort of great William
Burroughs.
Daily: How did you get to the
International Affairs desk at Roll
ing Stone from National Lam
poon ?
O'Rourke: I had been writing
for Rolling Stone off and on since
the early '80s, and after I'd been
a humorist for a long time,
making my living primarily as a
humorist, I decided I wanted to
do something else.
I got tired of writing just
humor. Basically, humor is like,
people do stuff and then you mock
them for it. Which is fun, but you
burn out on it.
And to a certain extent I also
think it requires a younger atten
tion span. I felt like a little kid.
Inside, the grown-ups are having
dinner, and I would stand outside
in the flower bed, making faces
against the window.
One day I realized I'm crowding
40 — well, more than crowding
40 now — and I felt like I should
be inside eating. I should be doing
something a little more grown-up
than just making fun of people.
So what I thought was, that I
would try and figure out some
way to take the techniques of
humor writing and apply them to
real news stories, and go out and
cover some of this stuff that's
going on in the world. But that
meant that I not only needed some
place that would let me print what
I wanted to write, I also needed
some place to write about.
Rolling Stone was great. They
have a history of backing experi
ments in writing and journalism.

Hunter is the example. And they
came through.
Daily: What are your feelings
about modern-day liberalism?
O'Rourke: I think that
liberalism promotes collectivism
— it promotes the shirking of in
dividual rights. And when you
start doing stuff like having a
"Federal Department of Bed
time!" It promotes the idea that
medical care is not a privilege, it's
a right.
You know, like day care.
Daycare rights. Why do I have to
pay for somebody else's children?
For the babysitter for somebody
else's children? I don't have a kid.
I didn't have the fun of conceiving
the child, you know, and I don't
have the responsibility of raising
it.
Why should I have to pay for
somebody else's child?! I mean,
people are free not to fuck, you
know. And not having a kid, if

they so desire. Having a kid, it's
their responsibility.
Now, I'm not necessarily op
posed to daycare, but I'm opposed
to conceiving it as a right. I don't
get that. You start expanding
rights — it's frivolous. It under
mines the really important rights
that we do have, when you start
equating a situation like daycare
with our right to equality before
the law.
Our right to be innocent until
proven guilty. I mean, a serious
right, our right to free speech and
assembly. There are much more
serious issues in the long run than
our right to daycare. It's like the
right to pet care! A right to car
care!
So yeah, I am pretty conserva
tive on that point. Although I can
not say I'm very pleased with
President-elect George Bush, or
with Vice president-elect Dan
Quayle.

khaki slacks, O'Rourke, was in
the midst of packing for his flight
to Portland — the next stop on

his whirl-wind publicity tour —
when we began our interview in
his suite at the Westin St. Francis
Hotel.
Lighting the first of three Merit
100's he smoked during our hour
together, O'Rourke discussed the
success of his last book, "Repub
lican Party Reptile," his hopes for
his latest titled, "Holidays in
Hell," and anything else that had
been bothering him recently.
Daily: How do you feel about
being compared to Hunter S.
Thompson ?
O'Rourke: I may be flattered
to be compared with Hunter — I

think he's really a genius, but
what he and I do are actually
worlds apart.
He's not primarily a humorist
— more of an absurdist, and his
stuff has mostly to do with his
interior landscapes.
My persona and my writing is
very much an ordinary person
going to extraordinary places.
What I'm doing is much more
outwardly directed than Hunter's
work. I'm much more of a
reporter than he is, but he is a
good reporter.
Part of what Hunter and I share
is that we seek sources of inspi
ration. We both like to write a
lot, to be bright, the idea of doing
jazz in words. One of the things
I really admire about what Hunter
does is his building "roof." Get
on it! It's like jazz in words —
there's an underlying melody,
sometimes as if even on a stage.
Hunter is a master. I mean, he's
a poet.
Daily: How did you get from
receiving your M.A. from Johns
Hopkins to where you are today'?
O'Rourke: I started writing
when I was in college. Between
my sophomore and junior year I
wrote a novel — it really stunk.
I wrote another one between my
junior and senior year. I was very
determined to be like a serious
novelist sort of character.
And while I was doing that, I
took a writing workshop at Hop
kins, where I actually got my M.A.
While I was a there, I started
to write for the smallest under
ground anti-war newspapers, and
that was where I really got started
writing, where I discovered, for

one thing, that I wasn't likely to
become some sort of great William
Burroughs.
Daily: How did you get to the
International Affairs desk at Roll
ing Stone from National Lam
poon ?
O'Rourke: I had been writing
for Rolling Stone off and on since
the early '80s, and after I'd been
a humorist for a long time,
making my living primarily as a
humorist, I decided I wanted to
do something else.
I got tired of writing just
humor. Basically, humor is like,
people do stuff and then you mock
them for it. Which is fun, but you
burn out on it.
And to a certain extent I also
think it requires a younger atten
tion span. I felt like a little kid.
Inside, the grown-ups are having
dinner, and I would stand outside
in the flower bed, making faces
against the window.
One day I realized I'm crowding
40 — well, more than crowding
40 now — and I felt like I should
be inside eating. I should be doing
something a little more grown-up
than just making fun of people.
So what I thought was, that I
would try and figure out some
way to take the techniques of
humor writing and apply them to
real news stories, and go out and
cover some of this stuff that's
going on in the world. But that
meant that I not only needed some
place that would let me print what
I wanted to write, I also needed
some place to write about.
Rolling Stone was great. They
have a history of backing experi
ments in writing and journalism.

Hunter is the example. And they
came through.
Daily: What are your feelings
about modern-day liberalism?
O'Rourke: I think that
liberalism promotes collectivism
— it promotes the shirking of in
dividual rights. And when you
start doing stuff like having a
"Federal Department of Bed
time!" It promotes the idea that
medical care is not a privilege, it's
a right.
You know, like day care.
Daycare rights. Why do I have to
pay for somebody else's children?
For the babysitter for somebody
else's children? I don't have a kid.
I didn't have the fun of conceiving
the child, you know, and I don't
have the responsibility of raising
it.
Why should I have to pay for
somebody else's child?! I mean,
people are free not to fuck, you
know. And not having a kid, if

they so desire. Having a kid, it's
their responsibility.
Now, I'm not necessarily op
posed to daycare, but I'm opposed
to conceiving it as a right. I don't
get that. You start expanding
rights — it's frivolous. It under
mines the really important rights
that we do have, when you start
equating a situation like daycare
with our right to equality before
the law.
Our right to be innocent until
proven guilty. I mean, a serious
right, our right to free speech and
assembly. There are much more
serious issues in the long run than
our right to daycare. It's like the
right to pet care! A right to car
care!
So yeah, I am pretty conserva
tive on that point. Although I can
not say I'm very pleased with
President-elect George Bush, or
with Vice president-elect Dan
Quayle.
