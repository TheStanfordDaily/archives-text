Since 1919, "Prize Stories: The O. Henry Awards"
(edited since 1967 by William Abrahams) has been
a reliable measure of the year's most notable work
in short fiction. This year's edition is no exception.
Until the '70s, the publication of short story col
lections was treated as if it were a non-profit service
to writers. An editor offering to publish a writer's
novel would, as part of the deal, agree to publish
a collection, despite the notoriously poor sales record
of such books.
Then collections like Ann Beattie's "Distortions"
(1974) and Raymond Carver's "Will You Please Be
Quiet, Please?" (1976) began to sell, heralding the
much-talked-about short story "revival."
But the revival was a publishing, not a literary,
phenomenon. Publishers had discovered that, with
the right marketing, short story collections could
make money.
Part of their strategy was to suggest to the book
buying public that things were happening in the
short story form that had never happened before.
These stories were not just new, they implied, but
improved. (For the record, Beattie and Carver did
not reinvent the short story. Nor did they claim to.
They merely wrote them very well.)
The publishing boom in short fiction has kept
writers and readers busy. Bookstore tables are sag
ging under the weight of new collections — best of
this or that writer or magazine, best of the year,

best of all time, best by women, by men, by new
writers, by old. It is apparently easier now to publish
collections of short fiction than ever before.
Anything that puts readers and writers in touch
with each other is good, but this revival also has
a downside.
Some of the collections are self-serving, including
too much work by the editor and the editor's friends
and the editor's friends' friends. Some of the books
have been too hastily pressed into print, published
like record albums, with one or two strong stories
and several duds added, it seems, to fill out the
signature.
And then there are the mysteries of distribution,
like why a mediocre collection is so widely available
when the most important collection in many years,
"Matters of Life and Death" (edited by Tobias Wolff),
is so hard to find it might as well be out of print.
In the middle of all this frenzy, it's good be able
to turn to the "O. Henry Awards," a collection
created with a critical sensibility apparently immune
to the vagaries of fashion.
Most of the stories included in the "O. Henry
Awards," of course, are by the fixed stars of the
literary sky.
John Updike's "Leaf Season" is a middle-aged
version of "The Big Chill," about time's effect on
the seasonal rights of friendship and family life. In
"Yarrow," Joyce Carol Oates tells about a man
whose good intentions drive a bitter wedge between
himself and his cousin.
In the world of Ann Beattie's "Honey," the signs
of love and longing are ambiguous at best, and
every relationship has a sub-text beyond each char
acter's understanding. In Bobbie Ann Mason's

"Bumblebees," three women come to terms with
death, divorce and disappointment by making a last
stand in a garden overrun by parasites and bad
weather.
Under Abrahams' editorship, the O. Henry series
has also always included work from first-time writ
ers and little magazines. Four new writers are rep
resented in this year's collection. Of these, the stand
out story is Philip Deaver's "Areola Girls." Appear
ing at first to be a coming-of-age tale of teenage
lust, "Areola Girls" quickly becomes something
more, something about the rituals and mysteries
connecting generations of women who live lives "full
of skin and possibilities."
Unfortunately, not every story in the collection
inspires faith in the short fiction revival. One piece
from Gordon Lish's "Quarterly" is particularly dis
appointing. There's also a simplistic account of
working-class women visiting their husbands in
prison (the poor are different from you and me, the
writer seems to say, they're dumb and brutal).

And then there's "Errand," Carver's homage to
Anton Chekhov, and this year's First Prize winner.
"Errand" is a subtle, evocative account of the
great Russian writer's last days. It exhibits all of
the talents for which Carver is justly famous, while
striking out into new fictional territory.
Add to this the chilling knowledge that, as he
wrote about the death of the writer he so admired,
Carver almost certainly knew that he, too, would
soon die.
At his best, Carver wrote stories that stop your
heart, and "Errand"—so quitely powerful, so Chek
hovian — is among his best. To read it is to realize
L<ia» Carver's death last August is an e*en greater
loss than at first imagined. Abrahams could not
have chosen a better story to honor.
The story's subject is large, but Carver keeps
urging our gaze towards the characters on the pe
riphery — a doctor who orders champagne for the
dying writer, a waiter who stoops to pick up a cork.
The subject of the story, finally, isn't Chekhov at
all but these nearly nameless people who cross into
his life in its closing hours, and the small selfless
gestures, irrational but right, by which they show
their respect for the living, for the dying.
The best stories in this years' "O. Henry Awards"
are about the effort to connect. Over and over the
characters try and (often) fail to close the gap be
tween themselves and others. This is an old tale
but one that becomes richer in the retelling, and
it is admirably demonstrated in this addition to
Abrahams' distinguished series.

collections of short fiction than ever before.
Anything that puts readers and writers in touch
with each other is good, but this revival also has
a downside.
Some of the collections are self-serving, including
too much work by the editor and the editor's friends
and the editor's friends' friends. Some of the books
have been too hastily pressed into print, published
like record albums, with one or two strong stories
and several duds added, it seems, to fill out the
signature.
And then there are the mysteries of distribution,
like why a mediocre collection is so widely available
when the most important collection in many years,
"Matters of Life and Death" (edited by Tobias Wolff),
is so hard to find it might as well be out of print.
In the middle of all this frenzy, it's good be able
to turn to the "O. Henry Awards," a collection
created with a critical sensibility apparently immune
to the vagaries of fashion.
Most of the stories included in the "O. Henry
Awards," of course, are by the fixed stars of the
literary sky.
John Updike's "Leaf Season" is a middle-aged
version of "The Big Chill," about time's effect on
the seasonal rights of friendship and family life. In
"Yarrow," Joyce Carol Oates tells about a man
whose good intentions drive a bitter wedge between
himself and his cousin.
In the world of Ann Beattie's "Honey," the signs
of love and longing are ambiguous at best, and
every relationship has a sub-text beyond each char
acter's understanding. In Bobbie Ann Mason's

"Bumblebees," three women come to terms with
death, divorce and disappointment by making a last
stand in a garden overrun by parasites and bad
weather.
Under Abrahams' editorship, the O. Henry series
has also always included work from first-time writ
ers and little magazines. Four new writers are rep
resented in this year's collection. Of these, the stand
out story is Philip Deaver's "Areola Girls." Appear
ing at first to be a coming-of-age tale of teenage
lust, "Areola Girls" quickly becomes something
more, something about the rituals and mysteries
connecting generations of women who live lives "full
of skin and possibilities."
Unfortunately, not every story in the collection
inspires faith in the short fiction revival. One piece
from Gordon Lish's "Quarterly" is particularly dis
appointing. There's also a simplistic account of
working-class women visiting their husbands in
prison (the poor are different from you and me, the
writer seems to say, they're dumb and brutal).

And then there's "Errand," Carver's homage to
Anton Chekhov, and this year's First Prize winner.
"Errand" is a subtle, evocative account of the
great Russian writer's last days. It exhibits all of
the talents for which Carver is justly famous, while
striking out into new fictional territory.
Add to this the chilling knowledge that, as he
wrote about the death of the writer he so admired,
Carver almost certainly knew that he, too, would
soon die.
At his best, Carver wrote stories that stop your
heart, and "Errand"—so quitely powerful, so Chek
hovian — is among his best. To read it is to realize
L<ia» Carver's death last August is an e*en greater
loss than at first imagined. Abrahams could not
have chosen a better story to honor.
The story's subject is large, but Carver keeps
urging our gaze towards the characters on the pe
riphery — a doctor who orders champagne for the
dying writer, a waiter who stoops to pick up a cork.
The subject of the story, finally, isn't Chekhov at
all but these nearly nameless people who cross into
his life in its closing hours, and the small selfless
gestures, irrational but right, by which they show
their respect for the living, for the dying.
The best stories in this years' "O. Henry Awards"
are about the effort to connect. Over and over the
characters try and (often) fail to close the gap be
tween themselves and others. This is an old tale
but one that becomes richer in the retelling, and
it is admirably demonstrated in this addition to
Abrahams' distinguished series.

"Prize Stories 1988: The O. Henry Awards"
Edited by William Abrahams

Since 1919, "Prize Stories: The O. Henry Awards"
(edited since 1967 by William Abrahams) has been
a reliable measure of the year's most notable work
in short fiction. This year's edition is no exception.
Until the '70s, the publication of short story col
lections was treated as if it were a non-profit service
to writers. An editor offering to publish a writer's
novel would, as part of the deal, agree to publish
a collection, despite the notoriously poor sales record
of such books.
Then collections like Ann Beattie's "Distortions"
(1974) and Raymond Carver's "Will You Please Be
Quiet, Please?" (1976) began to sell, heralding the
much-talked-about short story "revival."
But the revival was a publishing, not a literary,
phenomenon. Publishers had discovered that, with
the right marketing, short story collections could
make money.
Part of their strategy was to suggest to the book
buying public that things were happening in the
short story form that had never happened before.
These stories were not just new, they implied, but
improved. (For the record, Beattie and Carver did
not reinvent the short story. Nor did they claim to.
They merely wrote them very well.)
The publishing boom in short fiction has kept
writers and readers busy. Bookstore tables are sag
ging under the weight of new collections — best of
this or that writer or magazine, best of the year,

best of all time, best by women, by men, by new
writers, by old. It is apparently easier now to publish
collections of short fiction than ever before.
