# Freshmen lead swimmers to fourth place

member the names. They will be
mentioned often in connection
with Stanford — and most likely
NCAA — swimming for at least
the next four years.
The four freshmen, with the aid
of four classmates and 10 other
teammates, led the Cardinal to a
fourth-place finish in its first
regular-distance meet of the
season, the Husker Invitational,
last Friday through Sunday.
Kostich, Plummer and Rouse
were the Cardinal's top three
point scorers, each placing first
or second in at least one event.
Not too shabby considering the
newcomers to the collegiate scene

were competing in a nine-team
field consisting of last year's na
tional champion, Texas, in addi
tion to three other top-10 NCAA
squads.
Rouse, out of Fredricksburg
Va., was one of only two com
petitiors to win two events, cruis
ing to victories in both the 100-
and 200-yard backstrokes at the
NCAA-style three-day meet.
Kostich won the 1,650 freestyle
and placed fifth in the 400 indi
vidual medley, while Australian
Olympic team member Plummer
followed Kostich in the 1,650,
placed seventh in the 500 free,
and eighth in the 200 free. Class
mate Deruiter took sixth in the
200 and ninth in the 100 breast
stroke.
In addition to taking two first
place finishes back to California,

Rouse also brought home an early
season gift — a spot in April's
NCAA Championsips. His 100
back time of 50.43 put him under
the national finals standard,
making him the first Cardinal to
qualify this season. To put his
swim in perspective, not only did
the backstroker and his team
mates not rest for the meet, they
have not really entered the speed
phase of training.
"Jeffs swim is not surprising
because it is not unusual for a
great athlete to swim fast this
early in the season," Stanford
Coach Skip Kenney said. "It was
an indoor swim meet with good
racers and he rose to the compe
tition."
The Cardinal's tally of 552
points was good for a fourth-place

finish behind host Nebraska,
Southern Methodist University
and UCLA. While finishing be
hind three squads which all placed
below Stanford at last year's na
tional championships does not
seem to be an accomplishment of
any sort, the fact that the top
three teams were shaved and
rested was a huge factor.
Stanford took off only enough
time from workouts to fly to Ne
braska. In addition, the three
squads were attempting to qualify
their team members for NCAAs,
although no team had more than
two swimmers clock quick enough
times to earn a trip to In
dianapolis. Stanford does not rest,
shave, or specifically aim for
NCAAs until the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships in March.
