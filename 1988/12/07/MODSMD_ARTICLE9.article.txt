# Bicycle light citations soar following crackdown
## 
### Ariane Hoy 
Your professor may have been one of
the many to receive a ticket in the recent
crackdown of bicycle light citations by
the Stanford Police Department. Accord
ing to Police Chief Marvin Herrington,
310 citations have been issued this year
on campus to night riders who violate
the law by not using a bike light â€” an
increase over the 42 issued last year at
this time.
Police officers have had more time to
concentrate on bike citations, Herring
ton said. This may be due, in part, to
the decreased number of other calls of
ficers are getting this year, he said.
In addition, there are eight more
campus police officers than last year
during fall quarter, he added.
Herrington also stated that campus
police have recently received more com
plaints from motorists who say they can
not see the night bicyclists and,
moreover, that they ride through stop
signs. Motorists are frightened and an
gered, he said, about the possibility of
injuring these riders.
According to Herrington, the penalty
is usually a "fix-it" ticket requiring the
offender to place a light on the bike.
The citation may possibly include a fine
of $20. Bicycle lights usually cost from
$5 to $10.
"It's working," Herrington said. Offi
cers are seeing a lot more lights than
at the beginning of the school year, he
said.

The offense is a violation of California
Vehicle Code 21201(d), a list of equip
ment requirements which states that
bicycles must have, at night, a light
visible from 300 feet in the front and
from the sides, as well as front and rear
reflectors.
As well as citing violators, police of
ficers have been giving out packets of
reflectors, Herrington said.
Issuing a citation may take five
minutes but could be delayed if the of
fender does not have identification.
Herrington said these citations are a
necessary matter of safety. He said he
feels it is simple to comply with the law
and, by doing so, a bicyclist may save
his or her life.
Students who have received citations
have had mixed emotions about them.
Andrew Wilcox, a freshman who was
ticketed and required to equip his bicycle
with a light, said the policy has not
worked in his case. "I guess it's a good
idea to have lights on bikes, but since
I got a light I've used it only once. It
hasn't really affected my ways. It was
more of a hassle than anything else."
Senior Carol Wong was cited by an
officer who was stationed in his car near
her dorm, Larkin House. "I understand
the principle of having a light and I
agree with it," she said. "However, I
simply question the Stanford Police sit
ting in one spot for a whole evening and
nabbing people one by one. Don't they
have anything better to do?"
