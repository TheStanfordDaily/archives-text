TEXTOR COURSES ON HIGH TECH.
CULTURE, AND THE FUTURE
During Winter Quarter Prof. Robert B. Textor will again offer a Practicum in
Ethnographic Futures Research (EFR) as Anthropology 269 A (69A for undergrads).
You many also take it as VTSS 250 A or Education 212 A. The Practicum will provide
intensive training in a useful interviewing skill one can use throughout one's career.
EFR interviews have, over the years, resulted in Stanford students' sharing authorship
of a number of publications, e.g. Austria 2005: Projected Sociocultural Effects of the
Microelectronic Revolution.
The Practicum is open to juniors, seniors, and grad students from any major.
Previous interviewing experience is not necessary. Flexible credit arrangements are
possible. You may work alone or with a team.
If you are interested in interview methods, cultural analysis, education, broad-scale
planning, and/or public policy, you can find out more about the course at our initial
meeting on Wed., Jan. 11 at 7:00 p.m. in the Anthropology Department, Building 110,
Room 111 A.
Prof. Textor will also offer a new course, "Seminar on Technology in Culture,''
(Anth 268A/TSS 259). This will be offered Soring Quarter rather than Winter, as earlier
listed.
For details, see the Catalog, p. 242.
