# Angry former employee sues University
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
Charging that University officials covered up
health and safety violations and threatened to fire
him if he publicized such violations, a former safety
official is suing the University.
Jon Moldestad, former operations manager of the
Environmental Safety Facility, resigned in December
of 1987 because of the alleged cover-up and threats
to his job. Dissatisfied with the results of an in
vestigation into the matter, Moldestad filed a civil
complaint last month in the Santa Clara County
Superior Court, asking for an unspecified amount
for damages.
The suit cites personal damages including breach
of contract, defamation of character, harassment
and intimidation, but University officials deny these
allegations.
"There has been no coverup at Stanford. We are
convinced that we will prevail on the merits," John
Schwartz, University vice president and general
counsel, told University News Service.
Moldestad's letter of resignation, sent to Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy, led to a University
investigation of health and safety management. Both
SRI International, a private consulting firm, and
the University's Office of Internal Audit staff par
ticipated in the investigation, according to Larry
Horton, associate vice president for public affairs.
Based on the results of the investigation, Kennedy
made changes in health and safety services last
September. Two new positions were created and
guaranteed direct access to Kennedy in safety mat
ters.
But Moldestad's suit claims that the investigation
was flawed and covered up significant problems in
health and safety management.
The University violated "some or all of various
provisions regarding health and safety" in California
and federal law, "covered up the true nature and
extent of the health and safety hazards being re
ported" and intimidated Moldestad and other em
ployees "by reason of its bureaucratic techniques,"
according to the complaint.
The suit cites violations such as designing build
ings in which hazardous materials are blown back
into the buildings, continuing to use a University
Medical Center incinerator after it was shown to
work improperly and improperly storing toxic gas
at the McCullough Building, next to the Physics
Tank. SRI and the Medical Center are also named
as defendants in the suit.
Further, Moldestad alleges he
was told "not to report defects,"
to "keep your mouth shut" and
"not to talk to the press" because
it would make the University
"look bad."
He claims that when he wrote
a memo about a specific hazard,
he was told "you'll be fired if you
ever do that again."
When the department restruc
turing was announced in Septem
ber, Assoc. Managing Auditor
David Fetterman said he was
satisfied with the University's re
sponse to the allegations cited in
Moldestad's resignation letter.
According to Schwartz, Moldes
tad did not raise some of the al
legations cited in the suit during
the University's investigation.
