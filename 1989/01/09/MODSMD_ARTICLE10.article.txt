# ASSU expands price war with Bookstore
## 
### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
With plans to once again "Beat
the Bookstore," the Council of
Presidents will expand its school
supplies sales to include used text
books this week.
The ASSU will "buy used books
for more and sell them for less"
than the Bookstore, said COP
member David Brown. In addi
tion, the COP will have the actual
school supplies, instead of only the
order forms that they had last
quarter, at their table in White
Plaza.
Bookstore Operations Manager
Rose Sims said the ASSU's Beat
the Bookstore campaign was "fine
in the respect that they're anxious
to help students," but she said
she objects to misinformation.
"The ASSU says we're ripping
off students but we're not," Sims
said. The Bookstore buys back
books at one-half their current
value and sells them back at
three-quarters of their value.
"There's no profit by the time
you pay people to process the or
ders," she said.
The ASSU plans to model its
used book sale on the UC-Santa
Cruz book fair. Students who want
to sell back their books will drop
them off at the COP table in
White Plaza, setting their own
price. Students will then come
back to pick up either money or
the unsold books, said Brown.
The ASSU is planning to pur
chase the books for popular intro
ductory classes such as calculus,
human biology and psychology
from students and reselling them

for the same price, bypassing the
Bookstore, according to Brown.
Last quarter, after the ASSU
initiated its sale of school supplies,
the Bookstore put the same supply
items on sale for prices just below
those offered by the ASSU.
"It's not like we're going to put
the Bookstore out of business,"
Brown said, but "we were pretty
happy we got them to lower their
prices."
Sims said the Bookstore always
offers specials at the beginning of
each quarter and their sale last
quarter "wasn't necessarily a re
sponse to [the ASSU's] sale."
Sims said she "didn't recognize
that [last quarter's Beat the Book
store campaign] really did affect"
business at the Bookstore.
However, she said that she is
not sure about the sales at the
beginning of this quarter since
the ASSU will have supplies im
mediately at their table instead
of last quarter's order forms.
Sims said that some students
she talked to thought the Beat
the Bookstore campaign is
"crappy on the ASSU's part.
They're only there at the begin
ning of the quarter and the ASSU
doesn't have rebates."
The Bookstore offers a rebate
to students at then end of the
year on profits made on textbook

sales. Last year the Bookstore re
turned a 17.5 percent rebate to
students.
COP member Miguel M&rquez
said the Bookstore calculates its
profits after setting aside money
for captial improvements such as
a $4 million project for the instal
lation of a bottom floor.
"In the past four years the
Bookstore has given out just $2
million in rebates, and then they
claim to be non-profit," Mdrquez
said.
After the COP's supply sale last
quarter, the Bookstore sent them
a letter saying that it will not be
undersold, according to Mdrquez.
In the letter, the Bookstore
argued that in the long run, the
ASSU would only hurt students
by lowering the amount of the
rebate, M6rquez said.
The COP responded by asking
the Bookstore to look through its
financial records. "If they're not
non-profit we should make them
non-profit," Marquez said.
Sims said there are plans for
one of the managers to meet with
the COP and to discuss some of
their concerns. "You can't just
hand someone the Bookstore's fi
nancial records and expect them
to understand them. They have
to be explained," Sims said.
