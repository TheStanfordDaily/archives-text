Foreign student enrollment at
Stanford has broken its all-time
record for the third year in a
row, according to figures re
cently released by the Bechtel
International Center.
This year 2,370 foreign stu
dents enrolled, compared to last
year's 2,278. The students are
from 102 countries, also a new
all-time high.

John Pearson, director of the
I-Center, said that foreign en
rollment in American univer
sities has been growing for
years, and he attributed Stan
ford's increases as a part of that
trend.
The most popular school for
foreigners continued to be En
gineering, with 923 enrolled.
Humanities and Sciences fol

lowed with 541 foreign students.
Enrollment of Asian students
once again led with 1,085 stu
dents.
While 299 are postdoctoral stu
dents, 306 are undergraduates,
representing 5 percent of the un
dergraduate population. Of the
total enrolled, 24 percent are
women and 31 percent are
married.
