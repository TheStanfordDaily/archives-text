## Soviets say they will destroy chemical weapons stockpile 
### 
PARIS (AP) â€” The Soviet Un
ion will destroy its massive stock
piles of chemical weapons starting
this year, Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze announced
yesterday.
Secretary of State George
Shultz said Shevardnadze
promised him the Soviets will also
look into U.S. allegations Libya
has a plant to produce chemical
weapons.
Addressing an international
conference on chemical weapons,
Shevardnadze said the Soviet Un
ion is finishing construction of a
chemical arms elimination facility
that will begin operation this year.
He said his country would not
wait for an accord to be reached
at Geneva talks on chemical weap
ons before beginning to destroy
its stockpiles.
American delegates said the
Soviets were simply playing
"catch-up." A senior U.S. official
said the United States had been

routinely destroying aging chemi
cal weapons since the early 1980s.
Shevardnadze said representa
tives of other countries will be
invited to visit the Soviet facility,
but he did not say when.
He said the Soviet position had
"changed quite radically" in the
recent past, going from manufac
turing chemical weapons to aban
doning them altogether.
"When you get into the facts of
the matter, it is that we have
been doing the same kinds of
things," said Lynn Hansen, direc
tor of the bureau of multilateral
affairs at the U.S. Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency.
The Soviet position "now cor
responds to our own position,"
Hansen said. "We simply don't get
the press, because for us it's more
routine .. . When they do it, all
of a sudden it's news."
The five-day conference was
marked by conflicts involving
Middle Eastern countries.

Delegates from 16 Arab nations
said any ban on chemical weapons
must be accompanied by nuclear
disarmament.
Iraqi Vice Premier Tarik Aziz,
in a fiery speech Sunday to about
80 foreign ministers among the
delegates from 150 nations, ac
cused Israel of posing "a serious
threat to the security of Arab na
tions."
He said Israel kept "nuclear
weapons as well as chemical weap
ons and missiles that can reach
many Arab cities."
Israel called the Iraqi statement
"blatant hypocrisy." Iraq is known
to have used chemical weapons in
its eight-year war with Iran.
The conference is aimed at
giving new political impetus to a
1925 Geneva Protocol that
prohibits the use of such toxic
chemical and biological agents.
Shevardnadze said representa
tives of other countries will be
invited to visit the Soviet facility.
