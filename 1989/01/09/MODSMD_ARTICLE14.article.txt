# Libya denies chemical production

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Libya's
foreign minister said yesterday
that his country has no intention
"for the time being" to produce
chemical weapons but is seriously
worried about possible U.S. mili
tary action against Libya.
Foreign Minister Jadalla Azouz
Ettalhi, interviewed on the CBS
program "Face the Nation,"
asserted that Western observers
would be invited to inspect a plant
near Tripoli once the facility is
ready to start up.
The United States contends
that the Rabta plant, about 60
miles southwest of the Libyan
capital, is a factory for producing
poison gas. Libyan officials say it
is a pharmaceutical plant.

In Paris, Secretary of State
George Shultz said yesterday the
Soviet Union promised to look into
U.S. allegations about the plant.
Shultz said he outlined the U.S.
position to Soviet Foreign Minis
ter Eduard Shevardnadze at an
international conference on
chemical weapons and that Shev
ardnadze said the Soviets would
make their own inquiry.
"Since he cares about the sub
ject and the Soviet Union cares
about the subject, there is no
doubt the questions (to Libya) will
be pointed," Shultz told reporters
just before leaving Paris.
Several U.S. senators said in
televised interviews Sunday that
the United States should retain

the option of taking military ac
tion to knock out the plant if talks
with Libya prove unsuccessful.
Ettalhi said: "I don't, think our
know-how will enable us — even
if we decided to do (so) — to
produce chemical weapons in the
very near future. . . . We have
never had a plan to produce
chemical weapons."
Under further questioning, the
Libyan official qualified his posi
tion, saying, "We have no plan for
the time being."
Ettalhi said the Rabta plant
would be opened for inspection by
Western diplomats, journalists
and technical specialists once it is
ready to start up operations. He
gave no specific date for this.
