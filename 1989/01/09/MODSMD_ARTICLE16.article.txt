# Students moving right, study says

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
college class of 1992: They're
starting to smoke more. They may
be losing interest in business
careers. And they overwhelmingly
favor mandatory AIDS and drug
testing.
These were some of the findings
in the 23rd annual survey of in
coming college freshmen by the
American Council on Education
and the Higher Education Re
search Institute at the UCLA.
The wide-ranging survey also
found that entering college fresh
men are getting less aid from the
federal government and are in
creasingly interested in college as
a means to land a high-paying job.
And the proportion of freshmen
who identified their political views
as conservative or far right was
a record 21.8 percent. But large
majorities of students took tradi

tionally liberal positions when
asked about specific issues rang
ing from pollution and disarma
ment to abortion and consumer
protection.
"It's because of the beating the
word liberal has taken," said Ken
neth Green of UCLA, associate
director of the survey. "A lot of
them think liberal means im
potent."
The survey found students be
coming increasingly conservative
on matters related to crime and
the death penalty. And two-thirds
of incoming 1988 freshmen agreed
that "the best way to control AIDS
is through widespread, manda
tory testing," while 71 percent
agreed that "employers should be
allowed to require drug testing of
employees or job applicants."
The findings are based on ques
tionnaires filled out by 308,007

freshmen entering 585 two- and
four-year colleges and univer
sities. The results were adjusted
to reflect the total population of
1.64 million first-time, full-time
entering students, and have a mar
gin of error of plus or minus 2
percent.
One of the most dramatic find
ings was a rise in the number of
students who said they were fre
quent smokers, reversing a 22-
year decline. In 1966, 16.6 percent
of the freshmen said they were
frequent smokers. That fell
steadily to 8.9 percent in 1987,
but rose to 10.1 percent among
those entering college last fall.
In addition, a record high per
centage of freshmen (10.5 percent)
said they frequently felt de
pressed, while a declining propor
tion rated their emotional health
as above average.
