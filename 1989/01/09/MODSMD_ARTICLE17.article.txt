Ortega charges heavily criticized
SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) — President
Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua was heavily criticized
yesterday for suggesting that postponing a Cen
tral American summit would endanger a regional
peace plan.
Ortega on Friday said Costa Rican President
Oscar Arias' proposal to delay the Jan. 15-16
summit of Central American presidents until after
President-elect George Bush's inauguration could
"practically kill" the peace plan.
Arias suggested the delay Friday, saying it
would give Bush time to formulate a Central
American policy. Bush takes office Jan. 20.
"The statement of President Ortega is out of
line and clumsy," Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos
Rivera was quoted as saying Sunday in the San
Jose newspaper La Nacion.
"We reject what Ortega said, because everybody
knows that our president and our people are the
ones most interested in seeking peace in our
region," Rivera said.
Arias won the Nobel Peace Prize for authoring
the peace plan, signed by the Central American
presidents in August 1987.
The summit, to be held in San Salvador, is
intended to advance the stalled peace plan, which
calls for negotiated solutions to civil wars in

Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala, political
amnesties and democratization.
On Saturday, Ortega said Arias' proposal "is
under consultation and the meeting definitely
has not been suspended." Ortega said he opposed
any delay of the summit.
British plane crash leaves 30 dead
KEGWORTH, England (AP) — A Belfast
bound jetliner carrying 126 people crashed near
a highway in central England yesterday and broke
into pieces, killing at least 32 people and trapping
several more in the wreckage, officials said.
Police said 76 people were injured.
The British Midland Airways Boeing 737-400
was en route from London's Heathrow Airport
to Northern Ireland when it developed engine
trouble, the Civil Aviation Authority said.
The jet attempted to land at East Midlands
Airport near Nottingham, about 100 miles north
of London, but undershot the runway by a half
mile and crashed alongside a highway, smashed
into an embankment and broke apart, police said.
Witnesses reported seeing an engine in flames
as the aircraft came in low, dropping bits of
debris and sheering off treetops as it careened
toward the highway.
