Hiring of Elway's
successor starts new
era in Stanford sports

The search is over.
After a dozen interviews and
a nationwide hunt for a new
football coach, Stanford found Jack
Elway's replacement in nearby San
Francisco.
His name is Dennis Green, and
he is leaving his job with the San
Francisco 49ers, where he works
under Bill Walsh as the receivers
coach, after the Super Bowl.
To Dennis Green: We extend our
warmest of welcomes. To Athletic
Director Andy Geiger and the
search committee: We extend our
thanks. You had a very difficult
task and it seems you made an
excellent choice.
It seemed like the papers named
a new candidate every other day,
including some guy from Valdosta
State. (It's in Georgia, by the way.)
The search committee remained
cool and continued to go about its
business without letting the press
make the choice for them.
But in the end, it was Green,
one of the first names mentioned
and a man with Stanford experi
ence. He served as running backs
coach in the glory days when Walsh
piloted the Cardinal to back-to
back bowl games in the late '70s.
On one level it seems like the
same, cool-headed choice. Green's
been here before and is associated
with a better time in the annals
of Stanford football.
He also pulled off the seemingly
impossible feat of breaking North
western University's record losing
streak in the early '80s. Clearly,
the man knows how to turn around
a program and win games.
Finally, Green has stated
categorically that he intends to win

by throwing the football. To Stan
ford fans who recall the halcyon
days of legends like John Brodie,
Heisman Trophy winner Jim
Plunkett and John Elway, those
words are like sweet music.
At the same time, the choice was
a bold one. Despite his recent ten
ure in the professional ranks,
where the bottom line is measured
by winning, Green clearly has not
lost sight of the fact that college
football is different.
At his first press conference
here, he referred only to student
athletes, not simply athletes. One
imagines Green will work to bring
Stanford's already excellent grad
uation rate nearer to the phenom
enal levels achieved at perennial
power Notre Dame.
The choice is also daring because
Green is black, the first black coach
in the Pacific 10 Conference as a
matter of fact.
When University President
Donald Kennedy visited The Dai
ly's offices last fall, a reporter
asked him what Stanford was
doing to foster the hiring of mi
nority coaches in light of all the
national scrutiny the issue had re
ceived.
Kennedy noted with regret the
departure of basketball assistant
Kermit Washington, who was at
tempting a comeback in the NBA.
Kennedy added that Stanford was
making an effort to hire minorities
and to help those working at Stan
ford to obtain better coaching jobs
if they became available elsewhere.
While no one is suggesting that
Green was hired because he is
black, it is most pleasing to see
Stanford live up to its progressive
tradition by hiring Green, who be
comes only the fourth active coach
in Division-IA who is black.
Let us hope Green becomes a
fixture on campus for years to
come. Let us also hope that he
presides over a new glorious era
for Stanford football.
