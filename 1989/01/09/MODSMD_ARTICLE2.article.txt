## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Stanford sports fans who bleed cardinal
and white are seeing a new color these
days: Green, as in Dennis Green, Stanford's
new football coach following an announce
ment by Athletic Director Andy Geiger last
week.
Green, the Big Ten Coach of the Year
in 1982 at Northwestern University, is cur
rently the receivers coach for the San Fran
cisco 49ers. Led by Green's star pupil, Jerry
Rice, who has five touchdown catches in
two playoff games, the 49ers will meet the
Cincinnati Bengals in the Super Bowl Jan.
22.
"Dennis possesses outstanding experi
ence both on the collegiate and professional
level," Geiger said. "I greet this appoint
ment with absolute enthusiasm for the fu
ture of the Stanford football program and
with positive expectations for the entire
Stanford community."
Green replaces Jack Elway who was fired
Dec. 15. Elway was 25-29-2 in five years
at Stanford, including a 3-6-2 mark last
season. Green becomes only the fourth
black head football coach currently in Di
vision I-A and the first in Pacific 10 Con
ference history.
Green has been working two jobs since
the announcement. In addition to preparing
the 49er receivers for the NFC Champion
ship game, a 28-3 victory over the Chicago
Bears yesterday, he will continue with San

Francisco through the Super Bowl on Jan.
22.
He also has much catching up to do on
the Farm. Green has been interviewing po
tential assistant coaches and introducing
himself to Stanford's current players and
high school recruits. He has said he will
accept applications from ail current Stan
ford assistant coaches and has received in
numerable messages from other applicants
nationwide.
The signing date for high school letters
of-intent is Feb. 8, and Green has the task
of trying to convince the recruits to attend
Stanford.
While Stanford's entrance requirements
makes recruiting top athletes more diffi
cult, Green has experience in that area
after serving as the head coach at North
western for five seasons.
"It's been done before and that's what
I can relate to," Green said about finding
qualified student-athletes. "We know it can
be done; it's a big country. I'm going to
find the best student I can find who is also
a great football player. I can find them."
Green was hired at Northwestern in 1981
and although the Wildcats went 0-11 that
season, Green's squad snapped a 34-game
losing streak the following year. North
western went 3-8 in 1982, 2-7 and eighth
place in the Big Ten. That was the Wildcats'
best record, and first time out of last place
in the conference, since 1975 and earned
