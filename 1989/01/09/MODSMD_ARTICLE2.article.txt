# Cardinal football gets new head coach
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Stanford sports fans who bleed cardinal
and white are seeing a new color these
days: Green, as in Dennis Green, Stanford's
new football coach following an announce
ment by Athletic Director Andy Geiger last
week.
Green, the Big Ten Coach of the Year
in 1982 at Northwestern University, is cur
rently the receivers coach for the San Fran
cisco 49ers. Led by Green's star pupil, Jerry
Rice, who has five touchdown catches in
two playoff games, the 49ers will meet the
Cincinnati Bengals in the Super Bowl Jan.
22.
"Dennis possesses outstanding experi
ence both on the collegiate and professional
level," Geiger said. "I greet this appoint
ment with absolute enthusiasm for the fu
ture of the Stanford football program and
with positive expectations for the entire
Stanford community."
Green replaces Jack Elway who was fired
Dec. 15. Elway was 25-29-2 in five years
at Stanford, including a 3-6-2 mark last
season. Green becomes only the fourth
black head football coach currently in Di
vision I-A and the first in Pacific 10 Con
ference history.
Green has been working two jobs since
the announcement. In addition to preparing
the 49er receivers for the NFC Champion
ship game, a 28-3 victory over the Chicago
Bears yesterday, he will continue with San

Francisco through the Super Bowl on Jan.
22.
He also has much catching up to do on
the Farm. Green has been interviewing po
tential assistant coaches and introducing
himself to Stanford's current players and
high school recruits. He has said he will
accept applications from ail current Stan
ford assistant coaches and has received in
numerable messages from other applicants
nationwide.
The signing date for high school letters
of-intent is Feb. 8, and Green has the task
of trying to convince the recruits to attend
Stanford.
While Stanford's entrance requirements
makes recruiting top athletes more diffi
cult, Green has experience in that area
after serving as the head coach at North
western for five seasons.
"It's been done before and that's what
I can relate to," Green said about finding
qualified student-athletes. "We know it can
be done; it's a big country. I'm going to
find the best student I can find who is also
a great football player. I can find them."
Green was hired at Northwestern in 1981
and although the Wildcats went 0-11 that
season, Green's squad snapped a 34-game
losing streak the following year. North
western went 3-8 in 1982, 2-7 and eighth
place in the Big Ten. That was the Wildcats'
best record, and first time out of last place
in the conference, since 1975 and earned

Green Big Ten Coach-of-the-Year
honors. Green finished with a 10-
45 record at Northwestern and
his East squad set a Hula Bowl
record with 341 yards passing in
winning the 1985 contest.
Green then left Evanston, 111.
to join Bill Walsh with the 49ers.
Earlier, Green helped revive the
Stanford passing tradition as an
assistant coach under Walsh and
Paul Wiggin. As the running
backs coach under Walsh in 1977
and 1978, Green recruited Darrin
Nelson, Stanford's all-time
leading rusher and receiver. After
following Walsh to the 49ers for
one season, Green returned to
serve as offensive coordinator un
der Wiggin in 1980.
That season, the combination
of Green's offensive schemes and
John Elway's right arm produced
27 touchdowns and 2,939 yards
of total offense, both second-best
in Pac-10 history.
"Denny Green is one of the top
football minds in the country,"
Walsh said earlier in Green's
career. "He made a real impact
on the Stanford program when he
helped form an offensive style that
remains a trademark of Stanford
football."
"I believe in an exciting passing
attack, similar offensively to what
we had in 1980," Green said in a
press conference last week.
"Defensively, we want to empha
size up-front play. Our objective
will be to bolster as much as pos

lines . . . and from there develop
our passing game.
"We will try to be a team that
is situation-oriented, that will
really rely on the pass rush on
passing downs, on moving the ball
around as far as the quarterback
rolling out or throwing from the
pocket, on trying to force a team
to try to stop what we do best. . . .
We want to make sure we get
them to match up our best player
against their worst player."
Despite being known as an
offensively-minded coach, Green
announced he plans on hiring an
offensive coordinator, a move
than Elway did not make. Criti
cisms of Elway's play-calling are
believed to have been a part of
the reason for his dismissal. It
was reported Elway's players also
had difficulties dealing with him
but Green is considered to be "a
player's coach."
The Cardinal returns 17 of 23
starters next season and Green
has already announced he is set
ting his sights on a bowl game,
and he has mentioned the two
magic words, "Rose Bowl" as a
possiblity.
