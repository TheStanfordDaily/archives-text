## Cream of the what? 
### 
AH, WINTER QUARTER. Footballs
are traded in for basketballs, sun
shine for the long, dark days of
California's pseudo-winter. Seniors don
power suits as hungry college recruiters
begin to swarm Stanford in search of
"the best and the brightest" in the coun
try, in the world or in our minds.
The "band b" phrase, mantra of college
recruiters, is nothing new to Stanford
seniors. We all know well the weight
which the Stanford name carries outside
the "Stanford community"; we face this
as soon as we get our acceptance letters.
The summer before I transferred to
Stanford, I met many people during an
internship in Washington, D.C. They
responded with disinterest when I named
the small, challenging college that I had
attended for the past two years. Once I
mentioned my plan to transfer to Stan
ford, their disinterest faded to respect.
All within ten seconds.
Stanford does its best to foster this
view among the students who from fresh
man year onward are reassured and
reminded of their elite status. Average
SAT scores are quoted, the phenomenal
achievements of some of our classmates
are well-publicized, and again, we hear
the "band b" phrase.
By senior year, those who choose may
reap the rewards of the completion of
four years at a select university. Most of
the top companies visit only the "top"
universities, to ferret out the so-called
cream of the "band b" crop.
The "band b" assumption does not
end with these recruiters, however. The
rest of the job market also tends to

reward Stanford grads.
Surprisingly, some graduate schools, in
cluding the prestigious Boalt School of
Law at the UC-Berkeley, assume that
because Stanford students compete
among the "band b" they must kick up
the already inflated Stanford grade-point
averages by ten percent in order to com
pare our averages to those of others.
In my own experience, I have found
that Stanford students also share the as
sumption of elitism.
At a party last year, two recent grad
uates embarrassed themselves by pro
claiming that non-Stanford graduates
must prove their intelligence, while Stan
ford graduates automatically receive this
honor.
This attitude forces many questions.
Among them, how does one judge success
or intelligence? Too many students seem
to rely upon their Stanford degrees,
rather than on their performance or ac
complishments, for the answer.
The question that follows logically con
cerns admissions. If one assumes that
students here are in some way "better,"
this implies that the admissions process
selects the "best" from the applications
available, and is therefore absolute. It is
not.
As the Office of Admissions will attest,
demand for Stanford admissions far out
weighs the supply. Because so many well
qualified students apply, admissions at a
certain level becomes a matter of chance.
To use a personal example, Stanford
rejected me as a high school senior, but
accepted me among the transfer class
two years later. Statistically, it is twice

as difficult to be accepted as a transfer
than as a freshman. I was rejected — I
was not good enough — when admittance
was easier and accepted when it was more
difficult.
What happened? I had not changed
significantly during those two years.
I give you my case as an example only
because I would like to point out the
logical inconsistencies in assuming that
chance is not involved in the admissions
process.
The process at a certain level is, un
derstandably, random. If I had chosen
not to reapply, should I be judged as less
bright? Less superior? And what of those
who could have been accepted but did
not even apply, or those who were ac
cepted but chose to go elsewhere?
We are all aware of the privileges that
the Stanford name may bring. Seniors
will soon learn just how far the name
may take them in the job search or in
their applications to graduate school.
We should all remember, though, that
the fact that we are able to use the
Stanford name, to fall under the category
of "the best and the brightest," is due
to a somewhat random choice. Just some
thing to keep in mind the the next time
you hear those loaded words.
