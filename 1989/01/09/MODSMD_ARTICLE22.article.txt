## Arms control staff not entitled to academic tenure 
### 
This cherished prize of
academia should be
controlled as it currently is
— by and for the academic
faculty who are affiliated
with a department.

INTERDISCIPLINARY institutions
such as the Hoover Institution, the
Center for International Security
and Arms Control and the Stanford

Linear Accelerator Center are invalua
ble to the University community and
its international prestige.
Indeed, most everyone would agree
that the University's achievements are
in part measured by those of the
interdisciplinary centers.
However, researchers in the field of
arms control who are not already
employed by a department at Stanford
should want to come to the arms
control center because of the quality of
the work produced there, because of its
tremendous reputation and endowment
and for the chance to make an impact
in so vital an area as world peace —

not because they will be granted
professorial tenure.
This cherished prize of academia
should be controlled as it currently is
— by and for the academic faculty who
are affiliated with a department.
Ted Postol recently announced that
he might go to MIT or Harvard Uni
versity. Will these institutions give him
tenure just for researching at their
interdisciplinary centers? Probably not.
While the center is as important here
as it is to other institutions, univer
sities cannot mortgage the hard work
and dedicated contributions made by
department faculty, which are geared

toward the student population.
Remember, Postol and Ride, your
efforts and accomplishments are inspir
ing to us all, but professors should be
first and foremost teachers; com
municators of knowledge to the people
that pay to come to this university.
While I applaud the contributions
made to society by the staff at Hoover,
SLAC and the arms control center, I
cannot see how these people think that
they are entitled to academic tenure
without being hired by a department
and teaching classes therein.
