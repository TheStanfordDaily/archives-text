# Blaming Christians won't solve problem
## 
### 
I tend to disagree somewhat with
Ashley Ryan's column on religious
intolerance regarding her statement on
how the people of Stanford feel.
I come from a Christian background
(but my grandparents were Jewish),
and I feel that her idea that Christian
faith teaches us to look down on other
religions is wrong.
I don't feel that Christmas is any
more important than any other reli
gious holidays. Saying Christmas is
totally unimportant in our society,
however, is not possible. It would be
like saying the Chinese New Year isn't
important to the Chinese.
The point is not that we don't
tolerate other religions; it's the prob
lem of tradition. Although America is
still very young in worldy terms, we
have a heritage which stems mainly
from our Protestant ancestors.
Today America has changed con
siderably. Even though surveys say that
there is a majority of Christians, there

are still many other religions.
To recognize every holiday from
every religion would be a little ridic
ulous. I do agree that the important
ones should be recognized, though. To
Christians, Christmas and Easter are
important, to the Jewish community it
may be Yom Kippur.
It's not that our society doesn't want
to recognize other religions, its just
that our system of business (e.g. when
they take holidays) has been centered
around this Christian tradition. To
blame it on the Christian faith is
wrong. To get rid of the Christmas
tree won't solve anything.
I'd like to think that Stanford is
unique in its ability to try new things,
regardless of the consequences. A bet
ter idea would be to have other decora
tions put up on other holidays.
We should begin to understand why
people are drawn toward their religions
and what their religious holidays mean
to them. This takes time, but once an
understanding is reached, there won't
be so much prejudice (from ignorance)
toward other religious holidays.
