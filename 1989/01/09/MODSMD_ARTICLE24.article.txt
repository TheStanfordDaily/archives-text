# Cohn and Review sharply criticized
## 
### 
In his letter to The Daily, French
Prof. Robert Cohn has moved Stan
ford's "Great Debate" to an unprecen
dented low point. He judges the content
of my teaching on a title and a pref
ace, both of which he misquotes.
He also slanders my ability to teach
Augustine (and presumably my ability
to teach the other "classics" on the
reading list â€” Genesis, Freud, Weber
and Marx).
Finally, whatever his intentions, I
regard his remark about authors with
"knives in their teeth" as a racial slur
altogether too familiar to Chicanos and
other people of color.
I should add that the Stanford
Review, whose style and nerve Cohn
likes, conducted itself in a thoroughly
unprofessional manner. Their
"reporter" spoke to me, by his own
admission, after the story was largely
written. He then asked me whether I
"agreed" or "disagreed" with three
questions (I agreed with two and dis-

agreed with the third).
Like the entire article, which bore
only an accidental resemblance to the
course, the remarks attributed to me
within quotation marks had little to do
with anything I said.
I believe that the unprofessional
conduct of the "reporters" for the
Stanford Review should result in it no
longer receiving funds from the ASSU.
Indeed, any further such violations, in
my view, should result in stronger
measures. Verbal mugging should not
be passed off as honest reporting.
I also believe that Cohn owes me a
public apology for his attack on my
integrity as a teacher, a scholar, a citi
zen of the republic of Stanford and a
fellow member of the human race.
