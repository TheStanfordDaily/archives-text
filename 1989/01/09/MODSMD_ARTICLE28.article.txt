## Repression and fear encircle lives of Salvadoran refugees Two students aid refugee relief effort in Honduras

The Salvadoran military rapidly descended onto
the village, gathered all of the people into the village
center and divided the men from the women and
children. The soldiers proceeded to kill all of the
village men. Then they killed the women.
One woman escaped. She found a hiding place
and lived — the only survivor of her massacred
village. Concealed, she listened to the soldiers discuss
their plans for'the children, including her own.
They decided to kill the children also.
With tears in her eyes, Stanford medical student
Alexandra Wilson told the story of this Salvadoran
woman refugee. The horrors of her tale grew all
too familiar to Wilson and sophomore Marta Romero
last summer as they worked together in the Salva
doran refugee camps in Honduras, where nearly
every campesino could tell a story similar to this one.
For nearly three months, the duo worked as vol
unteers through the Catholic Relief Center, in Sal
vadoran refugee camps three miles from the
Salvadoran border in Honduras. The United Nations
oversees the three camps — Mesa Grande, Colomon

cagua and San Antonio — providing nominal safety
for approximately 13,000 Salvadoran refugees.
At Colomoncagua, surrounded by Honduran mil
itary forces and bombs occasionally exploding in
the neighboring mountains of El Salvador, Romero
worked with children and mothers at a guarderia,
a crude form of a day-care center. Wilson, who
worked at all three camps, taught classes on first
aid and general health care.
Most of the refugees fled their country in the
early 1980s because of large-scale military opera
tions in El Salvador aimed at ridding the countryside
of left-wing guerilla forces, and crushing a rising
popular movement.
The El Salvadoran government, nominally run by
the Social Democratic party headed by Napolean
Duarte, has allowed the right-wing military forces
to act with ruthless independence in their war
against the opposition which rose up in the early
1980s. It has been reported that in 1980-1981,
Salvadoran death squads killed approximately 800
citizens every month.
Because the guerilla forces have had their roots
in the countryside, the military has followed them,
hunting them out with raids and aerial bombing.
In the process, they have terrorized the peasantry
— which is considered a hostile force, sympathetic
to the opposition.
The military's moves to depopulate the country

side have resulted in death tolls reported to be as
high as 70,000 people since 1980, and have forced
many peasants to flee as both internal and external
refugees, either to the capital or to camps such as
the ones where Wilson and Romero worked.
Wilson said she regularly heard stories about how
the Salvadoran military "went into villages and
killed everyone and everything."
Although a small number of refugees left El Sal
vador for political reasons, "I think most of them
were farmers who were in the wrong place," said
Wilson.
The United States grants billions of dollars of aid
to the El Salvadoran government — the third highest
amount yearly after Israel and Egypt, and the most
in Latin America.
In addition to economic aid, the American gov
ernment has supplied the Salvadoran military with
military hardware such as the planes and bombs
used in fighting guerillas in the villages. Likewise,
American military advisers are stationed in the
capital, San Salvadore.
According to Wilson, Honduran military forces,
surrounding the camps 24 hours a day, prevented
refugees from leaving and entering the camps. Al
though El Salvador and Honduras are traditional
enemies, since the 1979 Nicaraguan revolution they
have found common ground in their opposition to
domestic leftist forces and the leftist government
in Nicaragua.
Although Honduras has tolerated the displaced
Salvadorans, they have not been sympathetic or
provided substantial amounts of relief to the refu
gees. These services have fallen largely to interna
tional organizations, such as the United Nations
and the Catholic Church, who have brought the
refugees' cause to global attention, and continue to
support the camps.
Despite the refugees' immobility and limited re
sources, "they've organized themselved incredibly,"
said Wilson.
With help from international groups, the refugees
educate themselves through various workshops
ranging from sanitation to shoemaking.
Trained by foreign workers, the refugees have
also established a technical school, where they teach
skills in administration and mechanics. Romero
taught geometry and typing skills at the technical
school twice a week.
During a workshop on burns, a refugee asked
Wilson how to treat a napalm burn. Because the
United States supplies the Salvadoran army eco
nomic and military aid, Wilson contended that the
napalm undoubtedly came from the United States.
In addition to attending daily workshops, the ref
ugees produce their own food to support themselves.
They grow crops and raise animals. Their main diet
consists of tortillas, rice, beans and Occasionally
eggs.
Romero was sick with an upset stomach and a
cold through her entire stay. But her impoverished

really appreciate international
support. They know if they're
forgotten, they're at the

hosts several times managed to give her an orange,
as "a really special treat," she said.
Although relief agencies have been worried that
chronic malnutrition is getting worse in the camps,
according to Wilson, their efforts have had to be
directed elsewhere.
Romero said "most of their struggle has gone
into fighting the repression" of the Honduran mil
itary. According to Romero, the military often
