# Pursuing a Masters in swimming?

More than just the spirit of 1987 graduate
Pablo Morales lingers in the swimming lanes
of deGuerre Pool. Morales, winner of three
medals in the 1984 Olympic Games and a
world-record holder in the 100-meter but
terfly, is back at Stanford coaching the
Masters swim team.
The Stanford Masters team is part of a
national organization of adult swimming
teams open to anyone age 19 to 90 who is
interested in organized workouts, instruc
tion and the possibility of competition. The
team's only direct affiliation with Stanford
is its coach — one of Stanford swimming's
greatest progeny.
Morales puts an exceptional amount of
energy into his coaching. At 6 a.m. and 6
p.m. on weekdays, he can be seen charging
up and down the sides of the pool yelling
"Work those legs!" and "Go all out on this
one!"
Skip Kenney, coach of the Stanford men's
swim team, says that "anyone interested in
swimming would be crazy not to take ad
vantage of having a coach like Pablo." Ac
cording to Kenney, "Pablo gives more
attention to detail in his swimming than
any other person that I've ever coached,
and he's just as thorough in his coaching."
There is no question that Morales takes
his coaching very seriously. The fact that
he shows up at the pool in a suit and tie
every day only exaggerates his seriousness.
Morales, who will attend Cornell Law School
this fall, currently sandwiches a full-time
job at a Palo Alto law firm between his
morning and evening Masters workouts. Al
though working from 6 a.m. until 8:30 p.m.
most days does not sound like the typical
lifestyle of a former Olympian, Morales says
he finds it very rewarding.
While some of the team members swam
in high school and college, for many the
Masters team is their first exposure to com
petitive swimming. Morales finds the vari
ance in his swimmers' experience a
challenge. And he enjoys working with

novices as much as working with the elite
swimmers. "The novices have a willingness
to learn that allows them to make
breakthrough times in every workout," he
says.
The Masters team also keeps him in touch
with the world of swimming in a new and
positive way. This summer, Morales missed
qualifying for the 1988 Olympics by a slim
margin and, after having spent the previous
year doing nothing but swimming, eating
and sleeping, he was not sure how swimming
would continue to figure into his life.
"The [Olympic] trials were a disappointing
time for me," Morales says, "but I didn't
want to build a gap between myself and my
swimming because so much of who I am
today comes from my experience in the pool.
Coaching provides the opportunity to stay
involved; it keeps me under water, so to
speak."
And Morales is keeping a lot of enthusi
astic swimmers under water as well. At
times, he even gets in the water with them.
By swimming alongside or beneath his team
members, he can scrutinize their strokes
from a better angle than standing poolside.
It also gives the novices a chance to see
Pablo Morales doing what Pablo does best.
One team member, Dane Spearing, says
that by getting in the water, Morales makes
them work harder and shows them how
much more they are capable of doing. "When
Pablo tells me to race him, he of course
blows my doors off, but my time improves
significantly." A former water polo player
in college, Spearing joined the Masters team
because he was "feeling like a soft sponge."
What started as a fitness regimen has turned
competitive, and Spearing says he would
like to start completing in meets.
For many Masters swimmers, the goal of
the competitions is not to beat other swim
mers but to challenge themselves. Julie
Pacque, a research associate in geology who
swims with the Masters team, says compet
ing in meets gives her the incentive to ex
ercise. She points to Morales' coaching for
much of her recent success, including a per

sonal best in a meet at San Francisco State
University where she cut her time in the
100-meter freestyle by eight-tenths of a sec
ond.
Qualifying times are not required for any
of the competitions; instead, they are or
ganized by age group. Relay teams, for ex
ample, are designed by aggregate age, so it
is necessary to combine swimmers over a
broad range of ages. The most popular event
in every meet, the relay races bring young
and old together in a kind of competition
that diminishes any generation gap that
might have existed.
The official philosophy of Masters swim
ming is "to foster the sport and encourage
health among its members." Morales says
the common link that joins the various team
members together is their desire to become
better, faster swimmers. If you ask the
swimmers, they say that they're in it for
the fun. In any case, Masters provides the
framework that allows swimmers to achieve
their goal, whether it be athletic prowess,
fitness or fun.
