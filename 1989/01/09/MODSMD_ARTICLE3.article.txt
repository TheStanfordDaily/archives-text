# Mice infected with AIDS in order to study disease
##

In a step that brings scientists closer
to an understanding of how AIDS
works, Stanford researchers an
nounced last month that they have
infected mice with the AIDS virus.
The report of the research, pub
lished Dec. 23, comes exactly three
months after the same scientists re
ported implanting the compo
nents of the human immune system
into mice. The research takes scientists
one step closer to using mice to study

the infection of HIV, the AIDS virus.
One of the researchers, postdoctoral
fellow Mike McCune, told the Univer
sity News Service, "there has been a
need for a small animal model in which
one can directly study the human im-

murie system and infection with HIV.
Now we have an animal that can be
studied in a rational and systematic
manner in the laboratory."
Although the infection was observed
to spread throughout the bodies of the
mice, the researchers reported that
they do not yet know whether the
mice would develop the full AIDS
symptoms.
Science magazine published the
paper describing the research headed
by McCune and Irvine Weissman, a
professor of cancer biology and pathol
ogy. Two other teams of scientists also

reported similar successes in the same
issue of the magazine.
In September, the same researchers
reported in Science that they were suc
cessfully able to implant human
tissues from the fetal thymus, spleen
and lymph node into mutant mice lack
ing their own immune systems. These
three tissues are components of
the human immune system.
Although the scientists are only
studying the AIDS infection at present,
mice with human immune systems
might serve as animal models to study
other human infections
