## Miracle at Maples II: Card foils Arizona again Lichti scores career-high 35 points in win 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
It's been said that the second
birth goes a lot easier than the
first, but the rebirth of the Stan
ford men's basketball team Jan.
5 disproved that.
The first birth, against Arizona
last February, certainly did not
come easily, as the Cardinal
struggled against the mighty top
ranked Wildcats before eking out
an 82-74 win.

Men's Basketball
Cardinal 82, Wildcats 78

But on Thursday night, the
labor pains were much more se
vere and they came as often as
30 seconds apart: the amount of
time it would take Arizona's Sean
Elliott to lean in for a layup, get
the ball back, and then pop in a
3-point shot from the Stanford
Medical Center maternity ward.
In fact, most of the 7,500 doc
tors in the sellout Maples Pavilion
crowd, and even more watching
on national television, were ready
to pronounce Stanford dead as it
lay on the gurney with 11:58
remaining in the first half, trail
ing 21-4.
But after holding on for dear
life for the remainder of the half,
Stanford put into action its own
Lamaze method, softly and slowly
breathing the words, "Todd
Lichti. Todd Lichti." And as sure
as a good doctor carries through
an operation, Lichti revived Stan
ford.
In a game which proved with
the finality of a judge slamming
down his gavel that stars do shine
on college basketball's West Coast,
Lichti scored 27 of his career-high
35 points in the second half to
lead Stanford to an 83-78 triumph
over No. 8 Arizona.
Stanford, ranked 27th going
into the game but now a candidate
once again for the top 20, shot
70 percent (28-40) in the game, a
Maples Pavilion record. The Car

dinal is now 10-3 overall and 3-1
in the Pacific 10 Conference after
defeating Arizona State 94-65 Sat
urday. Arizona (9-2, 4-1) is in first
place in the conference after
beating California. UCLA (8-3, 3-
1) is tied with Stanford for second
place in the conference after
losing to Oregon State (9-3, 2-2)
yesterday.
Elliott also had 35 for the Wild
cats (21 in the first half) but it
wasn't enough to prevent the
Cobra and his Arizona teammates
from slithering out of Maples on
the losing end for the fifth
straight time.
"That was a tough one," Stan
ford Coach Mike Montgomery
said. "It's almost inconceivable to
me to be able to give up a 17-point
lead and be able to come back like
that."
After giving up 15 unanswered
points to fall behind 21-4, Stan
ford slowly began climbing back
into the game. But every time the
Cardinal would make some prog
ress in the first half, those awful
contractions would strike again to
complicate the labor.
Stanford's Bryan McSweeney
and Lichti hit two baskets to cut
the lead to 13, but Elliott came
back with a ringing slam off a
Ken Lofton alley-oop to keep it
at 23-8. Then Lichti and Howard
Wright scored, but Elliott
responded with a 24-foot bomb —
the third of five 3-pointers in the
first half for the Cobra.
Cardinal reserve guard Scott
Meinert hit two free throws, but
another Elliott trifecta boosted
the score to 29-14 with 8:45 left
in the first half.
Elliott and Arizona relented
enough to allow Stanford to get
within six with 1:27 left in the
half on a Wright dunk. But Ari
zona Coach Lute Olson called time
out — risky, considering how pre
cious time outs were likely to be
later on — but effective, as four
points by the 6-foot-11, 242-pound
freshman Arizona freight train
Sean Rooks lifted the Wildcats
back to a 10-point, 44-34 halftime
lead.

"They just had a phenomenal
start," Montgomery said. "Elliott
was shooting the lights out. (But)
I thought we could come back —
I really did."
"I know we came into the sec
ond half a little ticked at our
selves," Lichti said. Indeed, Stan
ford's problems were largely due
to 12 first-half turnovers — in
cluding five by Wright and four
by point guard Terry Taylor,
which offset 68.4 percent first-half
shooting.
The second half started off
ominously enough, as Wright
again lost the ball in the key and
Arizona's Harvey Mason went
coast-to-coast for a slam and a
12-point lead.
But Lichti scored six points and
point guard Terry Taylor hit a
3-pointer to cap a 12-1 run and
bring Stanford to within a point
with 14:49 left, 47-46.
With 12:45 left, Stanford center
Eric Reveno rebounded a botched
alley-oop attempt and popped in
a short jump hook to give Stanford
its first lead, 52-51.
The game remained painfully
close for the next four-plus
minutes. But with 7:27 left, Stan
ford got a steal. The ball was held
by sophomore Andrew Vlahov.
Vlahov put the baby in the good
doctor's hands.
"When I get in the open court,
I'm looking to create some things,
do some things on my own,"
Lichti said later. "In the last four
five games I had been looking for
the jump shot and they've been
giving me the drive. You've got
to take the drive if that's what
they're giving you."
Lichti received the ball about
60 feet from the basket. He raced
past one Wildcat, blew by Elliott
near the top of the key, and as
Matt Muehlebach fouled him,
layed it up and in.
Lichti converted the free throw,
and the next nine Cardinal points
as well. Stanford now led 71-62
with 5:13 remaining.
Last year, it was with approx


Michael Topolovac — Dally
Todd Lichti proved that he is one of the nation's premier shooting guards against No. 8 Arizona,
leading the Cardinal to victory with 27 points In the second half and 35 overall.
