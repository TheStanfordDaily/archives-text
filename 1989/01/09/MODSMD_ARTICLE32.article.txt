# Best in the West: Lichti guns down Cobra, Wildcats in Pac-10 shootout
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
It took over 10 minutes from the time
the game clock first showed four seconds
remaining to the time the final horn
sounded.
But when it was finally over, the ball
was in Todd Lichti's hands — where it
had been for much of the second half.
The finest player in the history of Stan
ford basketball had intercepted an Ari
zona inbounds pass and simply cradled
the ball as time ran out.
But that steal doesn't begin to tell the
story. Though Lichti has provided count
less memorable games in his tenure here,
none were more unforgettable than his
scintillating 27-point second half (he
finished with a career-best 35) that
nearly singlehandedly buried the No. 8
Arizona Wildcats Thursday night.

Lichti lit up the scoreboard with 7-of-10
shooting from the field and 13 consecu
tive swishes from the charity stripe in
the second stanza.
"I'm kind of used to Lichti," Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery would say after
the game about his senior shooting
guard's performance. "I just don't marvel
at the things he does anymore."
Montgomery may well have been the
only person in the sold out Maples Pa
vilion who didn't marvel at Lichti's per
formance — including Arizona Coach
Lute Olson. "Lichti played great," Olson
said. "I've been a backer of Todd Lichti's
forever.
"There were two great players on the
court (Lichti and Arizona's Sean Elliott),
they showed that tonight," he added.
While Elliott did match Lichti with 35
points of his own, it was the Stanford
star who brought his team the "W." With

the score tied at 60 and exactly eight
minutes remaining in the game, Todd
Lichti simply took over.
For his own part, Lichti said he was
simply looking to "create." He said there
were not really a lot of plays designed
for him and all he did was "try and take
it to the bucket."
He really doesn't do himself justice for
in the next 2:37 Lichti put on one of the
greatest shows many of the 7,500-plus
fans had ever seen.
First, he took the ball down two-thirds
of the court, blowing through the Wildcat
defense, scored and drew a foul from
Matt Muehlebach, 63-60 Cardinal. Next,
Lichti drew a Sean Rooks foul and sunk
two of his 15 consecutive free throws
(three shy of his own single-game Stan
ford record), 65-60.
Stanford center Derek Bruton then

made both free throws, 65-62.
Lichti then scored on a reverse layup,
67-62. A half-minute later, Ken Lofton
fouled him. Needless to say, two points
for Stanford and a 69-62 lead.
The Wildcats took a timeout. It didn't
help. The next time Stanford got the ball,
Andrew Vlahov fed Lichti for a layup,
71-62.
Those points completed an 11-2 Stan
ford run from which the Cardinal would
never look back. Todd Lichti's Herculean
effort provided the climax to a game that
earlier on seemed headed for a most for

gettable Arizona blowout.
In the first eight minutes of the game,
it seemed that Elliot would provide all
the highlights. The Ail-American scored
eight points, including two 3-pointers, as
the Wildcats powered to a 21-4 lead. Dur
ing the TV-timeout, it seemed likely that
the game was over. There would be no
repeat of last season's Miracle of Maples.
The Cardinal clawed its way back, how
ever. At halftime, the deficit was only 10
and a Stanford comeback was within the
realm of possibility.
Apparently, Lichti sensed that too.
Rumor has it that when the team checked
into the locker room at halftime, before
Montgomery arrived, Lichti stood on a
table and said something to the effect
of, "If I have anything to say about it,
we are not going to lose this game."
Even if it's not quite true, it'll make
for great scene in the movie.

only person in the sold out Maples Pa
vilion who didn't marvel at Lichti's per
formance — including Arizona Coach
Lute Olson. "Lichti played great," Olson
said. "I've been a backer of Todd Lichti's
forever.
"There were two great players on the
court (Lichti and Arizona's Sean Elliott),
they showed that tonight," he added.
While Elliott did match Lichti with 35
points of his own, it was the Stanford
star who brought his team the "W." With

the score tied at 60 and exactly eight
minutes remaining in the game, Todd
Lichti simply took over.
For his own part, Lichti said he was
simply looking to "create." He said there
were not really a lot of plays designed
for him and all he did was "try and take
it to the bucket."
He really doesn't do himself justice for
in the next 2:37 Lichti put on one of the
greatest shows many of the 7,500-plus
fans had ever seen.
First, he took the ball down two-thirds
of the court, blowing through the Wildcat
defense, scored and drew a foul from
Matt Muehlebach, 63-60 Cardinal. Next,
Lichti drew a Sean Rooks foul and sunk
two of his 15 consecutive free throws
(three shy of his own single-game Stan
ford record), 65-60.
Stanford center Derek Bruton then
fouled Arizona's Anthony Cook, who

I'm kind of used to Lichti.
I just don't marvel at the
things he does anymore.'

made both free throws, 65-62.
Lichti then scored on a reverse layup,
67-62. A half-minute later, Ken Lofton
fouled him. Needless to say, two points
for Stanford and a 69-62 lead.
The Wildcats took a timeout. It didn't
help. The next time Stanford got the ball,
Andrew Vlahov fed Lichti for a layup,
71-62.
Those points completed an 11-2 Stan
ford run from which the Cardinal would
never look back. Todd Lichti's Herculean
effort provided the climax to a game that
earlier on seemed headed for a most for

gettable Arizona blowout.
In the first eight minutes of the game,
it seemed that Elliot would provide all
the highlights. The Ail-American scored
eight points, including two 3-pointers, as
the Wildcats powered to a 21-4 lead. Dur
ing the TV-timeout, it seemed likely that
the game was over. There would be no
repeat of last season's Miracle of Maples.
The Cardinal clawed its way back, how
ever. At halftime, the deficit was only 10
and a Stanford comeback was within the
realm of possibility.
Apparently, Lichti sensed that too.
Rumor has it that when the team checked
into the locker room at halftime, before
Montgomery arrived, Lichti stood on a
table and said something to the effect
of, "If I have anything to say about it,
we are not going to lose this game."
Even if it's not quite true, it'll make
for great scene in the movie.
