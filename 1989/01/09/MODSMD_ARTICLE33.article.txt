LOS ANGELES - History
need not always repeat itself.
Refusing to repeat last year's
two-loss road trip to L.A. that
knocked the Cardinal off the
Pacific 10 Conference pinnacle,
the Stanford women's basketball
team blew past USC 89-50 Friday
night and eked out a 73-71 victory
at UCLA to earn the team's first
ever sweep of the traditionally
tough tandem.

Women's Basketball
Cardinal 89, Women of Troy 50
Cardinal 73. Bruins 71

Ranked No. 8 in the latest As
sociated Press poll, the Cardinal
now eryoys a 10-2 record overall
and a perfect 2-0 league mark.
The winning weekend began at
Loyola Marymount's Gersten Pa
vilion, USC's surrogate gym.
Greatly hampered by the absense
of Cherie Nelson, the Women of
Troy found no "home" court ad
vantage on the Gersten floor.
Nelson, a preseason All-
America and last year's Pac-10
Player of the Year, had been
suspended from the team indefi
nitely "for disciplinary reaspns"
by USC Coach Linda Sharp.
Though USC officials refused to
elaborate on the surprising action,
an anonymous source cited con
tinuing conflict between Nelson

and Sharp as the reason for the
suspension.
Sharp picked the wrong time
to indulge her emotions. Nelson,
who scored a career-high 41 points
in last year's Stanford-USC game
in Los Angeles and who leads the
team in both scoring (27.1 points
per game) and rebounding (10 per
game), has been the Trojans most
potent player since Cheryl Miller.
Her absence this weekend may
well have cost USC any chance
at the Pac-10 title.
The Women of Troy, however,
compensated well in the early
going, keeping the game close
throughout the first half. Even
with the second period blow out,
where Stanford outscored USC
56-25, forward Rosalind Hodge
managed to net 16 points while
guard Karon Howell contributed
14. Unfortunately, it was not
enough.
"Obviously she (Nelson) means
a lot to their team — when you
take away 28 points, it's a big
blow to an offense," Stanford
Coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"[But] I think a lot of players did
well in picking up the slack."
After a tight first half, Stanford
went off to the races offensively.
Spearheaded by guard Jennifer
Azzi, who garnered a game-high
21 points, the Cardinal showcased
its transition offense and tough
defense while giving everyone on
the bench a piece of the glory. For


April Pearson — Dally
Junior Jennifer Azzi led the women's basketball team to a sweep
over USC and UCLA, scoring 21 points against the Women of Troy.
