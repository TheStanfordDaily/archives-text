# Washington spoils spikers' Final Four plans
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — Even before play began
in the NCAA Tournament, most everyone in
tune with the women's volleyball world was
looking forward to the projected Stanford-
UCLA rematch in the West Regional final.
UCLA finished the regular season undefeated
and ranked No. 1 in the nation, and had given
the No. 2 Cardinal its only two losses.

With a seventh straight NCAA Final Four
appearance on the line for Stanford and the
first for the regional-host Bruins in three
years, the stage seemed set for the showdown
to end all showdowns, a clash of the spiking
titans.
Unfortunately for Stanford and the opti
mistic onlookers, Washington refused to follow
the script.
Fueled by the explosive hitting of Laurie
Wetzel and the on-target setting of Mountain
View-native Melinda Beckenhauer, the
Huskies handed Stanford its first regional
semifinal loss in NCAA Tournament history
with a shocking 15-11, 3-15, 9-15, 15-9, 15-8
victory.
The Cardinal concluded its season with an
impressive 28-3 record, but the tally was small
consolation for the championship-minded
team. Just two hours and four minutes after
its regional hopes began, Washington had
turned the UCLA rematch into an impossible
dream with a crushing fifth game win.
"It's hard to really get a handle on what

happened," Stanford Coach Don Shaw said
after the decisive game. "After we won the
second and third games, we went flat.
"Whenever we played anywhere near well,
we were in control of the match. But for the
most part, we just played poorly. You don't
come this far and get away with playing poorly,
and we were horrible out there in many cases."
The nightmare began immediately after the
first serve. The Cardinal overpassed Lisa
McCammond's serve into the spiking hand of
Beckenhauer, who put it down for a quick
point. The scoring didn't stop until the
Huskies had amassed a whopping 10-0 lead,
nine points of which were scored in just two
rotations.
Stanford was stunned. Though able to come
back and narrow the Husky lead, the first
game faltering never did leave the arena.
"The way we started the first game set the
tone for the evening," Shaw said. "If we would
have come out and played anywhere near
decently, we would have controlled the match,
but before we know it we were down 9-0."
It seemed that the Cardinal, like many of
the fans, had looked ahead to UCLA and
forgot about the Huskies. Suddenly, Washing
ton commanded more attention than the Car
dinal seemed able to muster.
"I think that could easily be said about our
team [after] the way we came out against
Washington, but we knew right away that
they were the team here now," Tracy Hughes
said. "Don said there was no future, and there
really wasn't. We got ourselves into a hole
right away, and all hopes of UCLA went right
out the window.
"We were playing a team that was playing
a really good match, and we were really flat.
Right away we were forced to think about
none other than Washington."

The Cardinal did just that in the next two
games, cruising to a two-games-to-one advan
tage and taking control of the match. With
just one more win, the effects of game one
would be erased.
The "under-'Dogs" refused to be van
quished, however, and after gaining a 2-1 lead
in the final game they never looked back.
"I really thought we had it in us," Wash
ington Coach Debbie Buse said. "I thought
we had played them close the last two times,
and I thought it needed to go five games for
us to win.
"We lost some composure in the second and
the third games, but in the third game we
started to inch our way back and regroup.
We just said, Take the fourth game, extend
it to five and the match is yours,' and they
really believed it and they went for it."
Card notes
Washington's winning ways were abruptly ended
the following evening in the regional final. True
to billing, UCLA emerged as the best team in the
West with a brisk three-game beating.
Though the Stanford loss was indeed a big upset,
it was not the largest of the tournament. In the
semifinal round of the Final Four, Texas over
whelmed UCLA in three games to advance to the
final match with Hawaii, last year's NCAA cham
pion.
The Bruins did get some consolation: It took the
NCAA champion to beat them. Texas upended the
Wahines to take the title, the first time a non-
Western team has done so.
The one bright spot of winter break for Stanford
came for Kristin Klein. Already deemed the Pacific
10 Conference Freshman of the Year and selected
to the All-Conference team, Klein became the only
freshman named first-team All-America this year.

Even the courageous play of Jennifer Chaffee, who led the Cardinal
in kills against Washington, was not enough to stave off an upset
in the NCAA West regionais.

we were in control of the match. But for the
most part, we just played poorly. You don't
come this far and get away with playing poorly,
and we were horrible out there in many cases."
The nightmare began immediately after the
first serve. The Cardinal overpassed Lisa
McCammond's serve into the spiking hand of
Beckenhauer, who put it down for a quick
point. The scoring didn't stop until the
Huskies had amassed a whopping 10-0 lead,
nine points of which were scored in just two
rotations.
Stanford was stunned. Though able to come
back and narrow the Husky lead, the first
game faltering never did leave the arena.
"The way we started the first game set the
tone for the evening," Shaw said. "If we would
have come out and played anywhere near
decently, we would have controlled the match,
but before we know it we were down 9-0."
It seemed that the Cardinal, like many of
the fans, had looked ahead to UCLA and
forgot about the Huskies. Suddenly, Washing
ton commanded more attention than the Car
dinal seemed able to muster.
"I think that could easily be said about our
team [after] the way we came out against
Washington, but we knew right away that
they were the team here now," Tracy Hughes
said. "Don said there was no future, and there
really wasn't. We got ourselves into a hole
right away, and all hopes of UCLA went right
out the window.
"We were playing a team that was playing
a really good match, and we were really flat.
Right away we were forced to think about
none other than Washington."

The Cardinal did just that in the next two
games, cruising to a two-games-to-one advan
tage and taking control of the match. With
just one more win, the effects of game one
would be erased.
The "under-'Dogs" refused to be van
quished, however, and after gaining a 2-1 lead
in the final game they never looked back.
"I really thought we had it in us," Wash
ington Coach Debbie Buse said. "I thought
we had played them close the last two times,
and I thought it needed to go five games for
us to win.
"We lost some composure in the second and
the third games, but in the third game we
started to inch our way back and regroup.
We just said, Take the fourth game, extend
it to five and the match is yours,' and they
really believed it and they went for it."
Card notes
Washington's winning ways were abruptly ended
the following evening in the regional final. True
to billing, UCLA emerged as the best team in the
West with a brisk three-game beating.
Though the Stanford loss was indeed a big upset,
it was not the largest of the tournament. In the
semifinal round of the Final Four, Texas over
whelmed UCLA in three games to advance to the
final match with Hawaii, last year's NCAA cham
pion.
The Bruins did get some consolation: It took the
NCAA champion to beat them. Texas upended the
Wahines to take the title, the first time a non-
Western team has done so.
The one bright spot of winter break for Stanford
came for Kristin Klein. Already deemed the Pacific
10 Conference Freshman of the Year and selected
to the All-Conference team, Klein became the only
freshman named first-team All-America this year.

Even the courageous play of Jennifer Chaffee, who led the Cardinal
in kills against Washington, was not enough to stave off an upset
in the NCAA West regionais.
LOS ANGELES — Even before play began
in the NCAA Tournament, most everyone in
tune with the women's volleyball world was
looking forward to the projected Stanford-
UCLA rematch in the West Regional final.
UCLA finished the regular season undefeated
and ranked No. 1 in the nation, and had given
the No. 2 Cardinal its only two losses.

Huskies 3, Cardinal 2

With a seventh straight NCAA Final Four
appearance on the line for Stanford and the
first for the regional-host Bruins in three
years, the stage seemed set for the showdown
to end all showdowns, a clash of the spiking
titans.
Unfortunately for Stanford and the opti
mistic onlookers, Washington refused to follow
the script.
Fueled by the explosive hitting of Laurie
Wetzel and the on-target setting of Mountain
View-native Melinda Beckenhauer, the
Huskies handed Stanford its first regional
semifinal loss in NCAA Tournament history
with a shocking 15-11, 3-15, 9-15, 15-9, 15-8
victory.
The Cardinal concluded its season with an
impressive 28-3 record, but the tally was small
consolation for the championship-minded
team. Just two hours and four minutes after
its regional hopes began, Washington had
turned the UCLA rematch into an impossible
dream with a crushing fifth game win.
"It's hard to really get a handle on what

happened," Stanford Coach Don Shaw said
after the decisive game. "After we won the
second and third games, we went flat.
"Whenever we played anywhere near well,
we were in control of the match. But for the
most part, we just played poorly. You don't
come this far and get away with playing poorly,
