## 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
Over winter break, Stanford's
men's basketball team opened
Pacific 10 Conference play by
going 3-1 and went 7-1 overall
despite facing four top-40 teams:
Oregon State, UCLA, St. Mary's
and Arizona. Stanford is now 10-3
overall as it hopes to ride its win
ter wave into this week's games
at Washington State (Thursday)
and Washington (Saturday).
Dec. 10: Stanford 89
San Jose State 39
Stanford scored the last 17
points of the game to record its
largest margin of victory since de
feating Seattle Pacific 105-54 in
the 1985-86 season. The victory
also marked the first time Stan
ford had held three straight op
ponents under 50 points since
1962-63. Todd Lichti led a bevy
of Cardinal scorers with 16, and
Adam Keefe had 11 rebounds. No
Spartan scored in double figures.
Dec. 17: Stanford 87
Oregon State 59
In the Pac-10 opener, Stanford
swamped the Beavers, posting its
biggest-ever victory over Oregon
State. It was Stanford's fifth
straight win, and Lichti led the
Cardinal in scoring for the seventh
straight game with 22 points. Eric
Reveno had 14 rebounds. Oregon
State's point guard extraordinaire
Gary Payton contributed 20
points and eight boards, but the
Beavers got little other help.
Dec. 23: UCLA 74
Stanford 70
With its best chance to win at
Pauley Pavilion perhaps this cen
tury, Stanford let go of a 55-49
lead in the second half after trail
ing by as much as 12 in the first
half. UCLA guard Pooh Richard
son played great defense in deny
ing Lichti the ball — the Stanford
senior was held to 18 points on
7-for-17 shooting — and also had
16 points and 10 assists himself.
Lichti did lead the Cardinal
with 10 rebounds, but Reveno led

in scoring with 20 points. Fresh
man sensation Don Mac Lean led
UCLA with 26 points and 12
rebounds. UCLA's win was
sandwiched by a 29-point trounc
ing at the hands of North Carolina
and a loss at UC-Irvine, which
was 2-7 at the time.
Dec. 27: Stanford 65
St. Mary's 64
After an Eric Reveno turnover
with 10 seconds remaining, St.
Mary's had two chances to win
this game, but St. Mary's A 1 Lewis
and Terry Burns each missed
shots to win it. It was the first
loss of the season for St. Mary's,
which led 38-34 at halftime.
Howard Wright had 24 points and
nine rebounds to lead the Cardi
nal. He also and made 12 of 13
free throws.
Dec. 29: Stanford 88
Furman 71
Lichti set a Stanford record by
shooting a perfect 12-for-12 from
the field in spearheading the Car
dinal to an opening-round win at
the Music City Invitational in
Nashville, Tenn. Ironically, Lichti
made only four of seven free
throws — in the next game he
would begin a consecutive free
throw streak that is now at 23.
Andrew Vlahov had a career-high
nine rebounds as Stanford led 47-
26 at halftime. David Brown
scored 32 for Furman.
Dec. 30: Stanford 89
Vanderbilt 68
Wright scored eight of his
season-high 28 points in a 20-2
Stanford run to open the second
half and rally Stanford to the v/in.
The Cardinal trailed 37-34 at
halftime. Lichti had 20 points, and
Terry Taylor had 10 assists.
Reveno (12 points, seven
rebounds) joined Lichti and
Wright on the all-tournament
team.
Thursday: Stanford 83
Arizona 78
Some more Stanford-Arizona
notes. . .. Stanford trailed for the
fifth time this season at halftime,

but rallied to win for the third
time. . . . Besides recording a
career-high 35 points, Lichti also
had his 100 th career game of
scoring in double figures — out
of 103 appearances overall. . . .
Stanford had a season-low six of
fensive rebounds — but there
were only 15 rebounds on Stan
ford's end of the court the entire
game.
Saturday: Stanford 94
Arizona State H5
Thursday night against Califor
nia, ASU lost junior playmaker
Tarence Wheeler to a season

ending knee injury, and that as
much as anything else told the
story as the Cardinal won with
ease against an overmatched Sun
Devil squad. Wright and Lichti
each had 19 points. In his last
four games, Lichti is shooting 74
percent (37-50). Perhaps the most
memorable play was when Wright
stuffed a driving Mitch Goldberg
about six-feet deep into the
Maples hardwood. It wasn't that
significant a play, but it summa
rized who was in control of the
game. Additionally, Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery notched
his 200 th career win on Saturday.
