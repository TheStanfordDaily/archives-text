# Women's hoops roundup

### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
For the Stanford women's
basketball team, winter break
was hardly a vacation.
While many of their class
mates spent the holiday loung
ing on a couch achieving intel
lectual fulfillment from the
gems of network television, the
Cardinal cagers faced some of
the toughest teams in the coun
try — including the toughest,
No. 1 Tennessee — en route to
solidifying Stanford's position
as the best team in the West.
Dec. 18: Tennessee 83
Stanford 60
Jennifer Azzi did not have
the happiest of homecomings.
Riding a five-game winning
streak, the Cardinal was halted
in its tracks by the top-ranked
Lady Volunteers and their star
Brigitte Gordon, who scored a
game-high 24 points.
"Tennessee is a team that
rebounds, is physical and is ex
tremely well coached," Stan
ford Coach Tara VanDerveer
said. "That's a challenge for us
to strive for, to get in a position
where we could beat Tennessee.
"We learned a lot from them,
things that we need to use
more. They liked our warm
ups. Clothes — that's the thing
they got from us," VanDerveer
jested.
The game marked the first
time in her years at Stanford
that Azzi has played in front
of her hometown crowd. Play
ing at one of the schools that
recruited her in high school,
the junior looked forward to
showcasing her talent but was
held to only eight points by the
tough Tennessee defense.
Forward Katy Steding,
though 3,000 miles from her
hometown of Lake Oswego,
Ore., did impress the 4,220
spectators with her 15-point
performance. Steding has since
become the team's leading

scorer.
Dec. 20: Stanford 91
Duke 76
Azzi's fortunes improved,
along with the team's, two days
later at Duke. Returning to
double figures, Azzi contrib
uted to a team-wide display of
both offense and defense.
The most notable perform
ance came from senior Evon
Asforis, who had languished
with an injured knee for
several of her Stanford years.
The Durham crowd did not
notice the effects of injuries,
however, as Asforis powered
her way to an 18-point, nine
rebound and four-assist exhibi
tion.
Dec. 21: N.C. State 80
Stanford 72
Stanford's Southeastern
tour ended on a distasteful note
after the Wolfpack Women
handed the Cardinal its only
upset loss of the season.
Steding led the Cardinal with
20 points and freshman Julie
Zeilstra grabbed a team-high
nine rebounds but could not
compensate for Andrea San
son's phenomenal 34 points.
Dec. 29-30: Stanford wins the
Cardinal Classic
Back on the Farm* fate was
simultaneously kind and cruel
to the Cardinal. Though Stan
ford celebrated the successful
defense of its Cardinal Classic
crown, the tournament also
saw the injury of starting point
guard Sonja Henning.
After logging just 12 minutes
in the opening-round game
with Connecticut, Henning suf
fered a knee injury that kept
her out of the rest of the tour
nament and restricted her play
in last weekend's USC game.
On a positive note, however,
her teammates went on to dom
inate the rest of the field. Stan
ford cruised past the Huskies
72-53 and outscored Houston
95-65 in the final.
