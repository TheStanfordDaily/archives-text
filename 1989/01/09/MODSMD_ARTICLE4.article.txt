# Campus bomb scare draws FBI
## 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
Stanford is still standing despite a
bomb threat that occurred on Dec. 23
while students were away on vacation.
At 12:27 a.m. an employee of the Re
search Animal Facility left the building
located at the Stanford Medical Center
and spotted a box wrapped in blue
Christmas paper and tied with a bow.
The package, about the size of a shoe
box, had a note attached that said, "To
Dr. Ham (sic) and associates: Have a
bomb this Christmas."
Thomas Hamm, who was out of town
at the time, is director of the Division
of Laboratory Animal Medicine in the
Research Animal Facility.
The facility has been the target of
animal rights activists and protests, but
no prior incidents of violence have oc

curred, according to the Palo Alto Times
Tribune.
Shortly after the package was discov
ered by the worker, the Associated Press
bureau in San Francisco received a call
from an anonymous man who claimed
to be a member of the Animal Liberation
Front.
According to the Times Tribune, the
caller said, "We (members of the Animal
Liberation Front) will not stop until dis
section stops."
The AP then called the San Francisco
branch of the Federal Bureau of Inves
tigations, according to special agent
Chuck Latting, a media representative
of the FBI. The AP told agents that the
unidentified man had said three bombs
had been planted on campus, one real
bomb and two fake.
After receiving the call, FBI
agents joined by the Stanford
Police Department, Medical Cen
ter security personnel, the San
Jose Police Department bomb
squad and units from the Palo
Alto Fire Department, searched
the animal facility and surround
ing area. However, no other sus
picious packages were found.
The discovered bomb was
detonated at 5:35 a.m. after bomb
squad members examined the
package using X-rays that
revealed wires and batteries in
side, the Times Tribune reported.
Latting said he was "surprised
to hear that they blew it up,"
adding that the device was "con
structed to look like a bomb but
could not have exploded" because
it was a fake.
