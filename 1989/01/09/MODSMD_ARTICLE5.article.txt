# Trustees approve phone system for dorms
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Senior staff writer 
Does your phone work yet? When are
you going to Kyoto? Sound familiar?
Now Stanford students will no longer
have to wait weeks for their phone lines
to be installed at the beginning of the
year. And even on the first day of classes
students will be able to call friends at
the Kyoto Overseas Center, which will
open next fall.
At their last meeting of fall quarter,
the Stanford Board of Trustees ap
proved an allocation of $5.2 million to
equip 5,000 student rooms with phone
service through the University's tele
phone network. Also at the meeting,
the trustees agreed to new financial
terms for the Stanford Center in Japan.
Access to the campuswide phone sys
tem is scheduled to be implemented in
remodeled Roble Hall in the fall of 1989
and other student residences by the fall

of 1990, according to Stephen Esselstyn,
assistant director of Communication
Services operations. The Northern
Telecom SLIOO system has served ad
ministrative, academic and hospital fa
cilities since 1986, and will continue to
do so.
Phone lines will already be installed
when students move into their rooms
and will be compatible with any phone,
Esselstyn said. However, Communica
tion Services has not yet decided how
or if phones will be distributed to stu
dents or if a room's phone number will
change from year to year, he added.
The new system will be made avail
able to students at a price comparable
or lower to current rates students pay.
Also, it is the first step towards expand
ing the access to other University data
networks, such as SUNet, according to
University News Service.
According to Director of Overseas
Studies Tom Heller, the new terms for

the Japan Center will include an exten
sion of Stanford's lease on the building
from 20 to 30 years and a $400,000
increase in a building fund deposit,
which will be returned to the University
at the end of the lease.
In addition, the rent on the center
will be raised from about $180,000 to
$201,600 with a 10 percent increase
every third year, Heller said. This rate
is "somewhat less than the rate at which
Japanese land values have been increas
ing," he added.
None of these increases will affect
student costs which will remain as they
always are for overseas centers, Heller
said.
The Kyoto center will house two ac
ademic programs — one exclusively for
Stanford students and the other open
to students from other American uni
versities as well.
Construction will begin on the center
in January.
