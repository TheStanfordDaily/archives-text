# Proposed feminist studies focus house well received by Res Ed
## 
### Maryellen Driscoll 
A student proposal for the crea
tion of a feminist studies focus
house has received strong initial
support from Residential Educa
tion.
The early enthusiasm for the
focus house indicates that it will
likely be approved. Both
Slavianskii Dom, the Slavic
Studies house, and Lathrop
House, the American Indian
house, also received strong sup
port when they were proposed
three years ago.
Alice Supton, associate dean of
Residential Education, said the
idea of the focus house is "very
exciting," because Res Ed is
looking for theme house ideas
with "strong academic programs."
The Feminist Studies Program
has grown rapidly since it was
established, and provides 46
classes through the program and
35 through other departments
this year.
In addition to Res Ed's support,
both the faculty and the admin
istration have "been really excited
in the initial stages," said junior
Teri Hopper, co-coordinator of the
focus house proposal. "A
residence-based entity that is fo
cused on women's concerns is a
good way to bring the adminis

tration, faculty and students to
gether," she said.
The group drawing up the pro
posal hopes to submit it by the
end of this quarter, and a Res Ed
committee is scheduled to decide
on the proposal by early February.
If it accepts the proposal, a
feminist studies focus house will
be included as an option for Uni
versity housing as early as next
year.
A feminist studies focus house
will serve to raise greater atten
tion to gender issues through
forums, programs and courses in
volving Feminist Studies faculty,
according to Hopper, a history
mtyor.
Hopper said that a "broad
recruiting effort" would be made
in order to attract students, both
male and female. "Men will
definitely be encouraged to list
the theme house on their Draw
card," she said.
According to Supton, any pro
posal for a theme house must "ap
peal to a variety of students."
Feminist studies fits that crite
rion because it is "such an exciting
area right now," she added.
Within the past few years stu
dent interest in the University's
Feminist Studies Program has
dramatically increased. For exam
ple, in the fall of 1984 the
introductory course to feminist
studies consisted of six students.
This fall there are 49 students
enrolled in the course.
Estelle Freedman, professor for
the feminist studies introductory
course, said that the feminist
studies focus house would "sup
plement academic course work."
According to Supton, a feminist
studies focus house would be "pre
paring the ground" for a theme
house. Depending on the success
of the focus house, a feminist
studies theme house would pos
sibly come into effect for the 1990-
1991 academic year.
A focus house supports an eth
nic or academic theme, such as

Adams House, which focuses on
human biology. The American In
dian theme house and the Slavic
Studies House, however, are con
sidered theme houses, which are
organized around a theme.
Res Ed would choose the focus
house's location, which would de
termine whether the house would
include a resident fellow. Candi
date residences have not yet been
selected.
Hopper and Sarah Bryer, co
coordinators of the proposal and
active participants in the Women's
Center, said that they have
noticed an upsurge of awareness
concerning feminist issues on
campus that has kept the Wom
en's Center particularly active.
Bryer, a co-term student in an
thropology, said, "The idea of the
focus house is a result of a real
renewal of energy at the Women's
Center."
