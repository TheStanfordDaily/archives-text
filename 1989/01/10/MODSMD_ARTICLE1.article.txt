# Drought not yet dead

For students returning to
campus from sunnier climes, the
Bay Area's current bout with
inclement weather may seem to
be the answer to drought-stricken
California's prayers. For officials
at the Santa Clara Valley Water
District and Stanford, however,
the recent precipitation is but a
drop in the bone-dry bucket of
emptying local reservoirs.
Cloud cover and periodic
drizzles have become the
mainstay of Stanford's winter
climate. So far this season, the
Palo Alto area has been showered
with about 4.5 inches of rain,
right on line with last year's early
season tally of 4.56 inches.
Although the total is promising,
it is far from the solution to Cal
ifornia's water woes.
"We are not out of the drought,"
Teddy Morse, a Santa Clara Valley
Water District press representa
tive, said. "The problem is that
the reservoirs in the county, which
supply half of our water, are bas
ically still empty."
Rainfall helps replenish the
water used during the dry sum
mer months, but run-ofT provides
the bulk of reservoir water. As a
result, the water stored in the
mountain snowpacks is seen by
experts as the single most impor
tant source. Unlike rain, whose
impact is easily measured in
inches, the rewards to be reaped
from run-off cannot be deter
mined until the springtime thaw.
"We seem to be doing well, but
we won't really know until April
Ist," Morse said. At that point,
the winter snowpack will be tested
by state water officials to deter
mine its water content, enabling
water districts to predict how
much water they will get from
run-ofT.
"Last year it looked like the
snowpack was good, but in Jan
uary and February the snow
didn't come," Morse said. Com
pounding the problem, some of
the water in the early winter
snows had evaporated by spring.
Until then, Stanford will con
tinue to adhere to the water con
servation standards set by the
water district. "Basically, we're
just doing what we have been
doing," Stanford Operations and
Maintenance Manager Cheryl
Jensen said.
However, one signifigant
change has been implemented by
Jensen in the area of well water
use. Although Stanford relied on
underground wells for drinking
water during the summer to com
pensate for the decreased supply

of water from the Hetchy Hetchy
Reservoir, community conserva
tion allowed Jensen to phase out
the use of well water.
"We've turned the well off, so
now students are getting good
water again," Jensen said. Over
the summer, campus residents
complained that the well water
had a particularly unpleasant
flavor. Now, with other sources
providing Stanford's drinking
water, the problem has been
abated.
Jensen said effective conserva
tion permitted the change in
water sources. "We're under the
same restrictmns (from the water
district), but we've been getting
pretty good conservation. With
the rain, we're not doing as much
irrigation.
"We hope it keeps raining," Jen
sen added.
