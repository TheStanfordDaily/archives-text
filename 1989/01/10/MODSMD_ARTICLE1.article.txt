# Drought not yet dead

For students returning to
campus from sunnier climes, the
Bay Area's current bout with
inclement weather may seem to
be the answer to drought-stricken
California's prayers. For officials
at the Santa Clara Valley Water
District and Stanford, however,
the recent precipitation is but a
drop in the bone-dry bucket of
emptying local reservoirs.
Cloud cover and periodic
drizzles have become the
mainstay of Stanford's winter
climate. So far this season, the
Palo Alto area has been showered
with about 4.5 inches of rain,
right on line with last year's early
season tally of 4.56 inches.
Although the total is promising,
it is far from the solution to Cal
ifornia's water woes.
"We are not out of the drought,"
Teddy Morse, a Santa Clara Valley
Water District press representa
tive, said. "The problem is that
the reservoirs in the county, which
supply half of our water, are bas
ically still empty."
Rainfall helps replenish the
water used during the dry sum
mer months, but run-ofT provides
the bulk of reservoir water. As a
result, the water stored in the
mountain snowpacks is seen by
experts as the single most impor
tant source. Unlike rain, whose
impact is easily measured in
inches, the rewards to be reaped
from run-off cannot be deter
mined until the springtime thaw.
"We seem to be doing well, but
we won't really know until April
Ist," Morse said. At that point,
the winter snowpack will be tested
by state water officials to deter
mine its water content, enabling
water districts to predict how
much water they will get from
run-ofT.
"Last year it looked like the
