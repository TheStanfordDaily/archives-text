In the equivalent of the nation's
academic superbowl, four Stan
ford seniors came up winners this
December. John Crandon, Michael
McCullough and Victoria
Donaldson were named 1989
Rhodes scholars and Barney Pell
was awarded a Marshall scholar
ship.
The presitigious Rhodes schol
arship allows 32 students selected
nationwide to study for two to
three years at Oxford University
in England. Seventy students
worldwide are awarded Rhodes
Scholarships which provides
room, board, tuition, transporta
tion and a travel allowance. Last
year, Stanford had two Rhodes
scholars and three Marshall schol
ars.

Specifically for U.S. students,
the Marshall Scholarship is
awarded to 30 students nation
wide.
The three recipients of the
Rhodes scholarships all expressed
surpise and excitement at receiv
ing the honor.
"I really wanted to be able to
continue my studies next year and
didn't think I would be able to
afford it," Crandon said. "I ap
plied [for the Rhodes] in addition
to other grants."
Crandon, majoring in biology
and political science, will pursue
a master's degree in social re
search and policy at Oxford. "The
idea for a career in public health
came about after interning in
Washington two summers," Cran
don explained.
"Working for Surgeon General

C. Everett Koop, I was influenced
by his no nonsense, factual ap
proach to public health," Crandon
said. He added that Verity Powell,
in the Undergraduate Advising
Center, and his mother influenced
his academic goals.
McCullough, a human biology
and political science major, said
he will study politics, philosophy
and economics at Oxford.
He said he applied for the
Rhodes last fall while looking for
a way to finance medical school,
which he plans to attend after his
stay at Oxford.
At Stanford, he worked with
the Stanford Medical Youth Sci
ence Program, which he and a
friend founded three years ago.
The program, sponsored by Stan
ford University Hospital, brings
underprivileged California high

school juniors and seniors to Stan
ford for five weeks in the summer,
McCullough explained.
He said he hopes the program
will continue and is now looking
for interested students to head the
project after he graduates.
He credits Marilyn Winkleby,
the academic adviser for the youth
science program, SLAC physicist
Helen Quinn and his Western Cul
ture teaching assistant Kenneth
Wolfe for their help in attaining
the scholarship.
In addition, Profs. James
March, organizational behavior;
John Brauman, chemistry; James
Lawry, human biology; Jack
McMahan, neurobiology "helped
each in their own way, " McCul
lough said. "Without them 1
