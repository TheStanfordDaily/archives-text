### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - In a valedictory
speech, Secretary of State George Shultz
last night condemned leaks and lies in gov
ernment and"the old American inclination
to withdraw from the world."
Apart from the criticism, Shultz said he
was leaving his post after more than six
years convinced that "ours is a winning
hand."
Shultz said the United States was ap
proaching a new era in international affairs
in a world that had undergone significant
changes:
• Fear of nuclear war was greatly
diminished.
• A new U.S.-Soviet relationship
promised to reduce tensions.

• A new global economy
based on information and
openness was replacing old
divisions based on national
borders and ancient
rivalries.
• Human rights, the
rule of law and the practice
of democracy were taking
root and spreading.
Shultz, who first came

to Washington more than 30 years ago,
said he would go home to California next
week convinced that the United States "is
lighting the way for the hopes and aspira
tions of countless millions around the
world."
