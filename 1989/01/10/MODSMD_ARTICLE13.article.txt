## Court to review abortion law Justice Department wants case used to reverse Roe v. Wade 
### 
ST. LOUIS (AP) — State pro-choice
advocates said they were concerned
about the U.S. Supreme Court's deci
sion yesterday to review a Missouri law
regulating abortions, but also said it
might fire up their movement.
"We are hopeful that the Supreme
Court will realize the importance of
having the option of abortion," said B.J.
Isaacson-Jones, executive director of
Reproductive Health Services, an abor
tion clinic named in the state's appeal
to the Supreme Court.
She said she also saw the decision as
"an opportunity for pro-choice people
to keep the issue of choice in front of
America."
Leaders from the movement to halt
abortions were elated by the justices'
decision to study a lower-court ruling
that struck down key provisions of the
Missouri law.
Justice Department lawyers want the
high court to use the Missouri case as

a means of undoing its landmark 1973
Roe vs. Wade ruling, which legalized
abortion.
There was nothing in yesterday's
brief order that indicated the Supreme
Court would reconsider its ruling of 16
years ago.
"We hoped all along that we could
get the case up to the Supreme Court
and have the court look at some very
important issues," said Sam Lee, legisla
tive director for Missouri Citizens For
Life. "And we think with some changes
in the court in the past couple years
there's a good chance that Roe vs. Wade
may be partially or even completely
overturned."
Erika Fox, director of public affairs
for Planned Parenthood of Greater
Kansas City, said the decision would
provide a chance to emphasize "the dire
consequences on the life and health of
women and their families if the clock

is turned back to the time American
women were mutilated and even died
as a result of botched abortions."
Isaacson-Jones added, "People as
sumed that reproductive freedom is
protected by the Constitution. We know
that may not be the case. It is time for
us to reorganize, regroup, be more vocal,
be more visible."
In July, the Bth U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals, which is based in St. Louis,
struck down several provisions of Mis
souri's abortion law, including:
• —a ban on using public hospitals
or other government-run facilities for
abortions not necessary to save a wom
an's life;
• —a ban prohibiting any public em
ployee from performing or assisting an
abortion;
• —and a ban on using taxpayer
money for "encouraging or counseling"
women to have abortions.
