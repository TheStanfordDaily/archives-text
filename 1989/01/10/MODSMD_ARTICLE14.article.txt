# Judge won't drop North charges yet

WASHINGTON (AP) - The judge in
the Iran-Contra case directed Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh yesyerday to
certify that national security concerns
would prevent a fair public trial of the
key charges against former White House
aide Oliver North.
U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell
said he would not grant independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh's motion to dis
miss conspiracy and theft charges until
the attorney general made clear in an
affidavit that the decision against al
lowing certain classified information to
be released during any trial was made
by high Reagan administration officials.
"I have a question in my mind as to
whether or not this is a motion that
can only be made by the attorney gen
eral," Gesell said at a hearing.
Walsh, who met with Thornburgh last
Wednesday and told him he was going
to seek dismissal of the two central
charges, said, "I am quite sure I could

get an affidavit" from the attorney gen
eral. Gesell said he hopes to receive it
by Thursday.
Justice Department spokesman Loye
Miller declined to comment on whether
the attorney general would provide an
affidavit, but a department source,
speaking on condition of anonymity,
said he assumed the attorney general
probably will submit one.
Meanwhile, Walsh disclosed he plans
to call former U.S. Rep. Michael Barnes,
D-Md., and beer magnate Joseph Coors
to testify against North. Their names
were on a revised list of prosecution
witnesses, which have been reduced in
number from 87 to 40 because of the
plans to dismiss the conspiracy and
theft charges. Coors and Barnes weren't
on the original list.
Coors, after meeting with North in
June 1985, provided a $65,000 donation
to supply the Contras with a Maule
aircraft and two months later Barnes

inquired about North's activities on be
half of the Contras. Barnes received a
response denying that the National Se
curity Council staff had provided fund
raising or military support to the Con
tras.
North prepared the response, accord
ing to two counts in the indictment of
the former National Security Council
aide charging him with obstruction of
congress and making false statements.
Barnes at the time was chairman of the
House subcommittee on western hemi
sphere affairs.
Also among the new names on the
prosecution's witness list is William
Langton, president of Southern Air
Transport, a former CIA proprietary
that was involved in both supplying the
Contras and in the administration's se
cret arms sales to Iran.
Walsh disclosed at the hearing that
he acted to dismiss the two counts last
Thursday.
