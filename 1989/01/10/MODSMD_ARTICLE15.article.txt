# Judge blocks immigration policy

BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) â€” A judge yesterday
blocked a new government immigration policy
blamed for forcing hundreds of homeless Central
Americans in south Texas to live in primitive camps
and condemned buildings.
U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela's temporary
restraining order restores a previous Immigration
and Naturalization Service policy that allows asylum
seekers in south Texas to travel to other U.S. des
tinations after checking in with the INS.
Hundreds of the asylum-seekers have camped out
in Cameron County, Texas' southernmost county,
since the INS adopted a policy Dec. 16 that all but
prevented them from leaving the area while their
applications for political asylum were processed.
"One would have to be blind not to recognize
that we have a problem," Vela said, in putting the
INS policy on hold.
The temporary restraining order was sought in
a lawsuit filed against the INS on Friday by refugee

advocates.
"Everybody is euphoric about the good news,"
said Vidal Sanchez, 38, of Nicaragua, who has lived
for more than two weeks in a primitive camp near
Brownsville with more than 300 other Central Amer
icans awaiting appointments with the INS.
Sanchez said he planned to leave for Miami by
tomorrow.
He and other campers, many staying under tents
fashioned from tree limbs and discarded sheets of
plastic, were told Sunday they would have to vacate
the land after the property owner posted "No
Trespassing" signs.
The campsite's population continued to drop yes
terday as the immigrants complied with a sheriffs
order to leave or face trespassing charges. The aliens
have been offered shelter in several nearby churches.
By late yesterday, only about 50 Central Americans
were living in the camp, and many said they did
not plan to spend the night.
