Civil rights murders re-examined
JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — The case that sparked
the movie "Mississippi Burning" involving the
1964 slayings of three civil rights workers could
be reopened, but the district attorney does not
plan to give it special attention.
"There's no statute of limitations on murder,
so it could be prosecuted," said Neshoba County
District Attorney Ken Turner.
But Turner said he was not aware of any new
evidence, and indicated he had no special interest
in prosecuting the case.
"I'm interested in prosecuting any murder case.
I wouldn't single this case out," Turner said.
"We can't prosecute on emotion."
The slayings of Andrew Goodman, James
Chaney and Michael Schwerner on June 21, 1964,
have received renewed attention as a result of

publicity surrounding the release of "Mississippi
Burning," which uses the deaths near Philadel
phia as the basis for a fictitious story.
U.S. won't negotiate with Khadafy
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Reagan's
press representative said yesterday the adminis
tration has no interest in negotiating with Libya's
Moammar Khadafy over a plant the United States
says will be used to produce chemical weapons.
Asked to comment on Khadafy's offer to discuss
the disputed facility directly with U.S. govern
ment officials, presidential press representative
Marlin Fitzwater said, "We don't have a problem
with communications with Khadafy."
Rather, Fitzwater told reporters, "We have a
problem with his actions. So we feel there is no
need for direct discussions."
