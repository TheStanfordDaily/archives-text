## Just buy a bike light 
### 
Citations are up, but
many campus cyclists
are still in the dark

IT WAS a head-on collision just
after dusk, says Stanford Police
Sergeant Del Bandy. Two
cyclists smashed into one another
at full-force. One knocked out his
front teeth and split his lip to the
jaw.
Bandy, who was out on patrol
that afternoon, says the accident
off Sand Hill Road never should
have happened. There were no
cars, no obstacles; the bikers were
right out in the open. Unfortunate
ly, neither cyclist had a bike light.
During fall quarter, the number
of bike citations issued by the Stan
ford Police Department skyrock
eted. Police officers issued 310 cita
tions over the quarter — about a
sevenfold increase over the 42
issued last year.
Despite the police crackdown,
Stanford cyclists continue to whiz
around campus corners during the
late night hours without bike
lights.
According to Police Chief Marvin
Herrington, campus police have re
ceived numerous complaints from
motorists who say they cannot see
the night bicyclists and, moreover,
that the bikers ride through stop
signs. Motorists are frightened and
angered, he says, about the possi
bility of injuring these riders.
In addition, last quarter The

Daily received several letters from
concerned community members,
asking Stanford's bikers to buy
lights.

Now that daylight hours are
short and it's often cloudy and
stormy outside, buying a bike light
makes a lot of sense.
Besides, riders who fail to have
a bike light are violating California
state law. The offense is a violation
of California vehicle Code
21201(d), a list of equipment re
quirements which states that
bicycles must have at night, a light
visible from 300 feet in the front
and from the sides, as well as front
and rear reflectors.
Considering the legal and safety
implications of not having a bike
light, going out and buying one
should top the errands list.
Investing in a bike light only
costs $5 to $10, while bicycle light
citations may include a $20 fine.
In addition, police officials are
encouraging Stanford cyclists to
register their bicycles. If a bicycle
is stolen, there's a much better
chance of it being returned to the
owner if it's registered.
To register your bike, head over
to the Tresidder Recreational Cen
ter behind th£ Coffee House to get
a form. Although the registration
fee is $3.50, you'll still come out
ahead — they'll give you a $5
coupon for a Campus Bike Shop
bike light as well as a reflector kit.
The Stanford campus is a biker's
paradise. But it's time to play it
safe, lights are cheap and easy-to
purchase. Besides, having one at
night is the law.
