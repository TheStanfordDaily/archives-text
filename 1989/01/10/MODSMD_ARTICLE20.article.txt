# Where logic always fails

"I think that if I heard a voice from the
sky predicting all that was going to hap
pen to me during the next 24 hours, . . .
and if all these events then proceeded to
happen, I might perhaps be convinced at
least of the existence of some superhuman
intelligence."
— Bertrand Russell
Throughout the ages, many deep think
ers of Western culture went in search of
the ultimate proof — to prove God's ex
istence.
Augustine had his "there is no evil"
argument, Aquinas had his "five proofs
on the existence of God", and Kant had
his moral argument.
For every logical argument for, how
ever, there was an equally convincing
argument against. This observation has
prompted one prominent theologian, the
Reverend Michael J. Buckley, S. J., to
query, "Why are we arguing philosophy
about what in our life is
religious?"
Buckley's main point is that attempting
to prove or disprove God's existence from
a cold, rational point of view, devoid of
religious experience, is inherently mis
leading.
To dissect and talk about God as if
God were an object is as misleading as
to dissect and talk about a poem as if a
poem was just a grammatical construc
tion of words.
In much the same way, one ought to
believe in a supreme deity not because
of some logical argument, but because of
emotion and religious experience.
In a culture that highly values logic

and reason, and rightly so, it is often
difficult to argue for the validity of emo
tion and religious experience.
Although it may be foolish to build a
philosophy on emotion and religious ex
perience alone, it is just as misleading to
build a philosophy devoid of emotion and
religious experience.
But just what does one mean by emo
tion and religious experience?
Words can do no justice to what I'm
about to describe. It's a feeling of
transcendent force, a feeling of quiet
peace, a feeling of deep tranquility, a
feeling of overwelming joy, all wrapped
into one.
I admit, on paper this sounds pretty
absurd. I just wish I could go to people,
touch them and ZAP!, they would feel
what I have felt.
• The point I'm trying to make is not
that one should rely on some mystical
experience to build their life upon. I'm
arguing for a much less radical position
— that it is a mistake to exclude religious
experience because it somehow doesn't
fit into the logical, rational realm.
I think it's important to point out that,
even given the historical exclusion of re
ligious experience, the most that any deep
thinker has been able to claim is agnos
ticism.
Even David Hume, in his "Dialogues
Concerning Natural Religion," which con
tained a scathing critique of religious
views, seemed to admit at the end of his
book that he found Cleanthes, who was
a religious believer in his book, to have
principles that "approached still nearer
to the truth."

In fact, many deep thinkers who have
criticized religion don't seem to criticize
religion per se, but rather, organized re
ligion.
Given some of the more incredible feats
of cruelty that organized religions have
led and prompted in the past, it is no
surprise that Bertrand Russell wrote, "I
say quite deliberately that the Christian
religion, as organized in its churches, has
been and still is the principal enemy of
moral progress in the world."
Although I disagree with Russell, and
much has changed since his time, notice
that he qualified his criticism with "as
organized in its churches."
The upshot of all of this is that one
should not be trapped into confusing or
ganized religion with religion, trapped
into talking about God as if God were
an object, trapped into looking for a logi
cal proof where there can be none and
trapped into denying the validity of reli
gious experience.
And once one sees beyond the appear
ances and traps set by our good
intentioned minds, the quest for a logical
proof for the existence of God loses mean
ing.
