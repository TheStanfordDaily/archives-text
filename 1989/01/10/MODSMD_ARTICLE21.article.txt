## Students should push for action against apartheid 
### 
SEVERAL MYTHS have been
generated over the past few years
about the purposes and effective
ness of sanctions (of which divestment
is one form) to the extent that debate
on these issues has become sterile and
unpersuasive.
The most pervasive of these myths is
that sanctions cannot bring an end to
apartheid. Actually, that's true; but
then again no serious proponent of
sanctions has suggested the causal
counter-claim.
Rather, the argument made is that
sanctions are an important nonviolent
strategy whose effects, combined with
the total set of alternative sanctions
(the cultural and sports boycott, politi
cal isolation, etc.) has unquestionably
pushed the government to "reform"
and consider negotiations, however
limited at this stage.
That the absence of sanctions breeds

regime complacency is equally unques
tionable.
Why suddenly the rush of Afrikaners
making and being allowed to make
their pilgrimage to the African Na
tional Congress (the mcgor black libera
tion organization in exile)?
Why, if sanctions are so ineffective,
does the regime count it as "treason"
to advocate sanctions?
Why spend millions of dollars per
year in the United States attempting
to block the further imposition of
sanctions?
Why the sudden media-invasion by
South African politicians to convince
the West of its intent to reform?
Why would the otherwise obstinate
P.W. Botha himself concede that
changing certain apartheid laws was
necessary because of "outside pres
sure"?
The conclusion is simple: Sanctions

work. No sanctions ensures no change.
Stanford University and other lead
ing institutions in the world could play
a central role in facilitating social and
political change in South Africa.
Unfortunately the Stanford Board of
Trustees has continued to observe
selective divestment with criteria that
even after the turn of the century will
have only insignificant effects.
In a memo dated Jan. 29, 1988, the
Committee on Investment Responsibil
ity recommended total divestment from
all U.S. companies operating in South
Africa.
We call on Stanford to respond
immediately to the CIR proposals to
the Trustees recommending that Stan
ford encourage other international
companies to withdraw; support
broader international sanctions; call or
the present administration to reform
ulate its entire Southern Africa policy;

and provide educational support to
anti-apartheid organizations in South
ern Africa.
As of Nov. 29, 1988, Stanford has a
total of $114,342,700 invested in 85
companies doing business in South
Africa. This amount divides into ap
proximately $75 million invested in
U.S.-based companies operating there.
Your money should not be invested
in companies that profit from apart
heid. Write to University President
Donald Kennedy and express your
views on this matter.
