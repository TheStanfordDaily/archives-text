# University does not release HIV testing records
## 
### 
The Dec. 2 Daily article on the Uni
versity AIDS policy contained a state
ment by Daniel Stembergh which has
raised some alarm and requires
clarification.
According to the article, Stembergh
stated that "students might not realize
that their (HIV) testing records at
Cowell could be released."
The Cowell Student Health Center
policy is as follows:
• No medical records of any kind may
be released to anyone without written
permission from the student.
• Neither the information that the

student has had an HIV test nor the
test results have been included in the
medical record.
Up until June of 1988, the HIV
results were filed separately; routine
release of medical records would not
include any HIV information.
By California state law, HIV infor
mation could only be released by writ
ten permission from the student spe
cific for that information.
• Since June of 1988, no records of
HIV testing have been retained at
Cowell at all.
When the student returns for test
results, the results and the consent
form are given to the student.
No one knows of the testing and
results except the student and the doc
tor; even the laboratory request carries
only a code name.
Thus the testing is not truly anony
mous, but it is truly confidential, and

there are no testing records to be re
leased.
• Truly anonymous testing is recom
mended as preferable by the American
College Health Association. Such is
available in the community from the
San Mateo and Santa Clara County
Health Departments, as well as from
the Red Cross in Palo Alto.
In addition, with the changes in
policy in June of 1988, any student
who was tested prior to that date who
wishes to obtain the testing records
currently filed at Cowell may do so by
contacting either John Dorman, associ
ate director of Cowell Student Health
Center, or the physician who ordered
the test.
