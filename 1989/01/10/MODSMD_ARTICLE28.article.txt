## Airplane design, Part One: Getting down on upholstery 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
It's that special time of year
here at Stanford. The rains have
come, the winter air is crisp and
clean, and children flock from
miles 'round to dig deep into the
now soft mud of Lakebed Lagu
nita, searching for rusty beer
cans, broken glass and other relics
of Stanford's storied past.
It's a special time as friends

reunite and don their skates to
enjoy Riunite on ice and chatter
away about their holiday vacation.
Many a poignant story is told
— sweet memories of the last
weeks of 1988 abound. There are
stories of sittin' 'round the old
Steinway singing carols and of
baking Christmas cookies, the
warm scent wafting through the
house all the way up to the Owens-
Corning fiberglass insulation
which lines the attic floor.
There are stories of new-fallen
snow and of Grandma trying to
walk down the icy front steps
without falling and breaking her
hip. Best of all are the stories of
returning unwanted gifts for cash,
and of drunken New Year's Eve
slobbering with a high school
sweetheart.
And here, now, the first Bug
Me of 1989, which, incidentally,
is the Year of the Bug on the
Chinese calendar. For those of you
returning from overseas, the Bug
issues a warm welcome back to
the greatest country on the face
of the earth and these words of
introduction in case you are not
yet familiar with The Daily's most
popular Tuesday question-and
answer column.
The essence of Bug Me is the
perfect admixture of fact with
fatuity. If, at times, it is difficult
to discern what is true and what
is false in any one column, this

is only because Bug Me is invar
iably a poorly written morass of
convoluted obfuscation.
All questions have been received
from members of the Stanford
community. I personally guaran
tee that the Bug will at least
glance at any query you might
have about any subject if you send
it via the Lots letter service to
B.bug-me or drop it off in the
Bug Me box outside the Stanford
Daily offices.
Dear Bug,
What's with the upholstery on
airplane seats ?
— Estee Lauder
Thanks to the absurdity of air
travel ticket pricing, the Bug had
11 hours of flight time to inves
tigate this and a couple other
aeronautical mysteries on Satur
day.
Traveling from Boston to Salt
Lake City, then to San Diego, and,
finally, to San Francisco, in order
to avoid more expensive direct
flights, the Bug spent the time
enjoying the atmosphere of
airplanes: watching his neighbor's
elbow scatter his delicious scoop
of scrambled egg into the aisle,
studying the age spots on the
scalp of the man in front of him
who was kind enough to lean his
seat back as far as it would go,
and interviewing a stewardess
concerning your important ques
tion, among others.

The Bug also spent time
deliberating on the following
problem: A sign for the front sec
tion of the plane says, "No
Smoking, No Fumar," while the
sign for the back rows says,
"Smoking, Fumar." Now, what
the hell is fumaring and why is
there not a section for those who
wish to smoke but not fumar or
versa vice?
Anyway, I did get to talk with
Linda, a 13-year veteran of the
friendly skies about four vital is
sues in this period of air-travel
crisis.
The Bug first asked about the
upholstery, which on this Boeing
727 was patterned with swirling
bright greens, glowing blues and
sort of off-white yellow-green
beiges.
Describing the seat covers as
"scary," Linda said the psyche
delic fabrics originated in the
19705, in keeping with the fash
ions of the times. Unfortunately,
the designers did not follow fash
ion so far as to make the seat
covers out of sheer polyester.
According to Linda, Delta is
presently taking steps to redesign
the most unappetizing of the up
holstery. With this news in mind,
the Bug advises that readers capi
talize on the next chance they get
to steal a couple of those Velcroed
headrest flaps because it may be
their last chance.

Next, the Bug asked why the
silverware is always so cold. The
fascinating reason is that the sil
verware is stored — along with
food to be served cold, such as
salad, cake and cadaver — in dry
ice.
I then asked Linda about the
safety procedure presentation
which the attendants must per
form before each take-off. She
said this is taken very seriously
by the flight staff because there
are frequently passengers who are
not familiar with the operation of
the safety equipment. She said it
is most important that everyone
know how to unbuckle their seat
belt.
Although Linda actually did say
that is the reason the presenta
tions are taken seriously, the Bug
suspects that stewardesses and
stewards demonstrate the proce
dure in earnest because they
know what a valuable asset a solid
safety procedure performance can
be in building an acting career.

Although summer stock, drama
school and off-Broadway experi
ence are important, an actor or
actress who can effectively dem
onstrate how to buckle, adjust and
unbuckle a seat belt has unpar
alleled potential to make it in the
cut-throat world of stage and
screen.
Turning then to peanuts, the
Bug asked his final question: "Is
there any limit to the number of
little bags o' nuts you can give
out?" Linda said tnere was no
limit, and there are always many
snack packs left at the end of each
flight.
Once again, the Bug's
suspicions were aroused. What if
it was possible to open one of
those peanut packages in less than
15 minutes without the aid of a
fully-stocked Black and Decker
Workbench? Would the flight at
tendants still be allowed to give
out as many bags as were desired?
Until next week, the Bug has
spoken.
