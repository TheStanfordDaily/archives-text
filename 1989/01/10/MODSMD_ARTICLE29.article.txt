## Confidence is key for Cardinal freshman Keefe 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
At the start of the current bas
ketball season, a newcomer to the
Stanford men's hoops squad had
Cardinal fans wondering, "Who is
that masked man?" But these
days, as the team achieves na
tional recognition, there are few
who don't know exactly who star
freshman Adam Keefe is.
Keefe, the big redhead who
wore a protective face mask early
in the season to protect a broken
nose, has logged considerable
playing time as a true freshman
and has figured prominently in
the Cardinal's success so far this
year. Often the first man off Stan
ford Coach Mike Montgomery's
bench, Keefe has displayed the
confidence and skill of a much
more experienced player.
"He really doesn't play like a
freshman," fellow big man Derek
Bruton said, summing up Keefe's
ability.
Senior point guard Terry Taylor
concurred: "He's quite mature for
a freshman. He's also really
strong, which is unusual for a
frosh."
This strength combined with
Keefe's 6-9, 230-pound frame al
lows him to be a force inside for
the Cardinal. While the forward's
offensive and defensive skills are
improving with time, his imme
diate impact has been in rebound
ing. Through the first 12 games,
including when he played with the
injury, Keefe averaged nearly six
rebounds a game as a backup.
"I think rebounding is probably
the thing he does best right now
— rebounding in traffic, getting
to the ball with lots of people
around," Montgomery said. "He's
a good one-step rebounder, par
tially due to his volleyball (in high
school)."
A bona fide blue-chip recruit
out of Woodbridge High School in
Irvine, California, Keefe was a
star in both hoops and volleyball.
Wooed by the creme-de-la-creme
programs of college basketball,
Keefe finally chose Stanford over
Duke and North Carolina. Keefe
chose Cardinal over blue because,
as he put it, "Stanford maybe isn't
at the same level of basketball as

the others, but they didn't have
the academics of Stanford. I saw
it as the best combination."
• Keefe came to the Farm off a
fantastic senior year, in which he
averaged 27 points and 13
rebounds a game and was named
to four All-America teams. He has
shown why in his first few months
of play.
"A lot of that recruiting and
'highly-touted' stuff goes down
the drain in your freshman year,"
teammate Brian McSweeny said.
"But Adam has come in and
proven himself, and proven that
he does belong at this level."
"You can see why he was so
highly-recruited," Montgomery
stated. "He's remarkably confi
dent for a kid that's a freshman."
The amazing thing is that this
confidence Keefe exudes and plays
with, typified by his aggressive
play under the basket, has not
been diminished by the injury.
Keefe sustained a broken nose No
vember 4th in practice when he
caught an elbow in the face. He
sat out one exhibition game, and
wore a bizarre mask over his en
tire face for another exhibition
and Stanford's first two regular
season contests (at Montana and
Indiana).
The freshman was frank in his
comments about playing with the
mask. "It was terrible. My vision
was very limited with it, and it
made playing real difficult."
Keefe wasted no time in
showing what he could do without
the handicap. Against North
Carolina in the Cardinal's third
game of the season, Keefe was
perfect from the field and the free
throw line, scoring seven points
and pulling down three rebounds.
He followed that performance
with a pair of excellent games in
the Apple Invitational. He came
away with 17 points, 10 rebounds
and a spot on the all-tournament
team.
"Psychologically, it set him back
a little bit because he's, I'm sure,
a little less willing to stick his
nose in traffic," Montgomery said
of the injury. "He also missed
some time conditioning-wise."
But Keefe has shown no signs
of letting up on the physical play.

"I'm looking at it that it is going
to break again," he said. "I'm just
going to see how long it goes until
it gets broken."
It is this type of attitude that
allowed Montgomery to forego the
usual redshirt year for the
talented Keefe. "Adam is good
enough to contribute now, and
(his getting experience) will help
us next year," Montgomery said.
Up to this point, the decision
has proved a wise one. Keefe has
averaged almost eight points a
game to go with his six rebounds
off the bench. His 10 points in 18
njinutes along with his play inside
revitalized the slow-starting Car
dinal in.the team's upset of Ari
zona. He seems to improve each
game as well.
Of course, Keefe is getting ex
cellent instruction at Stanford,
and that doesn't mean Western
Culture. "I'm learning quite a bit
just from playing against Howard
(Wright) every day — it's good
for me," Keefe said.
As a backup for Wright, Keefe
is a deadly weapon for the Car
dinal. When NBA-bound Wright
exits the game (as he did on fouls
against the Wildcats), Keefe can
come in and continue to hurt the
opposition.
"When Adam comes in, it's not
a letdown," McSweeney said. "It's
almost a pickup. He can rebound,
score, do just about anything."
And although this year there is
not much pressure on him, Keefe
is the future for Stanford. The
future, if this season is any indi
cation, is in good hands.

Stanford opponents have gone to great lengths to contain Adam Keefe this season. Here Keefe gets
fouled in a big way against Arizona.
