# Crime takes toll over recent break
## 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
Although Police Captain Raoul
Niemeyer said there have been
fewer reports of campus thefts
over vacation than in past years,
several office workers and stu
dents have nevertheless reported
stolen computers and stereo
equipment.
Niemeyer said the Varian
Physics Building, the Black House
and Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity
were among those places hit. In
addition, students reported break
ins at Casa Italiana, suggesting
that the list may not yet be com
plete.
Droni Choi, the business man
ager at Varian, said it was the
"third theft since Thanksgiving."
Choi said a Macintosh II was
stolen from a professor's office.
The door to the office had been
locked, but there was no sign of
a forced entry, suggesting that the
intruder may have had a key.
The professor was last in his
office Dec. 29, placing the incident
somewhere after that.
Prior to this theft, another Mac
intosh and a digital oscilliscope

were stolen from one of the
physics labs Thanksgiving eve. On
Dec. 16 a printer was taken from
the lab.
There was no sign of forced
entry in either of these incidents.
WTiile the Black House also re
pprted a stolen computer and
printer over vacation, the robbery
there did involve a forced break-in
and entry.
According to Keith Archuleta,
director of the black community
services center, the intruder pried
open a back window and removed
a nailed in screen in order to enter
the locked building. An Im
agewriter printer and Macintosh
were stolen from an office.
The office manager discovered
the theft Dec. 19. Police suspect
the incident occurred somewhere
between the 16th and the 19th.
A theft in a student residence
occurred at the Alpha Delt house.
Fraternity member Chris Hayes
said that over vacation his stereo,
more than 100 compact discs and
an answering machine were stolen
from his room.
The room had been locked, but
during the break University
workers had been in his room to
fix the door jamb.
Though the police do not know
who committed the theft, on Dec.
28, a maintenance worker saw
someone who appeared to be
camping out in a living room at
the Alpha Delts and called the
police.
The police arrived at the house
and told the intruder to leave.
Two days later it was determined
that someone had been inside
three other rooms, yet there was
no sign of any forced entrance,
Hayes said.
Concerned about University of
ficials entering his room over va
cation to check for refrigerators
and water beds, Alpha Delt mem

ber Evan Tuchinsky set "traps"
to test the inspectors.
He tied strings between his desk
drawers and returned from vaca
tion to find them broken, suggest
ing that someone had gone
through his drawers.
Hayes said he "didn't want to
accuse University workers but ob
viously someone with a master
key was going around and looking
at things they had no right to be
inspecting."
Several students living in Casa
Italians also had items stolen.
On Dec. 16, as finals were end
ing, wallets and jewelry were
stolen from five rooms. The rooms
had been left unlocked, but the
occupants were in other parts of
the building at the time.
That same day a suspicious
looking man was seen leaving the
building late in the afternoon, said
Resident Assistant Mary Ellis.
