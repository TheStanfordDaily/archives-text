# Wanted: road dominance

What can be done to make Stan
ford feel at home on the road?
The Cardinal men's basket
ball team returns to the road after its
uplifting win over Arizona Thursday to
play at Washington State and Washing
ton this week. Those schools are two of
the weakest in the Pacific 10 Conference,
but they still figure to be difficult tests
for Stanford, which has gone 7-0 at home
but 3-3 on the road in 1988-89.

That's not to imply Stanford has any
thing to be ashamed of about its road
play this year. The Cardinal, which
moved up to No. 21 in the Associated
Press poll yesterday, has only lost to AP
top-40 teams this year: No. 8 North
Carolina, No. 23 Indiana and UCLA,
which is tied for 35th.
But this basketball season on the
Farm is not about avoiding shame; it's
about making opponents quiver at the
thought of playing us. It's about making
the fans at unfriendly arenas come out
in hordes when the mighty Cardinal
invades, instead of picking that night to
catch up on their schoolwork, or drink
ing, as the case may be.
That much has been accomplished this
year. But there's one more bridge to
cross in Stanford's never-ending pursuit
of a dream season, and that's to win
the games we're supposed to win — no
matter where. That means if we can
beat Oregon State at home by 28, we
should handle the Beavers on the road
as well.
This necessarily goes against one of
the natural laws of basketball — home
teams have the advantage;
"The game of basketball is played in
spurts," Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "That's what the home
court will do for you. It will sustain
your runs a little longer, and take the
steam out of theirs."
It's apparent Stanford needs to hone
the ability to avoid this road trap.
That's because Stanford can't win
the Pac-10 title without beating teams,
even the tough ones, on the road.
So Arizona Coach Lute Olson, though
expectedly unhappy about losing at
Maples again, was not despondent about
it due to his grasp of a simple but rel
evant point.

"We're on the road — it's a game
they've got to win," Olson said.
Olson added that Stanford has still
got to brave the Wildcats' domain, the
perpetually sold-out McKale Center,
which holds almost twice as many rabid
fans as Maples. That will happen Jan.
29.
Until then, Stanford really hasn't
gained that much of an advantage over
Arizona. It has simply held serve.
Five of the 10 Pac-10 arenas figure
to be litmus tests this season: Maples,
McKale, Pauley Pavilion at UCLA, Har
mon Arena at California, and Gill
Coliseum at Oregon State. In road games
at those places, Arizona is 2-1. Stanford
is 0-1. So, until Stanford gets some more
tough road wins, Arizona continues to
be the team to beat in the Pac-10.
No way that will be easy. For ex
ample, if you think Stanford is
going to be able to spot Arizona
a 21-4 lead and come back and win
against a team that has won 100 straight
conference games at home, think again.
"It would have been a lot tougher (to
beat Arizona on the road)," Stanford
guard Todd Lichti said. "The crowd
helped us out a lot. . . . We're familiar
with the facilities. I don't think it would
have been impossible but it would have
been difficult."

Until Stanford gets some
more tough road wins,
Arizona continues to be
the team to beat in the
Pac-10.

Of course, if the Cardinal stumbles
against any of the bottom five, that digs
the hole even deeper. Stanford must
sweep this road trip if it wants to win
the Pac-10.
In light of that, one way for Stanford
to elevate its road play is to elevate its
concentration level.
Notable of the spurts in which Stan
ford fell behind against Arizona at home
and blew its lead against UCLA on the
road were the turnovers — many of
which were, to refer once more to tennis
parlance, unforced errors.
Mistakes like those transcend the
home-road distinction. If Stanford can
avoid some of the mistakes that allow
opponents to go on 21-4 runs, then Mont
gomery's Law of Road Spurt Disadvan
tage is less likely to come into play.
And the more Stanford can do that,
the more it will make every opposing
arena its own little Maples Pavilion.
