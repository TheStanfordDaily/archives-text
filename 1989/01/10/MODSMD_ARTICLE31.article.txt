# Klein is first team All-America
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Over the course of her Stanford debut
this fall, Kristin Klein has continually
impressed fans and opponents alike with
her proficient hitting and tenacious de
fense.
Apparently, the selection committee
for the Russell-American Volleyball
Coaches Association's All-America
Team was equally impressed. An
nounced at the Final Four in Minneap
olis last month, Klein was the only
freshman named a First Team Ail-
American and the first true frosh to be
so honored since Stanford alumna and
1988 Olympic Team captain Kim Oden.

Match after match, a
Kristin Klein kill
scored the winning
point for Stanford.

"It's a real honot," Cardinal Coach
Don Shaw said.
Joining Klein are a host of stellar
players, including Pacific 10 Conference
foes Laurie Wetzel from Washington,
Christy Nore of Arizona State and
UCLA's Daiva Tomkus and Ann Boyer.
All five were named to the All-
Conference team in early December.
Rounding out the 12-player team are
Hawaii's Teee Williams, Illinois' Mary
Eggers, Brigham Young's Dylann Dun
can, NCAA Champion Texas' Dawn
Davenport and Nebraska's Laurie En
dicott and Virginia Stahr. Tara Cross,
the outside hitter from Long Beach
State who led the nation in kills, deposed
Williams as Player of the Year.
Over the course of Stanford's
remarkably successful season, Klein
emerged as the team's franchise player
and one of the reasons for the team's
consistent ranking in the top three. The
Cardinal never dropped on the Tac
hikara/AVCA Poll after surpassing its
preseason No. 4 rartking right off the
bat, finishing the regular season at the
No. 2 spot Stanford claimed after
beating the then-second-ranked Hawaii
in the title match of the Stanford In
vitational.
Though hitters Jennifer ChafTee and
Amy Cooper received much publicity
and credit for the.team's success, it was
Klein who garnered the most respect.
One of the Cardinal's hardest hitters,
Klein was almost always unstoppable
when the chips were down. Match after
match, a Kristin Klein kill scored the
winning point for Stanford.
"Early on, she was carrying quite a

hit of the offensive load," Shaw 'ecalled.
Its not that we didn't mix up our
offense, but she got a lot of sets. She
had a lot of great hitting matches."
The statistics readily show this. Klein
led the team in kills with 487, an
average of 4.4 per game. Percentage
wise, the freshman hit a blistering .317,
second only to classmate Cooper's .334.
KJein also led the team in digs with
384, squeaking past perennial leader
Amy Hayes by a mere three digs. KJein

also recorded 26 service aces, 17 block
solos and 38 block assists.
In all, it was a very auspicious debut
for the player deemed the Pac-10 Fresh
man of the Year, and the harbinger for
an outstanding future. Moving effec
tively from her high school position of
middle blocker to the outside, Klein
should continue to set the standard for
Stanford's left-side hitters.
"She will have a lot to live up to next
year," Shaw noted.
