# Anti-Semitic fliers circulated again on campus
## 
### DJ Berinstein Staff writer 
Continuing a stream of anti-semitic
propaganda distributed at Stanford, about
25 leaflets equating Judaism with Commu
nism were left yesterday on windshields of
cars parked around the Oval at noon.
The two-sided flier quoted The Bible, a
New York Times article, National Geo
graphic and other sources, drawing paral
lels between an impending nuclear
holocaust, the spread of Communism and
an alleged Jewish conspiracy. The distrib
utors of the fliers are unknown.
Reaction was subdued at Stanford Hillel.
"I am torn between taking these people
seriously or thinking of them as fools, but
they are probably fools," said Hillel Pro
gram Director Jocelyn Reisman.
"I think these kind of people get satis
faction out of the publicity in the papers,"

she said. "They have a right to believe
what they want to believe, but it is offensive
to be spreading it like this."
"People thought the Nazis were fools,
too," added Lara Mandel, a undergraduate
who recently took a trip to Germany with
the Stanford Hillel to discuss the
Holocaust. "People thought nothing would
happen then, and it did," she said.
Hillel has had a conservative reaction to
recent anti-semitic events. Last November,
Hillel and the Stanford campus were tar
geted by several anti-semitic fliers.
Hillel received a skinhead newspaper
delivered to their front door in mid-
December, but *aid they did not
want to draw attention to it since the
publicity only gives the senders "satisfac
tion."
"It's a real shame," said Erica Austin,
a doctoral student in communication, who
found one of the leaflets on her truck after

lunch. "Especially after Christmas, it shows
there's not a lot of spirit."
Austin said she was not surprised by the
flier in light of the recent racial incidents
at Stanford, but added that she was as
tonished at the speed with which they were
placed on the cars: "To put them on the
cars the first day back at school shows that
the issue must have been on someone's
mind a while."
A prayer entitled "George Washington's
Vision," attributed to the Gospel Tract So
ciety of Independence, Missouri, was also
printed at the bottom of the leaflet. The
society, one of two names listed at the
bottom of the leaflet, is a non-profit print
ing company that specializes in evangelical
literature, according to David Buttram, the
owner of the company.
Buttram said in an interview yesterday
that he knew nothing about his prayer
heing on this leaflet, but said that some

times people reproduce parts of prayers,
talcing them out of context.
"I apologize for any offense we (the com
pany) may have caused," Buttram said.
"We are gospel publishers, and we haven't
done anything offensive in the past and
certainly that is not our purpose." He added
that after the prayers are printed, he has
no control over where they are published.
The flier is not attributed to any group,
but the address of Sons of Liberty, of
Metairie, La., is listed at the bottom of the
flier, along with the address of the societv.
One side of the leaflet contains an article
from The New York Times, dated March
11, 1987. The original headline, "Japanese
writers critical Of Jews," was changed to
"The Jews Knighted States of America."
The article deals with a popular Japanese
author who argues that his country's eco
nomic problems are the result of a con
spiracy by "international Jewish capital."
