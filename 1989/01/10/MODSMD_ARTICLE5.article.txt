# Suicide ruled out in student death
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Santa Clara County medical ex
aminers found in mid-December
that Stanford Law School student
Arthur Rivers died last October
from a lung condition called
pulmonary edema, caused by un
known circumstances.

Pulmonary edema is a condition
in which the victim suffers from
an accumulation of fluid in the
lungs, depriving the victim of
oxygen and causing death.

Although inves
tigators haven't
established the
cause of death,
the Mountain
View Police De
partment has
closed the case,
finding no evi
dence of suicide
or foul play.

According to the coroners'
report, Rivers was found dead in
his Mountain View apartment on
Oct. 7. His apartment manager
found his badly decomposed body
while conducting a door-to-door
search for an odor coming from
the vicinity of Rivers' apartment.
Rivers, who was 26 years old
when he died, was found lying

lished the cause of death, the Mountain
View Police Department has closed the
case, finding no evidence of suicide or
foul play.

"with his hands under his chest
and his legs spread apart," ac
cording to the report. Nothing
from the apartment appeared to
be removed or disturbed, with no
signs of struggle or suicide.
Rivers' death was unrelated to
the suicide of Timothy Rizzo, a
first-year electrical engineering
graduate student, whose body was
found two days after Rivers was
found.
Dr. Margaret Billingham, a
Stanford Medical School profes
sor, said pulmonary edema "can
happen very quickly" with the vic
tim sometimes not even aware of
his condition before he is unable
to breathe.
Dr. Ronald Pearl, from the Med
ical School, said there are "hun
dreds of things" that can cause
pulmonary edema. He said it is

commonly due to heart failure
which creates a back-up of fluid
in the blood vessels in the lung.
Pearl said pulmonary edema
can also result from damage to
the lung itself which makes the
lung "leaky." Such damage can
come from shock or trauma.
Billingham said the cause of
pulmonary edema is "not always
clear." She said the condition can
be brought about through a wide
variety of circumstances from
drowning to accidents to a drug
overdose.
County medical examiner Ken
neth Hyland said the cause of
death is especially difficult to de
termine if the body is badly
decomposed.
Hyland said deaths such as
Rivers' in which the cause cannot
be determined are somewhat rare,
happening "every so often."
