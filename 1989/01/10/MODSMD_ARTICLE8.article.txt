# William Chace:
## With a Wesley an eye to the West 
### Susan McKean Editorial staff 
Editor's note: Last week, The
Daily spoke with former Stan
ford English Prof, and Vice
Provost William Chace a f Wes
leyan University in Middletown,
Conn., where he has been pres
ident since this summer. This
article is the first of a two-part
series aimed at bringing some
of the famous Chace educational
commentary back to the West
Coast.
Part 1 focuses on his impres
sions of Wesleyan in contrast to
Stanford, a retrospective of the
Western Culture debate and a
comparison of the educations af
forded by a small East Coast
university and a larger West
Coast university.
In tomorrow's paper, Part 11
will explore Chace's perspective
on minority issues, teaching
morality in and out of the class
room and the pursuance of truer
coeducation.
The day of the interview, Wes
leyan presented its most bitterly

cold countenance as the wind
whipped around the ivy-run
brick buildings and the
venerably skeletal maples and
oaks. Inside South College,
Chace's high-ceilinged office
evokes a ballroom-turned-
English-professor's den with
bookshelves and a King Arthur
sized round table. One shelf
boasts several James Joyce
works, reflecting a love of the
author about whom Chace will
teach a class this semester.
Right away, he wants to know
the news from Stanford. Listen
ing intently, he nods and shakes
his head as familiar chords of
student diversity, Western Cul
ture, teaching assistant cut
backs and Cardinal football
strike a resonance some 3,000
miles away.
And Chace, the "vicious
pedagogue from Hell" — as he
was introduced by a spoof issue
of the Wesleyan paper — ap
pears settled and happy in his
new clime. He speaks proudly
of Wesleyan, insightfully weigh
ing the qualities of the East and

West Coast institutions he
knows and understands now
better than most.
He mentions a pizza dinner
with the Wesleyan ultimate fris
bee team this fall, regular meet
ings with minority group
leaders and his fascination with
a proposal for a so-called wom
en's fraternity. No longer sport
ing a band around his ankle to
protect his pants from bicycle
grease, he is clearly acclimated
to Wesleyan life and the rigors
of university leadership.
"You can tell my friends at
Stanford that I haven't had a
whole lot of time lately for any
hobbies. In fact, one of my
hobbies has turned out to be
sleeping, that and eating."
Apparently, however, he has
had plenty of time to test the
waters at Wesleyan and arrive
at some noteworthy conclusions
about education in general and
in comparison with Stanford.
"I have found Wesleyan to be
every bit as intellectually vi-
