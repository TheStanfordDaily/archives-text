# William Chace:
## With a Wesley an eye to the West 
### Susan McKean Editorial staff 
Editor's note: Last week, The
Daily spoke with former Stan
ford English Prof, and Vice
Provost William Chace a f Wes
leyan University in Middletown,
Conn., where he has been pres
ident since this summer. This
article is the first of a two-part
series aimed at bringing some
of the famous Chace educational
commentary back to the West
Coast.
Part 1 focuses on his impres
sions of Wesleyan in contrast to
Stanford, a retrospective of the
Western Culture debate and a
comparison of the educations af
forded by a small East Coast
university and a larger West
Coast university.
In tomorrow's paper, Part 11
will explore Chace's perspective
on minority issues, teaching
morality in and out of the class
room and the pursuance of truer
coeducation.
The day of the interview, Wes
leyan presented its most bitterly

cold countenance as the wind
whipped around the ivy-run
brick buildings and the
venerably skeletal maples and
oaks. Inside South College,
Chace's high-ceilinged office
evokes a ballroom-turned-
English-professor's den with
bookshelves and a King Arthur
sized round table. One shelf
boasts several James Joyce
works, reflecting a love of the
author about whom Chace will
teach a class this semester.
Right away, he wants to know
the news from Stanford. Listen
ing intently, he nods and shakes
his head as familiar chords of
student diversity, Western Cul
ture, teaching assistant cut
backs and Cardinal football
strike a resonance some 3,000
miles away.
And Chace, the "vicious
pedagogue from Hell" — as he
was introduced by a spoof issue
of the Wesleyan paper — ap
pears settled and happy in his
new clime. He speaks proudly
of Wesleyan, insightfully weigh
ing the qualities of the East and

West Coast institutions he
knows and understands now
better than most.
He mentions a pizza dinner
with the Wesleyan ultimate fris
bee team this fall, regular meet
ings with minority group
leaders and his fascination with
a proposal for a so-called wom
en's fraternity. No longer sport
ing a band around his ankle to
protect his pants from bicycle
grease, he is clearly acclimated
to Wesleyan life and the rigors
of university leadership.
"You can tell my friends at
Stanford that I haven't had a
whole lot of time lately for any
hobbies. In fact, one of my
hobbies has turned out to be
sleeping, that and eating."
Apparently, however, he has
had plenty of time to test the
waters at Wesleyan and arrive
at some noteworthy conclusions
about education in general and
in comparison with Stanford.
"I have found Wesleyan to be
every bit as intellectually vi-
brant as Stanford, indeed if not
more so. I think the very best
Stanford student would feel right
at home here, and vice versa."
He finds that education at Wes
leyan closely approximates the
image of Eastern education held
commonly by people in California.
It fulfills the expectation that "for
a variety of reasons — history,
culture, weather, ambiance —
East Coast schools have intellec
tual life more overtly present in
their conversations."
In illustration of the intellectual
vibrancy of which he speaks, he
cites his correspondence with a
Wesleyan senior on the "virtues
— such as they are — of anar
chism."
And under his own leadership,
anarchism's virtues are under
close scrutiny. He hopes to reform
the faculty structures of gover
nance, employing systems similar
to those at Stanford. His agenda
includes work on many issues
familiar to Stanford: curriculum
reform and the residential life pro
gram.
CIV labor pains
A Western Culture require
ment, however, is on no one's
agenda for the curriculum, Chace
said. Last year at Stanford, he
vocally advocated the retention of
the core reading list and was a
pillar of the Western Culture
debate. Nonetheless, he has no
intention of establishing a course
similar to Stanford's former pro
gram.

Unlike Stanford's distribution
requirement system, Wesleyan
operates on a so-called "system of
expectations," which is less spe
cific and more flexible.
"Every institution has its own
history and you've got to live with
that history. Stanford and Wes
leyan are two very different insti
tutions," Chace said.
But he continues to be actively
interested in the implementation
and fate of the Cultures, Ideas
and Values course that replaced
Western Culture, and last week
offered retrospective praise for
the debate and some continued
skepticism about its future.
"It was an excellent debate.
[Former Sec. of Education Wil
liam] Bennett and company were
wrong in seeing it as a vulgar,
gutter struggle. I think Stanford
did very well and had one of its
finer hours in having so many
good discussions, so many good
arguments," he said.
Yet, in light of continued con
troversy over the dearth of qual
ified faculty to teach the new
course and voiced dismay about
its vagueness, he reluctantly
sounds the cry of 'I told you so.'
"I am genuinely concerned
about [the current CIV labor
pains] because it confirms my
sense of things that Stanford was
not in the position, budgetarily,
to allocate positions for this par
ticular course that everybody
knew from the outset extant fac
ulty would have to teach.
"Many voices had been raised
to say that if the course changed
and became more cross-cultural,
international and non-Western
there would be members of the
faculty who would readily teach

the course. If that is not so, as
it now turns out, then some people
were certainly misinformed.
"I think the administration had
made it very clear — whatever
happened to the course — that
the faculty on the books at the
present time, maybe a different
cross-section of them, would have
to teach the course. That was how
the argument was framed.
"But now that there's an argu
ment being made that we have to
hire a new set of faculty, there
are problems. No good institution
hires faculty to teach special
courses. You hire people to teach
a discipline.
"People argued that there was
a great number of discontent,
junior faculty — particularly from
ethnic minorities and women —
who wanted to teach a general
education course, but couldn't
teach the Western Culture class
because it was parochial. But no
one asked who these faculty would
be."
A study in difference
Aside from a different require
ment system, Chace noted several
areas of the educational regimen
and academic life at Wesleyan that
differ starkly from Stanford —
both for good and for bad.
Wesleyan is one-sixth the size
of Stanford, with 2,800 under
graduates and 125 graduate stu
dents. Therefore, many of the is
sues facing its president differ
from those present at Stanford.
"We have a problem of a cur
riculum that out-stresses the
pedagogical resources. Wesleyan
has tried to be everything to
everyone. There is less concern
— rightly or wrongly — for cur

ricular control here than at Stan
ford.
"In effect, we probably have too
many courses and we do not have
adequate curricular control — but
that does not mean establishing
a core curriculum."
An academic issue pressing
Stanford currently — the role and
salaries of TAs — is "simply not
a problem" at Wesleyan, Chace
said, because there are "virtually
no TAs."
And he indirectly suggests that
Stanford students should perhaps
realize the real jeopardy of their
education if this system is not
righted, as he places the impetus
for change in their hands.
"You can't imagine a problem
about by whom you are being
taught, you are taught by the
professorial faculty. So that's a
difference. Wesleyan students take
a very, very strong pride and in
terest in the fact that they are
taught by their professors,"
After several months of ac
quainting himself with Wesleyan,
Chace has detected another vari
ance from Stanford — a different
sort of educational atmosphere
pervades the fire-brick red build
ings.
"When (I) talk to students here,
a striking difference I have
noticed is a dramatic absence of
emphasis on pre-professionalism.
I have learned that one of the
most mistaken or erroneous
opening gambits you can make
with a member of the senior class
is to ask what he or she is going
to do. And that, I think, is quite
unlike Stanford."

Part II will appear in the Fea
tures section of tomorrow's Daily.

Wesleyan University President William Chace, formerly professor
of English and vice provost at Stanford, seized power as a fascist
dictator this fall, according to the front page of the Wealeyan
Worker, a one-Issue radical newspaper for the empowerment of
students — "by the students, for the students" and a great big
Chace-condoned joke.
