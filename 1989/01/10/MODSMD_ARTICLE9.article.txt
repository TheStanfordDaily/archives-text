# Joseph Biden to visit Stanford for foreign policy speech
## 
### John Wagner Staff writer 
Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., the second
ranked Democrat on the U.S. Senate
Foreign Relations Committee and former
presidential candidate, will offer his
thoughts on the future of American foreign

policy tonight at Kresge
Auditorium at 7:30 p.m.
Biden's speech, titled
"New Directions in Amer
ican Foreign Policy," is
open to the public, free of
charge.
Since his election to the
Senate in 1972, Biden has
been active in the areas of
U.S.-Soviet relations,

NATO policy, arms control and Middle East
policy. He has been critical of the last two
administrations' actions in the Middle East
and has led efforts to remove U.S. forces

from and disallow the sale and
transfer of sophisticated weapons to the
region.
Biden is perhaps best known to the public
for his troubled bid for the Democratic
presidential nomination in the fall of 1987.
His campaign became unhinged after
revelations of resume bolstering and
plaigerism appeared in The New York
Times and other media.
In September 1987, Biden presided over
the senate confirmation hearings of Robert
Bork, now a retired federal appellate court
judge, who was nominated by President
Reagan for the Supreme Court. His cam
paign team had hoped the hearings would
provide the positive national exposure nec
essary to distinguish Biden from the other
six Democratic hopefuls.
Shortly before Bork even took the witness
stand, however, The Times printed a front
page story pointing out that, in a campaign
speech, Biden had used two famous pas
sages from Robert Kennedy's speeches,

The Times had reported a few weeks
earlier that Biden, in his closing speech at
an lowa Democratic debate, had lifted with
out credit a stirring passage from a cam
paign ad by British Labor Party leader
Neil Kinnock.
In addition, several claims made by Biden
at a campaign stop about his qualifications
came back to haunt him during his cam
paign.
Contrary to his assertion that he atten
ded Syracuse Law School on a full academic

scholarship, Biden went on a half scholar
ship based on financial need. He didn't
finish in the top half of his class as he
claimed, but was 76th out of a class of 85.
Biden also claimed that he won the award
given to the outstanding political science
student at his undergraduate college, the
University of Delaware. He did not. Nor
did Biden graduate from Delaware with
three degrees as he claimed; he received a
single B.A. in political science and history.
Ironically, the discoveries which drove
Biden out of the race quite literally saved
his life.
In early February 1988, Biden was felled
by a life-threatening brain aneurysm, the
swelling of a brain artery. He was rushed
to Walter Reed Army Medical Center for
eight hours of cranial surgery, a procedure
which many patients do not survive.
The first symptom of his aneurysms —
a headache which he thought resulted from
a pinched nerve — came during what would
have been peak campaigning time.
