# Kennedy essay urges dialogue about racism
## 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
In his essay entitled "Reflections on Racial Un
derstanding," University President Donald Kennedy
makes public his thoughts on the issues raised by
the racist incidents since last spring that have shaken
Stanford and have made headlines across the coun
try.
Kennedy writes that "Reflections," is "not an effort
to establish policy or even to guide its development,"
but rather serves as a springboard for more thorough
discussion of racial understanding at Stanford.

News Analysis

The complete version of Kennedy's statement ap
pears as an advertisement on page 8 of The Daily.
He begins his essay, dated Jan. 6, by writing that
several students urged him to write a "thoughtful
paper" about the impact of racist incidents, such as
the one in which two white freshman upset several
house members by defacing a poster in Ujamaa
House, the black theme house.
Kennedy probably had other incentives as well.
He has been quoted as saying that "the Ujamaa
incident gave rise to the need to put some of [the
President's office's] policies and perspectives on
paper."
Kennedy may have also felt a certain urgency in
writing his essay because some students and admin
istrators have said Stanford's image has taken a
beating due to national media attention on such
racist events as that in Ujamaa.
So, while many outsiders could be led to believe
that the University is "an institute beset by racial
incidents," Kennedy writes that "At Stanford ... we
should grit our teeth and move ahead, without elab
orate mortification."
An important factor in starting, and keeping alive,
discussions about the weighty subject of campus
racial interactions is the president's timing. Because
his piece appears during the first week of winter
quarter, last quarter's upsetting incidents — like
the on-campus circulation of anti-Semitic fliers-, for
example — are still fresh in most student's memories.
His writing also sets the stage
for next Wednesday's release of a
factual report on the events at
Ujamaa, according to Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons.
Together, the factual report and
Kennedy's essay equal "a goldmine
of stuff to think about, write about
and talk about," Lyons said.
Kennedy includes in his essay
the confession that he cannot
please everyone.
He wrote: "The theme (of rac
ism) itself is so difficult . . . that
no discussion of it is likely to strike
everyone as thoughtful."
With those words Kennedy ac
knowledges the leviathon dimen
sions of problems and questions
that can arise whenever someone
takes on a discussion of race re

lations.
Without his carefully worded
preface, Kennedy might have only
alienated or upset those who
agreed with him.
Kennedy also asks questions in
"Reflections" in the hopes that he
and the Stanford community can
come closer to some solutions.
Kennedy's essay contains the
message: "We should not expect
too much."
He believes that just like anyone
taking on something challenging,
Stanford has to take its lumps and
forge ahead. In the presidents
view, that process will be beneficial
if the community learns.
The last paragraph of "Reflec
tions" contains Kennedy's idyllic
view of Stanford. He then acknowl
edges, "We are clearly not there
yet, but it is an objective we can
attain — and in doing so, give
others a glimpse of what the future
can be like."
