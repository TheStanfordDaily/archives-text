# Kennedy essay urges dialogue about racism
## 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
In his essay entitled "Reflections on Racial Un
derstanding," University President Donald Kennedy
makes public his thoughts on the issues raised by
the racist incidents since last spring that have shaken
Stanford and have made headlines across the coun
try.
Kennedy writes that "Reflections," is "not an effort
to establish policy or even to guide its development,"
but rather serves as a springboard for more thorough
discussion of racial understanding at Stanford.

News Analysis

The complete version of Kennedy's statement ap
pears as an advertisement on page 8 of The Daily.
He begins his essay, dated Jan. 6, by writing that
several students urged him to write a "thoughtful
paper" about the impact of racist incidents, such as
the one in which two white freshman upset several
house members by defacing a poster in Ujamaa
House, the black theme house.
Kennedy probably had other incentives as well.
He has been quoted as saying that "the Ujamaa
incident gave rise to the need to put some of [the
President's office's] policies and perspectives on
paper."
Kennedy may have also felt a certain urgency in
writing his essay because some students and admin
istrators have said Stanford's image has taken a
beating due to national media attention on such
racist events as that in Ujamaa.
So, while many outsiders could be led to believe
that the University is "an institute beset by racial
incidents," Kennedy writes that "At Stanford ... we
should grit our teeth and move ahead, without elab
orate mortification."
An important factor in starting, and keeping alive,
discussions about the weighty subject of campus
racial interactions is the president's timing. Because
his piece appears during the first week of winter
quarter, last quarter's upsetting incidents — like
the on-campus circulation of anti-Semitic fliers-, for
example — are still fresh in most student's memories.
