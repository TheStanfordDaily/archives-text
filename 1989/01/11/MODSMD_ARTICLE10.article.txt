# New center negotiates conflict-free beginning

### Caitlin Liu 
Though it has only been in op
eration for seven months, the
Stanford Center on Conflict and
Negotiation got off to a running
start this year, naming 12 Stan
ford graduate students as center
fellows last night.
The first recipients of the fel
lowships represent a variety of
fields, including law, psychology,
communications, economics,
sociology, political science and
sociolinguistics, according to the
center's assoc. Director Daniel Ab
basi.
The composition of this year's
fellows reflects the center's status
as an interdisciplinary center that
integrates the fields of law, eco
nomics, business management
and psychology. "Our hope is to
do some important basic re
search," Director of the center and
Law School Prof. Robert Mnookin
said.
"No single discipline has a
monopoly of insight that can con
tribute to our understanding of
conflict and negotiation," he
added.
Originating as a graduate sem
inar in decision analysis, the cen

ter evolved as the professors of
the course "discovered [they] had
a shared interest in conflict and
negotiation," Mnookin said.
The 12 fellowships recipients
are Joseph Sakovics, Melanie
Cohen, Craig (Tony) Arnold, Jim
Losey, Kimberly Zisk, Kenneth
Roberts, Kent Harber, Robert
Robinson, Dacher Keltner, Cath
erine Albiston, Keun-Kwan Ryu
and Bonnie McElhinny. Each re
ceived a $500 stipend.
In addition, Laurie Mason, Mar
jorie Castle and Jeff Knopf re
ceived research grants but were
not named as fellows. The grants
will go to defray the costs of re
search projects.
Harvard University and other
colleges have similar centers, ac
cording to Mnookin, but the Stan
ford center primarily focuses upon
"barriers to the negotiated reso
lution of conflict."
Mnookin is one of five "princi
ple investigators" of the center.
The other four faculty members
heading the center are Economics
Prof, and Nobel laureate Kenneth
Arrow, Psychology Profs. Amos
Tversky and Lee Ross, and Busi
ness School Prof. Robert Wilson.
