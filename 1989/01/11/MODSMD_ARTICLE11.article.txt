## Pro-and anti-abortion groups oppose post-abortion studies 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Pro
and anti-abortion groups, unlikely
allies, agreed yesterday that the
government does not need to
spend tens of millions of dollars
to determine whether abortion
damages a woman's physical or
emotional health.
Surgeon General C. Everett
Koop proposed such a study, he
said in an interview with The As
sociated Press, because "the data
simply do not support the premise
that abortion does or does not
cause a specific, post-abortion
psychiatric syndrome."
Koop had been asked by Pres
ident Reagan to prepare a com
prehensive report on the issue,
but said he told the president he
could not because there is no sci
entific evidence to support the
pro-life belief that abortion harms
women or the pro-choice stance
that abortion is beneficial.
Koop, who said he remains
firmly opposed to abortion, told
Reagan that a comprehensive
study costing from $10 million to
$100 million would take five years
to complete.
"That seems like a lot of money,
but when you figure that 1.5 mil

lion women get aborted every
year, that's only $75 per woman,"
Koop said.
Pro- and anti-abortion groups
said a study is not needed.
Nancy Broff of the National
Abortion Rights Action League
praised Koop for doing a "fair
study" and said the tens of mil
lions he proposes spending on an
other study could be better used
for contraception research.
Nellie Gray of March for Life
said Koop is "highly misguided,"
adding, "We don't need any more
studies; what we need is for Koop
to retire."
However, one anti-abortion
group, National Right to Life, said
a study like the one Koop is
proposing is "long overdue." Psy
chological harm from abortion of
ten surfaces five to 10 years after
the abortion, and existing re
search generally is based on
studies of women in their first
year after abortion, said Olivia
Gans, an official of the group.
The decision on whether such
a study should be conducted likely
will fall to President elect-Bush,
who upset anti-abortion forces
with his nomination of Louis Sul

livan to head the Department of
Health and Human Services.
Sullivan drew an outcry from
anti-abortion forces when he said
in a newspaper interview that he
supported a woman's right to seek
an abortion but opposed federal
aid to pay for it. He later said he
opposed abortion except in cases
of rape, incest and where the life
of the mother is threatened, which
mirrors Rush's view on abortion.
Sheila Tate, a press represen
tative for the Bush transition
team, said she did not know
whether the incoming administra
tion would pursue Koop's recom
mended abortion study.
Reagan administration officials
had nothing to say about Koop's
decision not to issue a report, a
decision he detailed in a letter
delivered to the White House on
Monday. Presidential press repre
sentative Marlin Fitzwater said
Reagan "doesn't have any charac
terization one way or the other"
of the letter.
Koop said that when he left the
White House after talking to
Reagan aides on Monday, "I had
the impression that I would be
hearing from Mr. Reagan."
