# Non-aligned nations seek to isolate U.S., Britain on Libya

UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Libya and
the non-aligned nations offered a
watered-down resolution yesterday
deploring the United States for shooting
down two Libyan fighter jets, but they
continued to blast Washington in their
speeches.
Britain and the United States have
indicated they will veto any resolution
that criticizes the U.S. Navy, which they
say acted in self-defense.
"It will not be passed, that is what
will happen," vowed Herbert Okun, the
second-ranking U.S. ambassador. "It will
not be adopted, you can be sure of that."
Third World nations backed off from
the harsh rhetoric that followed the Jan.

4 downing of the Libyan jets. Their latest
draft resolution toned down its criticism
in a campaign to isolate the United States
and its steadfast ally, Britain, on the
council.
Originally condemning the incident and
later strongly deploring it, the latest ver
sion of the U.N. Security Council reso
lution "deplores" the shoot-down. It also
dropped the reference to an "unprovoked
attack."
"It is totally unacceptable as far as we
are concerned; they have inserted some
fig-leaf language," said Okun.
Formal introduction of the resolution
and a vote, originally planned for last
night, were postponed after 11 members

asked to speak before the 15-member
body.
Decrying the use of force and U.S.
intentions toward Libya were speakers
from East Germany, Romania, Czecho
slovakia, Poland, Yemen, Malta, the
United Arab Emirates, Libya, the Islamic
Conference, and two South African lib
eration groups, the African National
Congress and the Pan Azanian Confer
ence.
Libyan Ambassador Ali Treiki told the
council the U.S. 6th Fleet told Libya
aviation authorities it planned more aer
ial maneuvers near Libya Jan. 16-17.
Okun said he was unaware of such
plans but afterward told reporters: "I

don't think it would be strange, not in
international waters. The Mediterranean
is a very big place."
The United States has said the two
Libyan MiG-23s were armed and closing
in an attack approach on two U.S.
warplanes on routine patrol with the U.S.
Navy in international waters in the
Mediterranean off Libya.
Washington asserts the MiGs changed
course five times to intercept the U.S.
F-14 Tomcats before the American pilots
shot them down.
Libya says the MiGs were unarmed
reconnaissance planes. On Friday, U.S.
Ambassador Vernon Walters showed the

Security Council photographs of one of
the MiGs, which appeared to have missile
pods on it.
Libya's envoy, Ali Sunni Muntasser,
claimed the photographs were retouched
to add the armaments.
On Friday, a first draft of the anti-U.S.
resolution would have had the council
members "condemn" the United States
for the "unprovoked attack," and call for
the U.S. Navy to leave the Mediter
ranean.
The latest draft diluted the criticism
to having the council say it "deplores the
downing of the two Libyan reconnais
sance planes" and call for the U.S. Navy
to suspend its maneuvers off Libya.
