# Bush backs education reforms
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)
President-elect Bush yesterday
pledged to be an advocate for
public school improvement and to
offer "every feasible assistance"
to schools and districts pursuing
reforms.
Bush told participants in a
White House education workshop
that the federal government
should do everything in its power
to strengthen the links between
families and schools "and that
speaks for a broader federal role
in education than might immedi
ately be apparent."
Despite "tough budgetary
times," Bush said, "I do intend to
provide every feasible assistance
to states, to districts interested in
further experimentation with
choice plans and other valuable
reforms."
Bush, who campaigned on a
pledge to be an education presi
dent, called for school reform
fueled by state and local innova
tions. He said he will ask the Ed
ucation Department "to monitor
and focus continued attention on
the need for future progress and
I'll be a spokesman and advocate
for further public school improve
ments. It's up to all of us to
gether."
Bush said the most promising
reform may be public school choice
— the subject of the workshop.
In choice projects around the na
tion, parents are being given
latitude in selecting which school

their children will attend.
"Too often today it is our dis
advantaged children who are most
likely to be burdened by inade
quate public education," Bush
said. "For this reason alone, for
the benefit of the empowerment
that it promises to our disadvan
taged kids, our disadvantaged
citizens, further expansion of
public school choice is a national
imperative."
Supporters of the choice concept
say it makes schools more com
petitive and responsive, improves
morale and attendance, reduces
disciplinary problems and

dropouts, and improves learning
among students.
"With some safeguards, public
school choice is an excellent pro
gram and ought to be supported,"
said Albert Shanker, president of
the American Federation of
Teachers.
"1 didn't hear anything about
vouchers or tuition tax credits and
those would be the red flags for
us," said Mary Futrell, president
of the National Education Asso
ciation. The concept of choice
"does have potential. We are
cautiously optimistic about what
we're hearing."
