# Bank to pay $14M in bias case
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - One of
the nation's largest banks agreed
yesterday to pay a record $14 mil
lion in back pay to women and
minorities it employed from 1973
to 1988, but refused to concede
that it had discriminated.
Harris Trust and Savings Bank
of Chicago, 40th among the na
tion's bank in assets last year,
said it was agreeing to settle
charges originally filed by the
Labor Department in 1977 to
avoid "more legal and statistical
wrangling." A Chicago group that
had supported the government's
complaint said up to 5,000 people
could share in the award.
Under the agreement, Harris
Trust must revise its affirmative

action policies, set up training
programs for women and minor
ities seeking promotions to pro
fessional and managerial posts,
and tell the department periodi
cally over the next three years
how well it is complying with the
agreement and anti-discrim
ination laws.
The agreement did not set any
quotas or goals for the bank to
meet.
The settlement brings to a close
a case that dates to 1977 and
tested a presidential order
prohibiting federal contractors
from discriminating against mi
norities and women in their
hiring, promotion and wage poli
cies.

The Labor Department charged
that Harris Trust was dis
criminating by promoting white
men at a significantly higher rate
than women and minorities with
comparable skills and was paying
the white men more for compa
rable work.
Four years later, a Labor De
partment administrative law
judge, Nahum Litt, ruled that
Harris Trust had discriminated
against women and minorities in
a number of areas. The judge
awarded $12.2 million in back pay.
The settlement announced yes
terday expanded that time frame
to cover women and minorities in
the bank's employ at any time
from May 1973 to December 1988.
