Giuliani to quit U.S. attorney job
NEW YORK (AP) — In a five-year, publicity
drenched reign as U.S. attorney for Manhattan,
Kudolph Giuliani has been compared with Eliot
Ness, Thomas Dewey, Joe DiMaggio and
Savonarola.
Yesterday he announced his resignation,
leaving New Yorkers to speculate whether he
will run for mayor and earn comparisons with
another diminutive Italian American who ran as
a reformer — Fiorello LaGuardia.
Mayor Edward Koch, entering the last year of
his third term, praised Giuliani as a "superb
prosecutor;" pointedly, he wished Giuliani well
in his future endeavors "in the private sector."
Giuliani, 44, said yesterday he had "not shut
the door on running for mayor" or any other
office, though he held out the possibility that he

would go into private practice as a lawyer.
But Giuliani is in a perfect position to run.
Mexican union leader arrested
MEXICO CITY (AP) — Soldiers stormed the
fortified home of the oil workers' union chief
yesterday, fought a gun battle and arrested him
and 17 other leaders of the nation's strongest
and allegedly most corrupt union, officials said.
A federal agent was killed in the gunfight be
tween security forces and Joaquin Hernandez
Galicia's bodyguards in the oil city of Ciudad
Madero in northeastern Mexico, said a statement
from the attorney general's office.
The Mexican Labor Federation protested the
arrest, and workers left their jobs at Pemex in
stallations in the Tampico-Ciudad Madero area
in the northeast.
