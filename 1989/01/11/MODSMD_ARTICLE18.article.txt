## With an open mind 
### 
Modern interpretations
of classic texts lead
to broader horizons

ON DEC. 22, The Wall Street
Journal published a scath
ing criticism of Stanford's
decision to modify the focus of
many Area One requirement
tracks.
The Journal editors pointed to
changes in this year's experimental
Culture, Ideas and Values track
"Europe and the Americas" and
implied that we are all experiencing
a closing of the Stanford mind,
whatever that may be.
While discussing the rein
terpretation of "classic" texts to
address modern problems, a proc
ess which they describe as
"deconstruction," the Journal
editors said: "We await the lecture
that interprets Marx (still re
quired) through the work of
Groucho and Harpo."
In a somewhat less amusing
manner, Asst. Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies Charles Junkerman
valiantly defended the CIV pro
gram in a letter published in The
Journal on Jan. 6. Unfortunately,
he sunk to The Journal's level of
criticism by stating that he
doubted that the Journal editors
had read any of the new texts with
which they took issue.
It seems pointless for individuals

on both sides of this argument to
point to their bookshelves and
proudly claim their self-worth
based upon the titles there.
Just because CIV professors are
interpreting "classic" texts in new
ways, that does not necessarily
mean that students will be com
pletely deprived of conventional in
terpretations of those texts. Since
those kinds of interpretations are
"the way these books should be
read," it seems that these ideas
would become obvious to students
as they read the texts themselves.
Furthermore, it seems the idea
the CIV track is challenging is the
notion that "conventional" inter
pretations are somehow "more
right" or necessary to education
than more modern readings which
are sensitive to the realities of our
multi-cultural society.
An Area One requirement based
solely on traditional readings of
"classic" texts from which our so
ciety developed would only encour
age students to accept the already
established norms in our culture.
It would not challenge them to
question and criticize the world
around them.
We must continue to experiment
and explore new ideas, like CIV.
Our world is continually changing
and we must change with it, even
if that means modifying time
honored monoliths such as the
Western Culture canon.
If there is such a thing as the
"Stanford mind," it certainly isn't
closing.
