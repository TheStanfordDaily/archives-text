## On the slopes: No mercy 
### 
I FREELY ADMIT that I'm not the
best skier in the world. You could
say that I'm not good at all, but that
might be a little unfair.
But this winter I decided to become
an expert skier. So I. called up some
friends and told them of my plans to
become one with the mountain.
They invited me to join them on their
treks to the local southern California
resorts but cautioned that they only skied
the more difficult runs. I said fine, be
cause that would make me improve
faster.
The first important step is to get geared
up for the trip. And it is here that many
novice skiers make their biggest mis
takes. If I could offer just two pieces of
advice.
One: if you rent, don't do it at the
resort; not Only is it tvfice as expensive,
it takes twice as long. Two: for roughly
the same reason, buy lift tickets at Tick
etron well in advance. Having learned
these lessons the old-fashioned way, I
was prepared well in advance.
We were to go on the 26th. After Christ
mas dinner I received a call from the
person driving. He said be ready by 4:30.
In the morning.
Under normal circumstances I would
have hung up right there. But this was
different. I was to conquer a mountain.
I could sacrifice for that.
It would not surprise me to find out
that the day after Christmas is the
busiest ski day of the year. The line of
cars was interminable.
Luckily, the conversation was good. It
seems that one guy had gone through a

difficult time. His parents were supposed
to return from Palm Springs that day,
but he was convinced that they would
not because he had dreamed their deaths.
The thought obsessed him the entire
morning. "And you know the worst part,"
he went on, "all I could think of was
that I'd finally get my own car, and
maybe some money."
I turned and suggested he get his urine
sampled.
By the time we got there, it was 8:30
a.m. We immediately got in line for the
lift to the top. Everyone agreed that we'd
start off kind of mild, so the first time
down we opted for all the intermediate
runs.
I felt a little rusty, but good. I thought
I was turning rather nicely. When we got
to the bottom, I made sure everyone
knew that I'd only been skiing a few
times. They seemed unimpressed.
We had warmed up enough, they
decided. On to incredible steepness and
moguls! I tried psyching myself up. You
know, picturing myself going down with
perfect technique. . . .
It didn't start off horribly. Sure, I ate
it one or two times, but other than that
I was keeping up.
Then we were coming to the bottom
of the run and I was starting to get out
of control. Another guy was right behind
me. He told me to jump the mogul at
the bottom of the hill. It didn't look so
bad. What the hell.
Those are the last words of a perfect
fool. Oh, I went over all right and then
I landed. But unfortunately, the guy be
hind me was still in the air and his skis

caught my back. He went right over me,
and I went straight into the ground.
Really a bad scene. The people in the
chairlift above us didn't think so; they
were laughing. Ha ha ha.
The rest of the day was marred by this
one tragic accident. I had been rudely
humbled by both moutain and man.
From that point on I started skiing
with a new perspective. I was wary of
all around me. And I noticed something*
everytime somebody else fell, I felt a'
little better. I guess that's the rec skiers
mentality. Live and let die.
This kind of attitude might not do
much for world peace, but it's nice to go
by someone splayed on the ground and
know you're not the one eating snow and
being laughed at.
After a long drive home where barely
a word was mentioned, I made my two
New Year's resolution. In 1989, I resolve
to be rude. It's good for the soul.
I also resolve to consider purchasing
my own skis. If those rentals had been
waxed properly, none of this would have
happened.
