## Review's report not complimentary, but accurate 
### 
IN HIS LETTER to The Daily (Jan.
9), Anthropology Prof. Renato
Rosaldo combines half-truths with
outright lies to slander the Stanford
Review.
By labelling our reporters "unprofes
sional," Rosaldo sidesteps some of the
concerns raised in the Review's article
about the lack of intellectual integrity
in his "Europe and the Americas"
track.
For the record, let me clear up
several points. While it is true that a
reporter spoke to Rosaldo "after the
story was largely written," this was
only to elaborate on several issues
from the more extensive first interview
â€” which was conducted well before
anything had been written.
Details about the contents of "Eu
rope and the Americas" were gathered
from the course syllabus, the more

elaborate course description (which is
submitted to the Dean of Undergradu
ate Studies), and a number of students
in the course. The resemblance be
tween the article and the course was
not "accidental," but the result of a
thorough investigative process.
And, for that matter, Paul Gigot, an
editor for the Wall Street Journal,
independently investigated Rosaldo's
course; his piece ("The Stanford
Mind," The Wall Street Journal, Dec.
22, 1988) echoed many of the concerns
in the Review article.
But then again, all of Rosaldo's
charges are little more than a
smokescreen for him (and his course)
to hide behind. In his vicious, ad
hominem letter, Rosaldo does not
discuss the contents of his class.
He does not discuss any of the

"auspicious" writers covered in "Eu
rope and the Americas," such as
Rigoberta Menchu (a Guatemalan
communist) and Frantz Fanon (who
urged the killing of white people en
masse).
He does not discuss how his track
"deconstructs" some of the classics,
reading Shakespeare's Tempest as a
case study in imperialism and the book
of Genesis under the rubric of "making
other cultural selves."
He does not discuss the fact that his
track consists of little more than a
collection of marginal left-wing writers,
whose only unifying thread lies in their
passionate hatred of the West.
The Stanford Review piece may not
have been overly complimentary, but
we believe that truth is a complete
defense. And instead of whining about
"verbal mugging," Rosaldo would do

better to present a rational and
coherent justification (although we
rather doubt that any can be given) for
the "Europe and the Americas" track.
Now Rosaldo would like to end
ASSU funding of the Stanford Review,
and have the University take "stronger
measures," although we're not entirely
sure what he has in mind (Close down
the Stanford Review? Expel writers for
accurate reporting? Have a paper
burning in White Plaza?).
Such intolerance for opposing views
is certainly not expected from someone
like Rosaldo. It is far more unexpected,
and disturbing, that a university of
Stanford's stature would dignify this
demagogue with a platform from which
to spout such drivel.
