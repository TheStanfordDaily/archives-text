# Review of moms in movies champions unfair stereotypes
## 
### 
I read with extreme annoyance Alex
Kostich's reviews of the movies "A Cry
in the Dark," "The Good Mother" and
"Madame Sousatzka" (Daily, Dec. 2).
The fact that he chose to confine his
review to a discussion of whether the
women in each of these movies is, in
fact, a good mother seems somewhat
baffling, but more disturbing is his
implied view of what makes a good
mother.
He claims, for instance, that Anna
Dunlop of "The Good Mother" is "too
much of a softie" with her daughter
because, among other reasons, she does
not reprimand her daughter for spilling

milk.
He goes on to say that "While a
good mother should not slap her child
for such behavior (children will be
children), a reprimand would ensure in
the child's mind that spilling milk
(etc.) is not acceptable, whether by
accident or on purpose." Is he serious?
A reprimand for accidentally spilling
milk?
He says of Lindy Chamberlain in "A
Cry in the Dark": "The fact that she
left her daughter alone in a tent is
reason enough to deem her a bad
mother — a woman with such a young
child should not be so careless."
Granted that this was a mistake
(and a tragic one in this case), is it
enough to brand a woman with the
label of "bad mother?" This logic
reminds me of the pit bull owner who
blamed the parents of the child his dog
killed for not keeping a closer eye on
the child.

On the other hand, the most impor
tant reason for Madame Sousatzka
being a good mother, according to Kos
tich, is that she "sacrifices her own
happiness for the sake of her student."
By these standards, no wonder the
other women fare so badly.
While at least two of the movies, "A
Cry in the Dark," and"The Good
Mother," are meant to question soci
ety's expectations of mothers, Kostich,
ironically ends up championing some of
the most stereotyped, idealized notions
of motherhood. He blasts Lindy Cham
berlain for being "cold" and "unemo
tional," for example.
The implication that a good mother
is always willing to sacrifice her own
happiness for her child is also ques
tionable, to say the least. Does society
expect the same self-sacrifice from
fathers?
