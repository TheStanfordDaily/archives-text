# Prof. Cohn stands by critique of CIV
## 
### 
I stand by my critique of the "Eu
rope and Americas" track (fall quarter)
and wouldn't dream of apologizing
anymore than would all those well
known journalists who have laced into
it, with comparable tartness.
The expression "with knives in their
teeth" is not racist in my mind; I
learned it from the French, who use it,
amusedly, for desperate revolutionaries
generally. Fanon is clearly one of them.
My remark about how the Great
Books would be likely treated in such a
course is not an insult to Prof.
Rosaldo's capacity — I know nothing
of that — but rather a reasonable
assessment of the drift of the course.
