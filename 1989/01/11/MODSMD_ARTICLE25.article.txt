## Feigned acceptance of gays is toughest barrier to break through 
### 
Members of the dominant
culture rarely recognize the
specifics of their own oppression.
For example, left-handed people can
list numerous manifestations of our so
ciety's right-orientation that right
handed people don't generally notice.
Thus, minorities face the difficult chal
lenge of trying to raise awareness in an
environment that strongly favors ignor
ance.
To understand what it's like to be part
of such a minority, imagine traveling back
in time with your friends to discuss with
Galileo how to convince people that the
Earth rotates around the Sun. It seems
perfectly c'ear to all of you, which only
strengthens your group's sense of convic
tion. Yet when you try to explain it to
others, they call you lunatics and
heretics. As a result, you spend much of
your time strategizing about how best to
express your beliefs to others.
John Abbott, author of an antigay piece
in the December Stanford Review,
stumbled upon such a discussion last Oc
tober on the gay "board" (an electronic
bulletin board available on campus com
puters) focusing on racism and the defac
ing of posters in Ujamaa House.
I argued that because racism and ho
mophobia are beliefs and not actions, they,
should not be automatic Fundamental
Standard violations. Furthermore, 1
argued that when the eviction of Kenny
Ehrman last spring for repeated abusive
behavior (much of it homophobic)
prompted some fraternity members to
stand outside Otero wearing ski masks,
their expression of anger was also not a

violation of the Fundamental Standard
because protest does not constitute har
rassment.
But Abbott missed my point. I com
plained that the gay community's case
is not compelling when we magnify a
small number of particulars, giving them
an inflated importance that even we know
is inappropriate.
This lack of evidence is typical of the
plateau all civil rights movements encoun
ter at the frustrating stage of, "Some of
my best friends are 1 adjective)." I often
see Stanford students fall back on this
kind of superficial politeness in casual
friendships, especially when they become
nervous because a friend is gay.
This feigned acceptance is difficult and
often painful to break through because,
contrary to popular myth, most gay
people don't enjoy confronting and up
setting nongay friends. Thus, gay stu
dents hide their identity while skating on
this thin layer of tolerance-without
understanding, learning to live with the
resulting abuse. This creates a viscous
circle where nongay people abuse their
gay friends (often unknowingly), gay
people play it safe and remain quiet, and
the administration sees nothing but har
mony and good will.
My advice was to bring the antigay
feelings to the surface to show the ad
ministration how Stanford's atmosphere
oppresses young gays. Although such ac
tions require more determination and
courage, I suggested to the energetic
young radicals in our community, they
are a better use of time and energy and
produce a more effective explanation of

our concerns.
Abbott interpreted my advice as a call
to "incite homophobic incidents." The sad
truth is that gay people do so just by
expressing their natural feelings. The mo
ment gay people reject the etiquette of
polite superficiality, they make nongay
people uncomfortable by challenging
them to notice the oppression they are
so blissfully ignorant of.
Let me elaborate with examples from
the time I spent as a Stanford graduate
student:
• Holding hands with a male date while
walking back from the flicks left us an
island in the crowd, surrounded by a
bubble of space, as if such close proximity

of two gay men formed a powerful magnet
that switched on whenever we touched,
repelling any surrounding nongay people
like magnets of opposite polarity.
• The one time I loosened up at Encina
Gym and greeted another gay student
with a hug, the incessant clanking of
metal plates and intermittent groaning
of power-lifters suddenly ceased as all
eyes turned to us, just like an E.F. Hutton
commercial.
• During my years as a Bridge coun
selor, especially my nine months as a
live-in, I spent so much time working
through the problems of gay fraternity
members, football players, Republicans,
and Christians, that I became keenly

aware of the tremendous pressure on gay
students to deny their true feelings.
• I was asked to leave the Beta Nooner
for dancing with a man (who, ironically,
was not gay, just a progressive fellow
counselor who agreed that our taboo
against male/male dancing is silly).
• Because I wanted to nudge one of
my regular counselees into a gay support
group, I found the courage to appraoch
his conservative fraternity, the Theta
Delts, forcing me to endure the embar
rassment of being asked to leave because
"nobody [here] is interested" in the fliers
I intended to place on their dining tables.
Perhaps Stanford has improved in the
six years since, but my guess is that
things are even worse. A notable change,
for example, is the emergence of enough
eager beaver conservatives to spawn the
caustic Stanford Review.
So despite the encouraging words of
the Beta's current president and despite
the Review's diction that tries to paint
me and my advice as radical, I hope the
community recognizes the simple truth
that Stanford University is not a
hospitable environment for gay people,
particularly the housed fraternities and
varsity teams, and that as a result, when
ever members of our community find the
strength to stand up for simple human
rights, we end up "inciting incidents"
among the John Abbott's of the world.
Let's just hope that we can manage to
educate some of them before they grad
uate.
