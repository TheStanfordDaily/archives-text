## William Chace: Considering ethics and a women's frat 
### Susan McKean Editorial staff 
Editor's note: This is the second
of a two-part series highlighting
segments of an interview with
former Stanford English Prof,
and Vice Provost William Chace
last week in Middletown, Conn,
where he is currently president of
Wesleyan University.
After the formalities of intro
duction, handshaking and com
ments on my new California
induced vulnerability to the cold,
we sit down and Chace says, "So,
racism . . . this fall's word at Stan
ford?"
Chace, who has closely followed
Stanford's recent struggles with
charges of institutionalized rac
ism and the occurence of discrim
inatory incidents the past year,
now feels the immediacy of rac
ism's sword as he guides Wes
leyan, trying to maintain and en
hance the quality of a tradition
ally strong minority life.
Although Chace said Wesleyan
"fortunately" has escaped events
of manifest racism, he under
stands racism's lurking potential
that showed its ugly face at Stan
ford last year. "We know that such
things could happen; after all it
only takes one person — angry
or unhappy or twisted in some
way — to remind us of how close
racism really is."
On other fronts, however, Wes
leyan is feeling forces that still
remain in the earliest stages of
upheaval from long-time latency
at Stanford.
Frats and femininity failing?
Chace faces a residential pro
gram needing urgent attention,
particularly with regard to the
fraternity system that he says is
"in demise" and poses significant
contradictions to Wesleyan's com
mitment to coeducation.
"The five or six frat houses pre
dominantly placed in front of you
as you leave this building are all
male. They are a part of Wes
leyan's past — when it was all
male and 80 percent of the stu
dents were members of frats. Very
few now are members. (Fraterni
ties) create a problem about what

we are doing as a coeducational
institution."
Although Chace said the frater
nity issue finds a mixed reception
among students, he put the bur
den of proof on the frats them
selves to prove their worth and
defend their Wesleyan association.
"I think that the frats have a
clear duty now to persuade the
rest of the University — if they
can — that their values are con
sonant with the ideals of coeduca
tion."
The other half championed by
these ideals, the women, are also
finding new recognition at Wes
leyan. Womanists — the preferred
term there for advocates of wom
en's rights — reside in their own
theme house, similar to the
feminist studies house recently
proposed to Residential Education
at Stanford.
And Chace said he "found ex
traordinarily fascinating" a meet
ing this fall with a group of
women forming a so-called wom
en's fraternity when they con
ferred with him about securing
housing for their group.
"They feel that at many Amer
ican universities and colleges,
being feminine has been
derogated, has been criticized.
Among the complaints they have
had at Wesleyan, which they feel
are true elsewhere as well, is that
if they wear make-up or skirts or
so forth, they are vilified. And
they believe that those are things
women can do if they so wish."
More threatening than this
slander, charges of sexual harass
ment and rape — both on campus
in the recent past and as a nation
wide problem — have grabbed
Wesleyan's attention and won
Chace's commitment to providing
a safe and respectful environment
for women and men on campus.
Two years ago, Wesleyan
writhed with allegations of active
sexual harassment and rape on
campus. Students disrupted Uni
versity tours, decrying the admin
istration's alleged disregard to the
charges, Chace said.
Since then the protests have
abated, although there have been
allegations of fraternities sexually
harassing, but not raping, women

students this fall. Chace said an
investigation is presently under
way.
'Expects' full divestment
Another area about which
Chace spoke with evident concern
and enthusiasm, and which
likewise pertains to Stanford, was
the issue of divestment. Chace
asserts that Wesleyan has a record
"more progressive than Stan
ford," currently holding stock in
five companies with operations in
South Africa. Since last spring,
the Wesleyan Board of Trustees
trimmed these direct investments
down from 15 to the few now
remaining under close scrutiny,
according to Chace.
"My expectation — our [the
Trustees] presumption — is com
plete withdrawal," he said.
Chace views divestment as a
morally sound move that institu
tions caji make in solidarity with
other efforts to end apartheid, not
as a sacrifice acquitting institu
tions for all immoral investment.
"Our policy is not based on
whether or not our hands are
clean. We realize that any invest
ment in capitalism could in some
sense show that we are morally
contaminated. You can always
show without much trouble that
secondary or tertiary connections
exist so that your hands are not
wholly clean.
"Our test is whether or not our
actions are helping — in a very
long distant way — to end the
system of racial oppression."
Unlearning bigotry
At Stanford, this idea of
calibrating ideals and action has
been echoed in recent demands for
improved ethnic studies programs
and the institution of a full
fledged ethnic studies require
ment.
In the Wesleyan spirit of no
requirements, Chace opposed the
idea of a required ethnic studies
course, but advocated further de
velopment of ethnic studies pro
grams both at Stanford and Wes
leyan.
"1 am not a partisan to the idea
that ethnic studies should be a
required course I think

there are a good number of things
— if we're starting to list those
things that should be required —
that I would like to require. There
are other, equally pressing, dis
turbing areas that you would also
want to start mandating. Then
you have to. stop and take stock
and say 'Are we or are we not in
the business of mandating
courses;
Nonetheless, Chace credited
universities and colleges with the
ability to teach away bigoted be
havior, while voicing skepticism
about the efficacy and benefits of
taking on that responsibility.
"If you believe that universities
can teach, you are obliged to be
lieve that there are very few areas
they cannot touch; I don't think
(bigoted) behavior is immune to
the system. Universities can help
students unlearn (bigoted) behav
ior. But it is also quite true that
some forms of prejudice run very
deeply in people."
Chace said, however, the proc
ess of unlearning prejudice is not
something that universities
should teach methodically or in
stitutionally in the way they teach
the scientific method, for instance.
"Universities shy away from
the explicit teaching or indoctrina
tion of moral behavior.
"It used to be that we were
here to teach you how to be a
Christian person. And there were
ideals, and we had models and
you lived up to them and you
were OK. We do not do that any
more.
"I think most moral teaching
is indirect; it is inferential. You
might read a play by Shakespeare
and decide, not because Ron Reb
holz tells you so, but you might
decide being an lago (the 'Othello'
scoundrell is not good.
"But Prof. Rebholz does not say,
'Class, let me tell you the follow
ing 15 ways lago is bad. And, I
do not want you to be like lago.'
You just do not do that. Univer
sities are not in the business of
moral indoctrination. They got
out of that business in this cen
tury, and I think they are teaching
on a much more objective
footing."
Yet regardless of the responsi

bility assumed by universities for
molding the actions of their stu
dents, incidents of bigoted behav
ior do arise and challenge the
strength and limits of the insti
tution's moral code — as Stanford
and Chace know. He commented
on the precarious balancing of
ethics and logistics at universities.
"Everybody knows — but then
no one knows how to implement
it — that there should be some
basic, common currency about
what is expected of a person in
the community.
"And everybody knows that
going to a Stanford or a Wesleyan
is an extraordinary undertaking,
it's not like getting on a bus.
There are higher standards of be
havior and moral scrupulosity and
respect for others than you would
assume would prevail for the gen
eral public.
"But then you get into the very
dicey question of saying 'You may
not say the following things about
the following people.' Finally, it
ends up being ridiculous. It's ex
tremely hard to list all of the
things that you may or may not
say about specified groups.

"Behavior that over time is
manifestly meant to wound and
derogate other people is some
thing that can be disciplined. I
don't think that Stanford . . .
would even be able to manage a
system in which if someone were
to say "nigger" then the whole
institution would land on that
person and say 'That is one of
the words we just do not say.'
"The system would last maybe
three days and after that people
would either laugh it away, or the
circuit would be overloaded,"
Chace said.
As the cold afternoon froze into
evening outside his ivory office,
Chace sent Stanford his warmest
regards. He voiced happiness that
the continuing education program
he helped establish was thriving,
and in typical form, said, "I follow
with continuing fascination the
long saga of CIV."
He wished that a tale of a deed
should be told of a deed not by
him should by him not be told."
— "Ulysses," by James Joyce
And so, the tale of Chace's
deeds is told.

Former English Prof. William Chace says he continues to follow
the long saga of CIV' from his new post as president of Wesleyan
University. Here, in a picture from The Daily's April Fools' Day
issue last year, he made the saga even longer as he filibustered
the Faculty Senate.
