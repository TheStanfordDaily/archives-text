# Reflections on Racial Understanding
## 
### Donald Kennedy 
In a meeting at Ujamaa on October 17,1 was urged by several stu
dents to write a "thoughtful paper" on the issues raised by racial inci
dents here and in other campus communities. I am glad to comply,
in the interest of setting out my own views and encouraging a more
thorough discussion of these matters at Stanford.
There is, of course, more than a hint of presumption in following up
on an invitation to be "thoughtful". It can be a daunting temptation to
failure, like the instruction to "be funny". Moreover, the theme itself is
so difficult, and so subject to divergent perceptions depending on
one's own background and cultural perspective, that no discussion of
it is likely to strike everyone as thoughtful.
Nevertheless there are some clear objectives to begin with. What
do we seek at Stanford? A pretty good summary, I think, would be
this: A residential academic community of young men and women
who are committed to serious intellectual purposes, and who are en
gaged actively in self-realization and in the support of one another.
Our educational mission is achieved partly through a student residen
tial community in which intellectual development is enhanced by prac
tical experiences that help form views about what human societies are
like, how they came to be, and how they can be improved. That, at
least, is the hope. In the process of making residential life work,
various visions are offered and adopted, or cast away; the relation
ships formed and the discussions undertaken in this context share
importance with the curriculum. That is one reason we devote sub
stantial resources to representing in our student body the full spec
trum of ethnic, cultural, regional and economic diversity that
characterizes contemporary American society.
In creating that community we have undertaken a formidable task.
We are asking young people to ignore the habits of comfort, and to
seek out others with whom they are unfamiliar and sometimes ill at
ease. We are exposing them and ourselves to the risk of misun
derstanding and even, when sensitivities are violated as they occa
sionally will be, hostility. But we think it is nevertheless worth the risk,
because we are among the few places in this country in which it may
be possible to test the workability of the multicultural existence that
will, ready or not, be the life of Californians and eventually all Ameri
cans in the twenty-first century. To that pathfinding task we at Stanford
bring a number of advantages: the choice to be here has been volun
tary, there is an abundance of intelligence and good will, and we are
engaged in a common enterprise that goes well beyond merely living
together. If, with all these advantages, we cannot form a successful
multicultural society, then it is hard to be very optimistic that one can
be built without them.
Yet even with them, the degree of difficulty is great — as we have
been discovering. And our occasional failures raise important ques
tions for us. How can we better prepare Stanford students to live with
sensitivity and understanding in such communities? What is the role
and responsibility of the institution, of its faculty, and of the residential
communities themselves? How do we manage our occasional but in
evitable disappointments, and guarantee that we can persevere
despite them? The following reflections are not an effort to establish
policy or even to guide in its development. Instead, I hope they may
illuminate some of these questions, and thus help us to launch a dis
cussion about our opportunities here and about our obligations to one
another.
At the outset, we need to be clear about our objective with respect
to relations among the races. Is it to permit a casual separatism to
exist, in which there is tolerance but only minimal interaction? Is it to
encourage fuller integration? Do we value the retention of identity, or
do we aim instead toward homogenization? These goals are often
expressed in polar form, as though they were choices without inter
mediates. I believe, to the contrary, that we can retain the values of
ethnic identity and, at the same time, promote a vigorous interplay
among the various minority cultures and the (transiently!) majority cul
ture. To insist either on full enclave status for ethnic theme houses, or
that minority students be dispersed at random, will not achieve that
balance. Creative experimentation with intermediates is, in my judg
ment, more promising.
If Stanford continues along that course, we shall find ourselves ex
perimenting even more with environments that demand a good deal
by way of understanding human differences. They will continue to
raise some of the questions I alluded to earlier, so I repeat them in
different words: How can we strengthen the capacity of our commu
nity to encourage exploration and to treat matters of race in a sensitive
and understanding way? How can we learn the vocabularies and the
behavior of mutual respect? And how can we prepare ourselves to
deal with the difficulties and discouragements that will inevitably arise?
Because we are an educational institution and because it makes
sense to begin with what you do best, we can make cultural differ
ences an important part of what we teach. What I have in mind is
rather different from the changes recently made in the design of the

requirement in Culture, Ideas, and Values, and different also from the
requirement in Non-Western Culture. We need to make contributions
and the experiences of ethnic and religious minorities part of a whole
variety of courses that deal, in one way or another, with contemporary
society. Perhaps the effort can be concentrated first on a few courses
with large enrollments; but eventually it should reach across the cur
riculum. Dean of Undergraduate Studies Tom Wasow and his col
leagues are now giving consideration to the kinds of course
development that will be required.
The success of that model, of course, will depend in part on whether
we succeed in other areas. An extension of our efforts to teach about
the contributions and experiences of minorities surely will require more
minority faculty and other teaching staff than we now have. Their
recruitment, already a high priority at Stanford, will never be as suc
cessful as we hope unless we, along with other institutions like us, can
improve the availability of minority doctoral candidates for the aca
demic disciplines. Various programs, including several supported by
the recent grant from the Irvine Foundation, are now aimed at that
objective.
And of course there are other activities in this community that reg
ularly afford opportunities for building understanding. Commitment to
cultural activities, or the performing arts, or journalism, or to athletics
throws us into relationships in which common objectives submerge
and often conquer differences that in other settings may divide us.
Wherever powerful purpose dominates process, human interactions
tend to go better. So activities frc;n Ram's Head to varsity soccer, from
the Daily to the Stanford Symphony, offer recurrent and refreshing
examples of multicultural success.
In all these aspects of our existence — academic, extracurricular,
residential — our success has bred high expectations. Wherever dis
appointment follows, the reaction is painful, often bordering on grief.
So we need to ask ourselves hard questions about our own vul
nerability. Can the prospets of curricular enrichment, better manage
ment of our collective lives outside the classroom, all the other things
we have talked about — can these remedies offer us immunity to
incidents like the one at Ujamaa?
I think we should not expect too much. Curricular change can
broaden and deepen our understanding of difference, and of the ways
in which diversity has historically invigorated our society. It can cer
tainly remove areas of ignorance that now promote misunderstanding.
But it cannot fully protect this community, or any other, from occa
sional expressions of insensitivity or downright intolerance. "Ignorance
is no excuse" became a well-worn phrase in the aftermath of the
Ujamaa incident. That statement is true, yet unhelpful: some ignor
ance will survive even the best efforts at education, and it will escape
in troublesome form whether we excuse It or not. Moreover, we are
an open community that is characterized by rapid change, poor insti
tutional memory, and a willingness to embrace new members at a
moment's notice. It follows that some of us will always be unac
quainted with the values shared by most people at Stanford. That
should not discourage us.
It is worth emphasizing, in this connection, that we are dealing with
a broad array of challenges and not just with affronts to the black com
munity. Here and elsewhere, there have been counter-reactions
against whites which, however understandable they may be, nonethe
less represent a form of racism themselves. There has been a disturb
ing increase in the number of anti-Semitic expressions at universities,
Stanford included. If we are to be consistent we must hold all such
forms of expression to be equally unacceptable.
But what does it mean, exactly, to say that some form of expression
is unacceptable? If what we mean is that most members of the com
munity will deplore it, that leaders will speak out against it, and that
those responsible will be urged to change, that is one thing. It is quite
another once we begin to talk about sanctions: dismissal or suspen
sion from the university, loss of the residential privilege, or whatever.
Withdrawal of membership in the community is a penalty that requires
due process and a carefully worked out balancing between the com
munity's need for tolerance and good order and the individual's right
to free expression. Freedom of speech is a powerful tradition in our
society, and nowhere does it have greater or more special power than
in universities, where unconventional and heterodox ideas are the very
breath of life. I had thought that was well understood here, so I was
surprised by how many members of the community were prepared to
urge the swift and arbitrary application of sanctions in the Ujamaa
case. Even now, there has been too little attention to the counterposed
value of free expression.
Because we cannot hope that education is the answer for every
thing in this open and dynamic community, because intolerance and
insensitivity can take so many forms, and because other values so
often intervene in the treatment of racial matters, It is essential that we
prepare ourselves to endure occasional failure without losing confi
dence.

I have two observations to make about that.
First, we need to remember that the best will in the world doesn't
solve all the problems. I have observed a tendency here to search
quickly, in the aftermath of each disappointment, for a place to affix
blame. More often than not, it is "the institution," whatever that means;
and the administration is frequently asked to provide the remedy. But
Stanford is many people and many entities: freshmen, sophomores,
juniors, seniors, graduate students; a faculty; deans of schools and of
student affairs; workers; resident fellows and RA's; administrative staff;
and so on. Some remedies are to be sought in one place, some int
another. Some, perhaps the majority, are really the responsibility ot
the sub-community in which the offense took place. Beyond the ques
tion of where remedial action lies, I find a little too much self-blame in
our reactions, and I hope we can keep it under control. To take (or
assign) realistic responsibility makes sense. To encourage a cult of
culpability does not; it merely makes people who need to be part of
the solution feel like part of the problem. We have accomplished much
at Stanford, and we ought to be proud of that. When we experience
reversals we should grit our teeth and move ahead, without elaborate
mortification.
Second, we need to acknowledge the feelings of hurt and anger
that are often the result of bigotry or insensitivtty. In the immediate
aftermath of the Ujamaa incidents, residents told me that they fre
quently encountered the reaction "Why were you guys so upset over
that? Was it really such a big deal?"
This problem is a very important one; and although it is the result
of a racial incident its solution has little to do with race or cultural un
derstanding and everything to do with sensitivity and human under
standing. It does no good at all to ask people who are hurt to justify
their feelings; it amounts to telling them they aren't entitled to those
feelings, instead of according them recognition and respect. The
healing process begins with acknowledgment, and the offer of help
that is the first instinct of friendship. In my orientation talk to the fresh
men this year, I tried to make the point that we may have gotten so
absorbed with diversity that we have forgotten our common humanity.
It is still true that the safest ground for the exploration of difference is
that common bond of family.
Now I want to describe two tendencies that I believe threaten our
success in achieving better racial understanding.
The first is commonly called "backlash." It may be useful to distin
guish between two forms. The first, which might be called hard back
lash, comes mainly from those who are seizing the racism-on-campus
issue as an opportunity to advance the view that too much has already
been done for minorities. It has tones of bitterness and anger, and It
can be deeply disturbing. But it is not hard to recognize, and even
easier to reject. Thus it poses a far less serious threat than a softer,
subtler form of backlash: the disaffection of those who have believed
in and have fought for equal opportunity and full minority participation.
Too many of them, I fear, are concluding that they aren't wanted, and
that they should expend their energies for social improvement in other
ways. That would be a tragedy; we need them, and we won't have
them unless, as I said earlier, they can be made to feel part of the
solution instead of treated as part of the problem.
That relates closely to the second threat. Time and again we have
seen the promotion of racial understanding linked to a more focused
— and less broadly understood and accepted — political agenda.
That kind of load is probably too heavy for a delicate structure to bear
all at once. This fall, for example, some entering students who would
have been ready to commit themselves enthusiastically to new cultural
understandings were turned off by the advice that they adopt, along
with them, positions on everything from a complex local labor negoti
ation to the national election. Nothing, to be sure, can be entirely free
of politics; but too much is too much. Nor is it readily understandable
to many students why racial incidents are so frequently followed by
demands that bear little relation to the circumstances or the environ
ments in which the incidents took place. Freeing our goal of racial
understanding from this heavy political weight would, I think, make it
easier to achieve — and also reduce the possibility of backlash.
Much more could be said, obviously, on all of these topics. I trust it
will, because this is a dialogue that should engage this community on
a continuing basis if we are to make the progress we need and want.
What I hope we shall have, if that progress is forthcoming, is a mature
multicultural community characterized by a kind of robustness as well
as by sensitivity. What do I mean? I mean that it will not only be a
caring, constructive, learning society, but also one with the confidence
and strength to withstand, and then to progress beyond, the infre
quent but inevitable lapses it will experience. We are clearly not there
yet, but it is an objective we can attain — and in doing so, give others
a glimpse of what the future can be like.
