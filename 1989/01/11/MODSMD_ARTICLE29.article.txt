A lot of people heard the recent No. 1 smash
hit "Baby I Love Your Way/Freebird Medley" by
recording artists Will To Power, and were won
dering just who are Will To Power?
They are: saxaphonist Dr. J, vocalist Suzi
Carr and (we quote from the press material)
"main man" Bob Rosenberg. Rosenberg, who
holds the early lead in the 1989 "Gotta Get
that 70's Look" contest, is the composer of
their next single, "Fading Away," remixed by
Shep Pettibone.
Both previous singles from their album,
"Dreamin'" and "Say it's Gonna Rain," went to
No. 1 on the Billboard Dance Charts.
Maniac in the Mirror
Run, don't moonwalk, to the nearest video
store to get your copy of Michael Jackson's
new 94-minute kaleidoscope of never-before
seen song and dance numbers. Titled "Moon
walker," the video includes "Smooth Criminal,"
a 42-minute film about friendship, the confronta
tion between good and evil, and how to dress
really cool.
Also on the video are "Come Together" (the
Beatles classic) "Speed Demon" (Michael vs.
claymation) and "Badder" (a children's send-up
of "Bad").
Look for it in the "Horror" section of your
nearest video store.
