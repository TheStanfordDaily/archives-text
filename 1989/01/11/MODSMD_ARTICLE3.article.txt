# The
						Journal rips CIV track's books
## Officials say attack may hurt fundraising 
### Amy Kosenfeld Senior staff writer 
While dismissing a Dec. 22 ed
itorial in The Wall Street Journal
as inaccurate and misconstrued,
University professors and officials
yesterday speculated that the ar
ticle, which derides the new Cul
tures, Ideas and Values program,
could cause public relations and
fundraising problems.
Asst. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Charles Junkerman,
whose response to the editorial
was printed in The Journal Jan.
6, called it an "absolute mis
representation" of the changes
which have taken place in the
Area One requirement over the
past year.
According to Junkerman, The
Journal, "which regularly picks
up stories critical of [Stanford],"
is extremely influential because of
its broad readership across the
nation.
Many of these readers are Stan
ford alumni on whom the Univer
sity depends for contributions and
support, he added.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Thomas Wasow agreed with
Junkerman: "The Wall Street
Journal is for many people, in
cluding many of our more affluent
alumni, their primary source of
information, or in this case misin
formation."
Although Wasow said he agreed
with Junkerman's opinions, he
added that the letter was not an
official University response. The
University is planning to send a
response correcting the factual
mistakes later this week, he said.
The editorial could be "very
damaging to fundraising efforts,"
he added.
The University has "received a
lot of very angry letters all refer

ring specifically to The Wall
Street Journal editorial," Junker
man said.
However, Director of University
Relations Stephen Peeps said
large volumes of angry mail do
not necessarily translate into
decreased fundraising returns. He
said he has not seen any evidence
in terms of the past year's
returns, despite previous negative
editorials in The Journal.
The Dec. 22 editorial describes
CIV as "'deconstruction' â€”
reading texts not as inherently
worthy but to serve some profes
sor's private agenda."
It also refers to the themes of
race, gender and class as "the
main hobby-horses of today's po
litical left."
Other newspapers often pick up
Journal editorials and rewrite
them for their own editorial
pages, Junkerman said. He cited
a San Antonio Express editorial
which further misconstrued the
facts and described Zora Neale
Hurston, Rigoberta Menchu and
Sandra Cisneros as required au
thors on a new core list.
Junkerman said he wrote his
response because he found the ed
itorial "intolerant and offensive to
students and faculty of color." In
his letter, he accuses The Journal
of dismissing authors such as
Hurston and Menchu "solely on
the bases of their names."
According to English Prof. Mar
jorie Perloff, a member of the
Area One committee in charge of
overseeing the transition from
Western Culture to CIV, the ed
itorial further misrepresented CIV
by making it seem that the expe
rimental "Europe and the Amer
icas" track, which has 48 students,
is the only track available, not
