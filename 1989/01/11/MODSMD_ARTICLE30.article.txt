## Hellraiser II: Bound for gory 
### Mark Tompkins Staff writer 
It seems there's no getting away from Clive
Barker. There he was on MTV and "Entertainment
Tonight" this past vacation, talking about his new
movie "Hellhound: Hellraiser II" and looking deli
ciously pleased with himself.
He has good reason to be self-satisfied. In four
years Barker has unleashed a number of horror
novels and short stories which, in addition to placing
him on the bestseller lists, have earned him more
serious critical attention than poor old Stephen King.
Barker's talent for relentless self-promotion may
have something to do with this â€” sometimes it
seems like he can't write a single line without giving
an interview to explain the theory behind it.
Last year Barker wrote and directed his first
feature, "Hellraiser." Remember it? The ads
promised, "There are no limits," but a more com
promised movie would be hard to imagine.
The movie had a great premise: A jaded hedonist
named Frank, having exhausted all earthly
pleasures, begins to look for other-worldly ones. His
big mistake is that in his search for the ultimate
sexual pleasure he forgets that others could have
an entirely different idea of what pleasure is.
So far so good. Unfortunately the day is saved
rather unconvincingly when Frank's teenage niece
Kirsty thwarts the Cenobites, the spooky group of
S&M enthusiasts from another dimension, who are
tormenting Frank.
Cop-outs tend to be profitable in the movie busi
ness, and "Hellraiser" made enough money to war
rant a sequel. Its producers probably had the "Night
mare on Elm Street" series in mind, since each
Freddy movie makes more than the last one.
As it turns out, "Hellhound: Hellraiser II" is one
of those virtually unheard of cases where the sequel
is a big improvement over the original. Barker only
served as executive producer this time, but working
from his ideas director Tony Randel (see related
story) and writer Peter Atkins have created some
thing which seems far truer to Barker's sensibility
than the terminally lame "Hellraiser."
