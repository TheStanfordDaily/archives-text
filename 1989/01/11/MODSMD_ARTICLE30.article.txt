## Hellraiser II: Bound for gory 
### Mark Tompkins Staff writer 
It seems there's no getting away from Clive
Barker. There he was on MTV and "Entertainment
Tonight" this past vacation, talking about his new
movie "Hellhound: Hellraiser II" and looking deli
ciously pleased with himself.
He has good reason to be self-satisfied. In four
years Barker has unleashed a number of horror
novels and short stories which, in addition to placing
him on the bestseller lists, have earned him more
serious critical attention than poor old Stephen King.
Barker's talent for relentless self-promotion may
have something to do with this — sometimes it
seems like he can't write a single line without giving
an interview to explain the theory behind it.
Last year Barker wrote and directed his first
feature, "Hellraiser." Remember it? The ads
promised, "There are no limits," but a more com
promised movie would be hard to imagine.
The movie had a great premise: A jaded hedonist
named Frank, having exhausted all earthly
pleasures, begins to look for other-worldly ones. His
big mistake is that in his search for the ultimate
sexual pleasure he forgets that others could have
an entirely different idea of what pleasure is.
So far so good. Unfortunately the day is saved
rather unconvincingly when Frank's teenage niece
Kirsty thwarts the Cenobites, the spooky group of
S&M enthusiasts from another dimension, who are
tormenting Frank.
Cop-outs tend to be profitable in the movie busi
ness, and "Hellraiser" made enough money to war
rant a sequel. Its producers probably had the "Night
mare on Elm Street" series in mind, since each
Freddy movie makes more than the last one.
As it turns out, "Hellhound: Hellraiser II" is one
of those virtually unheard of cases where the sequel
is a big improvement over the original. Barker only
served as executive producer this time, but working
from his ideas director Tony Randel (see related
story) and writer Peter Atkins have created some
thing which seems far truer to Barker's sensibility
than the terminally lame "Hellraiser."

Doug Bradley returns as the world's only human pin cushion In
"Hellhound: Hellraiser II."
Picking up mere minutes after its predecessor
left off, "Hellhound" opens with Kirsty (Ashley
Laurence) being admitted to a mental institution.
She's in shock after her run-in with the Cenobites,
and no one believes her wild story, save for the
aloof institute director, Dr. Channard (Kenneth
Cranham).
Channard is a typical Barker character: For him,
Hell is only a choice away. His lifelong fascination
with perversion and aberrant states of mind make
him willing to meet Hell halfway. Channard has
turned his mental asylum into a replica of Hell on
earth, as preparation for the real thing.
Also entrusted into Channard's care is Tiffany
(Imogen Boorman), an innocent girl apparently ren
dered autistic by some past trauma (perhaps seeing
Rain Man). Channard hopes that her skill at solving
puzzles will unlock the gateway into the Cenobite's
dimension.
But the real puzzle for Channard is that of his
own psyche, as he fits the darkest pieces into place.
The realm of the Cenobites, he discovers, is a Hell
whose function is less damnation than a perverse
self-actualization; it's where he can most fully be
come himself.
Kirsty, of course, ends up following Channard
into a labyrinthine dungeon mazeworld, in order to
save Tiffany. In Barker's fiction, characters don't
have an afterlife but an afterdeath, and so the
characters who bought it last time reappear.
Kirsty's stepmother Julia (Claire Higgins),
voracity on two legs, comes back as, does Uncle
Frank (Sean Chapman), whose insatiable desires
started it all.

HELLBOUND
HELLRAISERII

idea which goes all the way back to Dante.
"Hellhound" has its problems. Like the first one,
it's unclear whether the setting is England or the
United States. More importantly, the Cenobites,
despite their leather fetish and bondage parapher
nalia, turn out to be wimps who get picked off by
a new villian in about two minutes.
We learn more about them this time, though —
they turn out to be human, ail-too human. Barker's
monsters don't come from someplace else, Beyond
or Outside; they're us, in a heightened state of being.
Kirsty is a less annoying character this time,
mainly because she doesn't spend the whole movie
shrieking. Still. . . the Cenobites taunt her by saying,
"So eager to play, so reluctant to admit it."
The Cenobites' line, "We have such sights to show
you," could be Barker's motto. More for him is
more, as rr uch as special effects budgets and censors
will allow. But while parts of "Hellhound" really
are disgusting the movie has its own kind of integ
rity. Barker, Randel and Co. have no interest in
titillation, or in cheap laugh-getters. They're serious
about this stuff. » t , , , > .
