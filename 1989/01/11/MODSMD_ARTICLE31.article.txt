## "Hellhound" director Tony Randel talks about horror, Hell and Clive Barker 
### Mark Tompkins Staff writer 
In the• classic Hollywood tradition,
Tony Randel got his start by working
in the mail-room. Fortunately for him,
it was the mailroom of Roger Corman's
New World Pictures. Corman graduated
from Stanford (BS, Engineering, 1947)
and went on to become the dean of low
budget American filmmaking, acting as
mentor to the likes of Martin Scorsese
and Francis Ford Coppola.
Randel broke out of the mailroom to
work on special effects for films such

as "Escape From New York." He then
moved on to editing trailers (previews),
and when Corman sold New World,
Randel stayed to become head of post
production. In 1987 he worked as the
studio representative on "Hellraiser," a
low-budget English horror film written
and directed by novelist Clive Barker.
Randel's experience on that film landed
him in the director's chair of "Hel
lhound: Hellraiser II," a movie which
achieves a lot on a relatively dinky
budget of $4.5 million.
A tall, soft-spoken man, Randel was
obviously proud of his efforts on "Hel-

Ibound" — his intent, he says, was to
take the material as seriously as possible
— but he avoided any kind of hard sell
during our conversation. He actually
seemed relieved when the talk shifted
away from the movie to more general
topics. With his first film done, he is
eager to do another.
Daily: Many people look down on horror
movies, saying that they're gory and
they make the world an uglier place.
