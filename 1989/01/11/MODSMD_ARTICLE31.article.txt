# The 						man who pushes Pinhead around
## "Hellhound" director Tony Randel talks about horror, Hell and Clive Barker 
### Mark Tompkins Staff writer 
In the• classic Hollywood tradition,
Tony Randel got his start by working
in the mail-room. Fortunately for him,
it was the mailroom of Roger Corman's
New World Pictures. Corman graduated
from Stanford (BS, Engineering, 1947)
and went on to become the dean of low
budget American filmmaking, acting as
mentor to the likes of Martin Scorsese
and Francis Ford Coppola.
Randel broke out of the mailroom to
work on special effects for films such

as "Escape From New York." He then
moved on to editing trailers (previews),
and when Corman sold New World,
Randel stayed to become head of post
production. In 1987 he worked as the
studio representative on "Hellraiser," a
low-budget English horror film written
and directed by novelist Clive Barker.
Randel's experience on that film landed
him in the director's chair of "Hel
lhound: Hellraiser II," a movie which
achieves a lot on a relatively dinky
budget of $4.5 million.
A tall, soft-spoken man, Randel was
obviously proud of his efforts on "Hel-

Ibound" — his intent, he says, was to
take the material as seriously as possible
— but he avoided any kind of hard sell
during our conversation. He actually
seemed relieved when the talk shifted
away from the movie to more general
topics. With his first film done, he is
eager to do another.
Daily: Many people look down on horror
movies, saying that they're gory and
they make the world an uglier place.
What's your reaction to that? Why
make a film like "Hellhound"?
Kandcl: I think there's a lot of
snobbery when it comes to certain
genres. I was in a high school
English class once and the teacher
said science-fiction and fantasy
books are not true literature. And
I thought, "Well f--k you, you bas
tard." I had always loved science
fiction and fantasy and horror,
and so I found that very offensive.
There's a prevailing snobbery
that it's not true drama, that it's
not a legitimate thing for an art
form to be concerned with. That's
bullshit. Anytime you commit
something to film, you're treading
on art anyway. And to say that
things are not truly an art form
just isn't accurate. Go look at
"The Haunting," the Robert Wise
film. It's a beautiful horror film.
And to say that they make the
world an uglier place — hopefully
not to be too blasphemous, but
The Bible in many ways is very
horrific, and it's part of literature.
This type of thing has been part
of literature since the beginning.
Do these films add things to
society? Yes, they do. Do they
bring enjoyment to people? Yes,

in certain ways. Do they turn
people into killers? No, I don't
think so. 1 don't think films cause
people to do anything.
Daily: The posters for "Hel
lhound" compare Pinhead, the
main Cenobite character, to
Freddy Krueger. "Move over Fred
dy, Pinhead is the new horror
hero." I know the director doesn't
have any control over marketing,
but what's your response to that?
Kandcl: Well I understand mar
keting, and that's a quote from
some magazine. Pinhead is not
Freddy Krueger, there's no way
he's Freddy Krueger, but if it sells
tickets, I understand. I'm not a
purist, I want as many people as
possible to see my film. If that
statement brings people in, that's
great, but I don't agree with it.

Daily: Who contributed what to
the movie? What did Clive Barker
bring, and what did you and
[screenwriter] Peter Atkins bring
to it? I know one of Barker's short
stories was used...
Randel: There's actually no short
story. Clive had a basic story out
lined and he gave it to Peter, and
Peter wrote a first draft. Then I
got involved, and Peter and I spent

six weeks,
in a hotel
room in
London,
every day,
bashing out
rewrites,
using Clive
to bounce
things off
of. So it was
very col

laborative.
Daily: How do you think your
personality makes "Hellhound"
different from "Hellraiser," in
terms of a different director and
a different vision?
Randel: Clive and I have different
personalities. I think he tends to
be more concerned with some
things, me with other things. We
have a similar way of looking at
the world, especially the darker
things, the obsessive things,
which I'm definitely attracted to.
My personality is there. It's
definitely imprinted on the film.
There's no way that a director's
can't be. It may not be clear-cut,
because in many ways we're very
similar. My personality is im
printed on "Hellraiser" because I
was involved with it from the
studio's standpoint.

Clive created this world, which
I was really able to key into, which
is why I did the second picture.
It's a continuation of the same
world, but without being the exact
same thing.
Daily: What specifically, or
thematically, interested you about
that world?
Randcl: I'm very interested in ob
sessive people, like Frank in "Hel
lraiser." In this picture, there's a
lot of obsessive people.
And also the idea of going into
another world. I love the idea of
creating a world on film. It's such
a lucky thing that this film was
done entirely at Pinewood Studios
[a mammoth film studio in Eng
land where the "Star Wars" and
James Bond films are made].
Daily: As a first-time director
doing a movie with a lot of special
effects, did you run into any dif
ficulties?
Randel: It's a difficult process,
because although I had been in
volved with visuals and effects for
a number of years on those earlier
Corman films, and had worked
with a lot of really good people,
people who went on to win Acad
emy Awards — directing, making
them fit into the film, you still
don't know if it's going to work.
You have actors looking at
something that isn't there, or at
a piece of tape. Or you have actors
walking, and the camera is a hun
dred feet above them, and and
they're walking through this huge
landscape that isn't there yet. So
it's difficult visualizing it. It's a
real challenge.
I think my background gave me
the confidence to go ahead-
