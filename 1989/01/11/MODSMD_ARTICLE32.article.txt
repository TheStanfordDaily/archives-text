## Jammin' January 
### 
Welcome to the world of murder — murder,
corruption and comedy, that is. Three of my
favorite topics, especially after winter break.
Tomorrow night at 8 p.m. in Cubberley Au
ditorium you can catch a free preview screening
of "The January Man," starring Kevin Kline
as an offbeat, eclectic super sleuth detective
(their words, not mine) in pursuit of a cereal
killer implicated in the deaths of Count
Chocula, Snap, Crackle and Pop. Whoops! I
mean serial killer.
Also involved in the hunt are Rod Steiger
as the mayor, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio
as his daughter, Harvey Keitel and Danny
Aiello as the police commissioner and his cap
tain, and Susan Sarandon as one of the most
attractive women in movies today.
"The January Man" opens nationwide on
Friday, but you can catch it tomorrow for free
at Cubberley.
