## A
						winter of change 
### 
The new year has begun
and, as always, it brings
a full menu of delicacies
to satisfy the appetite of even
the most voracious sports fan.
Topping the list is football's
annual "blue plate special," the
Super Bowl. Every year the
matchup between the best from
the National and American
Football Conferences promises
to be a great game.

And every year (at least re
cently) it's an NFC blowout.
At first glance, this year's
Bengals-49ers contest fits that
mold. The 49ers, subscribers
to the conventional wisdom say,
are a) on a roll b) the team of
the '80s c) coached by Bill
Walsh (the best since Lom
bardi, they tell us) and d)
favored by almost a touchdown.
Ergo, another NFC blowout
and a third Super Bowl ring
for Joe Montana & Co.
Me, I ignored the "This is
your final notice — Renew your
subscription NOW" letter that
Conventional Wisdom Weekly
sent me in August and haven't
received a copy in months.
Thus, I'll take Cincinnati, 24-
21, on an "Ickey Shuffle" in
the game's waning minutes.
When the final gun sounds
in Joe Robbie Stadium on Jan.
22, the football season will
mercifully come to an end.
Professional football has
been wholly uninspiring ever
since the strike last year. The
play seems to be lacking in in
tensity.
Fans also are less involved.
Despite the the high intensity
in the Bay Area as the 49ers
get a shot at winning it all,
across the board, fewer people
are tuning in and taking note.
There are no great Oakland
Raider (yes, Oakland) or Dallas
Cowboy teams to capture the
national attention any longer.
On the other hand . . .
Basketball has never been
hotter.
The question facing the NBA
right now is: Will the
popularity of the game remain
as sky-high as Michael Jordan
soaring through the air for a
slam dunk without the Lakers
and Celtics riding atop their
respective conferences?
The guess here is absolutely.
Meanwhile, while Boston and
L.A. are not yet corpses, they
are terminal patients.
On the Lakers' side, Kareem
is already through and Mvchal
Thompson, Michael Cooper and
(gulp) Magic Johnson are on
the down sides of their careers.
The Lakers have a dearth, no,
a complete void, when it comes
to young talent. The curtain is
coming down on Showtime, I'm
afraid.

In Beantown, the picture is
even more bleak. Dennis
Johnson and Robert Parrish
(despite his phenomenal start
this year) are old. Kevin
McHale has shown that he's
not the same without the Bird
fellow on the court — and he's
no youngster either.
And, of course, who knows
how Larry the Great, will be
once he returns from foot sur
gery in February.
None of this is news, of
course. The interesting
developments so far this year
are the earlier-than-expected
arrival of the Cavaliers and
Knicks to the league's elite and
the disappointing play of the
Dallas Mavericks.
Cleveland, led by Brad Daug
herty, the third best center in
the NBA, Mark Price, the little
point guard who almost never
makes a bad decision, as well
as Larry Nance and Ron Har
per, is ready to make a run at
the title right now. That would
makes Magic's "the Cavs are
the team-of-the-'9os" predic
tion come true a year early.
Even if they come up short
this year, Lenny Wilkens
should keep Cleveland rolling
for a long time.
The Knicks aren't as far
along, but do have Madison
Square Garden rocking like it
hasn't in recent memory. Fiery
Rick Pitino has Patrick Ewing,
Mark Jackson and the rest of
the New Yorkers frustrating
opponents and winning games
in bunches.
The doormat of the confer
ence just two years ago, the
Knickerbockers may now be
just a smidgen of maturity
away from bringing New York
its first title since 1973.
Going in exactly the opposite
direction of the upwardly
mobile franchises in New York
and Cleveland, the Dallas
Mavericks are a team in trou
ble.
Loaded with talent, the Mavs
served noticed in Jsst season's
playoffs had arrived.
Now, they're atop the missing
persons list.
With the incredibly gifted,
super-sixth man Roy Tarpley
out of the lineup (first an in
jury, now drug rehab) the Mavs
have been mediocre. Unable to
capitalize on a gaggle of early
season home games, Dallas
hasn't taken the NBA's over
whelming home-court advan
tage and parlayed it into
enough wins.
Perhaps they'll now have the
excuse they've been looking for
to dump moody Mark Aguirre
(no one would give the Mavs
much in a trade) and move on
without the man who is most
closely associated with the
franchise.
In the next 50 games, many
of these questions will no doubt
be answered. As fans, we may
as well sit back, relax and enjoy
the show.
Now, if we only had cable on
campus .. .
