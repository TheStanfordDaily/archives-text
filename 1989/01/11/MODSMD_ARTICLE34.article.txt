# Asforis triumphs over adversity
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Injury is every athlete's nightmare. Aside
from the pain and hassles of rehabilitation,
ailments cost players valuable training time
and lessen the competitve edge that athletes
work so hard to cultivate.
Few know this better than Evon Asforis,
one of the post powerhouses of the Stanford
women's basketball team. Downed with a knee
injury two years ago serious enough to remove
her from the starting line-up, Asforis is back
and stronger than ever in her senior season

as tri-captain for the Cardinal.
Though not a starter this season, Asforis
has logged enough quality time to earn oppo
nents' respect. She is often the first forward
off the bench, and her aggressive play and
tough rebounding have kept her on the court
for an average of 17 minutes a game.
"I think Evon is playing really well," Stan
ford Coach Tara VanDerveer said. "She's
working really hard and is coming off of the
knee injury. It's a great comeback story."
The narrative of The Evon Asforis Story
begins in the second game of her sophomore
season. After a 17-point performance in the

Cardinal's opening win against Cleveland, As
foris injured her knee in the following contest.
UNLV was the last opponent she faced that
year.
"She came down on it at a weird angle,
and it just went out," VanDerveer recalled.
The mishap launched her down a long road
to recovery. Surgery and physical rehabilita
tion healed the damage, but it took Asforis'
perseverence to return to present form.
It also took tolerance. Even after she was
healthy enough to return, doctors required
her to wear an encumbering knee brace. Fi
nally, with her knee as strong as ever, Asforis
is free.
"Last year 1 thought she was slowed down
by her brace a bit," VanDerveer said. "Now
she's playing with a lot more confidence. She's
one of our best rebounders, is real aggressive
and makes stuff happen.
"All in all, I think she's the reason we're
doing as well as we are," the coach added.

While returning to her
sophomore level would
have been feat enough,
the senior has tran
scended her former level
of play and become a
feared force.

The change from injured to inspired was
•not overnight. Her forced absence from com
petition took its toll on her game, sapping
some of her speed and strength as well as
some of the moves she developed during her
freshman season and her high school years
at August Martin High School in Queens Vil
lage, New York.
Asforis fought back to star status, spending
hours in the gym day after day improving her
skills and rekindling her athletic spark. While
returning to her sophomore level would have
been feat enough, the senior has transcended
her former level of play and become a feared
force. No longer hindered, she plays with an
enviable intensity and puts the power in power
forward.
"If you're out there, you might as well put
out," the senior reasoned. "If you don't give
it your ail when you're out there, you're prob
ably more prone to get hurt again anyway.
And for your teammates, you want to work
hard for your teammates because they're out
there working hard for you."
Her camaraderie is contagious. The Cardinal
is a close squad that follows the lead of its
hard-woking, easy-going captain. The consum
mate good example, Asforis also supplies the
needed infusions of humor and cheer when
her teammates are down.
"I would be the same if I was the captain
or not," she said. "But I'm glad I am. I hope
the team is glad I am, but I think they are."
