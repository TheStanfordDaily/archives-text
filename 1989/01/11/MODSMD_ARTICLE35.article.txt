# Fencers fare well on East Coast trip
## 
### Doug Boeschen Staff writer 
The Stanford fencers turned a
few heads on their recent road
trip, in which they mixed blades
with some tough Eastern teams.
Not previously known as a na
tional power, the Cardinal duelers
will from now on be recognized
as a team to be reckoned with.
The men were very impressive as
they earned a 7-1 road-trip record,
and the women fought their way
to a strong 5-3 showing.
"We really showed the East
what we're all about," team man

ager Jim Farrell said. The Stan
ford fencers had headed east with
the goal of making a name for
themselves and representing
Stanford. They did both, accord
ing to men's Coach Zoran Tulum:
"We did a great job of representing
Stanford," he said.
Despite jet lag, little sleep (an
average of four hours each night),
and a foreign environment, the
women's team had a successful
trip. Receiving 80 percent of their
fencers from physical education
classes, they were impressive in
easily defeating Wellesley 12-4
and a strong Temple team 13-3.

They went on to defeat Brandeis,
Vassar and Cornell while losing
to Brown, Harvard and North
Carolina. The match with Har
vard was extremely close (7-9) and
the loss to UNC was apparently
due to poor officiating. "Even the
N.C. coach said that we had the
better team," said Farrell.
The men also had a close match
with UNC, as they fell behind
early, 13-8. But with six clutch
bouts they battled back bravely
to win the match 14-13. They
swept through the other six teams
they faced before receiving their
only loss at the hands of a touch

Harvard team. A hotly-contested
match throughout, it came down
to the final touch before the result
was decided. After Steve Schmidt
scored a pressure win to tie the
match at 13-13, Rich Reader lost
the final bout 5-4 on an unfortu
nate double-touch.
Despite the loss to Harvard,
Tulum and women's Coach
Sherry Posthumus were both
pleased with the outcome of the
trip. "The Eastern teams were
really surprised â€” they didn't ex
pect us to be so tough," Tulum
said.
