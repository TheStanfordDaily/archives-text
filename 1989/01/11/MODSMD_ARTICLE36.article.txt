# Wrestlers romp over break

### Greg Gottesman Staff writer 
Hollywood has its three amigos: Chevy
Chase, Martin Short and Steve Martin.
The Denver Broncos have theirs. Stanford,
never to be outdone, has found three chums
of its own: Steve Buddie, Ron Perry and
Steve Yarbrough.
The latter three comrades have a few
things in common. They all wrestle for
Stanford. Each is an underclassman. Most
importantly, each one has made winning
an art form.
Stanford Coach Chris Horpel says all
three have a more than excellent shot at
achieving All-America status before leaving
Cardinalville. Not too shabby considering
not one is on a wrestling scholarship; Stan
ford doesn't give any.
This past vacation, Cardinal wrestlers
competed in three tournaments, the Las
Vegas Invitational, the Aloha Classic and
the Doc Petersen Open. Many wrestlers
placed in the various tourneys; the three
amigos went wild.
In the Vegas Invitational, co-captain
Yarbrough (167 lbs.) placed fourth, while
Buddie (177 lbs.) and sophomore James
Dinette (142 lbs.) stood but one match
from placing. Horpel praised the perform
ance of the three in what he called "the
toughest tournament until the NCCA
Championships in March.
Yarbrough, the first Cardinal wrestler
to place in three years, also won the tour
nament's award for the "most falls" as he
pinned three opposing wrestlers in a row.

"It felt really good to wrestle well at that
tournament, especially since I was just com
ing off a knee injury and hadn't wrestled
that well in practice," Yarbrough said. "It
was kind of like basketball. You start hit
ting those 3-pointers, and everything
grooves. That's the way the tournament
went for me."
In the Aloha Classic Dec. 30, the varsity
team proved that its trip to Hawaii was
well-earned, as seven wrestlers placed. Yar
brough and Buddie finished second in their
respective divisions. Ron Perry (190 lbs.),
back from a tournament-ending knee injury
in Las Vegas, took third. Junior GeofT
Baum (150 lbs.) grabbed fourth, while
Dinette and freshmen standouts Dave
Nowick (118 lbs.) and Mark Graham (167
lbs.) captured sixth. Junior Josh Lisle (134
lbs.) was just one match away from placing.
At the Doc Petersen Open at Chico State
Jan. 6-7, Buddie became the first champion
in Stanford's five-year history at the tour
ney; he pinned a two-time junior college
national champion in the finals.
Perry took second in the 190-lb. division,
losing in the final seconds 4-3 to John
Mclntyre of Humboldt State. The other
amigo, Yarbrough, sprained his ankle and
was unable to compete. Junior Trent Smith
(heavyweight) and Graham both placed
seventh.
"Besides Buddie's first-place finish, the
Doc Petersen Open was good because it let
a lot of guys take part who hadn't gotten
a chance to compete," Horpel said.

Sophomore Steve Buddie went on a tear in two tournamenta over winter break, placing aecond In hit claaa at the
Aloha Open and winning the Doc Peteraen Open.
Stanford wrestlers, however,
would probably give up much of
their success at the various tour
naments to rid themselves of the
"injury plague" that has been
haunting the team. Sophomore
Loren Vigil (134 lbs.) tore liga
ments in his first match at the
Doc Petersen Open and will be
sidelined for the rest of the year.

Despite the injuries, Horpel
feels optimistib. "The attitude on
the team is really good. We have
instigated some morning work
outs. The team is running sta
dium stairs in the morning and
lifting at night," he said. "Janu
ary and Febuary is the most in
tense part of the season. We have
picked up the commitment and
intensity."
Four squad members have
sprained ankles, while others suf
fer from such ailments as back
and neck sprains and the flu.
