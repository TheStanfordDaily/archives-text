# Student interaction with professors grows under programs
## 
### Elaine Riggs Staff writer 
When they came here as freshmen last
year, Raina Jackson and Nomi Martin
did not expect to plunge into an intensive
research project on Black English with
a professor.
And they didn't expect to fly to
Montreal in October to present their final
paper at an international linguistics con
ference.
Through the Undergraduate Scholars
Program, the two freshmen managed to
avoid the complaint of many Stanford
undergraduates that they don't have the
chance to interact with faculty.
Several professors have joined students
in expressing concern over the limited
number of opportunities for working
closely together.
While University administrators ac

knowledge the situation, they say that
very little can be done to change it.
"The biggest obstacle I have to fight
in my job — and I don't expect to win
— is that this is a research institution,"
said Thomas Wasow, dean of Humanities
and Sciences.
"It's also clear that there's no easy
remedy for that," Wasow added.
Undergraduate Scholars
Three years ago, Afro-American
Studies Prof. Kennell Jackson (no rela
tion to Raina Jackson) created the Un
dergraduate Scholars Program to offer
undergraduates a chance to research a
topic of their choice under the direction
of a faculty member for one quarter.
Prof. Jackson said he first designed
the program for black students, because
he thought they were not getting as much
access to faculty as other students. Now,

the 60 undergraduates who have partic
ipated include students of all races.
"We've had some really stupendous
results, some excellent essays," Jackson
said.
Raina Jackson and Martin researched
Black English under the direction of Lin
guistics Prof. John Rickford.
The two freshmen met with the pro
fessor for a couple of two-hour meetings
during the spring quarter, according to
Raina Jackson.
"It was a good chance to find out how
Prof. Rickford researches things," Raina
Jackson said. "You hear about professors
writing papers all the time, but you don't
know how much work they put into it."
"I found out it's a long process," she
added.
Undergruduate participants received
$150 for project expenses and 3-5 units
of credit for their work. The program

was initially funded by the University
Provost's Innovation Fund and is now
funded by an Irvine Foundation grant.
"I don't think Stanford can truly ad
vance as an intellectual place unless it
gets more projects of this type," Prof.
Jackson said.
The Porteus Proposal
At about the same time last spring,
Evan Porteus, a professor at the Stanford
Graduate School of Business, and Ann
Porteus, director of research in Under
graduate Admissions and Financial Aid,
were devising their own proposal to in
crease contacts between faculty and un
dergraduates.
The Porteuses proposed that every un
dergraduate be required to participate in
an individual or small group faculty
directed experience.
"So many students go through here

without getting to know a faculty member
— not even well enough to get recom
mendations," Ann Porteus said.
The Porteuses were resident fellows at
Roble Hall for several years. There, they
faced students desperate for recommen
dations who would turn to them.
"We were getting asked over and over
again by dorm residents who we really
didn't know," Ann Porteus said. "We kept
finding ourselves in the really horrible
position of having to turn them down
. . . because we couldn't write good rec
ommendations for them."
The proposal attracted campus-wide at
tention last April when their proposal
letter was published in The Daily and
Campus Report.
Subsequently, the Committee on Un-
