# Student interaction with professors grows under programs
## 
### Elaine Riggs Staff writer 
When they came here as freshmen last
year, Raina Jackson and Nomi Martin
did not expect to plunge into an intensive
research project on Black English with
a professor.
And they didn't expect to fly to
Montreal in October to present their final
paper at an international linguistics con
ference.
Through the Undergraduate Scholars
Program, the two freshmen managed to
avoid the complaint of many Stanford
undergraduates that they don't have the
chance to interact with faculty.
Several professors have joined students
in expressing concern over the limited
number of opportunities for working
closely together.
While University administrators ac

knowledge the situation, they say that
very little can be done to change it.
"The biggest obstacle I have to fight
in my job — and I don't expect to win
— is that this is a research institution,"
said Thomas Wasow, dean of Humanities
and Sciences.
"It's also clear that there's no easy
remedy for that," Wasow added.
Undergraduate Scholars
Three years ago, Afro-American
Studies Prof. Kennell Jackson (no rela
tion to Raina Jackson) created the Un
dergraduate Scholars Program to offer
undergraduates a chance to research a
topic of their choice under the direction
of a faculty member for one quarter.
Prof. Jackson said he first designed
the program for black students, because
he thought they were not getting as much
access to faculty as other students. Now,

the 60 undergraduates who have partic
ipated include students of all races.
"We've had some really stupendous
results, some excellent essays," Jackson
said.
Raina Jackson and Martin researched
Black English under the direction of Lin
guistics Prof. John Rickford.
The two freshmen met with the pro
fessor for a couple of two-hour meetings
during the spring quarter, according to
Raina Jackson.
"It was a good chance to find out how
Prof. Rickford researches things," Raina
Jackson said. "You hear about professors
writing papers all the time, but you don't
know how much work they put into it."
"I found out it's a long process," she
added.
Undergruduate participants received
$150 for project expenses and 3-5 units
of credit for their work. The program

was initially funded by the University
Provost's Innovation Fund and is now
funded by an Irvine Foundation grant.
"I don't think Stanford can truly ad
vance as an intellectual place unless it
gets more projects of this type," Prof.
Jackson said.
The Porteus Proposal
At about the same time last spring,
Evan Porteus, a professor at the Stanford
Graduate School of Business, and Ann
Porteus, director of research in Under
graduate Admissions and Financial Aid,
were devising their own proposal to in
crease contacts between faculty and un
dergraduates.
The Porteuses proposed that every un
dergraduate be required to participate in
an individual or small group faculty
directed experience.
"So many students go through here

without getting to know a faculty member
— not even well enough to get recom
mendations," Ann Porteus said.
The Porteuses were resident fellows at
Roble Hall for several years. There, they
faced students desperate for recommen
dations who would turn to them.
"We were getting asked over and over
again by dorm residents who we really
didn't know," Ann Porteus said. "We kept
finding ourselves in the really horrible
position of having to turn them down
. . . because we couldn't write good rec
ommendations for them."
The proposal attracted campus-wide at
tention last April when their proposal
letter was published in The Daily and
Campus Report.
Subsequently, the Committee on Un-
dergraduate Studies met and dis
cussed the proposal, but the com
mittee members were somewhat
skeptical, according to Wasow,
who attended the meeting.
"We decided to first look at the
causes of the problem," Wasow
said. "Is it a lack of opportunities
for the students? Or are the op
portunities there but the students
aren't taking advantage of them?"
When the committee discussed
the Porteus proposal, members
thought "it was not a good idea
to place the burden on the stu
dent," Wasow said.
"A student can choose to go
through here without ever getting
to know a faculty member. . . . We
should not forbid that," Wasow
said.
Seniors Have Their Say
The 1987-88 Senior Survey
results show that a considerable
number of undergraduates went
through Stanford without work
ing closely with any professors.
When asked, "Have you had any

sustained small-group contact
with a Stanford faculty mem
ber?": 40 percent of the seniors
surveyed responded "no."
The seniors were also asked to
respond to an open-ended ques
tion about their interaction with
faculty.
Some seniors said they had re
warding experiences with faculty.
"Let me put it this way: My
research experience made my ac
ademic, intellectual and personal
life at Stanford an exhilarating
experience. Getting to know and
working with great minds is what
this place is all about," one senior
wrote.
"I believe that a significant part
of what I have learned at Stanford
has occurred at the one-on-one
level," another senior wrote.
Seniors applauded the value of
working closely with professors
and seeing how the faculty con
ducts their research. Some seniors
said advice from professors on fu
ture academic and career plans
was important.
Seniors' comments also showed
that many of them felt in
timidated at the prospect of ap
proaching a professor.
"I was afraid to approach pro
fessors. I felt they didn't have the
time for me, or would treat me
as if I and my ideas were insig
nificant and ridiculous," one
senior wrote.
Whether faculty does have time

When asked, 'Have
you had any sus
tained small-group
contact with a Stan
ford faculty mem
ber?': 40 percent of
the seniors surveyed
responded 'no.'

for undergraduates is an issue
that returns to the picture of
Stanford as a research university.
"Certainly research plays a
much larger role here than at a
teaching institution," said James
Lyons, dean of Student Affairs.
The faculty have monetary as
well as academic incentives to
focus on their research, according
to Wasow.
"The faculty's reputation
depends primarily on their re
search and that's the biggest
determinant in terms of salaries."
However, the survey results
show that faculty are not always
the ones who are "too busy" to
work together with students.
"I am busy — and faculty and
advisers wait for me to come to
them. They do not seek students
out. The extent of their 'seeking'
is to flatly announce office hours,"
one senior complained.

The Future of the Proposal
In April, Wasow sent a ques
tionnaire to University depart
ments and programs that offer un
dergraduate degrees to find out
what opportunities for interaction
with faculty were offered.
The questionnaire asked them
what opportunities they offer stu
dents for small-group or individ
ual contact with faculty members,
and what resources (financial and
human) would be required to im
plement such opportunities.
Wasow said he received 32 re
sponses out of 50 departments and
programs.
"My preliminary impression is
that their is no shortage of op
portunities in the humanities, but
there may be a lack of opportu
nities in the social sciences,"
Wasow said.
"Realistically, we're not going
to be able to provide everyone
with one-on-one interactions with
faculty," Wasow said.
"It would be more realistic to
aim for small group interactions
for all of the students — but that,
too, would be very difficult,"
Wasow said.
The Committee of Administra
tive Deans for Undergraduate
Studies plans to meet this month
to discuss the Porteus proposal.
Asked if he expects this com
mittee to recommend any action,
Wasow replied, "I doubt it."
