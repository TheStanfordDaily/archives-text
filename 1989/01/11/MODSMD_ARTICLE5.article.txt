# Biden: Revamp foreign policy
## Delaware senator says 'military superiority is of no value' 
### John Wagner Staff writer 
Due to a number of "stunning
changes" in the world economy
and the ascendency of "a radical
reformer" in the Soviet Union,
the United States faces its
greatest need to reformulate
foreign policy since the end of
World War 11, Sen. Joseph Biden,
D-Del., said last night.
In a speech before an overflow
crowd at Kresge Auditorium,
Biden asserted that, after coming
to power, the Bush Administra
tion should:
• Realize that although military
power is important, military su
periority is "of no value";
• Increase cooperation with the
Soviet Union on issues in addition
to arms control, such as the en
vironment and elimination of
chemical weapons;
• Develop a more sophisticated
view of the Third World, in which
industrialized nations would take
a more responsible role in lifting
the economic burden from devel
oping nations.
Biden is the second-ranked
Democrat on the U.S. Senate
Foreign Relations Committee and
a former presidential candidate.

idential nomination ended prema
