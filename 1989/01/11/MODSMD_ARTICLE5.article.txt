# Biden: Revamp foreign policy
## Delaware senator says 'military superiority is of no value' 
### John Wagner Staff writer 
Due to a number of "stunning
changes" in the world economy
and the ascendency of "a radical
reformer" in the Soviet Union,
the United States faces its
greatest need to reformulate
foreign policy since the end of
World War 11, Sen. Joseph Biden,
D-Del., said last night.
In a speech before an overflow
crowd at Kresge Auditorium,
Biden asserted that, after coming
to power, the Bush Administra
tion should:
• Realize that although military
power is important, military su
periority is "of no value";
• Increase cooperation with the
Soviet Union on issues in addition
to arms control, such as the en
vironment and elimination of
chemical weapons;
• Develop a more sophisticated
view of the Third World, in which
industrialized nations would take
a more responsible role in lifting
the economic burden from devel
oping nations.
Biden is the second-ranked
Democrat on the U.S. Senate
Foreign Relations Committee and
a former presidential candidate.

idential nomination ended prema

relations between the United States, Soviet Union and Third World
nations in a campus speech last night.
New York Times and other media.
In his address sponsored by
Stanford-in-Government, Biden
said that he is considering another
run for the presidency, but that
he would "definitely not" enter
the 1992 race.
In the opening remarks of his
speech, Biden used self
denigrating humor to address
what he termed his "haphazard
campaign" in 1987.
Biden told the audience that he
had chosen to speak on U.S.-
Soviet relations because it was the
only subject on which Neil Kin
nock had not spoken.
Kinnock is the British Labor
Party leader whose rhetoric Biden
borrowed without attribution at
a campaign appearance.

Biden said that the most sig
nificant changes that have taken
place in the world economy are
the "total coHapee of communism
as an econQmic model" and the
increasing dominance of economic
power over military power in in
ternational relations.
The "self-admission" by Gorba
chev of communism's futility is
"stunning," Biden said. Gorba
chev is the first Russian leader
since Peter the Great to conclude
that he had to look to the West
for solutions to his country's
problems, Biden said.
Biden said that the impact of
Gorbachev's reforms "would be
like George Bush taking office and
saying, '1 think we should nation
alize all industry.' "
The lack of focus on issues in
the recent presidential campaign
has made it difficult to formulate
effective foreign policy, Biden said.

Increase coopera
tion with the Soviet
Union on issues in
addition to arms
control...

Bush lacks a consensus on his
agenda, Biden said, because he did
not make his agenda clear in the
campaign.
However, Biden said he was not
in a position to be too self
righteous: "You're looking at a
guy who couldn't even make it to
lowa."
In February 1988 — just a few
months after Biden withdrew
from the Democratic field — he
suffered a life-threatening brain
aneurysm, a weakening in an ar

tery supplying blood to the brain.
He was rushed to Walter Reed
Army Medical Center for eight
hours of cranial surgery, a proce
dure which many patients ao not
survive. \
In May, Biden developed a sec
ond aneurysm.
He subsequently fully recovered
and returned to public life in Sep
tember.
Since his election to the Senate
in 1972, Biden has been active in
the areas of U.S.-Soviet relations,
NATO policy, arms control and
Middle East policy. He has been
critical of the last two adminis
trations' actions in the Middle
East and has led efforts to remove
U.S. forces from Lebanon.
In September 1987, Biden
presided over the Senate confir
mation hearings of former Su
preme Court nominee Robert
Bork.

speech, Biden used self
denigrating humor to address
what he termed his "haphazard
campaign" in 1987.
Biden told the audience that he
had chosen to speak on U.S.-
Soviet relations because it was the
only subject on which Neil Kin
nock had not spoken.
Kinnock is the British Labor
Party leader whose rhetoric Biden
borrowed without attribution at
a campaign appearance.

Biden said that the most sig
nificant changes that have taken
place in the world economy are
the "total coHapee of communism
as an econQmic model" and the
increasing dominance of economic
power over military power in in
ternational relations.
The "self-admission" by Gorba
chev of communism's futility is
"stunning," Biden said. Gorba
chev is the first Russian leader
since Peter the Great to conclude
that he had to look to the West
for solutions to his country's
problems, Biden said.
Biden said that the impact of
Gorbachev's reforms "would be
like George Bush taking office and
saying, '1 think we should nation
alize all industry.' "
The lack of focus on issues in
the recent presidential campaign
has made it difficult to formulate
effective foreign policy, Biden said.

Increase coopera
tion with the Soviet
Union on issues in
addition to arms
control...

Bush lacks a consensus on his
agenda, Biden said, because he did
not make his agenda clear in the
campaign.
However, Biden said he was not
in a position to be too self
righteous: "You're looking at a
guy who couldn't even make it to
lowa."
In February 1988 — just a few
months after Biden withdrew
from the Democratic field — he
suffered a life-threatening brain
aneurysm, a weakening in an ar

tery supplying blood to the brain.
He was rushed to Walter Reed
Army Medical Center for eight
hours of cranial surgery, a proce
dure which many patients ao not
survive. \
In May, Biden developed a sec
ond aneurysm.
He subsequently fully recovered
and returned to public life in Sep
tember.
Since his election to the Senate
in 1972, Biden has been active in
the areas of U.S.-Soviet relations,
NATO policy, arms control and
Middle East policy. He has been
critical of the last two adminis
trations' actions in the Middle
East and has led efforts to remove
U.S. forces from Lebanon.
In September 1987, Biden
presided over the Senate confir
mation hearings of former Su
preme Court nominee Robert
Bork.
