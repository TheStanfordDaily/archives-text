# Frosh high on higher ed
## Survey: Only 2 percent will stop at bachelor's 
### DJ Berinstein Staff writer 
Is Stanford really becoming
more intellectual? In a recent na
tional survey conducted by The
American Council on Education
and UCLA, Stanford's class of
1992 cited more academic reasons
than previous incoming classes for
attending Stanford.
An all-time high for Stanford's
results, the survey, released Mon
day, found that more than a third
of the freshman class respondents
said they planned to earn a doc
torate — a 10 percent rise over
the past five years.
The findings seem to corre
spond to what Dean of Under
graduate Admissions Jean Fetter
yesterday called a "focus on ex
treme intellectual ability."
Although Fetter said it was dif
ficult to say whether the results
showed an increase in intellec
tualism since the term itself is
hard to define, she did say she
finds the results of the survey
useful.
"The survey shows us a pro
spective of the students that we
don't ask and can never know
from applications," she said. "I'd
like to see more comparative snap
shots taken of the students just
before they graduate to see what
kind of difference Stanford has
made."
Agreeing that Stanford
deliberately tries "to attract the
most intellectually able students
in the country," Dean of Student

Affairs James Lyons said, "It's a
mistake to think that (intellec
tualism) is an either/or subject."
Lyons compared Stanford to its
East Coast counterparts, saying
that a simply intellectual univer
sity does not necessarily make it
a "grim place."
In a Univeristy survey last year,
a majority of recent Stanford grad
uates agreed that the environment
here is in fact intellectual. The
results of the senior survey for
the class of 1988-89 found that
63 percent of recent graduates an
swered the question, "Some have
criticized Stanford as lacking an
intellectual atmosphere. Do you
think that this is a valid
criticism?" with a definitive "no."
The national survey also found
a drop in the number of freshman
respondents who cited Stanford's
social reputation for coming to
the Farm.
Of this year's freshman class,
one-fourth of the respondents
cited the University's social life
as a factor for choosing Stanford,
as opposed to one-third of the re
spondents questioned five years
ago.
However, in The 1988-1989
New York Times Guide To Col
leges, Stanford received a glowing
score for its social life. Out of a
possible five "telephones," Stan
ford scored a four. The University
also received the highest rankings
under the category of academics
and quality of life.
Unlike the survey's findings,
the college guide, edited by Ed
ward Fiske, states that "Stanford
is still looking for that elusive
quality — call it 'intellectual at
mosphere' — that has been the
hallmark of great universities."
The national survey, a 23-year
old project, is funded by various
campuses around the country
which then use the results to com
pare their colleges with national
averages. Asst. Program Director
Kenneth Green said the respon
dents are also tracked over the
years.
This longitudinal research
usually shows that "people be
come less conservative over the
years and become less concerned
about money," said Green.
Among the factors judged to be
important in their decision to at
tend college, 93 percent of the
Stanford respondents said they
came here to learn more, and 48
percent said they choose Stanford

to make more money.
Two new questions on the sur
vey showed "surprising" results,
according to Green. Nationwide,
two-thirds of the respondents ap
proved mandatory AIDS testing,
and 71 percent approved of drug
testing by employers.
Stanford statistics compared
well with the national averages.
For example, mother's and fath
er's highest level of education of
this year's freshmen were more
than twice the national average.
Stanford freshmen also rated

themselves twice as mathemati
cally and verbally able as the na
tional average. In addition, first
year students smoked cigarrettes
one-seventh as often in the past
year than the national average.
Only 35 percent of freshmen
surveyed said they would
"definitely" participate in pro
grams to promote understanding
of students from different racial
background, while 45 percent said
they "probably" would partici
pate. Freshmen were surveyed
shortly after Orientation.

in the country," Dean of Student

Affairs James Lyons said, "It's a
mistake to think that (intellec
tualism) is an either/or subject."
Lyons compared Stanford to its
East Coast counterparts, saying
that a simply intellectual univer
sity does not necessarily make it
a "grim place."
In a Univeristy survey last year,
a majority of recent Stanford grad
uates agreed that the environment
here is in fact intellectual. The
results of the senior survey for
the class of 1988-89 found that
63 percent of recent graduates an
swered the question, "Some have
criticized Stanford as lacking an
intellectual atmosphere. Do you
think that this is a valid
criticism?" with a definitive "no."
The national survey also found
a drop in the number of freshman
respondents who cited Stanford's
social reputation for coming to
the Farm.
Of this year's freshman class,
one-fourth of the respondents
cited the University's social life
as a factor for choosing Stanford,
as opposed to one-third of the re
spondents questioned five years
ago.
However, in The 1988-1989
New York Times Guide To Col
leges, Stanford received a glowing
score for its social life. Out of a
possible five "telephones," Stan
ford scored a four. The University
also received the highest rankings
under the category of academics
and quality of life.
Unlike the survey's findings,
the college guide, edited by Ed
ward Fiske, states that "Stanford
is still looking for that elusive
quality — call it 'intellectual at
mosphere' — that has been the
hallmark of great universities."
The national survey, a 23-year
old project, is funded by various
campuses around the country
which then use the results to com
pare their colleges with national
averages. Asst. Program Director
Kenneth Green said the respon
dents are also tracked over the
years.
This longitudinal research
usually shows that "people be
come less conservative over the
years and become less concerned
about money," said Green.
Among the factors judged to be
important in their decision to at
tend college, 93 percent of the
Stanford respondents said they
came here to learn more, and 48
percent said they choose Stanford

to make more money.
Two new questions on the sur
vey showed "surprising" results,
according to Green. Nationwide,
two-thirds of the respondents ap
proved mandatory AIDS testing,
and 71 percent approved of drug
testing by employers.
Stanford statistics compared
well with the national averages.
For example, mother's and fath
er's highest level of education of
this year's freshmen were more
than twice the national average.
Stanford freshmen also rated

themselves twice as mathemati
cally and verbally able as the na
tional average. In addition, first
year students smoked cigarrettes
one-seventh as often in the past
year than the national average.
Only 35 percent of freshmen
surveyed said they would
"definitely" participate in pro
grams to promote understanding
of students from different racial
background, while 45 percent said
they "probably" would partici
pate. Freshmen were surveyed
shortly after Orientation.
Is Stanford really becoming
more intellectual? In a recent na
tional survey conducted by The
American Council on Education
and UCLA, Stanford's class of
1992 cited more academic reasons
than previous incoming classes for
attending Stanford.
An all-time high for Stanford's
results, the survey, released Mon
day, found that more than a third
of the freshman class respondents
said they planned to earn a doc
torate — a 10 percent rise over
the past five years.
The findings seem to corre
spond to what Dean of Under
graduate Admissions Jean Fetter
yesterday called a "focus on ex
treme intellectual ability."
Although Fetter said it was dif
ficult to say whether the results
showed an increase in intellec
tualism since the term itself is
hard to define, she did say she
finds the results of the survey
useful.
"The survey shows us a pro
spective of the students that we
don't ask and can never know
from applications," she said. "I'd
like to see more comparative snap
shots taken of the students just
before they graduate to see what
kind of difference Stanford has
made."
Agreeing that Stanford
deliberately tries "to attract the
most intellectually able students
in the country," Dean of Student

Affairs James Lyons said, "It's a
mistake to think that (intellec
tualism) is an either/or subject."
