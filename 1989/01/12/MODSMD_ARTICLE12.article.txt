# Reagan says emotional goodbye
## President contented with term; says 'We changed a world' 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Reagan bade the nation a
sentimental and contented
farewell last night, asserting he
had forged "a satisfying new close
ness" with the Soviet Union and
claiming overall of his eight years
in office: "We meant to change a
nation and instead we changed a
world."
Speaking nine days before his
retirement to California, Reagan
said, "the fact is parting is such
sweet sorrow." He reflected on
the modern presidency, "You're

always somewhat apart. You
spend a lot of time going by too
fast in a car someone else is
driving."
In an Oval Office speech
delivered to a prime-time broad
cast audience, he said his chief
regret was the mammoth budget
deficit that accumulated after he
pushed through the biggest tax
cut in American history.
Reagan addressed the nation
from his Oval Office desk, his left
hand in a splint and swathed in
bandages. The president had sur

gery over the weekend to
straighten a curvature of his left
ring finger that had been caused
by an ailment known as
Dupuytren's Contracture.
Reagan said his chief triumphs
were the nation's economic
recovery and"the recovery of our
morale" and America's position
as a world leader. He said his
tenure had stood for freedom and
proved that "democracy, the
profoundly good, is also
profoundly productive."
He said "nothing is less free

than pure communism, and yet
we have, over the past few years,
forged a satisfying new closeness
with the Soviet Union." His rela
tionship with Mikhail Gorbachev
blossomed in the course of over
five meetings during Reagan's
second term.
The national debt almost
tripled in Reagan's term and he
ran up the biggest budget deficits
in history. His final budget pro
posal, released earlier this week
for the 1990 fiscal year starting
Oct. 1, projects a deficit.
