### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The United States,
Britain and France vetoed a Security Council res
olution yesterday criticizing America for shooting
down two Libyan MiG-23 war planes over the
Mediterranean last week.
The vote on the resolution — sponsored by Algeria
and the other non-aligned members of the council
— was 9-4, with Finland and Brazil abstaining.
Canada joined the other allies in voting against
the measure.
The Soviet Union, China, Ethiopia, Colombia,
Malaysia, Algeria, Nepal, Senegal and Yugoslavia
voted in favor.
Washington says two U.S. Navy F-14s acted in
self-defense in shooting down the two Libyan planes
during naval maneuvers over international waters
on Jan. 4.
As permanent members of the 15-nation council,
any one of the negative votes from the United
States, Britain or France was enough to kill the
resolution.
The vetoed resolution "deplores the downing of
the two Libyan reconnaisssance planes" and asked
the U.S. Navy to suspend maneuvers off Libya.
In Washington, a Pentagon press representative
said yesterday that aerial maneuvers scheduled in
the area were canceled, and he said plans were
changed to reduce tensions in the region.
Herbert Okun, the second-ranking U.S. ambas
sador, told the council before the vote, "These were
not unarmed Libyan reconnaissance aircraft, as this
council has been told. They were highly sophisticated
fighter aircraft, and we have shown the Security
Council and the world photographic proof that they
were armed."

Okun said pilots of the U.S. F-14 Tomcat fighters
exercised their right to fire in self-defense during
the encounter, a right nations possess under the
U.N. Charter.
U.S. Ambassador Vernon Walters on Friday dis
played photographs of one of the Libyan jets showing
shapes resembling missile pods on its wings and
fuselage.
Libya's deputy ambassador, Ali Sunni Muntasser,
said the pictures were retouched and that the planes
were unarmed reconnaissance flights.
Britain agreed that the U.S. pilots acted in self
defense. British Ambassador Sir Crispin Tickell said
the resolution was "couched in the wrong terms
and proceeds from wrong assumptions."
Canada's ambassador, Yves Fortier, said later that
the resolution contained "a one-sided account of the
incident," sentiments echoed by France's deputy rep
resentative, M. Pierre Brochand.
After the vote, Libyan Ambassador Ali Treiki told
the council that "in view of the use, or rather abuse
of the veto power by some member states, we feel
that this council has been actually paralyzed and
has not been able to take the proper action.
"The method of the big stick will not be useful,
and dialogue and the peaceful resolution of problems
is the only viable way to achieve peace."
Treiki said he hoped U.S.-Libyan relations will
improve after George Bush is inaugurated as pres
ident.
Soviet Ambassador Aleksandr Belonogov, who
voted for the resolution, was non-committal after
ward.
