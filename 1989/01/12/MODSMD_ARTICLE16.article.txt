# HUD releases federal properties for use as homeless shelters
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Depart
ment of Housing and Urban Development
yesterday released 38 federal properties
for use by state and local governments
and non-profit organizations to provide
shelters for the homeless.
The agency's action came in response
to a Dec. 14 order issued by U.S. District
Judge Oliver Gasch, who ordered HUD
to review more than 300 properties in
the General Services Administration in
ventory to determine their suitability for
use by the homeless.
The list of 17 buildings and '21 land
sites determined suitable by the agency
includes property in 23 states and Puerto
Rico.
"Today's action brings to 148 the num

ber of properties (65 buildings and 83
land sites) in GSA's inventory that HUD
had judged suitable," and completes the
agency's review, HUD said.
HUD had said earlier that 110 other
GSA properties met its minimum require
ments for physical structure, available
utilities and accessibility by road.
State and local governments and non
profit groups may submit applications to
use the properties to GSA and the De
partment of Health and Human Services
which will oversee the process by which
the properties are made available.
"It's a grudging and very small step
by HUD to implement the federal statute
and I think that there's an enormous
potential under the law," said Maria Fos

canis, counsel to the National Coalition
for the Homeless. "The federal govern
ment is a major property holder and given
a good-faith effort a lot more can be
done," she added.
HUD said it is also reviewing more
than 1600 other properties owned by
federal agencies in accordance with a
1987 law. The agency said that review
would be completed by the end of Feb
ruary.
Meanwhile, the author of a book about
life in a New York City shelter said yes
terday that housing riots may be in
America's future if state and local gov
ernments don't start building affordable
homes instead of shelters.
"We're building the biggest permanent

poorhouse in the world," author Jonathan
Kozol said at a news conference to an
nounce model state legislation to alleviate
homelessness.
"I don't know if the governors can act
independently to reverse the conse
quences of an 80 percent cut in federal
housing funds," he added. "If they can
not, the shame of New York will soon
be the shame of a nation."
Kozol, author of "Rachel and Her
Children: Homeless Families in
America," said he has visited homeless
shelters in 29 American cities, including
New York City's Martinique Hotel which
is profiled in the book.
Kozol said he senses a growing
militancy among homeless people, who

are beginning to organize politically.
"I think there's a tide of anger building
up among homeless people," he said.
"I'm afraid that we may soon see
housing riots in this country."
Kozol praised a demonstration earlier
this week by residents of the Brooklyn
Arms Hotel, another New York City
homeless shelter. The residents protested
that they are to be moved into city
housing which they say is even worse
than the hotel.
New York City is slated to close its 46
homeless hotels this year because if it
doesn't, it will lose the federal money it
has used to pay the hotel bills. Last
month, it closed the first — the Mar
tinique, in midtown Manhattan.
