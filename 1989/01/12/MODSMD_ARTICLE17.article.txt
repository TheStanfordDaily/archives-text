SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador
(AP) â€” President Jose Napoleon
Duarte yesterday announced can

cellation of next
week's Central
American sum
mit and sugges
ted it take place
the second week
of February.
Costa Rican
President Oscar
Arias on Friday
suggested the

summit, originally scheduled for
Jan. 15-16 in San Salvador, be
postponed to allow President-elect
George Bush time to create a Cen
tral American policy.

The Costa Rican government
also said it and Nicaragua, Hon
duras, El Salvador and Guatemala
needed more time to resolve exist
ing differences on implementing a
regional peace plan.
Duarte said of the reasons be
hind Arias' proposal: "Some are
valid and others are subjective."
But he said the Bush inaugura
tion "isn't a basis for delaying the
summit.
"Maybe the most valid (reason)
of all is that a summit isn't pos
sible if there isn't a preliminary
process to review the results" of
the August 1987 peace plan, he
said. A technical committee meet
ing scheduled for Tuesday in the

Nicaraguan capital of Managua
was canceled.
The presidents were to have dis
cussed the stalled peace plan they
signed in Guatemala that calls, in
part, for democratic guarantees,
political amnesties and an end to
civil wars in El Salvador, Nicara
gua and Guatemala.
The Salvadoran president ruled
out an informal meeting of the
region's leaders during the inau
guration of President-elect Carlos
Andres Perez of Venezuela on
Feb. 2, saying he will not attend
because of ongoing chemotherapy
treatment for cancer.
Duarte has been diagnosed as
having terminal liver cancer.
