WASHINGTON (AP)
President-elect Bush is summon
ing his new Cabinet together for
the first time as he nears an
nouncement of his choices for the
two top jobs that remain unfilled,
eneigy secretary and drug czar.

Bush was to preside at a dress
rehearsal meeting of his Cabinet
late this afternoon at Blair House,
the historic residence across from
the White House.
Bush aides said the vice presi
dent hoped to have a complete

team in place before the meeting
â€” or at the very least, to have
named an energy secretary. CBS
News reported last night that
former Naval commander .lames
Watkins would be tapped for the
energy job.
