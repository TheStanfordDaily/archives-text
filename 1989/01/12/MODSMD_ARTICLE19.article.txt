Child murdered; parents charged
PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A young mother was
charged yesterday with murdering her 2-month
old son and the father was charged with dismem
bering the body before the couple told police two
purse snatchers kidnapped the child.
Officers dredging suburban creeks found five
bags containing parts of Zachary Dacri's body,
including his head, police said.
Part of the body still was missing, and medical
examiners had not determined what caused the
infant's death sometime over the weekend, Capt.
Robert Grasso said.
Grasso would not say what led police to search
the waterways or whether a knife found outside
the couple's home was the murder weapon.
Police confirmed reports that the couple tem
porarily lost custody of another child on allega
tions of child abuse.
No clues from pilot of crashed 737
LONDON (AP) — Authorities questioned the
badly injured pilot of a crashed Boeing 737 yes
terday, but revealed no clues as to why the jet's
undamaged right engine was shut down well
before the crash while the other engine burned.
The Civil Aviation Authority, meanwhile, or
dered increased inspections on 37 airplanes with

CFMS6 engines, the type on the Midland Airways
jet that crashed Sunday. Investigators said much
more work was needed to pinpoint the cause of
the crash, which killed 44 people and injured 82.
The government also ordered immediate checks
of engine monitoring systems on similar aircraft
to verify that they correctly indicate right and
left, prompting speculation that a malfunctioning
alarm system could have misled the flight crew
Soviet republics ask refugees back
MOSCOW (AP) — Leaders of the strife-torn
republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan agreed yes
terday to try persuading more than 200,000 ref
ugees who fled ethnic violence to return home,
the official news agency Tass reported.
This will require "reliable guarantees of secu
rity for the people," Tass said.
About 160,000 Azerbayanis fled Christian Ar
menia and at least 90,000 Armenians fled Moslem
Azerbaijan when long-term ethnic tension broke
out in riots, arson and other violence that killed
at least 74 people in 1988.
The government and Communist Party author
ities of the two republics agreed that a turning
point is upon them, in apparent reference to the
current lull in ethnic violence, which followed the
Armenian earthquake Dec 7 that killed at least
25,000 people.
