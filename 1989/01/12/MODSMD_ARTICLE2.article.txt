## State Dept. and NSC want Soviet specialist

Rice has been offered a choice between two
high level positions in the Bush transition
team and is seriously considering accepting
one of them, Stanford sources told The
Daily yesterday.
Several sources, who wish to remain
anonymous, confirmed that the Bush ad-

ministration has unoffi
cially offered Rice the
choice between becoming
the deputy director of
policy planning at the State
Department or the Soviet
specialist at the National
Security Council.
Rice, who is currently at
tending a conference in
Jamaica, could not be

reached for comment yesterday. Her secre
tary at the Political Science Department
refused to comment on the issue, and Bush
transition officials could not be reached.
Although some sources said that Rice
has not yet decided whether to accept a
position, Rice canceled the political science
seminar that she was scheduled to teach
this quarter.
No stranger to Washington, D.C., Rice
worked for the federal government as a
consultant to the Joint Chiefs of Staff in

1986 and 1987. She has also served as a
consultant to ABC News and appears pe
riodically on the ABC news show
"Nightline" and PBS' "MacNeil/Lehrer
News Hour."
Rice seems to have kept a high profile
after the presidential election. She appeared
last month on "MacNeil/Lehrer" to com
ment on Soviet General Secretary Mikhail
Gorbachev's recent visit to New York.
Rice is known for her expertise on East-
West relations and military policy. Among
students, she is considered to be a charis
matic lecturer and an innovative teacher.
"Her most outstanding trait is her ability
to articulate to students," said Glen Tripp,
a sophomore who took Rice's fall quarter
class, "The Role of the Military in Politics."
Tripp said that Rice was so highly re
garded by students in her class that they
gave her a cake and sang "Happy Birthday"
to her on her birthday last quarter.
"I have never met her personally but I
feel like I know her," Tripp said.
The sudden announcement that Rice's
winter quarter seminar, "The Politics of
Alliance," had been canceled came to a
surprise to some of the students who had
been planning to take it.
Eric Bishop, a junior, said that he was
disappointed to learn Rice would not be
teaching the class. "You try to take any
class you can from Condi simply because
she's so dynamic," he said.
