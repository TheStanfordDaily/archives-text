### 
King's vision of the
world lives on as a real
goal for this generation

Dr. martin l. king jr.
would have been 60 years
old on Sunday.
This week's commemoration
events are an appropriate time to
stop and reflect on the man and
the meaning of his life. Given the
recent racial turmoil at Stanford,
King's birthday should have special
importance to us.
King's legacy is indelibly
stamped on our University: King
spoke here in 1967; two years ago,
Coretta Scott King spoke at Stan
ford; last year, King's daughter,
Yolanda was the keynote speaker
at the Black Student Union's
birthday celebration program; and
History Prof. Clay Carson was
honored with the task of editing
King's papers.
It was King's assassination on
April 4, 1968, that catalyzed many
of the changes that have made
Stanford a more diverse institu
tion. At a memorial service for
King in Memorial Auditorium, 10
members of the BSU walked on
stage and challenged Stanford to
honor King with action by present
ing 10 initiatives that could move
the University in the direction of
pluralism. Out of that event, many
changes were made in admissions,
faculty hiring, curriculum and res
idences.
Twenty-one years later, racism
is still a dominant topic on campus,
and it is clear that much un
finished business remains to make
King's dream a reality. The series
of events planned during the next
two weeks offer an excellent op
portunity for all of us to learn
more about the struggle that
produced a leader like Ittng, what

progress has been made and what
we can do to carry on.
The biggest event will be the
commemorative program tonight
featuring South African
anti-apartheid leader Rev. Allan
Boesak. While King is most often
remembered for being a civil rights
leader, we should never forget that
he was an international leader who
received the Nobel Peace Prize in
1963.
He often remarked that, "In jus
tice anywhere is a threat to justice
everywhere" and was actively in
volved in building support for the
freedom struggle in South Africa.
Rev. Boesak, the founder of the
largest anti-apartheid organization
in South Africa will speak on
King's impact on the international
scene and prospects for peace in
his country.
Friday's annual BSU Martin L.
King Jr. Rally will be an opportu
nity for all concerned students to
hear the perspective, views and
priorities of an organization whose
growth and development came
about in the wake of King's assas
sination.
Having read University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's essay on
racism at Stanford in 1989, the
BSU will comment on the piece
tomorrow.
Let's use this occasion as an op
portunity for dialogue, learning
and action about how best to create
the kind of society for which King
gave his life.
While it may seem like we have
been dealing with these issues for
a long time, we can't get tired yet.
While much progress has been
made at Stanford, much work re
mains to be done. We should bear
in mind the words of King in his
March on Washington speech, "No,
we are not satisfied, and we will
not be satisfied until justice rolls
down like waters and righteous
ness like a mighty stream." Keep
the dream alive.
