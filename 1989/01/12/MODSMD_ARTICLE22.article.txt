## Moral arguments will not shake white South Africa 
### 
SHORTLY before break the organi
zation Students for a Free South
Africa sponsored a week of events
at Stanford to raise community aware
ness about problems in South Africa.
Among these was a discussion of the
question "What should U.S. foreign
policy toward South Africa be?" by a
panel made up of Political Science
Prof. David Abernethy, Hoover Institu
tion Fellow Lewis Gann and graduate
student Jonathan Jansen, a black
South African in the School of Educa
tion.
Gann, the most conservative of the
panelists, had one sound argument (the
following is a paraphrase): "You may
convince a group (the Afrikaner
Nationalists) that you are more power
ful, more clever, more numerous or
more pigmented, but you will never
convince them that you are more
moral."
The fact that those who go along
with the system in South Africa feel
no moral discomfort in carrying out
their evil policies was a difficult one
for me to accept, initially.
I kept thinking that obstinancy and
greed made them hold onto their racist

programs, but that, given time and
moderate pressure, they would come to
see the truth that seems so obvious to
me (a white resident of the United
States), that it is right to have racially
unbiased laws â€” right, because life
works best that way.
Having continued to study the sub
ject, I now feel that this American
perspective expects too much of the
apartheid-supporter's imagination.
After all, for more than 300 years of
white domination, South African soci
ety has been based both economically
and philosophically on the white
citizens' belief that they are superior.
Even if persuaded to consider the
idea that law should be colorblind, the
apartheid-supporter would be
hardpressed to envision the mechanics
of such a system. His own system,
though admittedly fraught with race
related problems, is at least functional
(for him) and familiar.
So I no longer expect the apartheid
supporter to see moral Tightness in the
system I am familiar with, at least not
until after he has tried it. What will it
take to make him try it (egalitarian
society)?

It will only be when his present
system is beset by so many problems
that he imagines life in an egalitarian
society to be more enjoyable, more
comfortable and safer (in a word,
preferable) to the conditions he is then
enduring.
Short of direct revelation, this will
only happen if his present life is made
less enjoyable, comfortable and safe.
Economic sanctions target his enjoy
ment and comfort (i.e. his wealth),
armed resistance, his safety.
Sanction proposals are sometimes
met with the argument that blacks will
be hurt by sanctions, too, but listen to
what South African trade unions repre
senting more than 500,000 workers
say: Impose sanctions.
The present and increasing use of
violence against the state is repugnant
to some observers, but I suggest that
the violence perpetrated by the South
African government against those who
oppose it, is itself war.
The hundreds of deaths resulting
from the direct aggression of beatings,
shootings and torture gone too far,
together with the much greater toll
taken by the indirect violence of

starvation and disease-related deaths
among the township and bantustan
populations, constitute much more
provocation than North-American
colonists endured before feeling morally
justified in using violence to free them
selves from British rule.
Anyone who condemns armed resis
tance is, to my mind, asking the op
pressed in South Africa to suffer at
tacks without fighting back.
In conclusion, I would like to urge
readers to learn more about this sub
ject, for only through education can a
broad basis of international opposition
to the current South African system be
aroused.
I might suggest reading: T.S.
Farisani, "Diary from a South African
Prison" (Philadelphia, 1987) and Kevin
Danaher, "In Whose Interest?" (Wash
ington, D.C., 1984). I would also like
to caution them not to repeat my own
error of imposing moral expectations
on the group in power in South Africa.
Proponents of apartheid will not
share our views on racial equality and
justice until after the revolution.
