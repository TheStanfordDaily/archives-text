It is a commonplace to assert that
those who are least secure spend the
greatest time boasting of their ac
complishments. The recent spate of
hand-wringing over Stanford's position
in the club of the elite American uni
versities suggests more insecurity than
arrogance. Whatever the source, it
seems to me an empty debate.

Having attended another "elite" uni
versity as an undergraduate, I can
recall the heady excitement of admis
sion to the so-called "cream of the
crop" of American youth. I soon
learned, however, that academic excel
lence is a very limited barometer of
human talent.
Many of the future "captains of in
dustry" I met seemed as lacking in
vision and moral integrity as they were
adept at academic exercises.
In contrast, those who excelled in
personal as well as intellectual develop
ment were most likely to put their
achievements in perspective; there
would always be individuals of greater

talent and vision whose achievements
created a challenge to further striving.
Most of us, humbled by the fresh
man experience, were too concerned
with making it through our school to
worry about what other schools were
doing.
Upon graduating, it became obvious
that the name of a prestigious univer
sity carries little weight relative to
other qualifications: intellectual
creativity, integrity and leadership.
These virtues, I was fortunate to
learn, are not unique to, nor always
exemplified by, graduates of institu
tions such as mine. A college degree -
from whatever university — is, I

learned, a small step toward success.
Our value as individuals is neither
measured by, nor ends with, the insti
tutions with which we associate. Let us
look inward to assess our personal and
intellectual goals — and our progress
toward achieving them.
