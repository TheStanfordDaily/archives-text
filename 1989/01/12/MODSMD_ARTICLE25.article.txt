# Independence, instability
## 
### 
SITTING AT HOME in my Dad's
study writing this column seems
very strange indeed since I am far
from my usual domain for creativity.
Although I'll be returning to Stanford
in a few days, the Farm seems a lot
farther than three days and 3,000 miles
away, and I can't seem to make the con
nection between here and there. My va
cation of family, friends and well-deserved
rest has been a welcome break, and I am
not sure I am ready for it to end.
Actually, I am not sure I am ready to
say "good-bye" again. Saying "good-bye"
is not a fun thing to do, but it seems to
have become a regular part of my life.
In fact, I think I have said more "hellos"
and "good-byes" in the past three years
than in my first 17.
My time with people is often intense
but, unfortunately, also often limited due
to inevitable circumstances such as the
closing of a summer job, a move to a
new residence or a decision to go overseas.
I am not always sure who is going to
be around and when, and although I have
found college to be a time of strong friend
ship and personal intimacy, it is also a
time of great independence.
I debata on whether to write "indepen
dence" or "instability" since I believe both
are applicable in the above sentence, but
each carries quite a different connotation.
Independence suggests strength and
personal power, and certainly one of my
reasons for going to school far away from
home was to assert my strong indepen
dence. Instability, on the other hand, im
plies insecurity, and I do not like to think
of myself as insecure.

Looking back, however, I realize that
my independence, although leading me in
exciting new directions, has sometimes
left me with a certain degree of instability
because I am often not sure what next
quarter, next summer or even next week
will have in store for me.
High school was a lot easier than college
in this respect. I lived in the same house
and had the same friends all four years,
if not longer, since some friendships date
far back to grade school.
Although some of my friends and in
terests did change over the years, I knew
pretty well who I was and where I was,
and I knew college came next.
At Stanford, on the other hand, I have
lived in four different places and have
held two different summer jobs, both
away from home.
My years have been divided into four
distiuct parts, three academic quarters
and one summer, each with a unique
experience unto itself. Even each quarter
within one academic year seems a world
of its own, since each one brings new
activities, new emphases and new rela
tionships.
But just as each new quarter brings
new relationships, it also carries away
old ones, be they high school friends I
stop writing or freshman year hallmates
who live on the other side of campus.
Certainly, the most stimulating thing
I have discovered about Stanford and
this period of my life has been the myriad
of exceptional people I have gotten to
know and like.
But none of us have enough time to
stick with everyone we like, and this is

where the assertion of our own indepen
dence comes into play.
We each need to structure our own
lives in the manner we deem best for
ourselves, and I do this hoping my path
will still cross that of my friends.
Those friends most important to me I
will always weave into my plans and fu
ture, but many others I will lose along
the way.
The true instability lies, however, when
we see our closest friends fade out of our
lives, whether permanently or temporar
y-
Many high school friends I am out of
touch with and most of my closest Stan
ford friends have travelled abroad this
year, leaving me feeling somewhat
deserted.
1 have begun to realize I am perhaps
not quite as independent as I think I am,
but I am not as scared to admit this as
I used to be.
I usually find the excitement, "busy
ness" and instability of college invigorat
ing, but it can also be draining. And
when I am feeling drained, there is noth
ing more soothing than the stability of
home, where life is generally as expected,
but where "good-byes" are still ines
capable.
