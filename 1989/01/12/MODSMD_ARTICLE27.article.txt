## Rethinking our leadership after 'the year the earth screamed' 
### 
PEOPLE in the Stanford commu
nity, you and I, command greatly
disproportionate shares of the
world's deteriorating natural and cul
tural resources — compared to millions
of people who live, without hope, in
utter poverty and disease in communi
ties around the world.
We live and work in a social and
economic system which generally has
allowed us to assume that basic re
sources like our air, water, shelters
and foods will not harm our bodies,
and that our friends, families and
careers are secure so long as we
remain lawful.
Today this privilege of fate carries
with it a personal responsibility: to
look inward and ask ourselves honestly
what kind of world we wish to live in
and what kind of commitment we will
make to create that world.
Decisions about how we live and
work now will determine qualities of
fellow and future lives more directly
and profoundly than ever before.
For nearly a century Stanford has
cultivated and harvested what many
feel are the best young minds in the
world — people whose contributions to
human knowledge, to political institu
tions and to economic prosperity can

be described variously as heroic, epo
chal or simply unique.
Stanford has taught many of the
world's leaders how to think, how to
progress and how to extend prosperity
around the planet.
The University's global influence and
financial wealth testify to its success
within our cultural and economic
system. The Stanford community,
along with its present and future
progeny, its students, can say proudly
that it fulfills its mandate in our
system with each graduating class.
But I ask that each of you who
receives the benefits of security, health
and power from this community take
some time in this New Year to ask
whether your concept of the system in
which you will succeed is broad
enough.
The year 1988 is already being called
in the popular media "the year the
planet screamed." More accurately,
1988 was the year the popular media
chose to take notice of an escalating
desecration of planetary life that has
been chronicled and decried continu
ously for at least 20 years.
Ozone depletion has been reported in
national scientific journals for nearly a
decade. Climate change and its rela-

tionship to atmospheric carbon dioxide
has been published since at least 1974.
The insanity — let alone the eco
nomic inefficiency —• of massive tropi
cal deforestation has been denounced
internationally since the late 1970'5.
Population-, war- and drought
induced starvation in Africa, Asia and
Central America have been linked to
misguided investment and industrial
agriculture policies for years.
Yet by throwing these and many
other crises in our faces today, the
popular media are finally expressing in
the most blatant terms what the
earth's ecosystems have been telling us
since at least World War 11.
We need to realize that if we want
to "succeed" in terms at all meaningful
to out species, we must broaden our
concept of the social and economic
system in which our aspirations are set
to its natural limits, i.e., to a bios
pheric level.
The biosphere is the skin of the
earth in which all life forms, including
you and I, exist.
It should go without saying that we
are just as dependent on the healthy
functioning of the living systems
around us as any other species of life.
The year 1988 simply popularized

how vulnerable our accustomed system
is to a global environment whose
capacity to provide basic "goods" for
humans is in jeopardy — precisely
because of that system's disregard for
its natural, biospheric, ties.
Many economists and corporate
executives, for example, still laugh at
attempts to factor into profit functions
"utility services" provided by forests,
rivers, soils and wetlands, or "costs"
involved when those services are no
longer provided on demand.
Who currently accounts for decreased
corporate profits accompanying the loss
of carbon dioxide absorption when
rainforests are razed?
On whose ledgers, in which nations
and in whose generations will these
costs surface?
Yet short-term financial profit is still
a primary criterion for success — in
our system.
But now, and forever after, I would
ask you to re-consider your aspirations
in the context of a world now demand
ing you to ensure that the basic goods
you thought were given — safe air,
clean water, warm shelter and non
toxic food — will derive directly from
your own choices: how you work and
live, what you consume and how you

return to your environment that which
is given you each day.
These choices do not differ in kind
from those which we make each day as
active members of the Stanford com
munity: We are all eager seekers of
our own prosperity.
But whether we continue to lead in
a world worth leading depends on
whether we conceive our aspirations
within a complex global ecosystem that
encompasses, pervades and informs our
conventional "economic" activities.
The year 1988 was the year in
which our margin for error, either by
hubris or by ignorance, became pal
pably slim.
The terms economy and ecology stem
from the same Greek root, oikos,
meaning "household".
Since the earth is our only true
household, we would do best to fit
nomos, the counting and naming of
goods within the household, within
logos, the logic and rules of this won
drous, fragile domain.

But now, and forever after, I would
ask you to re-consider your aspirations
in the context of a world now demand
ing you to ensure that the basic goods
you thought were given — safe air,
clean water, warm shelter and non
toxic food — will derive directly from
your own choices: how you work and
live, what you consume and how you

return to your environment that which
is given you each day.
These choices do not differ in kind
from those which we make each day as
active members of the Stanford com
munity: We are all eager seekers of
our own prosperity.
But whether we continue to lead in
a world worth leading depends on
whether we conceive our aspirations
within a complex global ecosystem that
encompasses, pervades and informs our
conventional "economic" activities.
The year 1988 was the year in
which our margin for error, either by
hubris or by ignorance, became pal
pably slim.
The terms economy and ecology stem
from the same Greek root, oikos,
meaning "household".
Since the earth is our only true
household, we would do best to fit
nomos, the counting and naming of
goods within the household, within
logos, the logic and rules of this won
drous, fragile domain.

PEOPLE in the Stanford commu
nity, you and I, command greatly
disproportionate shares of the
world's deteriorating natural and cul
tural resources — compared to millions
of people who live, without hope, in
utter poverty and disease in communi
ties around the world.
We live and work in a social and
economic system which generally has
allowed us to assume that basic re
sources like our air, water, shelters
and foods will not harm our bodies,
and that our friends, families and
careers are secure so long as we
remain lawful.
Today this privilege of fate carries
with it a personal responsibility: to
look inward and ask ourselves honestly
what kind of world we wish to live in
and what kind of commitment we will
make to create that world.
Decisions about how we live and
work now will determine qualities of
fellow and future lives more directly
and profoundly than ever before.
For nearly a century Stanford has
cultivated and harvested what many
feel are the best young minds in the
world — people whose contributions to
human knowledge, to political institu
tions and to economic prosperity can

be described variously as heroic, epo
chal or simply unique.
Stanford has taught many of the
world's leaders how to think, how to
progress and how to extend prosperity
around the planet.
The University's global influence and
financial wealth testify to its success
within our cultural and economic
system. The Stanford community,
along with its present and future
progeny, its students, can say proudly
that it fulfills its mandate in our
system with each graduating class.
But I ask that each of you who
receives the benefits of security, health
and power from this community take
some time in this New Year to ask
whether your concept of the system in
which you will succeed is broad
enough.
The year 1988 is already being called
in the popular media "the year the
planet screamed." More accurately,
1988 was the year the popular media
chose to take notice of an escalating
desecration of planetary life that has
been chronicled and decried continu
ously for at least 20 years.
Ozone depletion has been reported in
national scientific journals for nearly a
decade. Climate change and its rela-

tionship to atmospheric carbon dioxide
has been published since at least 1974.
The insanity — let alone the eco
nomic inefficiency —• of massive tropi
cal deforestation has been denounced
internationally since the late 1970'5.
Population-, war- and drought
induced starvation in Africa, Asia and
Central America have been linked to
misguided investment and industrial
agriculture policies for years.
Yet by throwing these and many
other crises in our faces today, the
popular media are finally expressing in
the most blatant terms what the
earth's ecosystems have been telling us
since at least World War 11.
We need to realize that if we want
to "succeed" in terms at all meaningful
to out species, we must broaden our
concept of the social and economic
system in which our aspirations are set
to its natural limits, i.e., to a bios
pheric level.
The biosphere is the skin of the
earth in which all life forms, including
you and I, exist.
It should go without saying that we
are just as dependent on the healthy
functioning of the living systems
around us as any other species of life.
The year 1988 simply popularized

how vulnerable our accustomed system
is to a global environment whose
capacity to provide basic "goods" for
humans is in jeopardy — precisely
because of that system's disregard for
its natural, biospheric, ties.
Many economists and corporate
executives, for example, still laugh at
attempts to factor into profit functions
"utility services" provided by forests,
rivers, soils and wetlands, or "costs"
involved when those services are no
longer provided on demand.
Who currently accounts for decreased
corporate profits accompanying the loss
of carbon dioxide absorption when
rainforests are razed?
On whose ledgers, in which nations
and in whose generations will these
costs surface?
Yet short-term financial profit is still
a primary criterion for success — in
our system.
But now, and forever after, I would
ask you to re-consider your aspirations
in the context of a world now demand
ing you to ensure that the basic goods
you thought were given — safe air,
clean water, warm shelter and non
toxic food — will derive directly from
your own choices: how you work and
