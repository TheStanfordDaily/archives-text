Three quarks for Muster Mark!
Sure he hasn't got much of a bark
And sure any he has it's all beside
the mark.
— "Finnegans Wake"
James Joyce
James Joyce — a master of lan
guage — may seem irrelevant to
the field of particle physics. But,
in fact, Joyce provided a most sig
nificant addition to the language
of modern physics. Muster Mark's
quarks are now the domain of
high-tech scientists. Quarks are
now defined as the fundamental
particles composing basic atomic
matter.
Physicists use the word quark?
Nonsense.
Well, as a matter of fact, the
German word for nonsense is
quark. But Nobel laureate Murray
Gell-Mann, who first theorized
the existence of the particle and
named it, told me that the Joyce
book, not the German word, in
spired the naming of the quark.
Well, this has a lot of charm,
but what does it all mean?
Clever pun. As you must know,
charm is the word physicists use
to describe a property of the
quarks.
No, I didn't know that. It
sounds like this language of
physicists has a lot of color, but
I'm detecting a bit of strangeness
about it, too.
There you go again. To
physicists, particles exhibit prop
erties of color and strangeness,
like the attribute of charm.
Color, however, does not mean
color in the fashion catalogue

sense. Instead, the word color
defines an abstract property that
differentiates some particles from
others, but might sound a bit
strange — oopg, unusual — to
the non-physicist.
I guess I really have to watch
what I say around physicists, but
this whole business of particle
physics intrigues me. 1 haven't
said anything wrong again, have
I?
No, you're doing just fine.
I'd like to learn more. I'm just
starting to get the flavor ...
Hold it right there. Flavor
describes another one of these
abstract properties of particles.
Who thought of all of this
weird stuff, anyway?
Well, a number of people devel
oped this whole language. Gell-
Mann was the one who started
giving funny names to new prop
erties of particles and theories.
Gell-Mann told me he came up
with the idea for strange particles
in 1953.
A decade later Gell-Mann came
up with the Eightfold Way, a
scheme to organize the myriad of
particles that had been found by
physicists into a simpler theory.
Why, that's the Buddhist belief
that you must follow the eight
fold path to higher wisdom!
Right views, right aspirations,
right speech, right conduct, right
livelihood, right effort, right
mindfulness and right ... I can't
seem to remember the last one.
Keep contemplating, you'll get
it. Gell-Mann did not just stop
with the Eightfold Way. In the
19605, Gell-Mann also named
quarks and introduced color into
the equation.
As if that wasn't enough, he

gave the name quantum
chromodynamics to his theory ex
plaining color. The name of Gell-
Mann's theory is a spin-off from
the name quantum electro
dynamics, another theory of par
ticle physics.
Well, the name quantum
chromodynamics seems to be the
bottom of the barrel.
Not quite. Actually, bottom is
another word to describe certain
quarks. Bottom quarks are the
opposites of top quarks.
I would have guessed that.

But would you have guessed
that physicists have actually come
up with the description for one
particle as a naked bottom?
What?!? A naked bottom?
That's for real?
Stanford Physics Prof. Ann Nel
son. a theorist, told me that's a
personal favorite of hers. Naked
bottoms are uncovered so to speak
when a bottom quark gets to
gether with its so-called anti
quark, and the bottom property
cancels, leaving it naked.
In the same way, we create hid

den charm by combining a
charmed quark with its antipar
ticle.
I'm beginning to change my
mind about this whole thing. I'm
not sure I like these theories.
They all seem to be rather weak.
Not exactly. We have dealt
mostly with predictions of strong
theories, not weak theories.
You might not have known this,
but strong and weak refer to two
of the four fundamental forces of
nature. They are both short-range
forces operating within the nu
cleus of the atom.
Look, I don't think I'm sure
of anything anymore. What I was
trying to say about these theories
is that they seem to be more a
matter of linguistics than
physics. They seem to have no
guts to them.
Au contraire. They do have
GUTs. Grand unified theories,
that is. They make all of this mess
even easier than it was before.
Using elegant mathematics, three
of the four fundamental forces are
described as a single force, making
the universe simpler.
GUTs have not been proved yet.
If they are, they could well explain
the basic physics governing the
development of this universe since
a small fraction of a second after
the Big Bang. The only force
physicists have not yet reconciled
with these GUTs is gravity.
I suppose if they figured
gravity into this whole mess, they
would have the Theory of Every
thing.
So you do know something
about this matter! In fact,
physicists are looking for the The
ory of Everything . . .
Oh, that's just super!
Superstring, actually.
What?
The theory is known as the su
perstring theory. The whole affair
is quite complicated and

physicists really haven't done very
much with the theory because the
mathematics are so intricate.
They have done enough, though,
to know that superstring looks
like a very good candidate for the
Theory of Everything.
It turns out that certain parti
cles, like the electron, look very
much like points, with no width.
Unfortunately, physicists have
run into problems with calcula
tions using point particles. In
their calculations, they find nasty
infinities which are physically
meaningless.
Theorists discovered that if par
ticles are visualized as tiny strings
instead of points, particles could
be described without these frus
trating infinities.
This whole thing is getting sil
lier and sillier. I certainly haven't
seen any of these strings that
you are talking about.
That's because these strings
would be very small indeed. A
reminder string you might tie
around your finger would be
about a million billion billion bil
lion times the size of a string in
this theory.
Since we seem to be talking
quite a lot about names, why in
the universe did physicists name
this theory the superstring the
ory, rather than the string the
ory?
Well, the theory was an out
growth of other theories, includ
ing one known as the super
symmetry theory — thus, the pre
fix super. One of the predictions
of this theory, was that for each
particle that we have so far ob
served, another as-yet-unobserved
particle should exist.
Supersymmetry theorists,
known as supersymmetrists, were
left to name their additional par
ticles. The convention was to add
the suffix -ino to the names of
the already known particles.
Thus, a graviton's partner was
a gravitino and a photon's partner
was a photino. The naming went
so far as to name the partner of
a particle, called the Higgs boson,
the Shiggson. That was even too
much for the master of weird
words, Gell-Mann.
What about the name of the
neutrino partner? Is it the
neutrino-ino?
Not exactly. To get around some
awkward names, supersym
metrists sometimes put the letter
sin front of the name, creating
particles such as squarks. The
neutrino's partner became the
sneutrino rather than the
neutrino-ino. Sometimes the word
sneutrino was condensed to just
sneut.
It seems we're dealing with a
kind of Alice and Wonderland
world.
Funny you should say that. Mi
chael Riordan, spokesperson for
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, told me the exact same
thing.
In fact, Riordan wrote an in
teresting book on particle physics
with the title "The Hunting of
the Quark," a spin-off of the
Lewis Carroll title "The Hunting
of the Snark." It really is a strange
world we live in.
