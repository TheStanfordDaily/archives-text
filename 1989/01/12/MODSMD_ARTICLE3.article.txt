# Defacers of Ujamaa posters suspended from student dorms
## 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
The two freshmen who drew
derogatory features of a black man on a
poster in the University's black theme
house are being punished with banish
ment from any student residence commu
nity for two quarters, Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Norm Robinson said yes
terday.
Ben Dugan and Gus Heldt learned of
the announcement in a Jan. 9 letter from
Robinson.
This punishment, handed down from
the Office of Residential Education, is
"wholly separate from the University jud
icial process," Robinson wrote. The Jud
icial Affairs Office is still considering
whether the students' acts violated the
rules of student conduct outlined by the

Fundamental Standard and whether
Stanford's disciplinary process should be
invoked against them.
Robinson wrote that the freshmen's

behavior in Ujamaa
House violated the Stan
ford Residence Agree
ment, which requires
that students treat
others in University res
idences with respect. It
is signed by every stu
dent in University
housing.
Prior to the incident,

Dugan lived in Ujamaa and Heldt lived
in the neighboring dorm of Naranja
House. Following their confession of
defacing the poster in October, University
officials moved the two freshmen to a
guest room in the eastern end of Florence

Moore Hall. They are currently living
there.
Robinson wrote that they "violated
[their] undertaking to be considerate of
other residents and to respect their rights
at all times."
A violation of the housing agreement
"is grounds for the immediate termina
tion of your occupancy and/or the with
drawal of future University housing
privileges."
Robinson added that fall quarter
counted as one of their banned quarters.
During winter quarter, Robinson decided,
the freshmen can petition him to allow
them back into University housing for
spring quarter. They cannot petition to
return to Lagunita Hall, where Ujamaa
and Naranja are located.
Robinson said the punishment means
Dugan and Heldt are officially not mem

bers of any University resident house.
They are not entitled to participate in
any house meeting or in house govern
ment. They also cannot make use of any
resident fellows or resident assistants, al
though Robinson did not say if that meant
RFs or RAs would refuse to interact with
the two freshmen.
Robinson said the freshmen are on a
University Food Service meal plan and
are allowed to eat anywhere on campus,
with the exception of the dining center
in Lagunita Hall. Before dining there
they have been instructed to contact the
residence dean of that complex, Ron Hud
son. They must have Hudson's permis
sion before visiting anyone in Lagunita.
While Dugan and Heldt had no com
ment yesterday, Robinson said he thought
the punishment was appropriate.
Some students at Ujamaa disagreed,

however. Junior Canetta Ivy said the pun
ishment just amounts to allowing the two
to move to another house.
In contrast, sophomore Marilyn Metz
called Robinson's decision an "overreac
tion." She said, "The two students are
getting the brunt of what the University
is trying to make as an example."
Sophomore Raina Jackson added that
she thought the "whole problem is
deeper" than what punishment the two
receive. "Their whole attitude needs to
be changed. . . . There needs to be more
education and understanding and
tolerance," she said.
Robinson said that although students
in the past have been banished from res
idences, it was unusual for freshmen to
incur such punishment.


Robinson
Robinson wrote that he came
to his decision for punishment
after reading the fact-finding
report commisioned by University
President Donald Kennedy fall
quarter to investigate the incident
at Ujamaa.
Robinson said he did not think

this punishment would serve to
rehabilitate the two. Rather, he
said he hoped the entire experi
ence would be one from which
thev could learn.
Dugan and Heldt's defacing of
a Ludwig van Beethoven poster
in late September was one of two
highly publicized racist incidents
in Ujamaa last quarter. The other
incident involved the discovery in
October of the word "nigger"
scrawled on a poster.
