## 
### Jamie Green 
Three years ago Bishop Tutu
spoke here. Two years ago Jesse
Jackson visited and last year it
was Yolanda King. This year, as
part of the various campus
events commemorating Martin
Luther King Jr. Day, the Rev.
Allan Boesak, a prominent South
African anti-apartheid leader
and world figure will speak in
Memorial Auditorium tonight at
7:30 p.m.
"People will have the chance
to witness a part of history just
by simply being at this pro
gram," said Keith Archuleta, as
sistant dean of Student Affairs
and director of the Black Com
munity Service Center.
In his speech, Boesak will dis
cuss the continuing impact of
King and the Civil Rights Move
ment on international human re
lations, as well as prospects for
non-violent opposition to apart
heid in South Africa.
Boesak, who has been jailed
three times for his opposition to
apartheid, will speak about what
is currently happening in South
Africa. Boesak's talk is a rare
chance for people to hear
firsthand information they can
not receive from the press, ac

cording to Tim Pinkston, presi
dent of the Black Graduate Stu
dent Organization.
Since June 1986 — when the
South African government
declared a state of emergency —
reporters, both local and inter
national, have been severely
restricted in what and about
whom they can report, causing
a so-called "news blackout."
Pinkston added that Boesak is
a "dynamic speaker," with power
and force comparable to King.
Born in Kakemas Cape, South
Africa in 1946, Boesak was ed
ucated at the University of the
Western Cape in Cape Town and
received Doctor of Divinity
Degrees from Victoria University
in Toronto and Yale University.
Boesak has written five books
and is the Chaplain of the Uni
versity of the Western Cape. Ac
cording to Jonathan Jansen, a
Stanford graduate student from
South Africa, his work continues
to inspire student activists.
Boesak is frequently consulted
by world political leaders on
theological and political issues
because he is highly respected
for his powerful preaching and
his scholarly exposition on the
Bible. Likewise, he has earned
respect worldwide for his out

spoken struggle within South
Africa and around the world
against the evils of racism, es
pecially as it has taken a violent,
institutional form in his own
country.
Boesak is pastor of a Capetown
church and moderator of the
Colored Dutch Reformed Church
denomination as well. He is also
a founder of the United Demo
cratic Front, South Africa's lar
gest anti-apartheid coalition,
which includes about 700 activist
groups including churches and
labor organizations.
Boesak also heads the World
Alliance of Reformed Churches,
the world's largest Protestant
group, represents about 70 mil
lion Christians. In his role as
president, he was the key author
of this organization's declaration
of apartheid as heresy. The
church has used the declaration
to oppose apartheid it as being
contrary to God's justice and the
Gospel of Jesus Christ.
Boesak has received several in
ternational awards for human
rights, including the Robert Ken
nedy Foundation award.
Boesak's speech will end
around 8:45 p.m, at which time
people will be encouraged to ask

questions until 10:00. People
who cannot find seats in
Memorial Auditorium can watch
the address on television screens
in Bishop Auditorium at the
Business School, located next to
Memorial Auditorium.
Archuleta encouraged all stu
dents to attend this event."It is

a tremendous chance to learn
what you cannot learn in a class
room," he said. "The King
holiday is a good time for stu
dents to reflect on the racial sit
uation and struggle at Stanford,
in America and in the world, and
try to understand where that
struggle comes from,"he added.
