On Jan. 1 1959, Fidel Castro's
nationalist guerrilla army took
power in Cuba. It was an event
which shook the hemisphere.
The bottom line of U.S. policy
towards Latin America has ever
since read "No More Cubas"—no
more socialist threats to U.S. he
gemony in the Americas.
In the weeks following the 13th
anniversary of the Cuban revolu
tion, scholars, policy makers and
journalists have been pausing to
assess the "Cuban model," to take
a hard look at the accomplish
ments and failings of Cuba's
socialist regime.
Among the several new books
which contribute to this assess
ment, perhaps the most scathingly
critical is "Insider: My Hidden
Life as a Revolutionary in Cuba."
The autobiography of Cuban
defector Jose Luis Llovio-
Menendez, "Insider" is highly
readable, laced with bureaucratic
intrigue, romance and suspense.
As a student in Havana during
the late 19605, Llovio-Menendez
joined the growing revolutionary
protests against Cuban dictator
Fulgencio Batista. Then, he tem
porarily left Cuba for studies in
France, where he eloped with a
French heiress.
Llovio-Menendez returned to
Cuba in 1965 in hopes of freeing
an uncle who was among those
imprisoned for their counter
revolutionary politics during
Castro's early years in power.
Instead of freeing his uncle,
however, Llovio-Menendez became

'Insider' offers a
rare glimpse of the
operations of the
Cuban government.

trapped in Cuba. Disguising his
loathing of the communist sys
tem, he used his old revolutionary
connections to ascend the ranks
of the Cuban bureaucracy until
finally, some 16 years later, he
obtained permission to travel
abroad and had an opportunity to
defect.
During these years in Cuba,
Llovio-Menendez served as an in
ternal informant for the govern
ment, was arrested and sent to a
work camp, and was later released
and appointed to important posi
tions in the Ministry of Culture
and Sugar Ministry.
Sometimes Llovio-Menendez's
story seems improbable, espe
cially to those familiar with Cuba.
For example, it seems unlikely
that the class conscious Cuban
revolutionary elite of the 1960s
would have so readily trusted a
man who had forsaken the revo
lution for a bourgeois education
and marriage abroad.
One also wonders whether
Llovio-Menendez was quite as
trapped as he implies.
Yet even if, as some critics have
insinuated, there is more to
Llovio-Menendez's story than he
cares to tell, there is something
to be learned from this book.
Llovio-Menendez offers us a
rare glimpse of the internal oper
ations of the Cuban government.
His description emphasizes the
pervasive inefficiency of the bu

reaucracy, the importance of
cliques and patron-client net
works, and the nomenklatura
process used to make political ap
pointments. These are all charac
teristic features of communist
systems, including the Soviet Un
ion, after which much of the
Cuban government and Cuban
Communist Party are patterned.

In addition, Llovio-Menendez
relates several frank and insight
ful conversations with Fidel
Castro, the famous revolutionary
Marxist theorist "Che" Guevara
and Raul Castro, Fidel's youngest
brother and second-in-command.
Fidel Castro, often portrayed in
literature on Cuba as an egoist,
a maverick and a megalomaniac,
is presented here as a dictator who
has driven Cuba into militarized
austerity with his ill-begotten de
velopment plans.
Llovio-Menendez describes
Cuba's revolutionary elite more
generally as a class of corrupt and
incompetent men who use state
funds to live in a style which
makes a mockery of much
vaunted Cuban social equality.
Llovio-Menendez sets out to
persuade his readers that he is
an innocent victim of Cuban
totalitarianism, forced to hide his
thoughts and feelings from col
leagues, friends and even family
lest they betray him to the gov
ernment.
This, however, is where the
book's cathartic agenda begins to
warp its depiction of Cuban life.
Though the Cuban government
places strict limits on civic
freedoms and political op
position—disallowing, for exam
ple, the development of even a
Mexican style competitive party
system—it is not the unremit
tingly watchful Big Brother that

Llovio sets out to
persuade his
readers that he is a
victim of Cuban
totalitarianism.

Llovio-Menendez would have us
believe.
Somewhat ironically, Llovio-
Menendez's emphasis on the to
talitarian nature of the Cuban
system leads him to recommend
that the United States engage in
discussions towards normaliza
tion of its relations with Cuba.
He hopes that renewed U.S. trade
and tourism might expose Cubans
to a consumer society and liberal
values, thereby underscoring the
economic failures of Cuba's
socialist government, and increas
ing popular pressure for change.
This recommendation stands in
sharp contrast to that of the many
exiles in the Cuban American
community who have consistently
and vociferously opposed nor
malization. Indeed, they have ad
vocated sharper U.S. trade sanc
tions and asked for renewed ef
forts to isolate the Castro regime
politically.
When all is said and done, the
insights Llovio-Menendez offers
are worth having, but they must
be carefully separated from a
great deal of ideological chaff.
In this dilemma, at least, "In
sider" offers an accurate reflec
tion of thirty years of Cuban his
tory.
