"Fidel and Religion: Castro Talks
on Revolution and Religion with
Frei Betto"
by Frei Betto with Fidel Castro
Introduction by Harvey Cox
Simon and Schuster, $8.95
Reviewed by Shelly McConnell
When Fidel Castro gave a
lengthy interview in 1986 expres
sing a conciliatory position on re
ligion, the resulting book not sur
prisingly became an international
bestseller.
It is an accepted tenet of Marx
ist thought that religion is "the
opiate of the people" and anti
thetical to socialism. In practice,
socialist states have, to varying
degrees and in numerous ways,
denied their societies religious
freedom.
But "Fidel and Religion," now
translated into English, seems to
signal a change.
Castro's 23 hour interview with
Frei Betto, a Brazilian priest, took
place in Havana over .a period of
several days. In his discussion,
Castro touches upon a broad
range of topics, from Castro's
childhood and Jesuit education to
policy recommendations on Latin
America's foreign debt.
Some of this material, such as
Castro's perspective on American
liberal democracy, has been cov
ered in his previous interviews
and speeches.
But there is a great deal of new
information here, and for those
interested in Cuba, religion or
socialism, "Fidel and Religion" is
well worth reading.

The book signals
that religion is no
longer 'outside'
Castro's revolution.

In the interview, Castro reaf
firms that he is not a religious
believer. But his central message
is that Marxist revolutionaries
need not oppose religion per se,
only its classist manifestations.
Thus, for example, Castro in
sists that his regime expelled
Catholic priests after the 1959
revolution not because of their
religious role, but because the
Catholic Church ministered pri
marily to the rich, and its
bourgeois patrons tried to use the
Church as a tool against the revo
lution.
In his very useful introduction,
Harvey Cox of Harvard Divinity
School describes the changed po
litical context that allowed Castro
to express these seemingly unor :
thodox views.
First, notes Cox, by the end of
the 19605, the need for Castro to
take a confrontational posture
towards the Catholic Church was
obviated by the consolidation of
Cuba's revolutionary regime and
the declining strength of the
church in Cuba.
Second, after the historic 1968
conference of Latin American bis
hops in Medellin, Colombia, the
Catholic Church altered its role

ST JR • ,
in Latin America so that it might
better serve the poor. The newly
developed doctrine of Liberation
Theology linked Christiatfity to
the struggle for a more equal so
ciety, the philosophical essence of
socialist revolution.
Third, the 1979 Marxist revo
lution in neighboring Nicaragua
was widely supported by Chris
tians, and several of its top leaders
are priests. Whether or not Castro
is persuaded that religion is com
patible with Marxist revolution,
it would be less than politic to
undercut his Nicaraguan allies by
publicly asserting that it is not.
Theoretically speaking, Mar
xism and religion make poor bed
fellows. Marxist metaphysics
acclaims an economic and political
rather than a divine redemption,
and posits class struggle as the
"motor" of history in the place of
a grand design. Marx suggested
that religion would be abolished
under communism, lest it serve
as a basis for inequality in owner
ship, or stand in the way of
proletarian fraternity.
Yet both Castro and, to a lesser
extent, Betto, seem content to
brush aside these theoretical con
cerns. They treat the compatibil
ity of Marxism and religion
strictly as a question of whether
or not religious institutions oper
ate in the service of the poor.
This framework certainly begs
the question of religious free
dom—it takes a more conciliatory
position only with respect to those
religious groups that practice in
accordance with Marxist revolu
tionary values. It upholds Castro's

"outside" of Castro's revolution.
To the extent that churches share
the Cuban revolution's values,
Castro can envision them in a co
operative though not close rela
tionship with the Cuban Com
munist Party.
This gain may seem limited to
American liberals, who would
prefer that religious practice be
an inalienable right, respected
even when the Church is in con
flict with the state. But Castro's
message holds out hope to reli
gious believers in the socialist
world.
What remains to be seen is
whether Castro's verbal gesture
will translate into concrete sup

"Fidel and Religion: Castro Talks
on Revolution and Religion with
Frei Betto"
by Frei Betto with Fidel Castro
Introduction by Harvey Cox
Simon and Schuster, $8.95
Reviewed by Shelly McConnell
When Fidel Castro gave a
lengthy interview in 1986 expres
sing a conciliatory position on re
ligion, the resulting book not sur
prisingly became an international
bestseller.
It is an accepted tenet of Marx
ist thought that religion is "the
opiate of the people" and anti
thetical to socialism. In practice,
socialist states have, to varying
degrees and in numerous ways,
denied their societies religious
freedom.
But "Fidel and Religion," now
translated into English, seems to
signal a change.
Castro's 23 hour interview with
Frei Betto, a Brazilian priest, took
place in Havana over .a period of
several days. In his discussion,
Castro touches upon a broad
range of topics, from Castro's
childhood and Jesuit education to
policy recommendations on Latin
America's foreign debt.
Some of this material, such as
Castro's perspective on American
liberal democracy, has been cov
ered in his previous interviews
and speeches.
But there is a great deal of new
information here, and for those
interested in Cuba, religion or
socialism, "Fidel and Religion" is
well worth reading.
