# Jimmy Santiago Baca comes to Stanford
## 
### 
New Mexican Chicano poet Jimmy Santiago Baca will read
from his highly-acclaimed "Martin and Meditations on the South
Valley" on Monday, Jan. 6 at 4:15 p.m. in the History Building,
room 2.
Championed by Stanford poet Denise Levertov, who first met
Baca while he was serving a stint in jail, Baca is an important,
original voice in American poetry and his appearance at Stanford
shouldn't be missed.
Baca's first work appeared in the progressive magazine
"Mother Jones " In 1977, he published "Immigrants in Our
Own Land," a collection of poetry. In 1986, he received a National
Endowment for the Arts fellowship.
Long, narrative epics are generally hard to find in the con
temporary literary landscape. Baca, however, has beautifully
chronicled the cultural presence of the American Southwest in
long, brilliantly-controlled poems whose compression and fluidity
testify that narrative power need not preclude poetic vision.
Baca's poems describe a life of hardship and loss, but these
are also poems of perseverence, poems that sensitively find paths
of opportunity in what may seem an unredeemable environment.
Baca has that rare and remarkable ability to integrate charged
political views with a powerful aesthetic vision.
In his autobiographical "Meditations on the South Valley,"
Baca describes a hero who draws himself up from a troubled
childhood and eventually achieves peace with his magical, south
western world.
As he builds his own house, the character, Martin, creates
his own identity out of sheer force of will: 1 gave birth to a
house," writes Baca,
It came, cried from my hands, sweated from my body,
ached from my gut and back. 1 was stripped down to
the essential
force in my lifeâ€”create a better world, a better me
out of love. I became a child of the house,
and it showed me
the freedom of a new beginning."
Andrei Codrescu recently noted on National Public Radio that
a Baca reading he attended "was a stunning performance that
had the audience shaking with grief and laughter."
Baca's performance at Stanford, and his forthcoming "Black
Mesa Poems," promise to be just as exciting.
