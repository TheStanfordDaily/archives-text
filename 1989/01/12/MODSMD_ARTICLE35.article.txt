## Reveno revels in basketball's change of fortune 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
Eric Reveno remembers the dark days
of Stanford men's basketball. Back when
empty seats were more prevalent than
fans at Maples Pavilion, and made about
as much noise.
"It's very different (now) than from
my freshman year, when we won three
Pac-10 games," the 6-foot-8 senior cen
ter says. "It's a hell of a lot more fun,
too."
But times change. The 21st-ranked
Cardinal (10-3 overall, 3-1 in the Pac-10)
has already matched its three Pac-10
conference wins of 1984-85, and is tied
for second as it travels to Seattle to
play Washington (4-7, 1-2) tonight at
7:30 p.m. at Hec Edmundson Pavilion.
People change too. In 1984-85, at the
tender age of 18, Reveno averaged just
3.8 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
But now, at a venerable 22 years,
Reveno has upped those averages to 9.0
ppg and 5.8 rpg.
But statistics don't tell sufficiently
how far Reveno has come. The Atherton
native, who teamed with former Stan
ford guard (and quarterback) John Paye
to win the California Division II state
championship in 1982-83 at The Menlo
School, is now counted on to rise to the
occasion whenever necessary, picking up
the team when it's coming up short.
The Cardinal hasn't tripped up much
lately, as it's riding a five-game winning
streak. But it was Reveno who was
forced to pick up the load as Stanford
struggled against UCLA last Dec. 23.
With forward Howard Wright suffer
ing through an off-night and All-
America candidate Todd Lichti being
smothered on defense by Pooh Richard
son, Reveno kept Stanford in the game
by scoring a season-high 20 points.
Reveno did most of his damage with
his jump hook, which may look awkward
but is actually a solid offensive weapon.
"It's my most effective shot," he says.
"If the defense isn't dictating what I
should shoot, then I shoot my jump

hook. ... I like to think I can shoot a
turn-around jumper, but the jump hook
is my best shot. I might as well shoot
that until the defense forces me to do
otherwise."
Still, the first thing Reveno would
say about the UCLA game, which Stan
ford lost 74-70, is that the defeat over
shadowed his performance. The second
thing he'd say is that his performance
wasn't even up to his standards.
Reveno shot 8-for-17 on the night,
which means that while he was scoring,
he wasn't playing effectively. He kept
Stanford in the game, but could have
done even more.
Expect this to happen less as the
season progresses, and Reveno becomes
more and more adjusted to game situ
ations after redshirting all of 1987-88
due to a spinal and back condition.
"Physically, I was ready for the com
petition," Reveno says."(But) I think
I hadn't really played really structured
basketball in a long time. ... Hopefully,
(my timing] will keep improving
throughout the season."

In one respect, Reveno actually has
the best timing on the team: he is
leading the team in steals, averaging
1.8 per game. That's normally unusual
for a center to do, but Reveno is simply
taking effective advantage of the given
game situations.
"Part of it might be because in our
zone defense, I surprise people from
where I'm coming from," Reveno says.
"When I come out from the low post it
gives a different look to the defense."
Reveno, who will graduate in March,
has his eyes on possibly playing basket
ball in Europe next season before per
haps attending business school. But for
the meantime, his only concern is this
week's trip to Washington.
"We've known from the start that
any team in the Pac-10 can beat us, so
we have to be ready to play each game,"
Reveno says. "A let-up now would be
very costly. To be as good a team as
we can be we need to win these games
and be a high-caliber basketball team
on the road."
