# Stanford at Washington
## 
### 
TONIGHT - KZSU (90 1 FM), KCBS (740 AM). 7:30 p.m. tipoft
RECORDS — Stanford (10-3, 3-1 in Pac-10 play), Washington (4-7, 1-2).
INJURIES - None.
SERIES — The Huskies have won eight of the last 10 meetings. Washington has beaten
Stanford in 10 straight at Hec Edmundson Pavilion including an 84-82 double-overtime
win last February.
HUSKY UPDATE — Eldridge Recasner. the Huskies' 6-2 junior guard, leads the team
with 16 4 points and 4.2 assists per game Center Mark West has chipped in 14.7
ppg He is shooting .578 from the field and grabbing 6.8 rebounds a night, both tops
on the team
CARDINAL UPDATE — All-America candidate Todd Uchti, who turned 22 Sunday, is the
Cardinal's top scorer at 21.2 ppg He's shooting an astonishing 64 0 percent from the
field With 24 points, he can tie Mel Counts, Oregon State '64, for seventh place on
the all-time Pac-10 scoring chart.... Stanford is shooting 55.8 percent at home, 49 3
percent on the road The Cardinal is 10-0 when it holds an opponent below 50 percent
shootina, and 0-3 when it fails to do so.
KEYS TO VICTORY — Stanford must not allow Recasner to have a big game — he's
hurt the Cardinal before. The Cardinal needs to gain confidence on the road and a
sweep of the Washington schools would be just the ticket. If the offense is patient
and avoids the turnover, and if the big men (Eric Reveno, Howard Wright and Adam
Keefe) can stay out of foul trouble, the Cardinal should cruise.
