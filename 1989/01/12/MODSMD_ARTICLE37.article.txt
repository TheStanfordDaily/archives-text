# Dennis Green's hiring is a step in the right direction
## 
### 
Welcome to Stanford, Dennis Green.
We're glad you're here.
Last fall, while the Stanford football
team lost all kinds of games it could (and
should) have won, Andy Geiger hemmed
and hawwed and said that he'd stick with
Jack Elway, whose suspect play calling
was blamed for many of the losses. Fi
nally, something changed the athletic di
rector's mind, and on what seemed like
a moment's notice, Coach Elway was
gone, fired for not producing the wins
that the Cardinal faithful wanted.
It was a good decision, which was, how
ever, handled quite poorly. I've never
been much of an Elway fan, but even he
deserved better treatment. If you're going
to fire somebody, you ought to at least
have the guts to admit that their job is
on the line. Geiger didn't have that in
testinal fortitude, and it made spectators
wonder what really prompted the sudden
firing.
As the search for a new coach began,
Geiger announced that two football
players would sit on the committee which
would review possible candidates. Using

players in the decision-making process
was an unusual step for a college.
It seemed to suggest that the Stanford
players were the party responsible for
Elway's firing, and it made one wonder
how a prospective coach might feel about
that. Would his job depend on how the
players' regarded him?
Something about the whole thing
stunk. I didn't like Elway, but a veteran
athletic director like Geiger should have
handled it better. He did, however, do a
great job replacing poor Jack, and it's
time now to forget the controversy. By

picking Dennis Green, the Cardinal brass
did far better than any of its earlier
actions could have predicted.
Green is a proven winner. In 1982, he
was the Big Ten Coach of the Year at
Northwestern University. He's experi
enced, having been at Stanford before as
a running back coach under then head
man Bill Walsh, and again later under
Paul Wiggin. He's a good recruiter, the
man who brought Darrin Nelson to the
Farm. He's confident and smart, and un
like Elway, his vocabulary consists of
more than tired football cliches, which is
great news for all Bay Area reporters.
Green is also the Pacific 10 Confer
ence's first black coach, and it's good to
see that barrier finally crossed. Football,
however, still has a long, long way to go.
Green's hiring makes him only the fourth
black coach active in Division I-A, and
that's a deplorable fact.
It's also quite indicative of the racism
still imbedded in American sports, in this
case specifically football. It's not a coin
cidence that until very recently there were
virtually no black quarterbacks in college

or the pros, there are still less than a
handful of black coaches at major col
leges, and there has never been a black
head coach in the NFL.
Maybe part of that is beginning to
change. This year eight of the top 15
teams in college football were led by black
quarterbacks (Notre Dame, USC, West
Virginia, Nebraska, Auburn, Arkansas,
Oklahoma and Michigan).
It used to be that blacks were simply
not allowed to play quarterback. They
could run, catch and tackle, but not
throw. At halftime of this year's Fiesta
Bowl, NBC commentator and ex-NFL
great Ahmad Rashad told a story about
playing little league football. He was the
team's star, and his coach told him that
he could play any position he wanted,
any position that is, except quarterback.
At all levels of football, coaches still
give those kind of instructions, but we're
hoping not as much. This year, when his
son asked him what position he should
play, Rashad answered without hesita
tion, quarterback.
Young blacks, like Msyor Harris of West

Virginia, are demanding that they be al
lowed to play quarterback. Coming out
of high school, Harris ended up choosing
relatively unknown West Virginia because
many of the bigger schools insisted that
he move to cornerback. He didn't, and
this year No. 4 West Virginia finished
its best season ever at 11-1.
But even with this emergence of many
talented black quarterbacks, the sport
still has a long road to travel. Two areas
that come to mind are coaching, which
we've already discussed, and announcing,
which we haven't.
How many times during the bowl
season did you hear that a black quar
terback was "a great athlete and
scrambler?" Meanwhile, how many times
did you hear that UCLA's Troy Aikman
was a "pure passer and natural leader"?
Why didn't they ever tell us frankly that
Aikman is a lousy runner, and that pass
ing and running ability are not mutually
exclusive?
Notre Dame's Tony Rice has both of


ERIK STEN
them, but until his spectacular
performance in the Fiesta Bowl,
the knock on this great quarter
back was that he couldn't throw.
After the Fiesta Bowl, it's even
more clear that the guy has got
a professional arm. It's just that
your average announcer doesn't
take a black quarterback serious

ly. Black quarterbacks don't
throw, they run the wishbone.
Come on.
Dennis Green's hiring certainly
isn't the answer to all of this, but
it is a step in the right direction.
It is also, regardless of his color,
a great move for Stanford. Green
looks to be just what the Cardinal
needs, and he's even going to hire
an offensive coordinator.
So again, Coach Green, welcome
to Stanford.

hoping not as much. This year, when his
son asked him what position he should
play, Rashad answered without hesita
tion, quarterback.
Young blacks, like Msyor Harris of West

Virginia, are demanding that they be al
lowed to play quarterback. Coming out
of high school, Harris ended up choosing
relatively unknown West Virginia because
many of the bigger schools insisted that
he move to cornerback. He didn't, and
this year No. 4 West Virginia finished
its best season ever at 11-1.
But even with this emergence of many
talented black quarterbacks, the sport
still has a long road to travel. Two areas
that come to mind are coaching, which
we've already discussed, and announcing,
which we haven't.
How many times during the bowl
season did you hear that a black quar
terback was "a great athlete and
scrambler?" Meanwhile, how many times
did you hear that UCLA's Troy Aikman
was a "pure passer and natural leader"?
Why didn't they ever tell us frankly that
Aikman is a lousy runner, and that pass
ing and running ability are not mutually
exclusive?
Notre Dame's Tony Rice has both of


ERIK STEN
them, but until his spectacular
performance in the Fiesta Bowl,
the knock on this great quarter
back was that he couldn't throw.
After the Fiesta Bowl, it's even
more clear that the guy has got
a professional arm. It's just that
your average announcer doesn't
take a black quarterback serious

ly. Black quarterbacks don't
throw, they run the wishbone.
Come on.
Dennis Green's hiring certainly
isn't the answer to all of this, but
it is a step in the right direction.
It is also, regardless of his color,
a great move for Stanford. Green
looks to be just what the Cardinal
needs, and he's even going to hire
an offensive coordinator.
So again, Coach Green, welcome
to Stanford.
Welcome to Stanford, Dennis Green.
We're glad you're here.
Last fall, while the Stanford football
team lost all kinds of games it could (and
should) have won, Andy Geiger hemmed
and hawwed and said that he'd stick with
Jack Elway, whose suspect play calling
was blamed for many of the losses. Fi
nally, something changed the athletic di
rector's mind, and on what seemed like
a moment's notice, Coach Elway was
gone, fired for not producing the wins
that the Cardinal faithful wanted.
It was a good decision, which was, how
ever, handled quite poorly. I've never
been much of an Elway fan, but even he
deserved better treatment. If you're going
to fire somebody, you ought to at least
have the guts to admit that their job is
on the line. Geiger didn't have that in
testinal fortitude, and it made spectators
wonder what really prompted the sudden
firing.
As the search for a new coach began,
Geiger announced that two football
players would sit on the committee which
would review possible candidates. Using

players in the decision-making process
was an unusual step for a college.
It seemed to suggest that the Stanford
players were the party responsible for
Elway's firing, and it made one wonder
how a prospective coach might feel about
that. Would his job depend on how the
players' regarded him?
Something about the whole thing
stunk. I didn't like Elway, but a veteran
athletic director like Geiger should have
handled it better. He did, however, do a
great job replacing poor Jack, and it's
time now to forget the controversy. By

picking Dennis Green, the Cardinal brass
did far better than any of its earlier
actions could have predicted.
Green is a proven winner. In 1982, he
was the Big Ten Coach of the Year at
Northwestern University. He's experi
enced, having been at Stanford before as
a running back coach under then head
man Bill Walsh, and again later under
Paul Wiggin. He's a good recruiter, the
man who brought Darrin Nelson to the
Farm. He's confident and smart, and un
like Elway, his vocabulary consists of
more than tired football cliches, which is
great news for all Bay Area reporters.
Green is also the Pacific 10 Confer
ence's first black coach, and it's good to
see that barrier finally crossed. Football,
however, still has a long, long way to go.
Green's hiring makes him only the fourth
black coach active in Division I-A, and
that's a deplorable fact.
It's also quite indicative of the racism
still imbedded in American sports, in this
case specifically football. It's not a coin
cidence that until very recently there were
virtually no black quarterbacks in college

or the pros, there are still less than a
handful of black coaches at major col
leges, and there has never been a black
head coach in the NFL.
Maybe part of that is beginning to
change. This year eight of the top 15
teams in college football were led by black
quarterbacks (Notre Dame, USC, West
Virginia, Nebraska, Auburn, Arkansas,
Oklahoma and Michigan).
It used to be that blacks were simply
not allowed to play quarterback. They
could run, catch and tackle, but not
throw. At halftime of this year's Fiesta
Bowl, NBC commentator and ex-NFL
great Ahmad Rashad told a story about
playing little league football. He was the
team's star, and his coach told him that
he could play any position he wanted,
any position that is, except quarterback.
At all levels of football, coaches still
give those kind of instructions, but we're
hoping not as much. This year, when his
son asked him what position he should
