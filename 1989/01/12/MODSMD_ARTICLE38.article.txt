# Azzi, Henning are a dazzling duo

The best backcourt in the West.
When attributed to the guards
of most teams, the label would be
grossly innaccurate if not overtly
optimistic. Applied to Jennifer
Azzi and Sonja Henning, the
starting tandem for the Stanford
women's basketball team, the
statement exudes oracular
honesty.
Individually, the two are spec
tacular enough. Azzi led the Car
dinal in scoring last season and
is smashing the school assist
records as if they were made of
glass. A member of the All-Pacific
10 Conference team last year, the
junior was selected a Street and
Smith's preseason honorable men
tion Ail-American for this
season's campaign.
Henning returned this year as
Stanford's point guard after being
named the Pac-10 as well as na
tional Freshman of the Year.
Though a knee ir\jury over winter
break slowed her down a bit, the
player selected as the Cardinal's
MVP after the past season is again
orchestrating the deadliest offense
in the league.
Stanford's real strength, how
ever, comes from the two players
acting as a unit. The chemistry
is undefinable, but somehow the
duo together transcends the level
of play they exhibit when compet
ing apart. Simply stated, the Azzi-
Hfinning tandem is magical.
The best backcourt in the West,
indubitably, resides on the Farm.
"I think we have a good back
court," Stanford Coach Tara Van-
Derveer qualified, "and when I
think of backcourt I think of our
whole backcourt, which includes

Sonja, Jennifer, Martha (Ric
hards), Emily (Wagner), Stacy
(Parson).
"I think there are some teams
that probably have maybe a bigger
or quicker backcourt, but our
guards play well together, they
complement each other," VanDer
veer said. "Sonja and Jennifer
play a lot, but the success of our
backcourt will probably be not
that just Soi\ja and Jennifer con
tribute but that Martha contri
butes, Emily contributes and
Stacy contributes."
Point well taken. Wagner shone
the brightest of anyone in the Car
dinal's stellar upset of Pac-10-
leading Washington last season in
Maples Pavilion, and Parson took
control brilliantly at USC last
season when the rest of the team
was down on its luck.
However, it is the starting
guards who have claimed the most
attention. Adored by the crowd
and feared by opponents, Azzi and
Henning are captivating and quick
players who attract attention and
make the flashy, game-winning
plays. Along with senior forward
Evon Asforis, the other tri
captain, the pair is the Superglue
for the super team.
"I think they have different
strengths, and they complement
each other," VanDerveer said. "I
think Jennifer is good at pushing
the ball upcourt — she's like our
full-court point guard. Sonja fills
the lane, and in the half-court
game I think Sor\ja sets up Jen
nifer more for her 3-point shot."
Last year, Azzi and Henning
followed these generalizations
closely. Henning capitalized game
after game with her tenacious
driving, while Azzi bombed oppo
nents relentlessly from 3-point
land.

Times have changed. Both
worked hard in the off-season to
round out their games, developing
the areas that were previously
weak. While hardly identical —
Azzi still thrives on perimeter
shooting while Henning is still a
driver — the guards have achieved
a unique parity.
"Sonja is really looking for her
shot a lot more, which is reallv
good when she's shooting the ball

well," VanDerveer noted, "and
Jennifer is penetrating more and
driving more, which is what we
need her to do. They both have
almost taken on the other per
son's game a little bit — they've
learned from each other in that
respect.
"1 think they probably work
well because the one thing they

have in common is that they're
both very hard workers," VanDer
veer added. "They are from dif
ferent places and different back
grounds, but they were in winning
programs in high school. They're
both really motivated, and that's
probably the thing, that glue."
Experience has enhanced the
adhesion. As starters all of last
year, the two have logged many
competitv* 4 hours as a tandem.
With more preseason and early
season time under their belts,
Azzi and Henning are playing to
gether even better than before.
For Henning, this joint experi
ence may be the secret of their
success. "Just from the fact that
we've played a lot together you
can see us one, as a unit, but
there's not one thing that sticks
out in my mind as to why we play
well together.
"We complement each other
well enough," Henning added.
"We both try to do the same
things. If one is doing something,

the other will counter-react and
do something else. But you can
say that about the whole starting
five — we're all trying to be a
unit, not just Jennifer and I."
For Azzi, the bond with Hen
ning is easier to explain. As shoot
ing guard, the junior relies on
opportune passes from Henning
to set up her scores. With Azzi
rating a close second on the team
in scoring, the pair have made
many good connections.
"It's weird, but that thought
was running through my head
this weekend at UCLA," Azzi
replied. "I don't know if it was
because Sonja had been out for a
couple of games, but I realized
just how much we work together.
Sometimes you know someone for
so long that you take it for
granted, but the plays that she
makes, other people just don't do.
"My last shot of the game, the
3-pointer, she got me the ball, so
I have to give her a lot of credit
for doing that. If she hadn't read
the screen and passed me the ball,
I wouldn't have had the shot. It's
little things like that that you
don't think about until someone
is out."
