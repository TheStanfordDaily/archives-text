# Manning's knee injury leaves his future in doubt
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Danny Man
ning of the Los Angeles Clippers, the top
selection in last summer's NBA draft,
apparently will be sidelined for at least
the rest of the season because of a torn
ligament in his right knee.
The development is another in a long
line of disasters for the luckless Clippers,
who haven't qualified for the NBA
playoffs since 1976.
Team physician Dr. Tony Daly con
firmed late Tuesday that Manning has
a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his
right knee. Daly made the announcement
after studying results of computer
enhanced X-rays.
"After studying the results of the test
Danny took Tuesday morning, I am 95
percent certain that the anterior cruciate
ligament in his right knee is torn," Daly
said. "The degree to which it is torn will
have to be determined through diagnostic

arthroscopic surgery.
"He will come back from this iryury,"
Daly said prior to Wednesday night's
game against Sacramento. "Realistically,
the general rule is one year, but it's all
generalized. Will he be 100 percent?
That's open to question. Maybe he'll be
at about 90 percent when he comes back,
but 90 percent of Danny Manning is a
lot better than 100 percent of most NBA
players."
Daly had planned to give Manning an
arthroscopy Wednesday morning, but it
was cancelled. Daly felt that Manning
should wait no longer than a week to get
it done in order to determine if the liga
ment is completely torn.
The method of surgery Daly recom
mended to Manning was one in which
the damaged ligament is replaced with a
patellar tendon graft. The patellar tendon
is the strongest tendon in the leg, and

Daly felt this procedure would give Man
ning the greatest likelihood of returning.
"Not to have the surgery would greatly
hamper his athletic ability," said Daly,
adding that Manning would have to wear
a brace for at least a year after the sur
gery. "His age is greatly in his favor, but
he still will lose some of the explosiveness
in his right leg, some of his quickness
and his cutting ability."
Rehabilitation of the injury could take
a year or more.
Manning's agent, Ron Grinker of Cin
cinnati, flew to Los Angeles Tuesday to
be with his client, saying, "I'm here to
be with Danny and comfort him. We want
what's best for the future of Danny Man
ning and the Los Angeles Clippers."
Clippers general manager Elgin Baylor
said the team was "investigating every
possible alternative," but refused to elab
orate.

"We're gathering as much information
as possible," he said. "Danny Manning's
health and playing career is our primary
concern."
The 6-foot-10 Manning was injured late
in the first quarter of a game at Mil
waukee on Jan. 4. The 22-year-old for
ward said he "heard a snap" when he
landed stiff-legged after making a layup.
Clippers coach Gene Shue, meanwhile,
said, "It's a hard injury to play complete
again with and I feel bad for Danny about
that. But it's also a blow to the team.
"We have to regroup. It's going to be
very hard."
Manning signed a guaranteed five-year,
$10.5 million contract with the Clippers,
who, unlike other teams, don't insure
their first-round draft choices.
The presence of the 1988 U.S. Olympic
star boosted season ticket sales to nearly
double the previous season.

At least four other Clippers, including
1980 first-round draft pick Michael
Brooks, have suffered similar injuries.
And although each of those players un
derwent surgery to repair the torn liga
ment, their playing skills diminished after
the operations.
Among players traded away by the Clip
pers since 1977 have been forwards Tom
Chambers, Terry Cummings, Adrian
Dantley and Michael Cage, center James
Donaldson, and guards Byron Scott,
Ricky Pierce, Mike Woodson and Craig
Hodges.
Manning, of Lawrence, Kan., led un
derdog Kansas to the NCAA champion
ship last spring. He concluded his college
career as the owner of more than three
dozen school, Big Eight Conference and
NCAA records, averaging 20.1 points and
8.1 rebounds per game.

it done in order to determine if the liga
ment is completely torn.
The method of surgery Daly recom
mended to Manning was one in which
the damaged ligament is replaced with a
patellar tendon graft. The patellar tendon
is the strongest tendon in the leg, and

Daly felt this procedure would give Man
ning the greatest likelihood of returning.
"Not to have the surgery would greatly
hamper his athletic ability," said Daly,
adding that Manning would have to wear
a brace for at least a year after the sur
gery. "His age is greatly in his favor, but
he still will lose some of the explosiveness
in his right leg, some of his quickness
and his cutting ability."
Rehabilitation of the injury could take
a year or more.
Manning's agent, Ron Grinker of Cin
cinnati, flew to Los Angeles Tuesday to
be with his client, saying, "I'm here to
be with Danny and comfort him. We want
what's best for the future of Danny Man
ning and the Los Angeles Clippers."
Clippers general manager Elgin Baylor
said the team was "investigating every
possible alternative," but refused to elab
orate.

"We're gathering as much information
as possible," he said. "Danny Manning's
health and playing career is our primary
concern."
The 6-foot-10 Manning was injured late
in the first quarter of a game at Mil
waukee on Jan. 4. The 22-year-old for
ward said he "heard a snap" when he
landed stiff-legged after making a layup.
Clippers coach Gene Shue, meanwhile,
said, "It's a hard injury to play complete
again with and I feel bad for Danny about
that. But it's also a blow to the team.
"We have to regroup. It's going to be
very hard."
Manning signed a guaranteed five-year,
$10.5 million contract with the Clippers,
who, unlike other teams, don't insure
their first-round draft choices.
The presence of the 1988 U.S. Olympic
star boosted season ticket sales to nearly
double the previous season.

At least four other Clippers, including
1980 first-round draft pick Michael
Brooks, have suffered similar injuries.
And although each of those players un
derwent surgery to repair the torn liga
ment, their playing skills diminished after
the operations.
Among players traded away by the Clip
pers since 1977 have been forwards Tom
Chambers, Terry Cummings, Adrian
Dantley and Michael Cage, center James
Donaldson, and guards Byron Scott,
Ricky Pierce, Mike Woodson and Craig
Hodges.
Manning, of Lawrence, Kan., led un
derdog Kansas to the NCAA champion
ship last spring. He concluded his college
career as the owner of more than three
dozen school, Big Eight Conference and
NCAA records, averaging 20.1 points and
8.1 rebounds per game.
