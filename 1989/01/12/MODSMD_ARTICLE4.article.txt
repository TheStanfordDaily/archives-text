# Survey finds Stanford environment is now more liberal than Berkeley

A stereotype has been overturned in
the Bay Area's traditional college
rivalry.
The recent survey of incoming college
freshmen conducted by the American
Council of Education and UCLA has
found that Stanford students are more
liberal than UC-Berkeley students.
Stanford students have moved further
to the left in the past five years, ac
cording to the survey, while students
entering Berkeley have maintained a
relatively constant political perspective.
In 1983, only 33 percent of Stanford
freshmen called themselves liberals; this
year the number increased to 42 per
cent. There are 3 percent fewer self
described liberals this year among
Berkeley's incoming freshmen, accord
ing to the survey.
Stanford liberals outnumbered their
conservative classmates by a 2-to-l
ratio, with women describing them
selves as more liberal than males.

The results coincide with Stanford's
voting pattern in the November mock
election, with 69 percent of students
supporting Democrat Michael Dukakis,
the more liberal of the can
didates.
In addition, a mtyority of Berkeley
freshmen said they were attending col
lege to become rich — 55 percent cited
the desire to make more money. Stan
ford freshmen only cited money as a
reason to attend college in 48 percent
of their responses.
Ray Colvig, a spokesman at Berkeley,
seemed skeptical, if not embarrassed,
of the statistical comparisons.
"I don't accept the idea that there is
a major swing," he said in an interview
yesterday with The Daily.
"Our students were conservative on
law and order issues," he said, especially
concerning the death penalty, criminal
charges and mandatory drug-testing.
A majority of Stanford students also
support mandatory drug testing,
legalized abortion and abolishing the
death penulty, but in lower percentages

than the Berkeley students. Both uni
versities' statistics were lower than the
national average.
"The results of the survey are only
surprising in light of the historical con
text," said Subodh Chandra, co-chair of
Stanford Democrats .
Chandra speculated the rise in
liberalism at Stanford over the past five
years has been caused "by people's
awakening of social problems during the
Reagan administration."
Meanwhile, he said, "Berkeley no
longer has the historical liberal baggage
attached to it."
Colvig said the results were part of
a nationwide conservative swing. He
said Berkeley freshmen were still liberal
on feminist issues, abortion and defense
spending — which only 11 percent of
Berkeley students say should increase.
Over the past 10 years, Colvig said
student attitudes about drugs have be
come more conservative. In 1978, 58
percent of students believed that mari-
