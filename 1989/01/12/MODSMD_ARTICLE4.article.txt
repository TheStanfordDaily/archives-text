# Survey finds Stanford environment is now more liberal than Berkeley

A stereotype has been overturned in
the Bay Area's traditional college
rivalry.
The recent survey of incoming college
freshmen conducted by the American
Council of Education and UCLA has
found that Stanford students are more
liberal than UC-Berkeley students.
Stanford students have moved further
to the left in the past five years, ac
cording to the survey, while students
entering Berkeley have maintained a
relatively constant political perspective.
In 1983, only 33 percent of Stanford
freshmen called themselves liberals; this
year the number increased to 42 per
cent. There are 3 percent fewer self
described liberals this year among
Berkeley's incoming freshmen, accord
ing to the survey.
Stanford liberals outnumbered their
conservative classmates by a 2-to-l
ratio, with women describing them
selves as more liberal than males.

The results coincide with Stanford's
voting pattern in the November mock
election, with 69 percent of students
supporting Democrat Michael Dukakis,
the more liberal of the can
didates.
In addition, a mtyority of Berkeley
freshmen said they were attending col
lege to become rich — 55 percent cited
the desire to make more money. Stan
ford freshmen only cited money as a
reason to attend college in 48 percent
of their responses.
Ray Colvig, a spokesman at Berkeley,
seemed skeptical, if not embarrassed,
of the statistical comparisons.
"I don't accept the idea that there is
a major swing," he said in an interview
yesterday with The Daily.
"Our students were conservative on
law and order issues," he said, especially
concerning the death penalty, criminal
charges and mandatory drug-testing.
A majority of Stanford students also
support mandatory drug testing,
legalized abortion and abolishing the
death penulty, but in lower percentages

than the Berkeley students. Both uni
versities' statistics were lower than the
national average.
"The results of the survey are only
surprising in light of the historical con
text," said Subodh Chandra, co-chair of
Stanford Democrats .
Chandra speculated the rise in
liberalism at Stanford over the past five
years has been caused "by people's
awakening of social problems during the
Reagan administration."
Meanwhile, he said, "Berkeley no
longer has the historical liberal baggage
attached to it."
Colvig said the results were part of
a nationwide conservative swing. He
said Berkeley freshmen were still liberal
on feminist issues, abortion and defense
spending — which only 11 percent of
Berkeley students say should increase.
Over the past 10 years, Colvig said
student attitudes about drugs have be
come more conservative. In 1978, 58
percent of students believed that mari-
juana should be legalized, com
pared to this year's percentage of
25 percent.
Ricky Gonzales, a law student
at Berkeley who has organized
many civil rights protests over the
past four years, speculated that
Cal students cited money as more
of a reason to attend college be
cause they come from "less
privileged families."
According to Gonzales,
Berkeley students are more con
servative financially because they
have fewer familial resources to
fall back on.
"The initial reaction of most

people is of self-protection as op
posed to one of altruism," he said.
Gonzales explained that most of
this years freshmen have lived
through a very conservative era,
and that "their social safety net
has been cropped apart."
He added that he did not expect
to see so many people scared, but
that the fear had lead to political
conservatism.
"Liberals understand the roots
of social problems," said Gonzales.
"They are neccessary for social
change, and sometimes they don't
go far enough."
The survey shows that among
freshmen entering the two schools,
as among most Americans, the
"1-word" embraces many shades
of meaning.
