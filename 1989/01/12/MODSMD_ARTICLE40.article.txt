In a stunning triumph for West
Coast sailing, Stanford and two
other California teams took three
of the top four spots at last week
end's Rose Bowl Regatta in Long
Beach, upsetting top-ranked Navy
and thirteen other schools at the
important intersectional event.
In the extremely close final
results, the defending national
champions from UC-Irvine
finished first, with a surprisingly
strong USC team taking second,
and the traditionally powerful
squad from Brown finishing in
third. Stanford was just four
points behind in fourth place, with
a comfortable 12-point lead over
fifth-place Navy.
For the Cardinal, the weekend
had its ups and downs. After some
lackluster sailing, the foursome
of senior Bill Shoemaker, sopho
more Rebecca Bryson, junior
Robert Brown, and junior Heidi
Park was back in ninth place after
Saturday's racing. Returning to
form on Sunday, however, the
squad sailed consistently well to
move up through the pack.
Individually, Shoemaker and
Bryson finished fifth in A-
Division, and Brown and Park
finished fifth in B-Division.

For all involved in the Cardinal
effort, however, the high point of
the regatta seemed to be the
defeat of the Midshipmen from
Annapolis. The team from the
Naval Academy was ranked first
in the nation going in to the regat
ta, and the Stanford sailors took
particular pleasure in helping
show that the West Coast, which
is traditionally overlooked in col
legiate sailing, can match the best
of the East.
"It was extremely exciting to
end up ahead of Navy. It's some
thing we've wanted to do all
season," said Park.
Other Stanford sailors said
after the regatta that they were
pleased to see that they were com
petitive on a national level.
"For a while we've had trouble
coming from behind, but this
weekend we did a good job at
recovering and sailing fast. That
makes it a lot more fun," said
Shoemaker.
Indeed, through better sailing
on the second day of racing, the
Cardinal sailors were able to ad
vance ahead of highly-ranked
teams from Long Beach, Wash
ington, and Tulane, all of which
have given the Stanford squad
some trouble in the past. That
gave Stanford Coach Blake Mid
dleton new enthusiasm for the
season ahead.
"After watching Saturday's
racing, I was ready for a vacation.
By the end of the regatta, though,
I was excited about the job
ahead," said Middleton.
As a result of this regatta, the

Stanford team hopes to move up
from its current ranking of 13
into the top 10. If they can con
tinue to sail at the level they did
on Sunday, that should be no
problem.
