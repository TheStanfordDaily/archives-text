# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Winter break wasn't all fun and games
for the men's and women's basketball teams
— they practiced or played a game nearly
every day. However, Todd Lichti and Jen
nifer Azzi appeared to have their share of
fun in their games, and have earned The
Daily's Athletes of the Break awards.
Azzi, a 5-foot-7 junior guard from Oak

Ridge, Tenn., led the Cardinal to six victories
in eight games, including two wins over
top-20 teams.
Azzi began with 17 points, 11 assists and
six steals in the Cardinal's win over
Colorado, ranked 20th at the time. She also
recorded double-doubles in wins over Duke,
then ranked 19th, (10 points, 11 assists and
eight rebounds) and Houston (14 points, 11
assists, six rebounds and four steals).
Azzi is currently averaging 15.2 points,
6.7 assists and 4.5 rebounds. She leads all
Cardinal starters with a .558 shooting per
centage. Plus, Azzi is hitting 42 percent of
her shots from the 3-point range.

Lichti, a 6-4 senior guard from Concord,
Calif., was unstoppable over break in leading
Stanford to a 7-1 mark.
The highlight was when Lichti and the
21st-ranked Cardinal met 1988 Pac-10
Player of the Year Sean Elliott and his
eighth-ranked Arizona Wildcats. While
Lichti and the Cobra each tallied 35 points,
Lichti scored 27 of his in the second half
to lead an amazing comeback as the Cardinal
rebounded from a 21-4 deficit to post an
83-78 victory.
Doing it like only he can, Lichti ran a
one-man fast break. Repeatedly, he drove
through two, three and even four defenders
to notch another hoop. Lichti hit on 10-of-14
shots on the night and was a perfect 15-of-15

from the free-throw line.
For his efforts, Lichti was named the Pac
-10 Player of the Week for two consecutive
weeks — Jan. 2 and Jan. 9 — becoming
the season's first double winner.
Lichti is averaging 23.5 points, 6.5
rebounds and 4.5 assists per game in Pac-10
play.
