# Release of UCMI report once again delayed

Despite their best efforts, the
University Committee on Minor
ity Issues will not complete their
long-awaited report on minority
lif«i until the onH r»f tKiia mnntVi

according to As
soc. History Prof.
Albert Camarillo,
the committee
chair.
The report was
expected this
week.
University
President Donald
Kennedy and

Provost James Rosse created the
committee a year and a half ago
in response to pressure by student
groups to improve minority life
on campus. The issues studied by
the committee include: curricu
lum, student recruitment, admis

sions and retention, faculty and
staff recruitment, hiring and
promotion and student affairs.
The report is expected to have
many specific policy recommenda
tions in these areas.
The enormous length of the
report led to delays in the "process
of finalizing" it, he said. Camarillo
estimates the committee is about
three weeks behind schedule.
Professional editors are cur
rently editing the bulk of the
report and, according to Camaril
lo, is expected to be 150 pages in
length with a 25-page summary.
Rosse said he had no negative
reaction to the delay, wanting to
ensure that the committee take
the necessary time to make a good
report.
The committee has been at
work since the beginning of the
1987-88 school year, conducting
interviews and public forums and

collecting data from written sur
veys of students, faculty and staff.
Last May, the UCMI released
an interim report, which con
cluded that there were problems
with the quality of minority life
on campus, describing the campus
environment as one of "tension,
frustration and aggravation." The
interim report said that minorities
perceived a "lack of effective lead
ership" in the office of the Dean
of Student Affairs, leading to
many multicultural problems.
Since the issue of the interim
report, the UCMI contracted out
side research firms to conduct in
terviews with students during
spring quarter and collect more
data from surveys over the sum
mer.
The committee was originally
charged with submitting specific
recommendations to the president
and provost by Oct. 1, 1988. Early
last spring, however, the commit

tee moved the deadline ahead to
the beginning of winter quarter
due to obstacles in collecting data.
UCMI staff member Cecilia
Burciaga said in December the
committee was "writing fast and
furiously" in order to make the
January deadline. However, the
UCMI could not reach this new
deadline, said Camarillo, because
the draft of the final report was
"significantly longer than antici
pated."
Camarillo said that once the
report is issued, it will be given
"wide distribution." He said the
report will be made available to
all students and University faculty
and staff, as well as news agencies
across the country.
The report will be "far reach
ing," Camarillo said, because of
the influence it will have on how
other universities around the
country view minority issues.
