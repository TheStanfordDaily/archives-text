# Stanford rated above average by critical survey

Stanford's undergraduate edu
cation was one of few praised in
a recent survey that criticized un
dergraduate education in most
U.S. colleges, according to the San
Jose Mercury News.
The survey was of 30 colleges
nationwide, both public and
private, with enrollments between
900 and 25,000.
Robert Zemsky, a professor at
the University of Pennsylvania,
concluded in his report that most
students graduate without a satis
factory background in mathemat
ics, the natural sciences and the
liberal arts.
"Undergraduate exposure to
the natural sciences and mathe
matics is dangerously low," the
report said. In addition, Zemsky
concluded that two-thirds of grad
uating students fail to receive a
broad or deep understanding of
the liberal arts.
Stanford undergraduates, how
ever, receive an "above average"

education, Zemsky's report con
cluded.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Thomas Wasow attributed Stan
ford's superior education oppor
tunities to Stanford's students,
faculty and education programs
and policies. Wasow said Stanford
stands out because it has "leading
researchers teaching at under
graduate levels, good students who
learn from each other, strong in
terdisciplinary programs and
more structure than other schools
due to the distribution require
ments."
Ewart Thomas, dean of human
ities and science, emphasized the
significance of an evolving ap
proach to education, such as last
year's Western Culture debate.
Stanford "leads the nation in
thinking carefully about general
education courses," he said.
Penn, the University of South
Carolina, University of Illinois,
Bryn Mawr and Mount Holyoke
were among other schools noted
for their "above average" under-

graduate education, according to
the Mercury News.
Many schools do not require
students to study math or require
only a superficial understanding,
Wasow said. Requirements such
as Freshman English, foreign lan
guage and the distribution re
quirements ensure a broad ed
ucation while allowing students to
study in depth in their preferred
fields, he said.
According to the report, at
nearly half of the colleges sur
veyed more than 30 percent of
students graduated with only one
or two courses in mathematics or
science. Zemsky recommended no
less than five courses for a strong
foundation in those areas. He also
complained that education in hu
manities departments is "superfi
cial".
Zemsky blamed the failure of
the higher education system on
the universities' curricula, which,
he said, lack structure to direct
students through the many
courses offered. As a result, stu

dents often end up with a schedule
that excludes important math, sci
ence and humanities courses.
Zemsky's report suggests that
colleges have more rigid require
ments in math and sciences, create
a stronger relationship between
introductory and advanced
courses and offer better academic
advising.
Zemsky also noted some bright
spots. Students throughout the
country graduate with a strong
understanding in their field
of study, he said. Zemsky distin
guished engineering as a particu
larly strong field,
Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter
was unavailable for comment yes
terday, but in the past she has
rejected the significance of sur
veys such as Zemsky's. Referring
to U.S. News and World Report's
October ranking of colleges, which
placed Stanford sixth nationally,
Fetter said, "If students and par
ents are going to choose a college
by looking at ranking lists, it is
really too bad."
