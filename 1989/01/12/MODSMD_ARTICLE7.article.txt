# Integration of women key to solving population crisis
## 
### Ravi Desai Staff writer 
The United Nations' head population ex
pert told a Stanford audience yesterday
that the key to solving the world's emerging
population crisis is the "integration of
women as full members of society."
Nadis Sadik, speaking to a capacity crowd
at Annenberg Auditorium, said there will
be well over a billion more people in the
world by the year 2000, creating tremen
dous environmental problems such as
deforestation and pollution.
The problems can be averted by increas
ing the status of women in many Third
World societies to the point where they
have control over decisions whether to have
children, said Sadik, who is the executive
director and undersecretary general of the
United Nations Population Fund.

In most Third World nations, women
want to have fewer children, Sadik said,
but they aren't able to make the final
decisions about family size. Sadik said that
despite international efforts, "only 50 per
cent of all women have access to family
planning (information)."
It is almost possible to "predict the fi
nancial and developmental situation of a
country from the position that women oc
cupy in its social structure. The key in
dicators are whether or not women have
control over their fertility and can work
outside the home," Sadik said."
Third World women should also be better
educated on agricultural practices, Sadik
said. While women account for over half
of the food production in developing coun
tries, "women's central role in resource
management and conservation has yet to
be fully recognized by governments
