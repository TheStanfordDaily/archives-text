# ASSU straw poll:
## Students say no to F 
### Baldwin Lee Staff writer 
Stanford undergraduates overwhelm
ingly oppose reinstating the F grade,
but a majority of graduate students be
lieve the University should give F's, this
year's first ASSU straw poll shows.
The poll indicates a deep split in op
inion between University graduates and
undergraduates regarding the F grade.
Sixty percent of graduate students
polled support reinstating the F and 32
percent are opposed. Conversely, only 18
percent of undergraduates support
bringing back the F while 75 percent
are opposed.
Stanford, which abolished the Fin
1969, is the only major U.S. university
that does not report F grades on tran
scripts. In a faculty poll conducted last
spring, two-thirds of the faculty sur
veyed supported reinstating the F.
Supporters of the F argue that it is
an important part of a rigorous grading
system and say that when faced with
the possibility of failing, students will
become more disciplined. Opponents feel
the F will excessively pressure students
and inhibit them from taking chances
in selecting classes.
The ASSU's straw poll, which is scien
tifically conducted, asked 217 University
students seven questions last December.
It is the first of 13 polls the ASSU has
budgeted for this school year, according
to Poll Coordinator Mark Lee. He said
that each poll costs $250 to $300.
Other poll questions included whether
students would support a public service
program that provides financial incen
tives to participating students, and
whether University administration re
sponse to racial incidents has been ad
equate.
Graduates and undergraduates turned
in nearly identical results in response
to the public service question, "Would
you support, oppose, or have no opinion
regarding a program that provided fi
nancial incentives to student participa
tion in public service?" Of all students
polled, 67 percent said yes, 20 percent
said no, and 12 percent had no opinion.

sidering various proposals that would
allow students to do public service in
order to earn money toward a college
education, and the issue is being dis
cussed widely on campus.
The recent racial incidents that have
occured on campus spurred a question
polling student opinion regarding the ad
ministration's actions in response to the
incidents. The poll results reflected con
tinuing dissonance of student opinion
regarding the administration's handling
of the racial incidents.
Graduate students felt by a large mar
gin that the University was responding
adequately to racial incidents on campus,
with 47 percent calling administration
actions adequate and 28 percent calling
them inadequate. Undergraduates were
almost evenly split, with 44 percent ter
ming University response adequate, and
42 percent saying it is inadequate.
