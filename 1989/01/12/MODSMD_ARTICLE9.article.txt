# Campus construction blocks busy bicycle intersections
## 
### John Cuerva Staff writer 
Here at Stanford, the land of perpetual
construction, bikers and motorists will find
two important intersections more congested
than usual because of work being done
there.
For at least the next week, the dead-end
of Escondido Road, in front of Crothers
Memorial Hall, will be blocked off as the
Department of Operations and Maintanence
replaces steam condensate pipes there. The
construction is forcing pedestrians and
bikers onto one path.
In the alley behind the post office and
the Stanford Bookstore, the Department of
Facilities Project Management is conduct
ing a project which will eventually prohibit
unauthorized people from parking there.
The steel pipes are being replaced be
cause they have become corroded and are
leaking, according to Cheryl Jensen, man
ager of mechanical utilities. The pipes are
part of the main distribution system that
recycles water that has condensed from the
steam used to heat campus buildings. The
water is returned to Stanford's cogenera
tion plant.
Work on the pipes was scheduled to be
completed before the beginning of Winter
Quarter. But because law students living
in Crothers Hall and Crother's Memorial
were working on take-home final exams,

Operations and Maintainance postponed
the project to avoid disturbing the students,
said Jensen.
Progress was again slowed the first week
of January when first-year law students
returned to begin studying for their finals.
Maintainance crews will not be able to
resume full operations until Jan. 18, after
the first-year law students finish their
tests. The project, weather permitting,
should be completed a week from tomor
row.
Work on the post office project began
yesterday. Labeled a "safty project" by proj
ect engineer John Lerry, the improvements
will do several things. First, a traffic control
gate will be installed that will prevent un
authorized vehicles from parking behind
the post office. The gate will be similar to
the gate that restricts parking behind
Memorial Church.
According to Lerry, drivers now ignore
the risk of being ticketed and park in the
alley in order to check their mail box or
quickly go to the Bookstore. After the in
stallation of the card gate, people will be
able to park at the beginning of the alley
in 20-minute metered slots.
Second, crosswalks will be put in by the
middle of next week on the pedestrian/bike
path that runs between the Bookstore and
post office. Lerry hopes that this will help
reduce some of the confusion that currently
exists in the intersection.
