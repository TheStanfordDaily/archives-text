Stanford at Washington State
SATURDAY - Television: Raycom (Channel 5). Radio: KZSU (90 1 FM).
KCBS (740 AM). 3 p.m. tipoff in Pullman, Wash.
RECORDS — Stanford (11-3, 4-1 in Pac-10 play), Washington (6-7, 1-3).
INJURIES — Brian Quinnett, the Cougars' leading scorer (17.8 points per
game) and rebounder (6.4 per game), has a sprained ankle and may
not play. He was not in uniform last night when Washington State lost
to California.
SERIES — Stanford ended a 12-game losing streak at WSU's Friel Court
last year with a 51-50 squeaker over the Cougars. Howard Wright, who
scored the game-winning basket, had a double-double (20 points, 11
rebounds),
COUGAR UPDATE — If Quinnett doesn't play, it could be a laugher for the
Cardinal The Cougars' second-leading scorer is Brian Wright (no relation
to Howard) at a paltry 9.4 ppg. He is also the team's second-best
rebounder with 5.5 rpg. David Sanders, who buried Stanford last year
with some unconscious 3-point shooting at Maples, is out for the season.
CARDINAL UPDATE — Stanford knocked off the Huskies in Seattle for the
first time in over a decade last night. Todd Uchti, a certain first-round
pick in the NBA draft, put away the game winner on a short jumper with
0:02 remaining to give the Cardinal a 71-69 victory.
KEYS TO VICTORY — The Cardinal's win over the Huskies was its first in
a game where the opponent shot over 50 percent. Even with Quinnett,
the Cougars only average 44 percent from the field. Without him, they're
members in good standing of the Pullman Bricklayers Union. To win,
Stanford must play competent basketball and exorcise, once and for all,
the demons of the cult of Senseless Road Defeats After Winning Big
Games.
NEXT FOR STANFORD — The Cardinal returns home to host Miami (Fla.)
in a non-conference game Monday at 7:30 p.m. The Hurricanes (10-6)
got their biggest win of the season last night, knocking off the No. 16
Kansas Jayhawks 87-96. Senior forward Eric Brown scored 23 points
and grabbed 10 rebounds in the game. For the season, Brown is scoring
22.6 ppg and averaging 7.3 rpg. Forward Dennis Burns scored 25
against Kansas on 11-of-16 shooting. He scores 13.0 ppg.
