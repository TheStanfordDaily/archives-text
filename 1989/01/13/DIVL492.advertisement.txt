Stop fooling around. It's time to get hardcore about software. With Microsoft.
We'll give you all the resources you want. Tens of millions in R&D funding. Along
with one of the most elementary tools for thinking — a door, which leads to your own
private office. All backed by management that truly does speak your language, because
they probably helped write it.
We're serious about software design. If you are too, then sign up for an off-campus
interview.
Software Design Engineers
We're working on everything from compilers, operating systems, and networking to so
phisticated graphics, powerful productivity software and more. In fact we're working
on some truly visionary ideas we can't even reveal yet. You could be too, if you have
programming experience and a background that includes micro's, "C", or Pascal, 8086,
68000, UNIX TM /XENIX®, Macintosh® Toolbox, or MS-DOS®.
Program Managers
Instant responsibility. You select the features, you shape the product, you design the
user interface for new generations of software. Guide product development from pro
gramming through documentation and testing. Keep your product at the forefront of
technology by knowing your competition and product trends.
There are opportunities to work with our teams in applications, systems, languages,
or CD-ROM. If you're about to graduate with a B.S. in computer science, math or re
lated major, we want to talk to you.
Microsoft offers you an opportunity to live and work where the quality of life is high
and the cost of living is low — the beautiful Pacific Northwest. Along with amenities
such as a health club membership, workout facilities and parcourse, plus an array of
benefits.
We will be interviewing for the above positions Wednesday, January 25th at the
Stanford Park Hotel. Please call us COLLECT at
(206) 882-8624 by January 20th to sign up for an \
interview if you have not already done so with
your Placement Office.
We arc an equal opportunity employer.
