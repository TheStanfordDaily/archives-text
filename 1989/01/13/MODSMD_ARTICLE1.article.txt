# Kennedy ad draws praise with caution
## 
### Elaine Riggs Staff writer 
Responding yesterday to University President
Donald Kennedy's essay on racism, students from
Stanford's different ethnic communities praised his
themes of racial understanding but still questioned
specific University goals and promises for funding.
Kennedy possesses "a beautiful vision of having
a serious multicultural education here," said Black
Student Union Secretary Louis Jackson.
Jackson said that sweeping changes such as the
new course "Cultures, Ideas and Values," more
ethnic studies classes and higher recruitment of
minority faculty will bring about Kennedy's vision.
MEChA officer Alex Sweet said the Chicano com
munity had been waiting for such an essay by
Kennedy for some time now, and that they were
generally pleased with it. But they did have some
reservations.
Released on Tuesday, the statement, entitled
Reflections on Racial Understanding, dealt with the
challenges facing the creation of a multicultural
community at Stanford. The statement came in
response to last quarter's racial incident at Ujamaa
House.
Richard Suh, Issues Committee chair of the Asian-
American Students Association, expressed disap
pointment after reading the statement. "It sounded
like he was calling for ethnic studies and women's
studies but he was unclear," Suh said.
In his essay, Kennedy suggested that many here
may have been too quick to urge sanctions against
the offenders in recent incidents.
"I was surprised by how many members of the
community were prepared to urge the swift and
arbitrary application of sanctions in the Ujamaa
case. Even now, there has been too little attention
to the counterposed value of free expression," Ken
nedy wrote.
Suh said Kennedy's reference to free speech
"diluted what he was saying and made it confusing."
It was unclear as to whether Kennedy was con
demning what happened at Ujamaa; the statement
could have been stronger, according to Suh.
"The understanding that the ethnic communities
had was that it was already agreed that this was
not an issue of free speech and that these people
had violated the terms of the res
idence agreement and other stand
ards of decency that we have at
Stanford," Suh added.
In the Ujamaa case, two fresh
men drew a racist flier which they
then posted in the University's
black theme house, drawing a
swift, angry reaction from stu
dents in Ujamaa and other resi
dences.
This Wednesday, it was an
nounced that the two students
had violated the University
housing agreement and could not
live in student residences for two
quarters.
In his statement, Kennedy also
called for one-on-one interaction
to reach a cultural understanding

between students. "We are asking
young people to ignore the habitJ
of comfort, and to seek out
with whom they are unfamiliarf
and sometimes ill at ease," KenJ
nedy wrote.

programs are often needed beforq
students can interact, one student)

said he and his Chicano friendq
sense that the University is push-f
ing students to get to know stu-f

that [interaction] down
throats," said Canul, adding that|
multicultural programs are a bet
