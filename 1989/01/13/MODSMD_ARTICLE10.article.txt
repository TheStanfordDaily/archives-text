# Pastor struggles for sanctuary
## 
### Maryellen Driscoll 
In 1984, he was convicted for
transporting and harboring illegal
aliens into the United States. He
said that in 1986 the Immigration
and Naturalization Service only
granted political asylum to 2 per
cent of Salvadoran refugees. De
spite these setbacks, Arizona
pastor John Fife said Wednesday
night that he will continue to fight
U.S. policy and find sanctuary for
Central American refugees.
"They plead with us. 'Please
don't send us back,' " Fife said in
reference to the first Salvadoran
refugees his Tucson, Ariz, parish
took under its wing in 1981. Fife's
parish, the Southside Pres
bytarian Church, has provided
sanctuary to about 7,000 Central
Americans over the past eight
years.
Wearing a large silver buckle
and cowboy boots, Fife fiercely
criticized the U.S. policy on refu
gees, describing it as increasingly

repressive and restrictive, highly
politicized and in violation of in
ternational law.
Fife is co-founder of the sanc
tuary movement, under which
more than 500 Jewish, Protestant
and Catholic parishes have pro
vided sanctuary — food, shelter,
medical care and legal aid — for
Central American refugees who
fear for their lives.
"They talked about death
squads, dead bodies in the
streets," he said of the refugees.
The refugees face severe repres
sion and war; they are terrified,
according to Fife.
"They didn't want to leave their
homes and their families, but they
had to," he said.
According to Fife, the sanctuary
movement is the largest grass
roots resistance movement in the
U.S. since the abolition move
ment.
Since 1981, the United Nations
High Commission on refugees has
informed the United States gov

ernment that it is violating inter,
national standards and inter
national law by continuing to
deport people back to Central
America, Fife said.
"The response of the United
States government has been a
deafening silence and thousands
of deportations issued," he said.
"Chinese tennis stars, Russian
ballerinas, Czech hockey players
— no problem. Salvadorans
fleeing death squads, torture
chambers — no chance."
An estimated 500,000 Sal
vadorans have fled to the United
States.
According to Fife, the United
Nations' protocols on the treat
ment of refugees state that people
who have a legitimate fear of per
secution must be granted asylum
when they cross the border. The
United States has failed to uphold
this obligation by deporting refu
gees and is violating human rights
and the international community,
he said.
