## Bush names Watkins, Bennett to complete Cabinet 
### 
WASHINGTON (AF) — President-elect
George Bush completed his Cabinet yes
terday, picking retired naval chief James
Watkins, an expert on nuclear power, as
energy secretary and appointing former
Education Secretary William Bennett to
help lead an "all-out war against drugs."
Bush said Watkins' experience would
Aerve him well in devising a strategy for
a multibillion-dollar cleanup of the na
tion's aging and increasingly unsafe nu
elear weapons plants.
Bush said he would not try to tone
down Bennett, who has a reputation for
being blunt and blustery. "I'm not going
to ask him to renounce that vim and
that vigor and that determination that
made him a howling success" in Reagan's
administration, Bush said.
, Bennett, a two-pack-a-day cigarette
smoker who has tried to quit and failed,

vowed he would give up
his habit before begin
ning his new job.
Senate Judiciary Com
mittee Chair Joseph
Biden, D-Del., praised
Bennett for his "reputa
tion for being tough and
for confronting issues
head on" but said he was
concerned about Ben-

nett's lack of law enforcement back
ground.
Biden said Bennett in the past "has
been critical of our public school system.
I hope that his attitude will change to
recognize, as I do, the crucial role the
public schools can play in helping our
youngest children recognize the dangers
of drug abuse."
Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, senior

GOP member of the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee, called
Watkins "straightforward and capable."
U.S. arms control adviser Edwin
Rowny praised the selection of Watkins
and called it a boost for the Strategic
Defense Initiative, also known as Star
Wars, which seeks to develop a space
based defense against Soviet ballistic mis
siles.
Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chair of
the House narcotics committee, said he
is ready to work with Bennett "to fully
fund the anti-drug programs the
Congress has authorized and to develop
a thorough, well thought-out strategy. I
hope is is forthcoming with creative ideas.
He must take bold initiatives and
generate new resources to solve the drug
crisis in our nation."
Bush announced his personnel choices

at a news conference
shortly before convening
the first informal meet
ing of his Cabinet across
the street from the White
House at Blair House,
the government guest
home.
Bush said he wanted
Cabinet chiefs "to think
big, to challenge the sys-

tem, to adhere to the highest ethical
standards." And he said, "I'm going to
tell them I don't like kiss-and-tell books."
"I don't mind differences being aired,"
Bush said. "I want them to be frank, I
want them to fight hard for their posi
tion." Yet he said he expected them to
support his decisions once they're made.
Replying to a question, Bush said he
was "not entirely" comfortable with the

cost of his inauguration, which could
reach $25 million. However, Bush said,
"I have no apologies for the way we're
doing it at all" because the country
deserves a celebration like the inaugura
tion every four years.
Bush, who takes office Jan. 20, ac
knowledged that he faces huge costs both
in the cleanup of nuclear weapons facil
ities and the crisis of the savings and
loan industry.
However, Bush, who during the cam
paign promised not to raise taxes, said
he would solve both problems "within
the confines, the parameters of the com
mitment I made to the American people."
In introducing Watkins, Bush said,
"I'm committed to solving the problems
that exist within our atomic energy
defense complex."
