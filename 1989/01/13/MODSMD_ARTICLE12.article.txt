### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Rosa Parks, whose refusal
■ to sit at the hack of the bus sparked the modern
civil rights movement, said the fight continues
J as she joined others yesterday honoring the Rev.
| Martin Luther King Jr.
King rose to prominence after Mrs. Parks' ac
! tion in December 1955 in Montgomery, Ala., set
J the stage for a boycott and subsequent demon
j strations that caught the nation by surprise.
King was killed April 4, 1968, in Memphis,
Tenn., and what would be his 60th birthday
\ Sunday is celebrated as a national holiday Mon
; day; the celebration began with several events
; yesterday.
! Mrs. Parks, 75, praised King as she answered
J questions on radio station WLIB. She said the
; struggle to attain rights is not over.
"I feel a kindred to the people of South Africa
> as well as any other people who are being denied
! freedom, and as we try to free ourselves we must
help those who are not free and are suffering all

kinds of physical reprisals or denial," she told
listeners.
"It seems as long as we don't all unite together
en masse that we will have to repeat marches
over and over again and I do hope to live to
know and see the day come when we will all be
free citizens, to have any opportunity any other
persons have to assume the responsibilities as
others."
At a breakfast at the Waldorf-Astoria sponsored
by the NAACP and Anheuser-Busch Cos., several
people were honored who exemplified King's
meaning of taking "the measure of a man" at
times "of challenge and controversy."
Those honored were Jean Griffith, mother of
a man killed on a Howard Beach, Queens,
parkway after being chased by a gang of whites
in December 1986; Jean Chappell, president of
an advocacy and service group helping welfare
hotel residents; and Diane and Ernest McCaine,
who adopted a child with AIDS.
