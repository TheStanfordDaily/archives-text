# Kohl admits Libya plant link
## West German authorities embarrassed by revelation 
### 
BONN, West Germany (AP) â€”
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said yes
terday authorities seized new doc
uments that may show West Ger
man companies helped Libya
build what Washington says is a
chemical weapons plant.
Kohl gave no details about the
documents while answering ques
tions from reporters in a studio
appearance late Thursday night
on West Germany's ZDF televi
sion network.
The government previously
maintained it had no evidence of
a West German link to the plant
at Rabta, south of Tripoli, the
Libyan capital. The stunning
reversal embarrassed West Ger
man authorities.
NBC News reported yesterday
that Libyan officials contacted
West German companies for
clean-up help after a dangerous
chemical spill in August at the
facility
West Germany's Imhausen-
Chemie was one of those the
Libyans called for help, the net
work reported.
A group of West Germans was

in the United States this week to
examine evidence that Washing
ton says indicates the Libyan
plant is a chemical weapons fac
tory Libya says the facility is a
pharmaceutical plant.
"There are new indications that
will be further checked," Kohl
said when asked if the government
had new evidence of West German
involvement in building the plant.
"More documents have been
seized and they could give
evidence, I don't know."
Kohl said the documents in
volved chemical equipment that
could be used in many ways, but
he did not elaborate. He did not
say where the papers were seized.
He said the federal intelligence
service also was involved in in
vestigations. Kohl said authorities
were looking for evidence that
could stand in court before bring
ing any charges.
A ranking official said on con
dition of anonymity: "There is no
question that these allegations
have caused serious damage to
West Germany's international
prestige. The government is in an

extremely embarrassing and dif
ficult position."
In Washington, West German
finance Minister Gerhard Stol
tenberg noted his government in
itially rejected U.S. allegations
that a German company played a
major role in the construction of
the plant.
He said there was no more ill
will between Washington and
Bonn.
"I'm glad that by the political
discussions some bad feeling
which came up for a few days
could be cleared up and that we
could have this discussion now in
a good atmosphere of mutual
cooperation (and) mutual respon
sibility," Stoltenber said.
President Reagan has raised the
possiblity of military action
against the plant.
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, who told reporters a
week earlier there was no proof
of West German complicity, said
Thursday: "There are a number
of indications that evidently point
in this direction."
