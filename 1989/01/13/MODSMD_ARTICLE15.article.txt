Peruvian rebels blamed in deaths
LIMA, Peru (AP) — A New Jersey mayor's
wife who died in a Dec. 1 rail crash in Peru's
Andes Mountains was most likely the victim of
sabotage bv a leftist guerrillas, the U.S. Embassy
said yesterday.
Anna Cucci was killed and her husband, Jersey
City Mayor Anthony Cucci, was injured Dec. 1
when the rail car they rode crashed near Cuzco,
355 miles southeast of Lima.
She is the fourth American known to have
been killed as a result of the Maoist Shining
Path's nearly 9-year-old insurgency.
Peruvian authorities at the time said saboteurs
wedged a 10-inch steel rod into the tracks, which
caused the single car to derail and tumble down
a 250-foot sloped ravine.
I hey said either guerrillas or workers support
ing a communist-led general strike caused the
accident, which also killed Doris Chacon, the wife
of Cuzco Mayor Carlos Chacon, and severely in
jured the mayor.

The embassy said yesterday that Peruvian in
vestigators since have reached the opinion that
the guerrillas were behind the attack.
Local officials believe Chacon was the rebels'
most likely target, the embassy said.
Britain crash spurs U.S. testing
WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. airlines began
testing yesterday for faulty engine warning sys
tems in Boeing 737 airliners similar to one that
crashed in England. A press representative for
one U.S carrier said 80 percent of its 737s had
been tested with no problems found.
Officials of other airlines said they were com
plying with the testing as a precautionary mea
sure but expected to find no faulty wiring of fire
and vibration warning lights that might mislead
a pilot into shutting down his only good engine
if the other one showed problems.
That is one possibility being investigated in
England, where a British Midland 737 crash
killed 44 people Sunday.
