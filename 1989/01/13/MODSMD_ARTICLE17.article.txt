## Appropriate action 
### 
University response to
Dugan and Heldt proves
racism not tolerated

UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT
Donald Kennedy opened the
school year by stressing that
racism would not be tolerated on
this campus. On Tuesday, the Uni
versity banned two freshmen from
any residence community for two
quarters because of a racist act
they committed three weeks into
the school year.
By placing a poster of Beethoven
degradingly caricatured as a black
man in their residence, they vio
lated the Stanford Residence
Agreement, signed by every
student in University housing,
which requires that students treat
others in University residences
with respect.
The two-quarter banishment
from any student residence was not
so severe as to create resentment
or hatred, but it was long enough
to match the seriousness of the
action. The pair has and will suffer
additional "punishment" due to the
publicity and reaction created by
their actions.
Possibly more important than
the individual punishment, the
University's ban sends a signal
that Stanford students cannot per
petuate acts of racism without
facing the consequences.
Additionally, the University sent
a signal to minority communities
on this campus that their concerns
are the concerns of the entire Stan
ford community. They are not the
only ones fighting for the rights
and respect they deserve.
While appropriate, the Univer
sity action should not be misper

ceived as an attempt to squelch
free thought and dialogue on the
subjects involved. The distinction
between "actions" and "dialogue"
must be made clear.
Racist "actions" are impermis
sible. But informal, open dialogue
remains a necessary feature of any
plan to raise the sensitivity of all
students to all cultures, especially
those which they fail to understand
or respect. Intellectual debate is
the primary role of any university,
and non-classroom events provide
a greater spark than any other to
spread the fire of discussion.
The University action must not
also be mistaken to be sufficient
in combatting the problems of rac
ism. Further actions, which may
be more important in eradicating
the mindset that allows racist ac
tions to surface, are still needed:
punitive, rehabilitative, educa
tional and institutional methods
must be utilized together.
Punitive measures were justly
taken by the University in this
case, and the rehabilitative process
will occur when the pair of fresh
men return to a residence commu
nity. Much improvement, however,
remains necessary in the educa
tional and institutional areas, as
the Coalition of Color's "Mandate
for Change" correctly points out.
Residential Education and Coun
cil of Presidents have initiated solid
dorm programs to fight racism and
should continue them with even
more zeal and determination.
Educational structures such as
an ethnic studies requirement
should be implemented soon; final
ly, institutional improvements
must occur through a more
balanced and fair hiring of minor
ity and women faculty.
Only through a proper combina
tion of all methods will the ugly
head of racism be separated from
the body of Stanford.
