## Pay hikes are justifiable 
### 
Ronald reagan took time out
from saddling up last week to en
dorse a proposed 51 percent pay
hike for top federal officials — executive,
judicial and congressional. The House
and Senate must both veto the raise,
from $89,500 to $135,000 annually for
members of those chambers, by Feb. 8,
or else . . . well, or else they get the raise.
The temptation to rail against that pro
posed pay hike is almost irresistible.
Predictably, some influential types in
Washington just couldn't help them
selves. Multi-millionaire Ralph Nader,
fresh from outlawing inflation in Cali
fornia insurance, labels the raise a plot
by the "upper economic elite" to tighten
their grip on government. "Top federal
officials now make ... at least five times
the average worker's wage," he drones.
"In a democracy, this is a sufficient dis
tance between the political rulers and the
ruled who pay their salary."
The appeal of this Huey Long-style
populism, as Washington Post columnist
David Broder points out, is immediately
evident. Just imagine the reaction down
at the Bowl-O-Rama if you were to stroll
in and announce that our congressman
needs a raise, because he just can't
squeeze by on 89,500 a year. Polite re
sponses, and perfectly understandable
ones too, might include, "Hey, try getting
by on my pay!" or "Can't live on $90
grand? No wonder those clowns can't bal
ance the budget."
Members of Congress hear and fear
these voters. So they continually veto
increases in their own salaries, along with
those of other top federal officials, to the

point that those salaries have shrunk by
one-third in constant dollars since 1968.
Testimony delivered to the Quadren
nial Commission, which issued the raise
recommendation, demonstrated the con
sequences of that shrinkage. For the ex
ecutive branch, Anthony Fauci, director
of AIDS research at the National In
stitutes of Health, presented the results
of the NIH salary ceilings set at about
half the amount paid in similar positions
with universities and industries.
"Over the last decade, NIH has not
been able to recruit a single senior re
search scientist from the private or aca
demic sectors to engage in ... a clinical
or basic biomedical research program. . . .
Not one." The average tenure of a top
executive branch employee, incidentally,
is 18 months -r- hardly long enough for
him or her to learn the job, and not
nearly enough to make any impact once
he or she has learned it.
The situation in the judiciary is equally
discouraging. The number of federal
judges who resigned increased tenfold
during the period 1974-88 compared to
a similar span in 1958-73. Most junior
attorneys appearing in a federal trial will
be earning more than the the presiding
judge.
But perhaps the most moving tes
timony of all came from Robert Duncan,
a black judge who stepped down in 1985,
at 57, to enter private practice.
"The decision to leave the bench was
agonizing," he said, but "after 11 1/2
years of 60- to 65-hour work weeks,"
after death threats to self and family,
"my wife was still working, we had not

traveled outside the country, and I was
unable to foresee how 1 could afford to
send my youngest daughter to the uni
versity of our choice."
In fairness, Congress may need the
raise less than the other two branches
do — though the sizable cost of main
taining two houses, one in Washington
and one back home, puts many members
on the tightest of personal budgets. But
the Quad Commission's recommendation
here is in fact a trade-off: Congress gets
a hefty raise, but must then outlaw
honoraria for speaking before and
schmoozing with lobby groups.
The best solution may require a con
stitutional amendment: take the decision
of congressional pay out of the hands of
Congress and tie it to inflation. After all,
isn't a vote on one's own pay a bit of a
conflict of interest?
When all's said and done, the raise will
pass. We won't be paying these officials
nearly what most of them could earn
tomorrow if they were to quit today, and
we shouldn't (and probably couldn't).
Public office must never become tempt
ing due to a high salary. But if we value
good government, we cannot allow it to
become repellant to the best and brightest
due to a low one.
