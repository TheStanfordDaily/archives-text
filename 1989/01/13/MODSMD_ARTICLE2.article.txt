# S. African says violence only chance for change

### John Wagner Staff writer 
The "unbelievable hypocri
sy" of the United States and
other Western nations in im
posing sanctions and disinvest
ing from South Africa has left
the black majority no alterna
tive but violence to bring about
change, the Rev. Allan Boesak
said last night.
Boesak, a prominent black

South African anti-apartheid
leader, told a crowd of close to
1,000 in Memorial Auditorium
that the lack of commitment
from Western nations to
"breaking the back" of apart
heid has placed black South
Africans in an extremely diffi
cult dilemma.
"We are not calling for vio
lence," Boesak said, "but we

want you (Americans) to under
stand how difficult the situation
is in South Africa."
Boesak's appearance was one of
several campus events commerat
ing Martin Luther King Jr. in con
junction with the national holiday.
The American civil rights leader
— who was assassinated in
Memphis on April 4, 1968 —
would have been 60 years old on
Sunday.
The commemoration events are
sponsored by several student and
administrative groups.
Those in the United States who
are urging black South Africans
to maintain a peaceful resistance
are really the ones who are
making non-violence impossible,
Boesak said. When black South
Africans resort to violence, Boesak
said, those same people will claim
that blacks are inherently violent.
In order to rid South Africa of
"the beast" of apartheid, he said,

a firmer commitment from West
ern leaders is imperative.
"It is an impossible task to fight
Pretoria and London and Wash
ington and France and Tokyo at
the same time," he said.
In fact, Boesak said, a commit
ment by the United States and
other Western nations to just
three specific sanctions "would be
more than enough" to topple the
white minority government.
According to Boesak, Western
nations should:
• Refuse to buy South African
gold;
• Cut off air travel between
their country and South Africa;
and
• Refuse to reschedule debt
repayment on South African
loans.
These three measures "are at
tainable," he said, and if imposed,
would cause "fundamental
changes" almost immediately.
Boesak said that economic self
interest, not sound reasoning, has
led the Reagan Administration to

argue that sanctions hurt black
South Africans as well as the gov
ernment.
Considering the lack of concern
President Reagan has shown for
blacks in the United States,
Boesak said, it is impossible to
believe that he feels compassion
for blacks in South Africa.
"Ronald Reagan's not con
cerned about black people,"
Boesak said.
Addressing the issue of racism
in the United States, Boesak said
that "a new kind of morality" had
evolved here during the past eight
years which has made it "fash
ionable to be unconcerned about
others."
Boesak heads the World Alli
ance of Reformed Churches,
which represents about 70 million
Christians, and is a founder of
the United Democratic Front,
South Africa's largest anti
apartheid coalition. The coalition,
which includes about 700 activist
groups, was born at a mass rally
in Cape Town, South Africa, in
August 1983.
