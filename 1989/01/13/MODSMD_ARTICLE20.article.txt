## Racial polarization heightened by CIV 
### 
I FIND THE RACIAL INCIDENTS
at Ujamaa House very disturbing
and would like to offer some in
sight into their cause and how the
situation can be improved.
During my time at Stanford I wit
nessed racial polarization among al
most all of my friends and dormmates.
By the end of the year at Okada
House, mealtimes found all of the
Asian students and all the non-Asians
(except several Asian freshmen who
had not asked for a theme house) at
separate tables. The same polarization
happened with black students in Bran
ner Hall my freshman year.
One reason for this is that many
minorities came from high schools and
neighborhoods where they were either
in the majority or were members of
circles of friends all from their back
ground. When they first came to Stan
ford, they were understandably uncom
fortable with the idea of having to
assimilate.
But the real reason for their trepida
tion was the constant theme of "racism
on campus," "residual racism," etc. It
made everyone afraid of contacts with
each other, quick to attribute bad
experiences to racism and unlikely to
understand the cause of each other's
bad feelings.
Imagine a typical junior high school
dance where the girls are lined up on
one side of the gym, the boys on the
other. If the teachers whispered to
each side, "The reason they don't want
to dance with you is that they really
hate you," would that help break the
ice?
Since graduating I've returned to
Los Angeles, an environment with just
as many minorities as at Stanford; but
we get along much better in the real
world than we ever did in college. Our
college experiences were in atmospheres
far more racially tense than the real
world's.

Different ethnic groups get
along much better in the
real world than they ever
did in college.

Meanwhile, the student body at
UCLA has been reduced to racial
voting blocs and Hispanics were so
upset that their candidate was kept off
the ballot due to his GPA that ballot
boxes were stolen and vandalized.
This is a complete breakdown of
democracy in one of the most pres
tigious universitites in the country Yet
America's elections, which are far more
important than student elections, go
smoothly.
This is an inversion of the usual
atmosphere of a higher educational
institution: there is less enlightenment,
less tolerance than in the world
around it. Something must be done.
Racial power politics are damaging our
college communities and wrecking the
quality of education for everyone.
Stanford's is a zero-sum, interest
group community, where the racial
makeup of the Student Senate is
paramount, where Dante is only a
"white male" and Cisneros only a
"hispanic female," and where one
group's gain is another's loss.
I predict a future of rising white
resentment with the CIV program —
even though everyone has much to lose
from CIV, which is an intellectual farce
of low value to graduates. (Let me
assure you, after college John Locke
will be more relevant than Guatemalan
revolutionaries.)
All these rallies, attacks, epithets
and dorm discussions are pointing to
the fact that students increasingly feel
their race, class and gender are more
important than their souls, ideas and

values. Instead of education liberating
us all from wrong cultural or personal
attitudes, it is binding us to stereo
types.
This is obvious when students in the
sciences are more tolerant than those
in the humanities. By remaining aloof
from the controversy, they are free to
learn, meet other people and gain their
friendship. Meanwhile, in the humani
ties (my degree is in political science)
are the bulk of loony-left noise, as well
as the most dissatisfied students. Is it
not obvious that this exacerbates racial
tensions?
I am not Greek, but I share the
wealth of Greek knowledge that Scot
land's chilly cave-dwellers did not
produce. I am not Italian, but I appre
ciate the Renaissance. I am not Jewish
but I worship a Jewish Messiah. Truth
is truth and lies and lies, regardless of
their source. Any idea to the contrary
is relativistic hogwash. In its extreme,
cultural relativism leads to the (cor
rect) conclusion that if everything is
true, then nothing is true, because the
term "truth" has lost its meaning.
Nihilism is the real value that CIV
and racially-motivated campus politics
are imparting to Stanford's students. It
is being revealed in the growing apathy
of the student body and the diminish
ing prestige of the University's human
ities program, even as its engineering
programs gain fame worldwide.
The radical trivia and perversion of
classics for political ends are anti
enlightenment. Racial resentment will
worsen as long as these deadly ideas
prevail on campus. And ideas can be
deadly.
When we inject our brightest young
people into an environment that
destroys their dignity by reducing them
to labels, we are doing a grave disser
vice to them and to our civilization.

I FIND THE RACIAL INCIDENTS
at Ujamaa House very disturbing
and would like to offer some in
sight into their cause and how the
situation can be improved.
During my time at Stanford I wit
nessed racial polarization among al
most all of my friends and dormmates.
By the end of the year at Okada
House, mealtimes found all of the
Asian students and all the non-Asians
(except several Asian freshmen who
had not asked for a theme house) at
separate tables. The same polarization
happened with black students in Bran
ner Hall my freshman year.
One reason for this is that many
minorities came from high schools and
neighborhoods where they were either
in the majority or were members of
circles of friends all from their back
ground. When they first came to Stan
ford, they were understandably uncom
fortable with the idea of having to
assimilate.
But the real reason for their trepida
tion was the constant theme of "racism
on campus," "residual racism," etc. It
made everyone afraid of contacts with
each other, quick to attribute bad
experiences to racism and unlikely to
understand the cause of each other's
bad feelings.
Imagine a typical junior high school
dance where the girls are lined up on
one side of the gym, the boys on the
other. If the teachers whispered to
each side, "The reason they don't want
to dance with you is that they really
hate you," would that help break the
ice?
Since graduating I've returned to
Los Angeles, an environment with just
as many minorities as at Stanford; but
we get along much better in the real
world than we ever did in college. Our
college experiences were in atmospheres
far more racially tense than the real
world's.

Different ethnic groups get
along much better in the
real world than they ever
did in college.

Meanwhile, the student body at
UCLA has been reduced to racial
voting blocs and Hispanics were so
upset that their candidate was kept off
the ballot due to his GPA that ballot
boxes were stolen and vandalized.
This is a complete breakdown of
democracy in one of the most pres
tigious universitites in the country Yet
