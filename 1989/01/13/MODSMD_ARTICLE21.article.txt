# There's more to law students than their LSAT scores

Something happens to people when
they apply to law school. Talented,
strong, dynamic individuals begin to
feel they are summed up by a number
called an LSAT score.
If their number falls beneath some
imaginary cut-ofT score of acceptability,
they consider themselves worthless
candidates for a career in law.
LSATs are indeed one criterion that
an admissions committee uses to evalu
ate a candidate's merit. But the num
bers are only a fraction of what an
application consists of.
"I can't apply to the Top 10," said
one athletic community activist whose
personal essay was one of the best
written I'd seen. "My LSAT is only a
39. I know 10 people who got a 47."
"You know a lot of liars," I said.
In past years the average score of all
Stanford students who took the LSAT
was about 39. Some did better than
that. Others did not. And in a few
years, no one will give a damn.
Yes, it is difficult to get into law
school nowadays. It is especially diffi
cult for people applying right out of
college who don't bring a lot of work
or life experience to their application.
Waiting a year or two to apply in
creases your chances far more than
getting a high LSAT score.
In the meantime, prospective law
students shouldn't let the application
process strip them of their sense of
self-worth.
