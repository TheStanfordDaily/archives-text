## Stepping into a career CPPC helps recruitment of students 
### Jennifer Cotteleer Staff writer 
Sometimes the common perception that Stanford
graduates offer employers the best and brightest
candidates eases the recruitment process for many
job-hunters on the Farm.
Nonetheless, the chances of a job offer increase
dramatically once students enter the recruiting arena
promoted at Stanford. The process of recruiting is
a mechanism by which employers and potential em
ployers find each other.
Experts say a timely entrance into the recruiting
process is important. "We service between 1,200
and 1,400 students each year," according to Yolanda
Morales, supervisor of Recruitment Activities and
Career Faire Coordinator. She pointed out that stu
dents must register for assistance from the Career
Planning and Placement Center if they want any
aid in the sometimes bewildering interview process,
especially at the start. "Students need to come see
us" she said.
The CPPC serves as a clearinghouse for employers
and Stanford students. Employers contact the CPPC
for help in reaching the students that they want to
hire. The CPPC in turn helps to make students
available to the companies, and lets the companies
know what it is that students need or expect from
them.
This communication results in the various job
fairs held on campus throughout the year, notably
the Career Faire. These are the large-scale, informal
means for companies to reach students.
Additionally, companies organize and present

smaller informal information sessions to allow stu
dents to meet personnel and iearn about the com
pany in a non-pressured situation. "Many companies
are on campus for a week before holding interviews,"
according to Morales. These informal sessions are
followed up by the more formal interview process.
Companies may be looking for either a specific
set of majors and skills, or they may be looking
more broadly across the majors for specific qualities.
"We fall into the latter group", according to Chris
Brahm of Bain & Co., a management consulting
firm, "we'll look for any type of academic back
ground in terms of degree."
Brahm said that his company looks for students
with a certain character. They want a student who
displays a consistent high level of achievement, both
academically and just as importantly, non
academically. "The activity is not so important, more
the desire to excel," he said.
He stressed that they are looking for students
who are strong across all skills, and that they have
hired Stanford graduates from a breadth of majors
including physics, art history, economics, engineer
ing, political science and international relations. "We
in no way limit our scope to a few majors . . . the
nature of the person is important as opposed to the
content of their background."
Hewlett-Packard falls into the former category.
Allen Edwards, Research and Development Section
manager, stressed the will at HP to find the job to
fit the person. HP will hire about 700 students
nationwide this year for a wide range of jobs. Many
will be those with bachelor's and master's degrees
from the engineering, computer science and related
majors. The PhDs hired by HP this year will come
from those majors as well as chemistry and physics.
Edwards feels that students have a hard time
putting down their objectives clearly and honestly,
but that if they can do that, a place can be found
for them at HP. "It doesn't do anyone any good to
offer a student a job that they are going to turn
down," said Edwards. HP managers want to match
people's interests as opposed to their skills, working
from the assumption that every Stanford graduate
in their chosen major is qualified. HP even goes so
far as to run a session to coach the students on
how to come across well in an interview.
The most important thing recruiting directors
emphasize is that students get involved early and
utilize the resources that are offered to them by
both the CPPC and the individual companies.
Morales reminds students to take advantage of
Stanford's accessible environment for recruitment.
The recruiting circuit not only beckons high-tech
junkies but offers job opportunities to achievers in
all fields.
