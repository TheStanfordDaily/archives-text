# Ways to get started at the CPPC
## 
### 
• Attend an orientation January 12 (noon to
1:00 p.m., 4:00-5:00 p.m.)
• Talk to a counselor (full-time, peer counselors
or intern counselors)
• Think about being diverse — there's more
out there than 9-to-5 suit-and-tie office jobs
• Ask specific questions — what do you want
to know?
• Participate in workshops (resume, career
decision-making and interviewing)
• Arrange to have a CPPC representative speak
to your dorm or student group
