# What'd Santa Bring You?
## Presents of Christmas past 
### 
It's not fair, my brother got
a computer for Christmas.
When I was a kid all I got was
"Slime." You remember
"Slime," the product of an in
dustrial accident in some Na
tional Research Laboratory:
Scientist: (frantically, into
phone) "Is thin the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission? Oh
my Cod, help, we dropped a
comb intj a vat of toxic waste,
which has created a giant at
tacking blob of green cancer
causing slime. You've got to
send over a team to clean it
up. We're evacuating for a
radius of r 5O miles and
what?. . . . Add worms and
eyeballs and sell it to kids?. . . .
Oh, OK, thanks."
But in terms of really disgust
ing toys you couldn't beat
"Suckerman," which was a rub
bery figure covered with suction
cups that you would (a) throw

against every single item in your
household to see if it would stick,
including pets, (b) press into
your skin until you had sucker
marks all over your body, and
then run around the house
screaming that you'd been at
tacked by a giant squid like in
"20,000 Leagues Under the
Sea," and (c) turn into "Suck
eramputee" after it got boring,
and feed each limb to the dog.
And once for Christmas I got
an ant farm, which is essentially
two pieces of plastic, a bunch
of sand and a coupon for ants.
You'd send the coupon off to an
ant clearinghouse in the Mid
west and two weeks later a small
box would arrive filled with live
ants. Two long weeks. Two
weeks where each day you would
run out to the mailbox with a
grin of excitement on your face
as you hoped — oh how you
hoped — that your ants would

be there. You did not know, of
course, that years later you
would occupy a dorm room with
roughly a 1:1 ratio of ants to
air molecules.
But I bring up the fact that
I only got ants and "Sucker
man" and "Slime" for Christ
mas when I was a kid — "Slime"
without worms mind you — to
point out that my brother got
a computer for Christmas. A
Macintosh computer.
My parents got him the Mac
intosh with the reasoning that
with college only a year or so
away the computer would be
able to help him with his
studies. And what a teaching
tool it's been. So far he has
learned:
• To proceed to level two of
"Leather Goddesses of Phobos"
you must crack your whip at
the Andalusian harlot and say
"Phlugh."
• Behind the wine cellar in
"Deja Vu" there is an aban
doned speakeasy that contains
a key to solving the mystery.
• If you crash into the Sears
Tower in "Flight Simulator" it
makes a really cool sound.
And yet, despite its utility as
illustrated above, the modern
computer performs tasks almost
exactly as they have been per-
