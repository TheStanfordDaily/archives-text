He'll be doing that and a whole lot more
when Mark Russell comes to Memorial Audi
torium tomorrow night with his piano-based
comedy for a show and Inaugural reception.
Russell, whose political humor has been seen
everywhere from his PBS specials to "Real
People" (see related story), will have comments
on our newest President, our oldest President
and some local issues as well.
You know him, you love him, but unless you
already have tickets you can't see him. Mark
Russell is sold out. However, tickets for the
rest of the Lively Arts season are on sale now,
and the following shows are expected to sell
