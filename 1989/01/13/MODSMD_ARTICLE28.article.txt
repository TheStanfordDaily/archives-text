## The 						medium-sized chill 
### Kathy Kleist Staff writer 
If you haven't read the book "The Ac
cidental Tourist," I think you'll find the
movie a disappointment. Other critics have
described the story as subtle, moving and
beautifully restrained; I found it nearly
non-existent.
Yes, the performances by William Hurt,
Kathleen Turner and Geena Davis are con
sistent and artistic — one might even call
them consummate — but here seems to
be very little to consume.
In the film, Sarah Leary (Turner) an
nounces she wants a divorce from her hus
band Macon (Hurt) because he has not
given her enough support in the year since
their young son was murdered.
For the rest of the story the movie tries
to put us inside Macon's head as he goes
through the changes brought about by his
separation and by his subsequent involve
ment with a truly odd dog trainer, Muriel
Pritchett (Davis) and her son.

Unfortunately, the viewer is never fully
able to enter into the thought processes
and feelings of Hurt's Macon.
While the characters in Muriel and
Macon's family are quite wonderfully ec
centric, the movie fails to deliver that
degree of empathy necessary to elicit joy
or sadness with Macon. You can see what
he is feeling, but you don't feel it yourself.
"The Accidental Tourist" is deliberately
paced, and while it is visually interesting
it is not exciting. Director Lawrence ("The
Big Chill") Kasdan has tried to create an
other film in which the viewer's discovery
of in-depth relationships between the main
characters is enthralling and entertaining.
He does not succeed. We are not enthralled.
The wonderful 60s soundtrack in"The
Big Chill" helped the viewer considerably
to enter into the feeling of that film, but
this one lacks both the soundtrack and the
rich, inner dialogue we expect.

"The Accidental Tourist" is currently play
ing at the Century 10 Cinemas
