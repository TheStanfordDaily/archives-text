## Interview with a real person John Barbour talks about TV, movies and how to break into showbiz 
### Andrew Berkowitz Editorial staff 
Emmy Award winner John Barbour,
55, is best known as the originator and
co-host of the extremely popular televi
sion show "Real People" in the 19705.
It was the show that brought to television
such characters as the "Stripper for
God," and Dr. Steven Kaplan, the only
professional vampire hunter in America.
However, before "Real People," Bar
bour had a long career, first as a stand
up comedian on stage arid in television,
and later as the originator of the "A.M."
program in Los Angeles.
iMter, Barbour worked for many years
as a television and film critic. He was
the first to review television on televi
sion, and one of the first to review
movies in that medium.
Now, 10 years after "Real People,"
Barbour works in Los Angeles writing
and producing. He took time out from
his schedule recently to discuss his
career, the state of television, and how
to break into the business.
Do you mind talking about "Real
People"? That's what most people
know you best for.
(Pauses) I'll try to be objective about
this. I think personally that "Real
People" was probably one of the best
shows in television. And when we were
doing the show I always thought it was
an entertaining public service, in that
it was devoid of celebrities, it was devoid
of pretention. I always had the feeling
that anybody looking at the show would
feel that their lives had some kind of
value, that they didn't have to grow up
and be Barbara Streisand or Ronald
Reagan.
How did you feel during its heyday
about all the copycat shows on the
other networks. The "That's In
credibles" and all the other copycat
shows.
I sued ABC over "That's Incredible."
We had done a pilot at ABC, and I had
created the show not only because there
were stories I wished to tell but I wanted
to be one of the hosts. And I hired
Richard Pryor. At that time, 1978, Rich
ard Pryor was under indictment by the
Federal Goverment for income tax eva
sion, and Lou Erlich, who was in charge
of evening programming at ABC said
"I don't want that bum on my network,"
so we never continued with ABC. And
the fellow with whom I was developing
the show, Danny Arnold, who had co
created Barney Miller, he didn't think
it would work either with Richie or with
me, so we parted company.
In American television there are very
few typewriters but there are a lot of
xerox machines; everybody was copying
"Real People". I sued ABC and they
settled out of court, because they had
my project for a year.
But their show stayed on.
Yeah, it stayed on. And it's coming
back. THAT'S incredible.
Do you think this is more of an
atmosphere, a few years later, for
shows of that type?
I never thought much about the au
dience, quite honestly. I only told the
stories I would be entertained by or
interested in. Fortunately, they had the
same kinds of tastes and interests as I
did so they responded.
The difference in the philosophies of
the shows was that I told the stories
the way I perceived them, and I allowed
the people to explain their own lives.
"That's Incredible" and all those other
shows don't explain, they exploit. You
have a feeling that they're using those
people rather than giving us some in
sights into them. I find 'that highly of
fensive.
That's Incredible was snuff television.
There were probably three or four
people killed on that show. There were
people who were maimed. I remember
one incident, they were showing some
guy running through a tunnel of fire.
The guy just wanted to be on television;
they didn't care.
It was the worst kind of television.
It was like Chuck Barris' Gong Show
meets "Real People." It's like an acci

dent on the freeway, you don't want to
look sometimes but you can't take your
eyes off of it, and then you're angry
because you looked at it. It had a very
negative impact. "Real People" had an
extremely positive impact.
Before "Real People" you worked as
a writer?
I did some "Get Smarts" and some
"Gomer Pyles". Do you remember the
old Get Smart show with Don Adams?
The thing is when you're writing those
things you find yourself going around
all day talking like that. 11mitating Max
well Smart] "All right men, where do
we go for dinner?" You feel like an
idiot. Then when you're doing Gomer
Pyle, you know [imitating Gomer Pyle]
"Aw, golly shucks, gee whiz," and you
find yourself sitting down at a type
writer like that.

John Barbour on:
That's Incredible' — It's
coming back. THAT'S in
credible.'
How he reviews movies
— If my ass moves, it's
boring.'

So you wanted to create something
more than just entertainment?
I had always wanted to produce a
television show to combine both enter
tainment and information. For some
reason or other in broadcasting there's
this artificial moat that supposedly
separates news from entertainment. I
mean, ABC has filled in that moat now
[snickers] so you can't tell where news
begins and entertainment ends.
Referring specifically t0...?
The Eyewitness News and nearly
everything that ABC does.
20/20?
Oh yeah, I mean, it's a whorehouse
network, and it always has been. You
know the first two hosts of 20/20 were

Australians, and when I was trying to
sell "Real People" to ABC they were
talking about how they weren't quite
sure who they'd have host the show,
and they had these two Australians.
And I said, you can't have Australians
hosting an American news show. And
they said why not, and I said they hate
Mike Wallace already, and he's an Amer
ican for God's sake. How are they goirjg
to respond to foreigners telling tts
what's wrong with the country.
And the general state of American
television now?
I'm dismayed by American television.
It's not show business anymore — when
I got in it was show business, now it's
business show. Business comes befofre
the show, sadly.
What are some of the shows that
you watch? Do you watch television
now?
I watch "Nova" whenever I can.. I
watch a lot of Bill Moyers' stuff. The
two luckiest people in television right
now are probably Bill Moyers, becaufee
he makes a fairly good living for think
ing, and the other luckiest person is
Alan Thicke, who makes an even better
living for not thinking.
You watch "Growing Pains"?
"Growing Pains"? Does anybody? It's
ghastly. There's not one commercial
television show I watch. I watch the
news because I have to watch the news.
Has th<> declinc of the television in
dustry been caused by the movie in
dustry?
No, there are a lot of very talented
people working in television, but they're
working primarily for the money. The
amounts of money that can be made in
television are absolutely unbelievable.
Is there more fame in movies?
When you think of American movies,
only three writers in the history of
movies have ever gotten their name
above the title: Neil Simon, Paddy
Chayefsky, and William Shakespeare.
And the reason for that is movies were
made in the silents, so writers weren't
needed. They were called "idea men "
