# Group sets spark for racism dialogue
## 
### Lara Filson 
Considering the racial tension that
has afflicted Stanford this year, the
commitment by one new student group
to foster discussions about race seems
opportune.
"SSpARC" is the group's name, short
for Students Speaking About Race and
Culture, and its mission is to ignite
discussions in campus residences about
race and culture, says senior Susan
Buseck, a member of the group.
The group, which has precursors in
another, similar student group, has held
a handful of formal and informal meet
ings so far this year. It has not gone
into dormitories yet, but has met with
Greek groups and one co-op and plans
more meetings in the winter and spring.
Says sophomore Kevin Richardson,
another member: "We don't go into a
discussion with all the answers, we just
want to make it easier for students to
speak out on how they feel."
Buseck says SSpARC's role is to
counter and perhaps defuse the rhetoric

swirling around racism at Stanford.
"While I've been at Stanford a lot of
issues have come and gone, but racism
is still around," she says. "We want to
help students discuss the issues in other
terms."
SSpARC has come at a fortuitous time
for the University. Alice Supton, an as
sociate dean for Residential Education,
enthusiastically agrees that a group of
students trained in promoting discus
sions aids Res Ed and its "commitment
to constructive discussion of differ
ences."
"Students are inclined to respond dif
ferently with other students leading the
discussion," Supton says, "than if there
are mandatory programs scheduled."
Either a racial incident in a residence
or the students' own initiative could
lead SSpARC to come in for a discus
sion, according to Richardson.
Jim Cadena, a former associate dean
at Stanford who is now at Mills College,
helped start up a similar group last year
called Stanford Students on Class, Cul
ture and Race (SSOCCAR). That effort

coalesced after the "You Can Make a
Difference" last year, which focused on
institutional racism, according to one
member.
"There was a small group who was
involved in the conference who wanted
to continue working on educating stu
dents in these matters," said senior
Peter Olson, a member of SSOCCAR
and of SSpARC. Cadena's SSOCCAR
was the genesis of Supton's SSpARC.
Daniel Ramirez, an aide for Res Ed
and adviser to SSpARC, said, "Jim
didn't form this group as a response to
any incident but with a long term vision
in mind."
In the fall, Supton contacted the net
work of SSOCCAR students in hopes of
reviving a similar organization, accord
ing to Ramirez. A group of around 12
students — about half minorities —
came together, said member Olson.
SSpARC spent most of its time in the
fall training and now is ready to do
more discussions and outreach, mem
bers say.
