## Lichti stars in comeback win 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
SEATTLE - What should be
Todd Lichti's nickname? What
moniker could possibly capture
what a savior he has become to
Stanford basketball?

Men's Basketball
Cardinal 71, Huskies 69

Seven days after he personally
guided Stanford to a second-half
rally and win over No. 8 Arizona,
the senior guard did the same
thing last night in even more dra
matic fashion.
Lichti, in traffic, rebounded a
miss by Andrew Vlahov, and as
time ran out, put in a short bank
shot to give Stanford a 71-69 mini
miracle win over the lowly
regarded Washington Huskies.
Stanford, ranked 21st in the na
tion, is now 11-3 overall and 4-1
in the Pacific 10 Conference, and
is second in the league. Washing
ton falls to 4-8, 1-3.
Before 4,025 stunned (though
they shouldn't have been) fans at
Hec Edmundson Pavilion, Lichti
grabbed the rebound after it
tipped off teammate Eric Reveno's
hands and scored the last of his
21 second-half points. Lichti had
28 points overall.
Now, "Todd the God" isn't a
bad nickname — it rhymes and
all. But for Lichti, somehow it

seems mundane.
"He (Lichti) pretty much took
over the game down the stretch,
both offensively and defensively,"
Washington Coach Andy Russo
said.
In fact, according to Russo,
Lichti was a hero even when he
was 30 feet from the action. With
Stanford down 67-66, the Huskies
were so worried about him scoring
that they left Vlahov (who
finished with 5 points) wide open
for a 3-pointer with 29 seconds
left in the game, which gave Stan
ford the lead.
"Lichti was probably responsi
ble for all the good that happened
to them and all the bad that hap
pened to us," Russo said.
But Vlahov fouled Washington's
Dion Brown with seven seconds
left. Brown hit both free throws
in the clutch to tie the score. But
then Magic/Air Todd/Dr. T rose
to the occasion — again.
"It's typical of what Todd's
done his whole career," Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said.
Stanford made two separate
runs in the second half, hacking
away at leads of 14 and nine,
before finally pulling to within
63-60.
Jeff Sanor then went backdoor
and laid one in uncontested, illus
trating the surprising vul
nerability of Stanford inside last
night. Washington led by five with
2:27 left.
"The major thing was we
couldn't defend," Montgomery

said. "We were giving up too many
easy shots. Washington's quick
ness definitely hurt us."
But after a loose-ball foul by
Reveno, Mike Hayward missed a
one-and-one attempt. Lichti hit a
jumper from the corner, and soon
after a turnover, drove for a layup
to cut it to 65-64.
On a missed shot by Washing
ton, Sanor pushed off Terry
Taylor (13 points, 6 assists) going
for the rebound. With 1:18 left,
Taylor made both free throws to
give Stanford its first lead since
the 10:30 mark in the first half,
66-65.
Husky Mark West's layup with
44 ticks left gave Washington the
lead until Vlahov swished his
wide-open 3-pointer.
Stanford fell behind by as much
as 44-30 when Eldridge Recasner
(23 points), a proven Cardinal kil
ler, hit his fifth 3-pointer of the
game at the 18-minute mark of
the second half.
But then Lichti keyed an 18-6
run, bringing the Cardinal back.
Trailing 46-32, Lichti hit a pull
up 14-foot jumper. He then took
the ball on a steal from Vlahov
and made a long drive similar to
the one that last week put the
Cardinal ahead of Arizona to stay.
This didn't put the team in the
lead, but it did get Stanford mov
ing.
After two Sanor free throws,
Lichti hit a 3-pointer while closely
guarded to cut it to 48-39.
Lichti made two more great de

fensive plays, and he and three
other teammates had baskets in
reducing the lead to 50-48 with
13:45 left.
Things hadn't looked this good
for Stanford since the first half,
when Washington forward
Hayward got into early trouble.
Inside the first five minutes,
he picked up back-to-back fouls
on each end of the court within
17 seconds of each other. Then
just over a minute later, he fouled
Reveno as Reveno swished a jump
hook. The three-point play gave
Stanford a 12-10 lead with 14:46
left.
But Washington missed
Hayward about as much as the
Three Little Pigs missed the Wolf.
With Stanford on top 16-12 and
12:07 left, the Huskies blitzed the
Cardinal with a 14-0 run over the
next 4:10. Two 3-pointers by
Recasner sandwiched the run, but
the surge was led mostly by for
ward Dion Brown.
First, Recasner hit his third 3-
point shot of the half to cut the
deficit to one. After a Reveno foul,
Brown, who had been benched the
previous four games, fed Husky
center West for a layin with 10:36
left to give the Washington the
lead it would keep for the rest of
the half.
Brown then swatted a Lichti
jumper. Sanor drove the baseline
for a lavup, drew a foul from
Bryan McSweeney, and made the

with two seconds remaining to give the Cardinal a 71-69 win at
Washington last night.
