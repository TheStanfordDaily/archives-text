# Men's gymnastics at Spartan Invite
## 
### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
This year's Stanford men's
gymnastics team promises to
rank among the nation's best
despite the loss of three elite
performers to graduation.
There are two new faces in
the Cardinal press guide this
season: freshman Tim Ryan,
currently ranked fifth among
U.S. gymnasts, and redshirt
sophomore David Neithardt.
The across-the-board improve
ment of Stanford's returning
veterans, along with the
greatly expanded role of soph
omore Tim Wang, are the other
major components of the Car
dinal's effort to do more than
just fill the vacancies left by
Randy Besosa, Mike Matzek,
and Chuck Gerardo.
Tonight and tomorrow at
San Jose State, Stanford will
be one of four teams competing
at the Spartan Invitational, an
annual meet which is essen
tially a pre-season test which
will allow Cardinal Coach
Sadao Hamada to gauge his
team's progress and pinpoint
areas that need improvement
in preparation for the more im
portant meets taking place vir
tually nonstop from dual meets
in February to the U.S. Cham
pionships in July. Also per
forming this weekend will be
the host Spartans, California,
and Fullerton State.
"The basic approach to this
meet is just to get the guys in
shape," Hamada said. "It's a

starting point. . . .After this
meet, I will see what they can
do."
Ryan's fifth-place finish at
the U.S. Championships in De
cember was an unpleasant
surprise for the rest of the col
legiate gymnastics world. Al
though he came to Stanford as
one of the nation's top three
recruits, such a strong per
formance at a high-pressure
national meet indicates that
the difficulty of his adjustment
to the college level will be
negligible.
Junior Conrad Voorsanger,
always among the elite of his
class, is expected to find his
place among the elite, no mat
ter what their age, this season.
Voorsanger, who performs a
high bar maneuver — the
vaunted "Voorhanger" — done
by no other U.S. gymnast and
few other gymnasts anywhere
else, is currently ranked ninth
in the nation.
The true key to this year's
Cardinal, though, may be the
addition of Tong Fei as an as
sistant coach. Fei, a former
world champion on two events
and a member of the 1984 Chi
nese Olympic team, has, ac
cording to Wang, introduced
new strategy and is pushing
the gymnasts towards a higher
level of execution.
Wang was a high bar special
ist last year and now will have
a great deal more responsibility
as an all-around performer. His
situation is typical: Now that last
year's leaders are no longer
around to depend on, each Cardi
nal gymnast has a more vital role.
"We all have the potential,"
Wang said. "We just have to get

it together."
Injuries, as always with gym
nastics, are hampering the prog
ress to one degree or another of
many team members. Scott Schaf
fer suffered Stanford's only
serious injury when he tore liga
ments in his foot recently. He will
be sidelined for at least two weeks,
and his floor routine, one of the
team's strongest, may be affected
even more drastically.
