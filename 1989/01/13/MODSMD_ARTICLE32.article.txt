# Reserve Patrick waits for his shot
## 
### Elaine Riggs Staff writer 
Sophomore John Patrick's self-confessed sports
fanaticism dates back to the days when he was a
toddler dreaming of being a big 6-4 guy someday.
"I was one of those little kids that at age four
would be running around the house pretending it
was the Lakers versus the Celtics and I was going
in for the final shot," Patrick remembers.
Patrick kept basketball his first priority when he
chose DeMatha High School, known for its fiercely
competitive basketball program led by infamous
coach Morgan Wootten.
Patrick spent long hours there on the bench watch
ing teammates like Danny Ferry, now of Duke's
Blue Devils, star on the court. Patrick felt frustrat
ed.
"It's been the same thing here," Patrick com
ments. "But I feel I have a future here."
Patrick's game time soared exponentially when
he repeated his junior year at nearby Sidwell Friends
High School and went on in his senior year to
flourish under coach Eddie Saah.
"I came into my own," Patrick remembers. "I
began to love basketball again."
The second-time-around junior quickly began to
unleash some of his pent-up energy on the court,
setting single-game school records with most points
(29-twice), most field goals (13), and most assists
(13).
After taking the title of an All-Star in the top
notch Sidwell Friends summer league, Patrick re
turned to reclaim his MVP status for his second
and final year at Sidwell. The senior led the league
with 20.1 ppg, and the phone began ringing with
calls from recruiters.
Patrick smiles. Stanford was his first choice.
Things haven't been so easy since he came here,
though. As a reserve freshman guard last year,
Patrick played in a total of seven games.
This is the kind of situation that really brings
out Patrick's optimism. He's a team player who is
quick to tell you that he also believes in his own
abilities.
"I knew 1 wouldn't come here and light up the
scoreboard right away," he says. "Stanford meant
more of a challenge for me. But I knew I could
play well in the Pac-10."
