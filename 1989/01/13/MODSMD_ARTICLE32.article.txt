# Reserve Patrick waits for his shot
## 
### Elaine Riggs Staff writer 
Sophomore John Patrick's self-confessed sports
fanaticism dates back to the days when he was a
toddler dreaming of being a big 6-4 guy someday.
"I was one of those little kids that at age four
would be running around the house pretending it
was the Lakers versus the Celtics and I was going
in for the final shot," Patrick remembers.
Patrick kept basketball his first priority when he
chose DeMatha High School, known for its fiercely
competitive basketball program led by infamous
coach Morgan Wootten.
Patrick spent long hours there on the bench watch
ing teammates like Danny Ferry, now of Duke's
Blue Devils, star on the court. Patrick felt frustrat
ed.
"It's been the same thing here," Patrick com
ments. "But I feel I have a future here."
Patrick's game time soared exponentially when
he repeated his junior year at nearby Sidwell Friends
High School and went on in his senior year to
flourish under coach Eddie Saah.
"I came into my own," Patrick remembers. "I
began to love basketball again."
The second-time-around junior quickly began to
unleash some of his pent-up energy on the court,
setting single-game school records with most points
(29-twice), most field goals (13), and most assists
(13).
After taking the title of an All-Star in the top
notch Sidwell Friends summer league, Patrick re
turned to reclaim his MVP status for his second
and final year at Sidwell. The senior led the league
with 20.1 ppg, and the phone began ringing with
calls from recruiters.
Patrick smiles. Stanford was his first choice.
Things haven't been so easy since he came here,
though. As a reserve freshman guard last year,
Patrick played in a total of seven games.
This is the kind of situation that really brings
out Patrick's optimism. He's a team player who is
quick to tell you that he also believes in his own
abilities.
"I knew 1 wouldn't come here and light up the
scoreboard right away," he says. "Stanford meant
more of a challenge for me. But I knew I could
play well in the Pac-10."

Sophomore John Patrick is confident he'll be able to handle his duties next season,
when he will be the most experienced returning Stanford guard.
He pauses, reflecting on his de
cision to come here.
"When I signed here, this
wasn't the best basketball school
in the country. Now, I think we
could beat any team. But that's
the way I am, I always think
everything's going to work out."
Patrick came to the Cardinal
team determined to stand out.
The 6-4 freshman soon earned the
nickname "Pull" because he
would invariably shoot the ball
every time he got it, according to
Cardinal assistant manager
Jamaal Brown.
"John was not bashful about
shooting the ball. Almost every
time he got the ball, he'd shoot
it. So we called him John Pull
Patrick," Brown says.

"He's kind of a scorer," agrees
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery.
Patrick works hard in practice
— and hears a lot of criticism
from the coach.
"He's had to endure a lot of
stuff from the coach and he
handles it well," says teammate
Andrew Vlahov.
"I get on him a little bit," Mont
gomery acknowledges.
Patrick's teammates praise his
easygoing style, yet all point to it
as the reason Patrick hears "a
lot" of criticism from Mont
gomery.
When Patrick does make mis
takes on the court, he keeps "a
real ice-cool image," according to
Vlahov.
"At times it seems like he's
lackadaisical on the court because
he has a lot of confidence in him
self, and so when he makes a mis
take he tends to shake it off, and

it doesn't seem to bother him —
which is fine if he doesn't make
the same mistake again," says
teammate Todd Lichti.
Montgomery leans back on the
bleachers at Maples Pavilion and
watches the team practice. He's
said this many times before.
"The thing we've been on John
for ever since he came here is his
concentration," Montgomery says.
Montgomery and the team
members agree that Patrick has
the talent to lead the team next
year, when he will be the only
returning guard who has seen
playing time.
"He's a good shooter. He
handles the ball well," Mont
gomery says.
"He's real crafty with his
moves. He's got a nice jump shot,"
Lichti says. "If he improves
steadily over the next two years
he could be one of the top guards

'I always think
everything's going
to work out.'
— John Patrick

in the league. The things that will
make the difference are his con
centration and how badly he wants
it."
Patrick knows he has a future
in Maples Pavilion. His friendly,
easygoing attitude turns serious
when he talks about his hopes for
next year.
"I think I could be a good point
guard and lead the team," Patrick
says."I think I can get the most
out of people on the team."
He smiles and shakes his head.
"But that sounds arrogant. I just
have fun."

"But that sounds arrogant. I just
have fun."
Sophomore John Patrick's self-confessed sports
fanaticism dates back to the days when he was a
toddler dreaming of being a big 6-4 guy someday.
"I was one of those little kids that at age four
would be running around the house pretending it
was the Lakers versus the Celtics and I was going
in for the final shot," Patrick remembers.
Patrick kept basketball his first priority when he
chose DeMatha High School, known for its fiercely
competitive basketball program led by infamous
coach Morgan Wootten.
Patrick spent long hours there on the bench watch
ing teammates like Danny Ferry, now of Duke's
Blue Devils, star on the court. Patrick felt frustrat
ed.
"It's been the same thing here," Patrick com
ments. "But I feel I have a future here."
Patrick's game time soared exponentially when
he repeated his junior year at nearby Sidwell Friends
High School and went on in his senior year to
flourish under coach Eddie Saah.
"I came into my own," Patrick remembers. "I
began to love basketball again."
The second-time-around junior quickly began to
unleash some of his pent-up energy on the court,
setting single-game school records with most points
(29-twice), most field goals (13), and most assists
(13).
After taking the title of an All-Star in the top
notch Sidwell Friends summer league, Patrick re
turned to reclaim his MVP status for his second
and final year at Sidwell. The senior led the league
with 20.1 ppg, and the phone began ringing with
calls from recruiters.
Patrick smiles. Stanford was his first choice.
Things haven't been so easy since he came here,
though. As a reserve freshman guard last year,
Patrick played in a total of seven games.
This is the kind of situation that really brings
out Patrick's optimism. He's a team player who is
quick to tell you that he also believes in his own
abilities.
"I knew 1 wouldn't come here and light up the
scoreboard right away," he says. "Stanford meant
more of a challenge for me. But I knew I could
play well in the Pac-10."

Sophomore John Patrick is confident he'll be able to handle his duties next season,
when he will be the most experienced returning Stanford guard.
He pauses, reflecting on his de
cision to come here.
"When I signed here, this
wasn't the best basketball school
in the country. Now, I think we
could beat any team. But that's
the way I am, I always think
everything's going to work out."
Patrick came to the Cardinal
team determined to stand out.
The 6-4 freshman soon earned the
nickname "Pull" because he
would invariably shoot the ball
every time he got it, according to
Cardinal assistant manager
Jamaal Brown.
"John was not bashful about
shooting the ball. Almost every
time he got the ball, he'd shoot
it. So we called him John Pull
Patrick," Brown says.

"He's kind of a scorer," agrees
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery.
Patrick works hard in practice
— and hears a lot of criticism
from the coach.
"He's had to endure a lot of
stuff from the coach and he
handles it well," says teammate
Andrew Vlahov.
"I get on him a little bit," Mont
gomery acknowledges.
Patrick's teammates praise his
easygoing style, yet all point to it
as the reason Patrick hears "a
lot" of criticism from Mont
gomery.
When Patrick does make mis
takes on the court, he keeps "a
real ice-cool image," according to
Vlahov.
"At times it seems like he's
lackadaisical on the court because
he has a lot of confidence in him
self, and so when he makes a mis
take he tends to shake it off, and

it doesn't seem to bother him —
which is fine if he doesn't make
the same mistake again," says
teammate Todd Lichti.
Montgomery leans back on the
bleachers at Maples Pavilion and
watches the team practice. He's
said this many times before.
"The thing we've been on John
for ever since he came here is his
concentration," Montgomery says.
Montgomery and the team
members agree that Patrick has
the talent to lead the team next
year, when he will be the only
returning guard who has seen
playing time.
"He's a good shooter. He
handles the ball well," Mont
gomery says.
"He's real crafty with his
moves. He's got a nice jump shot,"
Lichti says. "If he improves
steadily over the next two years
he could be one of the top guards

'I always think
everything's going
to work out.'
— John Patrick

in the league. The things that will
make the difference are his con
centration and how badly he wants
it."
Patrick knows he has a future
in Maples Pavilion. His friendly,
easygoing attitude turns serious
when he talks about his hopes for
next year.
"I think I could be a good point
guard and lead the team," Patrick
says."I think I can get the most
out of people on the team."
He smiles and shakes his head.
