# Men's swimming gets break from training at Cal Invitational
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
This weekend's California Invi
tational is a welcome break for
the men's swimming team. Not
only is the meet a chance to
prepare for the much-heralded
Michigan showdown next week,
but will also give the squad a
breather.
While fellow students were re
laxing at home, the nation's
second-ranked team was here on
the Farm conducting two-a-day
practices during winter break.
Most Cardinal members would be
slow to label the grueling training
camp a vacation, but will at least
feel the sacrificed free time was
worth it if the 12-day session pays
off with fast times this weekend
to begin the swim back to the
national championship.
Both swimmers and coaches are
positive about the challenging
training period. "There were a lot
more positive workouts than is
customary, which should enhance
the season," Asst. Coach Ted
Knapp said. "And it really unified
the team, which is the key to
Christmas training."
"After seeing what we did dur
ing Christmas training we're

going to amaze some people," but
terflier Byron Burson said.
The squad hopes the amaze
ment begins tomorrow when it
takes on the Golden Bears, UC-
Davis, University of the Pacific,
Cbico State and various regional
club teams in the annual three
day meet. While the caliber of
competition, with the exception
of the California squad, is not
what Stanford will be facing the
remainder of the season, the first
competition of the winter will give
the squad its last shot at an
NCAA-type meet until the league
championships in March. From
here on meets will be dual, so the
invite will give the swimmers the
opportunity of swimming two
heats of each event — preliminar
ies and finals — as is customary
at national championships.
"It'll be a chance to swim fast
in the morning and faster at night
(or afternoon in this case) which
is the key to succeeding at the
NCAA level," Knapp said. "I'd like
the freshmen to let the nationals
picture grow in their minds."
The meet will also give the Car
dinal the opportunity to see how
far it has come in conditioning,
as the swimmers have not yet had
a break from training. Beginning

with this meet Stanford will ease
out of its distance training and
begin to concentrate on speed.
"We're really tired, so if we swim
well now we'll be pretty well off
for the coming season," top
breaststroking recruit .Jeff
Deßuiter said.

Both swimmers and
coaches are positive
about the challenging
training period.

"I'd like to get a fast swim out
of it if possible," back and fly
specialist Jay Mortenson said. "It
will not be ideal conditions be
cause Berkeley is usually cold and
windy but I think we'll have a
few surprises."
According to Knapp, the meet
will also give the coaching staff
an opportunity to select the lineup
before the start of the dual com
petitions and give him and Coach
Skip Kenney an idea of where in
dividuals are time-wise prior to
the showdown against highly
rated Michigan next Friday
