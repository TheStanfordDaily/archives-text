# Women's hoops in battle for first

### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Last year at Maples Pavilion,
Stanford guard Emily Wagner
taught the Washington women's
basketball team a valuable lesson:
Expect the unexpected. Out for
three years due to a knee iryury,
Wagner played like an old pro and
led the Cardinal past the Huskies
to claim the top spot in the Pacific
10 Conference.
Though Washington ultimately
took the title, they will never for
get Wagner's inspirational explo
sion. With the same stakes on the
line Saturday night, when the
Huskies visit No. 7 Stanford for
a Pac-10 showdown at 7:30, Wash
ington will surely overlook no one
on the talented Cardinal bench.
It is hard to lay blame on the
Husky coaches for the oversight.
After all, Wagner by her own ad
mission hadn't been a big factor
in the other Cardinal wins, miss
ing her first several seasons and

until the Washington contest
relegated to the waning seconds
of sealed games.
Only Wagner was not surprised
with her nine-point, four-rebound
and four-steal performance.
"I think 1 made gradual prog
ress throughout the year both
mentally and physically, and I fi
nally got to go in the game when
it counted, instead of the tail end,"
Wagner said. "1 just concentrated
on running the offense, playing
good defense and keeping things
organized."
"Emily played really smart, put
the ball on the floor well and did
a great job against their pressure
defense," Stanford Coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "I think she was
a real big factor in our win against
iheip. It's in the back of my mind
that she did so well, so based on
what the situation is I won't
hesitate to put her in."
The Huskies are probably not
pleased with the prospect, but the
squad has far bigger worries. Star
center Karen Deden, who was
averaging 10 points and 7.7
rebounds per game, went down
over winter break with a severe

stress fracture and will not suit
up this weekend.
The Cardinal can hardly rest
easy, however. With a talented
roster featuring AU-Pac-10 for
ward Yvette Cole and and guard
Jacki Myers, Washington is still

the team to beat in the Pac-10
even with Deden out of action.
"I'm sure that they're stronger
with her, but 1 know they're
strong without her," VanDerveer
said. "They will definitely miss
Deden, but they're not a sluggish

team without her."
Washington State, Stanford's
opponent Friday night at Maples,
is another tough team. Ranked
fourth in the league, the Cougars
are good enough to leave the Farm
with a win.
