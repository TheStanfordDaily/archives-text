Stanford Coach Chris Horpel

said, "We won it the past two
years, but it is going to be
tough this year with all the
injuries. A lot of guys will
wrestle who normally don't get
the opportunity. We should be
in contention, however, and
hopefully the guys will turn in
some good performances. We'll
just have to see what happens."
Horpel lamented over the
team's recent plague of inju
ries. James Dinette (142 lbs J,
Michael Saran (158 lbs.), and
