## 
### Doug Boeschen Staff writer 
Hey, Stanford sports fans! Are
you depressed about staying on
campus for the long weekend with
nothing to do? Come to Roble gym
for a weekend of fun with the
Cardinal fencers. Swords will be
flying and the action should be
wild and entertaining as the Stan
ford fencing teams will host op
ponents such as Fullerton State,
Long Beach State, and UC-Santa
Cruz.
After their impressive showing
during the recent trip to the East
Coast, the Cardinal duelists are
back home and eager to continue
their success. The competition
will begin at 2 this afternoon and
will continue throughout the eve
ning.
On Saturday and Sunday Stan
ford will host the first Stanford
Collegiate Open. This individual
tournament is the only one of its
kind on the West Coast and will
combine experienced varsity
members with fencers from phys
ical education classes. The Stan
ford coaches are expecting over
100 fencers to participate. The ac
tion will begin at 8 a.m. and
should last until at least 4 p.m.
on both days.
Men's coach Zoran Tulum says
the team is looking to improve
their 11-1 record with victories
over the Cal State schools on Fri
day. The match will be tough,
however, because the team will
be without freshmen stars Nick

Bravin and Leonard D'Amico. The
two are away at circuit tourna
ments in an effort to secure their
positions on the United States Na
tional Team. Without them the
men's team will be led by the
experience of seniors Mike
Cramer, Dave Russ, Steve
Schmidt, Lee Tankersley, and

junior Duncan Bell.
The Cardinal women's team is
also enjoying a very successful
season and is "looking forward to
victory" this weekend, according
to Coach Sherry Posthumus.
They are aiming for their sixth
straight win at the NCAA Western
Regionals and a successful tour

nament this weekend will be a
good step in that direction. They
will be led by Elisabeth Spilman,
Olivia Judson, Tracy Schmidt,
and Grace Chang. The team will
be without Juliet Johnson because
of injured ligaments in her knee
as a result of a slip during the
East Coast trip.
