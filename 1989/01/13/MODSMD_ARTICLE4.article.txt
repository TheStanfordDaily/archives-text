Political Science Prof. Condoleezza Rice said yes
terday that she had not been offered a choice of
two governmental positions under Bush.

According to her secretary Arly Ellis, Rice denied
reports made Wednesday by anonymous sources
that she was given her pick between becoming dep
uty director of policy planning at the State Depart
ment or the Soviet specialist at the National Security
Council.
"I have not been officially offered any position
in the Bush administration at this time," Rice said
in her statement from Jamaica, where she is at
tending a conference. "I am currently exploring a
couple of possibilities."
Rice did not elaborate on those options.
"If I am officially offered a position and should
decide to accept, Stanford will be the first to know,"
Rice added.
Speculation was heightened about the appoint
ments because Rice canceled the political science
seminar she was scheduled to teach this quarter.


If I decide to accept a
position, Stanford will
be the first to know.
â€” Condoleezza Rice
