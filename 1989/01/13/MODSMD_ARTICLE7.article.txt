# Curtain to come down on 'tragedies'
## Low usage leads to phase-out of computer system 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
Reflecting a nationwide trend in upgrad
ing computer software and a realization of
the diminished use of some systems, the
University's computer experts are phasing
out the mainframe system commonly
known as the "tragedies" — Lear, Hamlet
and Macßeth.
The tragedies, known to experts as the
TOPS-20 operating systems, are the
software "brain" that allows computer
users to retrieve and execute programs like
Pascal computer language compilers and
BASIC interpreters. The tragedies are often
used in introductory computer science
classes, research and electronic mail.
Though the tragedies will still exist in
the year 2000, said Richard Alderson, the
TOPS-20 system manager, their use will
be greatly diminished. He expects the Uni
versity to remove the Lear system by next
year and Hamlet one to three years later.
Macßeth will remain indefinitely, he said.
"This represents a change in emphasis
on the way academic computing ought to
go," Alderson said.
The move began last August, when the
Othello system was shut down after experts
at the Academic Information Center ob
served a 30-percent decline in the usage in
the TOPS-20 system, and so reduced the
number of operating systems from four to
three.
In addition, because the operating sys
tems are contained in large metal hulks,
removing TOPS-20 mainframes would free
up needed space in the crowded room that
contains the University's other
mainframes, according to Lance Nakata,
an academic computing specialist.
Nakata said the University will empha
size the American Telegraph and Tele
phone's less expensive, more common
UNIX operating system. Though less

"friendly" than TOPS-20, Nakata said
UNIX is much more flexible and powerful.
Students in upper level computer science
classes already use UNIX in the "Portia"
system and AIR uses it for administrative
uses in the "Jessica" system. UNIX is also
widely used in universities, primarily by
engineering departments, nationwide.
Nakata said the University also hopes to
increase its stock of work stations, or com
puter systems with more power than single
personal computers and less overhead than
mainframes.
The use of work stations, such as Moun
tain View-based Sun Microsystems' and
Digital Equipment Corp.'s, "is approaching
like an oncoming train," Alderson said.
Introductory computer science classes
will still use Apple Macintosh ll's, Alderson
said, because students feel these machines
offer the most beneficial learning environ
ment. He said the popularity of the Mac
intoshes is not a cause for phasing out the
tragedies.
Though there are currently 8,000 active
user accounts on the tragedies, the class
room use of the TOPS-20 is steadily declin
ing, Alderson said. No specific figures are
available on the declining use, he said.
For some, the tragedies are only useful
now for undertakings less rigorous than
programming. Electronic mail, for instance,
is a popular use for the tragedies.
