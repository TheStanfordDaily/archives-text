# New law will pull license for possession of alcohol
## 
### Nathanael Cousins Staff writer 
A new California law effective Jan. 1
slaps a one-year driver's license suspension
on minors under 21 found in possession
of alcohol or drugs.
The law gives more bite to the penalty
for illegal possession of alcohol or drugs
and breaks new ground by linking posses
sion to a juvenile's privilege to drive, said
.-Mice Huffaker, a press representative for
the California Highway Patrol.
Huffaker said she hoped the new law
would have a big impact on college cam
puses, but acknowledged, "We can't speak
for anyone else. We will enforce the law
but we have no jurisdiction on most cam
puses."
Stanford Police Chief Marv Herrington
downplayed the law's significance, saying
it is only a penalty and "doesn't make any
difference to us. In California driving is a
privilege and not a right. That privilege
can be taken away."
"That's ludicrous," said one outraged
student, Tovon freshman Roman

Roszkewycz. "You shouldn't be charged for
a driving offense if you've made a drinking
offense. I understand the intent, but legally
that's a non sequitir."
The new penal code applies to anyone
13 to 21 years of age. If someone under
age 16 is convicted of possession, he or
she will be denied a license until age 17.
According to Huffaker, the new law is
designed to deter juvenile drug and alcohol
use and combat drunk driving.
"It won't influence my drinking habits,"
said Rinconada freshman Mike Swanson.
"I don't think the police will enforce the
new law any differently. They will still say
'pop-em and dump-em' if they catch a
minor with alcohol. It won't affect my life,
but that is a harsh penalty."
"Drunk driving is a leading cause of
death for teenagers," said Huffaker. "The
new law is a meaningful way to make
people think about the consequences of
drinking and then driving. It takes a re
sponsible person to drive a car. Minors who
drink are not illustrating this responsibil
ity."
