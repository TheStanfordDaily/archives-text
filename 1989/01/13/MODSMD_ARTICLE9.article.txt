# Students take advantage of advice, books
## 
### Laura Jacobson Senior staff writer 
White Plaza has hummed at lunch
time this week, as students have traded
more than $1,000 in textbooks on the
open market at the ASSU's Beat the
Bookstore booth.
While course-shoppers consulted up
perclass students at the ASSU's Course
Consulting service, ASSU sales reps sold
supplies and traded textbooks at prices
below those of the Bookstore. As of yes
terday, the ASSU had done $1,280
worth of trading, with book prices rang
ing from $2 to $30.
The Bookstore offered $3 for a psy
chology book to one student who turned
around and sold it for $20 at the book
fair, Council of Presidents member
Stacey said.
In addition to the book trading, last
quarter the ASSU bought $3,000 worth
of used introductory textbooks from stu
dents for popular courses such as cal
culus and chemistry. Those have gar
nered $1,400 this week,
The Bookstore buys students' used
textbooks at half the wholesale price of
a new book and sells them at 75 percent
of the new value, Bookstore Operation
Manager Rose Sims said last week.
Sims has objected to the opinions of
the ASSU officers, who charge that the
Bookstore is misleading when it says it
is non-profit, but said she does not con
sider the ASSU initiative a threat.
Bookstore General Manager Eldon

Speed was unavailable for comment last
night.
The only shortcoming, Leyton said,
was that students "wished for a bigger
selection of books and school supplies."
Next quarter the ASSU will expand
its book trading and supplies selling It
also hopes to set up a permanent books
and supplies store.
While some students bargained for
books, others consulted the 15 or so
upperclass students who devoted their
lunch hour and their expertise to the
new ASSU course consultant program.
"It was a good exchange of informa

tion," said senior Andrew Hope, a con
sultant in product design "I even got
advice on my courses."
Leyton estimated that between 200
and 300 students sought advice on
courses over the three-day period.
This week, in a market modeled after
the UC-Santa Cruz hook fair, students
brought their used books to White Plaza
and priced their own books below Rook
store prices for other students to buy.
Later they returned to either collect
their money, or take back their books,

Leyton explained
