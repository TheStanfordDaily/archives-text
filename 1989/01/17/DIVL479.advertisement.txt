THE GROCERY STORE OF TOMORROW
IS OPEN TODAY
(And That's Good For Everybody)
Imagine a supermarket where service and quality are realities
and not advertising slogans. A supermarket that sells
only the purest, freshest products available.
A supermarket that is clean, attractive, and fun to visit.
Well, now you can stop imagining.
Now you can shop at the new Whole Foods Market
at 774 Emerson Street in downtown Palo Alto
(site of the old Paddleford Oldsmobile dealership).
