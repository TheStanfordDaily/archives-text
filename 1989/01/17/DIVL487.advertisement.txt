44 I'm a development manager: primarily responsible for leading programmers to shipping
world-class products. It's great to walk into a store with software on the shelves and say
"Hey, I helped write that!" My first and continuous impression about working with Micro
soft was that it was like living in a dorm. Everyone had their stereos in their offices, people
were up by choice at all hours because of Hex time, and we'd get pizza delivered right to the
office. The environment is extremely casual — I still don't wear my shoes at work "

"I spent the summer working as a software development intern on an unreleased Microsoft
application. It was a chance to step out of the academic programming mentality and see how
things operate on the industrial side; you learn a lot about working with a team on very
large projects, a team that includes many people besides the software developers. You learn
what it is really like to do quality work that will be produced, marketed and used, instead
of just being graded and thrown away at the end of the term. The working environment is
supportive and open — everything from free soft drinks to setting your own working hours.
At Microsoft, it's easy to do your best."

"I knew from the time of my first interview that a summer internship at Microsoft was not
going to be the glorified coffee maker type of job. As soon as I arrived I was welcomed into
the Works 2.0 project like a permanent programmer, with all the responsibility and fun that
involves. During the summer, I have become the resident 'expert' on one of the Works mod
ules. I have answered questions about it from all corners of the Microsoft campus, as well as
adding visible features which will appear in the shipped product.
"I admit that the thought of going to Seattle, with its 'awful weather' and Mack of touch
with the rest of the world' had me worried. What I found was a dynamic young city, actively
supporting the lively arts, and growing quickly. With any outdoor activity supported within
an hour's drive and surprisingly mild summer weather, the Seattle area is a good place for a
young person starting on a career path "

"I supervise a group of seven programmers, and also am a programmer myself. Together we
design and produce Microsoft's Help and CBT software, both the runtimes which deliver the
instruction, and also the sophisticated editors and utilities used internally at Microsoft to
produce it. We actively research and apply techniques of data compression, inter-task com
munication, hypercard, multi-media and other software. We work on the Macintosh®, the
PC (Windows, DOS, and OS/2), as well as unannounced hardware."

"Program Management at Microsoft gives the summer intern the opportunity to shape new
products, explore markets, and decide on the important features to be included in a new

the Works 2.0 project like a permanent programmer, with all the responsibility and fun that
involves. During the summer, I have become the resident 'expert' on one of the Works mod
ules. I have answered questions about it from all corners of the Microsoft campus, as well as
adding visible features which will appear in the shipped product.
"I admit that the thought of going to Seattle, with its 'awful weather' and Mack of touch
with the rest of the world' had me worried. What I found was a dynamic young city, actively
supporting the lively arts, and growing quickly. With any outdoor activity supported within
an hour's drive and surprisingly mild summer weather, the Seattle area is a good place for a
young person starting on a career path "

"I supervise a group of seven programmers, and also am a programmer myself. Together we
design and produce Microsoft's Help and CBT software, both the runtimes which deliver the
instruction, and also the sophisticated editors and utilities used internally at Microsoft to
produce it. We actively research and apply techniques of data compression, inter-task com
munication, hypercard, multi-media and other software. We work on the Macintosh®, the
PC (Windows, DOS, and OS/2), as well as unannounced hardware."

"Program Management at Microsoft gives the summer intern the opportunity to shape new
products, explore markets, and decide on the important features to be included in a new
release. Microsoft puts you right in the middle of the development effort, so you have a
chance to see almost all aspects of what goes into a product. In my case, this involved help
ing out on the internationalization, marketing, and add-on support of Microsoft Works, in
addition to giving input on the next release of Flight Simulator for the Macintosh."

"The Seattle area is great. There is a special public event somewhere every weekend, and
there's always the beautiful scenery and the mountains."
