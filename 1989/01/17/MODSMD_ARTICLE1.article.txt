# Rally commemorates MLK
## 
### Diane Bisgeier Staff writer 
Local and international black
community leaders heralded the
legacy of the late Rev. Martin Lu
ther King in both song and speech
Friday as part of this week's
events commemorating the slain
civil rights leader.
The noon rally held in White
Plaza featured speeches by South
African anti-apartheid leader Rev.
Allan Boesak, Black Student Un
ion Secretary Louis Jackson and
former Dean of Student Affairs
Tom Massey.
Boesak, who founded South
Africa's United Democratic Front,
pointed to the youth in South
Africa as models for American
students: "It is young people who
have changed the course of events
in South Africa, and these stu
dents will change the face of South
Africa's future."
Boesak said thousands of stu
dents have been jailed, tear gassed
and shot at in their rejection of
apartheid because they have
"refused to accept the govern
ment's definition" of who they
are. "They will take responsibility
not only for their own lives but
for their country."
Adding that he is "astonished"

at the opportunities open to
American youths, Boesak encour
aged students here to take advan
tage of them and not to go to
school "simply because you want
to make it for yourself. Our stu
dents have taught us that those
things are not important. To help
build a better tomorrow and to
share with others" is more im
portant, he said.
Keynote speaker Tom Massey,
past director of the Black Student
Volunteer Center (the precursor
to the Black Community Service
Center), recounted his experiences

as a Stanford undergraduate.
"In 1968 I was a transfer stu
dent and had only been here eight
months when (King's) assassina
tion took place. I knew of preju
dice firsthand, but it was Martin's
word that made me look forward
to days ahead: If I just worked
hard and studied all would be
well. Now, it all seems so selfish,"
he said.
Massey said most of the 150
black Stanford students had
middle- and lower-class, urban
backgrounds and "all had come
for the opportunity for education
— the ticket for a better life."
Massey said black students
began to organize partially in re
sponse to negative white attitudes
towards their lifestyles. "We spent
endless hours talking, manifested
by white students' comments, and
'more' became the operant word:
why weren't there more black stu
dents, and why wasn't there a
more relevant curriculum and
more of a sense of community in
the residences?"
Although becoming involved in
black politics led him to feel more
"focused, that that was who Mar
tin wanted me to be," Massey said
King's assassination caused him
to feel threatened.
"1 trusted no one. I began to
feel my black peers were pushing
too hard for proposals," he said,
noting that plans for a particular
rally led to much inner-turmoil.
"I tried to convince my friends
that it was so dangerous and po

tentially destructive to our future
and aspirations."
Massey eventually committed
himself to the black community's
agenda and related his experiences
to the current situation at Stan
ford. "I hear more talk of diversity
and tolerance of difference but am
not seeing it translated into real
programs or action."
Massey said all members of the
Stanford community — not just
the minority groups — must be
come involved in efforts to unite
the campus. "The ethnic students
here have done more than all the
great minds and organizational
wizards who work and reside
here."
The approximately 50 people
gathered for the rally also heard
Rachel Bagby sing the traditional
spiritual "This Little Light of
Mine." Bagby, the associate direc
tor of the Martin Luther King
Papers Project, said the spiritual
"talks about living (King's) values
out 365 days of the year. We each
have that power to give what we
have and to let it shine through
our lives all the time."
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs

Keith Archuleta related King's
career of social change to the
BSU's own accomplishments on
the Stanford campus. "The BSU
has been able to change the idea
of curriculum at a institu
tion."
Archuleta, who also directs the
Black Community Service Center,,
said the BSU has managed to
"scare" former Secretary of Edu
cation William Bennett and Stan
ford French Prof. Robert Cohn,
both of whom reflect "a rightist
trend of not valuing people of
color and not valuing democracy
in education."
Archuleta ended his portion of
the rally with a poem, "Thank
You for Lettin' Me Be Myself
Again" that honored the efforts
of such blacks as Harriet Tubman,
Frederick Douglass and Sojourner
Truth.

himself to the black community's
agenda and related his experiences
to the current situation at Stan
ford. "I hear more talk of diversity
and tolerance of difference but am
not seeing it translated into real
programs or action."
Massey said all members of the
Stanford community — not just
the minority groups — must be
come involved in efforts to unite
the campus. "The ethnic students
here have done more than all the
great minds and organizational
wizards who work and reside
here."
The approximately 50 people
gathered for the rally also heard
Rachel Bagby sing the traditional
spiritual "This Little Light of
Mine." Bagby, the associate direc
tor of the Martin Luther King
Papers Project, said the spiritual
"talks about living (King's) values
out 365 days of the year. We each
have that power to give what we
have and to let it shine through
our lives all the time."
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs

Keith Archuleta related King's
career of social change to the
BSU's own accomplishments on
the Stanford campus. "The BSU
has been able to change the idea
of curriculum at a institu
tion."
Archuleta, who also directs the
Black Community Service Center,,
said the BSU has managed to
"scare" former Secretary of Edu
cation William Bennett and Stan
ford French Prof. Robert Cohn,
both of whom reflect "a rightist
trend of not valuing people of
color and not valuing democracy
in education."
Archuleta ended his portion of
the rally with a poem, "Thank
You for Lettin' Me Be Myself
Again" that honored the efforts
of such blacks as Harriet Tubman,
Frederick Douglass and Sojourner
Truth.
Local and international black
community leaders heralded the
legacy of the late Rev. Martin Lu
ther King in both song and speech
Friday as part of this week's
events commemorating the slain
civil rights leader.
The noon rally held in White
Plaza featured speeches by South
African anti-apartheid leader Rev.
Allan Boesak, Black Student Un
ion Secretary Louis Jackson and
former Dean of Student Affairs
Tom Massey.
Boesak, who founded South
Africa's United Democratic Front,
pointed to the youth in South
Africa as models for American
students: "It is young people who
have changed the course of events
in South Africa, and these stu
dents will change the face of South
Africa's future."
Boesak said thousands of stu
dents have been jailed, tear gassed
and shot at in their rejection of
apartheid because they have
"refused to accept the govern
ment's definition" of who they
are. "They will take responsibility
not only for their own lives but
for their country."
Adding that he is "astonished"

at the opportunities open to
American youths, Boesak encour
aged students here to take advan
tage of them and not to go to
school "simply because you want
to make it for yourself. Our stu
dents have taught us that those
things are not important. To help
build a better tomorrow and to
share with others" is more im
portant, he said.
Keynote speaker Tom Massey,
past director of the Black Student
Volunteer Center (the precursor
to the Black Community Service
Center), recounted his experiences

as a Stanford undergraduate.
"In 1968 I was a transfer stu
dent and had only been here eight
months when (King's) assassina
tion took place. I knew of preju
dice firsthand, but it was Martin's
word that made me look forward
to days ahead: If I just worked
hard and studied all would be
well. Now, it all seems so selfish,"
he said.
Massey said most of the 150
black Stanford students had
middle- and lower-class, urban
backgrounds and "all had come
for the opportunity for education
— the ticket for a better life."
Massey said black students
began to organize partially in re
sponse to negative white attitudes
towards their lifestyles. "We spent
endless hours talking, manifested
by white students' comments, and
'more' became the operant word:
why weren't there more black stu
dents, and why wasn't there a
more relevant curriculum and
more of a sense of community in
the residences?"
Although becoming involved in
black politics led him to feel more
"focused, that that was who Mar
tin wanted me to be," Massey said
King's assassination caused him
to feel threatened.
"1 trusted no one. I began to
feel my black peers were pushing
too hard for proposals," he said,
noting that plans for a particular
rally led to much inner-turmoil.
"I tried to convince my friends
that it was so dangerous and po

tentially destructive to our future
and aspirations."
Massey eventually committed
himself to the black community's
agenda and related his experiences
to the current situation at Stan
ford. "I hear more talk of diversity
and tolerance of difference but am
not seeing it translated into real
