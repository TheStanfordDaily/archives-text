Local and international black
community leaders heralded the
legacy of the late Rev. Martin Lu
ther King in both song and speech
Friday as part of this week's
events commemorating the slain
civil rights leader.
The noon rally held in White
Plaza featured speeches by South
African anti-apartheid leader Rev.
Allan Boesak, Black Student Un
ion Secretary Louis Jackson and
former Dean of Student Affairs
Tom Massey.
Boesak, who founded South
Africa's United Democratic Front,
pointed to the youth in South
Africa as models for American
students: "It is young people who
have changed the course of events
in South Africa, and these stu
dents will change the face of South
Africa's future."
Boesak said thousands of stu

and shot at in their rejection of
apartheid because they have
"refused to accept the govern

are. "They will take responsibility
not only for their own lives but
for their country."
Adding that he is "astonished"

at the opportunities open to
American youths, Boesak encour
aged students here to take advan
tage of them and not to go to
school "simply because you want
to make it for yourself. Our stu
dents have taught us that those
things are not important. To help
build a better tomorrow and to
share with others" is more im
portant, he said.
Keynote speaker Tom Massey,
past director of the Black Student
Volunteer Center (the precursor
to the Black Community Service
Center), recounted his experiences

as a Stanford undergraduate.
"In 1968 I was a transfer stu
dent and had only been here eight
months when (King's) assassina
tion took place. I knew of preju
dice firsthand, but it was Martin's
word that made me look forward
to days ahead: If I just worked
hard and studied all would be
well. Now, it all seems so selfish,"
he said.
Massey said most of the 150
black Stanford students had
middle- and lower-class, urban
