## Iran accused of mass executions Opposition group says over 12,000 dissidents killed since August 
### 
NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - The
bodies of hundreds of Iranian po
litical prisoners executed in recent
weeks have been discovered in
mass graves, the main Iranian op
position group said yesterday.
The Mujahedeen Khalq, or
People's Holy Warriors, said more
than 94 people alone had been
executed in Abhar, west of Teh
ran, in the past few weeks.
The claim came in a statement
to The Associated Press in Cyprus
from the group's headquarters in
Baghdad, Iraq. There was no in
dependent confirmation.
The group has said that more
than 12,000 political prisoners
have been executed since August.
A United Nations report in No
vember estimated that 1,100 pris

oners had been executed since Au
gust.
The London-based Amnesty In
ternational human rights organi
zation earlier said it believed more
than 300 people had been ex
ecuted since July and that the
total could run into the thousands.
Iran has denied such reports
but has said that scores of con
victed drug smugglers and "un
repentant" dissidents have been
executed in Tehran, the nation's
capital, and other cities.
The Mujahedeen quoted wit
nesses as saying prison guards
dug a large trench near a road in
the northern province of Gilan
and in one night buried several
truckloads of bodies.

Office of "secretly burying a large
number of execution victims"
near an Armenian cemetery on a
road north of the city. The graves
were "too shallow and stray dogs
unearthed some of the bodies,
which revealed the site to passers
by," the statement said.
The group also claimed that a
large number of victims have been

buried in trenchs in Tehran's
sprawling Behshat-e-Zahra ceme
tery.
In the central city of Isfahan,
prison guards have been taking
the bodies of executed prisoners
"in batches of 100, 60 and 40" to
a city cemetery for burial in mass
reaves, the Mujahedeen said.
To avoid public attention,
prison guards dressed as cemetery
employees loaded the bodies on
buses whose seats had been
removed, the Mujahedeen's state
ment said.
Dissident Iranians claim that
the executions are aimed at elim
inating opposition activists amid
political uncertainty following the
cease-fire Iran agreed to in Au
gust in its war with Iraq.
