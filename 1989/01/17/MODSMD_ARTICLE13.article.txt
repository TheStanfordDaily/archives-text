# Americans celebrate King holiday
## 
### 
Americans honored the memory
of Martin Luther King Jr. yester
day with ceremonies, speeches
and symbolic acts that testified
to the vitality of the slain civil
rights leader's legacy.
The Liberty Bell in Philadelphia
was symbolically tapped, national
leaders joined King's family in At
lanta and President-elect George
Bush praised the fallen leader on
the national holiday that com
memorates his birth.
"He lived a hero's life. He
dreamed a hero's dreams," Bush
told black political leaders in
Washington."He left a hero's in
delible mark on the mind and im
agination of a great nation."
Nowhere was that mark felt
more strongly than in Selma, Ala.,
where King began the 1965
Selma-to-Montgomery march that
helped establish voting rights for
blacks throughout the South.
Yesterday, three blacks were
sworn in as members of the Dallas
County Commission, based in
Selma. They became the first
black commissioners in Selma
since Reconstruction and gave the
five-member commission a black
.majority.

Dolized by fire noses and police
(Hogs in the civil rights battles of
the 19605, Mayor Richard Ar

rington said at a rally that "sym
bols of history are all around us,"
including the 16th Street Baptist
Church, where a bomb killed four
black girls in 1963.
"This is sacred ground — every
bit as sacred as Bunker Hill," Ar
rington said.
Further north in Atlanta, black
and white political leaders joined
King's family, including his
widow, Coretta Scott King, for the
annual ecumenical service at the
Ebenezer Baptist Church, where
both King and his father
preached.
Jesse Jackson, once one of
King's controversial young
lieutenants, used the occasion to
criticize President Reagan for sug
gesting last week that some black
leaders perpetuated the civil
rights movement for their own
benefit.
Chiding Reagan for being "pet
ty," Jackson said: "Mr. Reagan is
still haunted by the movement for
justice."
In Pretoria, South Africa, U.S.
Ambassador Edward Perkins
marked the holiday by unveiling
a bronze bust of King that will
