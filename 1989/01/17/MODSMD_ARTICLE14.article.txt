# Anti-apartheid guerrillas sentenced
## Three from African National Congress get up to 23 years in prison 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South
Africa (AP) — Three African Na
tional Congress guerrillas, includ
ing a senior leader, were sentenced
yesterday to prison terms of up
to 23 years for land mine explo
sions that injured eight people.
All three could have been sen
tenced to death. They turned
toward supporters in the gallery
at the Pretoria Supreme Court
and gave clenched-fist salutes
before they were led away.
A 20-year sentence for treason
was issued to the most prominent
defendant, Ebrahim Ismail
Ebrahim, 51, who was abducted
from Swaziland in 1986 by men
he said were South African agents.
Ebrahim, of Indian descent, has
been widely described as the
highest-ranking official of the
mainly black ANC to go on trial
since Nelson Mandela and several
colleagues were given life sen
tences in 1964. The ANC is the
largest guerrilla group fighting
the white-dominated government.
One of Ebrahim's black co
defendants. Mandla Maseko. re

ceived a 23-year sentence for
treason. Simon Dladla, a Swazi
citizen, received 12 years for ter
rorism. He could not be found
guilty of treason because he did
not owe allegiance to South
Africa.
The three were found guilty in
November of laying land mines
that injured eight people in
Transvaal Province in 1986. At
one stage of the 16-month trial,
three members of the ANC's ex
ecutive committee — who faced
arrest in South Africa — gave
evidence for the defense at a court
session held last year in London.
Ebrahim, along with his co
defendants, did not testify during
the trial, but he submitted a 17-
page written statement to the
court in which he alleged that all
three men were tortured by police.
"Finding us guilty is merely a
statement that the state considers
the struggle for democracy,
equality, justice, peace and a non
racial society to be morally and
politically reprehensible," he said.
