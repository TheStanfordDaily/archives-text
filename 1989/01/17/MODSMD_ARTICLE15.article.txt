VIENNA, Austria (AP) - The
Soviet Union will start its uni
lateral withdrawal of troops from
Eastern Europe in April, Mos
cow's deputy defense minister
said on Austrian television yes
terday.
Deputy Defense Minister Vitaly
Shabanov told Austrian TV's
Moscow correspondent the partial
withdrawal of 50,000 troops from
Hungary, Czechoslovakia and
East Germany announced last
month by President Mikhail Gor
bachev will take place in two
phases.
The first phase will be complete
this year, and the second in 1990,
Shabanov said.
"We assume it will begin in the
coming April," Shabanov was
quoted as saying.
Hungarian Communist Party
leader Karoly Grosz was quoted
as telling a .Japanese newspaper
last week that the withdrawal of
Soviet troops from his country
would begin within wet'ks, but
fixed no date
Hungarian Defense Minister
Ferenc Karpati, interviewed by
The Associated Press in Budapest

after Grosz's comments, declined
to set a date for the partial with
drawal of the estimated 62,000
Soviet troops in Hungary.
Hungary gave an enthusiastic
welcome to Gorbachev's an
nouncement Dec. 7 that 50,000
Soviet troops and 5,000 tanks
would be withdrawn as part of a
worldwide reduction of Red Army
forces by half a million men in
the next two years.
In Prague, Czechoslovakia, yes
terday, Soviet Ambassador
Vladimir Lomakin announced
that one Soviet division would be
withdrawn soon from that coun
try.
According to an account of
Lomakin's statement by the state
news agency CTK, Lomakin said
that further troop withdrawals
depend "on the attitude of NATO
countries and the development of
the international situation."
Czechoslovakia has had an es
timated 80,000 Soviet troops sta
tioned on its territory since the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion
of 1968 to crush reforms.
On Saturday, the 16 NATO na

tions and seven Warsaw Pact
allies signed a mandate for new
arms talks for reducing conven
tional troops and weapons across
Europe.
Gorbachev has presented his
unilateral withdrawal of Soviet
troops from Eastern Europe as a
gesture intended to give impetus
to those new negotiations, due to
start in Vienna in March.
Gorbachev, commenting Mon
day on the results of the East-
West conference, called them
"compelling evidence" that his
program envisioning a world with
out nuclear weapons can become
a reality by the year 2000.
"The adoption of a new military
doctrine has reflected the will of
socialist countries to turn about
from the principle of superarma
ment to the principle of reason
able sufficiency for defense," Gor
bachev said.
Ambasssador Lomakin also was
quoted on Monday on saying Mos
cow would like to see all foreign
troops and military bases on the
territory of other states elimi
nated by 2000.
