### 
LONDON (AP) - The govern
ment yesterday tightened security
procedures for airport workers
after two journalists posing as
deaiitDLJexposed maim- lapses at
London's Heathrow
the bombing of
103.
Earlier, the Sunday Post news
paper in Scotland quoted a former
high-ranking Israeli intelligence
agent as saying he believes Abu
Ibrahim, head of a Palestinian
group, planned the Dec. 21 bomb
ing, which killed 270 people.
ABC News, citing unidentified
U.S. and Western intelligence
sources, reported yesterday that
several dozen intelligence agents
from the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization are working with Pan
Am on the investigation of the
bombing.
PLO leader Yasser Arafat had
pledged his group's help in the
investigation, and ABC quoted its
sources as saying the PLO's help
has been exceedingly valuable.
Transport Secretary Paul
Channon said passes will be
issued only to airport employees
or to outside companies "which
the airport manager is satisfied
are reliable and reputable."
"Clearly, some of the firms in
this field in the past have been
far from reliable," he said in a
statement.
Channon said cleaners and
other airport workers now will
have to have held security passes
for at least six months before
being allowed unsupervised access
to aircraft and checked-in bag
gage-
He also praised the "swift ac

tion" of the British Airports Au
thority in withdrawing access to
airplanes from two privately
owned cleaning companies at
Heathrow.
TjjShaiÃŸT Dudmari "of M 1W
w
London Weekend Television,
working independently, told Fri
day how they got jobs as airplane
cleaners at Heathrow using fake
applications.
They said that with passes
issued by the two cleaning com
panies involved, they were able to
wander on and off a dozen jets
where they said they could easily
have planted a bomb.
New York-bound Flight 103 was
destroyed by a bomb over the
Scottish village of Lockerbie, kil
ling 259 people on the plane and
11 on the ground.
The flight originated in
Frankfurt, West Germany, and
baggage and passengers were
transferred to the Boeing 747 at
Heathrow.
In Glasgow, the Sunday Post
newspaper quoted former Mossad
officer Raphael Eitan as saving
he had "no doubt" the bombers
were Ibrahim's May 15 Palestin
ian group, based in Baghdad, Iraq,
and that the bomb was made
there and probably carried on
board the plane by an unwitting
accomplice.
"They are led by Abu Ibrahim,
a qualified engineer. In the early
days Ibrahim received all his fi
nancial support from Iraqi intel
ligence, who continue to provide
him with cash and premises,"
Eitan was quoted as saying.
