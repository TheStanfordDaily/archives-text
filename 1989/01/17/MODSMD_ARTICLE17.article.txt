Haitian students protest regime
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Students set
flaming-tire barricades and shouted anti
government slogans in Cap Haitien on yesterday
before soldiers dispersed hundreds of protesters.
Left-wing groups called for a nationwide strike.
About 1,000 students at Phillipe Guerrier High
School began protesting after soldiers showed up
at the school, apparently because unidentified
agitators threw stones at the building, reported
the Catholic radio station Radio-Soleil.
"Down with Avril!" shouted some of the pro
testers, referring to Lt. Gen Prosper Avril, who
heads the military government.
There were no reports of ir\juries or arrests
at the demonstration in Haiti's second-largest
town, north of the capital.
Israeli embassy bomb defused
LONDON (AP) — Police defused a mail bomb
that arrived yesterday at the Israeli Embassy in
London, the embassy said. Officials would not
say who may have sent it.
Foreign Office minister William Waldegrave
returned from a meeting with Yasser Arafat in
Tunis and said the Palestine Liberation Organ
ization should be given a chance to prove its
peaceful intentions.

Relations between Britain and Israel are under
strain because Israel rejects British suggestions
for a new moderate approach to the PLO since
Arafat, the PLO's chairman, publicly renounced
terrorism last month.
Former prime minister kidnapped
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - A former prime
minister kidnapped near his home over the week
end had received threats recently, Prime Minister
Wilfried Martens said yesterday.
Officials disagreed over whether the abduction
Saturday of former Prime Minister Paul Vanden
Boeynants was political.
About 500 police spent yesterday afternoon,
without success, searching a 75-acre wood at
Baudour, near Mons about 30 miles southwest
of Brussels, after an anonymous caller told a
radio station Vanden Boeynants' body was there.
"Mr. Vanden Boeynants had received threats
lately and had requested to meet with the interior
minister," Martens said on BRT, Belgium's
Dutch-language radio network. He did not elab
orate.
Interior Minister Louis Tobback told BRT that
Vanden Boeynants, 69, had an appointment with
him yesterday "to discuss a personal matter "
Police reported no new leads in their search
for Vanden Boeynants.
