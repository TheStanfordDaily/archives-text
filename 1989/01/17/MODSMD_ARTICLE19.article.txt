Kennedy's essay should
set the stage for future
discussion and action

UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT
Donald Kennedy's essay,
"Reflections on Racial Un
derstanding" is a welcome contri
bution to Stanford's efforts to
grapple with and address this im
portant issue.
Kennedy's letter stands in
marked contrast to the national
tone that has been set by President
Reagan who has steadfastly denied
that racism is a problem in the
United States.
Problems of racial relations exist
in the United States, and conse
quently at Stanford as well. In fact
much of the attention paid to the
issues here stems from the fact
that we have chosen to address
them in a straightforward and
honest fashion.
In his "Reflections," Kennedy
raised a number of important
points that deserve serious consid
eration from the Stanford commu
nity.
• "We are among the few places in
this country in which it . may be
possible to test the workability of
the multicultural existence that
will, ready or not, be the life of
Californians and eventually all
Americans in the 21st century."
It is indeed true that this society
is undergoing rapid demographic
changes that bring added urgency
to the issue of how we will live
together in the future. At UC-
Berkeley and in the K-12 schools,
people of color currently comprise
the majority of the population.
True education, then, must
prepare us to live in this new so
ciety that will be characterized by
diversity of cultures and back
grounds.
• "What do we seek at Stanford?
... A residential academic commu
nity of young men and women who
are committed to serious intellec
tual purposes, and who are engaged
actively in self-realization and in
the support of one another."
We share this definition of Stan
ford's mission, but feel that is in
complete. Since the University
does not exist in a social vacuum,
we bear a social responsibility to
make our society better. The pur
suit of truth and knowledge should
be dedicated toward the end of so
cial amelioration. How can this
community of intellectuals address l
the critical problems facing the
United States and the world?
• "Because we are an educational
institution and because it makes
sense to begin with what you do
best, we can make cultural differ
ences an important part of what
we teach ... We need to make con
tributions and the experiences of
ethnic and religious minorities part
of a whole variety of courses that
deal, in one way or another, with
contemporary society."
This is probably the single most
important section of the essay.
Kennedy is to be commended for
taking a bold and visionary step

by calling for curricular develop
ments beyond Cultures, Ideas and
Values that extend to studying cul
tural differences and contemporary
society.
Such courses would go a long
way towards developing an appre
ciation of the histories and cultures
of the various groups which con
stitute American society and would
heighten awareness of the history
and role of racism in U.S. history.
• "Nor is it understandable to
many students why racial incidents
are so frequently followed by de
mands that bear little relation to
the circumstances or the environ
ments in which the incidents took
place."
This is a difficult issue. On the
one hand, it must be understood
that surface manifestations of
racist sentiment are just the tip of
the iceberg for people of color, and
that they see fighting racism and
political struggle as inextricably
linked.
On the other hand, Kennedy is
right in pointing out that partici
pation in the anti-racist movement
does not call for complete accept
ance of every point of the political
agenda. Some people may not have
enough information on issues to
make a judgment while some
people may juet disagree with cer
tain approaches or demands.
• "I have observed a tendency here
to search quickly, in the aftermath
of each disappointment, for a place
to affix blame. More often than
not, it is 'the institution,' whatever
that means; and the administra
tion is frequently asked to provide
the remedy. But Stanford is many
people and many entities ..."
This is perhaps the most trou
bling aspect of the essay, and the
one which gives us the greatest
concern for the future.
With power comes responsibility,
and it is Kennedy's obligation to
provide leadership for this univer
sity. For too long, initiatives for
change have had to come from the
students and those who pay to get
an education. It is now time for
the top levels of leadership to do
the job they are paid to do and
move Stanford into the next cen
tury.
Ultimately, the proof of the Uni
versity's commitment will be dem
onstrated by action. The most im
portant action will be to determine
where these issues fit on the Uni
versity's list of priorities.
Those priorities are reflected in
the operating budget of the Uni
versity. The kinds of changes Ken
nedy envisions will cost money.
Current challenges before those
who are working to implement CIV
demonstrate that we must put up
the money necessary to attract and
retain faculty members that can
broaden and improve our cur
ricular offerings.
The institutions which provide
cultural breadth and diversity at
Stanford (such as the ethnic
centers and ethnic studies pro
grams) must be strengthened.
These are the types of changes that
must be made in order to make
our vision of a multicultural com
munity into a reality.
