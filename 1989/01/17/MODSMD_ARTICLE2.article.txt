# Daily error may endanger Boesak

### Diane Bisgeier Staff writer 
The Daily's misleading head
line for a Jan. 13 story on Rev.
Allan Boesak's speech may
cause serious problems for both
the South African minister and
anti-apartheid movement in his
country, according to Boesak
and some University officials.
While Boesak said the story
itself was accurate, he ex
pressed concern that the head

line, which read, "S. African
says violence only chance for
change," was misleading and
dangerous. Boesak actually
stated in his Thursday speech
that "we (black South Africans)
are not calling for violence but
we want you (Americans) to
understand how difficult the
situation is in South Africa."
Assoc. Dean of Student Af
fairs Michael Jackson said it is
feasible that the government
could selectively use the headline
against Boesak. "They can use
what they want. It's that kind of
Nazi mentality that is so danger
ous.
"It's been shown time and time
again that when black people (in
South Africa) are suspected of vi
olence they are often arrested and
even killed," Jackson added.
"It was not the article but the
headline that worries me," Boesak
told students Friday at a rally
commemorating Rev. Martin Lu
ther King Jr. "I will go to jail or
die for something I believe in, but
not for something that I didn't
say."
"Irresponsible headlines like
this get people killed in my coun
try," Boesak said at the rally.
However, Jeff Bradley, Toronto
bureau chief of the Associated
Press and a Knight Fellow, said
Boesak's response may be an over
reaction. "I was at the rally and

it struck me as a hyperbole at the
time," he said. "But I'm not black
and 1 don't have to live in South
Africa."
Bradley added that The Daily's
mistake was regrettable and
should not be underplayed.

Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Keith Archuleta emphasized the
impact that such a headline could
have when Boesak returns to
South Africa. "[Boesak's] work is
very important and we would hate
for a headline like that to cause
him undue pressure when he
returns," Archuleta said. "The
headline can be used against him
and cause people actual physical
harm." Archuleta, who is director
of the Black Community Services
Center, coordinated Boesak's visit
to the United States.
Jackson, who served on the
Martin Luther King Jr. Com
memorative Committee that or
ganized this week's events, ex
plained that it is "very important
that when we in the United States
look at what I Boesak] does we
understand what he must go back

to — a very dangerous and treac
herous government."
Boesak, who heads a ministry
of over 70 million South Africans,
wields a tremendous amount of
influence in South Africa. His
prominence compelled sponsors to
pay more than $13,000 to bring
him here, according to Timothy
Pinkston, vice chair of the Black
Graduate Students Association.
"He and Bishop Desmond Tutu
are comparable in stature and in
fluence. Whenever there is a
march or rally in South Africa,
he and Tutu are walking side by
side," said Pinkston, who played
a major role in arranging Boesak's
trip to the Bay Area.
Pinkston said the $13,000 in
cluded bodyguards, airfare and
honoraria for Boesak, who has ap
peared on the ABC news show
"Nightline" several times and "is
up there with Winnie Mandela."
Black Student Union Chair
Mary Dillard said her main con
cern is that whatever Boesak says
is correctly depicted by the press.

to be accurate or else he could
suffer," she said.
