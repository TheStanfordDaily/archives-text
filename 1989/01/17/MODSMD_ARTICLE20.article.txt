# Editor's Note
## 
### 
DUE TO an unfortunate editing
error, the headline in Friday's
Daily for the article on the Rev.
Allan Boesak was inaccurate and mis
leading. The Daily editorial staff
apologizes for the juxtaposition of the
factually correct article and the er
roneous headline. We hope that our
readers read the story and not just the
headline.
We made a mistake. We are truly
sorry and recognize the consequences
of our error. In no way did we intend
to offend anyone nor anticipate any
possible repercussions for Boesak.

The idea that Boesak would advocate
violence is clearly at odds with his
commitment to non-violence as a
means of change.
We will send a letter of apology to
Boesak, which will state our commit
ment to provide any future clarification
concerning his statements that may be
necessary.
The Daily staff is committed to a
level of excellence. We apologize for
failing to maintain this level and in
the process possibly endangering some
one else.
