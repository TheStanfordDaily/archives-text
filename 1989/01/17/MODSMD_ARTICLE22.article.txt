## Not quite self-searching

"Better columnists are . . . needed.
They're in high profile positions, but this
volume's columnists tended to write self
searching pieces that don't grab enough
readers."
— from the platform of a candidate for
editor in chief of vol. 195.
YO, DUDES AND DUDETTES. The
preceding capitalized sentence was
written to grab your attention. Un
less you're in Calculus 042, any Western
Culture lecture or a stall, in which case
you'll read anything.
Today, we have something novel, some
thing stupendous, something that only
comes along 30 times a decade — election
hour for the next Stanford Daily editor
in chief (Ooh, aah).
, Sinc6j .-my fundamental, inalienable
tight to* vote for the next editor in chief
has been mercilessly stripped away by
the powers that be, I shall instead be
forced to influence the election through
the written word.
At high noon (can you hear the whis
tling?) a grill session shall take place in
ye olde Daily building. Grill sessions are
important because they make all prospec
tive editor in chiefs answer stupid ques
tions.
Hypothetical question: "Hey wanna-be,
if you were given 1/16 of an inch of space,
what would you fill it with?" Hypothetical
answer: "Job description of a non-voting
member of the ASSU senate." There will
also be lots of gnashing of teeth, some
logical incoherence and a few sound-bites.
A few essential questions, however,
need to be asked at the grill session. Why

don't columnists get paid lots of money?
How can something be strong enough for
a man yet made for a woman? Why are
the Cincinnati Bengals going to beat the
San Francisco 49ers, 20-17? Why do
people seem so homogeneous at Stanford?
Why do French people call R2D2, the
little moving trash can in Star Wars,
"D2R2"? Is the Stanford Review a parody
or a publication? The following statement
is true; the preceding statement is false;
. . . how can this be?
After the grill session, only those people
who receive lots of money from The Daily
will get to vote while those who work for
free, such as weekly columnists, sit and
ponder why they're working for free.
Then the votes will be tallied and the
loser will . . . well, lose. The winner, on
the other hand, will become Grand Poo
bah of Stanford's only daily newspaper,
except on Saturdays, Sundays, ski
holidays and the last two weeks of the
quarter.
Given only two candidates, however,
election results promise to be rather
boring. Not in any way to upstage The
Daily or the candidates themselves, of
course, I would merely like to propose
other directions such an election could
turn.
I hereby announce my entrance as a
last minute write-in candidate for the
honorable post of editor in chief of the
aforementioned daily newspaper of
Leland Stanford Jr. University (Ooh,
aah).
My platform, unlike the voluminous,
laser-printed rhetoric of my adversaries
consists of a mere six points. I will:

• Have a bigger beach at Lake Lag (it
worked for Amol Doshi).
• Make The Daily part of the "core list"
in Western Culture/CIV/ABC/CBS/NBC.
• Eradicate the federal deficit.
• Proclaim the first page of The Daily
the last.
• Fund the entire centennial campaign
with a bold soy crop venture.
• Death before dishonor.
I am grateful to the William and Flora
Hewlett Foundation for funding my Daily
columns. Special thanks are due to Evan
Schofer, Ed Pike, Eric Li, Daniella Evans,
Sandy Aronson and George Will for of
fering their wisdom and self-searching
ideas during late-night rap sessions.
Finally, I am indebted to Darryl Han
nah for reading and re-reading every con
voluted sentence. For whatever omissions
and intended factual errors present in
the text, I alone am responsible.

Ted Lieu is a sophomore in computer

Editor's Note: Only staff members get to

columnists' independence from Daily

staff member but a voice of the commu
nity.
