## Attack on CIV track unfair 
### 
IN A PAROXYSM of cliches,
sloganeering and slovenly thinking,
the editor of the Stanford Review
objects to Anthropology Prof. Renato
Rosaldo's objections to the Review.
Peter Thiel levels the very serious
charge that Rosaldo lied and slandered
the Review. Thiel has a responsibility
to demonstrate this charge and he
failed to do so. But let us look at
Thiel's own tactics:
• .To call Rosaldo's response a "vi
cious, ad hominem letter" is an inac
curate use of the term ad hominem,
which is an attempt to refute the logic
of an argument by objecting to a per
son's character — this is what Thiel
himself commits when he impugns
Rosaldo as a "vicious demagogue" who
"spouts his drivel."
• Appealing to an editor of the Wall
Street Journal (hardly one to judge on
anybody's behalf a discipline as remote
from commercial profiteering as an
thropology) to corroborate his own
fears scarcely justifies the substance of
Thiel's fears as logical.
• "He (Rosaldo] does not discuss any
of the 'auspicious' writers such as
Rigoberta Menchu (a Guatemalan
communist) and Frantz Fanon (who
urged the killing of white people en
'nasse)." The latter is an utter distor
tion; the former implies that a writer
is not readable because s/he is: (a)
Guatemalan (non-white) or (b) a com
munist.
If political, racial or moral objections
were grounds for banning the study of
certain books, we would have to drop
Marx, Hitler, Machiavelli, Napoleon,
the Declaration of Independence and
the Bible since any of these texts
contain passages patently subversive to
one kind of thinking or another.
• "His track 'deconstructs' some of
the classics, reading Shakespeare's The
Tempest as a case study in imperialism'
and the book (sic) of Genesis under the

rubric (sic) of 'making other cultural
selves.'" One can only surmise Thiel
doesn't understand what is involved in
the use of words in quotations because
their appearance in this context makes
no sense, and I know for a fact that
Rosaldo is well acquainted with a
sensible use of both.
"Deconstruction" examines the
premises of an argument; it does not
advance as a routine matter anti
"imperialist" revolution, although it
and indeed the Bible are capable of
being read in that light.
• "His track consists of little more
than a collection of marginal left-wing
writers, whose only unifying thread lies
(sic) in their passionate hatred of the
West." How eloquently this bizarre
passage demonstrates the very con
cerns of the CIV curriculum. 'Mar
ginal,' 'left-wing,' 'hatred' and 'the
West' invoke and consecrate self-evident
and imperturbable assumptions instinc
tively identified as the very basis of
thinking in 'the West' which must hold
at bay the menace of 'other' ways of
thinking.
The panic-stricken distortions of the
Review's "article" (in the spirit of
Thiel, I use quotation marks for the
things that really don't make sense to
me) are symptomatic of a telling reluc
tance to even consider examining these
sacred assumptions. If what is valuable
to Thiel truly warrants our allegiance,
it seems to me they would survive
a vigorous and healthy examination.
CIV is not the dismantling of "the
West." It is an effort to diversify our
intellectual and cultural understanding
and tolerance — it invites, it does not
banish. As an apologist for the instinct
to exclude and banish, Thiel betrays a
particularly egregious contradiction in
complaining about Rosaldo's in
tolerance.
