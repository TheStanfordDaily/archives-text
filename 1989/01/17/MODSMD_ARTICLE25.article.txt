Undoubtedly, when issues regarding
minorities' political power and the im
portance of largely ignored womens'
and minorities' ideas come to the fore

debates, tension between the opposing
parties will heighten. However, the
major flaw in Work's letter is that he
overlooks the grievances behind so
called "radical trivia" to suggest that
maintaining a tension-free environment
should be more important to everyone
than addressing issues regarding race,
class and gender.
Work states that in the real world
one finds more enlightenment and
tolerance than at Stanford. Is this
true? I have found that the opposite is
true, because in the real world this
"tolerant atmosphere" is simply a
facade that hides the problem of dis
crimination and inequality: in the real
world people face the struggle of sup
porting their families and paying the

rent, and they have less time to fight
against the inequalities that they see
and feel.
In this light, the political activities
on campuses are not indicators of "less
enlightenment", but rather demonstrate
that in a sheltered environment geared
towards thinking about ourselves and
our society, many students vocalize
their perceptions of the inadequacies of
our curriculum and of politics, al
though this may contribute to debate
and polarization.
However, blaming supporters of CIV
and advocates of racial power politics
for this polarization is tantamount to
blaming Rosa Parks for the opposition
she encountered when she sat in the
"Whites Only" front of the bus. It is
ludicrous to blame victims of injustice
for the unrest that results from their
refusal to submit to their oppressors.
Regarding the dangers inherent in
labeling "our brightest young people",
I am afraid that Work is guilty of this
himself. Some instances of generaliza
tions: "students in the sciences are
more tolerant than those in the hu
manities," "the bulk of loony-left
noise" and "radical trivia."
It is possible to simultaneously op
pose ideas and have respect and under

Cohn's simple facts
are simply false
French Prof. Robert Greer Cohn's
recent letter claims to present the
"simple facts" concerning the reading
list for Anthropolgy Prof. Renato
Rosaldo's pilot CIV course.
I wish to point out that Cohn's rep
resentation of the "facts" is from a
particular — and ideologically charged
— point of view. He writes as one who
had been "active in the restoration of
Western Culture" and he writes to
eclipse the voice of "minor"(ity?) au
thors.
As to the "facts," Cohn mistakenly
cites the wrong title for Americo
Paredes' "With His Pistol in His
Hands". Cohn's reading of the title
wants the pistol in "my" hand; readers
of Paredes might find the slip telling.
The book relates and analyzes the
ballad of Gregorio Cortez, situating the
tale within the tradition of Mexican-
American balladry and folklore.
Gregorio, the protagonist of the ballad,
does have a pistol in his hand. The
sheriff who shot and killed Gregorio's
brother also had a pistol. The shooting
arose from the sheriffs mistranslation
between Spanish and English; his con
fusion led him to wrongly assume that
the innocent Gregorio had committed a
crime.
I find the choice of this text, taught
in a state which recently voted in favor
of an English language proposition, to
raise relevant issues for students here.
How has the violence wielded by
dominant pistols or pens which deny
the experience of minority (but most
definitely not minor) voices shaped our
own reading of texts? Paredes' life was
threatened by Texas law enforcement
officials; pistols thus threatened to
silence Paredes' pen. An important
question thus becomes: how are pens,
pistols and power related to canons —
especially those currently dominant in
the undergraduate curriculum here?
Far from presenting "simple facts,"
Cohn's letter reveals a perspective that
Edward Said might call "Orientalism"
and I would call irresponsible. Cohn
has fixed on "Other" — minor(ity)
authors writing outside of Cohn's clas

sical canon — with essential character
istics: Cohn's "other" is violent, writes
with "knives in their teeth," and plots
murder.
This rhetorical move tries to advance
such claims from a privileged stand
point of the defense of Western Cul
ture. An example may help illustrate
this point.

the reading list, and attributes a "pro
gram to murder white people en
masse" to the writer.
Fanon, born in Martinique in 1925,
received much of his education in
France and completed his medical
training in Lyon before settling in
Algeria. He was a revolutionary and he
envisioned violence as a means to se
cure the liberation of Africans who had
been colonized by Europeans.
Fanon's ideas were shaped by his
experience in Africa and Europe; he
thus offers excellent insight into the
meeting of different cultural traditions
a meeting conducted on unequal
terms.
Fanon's psychiatric practice con
vinced him of the psychological as well
as physical brutality of colonialism.
Fanon also experienced the violence of
colonialism directly. Would Cohn deny
the violence of the colonial context in
which Fanon wrote? Fanon was also
well aware of the French Revolution;
would Cohn characterize this historical
event as the "murder of white people
en masse?"
The point is not to debate the
legitimacy of violence in revolutionary
struggles; it is to examine texts, au
thors and the historical contexts sur-

rounding their production. Of course,
we should also attend to the contexts
in which those texts and ideas are
received.
To depict so-called "obscure" authors
as writing with "knives in their teeth"
is to fix them with a violent mentality
that appears natural. The implication
is that these violent authors are some
how essentially different from those in
the "civilized" West where good stu
dents read texts written by the
honorable citizens of Athens.
Some ancients condoned slavery; this
does not prevent us from reading
them. Fanon advocated violence; this
should not preclude us from reading
him and learning from his insights.
There is nothing inherently violent in
the writers Cohn mentions — and he
does not choose to cite Zora Neale
Hurston, whose "Their Eyes Were
Watching God" is also on the CIV pilot
course reading list — just as there is
nothing inherently "minor" about
them.
Cohn's standards of evaluation are
themselves the product of an histori
cally specific experience of learning and
teaching. To present them as though
they were absolute is to engage in
what the French theorist Pierre Bour
dieu calls "symbolic violence."
Cohn's condemnation of the CIV
pilot course's reading list arises from
evaluative criteria specific to the classi
cal canon he vilifies.
Lest we all become Canon fodder for
those who refuse to listen to the mi
nority voices that have shaped history
— within and beyond the "West" —
we need to read texts critically.
Responsible reading (and writing)
involves situating readers, writers, and
actors within historical, social, and
cultural contexts. This kind of reading
would examine the way that highly
biased and ideologically charged "facts"
are presented as natural and neutral,
from either the right or the left. Such
critical reading would uncover the
"symbolic violence" manifest in much
writing.
Rosaldo's CIV pilot course is de
signed to promote that kind of respon
sible reading; it thus has a valuable
lesson to teach Professor Cohn.

Cohn's simple facts
are simply false
French Prof. Robert Greer Cohn's
recent letter claims to present the
"simple facts" concerning the reading
list for Anthropolgy Prof. Renato
Rosaldo's pilot CIV course.
I wish to point out that Cohn's rep
resentation of the "facts" is from a
particular — and ideologically charged
— point of view. He writes as one who
had been "active in the restoration of
Western Culture" and he writes to
eclipse the voice of "minor"(ity?) au
thors.
As to the "facts," Cohn mistakenly
cites the wrong title for Americo
Paredes' "With His Pistol in His
Hands". Cohn's reading of the title
wants the pistol in "my" hand; readers
of Paredes might find the slip telling.
The book relates and analyzes the
ballad of Gregorio Cortez, situating the
tale within the tradition of Mexican-
American balladry and folklore.
Gregorio, the protagonist of the ballad,
does have a pistol in his hand. The
sheriff who shot and killed Gregorio's
brother also had a pistol. The shooting
arose from the sheriffs mistranslation
between Spanish and English; his con
fusion led him to wrongly assume that
the innocent Gregorio had committed a
crime.
I find the choice of this text, taught
in a state which recently voted in favor
of an English language proposition, to
raise relevant issues for students here.
How has the violence wielded by
dominant pistols or pens which deny
the experience of minority (but most
definitely not minor) voices shaped our
own reading of texts? Paredes' life was
threatened by Texas law enforcement
officials; pistols thus threatened to
silence Paredes' pen. An important
question thus becomes: how are pens,
pistols and power related to canons —
especially those currently dominant in
the undergraduate curriculum here?
Far from presenting "simple facts,"
Cohn's letter reveals a perspective that
Edward Said might call "Orientalism"
and I would call irresponsible. Cohn
has fixed on "Other" — minor(ity)
authors writing outside of Cohn's clas

sical canon — with essential character
istics: Cohn's "other" is violent, writes
with "knives in their teeth," and plots
murder.
This rhetorical move tries to advance
such claims from a privileged stand
point of the defense of Western Cul
ture. An example may help illustrate
this point.

the reading list, and attributes a "pro
gram to murder white people en
masse" to the writer.
Fanon, born in Martinique in 1925,
received much of his education in
France and completed his medical
training in Lyon before settling in
Algeria. He was a revolutionary and he
envisioned violence as a means to se
cure the liberation of Africans who had
been colonized by Europeans.
Fanon's ideas were shaped by his
experience in Africa and Europe; he
thus offers excellent insight into the
meeting of different cultural traditions
a meeting conducted on unequal
terms.
Fanon's psychiatric practice con
vinced him of the psychological as well
as physical brutality of colonialism.
Fanon also experienced the violence of
colonialism directly. Would Cohn deny
the violence of the colonial context in
which Fanon wrote? Fanon was also
well aware of the French Revolution;
would Cohn characterize this historical
event as the "murder of white people
en masse?"
The point is not to debate the
legitimacy of violence in revolutionary
struggles; it is to examine texts, au
thors and the historical contexts sur-

rounding their production. Of course,
we should also attend to the contexts
in which those texts and ideas are
received.
To depict so-called "obscure" authors
as writing with "knives in their teeth"
is to fix them with a violent mentality
that appears natural. The implication
is that these violent authors are some
how essentially different from those in
the "civilized" West where good stu
dents read texts written by the
honorable citizens of Athens.
Some ancients condoned slavery; this
does not prevent us from reading
them. Fanon advocated violence; this
should not preclude us from reading
him and learning from his insights.
There is nothing inherently violent in
the writers Cohn mentions — and he
does not choose to cite Zora Neale
Hurston, whose "Their Eyes Were
Watching God" is also on the CIV pilot
course reading list — just as there is
nothing inherently "minor" about
them.
Cohn's standards of evaluation are
themselves the product of an histori
cally specific experience of learning and
teaching. To present them as though
they were absolute is to engage in
what the French theorist Pierre Bour
dieu calls "symbolic violence."
Cohn's condemnation of the CIV
pilot course's reading list arises from
evaluative criteria specific to the classi
cal canon he vilifies.
Lest we all become Canon fodder for
those who refuse to listen to the mi
nority voices that have shaped history
— within and beyond the "West" —
we need to read texts critically.
Responsible reading (and writing)
involves situating readers, writers, and
actors within historical, social, and
cultural contexts. This kind of reading
would examine the way that highly
biased and ideologically charged "facts"
are presented as natural and neutral,
from either the right or the left. Such
critical reading would uncover the
"symbolic violence" manifest in much
writing.
Rosaldo's CIV pilot course is de
signed to promote that kind of respon
sible reading; it thus has a valuable
lesson to teach Professor Cohn.
