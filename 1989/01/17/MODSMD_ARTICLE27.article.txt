## Aeronautics, astronautics and gusto Skydiver tumbles through airy success 
### Sally Hamaker 
"I don't know how much it fits into my
studies, but it's fun," said a Stanford Aero
nautics and Astronautics graduate student
who combined his academic and athletic in
terest and jumped into first place in a recent
national collegiate skydiving competition.
Tupper Hyde, presently working towards a
master's degree, spent part of his winter break
in Clewiston, Florida, competing in the U.S.
Collegiate Skydiving Competition, which took
place at the end of December. Hyde placed
first in a two-person team event.
Hyde, along with skydiving partner Keith
Colmer, a student at MIT, won first in the
"two-way relative work" event, where the two
divers were given a pre-arranged set of forma
tions to do together while free-falling. Hyde
met Colmer at MIT, where both were skydiv
ing undergraduates.
Hyde started jumping about a year ago, and
claims that the sport is not as dangerous as
it was 20 years ago. "I was in ROTC at MIT,
and I made some military jumps with the
army," said Hyde.
"Those are a lot different — 20 people jump
out of the plane at only 1,000 feet and you
open your parachute right away. It's not fun.
In sport jumping, you jump from the plane
at 9,500 feet and open (your parachute) at
3,000 feet."

'After [the first few
seconds], you're not
speeding up anymore —
it's not really scary. You
feel like you're laying on a
column of air.'

Hyde explained that for the first few seconds
after jumping from the plane, the diver can
feel his or her body speeding up. "After that,
you're not speeding up anymore — it's not
really scary. You feel like you're laying on a
column of air."
A skydiver free falls at about 120 miles per
hour, or about 1,000 feet in six seconds, ac
cording to Hyde.
"I believe it [skydiving] will be an Olympic
sport within the next eight years," said Hyde.
"Maybe by that time I will have the 2,000 to
3,000 jumps that it would take to compete."
Hyde started a skydiving club during his
undergraduate years at MIT. Although there
is no skydiving club at Stanford, Hyde
skydives locally in Hollister, south of San

Jose. Hyde says that he only knows of a couple
other skydiving Stanford students, ana ex
plained that they don't jump as often as he
does.
Hyde has had to limit his diving because
of its expense; the cost is about $10 for each
jump although he uses his own equipment.
The collegiate sky-diving competition is de
signed for those divers who had completed
less than 100 jumps prior to the competition
— Hyde had completed 95 jumps, and Colmer
had done around 50 jumps. The two divers
jump together from the plane at 9,500 feet,
and have 35 seconds to complete as many of
the pre-arranged formations as possible.
Hyde and Colmer's particular arrangement,
selected at random by the competition's
judges, was made up of three different forma
tions. The first formation was a "head-to
head," the second a "T-shape" and the third
a "caterpillar."
All three formations require that the two
skydivers are "docked" together, gripping each
other so that together they form the
prescribed shape. The score of the event is
equal to the number of formations the two
person team can complete in 35 seconds, sep
arating fully from each other between each
formation.
"You run out of time fast," said Hyde. "Our

first jump we thought we'd gotten
six different formations (running
through the three patterns twice)
but when they posted our score,
we had only gotten three."
Hyde said there are about 45
seconds of free fall time that the
divers have before they must open
their parachutes.
In the final two rounds of the
competition, Hyde and Colmer
scored four completed formations
in the second round, and finished
with seven completed formations
in the third round.
Hyde described his team's third
jump as "pretty incredible. The
judges even came up and congrat
ulated us." The two skydivers
beat their stiffest competitors, a
team from the Georgia Institute
of Technology, by one formation
point.
The skydiving competition,
sponsored by the United States
Parachute Association, is only
open to full-time college students.
Hyde said that he found out about
the competition through a maga
zine which is published by the

association.
Other events at the Florida
competition included accuracy
and style categories; most of these
were won by more experienced
jumpers, according to Hyde. Of
the 120 competitors, many of the
individual events were won by stu
dents from military academies in
cluding West Point and the Air
Force Academy.
