# Going through Einstein and Pringle's with a fine-toothed comb

Dear Bug,
Why didn't Albert Einstein
comb his hair?
— Anselm Kiefer
Albert Einstein was a genius.
More specifically, he was a mad
genius — in two senses. In the
first, Einstein was obviously mad
because he spent all his life doing
ph , ysi ?u
In the second, Einstein was
I mad because his college
,stole the irreplaceable vanity mir
ror and grooming kit that his par
ents had given him as a high school
graduation present.
These two facts are manifest in
his zany hairstyle which has come
to be quasimetonymic in the
caricature of scientists, whatever
that means.
Biographer Ronald Clark says
in his introduction to "Einstein:
The Life and Times" that the

physicist's "aureole of white hair"
helped enlarge him "into the Del
phic oracle" in the last years of
his life. The Bug's not sure what
this means, either, but we are
dealing with a genius so . . .
Clark's 718-page book was
quickly skimmed (as opposed to

Einstein certainly
thought one's coif
fure was vastly
overrated if it were
considered for
more than a mil
lisecond.

slowly skimmed) by the Bug and
from that skimming the Bug was
able to infer the cream of the
reasoning Einstein probably used
when he woke up in the morning
And decided his 'hair needed no
pppiping.
Einstein considered the Earth
to be insignificant in the big
picture scheme of things. Certain
ly, one's coiffure was vastly over
rated if it were considered for
more than a millisecond.
Various out-of-context quotes
support this. Bertrand Russell
said about Einstein: "Personal
matters never occupied more than
odd nooks and crannies in his
thoughts."

Clark also relates a story told
by a man who encountered
Einstein at Oxford: "Einstein had
a faraway look and was asked,
'Dr. Einstein, do tell me what are
you thinking?' 'I am thinking
that, after all, this is a very small
star."'
Dr. Chaim Tschernowitz, whose
name, incidentally, has never been
correctly spelled, has credited
Einstein with this inherently
suspect wisdom: "We know noth
ing about it all. Our knowledge
is but the knowledge of school
children."
Now that the Bug has estab
lished infallible support for the
basic Theory of Insignificance by
which Einstein conducted himself,
he will propose the ramifications
of such a philosophy.

Eiryatoin worked lqng anc} hard
all his life in science class or doing
science homework and this indis
putably proves he was mad. Per
sonally, if the Bug believed he was
an insignificant mite among mil
lions (or, for that matter, any
thing less than the greatest
human being/insect in the history
of the universe) he certainly
would not spend his insignificant
life doing math.
I mean if A 1 was crazy enough

and confident enough to ignore
his split ends and flyaway tufts,
what was he doing hanging out
with nerds?
Actually, Einstein's hair wasn't
always that unruly. He just had
a lot of it. What he needed was
some good relaxing agent, or an
iron, to sorta flatten things out a
little. Clark's book has a pretty
nifty picture section and the Bug

Dear Bug,
Recently, I have seen a lot of
commercials for Pringle's potato
chips. It seems that they are ex
periencing some kind of renais
sance. Could you check it out?
— Barney Fife
Well, Barn', you've brought up
a very interesting subject.
Pringle's is indeed experiencing a
renaissance after many years as
chief resident of the Potato Chip
Hall of Doldrums.
I remember Pringle's growing
quite popular during my high
school years. If memory serves (in
this case perhaps a double fault)
I capitalized on every opportunity
I had in 10th grade to take stacks
of 10 to 15 Pringle's and stuff
'em in my mouth. The other great
thing about Pringle's was that my
10-year-old sister cut her hand
everytime she opened up a new
vacuum-packed canister.
At the time, I also believed that
Pringle's were something new
fangled. Indeed, they can be con
sidered an epitomization of
modern America's gravitation
towards conformity, thinness and

According to its creators, the name
Pringle's was chosen because it has
'alliterative qualities when linked to
'potato chips' and 'Procter & Gamble."

nostalgia, all of which are repre
sented by Pringle's packaging.
Well, it ends up that Pringle's
were introduced to the super
market shelves not in the late
'70s, but in 1968! This, among
other information, was discovered
thanks to a Pringle's pamphlet
procured by the Bug from the
product's mother company, Proc
ter and Gamble.
The good ol' P&G origins of
Pringle's explain why they leave
a subtle disinfectant aftertaste. It
also explains why certain sham
poos, rather than curing my
dandruff, leave a residue of potato
chip flakes.
The pamphlet listed nine vari
eties of Pringle's and their corre
sponding canister colors: 1) Reg
ular Pringle's (red), 2) Cheez-Ums
(orange), 3) Sour Cream 'n Onion
(green), 4) Pringle's Light (silver),
5) Light Ranch (silver 'n blue), 6)
Light B-B-Q (silver 'n bronze), 7)
Idaho Rippled Original (blue), 8)
Idaho Rippled French Onion
(green 'n blue), and 9) Idaho
Rippled Taco 'n Cheddar (tan 'n
blue).

According to the Bug's inside
source at Procter 'n Gamble, Not
really-that-Deep-but-by-no-
means-Shallow Throat, these new
flavors are now in production for
release within the year: 1) Fresh
Cream 'n Onion (puce canister),
2) Pringle's Light Ponderosa
(sepia), 3) Idaho Crinkle-Cut
Original (off-grey), 3V2) Idaho
Nooks 'n Crannies Original (phan
tasmagoric purple), and 4) Idaho
Rippled French Bread 'n Brie (no
canister).
The pamphlet's brief historical
sketch of Pringle's confirms the
Bug's ingenious postulation that
Pringle's epitomizes modern
America. The pamphlet reads,
"Pringle's were developed to over
come the most important con
cerns consumers have about
potato chips in bags. Through
market research, we found con
sumers wanted fresh, crisp,
delicious-tasting potato chips of
uniform size and quality and
fewer broken chips."
While it's not surprising that
consumers wanted "delicious-

tasting" chips, it is sad commen
tary that "uniform size and
quality" were found to be desir
able.
A nice half-filled bag o' Wise
potato chips can be a day of fun
for the apparently unconventional
consumer who enjoys studying the
different shapes, sizes, bubbles
and colors of pre-Pringle's potato
chips. But long gone is the era
when a mutant, charcoal-flavored
Wise chip was considered a
treasured find.
According to the Pringle's
pamphlet, it took 10 years to
develop the product. The name
was chosen because it met these
criteria determined by Procter 'n
Gamble's "marketing experts":
"cheerfulness, gaiety and a hint
of nostalgia."
The pamphlet also boasts of the
name's "alliterative qualities
when linked to 'potato chips' and
'Procter & Gamble."' As well,
Pringle's packaging "provides
space-saving convenience."
The potatoes used for
preservative-free Pringle's are
Russet Burbanks and Norgolds —
from Idaho, Washington, Oregon
and Nevada. The potatoes are
dried and formed into a "smooth
potato dough" before being cut
into shape and fried.
Now, don't you have "a fever
for the flavor of new Pringle's"?
Until next week, the Bug has
spoken.
As always, the Bug hopes his
column will inspire many of you
underachievers to get out there
and change the world. And thus
the Bug offers this aphorism,
courtesy of renowned mystic

Dear Bug,
Recently, I have seen a lot of
commercials for Pringle's potato
chips. It seems that they are ex
periencing some kind of renais
sance. Could you check it out?
— Barney Fife
Well, Barn', you've brought up
a very interesting subject.
Pringle's is indeed experiencing a
renaissance after many years as
chief resident of the Potato Chip
Hall of Doldrums.
I remember Pringle's growing
quite popular during my high
school years. If memory serves (in
this case perhaps a double fault)
I capitalized on every opportunity
I had in 10th grade to take stacks
of 10 to 15 Pringle's and stuff
'em in my mouth. The other great
thing about Pringle's was that my
10-year-old sister cut her hand
everytime she opened up a new
vacuum-packed canister.
At the time, I also believed that
Pringle's were something new
fangled. Indeed, they can be con
sidered an epitomization of
modern America's gravitation
towards conformity, thinness and

According to its creators, the name
Pringle's was chosen because it has
'alliterative qualities when linked to
'potato chips' and 'Procter & Gamble."

nostalgia, all of which are repre
sented by Pringle's packaging.
Well, it ends up that Pringle's
were introduced to the super
market shelves not in the late
'70s, but in 1968! This, among
other information, was discovered
thanks to a Pringle's pamphlet
procured by the Bug from the
product's mother company, Proc
ter and Gamble.
The good ol' P&G origins of
Pringle's explain why they leave
a subtle disinfectant aftertaste. It
also explains why certain sham
poos, rather than curing my
dandruff, leave a residue of potato
chip flakes.
The pamphlet listed nine vari
eties of Pringle's and their corre
sponding canister colors: 1) Reg
ular Pringle's (red), 2) Cheez-Ums
(orange), 3) Sour Cream 'n Onion
(green), 4) Pringle's Light (silver),
5) Light Ranch (silver 'n blue), 6)
Light B-B-Q (silver 'n bronze), 7)
Idaho Rippled Original (blue), 8)
Idaho Rippled French Onion
(green 'n blue), and 9) Idaho
Rippled Taco 'n Cheddar (tan 'n
blue).

According to the Bug's inside
source at Procter 'n Gamble, Not
really-that-Deep-but-by-no-
means-Shallow Throat, these new
flavors are now in production for
release within the year: 1) Fresh
Cream 'n Onion (puce canister),
2) Pringle's Light Ponderosa
(sepia), 3) Idaho Crinkle-Cut
Original (off-grey), 3V2) Idaho
Nooks 'n Crannies Original (phan
tasmagoric purple), and 4) Idaho
Rippled French Bread 'n Brie (no
canister).
The pamphlet's brief historical
sketch of Pringle's confirms the
Bug's ingenious postulation that
Pringle's epitomizes modern
America. The pamphlet reads,
"Pringle's were developed to over
come the most important con
cerns consumers have about
potato chips in bags. Through
market research, we found con
sumers wanted fresh, crisp,
delicious-tasting potato chips of
uniform size and quality and
fewer broken chips."
While it's not surprising that
consumers wanted "delicious-

tasting" chips, it is sad commen
tary that "uniform size and
quality" were found to be desir
able.
A nice half-filled bag o' Wise
potato chips can be a day of fun
for the apparently unconventional
consumer who enjoys studying the
different shapes, sizes, bubbles
and colors of pre-Pringle's potato
chips. But long gone is the era
when a mutant, charcoal-flavored
Wise chip was considered a
treasured find.
According to the Pringle's
pamphlet, it took 10 years to
develop the product. The name
was chosen because it met these
criteria determined by Procter 'n
Gamble's "marketing experts":
"cheerfulness, gaiety and a hint
of nostalgia."
The pamphlet also boasts of the
name's "alliterative qualities
when linked to 'potato chips' and
'Procter & Gamble."' As well,
Pringle's packaging "provides
space-saving convenience."
The potatoes used for
preservative-free Pringle's are
Russet Burbanks and Norgolds —
from Idaho, Washington, Oregon
and Nevada. The potatoes are
dried and formed into a "smooth
potato dough" before being cut
into shape and fried.
Now, don't you have "a fever
for the flavor of new Pringle's"?
Until next week, the Bug has
spoken.
As always, the Bug hopes his
column will inspire many of you
underachievers to get out there
and change the world. And thus
the Bug offers this aphorism,
courtesy of renowned mystic
Spike McKelvy: "Mediocrity with
Ease, Excellence with Shame."

Dear Bug,
Recently, I have seen a lot of
commercials for Pringle's potato
chips. It seems that they are ex
periencing some kind of renais
sance. Could you check it out?
— Barney Fife
Well, Barn', you've brought up
a very interesting subject.
Pringle's is indeed experiencing a
renaissance after many years as
chief resident of the Potato Chip
Hall of Doldrums.
I remember Pringle's growing
quite popular during my high
school years. If memory serves (in
this case perhaps a double fault)
I capitalized on every opportunity
I had in 10th grade to take stacks
of 10 to 15 Pringle's and stuff
'em in my mouth. The other great
thing about Pringle's was that my
10-year-old sister cut her hand
everytime she opened up a new
vacuum-packed canister.
At the time, I also believed that
Pringle's were something new
fangled. Indeed, they can be con
sidered an epitomization of
modern America's gravitation
towards conformity, thinness and

According to its creators, the name
Pringle's was chosen because it has
'alliterative qualities when linked to
'potato chips' and 'Procter & Gamble."

nostalgia, all of which are repre
sented by Pringle's packaging.
Well, it ends up that Pringle's
were introduced to the super
market shelves not in the late
'70s, but in 1968! This, among
other information, was discovered
thanks to a Pringle's pamphlet
procured by the Bug from the
product's mother company, Proc
ter and Gamble.
The good ol' P&G origins of
Pringle's explain why they leave
a subtle disinfectant aftertaste. It
also explains why certain sham
poos, rather than curing my
dandruff, leave a residue of potato
chip flakes.
The pamphlet listed nine vari
eties of Pringle's and their corre
sponding canister colors: 1) Reg
ular Pringle's (red), 2) Cheez-Ums
(orange), 3) Sour Cream 'n Onion
(green), 4) Pringle's Light (silver),
5) Light Ranch (silver 'n blue), 6)
Light B-B-Q (silver 'n bronze), 7)
Idaho Rippled Original (blue), 8)
Idaho Rippled French Onion
(green 'n blue), and 9) Idaho
Rippled Taco 'n Cheddar (tan 'n
blue).

According to the Bug's inside
source at Procter 'n Gamble, Not
really-that-Deep-but-by-no-
means-Shallow Throat, these new
flavors are now in production for
release within the year: 1) Fresh
Cream 'n Onion (puce canister),
2) Pringle's Light Ponderosa
(sepia), 3) Idaho Crinkle-Cut
Original (off-grey), 3V2) Idaho
Nooks 'n Crannies Original (phan
tasmagoric purple), and 4) Idaho
Rippled French Bread 'n Brie (no
canister).
The pamphlet's brief historical
sketch of Pringle's confirms the
Bug's ingenious postulation that
Pringle's epitomizes modern
America. The pamphlet reads,
"Pringle's were developed to over
come the most important con
cerns consumers have about
potato chips in bags. Through
market research, we found con
sumers wanted fresh, crisp,
delicious-tasting potato chips of
uniform size and quality and
fewer broken chips."
While it's not surprising that
consumers wanted "delicious-

tasting" chips, it is sad commen
tary that "uniform size and
quality" were found to be desir
able.
A nice half-filled bag o' Wise
potato chips can be a day of fun
for the apparently unconventional
consumer who enjoys studying the
different shapes, sizes, bubbles
and colors of pre-Pringle's potato
chips. But long gone is the era
when a mutant, charcoal-flavored
Wise chip was considered a
treasured find.
According to the Pringle's
pamphlet, it took 10 years to
develop the product. The name
was chosen because it met these
criteria determined by Procter 'n
Gamble's "marketing experts":
"cheerfulness, gaiety and a hint
of nostalgia."
The pamphlet also boasts of the
name's "alliterative qualities
when linked to 'potato chips' and
'Procter & Gamble."' As well,
Pringle's packaging "provides
space-saving convenience."
The potatoes used for
preservative-free Pringle's are
Russet Burbanks and Norgolds —
from Idaho, Washington, Oregon
and Nevada. The potatoes are
dried and formed into a "smooth
potato dough" before being cut
into shape and fried.
Now, don't you have "a fever
for the flavor of new Pringle's"?
Until next week, the Bug has
spoken.
As always, the Bug hopes his
column will inspire many of you
underachievers to get out there
and change the world. And thus
the Bug offers this aphorism,
courtesy of renowned mystic
Spike McKelvy: "Mediocrity with
Ease, Excellence with Shame."
Dear Bug,
Why didn't Albert Einstein
comb his hair?
— Anselm Kiefer
Albert Einstein was a genius.
More specifically, he was a mad
genius — in two senses. In the
first, Einstein was obviously mad
because he spent all his life doing
ph , ysi ?u
In the second, Einstein was
I mad because his college
,stole the irreplaceable vanity mir
ror and grooming kit that his par
ents had given him as a high school
graduation present.
These two facts are manifest in
his zany hairstyle which has come
to be quasimetonymic in the
caricature of scientists, whatever
that means.
Biographer Ronald Clark says
in his introduction to "Einstein:
The Life and Times" that the

physicist's "aureole of white hair"
helped enlarge him "into the Del
phic oracle" in the last years of
his life. The Bug's not sure what
this means, either, but we are
dealing with a genius so . . .
Clark's 718-page book was
quickly skimmed (as opposed to

Einstein certainly
thought one's coif
fure was vastly
overrated if it were
considered for
more than a mil
lisecond.

slowly skimmed) by the Bug and
from that skimming the Bug was
able to infer the cream of the
reasoning Einstein probably used
when he woke up in the morning
And decided his 'hair needed no
pppiping.
Einstein considered the Earth
to be insignificant in the big
picture scheme of things. Certain
ly, one's coiffure was vastly over
rated if it were considered for
more than a millisecond.
Various out-of-context quotes
support this. Bertrand Russell
said about Einstein: "Personal
matters never occupied more than
odd nooks and crannies in his
thoughts."

Clark also relates a story told
by a man who encountered
Einstein at Oxford: "Einstein had
a faraway look and was asked,
'Dr. Einstein, do tell me what are
you thinking?' 'I am thinking
that, after all, this is a very small
star."'
Dr. Chaim Tschernowitz, whose
name, incidentally, has never been
correctly spelled, has credited
Einstein with this inherently
suspect wisdom: "We know noth
ing about it all. Our knowledge
is but the knowledge of school
children."
Now that the Bug has estab
lished infallible support for the
basic Theory of Insignificance by
which Einstein conducted himself,
he will propose the ramifications
of such a philosophy.

Eiryatoin worked lqng anc} hard
all his life in science class or doing

sonally, if the Bug believed he was
an insignificant mite among mil
lions (or, for that matter, any
thing less than the greatest
human being/insect in the history
of the universe) he certainly
would not spend his insignificant
life doing math.
