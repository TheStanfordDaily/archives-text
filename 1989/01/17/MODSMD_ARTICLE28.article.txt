# Going through Einstein and Pringle's with a fine-toothed comb

As always, the Bug hopes his
column will inspire many of you
underachievers to get out there
and change the world. And thus
the Bug offers this aphorism,
courtesy of renowned mystic
Spike McKelvy: "Mediocrity with
Ease, Excellence with Shame."
Dear Bug,
Why didn't Albert Einstein
comb his hair?
— Anselm Kiefer
Albert Einstein was a genius.
More specifically, he was a mad
genius — in two senses. In the
first, Einstein was obviously mad
because he spent all his life doing
ph , ysi ?u
In the second, Einstein was
I mad because his college
,stole the irreplaceable vanity mir
ror and grooming kit that his par
ents had given him as a high school
graduation present.
These two facts are manifest in
his zany hairstyle which has come
to be quasimetonymic in the
caricature of scientists, whatever
that means.
Biographer Ronald Clark says
in his introduction to "Einstein:
The Life and Times" that the

physicist's "aureole of white hair"
helped enlarge him "into the Del
phic oracle" in the last years of
his life. The Bug's not sure what
this means, either, but we are
dealing with a genius so . . .
Clark's 718-page book was
quickly skimmed (as opposed to

Einstein certainly
thought one's coif
fure was vastly
overrated if it were
considered for
more than a mil
lisecond.

slowly skimmed) by the Bug and
from that skimming the Bug was
able to infer the cream of the
reasoning Einstein probably used
when he woke up in the morning
And decided his 'hair needed no
pppiping.
Einstein considered the Earth
to be insignificant in the big
picture scheme of things. Certain
ly, one's coiffure was vastly over
rated if it were considered for
more than a millisecond.
Various out-of-context quotes
support this. Bertrand Russell
said about Einstein: "Personal
matters never occupied more than
odd nooks and crannies in his
thoughts."

Clark also relates a story told
by a man who encountered
Einstein at Oxford: "Einstein had
a faraway look and was asked,
'Dr. Einstein, do tell me what are
you thinking?' 'I am thinking
that, after all, this is a very small
star."'
Dr. Chaim Tschernowitz, whose
name, incidentally, has never been
correctly spelled, has credited
Einstein with this inherently
suspect wisdom: "We know noth
ing about it all. Our knowledge
is but the knowledge of school
children."
Now that the Bug has estab
lished infallible support for the
basic Theory of Insignificance by
which Einstein conducted himself,
he will propose the ramifications
of such a philosophy.
cited aj&ove,
Eiryatoin worked lqng anc} hard
all his life in science class or doing
science homework and this indis
putably proves he was mad. Per
sonally, if the Bug believed he was
an insignificant mite among mil
lions (or, for that matter, any
thing less than the greatest
human being/insect in the history
of the universe) he certainly
would not spend his insignificant
life doing math.
I mean if A 1 was crazy enough

and confident enough to ignore
his split ends and flyaway tufts,
what was he doing hanging out
with nerds?
Actually, Einstein's hair wasn't
always that unruly. He just had
a lot of it. What he needed was
some good relaxing agent, or an
iron, to sorta flatten things out a
little. Clark's book has a pretty
nifty picture section and the Bug
now outlines the progress of Dr.
Albert Einstein's 'do:
1879-1881 — no hair to speak
of . . . 1881-1900 — often shaves

but fairly well controlled, looks
like Ted Danson without the
eyebrows ... 1921 — first visit
to United States; photograph with
President Harding shows some
seriously unkempt hair; resem

1922-1955 — Einstein still
refuses to buy a new vanity mirror
and grooming kit, his hair just
gets messier and messier; inspires
the young Phyllis Diller; 1939 —
