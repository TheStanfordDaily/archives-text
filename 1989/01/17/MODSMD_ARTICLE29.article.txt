## Whoosh! Tables turned: Cardinal's gale-force attack blows Hurricanes out of town, 93-59

It's come this far. The Maples
Pavilion crowd is chanting
"Boring, boring," during a Stan
ford men's basketball blowout.

Men's Basketball
Cardinal 93, Hurricanes 59

But for any of you 7,330 fans
who might have dozed off during
the ennui of last night's 93-59
steamroll over Miami (Fla.), Stan
ford showed that there's more to
Cardinal basketball than Todd
Lichti, and also gave the Associ
ated Press a thing or to to chew
on.
Stanford (13-3 and winner of
eight straight games) put the
Hurricanes to bed with a 56-29,
74.2 percent-shooting second half,
the latest in a string of second
half smashes, despite a sub-par
performance by Lichti, who went
into the game as the Pacific 10
Conference's leading scorer at
21.7 points per game.
Lichti scored 12 points on 4-
for-11 shooting, but as no miracle
was needed last night, he really
wasn't missed. And of course,
scoring your 2,000 th career point
(actually 2,001, on his first basket
of the night, a 3-pointer) and tying
your school record for consecutive
free throws made (35) isn't a bad
night either.
Turning to the AP, this same
Miami team, which fell to 10-7,
was fresh off an one-point win
over then No. 16 Kansas. But in
the latest AP poll released yester
day, Kansas only dropped to No.
17. No. 19 Georgia Tech and No.
20 Providence also lost last week
end. But Stanford, ranked. 21st
going into last week, moved up
only one spot, to No. 20.
Fortunately, since the common
feeling going around the team is
that if it keeps on winning, the
rest will take care of itself.
"Our goal is to win the confer
ence," senior center Eric Reveno
said. "[That has] nothing to do
with where we are ranked."

Even though this was a non
conference game, the momentum
going into Thursday's game at
California probably doesn't hurt.
Stanford trailed 9-3 with 16:57
to go in the first half and only
led 37-30 at halftime as it shot
only 37.5 percent from the field.
But despite the fact that Stan
ford hadn't hinted that such a
sizeable rout was to follow, there
were clear signs that the Cardinal
was in the driver's seat. The first
of those came with 14:01 to go in
the half.
Miami guard Kevin Presto fired
up an errant 3-pointer. Reveno
grabbed the rebound and made
the quick outlet to Stanford point
guard Terry Taylor.
Taylor then swung the ball
down to forward Howard Wright,
who began his takeoff over at San
Francisco International Airport,
flew into the air, and came down
with a hellish power jam.
With the crowd roar that trailed
Wright's engines, you wuld have
thought you were in the Carrier
Dome.
"They've really got it cooking
in there," Miami Coach Bill Foster
said. "Eight years ago you could
have shot a cannon in [Maples]
and never hit anybody."
Still, though Wright ended the
half 2-for-2 on dunks, he was 0-
for-8 on the rest of his shots.
There was still some flying and
firing to be done.
That came in a hurry in the
second half. Wright scored the
first 11 points the second half in
a space of 3:36. The 6-foot-8
senior's teammates then caught
the fire, and the lead began to
skyrocket: 58-44 with 13:12 left,
71-51 with 8:42 left, and 89-59
with 1:16 left.
By this time, Wright had long
since retired with a perfect 7-for-7
second half, 21 points and eight
rebounds. He also injured a liga
ment in his left hand. The hand
was swollen and precautionary X
rays will be taken, but the injury
is not believed serious.

and more Cardinal players got
into the act. Freshman Adam
Keefe got 16 points and eight
boards. Senior Scott Meinert
picked up a team-high five assists.
Perhaps no one had a bigger

game than forward Bryan
McSweeney. A starter as the
season opened, McSweeney has
been nagged by a knee injury and
has seen his points-per-game
average drop to 1.8.
But last night, McSweeney shot
4-for-4 and got a season-high nine
points, a big boost for the team
and himself.
