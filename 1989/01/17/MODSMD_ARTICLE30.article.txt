# Wright & Co. dominate inside

### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery is a strong proponent of
the Philosophy of Power Basket
ball.
A key tenet of his credo is to
set the big guys up in the low
post, get them the ball and let
them take it from there. It's a
philosophy that results in a lot of
high-percentage shots — and a lot
of wins.
On this year's Stanford squad,
the big guys are Howard Wright,
Eric Reveno and Adam Keefe.
And, last night, the Cardinal
played Power Basketball in
downing the Miami Hurricanes,
93-59, at Maples Pavilion.
As has been the case lately,
Stanford came out somewhat
slowly in the first half. At the
intermission, the Canes were only
down by seven.
Still, the home team established
the inside game early. Keefe, the
6-foot-9 freshman whose court
smarts and dominating play make
him seem more like a senior,
scored 10 points in the opening
period. Keefe was 3-of-4 from
from the field and 4-of-6 from the
free-throw line.
Once again, Keefe owned the
offensive glass. He grabbed six of
fensive rebounds and eight total.
Keefe also tallied 16 points.
Montgomery acknowledged, al
beit in an understated way,
Keefe's prowess on the offensive
end, "I tell ya, he's a tough re
bounder."
For his own part, Keefe simply
said "I'm just trying to read when
I think the shot's going to be and
go for the board."
Keefe's efforts were key as the
Cardinal built a 37-30 lead despite
shooting only 38 percent from the
field. In the second half, though,
the team nearly doubled that (74
percent) and the seniors took over.
Wright shook off a dismal 2-for
-10 shooting performance in the
first half, as well as a case of the
flu which affected him over the
weekend, as he poured in 16
points in the final 20 minutes on
7-of-7 shooting.

Displaying a dazzling array of
open court moves, slam dunks and
double-pumping hesitation
layups, Wright scored Stanford's
first 11 points of the second half
as the Cardinal opened it up en
route to yet another blowout.
Reveno chipped in his share as
well. Stanford's starting center
was good for 16 points on the
night, eight in the second stanza.
