# Move over Krystle and Blake, the Cardinal has its own dynasties
## 
### 
Yes, the end of January is quickly
approaching, which means that
springtime is imminent here on the
Farm. That means talk of suntans and
talk of dynasties.

In a world where the Super Bowl
Champion regularly misses the playoffs
the following season, Stanford sports has
two potential dynasties in the making:
baseball and women's tennis. At least one
should add to Stanford's streak of at least

one NCAA championship every year since
1979.
Women's tennis has won three of the
11 NCAA titles Stanford has garnered
in the last three school years. Its back
to-back-to-back crowns are already an un
precedented feat in NCAA women's tennis
history. When it opens this season on
Feb. 2, the Cardinal will be looking to
place itself on the level of the 1960s
UCLA Bruins as what would eventually
be looked back upon as the greatest col
legiate team in its sport of this century.
■ /! vidently, the question for Stanford
W this season seeins not to be
1 J whether it will lose any matches
this season, but rather whether it will
lose any sets.
The team's only losses to graduation
are Kay Tittle and Cari Hagey. Both were
probably better noted for their gritty
performances than their won-loss
records, but the fact remains that each
perennially played key roles in the Car

dinal's national titles.
Will they be missed? Well, North
Carolina probably misses James Worthy
and Michael Jordan. But somehow they
have managed to keep rolling on.
Stanford will not just roll on without
Tittle and Hagey, it will roll on, over and
through anyone that invades the
renovated Stanford Tennis Stadium.
Stanford returns senior Eleni Rossides
and Cindy Buchsbaum, junior Lisa Green,
sophomores Sandra Birch, Tami Whit
linger and Teri Whitlinger. It also brings
in another talented freshman class,
headed by Debbie Graham, who had a
big fall preseason.
Any of those seven, with the possible
exception of Buchsbaum, could play No.
1 singles for 99 percent of this nation's
colleges, and Buchsbaum is hardly
chopped liver (or any kind of liver, for
that matter). The idea that one of them
will be playing at the No. 6 slot in Stan
ford's lineup is absolutely mind-boggling.

College tennis matches consist of six
singles matches, followed by three dou
bles matches. They are often called once
a team's players have won the five
matches needed to clinch a team victory.
That means Stanford theoretically
might not even be required to play dou
bles until the NCAA tournament in May,
if ever.
Stanford baseball goes into its opener
Jan. 27 at Santa Clara coming off
relatively meager back-to-back
titles. Last year's championship, though
well-earned, was highly improbable, as
Stanford played eight games where a loss
would have eliminated them from
postseason play, and had to defeat several
teams that had run roughshod over the
Cardinal during the regular season.
In addition, Stanford lost four key
starters from last year's champions: third
baseman Ed Sprague, first baseman Ron
Witmeyer, catcher Doug Robbins, and
starting pitcher Lee Plemel. All have

signed professional baseball contracts.
But the biggest loss that could stand
in the way of a third-straight title is of
a player Stanford never really had. That's
Steve Avery, a pitcher who came out of
high school last year as one of the most
highly-recruited players in the nation.
Avery had tentatively committed to
Stanford, and would have been the sole
lefthander in possibly the nation's best
starting rotation, along with Mike Mus
sina and Stan Spencer, two of the nation's
best collegiate freshmen.
Baseball America, which ranked Stan
ford 12th in its 1989 preseason poll, fig
ures Avery's presence would have moved
up Stanford at least a couple of notches.
"He's one of the few players who could
step in and make an impact in the Pac-10
his first year," said Baseball America
editor Allan Simpson.

But then the Atlanta Braves or
ganization drafted him on the
first round, and dangled a six
figure signing bonus (not counting
the contract itself) to get him to
sigv
tanford's loss was certainly
Braves' gain. Pitching
for Pulaski in the Class A
Appalachian League, Avery went
7-1 with a 1.50 ERA, striking out
80 and walking just 19 in 66 in
nings. That averages to 10.9
strikeouts and 2.5 walks per nine
innings.
But Stanford is ranked No. 1
by the other major collegiate
baseball poll, that of ESPN/Col
legiate Baseball, and still has a
good shot at becoming the second
greatest collegiate baseball
dynasty ever. Only USC, which
won five straight College World
Series from 1970-74, has ever won

more than two-straight NCAA
titles.
First of all, Mussina and Spen
cer come back with a year's ex
perience under their belts.
Simpson said that if you look at
both pitchers as they were when
they left high school, Mussina,
who was offered $300,000 by the
Baltimore Orioles, was actually a
more developed pitcher than
Avery
Reliever Steve Chitren, who
once again peaked in the playoffs,
and starters at five every-day po
sitions (Frank Carey, Troy Paul
sen, Paul Carey, Eric DeGraw and
Brian Johnson) also return, and
others are ready to step in at the
other three slots.
And above all, Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess can put his gold
medal from the 1988 Summer
Olympics safely away and con
tinue making his claim as the na
tion's best field manager.

will be playing at the No. 6 slot in Stan
ford's lineup is absolutely mind-boggling.

College tennis matches consist of six
singles matches, followed by three dou
bles matches. They are often called once
a team's players have won the five
matches needed to clinch a team victory.
That means Stanford theoretically
might not even be required to play dou
bles until the NCAA tournament in May,
if ever.
Stanford baseball goes into its opener
Jan. 27 at Santa Clara coming off
relatively meager back-to-back
titles. Last year's championship, though
well-earned, was highly improbable, as
Stanford played eight games where a loss
would have eliminated them from
postseason play, and had to defeat several
teams that had run roughshod over the
Cardinal during the regular season.
In addition, Stanford lost four key
starters from last year's champions: third
baseman Ed Sprague, first baseman Ron
Witmeyer, catcher Doug Robbins, and
starting pitcher Lee Plemel. All have

signed professional baseball contracts.
But the biggest loss that could stand
in the way of a third-straight title is of
a player Stanford never really had. That's
Steve Avery, a pitcher who came out of
high school last year as one of the most
highly-recruited players in the nation.
Avery had tentatively committed to
Stanford, and would have been the sole
lefthander in possibly the nation's best
starting rotation, along with Mike Mus
sina and Stan Spencer, two of the nation's
best collegiate freshmen.
Baseball America, which ranked Stan
ford 12th in its 1989 preseason poll, fig
ures Avery's presence would have moved
up Stanford at least a couple of notches.
"He's one of the few players who could
step in and make an impact in the Pac-10
his first year," said Baseball America
editor Allan Simpson.

But then the Atlanta Braves or
ganization drafted him on the
first round, and dangled a six
figure signing bonus (not counting
the contract itself) to get him to
sigv
tanford's loss was certainly
Braves' gain. Pitching
for Pulaski in the Class A
Appalachian League, Avery went
7-1 with a 1.50 ERA, striking out
80 and walking just 19 in 66 in
nings. That averages to 10.9
strikeouts and 2.5 walks per nine
innings.
But Stanford is ranked No. 1
by the other major collegiate
baseball poll, that of ESPN/Col
legiate Baseball, and still has a
good shot at becoming the second
greatest collegiate baseball
dynasty ever. Only USC, which
won five straight College World
Series from 1970-74, has ever won

more than two-straight NCAA
titles.
First of all, Mussina and Spen
cer come back with a year's ex
perience under their belts.
Simpson said that if you look at
both pitchers as they were when
they left high school, Mussina,
who was offered $300,000 by the
Baltimore Orioles, was actually a
more developed pitcher than
Avery
Reliever Steve Chitren, who
once again peaked in the playoffs,
and starters at five every-day po
sitions (Frank Carey, Troy Paul
sen, Paul Carey, Eric DeGraw and
Brian Johnson) also return, and
others are ready to step in at the
other three slots.
And above all, Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess can put his gold
medal from the 1988 Summer
Olympics safely away and con
tinue making his claim as the na
tion's best field manager.

Yes, the end of January is quickly
approaching, which means that
springtime is imminent here on the
Farm. That means talk of suntans and
talk of dynasties.

In a world where the Super Bowl
Champion regularly misses the playoffs
the following season, Stanford sports has
two potential dynasties in the making:
baseball and women's tennis. At least one
should add to Stanford's streak of at least

one NCAA championship every year since
1979.
Women's tennis has won three of the
11 NCAA titles Stanford has garnered
in the last three school years. Its back
to-back-to-back crowns are already an un
precedented feat in NCAA women's tennis
history. When it opens this season on
Feb. 2, the Cardinal will be looking to
place itself on the level of the 1960s
UCLA Bruins as what would eventually
be looked back upon as the greatest col
legiate team in its sport of this century.
■ /! vidently, the question for Stanford
W this season seeins not to be
1 J whether it will lose any matches
this season, but rather whether it will
lose any sets.
The team's only losses to graduation
are Kay Tittle and Cari Hagey. Both were
probably better noted for their gritty
performances than their won-loss
records, but the fact remains that each
perennially played key roles in the Car

dinal's national titles.
Will they be missed? Well, North
Carolina probably misses James Worthy
and Michael Jordan. But somehow they
have managed to keep rolling on.
Stanford will not just roll on without
Tittle and Hagey, it will roll on, over and
through anyone that invades the
renovated Stanford Tennis Stadium.
Stanford returns senior Eleni Rossides
and Cindy Buchsbaum, junior Lisa Green,
sophomores Sandra Birch, Tami Whit
linger and Teri Whitlinger. It also brings
in another talented freshman class,
headed by Debbie Graham, who had a
big fall preseason.
Any of those seven, with the possible
exception of Buchsbaum, could play No.
1 singles for 99 percent of this nation's
colleges, and Buchsbaum is hardly
chopped liver (or any kind of liver, for
that matter). The idea that one of them
will be playing at the No. 6 slot in Stan
ford's lineup is absolutely mind-boggling.
