# Green names 5 assistants
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Although he has been on the
job for less than two weeks, Den
nis Green has already taken
charge. Green, the newly
appointed football coach, named
five assistant coaches Saturday.
Three of the coaches, Dick Man
ning Jack Gilmete and Chris
Foerster, were members of Jack
Elway's staff. The two new
coaches are Tyrone Willingham of
Rice University and Ron Turner
of Texas A&M.
"This is a great start," Green
said. "I'm very pleased with the
quality and experience of this
group of coaches."
Mannini, the defensive coordi
nator for the Cardinal the past
five years, has been hired as the
inside linebackers coach. Mannini
has doubled as the defensive line
coach the past three seasons, and
Ray Huckestein and Lester
Archmbeau have gone on to
receive all-conference honors un
der his tutelege.
Mannini was the only Stanford
assistant who was considered for
the head coaching position.
Gilmete is the only Stanford
graduate named to the staff so
far. A walk-on inside linebacker,
his work ethic and special-teams
play earned him a starting spot
in 1985. He finished second on
the team in tackles that season
and joined the Cardinal coaching
staff the following year as the out
side linebackers coach, the role he

will continue under Green.
All the Cardinal's top outside
linebackers will return in 1989,
including junior Rob Hinckley, a
second-team All-American accord
ing to The Sporting News.
"Gilmete is a young coach with
an outstanding future," Green
said. "I'm pleased he is in the
coaching profession. He has and
will make an outstanding contri
bution to this team."
Foerster was the newest mem
ber of Elway's staff, having been
hired before last season. He will
continue in the role of assistant
offensive line coach. He played for
Colorado State, where he was an
assistant between his graduation
in 1983 and his hiring at Stanford.
Willingham will become the
running backs coach here. A walk
on who was a three-year letter
man in both football and baseball
at Michigan State, he earned the
Big Ten Conference Medal of
Honor for Outstanding Scholar-
Athletes in 1977. He has coached
at Central Michigan, MSU, North
Carolina State and Rice in his
11-year career.
Turner, a 1977 graduate of
Pacific in nearby Stockton, Calif.,
will become Green's receivers
coach. He has coached quarter
backs and receivers at Arizona,
Northwestern, Pittsburgh, USC
and Texas A&M.
Green has announced he will
hire four more assistants. No
timetable has been set, however.
