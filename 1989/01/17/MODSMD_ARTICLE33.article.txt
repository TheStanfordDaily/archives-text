# Women's hoops climbs to top of conference

### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
In the most important homes
tand of the season, reserve for
ward Evon Asforis stole the show.
Snatching five steals and 14
rebounds for the weekend, Asforis
sparked the strongest back-to
back showing this year for the
Stanford women's basketball
team as the squad soared past
Washington State 89-60 Friday
night and Washington 72-60 on
Saturday to seize sole possession
of the Pacific 10 Conference lead.

Women's Basketball
Cardinal 89, Cougars 60

The Cardinal, holding strong at
the No. 7 spot on last week's As
sociated Press poll, now boasts a
perfect 4-0 league record and 12-2
overall, with the sole losses at the
hands of top-20 teams.
The Cougars fall to 8-6, 1-2 in
the Pac-10, after a Saturday night
loss at California. With a close
58-55 win over the Golden Bears
on Friday preceding the Stanford
defeat, the Huskies are 10-6, 3-1.
The Stanford highlight film fes
tival began Friday night. Though
fueled by All-Pac-10 forward
Jonni Gray, the Cougars posed
little problem for the Cardinal and

were ripped apart by the Stanford
press.
With Asforis at the forefront
and pickpocket guards Jennifer
Azzi and Sonja Henning on the
flanks, the Cardinal robbed the
visitors blind with an astounding
18 team steals. The constant
thievery put the Cougar offense
in disarray, giving the host a com
fortable win.
"I felt we had our press going,
and that hurt them," Stanford
Coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"They could not handle pressure,
and Jennifer got steals and Evon
did really well with the press."
Stanford did relatively well on
half-court defense as well. Gray
notched a game-high 22 points,
but the remainder of the Cougar
squad remained relatively ineffec
tive.
Gray's complements, Angie
Weir-Miller and freshman
phenom Kristal Stahl, were held
to a paltry 17 combined points,
and the squad as a whole mus
tered a mere 33 percent shooting
from the field.
"We knew from the beginning
that the standing report was that
they were a good perimeter shoot
ing team," Asforis said. "We tried
to get up on them and take away
their shot and make them drive
where we would have help. We
made our defense work for us."
For the Cardinal, however, real
strength stemmed from an offen
sive explosion at every position
on the depth chart. Azzi led all
Stanford scorers with 15, with
three ofT-the-bench players (As
foris, Julie Zeilstra and Celeste
Lavoie) also finishing in double
figures. For the game, Stanford
shot a respectable 52 percent as
it found the holes in the WSU
defense.
One player, however, seemingly
saved a little for the Saturday
night showdown. Starting forward
Trisha Stevens scored a mere four
points in 16 minutes of play and
lacked her characteristic offensive
spark.
"Trisha's due for a good game
— I'm sure she'll do better," Van-
Derveer predicted after the Wash
ington State game.

Against Washington, Stevens
made her coach seem prophetic.
On the court for 31 minutes, the
sophomore added 18 points and
seven rebounds to the team effort
to pull the Cardinal past the
Huskies after a first-half deficit.
The opening period was as close
as could be, with neither team
able to secure an advantage larger
than three. A 14-foot jumper by
Husky guard Jacki Myers with
1:49 left in the half gave the
Huskies a 34-32 margin heading
into the locker room.
The second stanza, however,
was no contest. While Washington
maintained its efficient and con
servative defense-oriented play,
the Cardinal smoothed out the
rough edges and improved its
passing game to win by 12 at the
buzzer.
But defense proved to be the
real key to victory. Although for
ward Traci Thirdgill continued to
shoot unconsciously in the second
half, the Cardinal did an admira
ble job of pressuring the pressure

oriented Huskies and denying the
visitors clear shots at the hoop.
"I think the biggest thing is
that we played well together in
the second half," Azzi said. "In
the first half, certain people had
little spurts and plays here and
there, but it didn't feel like we
were playing well together.
"But in the second half, I think
it was the best chemistry I felt
since I've been here. I think that
was the key."
While the cohesiveness and
tenacity of the Cardinal defenders
may have surprised the Huskies,
Washington never deviated from
its standard game plan. Like last
season, Washington relied on its
quick, unrelenting defense to ease
the burden of an unexceptional
offense, but could not counter the
running and gunning of the Stan
ford offense.
"There were no surprises in
that game, none," VanDerveer
said. "It was meat and potatoes:
they played pressure-man, they

got up on people. I just don't think
they did as good a job executing
their offense."
With four of the five starters
notching 14 points or better, Van-
Derveer could only be pleased
with her team. The Cardinal made
31-of-53 from the field and 7-for
-10 from the line, including a 2-of-3
3-point performance from Azzi
and a 1-for-l trey by Henning at
4:30 that distanced the Cardinal
for good.
With the win, Stanford returns
to the Pac-10 pinnacle in earnest
after slipping in the final weekend
of last season. Next month's
rematch at Seattle may well de
termine the conference crown, but
VanDerveer is uncharacteristi
cally optimistic.
"They will be so sky-high when
we go up there," VanDerveer said.
"I think this is the year that we
can do it — I think we can go up
there and take them. We have a
lot of work to do until then, but
if we play with a lot of confidence
we can go up there and do it."
