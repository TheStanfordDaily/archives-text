In the most important homes
tand of the season, reserve for
ward Evon Asforis stole the show.
Snatching five steals and 14
rebounds for the weekend, Asforis
sparked the strongest back-to
back showing this year for the
Stanford women's basketball
team as the squad soared past
Washington State 89-60 Friday
night and Washington 72-60 on
Saturday to seize sole possession
of the Pacific 10 Conference lead.

Cardinal 89, Cougars 60

The Cardinal, holding strong at
the No. 7 spot on last week's As
sociated Press poll, now boasts a
perfect 4-0 league record and 12-2
overall, with the sole losses at the
hands of top-20 teams.
The Cougars fall to 8-6, 1-2 in
the Pac-10, after a Saturday night
loss at California. With a close
58-55 win over the Golden Bears
on Friday preceding the Stanford
defeat, the Huskies are 10-6, 3-1.
The Stanford highlight film fes

fueled by All-Pac-10 forward
Jonni Gray, the Cougars posed
little problem for the Cardinal and

were ripped apart by the Stanford
press.
With Asforis at the forefront
and pickpocket guards Jennifer
Azzi and Sonja Henning on the
flanks, the Cardinal robbed the
visitors blind with an astounding
18 team steals. The constant
thievery put the Cougar offense
in disarray, giving the host a com
fortable win.
"I felt we had our press going,
and that hurt them," Stanford
Coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"They could not handle pressure,
and Jennifer got steals and Evon
did really well with the press."
Stanford did relatively well on
half-court defense as well. Gray
notched a game-high 22 points,
but the remainder of the Cougar
squad remained relatively ineffec
tive.
Gray's complements, Angie
Weir-Miller and freshman
phenom Kristal Stahl, were held
to a paltry 17 combined points,
and the squad as a whole mus
tered a mere 33 percent shooting
from the field.
"We knew from the beginning
that the standing report was that
they were a good perimeter shoot
ing team," Asforis said. "We tried
to get up on them and take away
their shot and make them drive
where we would have help. We
