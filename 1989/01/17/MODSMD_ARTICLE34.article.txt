PULLMAN, Wash. - In clean
ing up in the state of Washington

employed a deluxe Hoover
vacuum.

The Cardinal ran over a Wash
ington State team in disarray,
picking up the first 13 points and
hardly looking back in winning
85-43, its biggest victory in con
ference history.
Finishing off its first sweep in
Apple Country since the 1959-60
season, Stanford eclipsed an 84-48
victory over the Cougars in 1963-
64 and also handed WSU it's
worst loss ever at Friel Court,
before 3,750 disgruntled fans in
snow-covered Pullman. It was
also the Cardinal's seventh
biggest victory ever (three of those
top seven have come this season).
Stanford (12-3, 5-1 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) moved into
sole posession of second place in
the Pac-10, one-half game behind
Arizona.
Senior guard Todd Lichti once
again led Stanford with 21 points
and extended his consecutive free
throw streak to 33, two short of

his school record and seven short
of the Pac-10 record. Freshman
Adam Keefe came off the bench
to provide 13 points and a team
leading eight rebounds.

Cougars in 1963-64
and also handed
WSU it's worst loss
ever at Friel Court.

Senior point guard Terry Taylor
posted 12 on four 3-point shots
along with eight assists, and his
backup, classmate Scott Meinert,
added 11 points.
Stanford's reserves scored 37
to the starters 48 despite playing
56 less minutes, and played a
large role in blowing open the
game from 31-21 at halftime.
"I was having fun, just trying
to build up confidence," said soph-

omore reserve Deshon Wingate,
who had five points, four
rebounds and a great unrecorded
blocked shot in 12 minutes of play.
"It helped a little bit. ... I feel a
little bit more relaxed on the
court."
Said Lichti: "It's fun to sit on
the bench, talk with the guys and
cheer the other guys on, make
sure they're doing the right
things. . .. It's a lot of fun; we
prefer it this way."
It got to be that way right from
the start. WSU's defense was un
believably permissive, leaving
Stanford's capable outside
shooters looking like Dead-eye
Duke in a Disneyland shooting
gallery.
"I was surprised because it
seemed they were sagging down
a lot," Lichti said. "We're a pretty
good perimeter shooting team and
they were leaving us open a lot."
Lichti had eight points on three
jumpers and Taylor added the
first of his 3-pointers and passed
to Howard Wright (seven points)
for another as Stanford led 13-0.
WSU didn't score until senior for
ward Brian Quinnett came off the
bench and sank a 3-pointer with
13:57 left in the half.
Quinnett's 12 first-half points
(he finished with 19) helped bring
the Cougars to within 26-21 with
2:10 left in the half, but with
WSU making no significant ad
justments on defense other than
finally double-teaming Lichti,

Stanford never seemed that
threatened.
And the crowd actually started
to turn against the WSU in the
second-half, exhorting them to
shoot the ball as the Cougars re
mained in their methodical of
fense while Stanford was
drubbing them.
Card notes
Stanford's largest margin of victory
ever was against Duquesne in the
1937-38 campaign, 92-27. In that
game, Stanford's Hank Luisetti set
the single-game school scoring record
of 50 points. Todd Lichti only needs
to break that record and invent a new
shot to put the finishing touches on
his individual career.
Stanford recorded season highs in
3-point field goals made (10) and at
tempted (17).

employed a deluxe Hoover

Carcßnai 85, Cougars 43

The Cardinal ran over a Wash
ington State team in disarray,
picking up the first 13 points and
hardly looking back in winning
85-43, its biggest victory in con
ference history.
Finishing off its first sweep in
Apple Country since the 1959-60
season, Stanford eclipsed an 84-48
victory over the Cougars in 1963-
64 and also handed WSU it's
worst loss ever at Friel Court,
before 3,750 disgruntled fans in
snow-covered Pullman. It was
also the Cardinal's seventh
biggest victory ever (three of those
top seven have come this season).
Stanford (12-3, 5-1 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) moved into
sole posession of second place in
the Pac-10, one-half game behind
Arizona.
Senior guard Todd Lichti once
again led Stanford with 21 points
and extended his consecutive free
throw streak to 33, two short of

his school record and seven short
of the Pac-10 record. Freshman
Adam Keefe came off the bench
to provide 13 points and a team
leading eight rebounds.

and also handed
WSU it's worst loss
ever at Friel Court.

Senior point guard Terry Taylor
posted 12 on four 3-point shots
along with eight assists, and his
backup, classmate Scott Meinert,
added 11 points.
Stanford's reserves scored 37
to the starters 48 despite playing
56 less minutes, and played a
large role in blowing open the
game from 31-21 at halftime.
"I was having fun, just trying
to build up confidence," said soph-

omore reserve Deshon Wingate,
who had five points, four
rebounds and a great unrecorded
blocked shot in 12 minutes of play.
"It helped a little bit. ... I feel a
little bit more relaxed on the
court."
Said Lichti: "It's fun to sit on
the bench, talk with the guys and
cheer the other guys on, make
sure they're doing the right
things. . .. It's a lot of fun; we
prefer it this way."
It got to be that way right from
the start. WSU's defense was un
believably permissive, leaving
Stanford's capable outside
shooters looking like Dead-eye
Duke in a Disneyland shooting
gallery.
"I was surprised because it
seemed they were sagging down
a lot," Lichti said. "We're a pretty
good perimeter shooting team and
they were leaving us open a lot."
Lichti had eight points on three
jumpers and Taylor added the
first of his 3-pointers and passed
to Howard Wright (seven points)
for another as Stanford led 13-0.
WSU didn't score until senior for
ward Brian Quinnett came off the
bench and sank a 3-pointer with
13:57 left in the half.
Quinnett's 12 first-half points
(he finished with 19) helped bring
the Cougars to within 26-21 with
2:10 left in the half, but with
WSU making no significant ad
justments on defense other than
finally double-teaming Lichti,

Stanford never seemed that
threatened.
And the crowd actually started
to turn against the WSU in the
second-half, exhorting them to
shoot the ball as the Cougars re
mained in their methodical of
fense while Stanford was
drubbing them.
Card notes
Stanford's largest margin of victory
ever was against Duquesne in the
1937-38 campaign, 92-27. In that
game, Stanford's Hank Luisetti set
the single-game school scoring record
of 50 points. Todd Lichti only needs
to break that record and invent a new
shot to put the finishing touches on
his individual career.
Stanford recorded season highs in
3-point field goals made (10) and at
tempted (17).
