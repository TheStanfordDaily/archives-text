# Fencers foil weekend opponents
## 
### Doug Boeschen Staff writer 
The opposing forces rushed
into battle with a mighty clash
on Friday afternoon and began
a terrible conflict that lasted
throughout the weekend. Blades
sliced through the air and dealt
many a fatal blow as it became
obvious who would triumph in
the end. But the fight raged on
for three days and the bodies
of the defeated combatants
began to litter the battlefield in
a carnage seldom previously
seen in Roble gym.
0.K., well maybe the result
was not quite as bloody as this,
but the scene of the recent fenc
ing tournament was definitely
colored Cardinal red. On Friday
afternoon the Stanford fencing
teams went undefeated against
UC-Long Beach and Cal State-
Fullerton to improve their
standings in the Western
Region.
In the first ever Stanford Col
legiate Open, held on Saturday
and Sunday, Stanford duelists
fought against over 100 fencers
and emerged with five out of
the 12 trophies presented over
the weekend.

Competing without top foil
fencer Nick Bravin, the Stanford
men's team displayed its depth
of talent with two hard-fought
victories. The saber team of
Mike Cramer, Dave Russ and
Leonard D'Amico was nearly
flawless against Fullerton as the
trio gave up only six touches
out of a possible forty-five. They
were almost as impressive
against Long Beach, and their
only two losses came at the
hands of a defending Western
Regional Champion.
The foil team of Duncan Bell,
Stan Brobston, and Derek Stor
dahl had a tough duel with Long
Beach, but bounced back to al
low only eleven touches against
Fullerton. Not to be outdone in
battle, the epee squad of Peter
Duimstra, Lee Tankersley, and
Steve Schmidt went 5-4 against
Long Beach and 8-1 against
Fullerton.
Also without a top fencer, in
jured Juliet Johnson, the Stan
ford women's team was unstop
pable as it charged to a 13-3
win over Long Beach and a 14-2
trouncing of Fullerton. Against
Long Beach, Elisabeth Spilman,
Tracy Schmidt and Grace Chang

all went undefeated. Against
Fullerton, Spilman and Schmidt
repeated the feat.
The weekend tournament fea
tured varsity as well as physical
education class fencers and the
sounds of battle lasted through
out Saturday and Sunday.
Sabre fighters Mike Cramer
and Dave Russ were deadly as
they felled opponents right and
left en route to first- and second
place trophies respectively.
The epee team was impressive
in its strength and consistency
as Peter Duimstra claimed fifth
place, Lee Tankersley fourth,
and Steve Schmidt third. For
the foil team, Duncan Bell cap
tured seventh and Stan
Brobston fought his way to the
second-place trophy.
On the women's side,
Elisabeth Spilman achieved the
seventh place award, and Tracy
Schmidt showed her skill in an
outstanding third place finish.
Stanford Coaches Zoran Tulum
and Sherry Posthumus were
pleased with the result of the
three days of competition. The
teams now look forward to next
week's match with Santa Cruz
— their main competition in the
Western Region.
