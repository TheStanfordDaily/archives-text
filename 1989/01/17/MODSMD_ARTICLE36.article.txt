# Grapplers take Aggie Invite
## 
### Greg Gottesman Staff writer 
The trophy had already been
handed out. The picture of the
tournament winners had already
been taken. The other teams had
already left. Stanford wrestling
Coach Chris Horpel hadn't, for
good reason.
Chico State thought it finally
had won the "Aggie" Invitational,
finally triumphing over the Car
dinal — thought. After three
recalculations of team point to
tals, however, Stanford — not
Chico — walked home with the
first place trophy. Indeed, for the
third year in a row, Stanford beat
the Wildcats at the Invitational
by less than a point — this past
weekend by a score of 108.50 to
107.75.
"Chico had a demanding lead
throughout the tournament. (The
Wildcats) assumed they were un
catchable. Everything had to go
our way in the end of the tour
nament. That's exactly what hap
pened. Still, Chico thought it had
won. Of course, that wasn't the
case," Horpel said.
Stanford's win was highlighted
by the first-place finishes of soph
omore Steve Buddie (177 lbs.) and

junior Steve Yarbrough (167 lbs.).
In the finals, Buddie deci
sioned Don Zeman, a Division II
ail-American from UC-Davis.
Buddie's victory gave him his sec
ond tournament win; he won the
"Doc Petersen" Open January 7.
It also marked the third time that
the Cardinal wrestler has beaten
Zeman this year.
Yarbrough totally dominated
the tournament, according to Hor
pel. In his first match, he won a
technical decision (a win by 15
points or more). He pinned his
next two opponents, including
Chico State's Mike Bennet in the
finals.
Besides Buddie and Yarbrough,
eight other wrestlers placed in the
top six. Junior Josh Lisle (134
lbs.) wrestled his way to second
place, avenging an earlier tie to
John Nelson of UC-Davis in the
semi finals.
Freshman Dave Nowick (118
lbs.), junior Geoff Baum (150 lbs.),
freshman Mark Graham (167
lbs.), and sophomore Dave
Nahama (Heavyweight) each cap
tured third place.
Freshman Mark Forman (126
lbs.) and junior Trent Smith (190
lbs.) grabbed fourth, while injured
junior superstar Ron Perry (190

lbs.) defaulted into sixth.
"This tournament was espe
cially good for our lightweights.
All of them won matches; all ol
them placed. It really boosted
their confidence. Furthermore,
when you win by three-quarters
of a point, everything in the tour
nament counts. One less victory,
one less pin, one less technical
fall and we wouldn't have won.
So, everyone was responsible for
this win," explained Horpel.
With three starters sidelined
due to injury, Horpel commented
on the experience that many
backup wrestlers are receiving
during the past few weeks. "This
tournament provided valuable ex
perience for some second
stringers, who normally don't get
a chance to wrestle in competi
tion. It's really difficult to know
how good you are when you are
just basing it on what you do in
the practice room. The intensity
is totally different in competi
tion."
He added, "It was a good tour
nament for this time of the year.
We have wrestled a lot so far. The
competition this past weekend
wasn't so stiff that our confidence
was shaken. It wasn't so easy
either. It was just right."
