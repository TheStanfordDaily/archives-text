# East takes 64th Shrine Game
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
The 64th annual East-West
Shrine Game was played at Stan
ford Stadium Sunday, and for the
64th time, the children won.
The East All-Stars defeated the
West All-Stars 24-6 as well, led
by Lewis Tillman, Jerry Olsavsky
and Wes Pritchett. The game,
played yearly at Stanford as a
fundraiser for the crippled and
burned children at 22 Shriners
hospitals nationwide, has now
brought in over 10 million dollars
for the cause.
West Coach Larry Smith of
USC and his team had planned
on winning but, "I think after the
game is over that's forgotten. We
didn't lose; the kids won."
Smith's West squad began well
and after the second of New
Mexico kicker Rick Walsh's two
field goals it was 6-0 and the East
had minus three yards rushing.
The momentum swung in the
second quarter, however, when
Michigan punter Mike Gillette ran
a fake punt 18 yards for a first
down. The East then went on to
score on a one-yard run by Til
lman to take the lead for good.
The play was planned by East
Assistant Coach Jimmy Johnson,
the coach at the University of
Miami. "That was Gillette run
ning as much as anything,"
Johnson said. "We just gave him
the green light to do it."
Smith, whose Trojans faced Gil
lette's Wolverines in the Rose
Bowl, was all too familiar with
that play. "We worried about him

in the Rose Bowl," Smith said.
"He's done that three or four
times this season."
Tillman, a running back who
broke most of Walter Payton's
school records at Jackson State,
was named the offensive player
of the game, the same honor he
received at the Blue-Gray Classic
last month. He ran for 86 yards
on 19 carries Sunday.

( l work half a day as a
magician back in
Pittsburgh so I said
'abracadabra 1 and
they thought I disap
peared.'

"I was really surprised we ran
the ball that much," Tillman said.
"At practice we concentrated on
the pass. But when we started to
run, things started to open up for
me.
"I did the things I could do.
Everything else took care of it
self."
Gillette kicked a 44-yard line
drive wobbler that crept over the
crossbar in the third quarter to
make it 10-6 East while both of
fenses were struggling. In the
fourth quarter the East added to
its lead on a 57-yard drive capped
by a one-yard plunge by Clem
son's Tracy Johnson, then put it

away on the next series.
Erik Wilhelm of Oregon State
directed the West to the East 32
following the kickoff but then had
a pass intercepted by Olsavsky,
an All-America linebacker from
Pittsburgh. Olsavsky then
rumbled 75 yards for the score,
eluding two would-be tacklers at
the five with a few nifty moves
and what he called a "macho
shove."
"That time I just happened to
be in the right spot at the right
time; ran a few yards ..." said
Olsavsky, who finished with 11
tackles. "I work half a day as a
magician back in Pittsburgh so I
said 'abracadabra* and they
thought I disappeared ... I knew
I wasn't too fast so I figured some
one would be behind me."
When asked if he thought the
interception and run-back would
help his standing with the numer
ous professional scouts in attend
ance, Olsavsky, who described his
condition after the run as "very,
very, very tired," said, "I think
they'll be impressed with the
catch and the first ten yards, but
after that I think it might have
hurt me."
The East's coach, Pitt's Mike
Gottfried, disagreed with the
modest Olsavsky. "He's where
he's supposed to be all the time,"
Gottfried said. "It's no accident
he caught that ball."
Olsavsky was overshadowed
defensively, however, by Arkansas
safety Steve Atwater, who had two
interceptions, one pass break-up
and 10 tackles and was named
the defensive player of the game.

Atwater said winning the
award, "felt great, especially con
sidering all the talent that was
out there. It was totally a team
effort, though. I don't think I
deserve all the credit."
Two Stanford players,
noseguard Ray Huckestein and
center Andy Sinclair, also made

their final collegiate appearances
Sunday. "It was a great thrill,"
Sinclair said. "It was a lot of fun
. . . Ray and I had good days so
it was pretty good."
Pritchett, Notre Dame's out
standing linebacker, finished with
a game-high 14 tackles and

finished his season 14-0. The
Fighting Irish went 12-0 and
Pritchett was also on the winning
side in the Hula Bowl last week.
"I ended up the season 14-0,"
he said. "It's a good feeling . . .
What more can you dream for
your senior season?"

Olsavsky was overshadowed
defensively, however, by Arkansas
safety Steve Atwater, who had two
interceptions, one pass break-up
and 10 tackles and was named
the defensive player of the game.

Atwater said winning the
award, "felt great, especially con
sidering all the talent that was
out there. It was totally a team
effort, though. I don't think I
deserve all the credit."
Two Stanford players,
noseguard Ray Huckestein and
center Andy Sinclair, also made

their final collegiate appearances
Sunday. "It was a great thrill,"
Sinclair said. "It was a lot of fun
. . . Ray and I had good days so
it was pretty good."
Pritchett, Notre Dame's out
standing linebacker, finished with
a game-high 14 tackles and

finished his season 14-0. The
Fighting Irish went 12-0 and
Pritchett was also on the winning
side in the Hula Bowl last week.
"I ended up the season 14-0,"
he said. "It's a good feeling . . .
What more can you dream for
your senior season?"

The 64th annual Shrine Game showcased the talents of some of the nation's finest senior college
football players. Proceeds from the game benefit crippled and burned children in 22 Shriners hospitals
nationwide.
The 64th annual East-West
Shrine Game was played at Stan
ford Stadium Sunday, and for the
64th time, the children won.
The East All-Stars defeated the
West All-Stars 24-6 as well, led
by Lewis Tillman, Jerry Olsavsky
and Wes Pritchett. The game,
played yearly at Stanford as a
fundraiser for the crippled and
burned children at 22 Shriners
hospitals nationwide, has now
brought in over 10 million dollars
for the cause.
West Coach Larry Smith of
USC and his team had planned
on winning but, "I think after the
game is over that's forgotten. We
didn't lose; the kids won."
Smith's West squad began well
and after the second of New
Mexico kicker Rick Walsh's two
field goals it was 6-0 and the East
had minus three yards rushing.
The momentum swung in the
second quarter, however, when
Michigan punter Mike Gillette ran
a fake punt 18 yards for a first
down. The East then went on to
score on a one-yard run by Til
lman to take the lead for good.
The play was planned by East
Assistant Coach Jimmy Johnson,
the coach at the University of
Miami. "That was Gillette run
ning as much as anything,"
Johnson said. "We just gave him
the green light to do it."
Smith, whose Trojans faced Gil
lette's Wolverines in the Rose
Bowl, was all too familiar with
that play. "We worried about him

in the Rose Bowl," Smith said.
"He's done that three or four
times this season."
Tillman, a running back who
broke most of Walter Payton's
school records at Jackson State,
was named the offensive player
of the game, the same honor he
received at the Blue-Gray Classic
last month. He ran for 86 yards
on 19 carries Sunday.

( l work half a day as a
magician back in
Pittsburgh so I said
'abracadabra 1 and
they thought I disap
peared.'
— Jerry Olsavsky

"I was really surprised we ran
the ball that much," Tillman said.
"At practice we concentrated on
the pass. But when we started to
run, things started to open up for
me.
"I did the things I could do.
Everything else took care of it
self."
Gillette kicked a 44-yard line
drive wobbler that crept over the
crossbar in the third quarter to
make it 10-6 East while both of
fenses were struggling. In the
fourth quarter the East added to
its lead on a 57-yard drive capped
by a one-yard plunge by Clem
son's Tracy Johnson, then put it

away on the next series.
Erik Wilhelm of Oregon State
directed the West to the East 32
following the kickoff but then had
a pass intercepted by Olsavsky,
an All-America linebacker from
Pittsburgh. Olsavsky then
rumbled 75 yards for the score,
eluding two would-be tacklers at
the five with a few nifty moves
and what he called a "macho
shove."
"That time I just happened to
be in the right spot at the right
time; ran a few yards ..." said
Olsavsky, who finished with 11
tackles. "I work half a day as a
magician back in Pittsburgh so I
said 'abracadabra* and they
thought I disappeared ... I knew
I wasn't too fast so I figured some
one would be behind me."
When asked if he thought the
interception and run-back would
help his standing with the numer
ous professional scouts in attend
ance, Olsavsky, who described his
condition after the run as "very,
very, very tired," said, "I think
they'll be impressed with the
catch and the first ten yards, but
after that I think it might have
hurt me."
The East's coach, Pitt's Mike
Gottfried, disagreed with the
modest Olsavsky. "He's where
he's supposed to be all the time,"
Gottfried said. "It's no accident
he caught that ball."
Olsavsky was overshadowed
defensively, however, by Arkansas
safety Steve Atwater, who had two
interceptions, one pass break-up
and 10 tackles and was named
