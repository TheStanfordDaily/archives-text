# Men's gymnastics wins season opener
## 
### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
Stanford men's gymnastics
opened its season over the week
end with an easy win at the Spar
tan Invitational at San Jose
State. The most significant thing
the gymnasts take away from
the competition, however, is not
a first-place trophy, but an ob
jective report card evaluating
where they stand as more im
portant competitions approach.
"I'm pleased, yes, but I am
not satisfied by any means,"
Cardinal junior Conrad
Voorsanger said. "I am happy
with what everybody's doing and
they're working hard, but we're
not even close to what we have
to do."
"It's the execution and the
consistency that we need,"
Voorsanger continued. "This
meet is fun, and nobody gets in
the frame of mind that they have

to hit no matter what, but that's
what we're going to have to do
if we're going to make it to
NCAAs (in April)."
"Fun" is a relative term, es
pecially as it applies to high-level
gymnastics. What Voorsanger
described as a fun meet con
sisted of competitions Friday
night, Saturday afternoon, and
Saturday night. Although the
pressure of meets later in the
season was not there, some of
the gymnasts still had to work
through as many as 12 routines.
When the chalk dust cleared
after the two days of competi
tion, Stanford had scored 265.25
points. California was a distant
second at 258.15, while UC-
Santa Barbara was third, fol
lowed by San Jose State and Cal
gary.
Gymnasts from the area who
are not members of any of these
teams were allowed to compete,
and it was one of these gym

nasts, high schooler Kyle Asano,
who won the all-around compe
tition. After Friday night's op
tionals round, which puts no
strict requirements on the
routines, Voorsanger was in first
and Cardinal freshman Tim
Ryan was second. Both, however,
had entered the meet with minor
injuries and both chose not to
take the risk of further compe
tition in Saturday's compulsory
round.
Ryan did compete in three of
Saturday night's event finals,
winning the rings and the high
bar. Junior Adam Forman took
second in three events, as well
as second in the all-around com
petition.
Stanford's two seniors, Scott
Schaffer and Andy Ropp, were
both out of the entire competi
tion with injuries. Ropp, with a
mysterious chest cartilage tear,
will probably return to full
strength quickly. Schaffer's foot

injury will keep him out for at
least two weeks.
"We only had five kids on
some events, so considering that
I think we did pretty well," Stan
ford Coach Sadeo Hamada said.
"I definitely see where they are
now, after going through more
than one competition."
The meet gave Hamada an
idea of his gymnasts' progress
to this point, and also of a new
judging system established after
last summer's Olympics. "We'll
probably have to redo their
routines," he said. "If there's
anywhere I can add more diffi
culty, I'd like to add more diffi
culty. And, the other way
around, if someone is throwing
too hard of a routine, then 1
may have to change it."
The Cardinal will have less
practice time than it had origi
nally expected for January. A
new meet has been scheduled at
Santa Barbara in two weeks.
