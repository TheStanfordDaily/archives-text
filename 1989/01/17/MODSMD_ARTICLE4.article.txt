# Kennedy speech criticizes activists who are 'hostile' to science

At the doors to the glittery San Fran
cisco Hilton Hotel ballroom, activists
handed out fliers promoting the use of
alternatives to animals in research Sat
urday. The speech they probably least
wanted to hear was about to be delivered
to the thousands of people streaming in
past them.
University President Donald Kennedy
gave this speech.
Kennedy's keynote address at the
155 th annual meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Sci
ence called for the scientific community
to enter the battle against interest groups
"hostile to American science" — alluding
in particular to animal rights activists.
Kennedy kicked off the week-long con
ference with an address that emphasized

the need to improve the public perception
of scientists and warned researchers not
to "justify, and . . . oversell" science with
unfounded practical applications.
He welcomed participants of the con
ference to San Francisco, and speaking
for the leadership of all the Bay Area
research universities, called the area "the
nation's capital of activist, single-issue,
not-in-my-backyard politics." Assoc. Vice
President for Public Affairs Larry Horton
will speak on this issue and its impact
on universities at the conference today.
A biologist by training, and the former
commissioner of the Food and Drug Ad
ministration and the former chair of the
Human Biology Department, Kennedy
discussed a "paradox" in which American
science, despite "stunning successes," is
"increasingly inhibited by negative public
attitudes."
University of California President Da

vid Gardener, co-chair of the conference,
called Kennedy's speech "insightful and
courageous," because it showered scald
ing criticism on vocal opponents of sci
entific development, particularly those ac
tive at universities such as Stanford and
the University of California.
Following the speech, Kennedy said his
address would provoke "the usual folks"
— such as local animal rights activists,
some of whom were in his audience.

Dozens of animal rights advocates have
staged protests outside the conference
headquarters in downtown San Francisco
since Sunday.
In diplomatic fashion, Kennedy
embraced a wide array of sciences in his
praise for the most vigorous and promis
ing condition of science ever. And he
coralled all scientific fields with his urgent
admonishment to apply scientific work to
the "betterment of the human condition,

. . . because the human condition has
never been in greater need of help in its
history."
Although he described science as "a
humane calling, proffering relief from
suffering and a better world," he said
public mistrust now restrains science
both in funding and philosophy — re
gardless of science's empathetic service
to public needs.
Kennedy called on all scientists to reaf
firm their commitment to the discipline
as a "search for understanding of the
physical world and the nature of living
systems because we share a passion to
know them and to teach them to others."
As a solution to the current scientific
quandary, Kennedy suggested a three
part recipe for sound footing.
First, researchers must set reasonable,


'We owe Senator (Sam) Nunn a large
debt for his recent performance of
liposuction on the defense budget.'
— Donald Kennedy
