Without even leaving their beds, about
250 patients were rolled into Stanford
University Hospital's new wing on Sat
urday, marking the culmination of one
phase of a $153 million expansion and
modernization program.
"It'll be a better place to be a patient,"
Assist. Director of Nursing Joann Zim
merman said of the 440,000 square-foot
wing that has been under construction
for four years.
The original hospital building was
constructed in 1959. The new wing was
officially dedicated in September but is
nnw nnen for use. The move did not

affect the hospital's total number of
beds, which remains at 663. The vacated
rooms in the old wing of the hospital
will be renovated in another phase of
the modernization project, and some of
them will be converted to other uses.
The most notable change in the new
wing is that patients will no longer be
housed in large, ward-like rooms. All
the new rooms are private or semi
private.
In the intensive care unit, where
patients need constant nursing atten
tion, the rooms are now grouped in
"pods" around central nursing stations
so that nurses can see all the beds at
once.
The new intensive care arrangement

is a compromise between the old system
of wards, which was less comfortable
for patients, and a costly system of turn
ing each room into a mini-intensive care
unit, which is difficult to maintain with
today's nursing shortages, said Dr. Mike
Rosenthal, the medical director of in
tensive care. He said that Stanford's
new system represents "the best of both
worlds."
In addition to the extra amenities for
patients, the new wing is expected to
be more comfortable for its staff and
for the patients' families. There are
large lounges for families to wait. Some
rooms will also have fold-down beds for
