# Party unites Greek systems
## Kappa Kappa Gamma holds function with Kappa Alpha Psi 
### DJ Berinstein Staff writer 
Last Thursday night, a party sought to
break down barriers in light of the current
racial tension on the Stanford campus.
Kappa Kappa Gamma, an Intersorority
Council member, and Kappa Alpha Psi, a
fraternity in the Black Greek Letter Sys
tem, had a wine and cheese cocktail party,
marking the first time in Stanford's recent
history that the two different Greek sys
tems had a joint program of a social nature.
"I think it's wonderful," said Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons.
"Any deliberate effort to try to build
bridges of understanding is a good thing,"
Lyons added. "It's no secret that I've been
trying to get the Greek systems to reach
out."
Dean of Fraternal Affairs Joe Pisano was
also in favor of the party, applauding the
Kappas "for looking beyond their own
group and really making an effort," in light
of the problems the Kappas had with Amer
ican Indians on campus.
Last spring, the Kappas had a "Kappas
and Indians Party," unintentionally held in
front of the office of the Stanford American
Indian Organization. The event, at which
some sorority members dressed up as In
dians and danced and sang, offended some
members of SAIO.
The recent party was planned independ
ently of last spring's incident, according to
Pisano and Kappa President Laura Lewis.
Pisano added with a note of pride, "This
[party 1 is a real tribute to both groups. It
seems as if these groups (and the Greek

system) never get credit for the positive
things that they do."
The party was initiated by the Kappas
and was not intended as "a publicity stunt,"
Lewis said. Because of "all the negative
feelings at Stanford now, we thought the
party would be a good way to do something
positive."
Junior Francois Charles of Kappa Alpha
Psi did say that he hopes the party starts
a trend, especially in light of the racial
tension at Stanford. "I wasn't naive enough
to think racism didn't exist, although i
hadn't experienced it personally before 1
got here," said Charles.
Charles said that his fraternity didn't
hold the party to make a statement. "The
guys were really pumped about it," said
Charles, who helped organize the event.
"We had thought about doing something
like this for a long time, but we wouldn't
really feel comfortable about doing it with
anyone else," he said.
Annie Williams, a senior in the sorority,
thought of the idea to have the party be
cause she and other members of the
sorority previously knew several members
of the fraternity and wanted to get to know
them in a social setting.
"Racial tension really makes me angry,"
said Williams, adding that "this is the per
fect time to make things more normal."
Racial harmony "couldn't hurt," said
Kappa Alpha Psi President Ira Williams.
"The party was a nice idea, and we all like
meeting new people."
Williams said that several ISC/IFC or
ganizations had approached him about
events in the past.
