Final Report on Recent Incidents
At Ujamaa House
COPYRIGHT ©1989, By the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, Stanford, California.
Last hall Quarter, the President asked
Thomas Mcßride, associate dean of the
Law School, and Jasper Williams, staff
counsel, to investigate and prepare a
report about the incidents that occurred in
Ujamaa House. The incidents were widely publicized and
became a matter of considerable interest to the Stanford
community. That is why this version of their report is
being released. It is intended to inform the campus
discussions that will inevitably follow.
This report differs slightly from the original.
Pseudonyms have been substituted for the names of all
who were involved even though their names were widely
reported at the time. In addition to the use of
pseudonyms, certain changes and deletions have been
made in order to protect the privacy and other interests of
individuals who were involved.
Why were these changes made? There will be much
interest in this incident by many beyond the campus
because it provides a gripping case study of behaviors
that were troubling to many and which occurred in a
complex web of action and reaction. Learning from this
history does not depend upon a published record in which
real names are used and I do not believe that the
participants' names should be the subject of discussion
among other schools as well as by alumni, parents, and
others who follow Stanford's matters closely. The
response to individuals is a matter properly left within the
domains of Stanford. The incident, on the other hand,
will clearly be of interest to the many colleges and
universities who are wrestling with the complex issues
embedded in incidents of racial insensitivity.

REPORT
1 he Beethoven Conversation.
In the early evening on September 29, 19S8, a core of
about ten Ujamaa and one Naranja house residents had a
wide ranging conversation in the main Ujamaa corridor:
other residents stopped, listened, joined in for a time and
moved on. At least 4 of the core participants were white: the
remainder black.
Freshman orientation, a major theme of which had been
respect tor ethnic diversity, had begun on September 22;
classes began on September 2X. Ujamaa is Stanford's black
culture residential theme house. It has 127 residents from all
classes (65 black; 62 nonblack). Naranja is an adjacent all
classes house with 65 residents (10 black; 55 nonblack). The
two houses share a common dining room.
I hree participants in the conversation figure prominently
in the subsequent events. Alexander S. Burton ("Alex") was
an undeclared freshman Ujamaa resident from Glen Ellyn.
Illinois. Frederick J. Schultz ("Fred") was a freshman Nar
anja resident. He lived in Canada from ages 6 to 16. For the
two years before entering Stanford he attended an English
boarding school. Vincent Edward Robbins ("QC") was a
sophomore I Jjamaa resident from the south side of Chicago
who is majoring in mechanical engineering. QC is part of a
group of black male students called the "bruhs" (short for
brothers) who are intensely interested in black history. They
have a friendship that many non bruhs think exclusionary.
Though originally composed of Ujamaa residents, not all the
bruhs live in Ujamaa now. Alex and Fred are white; QC is
black. 1
The topics of conversation that evening included black
influences on music, American race relations, and tribal /
political differences / racism in East Africa. The discussion
was sometimes heated. Fred told us that he had stopped
because he saw what "looked like a debate and I like
debates." .
During the part of the discussion relating to black contri
butions to music, one of the white participants said that rap
music was "violent and senseless." QC rejoined: "what
about rock music? Is it violent?" He then asserted that: "all
music is black." QC told us that he amplified this statement
by explaining that: "all music listened to today in America
has African origins _ beats, drums and so forth." Faye
Woodward, a white Ujamaa freshman, challenged this state
ment: "what about classical music? Beethoven?" QC re
sponded that Beethoven was black, a mulatto. Someone
asked QC: "where do you get your information?" QC
responded that he had read this and was willing to provide
proof. According toQC, Alex told QC to "forget it." (QC told
us that he relied on two sources for his statement about
Beethoven, one of which he owned and the other of which
was in the Ujamaa library.)
The conversation subsequently turned to the issue of
"racial purity" and a resident re|x>rtcdly described herself as
"pure African." Fred told us that he was "frustrated at that
point and l(x>kmg for something he could latch onto and
win." The residents then argued about the difficulties in
proving that all one's ancestors were from the same race,
current and historical definitions of black, and other aspects
of this subject.
Reactions to the Beethoven Conversation.
We asked Alex. Fred and QC for their reactions to the
Beethoven conversation. Q(' told us that he was upset at Alex
and Fred's reaction: "it was so far from their own truth" that
"they could not accept it." For Alex and I red. according to
QC. "it was out ot the question that such a thing Beethoven
being black could be true."
Alex said: "I had no reason to doubt what QC said -he'd
read it. Some ot the blacks in the hallway discussion were,
according to Alex, "promoting racial purity.' If you're
white, you're bad." Alex understood from the discussion,
that it one has as little as I / 32nd part black blood, "you're
black." He was opposed to this "separateness."
Fred told us that QC's assertion that Beethoven was black
"disturbed me." It was a "racial definition, based on ancestry.
I was raised in a multi-racial neighborhood. My best friend
was from a multi-racial tamily. I believed in individual,'not
racial' identity. I see | racial purity | as a concept that does no
one any good."
The Beethoven Poster.
On the next evening, Friday, September 30th, Alex and
Fred went out together. Thew visited a friend in a nearby
residence and drank a few vodkas. They then went to a
dormitory or fraternity party where they had more to drink.
Then they stopped at Tresidder and listened to music for a
while. Both told us that they were "drunk and stoned."
At some point in the evening Alex pointed out a black and
white Stanford Symphony recruiting poster featuring a pic
ture ot Beethoven. (Exhibit 1 is a copy of the poster in its
origiaaixoudition.) Fred said: "why don't we draw this in?
Whydon'twc make it look like he's a black?" Fred took the
poster down, folded and pocketed it. They returned to
Ujamaa, went to Alex's room, where he had some pastel
crayons, and colored in the poster, in Fred's words, to make
it "look like a stereotype of a black person." Fred told us that
he colored the face brown; both Fred and Alex drew lines
"emphasizing (enlarging)" the lips, and coloring in "black,
frizzy hair." Fred added red eyes "to give him a demonic
look, because Beethoven looked demonic."
When completed, around 12 to I a.m., Fred taped the
defaced poster to a chalkboard which is immediately adja
cent to QC's room. (Exhibit 2 is a reproduction of the defaced
poster.) QC would often put sayings or notices on this board,
especially quotations from and about black people. Many of
the residents reter to it as QC's "food for thought" board.
Shortly after hanging the poster, about 1 a.m. Saturday.
October I. Fred went to Charles Benson's room. Charles was
a friend who lived in Naranja. Fred took Charles to Ujamaa
and showed him the defaced poster on the board: he ex
plained that he and Alex had defaced it. Charles told us that
Fred was "drunk, staggering." They then went to Alex's
room. C harles told Alex "I saw the poster." According to
('harles. Alex said: "I'm getting sick of the way the Ujamaa
residents are talking about this Beethoven is black stuff."
QC found the poster on the board at about 7 a.m. on
Saturday. October I. Since he was on his way out to join a
cycling club trip, he simply t(X)k it down and put it in his
room, not quite realizing what the poster was. On the cycling
trip he told Ujamaa Theme Associate ("T / A") and friend
Michael Baldwin, a junior, about the poster. On their return
they looked at the poster. QC realized for the first time that
it was Beethoven and immediately linked it to the Beethoven
conversation.
Alex and Fred's Explanations for the Beetho\en
Poster.
We asked Alex and Fred why they defaced the poster.
Alex answered: "it was an emotional reaction to what it
was like for me to be there [Ujamaa]. I never saw it as a bad
place to live. I was learning a lot. But there were certain
things about (Ujamaa and certain| people that didn't
click.th.th.th. I had no malicious thought." He said that
defacing and hanging the poster were "not thought out. I was
hanging the poster because I was hanging the poster." He
said that he "wasn't really thinking" but was "going along
•th.th. I was a little bit led. bred was very actively pursuing
this." Alex related this "not to distance myself, but it bears
on how I felt at the time."
Alex also told us that he intended the poster as "a parody,
satire, bringing forth the idea that I didn't really agree with
this total concentration on being black - one quarter black
makes Beethoven all black." He continued that he "knew it
would evoke a reaction"; he said that he hoped that it would
"reignite the discussion on the black/w hitedistinction.th.th.th.
It wasn't just Beethoven. 1 accepted what was being said
about Beethoven. I didn't accept this black / white distinc
tion. People were terribly caught up in it."
In his interview, Alex seemed particularly disturbed that
a black Ujamaa resident had told him that she would never
marry a white person. He seemingly could not understand
how anyone could make such a choice based on race.
Alex told us that defacing the poster was the result of a
"lack of judgment" and "ignorance" and was "wrong."
Fred told us that he intended to make the poster image of
Beethoven "look like a stereotype" of a black man. "that's
why we gave him an Afro." Fred said that he "wanted to
make the poster look ridiculous. When you put a racial
identity on someone you stereotype, and stereotypes are
ridiculous. He told us: "it I had really [seriously! tried to
draw Beethoven as a black I would not have [drawn him| as
a stereotype."
Fred doubted that QC knew Beethoven's music and ex
pressed the opinion that "the fact that Beethoven was black
was important toQC, not Beethoven's musical accomplish
ments '; he thought it was "an ideological question" for QC.
He said that he was "revolted and angry, because I couldn't
reach people [ in the Beethoven conversation] to get them to
understand w hat I was feeling." Defacing the poster stemmed
from this "frustration."
I le said that he saw the poster as a way that he could "get
back at his adversaries in the Beethoven conversation but
that he also saw the poster as "satire" since it "showed the
connection between racial pride and stereotyping." He said
the poster w as a "satirical message" that classification as a
'member ot a group" could be "used for racial pride or
stereotyping."
