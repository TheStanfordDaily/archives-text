Fred told us that when he and Alex defaced the poster that
he thought that it was "tremendously tunny, a witty
x statement.'th" He elaborated that he was drunk and stoned
and that when he drinks he "feels that all [he does) is
important, relevant and right .th.th. more correct and pow
erful." He said that he never thought that people would be
offended.
Fred also related the poster defacing to experiences he
had in England. He said that his grandfather is a German
Jew. It was the custom for older students at his English
school to ask new students about their weaknesses and then
tease the new students about the weaknesses so the new
students would not take the weaknesses so seriously. Fred
had said that his "weakness" was being Jewish. The ensuing
teasing included saying that "Jew means miserly" and
putting a star of David on his door. He also said that when
he won arguments at his English school, the students would
sometimes say "stereotypical" things about Jews in reprisal.
Fred said that at first this teasing offended him, but by the
time he left the school he did not take it seriously and had
come to see the "humor as a release."
We asked Fred if he saw any parallels between his
English experiences and defacing the poster. He accepted
the analogy but responded that if anyone did a similar action
related to Jews that he would not be upset because of his
experience in England.
Fred also attributed the poster to his ignorance about the
American racial situation since he had been educated in
Canada and England: the most "I know about American
history is the fur trade." But he also attributed it to his
"arrogance and insensitivity" to others' feelings.
We pressed Fred as to why he did not put his name on the
poster. At first he hesitantly said that he "wanted to make a
statement, but not put his name behind the statement." He
said that he wanted to think about this more. He called back
a few days later and said that he had "just forgotten" to put
his name on the defaced poster.
Reactions to the Beethoven Poster.
In interviews we asked Ujamaa residents what their
reactions to the defaced poster had been. QC said that his
initial reaction was: that he was "flabbergasted. I couldn't
believe anybody would do that. You only see things like that
in the movies or on TV. It's the kind of thing someone would
do in their room and joke about but it didn't seem like anyone
would be bold enough to put it on a door." Ujamaa Resident
Assistant ("R / A") Rebecca Weiss, a senior, said the poster
was "hateful, shocking. I was outraged and sickened." T/A
Baldwin said "the Afro |on the poster| was a black stere
otype. To me the redeyes had an evil connotation. No human
being has eyes like that. The whole being looked very evil
_ devilish." But his further explanation is perhaps more il
luminating of the residents' reaction to the defaced poster.
He told us that the details of the poster were not important;
what was important was the drawers' intent to offend by
portraying a black person in a negative stereotype.
T / A Harold Brown, a sophomore, said, "|Fred| may
have intended it as a joke, but he knew, after orientation it
would piss the hell out of everyone.th.th.th. After all the pro
grams, how could he not have known!"
Events from October 1 to October 14.
Later in the day on October 1, QC showed the poster to
Ujamaa R / A John Andrews, a senior. They talked about the
obvious linkage to the Beethoven conversation and tried to
reconstruct a list of the participants. QC suspected Alex
from the beginning: "he was the only one who knew where
I lived and the only one who was real irate." The poster
passed through many hands in the following days. T / A
Baldwin had it for a time. Friends of QC's in another
dormitory had it. QC did not get it back until October 6 or
7.
Meanwhile word got around among the Ujamaa staff
about the defaced poster. Resident Fellow ("R / F") Mark
Brooks, a Stanford Development Officer, heard about it on
Sunday. October 2, and informed Richard Jamison, the As
sistant Dean of Student Affairs. R / F Brooks asked QC for
the poster on October 2. QC told him he did not have it. There
was some concern among the staff that QC and his friends
were going to "handle it themselves."
In the days following the posting of the defaced poster,
Fred said he felt "ashamed, guilty" and tried to "play mind
games" to "forget about it." Fred told us that he discussed the
poster with two friends, apparently to assuage his nervous
ness and with the hope that they would think it was "funny."
They did not. Both friends reacted that it was a "crazy" thing
to do. One of the friends, Charles Benson, told us that Fred
said QC was taking it [the poster] as a personal attack on
him. According to Charles, Fred said QC was a hypocrite "to
be so offended [by the poster hung outside his door]" since
QC "had done the same thing last year." 2
On at least two occasions during the period between
October I and 14, Fred engaged Bridges a senior and a black
Naranjaß/A, in discussion about the subjects of Beethoven's
blackness and her life as a black person. R / A Bridges took
Fred to the Ujamaa Black Culture library and showed him
a book which contained information about Beethoven's
ethnic origins. (Stephanie did not find out about the Beethoven
poster until October 14.)
A few days after the poster defacing, Fred sought the
advice of his Advising Associate ("A/A"), a junior. The A
/A told us that he had agreed with Fred that the poster was
"really stupid" but suggested that Fred do nothing and hope
that it would "blow over" since Fred had heard nothing
about the poster.
About two days after the poster defacing, an unidentified
person wrote in block letters on Alex's message pad. which
was tacked outside his door: "YOU SHALL PAY FOR
YOUR ACTIONS!" (Exhibit 3). And about a week after that
first message, someone wrote another unsigned note on the
pad in block letters which read: "TONITE IS THE NITE"
(Exhibit 4). Alex did not connect the first note to the
Beethoven conversation until he got the second note.
Alex and Fred told us that they had one or two conversa
tions during this period. Fred said he told Alex, "if people
find out, tell me about it. If you're going toconfess, tell them
about me as well."
2. Fred was referring to the so called "boning" incident
in which QC and some other male Ujamaa residents had
hung a sexist poster (apparently inspired by the movie School
Daze). The matter was dealt with in the house and by the
Dean of Student Affairs Office.
On Wednesday, October 5, at the regularly scheduled
Ujamaa staff meeting, T/A Brown reported the finding of
the Beethoven poster, saying, "we ought to find out who did
it and kick these guys out of the dorm." R / F Brooks arrived
late for the meeting. After he was briefed, there was further
discussion of what should be done. Someone suggested they
alert Dean Jamison and Robert Richardson. Associate Dean
of Student Affairs. Others wanted to handle the matter
within the house. Some also expressed concern about the
potential for negative publicity about the incident.
The group agreed that the person who defaced and posted
the Beethoven poster was probably one of the white partici
pants in the Beethoven conversation. Indeed, suspicion had
already begun to focus on Alex because of discussions that
had occurred during freshman orientation. T / A Elliot
Grossman, a senior, said: Alex was quite "vehement" and
seemed "to have a problem with the idea of (racial] differ
ences .th.th. offended by the idea that some people consider
themselves different." He seemed like a "nice guy" but he
"aired his opinions." He wanted others to "relax and focus
on the humanistic aspect of everyone" and could not see
why race or diversity was such a "big deal."
After some discussion as to whether an immediate house
meeting should be called, the staff decided to have a meeting
at 11 p.m. that night in R/ F Brooks' apartment with the
Beethoven conversation participants. The meeting did not
take place, apparently because QC and one or two of his
friends who had participated in the conversation did not
want to attend such a meeting. T / A Brown said that QC
"was. in a sense, afraid." From past experiences he felt "the
victim gets blamed" and that somehow the whole incident
might "be turned against him." According to one of the R /
As who talked to QC right after the October 5 meeting, QC
"was unwilling to make a commitment" and "didn't want to
become involved." In any event the upshot was that nothing
happened. No action was taken at that time nor did any of the
Ujamaa staff take action between that time and the next staff
meeting.
The next regularly scheduled Ujamaa staff meeting was
held on Wednesday, October 12. Once again the staff dis
cussed the Beethoven poster. By this time, a staff member
had gotten the poster from QC and it was shown at the
meeting. In the discussion, some argued that the Beethoven
poster issue should not be pursued: "It took too long to get the
poster. Let's drop it!" Others felt strongly that they should
pursue the matter and proceed with the earlier plan of
assembling the Beethoven conversation participants with the
aim of getting the culprit to confess. Still others felt the issue
should be raised at the Ujamaa full house meeting which was
to occur at 8 p.m. that same evening. When the staff meeting
broke up, some left with the impression that the issue of the
Beethoven poster would be raised at the house meeting that
night. It was not brought up, either because R / A Andrews,
who conducted the October 12 house meeting, decided not
to bring it up or because of "miscommunication."
The "Niggers" Poster.
Sometime on or before October 13, Ujamaa resident Paul •
Morris hung a poster near the Ujamaa lounge advertising a
dance at U.C. Berkeley, sponsored by Kappa Alpha Psi, a
black fraternity. About 2 a.m. on the morning of Friday,
October 14, Morris noticed the poster had fallen down. He
rehung it. When he passed by a few minutes later, the poster
had disappeared.
Meanwhile QC had been studying with Sidney Miller, a
Ujamaa resident in the A Wing at Ujamaa. At around 2:30
a.m. QC and Sidney walked toward QC's room in the B
Wing. As they passed a large bulletin board in the second
floor crosswalk between A and B Wings, they noticed the
Kappa Alpha Psi poster. Someone had scrawled the word
"NIGGERS" diagonally across it. (Exhibit 5 is a slightly
reduced photocopy of the defaced Kappa poster.) QC and
Sidney took the poster down, showed it to another friend and
discussed whether to notify residence staff. Later that morn
ing. when QC returned from classes, he showed the poster to
R / A Andrews and Marshall Klipp, a senior and the head A
/A. Several of the residence staff discussed it. They decided
to call an emergency house meeting for that night to discuss
both the "Niggers" and "Beethoven" posters.
While R / F Brooks was not involved in this decision, later
that day one of the staff told him about the meeting planned
for that night.
Friday, October 14: The First Emergency House
Meeting
R / A Mary Johnson, a senior, facilitated the October 14
emergency house meeting. R / F Brooks was going back and
forth between the meeting and a Black Alumni Weekend
meeting at Tresidder. There were about 75 or 80 people at the
meeting, including Alex and QC, but not including Fred.
Both posters were exhibited at the meeting which was
"very intense." All of the students who spoke were clearly
outraged by the posters. At some point R / A Johnson asked,
"does anybody want to stand up and admit to it now? If you
have any information let us know now or come to one of the
staff after the meeting."
Alex said nothing at the meeting. Alex told us that in his
opinion the meeting was so "heated and emotional" that there
was a "threat of violence" so "there was no way 1 was going
to come forward."
The October 14 meeting became, in the words of one of
the staff, "an occasion to release anger about many things" _
the Western Culture controversy, the Otero incident (and
what was viewed as the University's unwillingness to take
action against the accused Otero resident or the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity members who participated in the subsequent
"vigil,") and Residential Education for a "plot" to reduce the
number of blacks living in Ujamaa. The Beethoven and
Kappa Alpha Psi poster defacings became "one of many
grievances."
In addition to reactions of shock and anger, the deeper
reaction of many of the Ujamaa staff was one of "sadness."
During the 1987 to 1988 academic year there had been a lot
of "tension" at Ujamaa. This year during staff training there
was a "sense of new beginnings." The staff was "more
united," "congenial." "The freshmen seemed happy." As T/
A Grossman said: "Things were going really well until this!"
"There was greater friendliness among the students includ
ing lots of black and white friendships." With the discovery
of the posters, "all our efforts were shot."
Friday, October 14: The Identification of Fred and
Alex.
Immediately after the meeting, a white Ujamaa resi
dent told T / A Brown that this resident had heard
someone with an English accent say that he had
defaced the Beethoven poster.
T/A Brown, recalling that Fred had an English accent,
went to his room and asked Fred if he knew anything about
the Beethoven poster. Fred replied that "he'd heard of it." T
/A Brown then told Fred about the finding of the "Niggers"
poster. He said "people are really angry," "people are suspi
cious of you," and there are people planning "to beat the hell
out of you." Fred suggested they take a walk outside. Once
outside Fred admitted to T/A Brown that he had defaced the
Beethoven poster. T / A Brown asked if anyone else was
involved. Fred replied, "Before I tell you, let me tell you
why" and proceeded to give T / A Brown an explanation
similar to those he later made at the meeting with the Ujamaa
staff and in our later interview. (See infra and supra.) Fred
then identified Alex as the person who defaced the poster
with him.
T/ A Brown said Fred was "really nervous"; he "realized
the implications." According to T / A Brown, at one point.
Fred knelt down, seemingly in shock. T/A Brown told us that
Fred said that he thought the poster would "blow over" but
after their conversation he wanted to go to the house meeting
and "confess" so the residents could "let him have it [their
anger]" and he could "absorb it [ understand their reaction]."
We asked T / A Brown if in fact there were residents
planning to beat up Alex and Fred. He said no; that this was
a ruse to get Fred to tell the truth.
Since the emergency meeting was over, T/A Brown then
took Fred to R / A Johnson's room where the Ujamaa staff,
as well as Sally Stewart, a junior and President of the Black
Student Union and a former Ujamaa resident, then as
sembled. Fred told us that everyone was "calm" at the
meeting except Sally Stewart who started "yelling" at him.
At that point, R / A Patrick McAllister, a senior and the only
non-black on the Ujamaa staff, suggested that they call R / F
Brooks who arrived shortly thereafter.
T/A Brown said, "Fred has something to tell you." Fred
then told R / F Brooks that he had defaced the Beethoven
poster. When asked why, he said he was "drinking and
stoned." Also, "there was such an emphasis on ethnocentric
character .th.th. people were taking it too seriously .th.th.
wasn't what he was used to in England .th.th. thought he'd
make light of it." R / As Bridges, who is black, and Clark West
from Naranja were called in. (Naranja R / F Gary Griffin, a
doctoral student in psychology, was away and could not be
reached.) When R / A Bridges, whom Fred had got to know
quite well, entered, Fred began to cry.
Fred again identified Alex as the other participant. He said
"Alex is going to kill me [for identifying Alex]." Someone
had seen Alex earlier, drinking beer in another resident's
room. One of the staff went and got Alex and brought him to
R / A Johnson's room. Alex admitted his involvement. Alex's
explanation of why he did it was similar to Fred's. People
were "taking this whole thing of diversity too seriously." He
intended the poster as "a joke," "to make light of it." He also
alluded to his background, growing up in Chicago and said
his parents "hadn't raised him todo (racial ] things like that."
Alex said he was "drunk and stoned" but realized that was 110
excuse. According to R/ F Brooks. Alex and Fred's explana
tions seemed like attempts to justify or rationalize, "It didn't
sell with the staff."
The discussion then turned to what Fred and Alex should
do. R / F Brooks told them they would have to admit to the
Ujamaa community what they had done, and they would
have to apologize, without trying to rationalize. After consid
erable discussion, and varying views, as to what Fred and
Alex should do, it was left that they would prepare a "plan of
action" and deliver it to R / F Brtxiks the following morning
(Saturday). The staff decided to call an emergency house
meeting for noon, Sunday, at which Fred and Alex would
appear. Fred and Alex were anxious for this chance to talk to
the residents.
Alex and Fred's plan of action is Exhibit 6. R / F Brooks
found the plan of action under his door around 8:30 a.m.
Saturday morning. Later that morning Alex returned to talk
to R / F Brooks about it; according to Alex they had a 1-2
minute conversation about it. Ihe plan provides that Alex
and Fred would: (I )appearat the Sunday October 16 meeting
"to discuss |thei|r motives and receive the responses ot the
audience"; (2) write a letter to the Stanford Daily discussing
the incident: and (3) perhaps take "further steps" after they
had "absorbed the reactions." In view of subsequent events,
we note that the plan docs not provide for an apology.
In his interview Fred told us that at the informal October
14 meeting in R / A Johnson's room "he was in a state of
shock." After all his "mind games" he was facing "reality."
He saw the faces looking at him "impassively, with disgust."
He also sensed a "weariness" from the Ujamaa stall, that "all
their educational efforts at orientation amounted to nothing."
He said Sally Stewart's "yelling" at him upset him.
Alex said that some in the group were "angry," "hostile,"
though R/ F Brix)ks was "matter of fact," as if saying, "the
ball's in your court. What are you going to do now?" Alex
said he (Alex) became "very distraught" and "broke down."
Preparation for the Sunday, October 16 Meeting.
Naranja R / F Griffin told us that he had "mixed feelings"
about the planned Sunday meeting and was concerned about
the"due process" issues; that the Ujamaa statt had "forced"
Alex and Fred to attend the Sunday meeting. Griffin added
that he, however, felt "disempowered." "Ujamaa wanted
control. Faced with the choice, 1 decided to give it to them.
I didn't feel qualified to judge the impact the incident had 011
the blacks in Ujamaa." He did not raise these concerns with
the Ujamaa staff. Indeed*he staffs did not plan a joint strategy
for the joint meeting. As we note above, Alex and Fred
wanted the Sunday meeting as a forum to explain their
conduct.
Naranja staff had posted notice of the "mandatory" Sun
day joint meeting. But Naranja residents were largely unin
formed about the facts. Naranja staff had decided it was better
to let them learn the facts at the meeting; therefore they
declined to answer Naranja residents' questions about the
purpose of the meeting.
Alex told us that he thought that the "rebuilding" would
have to occur on a "one-on-one basis" and in "smaller
groups." He felt that he had begun the process in a Saturday,
October 15 conversation with his R / A, John Andrews, "a
good R / A and I respect him." John told Alex that "it would
take time" to work things out; he said he "couldn't say" if they
"would work out in a few weeks." Alex left John feeling
"quite gotxl" and that the situation "could and should be
worked out."
On Saturday, October 15, Fred talked to a number of
people in Naranja about the poster. In a long conversation
with R / F Griffin, he described his experience in England
related to being part Jewish. R / F Griffin advised Fred to be
very "contrite" at the house meeting the following day.
Alex and Fred spent the evening of Saturday, October 15
preparing their presentation for the Sunday meeting.
On Sunday morning Alex worked at his fcxxl service job.
Fred went to R / A Johnson's nxnn and asked to talk. They
agreed that he and Alex would return later that morning
before the emergency meeting.
Fred visited "as many [41 Naranja black residents as I
could." He told them that he had defaced the Beethoven
poster and that he hoped that they would come to the
emergency meeting to hear his explanation. 1 le explained to
us that he expected to continue to live with them and he was
afraid that if they heard about his actions from someone else
then they would not understand why he had done the poster.
Some of the visits also included discussions of race.
Sometime on the morning of October 16, Fred also went
to QC's rcxim. He told us that he told QC that the "poster was
not a personal attack" though "I can't give you anything other
than my word." He also told QC that he "knew about the
boning incident" and "[QC] should be aware | that Fred] was
going through something similar to what QC went through."
He said that QC said he was not planning to go to the
emergency meeting and Fred asked him to "please" go. QC
confirmed the visit but does not remember the details of what
Fred said since he was "half asleep." He dtx's remember
being asked if he were going to the emergency house meeting
and recalls answering in the affirmative.
Around 11:45 a.m. Alex and Fred went to R /A Johnson's
room to discuss their planned statement. They told her that
they would talk about their "subconscious racism" and admit
that they had been "drunk and stoned" when they defaced the
poster. R / A Johnson told them that the residents would not
"buy" these rationales.
Sunday, October 16: The Second Emergency House
Meeting.
Eighty toone hundred twenty persons, including about 30
Naranja residents, crowded into the Ujamaa lounge for the
Sunday, October 16 joint Ujamaa Naranja emergency house
meeting.

As who talked to QC right after the October 5 meeting, QC
"was unwilling to make a commitment" and "didn't want to
become involved." In any event the upshot was that nothing
happened. No action was taken at that time nor did any of the
Ujamaa staff take action between that time and the next staff
meeting.
The next regularly scheduled Ujamaa staff meeting was
held on Wednesday, October 12. Once again the staff dis
cussed the Beethoven poster. By this time, a staff member
had gotten the poster from QC and it was shown at the
meeting. In the discussion, some argued that the Beethoven
poster issue should not be pursued: "It took too long to get the
poster. Let's drop it!" Others felt strongly that they should
pursue the matter and proceed with the earlier plan of
assembling the Beethoven conversation participants with the
aim of getting the culprit to confess. Still others felt the issue
should be raised at the Ujamaa full house meeting which was
to occur at 8 p.m. that same evening. When the staff meeting
broke up, some left with the impression that the issue of the
Beethoven poster would be raised at the house meeting that
night. It was not brought up, either because R / A Andrews,
who conducted the October 12 house meeting, decided not
to bring it up or because of "miscommunication."
The "Niggers" Poster.
Sometime on or before October 13, Ujamaa resident Paul •
Morris hung a poster near the Ujamaa lounge advertising a
dance at U.C. Berkeley, sponsored by Kappa Alpha Psi, a
black fraternity. About 2 a.m. on the morning of Friday,
October 14, Morris noticed the poster had fallen down. He
rehung it. When he passed by a few minutes later, the poster
had disappeared.
Meanwhile QC had been studying with Sidney Miller, a
Ujamaa resident in the A Wing at Ujamaa. At around 2:30
a.m. QC and Sidney walked toward QC's room in the B
Wing. As they passed a large bulletin board in the second
floor crosswalk between A and B Wings, they noticed the
Kappa Alpha Psi poster. Someone had scrawled the word
"NIGGERS" diagonally across it. (Exhibit 5 is a slightly
reduced photocopy of the defaced Kappa poster.) QC and
Sidney took the poster down, showed it to another friend and
discussed whether to notify residence staff. Later that morn
ing. when QC returned from classes, he showed the poster to
R / A Andrews and Marshall Klipp, a senior and the head A
/A. Several of the residence staff discussed it. They decided
to call an emergency house meeting for that night to discuss
both the "Niggers" and "Beethoven" posters.
While R / F Brooks was not involved in this decision, later
that day one of the staff told him about the meeting planned
for that night.
Friday, October 14: The First Emergency House
Meeting
R / A Mary Johnson, a senior, facilitated the October 14
emergency house meeting. R / F Brooks was going back and
forth between the meeting and a Black Alumni Weekend
meeting at Tresidder. There were about 75 or 80 people at the
meeting, including Alex and QC, but not including Fred.
Both posters were exhibited at the meeting which was
"very intense." All of the students who spoke were clearly
outraged by the posters. At some point R / A Johnson asked,
"does anybody want to stand up and admit to it now? If you
have any information let us know now or come to one of the
staff after the meeting."
Alex said nothing at the meeting. Alex told us that in his
opinion the meeting was so "heated and emotional" that there
was a "threat of violence" so "there was no way 1 was going
to come forward."
The October 14 meeting became, in the words of one of
the staff, "an occasion to release anger about many things" _
the Western Culture controversy, the Otero incident (and
what was viewed as the University's unwillingness to take
action against the accused Otero resident or the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity members who participated in the subsequent
"vigil,") and Residential Education for a "plot" to reduce the
number of blacks living in Ujamaa. The Beethoven and
Kappa Alpha Psi poster defacings became "one of many
grievances."
In addition to reactions of shock and anger, the deeper
reaction of many of the Ujamaa staff was one of "sadness."
During the 1987 to 1988 academic year there had been a lot
of "tension" at Ujamaa. This year during staff training there
was a "sense of new beginnings." The staff was "more
united," "congenial." "The freshmen seemed happy." As T/
A Grossman said: "Things were going really well until this!"
"There was greater friendliness among the students includ
ing lots of black and white friendships." With the discovery
of the posters, "all our efforts were shot."
Friday, October 14: The Identification of Fred and
Alex.
Immediately after the meeting, a white Ujamaa resi
dent told T / A Brown that this resident had heard
someone with an English accent say that he had
defaced the Beethoven poster.
T/A Brown, recalling that Fred had an English accent,
went to his room and asked Fred if he knew anything about
the Beethoven poster. Fred replied that "he'd heard of it." T
/A Brown then told Fred about the finding of the "Niggers"
poster. He said "people are really angry," "people are suspi
cious of you," and there are people planning "to beat the hell
out of you." Fred suggested they take a walk outside. Once
outside Fred admitted to T/A Brown that he had defaced the
Beethoven poster. T / A Brown asked if anyone else was
involved. Fred replied, "Before I tell you, let me tell you
why" and proceeded to give T / A Brown an explanation
similar to those he later made at the meeting with the Ujamaa
staff and in our later interview. (See infra and supra.) Fred
then identified Alex as the person who defaced the poster
with him.
T/ A Brown said Fred was "really nervous"; he "realized
the implications." According to T / A Brown, at one point.
Fred knelt down, seemingly in shock. T/A Brown told us that
Fred said that he thought the poster would "blow over" but
after their conversation he wanted to go to the house meeting
and "confess" so the residents could "let him have it [their
anger]" and he could "absorb it [ understand their reaction]."
We asked T / A Brown if in fact there were residents
planning to beat up Alex and Fred. He said no; that this was
a ruse to get Fred to tell the truth.
Since the emergency meeting was over, T/A Brown then
took Fred to R / A Johnson's room where the Ujamaa staff,
as well as Sally Stewart, a junior and President of the Black
Student Union and a former Ujamaa resident, then as
sembled. Fred told us that everyone was "calm" at the
meeting except Sally Stewart who started "yelling" at him.
At that point, R / A Patrick McAllister, a senior and the only
non-black on the Ujamaa staff, suggested that they call R / F
Brooks who arrived shortly thereafter.
T/A Brown said, "Fred has something to tell you." Fred
then told R / F Brooks that he had defaced the Beethoven
poster. When asked why, he said he was "drinking and
stoned." Also, "there was such an emphasis on ethnocentric
character .th.th. people were taking it too seriously .th.th.
wasn't what he was used to in England .th.th. thought he'd
make light of it." R / As Bridges, who is black, and Clark West
from Naranja were called in. (Naranja R / F Gary Griffin, a
doctoral student in psychology, was away and could not be
reached.) When R / A Bridges, whom Fred had got to know
quite well, entered, Fred began to cry.
Fred again identified Alex as the other participant. He said
"Alex is going to kill me [for identifying Alex]." Someone
had seen Alex earlier, drinking beer in another resident's
room. One of the staff went and got Alex and brought him to
R / A Johnson's room. Alex admitted his involvement. Alex's
explanation of why he did it was similar to Fred's. People
were "taking this whole thing of diversity too seriously." He
intended the poster as "a joke," "to make light of it." He also
alluded to his background, growing up in Chicago and said
his parents "hadn't raised him todo (racial ] things like that."
Alex said he was "drunk and stoned" but realized that was 110
excuse. According to R/ F Brooks. Alex and Fred's explana
tions seemed like attempts to justify or rationalize, "It didn't
sell with the staff."
The discussion then turned to what Fred and Alex should
do. R / F Brooks told them they would have to admit to the
Ujamaa community what they had done, and they would
have to apologize, without trying to rationalize. After consid
erable discussion, and varying views, as to what Fred and
Alex should do, it was left that they would prepare a "plan of
action" and deliver it to R / F Brtxiks the following morning
(Saturday). The staff decided to call an emergency house
meeting for noon, Sunday, at which Fred and Alex would
appear. Fred and Alex were anxious for this chance to talk to
the residents.
Alex and Fred's plan of action is Exhibit 6. R / F Brooks
found the plan of action under his door around 8:30 a.m.
Saturday morning. Later that morning Alex returned to talk
to R / F Brooks about it; according to Alex they had a 1-2
minute conversation about it. Ihe plan provides that Alex
and Fred would: (I )appearat the Sunday October 16 meeting
"to discuss |thei|r motives and receive the responses ot the
audience"; (2) write a letter to the Stanford Daily discussing
the incident: and (3) perhaps take "further steps" after they
had "absorbed the reactions." In view of subsequent events,
we note that the plan docs not provide for an apology.
In his interview Fred told us that at the informal October
14 meeting in R / A Johnson's room "he was in a state of
shock." After all his "mind games" he was facing "reality."
He saw the faces looking at him "impassively, with disgust."
He also sensed a "weariness" from the Ujamaa stall, that "all
their educational efforts at orientation amounted to nothing."
He said Sally Stewart's "yelling" at him upset him.
Alex said that some in the group were "angry," "hostile,"
though R/ F Brix)ks was "matter of fact," as if saying, "the
ball's in your court. What are you going to do now?" Alex
said he (Alex) became "very distraught" and "broke down."
Preparation for the Sunday, October 16 Meeting.
Naranja R / F Griffin told us that he had "mixed feelings"
about the planned Sunday meeting and was concerned about
the"due process" issues; that the Ujamaa statt had "forced"
Alex and Fred to attend the Sunday meeting. Griffin added
that he, however, felt "disempowered." "Ujamaa wanted
control. Faced with the choice, 1 decided to give it to them.
I didn't feel qualified to judge the impact the incident had 011
the blacks in Ujamaa." He did not raise these concerns with
the Ujamaa staff. Indeed*he staffs did not plan a joint strategy
for the joint meeting. As we note above, Alex and Fred
wanted the Sunday meeting as a forum to explain their
conduct.
Naranja staff had posted notice of the "mandatory" Sun
day joint meeting. But Naranja residents were largely unin
formed about the facts. Naranja staff had decided it was better
to let them learn the facts at the meeting; therefore they
declined to answer Naranja residents' questions about the
purpose of the meeting.
Alex told us that he thought that the "rebuilding" would
have to occur on a "one-on-one basis" and in "smaller
groups." He felt that he had begun the process in a Saturday,
October 15 conversation with his R / A, John Andrews, "a
good R / A and I respect him." John told Alex that "it would
take time" to work things out; he said he "couldn't say" if they
"would work out in a few weeks." Alex left John feeling
"quite gotxl" and that the situation "could and should be
worked out."
On Saturday, October 15, Fred talked to a number of
people in Naranja about the poster. In a long conversation
with R / F Griffin, he described his experience in England
related to being part Jewish. R / F Griffin advised Fred to be
very "contrite" at the house meeting the following day.
Alex and Fred spent the evening of Saturday, October 15
preparing their presentation for the Sunday meeting.
On Sunday morning Alex worked at his fcxxl service job.
Fred went to R / A Johnson's nxnn and asked to talk. They
agreed that he and Alex would return later that morning
before the emergency meeting.
Fred visited "as many [41 Naranja black residents as I
could." He told them that he had defaced the Beethoven
poster and that he hoped that they would come to the
emergency meeting to hear his explanation. 1 le explained to
us that he expected to continue to live with them and he was
afraid that if they heard about his actions from someone else
then they would not understand why he had done the poster.
Some of the visits also included discussions of race.
Sometime on the morning of October 16, Fred also went
to QC's rcxim. He told us that he told QC that the "poster was
not a personal attack" though "I can't give you anything other
than my word." He also told QC that he "knew about the
boning incident" and "[QC] should be aware | that Fred] was
going through something similar to what QC went through."
He said that QC said he was not planning to go to the
emergency meeting and Fred asked him to "please" go. QC
confirmed the visit but does not remember the details of what
Fred said since he was "half asleep." He dtx's remember
being asked if he were going to the emergency house meeting
and recalls answering in the affirmative.
Around 11:45 a.m. Alex and Fred went to R /A Johnson's
room to discuss their planned statement. They told her that
they would talk about their "subconscious racism" and admit
that they had been "drunk and stoned" when they defaced the
poster. R / A Johnson told them that the residents would not
"buy" these rationales.
Sunday, October 16: The Second Emergency House
Meeting.
Eighty toone hundred twenty persons, including about 30
Naranja residents, crowded into the Ujamaa lounge for the
Sunday, October 16 joint Ujamaa Naranja emergency house
meeting.

Fred told us that when he and Alex defaced the poster that
he thought that it was "tremendously tunny, a witty
x statement.'th" He elaborated that he was drunk and stoned
and that when he drinks he "feels that all [he does) is
important, relevant and right .th.th. more correct and pow
erful." He said that he never thought that people would be
offended.
Fred also related the poster defacing to experiences he
had in England. He said that his grandfather is a German
Jew. It was the custom for older students at his English
school to ask new students about their weaknesses and then
tease the new students about the weaknesses so the new
students would not take the weaknesses so seriously. Fred
had said that his "weakness" was being Jewish. The ensuing
teasing included saying that "Jew means miserly" and
putting a star of David on his door. He also said that when
he won arguments at his English school, the students would
sometimes say "stereotypical" things about Jews in reprisal.
Fred said that at first this teasing offended him, but by the
time he left the school he did not take it seriously and had
come to see the "humor as a release."
We asked Fred if he saw any parallels between his
English experiences and defacing the poster. He accepted
the analogy but responded that if anyone did a similar action
related to Jews that he would not be upset because of his
experience in England.
Fred also attributed the poster to his ignorance about the
American racial situation since he had been educated in
Canada and England: the most "I know about American
history is the fur trade." But he also attributed it to his
"arrogance and insensitivity" to others' feelings.
We pressed Fred as to why he did not put his name on the
poster. At first he hesitantly said that he "wanted to make a
statement, but not put his name behind the statement." He
said that he wanted to think about this more. He called back
a few days later and said that he had "just forgotten" to put
his name on the defaced poster.
Reactions to the Beethoven Poster.
In interviews we asked Ujamaa residents what their
reactions to the defaced poster had been. QC said that his
initial reaction was: that he was "flabbergasted. I couldn't
believe anybody would do that. You only see things like that
in the movies or on TV. It's the kind of thing someone would
do in their room and joke about but it didn't seem like anyone
would be bold enough to put it on a door." Ujamaa Resident
Assistant ("R / A") Rebecca Weiss, a senior, said the poster
was "hateful, shocking. I was outraged and sickened." T/A
Baldwin said "the Afro |on the poster| was a black stere
otype. To me the redeyes had an evil connotation. No human
being has eyes like that. The whole being looked very evil
_ devilish." But his further explanation is perhaps more il
luminating of the residents' reaction to the defaced poster.
He told us that the details of the poster were not important;
what was important was the drawers' intent to offend by
portraying a black person in a negative stereotype.
T / A Harold Brown, a sophomore, said, "|Fred| may
have intended it as a joke, but he knew, after orientation it
would piss the hell out of everyone.th.th.th. After all the pro
grams, how could he not have known!"
Events from October 1 to October 14.
Later in the day on October 1, QC showed the poster to
Ujamaa R / A John Andrews, a senior. They talked about the
obvious linkage to the Beethoven conversation and tried to
reconstruct a list of the participants. QC suspected Alex
from the beginning: "he was the only one who knew where
I lived and the only one who was real irate." The poster
passed through many hands in the following days. T / A
Baldwin had it for a time. Friends of QC's in another
dormitory had it. QC did not get it back until October 6 or
7.
Meanwhile word got around among the Ujamaa staff
about the defaced poster. Resident Fellow ("R / F") Mark
Brooks, a Stanford Development Officer, heard about it on
Sunday. October 2, and informed Richard Jamison, the As
sistant Dean of Student Affairs. R / F Brooks asked QC for
the poster on October 2. QC told him he did not have it. There
was some concern among the staff that QC and his friends
were going to "handle it themselves."
In the days following the posting of the defaced poster,
Fred said he felt "ashamed, guilty" and tried to "play mind
games" to "forget about it." Fred told us that he discussed the
poster with two friends, apparently to assuage his nervous
ness and with the hope that they would think it was "funny."
They did not. Both friends reacted that it was a "crazy" thing
to do. One of the friends, Charles Benson, told us that Fred
said QC was taking it [the poster] as a personal attack on
him. According to Charles, Fred said QC was a hypocrite "to
be so offended [by the poster hung outside his door]" since
QC "had done the same thing last year." 2
On at least two occasions during the period between
October I and 14, Fred engaged Bridges a senior and a black
Naranjaß/A, in discussion about the subjects of Beethoven's
blackness and her life as a black person. R / A Bridges took
Fred to the Ujamaa Black Culture library and showed him
a book which contained information about Beethoven's
ethnic origins. (Stephanie did not find out about the Beethoven
poster until October 14.)
A few days after the poster defacing, Fred sought the
advice of his Advising Associate ("A/A"), a junior. The A
/A told us that he had agreed with Fred that the poster was
"really stupid" but suggested that Fred do nothing and hope
that it would "blow over" since Fred had heard nothing
about the poster.
About two days after the poster defacing, an unidentified
person wrote in block letters on Alex's message pad. which
was tacked outside his door: "YOU SHALL PAY FOR
YOUR ACTIONS!" (Exhibit 3). And about a week after that
first message, someone wrote another unsigned note on the
pad in block letters which read: "TONITE IS THE NITE"
(Exhibit 4). Alex did not connect the first note to the
Beethoven conversation until he got the second note.
Alex and Fred told us that they had one or two conversa
tions during this period. Fred said he told Alex, "if people
find out, tell me about it. If you're going toconfess, tell them
about me as well."
2. Fred was referring to the so called "boning" incident
in which QC and some other male Ujamaa residents had
hung a sexist poster (apparently inspired by the movie School
Daze). The matter was dealt with in the house and by the
Dean of Student Affairs Office.
On Wednesday, October 5, at the regularly scheduled
Ujamaa staff meeting, T/A Brown reported the finding of
the Beethoven poster, saying, "we ought to find out who did
it and kick these guys out of the dorm." R / F Brooks arrived
late for the meeting. After he was briefed, there was further
discussion of what should be done. Someone suggested they
alert Dean Jamison and Robert Richardson. Associate Dean
of Student Affairs. Others wanted to handle the matter
within the house. Some also expressed concern about the
potential for negative publicity about the incident.
The group agreed that the person who defaced and posted
the Beethoven poster was probably one of the white partici
pants in the Beethoven conversation. Indeed, suspicion had
already begun to focus on Alex because of discussions that
had occurred during freshman orientation. T / A Elliot
Grossman, a senior, said: Alex was quite "vehement" and
seemed "to have a problem with the idea of (racial] differ
ences .th.th. offended by the idea that some people consider
themselves different." He seemed like a "nice guy" but he
"aired his opinions." He wanted others to "relax and focus
on the humanistic aspect of everyone" and could not see
why race or diversity was such a "big deal."
After some discussion as to whether an immediate house
meeting should be called, the staff decided to have a meeting
at 11 p.m. that night in R/ F Brooks' apartment with the
Beethoven conversation participants. The meeting did not
take place, apparently because QC and one or two of his
friends who had participated in the conversation did not
want to attend such a meeting. T / A Brown said that QC
"was. in a sense, afraid." From past experiences he felt "the
victim gets blamed" and that somehow the whole incident
might "be turned against him." According to one of the R /
As who talked to QC right after the October 5 meeting, QC
"was unwilling to make a commitment" and "didn't want to
become involved." In any event the upshot was that nothing
happened. No action was taken at that time nor did any of the
Ujamaa staff take action between that time and the next staff
meeting.
The next regularly scheduled Ujamaa staff meeting was
held on Wednesday, October 12. Once again the staff dis
cussed the Beethoven poster. By this time, a staff member
had gotten the poster from QC and it was shown at the
meeting. In the discussion, some argued that the Beethoven
poster issue should not be pursued: "It took too long to get the

Ujamaa community what they had done, and they would
have to apologize, without trying to rationalize. After consid
erable discussion, and varying views, as to what Fred and
Alex should do, it was left that they would prepare a "plan of
action" and deliver it to R / F Brtxiks the following morning
(Saturday). The staff decided to call an emergency house
meeting for noon, Sunday, at which Fred and Alex would
appear. Fred and Alex were anxious for this chance to talk to
the residents.
Alex and Fred's plan of action is Exhibit 6. R / F Brooks
found the plan of action under his door around 8:30 a.m.
Saturday morning. Later that morning Alex returned to talk
to R / F Brooks about it; according to Alex they had a 1-2
minute conversation about it. Ihe plan provides that Alex
and Fred would: (I )appearat the Sunday October 16 meeting
"to discuss |thei|r motives and receive the responses ot the
audience"; (2) write a letter to the Stanford Daily discussing
the incident: and (3) perhaps take "further steps" after they
had "absorbed the reactions." In view of subsequent events,
we note that the plan docs not provide for an apology.
In his interview Fred told us that at the informal October
14 meeting in R / A Johnson's room "he was in a state of
shock." After all his "mind games" he was facing "reality."
He saw the faces looking at him "impassively, with disgust."
He also sensed a "weariness" from the Ujamaa stall, that "all
their educational efforts at orientation amounted to nothing."
He said Sally Stewart's "yelling" at him upset him.
Alex said that some in the group were "angry," "hostile,"
though R/ F Brix)ks was "matter of fact," as if saying, "the
ball's in your court. What are you going to do now?" Alex
said he (Alex) became "very distraught" and "broke down."
Preparation for the Sunday, October 16 Meeting.
Naranja R / F Griffin told us that he had "mixed feelings"
about the planned Sunday meeting and was concerned about
the"due process" issues; that the Ujamaa statt had "forced"
Alex and Fred to attend the Sunday meeting. Griffin added
that he, however, felt "disempowered." "Ujamaa wanted
control. Faced with the choice, 1 decided to give it to them.
I didn't feel qualified to judge the impact the incident had 011
the blacks in Ujamaa." He did not raise these concerns with
the Ujamaa staff. Indeed*he staffs did not plan a joint strategy
for the joint meeting. As we note above, Alex and Fred
wanted the Sunday meeting as a forum to explain their
conduct.
Naranja staff had posted notice of the "mandatory" Sun
day joint meeting. But Naranja residents were largely unin
formed about the facts. Naranja staff had decided it was better
to let them learn the facts at the meeting; therefore they
declined to answer Naranja residents' questions about the
purpose of the meeting.
Alex told us that he thought that the "rebuilding" would
have to occur on a "one-on-one basis" and in "smaller
groups." He felt that he had begun the process in a Saturday,
October 15 conversation with his R / A, John Andrews, "a
good R / A and I respect him." John told Alex that "it would
take time" to work things out; he said he "couldn't say" if they
"would work out in a few weeks." Alex left John feeling
"quite gotxl" and that the situation "could and should be
worked out."
On Saturday, October 15, Fred talked to a number of
people in Naranja about the poster. In a long conversation
with R / F Griffin, he described his experience in England
related to being part Jewish. R / F Griffin advised Fred to be
very "contrite" at the house meeting the following day.
Alex and Fred spent the evening of Saturday, October 15
preparing their presentation for the Sunday meeting.
On Sunday morning Alex worked at his fcxxl service job.
Fred went to R / A Johnson's nxnn and asked to talk. They
agreed that he and Alex would return later that morning
before the emergency meeting.
Fred visited "as many [41 Naranja black residents as I
could." He told them that he had defaced the Beethoven
poster and that he hoped that they would come to the
emergency meeting to hear his explanation. 1 le explained to
us that he expected to continue to live with them and he was
afraid that if they heard about his actions from someone else
then they would not understand why he had done the poster.
Some of the visits also included discussions of race.
Sometime on the morning of October 16, Fred also went
to QC's rcxim. He told us that he told QC that the "poster was
not a personal attack" though "I can't give you anything other
than my word." He also told QC that he "knew about the
boning incident" and "[QC] should be aware | that Fred] was
going through something similar to what QC went through."
He said that QC said he was not planning to go to the
emergency meeting and Fred asked him to "please" go. QC
confirmed the visit but does not remember the details of what
Fred said since he was "half asleep." He dtx's remember
being asked if he were going to the emergency house meeting
and recalls answering in the affirmative.
Around 11:45 a.m. Alex and Fred went to R /A Johnson's
room to discuss their planned statement. They told her that
they would talk about their "subconscious racism" and admit
that they had been "drunk and stoned" when they defaced the
poster. R / A Johnson told them that the residents would not
"buy" these rationales.
Sunday, October 16: The Second Emergency House
Meeting.
Eighty toone hundred twenty persons, including about 30
Naranja residents, crowded into the Ujamaa lounge for the
Sunday, October 16 joint Ujamaa Naranja emergency house
meeting.

Fred told us that when he and Alex defaced the poster that
he thought that it was "tremendously tunny, a witty
x statement.'th" He elaborated that he was drunk and stoned
and that when he drinks he "feels that all [he does) is
important, relevant and right .th.th. more correct and pow
erful." He said that he never thought that people would be
offended.
Fred also related the poster defacing to experiences he
had in England. He said that his grandfather is a German
Jew. It was the custom for older students at his English
school to ask new students about their weaknesses and then
tease the new students about the weaknesses so the new
students would not take the weaknesses so seriously. Fred
had said that his "weakness" was being Jewish. The ensuing
teasing included saying that "Jew means miserly" and
putting a star of David on his door. He also said that when
he won arguments at his English school, the students would
sometimes say "stereotypical" things about Jews in reprisal.
Fred said that at first this teasing offended him, but by the
time he left the school he did not take it seriously and had
come to see the "humor as a release."
We asked Fred if he saw any parallels between his
English experiences and defacing the poster. He accepted
the analogy but responded that if anyone did a similar action
related to Jews that he would not be upset because of his
experience in England.
Fred also attributed the poster to his ignorance about the
American racial situation since he had been educated in
Canada and England: the most "I know about American
history is the fur trade." But he also attributed it to his
"arrogance and insensitivity" to others' feelings.
We pressed Fred as to why he did not put his name on the
poster. At first he hesitantly said that he "wanted to make a
statement, but not put his name behind the statement." He
said that he wanted to think about this more. He called back
a few days later and said that he had "just forgotten" to put
his name on the defaced poster.
Reactions to the Beethoven Poster.
In interviews we asked Ujamaa residents what their
reactions to the defaced poster had been. QC said that his
initial reaction was: that he was "flabbergasted. I couldn't
believe anybody would do that. You only see things like that
in the movies or on TV. It's the kind of thing someone would
do in their room and joke about but it didn't seem like anyone
would be bold enough to put it on a door." Ujamaa Resident
Assistant ("R / A") Rebecca Weiss, a senior, said the poster
was "hateful, shocking. I was outraged and sickened." T/A
Baldwin said "the Afro |on the poster| was a black stere
otype. To me the redeyes had an evil connotation. No human
being has eyes like that. The whole being looked very evil
_ devilish." But his further explanation is perhaps more il
luminating of the residents' reaction to the defaced poster.
He told us that the details of the poster were not important;
what was important was the drawers' intent to offend by
portraying a black person in a negative stereotype.
T / A Harold Brown, a sophomore, said, "|Fred| may
have intended it as a joke, but he knew, after orientation it
would piss the hell out of everyone.th.th.th. After all the pro
grams, how could he not have known!"
Events from October 1 to October 14.
Later in the day on October 1, QC showed the poster to
Ujamaa R / A John Andrews, a senior. They talked about the
obvious linkage to the Beethoven conversation and tried to
reconstruct a list of the participants. QC suspected Alex
from the beginning: "he was the only one who knew where
I lived and the only one who was real irate." The poster
passed through many hands in the following days. T / A
Baldwin had it for a time. Friends of QC's in another
dormitory had it. QC did not get it back until October 6 or
7.
Meanwhile word got around among the Ujamaa staff
about the defaced poster. Resident Fellow ("R / F") Mark
Brooks, a Stanford Development Officer, heard about it on
Sunday. October 2, and informed Richard Jamison, the As
sistant Dean of Student Affairs. R / F Brooks asked QC for
the poster on October 2. QC told him he did not have it. There
was some concern among the staff that QC and his friends
were going to "handle it themselves."
In the days following the posting of the defaced poster,
Fred said he felt "ashamed, guilty" and tried to "play mind
games" to "forget about it." Fred told us that he discussed the
poster with two friends, apparently to assuage his nervous
ness and with the hope that they would think it was "funny."
They did not. Both friends reacted that it was a "crazy" thing
to do. One of the friends, Charles Benson, told us that Fred
said QC was taking it [the poster] as a personal attack on
him. According to Charles, Fred said QC was a hypocrite "to
be so offended [by the poster hung outside his door]" since
QC "had done the same thing last year." 2
On at least two occasions during the period between
October I and 14, Fred engaged Bridges a senior and a black
Naranjaß/A, in discussion about the subjects of Beethoven's
blackness and her life as a black person. R / A Bridges took
Fred to the Ujamaa Black Culture library and showed him
a book which contained information about Beethoven's
ethnic origins. (Stephanie did not find out about the Beethoven
poster until October 14.)
A few days after the poster defacing, Fred sought the
advice of his Advising Associate ("A/A"), a junior. The A
/A told us that he had agreed with Fred that the poster was
"really stupid" but suggested that Fred do nothing and hope
that it would "blow over" since Fred had heard nothing
about the poster.
About two days after the poster defacing, an unidentified
person wrote in block letters on Alex's message pad. which
was tacked outside his door: "YOU SHALL PAY FOR
YOUR ACTIONS!" (Exhibit 3). And about a week after that
first message, someone wrote another unsigned note on the
pad in block letters which read: "TONITE IS THE NITE"
(Exhibit 4). Alex did not connect the first note to the
Beethoven conversation until he got the second note.
Alex and Fred told us that they had one or two conversa
tions during this period. Fred said he told Alex, "if people
find out, tell me about it. If you're going toconfess, tell them
about me as well."
2. Fred was referring to the so called "boning" incident
in which QC and some other male Ujamaa residents had
hung a sexist poster (apparently inspired by the movie School
Daze). The matter was dealt with in the house and by the
Dean of Student Affairs Office.
On Wednesday, October 5, at the regularly scheduled
Ujamaa staff meeting, T/A Brown reported the finding of
the Beethoven poster, saying, "we ought to find out who did
it and kick these guys out of the dorm." R / F Brooks arrived
late for the meeting. After he was briefed, there was further
discussion of what should be done. Someone suggested they
alert Dean Jamison and Robert Richardson. Associate Dean
of Student Affairs. Others wanted to handle the matter
within the house. Some also expressed concern about the
potential for negative publicity about the incident.
The group agreed that the person who defaced and posted
the Beethoven poster was probably one of the white partici
pants in the Beethoven conversation. Indeed, suspicion had
already begun to focus on Alex because of discussions that
had occurred during freshman orientation. T / A Elliot
Grossman, a senior, said: Alex was quite "vehement" and
seemed "to have a problem with the idea of (racial] differ
ences .th.th. offended by the idea that some people consider
themselves different." He seemed like a "nice guy" but he
"aired his opinions." He wanted others to "relax and focus
on the humanistic aspect of everyone" and could not see
why race or diversity was such a "big deal."
After some discussion as to whether an immediate house
meeting should be called, the staff decided to have a meeting
at 11 p.m. that night in R/ F Brooks' apartment with the
Beethoven conversation participants. The meeting did not
take place, apparently because QC and one or two of his
friends who had participated in the conversation did not
want to attend such a meeting. T / A Brown said that QC
"was. in a sense, afraid." From past experiences he felt "the
victim gets blamed" and that somehow the whole incident
might "be turned against him." According to one of the R /
As who talked to QC right after the October 5 meeting, QC
"was unwilling to make a commitment" and "didn't want to
become involved." In any event the upshot was that nothing
happened. No action was taken at that time nor did any of the
Ujamaa staff take action between that time and the next staff
meeting.
The next regularly scheduled Ujamaa staff meeting was
held on Wednesday, October 12. Once again the staff dis
cussed the Beethoven poster. By this time, a staff member
had gotten the poster from QC and it was shown at the
meeting. In the discussion, some argued that the Beethoven
poster issue should not be pursued: "It took too long to get the
poster. Let's drop it!" Others felt strongly that they should
pursue the matter and proceed with the earlier plan of
assembling the Beethoven conversation participants with the
aim of getting the culprit to confess. Still others felt the issue
should be raised at the Ujamaa full house meeting which was
to occur at 8 p.m. that same evening. When the staff meeting
broke up, some left with the impression that the issue of the
Beethoven poster would be raised at the house meeting that
night. It was not brought up, either because R / A Andrews,
who conducted the October 12 house meeting, decided not
to bring it up or because of "miscommunication."
The "Niggers" Poster.
Sometime on or before October 13, Ujamaa resident Paul •
Morris hung a poster near the Ujamaa lounge advertising a
dance at U.C. Berkeley, sponsored by Kappa Alpha Psi, a
black fraternity. About 2 a.m. on the morning of Friday,
October 14, Morris noticed the poster had fallen down. He
rehung it. When he passed by a few minutes later, the poster
had disappeared.
Meanwhile QC had been studying with Sidney Miller, a
Ujamaa resident in the A Wing at Ujamaa. At around 2:30
a.m. QC and Sidney walked toward QC's room in the B
Wing. As they passed a large bulletin board in the second
floor crosswalk between A and B Wings, they noticed the
Kappa Alpha Psi poster. Someone had scrawled the word
"NIGGERS" diagonally across it. (Exhibit 5 is a slightly
reduced photocopy of the defaced Kappa poster.) QC and
Sidney took the poster down, showed it to another friend and
discussed whether to notify residence staff. Later that morn
ing. when QC returned from classes, he showed the poster to
R / A Andrews and Marshall Klipp, a senior and the head A
/A. Several of the residence staff discussed it. They decided
to call an emergency house meeting for that night to discuss
both the "Niggers" and "Beethoven" posters.
While R / F Brooks was not involved in this decision, later
that day one of the staff told him about the meeting planned
for that night.
Friday, October 14: The First Emergency House
Meeting
R / A Mary Johnson, a senior, facilitated the October 14
emergency house meeting. R / F Brooks was going back and
forth between the meeting and a Black Alumni Weekend
meeting at Tresidder. There were about 75 or 80 people at the
meeting, including Alex and QC, but not including Fred.
Both posters were exhibited at the meeting which was
"very intense." All of the students who spoke were clearly
outraged by the posters. At some point R / A Johnson asked,
"does anybody want to stand up and admit to it now? If you
have any information let us know now or come to one of the
staff after the meeting."
Alex said nothing at the meeting. Alex told us that in his
opinion the meeting was so "heated and emotional" that there
was a "threat of violence" so "there was no way 1 was going
to come forward."
The October 14 meeting became, in the words of one of
the staff, "an occasion to release anger about many things" _
the Western Culture controversy, the Otero incident (and
what was viewed as the University's unwillingness to take
action against the accused Otero resident or the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity members who participated in the subsequent
"vigil,") and Residential Education for a "plot" to reduce the
number of blacks living in Ujamaa. The Beethoven and
Kappa Alpha Psi poster defacings became "one of many
grievances."
In addition to reactions of shock and anger, the deeper
reaction of many of the Ujamaa staff was one of "sadness."
During the 1987 to 1988 academic year there had been a lot
of "tension" at Ujamaa. This year during staff training there
was a "sense of new beginnings." The staff was "more
united," "congenial." "The freshmen seemed happy." As T/
A Grossman said: "Things were going really well until this!"
"There was greater friendliness among the students includ
ing lots of black and white friendships." With the discovery
of the posters, "all our efforts were shot."
Friday, October 14: The Identification of Fred and
Alex.
Immediately after the meeting, a white Ujamaa resi
dent told T / A Brown that this resident had heard
someone with an English accent say that he had
defaced the Beethoven poster.
T/A Brown, recalling that Fred had an English accent,
went to his room and asked Fred if he knew anything about
the Beethoven poster. Fred replied that "he'd heard of it." T
/A Brown then told Fred about the finding of the "Niggers"
poster. He said "people are really angry," "people are suspi
cious of you," and there are people planning "to beat the hell
out of you." Fred suggested they take a walk outside. Once
outside Fred admitted to T/A Brown that he had defaced the
Beethoven poster. T / A Brown asked if anyone else was
involved. Fred replied, "Before I tell you, let me tell you
why" and proceeded to give T / A Brown an explanation
similar to those he later made at the meeting with the Ujamaa
staff and in our later interview. (See infra and supra.) Fred
then identified Alex as the person who defaced the poster
with him.
T/ A Brown said Fred was "really nervous"; he "realized
the implications." According to T / A Brown, at one point.
Fred knelt down, seemingly in shock. T/A Brown told us that
Fred said that he thought the poster would "blow over" but
after their conversation he wanted to go to the house meeting
and "confess" so the residents could "let him have it [their
anger]" and he could "absorb it [ understand their reaction]."
We asked T / A Brown if in fact there were residents
planning to beat up Alex and Fred. He said no; that this was
a ruse to get Fred to tell the truth.
Since the emergency meeting was over, T/A Brown then
took Fred to R / A Johnson's room where the Ujamaa staff,
as well as Sally Stewart, a junior and President of the Black
Student Union and a former Ujamaa resident, then as
sembled. Fred told us that everyone was "calm" at the
meeting except Sally Stewart who started "yelling" at him.
At that point, R / A Patrick McAllister, a senior and the only
non-black on the Ujamaa staff, suggested that they call R / F
Brooks who arrived shortly thereafter.
T/A Brown said, "Fred has something to tell you." Fred
then told R / F Brooks that he had defaced the Beethoven
poster. When asked why, he said he was "drinking and
stoned." Also, "there was such an emphasis on ethnocentric
character .th.th. people were taking it too seriously .th.th.
wasn't what he was used to in England .th.th. thought he'd
make light of it." R / As Bridges, who is black, and Clark West
from Naranja were called in. (Naranja R / F Gary Griffin, a
doctoral student in psychology, was away and could not be
reached.) When R / A Bridges, whom Fred had got to know
quite well, entered, Fred began to cry.
Fred again identified Alex as the other participant. He said
"Alex is going to kill me [for identifying Alex]." Someone
had seen Alex earlier, drinking beer in another resident's
room. One of the staff went and got Alex and brought him to
R / A Johnson's room. Alex admitted his involvement. Alex's
explanation of why he did it was similar to Fred's. People
were "taking this whole thing of diversity too seriously." He
intended the poster as "a joke," "to make light of it." He also
alluded to his background, growing up in Chicago and said
his parents "hadn't raised him todo (racial ] things like that."
Alex said he was "drunk and stoned" but realized that was 110
excuse. According to R/ F Brooks. Alex and Fred's explana
tions seemed like attempts to justify or rationalize, "It didn't
sell with the staff."
The discussion then turned to what Fred and Alex should
do. R / F Brooks told them they would have to admit to the
Ujamaa community what they had done, and they would
have to apologize, without trying to rationalize. After consid
erable discussion, and varying views, as to what Fred and
Alex should do, it was left that they would prepare a "plan of
action" and deliver it to R / F Brtxiks the following morning
(Saturday). The staff decided to call an emergency house

Saturday morning. Later that morning Alex returned to talk
to R / F Brooks about it; according to Alex they had a 1-2
minute conversation about it. Ihe plan provides that Alex
and Fred would: (I )appearat the Sunday October 16 meeting

was "hateful, shocking. I was outraged and sickened." T/A
Baldwin said "the Afro |on the poster| was a black stere
otype. To me the redeyes had an evil connotation. No human
being has eyes like that. The whole being looked very evil
_ devilish." But his further explanation is perhaps more il
luminating of the residents' reaction to the defaced poster.
He told us that the details of the poster were not important;
what was important was the drawers' intent to offend by
portraying a black person in a negative stereotype.
T / A Harold Brown, a sophomore, said, "|Fred| may
have intended it as a joke, but he knew, after orientation it
would piss the hell out of everyone.th.th.th. After all the pro
grams, how could he not have known!"
Events from October 1 to October 14.
Later in the day on October 1, QC showed the poster to
Ujamaa R / A John Andrews, a senior. They talked about the
obvious linkage to the Beethoven conversation and tried to
reconstruct a list of the participants. QC suspected Alex
from the beginning: "he was the only one who knew where
I lived and the only one who was real irate." The poster
passed through many hands in the following days. T / A
Baldwin had it for a time. Friends of QC's in another
dormitory had it. QC did not get it back until October 6 or
7.
Meanwhile word got around among the Ujamaa staff
about the defaced poster. Resident Fellow ("R / F") Mark
Brooks, a Stanford Development Officer, heard about it on
Sunday. October 2, and informed Richard Jamison, the As
sistant Dean of Student Affairs. R / F Brooks asked QC for
the poster on October 2. QC told him he did not have it. There
was some concern among the staff that QC and his friends
were going to "handle it themselves."
In the days following the posting of the defaced poster,
Fred said he felt "ashamed, guilty" and tried to "play mind
games" to "forget about it." Fred told us that he discussed the
poster with two friends, apparently to assuage his nervous
ness and with the hope that they would think it was "funny."
They did not. Both friends reacted that it was a "crazy" thing
to do. One of the friends, Charles Benson, told us that Fred
said QC was taking it [the poster] as a personal attack on
him. According to Charles, Fred said QC was a hypocrite "to
be so offended [by the poster hung outside his door]" since
QC "had done the same thing last year." 2
On at least two occasions during the period between
October I and 14, Fred engaged Bridges a senior and a black
Naranjaß/A, in discussion about the subjects of Beethoven's
blackness and her life as a black person. R / A Bridges took
Fred to the Ujamaa Black Culture library and showed him
a book which contained information about Beethoven's
ethnic origins. (Stephanie did not find out about the Beethoven
poster until October 14.)
A few days after the poster defacing, Fred sought the
advice of his Advising Associate ("A/A"), a junior. The A
/A told us that he had agreed with Fred that the poster was
"really stupid" but suggested that Fred do nothing and hope
that it would "blow over" since Fred had heard nothing
about the poster.
About two days after the poster defacing, an unidentified
person wrote in block letters on Alex's message pad. which
was tacked outside his door: "YOU SHALL PAY FOR
YOUR ACTIONS!" (Exhibit 3). And about a week after that
first message, someone wrote another unsigned note on the
pad in block letters which read: "TONITE IS THE NITE"
(Exhibit 4). Alex did not connect the first note to the
Beethoven conversation until he got the second note.
Alex and Fred told us that they had one or two conversa
tions during this period. Fred said he told Alex, "if people
find out, tell me about it. If you're going toconfess, tell them
about me as well."
2. Fred was referring to the so called "boning" incident
in which QC and some other male Ujamaa residents had
hung a sexist poster (apparently inspired by the movie School
Daze). The matter was dealt with in the house and by the
Dean of Student Affairs Office.
On Wednesday, October 5, at the regularly scheduled
Ujamaa staff meeting, T/A Brown reported the finding of
the Beethoven poster, saying, "we ought to find out who did
it and kick these guys out of the dorm." R / F Brooks arrived
late for the meeting. After he was briefed, there was further
discussion of what should be done. Someone suggested they
alert Dean Jamison and Robert Richardson. Associate Dean
of Student Affairs. Others wanted to handle the matter
within the house. Some also expressed concern about the
potential for negative publicity about the incident.
The group agreed that the person who defaced and posted
the Beethoven poster was probably one of the white partici
pants in the Beethoven conversation. Indeed, suspicion had
already begun to focus on Alex because of discussions that
had occurred during freshman orientation. T / A Elliot
Grossman, a senior, said: Alex was quite "vehement" and
seemed "to have a problem with the idea of (racial] differ
ences .th.th. offended by the idea that some people consider
themselves different." He seemed like a "nice guy" but he
"aired his opinions." He wanted others to "relax and focus
on the humanistic aspect of everyone" and could not see
why race or diversity was such a "big deal."
After some discussion as to whether an immediate house
meeting should be called, the staff decided to have a meeting
at 11 p.m. that night in R/ F Brooks' apartment with the
Beethoven conversation participants. The meeting did not
take place, apparently because QC and one or two of his
friends who had participated in the conversation did not
want to attend such a meeting. T / A Brown said that QC
"was. in a sense, afraid." From past experiences he felt "the
victim gets blamed" and that somehow the whole incident
might "be turned against him." According to one of the R /
As who talked to QC right after the October 5 meeting, QC
"was unwilling to make a commitment" and "didn't want to
become involved." In any event the upshot was that nothing
happened. No action was taken at that time nor did any of the
Ujamaa staff take action between that time and the next staff
meeting.
The next regularly scheduled Ujamaa staff meeting was
held on Wednesday, October 12. Once again the staff dis
cussed the Beethoven poster. By this time, a staff member
had gotten the poster from QC and it was shown at the
meeting. In the discussion, some argued that the Beethoven
poster issue should not be pursued: "It took too long to get the
poster. Let's drop it!" Others felt strongly that they should
pursue the matter and proceed with the earlier plan of
assembling the Beethoven conversation participants with the
aim of getting the culprit to confess. Still others felt the issue
should be raised at the Ujamaa full house meeting which was
to occur at 8 p.m. that same evening. When the staff meeting
broke up, some left with the impression that the issue of the
Beethoven poster would be raised at the house meeting that
night. It was not brought up, either because R / A Andrews,
who conducted the October 12 house meeting, decided not
to bring it up or because of "miscommunication."
The "Niggers" Poster.
Sometime on or before October 13, Ujamaa resident Paul •
Morris hung a poster near the Ujamaa lounge advertising a
dance at U.C. Berkeley, sponsored by Kappa Alpha Psi, a
black fraternity. About 2 a.m. on the morning of Friday,
October 14, Morris noticed the poster had fallen down. He
rehung it. When he passed by a few minutes later, the poster
had disappeared.
Meanwhile QC had been studying with Sidney Miller, a
Ujamaa resident in the A Wing at Ujamaa. At around 2:30
a.m. QC and Sidney walked toward QC's room in the B
Wing. As they passed a large bulletin board in the second
floor crosswalk between A and B Wings, they noticed the
Kappa Alpha Psi poster. Someone had scrawled the word
"NIGGERS" diagonally across it. (Exhibit 5 is a slightly
reduced photocopy of the defaced Kappa poster.) QC and
Sidney took the poster down, showed it to another friend and
discussed whether to notify residence staff. Later that morn
ing. when QC returned from classes, he showed the poster to
R / A Andrews and Marshall Klipp, a senior and the head A
/A. Several of the residence staff discussed it. They decided
to call an emergency house meeting for that night to discuss
both the "Niggers" and "Beethoven" posters.
While R / F Brooks was not involved in this decision, later
that day one of the staff told him about the meeting planned
for that night.
Friday, October 14: The First Emergency House
Meeting
R / A Mary Johnson, a senior, facilitated the October 14
emergency house meeting. R / F Brooks was going back and
forth between the meeting and a Black Alumni Weekend
meeting at Tresidder. There were about 75 or 80 people at the
meeting, including Alex and QC, but not including Fred.
Both posters were exhibited at the meeting which was
"very intense." All of the students who spoke were clearly
outraged by the posters. At some point R / A Johnson asked,
"does anybody want to stand up and admit to it now? If you
have any information let us know now or come to one of the
staff after the meeting."
Alex said nothing at the meeting. Alex told us that in his
opinion the meeting was so "heated and emotional" that there
was a "threat of violence" so "there was no way 1 was going
to come forward."
The October 14 meeting became, in the words of one of
the staff, "an occasion to release anger about many things" _
the Western Culture controversy, the Otero incident (and
what was viewed as the University's unwillingness to take
action against the accused Otero resident or the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity members who participated in the subsequent
"vigil,") and Residential Education for a "plot" to reduce the
number of blacks living in Ujamaa. The Beethoven and
Kappa Alpha Psi poster defacings became "one of many
grievances."
In addition to reactions of shock and anger, the deeper
reaction of many of the Ujamaa staff was one of "sadness."
During the 1987 to 1988 academic year there had been a lot
of "tension" at Ujamaa. This year during staff training there
was a "sense of new beginnings." The staff was "more
united," "congenial." "The freshmen seemed happy." As T/
A Grossman said: "Things were going really well until this!"
"There was greater friendliness among the students includ
ing lots of black and white friendships." With the discovery
of the posters, "all our efforts were shot."
Friday, October 14: The Identification of Fred and
Alex.
Immediately after the meeting, a white Ujamaa resi
dent told T / A Brown that this resident had heard
someone with an English accent say that he had
defaced the Beethoven poster.
T/A Brown, recalling that Fred had an English accent,
went to his room and asked Fred if he knew anything about
the Beethoven poster. Fred replied that "he'd heard of it." T
/A Brown then told Fred about the finding of the "Niggers"
poster. He said "people are really angry," "people are suspi
cious of you," and there are people planning "to beat the hell
out of you." Fred suggested they take a walk outside. Once
outside Fred admitted to T/A Brown that he had defaced the
Beethoven poster. T / A Brown asked if anyone else was
involved. Fred replied, "Before I tell you, let me tell you
why" and proceeded to give T / A Brown an explanation
similar to those he later made at the meeting with the Ujamaa
staff and in our later interview. (See infra and supra.) Fred
then identified Alex as the person who defaced the poster
with him.
T/ A Brown said Fred was "really nervous"; he "realized
the implications." According to T / A Brown, at one point.
Fred knelt down, seemingly in shock. T/A Brown told us that
Fred said that he thought the poster would "blow over" but
after their conversation he wanted to go to the house meeting
and "confess" so the residents could "let him have it [their
anger]" and he could "absorb it [ understand their reaction]."
We asked T / A Brown if in fact there were residents
planning to beat up Alex and Fred. He said no; that this was
a ruse to get Fred to tell the truth.
Since the emergency meeting was over, T/A Brown then
took Fred to R / A Johnson's room where the Ujamaa staff,
as well as Sally Stewart, a junior and President of the Black
Student Union and a former Ujamaa resident, then as
sembled. Fred told us that everyone was "calm" at the
meeting except Sally Stewart who started "yelling" at him.
At that point, R / A Patrick McAllister, a senior and the only
non-black on the Ujamaa staff, suggested that they call R / F
Brooks who arrived shortly thereafter.
T/A Brown said, "Fred has something to tell you." Fred
then told R / F Brooks that he had defaced the Beethoven
poster. When asked why, he said he was "drinking and
stoned." Also, "there was such an emphasis on ethnocentric
character .th.th. people were taking it too seriously .th.th.
wasn't what he was used to in England .th.th. thought he'd
make light of it." R / As Bridges, who is black, and Clark West
from Naranja were called in. (Naranja R / F Gary Griffin, a
doctoral student in psychology, was away and could not be
reached.) When R / A Bridges, whom Fred had got to know
quite well, entered, Fred began to cry.
Fred again identified Alex as the other participant. He said
"Alex is going to kill me [for identifying Alex]." Someone
had seen Alex earlier, drinking beer in another resident's
room. One of the staff went and got Alex and brought him to
R / A Johnson's room. Alex admitted his involvement. Alex's
explanation of why he did it was similar to Fred's. People
were "taking this whole thing of diversity too seriously." He
intended the poster as "a joke," "to make light of it." He also
alluded to his background, growing up in Chicago and said
his parents "hadn't raised him todo (racial ] things like that."
Alex said he was "drunk and stoned" but realized that was 110
excuse. According to R/ F Brooks. Alex and Fred's explana
tions seemed like attempts to justify or rationalize, "It didn't
sell with the staff."
The discussion then turned to what Fred and Alex should
do. R / F Brooks told them they would have to admit to the
Ujamaa community what they had done, and they would
have to apologize, without trying to rationalize. After consid
erable discussion, and varying views, as to what Fred and
Alex should do, it was left that they would prepare a "plan of
action" and deliver it to R / F Brtxiks the following morning
(Saturday). The staff decided to call an emergency house
meeting for noon, Sunday, at which Fred and Alex would
appear. Fred and Alex were anxious for this chance to talk to
the residents.
Alex and Fred's plan of action is Exhibit 6. R / F Brooks
found the plan of action under his door around 8:30 a.m.
Saturday morning. Later that morning Alex returned to talk
to R / F Brooks about it; according to Alex they had a 1-2
minute conversation about it. Ihe plan provides that Alex
and Fred would: (I )appearat the Sunday October 16 meeting
"to discuss |thei|r motives and receive the responses ot the
audience"; (2) write a letter to the Stanford Daily discussing
the incident: and (3) perhaps take "further steps" after they
had "absorbed the reactions." In view of subsequent events,
we note that the plan docs not provide for an apology.
In his interview Fred told us that at the informal October
14 meeting in R / A Johnson's room "he was in a state of
shock." After all his "mind games" he was facing "reality."
He saw the faces looking at him "impassively, with disgust."
He also sensed a "weariness" from the Ujamaa stall, that "all
their educational efforts at orientation amounted to nothing."
He said Sally Stewart's "yelling" at him upset him.
Alex said that some in the group were "angry," "hostile,"
though R/ F Brix)ks was "matter of fact," as if saying, "the
ball's in your court. What are you going to do now?" Alex
said he (Alex) became "very distraught" and "broke down."
Preparation for the Sunday, October 16 Meeting.
Naranja R / F Griffin told us that he had "mixed feelings"
about the planned Sunday meeting and was concerned about
the"due process" issues; that the Ujamaa statt had "forced"
Alex and Fred to attend the Sunday meeting. Griffin added
that he, however, felt "disempowered." "Ujamaa wanted
control. Faced with the choice, 1 decided to give it to them.
I didn't feel qualified to judge the impact the incident had 011
the blacks in Ujamaa." He did not raise these concerns with
the Ujamaa staff. Indeed*he staffs did not plan a joint strategy
for the joint meeting. As we note above, Alex and Fred
wanted the Sunday meeting as a forum to explain their
conduct.
Naranja staff had posted notice of the "mandatory" Sun
day joint meeting. But Naranja residents were largely unin
formed about the facts. Naranja staff had decided it was better
to let them learn the facts at the meeting; therefore they
declined to answer Naranja residents' questions about the
purpose of the meeting.
Alex told us that he thought that the "rebuilding" would
have to occur on a "one-on-one basis" and in "smaller
groups." He felt that he had begun the process in a Saturday,
October 15 conversation with his R / A, John Andrews, "a
good R / A and I respect him." John told Alex that "it would
take time" to work things out; he said he "couldn't say" if they
"would work out in a few weeks." Alex left John feeling
"quite gotxl" and that the situation "could and should be
worked out."
On Saturday, October 15, Fred talked to a number of
people in Naranja about the poster. In a long conversation
with R / F Griffin, he described his experience in England
related to being part Jewish. R / F Griffin advised Fred to be
very "contrite" at the house meeting the following day.
Alex and Fred spent the evening of Saturday, October 15
preparing their presentation for the Sunday meeting.
On Sunday morning Alex worked at his fcxxl service job.
Fred went to R / A Johnson's nxnn and asked to talk. They
agreed that he and Alex would return later that morning
before the emergency meeting.
Fred visited "as many [41 Naranja black residents as I
could." He told them that he had defaced the Beethoven
poster and that he hoped that they would come to the
emergency meeting to hear his explanation. 1 le explained to
us that he expected to continue to live with them and he was
afraid that if they heard about his actions from someone else
then they would not understand why he had done the poster.
Some of the visits also included discussions of race.
Sometime on the morning of October 16, Fred also went
to QC's rcxim. He told us that he told QC that the "poster was
not a personal attack" though "I can't give you anything other
than my word." He also told QC that he "knew about the
boning incident" and "[QC] should be aware | that Fred] was
going through something similar to what QC went through."
He said that QC said he was not planning to go to the
emergency meeting and Fred asked him to "please" go. QC
confirmed the visit but does not remember the details of what
Fred said since he was "half asleep." He dtx's remember
being asked if he were going to the emergency house meeting
and recalls answering in the affirmative.
Around 11:45 a.m. Alex and Fred went to R /A Johnson's
room to discuss their planned statement. They told her that
they would talk about their "subconscious racism" and admit
that they had been "drunk and stoned" when they defaced the
poster. R / A Johnson told them that the residents would not
"buy" these rationales.
Sunday, October 16: The Second Emergency House
Meeting.
Eighty toone hundred twenty persons, including about 30
Naranja residents, crowded into the Ujamaa lounge for the
Sunday, October 16 joint Ujamaa Naranja emergency house
meeting.

Fred told us that when he and Alex defaced the poster that
he thought that it was "tremendously tunny, a witty
x statement.'th" He elaborated that he was drunk and stoned
and that when he drinks he "feels that all [he does) is
important, relevant and right .th.th. more correct and pow
erful." He said that he never thought that people would be
offended.
Fred also related the poster defacing to experiences he
had in England. He said that his grandfather is a German
Jew. It was the custom for older students at his English
school to ask new students about their weaknesses and then
tease the new students about the weaknesses so the new
students would not take the weaknesses so seriously. Fred
had said that his "weakness" was being Jewish. The ensuing
teasing included saying that "Jew means miserly" and
putting a star of David on his door. He also said that when
he won arguments at his English school, the students would
sometimes say "stereotypical" things about Jews in reprisal.
Fred said that at first this teasing offended him, but by the
time he left the school he did not take it seriously and had
come to see the "humor as a release."
We asked Fred if he saw any parallels between his
English experiences and defacing the poster. He accepted
the analogy but responded that if anyone did a similar action
related to Jews that he would not be upset because of his
experience in England.
Fred also attributed the poster to his ignorance about the
American racial situation since he had been educated in
Canada and England: the most "I know about American
history is the fur trade." But he also attributed it to his
"arrogance and insensitivity" to others' feelings.
We pressed Fred as to why he did not put his name on the
poster. At first he hesitantly said that he "wanted to make a
statement, but not put his name behind the statement." He
said that he wanted to think about this more. He called back
a few days later and said that he had "just forgotten" to put
his name on the defaced poster.
Reactions to the Beethoven Poster.
In interviews we asked Ujamaa residents what their
reactions to the defaced poster had been. QC said that his
initial reaction was: that he was "flabbergasted. I couldn't
believe anybody would do that. You only see things like that
in the movies or on TV. It's the kind of thing someone would
do in their room and joke about but it didn't seem like anyone
would be bold enough to put it on a door." Ujamaa Resident
Assistant ("R / A") Rebecca Weiss, a senior, said the poster
was "hateful, shocking. I was outraged and sickened." T/A
Baldwin said "the Afro |on the poster| was a black stere
otype. To me the redeyes had an evil connotation. No human
being has eyes like that. The whole being looked very evil
_ devilish." But his further explanation is perhaps more il
luminating of the residents' reaction to the defaced poster.
He told us that the details of the poster were not important;
what was important was the drawers' intent to offend by
portraying a black person in a negative stereotype.
T / A Harold Brown, a sophomore, said, "|Fred| may

for that night.
Friday, October 14: The First Emergency House
Meeting
R / A Mary Johnson, a senior, facilitated the October 14
emergency house meeting. R / F Brooks was going back and
forth between the meeting and a Black Alumni Weekend
meeting at Tresidder. There were about 75 or 80 people at the
meeting, including Alex and QC, but not including Fred.
Both posters were exhibited at the meeting which was
"very intense." All of the students who spoke were clearly
outraged by the posters. At some point R / A Johnson asked,
"does anybody want to stand up and admit to it now? If you
have any information let us know now or come to one of the
staff after the meeting."
Alex said nothing at the meeting. Alex told us that in his
opinion the meeting was so "heated and emotional" that there
was a "threat of violence" so "there was no way 1 was going
to come forward."
The October 14 meeting became, in the words of one of
the staff, "an occasion to release anger about many things" _
the Western Culture controversy, the Otero incident (and
what was viewed as the University's unwillingness to take
action against the accused Otero resident or the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity members who participated in the subsequent
"vigil,") and Residential Education for a "plot" to reduce the
number of blacks living in Ujamaa. The Beethoven and
Kappa Alpha Psi poster defacings became "one of many
grievances."
In addition to reactions of shock and anger, the deeper
reaction of many of the Ujamaa staff was one of "sadness."
During the 1987 to 1988 academic year there had been a lot
of "tension" at Ujamaa. This year during staff training there
was a "sense of new beginnings." The staff was "more
united," "congenial." "The freshmen seemed happy." As T/
A Grossman said: "Things were going really well until this!"
"There was greater friendliness among the students includ
ing lots of black and white friendships." With the discovery
of the posters, "all our efforts were shot."
Friday, October 14: The Identification of Fred and
Alex.
Immediately after the meeting, a white Ujamaa resi
dent told T / A Brown that this resident had heard
someone with an English accent say that he had
defaced the Beethoven poster.
T/A Brown, recalling that Fred had an English accent,
went to his room and asked Fred if he knew anything about
the Beethoven poster. Fred replied that "he'd heard of it." T
/A Brown then told Fred about the finding of the "Niggers"
poster. He said "people are really angry," "people are suspi
cious of you," and there are people planning "to beat the hell
out of you." Fred suggested they take a walk outside. Once
outside Fred admitted to T/A Brown that he had defaced the
Beethoven poster. T / A Brown asked if anyone else was
involved. Fred replied, "Before I tell you, let me tell you
why" and proceeded to give T / A Brown an explanation
similar to those he later made at the meeting with the Ujamaa
staff and in our later interview. (See infra and supra.) Fred
then identified Alex as the person who defaced the poster
with him.
T/ A Brown said Fred was "really nervous"; he "realized
the implications." According to T / A Brown, at one point.
Fred knelt down, seemingly in shock. T/A Brown told us that
Fred said that he thought the poster would "blow over" but
after their conversation he wanted to go to the house meeting
and "confess" so the residents could "let him have it [their
anger]" and he could "absorb it [ understand their reaction]."
We asked T / A Brown if in fact there were residents
planning to beat up Alex and Fred. He said no; that this was
a ruse to get Fred to tell the truth.
Since the emergency meeting was over, T/A Brown then
took Fred to R / A Johnson's room where the Ujamaa staff,
as well as Sally Stewart, a junior and President of the Black
Student Union and a former Ujamaa resident, then as
sembled. Fred told us that everyone was "calm" at the
meeting except Sally Stewart who started "yelling" at him.
At that point, R / A Patrick McAllister, a senior and the only
non-black on the Ujamaa staff, suggested that they call R / F
Brooks who arrived shortly thereafter.
T/A Brown said, "Fred has something to tell you." Fred
then told R / F Brooks that he had defaced the Beethoven
poster. When asked why, he said he was "drinking and
stoned." Also, "there was such an emphasis on ethnocentric
character .th.th. people were taking it too seriously .th.th.
wasn't what he was used to in England .th.th. thought he'd
make light of it." R / As Bridges, who is black, and Clark West
from Naranja were called in. (Naranja R / F Gary Griffin, a
doctoral student in psychology, was away and could not be
reached.) When R / A Bridges, whom Fred had got to know
quite well, entered, Fred began to cry.
Fred again identified Alex as the other participant. He said
"Alex is going to kill me [for identifying Alex]." Someone
had seen Alex earlier, drinking beer in another resident's
room. One of the staff went and got Alex and brought him to
R / A Johnson's room. Alex admitted his involvement. Alex's
explanation of why he did it was similar to Fred's. People
were "taking this whole thing of diversity too seriously." He
intended the poster as "a joke," "to make light of it." He also
alluded to his background, growing up in Chicago and said
his parents "hadn't raised him todo (racial ] things like that."
Alex said he was "drunk and stoned" but realized that was 110
excuse. According to R/ F Brooks. Alex and Fred's explana
tions seemed like attempts to justify or rationalize, "It didn't
sell with the staff."
The discussion then turned to what Fred and Alex should
do. R / F Brooks told them they would have to admit to the
Ujamaa community what they had done, and they would
have to apologize, without trying to rationalize. After consid
erable discussion, and varying views, as to what Fred and
Alex should do, it was left that they would prepare a "plan of
action" and deliver it to R / F Brtxiks the following morning
(Saturday). The staff decided to call an emergency house
meeting for noon, Sunday, at which Fred and Alex would
appear. Fred and Alex were anxious for this chance to talk to
the residents.
Alex and Fred's plan of action is Exhibit 6. R / F Brooks
found the plan of action under his door around 8:30 a.m.
Saturday morning. Later that morning Alex returned to talk
to R / F Brooks about it; according to Alex they had a 1-2
minute conversation about it. Ihe plan provides that Alex
and Fred would: (I )appearat the Sunday October 16 meeting
"to discuss |thei|r motives and receive the responses ot the
audience"; (2) write a letter to the Stanford Daily discussing
the incident: and (3) perhaps take "further steps" after they
had "absorbed the reactions." In view of subsequent events,
we note that the plan docs not provide for an apology.
In his interview Fred told us that at the informal October
14 meeting in R / A Johnson's room "he was in a state of
shock." After all his "mind games" he was facing "reality."
He saw the faces looking at him "impassively, with disgust."
He also sensed a "weariness" from the Ujamaa stall, that "all
their educational efforts at orientation amounted to nothing."
He said Sally Stewart's "yelling" at him upset him.
Alex said that some in the group were "angry," "hostile,"
though R/ F Brix)ks was "matter of fact," as if saying, "the
ball's in your court. What are you going to do now?" Alex
said he (Alex) became "very distraught" and "broke down."
Preparation for the Sunday, October 16 Meeting.
Naranja R / F Griffin told us that he had "mixed feelings"
about the planned Sunday meeting and was concerned about
the"due process" issues; that the Ujamaa statt had "forced"
Alex and Fred to attend the Sunday meeting. Griffin added
that he, however, felt "disempowered." "Ujamaa wanted
control. Faced with the choice, 1 decided to give it to them.
I didn't feel qualified to judge the impact the incident had 011
the blacks in Ujamaa." He did not raise these concerns with
the Ujamaa staff. Indeed*he staffs did not plan a joint strategy
for the joint meeting. As we note above, Alex and Fred
wanted the Sunday meeting as a forum to explain their
conduct.
Naranja staff had posted notice of the "mandatory" Sun
day joint meeting. But Naranja residents were largely unin
formed about the facts. Naranja staff had decided it was better
to let them learn the facts at the meeting; therefore they
declined to answer Naranja residents' questions about the
purpose of the meeting.
Alex told us that he thought that the "rebuilding" would
have to occur on a "one-on-one basis" and in "smaller
groups." He felt that he had begun the process in a Saturday,
October 15 conversation with his R / A, John Andrews, "a
good R / A and I respect him." John told Alex that "it would
take time" to work things out; he said he "couldn't say" if they
"would work out in a few weeks." Alex left John feeling
"quite gotxl" and that the situation "could and should be
worked out."
On Saturday, October 15, Fred talked to a number of
people in Naranja about the poster. In a long conversation
with R / F Griffin, he described his experience in England
related to being part Jewish. R / F Griffin advised Fred to be
very "contrite" at the house meeting the following day.
Alex and Fred spent the evening of Saturday, October 15
preparing their presentation for the Sunday meeting.
On Sunday morning Alex worked at his fcxxl service job.
Fred went to R / A Johnson's nxnn and asked to talk. They
agreed that he and Alex would return later that morning
before the emergency meeting.
Fred visited "as many [41 Naranja black residents as I
could." He told them that he had defaced the Beethoven
poster and that he hoped that they would come to the
emergency meeting to hear his explanation. 1 le explained to
us that he expected to continue to live with them and he was
afraid that if they heard about his actions from someone else
then they would not understand why he had done the poster.
Some of the visits also included discussions of race.
Sometime on the morning of October 16, Fred also went
to QC's rcxim. He told us that he told QC that the "poster was
not a personal attack" though "I can't give you anything other
than my word." He also told QC that he "knew about the
boning incident" and "[QC] should be aware | that Fred] was
going through something similar to what QC went through."
He said that QC said he was not planning to go to the
emergency meeting and Fred asked him to "please" go. QC
confirmed the visit but does not remember the details of what
Fred said since he was "half asleep." He dtx's remember
being asked if he were going to the emergency house meeting
and recalls answering in the affirmative.
Around 11:45 a.m. Alex and Fred went to R /A Johnson's
room to discuss their planned statement. They told her that
they would talk about their "subconscious racism" and admit
that they had been "drunk and stoned" when they defaced the
poster. R / A Johnson told them that the residents would not
"buy" these rationales.
Sunday, October 16: The Second Emergency House
Meeting.
Eighty toone hundred twenty persons, including about 30
Naranja residents, crowded into the Ujamaa lounge for the
Sunday, October 16 joint Ujamaa Naranja emergency house
meeting.

Fred told us that when he and Alex defaced the poster that
he thought that it was "tremendously tunny, a witty
x statement.'th" He elaborated that he was drunk and stoned
and that when he drinks he "feels that all [he does) is
important, relevant and right .th.th. more correct and pow
erful." He said that he never thought that people would be
offended.
Fred also related the poster defacing to experiences he
had in England. He said that his grandfather is a German
Jew. It was the custom for older students at his English
school to ask new students about their weaknesses and then
tease the new students about the weaknesses so the new
students would not take the weaknesses so seriously. Fred
had said that his "weakness" was being Jewish. The ensuing
teasing included saying that "Jew means miserly" and
putting a star of David on his door. He also said that when
he won arguments at his English school, the students would
sometimes say "stereotypical" things about Jews in reprisal.
Fred said that at first this teasing offended him, but by the
time he left the school he did not take it seriously and had
come to see the "humor as a release."
We asked Fred if he saw any parallels between his
English experiences and defacing the poster. He accepted
the analogy but responded that if anyone did a similar action
related to Jews that he would not be upset because of his
experience in England.
Fred also attributed the poster to his ignorance about the
American racial situation since he had been educated in
Canada and England: the most "I know about American
history is the fur trade." But he also attributed it to his
"arrogance and insensitivity" to others' feelings.
We pressed Fred as to why he did not put his name on the
poster. At first he hesitantly said that he "wanted to make a
statement, but not put his name behind the statement." He
said that he wanted to think about this more. He called back
a few days later and said that he had "just forgotten" to put
his name on the defaced poster.
Reactions to the Beethoven Poster.
In interviews we asked Ujamaa residents what their
reactions to the defaced poster had been. QC said that his
initial reaction was: that he was "flabbergasted. I couldn't
believe anybody would do that. You only see things like that
in the movies or on TV. It's the kind of thing someone would
do in their room and joke about but it didn't seem like anyone
would be bold enough to put it on a door." Ujamaa Resident
Assistant ("R / A") Rebecca Weiss, a senior, said the poster
was "hateful, shocking. I was outraged and sickened." T/A
Baldwin said "the Afro |on the poster| was a black stere
otype. To me the redeyes had an evil connotation. No human
being has eyes like that. The whole being looked very evil
_ devilish." But his further explanation is perhaps more il
luminating of the residents' reaction to the defaced poster.
He told us that the details of the poster were not important;
what was important was the drawers' intent to offend by
portraying a black person in a negative stereotype.
T / A Harold Brown, a sophomore, said, "|Fred| may
have intended it as a joke, but he knew, after orientation it
would piss the hell out of everyone.th.th.th. After all the pro
grams, how could he not have known!"
Events from October 1 to October 14.
Later in the day on October 1, QC showed the poster to
Ujamaa R / A John Andrews, a senior. They talked about the
obvious linkage to the Beethoven conversation and tried to
reconstruct a list of the participants. QC suspected Alex
from the beginning: "he was the only one who knew where
I lived and the only one who was real irate." The poster
passed through many hands in the following days. T / A
Baldwin had it for a time. Friends of QC's in another
dormitory had it. QC did not get it back until October 6 or
7.
Meanwhile word got around among the Ujamaa staff
about the defaced poster. Resident Fellow ("R / F") Mark
Brooks, a Stanford Development Officer, heard about it on
Sunday. October 2, and informed Richard Jamison, the As
sistant Dean of Student Affairs. R / F Brooks asked QC for
the poster on October 2. QC told him he did not have it. There
was some concern among the staff that QC and his friends
were going to "handle it themselves."
In the days following the posting of the defaced poster,
Fred said he felt "ashamed, guilty" and tried to "play mind
games" to "forget about it." Fred told us that he discussed the
poster with two friends, apparently to assuage his nervous
ness and with the hope that they would think it was "funny."
They did not. Both friends reacted that it was a "crazy" thing
to do. One of the friends, Charles Benson, told us that Fred
said QC was taking it [the poster] as a personal attack on
him. According to Charles, Fred said QC was a hypocrite "to
be so offended [by the poster hung outside his door]" since
QC "had done the same thing last year." 2
On at least two occasions during the period between
October I and 14, Fred engaged Bridges a senior and a black
Naranjaß/A, in discussion about the subjects of Beethoven's
blackness and her life as a black person. R / A Bridges took
Fred to the Ujamaa Black Culture library and showed him
a book which contained information about Beethoven's
ethnic origins. (Stephanie did not find out about the Beethoven
poster until October 14.)
A few days after the poster defacing, Fred sought the
advice of his Advising Associate ("A/A"), a junior. The A
/A told us that he had agreed with Fred that the poster was
"really stupid" but suggested that Fred do nothing and hope
that it would "blow over" since Fred had heard nothing
about the poster.
About two days after the poster defacing, an unidentified
person wrote in block letters on Alex's message pad. which
was tacked outside his door: "YOU SHALL PAY FOR
YOUR ACTIONS!" (Exhibit 3). And about a week after that
first message, someone wrote another unsigned note on the
pad in block letters which read: "TONITE IS THE NITE"
(Exhibit 4). Alex did not connect the first note to the
Beethoven conversation until he got the second note.
Alex and Fred told us that they had one or two conversa
tions during this period. Fred said he told Alex, "if people
find out, tell me about it. If you're going toconfess, tell them
about me as well."
2. Fred was referring to the so called "boning" incident
in which QC and some other male Ujamaa residents had
hung a sexist poster (apparently inspired by the movie School
Daze). The matter was dealt with in the house and by the
Dean of Student Affairs Office.
On Wednesday, October 5, at the regularly scheduled
Ujamaa staff meeting, T/A Brown reported the finding of
the Beethoven poster, saying, "we ought to find out who did
it and kick these guys out of the dorm." R / F Brooks arrived
late for the meeting. After he was briefed, there was further
discussion of what should be done. Someone suggested they
alert Dean Jamison and Robert Richardson. Associate Dean
of Student Affairs. Others wanted to handle the matter
within the house. Some also expressed concern about the
potential for negative publicity about the incident.
The group agreed that the person who defaced and posted
the Beethoven poster was probably one of the white partici
pants in the Beethoven conversation. Indeed, suspicion had
already begun to focus on Alex because of discussions that
had occurred during freshman orientation. T / A Elliot
Grossman, a senior, said: Alex was quite "vehement" and
seemed "to have a problem with the idea of (racial] differ
ences .th.th. offended by the idea that some people consider
themselves different." He seemed like a "nice guy" but he
"aired his opinions." He wanted others to "relax and focus
on the humanistic aspect of everyone" and could not see
why race or diversity was such a "big deal."
After some discussion as to whether an immediate house
meeting should be called, the staff decided to have a meeting
at 11 p.m. that night in R/ F Brooks' apartment with the
Beethoven conversation participants. The meeting did not
take place, apparently because QC and one or two of his
friends who had participated in the conversation did not
want to attend such a meeting. T / A Brown said that QC
"was. in a sense, afraid." From past experiences he felt "the
victim gets blamed" and that somehow the whole incident
might "be turned against him." According to one of the R /
As who talked to QC right after the October 5 meeting, QC
"was unwilling to make a commitment" and "didn't want to
become involved." In any event the upshot was that nothing
happened. No action was taken at that time nor did any of the
Ujamaa staff take action between that time and the next staff
meeting.
The next regularly scheduled Ujamaa staff meeting was
held on Wednesday, October 12. Once again the staff dis
cussed the Beethoven poster. By this time, a staff member
had gotten the poster from QC and it was shown at the
meeting. In the discussion, some argued that the Beethoven
poster issue should not be pursued: "It took too long to get the
poster. Let's drop it!" Others felt strongly that they should
pursue the matter and proceed with the earlier plan of
assembling the Beethoven conversation participants with the
aim of getting the culprit to confess. Still others felt the issue
should be raised at the Ujamaa full house meeting which was
to occur at 8 p.m. that same evening. When the staff meeting
broke up, some left with the impression that the issue of the
Beethoven poster would be raised at the house meeting that
night. It was not brought up, either because R / A Andrews,
who conducted the October 12 house meeting, decided not
to bring it up or because of "miscommunication."
The "Niggers" Poster.
Sometime on or before October 13, Ujamaa resident Paul •
Morris hung a poster near the Ujamaa lounge advertising a
dance at U.C. Berkeley, sponsored by Kappa Alpha Psi, a
black fraternity. About 2 a.m. on the morning of Friday,
October 14, Morris noticed the poster had fallen down. He
rehung it. When he passed by a few minutes later, the poster
had disappeared.
Meanwhile QC had been studying with Sidney Miller, a
Ujamaa resident in the A Wing at Ujamaa. At around 2:30
a.m. QC and Sidney walked toward QC's room in the B
Wing. As they passed a large bulletin board in the second
floor crosswalk between A and B Wings, they noticed the
Kappa Alpha Psi poster. Someone had scrawled the word
"NIGGERS" diagonally across it. (Exhibit 5 is a slightly
reduced photocopy of the defaced Kappa poster.) QC and
Sidney took the poster down, showed it to another friend and
discussed whether to notify residence staff. Later that morn
ing. when QC returned from classes, he showed the poster to
R / A Andrews and Marshall Klipp, a senior and the head A
/A. Several of the residence staff discussed it. They decided
to call an emergency house meeting for that night to discuss
both the "Niggers" and "Beethoven" posters.
While R / F Brooks was not involved in this decision, later
that day one of the staff told him about the meeting planned
for that night.
Friday, October 14: The First Emergency House

R / A Mary Johnson, a senior, facilitated the October 14

Naranja staff had posted notice of the "mandatory" Sun
day joint meeting. But Naranja residents were largely unin
formed about the facts. Naranja staff had decided it was better
to let them learn the facts at the meeting; therefore they
declined to answer Naranja residents' questions about the
purpose of the meeting.
Alex told us that he thought that the "rebuilding" would
have to occur on a "one-on-one basis" and in "smaller
groups." He felt that he had begun the process in a Saturday,
October 15 conversation with his R / A, John Andrews, "a
good R / A and I respect him." John told Alex that "it would
take time" to work things out; he said he "couldn't say" if they
"would work out in a few weeks." Alex left John feeling
"quite gotxl" and that the situation "could and should be
worked out."
On Saturday, October 15, Fred talked to a number of
people in Naranja about the poster. In a long conversation
with R / F Griffin, he described his experience in England
related to being part Jewish. R / F Griffin advised Fred to be
very "contrite" at the house meeting the following day.
Alex and Fred spent the evening of Saturday, October 15
preparing their presentation for the Sunday meeting.
On Sunday morning Alex worked at his fcxxl service job.
Fred went to R / A Johnson's nxnn and asked to talk. They
agreed that he and Alex would return later that morning
before the emergency meeting.
Fred visited "as many [41 Naranja black residents as I
could." He told them that he had defaced the Beethoven
poster and that he hoped that they would come to the
emergency meeting to hear his explanation. 1 le explained to
us that he expected to continue to live with them and he was
afraid that if they heard about his actions from someone else
then they would not understand why he had done the poster.
Some of the visits also included discussions of race.
Sometime on the morning of October 16, Fred also went
to QC's rcxim. He told us that he told QC that the "poster was
not a personal attack" though "I can't give you anything other
than my word." He also told QC that he "knew about the
boning incident" and "[QC] should be aware | that Fred] was
going through something similar to what QC went through."
He said that QC said he was not planning to go to the
emergency meeting and Fred asked him to "please" go. QC
confirmed the visit but does not remember the details of what
Fred said since he was "half asleep." He dtx's remember
being asked if he were going to the emergency house meeting
and recalls answering in the affirmative.
Around 11:45 a.m. Alex and Fred went to R /A Johnson's
room to discuss their planned statement. They told her that
they would talk about their "subconscious racism" and admit
that they had been "drunk and stoned" when they defaced the
poster. R / A Johnson told them that the residents would not
"buy" these rationales.
Sunday, October 16: The Second Emergency House
Meeting.
Eighty toone hundred twenty persons, including about 30
Naranja residents, crowded into the Ujamaa lounge for the
Sunday, October 16 joint Ujamaa Naranja emergency house

Fred told us that when he and Alex defaced the poster that
he thought that it was "tremendously tunny, a witty
x statement.'th" He elaborated that he was drunk and stoned
and that when he drinks he "feels that all [he does) is
important, relevant and right .th.th. more correct and pow
erful." He said that he never thought that people would be
offended.
Fred also related the poster defacing to experiences he
had in England. He said that his grandfather is a German
Jew. It was the custom for older students at his English
school to ask new students about their weaknesses and then
tease the new students about the weaknesses so the new
students would not take the weaknesses so seriously. Fred
had said that his "weakness" was being Jewish. The ensuing
teasing included saying that "Jew means miserly" and
putting a star of David on his door. He also said that when
he won arguments at his English school, the students would
sometimes say "stereotypical" things about Jews in reprisal.
Fred said that at first this teasing offended him, but by the
time he left the school he did not take it seriously and had
come to see the "humor as a release."
We asked Fred if he saw any parallels between his
English experiences and defacing the poster. He accepted
the analogy but responded that if anyone did a similar action
related to Jews that he would not be upset because of his
experience in England.
Fred also attributed the poster to his ignorance about the
American racial situation since he had been educated in
Canada and England: the most "I know about American
history is the fur trade." But he also attributed it to his
"arrogance and insensitivity" to others' feelings.
We pressed Fred as to why he did not put his name on the
poster. At first he hesitantly said that he "wanted to make a
statement, but not put his name behind the statement." He
said that he wanted to think about this more. He called back
a few days later and said that he had "just forgotten" to put
his name on the defaced poster.
Reactions to the Beethoven Poster.
In interviews we asked Ujamaa residents what their
reactions to the defaced poster had been. QC said that his
initial reaction was: that he was "flabbergasted. I couldn't
believe anybody would do that. You only see things like that
in the movies or on TV. It's the kind of thing someone would
do in their room and joke about but it didn't seem like anyone
would be bold enough to put it on a door." Ujamaa Resident
Assistant ("R / A") Rebecca Weiss, a senior, said the poster
was "hateful, shocking. I was outraged and sickened." T/A
Baldwin said "the Afro |on the poster| was a black stere
otype. To me the redeyes had an evil connotation. No human
being has eyes like that. The whole being looked very evil
_ devilish." But his further explanation is perhaps more il
luminating of the residents' reaction to the defaced poster.
He told us that the details of the poster were not important;
what was important was the drawers' intent to offend by
portraying a black person in a negative stereotype.
T / A Harold Brown, a sophomore, said, "|Fred| may
have intended it as a joke, but he knew, after orientation it
would piss the hell out of everyone.th.th.th. After all the pro
grams, how could he not have known!"
Events from October 1 to October 14.
Later in the day on October 1, QC showed the poster to
Ujamaa R / A John Andrews, a senior. They talked about the
obvious linkage to the Beethoven conversation and tried to
reconstruct a list of the participants. QC suspected Alex
from the beginning: "he was the only one who knew where
I lived and the only one who was real irate." The poster
passed through many hands in the following days. T / A
Baldwin had it for a time. Friends of QC's in another
dormitory had it. QC did not get it back until October 6 or
7.
Meanwhile word got around among the Ujamaa staff
about the defaced poster. Resident Fellow ("R / F") Mark
Brooks, a Stanford Development Officer, heard about it on
Sunday. October 2, and informed Richard Jamison, the As
sistant Dean of Student Affairs. R / F Brooks asked QC for
the poster on October 2. QC told him he did not have it. There
was some concern among the staff that QC and his friends
were going to "handle it themselves."
In the days following the posting of the defaced poster,
Fred said he felt "ashamed, guilty" and tried to "play mind
games" to "forget about it." Fred told us that he discussed the
poster with two friends, apparently to assuage his nervous
ness and with the hope that they would think it was "funny."
They did not. Both friends reacted that it was a "crazy" thing
to do. One of the friends, Charles Benson, told us that Fred
said QC was taking it [the poster] as a personal attack on
him. According to Charles, Fred said QC was a hypocrite "to
be so offended [by the poster hung outside his door]" since
QC "had done the same thing last year." 2
On at least two occasions during the period between
October I and 14, Fred engaged Bridges a senior and a black
Naranjaß/A, in discussion about the subjects of Beethoven's
blackness and her life as a black person. R / A Bridges took
Fred to the Ujamaa Black Culture library and showed him
a book which contained information about Beethoven's
ethnic origins. (Stephanie did not find out about the Beethoven
poster until October 14.)
A few days after the poster defacing, Fred sought the
advice of his Advising Associate ("A/A"), a junior. The A
/A told us that he had agreed with Fred that the poster was
"really stupid" but suggested that Fred do nothing and hope
that it would "blow over" since Fred had heard nothing
about the poster.
About two days after the poster defacing, an unidentified
person wrote in block letters on Alex's message pad. which
was tacked outside his door: "YOU SHALL PAY FOR
YOUR ACTIONS!" (Exhibit 3). And about a week after that
first message, someone wrote another unsigned note on the
pad in block letters which read: "TONITE IS THE NITE"
(Exhibit 4). Alex did not connect the first note to the
Beethoven conversation until he got the second note.
Alex and Fred told us that they had one or two conversa
tions during this period. Fred said he told Alex, "if people
find out, tell me about it. If you're going toconfess, tell them
about me as well."
2. Fred was referring to the so called "boning" incident
in which QC and some other male Ujamaa residents had
hung a sexist poster (apparently inspired by the movie School
Daze). The matter was dealt with in the house and by the
Dean of Student Affairs Office.
On Wednesday, October 5, at the regularly scheduled
Ujamaa staff meeting, T/A Brown reported the finding of
the Beethoven poster, saying, "we ought to find out who did
it and kick these guys out of the dorm." R / F Brooks arrived
late for the meeting. After he was briefed, there was further
discussion of what should be done. Someone suggested they
alert Dean Jamison and Robert Richardson. Associate Dean
of Student Affairs. Others wanted to handle the matter
within the house. Some also expressed concern about the
potential for negative publicity about the incident.
The group agreed that the person who defaced and posted
the Beethoven poster was probably one of the white partici
pants in the Beethoven conversation. Indeed, suspicion had
already begun to focus on Alex because of discussions that
had occurred during freshman orientation. T / A Elliot
Grossman, a senior, said: Alex was quite "vehement" and
seemed "to have a problem with the idea of (racial] differ
ences .th.th. offended by the idea that some people consider
themselves different." He seemed like a "nice guy" but he
"aired his opinions." He wanted others to "relax and focus
on the humanistic aspect of everyone" and could not see
why race or diversity was such a "big deal."
After some discussion as to whether an immediate house
meeting should be called, the staff decided to have a meeting
at 11 p.m. that night in R/ F Brooks' apartment with the
Beethoven conversation participants. The meeting did not
take place, apparently because QC and one or two of his
friends who had participated in the conversation did not
want to attend such a meeting. T / A Brown said that QC
"was. in a sense, afraid." From past experiences he felt "the
victim gets blamed" and that somehow the whole incident
might "be turned against him." According to one of the R /
As who talked to QC right after the October 5 meeting, QC
"was unwilling to make a commitment" and "didn't want to
become involved." In any event the upshot was that nothing
happened. No action was taken at that time nor did any of the
Ujamaa staff take action between that time and the next staff
meeting.
The next regularly scheduled Ujamaa staff meeting was
held on Wednesday, October 12. Once again the staff dis
cussed the Beethoven poster. By this time, a staff member
had gotten the poster from QC and it was shown at the
meeting. In the discussion, some argued that the Beethoven
poster issue should not be pursued: "It took too long to get the
poster. Let's drop it!" Others felt strongly that they should
pursue the matter and proceed with the earlier plan of
assembling the Beethoven conversation participants with the
aim of getting the culprit to confess. Still others felt the issue
should be raised at the Ujamaa full house meeting which was
to occur at 8 p.m. that same evening. When the staff meeting
broke up, some left with the impression that the issue of the
Beethoven poster would be raised at the house meeting that
night. It was not brought up, either because R / A Andrews,
who conducted the October 12 house meeting, decided not
to bring it up or because of "miscommunication."
The "Niggers" Poster.
Sometime on or before October 13, Ujamaa resident Paul •
Morris hung a poster near the Ujamaa lounge advertising a
dance at U.C. Berkeley, sponsored by Kappa Alpha Psi, a
black fraternity. About 2 a.m. on the morning of Friday,
October 14, Morris noticed the poster had fallen down. He
rehung it. When he passed by a few minutes later, the poster
had disappeared.
Meanwhile QC had been studying with Sidney Miller, a
Ujamaa resident in the A Wing at Ujamaa. At around 2:30
a.m. QC and Sidney walked toward QC's room in the B
Wing. As they passed a large bulletin board in the second
floor crosswalk between A and B Wings, they noticed the
Kappa Alpha Psi poster. Someone had scrawled the word
"NIGGERS" diagonally across it. (Exhibit 5 is a slightly
reduced photocopy of the defaced Kappa poster.) QC and
Sidney took the poster down, showed it to another friend and
discussed whether to notify residence staff. Later that morn
ing. when QC returned from classes, he showed the poster to
R / A Andrews and Marshall Klipp, a senior and the head A
/A. Several of the residence staff discussed it. They decided
to call an emergency house meeting for that night to discuss
both the "Niggers" and "Beethoven" posters.
While R / F Brooks was not involved in this decision, later
that day one of the staff told him about the meeting planned
for that night.
Friday, October 14: The First Emergency House
Meeting
R / A Mary Johnson, a senior, facilitated the October 14
emergency house meeting. R / F Brooks was going back and
forth between the meeting and a Black Alumni Weekend
meeting at Tresidder. There were about 75 or 80 people at the
meeting, including Alex and QC, but not including Fred.
Both posters were exhibited at the meeting which was
"very intense." All of the students who spoke were clearly
outraged by the posters. At some point R / A Johnson asked,
"does anybody want to stand up and admit to it now? If you
have any information let us know now or come to one of the
staff after the meeting."
Alex said nothing at the meeting. Alex told us that in his
opinion the meeting was so "heated and emotional" that there
was a "threat of violence" so "there was no way 1 was going
to come forward."
The October 14 meeting became, in the words of one of
the staff, "an occasion to release anger about many things" _
the Western Culture controversy, the Otero incident (and
what was viewed as the University's unwillingness to take
action against the accused Otero resident or the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity members who participated in the subsequent
"vigil,") and Residential Education for a "plot" to reduce the
number of blacks living in Ujamaa. The Beethoven and
Kappa Alpha Psi poster defacings became "one of many
grievances."
In addition to reactions of shock and anger, the deeper
reaction of many of the Ujamaa staff was one of "sadness."
During the 1987 to 1988 academic year there had been a lot
of "tension" at Ujamaa. This year during staff training there
was a "sense of new beginnings." The staff was "more
united," "congenial." "The freshmen seemed happy." As T/
A Grossman said: "Things were going really well until this!"
"There was greater friendliness among the students includ
ing lots of black and white friendships." With the discovery
of the posters, "all our efforts were shot."
Friday, October 14: The Identification of Fred and
Alex.
Immediately after the meeting, a white Ujamaa resi
dent told T / A Brown that this resident had heard
someone with an English accent say that he had
defaced the Beethoven poster.
T/A Brown, recalling that Fred had an English accent,
went to his room and asked Fred if he knew anything about
the Beethoven poster. Fred replied that "he'd heard of it." T
/A Brown then told Fred about the finding of the "Niggers"
poster. He said "people are really angry," "people are suspi
cious of you," and there are people planning "to beat the hell
out of you." Fred suggested they take a walk outside. Once
outside Fred admitted to T/A Brown that he had defaced the
Beethoven poster. T / A Brown asked if anyone else was
involved. Fred replied, "Before I tell you, let me tell you
why" and proceeded to give T / A Brown an explanation
similar to those he later made at the meeting with the Ujamaa
staff and in our later interview. (See infra and supra.) Fred
then identified Alex as the person who defaced the poster
with him.
T/ A Brown said Fred was "really nervous"; he "realized
the implications." According to T / A Brown, at one point.
Fred knelt down, seemingly in shock. T/A Brown told us that
Fred said that he thought the poster would "blow over" but
after their conversation he wanted to go to the house meeting
and "confess" so the residents could "let him have it [their
anger]" and he could "absorb it [ understand their reaction]."
We asked T / A Brown if in fact there were residents
planning to beat up Alex and Fred. He said no; that this was
a ruse to get Fred to tell the truth.
Since the emergency meeting was over, T/A Brown then
took Fred to R / A Johnson's room where the Ujamaa staff,
as well as Sally Stewart, a junior and President of the Black
Student Union and a former Ujamaa resident, then as
sembled. Fred told us that everyone was "calm" at the
meeting except Sally Stewart who started "yelling" at him.
At that point, R / A Patrick McAllister, a senior and the only
non-black on the Ujamaa staff, suggested that they call R / F
Brooks who arrived shortly thereafter.
T/A Brown said, "Fred has something to tell you." Fred
then told R / F Brooks that he had defaced the Beethoven
poster. When asked why, he said he was "drinking and
stoned." Also, "there was such an emphasis on ethnocentric
character .th.th. people were taking it too seriously .th.th.
wasn't what he was used to in England .th.th. thought he'd
make light of it." R / As Bridges, who is black, and Clark West
from Naranja were called in. (Naranja R / F Gary Griffin, a
doctoral student in psychology, was away and could not be
reached.) When R / A Bridges, whom Fred had got to know
quite well, entered, Fred began to cry.
Fred again identified Alex as the other participant. He said
"Alex is going to kill me [for identifying Alex]." Someone
had seen Alex earlier, drinking beer in another resident's
room. One of the staff went and got Alex and brought him to
R / A Johnson's room. Alex admitted his involvement. Alex's
explanation of why he did it was similar to Fred's. People
were "taking this whole thing of diversity too seriously." He
intended the poster as "a joke," "to make light of it." He also
alluded to his background, growing up in Chicago and said
his parents "hadn't raised him todo (racial ] things like that."
Alex said he was "drunk and stoned" but realized that was 110
excuse. According to R/ F Brooks. Alex and Fred's explana
tions seemed like attempts to justify or rationalize, "It didn't
sell with the staff."
The discussion then turned to what Fred and Alex should
do. R / F Brooks told them they would have to admit to the
Ujamaa community what they had done, and they would
have to apologize, without trying to rationalize. After consid
erable discussion, and varying views, as to what Fred and
Alex should do, it was left that they would prepare a "plan of
action" and deliver it to R / F Brtxiks the following morning
(Saturday). The staff decided to call an emergency house
meeting for noon, Sunday, at which Fred and Alex would
appear. Fred and Alex were anxious for this chance to talk to
the residents.
Alex and Fred's plan of action is Exhibit 6. R / F Brooks
found the plan of action under his door around 8:30 a.m.
Saturday morning. Later that morning Alex returned to talk
to R / F Brooks about it; according to Alex they had a 1-2
minute conversation about it. Ihe plan provides that Alex
and Fred would: (I )appearat the Sunday October 16 meeting
"to discuss |thei|r motives and receive the responses ot the
audience"; (2) write a letter to the Stanford Daily discussing
the incident: and (3) perhaps take "further steps" after they
had "absorbed the reactions." In view of subsequent events,
we note that the plan docs not provide for an apology.
In his interview Fred told us that at the informal October
14 meeting in R / A Johnson's room "he was in a state of
shock." After all his "mind games" he was facing "reality."
He saw the faces looking at him "impassively, with disgust."
He also sensed a "weariness" from the Ujamaa stall, that "all
their educational efforts at orientation amounted to nothing."
He said Sally Stewart's "yelling" at him upset him.
Alex said that some in the group were "angry," "hostile,"
though R/ F Brix)ks was "matter of fact," as if saying, "the
ball's in your court. What are you going to do now?" Alex
said he (Alex) became "very distraught" and "broke down."
Preparation for the Sunday, October 16 Meeting.
Naranja R / F Griffin told us that he had "mixed feelings"
about the planned Sunday meeting and was concerned about
the"due process" issues; that the Ujamaa statt had "forced"
Alex and Fred to attend the Sunday meeting. Griffin added
that he, however, felt "disempowered." "Ujamaa wanted
control. Faced with the choice, 1 decided to give it to them.
I didn't feel qualified to judge the impact the incident had 011
the blacks in Ujamaa." He did not raise these concerns with
the Ujamaa staff. Indeed*he staffs did not plan a joint strategy
for the joint meeting. As we note above, Alex and Fred
wanted the Sunday meeting as a forum to explain their
conduct.
Naranja staff had posted notice of the "mandatory" Sun
day joint meeting. But Naranja residents were largely unin
formed about the facts. Naranja staff had decided it was better
to let them learn the facts at the meeting; therefore they
declined to answer Naranja residents' questions about the

"would work out in a few weeks." Alex left John feeling
"quite gotxl" and that the situation "could and should be

people in Naranja about the poster. In a long conversation
with R / F Griffin, he described his experience in England
