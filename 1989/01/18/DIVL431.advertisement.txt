R / A Andrews started the meeting at around 12 noon. R
/ F Brcxiks did not arrive until around 12:20 p.m. R / A
Andrews said: "we're here to hear what these two residents
have to say and have to respect them for coming forward." I le
then turned to R / A Johnson who introduced Alex and Fred
as the persons who defaced the Beethoven poster. She
jokingly remarked: "Pleasedon't anybody kill anybody, I'm
not up for it."
At no time during the meeting did anyone provide a
summary account or explanation of the events of the previ
ous two and a half weeks. Neither of the posters was
displayed. Naranja R / [â€¢ Grift in and others told us that some
in the audience may have mistakenly thought Alex and Fred
had defaced both the Beethoven and the Niggers posters and
that this may have contributed to the tension.
Since the October 14 emergency house meeting, the
posters had been the subject of innumerable conversations
among Ujamaa residents. R / A Weiss told us that the meeting
was emotionally "charged" from the start.
Alex and Fred's Speech.
Alex and Fred followed R / A Johnson. Fred had sug
gested before the meeting, "Let me handle this, 1 like to
speak. If only one of us speaks maybe that's an easier way to
do it." Alex agreed to this plan. Alex later told us that his
agreeing to let Fred do the talking was "a big mistake." They
talked for about 15 minutes. Fred said that he now realizes
that he began with an "arrogant analytical tone" and "made
errors from the start."
Fred began by saying they had defaced the Beethoven
poster but not the Kappa Alpha Psi poster. 1 He then said that
there were "two things |he and Alex | wanted to do": (I) We
"want to explain ourselves" and (2) "hear your reaction." He
continued, "I don't know if what you want is an apology.""!
mean sorry', what the fuck does that mean, that's just a
word." "We know an apology won't be enough so we won't
even say it."
He said he and Alex were "drunk and stoned" when they
defaced the poster but this was "no excuse." He went on to
say they "didn't think of themselves as racists" but that the
drunken state had brought to the fore certain subconscious
"things in | their | psyches," of which they had not been aware.
Fred told the crowd that he and Alex were from "multi
racial environments" where "race was not the focus of
attention." He was "shocked to come |to Stanford) and find
people cared so much about race." This "offended" him. He
thought it was "stupid." He had been overwhelmed by the
emphasis on "ethnic differences and pluralism in orienta
tion." He spoke of his negative reaction to being "con
fronted" with "assertive" and "aggressive ethnicity."
Fred said that he and Alex "had got fed up with all the talk
about race" and thought defacing the poster was a "g(xxl op
portunity to show the black students how ridiculous it was to
focus on i ace." He said that they had no idea that defacing the
poster would be taken "seriously"; that they thought of it as
a "joke." He also spoke of the defaced poster as "satirical
humor" or having a "satirical message."
Fred said that he and Alex did not realize the "implica
tions" of defacing the poster.
Fred said that "before [ he | knew Beethoven was black he
had had a certain image of Beethoven and hearing he was
black changed his perception of Beethoven and made him
see Beethoven as the person he drew in the picture." He went
on to say that "Beethoven was a very rageful and powerful
figure and that was what he drew in the poster." He said the
fact of Beethoven's blackness had more support than he had
originally thought.
3. The summary of Alex and Fred's remarks is culled
from our interviews with Alex, Fred and other persons who
attended the meeting. There were minor variations in the
accounts which we do not discuss; for the most part we do not
attribute quotations to specific interviewees.
Both Alex and Fred said that they had "black friends who
didn 't make a point of racial differences." Alex spoke of his
experiences of living in a poor, predominantly black Indian
apolis neighborhood when a young child and later of living
on the south side of Chicago and being discriminated against
because he was white. He also said that at Stanford "there was
so much focus on race, it was a sh<x:k to me." He spoke of the
defaced poster as "food for thought" for the thought board,
"educational" and "avant xarde" art.
Fred offered to do a research paper on Beethoven and
donate a lxx>k about Alexander Pushkin to the Ujamaa
archives. He made the Pushkin offer because he had recently
learned that the Russian writer had black ancestry.
Ujamaa resident Lisa Farrell interrupted Fred's discourse
with: "You arrogant bastard, how dare you come here and not
even apologize. I want an apology." Fred looked toward Alex
with the implied suggestion that they answer in unison. Fred
responded: "Ok. I, 2, 3, we're sorry."
Alex did not join in this remark. Immediately after Fred
made it. Alex said: "I owe everyone a big apology, I hope
everything can be worked out, I'm really sorry. I realize how
much I hurt the house."
But the damage had been done. R / A Weiss described
Fred's apology, which many thought flippant, as the first
"stab in the baek"of the meeting. Alex's belated apology was
ignored in the negative reaction that Fred's comment crys
talized.
Fred told us that as soon as he made the inappropriate
remark he realized that "he had lost the right to say anything
else" at the meeting. In fact. Alex and Fred said little more for
the remainder of the meeting.
Alex and Fred's Fxplanations and Reaction.
We asked Fred why he did not apologize for defacing the
poster. Fred said that his first thought when he had gone to R
/ A Johnson's rcxmi on October 14 was that he "must apolo
gize"; but when he saw the "impassive faces" behind which
was "revulsion and disgust" for Alex and himself, he could
not do so. Instead, he wanted to "explain [his and Alex's|
subconscious so the residents would think of them as indi
viduals" instead of looking at "the bigger picture" and seeing
them as "symbols of white oppression and racial tension." He
also said that he felt an apology would be inadequate because
he thought the black students had a history of racial insults
and would think of him as "another silly white boy who
thinks if he apologizes everything will be OK." He says he
thought "These people don't want an apology from me"; that
he felt "inadequate" and therefore "couldn't apologize." He
also said that though he heard Resident Farrell say she
wanted an apology, he did not apologize because he was not
thinking of her but was "still thinking that the group [ was not
thinking of Alex and him| as individuals."
We asked Alex w hat his thoughts on the Sunday meeting
were. He told us that he was "scared." He was "not indignant"
about the meeting because he "felt very responsible and
needed to be punished." He was pessimistic about the meet
ing working because the crowd was too large. When he
entered the lounge on Sunday R / A Andrews had encourag
ingly patted him on the back.
Alex said that he was "shocked" at Fred's "complete stu
pidity" in saying "1,2,3, we're sorry." He feels that Fred is
sometimes perceived as arrogant because of his manner and
English accent. He thought Fred's nodding while other resi
dents spoke was indicative of a desire to hear more of w hat
they had to say.
Reaction to Alex and Fred's Speech.
The Ujamaa residents with whom we spoke had ex
tremely and consistently negative reactions to Alex and
Fred's statements and manner at the meeting both when they
spoke and w hen other residents subsequently spoke. One
resident referred to their failure to give a sincere apology as
the "big mistake"; this failure angered and surprised most of
the Ujamaa residents. Loretta Cronin (a junior and an Uja
maa resident at the meeting) expressed the opinion that the
meeting would have been totally different if Alex and Fred
had apologized differently. R / A Weiss and T / A Brown
expressed the opinion that the incident could have been
handled in the house if Alex and Fred had given a sincere
apology. As resident Brown put it:"the dorm would be happy
and peachy keen." Naranja R / A Clark West said the 1,2,3
"trivialized" the apology ..."the apology wasn't the great
est."
Other Ujamaa residents said that when Alex and Fred
spoke of their "subconscious racism" it was as if one could
"feel the room heat up"; "the more they talked, the more they
dug themselves into a hole"; and when they finished, it was
as if a "thundercloud were over the room." R / A Johnson
dismissed the statements about subconscious racism as
"ridiculous."To the Ujamaa residents, Alex and Fred seemed
to be trying to "manipulate" the meeting and evade respon
sibility for defacing the poster with their talk of subconscious
racism, drunkenness, and the impact on them of ethnicity at
Stanford and the pluralism component of orientation.
The Ujamaa residents perceived Alex and Fred's attitude
and "body language" as "arrogant." "incredibly arrogant,"
"insincere," "condescending," "patronizing," "not very in
terested," "not caring," "nonchalant," and "not listening" to
the black students who spoke during the discussion. R / F
Brooks said that when others spoke Alex and Fred were
"whispering," apparently making "casual statements" about
the speakers; in his opinion this was "very inappropriate." R
/A Andrews told us that Alex and Fred's actions "trivialized
Ujamaa." Ujamaa residents were upset that Alex and Fred
still did not appear to understand why they found the defacing
of the poster offensive. It grated that Alex and Fred seemed
inattentive or would nod their heads and say "uh huh." as if
to say "I already know that" when Ujamaa residents spoke.
T / A Baldwin told us that they did not "seem sorry." To R /
A Johnson, Alex and Fred seemed "uppity"; she interpreted
Alex's comparative silence as if he were thinking "I don't
care what you do to me"; she thought he was "just looking at
the hurt people and didn't care."
Jack Mitchell, a white Ujamaa freshman who had not re
quested assignment to Ujamaa and who describes his back
ground as "conservative," said that he first thought Alex and
Fred were "sincere." But the more they talked, the more it
"seemed as if they were just trying to pacify people and get
it over with." I le came to the Sunday meeting hoping to "see
someone who recognized they had hurt" the Ujamaa resi
dents; instead Alex and Fred's remarks made him feel
"ashamed" that they were so "insensitive."
R / F Griffin told us that Alex and Fred "came across as
unaware" of the extent to which an apology was necessary.
He perceived some of their statements as "conciliatory" and
others as "argumentative." R / F Griffin subsequently told
Fred that "arrogant was not an inappropriate characteriza
tion" of what Fred said at the meeting. He. however, per
ceived the nodding of the head, which most Ujamaa residents
thought condescending, as conciliatory.
Dean Jamison's Comments.
If there had been any hope that a consensus would evolve
around a resolution that would permit Alex and Fred to
continue as Lagunita residents, it w as destroyed the moment
"1,2,3. we're sorry" was uttered. The remark was followed
by a hostile clamor to have Alex and Fred removed from
Lagunita. The speakers made increasingly bitter and angry
remarks about, among other subjects, racial intolerance at
Stanford, the unreasonableness of expecting Ujamaa resi
dents toeducate Alex and Fred about racism, the University's
inabililty to deal with racial incidents â€” as demonstrated by
its response to the Otero matter and subsequent vigil, the
Western Culture debate, students wearing "Aryan by the
grace of God" T-shirts. Residential Education policies about
Ujamaaâ€”andthe absolute unacceptability of allowing Alex
and Fred to continue as Lagunita residents.
Many of these remarks were directed at Dean Jamison. R
/ A Johnson described Dean Jamison to us as "a figure of
authority .th.th. a person [who is] very much trusted and
respected in the black community." The students looked to
him for the University's response to w hat they now saw as an
intolerable situation.
Dean Jamison told the residents that "the incident was a
learning experience" for them and that Alex and Fred would
remain at Lagunita so the residents could educate them about
racism. He said it was a house problem that must be handled
internally by the residents. He told the residents that it was
"ridiculous to assume [that Stanford or they J could move
racism around" or "isolate" themselves from it and that it was
"important [for them| to leam that Stanford was not Utopia."
Dean Jamison also told the residents that he was "38 and had
dealt with racism all of my life"; he minimized the signifi
cance of the defaced poster in comparison to racial incidents
that he had suffered in the 19605.
Reaction to Dean Jamison's Speech.
R / F Griffin told us that Dean Jamison "made a strong
case for treating (the matter J in the house."
Most other persons with whom we spoke disagreed with
Dean Jamison's remarks. A recurring criticism was that he
was not listening to the students. R / A Weiss described his
remarks as the "second stab in the back" of the aftemixjn. R
/ A Andrews described them as "a slap in the face to the
Uj[amaa| residents," a "real kicker": it was as if Dean
Jamison were saying its "your problem and you deal with it."
Many of the residents thought Dean Jamison was giving a
"bureaucratic" Stanford position with which he was not
entirely comfortable; T / A Stacy Hamilton, a junior, said that
T / A Rene Moore, a junior, said if Alex and Fred's apology
had been sincere and if Dean Jamison had been "open to
student suggestions" the atmosphere at the meeting would
have been different.
em According to R /F Brooks, the residents "lit into | Dean
Jamison |as if Alex and Fred weren't there"; and the "meeting
turned into a verbal duel with Richard."One resident said that
several students vituperatively "attacked" Dean Jamison in
a "loud" and "insulting" manner that made her "very sad."
Sally Stewart and Loretta Cronin spoke at the meeting.
Loretta Cronin told us that she questioned Dean Jamison
about how the students could change his mind about not
removing Alex and Fred in a way that "may have come off
seeming hostile."
Dean Jamison elevated his voice as the students fired
questions and comments at him.
R / F Brooks thought the meeting was not going very well
when he arrived. The "statements were too long, some
students [were| getting recycled," there seemed to be no
ground rules and the remarks were becoming more "per
sonal." and there were not enough comments from white
residents. He did not however take control of the meeting; he
did tell R / A Andrews to get names of students who wanted
to talk and had not gotten a chance.
We asked Dean Jamison what his thoughts were on his
comments at the meeting. He said in retrospect that he "didn't
read the situation well." R / F Brooks had not told him about
the emotions at the October 14 meeting. Dean Jamison
admitted that he had "spewed out the standard [Residential
Education) line' but he had "no basis to work with the
fundamental standard as he knew of "no judicial prece
dents ' treating racial incidents as violations of the funda
mental standard.
QC's Speech.
The focus of the meeting shifted a second time when
QC spoke. His talk was the meeting's emotional
apex. Estimates of its length ranged from one and
a half to ten minutes. QC's passion surprised other
Ujamaa residents who did not think of him as a
"sensitive, emotional kind of guy." 4
QC told us that he had little reaction to Alex and Fred's
statements at the Sunday meeting. He characterized them as
4. The summary of QC's thoughts, talk, and actions is
culled from our interviews with QC and other persons who
attended the meeting. There were minor variations in the
accounts which we do not discuss; for the most part we do not
attribute quotations to specific interviewees. It was some
times difficult to distinguish between the statements that QC
made at the meeting, his thoughts, and the statements he
made in our interview.

student suggestions" the atmosphere at the meeting would
have been different.
em According to R /F Brooks, the residents "lit into | Dean
Jamison |as if Alex and Fred weren't there"; and the "meeting
turned into a verbal duel with Richard."One resident said that
several students vituperatively "attacked" Dean Jamison in
a "loud" and "insulting" manner that made her "very sad."
Sally Stewart and Loretta Cronin spoke at the meeting.
Loretta Cronin told us that she questioned Dean Jamison
about how the students could change his mind about not
removing Alex and Fred in a way that "may have come off
seeming hostile."
Dean Jamison elevated his voice as the students fired
questions and comments at him.
R / F Brooks thought the meeting was not going very well
when he arrived. The "statements were too long, some
students [were| getting recycled," there seemed to be no
ground rules and the remarks were becoming more "per
sonal." and there were not enough comments from white
residents. He did not however take control of the meeting; he
did tell R / A Andrews to get names of students who wanted
to talk and had not gotten a chance.
We asked Dean Jamison what his thoughts were on his
comments at the meeting. He said in retrospect that he "didn't
read the situation well." R / F Brooks had not told him about
the emotions at the October 14 meeting. Dean Jamison
admitted that he had "spewed out the standard [Residential
Education) line' but he had "no basis to work with the
fundamental standard as he knew of "no judicial prece
dents ' treating racial incidents as violations of the funda
mental standard.
QC's Speech.
The focus of the meeting shifted a second time when
QC spoke. His talk was the meeting's emotional
apex. Estimates of its length ranged from one and
a half to ten minutes. QC's passion surprised other
Ujamaa residents who did not think of him as a
"sensitive, emotional kind of guy." 4
QC told us that he had little reaction to Alex and Fred's
statements at the Sunday meeting. He characterized them as

times difficult to distinguish between the statements that QC
made at the meeting, his thoughts, and the statements he
made in our interview.

R / A Andrews started the meeting at around 12 noon. R
/ F Brcxiks did not arrive until around 12:20 p.m. R / A
Andrews said: "we're here to hear what these two residents
have to say and have to respect them for coming forward." I le
then turned to R / A Johnson who introduced Alex and Fred
as the persons who defaced the Beethoven poster. She
jokingly remarked: "Pleasedon't anybody kill anybody, I'm
not up for it."
At no time during the meeting did anyone provide a
summary account or explanation of the events of the previ
ous two and a half weeks. Neither of the posters was
displayed. Naranja R / [â€¢ Grift in and others told us that some
in the audience may have mistakenly thought Alex and Fred
had defaced both the Beethoven and the Niggers posters and
that this may have contributed to the tension.
Since the October 14 emergency house meeting, the
posters had been the subject of innumerable conversations
among Ujamaa residents. R / A Weiss told us that the meeting
was emotionally "charged" from the start.
Alex and Fred's Speech.
Alex and Fred followed R / A Johnson. Fred had sug
gested before the meeting, "Let me handle this, 1 like to
speak. If only one of us speaks maybe that's an easier way to
do it." Alex agreed to this plan. Alex later told us that his
agreeing to let Fred do the talking was "a big mistake." They
talked for about 15 minutes. Fred said that he now realizes
that he began with an "arrogant analytical tone" and "made
errors from the start."
Fred began by saying they had defaced the Beethoven
poster but not the Kappa Alpha Psi poster. 1 He then said that
there were "two things |he and Alex | wanted to do": (I) We
"want to explain ourselves" and (2) "hear your reaction." He
continued, "I don't know if what you want is an apology.""!
mean sorry', what the fuck does that mean, that's just a
word." "We know an apology won't be enough so we won't
even say it."
He said he and Alex were "drunk and stoned" when they
defaced the poster but this was "no excuse." He went on to
say they "didn't think of themselves as racists" but that the
drunken state had brought to the fore certain subconscious
"things in | their | psyches," of which they had not been aware.
Fred told the crowd that he and Alex were from "multi
racial environments" where "race was not the focus of
attention." He was "shocked to come |to Stanford) and find
people cared so much about race." This "offended" him. He
thought it was "stupid." He had been overwhelmed by the
emphasis on "ethnic differences and pluralism in orienta
tion." He spoke of his negative reaction to being "con
fronted" with "assertive" and "aggressive ethnicity."
Fred said that he and Alex "had got fed up with all the talk
about race" and thought defacing the poster was a "g(xxl op
portunity to show the black students how ridiculous it was to
focus on i ace." He said that they had no idea that defacing the
poster would be taken "seriously"; that they thought of it as
a "joke." He also spoke of the defaced poster as "satirical
humor" or having a "satirical message."
Fred said that he and Alex did not realize the "implica
tions" of defacing the poster.
Fred said that "before [ he | knew Beethoven was black he
had had a certain image of Beethoven and hearing he was
black changed his perception of Beethoven and made him
see Beethoven as the person he drew in the picture." He went
on to say that "Beethoven was a very rageful and powerful
figure and that was what he drew in the poster." He said the
fact of Beethoven's blackness had more support than he had
originally thought.
3. The summary of Alex and Fred's remarks is culled
from our interviews with Alex, Fred and other persons who
attended the meeting. There were minor variations in the
accounts which we do not discuss; for the most part we do not
attribute quotations to specific interviewees.
Both Alex and Fred said that they had "black friends who
didn 't make a point of racial differences." Alex spoke of his
experiences of living in a poor, predominantly black Indian
apolis neighborhood when a young child and later of living
on the south side of Chicago and being discriminated against
because he was white. He also said that at Stanford "there was
so much focus on race, it was a sh<x:k to me." He spoke of the
defaced poster as "food for thought" for the thought board,
"educational" and "avant xarde" art.
Fred offered to do a research paper on Beethoven and
donate a lxx>k about Alexander Pushkin to the Ujamaa
archives. He made the Pushkin offer because he had recently
learned that the Russian writer had black ancestry.
Ujamaa resident Lisa Farrell interrupted Fred's discourse
with: "You arrogant bastard, how dare you come here and not
even apologize. I want an apology." Fred looked toward Alex
with the implied suggestion that they answer in unison. Fred
responded: "Ok. I, 2, 3, we're sorry."
Alex did not join in this remark. Immediately after Fred
made it. Alex said: "I owe everyone a big apology, I hope
everything can be worked out, I'm really sorry. I realize how
much I hurt the house."
But the damage had been done. R / A Weiss described
Fred's apology, which many thought flippant, as the first
"stab in the baek"of the meeting. Alex's belated apology was
ignored in the negative reaction that Fred's comment crys
talized.
Fred told us that as soon as he made the inappropriate
remark he realized that "he had lost the right to say anything
else" at the meeting. In fact. Alex and Fred said little more for
the remainder of the meeting.
Alex and Fred's Fxplanations and Reaction.
We asked Fred why he did not apologize for defacing the
poster. Fred said that his first thought when he had gone to R
/ A Johnson's rcxmi on October 14 was that he "must apolo
gize"; but when he saw the "impassive faces" behind which
was "revulsion and disgust" for Alex and himself, he could
not do so. Instead, he wanted to "explain [his and Alex's|
subconscious so the residents would think of them as indi
viduals" instead of looking at "the bigger picture" and seeing
them as "symbols of white oppression and racial tension." He
also said that he felt an apology would be inadequate because
he thought the black students had a history of racial insults
and would think of him as "another silly white boy who
thinks if he apologizes everything will be OK." He says he
thought "These people don't want an apology from me"; that
he felt "inadequate" and therefore "couldn't apologize." He
also said that though he heard Resident Farrell say she
wanted an apology, he did not apologize because he was not
thinking of her but was "still thinking that the group [ was not
thinking of Alex and him| as individuals."
We asked Alex w hat his thoughts on the Sunday meeting
were. He told us that he was "scared." He was "not indignant"
about the meeting because he "felt very responsible and
needed to be punished." He was pessimistic about the meet
ing working because the crowd was too large. When he
entered the lounge on Sunday R / A Andrews had encourag
ingly patted him on the back.
Alex said that he was "shocked" at Fred's "complete stu
pidity" in saying "1,2,3, we're sorry." He feels that Fred is
sometimes perceived as arrogant because of his manner and
English accent. He thought Fred's nodding while other resi
dents spoke was indicative of a desire to hear more of w hat
they had to say.
Reaction to Alex and Fred's Speech.
The Ujamaa residents with whom we spoke had ex
tremely and consistently negative reactions to Alex and
Fred's statements and manner at the meeting both when they
spoke and w hen other residents subsequently spoke. One
resident referred to their failure to give a sincere apology as
the "big mistake"; this failure angered and surprised most of
the Ujamaa residents. Loretta Cronin (a junior and an Uja
maa resident at the meeting) expressed the opinion that the
meeting would have been totally different if Alex and Fred
had apologized differently. R / A Weiss and T / A Brown
expressed the opinion that the incident could have been
handled in the house if Alex and Fred had given a sincere
apology. As resident Brown put it:"the dorm would be happy
and peachy keen." Naranja R / A Clark West said the 1,2,3
"trivialized" the apology ..."the apology wasn't the great
est."
Other Ujamaa residents said that when Alex and Fred
spoke of their "subconscious racism" it was as if one could
"feel the room heat up"; "the more they talked, the more they
dug themselves into a hole"; and when they finished, it was
as if a "thundercloud were over the room." R / A Johnson
dismissed the statements about subconscious racism as
"ridiculous."To the Ujamaa residents, Alex and Fred seemed
to be trying to "manipulate" the meeting and evade respon
sibility for defacing the poster with their talk of subconscious
racism, drunkenness, and the impact on them of ethnicity at
Stanford and the pluralism component of orientation.
The Ujamaa residents perceived Alex and Fred's attitude
and "body language" as "arrogant." "incredibly arrogant,"
"insincere," "condescending," "patronizing," "not very in
terested," "not caring," "nonchalant," and "not listening" to
the black students who spoke during the discussion. R / F
Brooks said that when others spoke Alex and Fred were
"whispering," apparently making "casual statements" about
the speakers; in his opinion this was "very inappropriate." R
/A Andrews told us that Alex and Fred's actions "trivialized
Ujamaa." Ujamaa residents were upset that Alex and Fred
still did not appear to understand why they found the defacing
of the poster offensive. It grated that Alex and Fred seemed
inattentive or would nod their heads and say "uh huh." as if
to say "I already know that" when Ujamaa residents spoke.
T / A Baldwin told us that they did not "seem sorry." To R /
A Johnson, Alex and Fred seemed "uppity"; she interpreted
Alex's comparative silence as if he were thinking "I don't
care what you do to me"; she thought he was "just looking at
the hurt people and didn't care."
Jack Mitchell, a white Ujamaa freshman who had not re
quested assignment to Ujamaa and who describes his back
ground as "conservative," said that he first thought Alex and
Fred were "sincere." But the more they talked, the more it
"seemed as if they were just trying to pacify people and get
it over with." I le came to the Sunday meeting hoping to "see
someone who recognized they had hurt" the Ujamaa resi
dents; instead Alex and Fred's remarks made him feel
"ashamed" that they were so "insensitive."
R / F Griffin told us that Alex and Fred "came across as
unaware" of the extent to which an apology was necessary.
He perceived some of their statements as "conciliatory" and
others as "argumentative." R / F Griffin subsequently told
Fred that "arrogant was not an inappropriate characteriza
tion" of what Fred said at the meeting. He. however, per
ceived the nodding of the head, which most Ujamaa residents
thought condescending, as conciliatory.
Dean Jamison's Comments.
If there had been any hope that a consensus would evolve
around a resolution that would permit Alex and Fred to
continue as Lagunita residents, it w as destroyed the moment
"1,2,3. we're sorry" was uttered. The remark was followed
by a hostile clamor to have Alex and Fred removed from
Lagunita. The speakers made increasingly bitter and angry
remarks about, among other subjects, racial intolerance at
Stanford, the unreasonableness of expecting Ujamaa resi
dents toeducate Alex and Fred about racism, the University's
inabililty to deal with racial incidents â€” as demonstrated by
its response to the Otero matter and subsequent vigil, the
Western Culture debate, students wearing "Aryan by the
grace of God" T-shirts. Residential Education policies about
Ujamaaâ€”andthe absolute unacceptability of allowing Alex
and Fred to continue as Lagunita residents.
Many of these remarks were directed at Dean Jamison. R
/ A Johnson described Dean Jamison to us as "a figure of
authority .th.th. a person [who is] very much trusted and
respected in the black community." The students looked to
him for the University's response to w hat they now saw as an
intolerable situation.
Dean Jamison told the residents that "the incident was a
learning experience" for them and that Alex and Fred would
remain at Lagunita so the residents could educate them about
racism. He said it was a house problem that must be handled
internally by the residents. He told the residents that it was
"ridiculous to assume [that Stanford or they J could move
racism around" or "isolate" themselves from it and that it was
"important [for them| to leam that Stanford was not Utopia."
Dean Jamison also told the residents that he was "38 and had
dealt with racism all of my life"; he minimized the signifi
cance of the defaced poster in comparison to racial incidents
that he had suffered in the 19605.
Reaction to Dean Jamison's Speech.
R / F Griffin told us that Dean Jamison "made a strong
case for treating (the matter J in the house."
Most other persons with whom we spoke disagreed with
Dean Jamison's remarks. A recurring criticism was that he
was not listening to the students. R / A Weiss described his
remarks as the "second stab in the back" of the aftemixjn. R
/ A Andrews described them as "a slap in the face to the
Uj[amaa| residents," a "real kicker": it was as if Dean
Jamison were saying its "your problem and you deal with it."
Many of the residents thought Dean Jamison was giving a
"bureaucratic" Stanford position with which he was not
entirely comfortable; T / A Stacy Hamilton, a junior, said that
T / A Rene Moore, a junior, said if Alex and Fred's apology
had been sincere and if Dean Jamison had been "open to
student suggestions" the atmosphere at the meeting would
have been different.
em According to R /F Brooks, the residents "lit into | Dean
Jamison |as if Alex and Fred weren't there"; and the "meeting
turned into a verbal duel with Richard."One resident said that
several students vituperatively "attacked" Dean Jamison in
a "loud" and "insulting" manner that made her "very sad."
Sally Stewart and Loretta Cronin spoke at the meeting.
Loretta Cronin told us that she questioned Dean Jamison
about how the students could change his mind about not
removing Alex and Fred in a way that "may have come off
seeming hostile."
Dean Jamison elevated his voice as the students fired
questions and comments at him.
R / F Brooks thought the meeting was not going very well
when he arrived. The "statements were too long, some
students [were| getting recycled," there seemed to be no
ground rules and the remarks were becoming more "per
sonal." and there were not enough comments from white
residents. He did not however take control of the meeting; he

We asked Dean Jamison what his thoughts were on his

the emotions at the October 14 meeting. Dean Jamison
admitted that he had "spewed out the standard [Residential

mental standard.

Jack Mitchell, a white Ujamaa freshman who had not re
quested assignment to Ujamaa and who describes his back
ground as "conservative," said that he first thought Alex and
Fred were "sincere." But the more they talked, the more it
"seemed as if they were just trying to pacify people and get
it over with." I le came to the Sunday meeting hoping to "see
someone who recognized they had hurt" the Ujamaa resi
dents; instead Alex and Fred's remarks made him feel
"ashamed" that they were so "insensitive."
R / F Griffin told us that Alex and Fred "came across as
unaware" of the extent to which an apology was necessary.
He perceived some of their statements as "conciliatory" and
others as "argumentative." R / F Griffin subsequently told
Fred that "arrogant was not an inappropriate characteriza
tion" of what Fred said at the meeting. He. however, per
ceived the nodding of the head, which most Ujamaa residents
thought condescending, as conciliatory.
Dean Jamison's Comments.
If there had been any hope that a consensus would evolve
around a resolution that would permit Alex and Fred to
continue as Lagunita residents, it w as destroyed the moment
"1,2,3. we're sorry" was uttered. The remark was followed
by a hostile clamor to have Alex and Fred removed from
Lagunita. The speakers made increasingly bitter and angry
remarks about, among other subjects, racial intolerance at
Stanford, the unreasonableness of expecting Ujamaa resi
dents toeducate Alex and Fred about racism, the University's
inabililty to deal with racial incidents â€” as demonstrated by
its response to the Otero matter and subsequent vigil, the
Western Culture debate, students wearing "Aryan by the
grace of God" T-shirts. Residential Education policies about
Ujamaaâ€”andthe absolute unacceptability of allowing Alex
and Fred to continue as Lagunita residents.
Many of these remarks were directed at Dean Jamison. R
/ A Johnson described Dean Jamison to us as "a figure of
authority .th.th. a person [who is] very much trusted and
respected in the black community." The students looked to
him for the University's response to w hat they now saw as an
intolerable situation.
Dean Jamison told the residents that "the incident was a
learning experience" for them and that Alex and Fred would
remain at Lagunita so the residents could educate them about
racism. He said it was a house problem that must be handled
internally by the residents. He told the residents that it was
"ridiculous to assume [that Stanford or they J could move
racism around" or "isolate" themselves from it and that it was
"important [for them| to leam that Stanford was not Utopia."
Dean Jamison also told the residents that he was "38 and had
dealt with racism all of my life"; he minimized the signifi
cance of the defaced poster in comparison to racial incidents
that he had suffered in the 19605.
Reaction to Dean Jamison's Speech.
R / F Griffin told us that Dean Jamison "made a strong
case for treating (the matter J in the house."
Most other persons with whom we spoke disagreed with
Dean Jamison's remarks. A recurring criticism was that he
was not listening to the students. R / A Weiss described his
remarks as the "second stab in the back" of the aftemixjn. R
/ A Andrews described them as "a slap in the face to the
Uj[amaa| residents," a "real kicker": it was as if Dean
Jamison were saying its "your problem and you deal with it."
Many of the residents thought Dean Jamison was giving a
"bureaucratic" Stanford position with which he was not
entirely comfortable; T / A Stacy Hamilton, a junior, said that
T / A Rene Moore, a junior, said if Alex and Fred's apology
had been sincere and if Dean Jamison had been "open to
student suggestions" the atmosphere at the meeting would
have been different.
em According to R /F Brooks, the residents "lit into | Dean
Jamison |as if Alex and Fred weren't there"; and the "meeting
turned into a verbal duel with Richard."One resident said that
several students vituperatively "attacked" Dean Jamison in
a "loud" and "insulting" manner that made her "very sad."
Sally Stewart and Loretta Cronin spoke at the meeting.
Loretta Cronin told us that she questioned Dean Jamison
about how the students could change his mind about not
removing Alex and Fred in a way that "may have come off
seeming hostile."
Dean Jamison elevated his voice as the students fired
questions and comments at him.
R / F Brooks thought the meeting was not going very well
when he arrived. The "statements were too long, some
students [were| getting recycled," there seemed to be no
ground rules and the remarks were becoming more "per
sonal." and there were not enough comments from white
residents. He did not however take control of the meeting; he
did tell R / A Andrews to get names of students who wanted
to talk and had not gotten a chance.
We asked Dean Jamison what his thoughts were on his
comments at the meeting. He said in retrospect that he "didn't
read the situation well." R / F Brooks had not told him about
the emotions at the October 14 meeting. Dean Jamison
admitted that he had "spewed out the standard [Residential
Education) line' but he had "no basis to work with the
fundamental standard as he knew of "no judicial prece
dents ' treating racial incidents as violations of the funda
mental standard.
QC's Speech.
The focus of the meeting shifted a second time when
QC spoke. His talk was the meeting's emotional
apex. Estimates of its length ranged from one and
a half to ten minutes. QC's passion surprised other
Ujamaa residents who did not think of him as a
"sensitive, emotional kind of guy." 4
QC told us that he had little reaction to Alex and Fred's
statements at the Sunday meeting. He characterized them as

attended the meeting. There were minor variations in the
accounts which we do not discuss; for the most part we do not

times difficult to distinguish between the statements that QC
made at the meeting, his thoughts, and the statements he
made in our interview.

R / A Andrews started the meeting at around 12 noon. R
/ F Brcxiks did not arrive until around 12:20 p.m. R / A
Andrews said: "we're here to hear what these two residents
have to say and have to respect them for coming forward." I le
then turned to R / A Johnson who introduced Alex and Fred
as the persons who defaced the Beethoven poster. She
jokingly remarked: "Pleasedon't anybody kill anybody, I'm
not up for it."
At no time during the meeting did anyone provide a
summary account or explanation of the events of the previ
ous two and a half weeks. Neither of the posters was
displayed. Naranja R / [â€¢ Grift in and others told us that some
in the audience may have mistakenly thought Alex and Fred
had defaced both the Beethoven and the Niggers posters and
that this may have contributed to the tension.
Since the October 14 emergency house meeting, the
posters had been the subject of innumerable conversations
among Ujamaa residents. R / A Weiss told us that the meeting
was emotionally "charged" from the start.
Alex and Fred's Speech.
Alex and Fred followed R / A Johnson. Fred had sug
gested before the meeting, "Let me handle this, 1 like to
speak. If only one of us speaks maybe that's an easier way to
do it." Alex agreed to this plan. Alex later told us that his
agreeing to let Fred do the talking was "a big mistake." They
talked for about 15 minutes. Fred said that he now realizes
that he began with an "arrogant analytical tone" and "made
errors from the start."
Fred began by saying they had defaced the Beethoven
poster but not the Kappa Alpha Psi poster. 1 He then said that
there were "two things |he and Alex | wanted to do": (I) We
"want to explain ourselves" and (2) "hear your reaction." He
continued, "I don't know if what you want is an apology.""!
mean sorry', what the fuck does that mean, that's just a
word." "We know an apology won't be enough so we won't
even say it."
He said he and Alex were "drunk and stoned" when they
defaced the poster but this was "no excuse." He went on to
say they "didn't think of themselves as racists" but that the
drunken state had brought to the fore certain subconscious
"things in | their | psyches," of which they had not been aware.
Fred told the crowd that he and Alex were from "multi
racial environments" where "race was not the focus of
attention." He was "shocked to come |to Stanford) and find
people cared so much about race." This "offended" him. He
thought it was "stupid." He had been overwhelmed by the
emphasis on "ethnic differences and pluralism in orienta
tion." He spoke of his negative reaction to being "con
fronted" with "assertive" and "aggressive ethnicity."
Fred said that he and Alex "had got fed up with all the talk
about race" and thought defacing the poster was a "g(xxl op
portunity to show the black students how ridiculous it was to
focus on i ace." He said that they had no idea that defacing the
poster would be taken "seriously"; that they thought of it as
a "joke." He also spoke of the defaced poster as "satirical
humor" or having a "satirical message."
Fred said that he and Alex did not realize the "implica
tions" of defacing the poster.
Fred said that "before [ he | knew Beethoven was black he
had had a certain image of Beethoven and hearing he was
black changed his perception of Beethoven and made him
see Beethoven as the person he drew in the picture." He went
on to say that "Beethoven was a very rageful and powerful
figure and that was what he drew in the poster." He said the
fact of Beethoven's blackness had more support than he had
originally thought.
3. The summary of Alex and Fred's remarks is culled
from our interviews with Alex, Fred and other persons who
attended the meeting. There were minor variations in the
accounts which we do not discuss; for the most part we do not
attribute quotations to specific interviewees.
Both Alex and Fred said that they had "black friends who
didn 't make a point of racial differences." Alex spoke of his
experiences of living in a poor, predominantly black Indian
apolis neighborhood when a young child and later of living
on the south side of Chicago and being discriminated against
because he was white. He also said that at Stanford "there was
so much focus on race, it was a sh<x:k to me." He spoke of the
defaced poster as "food for thought" for the thought board,
"educational" and "avant xarde" art.
Fred offered to do a research paper on Beethoven and
donate a lxx>k about Alexander Pushkin to the Ujamaa
archives. He made the Pushkin offer because he had recently
learned that the Russian writer had black ancestry.
Ujamaa resident Lisa Farrell interrupted Fred's discourse
with: "You arrogant bastard, how dare you come here and not
even apologize. I want an apology." Fred looked toward Alex
with the implied suggestion that they answer in unison. Fred
responded: "Ok. I, 2, 3, we're sorry."
Alex did not join in this remark. Immediately after Fred
made it. Alex said: "I owe everyone a big apology, I hope
everything can be worked out, I'm really sorry. I realize how
much I hurt the house."
But the damage had been done. R / A Weiss described
Fred's apology, which many thought flippant, as the first
"stab in the baek"of the meeting. Alex's belated apology was
ignored in the negative reaction that Fred's comment crys
talized.
Fred told us that as soon as he made the inappropriate
remark he realized that "he had lost the right to say anything
else" at the meeting. In fact. Alex and Fred said little more for
the remainder of the meeting.
Alex and Fred's Fxplanations and Reaction.
We asked Fred why he did not apologize for defacing the
poster. Fred said that his first thought when he had gone to R
/ A Johnson's rcxmi on October 14 was that he "must apolo
gize"; but when he saw the "impassive faces" behind which
was "revulsion and disgust" for Alex and himself, he could
not do so. Instead, he wanted to "explain [his and Alex's|
subconscious so the residents would think of them as indi
viduals" instead of looking at "the bigger picture" and seeing
them as "symbols of white oppression and racial tension." He
also said that he felt an apology would be inadequate because
he thought the black students had a history of racial insults
and would think of him as "another silly white boy who
thinks if he apologizes everything will be OK." He says he
thought "These people don't want an apology from me"; that
he felt "inadequate" and therefore "couldn't apologize." He
also said that though he heard Resident Farrell say she
wanted an apology, he did not apologize because he was not
thinking of her but was "still thinking that the group [ was not
thinking of Alex and him| as individuals."
We asked Alex w hat his thoughts on the Sunday meeting
were. He told us that he was "scared." He was "not indignant"
about the meeting because he "felt very responsible and
needed to be punished." He was pessimistic about the meet
ing working because the crowd was too large. When he
entered the lounge on Sunday R / A Andrews had encourag
ingly patted him on the back.
Alex said that he was "shocked" at Fred's "complete stu
pidity" in saying "1,2,3, we're sorry." He feels that Fred is
sometimes perceived as arrogant because of his manner and
English accent. He thought Fred's nodding while other resi
dents spoke was indicative of a desire to hear more of w hat
they had to say.
Reaction to Alex and Fred's Speech.
The Ujamaa residents with whom we spoke had ex
tremely and consistently negative reactions to Alex and
Fred's statements and manner at the meeting both when they
spoke and w hen other residents subsequently spoke. One
resident referred to their failure to give a sincere apology as
the "big mistake"; this failure angered and surprised most of
the Ujamaa residents. Loretta Cronin (a junior and an Uja
maa resident at the meeting) expressed the opinion that the
meeting would have been totally different if Alex and Fred
had apologized differently. R / A Weiss and T / A Brown
expressed the opinion that the incident could have been
handled in the house if Alex and Fred had given a sincere
apology. As resident Brown put it:"the dorm would be happy
and peachy keen." Naranja R / A Clark West said the 1,2,3
"trivialized" the apology ..."the apology wasn't the great
est."
Other Ujamaa residents said that when Alex and Fred
spoke of their "subconscious racism" it was as if one could
"feel the room heat up"; "the more they talked, the more they
dug themselves into a hole"; and when they finished, it was
as if a "thundercloud were over the room." R / A Johnson
dismissed the statements about subconscious racism as
"ridiculous."To the Ujamaa residents, Alex and Fred seemed
to be trying to "manipulate" the meeting and evade respon
sibility for defacing the poster with their talk of subconscious
racism, drunkenness, and the impact on them of ethnicity at
Stanford and the pluralism component of orientation.
The Ujamaa residents perceived Alex and Fred's attitude
and "body language" as "arrogant." "incredibly arrogant,"
"insincere," "condescending," "patronizing," "not very in
terested," "not caring," "nonchalant," and "not listening" to
the black students who spoke during the discussion. R / F
Brooks said that when others spoke Alex and Fred were
"whispering," apparently making "casual statements" about
the speakers; in his opinion this was "very inappropriate." R
/A Andrews told us that Alex and Fred's actions "trivialized
Ujamaa." Ujamaa residents were upset that Alex and Fred
still did not appear to understand why they found the defacing
of the poster offensive. It grated that Alex and Fred seemed
inattentive or would nod their heads and say "uh huh." as if
to say "I already know that" when Ujamaa residents spoke.
T / A Baldwin told us that they did not "seem sorry." To R /
A Johnson, Alex and Fred seemed "uppity"; she interpreted
Alex's comparative silence as if he were thinking "I don't
care what you do to me"; she thought he was "just looking at
the hurt people and didn't care."
Jack Mitchell, a white Ujamaa freshman who had not re
quested assignment to Ujamaa and who describes his back
ground as "conservative," said that he first thought Alex and
Fred were "sincere." But the more they talked, the more it
"seemed as if they were just trying to pacify people and get
it over with." I le came to the Sunday meeting hoping to "see
someone who recognized they had hurt" the Ujamaa resi
dents; instead Alex and Fred's remarks made him feel
"ashamed" that they were so "insensitive."
R / F Griffin told us that Alex and Fred "came across as
unaware" of the extent to which an apology was necessary.
He perceived some of their statements as "conciliatory" and
others as "argumentative." R / F Griffin subsequently told
Fred that "arrogant was not an inappropriate characteriza
tion" of what Fred said at the meeting. He. however, per
ceived the nodding of the head, which most Ujamaa residents
thought condescending, as conciliatory.
Dean Jamison's Comments.
If there had been any hope that a consensus would evolve
around a resolution that would permit Alex and Fred to
continue as Lagunita residents, it w as destroyed the moment
"1,2,3. we're sorry" was uttered. The remark was followed
by a hostile clamor to have Alex and Fred removed from
Lagunita. The speakers made increasingly bitter and angry
remarks about, among other subjects, racial intolerance at

thought "These people don't want an apology from me"; that
he felt "inadequate" and therefore "couldn't apologize." He
also said that though he heard Resident Farrell say she
wanted an apology, he did not apologize because he was not
thinking of her but was "still thinking that the group [ was not
thinking of Alex and him| as individuals."
We asked Alex w hat his thoughts on the Sunday meeting
were. He told us that he was "scared." He was "not indignant"
about the meeting because he "felt very responsible and
needed to be punished." He was pessimistic about the meet
ing working because the crowd was too large. When he
entered the lounge on Sunday R / A Andrews had encourag
ingly patted him on the back.
Alex said that he was "shocked" at Fred's "complete stu
pidity" in saying "1,2,3, we're sorry." He feels that Fred is
sometimes perceived as arrogant because of his manner and
English accent. He thought Fred's nodding while other resi
dents spoke was indicative of a desire to hear more of w hat
they had to say.
Reaction to Alex and Fred's Speech.
The Ujamaa residents with whom we spoke had ex
tremely and consistently negative reactions to Alex and
Fred's statements and manner at the meeting both when they
spoke and w hen other residents subsequently spoke. One
resident referred to their failure to give a sincere apology as
the "big mistake"; this failure angered and surprised most of
the Ujamaa residents. Loretta Cronin (a junior and an Uja
maa resident at the meeting) expressed the opinion that the
meeting would have been totally different if Alex and Fred
had apologized differently. R / A Weiss and T / A Brown
expressed the opinion that the incident could have been
handled in the house if Alex and Fred had given a sincere
apology. As resident Brown put it:"the dorm would be happy
and peachy keen." Naranja R / A Clark West said the 1,2,3
"trivialized" the apology ..."the apology wasn't the great
est."
Other Ujamaa residents said that when Alex and Fred
spoke of their "subconscious racism" it was as if one could
"feel the room heat up"; "the more they talked, the more they
dug themselves into a hole"; and when they finished, it was
as if a "thundercloud were over the room." R / A Johnson
dismissed the statements about subconscious racism as
"ridiculous."To the Ujamaa residents, Alex and Fred seemed
to be trying to "manipulate" the meeting and evade respon
sibility for defacing the poster with their talk of subconscious
racism, drunkenness, and the impact on them of ethnicity at
Stanford and the pluralism component of orientation.
The Ujamaa residents perceived Alex and Fred's attitude
and "body language" as "arrogant." "incredibly arrogant,"
"insincere," "condescending," "patronizing," "not very in
terested," "not caring," "nonchalant," and "not listening" to
the black students who spoke during the discussion. R / F
Brooks said that when others spoke Alex and Fred were
"whispering," apparently making "casual statements" about
the speakers; in his opinion this was "very inappropriate." R
/A Andrews told us that Alex and Fred's actions "trivialized
Ujamaa." Ujamaa residents were upset that Alex and Fred
still did not appear to understand why they found the defacing
of the poster offensive. It grated that Alex and Fred seemed
inattentive or would nod their heads and say "uh huh." as if
to say "I already know that" when Ujamaa residents spoke.
T / A Baldwin told us that they did not "seem sorry." To R /
A Johnson, Alex and Fred seemed "uppity"; she interpreted
Alex's comparative silence as if he were thinking "I don't
care what you do to me"; she thought he was "just looking at
the hurt people and didn't care."
Jack Mitchell, a white Ujamaa freshman who had not re
quested assignment to Ujamaa and who describes his back
ground as "conservative," said that he first thought Alex and
Fred were "sincere." But the more they talked, the more it
"seemed as if they were just trying to pacify people and get
it over with." I le came to the Sunday meeting hoping to "see
someone who recognized they had hurt" the Ujamaa resi
dents; instead Alex and Fred's remarks made him feel
"ashamed" that they were so "insensitive."
R / F Griffin told us that Alex and Fred "came across as
unaware" of the extent to which an apology was necessary.
He perceived some of their statements as "conciliatory" and
others as "argumentative." R / F Griffin subsequently told
Fred that "arrogant was not an inappropriate characteriza
tion" of what Fred said at the meeting. He. however, per
ceived the nodding of the head, which most Ujamaa residents
thought condescending, as conciliatory.
Dean Jamison's Comments.
If there had been any hope that a consensus would evolve
around a resolution that would permit Alex and Fred to
continue as Lagunita residents, it w as destroyed the moment
"1,2,3. we're sorry" was uttered. The remark was followed
by a hostile clamor to have Alex and Fred removed from
Lagunita. The speakers made increasingly bitter and angry
remarks about, among other subjects, racial intolerance at
Stanford, the unreasonableness of expecting Ujamaa resi
dents toeducate Alex and Fred about racism, the University's
inabililty to deal with racial incidents â€” as demonstrated by
its response to the Otero matter and subsequent vigil, the
Western Culture debate, students wearing "Aryan by the
grace of God" T-shirts. Residential Education policies about
Ujamaaâ€”andthe absolute unacceptability of allowing Alex
and Fred to continue as Lagunita residents.
Many of these remarks were directed at Dean Jamison. R
/ A Johnson described Dean Jamison to us as "a figure of
authority .th.th. a person [who is] very much trusted and
respected in the black community." The students looked to
him for the University's response to w hat they now saw as an
intolerable situation.
Dean Jamison told the residents that "the incident was a
learning experience" for them and that Alex and Fred would
remain at Lagunita so the residents could educate them about
racism. He said it was a house problem that must be handled
internally by the residents. He told the residents that it was
"ridiculous to assume [that Stanford or they J could move
racism around" or "isolate" themselves from it and that it was
"important [for them| to leam that Stanford was not Utopia."
Dean Jamison also told the residents that he was "38 and had
dealt with racism all of my life"; he minimized the signifi
cance of the defaced poster in comparison to racial incidents
that he had suffered in the 19605.
Reaction to Dean Jamison's Speech.
R / F Griffin told us that Dean Jamison "made a strong
case for treating (the matter J in the house."
Most other persons with whom we spoke disagreed with
Dean Jamison's remarks. A recurring criticism was that he
was not listening to the students. R / A Weiss described his
remarks as the "second stab in the back" of the aftemixjn. R
/ A Andrews described them as "a slap in the face to the
Uj[amaa| residents," a "real kicker": it was as if Dean
Jamison were saying its "your problem and you deal with it."
Many of the residents thought Dean Jamison was giving a
"bureaucratic" Stanford position with which he was not
entirely comfortable; T / A Stacy Hamilton, a junior, said that
T / A Rene Moore, a junior, said if Alex and Fred's apology
had been sincere and if Dean Jamison had been "open to
student suggestions" the atmosphere at the meeting would
have been different.
em According to R /F Brooks, the residents "lit into | Dean
Jamison |as if Alex and Fred weren't there"; and the "meeting
turned into a verbal duel with Richard."One resident said that
several students vituperatively "attacked" Dean Jamison in
a "loud" and "insulting" manner that made her "very sad."
Sally Stewart and Loretta Cronin spoke at the meeting.
Loretta Cronin told us that she questioned Dean Jamison
about how the students could change his mind about not
removing Alex and Fred in a way that "may have come off
seeming hostile."
Dean Jamison elevated his voice as the students fired
questions and comments at him.
R / F Brooks thought the meeting was not going very well
when he arrived. The "statements were too long, some
students [were| getting recycled," there seemed to be no
ground rules and the remarks were becoming more "per
sonal." and there were not enough comments from white
residents. He did not however take control of the meeting; he
did tell R / A Andrews to get names of students who wanted
to talk and had not gotten a chance.
We asked Dean Jamison what his thoughts were on his
comments at the meeting. He said in retrospect that he "didn't
read the situation well." R / F Brooks had not told him about
the emotions at the October 14 meeting. Dean Jamison
admitted that he had "spewed out the standard [Residential
Education) line' but he had "no basis to work with the
fundamental standard as he knew of "no judicial prece
dents ' treating racial incidents as violations of the funda
mental standard.
QC's Speech.
The focus of the meeting shifted a second time when
QC spoke. His talk was the meeting's emotional
apex. Estimates of its length ranged from one and
a half to ten minutes. QC's passion surprised other
Ujamaa residents who did not think of him as a
"sensitive, emotional kind of guy." 4
QC told us that he had little reaction to Alex and Fred's
statements at the Sunday meeting. He characterized them as

culled from our interviews with QC and other persons who
attended the meeting. There were minor variations in the
accounts which we do not discuss; for the most part we do not
attribute quotations to specific interviewees. It was some
times difficult to distinguish between the statements that QC
made at the meeting, his thoughts, and the statements he
made in our interview.

R / A Andrews started the meeting at around 12 noon. R
/ F Brcxiks did not arrive until around 12:20 p.m. R / A
Andrews said: "we're here to hear what these two residents
have to say and have to respect them for coming forward." I le
then turned to R / A Johnson who introduced Alex and Fred
as the persons who defaced the Beethoven poster. She
jokingly remarked: "Pleasedon't anybody kill anybody, I'm
not up for it."
At no time during the meeting did anyone provide a
summary account or explanation of the events of the previ
ous two and a half weeks. Neither of the posters was
displayed. Naranja R / [â€¢ Grift in and others told us that some
in the audience may have mistakenly thought Alex and Fred
had defaced both the Beethoven and the Niggers posters and
that this may have contributed to the tension.
Since the October 14 emergency house meeting, the
posters had been the subject of innumerable conversations
among Ujamaa residents. R / A Weiss told us that the meeting
was emotionally "charged" from the start.
Alex and Fred's Speech.
Alex and Fred followed R / A Johnson. Fred had sug
gested before the meeting, "Let me handle this, 1 like to
speak. If only one of us speaks maybe that's an easier way to
do it." Alex agreed to this plan. Alex later told us that his
agreeing to let Fred do the talking was "a big mistake." They
talked for about 15 minutes. Fred said that he now realizes
that he began with an "arrogant analytical tone" and "made
errors from the start."
Fred began by saying they had defaced the Beethoven
poster but not the Kappa Alpha Psi poster. 1 He then said that
there were "two things |he and Alex | wanted to do": (I) We
"want to explain ourselves" and (2) "hear your reaction." He
continued, "I don't know if what you want is an apology.""!
mean sorry', what the fuck does that mean, that's just a
word." "We know an apology won't be enough so we won't
even say it."
He said he and Alex were "drunk and stoned" when they
defaced the poster but this was "no excuse." He went on to
say they "didn't think of themselves as racists" but that the
drunken state had brought to the fore certain subconscious
"things in | their | psyches," of which they had not been aware.
Fred told the crowd that he and Alex were from "multi
racial environments" where "race was not the focus of
attention." He was "shocked to come |to Stanford) and find
people cared so much about race." This "offended" him. He
thought it was "stupid." He had been overwhelmed by the
emphasis on "ethnic differences and pluralism in orienta
tion." He spoke of his negative reaction to being "con
fronted" with "assertive" and "aggressive ethnicity."
Fred said that he and Alex "had got fed up with all the talk
about race" and thought defacing the poster was a "g(xxl op
portunity to show the black students how ridiculous it was to
focus on i ace." He said that they had no idea that defacing the
poster would be taken "seriously"; that they thought of it as
a "joke." He also spoke of the defaced poster as "satirical
humor" or having a "satirical message."
Fred said that he and Alex did not realize the "implica
tions" of defacing the poster.
Fred said that "before [ he | knew Beethoven was black he
had had a certain image of Beethoven and hearing he was
black changed his perception of Beethoven and made him
see Beethoven as the person he drew in the picture." He went
on to say that "Beethoven was a very rageful and powerful
figure and that was what he drew in the poster." He said the
fact of Beethoven's blackness had more support than he had
originally thought.
3. The summary of Alex and Fred's remarks is culled
from our interviews with Alex, Fred and other persons who
attended the meeting. There were minor variations in the
accounts which we do not discuss; for the most part we do not
attribute quotations to specific interviewees.
Both Alex and Fred said that they had "black friends who
didn 't make a point of racial differences." Alex spoke of his
experiences of living in a poor, predominantly black Indian
apolis neighborhood when a young child and later of living
on the south side of Chicago and being discriminated against
because he was white. He also said that at Stanford "there was
so much focus on race, it was a sh<x:k to me." He spoke of the
defaced poster as "food for thought" for the thought board,
"educational" and "avant xarde" art.
Fred offered to do a research paper on Beethoven and
donate a lxx>k about Alexander Pushkin to the Ujamaa
archives. He made the Pushkin offer because he had recently
learned that the Russian writer had black ancestry.
Ujamaa resident Lisa Farrell interrupted Fred's discourse
with: "You arrogant bastard, how dare you come here and not
even apologize. I want an apology." Fred looked toward Alex
with the implied suggestion that they answer in unison. Fred
responded: "Ok. I, 2, 3, we're sorry."
Alex did not join in this remark. Immediately after Fred
made it. Alex said: "I owe everyone a big apology, I hope
everything can be worked out, I'm really sorry. I realize how
much I hurt the house."
But the damage had been done. R / A Weiss described
Fred's apology, which many thought flippant, as the first
"stab in the baek"of the meeting. Alex's belated apology was
ignored in the negative reaction that Fred's comment crys
talized.
Fred told us that as soon as he made the inappropriate
remark he realized that "he had lost the right to say anything
else" at the meeting. In fact. Alex and Fred said little more for
the remainder of the meeting.
Alex and Fred's Fxplanations and Reaction.
We asked Fred why he did not apologize for defacing the
poster. Fred said that his first thought when he had gone to R
/ A Johnson's rcxmi on October 14 was that he "must apolo
gize"; but when he saw the "impassive faces" behind which
was "revulsion and disgust" for Alex and himself, he could
not do so. Instead, he wanted to "explain [his and Alex's|
subconscious so the residents would think of them as indi
viduals" instead of looking at "the bigger picture" and seeing
them as "symbols of white oppression and racial tension." He
also said that he felt an apology would be inadequate because
he thought the black students had a history of racial insults
and would think of him as "another silly white boy who
thinks if he apologizes everything will be OK." He says he
thought "These people don't want an apology from me"; that
he felt "inadequate" and therefore "couldn't apologize." He
also said that though he heard Resident Farrell say she
wanted an apology, he did not apologize because he was not
thinking of her but was "still thinking that the group [ was not
thinking of Alex and him| as individuals."
We asked Alex w hat his thoughts on the Sunday meeting
were. He told us that he was "scared." He was "not indignant"
about the meeting because he "felt very responsible and
needed to be punished." He was pessimistic about the meet
ing working because the crowd was too large. When he
entered the lounge on Sunday R / A Andrews had encourag
ingly patted him on the back.
Alex said that he was "shocked" at Fred's "complete stu
pidity" in saying "1,2,3, we're sorry." He feels that Fred is
sometimes perceived as arrogant because of his manner and
English accent. He thought Fred's nodding while other resi
dents spoke was indicative of a desire to hear more of w hat
they had to say.
Reaction to Alex and Fred's Speech.
The Ujamaa residents with whom we spoke had ex
tremely and consistently negative reactions to Alex and
Fred's statements and manner at the meeting both when they

"trivialized" the apology ..."the apology wasn't the great

Other Ujamaa residents said that when Alex and Fred

sibility for defacing the poster with their talk of subconscious
racism, drunkenness, and the impact on them of ethnicity at
Stanford and the pluralism component of orientation.
The Ujamaa residents perceived Alex and Fred's attitude
and "body language" as "arrogant." "incredibly arrogant,"
"insincere," "condescending," "patronizing," "not very in
terested," "not caring," "nonchalant," and "not listening" to
the black students who spoke during the discussion. R / F
Brooks said that when others spoke Alex and Fred were
"whispering," apparently making "casual statements" about
the speakers; in his opinion this was "very inappropriate." R

ceived the nodding of the head, which most Ujamaa residents
thought condescending, as conciliatory.
Dean Jamison's Comments.

about race" and thought defacing the poster was a "g(xxl op
portunity to show the black students how ridiculous it was to
focus on i ace." He said that they had no idea that defacing the
poster would be taken "seriously"; that they thought of it as
a "joke." He also spoke of the defaced poster as "satirical
humor" or having a "satirical message."
Fred said that he and Alex did not realize the "implica
tions" of defacing the poster.
Fred said that "before [ he | knew Beethoven was black he
had had a certain image of Beethoven and hearing he was
black changed his perception of Beethoven and made him
see Beethoven as the person he drew in the picture." He went
on to say that "Beethoven was a very rageful and powerful
figure and that was what he drew in the poster." He said the
fact of Beethoven's blackness had more support than he had
originally thought.
3. The summary of Alex and Fred's remarks is culled
from our interviews with Alex, Fred and other persons who
attended the meeting. There were minor variations in the
accounts which we do not discuss; for the most part we do not
attribute quotations to specific interviewees.
Both Alex and Fred said that they had "black friends who
didn 't make a point of racial differences." Alex spoke of his
experiences of living in a poor, predominantly black Indian
apolis neighborhood when a young child and later of living
on the south side of Chicago and being discriminated against
because he was white. He also said that at Stanford "there was
so much focus on race, it was a sh<x:k to me." He spoke of the
defaced poster as "food for thought" for the thought board,
"educational" and "avant xarde" art.
Fred offered to do a research paper on Beethoven and
donate a lxx>k about Alexander Pushkin to the Ujamaa
archives. He made the Pushkin offer because he had recently
learned that the Russian writer had black ancestry.
Ujamaa resident Lisa Farrell interrupted Fred's discourse
with: "You arrogant bastard, how dare you come here and not
even apologize. I want an apology." Fred looked toward Alex
with the implied suggestion that they answer in unison. Fred
responded: "Ok. I, 2, 3, we're sorry."
Alex did not join in this remark. Immediately after Fred
made it. Alex said: "I owe everyone a big apology, I hope
everything can be worked out, I'm really sorry. I realize how
much I hurt the house."
But the damage had been done. R / A Weiss described
Fred's apology, which many thought flippant, as the first
"stab in the baek"of the meeting. Alex's belated apology was
ignored in the negative reaction that Fred's comment crys
talized.
Fred told us that as soon as he made the inappropriate
remark he realized that "he had lost the right to say anything
else" at the meeting. In fact. Alex and Fred said little more for
the remainder of the meeting.
Alex and Fred's Fxplanations and Reaction.
We asked Fred why he did not apologize for defacing the
poster. Fred said that his first thought when he had gone to R
/ A Johnson's rcxmi on October 14 was that he "must apolo
gize"; but when he saw the "impassive faces" behind which
was "revulsion and disgust" for Alex and himself, he could
not do so. Instead, he wanted to "explain [his and Alex's|
subconscious so the residents would think of them as indi
viduals" instead of looking at "the bigger picture" and seeing
them as "symbols of white oppression and racial tension." He
also said that he felt an apology would be inadequate because
he thought the black students had a history of racial insults
and would think of him as "another silly white boy who
thinks if he apologizes everything will be OK." He says he
thought "These people don't want an apology from me"; that
he felt "inadequate" and therefore "couldn't apologize." He
also said that though he heard Resident Farrell say she
wanted an apology, he did not apologize because he was not
thinking of her but was "still thinking that the group [ was not
thinking of Alex and him| as individuals."
We asked Alex w hat his thoughts on the Sunday meeting
were. He told us that he was "scared." He was "not indignant"
about the meeting because he "felt very responsible and
needed to be punished." He was pessimistic about the meet
ing working because the crowd was too large. When he
entered the lounge on Sunday R / A Andrews had encourag
ingly patted him on the back.
Alex said that he was "shocked" at Fred's "complete stu
pidity" in saying "1,2,3, we're sorry." He feels that Fred is
sometimes perceived as arrogant because of his manner and
English accent. He thought Fred's nodding while other resi
dents spoke was indicative of a desire to hear more of w hat
they had to say.
Reaction to Alex and Fred's Speech.
The Ujamaa residents with whom we spoke had ex
tremely and consistently negative reactions to Alex and
Fred's statements and manner at the meeting both when they
spoke and w hen other residents subsequently spoke. One
resident referred to their failure to give a sincere apology as
the "big mistake"; this failure angered and surprised most of
the Ujamaa residents. Loretta Cronin (a junior and an Uja
maa resident at the meeting) expressed the opinion that the
meeting would have been totally different if Alex and Fred
had apologized differently. R / A Weiss and T / A Brown
expressed the opinion that the incident could have been
handled in the house if Alex and Fred had given a sincere
apology. As resident Brown put it:"the dorm would be happy
and peachy keen." Naranja R / A Clark West said the 1,2,3
"trivialized" the apology ..."the apology wasn't the great
est."
Other Ujamaa residents said that when Alex and Fred
spoke of their "subconscious racism" it was as if one could
"feel the room heat up"; "the more they talked, the more they
dug themselves into a hole"; and when they finished, it was
as if a "thundercloud were over the room." R / A Johnson
dismissed the statements about subconscious racism as
"ridiculous."To the Ujamaa residents, Alex and Fred seemed
to be trying to "manipulate" the meeting and evade respon
sibility for defacing the poster with their talk of subconscious
racism, drunkenness, and the impact on them of ethnicity at
Stanford and the pluralism component of orientation.
The Ujamaa residents perceived Alex and Fred's attitude
and "body language" as "arrogant." "incredibly arrogant,"
"insincere," "condescending," "patronizing," "not very in
terested," "not caring," "nonchalant," and "not listening" to
the black students who spoke during the discussion. R / F
Brooks said that when others spoke Alex and Fred were
"whispering," apparently making "casual statements" about
the speakers; in his opinion this was "very inappropriate." R
/A Andrews told us that Alex and Fred's actions "trivialized
Ujamaa." Ujamaa residents were upset that Alex and Fred
still did not appear to understand why they found the defacing
of the poster offensive. It grated that Alex and Fred seemed
inattentive or would nod their heads and say "uh huh." as if
to say "I already know that" when Ujamaa residents spoke.
T / A Baldwin told us that they did not "seem sorry." To R /
A Johnson, Alex and Fred seemed "uppity"; she interpreted
Alex's comparative silence as if he were thinking "I don't
care what you do to me"; she thought he was "just looking at
the hurt people and didn't care."
Jack Mitchell, a white Ujamaa freshman who had not re
quested assignment to Ujamaa and who describes his back
ground as "conservative," said that he first thought Alex and
Fred were "sincere." But the more they talked, the more it
"seemed as if they were just trying to pacify people and get
it over with." I le came to the Sunday meeting hoping to "see
someone who recognized they had hurt" the Ujamaa resi
dents; instead Alex and Fred's remarks made him feel
"ashamed" that they were so "insensitive."
R / F Griffin told us that Alex and Fred "came across as
unaware" of the extent to which an apology was necessary.
He perceived some of their statements as "conciliatory" and
others as "argumentative." R / F Griffin subsequently told
Fred that "arrogant was not an inappropriate characteriza
tion" of what Fred said at the meeting. He. however, per
ceived the nodding of the head, which most Ujamaa residents
thought condescending, as conciliatory.
Dean Jamison's Comments.
If there had been any hope that a consensus would evolve
around a resolution that would permit Alex and Fred to
continue as Lagunita residents, it w as destroyed the moment
"1,2,3. we're sorry" was uttered. The remark was followed
by a hostile clamor to have Alex and Fred removed from
Lagunita. The speakers made increasingly bitter and angry
remarks about, among other subjects, racial intolerance at
Stanford, the unreasonableness of expecting Ujamaa resi
dents toeducate Alex and Fred about racism, the University's
inabililty to deal with racial incidents â€” as demonstrated by
its response to the Otero matter and subsequent vigil, the
Western Culture debate, students wearing "Aryan by the
grace of God" T-shirts. Residential Education policies about
Ujamaaâ€”andthe absolute unacceptability of allowing Alex
and Fred to continue as Lagunita residents.
Many of these remarks were directed at Dean Jamison. R
/ A Johnson described Dean Jamison to us as "a figure of
authority .th.th. a person [who is] very much trusted and
respected in the black community." The students looked to
him for the University's response to w hat they now saw as an
intolerable situation.
Dean Jamison told the residents that "the incident was a
learning experience" for them and that Alex and Fred would
remain at Lagunita so the residents could educate them about
racism. He said it was a house problem that must be handled
internally by the residents. He told the residents that it was
"ridiculous to assume [that Stanford or they J could move
racism around" or "isolate" themselves from it and that it was
"important [for them| to leam that Stanford was not Utopia."
Dean Jamison also told the residents that he was "38 and had
dealt with racism all of my life"; he minimized the signifi
cance of the defaced poster in comparison to racial incidents
that he had suffered in the 19605.
Reaction to Dean Jamison's Speech.
R / F Griffin told us that Dean Jamison "made a strong
case for treating (the matter J in the house."
Most other persons with whom we spoke disagreed with
Dean Jamison's remarks. A recurring criticism was that he
was not listening to the students. R / A Weiss described his
remarks as the "second stab in the back" of the aftemixjn. R
/ A Andrews described them as "a slap in the face to the
Uj[amaa| residents," a "real kicker": it was as if Dean
Jamison were saying its "your problem and you deal with it."
Many of the residents thought Dean Jamison was giving a
"bureaucratic" Stanford position with which he was not
entirely comfortable; T / A Stacy Hamilton, a junior, said that
T / A Rene Moore, a junior, said if Alex and Fred's apology
had been sincere and if Dean Jamison had been "open to
student suggestions" the atmosphere at the meeting would
have been different.
em According to R /F Brooks, the residents "lit into | Dean
Jamison |as if Alex and Fred weren't there"; and the "meeting
turned into a verbal duel with Richard."One resident said that
several students vituperatively "attacked" Dean Jamison in
a "loud" and "insulting" manner that made her "very sad."
Sally Stewart and Loretta Cronin spoke at the meeting.
Loretta Cronin told us that she questioned Dean Jamison
about how the students could change his mind about not
removing Alex and Fred in a way that "may have come off
seeming hostile."
Dean Jamison elevated his voice as the students fired
questions and comments at him.
R / F Brooks thought the meeting was not going very well
when he arrived. The "statements were too long, some
students [were| getting recycled," there seemed to be no
ground rules and the remarks were becoming more "per
sonal." and there were not enough comments from white
residents. He did not however take control of the meeting; he
did tell R / A Andrews to get names of students who wanted
to talk and had not gotten a chance.
We asked Dean Jamison what his thoughts were on his
comments at the meeting. He said in retrospect that he "didn't
read the situation well." R / F Brooks had not told him about
the emotions at the October 14 meeting. Dean Jamison
admitted that he had "spewed out the standard [Residential
Education) line' but he had "no basis to work with the
fundamental standard as he knew of "no judicial prece
dents ' treating racial incidents as violations of the funda
mental standard.
QC's Speech.
The focus of the meeting shifted a second time when
QC spoke. His talk was the meeting's emotional
apex. Estimates of its length ranged from one and
a half to ten minutes. QC's passion surprised other
Ujamaa residents who did not think of him as a
"sensitive, emotional kind of guy." 4
QC told us that he had little reaction to Alex and Fred's
statements at the Sunday meeting. He characterized them as
4. The summary of QC's thoughts, talk, and actions is
culled from our interviews with QC and other persons who
attended the meeting. There were minor variations in the
accounts which we do not discuss; for the most part we do not
attribute quotations to specific interviewees. It was some
times difficult to distinguish between the statements that QC
made at the meeting, his thoughts, and the statements he
made in our interview.
