"typical rhetoric." He thought Alex anil Fred were "saying
whatever they could use" to get out of the situation.
When Dean Jamison spoke, however, QC "really began
to pay attention." He was struck by the "arrogance" of Dean
Jamison's assertion that the poster was "not a big deal" in
comparison to his experiences of racism in the 60s. QC
disagreed with Dean Jamison's position that the Ujamaa
residents must continue to live with and educate Alex and
Fred. He decided to talk.
QC told the group that he was angry and hurt that some
members of the staff had initially thought that he was respon
sible for defacing the Beethoven and Kappa posters.
He said that the scrawled word "Niggers" was not a "big
deal" because this "probably happens every second, every
minute across the nation"; he also said that the Beethoven
poster was unimportant. QC disagreed with Dean Jamison
that "nothing should be done" and that the Ujamaa residents
should "educate [ Alex and Fred ] in the house" because "this
all came about because I they 1 were trying to educate (Alex
and Fred | about African history [the Beethoven discussion |"
in the house. He said that it would be a "waste of time to try
to educate" persons with "such dogmatic racism who came
to Stanford with eighteen years of belligerent ideology"
since they would "just laugh behind your back and won't
accept" the black students,
QC said that what bothered him was that "these people
were living three doors down in my house"and we'Vshouldn't
have to deal with racism inside our own house"; he said he
"shouldn't have to pay $20,000 to educate white people
about racism" in his own home.
QC said the defaced Beethoven poster was "more than
just a derogatory racial poster" but that it "represented racism
in general" and reminded him of "all the [racial] things that
have happened back home | in Chicago which he described
as one of the "most racist areas in the midwest"] and at
Stanford."
In addition to being a "racist statement and a negative
stereotype," he said the poster was a "direct attack" and a
"personal insult" to him in that it was Alex and Fred's way of
saying that QC was "just ignorant."
QC told the group that he felt "personally betrayed," es
pecially by Fred.
The following discussion of the relationship among Alex,
Fred, QC and Jomo Kumar, a sophomore, in the period after
the defacing of the poster includes some details that QC did
not state at the meeting.
QC. along with agood number of other Ujamaa residents,
had suspected Alex of defacing the poster because Alex lived
in Ujamaa, had got upset du... the Beethoven conversation,
and had acted in what QC considered to be a suspicious
manner since the poster was defaced. Nonetheless, he had
had a few brief conversations with Alex about cycling. Alex
and QC are both members of the Stanford cycling club.
Fred, on the other hand, had seemed genuinely interested
in friendship and learning about black culture. On the night
ol the day that QC had found the defaced Beethoven poster.
Fred had come to QC's room and introduced himself to QC
and, his friend and fellow Ujamaa resident, Jomo. QC is an
air brush artist and was painting some letters on paper at the
time (Fred referred to this art as "graffiti" art.) Fred is
interested in Asian calligraphy. Fred said that he was a
freshman from Canada who occasionally visited Chicago
and had gone to high school in England for the past two years.
QC and Fred discussed their backgrounds, air brush art.
calligraphy, Chicago and Stanford. (In his interview with us,
Fred spoke of similarities between air brush art and Asian
calligraphy.) Fred also asked QC where he had learned that
Beethoven was black and said that he would like to read the
book some day and leam more about black culture. Fred
invited QC to visit his room and see his examples of Japanese
calligraphy. The conversation lasted about 20 minutes.
QC told us that he thought Fred's visit "peculiar." But he
attributed it to the fact that R / As were encouraging the up
perclassmen to leave their dtx>rs open so freshmen would
feel at home and feel free to come in to talk. QC had written
a message on the food for thought board that new freshmen
were welcome to drop in to his room.
QC and Jomo visited Fred's room once or twice (QC re
members two visits; Fred and Jomo remember one). They
looked at Fred's calligraphy examples and Fred loaned QC
a book on calligraphy. Two or three times when Fred came
to Ujamaa to see friends he dropped by QC's room and talked
briefly. QC, Jomo, Alex and Fred lunched together twice in
the common Naranja-Ujamaa dining room.
QC told us that he thought Fred and he would become
friends, that Fred could "share things he'd learned from
traveling overseas and living in Canada" and QC could
"share different things he'd learned about African history."
Fred told us that he was interested in becoming friends with
QC and hoped to leam more about air brush art from him.
At the meeting, QC told the group that the discovery that
Alex and Fred had defaced the poster meant that while he
mistakenly thought they were interacting as intellectual
"equals," "obviously when 1 was not around they were just
laughing and mocking whatever I skxxi for," that behind his
back they said QC was just a "dumb Nigger." He now
assumed that Fred's visits were followed by laughter with
Alex at his expense.
QC spoke movingly of racial incidents he had experi
enced. He recalled an occasion when he was about 4 and a
group of white youths on bicycles encircled him and his
mother while taunting that they were "in the Klan" and
"looking for some Niggers to bum." He also told of seeing
some of his few white high school classmates with whom he
did school work and talked during the week shouting "Nig
gers" and laughing at him and black friends from a truck on
a weekend. He said that he now thought of Alex and Fred in
the same light as he did these white high school classmates.
Addressing Dean Jamison at the Sunday meeting, QC
said that having Alex three doors away would "disturb him
and would probably disturb most black people"; that every
time he saw Alex and Fred it would bring back painful rec
ollections of the poster and other racial incidents and that
their presence would "cause dissension" in the house.
QC said that as he spoke he became "sort of upset," "emo
tional" and "choked up." R / F Brooks said QC was crying
and "water was flowing Imany others were crying]" in the
audience. R / A Johnson said "people were crying because
QC was crying and everyone knows QC doesn't cry." R / A
Weiss said it was as if the "whole room were shaking."
QC had leaned against a table at the west side of the stage
tor most of the time he talked. He was some 7 to 10 feet
diagonally behind Alex and Fred who were seated on the
edge of the east side of the stage floor. All three students were
facing the audience; Alex and Fred's backs were toward QC.
Just before the meeting broke up, QC. talking all the
while, stcxKl up and walked to within two to three feet of Alex
and Fred. From this position he made a violent remark to
them.
T / A Baldwin said that QC "stood up gesticulating,"
"threw himself at Alex and Fred" and "collapsed at the same
time." When people caught him he was "groaning and
flailing his arms"; it "seemed as if [QC] had lost his mind,"
he was "not in control of his actions" and was carried out of
the lounge to his room by about six students, in T / A Stacy
Hamilton's words, "crying, screaming and having a fit."
Naranja R / A West says QC "ran toward Alex and Fred"
"uncontrollably"; he did not think QC was "rational."
Conflicting Accounts Regarding the Knd of QC's
Speech.
There arc significant conflicts in the accounts and opin
ions about QC's ultimate words, intent and movements that
preceded the meeting's conclusion.
There are at least three different interpretations of QC's
state of mind and actions that ended the meeting: (1) he
"lunged "or "surged" toward Alex and Fred with the intent to
attack them, (2) he "lunged" or "surged" toward Alex and
Fred in an uncontrollable fit of passion, or (3) R / A Andrews
and other observers grabbed him because they mistakenly
thought he was going to lunge toward Alex and Fred either
intentionally or in a fit of passion.
Some observers say that QC clenched his fists and raised
his arms; others say QC did neither. Some students think QC
walked to the front of Alex and Fred to get their attention
since they had not appeared to be listening to him.
QC told us that he was in control of himself and just
walked to the front of Alex and Fred and then was grabtxxl.
The main variants on QC's ultimate words, which were
directed to Alex and Fred, are: (I) "the (defaced poster]
brought out violent tendencies in |mc| and part of my nature
|is]to be violent when 11 ] see this kind of thing"; (2) "I could
hurt |somc remember "am going to kill"] you punk"; (3) "I
come from Chicago and if you did what you did there they
would kill you punk," (4) "I could kill someone for this"; and
(5)"I ought to kill you but I'm not a violent person."QC told
us that he does not recall making any of these statements.
The only person who thought that there was physical
contact u as Fred, who said that QC "nudged" \lex with his
foot and "grabbed" Alex. Alex does not know if there was
contact since he moved rapidly to avoid contact and many
observers grabbed him and Fred to get them out of the lounge.
All other persons told us that there was no physical contact
between QC and Alex or Fred.
Reconciliatiwi of ('onflicts.
The opinions about QC's intent and movement are so con
flicting that it is impossible to definitively say whether or not
he intended to come into physical contact with Alex or Fred
or whether or not he acted rationally or was out of control.
The evidence supports the conclusions, however, that no
physical contact occurred among Alex, QC or Fred, and that
QC made a remark to Alex and Fred that was similar to one
of the quoted variants.
Alex and Fred's Reaction to QC's Speech.
We asked Alex and Fred what their thoughts were while
QC talked. Alex said that the speech made him "realize the
magnitudeof the problem he had caused at Ujamaa,"of "how
much damage [he] had caused." Fred said his thoughts were
"why is he thinking this; what can I do.th.th.th."
Aftermath.
Then, "all the pain broke lose." As many as 60 students
were crying with varying degrees of hysteria. At least one
student hyperventilated and had to be assisted in breathing.
According to R / F Brooks there was "utter chaos." People
were "crying, screaming," "hysterical" and "distraught." R
/FGriffin reported that "people were sobbing on each others'
shoulders and wandering around in a daze." R / A Weiss said
there was "mass chaos," "people were holding hands and
crying, tears were running down" the "staff was running
around trying to collect people." She compared the scene to
the mass hysteria that occurred when the shuttle exploded or
the U.S. exhibition air show disaster in Gemiany where a
groupof planes simultaneously crashed. R/F Bnx>ks told the
staff to "make sure no one was alone." R / A Johnson reported
that "one woman was jumping up and down saying this is not
fair." She "herded" crying persons into her room which was
a "wreck," "bodies everywhere." Dean Richardson, who
went to the house immediately after the meeting broke up,
reported that many women were sobbing, that there was
"much distress, anger, and hurt."
And in all the hysteria and confusion, some of the students
continued to argue heatedly with Dean Jamison who finally
agreed to move Alex and Fred out of Lagunita.
R/F Brooks, R / A Mc A Mister and others spirited Alex and
Fred out of the rixim to Lake Lagunita where they broke
down crying.
The Naranja residents made a "mass exodus" for the back
exit.
The Backlash
On Tuesday, October 18. 1988 Michelle Samuel, a
white Ujamaa resident, found a photocopy of a
typewritten sheet slipped under her dtx>r which
read ' NON-BLACKSLEAVEOUR HOME YOU
ARE NOT WELCOME IN UJAMAA" and at the bottom of
the sheet "Office of Residential Education 725-28(X) Under
graduate Housing Center 725-2810" (Exhibit 7). Another
copy of the sheet was found under the door of another white
Ujamaa resident, and a third was posted on a bulletin board
near the entrance to the residence.
R / A's Johnson and McAllister discussed the sheet with
R/F Brtx)ks. In view of the house's experiences with the
October 14 and 16 emergency meetings, they decided that
their better hope of allaying bad feelings was to handle the
incident informally at the night's regularly scheduled hall
meetings instead of in a full house meeting. R / A McAllis
ter decided to talk about the sheet with the residents in his hall
on an individual basis.
Laurie Rosen, a white Ujamaa freshman, told us that R /
A Johnson gathered all the females on B wing together. She
told them that she wanted to show them the sheet. R / A
Johnson said that she did not believe that a house resident had
done it. Resident Rosen told us that R / A Johnson said that
"she didn't feel this way (that nonblacks were not welcome
in Ujamaa] and that |she didn't] want them to feel un
wanted." There was more crying by black and white resi
dents.
Also, on October 18, an unknown person punched holes
in the pictures of all but three or four of the nonblack
freshmen on the "frosh board"; this person also put a hole in
the picture of one of the black freshmen. The frosh board was
a construction paper cutout display featuring small individ
ual photographs of the Ujamaa freshmen. At approximately
2 p.m. Resident Rosen asked the staff to take the pictures
down because parents' weekend was approaching and she
did not want her parents to see the mutilated picture board.
Several hours later that day R / A Weiss took the pictures
down and destroyed them.
On Wednesday, October 19, the Ujamaa staff organized a
meeting to allow the nonblack residents to discuss their
reactions to the sheet and frosh board. According to Larry
Sussman, a white Ujamaa freshman, some of the attendees
thought that the house should keep these incidents to itself
because publicity would "just make things worse for the
black community"; other residents disagreed and felt that
this would be sweeping the incidents "under the carpel." Ap
parently the group reached a consensus not to discuss the
matter with outsiders, especially the press. There were some
dissenters and at least two nonblack Ujamaaa residents felt
strongly enough that they have sought to discuss the incident
with President Kennedy.
The residents with whom we spoke had mixed feelings
about the sheet and frosh board. Some thought they were an
expected backlash to the defaced posters. Others were hurt.
They saw the mutilated photos as a personal attack by
someone, perhaps even an implication of violence; they saw
the sheet as someone's statement that white residents were
not welcome in, or an invitation to leave. Ujamaa.
On November 4. 1988 R / F Brboks found a homemade
sticker which read "Avenge Ujaama smash the Honkie Op
pressors!" near his Ujamaa apartment; another copy of the
sticker was subsequently found in White Plaza (Exhibit 8). R
/ F Brtx)ks doubts that these stickers were done by a resident
because in his opinion blacks do not commonly use the term
"honkie" and "Ujaama" is misspelled.
Postscript
At this writing, the person or persons responsible for the
Niggers poster, notes to Alex, the "nonblacks out of Ujamaa"
sheet, the holes in the frosh board, and the "honkie" sticker
are not known.
