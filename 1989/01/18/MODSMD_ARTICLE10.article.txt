## Gunman kills 5, wounds 30 in Stockton schoolyard 
### 
STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) - A
camouflaged drifter with a long criminal
record invaded a schoolyard at recess yes
terday and opened fire with an assault
rifle, killing five children and wounding
at least 30 others before taking his own
life, police said.
Patrick West, 24, who most recently
lived in Lodi, Calif., fatally wounded him
self in the head after firing a hail of
bullets as hundreds of students milled
around on the campus of Cleveland
Elementary School, said Deputy Police
Chief Lucian Neely, who provided the
identity of the gunman.
Children ran screaming as their class
mates fell.
West, also known as Patrick Purdy,
had an "extensive criminal record," said
Neely, who added that many of the crimes
were committed in the Los Angeles area
and included soliciting for sex and nar
cotics and weapons violations.
"At this point there are six dead and
30 injured," said Bruce Fernandes, a
spokesman for the San Joaquin County
Office of Emergency Services. One of the
wounded was a teacher; the rest were
students.
Neely said five of the dead were

children and the sixth was West, who
shot himself in the head after the mas
sacre. There was no apparent motive, he
added.
"Before it was over, he killed himself,"
Neely said, adding that at least 15 of the
wounded were in critical condition in this
city about 80 miles southeast of San
Francisco.
Deputy Police Chief Ralph Tribble said
the gunman, in camouflaged combat
fatigues, a flak jacket and ear plugs, ap
parently set his 1977 Chevrolet station
wagon ablaze as a diversion before en
tering the campus at about 11:40 a.m.
PST with two handguns and an AK-47
assault rifle "with a full banana clip"
and opening fire.
Neely gave this description of the se
quence of events:
West entered the schoolyard through a
gap in a fence after parking his car
nearby. He opened fire on the west side
of a group of portable classrooms, then
moved to the east side and continued
firing across the blacktopped yard,
towards the main buildings about 250
yards away.
About 60 rounds were fired; in some
cases, the bullets went completely

through the main school building and
came out the other side to fall spent on
the L-shaped school's front lawn, Neely
said.
As police cleaned up the carnage, a
large handgun and the AK-47 were seen
lying on the ground near a pool of blood.
Written on the pistol's handle was the
word "Victory." The letters SSA were
printed on the rifle's clip in letters over
one inch long.
The torched car was registered to
Patrick Purdy, who lived with an aunt
and uncle last July through October in
Sandy, Ore. Sandy Police Chief Fred Pun
zel said West purchased an AK-47 from
the Sandy Trading Post last Aug. 3.
"She told me he was a loner and as a
child he was an alcoholic," Punzel said
of his conversation with the aunt, Julie
Michael.
Punzel said Michael told him West left
Oregon for a job as a boilermaker in
Texas. That job fell through and he went
to Memphis. The aunt and uncle last
heard from West at Thanksgiving, when
he was in Connecticut, Punzel said.
"He seemed like a real nice young
man," said next-door neighbor Pat
Thomas, 45, who met West in Sandy last

summer. "He was here looking for work."
Lori Mackey, who teaches deaf children,
said she heard sounds like firecrackers
and quickly ran to her window.
She said she saw a man standing in
the schoolyard, spraying gunfire back and
forth as 400-500 students from grades
1-3 were at recess.
"He was just standing there with a
gun, making wide sweeps," she said.
When she realized what was happening,
she took her 10 students into a rear room
where they couldn't be seen, telephoned
the office and locked her classroom door.
"He was not talking, he was not yelling,
he was very straight-faced, it did not look
like he was really angry.
"There was mass chaos. There were
kids running in every direction," she said.
"I was there right away," said Cheryl
Torres, whose 11-year-old daughter,
LeAnne Sundstrom, is a student at the
school. "There were a dozen students
lying on the ground. It was very frighten
ing.
Neely identified the dead students as
Raphanar Or, 9, a boy; and girls Ram
Chun, 8; Thuy Tran, 6, Sokhim An, 6,
and Oeun Lim, 8. All were children of
refugee families from Southeast Asia.

Lt. Fred Nixon of the Los Angeles
Police Department described the AK-47
as a "military assault rifle. You use it
for one purpose and one purpose only â€”
to kill a human being."
The AK-47 is a Russian design, but
Chinese replicas are available in many
gun stores for around $300. It is capable
of firing about 600 rounds per minute
on automatic, although automatic weap
ons are illegal in California.
"I just saw him fall down," said student
Ramon Billedo 111, who saw a schoolmate
shot. "His head hit the ground. The
teacher grabbed him and dragged him
inside the other classroom."
"Some kids were outside and some man
came over here shooting like crazy. A few
kids got shot," said Ricardo Rivera, 10,
a fifth grader.
"They were shooting at my classroom
and at (Rivera's) classroom at reading
time," said another student, Roberto
Costa. "The bullets were hitting the
walls. Everybody got scared."
The area, about four blocks from the
University of Pacific campus, is a middle
class residential area. Several churches
are in the area near the school.
