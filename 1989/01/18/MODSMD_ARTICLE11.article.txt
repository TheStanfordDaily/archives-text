### 
VIENNA, Austria (AP) â€” West
ern nations criticized the human
rights records of some East Eu
ropean countries yesterday, sin
gling out recent harsh police ac
tions the United States called a
"glaring contradiction" of interna
tional commitments.
At a conference of foreign min
isters, outgoing Secretary of State
George Shultz coupled praise for
the Soviet Union's new openness
under President Mikhail S. Gor
bachev with criticism of some of
its allies.
He was more direct than most
West European ministers, attack
ing Czechoslovakia, East Ger
many, Bulgaria and Romania by
name for police crackdowns on
dissidents and persecution of mi
norities.
Shultz and his colleagues gath
ered at the end of a 27-Tintmth
conference to review the 1975 Hel
sinki agreements on European se
curity and cooperation, including
human rights. The Helsinki ac
cords were signed by 35 countries:
the United States, Canada and all
European nations except Albania.
Delegates had barely adopted
their final document Sunday when
Czechoslovak riot police crushed
a rally in Prague.
The police used water cannons
and tear gas again Monday and
yesterday on dissidents honoring
Jan Palach. The 20-year-old stu
dent burned himself alive Jan. 16,
1969, to protest the Soviet-led in
vasion of the previous August that
ended Czechoslovakia's brief
"Prague Spring" liberalization.
