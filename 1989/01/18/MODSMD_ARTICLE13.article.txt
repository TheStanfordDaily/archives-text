### 
WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Premier Mieczyslaw
Rakowski yesterday urged the Communist Party to
legalize Solidarity for a two-year trial period on
condition it he a government partner, not a foe that
would "pull the country into anarchy."
Rakowski indicated the outlawed independent
labor federation would have to declare itself a part
of socialism, observe a strike moratorium and give
up financial aid from the West amounting to millions
of dollars.
Final legalization would come only after a two
year probationary period when both sides would
evaluate their "positive and negative experiences,"
Rakowski told a meeting of the 230-member Central

Committee.
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and other spokes
men for the union movement declined official com
ment before the final decision of the committee,
which continued its meeting early into today behind
closed doors.
But a Solidarity source in Warsaw said on con
dition of anonymity that Rakowski's offer at first
glance appeared unclear and the conditions he set
"unacceptable" or even "laughable."
He cited specifically the requirement that
Solidarity declare itself to be socialist and that it
refrain from all strikes. He said Solidarity must be
able to function as a free trade union movement.
