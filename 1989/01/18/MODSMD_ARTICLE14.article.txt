# Rioting continues in Miami
## Schools closed, pro basketball game canceled on 2nd day of violence 
### 
MIAMI (AP) — Looting and
vandalism spread yesterday and
seven people were shot, one fatal
ly, in the second day of rioting
sparked by the fatal shooting of
an unarmed black motorcyclist by
a white policeman.
Schools were closed, a profes
sional basketball game was can
celed, and some fans were
stranded in the arena. Snipers
fired at police, who cordoned off
a 130-block area of the predomi
nantly black Overtown neighbor
hood.
After nightfall, authorities told
law-abiding citizens to remain in
doors and began a block-by-block
sweep.
"For the sake of our city, I ap
peal to every citizen regardless of
race to stay calm, get off the
streets and stay in your homes,
said Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez
in a televised appeal yesterday
night.
"We are arresting people and
we are being a lot more aggressive
in the enforcement of the law and
I think we have to be," Suarez
added. "I don't think this will con
tinue after today"
Authorities said Overtown, just
north of downtown, was largely
quiet after police entered. Within

'I don't think this
will continue after
today.'

Miami mayor

three hours about 56 people had
been arrested, mostly for looting.
But the violence already had
spread to Liberty City, a separate
black community several miles to
the northwest, where looting and
gunfire continued yesterday
night.
Police said they made an arrest
in the fatal shooting of a young
black man in Liberty City at 10:20
p.m., but hadn't determined if it
was related to the rioting.
Officer Eric Butler, wearing a
bulletproof vest, was shot in the
vest at 9:3o*p.m. by a sniper who
was later arrested on top of a
three-story building. Butler was
not seriously injured.
Plans were made for up to 500
National Guard troops to be
mobilized within two hours if the
violence continued, said Brian Bal

lard, a spokesman for Gov. Bob
Martinez.
Top police officials said the
tough stance would not bring a
violent reaction because only a few
people were violating the law.
Trouble erupted again yester
day afternoon when a white man
in a luxury car reportedly fired
into a crowd of blacks in the area,
wounding one person before
driving away.
"All I know is that one person
was hit in the side," police spokes
man Angelo Bitsis said, adding
that the unidentified victim was
hospitalized in fair condition.
Sporadic gunfire continued
throughout the day. Police said
officers rescued one shooting vic
tim while under fire, and returned
fire at another man, injuring him
in the leg. Later, a man with a
bullet wound in his leg was ar
rested when he showed up at a
hospital for treatment. A sixth
person was shot in the leg in
Liberty City.
About 25 youths shattered car
windows outside the Miami Arena
on the border of Overtown, where
the National Basketball Associa
tion's Miami Heat was scheduled
to play the Phoenix Suns last
night. The game was canceled.
