Alleged Harvard, UC quotas probed
BOSTON (AP) — Federal investigators are ex
ploring whether Harvard and the University of
California at Los Angeles use illegal quotas to
restrict the number of Asian-American students
they admit, an official said yesterday.
The U.S. Department of Education has been
collecting and analyzing statistical information
on admissions at the two schools since last fall,
said department spokesman Mahlon Anderson.
He declined to say what sparked the probe.
No conclusions have been reached, he said.
Both Harvard and UCLA deny using quotas
for any ethnic groups, and both schools point to
a significant rise in enrollment of Asian-American
students.
At UCLA, Asian-Americans make up 2*2.9 per
cent of the freshman class, up from 17.8 percent
in 1980. At Harvard, the number of Asian-
American freshmen roughly tripled over the past
decade, from 4.8 percent in 1978 to 14.2 percent
this year.

By comparison, the U.S. population is only
about 2 percent Asian. However, Education De
partment officials say Asian-Americans tend to
be high academic achievers and have been apply
ing to top colleges and universities in rising num
bers.
Heart danger predictable in babies
MONTEREY, Calif. (AP) — Doctors believe
they can predict in babies 6 months of age which
ones are likely to grow up to have high cholesterol,
showing that heart disease — and its prevention
— begin early in life, according to a report Tues
day.
Ihe findings, which emerge from a long
running study in Louisiana, suggest that high
cholesterol levels and high blood pressure have
begun to do damage by the time children are in
their teens.
"Adult heart disease very clearly begins in
childhood,' said Dr, Gerald S. Berenson of Lou
isiana State Universitv Medical Center.
