COP's political aims
haven't hampered its
commitment to students

WHEN THIS YEAR'S Coun
cil of Presidents was
elected last April, many
students were concerned that A
New Slate of Mind, representing
the People's Platform, would con
fine its actions to the political
sphere, ignoring student bread
and-butter issues.
Those concerns have been
dashed. As they promised, this
year's COP has proven especially
responsive to student needs
through programs like the course
consultants, the "Beat the Book
store" booth and the planned dorm
representatives program.
They deserve commendation for
their efforts to assuage the enor
mous financial burdens of Stanford
as well as to provide advice about
courses when many students are
uncertain of their academic pro
gram for the quarter, checking out
a myriad of courses in an effort
to find three or four they wish to
take.
The course consultants in White
Plaza, representing diverse aca
demic disciplines, assisted between
200 and 300 students with their
class selection.
The "Beat the Bookstore" pro
gram provided many students with
school supplies at prices below
those of the Bookstore. Moreover,

the textbook mart, where students
can attempt to sell their used books
for more than Mie Bookstore would
pay for them, is an excellent idea,
one which ought to be expanded.
While the Bookstore pays only
half the wholesale price for used
texts and then resells them for 75
percent of the new value, the book
mart, eliminating the middleman
and thus operating costs, can at
tain more value for both the buyer
and seller.
The ASSU's buying textbooks
for large introductory classes is an
other boon to students' pockets.
Leaving the used textbook at the
mart for a specified price, a student
can return later in the day to col
lect her cash if someone decided
to purchase the book at the offered
price.
Besides the course consultants
and the "Beat the Bookstore" pro
gram, the COP has embarked on
a dorm representatives program,
mostly in freshman residences.
Roughly 100 students report to the
ASSU about student concerns
through surveys during weekly
meetings.
Not only does the COP thus ob
tain ideas for new programs ben
eficial to students, it also is better
placed to report student concerns
at committee meetings of the
Board of Trustees.
We extend well deserved praise
to this year's COP of Stacey
Leyton, Canetta Ivy, Miguel Mar
quez and David Brown and urge
them to continue to expand and
initiate programs that address stu
dent needs.
