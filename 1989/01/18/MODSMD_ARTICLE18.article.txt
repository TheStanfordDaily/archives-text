## Racism-education link raises many questions 
### 
IN HIS LETTER to The Daily on
Jan. 13, Telford Work claimed a
desire to examine why a couple of
freshmen would deface a poster with a
racial slur. The bulk of his "explora
tion" of the problem, however, was an -
attack on the CIV program which drew
from such works as "The Closing of
the American Mind."
Beyond basing his letter on a mis
taken premise (the freshmen involved
in the Ujamaa incident weren't protest
ing the dilution of Western Culture;
rather, they drunkenly imagined that
creating a Beethoven-as-a-black carica
ture would be hysterical), Work
believes that the ongoing quest for the
good has come to an end, culminating
in Western Culture.
He writes, "Truth is truth and lies
are lies, and anything to the contrary
is relativistic hogwash." Undoubtedly,
but that tautology doesn't help at all.
There is no simple answer to the
question "What is Truth?" If the
solution to that question were com
pletely embodied in any one text, we

could simply pore over its meaning to
the exclusion of everything else.
Instead, we must constantly compare
notes; we must contrast Augustine and
Dante, the Bible and Machiavelli with
our own experiences in an attempt to
derive a coherent philosophy In the
end, all texts have something positive
to contribute to our frame of mind.
That is why a Western Culture track
can read Hitler and Nietszche, as I did
last year in SLE, without worrying
that its students will turn into fascists.
That is why the works of "Guatemalan
revolutionaries," which Mr. Work
scorns, might have some value, though
probably not as much as a Greek
revolutionary by the name of Plato.
All the authors mentioned above
provide a different perspective on the
crucial puzzle "What is the Good?"
that humankind has been attempting
to solve forever. The only "deadly
ideas" are that entire philosophies are
utterly devoid of value and deserve to
be purged from the realm of ideas.
In the end, though, I think the

biggest problem with Work's letter is
that it unconsciously raises many more
issues than the one it attempted and
failed to address. What follows is a
sampling:
How do we avoid the racial polariza
tion which he cites as the cause of the
Ujamaa incident? In his own letter,
Work makes it clear that such a prob
lem has been around since the early
'80s at least, in both his freshman
dorm and an ethnic theme house.
In"The Closing of the American
Mind," author Allan Bloom attributes
the source of racial divisiveness to the
behavior of blacks. At one point, he
explians that blacks seem unapproach
able because they hang out together so
often. According to Bloom, this self
segregation is so extensive that whites
have no idea how to deal with blacks
as individuals.
Is that truly the case? Why would/do
people assume members of an ethnic
group cannot retain their individuality?
What is the point of a Western
Culture or CIV program? To get a

better job? To provide critical thinking
skills? To become exposed to new and
different ideas? To determine one's
own philosophy? To eliminate cultural
stereotypes? What do we do when we
fail to meet these goals? To what
extent should we hold our secondary
schools responsible for these goals?
Will programs like CIV worsen the
racial situation? Is the racial situation
really any better in the real world, as
Work seems to think? If you can learn
from Italians, Greeks and Jews even
though you are none of the above, why
couldn't whites learn from blacks?
Considering all Western Culture tracks
chose less than half of the core list,
what is the problem? How many of the
classics, those who rank with Marx or
Freud, were actually removed from
CIV?
And finally, supposing that the CIVs
of the country do cause a fundamental
change, who is to say it will be for the
worst?
