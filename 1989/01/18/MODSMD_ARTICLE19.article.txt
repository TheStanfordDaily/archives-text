# KZSU apologizes for airing offensive song
## 
### 
I am writing in response to an inci
dent which occurred at KZSU. Some
one called up and requested a song
called "Crack Attack" by a group
known as "Big Stick."
Unbeknownst to the disc jockey, the
song contained many racially offensive
words. Immediately following the song
a student listener came down to the
station to complain to the disc jockey
about the song.
The incident upset all the members
of our station because every song that
gets played over our airwaves reflects

on the entire station. I do not believe
the song "Crack Attack" is reflective of
the ideas or beliefs of the 85 volun
teers at our station.
There is no question in my mind
that the song was played in error;
however, I do not think that is an
excuse for playing the song. Although
the harm was unintended, we at KZSU
feel a need to respond to it neverthe
less.
On behalf of KZSU, 1 apologize to
the student who took the time to come
down to the station to express his
outrage regarding the song. I would
also like to thank him for bringing the
problem to our attention. I also
apologize to other listeners who may
have been offended.

As a former disc jockey, I can attest
that most of the time you get a re
quest, you do your best to play it un
less you already know there is a some
thing patently offensive and unaccepta
ble contained within it. In this case, I
believe the error in playing the song to
be an honest one.
However, I think it is important to
prevent groups like "Big Stick" and
songs like "Crack Attack" from being
promoted. I have removed the album
from our record library and have con
tacted other Bay Area radio stations
and asked them to do the same.
Our disc jockeys, sports announcers
and news reporters work hard at pro
viding quality programs to our lis-

teners in the Stanford community. Our
primary goal as a college radio station
is to train students in the field of
radio broadcasting so they can make a
positive contribution to the communi
cation industry Part of that contribu
tion needs to begin with our staff
members being more conscious of their
individual actions in the studio, in the
edit room and on the air.
Part of that contribution comes from
our receiving and responding to feed
back from the community. I hope that
in the future, more students will take
the time to come see me or speak to
me about issues that concern them.
