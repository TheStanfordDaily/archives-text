# Report explores motives of frosh
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
The University's report on the inci
dents at Ujamaa House describes, for
the first time, the thoughts and moti
vations of the two principal figures dur
ing the three-week affair.
Outside of a brief statement issued
the night after the meeting at which
they confessed to defacing a poster in
Ujamaa, freshmen Ben Dugan and Gus
Heldt have not commented publicly on
the incidents.
In interviews conducted by University
investigators, however, Dugan and
Heldt revealed the reasons for their ac
tion and the emotional conflicts they
experienced leading up to the Oct. 16
meeting.
Dugan and Heldt said they were in
itially upset by a conversation with

about eight other Lagunita Court resi
dents that shifted from the subject of
black influences on music to the issue
of racial purity. In particular, sopho
more B.J. Kerr said, the report states,
that Beethoven was black because some
of Beethoven's ancestors were black.
Heldt said Kerr's assertion was dis
turbing because it was a "racial defini
tion, based on ancestry. I was raised in
a multiracial neighborhood. My best
friend was from a multiracial family. I
believed in 'individual,' not 'racial,'
identity. 1 see (racial purity) as a concept
that does no one any good."
Dugan and Heldt admitted they were
"drunk and stoned" when they defaced
the Beethoven poster and posted it out
side Kerr's door.
"It was an emotional reaction to what
it was like for me to be there (Ujamaa).
I never saw it as a bad place to live. I

was learning a lot. But there were cer
tain things about (Ujamaa) and (certain)
people that didn't click ... I had no
malicious thought," Dugan said.
The report said that Dugan was "par
ticularly disturbed" that a black Ujamaa
resident had said she would never marry
a white person. "He seemingly could
not understand how anyone could make
such a choice based on race."
Heldt said that he and Dugan had
thought the idea of defacing the poster
was "tremendously funny" and that he
never thought people would be offended.
He said his experiences of being dis
criminated against as a Jew living in
England had given him the ability to
see "humor as a release."
He added that since he had been ed
ucated in Canada, the most he knew
"about American history is the
fur trade."
In the days after the defacing
of the poster, Heldt said he felt
"ashamed and guilty." He con
sulted his advising associate, who
suggested that he do nothing and
hope that the issue would "blow
over."
The report said that last year
Kerr and other male Ujamaa res
idents had hung a sexist poster.
A friend of Heldt's told the inves
tigators that Heldt said Kerr was
a hypocrite to be offended by the
Beethoven poster since he "had
done the same thing last year."
When an Ujamaa Theme Asso
ciate was tipped that someone
with an English accent had been

overheard saying he had defaced
the poster, he went to Heldt, who
has such an accent. The TA told
Heldt that "people are suspicious
of you" and that there were people
planning "to beat the hell out of
you."
Heldt then confessed and said
Dugan had defaced the poster
with him.
At the Oct. 16 meeting, Heldt
told the Lagunita residents that
he was "shocked to come (to Stan
ford) and find people who cared
so much about race" and had been
overwhelmed by the emphasis on
"ethnic differences and pluralism
in orientation."
He added that he and Dugan
thought the poster was "a joke"
and had a "satirical message."
Later in the meeting, Dugan
said, "I owe everyone a big apol
ogy, I hope everything can be

worked out, I'm really sorry. I
realize how much I hurt the
house."
Heldt said he thought an apol
ogy was inadequate because the
black students would think he was
"another silly white boy who
thinks if he apologizes everything
will be OK."
The report says residents con
sidered the attitude of Dugan and
Heldt "arrogant," "insincere,"
"condescending" and "patroniz
ing."
Dugan said he had been scared
about the meeting but "felt very
responsible and needed to be pun
ished."
Dugan added that Kerr's speech
at the end of the meeting made
him "realize the magnitude of the
problem he had caused at
Ujamaa."
