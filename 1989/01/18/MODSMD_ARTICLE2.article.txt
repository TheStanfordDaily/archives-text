# Report explores motives of frosh

### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
The University's report on the inci
dents at Ujamaa House describes, for
the first time, the thoughts and moti
vations of the two principal figures dur
ing the three-week affair.
Outside of a brief statement issued
the night after the meeting at which
they confessed to defacing a poster in
Ujamaa, freshmen Ben Dugan and Gus
Heldt have not commented publicly on
the incidents.
In interviews conducted by University
investigators, however, Dugan and
Heldt revealed the reasons for their ac
tion and the emotional conflicts they
experienced leading up to the Oct. 16
meeting.
Dugan and Heldt said they were in
itially upset by a conversation with

about eight other Lagunita Court resi
dents that shifted from the subject of
black influences on music to the issue
of racial purity. In particular, sopho
more B.J. Kerr said, the report states,
that Beethoven was black because some
of Beethoven's ancestors were black.
Heldt said Kerr's assertion was dis
turbing because it was a "racial defini
tion, based on ancestry. I was raised in
a multiracial neighborhood. My best
friend was from a multiracial family. I
believed in 'individual,' not 'racial,'
identity. 1 see (racial purity) as a concept
that does no one any good."
Dugan and Heldt admitted they were
"drunk and stoned" when they defaced
the Beethoven poster and posted it out
side Kerr's door.
"It was an emotional reaction to what
it was like for me to be there (Ujamaa).
I never saw it as a bad place to live. I

was learning a lot. But there were cer
tain things about (Ujamaa) and (certain)
people that didn't click ... I had no
malicious thought," Dugan said.
The report said that Dugan was "par
ticularly disturbed" that a black Ujamaa
resident had said she would never marry
a white person. "He seemingly could
not understand how anyone could make
such a choice based on race."
Heldt said that he and Dugan had
thought the idea of defacing the poster
was "tremendously funny" and that he
never thought people would be offended.
He said his experiences of being dis
criminated against as a Jew living in
England had given him the ability to
see "humor as a release."
He added that since he had been ed
ucated in Canada, the most he knew
