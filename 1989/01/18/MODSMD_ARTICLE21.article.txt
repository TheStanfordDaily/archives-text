## Kennedy's statement didn't say much 
### 
UNIVERSITY President Donald
Kennedy's "thoughtful paper"
on Jan. 11 about achieving a
"mature multicultural community" at
best attempted to appease and quiet
ethnic minorities with convoluted and
eloquent rhetoric that did not really
say anything, and, at worst, sides
tepped and thus belittled the struggle
of ethnic minorities on this campus.
Does Kennedy really take this prob
lem seriously? I don't think so.
He used a lot of safe and simple
truisms to prove that he is sincere
("In creating that community we have
undertaken a formidable task"), realis
tic ("Some ignorance will survive even
the best efforts at education"), caring
("we need to acknowledge the feelings
of hurt and anger that are often the
result of bigotry or insensitivity"), and
optimistic ("We are clearly not there
yet, but it is an objective we can at
tain.") How nice.
Kennedy is a master of politics,
meaning that he can say a lot without
meaning anything. He'll do what he
has to do until the fire dies down, but
when all the smoke is cleared, what
has really been done? Not nearly
enough.
He asserts that as an educational
institution, "we can make cultural
differences an important part of what
we teach." Then he goes on to say:
"We need to make the contributions
and experiences of ethnic and religious
minorities part of a whole variety of
courses that deal . . . with contempo
rary society . . . courses that reach

across the curriculum."
Too bad his actions don't support
his words. This is especially evident in
his treatment of Asian American
Studies on this campus. There is no
such curriculum here, although Asian
Americans make up the largest minor
ity group on campus.
The Afro-American Studies program
was implemented only after Martin
Luther King Jr. was assassinated and
the Black Student Union stole the
mike from the speaker at an assembly
the day after the assassination. Does

extreme tragedy have to strike before
the University acts?
While Kennedy claims that Stanford
gives "others a glimpse of what the
future can be like," he fails to see that
not only on campuses on the West
Coast but even now on the East Coast,
institutional programs exist for ethnic
studies that Stanford lacks. Some of
these came about only after student
protests, rallies, sit-ins and strikes.
I had hoped for more from Stanford.
I had hoped that there were more
cooperative and positive avenues to
change on this campus. Too bad there
aren't.
Kennedy believes in freedom of
speech. Theoretically, he is right. But
as an institution, whose very purpose
for existing is to educate, are sanctions
against such actions too much to ask
for? Freedom of speech is not even the
issue â€” it is the freedom for everyone
to be here without fearing that some
one else's ignorance means a loss of
my dignity and humanity.
Finally, Kennedy makes a grand
attempt to lift the responsibility from
his shoulders. Perhaps one of the
many reasons for the heightened racial
tensions on this campus is his belief
that "we should not expect too much."
If he does not expect too much of
himself, I hope it does not discourage
ethnic minorities and all of those
struggling for their rights, to continue
to fight for what we believe this uni
versity should and truly can be.

Julie Ann Su is an undeclared sopho
more.
