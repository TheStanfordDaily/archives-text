## New technique saves lives with safer X-ray imaging of arteries 
### Jock Friedly Senior staff writer 
SAN FRANCISCOâ€”In a de
velopment that might save
hundreds of lives per year in
the United States, Stanford sci
entists have developed a safer
technique for identifying
clogged arteries, which often
signal advanced heart disease.
Scientists hope the new X-ray
technique will replace the cur
rent method doctors use to
diagnose a potentially fatal con
dition called atherosclerosis. In
this disease, fatty deposits and
plaque obstruct the flow of
blood from the heart. Con
stricted blood vessels can lead
to heart attacks, which strike
about one million Americans
each year.
Scientists hope that in addi
tion to saving lives, they will
be able to garner valuable data
presently unavailable on the de
velopment of atherosclerosis.
The new technique created

by Medicine Prof. Edward
Rubenstein may allow doctors
to determine the danger of
heart attack for many more
patients than current methods
accomodate.
The presently-used tech
nique for finding at
herosclerosis, called arterial
catheterization, sometimes
endangers the patient's life.
The process requires the inser
tion of a catheter, a slender
tube inserted into the arteries
near the heart. The catheter
injects a dye into the
bloodstream which coats the
arterial deposits and shows up
when exposed to X-rays.
The extent of the clogging is
then determined by normal X
rays tracking the deposits in
the bloodstream.
But in 1 percent of the cases,
this method poses danger be
cause catheters inserted in the
arteries can dislodge deposits,


Fatty deposits and plaque accumulates on the artery walls,
constricting the flow of blood to and from the heart.
