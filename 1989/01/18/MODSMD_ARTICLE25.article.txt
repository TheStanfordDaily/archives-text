## New technique saves lives with safer X-ray imaging of arteries 
### Jock Friedly Senior staff writer 
SAN FRANCISCOâ€”In a de
velopment that might save
hundreds of lives per year in
the United States, Stanford sci
entists have developed a safer
technique for identifying
clogged arteries, which often
signal advanced heart disease.
Scientists hope the new X-ray
technique will replace the cur
rent method doctors use to
diagnose a potentially fatal con
dition called atherosclerosis. In
this disease, fatty deposits and
plaque obstruct the flow of
blood from the heart. Con
stricted blood vessels can lead
to heart attacks, which strike
about one million Americans
each year.
Scientists hope that in addi
tion to saving lives, they will
be able to garner valuable data
presently unavailable on the de
velopment of atherosclerosis.
The new technique created

by Medicine Prof. Edward
Rubenstein may allow doctors
to determine the danger of
heart attack for many more
patients than current methods
accomodate.
The presently-used tech
nique for finding at
herosclerosis, called arterial
catheterization, sometimes
endangers the patient's life.
The process requires the inser
tion of a catheter, a slender
tube inserted into the arteries
near the heart. The catheter
injects a dye into the
bloodstream which coats the
arterial deposits and shows up
when exposed to X-rays.
The extent of the clogging is
then determined by normal X
rays tracking the deposits in
the bloodstream.
But in 1 percent of the cases,
this method poses danger be

arteries can dislodge deposits,


Fatty deposits and plaque accumulates on the artery walls,
constricting the flow of blood to and from the heart.
causing complications when loose
in the bloodstream. The loosened
material travels into the heart
causing a heart attack, or into the
brain causing a stroke. One in 10
patients with complications will
die as a result.
The risk therefore makes the
currently-used procedure un
desireable for doctors to use ex
cept for patients suspected to have
advanced degrees of heart disease.
One million such procedures are
performed every year.
Since researchers have had such
limited opportunity to watch the
various stages of the disease, little
is known about how at
herosclerosis develops.
The new imaging discovery ex
ploits the technology of
synchrotron radiation, X-ray ra
diation given off by accelerated
charged particles such as electrons
traveling around a ring.
Synchrotron radiation can be fine
tuned to the particular frequency
of radiation needed to highlight
the dyed deposits.
This is just what the doctor
ordered.
The fine-tuned frequency gives
a more precise picture than con
ventional X-rays, thus allowing
doctors to inject the X-ray sensi

tive dye into the arm or leg rather
than near the heart with an in
serted catheter.
The procedure is expected to
save hundreds of lives lost when
patients suffer heart attacks or
strokes from the dislodging of ar
terial deposits.
With the new procedure, the
only dose of X-rays received are
to develop the picture of the ar
teries because the synchrotron X
rays are fine-tuned and because
additional X-rays are not needed
to track the location of a catheter
as was previously the case.
Rubenstein's collaborators were
scientists from the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Labora
tory, the Physics department, the
School of Medicine and the Brook
haven National Laboratory in
New York.
At present, the technique can
only be performed at Stanford and
Brookhaven, where there are
synchrotron accelerators used for
physics research.
Although scientists expect the
new process to be less expensive
than arterial catheterization, the
technique requires the use of rare
synchrotron accelerators.
Rubenstein said accelerators
might be built specially for this
procedure, but the smallest work
able machine size for one of these
machines will have to be a ring
of 30 feet in diameter.
