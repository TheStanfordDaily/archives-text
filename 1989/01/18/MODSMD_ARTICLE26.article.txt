# Inroads into study of viral replication
## Model lends new twist to AIDS study 
### Jock Friedly Senior staff writer 
SAN FRANCISCO - A Stan
ford researcher announced yester
day he has discovered a method
to study the replication of the
AIDS virus that might be an im
portant tool in finding a treatment
for the disease.
Performed in a test tube, the
research elucidates the mecha
nism of viral replication — en
hancing the understanding and
research of AIDS and its class of
viruses known as retroviruses. In
their replication, viruses must
take over the genetic machinery
of the host cells.
In addition to the possible uses
in fighting disease, this model for
studying viral replication gives ex
perts the necessary technology for
developing gene therapy — a con
troversial process in which defec
tive genes are replaced by normal
ones.
Patrick Brown, assistant pro
fessor of pediatrics and bio
chemistry, announced the dis
covery yesterday at the annual
meeting of the American Associ
ation for the Advancement of Sci
ence at the Hilton Hotel. Brown
collaborated with researchers at
UC-San Francisco.
Taking over the cell
To replicate, retroviruses attach
themselves to the host cell, then
use the cell's genetic tools to forge
new viruses. Capturing the cell's
genetic machinery involves a
many-step process in which
viruses splice their own genes into
the genes of the cell.
Each step of the process gives
scientists a front to attack the
viruses. The complete under
standing of any one of the splicing
or replication steps might enable
scientists to find a method to stop
the retroviruses from replicating.
Halting this process would
presumably create a cure for the
disease.
With his contribution to under

standing viral replication, Brown
solved a crucial puzzle for bioc
hemists. He has illuminated the
dynamics of viral DNA as it be
comes inserted into the cell.
Brown said he has found a very
basic answer to the puzzle that
will allow scientists to observe the
intermediate compounds formed
as viral DNA is inserted into the
host DNA. These "intermediates"
are the vulnerable compounds
that can be targeted for halting
replication. Certain drugs, called
replication inhibitors, block the
replication of retroviruses.
Disposing of the old theory
The answer to the crucial ques
tion of viral replication has come
as somewhat of a shock for bio
chemists, who favored a theory
that the viral DNA inserted into
the victim cell's DNA is basically
unchanged when it is spliced into
the cell.
Brown's work, however, indi
cates that this theory does not
accurately describe the dynamics
of viruses. Instead, the research
shows that the linear DNA first
wraps around itself and forms a
closed loop. To be inserted into
the cell, the loop breaks, but not
exactly in the same way it was
joined.
After the break, the strands do
not line up exactly in the same
position as before. Proteins then
slightly modify the strands at the
ends, which makes them able to
be easily inserted.
Brown made the discovery with
his colleagues by working with a
mouse leukemia retrovirus but he
said the same integration process
occurs in all retroviruses.
Gene therapy controversy
Although the discovery yields
hope for an effective treatment or
cure for AIDS, use of the tech
nique for gene therapy might be
come an item of hot debate.
