## 'Burning' is all smoke, no fire 
### Gene Anaya Staff writer 
Martin Luther King had a dream of
freedom and respect for all, and it was
this dream which planted the seed for
"Mississippi Burning," the latest film
from director Alan Parker
("Fame," "Pink Floyd - The Wall,"
"Angel Heart"). Though fictionalized,
Chris Gerolmo's screenplay is loosely
based on the murder of two Northern
Jewish students, Andrew Goodman and
Michael Schwerner, and a local black
student, James Chaney, who were at
tempting to register black Mississippi
voters in 1964.
"Mississippi Burning" follows the at
tempt of two FBI agents, Ward (Willem
Dafoe) and Anderson (Gene Hackman),
to find the missing bodies and bring
their killers to justice.
Unfortunately, it is this search that
is the focus of the movie, instead of the
deeper issues of civil rights and racism.
In fact, in the entire movie only two

soliloquies, by Anderson and Mrs. Pell
(Frances McDormand), directly address
these issues.
This search leads Ward and Anderson
to witness such powerful scenes as the
hanging of Vertis Williams at the hands
of Klan members in front of his burning
farm. Through such scenes, Parker sets
the feel of racial tension as it existed
in the early 19605. His talent as a di
rector shines through as he presents
these emotionally moving scenes with
out being graphically sensationalistic.
As Ward and Anderson search for the
truth, they meet resistance from every
corner. In typical Hollywood fasion,
though, it is not until Mrs. Pell (who
Anderson has his eye on) is beaten by
her deputy husband that Ward and An
derson decide to play hardball with the
Klan.
While playing hardball, the most ob
jectionable scene occurs. Anderson
brings in a fellow black agent to ter
rorize the racist mayor into providing

information. Unfortunately, this scene
adds little to the plot but perpetuates
stereotypes about blacks. And it further
fictionalized the truth behind the actual
events.
In this sense, the original motivation
for the movie (the murder of three
young civil rights activists) becomes sec
ondary to the debate between Ward and
Anderson on what tactics to use in find
ing the three bodies. The only time the
three students are involved in the movie
are in the opening scene when they are
murdered and in closing shot of a des
ecrated tombstone inscribed with the
words "Not Forgotten."
Parker says, "Hopefully, one day
someone will also make a film about
the importance of these young men's
lives." One can only wonder why Parker
(with all of his talent and the talent of
Dafoe and Hackman) didn't take it upon
himself to make that movie instead.

"Mississippi Burning" is playing at the
Varsity Theater in Palo Alto.
