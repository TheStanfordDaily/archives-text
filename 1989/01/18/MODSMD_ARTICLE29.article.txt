## Deadly French kissing 
### Mia Manzulli Staff writer 
In a film that will inevitably be
touted as an 18th century "Fatal
Attraction," Glenn Close once
again displays her seductive na
ture as the beautiful and
manipulative Marquise de Mer
teuil in "Dangerous Liaisons," a
wonderful tale of war between the
sexes.
Unlike the character of Alex in
"Fatal Attraction," however, the
Marquise remains in complete
control as she joins forces with
the roguish Vicomte de Valmont
(John Malkovich) in an entangle
ment of sexual gamesmanship
that is as engrossing and delight
ful as it is frightening and dis
concerting.
When Merteuil is jilted by her
lover, who marries a naive virgin,
she asks Valmont to assist her in
revenge. What better way to
retaliate against this unfaithful
lover than to deflower his in
tended bride?
Unfortunately for Merteuil,
Valmont considers this plot too
simple. Instead, he is interested
in pursuing his own more chal
lenging seduction: the virtuous,
married Madame de Tourvel (Mi
chelle Pfeiffer), who wants noth
ing to do with him. Merteuil, al
though disappointed, is fascinated
by Valmont's quest and promises
him a night of "fun" should he
succeed.

As Valmont and Merteuil plan
their respective seductions and
display their artful sensuality,
"Dangerous Liaisons" winds and
twists and turns along a path of
lust, manipulation, and control.
The pre-French Revolutionary
18th century setting does not
diminish the film's relevance to
the present in its depiction of the
sexual and dramatic games that
lovers play. The beautiful scenery
and lavish French chateaux pro
vide an appropriate backdrop for
this decadent and indulgent soci
ety that glories in its excesses.
Decidedly comic overtones cloak
the vengeful streak running
through the film. Witty dialogue
and meaningful looks keep things
on the light side although the tone
becomes less playful as the story
draws to a close. The three leads
are marvelous in their roles, with
Malkovich particularly appealing
as the consummate libertine.
Close and Malkovich carry on
a clever repartee throughout the
film as they try to entrap their
victims and keep from falling in
love with any of them. And Mi
chelle Pfeiffer is perfect as the
placid and lovely "wife" unwit
tingly drawn into contact with the
determined Valmont, who
succeeds in making many a
woman lose her composure.
Malkovich plays off beautifully
against both Close and Pfeiffer,
and the three ably balance the
shifts from comedy to drama.
