# Report on incidents at Ujamaa released
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
The University yesterday released a
detailed public report revealing new cir
cumstances concerning the events leading
up to and following a racial incident at
Ujamaa House last October.
The complete text of the report is pub
lished in a four-page ad beginning on
Page 7.
Commissioned by University Provost
James Rosse, the report confirms the basic
sequence of events described when the in
cident was first reported, but it includes
new information that initially was not
made public.
The report will be used by Judicial Af
fairs Officer Sally Cole when she reviews
the case to determine if there was a viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard. Cole
was unavailable for comment and the date
to initiate judicial proceedings is still un
known.
University Staff Counsel Jasper Williams
and Thomas Mc√üride, associate dean of
the Law School, conducted the fact-finding
investigation.
The events centered on the disfiguring
of a poster in Ujamaa, the black theme
house, by Lagunita Court residents Ben
Dugan and Gus Heldt. The two white fresh
men admitted to the act at an emotionally
charged house meeting Oct. 16 that ended
in what Ujamaa Resident Fellow Michael
Britt called "mass chaos."
The report also includes Dugan's and
Heldt's motivations for their actions. (See
related story.)
Dugan and Heldt were removed from
their Lagunita housing assignment follow
ing the meeting. Since then, they have been
living in a guest room at Florence Moore
Hall, and last week they were suspended
from University housing until the end of
this quarter.
In the report, Dugan is referred to as
"Alex" and Heldt is called "Fred."
Some of the new issues addressed in the
report were not brought out in earlier news
reports of the incident because those in
volved were unwilling to speak with The
Daily on the record.
Two days after the poster defacing,
before Dugan and Heldt confessed to the
act, an unknown person wrote the words
"You shall pay for your actions!" on a
message board in all capitals outside
Dugan's door.
About a week later, a similar unsigned
note reading, "Tonite is the nite" was left
on Dugan's message board also in all capi
tals.

Two days following the meeting at which
Dugan and Heldt confessed, three type
written fliers with the words written in all
capitals, "Non-blacks leave our home/you
do not belong in Ujamaa" were found in
Ujamaa. The phone numbers of the Office
of Residential Education and the Under
graduate Housing Center were also listed
at the bottom of each flier.
The same day, "an unknown person
punched holes in the pictures of all but
three or four of the non-black freshmen"
on Ujamaa's picture board, according to
the report. The person also put a hole in
the picture of a black resident. The pictures
were removed by an Ujamaa resident as
sistant.

Two days after the poster
defacing, before Dugan and
Heldt confessed to the act,
an unknown person wrote
the words 'You shall pay for
your actions!' on a message
board in all capitals outside
Dugan's door.

Among the events that already had been
reported, Kerr and a friend found a poster
with the word "Niggers" scrawled across
it in the house Oct. 14. Also, several anti
white bumper stickers which read "Avenge
Ujaama/Smash the Honkie Oppressors!"
were found around campus beginning Nov.
4.
The report said that the parties respon
sible for these acts are unknown.
The report describes in detail the meet
ing at which Dugan and Heldt confessed
to defacing the Beethoven poster. One
Ujamaa RA identified two turning points
in the meeting.
Heldt began by saying he and Dugan
wanted to explain themselves and hear the
reactions of the residents. "I don't know
if what you want is an apology," Heldt
said. "We know an apology won't be enough
so we won't even say it."
Later in the meeting, an Ujamaa resident
demanded an apology from the two. Ac
cording to the report, Heldt looked toward
Dugan "with the implied suggestion that
they answer in unison." Heldt said, "OK.
