# Murder of a mouth

"Talk Radio" is the thinking
man's answer to Morton
Downey Jr. and Geraldo
Rivera. Based on a one-man
performance piece by Eric
Bogosian, which itself was
based on the life of murdered
radio talk-show host Alan Berg,
"Talk Radio" is one of the most
intriguing and disturbing char
acter studies to come out of
Hollywood in several years.
Bogosian plays Barry Cham
plain, an aggressive Dallas
radio talk-show host who in
timidates, belittles and insults
his callers. In spite of his
predatory manner, the show at
tracts thousands of listeners
and angry callers.
Champlain's assassination at
the end of the film is not in
tended to be a surprise — the
shooting is foreshadowed in the
opening 10 minutes. But plot
is not director Oliver Stone's
("Platoon," "Wall Street") pri
mary concern. He focuses on
Bogosian's character and
smartly stays there.
Bogosian's Champlain is by
no means a hero. His ruthless
tactics are offensive and unjus

tified (he often abuses callers
who support him).
But he is not just a venomous
aggressor — he is also an in
secure, lonely man who needs
the love of his listeners. Yet he
rejects anyone who tries to get
close to him because he cannot
even get close to himself. "If
you like me," he shouts at his
ex-wife, "there must be some
thing wrong with you!"
The stirring climax of "Talk
Radio" is when Champlain ver
bally crucifies his ex-wife on
the air after she makes a last
minute attempt to reconcile.
His spewing insults turn into
a monologue of self-loathing,
and for the first and only time
the viewer sees Barry Cham
plain's real persona.
Stone keeps his camera
tightly zeroed in on his subject,
and the climactic monologue is
brilliantly executed. Rather
than break the five-minute
speech into segments, Stone po
sitions his camera in front of
Bogosian and lets him deter
iorate in one long, disturbing
shot. The effect is much more
powerful, and Bogosian
delivers a performance worth
an Oscar nomination.
