As a senior about to graduate
and face the eventuality of saying
goodbye to close friends, I was
particularly touched by the honest
and moving "Beaches." The
greatest thing about the emotions
this movie evokes is the reminder
that a true friendship can beat
the odds of geographical separa
tion, varying lifestyle choices and
personality conflicts.
Although the story centers
around two women, it is by no
means a "women's movie" — the
lessons it teaches about love and
the bonds of friendship apply to
anyone who has ever had a best
friend.
In "Beaches," CC Bloom (Bette
Midler) and Hillary Whitney (Bar
bara Hershey) struggle to main
tain a friendship started as 11-
year-olds in 1957 on a beach in
Atlantic City, N.J. CC is a
headstrong, street-smart New
Yorker determined to make it in
show business; Hillary, who hails
from Stanford's neighboring city
of Atherton, is wealthy, refined
and serious.
The two girls keep in touch with
letters and photos, developing a
strong bond despite the differ
ences in their circumstances and
personalities. The pair meet up
again as adults and their lives
mesh and diverge as they make

career and marriage choices.
Self-sacrifice and giving are cru
cial to the survival of any friend
ship, and the film points out the
very real problems we all have in
dealing with the pride and
jealousy that complicate relation
ships. Bette Midler is wonderful
as the attention-seeking star who
demands as much from everyone
else as she does from herself. And
Barbara Hershey brings strength
and grace to her role as a deter
mined lawyer-turned-dedicated
wife who wonders if she has given
up all her dreams.
Although CC and Hillary are
very different, their friendship is
entirely credible — there is an
electricity between the two women
that mtfkes their troubles believ
able as well as deserving of sym
pathy. Much of the film's strength
derives from the way it parallels
the women's development as in
dividuals — CC and Hillary are
not typical girlhood chums.
Rather, they are products of two
completely separate environments
who admire in each other the
things they themselves are lack
ing.
"Beaches" contains several
performances by Bette Midler,
who plays a cabaret entertainer
and whose performances won't let
you forget that she can sing! The
effective use of song throughout
the film adds to the already lyric
quality of the story.
