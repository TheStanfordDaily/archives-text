## Hoops: The best is yet to come 
### 
When I was a freshman, three years
ago, I lived in Rinconada in Wilbur
Hall. Across the way, in Soto, lived
a fellow freshman named Todd Lichti.
At first, I didn't know who he was. At
6-foot-4, you'd think he might stand out a
little. But, I thought, "I'm in California,
everyone is 6-4."

One day, I was doing laundry and Lichti
was there doing his. I'm hazy on the details,
but I remember him introducing himself
simply as Todd.
I still didn't know who he was.
Sometime later, after I had lunch with
Lichti and some other Wilbur residents, a
friend of mine came up to me and made
some comment about seeing me hang around
the star of the basketball team.
That led to a conversation that went some
thing like this:
I said, "You mean that Todd is . . . Todd
Lichti? The same Todd Lichti that The
Sporting News called a 'can't miss' recruit?"
Said my friend: "And Dick Vitale called
him one of the top-10 freshmen in the na
tion."
"Isn't that something?" I said. "You'd
never know he was a star athlete just from
talking to him."
"If I was the star of the basketball team,
I'd make sure everyone on campus knew
it," my friend responded.
Today, not only does everyone on campus
know who Lichti is, but so does every op
posing player in the Pacific 10 Conference.
And every coach. And anyone connected with
scouting for the National Basketball Asso
ciation.
They know Lichti is the key man for the
Stanford Cardinal, one of the best Division-I
basketball teams in the United States —
the 20th-best, according to this week's As
sociated Press poll, and, just maybe, quite
a bit better.
Which is not a bad place to be for a team
that, until last year, hadn't won 20 games
since the championship year of 1942. They
hadn't even played in the postseason since
then.
If you had asked opposing players whether
they feared coming in to Maples Pavilion
to face the Cardinal, they would probably
have shook their heads — or even chuckled.
Last season, the team made a
breakthrough. After winning 13 of their first
20 games, the team had a date with the
nation's No. 1-ranked team, the 20-1 Ari
zona Wildcats, on Feb. 4.
In The Daily that Thursday morning col
umnist Chris Fialko came up with the
heretical notion that Stanford could win the
game "if the fans work as hard as the
players."
"Cardinal fans inexplicably sit during the
game and stand at halftime," Fialko noted.
"If you situate yourself in the student section
and try to stand up during the game, you
hear people behind you yelling 'down in
front.' "
"Hopefully our crowd will be a factor,"
Lichti said.
The story was titled "Hoops fans have to
come alive."
That night they did. But more important
ly, so did the team.
Battling back from deficits of 24-15, mid
way through the first half, and 58-52, early
in the second half, the Cardinal finally
pulled even at 67. After trading hoops a
couple of times, including a jumper and

clutch 3-pointer from Scott Meinert, the
score was knotted again at 74.
The Wildcats would not score again, as
the Cardinal pulled away to score the stun
ning 82-74 upset on the strength of a com
bined 45 points from Lichti, Mr. Outside if
you will, and Stanford's Mr. Inside —
Howard Wright.
Those two led the way as a phenomenal
team effort made the dream a reality.
"The crowd came in and really made a

difference. They pushed us over the edge,"
Coach Mike Montgomery said.
"The crowd really picked us up," forward
Bryan McSweeney said.
And, with that, the Stanford Cardinal es
tablished that it could beat anyone in the
country as long as the game was in Maples.

lost center Greg Butler to the New York

Forward Howard Wright, who has a sprained left thumb, expects to play against Cal
tomorrow night.
Knickerbockers, but the team still
returned five starters.
Eric Reveno, who had started
at center, was returning from a
redshirt year to rehabilitate his
back. He would be joined by
Lichti, defensive whiz McSweeney,
All-Pac-10 forward and low-post
master Wright and 3-point artist
Terry Taylor.
Add the coolheaded Australian,
sophomore Andrew Vlahov, and
top-20 recruit Adam Keefe to a
team that finished 21-12 — and
made the NIT — and expectations
ran high.
The AP poll placed the team at
No. 20, and the first NCAA berth
in nearly half a century seemed
all but assured.
Still there was a nagging ques
tion. How far could Stanford go
if they couldn't win on the road?
Early-season action suggested
the answer was "not very far."
But there was a qualification. The
losses came at Indiana, North
Carolina and UCLA — all very
tough places to win.

The key for Stanford was to
shake those losses off and, like
the team did against Arizona last
season, take their game to a
higher plane. They have.
First, the team knocked off
then-undefeated St. Mary's in
Moraga. Then they blew out Van
derbilt in the Commodores' own
tournament.
Next, on Jan. 5, the Cardinal
overcame a seemingly insur
mountable 21-4 deficit to beat Ar
izona in the much-anticipated
rematch. Two days later the squad
pasted Arizona State.
But last weekend was the
crowning achievement of the
season so far.
The Cardinal went into Wash
ington's Hec Edmundson Pavilion
with a 10-game losing streak
there. The streak ended on a
Lichti buzzer-beater as Stanford
toppled the Huskies.
Saturday, the higher plane was
attained.
After opening up a 26-21
halftime lead, the Cardinal
stepped onto Friel Court in Wash
ington State and bent, folded,
spindled and mutilated the
Cougars in the second half.
They came back to Stanford

with a 85-43 blowout and, finally,
a return to the AP Top 20.
This Thursday and Saturday,
the Cardinal has a couple of con
tests that will go a long way
toward determining the confer
ence champion.
After heading up to Berkeley to
meet California in the unfriendly
confines of Harmon Gym, the
Cardinal returns to Maples to
meet perennial nemesis UCLA.
The team is more than capable
of winning both and taking yet
another step up the ladder to the
Promised Land.
Still, Montgomery and the
players seem unaffected by their
success. They state categorically
that the ranking means nothing
to them.
They are focused on going for
the conference title and, after
that, the NCAA Tournament.
While it is unlikely Stanford
will be among the tourney's top
seeds, as Villanova, Kansas, et al.
have shown, anything can happen.
Who knows, maybe nearly every
sports fan in the country will
know who Todd Lichti is come
April 1.

know who Lichti is, but so does every op
posing player in the Pacific 10 Conference.
And every coach. And anyone connected with
scouting for the National Basketball Asso
ciation.
They know Lichti is the key man for the
Stanford Cardinal, one of the best Division-I
basketball teams in the United States —
the 20th-best, according to this week's As
sociated Press poll, and, just maybe, quite
a bit better.
Which is not a bad place to be for a team
that, until last year, hadn't won 20 games
since the championship year of 1942. They
hadn't even played in the postseason since
then.
If you had asked opposing players whether
they feared coming in to Maples Pavilion
to face the Cardinal, they would probably
have shook their heads — or even chuckled.
Last season, the team made a
breakthrough. After winning 13 of their first
20 games, the team had a date with the
nation's No. 1-ranked team, the 20-1 Ari
zona Wildcats, on Feb. 4.
In The Daily that Thursday morning col
umnist Chris Fialko came up with the
heretical notion that Stanford could win the
game "if the fans work as hard as the
players."
"Cardinal fans inexplicably sit during the
game and stand at halftime," Fialko noted.
"If you situate yourself in the student section
and try to stand up during the game, you
hear people behind you yelling 'down in
front.' "
"Hopefully our crowd will be a factor,"
Lichti said.
The story was titled "Hoops fans have to
come alive."
That night they did. But more important
ly, so did the team.
Battling back from deficits of 24-15, mid
way through the first half, and 58-52, early
in the second half, the Cardinal finally
pulled even at 67. After trading hoops a
couple of times, including a jumper and

clutch 3-pointer from Scott Meinert, the
score was knotted again at 74.
The Wildcats would not score again, as
the Cardinal pulled away to score the stun
ning 82-74 upset on the strength of a com
bined 45 points from Lichti, Mr. Outside if
you will, and Stanford's Mr. Inside —
Howard Wright.
Those two led the way as a phenomenal
team effort made the dream a reality.
"The crowd came in and really made a

difference. They pushed us over the edge,"
Coach Mike Montgomery said.
"The crowd really picked us up," forward
Bryan McSweeney said.
And, with that, the Stanford Cardinal es
tablished that it could beat anyone in the
country as long as the game was in Maples.

Forward Howard Wright, who has a sprained left thumb, expects to play against Cal
tomorrow night.
Knickerbockers, but the team still
returned five starters.
Eric Reveno, who had started
at center, was returning from a
redshirt year to rehabilitate his
back. He would be joined by
Lichti, defensive whiz McSweeney,
All-Pac-10 forward and low-post
master Wright and 3-point artist
Terry Taylor.
Add the coolheaded Australian,
sophomore Andrew Vlahov, and
top-20 recruit Adam Keefe to a
team that finished 21-12 — and
made the NIT — and expectations
ran high.
The AP poll placed the team at
No. 20, and the first NCAA berth
in nearly half a century seemed
all but assured.
Still there was a nagging ques
tion. How far could Stanford go
if they couldn't win on the road?
Early-season action suggested
the answer was "not very far."
But there was a qualification. The
losses came at Indiana, North
Carolina and UCLA — all very
tough places to win.

The key for Stanford was to
shake those losses off and, like
the team did against Arizona last
season, take their game to a
higher plane. They have.
First, the team knocked off
then-undefeated St. Mary's in
Moraga. Then they blew out Van
derbilt in the Commodores' own
tournament.
Next, on Jan. 5, the Cardinal
overcame a seemingly insur
mountable 21-4 deficit to beat Ar
izona in the much-anticipated
rematch. Two days later the squad
pasted Arizona State.
But last weekend was the
crowning achievement of the
season so far.
The Cardinal went into Wash
ington's Hec Edmundson Pavilion
with a 10-game losing streak
there. The streak ended on a
Lichti buzzer-beater as Stanford
toppled the Huskies.
Saturday, the higher plane was
attained.
After opening up a 26-21
halftime lead, the Cardinal
stepped onto Friel Court in Wash
ington State and bent, folded,
spindled and mutilated the
Cougars in the second half.
They came back to Stanford

with a 85-43 blowout and, finally,
a return to the AP Top 20.
This Thursday and Saturday,
the Cardinal has a couple of con
tests that will go a long way
toward determining the confer
ence champion.
After heading up to Berkeley to
meet California in the unfriendly
confines of Harmon Gym, the
Cardinal returns to Maples to
meet perennial nemesis UCLA.
The team is more than capable
of winning both and taking yet
another step up the ladder to the
Promised Land.
Still, Montgomery and the
players seem unaffected by their
success. They state categorically
that the ranking means nothing
to them.
They are focused on going for
the conference title and, after
that, the NCAA Tournament.
While it is unlikely Stanford
will be among the tourney's top
seeds, as Villanova, Kansas, et al.
have shown, anything can happen.
Who knows, maybe nearly every
sports fan in the country will
know who Todd Lichti is come
April 1.
Wouldn't that be something?
When I was a freshman, three years
ago, I lived in Rinconada in Wilbur
Hall. Across the way, in Soto, lived
a fellow freshman named Todd Lichti.
At first, I didn't know who he was. At
6-foot-4, you'd think he might stand out a
little. But, I thought, "I'm in California,
everyone is 6-4."

One day, I was doing laundry and Lichti
was there doing his. I'm hazy on the details,
but I remember him introducing himself
simply as Todd.
I still didn't know who he was.
Sometime later, after I had lunch with
Lichti and some other Wilbur residents, a
friend of mine came up to me and made
some comment about seeing me hang around
the star of the basketball team.
That led to a conversation that went some
thing like this:
I said, "You mean that Todd is . . . Todd
Lichti? The same Todd Lichti that The
Sporting News called a 'can't miss' recruit?"
Said my friend: "And Dick Vitale called
him one of the top-10 freshmen in the na
tion."
"Isn't that something?" I said. "You'd
never know he was a star athlete just from
talking to him."
"If I was the star of the basketball team,
I'd make sure everyone on campus knew
it," my friend responded.
