## Hoops: The best is yet to come 
### 
When I was a freshman, three years
ago, I lived in Rinconada in Wilbur
Hall. Across the way, in Soto, lived
a fellow freshman named Todd Lichti.
At first, I didn't know who he was. At
6-foot-4, you'd think he might stand out a
little. But, I thought, "I'm in California,
everyone is 6-4."

One day, I was doing laundry and Lichti
was there doing his. I'm hazy on the details,
but I remember him introducing himself
simply as Todd.
I still didn't know who he was.
Sometime later, after I had lunch with
Lichti and some other Wilbur residents, a
friend of mine came up to me and made
some comment about seeing me hang around
the star of the basketball team.
That led to a conversation that went some
thing like this:
I said, "You mean that Todd is . . . Todd
Lichti? The same Todd Lichti that The
Sporting News called a 'can't miss' recruit?"
Said my friend: "And Dick Vitale called
him one of the top-10 freshmen in the na
tion."
"Isn't that something?" I said. "You'd
never know he was a star athlete just from
talking to him."
"If I was the star of the basketball team,
I'd make sure everyone on campus knew
it," my friend responded.
Today, not only does everyone on campus
know who Lichti is, but so does every op
posing player in the Pacific 10 Conference.
And every coach. And anyone connected with
scouting for the National Basketball Asso
ciation.
They know Lichti is the key man for the
Stanford Cardinal, one of the best Division-I
basketball teams in the United States —
the 20th-best, according to this week's As
sociated Press poll, and, just maybe, quite
a bit better.
Which is not a bad place to be for a team
that, until last year, hadn't won 20 games
since the championship year of 1942. They
hadn't even played in the postseason since
then.
If you had asked opposing players whether
they feared coming in to Maples Pavilion
to face the Cardinal, they would probably
have shook their heads — or even chuckled.
Last season, the team made a
breakthrough. After winning 13 of their first
20 games, the team had a date with the
nation's No. 1-ranked team, the 20-1 Ari
zona Wildcats, on Feb. 4.
In The Daily that Thursday morning col
umnist Chris Fialko came up with the
heretical notion that Stanford could win the
game "if the fans work as hard as the
players."
"Cardinal fans inexplicably sit during the
game and stand at halftime," Fialko noted.
"If you situate yourself in the student section
and try to stand up during the game, you
hear people behind you yelling 'down in
front.' "
"Hopefully our crowd will be a factor,"
Lichti said.
The story was titled "Hoops fans have to
come alive."
That night they did. But more important
ly, so did the team.
Battling back from deficits of 24-15, mid
way through the first half, and 58-52, early
in the second half, the Cardinal finally
pulled even at 67. After trading hoops a
couple of times, including a jumper and

clutch 3-pointer from Scott Meinert, the
score was knotted again at 74.
The Wildcats would not score again, as
the Cardinal pulled away to score the stun
ning 82-74 upset on the strength of a com
bined 45 points from Lichti, Mr. Outside if
you will, and Stanford's Mr. Inside —
Howard Wright.
Those two led the way as a phenomenal
team effort made the dream a reality.
"The crowd came in and really made a

difference. They pushed us over the edge,"
Coach Mike Montgomery said.
"The crowd really picked us up," forward
Bryan McSweeney said.
And, with that, the Stanford Cardinal es
tablished that it could beat anyone in the
country as long as the game was in Maples.
Turn the clock forward to 1988. Stanford
