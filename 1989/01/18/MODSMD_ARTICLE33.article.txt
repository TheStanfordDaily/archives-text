# Swimmers shape up at Cal Invitational
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
With the first competition of
1989 out of the way, the Stanford
men's swimming team is ready to
take on last season's nemesis:
Michigan.
The strokers competed at the
three day, NCAA-style California
Invitational Saturday through
Monday in Berkeley to begin the
trek to what they hope will be a
fifth national championship. And
although scores were not tallied
at the open meet, a number of
swimmers' performances showed
that the Cardinal is definitely
going to be a team to reckon with
when April comes around.
While neither coaches nor
swimmers place too much empha
sis on the annual contest because
it is the first competition after
the squad's intense Christmas
training and the swimmers have
yet to rest, the team was excited
about the races swum by individ
ual competitors, especially by the
newest team members.
Freshman distance freestyler
Jason Plummer won the 500-yard
freesyle, and junior Lunn Lestina
followed right behind his team
mate. The Australian also won
the 1650 free, while fellow fresh
man Alex Kostich took second.
Jeff Rouse, yet another new ar
rival, not only won the 200 back
stroke, but posted an NCAA qual
ifying time of one minute, 49.9
seconds in the process. And the
clocking is all the more significant
because it is Rouse's second sub
championship standard in the
early phase of this season — he
had already qualified for nationals
at the Husker Invitational in No
vember.
"Rouse's swim really surprised
us. His 200 back was a really good
time," co-captain Jay Mortenson
said.
Kostich also took second in the
400 individual medley, while J.B.

Barr placed third in the 100 free.
Stanford swimmers Matt
Rodgers, Jeff Deßuiter, and Ken
Brakebill also took fourth through
sixth places in the 100 breast.
"As far as people achieving their
goals in the events they will be
swimming at the NCAA level it
was disappointing," Asst. Coach
Ted Knapp said, "But it was not
an unusual meet for this early in
the season."
"We were all tired still so the
times were about what we ex
pected," Rodgers said.
In addition to the early timing,
the meet had another aspect that
was not highly conducive to
racing. Both men's and women's
races were held, so each day the
meet lasted at least 10 hours. Each
swimmer raced a total of about
five minutes a day. "It's a hard
meet to be a close team at because
there were 10 to 15 heats of
women between men's races so it
was a half hour before any Stan
ford swimmer would get up on
the blocks," Mortenson said.
According to Knapp, the meet
was useful in that it showed in
dividuals and the team as a whole
what it needs to work on heading
into the dual meet season, specif
ically for this Friday's meet
against fifth-ranked Michigan. Al
though Knapp states that some
weaknesses will disappear once
the swimmers start resting before
competitions, the Cardinal discov
ered it also needs to work on a
number of fundamentals. The
squad will lighten up its work load
in the next few days to be sure
it is prepared for this season's
clash with the Wolverines, who
upset Stanford last year 55-48 in
Michigan.
"We hadn't raced since Novem
ber, so it was good to get back
up on the blocks and into the
habit of racing," Rodgers said.
"The invitational helped us get
sharp before Michigan and showed
us what we need to do for the
big meet."
