WEST HARTFORD, Conn.
(AP) — Former tennis star Arthur
Ashe, disagreeing sharply with
Georgetown basketball Coach
John Thompson, says athletes
who can't meet new NCAA aca
demic requirements don't belong
in college.
Proposition 42, approved last
week during the NCAA conven
tion, prohibits athletic scholar
ships for incoming freshmen who
don't have both a 2.0 grade-point
average in high school and a min
imum score of 700 on the Scholas
tic Aptitude Test or a similar score
on another test. The measure
takes effect in 1990.
"If you want to play basketball
or football or run track, you've
got to hit the books," Ashe told
students at the Kingswood-Oxford
School, where he was leading a
seminar Monday honoring Martin
Luther King Jr.
Thompson contends that the
SAT contains a cultural bias
against underpriveleged students.
In protest of the rule, he walked
off the court before his team's
game last Saturday against Bos

ton College.
Thompson has said he will not
coach again "until I am satisfied
that something has been done to
provide these student-athletes
with appropriate opportunity and
hope for access to college."
Ashe disagrees with that stance.
"Seven hundred on the SAT ex
ams — that's like a D average,"
Ashe said. "Seven hundred is so
low that cultural bias — and I'm
not an expert — probably won't
even play a part in it."
The SAT consists of a verbal
section and a mathematics por
tion, each scored from 200 to 800.
The minimum score is 400, the
maximum 1,600.
"If you can't score 700, I think
you should be in a community
college or a junior college, any
way," Ashe said.
Ashe, who writes a sports
column for The Washington Post,
said he would use the column
later this week to speak out in
support of the rule.
He said colleges do a disservice
when they accept athletes who
can't meet academic demands.
