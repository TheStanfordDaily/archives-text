### 
Stanford forward Howard
Wright has a sprained left
thumb, according to team
doctor Gordon Campbell.
The injury, which was in
curred during the second
half of Monday's 93-59 win
over Miami, has caused
Wright to be listed as "ques
tionable" for tomorrow's
game at California. Wright,
however, feels that there is
no question as to whether
he will play.
"It (the thunb) doesn't hurt,
it feels pretty good," Wright
said last night. "I've been
wearing a brace that Dake
Walden (Stanford's trainer)
designed. I'll have a better
reading (today). . . I'm going
to play. If I can walk, I'll
play."
Wright underwent an X
ray examination by Walden
Tuesday morning before
being examined by Camp
bell. Wright did not practice
with the team on Tuesday,
but intends to practice today.
The forward led the Cardi
nal with 21 points in the
win over Miami Monday
night.
