# Rugby defeated by Santa Clara

Don't be deceived.
Stanford's men's rugby team
played on the road last Saturday
and came home without a victory
to show for it, losing 22-4 to Santa
Clara. But the score did not reflect
the Cardinal players' efforts.
Stanford's first (or "A") team
was playing its first Northern Cal
ifornia Union Collegiate League
match of the season, and unfor
tunately, its inexperience showed.
As fourth-year rugby player Will
Wall confessed, "It was disap
pointing."
The Cardinal was only down
10-4 at the end of the first half.
"We started out pretty strong,"
Wall reported. During the second
half, however, the players began
to suffer a "lapse of concentra
tion," according to Stanford
Coach Kahu Pere. Santa Clara
had had an extra week of practice
and had already played a league
game, and that "made a differ
ence," Wall said.
"We have a lot of young guys
playing," Wall said. "The main
thing is learning how to play with
each other. We have some really
good guys . . . There's definite
promise" for the rest of the
season.
