# Lachenauer puts lock on editor
## 
### Ed Inchief Editorial staff 
The Reign of Red is finally
over, only to be replaced with
the Kaste of Kathy, continuing
the two-volume totalitarian
domination of female editors in
chief at The Stanford Daily
Dreckster.
Men were not heard complain
ing, though, since all Daily male
staffers are sexist pigs and are
only out for one thing anyway.
Kathy Laugh-an-hour rarely
admits it, but she was a Tri
Delt. Although she deactivated
earlier this year, her ties to
sorority life resurfaced immedi
ately after her victory, as she
giggled hysterically for 15
minutes and then declared to
boldly go where no woman has
gone before, "to buy some beer."
Many factors worked against
the candidate, especially the en
suing scandal caused when she
admitted during a Daily "I
Never" game that she wore
edible underwear to get the at
tention of her dentist.
Other negatives: Her middle
name is Ruth, she drives an ugly
blue Chevette that never runs
(what do you expect â€” it's a
Chevette), eats rice cakes,
speaks with an excited, whiny
voice in edit board, and comes
from Lake Forest, 111., the home
of losers like Chicago Bears
quarterback Jim McMahon.

The negatives were overcome
by sordid campaign tactics such
as giving backrubs (and who
knows what other favors) for
votes.
Current Editor in Chief
Debbie Rubenstein commented
that The Lock's personality
would probably hinder 'ner per
formance. "She said she won't

read all the copy, but she prob
ably will."
For those keeping score at
home, and those who still read
Daily columns, she was the can
didate who wrote the platform
excerpt used in Ted Lieu's
"piece" yesterday. She also
favors Bud Light by 3.5 in Sun
day's "Bud Bowl I."
