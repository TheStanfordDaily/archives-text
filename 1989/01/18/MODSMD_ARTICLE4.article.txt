# Horton blasts animal rights groups for delaying tactics

### Jock Friedly Senior staff writer 
SAN FRANCISCO — Environmental
laws are being "manipulated frivolously"
by animal rights groups to slow down

science and is costing
Stanford millions of dol
lars, said University As
soc. Vice President Larry
Horton yesterday in a
science convention here.
At a meeting of the
American Association for
the Advancement of Sci
ence, Horton told more
than 50 scientists, ad-

ministrators and members of the press
that science research at Stanford and
other institutions has been stymied by
animal rights activists. They are using a

new tactic, said Horton, in which they
show concern for environmental issues in
research when they really oppose use of
animals in research.
In 1987, construction of an under
ground research animal facility at the
University Medical Center was opposed
by animal rights groups first because
they said the facility's scientists would
not meet federal regulations on animal
research, Horton said.
Then, as the Santa Clara County Board
of Supervisors was preparing to approve
construction of the facility, the animal
rights groups raised concerns about the
facility's effect on the environment, ac
cording to Horton.
"The matter at hand is the successful
manipulation of political and legal proc
esses by a tiny handful of implacable
opponents of certain types of research,"

Horton told the gathering of scientists
yesterday.
The county board in the summer of
1987 invoked the California Environmen
tal Quality Act, which requires that an
environmental impact report be written
in cases where serious public controversy
exists. The impact report for the $18
million facility took over one year and
cost an estimated $1.3 million from the
delay.
"Environmental laws, intended for one
purpose, have been manipulated to
achieve other purposes," Horton said, re
ferring to the use of environmental laws
to call for the impact report.
At the time of the public hearing proc
ess to review the building two years ago,
Patricia Elsen, now president of the Palo
Alto Humane Society, spoke out against
the research animal facility on grounds

of animal cruelty and environmental dan
gers.
Elsen said she and others held
legitimate concerns for environmental
problems at Stanford, in addition to con
cern about animal research. She said that
Horton's interpretation, that there was
a "manipulation of legal and political
processes," was completely inaccurate.
"What we want from the University is
public accountability in animal use, toxics
use and genetic engineering," Elsen said
yesterday from her Humane Society of
fice.
After the University prepared a re
quired environmental impact report for
the facility, the Board of Supervisors ap
proved the facility, concluding that the
facility represented no risk to the com
munity.
"The heavy irony was that, from a

strict animal welfare point of view," Hor
ton said, "animals would be much better
off in the new centralized facility than
in the scattered, aging, decentralized fa
cilities."
Later in 1987, opposition to a $33 mil
lion biological sciences building has in
creased the debate between animal rights
and environmental groups on one side,
and scientists and administrators on the
other.
"The delays have been unreasonable
and costly," Biological Sciences Prof. Bob
Simoni said yesterday in a phone inter
view. Simoni said he and others have
been delayed in their research, and that
they still must deal with inadequate fa
cilities.
"The overcrowding has made everyone
curtail their research," Simoni said.
