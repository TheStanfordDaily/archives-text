Recounting his personal experi
ences treating people who had
been held and abused in South
African jails, anti-apartheid activ
ist Dr. Paul Davis told a group of
about 60 at the Stanford Medical
School yesterday that doctors need
to pressure the South African gov
ernment to eliminate its brutal
practices of torture and interroga
tion.
In South Africa, a person may
be arrested for interrogation and
held without any charges being
filed. These people are considered
"detainees," not prisoners, be
cause they have not been con
victed of any crimes. According to
Davis, most detainees are abused
physically and mentally and then
are released — sometimes years
later — without ever being
charged.
"The critical force of detention
is the totally closed circle of power
within which the detainee lives.
Volition, the essence of life, is
removed," said Davis, a South
African physician.
Davis, who is facing legal

proceedings in South Africa for
refusing to disclose the medical
records of former detainees, dis
covered symptoms of post
traumatic stress disorder in
patients who said they had been
physically brutalized soon after
detention.
Davis is a member of the Na
tional Medical and Dental Associ
ation, which he said "mobilizes
the medical and dental professions
in South Africa to play a mean
ingful role in changing South
Africa into a free and non-racial
society."
The group has developed a
protocol for the examination of
all new detainees in order to force
doctors to "focus on all types of
disorders - both physical and
psychological."
"We had to try to stop what
was going on in detention itself,"
Davis said.
In addition, Davis said the as
sociation is working to improve
community medical services in
South Africa and is cooperating
with several other groups to or
ganize mental health and social
services.
