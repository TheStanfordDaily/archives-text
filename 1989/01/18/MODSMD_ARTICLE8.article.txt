# Bush economic policies still unclear
## 
### Jay Bhattacharya Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the first of
a three part series previewing the
challenges President-elect Bush
faces when he begins his term this
Friday.

As inauguration day draws
nearer, Bush comes closer to
facing the challenge of reducing
the massive federal deficit that
has plagued President Reagan
throughout his second term.

News Analysis

Combined with his promise of
no new taxes, the deficit will
define Bush's economic policy
during his presidency.
Bush's pledge to increase
Medicare benefits, to improve the
education system and to continue
high levels of defense spending,
along with other campaign prom
ises, will be significantly tempered
by budgetary restrictions.
While he has yet to spell out
his economic plans for the next
four years, the President-elect has
promised to give a full accounting

of his agenda Feb. 9 to Congress.
The bank crisis involving newly
endangered savings and loan cor
porations will consume much of
Bush's time during the early
months of his term. Corruption,
coupled with imprudent loans, has
brought many savings and loan
companies to the brink of finan
cial ruin.
While the Bush administration

insists that reforming the indus
try is the key to solving the crisis,
the Department of Treasury es
timates that it will eventually cost
$115 billion to bail out bankrupt
savings and loan corporations.
In addition, the American
debt crisis promises to grow dur

transition team, however, has
been relatively silent on this cru
cial issue.
The crisis began early in the
Reagan administration when
many large American banks made
ill-considered loans to Latin
American countries.
If the countries default, the fi
nancial solvency of several Amer
ican banks would be seriously
threatened, yielding dire conse
quences for the U.S. economy.
Bush's main weapon against
the budget deficit will be the
"flexible-freeze." This approach,
which was one of Bush's central
campaign promises on the eco
nomic front, ties growth of the
budget to the inflation rate.
Unlike the Gramm-Rudman
Deficit Reduction Act, which calls
for an across-the-board cut in

spending, the flexible-freeze al
lows certain programs to be ex
empt from the cut. Bush and the
Congress will determine the ex
emptions, but they must recom
mend cuts in other programs to
compensate for continued or in
creased levels of spending in ex
empt programs.
Bush will also feel pressured to
keep his promise of cutting the
capital gains tax. The tax cut
would follow Reagan's attempts
to spur economic growth through
"supply-side economics," which
involves giving the private sector
fiscal incentives to grow.
While the tax cut may help con
tinue the pattern of economic ex
pansion which has characterized
the last six years, it will further
crimp the budget in the short run.
In the coming four years, the
budgetary constraints will effec
tively prevent Bush from carrying
out sweeping changes analagous
to the "Reagan revolution" of
eight years ago.
