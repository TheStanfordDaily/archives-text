# ASSU to expand dorm outreach program
## 
### Mike Habata 
In an effort for to better rep
resent students and meet their
needs, the ASSU will expand its
dorm representative program in
the next few weeks to reach out
to more students.
The program, which began last
quarter in the freshman and four
class houses, will now include
several upperclass residences. In
addition, dorm representatives
will survey students, and mem
bers of the Council of Presidents
will join residents at meals to in
crease contact with the student
body.
Begun last October by the
ASSU, the dorm representative
program serves a two-fold func
tion: to obtain direct feedback
from the students about their con
cerns and to inform students in
the residences about ASSU activ

ities and programs, according to
COP member Stacey Leyton.
"The dorm representatives allow
us to be directly in touch with
students' feelings," Leyton said.
"We want students to feel that
the ASSU is accessible. That is
the ideal we're trying to reach,"
she said.
Previous to this academic year,
the only ways of getting feedback
from the students was through
such methods as the ASSU Straw
Polls, which can only register
simple "yes" and "no" responses,
Leyton said.
This quarter, dorm representa
tives will begin distributing
biweekly surveys to students in
their residences. These will allow
students to voice their opinions
on various topics.
Tentatively, the first survey will
concern projects of the COP, the
second will concern the ASSU

Speakers Bureau and the third
covers student interests and ASSU
services.
In addition, members of the
COP plan to begin eating meals
in different residence dining halls
to talk first-hand to students and
discuss issues.
Currently, more than 100 stu
dents represent residents from La
gunita Court, Branner, Toyon,
Florence Moore, Stern and Wilbur
halls. The representatives, who
are mostly freshmen, work to in
crease awareness of the ASSU.
There is at least one representa
tive for each house in these resi
dences, and they meet weekly with
a member of the COP to discuss
student concerns.
According to several dorm rep
resentatives, the program has
been successfully informing resi
dents about the services provided
by the ASSU, though the program

has been slow in finding a recep
tive audience. Katy Frost, a fresh
man representative in Eucalypto
House, found the program "really
well-organized," adding that "all
the freshmen are really im
pressed" by the ASSU.
Lance Holman, a junior repre
sentative in Twain House, de
scribed an increasing awareness
of the ASSU in his residence and
predicted more involvement as
"freshmen get more acclimated."
Felicia Chang, one of the rep
resentatives in Branner, said the
program was slowly getting into
place in her hall. "We're just get
ting started," she said.
Starting this week, the ASSU
will begin recruiting for dorm rep
resentatives from upperclass
houses in the Cowell Cluster,
Sterling Quad and on the Row.
"Our goal is to be accessible to
students," Leyton said.
