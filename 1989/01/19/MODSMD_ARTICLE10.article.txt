# Marcos dying, lawyers say
## Deposed Philippines leader may be unable to stand trial 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - Deposed Philip
pines President Ferdinand Marcos is un
able to stand trial in New York on rack
eteering charges because he is dying,
defense lawyers told a federal judge yes
terday.
Marcos, 71, has been hospitalized ip
Honolulu since Sunday, suffering from
pneumonia and bronchial asthma.
U.S. District Judge John Keenan
agreed to expand the scope of a hearing
today that originally was to determine
if Marcos is fit enough to travel from
Honolulu to New York for his arraign
ment.
The government has informally
agreed to an arraignment in Honolulu,
but the question will now be whether
he can be arraigned or tried at all.
"You're saying he can never be ar
raigned anywhere because he's not com
petent medically to stand trial?" Keenan
asked Marcos attorney Richard Hibey.
"That's correct," Hibey replied.
In a letter made public yesterday,
Hibey had told the judge: "We have

been advised by the last doctor who
examined President Marcos that he is
dying."
"What began as merely a request to
hold Mr. Marcos' arraignment in
Honolulu rather than New York has
evolved into a genuine concern for his
life," Hibey wrote in the letter, dated
Tuesday, that included an abbreviated
doctor's report.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles
Laßella told Keenan that "for the first
time" prosecutors believed Marcos was
too ill to travel but said of the pneu
monia: "It's a reversible condition, non
chronic." Laßella argued that it was
premature to determine if Marcos was
unable to stand trial.
The prosecutor conceded that it would
be four to six weeks before Marcos could
travel and asked that "Mr. Marcos be
arraigned as promptly as possible in
Hawaii."
No trial date has been set.
Marcos and his wife, Imelda, 59, have
been living in Honolulu since fleeing

Manila in 1986.
From the time of his indictment in
October, Marcos had asked that the ar
raignment be moved to Hawaii, citing
various health problems including kid
ney and heart ailments. However, a gov
ernment doctor examined Marcos there
and pronounced him capable of travel
ing to New York for arraignment.
Mrs. Marcos came to New York in
October for arraignment and was re
leased on $5 million bond after pleading
innocent.
The Marcoses are accused of plunder
ing $103 million from the Philippines
treasury, funneling it to foreign bank
accounts and using it to buy prime New
York real estate and art works.
The main racketeering charge against
the couple carries a maximum 20-year
prison sentence upon conviction.
Eight Marcos associates, including
Saudi businessman and arms dealer Ad
nan Khashoggi, also were indicted on
various charges.
