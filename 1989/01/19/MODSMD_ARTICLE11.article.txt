# Supreme Court upholds sentencing system for federal crimes
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — A new sen
tencing system that took effect in No
vember 1987 for people convicted of
federal crimes is constitutional, the Su
preme Court ruled yesterday in a decsion
that will affect thousands.
By an 8-1 vote, the justices upheld the
U.S. Sentencing Commission's rules. The
decision also upheld the validity of the
commission itself.
Scores of federal trial judges have
refused to use the new sentencing rules,
calling them and the commission uncon
stitutional. Now, defendants sentenced by
those judges must be resentenced.
The decision carries no impact, how

ever, for any defendant sentenced in a
state court.
About 10,000 federal court defendants
have been subjected to the new sentencing
system.
The commission was created by
Congress in the Sentencing Reform Act
of 1984, legislation aimed at eliminating
what some called unjustified disparities
in sentences.
The law empowers the commission,
with seven members appointed to six-year
terms by the president, to tell federal
judges what sentences should be imposed
for various crimes. Three of the commis
sion's members must be federal judges.

The guidelines generally stiffened the
prison time federal convicts are required
to serve. The commission eliminated
parole and curtailed credit for good be
havior.
Judges who had struck down the new
sentencing system had ruled:
• That Congress unlawfully avoided po
litical accountability by unconstitution
ally delegating its legislative power to the
commission.
• That the commission, because it in
cludes members of the judiciary and holds
legislative power, violates the Constitu
tion's separation of powers principle.
• That the new rules violate defen

dents' due-process rights by curbing too
severely judges' sentencing discretion.
Writing for the court today, Justice
Harry Blackmun said those judges were
wrong.
"Congess neither delegated excessive
legislative power nor upset the constitu
tionally mandated balance of powers
among the coordinate branches," Black
mun said.
"The Constitution's structural protec
tions do not prohibit Congress from
delegating to an expert body located
within the judicial branch the intricate
task of formulating sentencing guidelines
consistent with such significant statutory

direction as is present here," he said.
In justifying judges' membership on
the commission, Blackmun said Congress
is free to call on the judicial branch's
help in "a matter uniquely within the
ken of judges."
Only Justice Antonin Scalia dissented,
on grounds that the commission was
given power not authorized by the Con
stitution.
Sentencing Commission Chairman
William Wilkins, a judge on the 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond,
Va., called today's ruling "one of the
most important decisions handed down
by the court this decade."
