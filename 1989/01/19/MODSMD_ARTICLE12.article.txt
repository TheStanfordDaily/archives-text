# Miami to investigate shootings
## 
### 
MIAMI (AP) â€” Sporadic gun
fire and rock throwing broke out
again in two black neighborhoods
yesterday and spread to a third,
but as night fell police said the
city's riot-torn areas seemed cal
mer than on the two previous
nights.
City commissioners, meeting in
emergency session, appointed a
panel to investigate the police
shooting of a black motorcyclist
that sparked two days of racial
violence. And a sister of the
motorcyclist's passenger, who died
when the vehicle crashed, made
a televised plea for an end to the
violence.
"It's the quietest night so far,"
said Deputy Police Chief Walter
Martinez at 8 p.m. "We've got 250
men out," including field forces,
small groups of officers equipped
with riot gear that move in
quickly to quell specific disturb
ances.
City commissioners unani
mously approved the special panel
amid warnings from black leaders
that there will be more disturb
ances if authorities do not act
quickly to ease tensions.
