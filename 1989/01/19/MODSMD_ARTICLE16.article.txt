New penalty for minor
alcohol possession does
not match the crime

THE CALIFORNIA state
legislature, in an attempt to
make the penalties for un
derage drinking stiffer, seems to
have fashioned a punishment that
does not always fit the crime.
This new law, in effect since Jan.
1, states that persons under 21
years of age found in possession
of alcohol or drugs at any time will
lose their driver's license for a year
or, if they are under 16 years of
age, will be prevented from trying
to obtain their license until they
are 17.
While stiffer penalties may be
needed to prevent underage con
sumption of alcohol and drugs, the
new law is a non sequitur that
misses the mark. Instead of
prescribing a punishment that di
rectly relates to the crime at hand,
the law takes away the privilege
of driving for an offense that has
no relation to driving.
Under previous laws, minors
were assessed a fine non-vehicle
related for alcohol possession of
fenses. Traditionally, students on
this campus were assessed a fine
between $60 and $100 for the first
offense and were required to attend
a court hearing and enter a plea.
The impetus for the new law is
clear. California legislators want to
stop underage drinking, but they

feel current laws are not keeping
those under 21 from consuming
alcohol. A driver's license is con
sidered a coveted privilege by most
"young adults," so the punishment
would seem like a valid deterrent.
Unfortunately, the new law is
based on two weak assumptions.
First, the legislators assume that
underage drinking will be halted
by stiffer penalties. However, the
underlying causes of underage
drinking are societal, and tough
punishment will most likely not
stop the heavy amount of underage
drinking that occurs throughout
the nation.
Second, and more importantly,
the legislators assume that the new
law will help deter drunk driving,
as many lawmakers and officials
have commented about the law.
Sadly, though, the law destroys the
disincentive that keeps those who
have been drinking away from the
driver's wheel.
Under the new law, students
walking with a beer in hand can
have a driver's license revoked. But
when people are caught behind the
wheel of a car drunk they often
face the same punishment â€” a one
year license suspension.
The mentality behind the new
law tells the underage drinker to
get behind the wheel of a car and
drive home from a party, since the
license would be revoked either
way.
The idea of using the driver's
license as a threat may have
seemed like a good idea at the time.
But lawmakers might want to look
beneath the surface implications.
