## Many deserve praise as Ujamaa rebuilds 
### 
SEVERAL MONTHS have passed
since the infamous Ujamaa Inci
dent; and little or no attention
has been focused on those individuals
who have been instrumental in pulling
the community together again during
that tragic moment.
In brief, they were given little or no
credit for getting Ujamaa House back
on track. Well, I think a "thank you"
is appropriate before the next wave of
media hype attempts to choke our
efforts to recover.
One of the reasons for the
emotional pain experienced by several
students as a result of the incident was
due to the tremendously positive at
mosphere and environment created by
the Ujamaa staff.
They're capable of serving anywhere
in the residential system and would
probably be superstars in a typical
residential environment. In general, no
student staff could respond better and
move faster to heal a community.
Their first responsibility, however, is to
their role as students . . . with gradua
tion plans!
Our community is diverse and in
cludes one of the best advising teams
in the system. Much of the credit for
their immediate response and visible
presence in the community immediately
after the incident belongs to Kathy
Namphy, one of Ujamaa's most valu
able family members. She has not
received any press!
The quality of University citizenship
has always been important to several
members of the Stanford community.
Stanford, like most mtyor employers,

Racism is not an
'Ujamaa' problem. It is a
problem our entire society
must address. I trust that
Stanford will continue to
learn from our successes
(of which there are many)
as well as our failures.

has a fair share of "PBPs" (Parking
Lot-Building-Parking Lot) employees
but I am pleased to share the names
of some of those individuals serving
Ujamaa whose names have not ap
peared in print but should receive
kudos for their willingness to respond
in a time of need.
If yqu'd like to learn more about
"quality contact people like
Mary Haynes, Jane Williams, C.C.
Cutler, Barbara Howard, Peter Mil
lington and James Sweeney. None of
the preceding have been asked to grant
interviews, or to appear as a featured
guest on any radio or television pro
gram.
They were joined by generous and
caring staff and faculty like Ruby
Mason, Marilynn Reed-Hoskins, Ellen
Woods and Sam Edwards.
There were those individuals who
responded with compassion while, at
the same time, performing their spe
cific duties in response to the incident.

University Vice President and Provost
James Rosse and Director of Univer
sity News Service Bob Beyers are
among those who should be com
mended. The list continues.
Organizations like the Stanford
Black Alumni Club had members
visiting the campus to talk to students
within three hours after the incident.
Members of the Kappa Sigma frater
nity have engaged in joint community
projects with a black sorority in order
to "build bridges" as a result of the
incident. Finally, the greatest praise is
eserved for the individual members of
the Ujamaa community.
Ujamaa continues to be one of the
best communities on campus. While I
have yet to see a copy of the upcoming
fact-finding report on the incident, it is
tragic to have a myriad number of
successes in recent years overshadowed
as a result of the actions of two stu
dents (one of whom lived elsewhere on
campus) and subsequent attempts by
the staff to respond.
Few letters or press reports, if any,
have talked about "pre" or "post
incident life" in Ujamaa. Racism is not
an "Ujamaa" problem. It is a problem
our entire society must address. I trust
that Stanford will continue to learn
from our successes (of which there are
many) as well as our failures. Visit
with us and perhaps you will also be
able to contribute as much to the
University community as the members
of the Ujamaa family.
