## Formal canon required for development of human thought

YES, in reply to Donald Moore's
Jan. 17 letter, I freely admit I
fought for the restoration of
Western Culture, which almost all our
alumni wanted and a strong mcgority
of students subsequently approved.
Largely, because I believe that a
good half of life — physical, genetic,
spinal, grammatical and lexical, musical
tone architecture, etc. — is canonic,
changing very little over vast reaches
of time.
It is the tension and fusion between
that "half', or pole, and the new and
innovative "half' which brings about
superior culture like the French, the
"seminal culture of the West," accord
ing to former British Prime Minister
Winston Churchill.
Its classic "spine" is very firm and
powerful, extending over a millenium,
and it has major innovators as well,
like Flaubert, Mallarme', Rimbaud,

Proust, all of whom were well-versed
in their classics, as was Cezanne,
Debussy, Ravel, Satie, etc.
In "irreverent America,"in the
words of Thomas Mann, this is our
weak ingredient, particularly in contem
porary education, though our finest
writers — Mark Twain, Henry James,
Faulkner, Welty, Bellow, Wilbur, Up
dike — are superbly "rooted" in this
sense.
What is so odd about wanting our
students to have at least one course in
which they read and discuss the recog
nized great books of their heritage, on
which civilized discourse has always
been based?
They have all the other courses in
which to expose themselves to the
other "half," plus their own spare time
reading, which is a better way to do it.
It is true that I am biased in my
preference for my own heritage, inter-

twined with the Christian, etc. — the
Greco-Judeo-Christian way. That is the
very meaning of canonic: being a
specific way before branching out, like
a tree, which grows first through a
trunk or spine.
Otherwise you get the cultural
decline noted by Joseph Campbell in
his recent series of talks will Bill
Moyers: Without a functioning myth,
or a chain of myths in a "canon",
there is bewilderment to the point that
many are not sure of our right to live
at all.
The violent revolts cited by Moore
are a part of the heritage and some
times its literature, but never have
threatened its core as now. It is a
biological-cultural error to contaminate
that core with self-hatred to the point
of suicide, as proposed by Fanon, and
Sartre in his preface to "The Wretched
of the Earth".

It is a similar error to question our
duty to defend our innocent citizens
from terroristic attacks by the likes of
Khomeini and Khadafy.
The hybrid narrative by Paredes,
"With his Pistol in his Hand", is a
mediocre book at best, introduced into
what replaced Western Culture for
.clearly dissident purposes, along with
many another, nine in all, in one
quarter. It is not its violence alone
which bothers me, it is the fact that it
is a revolutionary violence, directed
against our civilization.
In this context I do indeed abhor the
murder of whites en masse in the
French Revolution, as did Vigny in
"Stello", Camus in"The Rebel." I
consider that they were for the most
part "reasonably innocent" in Camus'
phrase. And so are we.
