# Phi Delt Fraternity ready to party again

### DJ Berinstein Staff writer 
The Phi Delta Theta Fraternity
is back in business.
Yesterday the Phi Delts' social
privileges were fully reinstated,
and tonight they will sponsor
their first party of the quarter,
ending a long silence of social
probation.
During fall quarter the Univer
sity placed the Phi Delts on social
probation, after judging that their
annual "Kamikaze" party focused
wholly on alcohol. The duration
of the probation was indefinite.
The Phi Delts presented a pro
posal to Dean of Fraternal Affairs
Joe Pisano in December outlining
a plan to make their future parties
safer and more in line with In

terfraternitv Council guidelines
regarding party regulations. The
initial proposal was rejected by
Pisano as being "a little vague,"
but after modification, it was ac
cepted yesterday.
The party will be closed in order
"to maintain control," said Phi
Delt President Russell Pangborn.
Fliers will be distributed to about
300 people, and the theme will be
a "Welcome Back" party.
"The Phi Delts are still on
probation in fact, but they have
successfully petitioned for social
privileges," Pisano said, explain
ing that last quarter the frater
nity's social privileges were par
tially reinstated, but that they are
"now on normal social status."
In three of the past four fall
quarters the Phi Delts have been

placed on social probation, accord
ing to Pisano.
"We know that we have a his
tory to make up for," said
Pangborn. "The University is be
coming intolerant of us, and it
has been implied that if there are
any more problems, we may lose
the house."
Both Pisano and Phi Delts
members said they recognize the
importance of running smooth
parties this quarter.
"The real purpose of the peti
tion was to make sure that they
(Phi Delts) thought through each
aspect of their parties. ... If they
follow through the guidelines,
they'll be fine."
"We don't want to get in any,
more trouble because we know
they're not going to give us any

more chances," said Pangborn.
Pisano added cautiously that
this may be a trial period for the
fraternity because "The Phi Delts
know that if they blow it, they
will be held accountable, and their
past history will count against
them."
The Phi Delts have been trying
to put those past problems behind
them by making efforts to reach
out to the community.
"We're definitely on the up
swing," said Pangborn. "We've
come a long way compared to last
year."
Phi Delt Social Chair Scott
Patty seemed elated to be off so
cial probation. "We are going to
take the guidelines really
seriously and we hope to follow
them well," he said.
