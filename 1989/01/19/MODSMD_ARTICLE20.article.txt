# Choice of Latin American texts in CIV pilot track bad
## 
### 
Being a native Central American, I
have followed the debate over the im
plementation of Cultures, Ideas and
Values with great interest. Up to this
point, I have chosen to stand back
from the fray, but Allan King's letter
in the Jan. 17 issue of The Daily par
ticularly disturbed me.
I believe King's not-so-subtle in
sinuations about Peter Thiel's charac
ter are completely uncalled for. As I
understand Thiel, he has reservations
about Menchu and other authors cov
ered by the new track, not because of
their race but, for the very legitimate
concern that they reflect Anthropolgy

Prof. Renato Rosaldo's personal politi
cal beliefs and have no literary merit.
I share Thiel's apprehension. In all
my years of reading Latin American
literature, I have never come across
Menchu, nor had other Latin Ameri
cans with whom I spoke.
Chapter headings like "Conflict with
the Landowners and the Creation of
the CUC," "... Rigoberta Renounces
Marriage and Motherhood" and "Strike
of the agricultural workers and the
First of May in the Capital" suggest,
at least to me, that I .. . Rigoberta
Menchu is mainly being used to pro
mote Rosaldo's political views.
If Rosaldo truly aims to select people
that have contributed to Latin Ameri
can culture, why not pick authors like
Miguel Angel Asturias, a Nobel prize
winning Guatemalan writer; Jorge Luis
Borges, a famous Argentinian author;
or Pablo Neruda, a Chilean commu
nist, all of whom have distinguished

themselves as world class writers?
By choosing Menchu as representative
of the Latin American experience,
Rosaldo is giving his students the im
pression that the common Latin Amer
ican feels and thinks exactly as
Menchu does.
I lived in Guatemala and most
Guatemalans are not communists, nor
do they share Menchu's radical ideol
ogy. Unfortunately, for many Stanford
students, this may be the only time
that they will be exposed to Latin
American literature.
I certainly do not want these stu
dents to think that Menchu's work is
one of the greatest contributions of my
culture.
I hope in future years writers more
representative of Latin American cul
ture and more renowned for their
literary achievement are covered.
