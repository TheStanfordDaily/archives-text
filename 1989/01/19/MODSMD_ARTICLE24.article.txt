## Type A traits tarnish life's shine Running ragged to get ahead 
### Jennifer Cotteleer Staff writer 
The quest for achievement
and advancement may have
"short term benefits, but nega
tive long term consequences,"
according to Associate Dean of
Education Carl Thoresen, also
a licensed psychologist. In the
short term, people may feel good
about living up to a perceived
American ideal to be "ruggedly
individual" and "to get ahead."
Paradoxically, however, this
lifestyle may endanger health
and interpersonal skills and
eventually lead to a poorer
quality of life. "Rugged in
dividualism" may become
"ragged individualism," said
Thoresen.
The compulsive need for
public recognition of ac
complishment, a so-called "per
formance" orientation of life, is
a symptom of people with the
Type A personality. The term
Type A has received much at
tention from the media in the
last decade, and is sometimes
used to refer to a single person
ality profile.
According to Thoresen, who
has extensively researched the
Type A theory, the term as used
by the medical community
describes a syndrome â€” a com
plex of various factors linked to
some health problems.
Type A syndrome has three
components. Thoresen empha
sized that everyone may exhibit
one or more of these character
istics some of the time, but Type
A personalities exhibit these
qualities more persistently at ex
treme levels.
Despite the negative effects
to health and interpersonal re
lations attributed to Type A be
havior, many "carry it as a
badge of honor," Thoresen said.
"They believe that the only way
to get ahead is [to exhibit this
type of behavior]."
Thoresen says the syndrome

is concentrated in professional
areas such as banking and man
agement, although it is in no
way restricted to them.
The paradox is that Type A
behavior may in fact lead you
only half way to the top. "The
desired characteristics for a
CEO, for example, (include) the
ability to relate to people."
In the struggle to beat others
to the prizes, the "extreme em
phasis on self' which Thoresen
said also refers to as "me
firstism" may atrophy the skills
of cooperation and interaction.
Those who share the "me-first"
individual's environment may
even deny further opportunity
to establish those relationships,
thereby decreasing the

likelihood of securing a leader
ship position.
Thoresen said that in his prac
tice he deals with adults, in
creasingly young adult profes
sionals, who want to correct the
Type A traits of their personal
ities. He said people make this
attempt both for health reasons
and simply to improve the
quality of their lives.
Thoresen would like people to
move from "performance"
orientations to "service" orienta
tions. He said lifestyles oriented
toward service and people lead
to "the richest" lives. He noted
that "no one is a self-made per
son. Anyone's accomplishments,
no matter how distinguished,
are a part of a joint venture."
