What is a Type A personality?
Type A syndrome involves three attributes, ac
cording to Carl Thoresen:
1. Excessive, publicly oriented competitiveness.
A high GPA, presidency of a club, valedictorian of
a class are examples of typical goals.
2. Time urgency and impatience. Saying yes to
everything, and visualizing each project as another
opportunity to do well leads to an over scheduled
lifestyle that can be "out of control." The person
never finds enough hours in the day.
3. A quickness to anger. This is the most im
portant indication of the syndrome. It underlies a
distrustful, cynical attitude that allows minor ir
ritations to become occasions to get angry.
Interestingly, explosive speech patterns can indi
cate Type A personalities. These people unneces
sarily emphasize words and frequently interrupt
others.
A person displaying any or all of these attributes
is not necessarily a Type A. What "matters is how
extreme you are" in exhibiting any of the charac
teristics, according to Carl Thoresen, associate dean
of education.
