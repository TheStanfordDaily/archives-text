# Chicano faculty review poor record of minority hiring and feel its crunch

An hispanic student approached her professor
after class. She did not understand a concept he
had discussed in his lecture.
Frustrated by the student's confusion, the pro
fessor responded, "Don't you understand English?"
The student's native language was English; she
did not know how to speak Spanish despite her
ethnic background. She never asked for help from
the professor again.
This story of frustration is not unique among
stories students told in response to questionnaires
distributed by the University Committee on Minor
ity Issues during the past year, according to Cecilia
Burciaga, a UCMI committee member.
Despite the substantial increase in enrollment of
Chicano undergraduate students at Stanford over
the past decade, the number of Chicano faculty has
remained small, without any appreciable growth.
And now both faculty and students are feeling the
lack.
Nine years ago, 5.7 percent of the University's
undergraduate student body was Chicano. This year
the number has increased to 8.6 percent.
Chicano faculty members in 1980 made up 0.9
percent of the faculty at Stanford — 10 out of 1,116.
Now a total of 13 out of 1,336 — 1 percent —
constitute the Chicano faculty ranks. Such a small
increase "has been a dismal failure for us [the
Chicano faculty] and the institution," said A 1
Camarillo, associate professor of history.
"The faculty is still pale and male," said Burciaga.
Although Stanford's 19-year-old affirmative ac
tion program aspires to increase the University's
minority faculty representation, its effectiveness has
yet to be proven, according to faculty members.
"The facts are clear that we haven't been success
ful," said Ewart Thomas, dean of the Humanities
and Sciences School.
"Everybody has been running so fast that no one
has really been helping," with affirmative action,
said Burciaga, Associate Dean of Graduate studies.
"We don't have the magnets that . . . are very
attractive to scholars," Thomas said. Likewise, he
added, the type of scholars Stanford seeks might
fall into a very narrow definition due to the Uni
versity's emphasis on research over specialty in
granting tenure and appointments.
According to UCMI Chair Camarillo, minorities
are in "double jeopardy," because "not only do they
have to meet the traditional criteria, but often
they're into research which is nontraditional."
Affirmative action for minority faculty has
changed little, if at all, in academic areas particularly
tuned to undergraduate instruction. For example,
Humanities and Sciences has employed only four
Chicano faculty members for the past 14 years.

Only four of Stanford's 13 Chicano faculty teach
undergraduates.
This lack of additional Chicano faculty does not
mirror the growing undergraduate student interest
in Chicano studies. For example, the student en
rollment in Introduction to Chicano Life and Culture
increased from 38 in 1984-85 to 65 in 1987-88.
Figures show more and more students expressing
interest in ethnic studies. Between 1984 and 1987,
white student enrollment in ethnic studies-related
courses increased 90 percent.
"I think, in fact, more non-minorities are saying
'yeah, I'm going to have to know something about
this'," Burciaga said.
Between teaching and advising the growing num
ber of Chicano students, along with performing
many administrative tasks, Chicano faculty mem
bers have little time for research, the prerequisite
for promotion and tenure.
"Because I'm one of few Chicano faculty on
campus, 11 have] a tremendous number of respon
sibilities," said Camarillo.
Despite the Chicano faculty's efforts to maintain
close interaction with undergraduates, the students
