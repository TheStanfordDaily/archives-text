# Chicano faculty review poor record of minority hiring and feel its crunch

An hispanic student approached her professor
after class. She did not understand a concept he
had discussed in his lecture.
Frustrated by the student's confusion, the pro
fessor responded, "Don't you understand English?"
The student's native language was English; she
did not know how to speak Spanish despite her
ethnic background. She never asked for help from
the professor again.
This story of frustration is not unique among
stories students told in response to questionnaires
distributed by the University Committee on Minor
ity Issues during the past year, according to Cecilia
Burciaga, a UCMI committee member.
Despite the substantial increase in enrollment of
Chicano undergraduate students at Stanford over
the past decade, the number of Chicano faculty has
remained small, without any appreciable growth.
And now both faculty and students are feeling the
lack.
Nine years ago, 5.7 percent of the University's
undergraduate student body was Chicano. This year
the number has increased to 8.6 percent.
Chicano faculty members in 1980 made up 0.9
percent of the faculty at Stanford — 10 out of 1,116.
Now a total of 13 out of 1,336 — 1 percent —
constitute the Chicano faculty ranks. Such a small
increase "has been a dismal failure for us [the
Chicano faculty] and the institution," said A 1
Camarillo, associate professor of history.
"The faculty is still pale and male," said Burciaga.
Although Stanford's 19-year-old affirmative ac
tion program aspires to increase the University's
minority faculty representation, its effectiveness has
yet to be proven, according to faculty members.
"The facts are clear that we haven't been success
ful," said Ewart Thomas, dean of the Humanities
and Sciences School.
"Everybody has been running so fast that no one
has really been helping," with affirmative action,
said Burciaga, Associate Dean of Graduate studies.
"We don't have the magnets that . . . are very
attractive to scholars," Thomas said. Likewise, he
added, the type of scholars Stanford seeks might
fall into a very narrow definition due to the Uni
versity's emphasis on research over specialty in
granting tenure and appointments.
According to UCMI Chair Camarillo, minorities
are in "double jeopardy," because "not only do they
have to meet the traditional criteria, but often
they're into research which is nontraditional."
Affirmative action for minority faculty has
changed little, if at all, in academic areas particularly
tuned to undergraduate instruction. For example,
Humanities and Sciences has employed only four
Chicano faculty members for the past 14 years.

Only four of Stanford's 13 Chicano faculty teach
undergraduates.
This lack of additional Chicano faculty does not
mirror the growing undergraduate student interest
in Chicano studies. For example, the student en
rollment in Introduction to Chicano Life and Culture
increased from 38 in 1984-85 to 65 in 1987-88.
Figures show more and more students expressing
interest in ethnic studies. Between 1984 and 1987,
white student enrollment in ethnic studies-related
courses increased 90 percent.
"I think, in fact, more non-minorities are saying
'yeah, I'm going to have to know something about
this'," Burciaga said.
Between teaching and advising the growing num
ber of Chicano students, along with performing
many administrative tasks, Chicano faculty mem
bers have little time for research, the prerequisite
for promotion and tenure.
"Because I'm one of few Chicano faculty on
campus, 11 have] a tremendous number of respon
sibilities," said Camarillo.
Despite the Chicano faculty's efforts to maintain
close interaction with undergraduates, the students

remain dissatisfied. For example,
MEChA, an organization that
serves Chicano students at Stan
ford and throughout California,
has been striving for the expan
sion of the Chicano Fellows Pro
gram.
The Chicano Fellows Program
offers a variety of courses on the
Chicano experience and provides
teaching experience for graduate
students.
Marc Pizarro, a senior in the
Chicano Fellows Program, said
the program's curriculum "is not
designed to satisfy the needs of
Stanford students" about issues
relevant to the Chicano commu
nity and lacks sufficient faculty
to expand. This year the program
offers five courses, which are
taught by a visiting faculty mem
ber and two graduate fellows.
Other institutions, however,
such as UCLA and UC-Berkeley
have Chicano Studies depart
ments. San Jose State University

had a Mexican-American Studies
department for nearly 20 years,
although it now has a program
instead of a department as a result
of budget cuts.
Jose Carrazco, coordinator of
the Mexican-American Studies
program at San Jose, said, "It
merely reflects the value systems
of these institutions, because
when you really value something
you put your money where your
mouth is."
According to Burciaga, however,
establishing a Chicano Studies de
partment at Stanford would not
be the best solution. A Stanford
department, like that at San Jose,
would be vulnerable to cuts in
the University's budget.
"In the long run, I wonder if
it makes more institutional dif
ference if you have faculty ap
pointed in departments (other
than the Chicano Fellows Pro
gram)," Burciaga said. "I used to
think it was simple," she added,
shaking her head in dismay.
Unfortunately, there appears to
be no simple answer.

The UCMI, however, suggested
a variety of solutions in its interim
report — such as rewarding de
partments that use money from
the Affirmative Action Fund for
appointments of minority faculty,
establishing leave and research
support program for junior fac
ulty and urging active leadership
by department chairs and deans
toward expanded affirmative ac
tion.
"There are viable candidates
out there. The question is
whether any of these people will
be hired," said Camarillo.
With the American Hispanic
population at Stanford growing
nearly five times faster than the
rest of the population, the Uni
versity is feeling the need to hire
more Chicano faculty in order to
continue to mirror the diversity
of the student body.
With a troubled sigh Burciaga
said, "I think that the true issue
here is integrating into every piece
of our curriculum a way to deal
with the changing nature of soci
ety in general."
