## 'Parting' offers new approach to King biography 
### Parting the Waters: America in the King Years 1954-1963" by Taylor Branch Simon Schuster, $24. 95

Finally, someone is getting it
right.
Taylor Branch's "Parting the
Waters" is the first volume of
what is so far the best biography
yet written of Martin Luther King
Jr. and the movement that
changed his and all of our lives.
Branch's aim is to "knit to
gether a number of personal
stories along the main seam of
an American epoch." The result
is much like a beautiful quilt: bril
liant, complex, fascinating and re
flective of infinite patience and
care.
King biographies — from the
adoring "Let the Trumpet
Sound," by Stephen B. Oates, to
the exhaustively researched but
tedious and uninterpretive "Bear
ing the Cross," by David Garrow
— have in general suffered from
an obsessive preoccupation with
their subject. Even when they
have agreed with Stanford histo
rian Clay Carson that King was
not "the initiator and sole indis
pensible element of the Move

ment," they have in general fo
cused exclusively on r "
In doing so, A .y have missed
an essential way in which King
was as much the product and the
producer of mass activism.
To truly capture King, as some
one who responded to, partici
pated in and helped shape the
course of the black movement, an
author must restore a hundred
leaders to their places.
This is exactly what Branch
does. He paints portraits of
notable leaders like James Law
son, Gandhian mentor to a gen
eration of militant nonviolent stu
dents; the wise and courageous
Stptima Clark, organizer of the
Voter Education Project; and the
fearless and canny loose-cannon
James Bevel, organizer of the fa
mous and controversial "child
ren's march" in Birmingham.
Like a Zen archer, Branch hits
his mark by not aiming at it.
"Parting" thus shows us King
in a new light, not merely as a
skillful orator who could whip up
an audience before sending them
off to be arrested, but as a con
ciliator and consensus-builder
among strong-willed and indepen
dent leaders like Hosea Williams
and Wyatt Walker.

The pa:-" at
Baptist Church in Montgomery,
Ala., before King assumed the
post in 1955, Johns lost his po
sition because he was a maverick
to both whites and "respectable
blacks."
By beginning with a discussion
of Johns, Branch sets the tone
for the rest of his book. He dem
onstrates that the Movement was
specifically rooted in the courage,
resources and institutions of mil
lions of uncelebrated people whose
work preceded civil rights as a
"national" (i.e., white) issue.
Branch skillfully shows how

painfully long it took for the dom
inant institutions of white society,
the federal government and the
press, even to acknowledge that
the black struggle for freedom and
equality was an "issue." Branch
copiously documents King's vital
role in bringing about this
recognition through the force of
his rhetoric, the drama and timing
of his actions and the sheer luck
of being in the right place at the
right time.
Branch also studiously details
the less perceptible machinations
on both sides of Dußois' plate
glass barrier separating the races.
Branch describes how FBI Di
rector J. Hoover was able
to carry ( .t his personal vendetta
against .ung unrestrained by At
torney General Robert Kennedy
because Hoover had evidence that
President Kennedy had slept with
a possible East German spy. And
he discusses the fact that King
suffered one of his most serious
and endurin 0 defeats unnoticed
by the white press — when the
candidate King sponsored in the
September 1961 presidential elec
tion of the Naticnal Baptist Con
vention was defeated in a chaotic,
violent clash between activist and
conservative factions.
The inestimable service these
and a thousand other hidden
details play in Branch's narrative
is to demonstrate how King was
scorned by much of white and
black society as a radical and an
extremist even before the 1963
March on Washington and the"I
Have a Dream" speech — when
the Movement's methods were un
questionably nonviolent and its
goals unimpeachably reformist.
The real strength of "Parting,"
though, lies in its brilliant
storytelling. Events in the book
rush at you with an immediacy
and intensity rare in civil rights
scholarship.
Branch makes you feel the
panic on the freedom riders' bus
as it is torched on a remote Ala
bama highway. He makes your
eyes burn from the tear gas as
whites rioted over the admission
of James Meredith to the Univer
sity of Mississippi. He puts you
right there amid the exhilaration
and fear, the sermons and free
dom songs of a mass meeting in
Birmingham.
He makes you feel the damp
isolation of King's jail cell.
"Parting" is not a social history,
like William Chafe's "Civilities
and Civil Rights," where a local
movement is examined in all of
its dynamism and complexity.
Branch offers no interpretations
of the sources and timing of black
activism, or explicit views of the
efficacy of various leadership
styles in the Movement.
The book also glances over some
very important details from
King's life: the importance of his
youthful anti-capitalism, for ex

ample, or the deep impressions
King drew from both India's
poverty and her leaders.
In addition, the structure of
"Parting" can be problematic. If
the book is a beautiful quilt, it is
also sometimes patchy: Tales are
split, interpolated, juxtaposed in
sometimes needless confusion.
Occasional digressions into events
such as the Cuban Missile Crisis
or the Sputnick launch serve more
to distract the reader than to
deepen the quilt's composition.

'Parting' shows us
King not merely as
a skillful orator but
as a consensus
builder among
strong-willed
leaders.

Branch is also sometimes care
less with sources, as when a con
versation with Bayard Rustin is
printed verbatim from Rustin's
interview conducted nearly 30
years after the fact.
But "Parting" remains a mag

nificent Movement chronicle, a fat
book by a journalist that can com
fortably sit on a very short shelf
with similar goldmines such as
Richard Kluger's "Simple Justice"
and J. Anthony Lucas' "Common
Ground."
For Branch, volume two is sure
to pose a tremendous challenge.
After the 1963 March or» Wash
ington, the pressures on King
mounted and the Movement began
to splinter. King became much
more of a maverick, more radical,
more willing to take on all three
of what he called "America's evil
triplets" — namely, militarism
and class exploitation in addition
to racism.
The issues after 1963 became
infinitely more complex, contro
versial, intractable: Not only the
vote, but jobs, housing, the ghetto,
black nationalism, white back
lash, the Vietnam war and
capitalism itself became signifi
cant factors in the black freedom
struggle. Organizing this narra
tive will take even more care and
theoretical sophistication than
has volume one.
Good luck, Taylor Branch. 1

Taylor Branch's "Parting the

Branch's aim is to "knit to

is much like a beautiful quilt: bril

To truly capture King, as some

author must restore a hundred
leaders to their places.
This is exactly what Branch

by the white press — when the
candidate King sponsored in the
September 1961 presidential elec

violent clash between activist and

the Movement's methods were un
questionably nonviolent and its
goals unimpeachably reformist.
The real strength of "Parting,"
though, lies in its brilliant
storytelling. Events in the book
rush at you with an immediacy

Branch makes you feel the
panic on the freedom riders' bus
as it is torched on a remote Ala

eyes burn from the tear gas as
whites rioted over the admission
of James Meredith to the Univer

right there amid the exhilaration
and fear, the sermons and free
dom songs of a mass meeting in
Birmingham.
He makes you feel the damp
isolation of King's jail cell.
"Parting" is not a social history,
like William Chafe's "Civilities
and Civil Rights," where a local
movement is examined in all of
its dynamism and complexity.
Branch offers no interpretations
of the sources and timing of black
activism, or explicit views of the
efficacy of various leadership
styles in the Movement.
The book also glances over some
very important details from
King's life: the importance of his
youthful anti-capitalism, for ex

ample, or the deep impressions
King drew from both India's
poverty and her leaders.
In addition, the structure of
"Parting" can be problematic. If
the book is a beautiful quilt, it is
also sometimes patchy: Tales are
split, interpolated, juxtaposed in
sometimes needless confusion.
Occasional digressions into events
such as the Cuban Missile Crisis

to distract the reader than to
deepen the quilt's composition.

'Parting' shows us
King not merely as

Branch is also sometimes care

the book is a beautiful quilt, it is
also sometimes patchy: Tales are
split, interpolated, juxtaposed in
sometimes needless confusion.
Occasional digressions into events
such as the Cuban Missile Crisis
or the Sputnick launch serve more
to distract the reader than to
deepen the quilt's composition.

'Parting' shows us
King not merely as
a skillful orator but
as a consensus
builder among
strong-willed
leaders.

Branch is also sometimes care
less with sources, as when a con
versation with Bayard Rustin is
printed verbatim from Rustin's
interview conducted nearly 30
years after the fact.
But "Parting" remains a mag

nificent Movement chronicle, a fat
book by a journalist that can com
fortably sit on a very short shelf
with similar goldmines such as
Richard Kluger's "Simple Justice"
and J. Anthony Lucas' "Common
Ground."
For Branch, volume two is sure
to pose a tremendous challenge.
After the 1963 March or» Wash
ington, the pressures on King
mounted and the Movement began
to splinter. King became much
more of a maverick, more radical,
more willing to take on all three
of what he called "America's evil
triplets" — namely, militarism
and class exploitation in addition
to racism.
The issues after 1963 became
infinitely more complex, contro
versial, intractable: Not only the
vote, but jobs, housing, the ghetto,
black nationalism, white back
lash, the Vietnam war and
capitalism itself became signifi
cant factors in the black freedom
struggle. Organizing this narra
tive will take even more care and
theoretical sophistication than
has volume one.
Good luck, Taylor Branch. 1
can't wait.

Martin Luther King Jr. was arrested for the first time in his life on Feb. 21, 1956 under an old Alabama
statute that denied people's right to boycott. His wife Coretta King celebrated her husband's arrest
because it would bring national attention to the cause.
