## Taylor is Bears' sharpest claw 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
With enemies like California center Leonard
Taylor, who needs friends?
Taylor is the last guy the Stanford men's bas
ketball team wants to see when it challenges the
Golden Bears at 7:30 p.m. tonight at Harmon Arena
in Berkeley. The 6-foot-8, 220-pound senior from
Inglewood, Calif, is one of the dominant forces in
the Pacific 10 Conference — perhaps no team, in
cluding Stanford and Arizona, rests so much of its
fortunes on one player as Cal does on Taylor.
But there's a funny thing about this particular
archrival. Guys on the Cardinal like him. Even
Stanford forward Howard Wright, the player who
may match up against Taylor for much of tonight's
game, the player who will often be jostling nose-to
nose in direct conflict down in the paint for the
ball, fraternizes with the enemy.
"Me and Howard are good friends," Taylor says.
It's enough to make Mike Ditka upchuck his
Chunky soup. The next thing you know, Gorbachev
will be exchanging pleasantries with Reagan and
Bush, or something outrageous like that.
Of course, the Cardinal players are aware enough
of the unique situation of their alliance with Taylor
to make some adjustments that normally one doesn't
associate with friendship.
"We're pretty good friends," says Wright, before
immediately adding, "Hopefully I'll get him in foul
trouble or something so he won't play 40 (minutes)."
Like a true amigo, Taylor reciprocates this delight
ful sentiment. Despite the fact that he is a social
welfare major and will follow in his mother's
footsteps as a social worker after his basketball
career is done, Taylor is not about to offer any
charity.
"On the court you've still got to play hard," he
says. "You can't slack off .. . because they're your
friends. But off the court, hey, we're buddies."
Taylor and his friends across the bay conceivably
have had a lot of time to develop a rapport, because
Taylor hasn't played in a Pac-10 game against Stan
ford since 1986.
Taylor got off to a great beginnningas a freshman
in 1984-85, starting every game and averaging 12.4
points and 6.1 rebounds on the way to becoming

Senior Leonard Taylor, who is averaging 22.2 points per game in Pac-10 Conference
play, will lead the Golden Bears against Stanford tonight in Harmon Arena.
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year.
Things started off even brighter
sophomore year. He placed his
name among the league leaders
in rebounding and field-goal per
centage.
But then that bug that not even
Raid can kill, the injury bug,
landed on Taylor, and stayed with
him for quite some time.
Toward the end of his second
season, a cracked bone in his
shooting hand caused his season
to flounder some. Then in 1986-
87, he was leading Cal in 11
statistical categories before a neck
injury sidelined him one-third of
the way into the season.
Recovered from that ailment,
Taylor completed the injury hat
trick by breaking a bone in his

right foot prior to the start of the
1987-88 season.
But now its payback time for
Taylor and the Bears. After miss
ing the Bears' last 50 games,
Taylor took the floor in Cal's
season opener and snared 15
rebounds in leading the Bears
over then-No. 15 Florida. Already
Cal has surpassed last season with
12 wins in its first 17 games.
"Everything's gone the way I've
wanted it to," Taylor says.
Now, Taylor is more dangerous
than ever. He is averaging 18.4
ppg and 8.5 rpg overall this year,
and in Pac-10 play he's even
turned it up a notch: scoring 22.2
ppg and shooting 64.6 percent
from the field.
From watching Cal play, one
can see these statistics develop.
Its offense is definitely Taylor
made. And that weighs on the
mind of one of his friends.

"I'm looking forward to the
challenge (of guarding him),"
Wright says. "I'm not looking for
ward to the fact that they go to
him every play.
"They pass the ball around until
he touches the ball," Wright goes
on. "If he doesn't like the shot,
he passes it out and they go to
the other side."
In his four previous games
against Stanford, Taylor has only
taken 17 shots. However, he has
made 11 of those, indicating that
the extent Stanford can or can't
deny Taylor the ball could deter
mine the outcome of the game.
"They (Wright and Stanford
center Eric Reveno) play really
hard, really physical," Taylor
says. "I'm the same way. I'm just
going to play my game like I've
been playing this season and see
what happens."
After all, what are friends for?

Like a true amigo, Taylor reciprocates this delight
ful sentiment. Despite the fact that he is a social
welfare major and will follow in his mother's
footsteps as a social worker after his basketball
career is done, Taylor is not about to offer any
charity.
"On the court you've still got to play hard," he
says. "You can't slack off .. . because they're your
friends. But off the court, hey, we're buddies."
Taylor and his friends across the bay conceivably
have had a lot of time to develop a rapport, because
Taylor hasn't played in a Pac-10 game against Stan
ford since 1986.
Taylor got off to a great beginnningas a freshman
in 1984-85, starting every game and averaging 12.4
points and 6.1 rebounds on the way to becoming

Senior Leonard Taylor, who is averaging 22.2 points per game in Pac-10 Conference
play, will lead the Golden Bears against Stanford tonight in Harmon Arena.
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year.
Things started off even brighter
sophomore year. He placed his
name among the league leaders
in rebounding and field-goal per
centage.
But then that bug that not even
Raid can kill, the injury bug,
landed on Taylor, and stayed with
him for quite some time.
Toward the end of his second
season, a cracked bone in his
shooting hand caused his season
to flounder some. Then in 1986-
87, he was leading Cal in 11
statistical categories before a neck
injury sidelined him one-third of
the way into the season.
Recovered from that ailment,
Taylor completed the injury hat
trick by breaking a bone in his

right foot prior to the start of the
1987-88 season.
But now its payback time for
Taylor and the Bears. After miss
ing the Bears' last 50 games,
Taylor took the floor in Cal's
season opener and snared 15
rebounds in leading the Bears
over then-No. 15 Florida. Already
Cal has surpassed last season with
12 wins in its first 17 games.
"Everything's gone the way I've
wanted it to," Taylor says.
Now, Taylor is more dangerous
than ever. He is averaging 18.4
ppg and 8.5 rpg overall this year,
and in Pac-10 play he's even
turned it up a notch: scoring 22.2
ppg and shooting 64.6 percent
from the field.
From watching Cal play, one
can see these statistics develop.
Its offense is definitely Taylor
made. And that weighs on the
mind of one of his friends.

"I'm looking forward to the
challenge (of guarding him),"
Wright says. "I'm not looking for
ward to the fact that they go to
him every play.
"They pass the ball around until
he touches the ball," Wright goes
on. "If he doesn't like the shot,
he passes it out and they go to
the other side."
In his four previous games
against Stanford, Taylor has only
taken 17 shots. However, he has
made 11 of those, indicating that
the extent Stanford can or can't
deny Taylor the ball could deter
mine the outcome of the game.
"They (Wright and Stanford
center Eric Reveno) play really
hard, really physical," Taylor
says. "I'm the same way. I'm just
going to play my game like I've
been playing this season and see
what happens."
After all, what are friends for?
With enemies like California center Leonard
Taylor, who needs friends?
Taylor is the last guy the Stanford men's bas
ketball team wants to see when it challenges the
Golden Bears at 7:30 p.m. tonight at Harmon Arena
in Berkeley. The 6-foot-8, 220-pound senior from
Inglewood, Calif, is one of the dominant forces in
the Pacific 10 Conference — perhaps no team, in
cluding Stanford and Arizona, rests so much of its
fortunes on one player as Cal does on Taylor.
But there's a funny thing about this particular
archrival. Guys on the Cardinal like him. Even
Stanford forward Howard Wright, the player who
may match up against Taylor for much of tonight's
game, the player who will often be jostling nose-to
nose in direct conflict down in the paint for the
ball, fraternizes with the enemy.
"Me and Howard are good friends," Taylor says.
It's enough to make Mike Ditka upchuck his
Chunky soup. The next thing you know, Gorbachev
will be exchanging pleasantries with Reagan and
Bush, or something outrageous like that.
Of course, the Cardinal players are aware enough
of the unique situation of their alliance with Taylor
to make some adjustments that normally one doesn't
associate with friendship.
"We're pretty good friends," says Wright, before
immediately adding, "Hopefully I'll get him in foul
trouble or something so he won't play 40 (minutes)."
