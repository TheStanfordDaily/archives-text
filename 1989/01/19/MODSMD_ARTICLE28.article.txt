## Taylor is Bears' sharpest claw 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
With enemies like California center Leonard
Taylor, who needs friends?
Taylor is the last guy the Stanford men's bas
ketball team wants to see when it challenges the
Golden Bears at 7:30 p.m. tonight at Harmon Arena
in Berkeley. The 6-foot-8, 220-pound senior from
Inglewood, Calif, is one of the dominant forces in
the Pacific 10 Conference â€” perhaps no team, in
cluding Stanford and Arizona, rests so much of its
fortunes on one player as Cal does on Taylor.
But there's a funny thing about this particular
archrival. Guys on the Cardinal like him. Even
Stanford forward Howard Wright, the player who
may match up against Taylor for much of tonight's
game, the player who will often be jostling nose-to
nose in direct conflict down in the paint for the
ball, fraternizes with the enemy.
"Me and Howard are good friends," Taylor says.
It's enough to make Mike Ditka upchuck his
Chunky soup. The next thing you know, Gorbachev
will be exchanging pleasantries with Reagan and
Bush, or something outrageous like that.
Of course, the Cardinal players are aware enough
of the unique situation of their alliance with Taylor
to make some adjustments that normally one doesn't
associate with friendship.
"We're pretty good friends," says Wright, before
immediately adding, "Hopefully I'll get him in foul
trouble or something so he won't play 40 (minutes)."
Like a true amigo, Taylor reciprocates this delight
ful sentiment. Despite the fact that he is a social
welfare major and will follow in his mother's
footsteps as a social worker after his basketball
career is done, Taylor is not about to offer any
charity.
"On the court you've still got to play hard," he
says. "You can't slack off .. . because they're your
friends. But off the court, hey, we're buddies."
Taylor and his friends across the bay conceivably
have had a lot of time to develop a rapport, because
Taylor hasn't played in a Pac-10 game against Stan
ford since 1986.
Taylor got off to a great beginnningas a freshman
in 1984-85, starting every game and averaging 12.4
points and 6.1 rebounds on the way to becoming
