SERIES - Cal leads the all-time series 127-83, starting with a 38-28 win
in 1914-15. Stanford, is trying to win its fourth straight game from Cal for
the first time since 1963-66 but is 4-10 in the last 14 meetings. Cal is
42-33 in Harmon Arena. Last year at Harmon the Cardinal rallied from
deficits of 11-1 and 29-15 to win 71-61.
BEAR UPDATE — Cal split last weekend, defeating Washington State 63-62
in a game in which it had a 1988-89 Pac-10 low four turnovers, and then
losing to Washington 82-80 on a basket at the buzzer Bears forward/center
Leonard Taylor is fifth in the Pac-10 in scoring (18.4 ppg). Guard Keith
Smith (13.1 ppg). and forwards Roy Fisher (12.4 ppg) and Matt Beeuw
saert (10.5 ppg) are the Bears' other claws.
CARDINAL UPDATE — Stanford is now ranked 20th by Associated Press
and 18th by United Press International and USA Today/CNN Stanford
has won eight straight games, its longest winning streak since 1983-84
Freshman forward Adam Keefe is shooting 83 percent in his last seven
games. Senior guard Terry Taylor has only one turnover in his last four
games. Stanford leads the Pac-10 in the following per-game categories:
scoring defense (64.7), rebounding (36.5), rebounding margin (11.0),
field-goal percentage (53.1), 3-point field-goal percentage (50.8), assists
(20.5) and field-goal percentage defense (43.4). Stat of the day: Senior
guard Todd Lichti leads the Pac-10 in highest percentage of a player's
team's shots taken — 27.0 percent. Lichti also leads the conference in
scoring (21.7 ppg) and free-throw percentage: 89.6.
KEYS TO VICTORY — Cal will be doing all it can to get the ball to its meal
ticket, Leonard Taylor. If Stanford can deny Taylor the ball without leaving
his teammates too dangerously open, the Bears' offense will sputter. On
the other end, Stanford's Terry Taylor will need to operate the offense
amidst the maniacal Harmon Arena crowd. This rates with Arizona Jan
29 as one of the toughest road conference games Stanford will play
NEXT FOR STANFORD — UCLA (9-4, 4-1) comes into town Saturday for a
3 p.m. game at Maples Pavilion. The Bruins, currently one-half game
behind the Cardinal in the Pac-10, host Arizona State (8-6, 2-4) at Pauley
