# 'You Can Make a Difference' kicks off Sunday
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Senior staff writer 
Bay Area residents will have the
opportunity this Sunday to wit
ness two very different kick-offs.
The first, and most obvious,
will be the one beginning Super
Bowl XXIII. However, before the
San Francisco 49ers and the Cin
cinnati Bengals begin their battle,
residents will have an opportunity
to reflect on the problems facing
our environment at the kick-ofT
to the sixth-annual You Can Make
a Difference Conference.
This year's conference, "Decid
ing our Environmental Future,"
will get underway Sunday morn
ing at 10 a.m. in Memorial Church
with a program titled, "Faith, Phi
losophy and Our Relationship to
the Natural Environment."
The program will consist of a

one-hour, non-denominationai
service followed by a panel dis
cussion featuring four environ
mentalists from a broad spectrum
of religious and philosophical
beliefs.
The speakers are Rev. Don
Castro, a Buddhist minister; Prof.
Paula Gunn Allen, an expert on
Native American culture and re
ligion; Charlene Spretnak, an eco

feminist philosopher and Dr. Har
lan Stelmach, an expert on
theological ethics and social policy.
According to freshman Leilah
Powell, an organizer of the event,
the panelists represent a mix of
traditions designed to prompt lis
teners to understand and question
the ways in which different
people's religious backgrounds
color their views of the environ
ment.
Sunday's service will be far
from the usual weekly sermon,
Powell said. It will include Bud
dhist worshipping, Native Amer
ican story-telling and chanting as
well as the traditional Biblical
hymns and psalms.
The program will conclude out
side the church with a tree
planting by Stanford Hillel in
honor of Tu B'Shevat, the Jewish
New Year for trees.

Tu B'Shevat dates back to bibli
cal times when farmers were not
allowed to harvest fruit from their
trees until the tree was 5 years
old. The holiday is held on the
day almond trees bloom in Israel
and is the symbolic birthday of
all trees, according to Rabbi Ari
Cartun, executive director of Hil
lel.
Tu B'Shevat has also gradually
evolved to a "day to focus on en
vironmental concerns," Cartun
said.
The bulk of this year's confer
ence will take place on Jan. 28
and 29 and will feature more than
130 different speakers in a num
ber of workshops and debates. The
main session will be moderated
by Ted Koppel of the ABC news
show, "Nightline."
