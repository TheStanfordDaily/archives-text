# 'You Can Make a Difference' kicks off Sunday
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Senior staff writer 
Bay Area residents will have the
opportunity this Sunday to wit
ness two very different kick-offs.
The first, and most obvious,
will be the one beginning Super
Bowl XXIII. However, before the
San Francisco 49ers and the Cin
cinnati Bengals begin their battle,
residents will have an opportunity
to reflect on the problems facing
our environment at the kick-ofT
to the sixth-annual You Can Make
a Difference Conference.
This year's conference, "Decid
ing our Environmental Future,"
will get underway Sunday morn
ing at 10 a.m. in Memorial Church
with a program titled, "Faith, Phi
losophy and Our Relationship to
the Natural Environment."
The program will consist of a

Deciding Our
HN^Hri 1 Environmental

one-hour, non-denominationai
service followed by a panel dis
cussion featuring four environ
mentalists from a broad spectrum
of religious and philosophical
beliefs.
The speakers are Rev. Don
Castro, a Buddhist minister; Prof.
Paula Gunn Allen, an expert on
Native American culture and re
ligion; Charlene Spretnak, an eco

feminist philosopher and Dr. Har
lan Stelmach, an expert on
theological ethics and social policy.
According to freshman Leilah
Powell, an organizer of the event,
the panelists represent a mix of
traditions designed to prompt lis
teners to understand and question
the ways in which different
people's religious backgrounds
color their views of the environ
ment.
Sunday's service will be far
from the usual weekly sermon,
Powell said. It will include Bud
dhist worshipping, Native Amer
ican story-telling and chanting as
well as the traditional Biblical
hymns and psalms.
The program will conclude out
side the church with a tree
planting by Stanford Hillel in
honor of Tu B'Shevat, the Jewish
New Year for trees.

Tu B'Shevat dates back to bibli
cal times when farmers were not
allowed to harvest fruit from their
trees until the tree was 5 years
old. The holiday is held on the
day almond trees bloom in Israel
and is the symbolic birthday of
all trees, according to Rabbi Ari
Cartun, executive director of Hil
lel.
Tu B'Shevat has also gradually
evolved to a "day to focus on en
vironmental concerns," Cartun
said.
The bulk of this year's confer
ence will take place on Jan. 28
and 29 and will feature more than
130 different speakers in a num
ber of workshops and debates. The
main session will be moderated
by Ted Koppel of the ABC news
show, "Nightline."
The sessions will feature not
only experts but some of the ac
tual players in environmental de
cision making, according to junior
Smita Singh, a co-director of the
conference.
In some cases, there will be in
dustry executives in the same
room as environmental groups
who protest their company's prac
tices, Singh said.
This year's conference marks
the sixth annual such event. Pre
vious topics have included hunger,
institutional racism and families
in a changing society.
The purpose of the series is two
fold, Singh said. First, the con
ferences concentrate on educating
people about important issues of
social concern. More importantly,
though, the organizers of the
event "want to empower people
and make them feel they can

make a difference," she said.
According to Anna Waring,
publicity and publications coordi
nator at the Public Service Center,
the idea for the conferences was
initiated by a 1982 speech by Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
at a Stanford Graduate School of
Business conference on entrepre
neurship. Kennedy spoke about
how students and citizens needed
to become more involved in issues
which affected everyone.
The first conference, focusing
on "Entrepreneurs in the Public
Interest," was held in February
ISB4 at the Business School. Con
ferences are initiated and directed
by both graduate and undergrad
uate students from all depart
ments of the University.
Although this Sunday's pro
gram is open to anyone, admit
tance to any other conference
event requires pre-registration be
cause of limited seating. The con
ference is free for people affiliated
with Stanford, $10 for non-
Stanford people and $5 for stu
dents from other schools.

theological ethics and social policy.
According to freshman Leilah
Powell, an organizer of the event,
the panelists represent a mix of
traditions designed to prompt lis
teners to understand and question
the ways in which different
people's religious backgrounds
color their views of the environ
ment.
Sunday's service will be far
from the usual weekly sermon,
Powell said. It will include Bud
dhist worshipping, Native Amer
ican story-telling and chanting as
well as the traditional Biblical
hymns and psalms.
The program will conclude out
side the church with a tree
planting by Stanford Hillel in
honor of Tu B'Shevat, the Jewish
New Year for trees.

Tu B'Shevat dates back to bibli
cal times when farmers were not
allowed to harvest fruit from their
trees until the tree was 5 years
old. The holiday is held on the
day almond trees bloom in Israel
and is the symbolic birthday of
all trees, according to Rabbi Ari
Cartun, executive director of Hil
lel.
Tu B'Shevat has also gradually
evolved to a "day to focus on en
vironmental concerns," Cartun
said.
The bulk of this year's confer
ence will take place on Jan. 28
and 29 and will feature more than
130 different speakers in a num
ber of workshops and debates. The
main session will be moderated
by Ted Koppel of the ABC news
show, "Nightline."
The sessions will feature not
only experts but some of the ac
tual players in environmental de
cision making, according to junior
Smita Singh, a co-director of the
conference.
In some cases, there will be in
dustry executives in the same
room as environmental groups
who protest their company's prac
tices, Singh said.
This year's conference marks
the sixth annual such event. Pre
vious topics have included hunger,
institutional racism and families
in a changing society.
The purpose of the series is two
fold, Singh said. First, the con
ferences concentrate on educating
people about important issues of
social concern. More importantly,
though, the organizers of the
event "want to empower people
and make them feel they can

make a difference," she said.
According to Anna Waring,
publicity and publications coordi
nator at the Public Service Center,
the idea for the conferences was
initiated by a 1982 speech by Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
at a Stanford Graduate School of
Business conference on entrepre
neurship. Kennedy spoke about
how students and citizens needed
to become more involved in issues
which affected everyone.
The first conference, focusing
on "Entrepreneurs in the Public
Interest," was held in February
ISB4 at the Business School. Con
ferences are initiated and directed
by both graduate and undergrad
uate students from all depart
ments of the University.
Although this Sunday's pro
gram is open to anyone, admit
tance to any other conference
event requires pre-registration be
cause of limited seating. The con
ference is free for people affiliated
with Stanford, $10 for non-
Stanford people and $5 for stu
dents from other schools.
