# Super Bowl media hype: Nothing exceeds like excess
## 
### 
I want to take this opportunity
to point out the absurd amount
of press coverage given to the
Super Bowl over the past two
weeks. If you live in a black hole,
you might not have noticed.

We first have a humongous pic
ture of 49er Jerry Rice's hands,
two of the most precious in the
world. Now, the picture does show
Jerry's face, and he has a big
smile plastered to it, yet he was
supposedly upset at having his
picture taken At any rate, I'm
not sure why he was smiling —
he re-sprained his oft-injured
right ankle this week in practice
and said Wednesday he's unsure
he'll play Sunday. San Francisco
Head Coach Bill Walsh said he'll
play. Bet on Walsh.
And if they were going to depict
a Rice body part anyway, why
didn't they blow up the storied
ankle, instead of his hands, which

are fine? Or if they had a Super
Bowl hand fettish, why not de
fensive back Ronnie Lott's hand?
He once elected to have the last
joint of his pinkie removed so he
could play rather than go under
the knife and miss several weeks.
Sounds more interesting to me
than a sprained ankle.
O.K. Next we have a story on
the Cincinnati no-huddle offense
and its effects on the Niner de
fense. This is a legitimate concern
for the Niners. But aren't you
sick of hearing about the no
huddle? I mean, weren't you em
barassed for Buffalo Bills coach
Marv Levy, who whined about it
before the AFC title game? You
don't hear Walsh sounding off. It
may be that someone else did his
dirty work for him. But that's
Walsh. No matter what happens,
his hands always stay clean.
Then we have this column
about how Cincinnati coach Sam
Wyche is a pop-off. So what. Sure,
Sam has made some enemies
across the league with his tongue,
but it just contributes to the
laundry list of stories. Tell me
more about the Warriors, who
were on a roll entering last night's
game with the Knicks. Don't they
play in the Bay Area?
Back to the smorgasbord. There
was another story about poverty
in Overtown near Miami. There
was another story about the

"Cover Brothers" of the 49ers,
Tim McKyer and Don Griffin. We
saw Tim's hat, which says"The
Blanket" on it, and the "Cover
Brothers" T-shirts they wear,
which have caricatures of the two
players. Neat, huh.
Next we have what I will call
the "Roundup" section, which in
cludes pictures from Dwight Clark
examining his nails in the stands
to Ickey Woods growling at the
camera to Joe Montana holding
the bridge of his nose. News tid
bits include more speculation
about Walsh's future, ticket scalp
ing and two clinchers: first, a note
telling us quote-master Randy
Cross is getting his mouth in
shape for the final days of inter
views, and the figures for the
onslaught of Miami by the media
(2,200-2,250 people).
But wait, there's more. Another
column on the scoop about Rice's
ankle. And an article on Bengal
lineman Anthony Munoz. And one
more column about the enigmatic
Walsh. A story about betting on
the game. A column on Montana.
I think you can see my point.
And think of this: All of the
stories and pictures I have de
scribed appeared in Wednesday's
edition of the San Francisco
Chronicle.
