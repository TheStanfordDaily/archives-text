In a rare trip west of California,
the Stanford sailing team traveled
to Waikiki last weekend to com
pete in the annual Hawaiian In
vitational Regatta, which brought
together some of the best teams
in the Pacific Region for two days
of challenging racing.
In the overall standings, Stan
ford's foursome of senior Ev Rend,
juniors Robert Brown and
Kathryn Haggitt, and sophomore
Sarah Gannett finished in fourth
place, just behind first-place USC,
second-place Hawaii and third
place California.

gale warning, and during the day
winds of 25 to 35 knots gusted

Bay Though the breeze settled
down to 15 to 20 knots on Sunday,
occassional gusts continued to
knock over boats right and left.

nor the B-team was comfortable

those conditions," Rend said.
"We hadn't sailed in heavy
winds and waves very much lately,
and it was no fun getting reac
quainted with those conditions,"
(iannett commented.
Still, the team improved
throughout the regatta. Rend and
Gannett captured second in A-
Division on Sunday, and Brown
and Haggitt held a considerable
lead in the final race until a shift
in the course layout left them
searching for a mark.
More importantly, the team en
joyed its visit to Hawaii, which
was qptirely paid for by the sailors
themselves After four days in
paradise, the Cardinal squad
found it hard to head back to
winter in San Francisco.
"There were so many sights to
see. We'll have to go back next
year," Stanford Coach Blake Mid
dleton said.
