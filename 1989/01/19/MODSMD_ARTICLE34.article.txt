DURHAM, N.C. (AP) - Scott
Williams sparked North
Carolina's inside game, scoring
22 points to lead the 13th
ranked Tar Heels to a stunning
91-71 upset of top-ranked Duke
in an Atlantic Coast Conference
game Wednesday night.
Duke suffered its first loss of
the season after 13 victories and
fell to 3-1 in the ACC.
The Tar Heels, who dropped
a 23-point decision at Virginia
last Sunday, clogged the inside
and shut down Duke's offense.
With Danny Ferry nursing a
sore back, the Blue Devils didn't
fare much better from the
perimeter, either.
North Carolina, 15-3 and 2-1

in the ACC, pounded the boards
on both ends to take charge. Of
their 14 baskets in the second
half, only one was a jumper
from beyond 10 feet.
Running up a 10-point lead
midway through the first half,
North Carolina held a 39-34
halftime lead. The Blue Devils
started the second half with a
9-0 run, capped by a Robert
Brickey layup with 17:46
remaining, for a 43-39 advan
tage, its first lead since the
opening basket.
After the Tar Heels took a
timeout, North Carolina came
back with six straight points.
Duke answered with three bas
kets of its own, the last a 3-

pointer by Phil Henderson with
14:50 left, for a 50-45 lead.
North Carolina charged back
and took the lead for keeps. A
13-2 run gave the Tar Heels a
58-52 edge, and the runaway
was on with the lead growing
as big as the final margin on
the strength of 15 of 19 free
throws in the last 10 minutes.
King Rice, who took over the
point guard position for the in
jured Jeff Lebo, scored 14
points. J.R. Reid, starting for
the first time this season, had
13 points for the Tar Heels.
Kevin Madden had 10 points.
Brickey, who went out briefly
with a shoulder injury, led Duke
with 20 points.
