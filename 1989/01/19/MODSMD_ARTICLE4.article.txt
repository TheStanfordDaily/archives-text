# Hospital resumes shock therapy use
## 
### Robert Landon Staff writer 
After a 14-year hiatus, electro
shock therapy is back at Stanford.
However, officials at the Stan
ford Medical Center emphasized
that today's treatment is a far cry
from the kind that Jack Nicholson
is forced to undergo in the film
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest," a chilling portrayal of a
psychiatric patient given electros
hock therapy.
Electroshock therapy has made
a dramatic comeback nationwide
in the last five years on patients
suffering from severe forms of de
pression, and in an effort to keep
in step with current psychiatric
methodology doctors here have
begun using this technique.
The Medical Center's Psychia
tric Clinic will be expanding into
a fully-equipped psychiatric hospi
tal, according to psychiatrist Da
vid Spiegel, the clinic's director.
Spiegel said doctors want to have
a full range of psychiatric tech
niques available to them — in
cluding electroshock therapy —
when the hospital doors open.
Spiegel lamented that the po
tentially life-saving therapy has
been saddled with a name that
"sounds terrible" and has a long
history of abuse. The technique
has been renamed electroconvul
sive therapy, or ECT.
"It is definitely the most effec
tive form of treatment for depres
sion known to medicine," said psy
chiatrist Javaid Sheikh, the only
doctor at Stanford who is cur
rently using ECT on his patients.
The therapy has an 85 percent
success rate, according to Sheikh,
15 percent higher than the most

effective kinds of medication.
No one is sure exactly how ECT
works, but Sheikh likened it to
starting a car with jumper cables.
For about half a second, a mild
electrical current — about enough
to make a 100-watt bulb flicker
— is sent through the patient's
brain, causing nerves to fire
throughout the body. The process
is usually repeated three times a
week for a month.
"Somehow, it stimulates the
brain to make use of its own re
sources," Sheikh said.
At present, doctors still use
ECT only as last resort, when
patients fail to respond to medica
tion. Often, the patients are on
the brink of suicide.
Spiegel said a patient of his, a
single mother who had been so
depressed that she could "literally
not walk to the bathroom," is now
back at work and supporting her
children.
However, complications associ
ated with ECT still exist, espe
cially memory loss. Sheikh said
some patients suffer from "tran
sient memory difficulties for
several weeks after the treat
ment." According to a San Jose
Mercury News article on the
therapy, almost one-fourth of the
patients who received the therapy
in California last year complained
of such memory loss.
Sheikh emphasized that the
problems are usually temporary,
and said that persistent memory
loss is "very rare."
ECT has far fewer side-effects
than anti-depressant drugs,
Sheikh added, especially among
the elderly and the medically ill,
many of whom are too frail to
receive drug treatment.
Furthermore, recent improve
ments have done a lot to dispel
myths about the therapy.
First of all, patients are now
anesthetized before they undergo
treatment. Before anesthetization
was introduced, fully conscious
patients convulsed so wildly that
they actually fractured bones.
Second, patients must undergo
rigorous medical screening. Shock
therapy had been used indis
criminantly for all kinds of prob
lems, from psychosis to schizo
phrenia. Treatment is at present
limited almost exclusively to se
vere forms of depression.
Last, the machines are far more
sophisticated than when Ken
Kesey wrote "One Flew over the
Cuckoo's Nest," according to
Sheikh.
