# Introducing a split
## Lecturer's proposal would separate intro CS courses from department 
### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
Introductory computer classes
such as CS 1, 105 A and 106 A
should be moved out of the Com
puter Science Department and
into a new program in computing,
according to a proposal by Stuart
Reges, a highly regarded com
puter science educator at Stan
ford.
Reges said his proposal,
revealed to the Faculty Senate last
Thursday as part of a report by
Computer Science Chair Nils Nil
lson, would allow introductory CS
classes to obtain funding more
fairly and directly.
Currently, the introductory
classes are funded by the Com
puter Science Department, which
works through the School of En
gineering to obtain money from
the Provost's Office. The proposal
would allow the classes to bypass
the Computer Science Depart
ment.
Stressing that "the CS Depart
ment has been incredibly generous
(with funding), but there is no
other department that works this
way," Reges said he worried that
CS introductory programs would

suffer most if the department
were forced to cut spending.
Nillson, 1987-88 chair of the
Committee on Academic Comput
ing and Information Systems, said
he included Reges' ideas in his
annual report and mentioned
them in his senate speech so that
they would be considered by this
year's committee.
In an interview with The Daily,
Reges likened the distribution of
University money to a battle
where "resources trickle down de
pending on how strongly you
champion for your needs. . . .
Every department will fight for
its own majors, but it's difficult
for the Computer Science Depart
ment to champion introductory
computer students."
According to Reges. the diffi
culty is that beginning CS classes
are made up almost entirely of
non-majors. CS majors, he said,
tend to take 106 X.
Noting the new Cultures, Ideas
and Values course as an example
of how the computing program
might work, Reges suggested
giving the introductory computer
classes status as a separate pro
gram to give them a direct rep
resentative in the fight for funds.
CIV receives funding directly
from the School of Humanities
and Sciences instead of, for exam
ple, through the History Depart
ment.
In addition, Reges added, a new
program could have an curricu
lum advisory panel consisting of
faculty from a broad range of de
partments. The panel would be
valuable, he said, because classes
such as 105 A are taken almost

exclusively by humanities stu
dents.
Many lecturers in the introduc
tory classes already feel some dis
tance from the CS Department,
Reges said. "Our mission is dif
ferent from computer science's
mission. We're more like a West
ern Culture program ... a
freshman-sophomore program."
Reges explained that the intro
ductory CS classes, which have a
total enrollment of over 2,200 per
year, are providing services to the
entire academic community by
educating non-majors and fulfill
ing 80 to 90 percent of undergrad
uate Area 8 distribution require
ments.

Nillson said that his committee
was not able to spend a lot of
time on Reges's proposal, "but I
thought it was intriguing enough
an idea that it ought to be looked
at in some detail. ... I didn't want
a potentially good idea to be for
gotten about."
Prof. Richard Schupbach, Slavic
Department chair, who will lead
this year's C-ACIS committee,
said he was not present at the
last senate meeting and did not
know about the proposal. The new
committee would be "happy to
take a look at it,"he said.
Provost James Rosse was un
available for comment on the pro
posal.
