# Introducing a split
## Lecturer's proposal would separate intro CS courses from department

Introductory computer classes
such as CS 1, 105 A and 106 A
should be moved out of the Com
puter Science Department and
into a new program in computing,
according to a proposal by Stuart
Reges, a highly regarded com
puter science educator at Stan
ford.
Reges said his proposal,
revealed to the Faculty Senate last
Thursday as part of a report by
Computer Science Chair Nils Nil
lson, would allow introductory CS
classes to obtain funding more
fairly and directly.
Currently, the introductory
classes are funded by the Com
puter Science Department, which
works through the School of En
gineering to obtain money from
the Provost's Office. The proposal
would allow the classes to bypass
the Computer Science Depart
ment.
Stressing that "the CS Depart
ment has been incredibly generous
(with funding), but there is no
other department that works this
way," Reges said he worried that
CS introductory programs would

suffer most if the department
were forced to cut spending.
Nillson, 1987-88 chair of the
Committee on Academic Comput
ing and Information Systems, said
he included Reges' ideas in his
annual report and mentioned
them in his senate speech so that
they would be considered by this
year's committee.
In an interview with The Daily,
Reges likened the distribution of
University money to a battle
where "resources trickle down de
pending on how strongly you
champion for your needs. . . .
Every department will fight for
its own majors, but it's difficult
for the Computer Science Depart
ment to champion introductory
computer students."
According to Reges. the diffi
culty is that beginning CS classes
are made up almost entirely of
non-majors. CS majors, he said,
tend to take 106 X.
Noting the new Cultures, Ideas
and Values course as an example
of how the computing program
might work, Reges suggested
giving the introductory computer
classes status as a separate pro
