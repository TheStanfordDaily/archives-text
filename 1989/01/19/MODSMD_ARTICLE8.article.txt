# Civil rights or civil wrongs?
## Panelists debate the record of Reagan Administration Panelists debate the record of Reagan Administration 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Although the evening had been hilled aa
a debate on the Reagan civil rights record,
the far-reaching panel discussion Tuesday
night more closely resembled what Dan
Rather would term a "joint appearance."
The two sides of the four-member panel,
which consisted of Political Science lecturer
.James Steyer and three other public policy
experts, articulated two fundamentally dif
ferent approaches to civil rights policy based
upon disparate interpretations of "equal
opportunity." Despite detailed argumenta
tion from both sides, the different ap
proaches all but undermined the possibility
for confrontational exchange.
Advocates of the Reagan record argued
that policies of preference based on skin
color — such as affirmative action — are
an abandonment of the principle of judg
ment based on individual merit.
Critics of the Reagan Administration,
however, said that debating the equity of
affirmative action is of secondary concern
because it fails to address the "fundamental
root " of civil rights policy. Policy must en
tail increased investment in the futures of
economically disadvantaged children, the

critics argued.
The panel discussion, which was
moderated by KRON-TV City Hall reporter
Belva Davis, was sponsored by Stanford
in-Government.
Steyer, who sported a T-shirt proclaiming
his "card-carrying" ACLU membership,
said that due to "callous and insensitive"
policies during the past eight years, one
fourth of the nations' children live in
poverty.
"How can we talk about equal opportu
nity, about jobs and affirmative action . . .
to a child who is homeless, without health
care, eats one meal per day, who needs
special education . . . and can't afford
that?" Steyer asked the crowd of about
300 in Annenberg Auditorium.
John Trasvina, the counsel to the U.S.
Judiciary Committee on the Constitution,
also sided with Steyer in attacking the
Reagan record, saying it was "one of talking
and not acting."

be determined by whether "we
proceed down the road of equal
opportunity and color blindness
or down the alternative road of
equal results and color conscious
ness."
Clint Bolick, the director of the
Landmark Center for Civil Rights
in Washington and former assis
tant to U.S. Assistant Attorney
General for Civil Rights William
Bradford, also defended Reagan's
policies.
"What really irks those who are
critical of the Reagan Administra
tion," Bolick said, "is that the
Reagan Administration has re
turned to the true principles of
civil rights that animated every
great civil rights leader."

rent efforts of civil rights activists,
Markman said that during the
past few years there had been an
"enormous proliferation of the
number of individuals entitled to
civil rights protection."
"In addition to the traditional
categories of race, color, religion
and natural origin, a bewildering
array of new categories have been
brought under federal and state
civil rights umbrellas," Markman
said.
According to Markman, these

new categories include "sex, phys
ical handicap, mental handicap,
sexual preference, age, marital
status, poverty, illegitimacy,
source of income, citizenship,
height, weight, personal appear
ance, pregnancy and whether or
not one has an arrest or convic
tion record."
Because we have "a limited
pie," Markman said, the increase
in protected minority groups has
led to more friction in the country.
Trasvina disagreed, asserting
that, in the area of civil rights,
the past eight years had been "a
campaign to turn back the clock."
Trasvina said that, contrary to
Bush's patriotic campaign rheto
ric, "we have moved away from
the one nation with liberty and
justice for all." This retreat, he
said, "is the greatest failing of
this administration's civil rights
record."
