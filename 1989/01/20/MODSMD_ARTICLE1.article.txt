# Hoopla surrounds presidential inauguration

WASHINGTON - George
Bush is appealing to the American
people "to pitch in and help" as
he launches his presidency today
in a solemn Capitol ceremony as
old as the nation he will serve.
On the eve of his swearing-in
as president, Bush said he plans
no instant domestic initiatives —
no "first 100 days" — and isn't
ready to entertain a new East-
West summit or arms talks pend
ing a reassessment of superpower
relations.
Bush said his inaugural ad
dress, after taking the presidential
oath at noon EST today, would
be "a broad appeal to the Amer
ican people to pitch in and help,"
but without many specific calls to
action.
"It will be an expression of sat
isfaction about how far we've
come as a nation, and a recogni
tion that we've got a long way to
go," the president-elect said in an
interview.
At the same time, he called the
concept of a busy "first 100 days"
initiative with Congress one "that

doesn't really apply" to a sitting
vice president elected to the
presidency.
Bush spent much of the day out
of the public eye, rehearsing the
inaugural speech and preparing
for a last, sentimental visit to
President Reagan as underling.
Their Thursday meetings have
been a weekly habit for eight
years.
Barbara Bush and Vice
President-elect Dan Quayle,
meanwhile, took their special
turns in the inaugural spotlight
before joining their spouses and
12,000 other black-tie revelers for
a $9 million entertainment gala,
televised live.
Bush was upbeat on the day
before his installation into the re
sponsibilities of office.
"I really feel this," he said. "Our
best days are yet to come."
Bush's mood was matched by
Washington's glorious weather.
Inaugural celebrants strolled to
and fro without topcoats in the
balmy-for-January predicted for
today, when Bush takes the oath

and more than 10,000 performers
join his parade to the White
House.
Four years ago, the weather was
so harsh that Reagan had to be
sworn in indoors and his inaugu
ration parade was cancelled.
Bush also said he is not ready
to entertain the idea of meeting
this year with Soviet leader Mik
hail Gorbachev, and"I don't think
we know yet" when U.S. negoti
ators will be prepared to resume
strategic arms reduction talks,
once set for Feb. 15.
"I think the Soviets understand
that my intention is not to drag
my feet, but to simply do a pru
dent reassessment," Bush said. "I
don't think progress should be
measured solely on whether
there's a summit meeting."
The outgoing chief executive
spent his last full day in office
saying goodbyes. Meeting
reporters, he discussed a somber
aspect of his presidency — his
failure to win the release of nine
Americans held hostage in
Lebanon.
