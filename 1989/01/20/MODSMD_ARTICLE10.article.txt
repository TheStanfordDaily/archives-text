# Educational voucher system debated
## 
### Raoul Mowatt 
In advance of today's inauguration
of George Bush, the self-proclaimed
"Education President," two prominent
educators Wednesday debated a key
educational issue — the development
of a voucher system in the U.S sec
ondary school system.
Based on a free market scheme, a
voucher plan would theoretically
enable dissatisfied parents to re-enroll
their children in better schools. Ac
cording to advocates, schools would
thereby become more responsive to
the needs of the community.
Before an audience of more than
150 in Bishop Auditorium, UC-
Berkeley Law School Prof. John Coons
argued that the voucher system would
raise the quality of education for all
students, both rich and poor. However,
Albert Shanker, president of the
American Federation of Teachers, cau
tioned that vouchers directly attack
the traditional philosophy behind ed
ucation.

Framing the terms of the debate,
Coons said, "The question is not how
we reform public education, but how
can we create it."
One benefit of the voucher system,
according to Coons, is that it will lead
to more parity between rich and poor.
Instead of being limited to a school
based on location, lower class families
could choose the best school for their
children. In addition, the plan would
set aside a number of spots in par
ticipating schools for low-income stu
dents.
Vouchers could spark greater aca
demic success for the pupils who take
advantage of them, Coons said. Under
a voucher plan, a community could
afford to set up specialty schools where
students could take advantage of di
verse fields. Furthermore, the plan
would enable the construction of
schools for migrant workers, and a
daycare system-
By contrast, Shanker contended
that a voucher system is unworkable.
The plan would not only destroy the

idea of the common school and en
courage sectarianism but would ad
versely affect impoverished families
in the interest of richer ones, he said.
It would reward those already suc
cessful in the public school system,
while punishing the 5 percent of the
national student body who are most
in need of reform, Shanker said.
Shanker also stressed that public
schools have had a good deal of suc
cess, and often deserve as much re
spect as the country's private schools.
Shanker quipped, "Private schools
are better in certain respects in the
same way as those hospitals that don't
take really sick patients. They look
pretty good. Not too many people die
if you don't take sick people into your
hospital."
It seems that Shanker's argument
was more effective. According to polls
conducted before and after the debate,
33 percent of the audience was against
the voucher system when they entered
the debate, while 66 percent left op
posing it.
