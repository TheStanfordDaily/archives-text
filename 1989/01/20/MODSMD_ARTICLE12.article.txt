# Speakers emphasize U.S. role in bringing peace to Israel

Both Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization must try to involve the
United States in Middle East peace efforts
if peace is to be attained, an expert on the
volatile region told a campus audience yes
terday.
Speaking at a packed Bechtel Interna
tional Center, Allan Solomonow said that
peace was necessary for Israeli prosperity
and that it hinged on the creation of an
independent Palestinian state. Solomonow
is the Middle East program director of the
American Friends and Service committee
of Northern California, and a lecturer in
Peace and Conflict at UC-Berkeley.
Peace between Palestine and Israel is
not around the corner, Solomonow said,
but the United States can bring it about
through open negotiations between the
PLO and Israel.
"The American government can bring a
comprehensive peace process to fruition,"
he said. "The U.S. ought to be a place

where we can talk about world peace."
Doing nothing, he said, is tantamount to
taking a stand against peace.
Solomonow proposed bringing Palestin
ian and Israeli leaders to meet in the United
States instead of Switzerland.
By and large, Solomonow was impartial
in his analysis. He suggested that Israel
could solve its internal problems, and at
the same time establish a model for Pal
estinian relations, by working harder to
socially integrate European and non-
European Jews in its own society.
"The best way to get two people to live
together is in a state of equality,"
Solomonow said. "There can not be equality
within two separate states if it does not
exist in one state."
Solomonow also stressed that citizens
themselves, especially U.S. citizens, should
speak up about the Middle East conflict.
Some liberal communities, including the
American Jewish community, do not say
enough publicly, he said, adding that these
voices could influence governments.
