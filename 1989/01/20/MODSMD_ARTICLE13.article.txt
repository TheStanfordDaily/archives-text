## Bush's 'wicked wit' charms supporters 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Bar
bara Bush, displaying the "wicked
wit" that has become her
trademark, was cheered by thou
sands of supporters yesterday as
she poked fun at her appearance,
joked about her husband's fishing
and bragged about her family.
Bush, a 63-year-old grand
mother with snow white hair and
an imposing figure, appeared at
the "Salute to the First Lady,"
an event that more than 6,000
people paid $50 a ticket to attend.
The gathering, held at the John
F. Kennedy Center for the Per
forming Arts, drew so many
people that Bush and Marilyn
Quayle, the wife of Vice President
elect Dan Quayle, appeared before
audiences in the concert hall, the
opera hall and the theater.
"Speaking of glamor, I want you
to look at me very carefully," said
Mrs. Bush, who often indulges in
self-deprecating remarks.
As the crowd roared, Mrs. Bush
stood on the stage and pointed to
herself: "Please notice the hair,
the makeup, designer clothes. . . .
I want you to watch me all week
and remember — You may never
see it again."
Bush, wearing a blue suit —
her favorite color — with a large
patterned bow at her neck, called
the tribute "unbelievable" and
"undeserved."
The blunt-spoken Bush, known
for her candor and lack of
pretense, also poked fun at her

husband's complaints this week
that packing for the move to the
White House was a laborious and
tedious process.
Noting that Bush spent last
weekend fishing in Florida, his
wife of 43 years said: "So much
to the packing story."
Bush, who is fiercely loyal to
her husband and five children and
their families, later said she con
sidered herself the "world's luck
iest woman" because she had
married "a man I love more than
life."
Actors Bruce Boxleitner and
Charlton Heston and actress
Cheryl Ladd read virtually identi
cal scripts as they introduced
Bush to successive audiences.
They described her as "kind, gen
erous, warm and dedicated," with
values that are similar to those
held by most Americans.
Quayle, in presenting Bush to
the audiences, had a difficult time
controlling her emotions. "I'm
going to get weepy because Bar
bara is so special," said the wife
of the vice president-elect, a
lawyer with three children.
"Barbara Bush brings joy, a
wicked wit.. . and an indomitable
spirit that she will take to the
White House," Quayle said.
At each hall, Bush was enter
tained by performers ranging
from the National Symphony Or
chestra to the Preservation Hall
Jazz Band to the Gatlin Brothers.
