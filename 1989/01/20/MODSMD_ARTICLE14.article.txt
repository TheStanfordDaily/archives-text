Reagan pardons Steinbrenner
WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Reagan has
pardoned George Steinbrenner, the fiery owner
of the New York Yankees major league baseball
franchise who was fined $15,000 for campaign
law violations, a senior White House official said
yesterday.
The official, discussing a series of Reagan par
dons on grounds he not be identified publicly,
said that Steinbrenner's pardon was among 10
the president approved on Tuesday and Wednes
day.
The official would not speculate on whether
Reagan would grant any more pardons before
ceding the presidency to George Bush today.
Steinbrenner was the only well-known benefi
ciary of the Reagan pardons, the other nine men
having been convicted of violations ranging from
illegal possession of firearms and income tax
evasion to concealing non tax-paid whisky.
There was no word on whether Reagan was
still mulling pardons for two others whose cases
have been well-publicized — newspaper heiress
Patty Hearst Shaw and millionaire industrialist
Armand Hammer.
Shining Path attempts blackout
LIMA, Peru (AP) — Shining Path guerrillas
tried to black out the capital, and police killed
two rebels who attacked a patrol car yesterday,
officials said.
The violence came during an industrial "armed
strike" called by the Maoist rebels but ignored
by workers, officials reported.

Members of the guerrilla group blew down
three power pylons on Lima's outskirts late Wed
nesday night, causing a momentary flicker of
lights in some districts of the capital, police said.
They said the sabotage was in support of the
"armed strike," a term used by the Shining Path
to imply violence against anyone refusing to take
part.
At about dawn yesterday, guerrillas attacked
a patrol car in an industrial sector, wounding a
policeman. The officer's companions returned
fire, killing two of the attackers, and police rein
forcements arrested 15 suspects, authorities re
ported.
D.C. mayor linked to drug dealer
WASHINGTON (AP) — Mayor Marion Barry
appeared under subpoena yesterday before a
federal grand jury investigating his ties to a
suspected drug dealer. Barry told reporters he
had done nothing wrong and was not the target
of the probe.
"I'm not in trouble," Barry said at an im
promptu news conference as he headed into the
grand jury's meeting room in the federal court
house. "The public sometimes has the impression
that going before a grand jury means that some
one is guilty . . . but it only means they are
investigating. That's the American way."
Barry met with the grand jury for about three
hours. He said little to reporters afterward.
Kenneth Mundy, Barry's attorney, said he has
received assurances that Barry is not a target
of the probe. Federal officials were not available
to comment on Mundy's comment.
