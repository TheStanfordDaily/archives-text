BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP)
â€” Yugoslavia chose a new premier
yesterday who believes a combi
nation of market-oriented reform
and political change is the answer
to the economic and social crisis.
The collective presidency's
choice of Ante Markovic was a
clear victory for liberal, refomist
elements of the ruling Communist
Party over the conservative, dog
matic faction.
It also was seen as a rebuke to
Slobodan Milosevic, Communist
Party chief of Serbia, Yugoslavia's
largest republic, who had put up
a Serbian candidate in competi
tion.
Markovic, whose appointment
must be approved by Parliament,
is a 64-year-old electrical engineer
and member of the national
party's policy-making Central
Committee.
The nine-member presidency
told Markovic to start forming a
Cabinet "as soon as possible," the
official news agency Tanjug re
ported.
He will succeed Branko Mikulic,
whose government resigned Dec.
30 because it could not solve such
economic problems as high unem
ployment, annual inflation of 250
percent, and a $21 billion foreign
debt.
A decline in the living standard
to half what it was when President
Tito died in 1980 has caused wide
spread discontent among workers.

A record 1,400 strikes were re
ported last year.
Mikulic's was the first national
government to step down since
Tito and the Communists gained
power after World War 11.
Tanjug did not give a vote count
among the nine members of the
presidency in the contest between
Mikulic and Serbian candidate
Borisav Jovic, a close associate of
Milosevic.
The new premier has long ad
vocated simultaneous economic
and political reform in Yugoslavia,
a federation of six diverse
republics. He had the strong sup
port of Croatia and Slovenia, the
most economically advanced and
Westward-looking regions.
Reforms Mikulic initiated late
last year, which Markovic is ex
pected to implement, allow more
investment of domestic and
foreign private capital, sale of
stocks and bonds and changes in
the banking system along Western
lines.
Milosevic appeared defiant yes
terday when he spoke at a party
conference in the province of Voj
vodina, defending recent mass
rallies in Serbia widely believed
to have been organized by his own
supporters.
The protests strained the na
tion's fragile ethnic balance for
six months and led to the ouster
of many opponents of the Serbian
party chief.
