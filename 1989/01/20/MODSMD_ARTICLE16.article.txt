# Miami takes inventory of riot damage
## 
### 
MIAMI (AP) — Violence in
black neighborhoods ebbed yester
day as officials estimated riot
damage to buildings at less than
$1 million and the community
began examining the underlying
causes of the uprising.
The rage touched off by a
Hispanic police officer's shooting
of an unarmed black motorcyclist
Monday left one man dead, seven
others shot and some 370 people
jailed — most of them suspected
looters under 18, police said.
Police continued to control
access to the largely black Over
town area yesterday, but inside
the neighborhood, businesses
lifted their shutters, children at
tended school and youths played
pick-up basketball.
Police spokesman Angelo Bitsis
said late in the afternoon that
Miami's Overtown and Liberty
City were "extremely quiet." "We
haven't had a single incident of
any kind since long before
daybreak," Bitsis said.
A Miami Heat basketball game
was canceled Tuesday night, but
a game was on for yesterday in
the Miami Arena at the edge of
Overtown.
"Apparently the city has re

turned to calm, and we're very
grateful for that," said police
spokesman Ray Lang. "We're
grateful that the focus has re
turned to the Super Bowl."
But he said police were
prepared to return in force if trou
ble began again.
Damage in the Overtown and
Liberty City areas was less than

officials first feared, said Fire De
partment spokeswoman Christy
LeMay.
The physical damage will be
easier to repair than the damage
done to race relations, many
blacks say.
"Fear is what we all have in
common now," said Overtown res
ident Stephen Wayne.
