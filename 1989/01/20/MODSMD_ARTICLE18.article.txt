## Dear President Bush: 
### 
It's time to make good
on your promise of a
'kinder, gentler nation'

BY EMBRACING Martin Lu
ther King Jr.'s vision last
week, you demonstrated a
commitment to civil rights. Your
promise to follow King's example
sharply contrasts with your
predecessor's mistrust of today's
civil rights leaders.
Now, on your Inauguration Day,
it is time to back up your words
with tangible policy changes. Reach
out to all Americans and build on
your theme of creating "a kinder,
gentler nation."
Clearly, your most important do
mestic priority is to reduce the na
tional deficit, which mortgages our
future in favor of consumption
today. It also chokes growth and
contributes to the massive trade
deficit, which in turn increases de
mands for protectionism, a threat
to world economic growth.
Despite your campaign promises,
you must face the fact that some
taxes must be raised to help deal
with the deficit. If it must be in
come tax, then the tax bracket for
those making over $100,000 should
be raised above the current 28 per
cent, to shift the burden away from
the poor.
What poor, you ask? Throughout
your campaign, you emphasized
that 17 million new jobs were
created under the Reagan-Bush
Administration. Now that you are
president, you must admit that
most of those are low-paying serv
ice jobs.
So many of our young people
slip out of the system, using drugs
and dropping out of school creating
a society of haves and have nots
while at the same time making it
more difficult for business and gov

ernment.
Live up to your promise to be
the "Education President." It is a
trite but true saying that education
is the nation's future. In an in
creasingly competitive world eco
nomy, the nation needs an ed
ucated workforce to maintain its
prosperity. However, significant so
cial legislation cannot occur until
you solve the budget deficit.
You should also follow the ex
ample of Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev. Faced with a pre
carious economic situation, Gorba
chev is cutting back on the Soviet
defense budget by more than 14
percent. During his December
speech to the United Nations, Gor
bachev announced plans for a uni
lateral cut of 500,000 troops and
10,000 tanks from Eastern Europe.
These and other cutbacks may save
the Soviet Union as much as $4.8
billion.
While recognizing the need to
maintain a strong defense and to
ensure nuclear deterrence that has
maintained the peace for over 40
years, we question the massive ex
penditures on the Stragic Defense
Initiative and the need for the $500
million dollar-a-plane Stealth
fighter.
The world order is shifting. Our
percentage of world Gross National
Product continues to decline, but
still we shoulder the burden of
"defending the free world." Coun
tries like Japan have a booming
GNP, yet the United States is still
practically the sole defender of the
West.
While it may be unfeasible for
Japan to increase its defense
budget, you ought to urge the
Japanese to begin shouldering a
greater obligation in the Third
World.
Gorbachev challenges the United
States to follow the Soviet lead.
Don't let him down.
Good luck, President Bush,
you'll need it.
