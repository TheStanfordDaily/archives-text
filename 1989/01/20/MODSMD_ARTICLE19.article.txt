Committee calls
for withdrawal,
not divestment
CONTRARY TO the information
presented in a letter to the
editor which appeared in last
week's Campus Report and Stanford
Daily, the Commission on Investment
Responsibility has not recommended to
the Trustees that Stanford adopt a
policy of total divestment.
For the last two years, the CIR has
persuasively (and successfully) argued
for more stringent guidelines for Stan
ford's selective divestment policy as it
pertains to portfolio companies with
operations in South Africa. However,
the CIR has urged the Trustees to
adopt a policy of total disinvestment.
Quite possibly, the confusion may
have resulted because of the similarity
of two terms — divestment and disin
vestment — which have very different
meanings.
Divestment refers to the complete
sale by institutions like Stanford of
stock in a corporation. Disinvestment is
the sale of a company's assets in
South Africa (also referred to as with
drawal),
The 1987-88 CIR urged the Univer
sity to develop a general policy of
voting in favor of all shareholder
resolutions requesting to disinvest from
South Africa. The CIR's rationale for
developing such a policy was outlined
in its Jan. 29, 1988 disinvestment
recommendation to the Trustees:
Despite corporate pressure, the pace
for future progress in South Africa has
slowed. Recent events clearly demon
strate the South African government's
intolerence to any serious efforts to
combat apartheid from within that
country.
Although international pressure,
including disinvestment, will not di-

rectly lead the South African govern
ment toward ending apartheid, interna
tional pressure will encourage groups
within South Africa, white and black,
to work against apartheid.
Among other things, we recommend
that disinvesting companies implement
the following measures to achieve the
maximum impact on apartheid: work
with other companies to disinvest
together as a dramatic collective action
against apartheid; issue a strong public
statement declaring that abhorrence of
apartheid is the prime reason for
disinvestment and that the company
looks forward to returning to a post
apartheid South Africa; and, follow a
process of advance notification and
negotiation with the local black unions
and the prospective new owner in
order to protect the jobs for their
black employees.
Although it will be a long process,
measures such as disinvestment provide
the only realistic approach of ending
apartheid for the approximately 29
million blacks in South Africa.

I would like to clarify some poten
tially misleading aspects of The Daily's
Jan. 11 article, "Student interaction
with professors grows under pro
grams."
The quotes attributed to me made it
sound as though I were critical of the
fact that Stanford is a research univer
sity, that I regarded it as a problem I
had to fight.
Quite the contrary, the distinction of
Stanford's research activities is one of
the principal assets of the University,
one that I value greatly. A problem

arises only when research is put into
competition with teaching. Under these
circumstances, the time faculty mem
bers put into research takes them away
from the students, to the detriment of
undergraduate education.
A number of programs have been
established at Stanford to foster the
integration of teaching and research,
and increasing numbers of undergradu
ates are becoming involved in them.
The Daily's article gave excellent
examples from one such program, the
Undergraduate Scholars Program. The
recognition it gave to the extraordinary
work of Kennell Jackson, the organizer
of the program, and John Rickford,
one of its participating faculty mem
bers, is richly deserved.
Unfortunately, the article may have
left readers with the false impression
that the scholars program is the only
program at Stanford bringing students
and faculty together on research proj
ects. In fact, there are a number of
others.
The most obvious is the Undergradu
ate Research Opportunities program,
directed by Laura Selznick and located
in Sweet Hall. Last year, this office
awarded a total of 145 grants to help
support student research projects.
The University's commitment to
URO is evident from the designation of
undergraduate research as a high prio
rity in the centennial campaign.
Additional opportunities are available
for undergraduates to become involved
with faculty members in research proj
ects over the summer, including pro
grams in the School of Engineering,
the Department of Anthropology and
the programs in international relations
and Latin American studies.
In short, it is one of Stanford's real
strengths that we offer undergraduates
a variety of ways to take advantage of
our distinction as a research university
in enriching their educational experi
ences.

The Daily's sense
of humor doesn't
amuse its readers
We were surprised and somewhat
concerned by your article "Lachenauer
puts lock on Editor" in Wednesday's
Daily.
Although we understand that the
tone and import of the article was
intended to be facetious, we feel that
The Daily, by printing this article,
demonstrated poor taste and has
sacrificed some of the standards of a
serious publication.
We find the article not only sexist
but also insulting to specific staff
members as well as readers.
First, the section on Lachenauer's
deactivation from the Tri Delta
Sorority suggests not only a stereotype
of sorority women, but recalls a sup
posedly outdated conception of women
as people who should not be taken
seriously.
This, coupled with the joke about
wearing edible underwear in order to
attract the attention of her dentist,
plays upon some of the most harmful
stereotypes of the female and feminine
sexual roles in our society.
To add insult to ir\jury, the article
continues with the implication that
Lachenauer, in order to overcome her
"negatives" — sorority participation,
the dentist scandal, "hysterical" gig
gling and a "whiny voice" — was com
pelled to give "backrubs and who
knows what other favors" to secure
her position of editor.
Clearly this article insinuates that in
order for a woman to gain a position
of responsibility and power, she must
resort to such tactics.
Perhaps the most telling and alarm
ing feature of the article is that Lac

Committee calls
for withdrawal,
not divestment
CONTRARY TO the information
presented in a letter to the
editor which appeared in last
week's Campus Report and Stanford
Daily, the Commission on Investment
Responsibility has not recommended to
the Trustees that Stanford adopt a
policy of total divestment.
For the last two years, the CIR has
persuasively (and successfully) argued
for more stringent guidelines for Stan
ford's selective divestment policy as it
pertains to portfolio companies with
operations in South Africa. However,
the CIR has urged the Trustees to
adopt a policy of total disinvestment.
Quite possibly, the confusion may
have resulted because of the similarity
of two terms — divestment and disin
vestment — which have very different
meanings.
Divestment refers to the complete
sale by institutions like Stanford of
stock in a corporation. Disinvestment is
the sale of a company's assets in
South Africa (also referred to as with
drawal),
The 1987-88 CIR urged the Univer
sity to develop a general policy of
voting in favor of all shareholder
resolutions requesting to disinvest from
South Africa. The CIR's rationale for
developing such a policy was outlined
in its Jan. 29, 1988 disinvestment
recommendation to the Trustees:
Despite corporate pressure, the pace
for future progress in South Africa has
slowed. Recent events clearly demon
strate the South African government's
intolerence to any serious efforts to
combat apartheid from within that
country.
Although international pressure,
including disinvestment, will not di-

rectly lead the South African govern
ment toward ending apartheid, interna
tional pressure will encourage groups
within South Africa, white and black,
to work against apartheid.
Among other things, we recommend
that disinvesting companies implement
the following measures to achieve the
maximum impact on apartheid: work
with other companies to disinvest
together as a dramatic collective action
against apartheid; issue a strong public
statement declaring that abhorrence of
apartheid is the prime reason for
disinvestment and that the company
looks forward to returning to a post
apartheid South Africa; and, follow a
process of advance notification and
negotiation with the local black unions
and the prospective new owner in
order to protect the jobs for their
black employees.
Although it will be a long process,
measures such as disinvestment provide
the only realistic approach of ending
apartheid for the approximately 29
million blacks in South Africa.

University offers

I would like to clarify some poten
tially misleading aspects of The Daily's
Jan. 11 article, "Student interaction
with professors grows under pro
grams."
The quotes attributed to me made it
sound as though I were critical of the
fact that Stanford is a research univer
sity, that I regarded it as a problem I
had to fight.
Quite the contrary, the distinction of
Stanford's research activities is one of
the principal assets of the University,
one that I value greatly. A problem

arises only when research is put into
competition with teaching. Under these
circumstances, the time faculty mem
bers put into research takes them away
from the students, to the detriment of
undergraduate education.
A number of programs have been
established at Stanford to foster the
integration of teaching and research,
and increasing numbers of undergradu
ates are becoming involved in them.
The Daily's article gave excellent
examples from one such program, the
Undergraduate Scholars Program. The
recognition it gave to the extraordinary
work of Kennell Jackson, the organizer
of the program, and John Rickford,
one of its participating faculty mem
bers, is richly deserved.
Unfortunately, the article may have
left readers with the false impression
that the scholars program is the only
program at Stanford bringing students
and faculty together on research proj
ects. In fact, there are a number of
others.
The most obvious is the Undergradu
ate Research Opportunities program,
directed by Laura Selznick and located
in Sweet Hall. Last year, this office
awarded a total of 145 grants to help
support student research projects.
The University's commitment to
URO is evident from the designation of
undergraduate research as a high prio
rity in the centennial campaign.
Additional opportunities are available
for undergraduates to become involved
with faculty members in research proj
ects over the summer, including pro
grams in the School of Engineering,
the Department of Anthropology and
the programs in international relations
and Latin American studies.
In short, it is one of Stanford's real
strengths that we offer undergraduates
a variety of ways to take advantage of
our distinction as a research university
in enriching their educational experi
ences.

The Daily's sense
of humor doesn't
amuse its readers
We were surprised and somewhat
concerned by your article "Lachenauer
puts lock on Editor" in Wednesday's
Daily.
Although we understand that the
tone and import of the article was
intended to be facetious, we feel that
The Daily, by printing this article,
demonstrated poor taste and has
sacrificed some of the standards of a
serious publication.
We find the article not only sexist
but also insulting to specific staff
members as well as readers.
First, the section on Lachenauer's
deactivation from the Tri Delta
Sorority suggests not only a stereotype
of sorority women, but recalls a sup
posedly outdated conception of women
as people who should not be taken
seriously.
This, coupled with the joke about
wearing edible underwear in order to
attract the attention of her dentist,
plays upon some of the most harmful
stereotypes of the female and feminine
sexual roles in our society.
To add insult to ir\jury, the article
continues with the implication that
Lachenauer, in order to overcome her
"negatives" — sorority participation,
the dentist scandal, "hysterical" gig
gling and a "whiny voice" — was com
pelled to give "backrubs and who
knows what other favors" to secure
her position of editor.
Clearly this article insinuates that in
order for a woman to gain a position
of responsibility and power, she must
resort to such tactics.
