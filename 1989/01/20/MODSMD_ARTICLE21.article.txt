## Look behind your nose 
### 
IN HONOR OF the upcoming You
Can Make a Difference Conference,
I'm yielding my stage to Walt Kelly,
author of the comic strip "Pogo" until
his death in 1973. He wrote better than
could I on the source of both the envi
ronment's woe and its cure:
"For perhaps 50,000 years man has
probably spent a good deal of his waking
time wondering what, where, how and
who was the enemy. It is a befuddling
experience, according to one expert,
namely me. And a completely unnecesary
one. The real enemy is always close at
hand. Not under your nose, to be sure,
but behind it.
"It is, admittedly, hard to find anybody
back there (for the owner of the nose,
that is), a condition that has led to lots
of worry on the part of our youth, to
say nothing of the adults. . . .
"Hold yourself at arm's length and ex
amine closely what you see. Who is the
one who loses your car keys, forgets to
pay the crucial bill, scatters your socks
beneath the bed, spills the red wine on
the prized tablecloth?
"You can blame it on the dog, if you
have one, or on your wife or husband,
if you have either half of the set. It is
easy to blame anything on someone else.
The world is an available scapegoat. But
when you have time, go to a phone booth,
call up a stranger, at random, and con
fess. You did it all.
"The youth of our land of other lands
have in the past few years discovered
pollution. Some cynics sneer that it is
because the youth is so close to pollution.
But these again young have at least come

around to the knowledge that most litter,
which is the basic form of pollution,
caused by the human race, of which,
presumably, we are all members.
"It is a provable fact that the fatality
rate is remarkably low for the sensible
individual who puts the empty cigarette
or candy container into his pocket when
he can't find a trash barrel. It is com
paratively harmless to walk home with
a pocketful of silver foil, cardboard and
odd bits of string. Good American type
boys spent much of their childhood doing
just that, and the cargo very often in
cluded a more or less live frog.
"In the time of Joseph McCarthyism,
celebrated in the "Pogo" strip by a char
acter named Simple J. Malarkey, I at
tempted to explain each individual is
wholly involved in the democratic proces,
work at it or not. The results of the
process fall on the head of the public
and he who is recalcitrant or procras
tinates in raising his voice can blame no
one but himself.
"An introduction to "Pogo Papers". ..
said in part:
"Specializations and markings of indi
viduals everywhere abound in such profu
sion that megor idiosyncrasies can be
properly ascribed to the mass. Traces of
nobility, gentleness and courage persist
in all people, do what we will to stamp
out the trend.
"So, too, do those characterisitics which
are ugly. It is just unfortunate that in
the clumsy hands of the cartoonist all
traits become ridiculous . . .
"Resolve, then, that on this very
ground, with small flags waving and tiny

blasts of tiny trumpets, we whaJl meet
the enemy and not only may he be ours,
he may be us.'
"As years passed the final paragraph
was reduced to 'We have met the enemy,
and he is us,' in a few strips having to
do with pollution.. .. The young picked
up the slogan to encourage efforts to
improve the environment and save the
ecology.
"Its truth seems to be apparent. The
contaminators of our earth start
little and end big. In not caring about
their fellows they begin by leaving banana
peels on the sidewalk, then they dump
industrial waste where they choose.
"The rest of us are working our way
up with chewing gum, cans, bottles and
cigar butts, training to be big polluters
perhaps. We can all slip on the banana
peels we have lightheartedly discarded.
The job of cleaning up the mess starts
just behind the nose."
