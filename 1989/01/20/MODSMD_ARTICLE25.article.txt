## Preserving King's synthesis of words and actions MLK Papers Project shapes a history 
### Jamie Green 
"Imagine that you have a hand in
preserving history," says Stanford Law
School graduate Rachel Bagby, who is the
associate director of the Martin Luther
King Jr. Papers Project here at Stanford.
"It's an incredible job."
The documentary editing project was
begun in Atlanta in 1984 by the Martin
Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent
Social Change and is only the third major
documentary project ever undertaken on
the life of a black American.
Over the next 15 years, the project will
assemble a 12-volume scholarly edition
of the speeches, sermons, correspondence
and other writings of King.
Stanford became associated with the
project when Coretta Scott King, presi
dent of the King Center, chose Associate
Professor of History Clayborne Carson
to be the senior editor and director of
the project in 1985.
Some people have asked why Stanford
was chosen to be the location of the proj
ect rather than a black university. Carson
is the answer, according to Bagby.
Carson brings to the project not only
his scholarly expertise, but also his knowl
edge of innovative applications of com
puters for academic purposes.
The volumes will be published in print,
but according to Carson, the project is
hoping to produce an electronic version
of the papers as well.
This method of recording history, ac
cording to Carson, will be the most ef
fective way of making the entire body of
information available to scholars. It will
make available not just the printed ver
sion of the documents, but the entire

research database.
The electronic version will allow stu
dents to look at original documents —
not just transcripts — on the computer
screen, Bagby explains.
The project is also unique in its use
of tape recordings and film footage, re
sources only recently available to most
editors of historical material.
The first printed volume of the project
will be ready for publication in 1990.
This volume will show how King's family
background helped shape his intellectual
development and will include his early
writings as a student.
The rest of the volumes will come out
in chronological order at the rate of one
per year. They will not only make an
important contribution to an understand
ing of King's intellectual development,
but will also shed new light on the origins
and the development of the civil rights
movement.
Many students now work on the proj
ect, usually transcribing documents.
Jennifer Freudenberg, a junior working
on the project says, "It's fun looking at
documents from his [King's! notices of
overdue library books, to the letters he
received, to his powerful speeches."
Andrew Patzman, a 1988 Stanford
graduate who worked on the project for
several years while he was here, had to
make numerous phone calls to old
churches in Georgia and census bureaus
to trace King's genealogy.
He says much of the work was "drudge
work." But he notes, "There are one or
two shining moments when you come up
with the right place or the right name
and that feels good."
Senior Megan Maxwell says she was

the "only one insane enough to go
through all of the footnotes of some of
his papers and figure out what he was
talking about."
She adds, "I don't think he ever knew
how to do footnotes. He'd write the title
and the author but forget the year and
publisher sometimes."
Nearly 80,000 of the original papers
are located at Boston University, where
King donated them. Coretta King would
like to consolidate the documents, as
would Carson, but legal issues have
prevented this.
Though the project's goal is to provide
the raw materials for further study with
out editorial commentary, each document
is preceded by a paragraph that provides
a context for interpreting it, according to
Carson.
"Sometimes the line between annota
tion and connotation is hard to draw,"
he says. "We try to make a judgment on
what historians of the future would be
most interested in."
