# Students and faculty remember the man, his inspiring words and 'expanded vision'
## 
### Lynne Bourgault 
National holidays function as a time
for remembering, and this past Mon
day we were asked to remember Mar
tin Luther King Jr., a man whom most
Stanford students are too young to
have known as he lived.
Thus, the holiday commemorating
his birthday is more than a time for
remembering, it is an opportunity for
learning.
Twenty years after his assassination,
King's memory as a civil rights leader
continues to inspire people. Mary Dil
lard, chair of the Black Student Union,
says that while she has been influenced
by many different civil rights leaders
such as Malcolm X and Jesse Jackson,
King's preachings of non-violent civil
disobedience and racial unity have
been most applicable at Stanford.
Dillard points out that the BSU uses
sit-ins and marches to demonstrate
their discontent, and that these non
violent forms of protest stem from
King's example.
According to Dillard, King's recogni
tion of the need for all races to unify
in their struggle for equality inspired
the BSU to work as a coalition with
the Chicano, Asian and Native Amer
ican groups on campus.
Dillard particularly admires King's
"expanded vision" and his attempt "to
bring all different types of people to
gether — poor people as well as people
of color."

Prof. Estelle Freedman, a historian
who teaches in the Feminist Studies
program, agrees that King is an in
spiring leader for everyone.
She views King as "a symbol for all
the nameless people who worked for
civil rights," including the countless
women such as Rosa Parks and Ella
Baker who for years were active in
the grass-roots struggle for equality.
Carl Thoresen, a professor of psy
chology who specializes in the phenom
enon of anger and hostility, says that
King's stand on non-violence
"validated his position as a leader."
Thoresen believes that King must have
felt anger but that "he effectively man
aged those extremely justified negative
emotions and came forth with exem
plary ways of dealing with the obsta
cles in life."
According to Thoresen, what made
King "the predominant spokesperson
of his time was that there was sym
metry between his words and his ac
tions."
Yet for some of today's black ac
tivists, King's message is only one of
many that have influenced the struggle
for equal rights. Dillard says she would
"like to see the programs surrounding
Malcolm X's birthday as widely recog
nized as those for King."
As a historian, Freedman views
holidays as a way of determining "what
is historically significant."
