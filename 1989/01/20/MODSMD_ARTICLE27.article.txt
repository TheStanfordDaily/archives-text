Editor's note: Andrew Berkowitz was
unable to write his column this week due
to several sexual acts he attempted over
the holiday weekend without a spotter.
In its place, the five Opinions page colum
nists (Ted, Deirdre, Simon, Ashley and
Mitch) have graciously donated several
paragraphs each from next week's
columns in order to fill the space. We
thank them in advance.

"Ask not what your country can do for
you, but what you can do for your country.
Well, actually there's no harm in asking.
Yeah, on second thought, you might as
well just demand that your country do
something for you and . . . Oh hey,
Marilyn, looking good! (whistle) ... as I
was saying, if your country doesn't do
something for you then you should just
move to Russia where they will do some
thing for you, dammit ..."

Jan 20, 1961
IN TODAY'S COLUMN I would like
to look at the various men running
for President of the United States
and offer my predictions as to who will
win. And please remember that you read

it here first when I say that George Bush
will be our next president. The reasons
for this are plentiful, not the least of
which is that he is scheduled to be sworn
in at the inauguration at noon today. But
besides this prediction I would also like
to . . .
. . . perform some public service. I can't
think of anything more important, can
you? Let's make it an entrance require
ment to the University. No, let's make
it DR: 9. No, let's make it an entire
major! What the hell, let's devote every
single resource, every single penny of our
$1 billion endowment to performing
public service! Let's role up our sleeves,
get down on our hands and knees and . . .
. . . bicycle across the country. Yes, I
bicycled across the country this summer
and felt so good about myself that I
decided to write a book about the exper
ience. It's entitled, "I'm OK, You're OK,
Unless You've Never Bicycled Across the
Country, In Which Case You're Worth
less." This book is available wherever . . .
.. . you go skiing. I, for one, went skiing
at Taos, and let me tell you that you

just can't find better slopes anywhere in
the country. If you go, I'd recommend
renting a good pair of skis and boots
unless . . .
. . . you're fat and filled with hopeless
despair. Then you'll turn to the cycle of
binge-purge-binge-purge until you are a
card-carrying bulimic. Problems like
bulimia and anorexia nervosa affect mil
lions of young women in this country
who are more concerned with appearance
than . . .
. . . performing public service at night,
performing public service at Sea World,
performing public service for . . .
. . . millions of innocent fetuses. I mean,
I would never choose to have an abortion,
and because of that I believe that nobody
else should be allowed to have an abor
tion. Sure, I am a man, but a pregnant
woman's body doesn't just belong to her,
it also belongs to . . .
. . . Pat Robertson, who now has very
little chance to win the nod as the Re
publican nominee since the convention
was held seven months ago. But I'd like

to reflect on the convention and see if . . .
.... I can think of anything to write
this week since I didn't even want to
come back to school after Christmas
break. Maybe I'll just write some random
thoughts about things that have been
bothering me: I have a hangnail ... I
wonder if my new dress matches my
shoes? ... I think maybe I'll join the Air
Force and agonize over the decision in
next week's column ... I don't under
stand art. Therefore, all art is worthless
.. . Thanksgiving means so much when
you think about . ..
. . . how fat I was during junior high.
So fat that I ate all the stuffing straight
out of the turkey and then went into the
bathroom, stuck my finger down my
throat and .. .
. . . performed some public service right
there on the spot! I didn't even wait to
see whether they needed help. "They're
not Armenian earthquake victims," I
thought to myself, but that doesn't mean
I can't . . .
. . . prove that God exists. Religion is

not a tangible, physical thing, but a
nebulous, ethereal thing, such as . . .
. . . Bob Dole, who was the early favorite
for the nomination until he . . .
. . . bicycled across the country. Al
though in elementary school he was so
fat that he . . .
. . . PERFORMED PUBLIC SERVICE
AT BAR MITZVAHS, PERFORMED
PUBLIC SERVICE FROM THE GRAVE,
PERFORMED PUBLIC SERVICE ...

This column is the first in a seven-part
series. Next week: "Twenty things you
should do to become a better person be
cause I say so."
