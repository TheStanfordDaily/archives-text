Think I got your number
Tracy Chapman nominated for six Grammys?
Give us a break. Tune into the 16th Annual
"American Music Awards" a week from Monday
to find out who is really popular. Winners are
selected by the public based on a poll of 20,000
ordinary (snicker) people. Hosting the telecast
will be Anita Baker, Debbie Gibson, Kenny
Rogers and Rod Stewart. Gloria Estefan and
Miami Sound Machine, nominated in the "Fa
vorite Pop/Rock Group" category, will be per
forming live. We simply can't wait.
Return of ruby Tuesdays
Let's all give a collective cheer for the return
of Tuesday Films after a brief hiatus. Sponsored
by the Graduate Students Association, this
quarter's movies are a quirky collection of weird,
visionary epics. This Tuesday's film is Federico
Fellini's "Satyricon," a surreal and spectacular
story about an amoral youth in ultradecadent
Rome. Later films will include Francis Ford Cop
pola's "Rumblefish" on February 14, Alexandro
Jodorowsky's Mexican X-rated cult western "El
Topo" on February 28 and the unedited version
of Terry Gilliam's "Brazil" on March 7.
All shows are Tuesdays at 8 p.m. in Cubberley
Auditorium. Admission is free.
