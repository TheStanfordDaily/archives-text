## Cal's inspired defense kept Stanford in check 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
BERKELEY — After Arizona
knocked off California in Harmon
Gym two weeks ago, the Wildcats'
Sean Elliott said he didn't believe
anyone else would beat the Bears
on their home court for the rest
of the season.
If last night's victory over Stan
ford was any indication, he may
very well be right.
Before 6,578 screaming fans, as
well as NBA talent guru Marty
Blake, a writer from Sports Il
lustrated and scouts for five NBA
teams, California put an end to
the Cardinal's eight-game win
ning streak and almost certainly
knocked the team from the Asso
ciated Press Top 20.
Several members of the Bears
suggested that they didn't do any
thing special to come away with

the win — they just played hard.
"Coach [Bears' skipper Lou
Campanelli] told us 'Just die if
you have to. We have a week off
coming up,' " California's
Leonard Taylor said about the
Bears' intense play — including
a near-perfect second half.
So they were willing to let it
all hang out. Mix in the motiva
tion of facing Stanford, a ranked
club that's received a lot of atten
tion lately and you've got a recipe
for victory.
"Coach said 'Sports Illustrated
is here to cover the game. They're
not here to cover you; they're here
to cover Stanford' " Taylor added.
Last night, however, the story
was all Golden Bears. Stanford
opened up a 10 point lead in the
first half, but couldn't extend it.
The Bears battled back and cut
it to six at the half.
After the intermission, Califor

nia played almost exclusively zone
defense. Switching between a 1-1-
3, a 3-2 and other "different looks"
as Taylor called them, the Bears
stymied Todd Lichti's efforts to
penetrate and took away a large
part of the inside game.
With Howard Wright's injured
hand affecting his shooting and
with Eric Reveno being pushed a
little farther out of the low post
than he might like, Stanford got
few easy baskets in the final 20
minutes.
The Bears, on the other hand,
got a couple of easy hoops as the
Cardinal, most notably Scott
Meinert, had trouble handling
California's full-court pressure.
When Stanford fell behind, they
tried to press themselves. At one
point, John Patrick, Terry Taylor
ai d Lichti — three guards — were
on the floor together to try and
force a Bear turnover.
