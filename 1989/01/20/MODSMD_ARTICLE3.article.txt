Remember those ridiculous lines at ASSU elec
tions last spring? A new computerized voting system
proposed at last night's ASSU Senate meeting may
put an end to that waiting.
The proposal, which was presented by ASSU Elec
tions Commissioner Steve Krauss, would replace
the current system of voting booths with several
clusters of Macintosh II computers.
Under the present system, the Elections Commit
tee rents the voting equipment from the Santa Clara
County registrar's office in San Jose. Besides saving
the committee the trouble of lugging all the equip
ment back and forth, the new system would save
the ASSU $5,000 in rental costs, said Krauss, a
junior.
The new system would have more total voting
terminals than last year, although they will be clus
tered in fewer sites.
In addition, the system would speed up tabulation
time, Krauss said. While it takes several days to
get the results from San Jose, the computers could
determine winners in a matter of hours.
The new system would cost about $1,500 for
software and would utilize terminals at Meyer Li
brary and LOTS, among others.
"Barring unforeseen catastrophe," the system
could be ready for implementation by the coming
election, which will take place on April 18 and 19,
Krauss said. The senate still has to approve the
idea at a later meeting.
