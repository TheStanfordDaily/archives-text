# Card falls to Bears at hostile Harmon Arena

BERKELEY — Stanford, which
has been a second-half explosion
waiting to happen almost the en
tire season, fizzled in the middle
of a powder keg known as Harmon
Arena.

Men's Basketball
Golden Bears 75, Cardinal 64

The Cardinal men's basketball
team was shut out for five and a
half minutes down the stretch as
California rallied to a 75-64
Pacific 10 Conference win before
a sellout crowd of 6,578 frenzied
fans at Harmon.
Stanford, ranked 20th by Asso
ciated Press going into the game,
fell to 5-2 in the Pac-10 and 13-4
overall, as an eight-game winning
streak came to an end. Cal im
proved to 4-3 in the Pac-10 and
13-5 overall.
Cal had not led by more than
two for the first 35 minutes of
the game, but the Golden Bears
reduced Stanford to ashes with a
14-0 run down the stretch. And
as Stanford fouled and fouled in
the hopes of catching up, Cal con
verted 16 free throws in a row to
seal the victory.
"As I told Mike (Stanford Coach
Montgomery) before the game,
Stanford is a heck of a team," Cal
Coach Lou Campanelli said.
"They're certainly deserving of
their ranking. But our kids were
not going to be denied tonight."
Bears center Leonard Taylor,
especially, was a man determined.
The senior scored 21 points,
grabbed 12 rebounds, and made
11 of Cal's 30 free throws in the
game.
"The fact that they're in the
top 20 really got us going," Taylor
said.

Taylor also led a swarming Bear
team that held Stanford to 41.7
percent shooting, committed no
second-half turnovers and out
rebounded the Cardinal 34-29.
"We got beat at our own game,"
Montgomery said. "We got beat
in the color. We can't afford to
get beaten on the boards and be
successful."
Stanford forward Howard
Wright was hampered with a
sprained left thumb, but that
seemed to affect his shooting (5-
for-12) more than his rebounding
(a team-high seven).
Stanford led by 32-22 with un
der four minutes to go in the first
half, but Taylor hit two outside
jumpers to cut it to six at
halftime.
"That really helped us, getting
the two buckets before halftime,"
Taylor said. "Then we came out
and scored the first bucket of the
second half to keep the momen
tum."
Cal chipped away and finally
took its first lead of the second
half with 11:47 to go. The teams
then hung close to each other for
a seemingly hand-wringing eter
nity.
But with Stanford up 51-49
with 7:12 left, Cal's Roy Fisher
scored on a pass from Ryan Drew
to tie it. Then after a foul by
Stanford's Deshon Wingate, Brian
Walton hit two free throws to give
Cal the lead for good.
A minute and a half later, with
eight seconds on the shot clock,
Wright fouled Taylor, who sunk
two at the line. After a turnover
by Scott Meniert, Cal got the ball
back. A foul by Todd Lichti put
Keith Smith at the line, and he
sunk two.
Wright was fouled by Fisher,
but came up empty at the foul
line, a big blow for the Cardinal.
Fisher then got the ball in the
lane and scored to make it 59- 51.
Matt Beeuswaert and Leonard

Taylor also went to the line for
two free throws each before Stan
ford's Terry Taylor finally hit a
3-pointer, ending a five and a half
minute drought to cut it to 63-54
with 1:42 left.
Stanford made the customary
last-ditch foul and time-out ef
forts, but Cal passed the test with
flying colors.
"We had a 10-point lead which
could have been an 18-point lead,"
Montgomery said. "We could have
had the seed of doubt planted
right there. But the way Cal
played in the second half, they
deserved to win the game."
In particular, the Bears did a
great job to hold Lichti to eight
in the second half, after he had
twice scored over 20 in the second
halves of games earlier this
month.
"It was just good defense,"
Campanelli said. "We worked our
tails off."
Stanford doesn't have much
time to rest for its next game
tomorrow against UCLA, but
Montgomery hinted the team
would be prepared.
"If I know our guys they'll be
hungrier than heck," Mont
gomery said. "They'll be coming
out with rawhide in their teeth."
