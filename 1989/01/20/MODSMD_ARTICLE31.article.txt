# Men's volleyball digs in for home opener
## 
### John Kirks Chris Cruder Staff writers 
This year's version of the Stanford men's
volleyball team takes the floor of Maples Pa
vilion for the first time this season tomorrow
night when it hosts Loyola Marymount at
7:30 p.m.
The game marks the beginning of Stanford's
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Association
regular season play, a game which the players
have been eagerly awaiting since fall practice
began in October. Coach Fred Sturm thinks
his team is ready.
"I really couldn't be happier with the team's
progress. We are improving by leaps and
bounds. I have no complaints because the
effort is there — these guys have a great
work ethic. Overall, I'm very pleased, and I
think the guys are also."
Indeed, judging by Wednesday night's prac
tice, Sturm's optimism seems well-founded.
The team seemed loose as players joked be
tween scrimmage points and ball shaggers
sprinted at top speeds after loose balls. They
showed all the signs of a confident squad
ready to break out of the starting gate.
Stanford, a member of the perennially
super-powerful WIVA, has to have such a
quick start if it expects to contend for an

NCAA Tournament bid. The ten-team confer
ence is balanced from top to bottom, and a
top-two finish is a prerequisite for postseason
play. With defending champion USC and pow
erful Hawaii also in contention, one might
think that Stanford's chances would be bleak.
However, Stanford expects to be right in the
thick of things come late April.
Why all of the excitement and optimism?
What makes anyone think that this team is
so special, coming off its less-than-stellar 11-
19 record and eighth place WIVA finish in
1988? It suffices to say that Stanford has
been the beneficiary of good Fortune.
Scott Fortune is Stanford's superstar middle
blocker and team captain. His claim to fame:
he put down the final point of the Olympic
gold medal match against the Soviet Union.
Does anything more need to be said about
him?
Probably not, except that Fortune is the
only collegiate player with Olympic experience
and is thus automatically a strong candidate
for NCAA Player of the Year. He is the number
one reason Stanford is ranked fourth nation
ally in Volleyball Monthly's preseason top 10.
Of course, having five other returning
starters and the best freshman class in the
nation certainly can't hurt.
Stanford will carry its preseason promise
into its opener against the Lions of Loyola

Marymount. LMU finished its 1988 season
in the league's cellar, but due to the strength
of the WIVA, the Lions were ranked in the
top 20 all season. But, like Stanford, they
have improved greatly.
"They used to be at the bottom of the
league," senior Dave Johnson said, "but
they've got a new coach now (former UCLA
standout Mike Normand). They are no longer
a blow-off team. Talent is more evenly dis
tributed than ever in the WIVA."
This season, the Cardinal has already faced
the Lions. Last weekend, Stanford competed
in the Michelob Invitational at UC-Santa Bar
bara. After defeating two club teams in pool
play and losing a very close match to UCLA,
Stanford handled the Lions two games to one
en route to a seventh-place finish in the 24-
team tournament. Second-ranked Hawaii
defeated Canadian entry Calgary in the final
and top-ranked USC, suffering from injuries,
took fifth.
The Cardinal also boasts a second-place
finish in a tournament in Saskatoon, Sas
katchewan, Canada. Stanford defeated Al
berta, Winnipeg and Saskatchewan while
losing to Manitoba in pool play, then lost again
to Manitoba in the final.
Loyola Marymount's top returnees are out-
side hitters Sio Siapaia and Kirk
Fonoimoana (say those five times
fast), and they'll be complemented
by setters Rick McLaughlin and
Mike Longacre, and middle
blocker Danny Mclnerny.
Sturm seems to have solidified
the Cardinal lineup, except for the
setter position. Fortune, Dan
Hanan, a returning All-American,
and freshman Duncan Blackman,
possibly the top recruit in the
country last year, will be on the
floor for the Cardinal. With re
turning starters Craig Forsyth

Uaceiatcd nana) and John
Alstrom (shoulder) still injured,
freshmen Chris Wrede and Doug
Walquist are also likely starters.
The big question mark is at the
setter position, as Sturm has
stalled in giving any indication as
to who will start. Both redshirt
freshman Ryan O'Hara and junior
Parker Blackman should both see
a lot of time.
Blackman, a starter since the
middle of his freshman year,
missed almost all of fall practice
with a broken hand but is coming
on strong. O'Hara, the first-team
setter all fall has also been playing
well, leaving Coach Fred Sturm
with no clear-cut choice.

Regardless of which six players
take the floor to start the game,
the team will have but one mis
sion tomorrow night: to pocket
its first victory of the 1989 reg
ular season. According to
Johnson, it shouldn't be an over
whelming task. "We're a better
team, but we still need to play
well. We just need to start out
strong and keep on them."
Card note
Fortune, a preseason candidate for
NCAA Player of the Year based on
his international experience, and
Hanan, a second-team All-WTVA per
former last year, were named to the
all-tournament team at the Canadian
event.

The big question mark is at the
setter position, as Sturm has
stalled in giving any indication as
to who will start. Both redshirt
freshman Ryan O'Hara and junior
Parker Blackman should both see
a lot of time.
Blackman, a starter since the
middle of his freshman year,
missed almost all of fall practice
with a broken hand but is coming
on strong. O'Hara, the first-team
setter all fall has also been playing
well, leaving Coach Fred Sturm
with no clear-cut choice.

Regardless of which six players
take the floor to start the game,
the team will have but one mis
sion tomorrow night: to pocket
its first victory of the 1989 reg
ular season. According to
Johnson, it shouldn't be an over
whelming task. "We're a better
team, but we still need to play
well. We just need to start out
strong and keep on them."
Card note
Fortune, a preseason candidate for
NCAA Player of the Year based on
his international experience, and
Hanan, a second-team All-WTVA per
former last year, were named to the
all-tournament team at the Canadian
event.
This year's version of the Stanford men's
volleyball team takes the floor of Maples Pa
vilion for the first time this season tomorrow
night when it hosts Loyola Marymount at
7:30 p.m.
The game marks the beginning of Stanford's
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Association
regular season play, a game which the players
have been eagerly awaiting since fall practice
began in October. Coach Fred Sturm thinks
his team is ready.
"I really couldn't be happier with the team's
progress. We are improving by leaps and
bounds. I have no complaints because the
effort is there — these guys have a great
work ethic. Overall, I'm very pleased, and I
think the guys are also."
Indeed, judging by Wednesday night's prac
tice, Sturm's optimism seems well-founded.
The team seemed loose as players joked be
tween scrimmage points and ball shaggers
sprinted at top speeds after loose balls. They
showed all the signs of a confident squad
ready to break out of the starting gate.
Stanford, a member of the perennially
super-powerful WIVA, has to have such a
quick start if it expects to contend for an

NCAA Tournament bid. The ten-team confer
ence is balanced from top to bottom, and a
top-two finish is a prerequisite for postseason
play. With defending champion USC and pow
erful Hawaii also in contention, one might
think that Stanford's chances would be bleak.
However, Stanford expects to be right in the
thick of things come late April.
Why all of the excitement and optimism?
What makes anyone think that this team is
so special, coming off its less-than-stellar 11-
19 record and eighth place WIVA finish in
1988? It suffices to say that Stanford has
been the beneficiary of good Fortune.
Scott Fortune is Stanford's superstar middle
blocker and team captain. His claim to fame:
he put down the final point of the Olympic
gold medal match against the Soviet Union.
Does anything more need to be said about
him?
Probably not, except that Fortune is the
only collegiate player with Olympic experience
and is thus automatically a strong candidate
for NCAA Player of the Year. He is the number
one reason Stanford is ranked fourth nation
ally in Volleyball Monthly's preseason top 10.
Of course, having five other returning
starters and the best freshman class in the
nation certainly can't hurt.
Stanford will carry its preseason promise
into its opener against the Lions of Loyola

Marymount. LMU finished its 1988 season
in the league's cellar, but due to the strength
of the WIVA, the Lions were ranked in the
top 20 all season. But, like Stanford, they
have improved greatly.
"They used to be at the bottom of the
league," senior Dave Johnson said, "but
they've got a new coach now (former UCLA
standout Mike Normand). They are no longer
a blow-off team. Talent is more evenly dis
tributed than ever in the WIVA."
This season, the Cardinal has already faced
the Lions. Last weekend, Stanford competed
in the Michelob Invitational at UC-Santa Bar
bara. After defeating two club teams in pool
play and losing a very close match to UCLA,
Stanford handled the Lions two games to one
en route to a seventh-place finish in the 24-
team tournament. Second-ranked Hawaii
defeated Canadian entry Calgary in the final
and top-ranked USC, suffering from injuries,
took fifth.
The Cardinal also boasts a second-place
finish in a tournament in Saskatoon, Sas
katchewan, Canada. Stanford defeated Al
berta, Winnipeg and Saskatchewan while
losing to Manitoba in pool play, then lost again
to Manitoba in the final.
Loyola Marymount's top returnees are out-
side hitters Sio Siapaia and Kirk
Fonoimoana (say those five times
fast), and they'll be complemented
by setters Rick McLaughlin and
Mike Longacre, and middle
blocker Danny Mclnerny.
Sturm seems to have solidified
the Cardinal lineup, except for the
setter position. Fortune, Dan
Hanan, a returning All-American,
and freshman Duncan Blackman,
possibly the top recruit in the
country last year, will be on the
floor for the Cardinal. With re
turning starters Craig Forsyth

Uaceiatcd nana) and John
Alstrom (shoulder) still injured,
freshmen Chris Wrede and Doug
Walquist are also likely starters.
