last night marked the first time the Cardinal committed more turnovers
than its opponent and lost
KEYS TO VICTORY — At Pauley Pavilion in December, Richardson smothered
Lichti on defense, holding him to 7-for-17 shooting. If Lichti turns that
around tomorrow, it could make all the difference. Stanford will also have
to meet the challenge inside of Mac Lean and Trevor Wilson, who are
combining to average almost 17 rebounds per game.
