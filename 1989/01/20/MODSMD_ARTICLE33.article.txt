# Stanford vs. Cal: Anything can happen
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Rivalries do strange things to
athletic teams, especially in the
Pacific 10 Conference. Supporters
of UCLA and USC have essen
tially drawn battle lines through
the streets of Los Angeles; Ari
zona and Arizona State always
fight hard under the blazing des
ert sun; and the Washington
schools, though tempered by their
state's cooler clime, also wage war
at every meeting.
The Bay Area is no exception.
Though more of a formality than
direct hatred, the Stanford-
California rivalry seems to endure
amid increasing intercollegiate ap
athy on Stanford's behalf When
ever the two schools meet in any
sport, regardless of rankings or
records, the contest is always a
hard-fought clash.
So should be the case this eve
ning, when the Cal women's bas
ketball team visits the Farm to
face the Cardinal. Though Stan
ford is ranked seventh nationally
and is atop the Pac-10, the emo
tion of the rivalry may well prove
to be the great equalizer.
Consider: Stanford is 12-2 on
the season and swept Cal last year
on route to the Midwest Regional
of the NCAA Tournament. The
Bears, 7-7 so far, rest on the laurel
of a 12-10 series advantage.
Stanford Coach Tara VanDer

veer's comment: "I think they're
ahead of us, so we're playing
catch-up."
For some nebulous reason, the
rivalry tightens things up and
evens out the odds. The confident
become the cautious while those
with nothing to lose find ways to

win. Though the Cardinal cagers
have become a veritable jugger
naut, flattening the rest of the
teams on the West Coast, the team
heeds the rivalry.
"1 really think that we are ap
proaching each game as a signif
icant game," VanDerveer said.

"It's not like Ca! is more impor
tant than Arizona or Washington
is more important than Washing
ton State. People are challenging
themselves to play hard no matter
who the opponent is.

All-America honorable mention Jennifer Azzi demonstrates some tenacious defense against Wash
ington. The guard will have to be In top form tonight against Cal if the Cardinal is to maintain its
No. 7 ranking.
"On the court, they (Cal) give
you specific problems. They have
a very good team, a young team.
Unfortunately one of their players
has been hurt, but they're
motivated and are having a very
good year."
It seems, then, that Maples Pa
vilion, now considered one of the
toughest arenas to visit for both
men and women's basketball
teams, will be the scene of a great
grudge match this evening. The
Bears definitely have something
to prove, while the Cardinal can

hardly afford to let the game slip
by and still hope to claim the con
ference crown.
Yet, despite the import, a brutal
match-up will not be manifest.
Unlike football, where Big Game
is the most important contest of
the season and the players inflict
pain accordingly, the'clash of the
cagers has a milder if not as emo
tional a tone.
"I don't think the rivalry is as
intense in basketball as it is in
football," VanDerveer observed.
"/ don't approach them any dif
ferent than any other team in the
Pac-10."
If anything, VanDerveer looks
more kindly at Cal. This might

seem strange: supporting an ad
versary is hardly standard prac
tice. However, though their inter
ests clearly diverge come game
time, the two teams inadvertently
aid each other weekend after
weekend.
"I like them to do well in 16
dlf their other games, because they
beat up on somebody the day
before we play them. In some
respects we work together,
beating up on the team that the
'Tor the 16 other games, I hope
they win," VanDerveer added.
"For those other two, we have to
want it more and play harder.
They definitely are a good chal
lenge for us."

Unlike football, where Big Game
is the most important contest of
the season and the players inflict
pain accordingly, the'clash of the
cagers has a milder if not as emo
tional a tone.
"I don't think the rivalry is as
intense in basketball as it is in
football," VanDerveer observed.
"/ don't approach them any dif

Pac-10."
If anything, VanDerveer looks
more kindly at Cal. This might

seem strange: supporting an ad

weekend.
"I like them to do well in 16
dlf their other games, because they
beat up on somebody the day
before we play them. In some
respects we work together,
beating up on the team that the
'Tor the 16 other games, I hope
they win," VanDerveer added.
"For those other two, we have to
want it more and play harder.
They definitely are a good chal
lenge for us."
