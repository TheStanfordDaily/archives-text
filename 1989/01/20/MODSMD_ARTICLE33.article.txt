# Stanford vs. Cal: Anything can happen
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Rivalries do strange things to
athletic teams, especially in the
Pacific 10 Conference. Supporters
of UCLA and USC have essen
tially drawn battle lines through
the streets of Los Angeles; Ari
zona and Arizona State always
fight hard under the blazing des
ert sun; and the Washington
schools, though tempered by their
state's cooler clime, also wage war
at every meeting.
The Bay Area is no exception.
Though more of a formality than
direct hatred, the Stanford-
California rivalry seems to endure
amid increasing intercollegiate ap
athy on Stanford's behalf When
ever the two schools meet in any
sport, regardless of rankings or
records, the contest is always a
hard-fought clash.
So should be the case this eve
ning, when the Cal women's bas
ketball team visits the Farm to
face the Cardinal. Though Stan
ford is ranked seventh nationally
and is atop the Pac-10, the emo
tion of the rivalry may well prove
to be the great equalizer.
Consider: Stanford is 12-2 on
the season and swept Cal last year
on route to the Midwest Regional
of the NCAA Tournament. The
Bears, 7-7 so far, rest on the laurel
of a 12-10 series advantage.
Stanford Coach Tara VanDer

veer's comment: "I think they're
ahead of us, so we're playing
catch-up."
For some nebulous reason, the
rivalry tightens things up and
evens out the odds. The confident
become the cautious while those
with nothing to lose find ways to

win. Though the Cardinal cagers
have become a veritable jugger
naut, flattening the rest of the
teams on the West Coast, the team
heeds the rivalry.
"1 really think that we are ap
proaching each game as a signif
icant game," VanDerveer said.

"It's not like Ca! is more impor
tant than Arizona or Washington
is more important than Washing
ton State. People are challenging
themselves to play hard no matter
who the opponent is.

All-America honorable mention Jennifer Azzi demonstrates some tenacious defense against Wash
ington. The guard will have to be In top form tonight against Cal if the Cardinal is to maintain its
No. 7 ranking.
