Harmon Arena and a 94 79 decision at Maples Pavilion.
GOLDEN BEARS UPDATE — Teresa Palmlsano a 6-2 sophomore forward,
remains the Bears' top player with team-high totals of 14.7 ppg and 7.8
rpg The injured Stafford rates second in scoring at 12.2 ppg, but fellow
freshman forward Ksshs Martin (9 7 ppg, 7 2 rpg) is picking up the
slack Senior guard Meme Fanner also boasts some credible numbers,
averaging 11.1 points and 4 6 assists per game.
CARDINAL UPDATE — On the latest Associated Press poll, the Cardinal is
holding steady at No. 7 after taking hold of the Pac-10 lead last weekend
with wins against Washington and Washington State. A major cause of
the success, preseason honorable mention All-American Jennifer Azzl
continues to earn her acclaim. The junior guard is a close second in
scoring to forward Katy Stedlng with 15.2 ppg (Steding is averaging
15.4 ppg) and leads the team and the league in assists with 6 4 per
game and in field goal percentage at 56 4 percent Azzi is also sixth in
the Pac 10 in free throw percentage, third in steals and seventh in 3-pomt
field goal percentage With her 18-point performance against Washington,
sophomore forward Trlsha Stevens is now averaging a solid 10 6 ppg
As a team, the Cardinal leads the conference in scoring margin with a
whopping 16 7 differential, well ahead of second place Washington's 8 8.
Tonight's game also marks senior center Jill Yanks s 22rid birthday
KEYS TO VICTORY — Stanford must contain Palmisano if it is to assure
Its 13th win With her unorthodox moves and uncanny ability to swish
the impossible shots, the Cardinal defense will need to keep close watch
on her Stanford must also keep an eye on Fanner: a decent player last
year whose sole threat was her tenacity on steals, the senior has evolved
into a fine scoring guard Rebounding is another concern: the Bears are
an especially good rebounding team, while the Cardinal has sporadic
blues on the offensive boards However, as long as the emotion of the
classical rivalry remains in check, the talented Cardinal should be able
to control the game early and allow its heralded deep bench to see
considerable action.
