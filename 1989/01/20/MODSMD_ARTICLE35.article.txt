# Griglione returns to Stanford waters

It has been said that winning isn't every
thing, and although only 19, Michelle
Griglione has learned that lesson well.
Griglione, a sophomore on the Cardinal
women's swim team, stopped out for the entire
1987-88 school year to train for the Olympics.
After a great season, however, she came home
from the Olympic Trials a quarter of a second
short of making the trip to Seoul.
But now, back on the Farm, Griglione is
finding everything is going, well, just swim
mingly.
"It's great," she said. "I really enjoy it. It
was good to have the year off, but it's better
to be back."
Her ability to succeed was never in doubt.
She came to Stanford in the fall of 1986, not

only as one of the nation's top high school
recruits, but as one of the nation's top swim
mers.
Her freshman season she placed third in
the 400-yard individual medley, fourth in the
200 butterfly and seventh in the 200 IM at
the NCAA Championships. She was the third
highest point-scorer on a Cardinal team that
missed the NCAA title by a miniscule 17
points — 648V2 to 631Vfe.
Last year was even better. At the Olympic
Trials, Griglione placed third in the 200-meter
fly and the 400-meter IM, fourth in the 200-
meter IM and fifth in the 100-meter fly. Pretty
impressive. But only the top two swimmers
in each event got plane tickets to Korea.
"I had a really good year," she said. "I
swam really well, except at (the Olympic) Tri
als. I didn't really have a bad Trials, but it
wasn't my best meet. ..."

Despite the disappointments, however, she
still feels the year off was the right move.
"It really was," she said. Citing the Olym
pics as a distraction, she added, "I don't think
I would have really been an asset to the (Stan
ford) team. Now I've come back and I feel
that my goals are consistent with those of the
team."
Under the guidance of new Coach Richard
Quick, Griglione feels this year's edition of
Stanford women's swimming could be as good
as her previous, or any other, Cardinal squad.
Swimming her first collegiate dual meet in
almost two years today, Griglione is ready for
another trip to the NCAA Championships. "I
think my training has been better than it has
ever been," she said. "My goals this season
are just to do [personal bestsl in the individual
medley. . . . We're all just trying to swim as
fast as we ever have."
