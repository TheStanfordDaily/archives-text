# Wolverines bring 2 Olympians to de Guerre

Four competitors will have an edge in ex
perience when second-ranked Stanford takes
to the waters of deGuerre Pool this morning
at 11 to try to hold off the talented and hungry
Michigan Wolverines. Each team boasts two
swimmers who took a training break this past
summer and dropped by Seoul, South Korea
for a few weeks.
The Olympic flame has long been doused
and each competitor must prove himself anew
during the short course, dual meet season,
but Stanford's Jay Mortenson and Jason
Plummer and Michigan's Mike Barrowman
and Brent Lang are nonetheless helping propel
their squads to a higher level of competition.
While having swimmers represent their
countries in the world's most exclusive sport
ing competition is nothing new for the Car
dinal (Stanford has had 38 swimmers qualify
for the Olympics) it is a new experience for
the Wolverines.
"Michigan hadn't had a swimmer compete
in the games for 10 or 20 years, so having
two of us go to Seoul has brought the whole
team together," breaststroker Barrowman
said. "Before we would think, Wow! we can't
even stay in the pool with teams like Stanford,
but now we have the feeling that we can
compete with anyone."
As the currently fifth-ranked Wolverines not
only placed fifth at last year's nationals but

'Having Olympic swim
mers is not going to
change the meet that
much. They do get beat.'
â€” Brent Lang

also beat Stanford during the regular season,
the Cardinal is most likely not overjoyed with
Michigan's newest revelation.
While none of the '88 Olympians will face
each other directly, each can have the impact
to carry his team in what promises to be a
close meet. Whether it is through their actual
performances or placings in a race or simply
by igniting their teammates, the four ac
claimed competitors will definitely make their
presence known to teammates and rivals alike.
"Brent and Mike together swim six events,
which is half of a dual meet schedule, so they
are going to have a big impact," Stanford
Asst. Coach Ted Knapp said.
And swimmers are notorious for catching
on to one teammate's exceptional swim and
swimming faster themselves, leaving the op
posing team in their wake.
Mortenson competed in the 100-meter back

stroke and butterfly competitions and swam
a leg on the medley relay team. Plummer
swam distance freestyle for his native
Australia. Barrowman joined Mortenson on
Team USA in breast events, while Lang com
peted in freestyle and freestyle relays. So al
most every event has the possibility of being
a meet-turner.
While Mortenson downplays the importance
of the games in relation to his performance
this season, calling Seoul "just another inter
national meet," Lang definitely feels the
Olympics are aiding both himself and his
teammates.
"It opened my eyes to a higher level of
swimming than I had ever seen before," he
said. "I learned alot from the other U.S. swim
mers and I think I am able to relate some of
my experiences to the rest of my team."
Plummer also adds that competing through
out the entire summer, not only gave him
more confidence in his swimming but also
put him in the best shape of his life. "I don't
have to worry about maintaining my fitness,
which is nice, so I will defintely be in shape
when [the NCAA Championships] come
around," the freshman said.
Even though both squads were equally rep
resented on the Olympic front, there could be
some surprises. "Having Olympic swimmers
is not going to change the meet that much,"
Lang said. "They do get beat."
