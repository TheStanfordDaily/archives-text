# UCLA and USC at Stanford
## 
### 
TODAY — UCLA — deGuerre Pool, 2:00 p.m.
TOMORROW — USC — deGuerre Pool, 12 noon.
RECORDS - Stanford (0-0), UCLA (7-0, 2-0 in Pac-10), USC (5-2, 1-1).
CARDINAL UPDATE — These are Stanford's only home dual meets in
1989. The Cardinal has been training since fall with a few, low-key open
meets thrown in, but this is Stanford's first dual meet of the season.
BRUIN UPDATE — UCLA comes in to today's meet with a perfect 7-0
record, including Pac-10 victories over both Arizona and Arizona State.
UCLA will swim against California in Berkeley tomorrow.
TROJAN UPDATE — The Trojans enter the weekend after splitting their first
two Pac-10 meets. USC defeated Arizona State but fell to Arizona. The
Trojans meet California today before arriving on the Farm tomorrow.
SPRINT FREESTYLE — Senior Jenna Johnson, a five-time NCAA champ,
is the person to beat both days. Stanford teammate and classmate Aimee
Berzins, the NCAA 100 free runner-up as a sophomore, will also be a
factor. The Bruins will counter with senior Jenny Susser, perhaps their
top swimmer, while the Trojans' top hope is sophomore Lisa Dorman.
DISTANCE FREESTYLE — With two returning All-Americans, senior Dana
Anderson and sophomore Barb Metz, and two top freshmen, Julie
Martin and Eva Mortenson. Stanford will be tough to beat. UCLA will
send out Sheri Smith while USC pins its hopes on Leslie Daland
BREASTSTROKE — Another Stanford strength. Returning All-Americans
Susan Lenth, Jill Johnson and Bethanne Lambert, along with freshmen
J.T. Toten and Susan Johnson, give the Cardinal great quality and
quantity. Look for a Cardinal sweep both days.
BUTTERFLY — Jenna Johnson has an NCAA title in the 100 fly to her
credit and Michelle Griglione and Suzy Buckovich add quality depth.
Bruin senior Monica Ward is the defending Pac-10 champ in the 100
and Trojan junior Terri O'Laughiin is a double Ail-American, however.
BACKSTROKE — Michelle Donahue, Jenny Shannon, Susannah Miller
and Jody Smith are all NCAA point-scorers for the Cardinal. New Zealand
Olympian Sylvia Hume will try to keep the Trojans from getting swept.
INDIVIDUAL MEDLEY — Griglione may be the top collegiate IMer in the
country and Buckovich and frosh Karen Kraemer aren't so bad either.
DIVING — Stanford junior Katie Connors will be a favorite in every meet
she enters this year.
