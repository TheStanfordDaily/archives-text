# Recycling center plans clean-up

Tomorrow volunteers will have
the opportunity to contribute to
two environmental causes at once.
The Stanford Recycling Center
will donate $10 to any non-profit
environmental organization or
charity for every four hours that
a volunteer works at Winter
Clean-Up Day. "Donations will
come from the center's regular
operating budget," said Barb
Voss, a center co-manager.
This is the first time the center
has offered to donate to organi
zations or charities, according to
co-manager Anna Scott, a sopho
more.
Voss, who organized the event,
said the main goal of Winter

Clean-Up Day is to finish projects
not usually covered by the student
workers who staff the collection
routes. Volunteers will be asked
to paint, to clear a store area or
to do other routine maintenance,
she said.
"Winter Clean-Up day will also
be a good way for people to see
what the Recycling Center is all
about," Voss added.
"We've had volunteer days
before, but we've never needed
help as badly as we do now," she
said.
In past years, the center has
not work all that hard to publicize
the event. But because revenues
have decreased by 50 percent since
summer, due to a depressed paper
market, the center is in great need

of volunteer help.
Founded in 1978, the center is
a non-profit organization run pri
marily by students. "The center
is one of the top three campus
recycling programs in the nation,"
Voss said. "We recover about 10-
11 percent of Stanford's waste
stream." The center collects
paper, aluminum, glass and
cardboard.
"The center has been really suc
cessful, especially in getting
people aware," Scott said.
Winter Clean-Up day will run
from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the center,
located on Pampas Lane, off Serra
Street. If it rains Saturday, the
event will be rescheduled for Feb.
4.
