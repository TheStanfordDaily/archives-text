# Bush faces many pressing national crises
## 
### Michael McNitt 
At 9 a.m., George Herbert
Walker Bush "will solemnly
swear ... to preserve, protect
and defend the Constitution of
the United States," becoming
the 41st President of the United
States. But defending the Con
stitution is just one of many
tasks he will face in coming
years.
Besides a rapidly changing in
ternational situation and the
need to maintain economic ex
pansion, Bush will confront a
myriad of domestic issues that
dominated last year's presiden
tial campaign: drugs, education,
civil rights and the environment.
On all of these fronts, candi
date Bush promised to deliver
a "kinder, gentler" nation.
But President Bush's domes

tic agenda may be constrained
by the federal budget deficit and
his campaign pledge not to raise
taxes. He will have few re
sources for new domestic initia
tives.
A survey of domestic policy
watchers at Stanford revealed
some pessimism about Bush's
ability to be effective on the en
vironment, education and drugs.
But there was also optimism
about his civil rights policies,
particularly when compared to
Ronald Reagan's legacy.
Bush has already had a
chance to prove himself in the
drug war, as a chief policy ad
viser to Reagan. Calling atten
tion to the difficulty in halting
the flow of drugs into the United
States, Law Prof. Robert Weis
berg said: "Reagan's policy was
a failure, and Bush's probably

will be also. It takes massive
resources to interdict drug flows
into this country, but they still
only get a trivial percentage of
the inflow."
Keith Archuleta, an associate
dean of Student Affairs, urged
Bush to provide increased fund
ing for the Coast Guard in an
effort to stem the illegal drug
trade.
Archuleta criticized the ap
pointment of former Education
Secretary William Bennett as
the nation's drug czar, prefer
ring a person familiar with ur
ban problems. While Bennett
was secretary, Archuleta said,
"he only spoke out against pro
gressive moves in education
while cutting the (education)
budget."
