# Bush faces many pressing national crises
## 
### Michael McNitt 
At 9 a.m., George Herbert
Walker Bush "will solemnly
swear ... to preserve, protect
and defend the Constitution of
the United States," becoming
the 41st President of the United
States. But defending the Con
stitution is just one of many
tasks he will face in coming
years.
Besides a rapidly changing in
ternational situation and the
need to maintain economic ex
pansion, Bush will confront a
myriad of domestic issues that
dominated last year's presiden
tial campaign: drugs, education,
civil rights and the environment.
On all of these fronts, candi
date Bush promised to deliver
a "kinder, gentler" nation.
But President Bush's domes

tic agenda may be constrained
by the federal budget deficit and
his campaign pledge not to raise
taxes. He will have few re
sources for new domestic initia
tives.
A survey of domestic policy
watchers at Stanford revealed
some pessimism about Bush's
ability to be effective on the en
vironment, education and drugs.
But there was also optimism
about his civil rights policies,
particularly when compared to
Ronald Reagan's legacy.
Bush has already had a
chance to prove himself in the
drug war, as a chief policy ad
viser to Reagan. Calling atten
tion to the difficulty in halting
the flow of drugs into the United
States, Law Prof. Robert Weis
berg said: "Reagan's policy was
a failure, and Bush's probably

will be also. It takes massive
resources to interdict drug flows
into this country, but they still
only get a trivial percentage of
the inflow."
Keith Archuleta, an associate
dean of Student Affairs, urged
Bush to provide increased fund
ing for the Coast Guard in an
effort to stem the illegal drug
trade.
Archuleta criticized the ap
pointment of former Education
Secretary William Bennett as
the nation's drug czar, prefer
ring a person familiar with ur
ban problems. While Bennett
was secretary, Archuleta said,
"he only spoke out against pro
gressive moves in education
while cutting the (education)
budget."
Both Weisberg and Political Sci
ence Prof. Hubert Marshall said
the effort to eradicate the drug
supply has largely failed, and they
advocated initiatives to reduce the
demand for drugs. Weisberg also
pooh-poohed Bush's call for the
death penalty for certain drug of
fenses, saying, "This proposal is
a useless sham which mainly
diverts attention from the failure
of interdiction efforts."
Bush has had practice at fight
ing drugs, but he apparently is a
relative novice when it comes to
education. He made an audacious
campaign pledge to be the educa
tion president, although education
is primarily a state, not a federal,
concern.
Echoing other commentators,
Marshall noted that by nearly
every standardized test the
United States lags behind the
Japanese and the Europeans, in
basic subjects like math and ge
ography.
Said Marshall, "Bush wants to

'Listen to the rhetoric,
but don't be swayed
by it:

be the education president, yet he
never criticized Reagan's policy to
abolish the Education Depart
ment." Recognizing the limited
federal power in this area, Mar
shall nonetheless encouraged
Bush to employ grants and aid as
a carrot to facilitate state and lo
cal reform.
After eight years of perceived
slights from Reagan, many minor
ities welcome Bush's efforts to
reach out to them. On Monday,
Bush praised the Rev. Martin Lu
ther King Jr. in ceremonies honor
ing the late civil rights leader.
Bush said of King: "He lived a
hero's life. He left a hero's in
delible mark on the mind and im
agination of a great nation."
Although pleased by Bush's ef
forts, Archuleta, who is the direc
tor of the Black Community Serv
ice Center, tempered his enthusi
asm.
"Listen to the rhetoric," he said,

"but don't be swayed by it. We
must look at actual policies and
programs." Both Archuleta and
Law Prof. William Gould con
nected civil rights with economic
issues, such as black unemploy
ment. Constrained by the budget
deficit and his refusal to raise
taxes, Bush appears likely to make
only modest fiscal commitments
for urban renewal programs,
Gould said.
One positive sign for blacks is
that Bush's designated Secretary
of Housing and Urban Develop
ment, Jack Kemp, promises to
crusade for urban renewal. "Bush
has no where to go but up," Gould
said. "Reagan's record on civil
rights is the most unenviable in
the modern era. On traditional
civil rights issues such as voting,
housing and employment discrim
ination, we can expect action from
this administration."
Martin Anderson, a senior fel
low at the Hoover Institution and
former domestic policy adviser to
President Reagan, foresaw strong
efforts by Bush on civil rights.
"He'll actively pursue any policies
against racial discrimination,"
Anderson predicted.
