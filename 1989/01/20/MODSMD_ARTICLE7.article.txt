# USW dues increase proposed
## 
### Robert Landon Staff writer 
For the first time in Stanford union
history, United Stanford Workers
leaders are proposing a rate hike in
membership dues.
On Feb. 22, all union members will
vote on a proposal to raise rates by 30
percent. Union leaders are calling for
an increase from 1 percent to 1.3 percent
of the workers' gross pay, costing each
worker $60 to $100 annually.
Union President John Wagner said
that if the proposal is passed, most of
the money will go toward dues that the
union must pay to its "international"
â€” the AFL-CIO. Over the next several
years, the AFL-CIO plans to increase

significantly the rates they charge the
USW.
The USW applied for exemptions
from the international's increases, but
were denied, according to Wagner.
The union represents more than 1,200
employees including technical, service
and maintenance workers from campus,
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
and the Medical Center.
The union's contract with the Uni
versity comes up for negotiations every
three years. On Oct. 31, the USW and
the University finally settled on their
latest contract agreement. For nearly
two months, union members worked
without a contract and had threatened
to strike.
If passed, the remainder of new rev

enue would go into the union's strike
fund.
"We want to go into the next round
of negotiations with a strong strike
fund," said Linda Crouse, USW chief
steward.
Calling the rate hike unnecessary and
excessive, one union member charged
the union with inefficiency.
"They're throwing money around,"
said Donald Coates, an electronics shop
supervisor on campus.
However, Wagner said such charges
were ridiculous. "We don't have the
room to throw money around," he said.
But Coates said that some union
members fear the rate hike increase
will establish a dangerous precedent for
more increases down the road.
