# Davis' 'Teller Avenue' renamed
## 
### Elizabeth Howton Staff writer 
It seemed an unlikely proposition:
naming a street in a symbolic nuclear-

free zone after Hoover
fellow Edward Teller,
the man known as "the
father of the hydrogen
bomb." But it happened
in an industrial park in
Davis last summer, and
as soon as the "Teller
Avenue" street signs
went up, they were van
dalized.

The Davis City Council voted Wed
nesday to rename the street, ostensibly
because of an unwritten city policy that
streets are not to be named after living
people. Council member David Rosen

berg, who voted in favor of renaming
the street, said that a city public works
employee "simply goofed . . . the staff
person thought that Teller was
deceased."
Teller, at age 81, is alive and well.
However, Maynard Skinner, a council
member who voted against the name
change, said that ideology was involved
in the decision. He said some Davis
citizens objected to the street name "be
cause of Teller's involvement in nuclear
weaponry."
Teller, a physicist and senior research
fellow at the Hoover Institution, is a
staunch advocate of the Strategic De
fense Initiative and an adviser to the
Reagan administration on missile de
fense strategy. He also works at the
Lawrence Livermore National Labora
tory.

An employee at Teller's office at Hoo
ver said that Teller was not aware of
the controversy. Teller was unavailable
for comment.
Davis' Skinner said, "This whole
thing reminds me of a play Shakespeare
wrote called 'Much Ado About Noth
ing.' " However, he also said Teller was
"worthy of having a street named after
him," noting that Teller had established
a joint program in applied physics be
tween the UC-Davis and the Livermore
lab.
The affair was "minutia," Skinner
said, adding that there will probably be
more debate later this year over a pro
posed ordinance that would prohibit
Davis from doing business with com
panies that help manufacture nuclear
weapons. The city is currently only a
symbolic nuclear-free zone.
