# Local cinemas feel squeeze

There are no more lines stretching down the
block, and the marquee has fallen silent. The en
trance is boarded up. The Stanford Theater, Palo
Alto's most lavish movie house, is closed.
While the closure is only temporary, the Stanford
is just one of three Theaters in the area to close
down within the last year. The Bijou is gone, for
business reasons; its owner, Landmark Theater Cor
poration, pulled out and bought the Varsity —
formerly a repertory house — in its place, in March
1987.
The Fine Arts Theater, too, has shown its last
reel. Despite healthy business, the Theater owner
was forced to close last fall when the city of Palo
Alto initiated new taxes and seismic upgrading as
sessments.
How have these closings affected Palo Alto's
remaining Theaters? Still left are the Varsity, at
456 University Avenue, and the Aquarius, at 430
Emerson St., both of which are operated by
Landmark Corp. Competing with these two for the
same audience — and sometimes the same films —
are the Guild and the Park, which are just a few
blocks down El Camino Real in Menlo Park. In a
different league entirely is the Palo Alto Square, a
multi-plex doing a robust business off El Camino.
With so many cinemas so close together, is it
possible that another local Theater might join the
Byou and the Fine Arts in that big multi-plex up
in the sky? Probably not, according to the managers
of these Theaters, who naturally keep a close watch
on their businesses. While audience attendance is
by no means booming, it is stable and likely to
remain that way into the future.
Theater owners credit this stability to the loyalty
of the Palo Alto/Menlo Park audience. "Being in
this affluent area, we get upper-middle class,

Before being converted into a movie theater by Landmark Corpo
ration, the Varsity was a popular repertory playhouse.
