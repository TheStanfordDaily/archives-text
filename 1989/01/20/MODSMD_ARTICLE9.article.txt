# Local cinemas feel squeeze
## 
### Mark Tompkins Staff writer 
There are no more lines stretching down the
block, and the marquee has fallen silent. The en
trance is boarded up. The Stanford Theater, Palo
Alto's most lavish movie house, is closed.
While the closure is only temporary, the Stanford
is just one of three Theaters in the area to close
down within the last year. The Bijou is gone, for
business reasons; its owner, Landmark Theater Cor
poration, pulled out and bought the Varsity —
formerly a repertory house — in its place, in March
1987.
The Fine Arts Theater, too, has shown its last
reel. Despite healthy business, the Theater owner
was forced to close last fall when the city of Palo
Alto initiated new taxes and seismic upgrading as
sessments.
How have these closings affected Palo Alto's
remaining Theaters? Still left are the Varsity, at
456 University Avenue, and the Aquarius, at 430
Emerson St., both of which are operated by
Landmark Corp. Competing with these two for the
same audience — and sometimes the same films —
are the Guild and the Park, which are just a few
blocks down El Camino Real in Menlo Park. In a
different league entirely is the Palo Alto Square, a
multi-plex doing a robust business off El Camino.
With so many cinemas so close together, is it
possible that another local Theater might join the
Byou and the Fine Arts in that big multi-plex up
in the sky? Probably not, according to the managers
of these Theaters, who naturally keep a close watch
on their businesses. While audience attendance is
by no means booming, it is stable and likely to
remain that way into the future.
Theater owners credit this stability to the loyalty
of the Palo Alto/Menlo Park audience. "Being in
this affluent area, we get upper-middle class,

intellectual-type people who seem like
they have a big interest in film," says
Kathy Brown, assistant manager of the
Guild.
Hilary Hart, the manager of the Var
sity and the Aquarius, views the movie
going public similarly. She says the Var
sity's patrons are "fairly well-informed
about the movies. . . . They're waiting
for the movie to open; they've read
about it opening in San Francisco."
Palo Alto and Menlo Park are unusual
in that they support four movie
Theaters which concentrate on art and
foreign films. Big-budget Hollywood
movies ("garbage like 'Rambo lII,' " in
the words of Varsity assistant manager
Brian Slack) play in neighboring Moun
tain View at the Century 10 or at the
Old Mill Six, while more esoteric, less
commercial films come to the likes of
the Park and the Varsity.
"We don't have a mass appeal," says
Kathy Brown. She ought to know, for
she has worked at the Guild and the
Park since 1979. She adds, "Enough
people come to keep us going."
The Guild's audience is sizable
enough, and occasionally it is more than
that. Last fall the acclaimed British film
"Hope and Glory" sold out at the Guild
on weekends; it was one of the best
draws Brown can remember in her nine
years there. Still, the Guild only seats
280 people. The Park, which seats 690,
hasn't had a sell-out in 10 years, ac
cording to Brown.
Capacity crowds are also a rarity at
the Varsity, which holds 700 people.
With the occasional exception, such as
"Bull Durham" this past summer, the
regular films at the Varsity don't tend
to draw large crowds. As an example
of this, Slack mentions that even though
the Varsity was only one of two
Theaters on the peninsula to show "The
Last Temptation of Christ," opening
night crowds for the highly controver
sial film only numbered about 400. In
a big market like New York City, how
ever, two 1,400-seat Theaters had to
turn away hundreds on the opening
night of "Temptation," Slack says.
The Varsity fares much better with
the special events it occasionally hosts.
Manager Hart cites the animation fes
tivals shown every fall as a perennial
favorite. The festivals do well, she says,
because they are unavailable on video
and unique to the Varsity.
The fact that the Varsity doesn't draw
large audiences often is surprising, con
sidering its proximity to Stanford Uni
versity. After all, students looking for a
break from their studies need only go
straight down Palm Drive and onto Uni
versity Ave. to find the Varsity. But
over the course of her fourteen years
at the Varsity, Hart has noted that stu
dents don't make up a large part of the
audience.

"People who revolve around Stanford
for other reasons, whether because
they're workers or administrators there,
are more likely to come," Hart says.
Hart isn't sure why students don't
come to the Varsity more often, or in
larger numbers. Theaters like the Var
sity in other college towns tend to do
well, certainly in the towns where the
University of California campuses are
located. UC-Berkeley even supports one
of the Bay Area's last remaining reper
tory Theaters. Why is Stanford differ
ent?
"I suppose I could blame Ronald
Reagan," Hart says, laughing. College
students may have become more con
servative in their film-going tastes, Hart
thinks, compared to when she was in
college in the early '70s. "Students
aren't interested in the European direc
tors like Fellini, Truffaut and Bergman
these days. ... I worry about that. But
maybe like all things, it'll swing back."
As with the Park in relation to the
Guild, the Varsity has a little sibling,
the 250-seat Aquarius, which is tucked
away on Emerson, just off the beaten
path of University Ave. With two
Theaters squeezed into a very small
space, the Aquarius inevitably brings a
shoebox to mind. It sells out more often
than the Varsity, naturally, although
"bigger-name" films are booked at the
Varsity, according to Slack.
Standing in easy contrast to the four
individual Theaters described above is
the Palo Alto Square, a Theater with
two screens located just off El Camino
Real. The Palo Alto Square's films are
generally much more mainstream than

those of its neighbors, and so the
Theater attracts a broad audience.
The Square seats 600 and 350 in its
two auditoriums, and thanks to a dis
tribution arrangement with Paramount
Pictures, the Square gets runaway hits
like "Top Gun" and "Crocodile Dun
dee," and hangs on to them as long as
they keep making money "Crocodile
Dundee" played for six months, a pos
sible record for the Square and a statis
tic completely unheard-of at venues like
the Park or the Varsity.
The art Theater managers expect
business in the future to continue as it
has in the past, despite Palo Alto Square
Asst. Manager Justin Steers' belief that
"the little single-screen Theater is be
coming obsolete." The opening of the
big Century 10 complex in early 1986
has hurt the Old Mill Six, they say, but
not them, because of the films they
show.
And while the rise of home video has
had an impact on repertory Theaters
("Videos were definitely the last nail in
the coffin for the way the Varsity used
to be," Hilary Hart says), first-run
Theaters haven't been much affected.
"The video at home doesn't compare
with being in an audience, the wnole
ambiance of the thing," Justin Steers
maintains.
Hart says that people appreciate the
Varsity's wide screen and Dolby stereo
system over watching movies on the
small screen. Kathy Brown of the Guild
believes the Theaters will survive for a
very time-honored reason:
"People still love to go out. And our
old Theater still has a little bit of charm
to it."

Although it is now closed due to financial troubles, the Stanford Theatre was
once a popular playhouse in Palo Alto.
There are no more lines stretching down the
block, and the marquee has fallen silent. The en
trance is boarded up. The Stanford Theater, Palo
Alto's most lavish movie house, is closed.
While the closure is only temporary, the Stanford
is just one of three Theaters in the area to close
down within the last year. The Bijou is gone, for
business reasons; its owner, Landmark Theater Cor
poration, pulled out and bought the Varsity —
formerly a repertory house — in its place, in March
1987.
The Fine Arts Theater, too, has shown its last
reel. Despite healthy business, the Theater owner
was forced to close last fall when the city of Palo
Alto initiated new taxes and seismic upgrading as
sessments.
How have these closings affected Palo Alto's
remaining Theaters? Still left are the Varsity, at
456 University Avenue, and the Aquarius, at 430
Emerson St., both of which are operated by
Landmark Corp. Competing with these two for the
same audience — and sometimes the same films —
are the Guild and the Park, which are just a few
blocks down El Camino Real in Menlo Park. In a
different league entirely is the Palo Alto Square, a
multi-plex doing a robust business off El Camino.
With so many cinemas so close together, is it
possible that another local Theater might join the
Byou and the Fine Arts in that big multi-plex up
in the sky? Probably not, according to the managers
of these Theaters, who naturally keep a close watch
on their businesses. While audience attendance is
by no means booming, it is stable and likely to
remain that way into the future.
Theater owners credit this stability to the loyalty
of the Palo Alto/Menlo Park audience. "Being in
this affluent area, we get upper-middle class,

intellectual-type people who seem like
they have a big interest in film," says
Kathy Brown, assistant manager of the
Guild.
Hilary Hart, the manager of the Var
sity and the Aquarius, views the movie
going public similarly. She says the Var
sity's patrons are "fairly well-informed
about the movies. . . . They're waiting
for the movie to open; they've read
about it opening in San Francisco."
Palo Alto and Menlo Park are unusual
in that they support four movie
Theaters which concentrate on art and
foreign films. Big-budget Hollywood
movies ("garbage like 'Rambo lII,' " in
the words of Varsity assistant manager
Brian Slack) play in neighboring Moun
tain View at the Century 10 or at the
Old Mill Six, while more esoteric, less
commercial films come to the likes of
the Park and the Varsity.
"We don't have a mass appeal," says
Kathy Brown. She ought to know, for
she has worked at the Guild and the
Park since 1979. She adds, "Enough
people come to keep us going."
The Guild's audience is sizable
enough, and occasionally it is more than
that. Last fall the acclaimed British film
"Hope and Glory" sold out at the Guild
on weekends; it was one of the best
draws Brown can remember in her nine
years there. Still, the Guild only seats
280 people. The Park, which seats 690,
hasn't had a sell-out in 10 years, ac
cording to Brown.
Capacity crowds are also a rarity at
the Varsity, which holds 700 people.
With the occasional exception, such as
"Bull Durham" this past summer, the
regular films at the Varsity don't tend
to draw large crowds. As an example
of this, Slack mentions that even though
the Varsity was only one of two
Theaters on the peninsula to show "The
Last Temptation of Christ," opening
night crowds for the highly controver
sial film only numbered about 400. In
a big market like New York City, how
ever, two 1,400-seat Theaters had to
turn away hundreds on the opening
night of "Temptation," Slack says.
The Varsity fares much better with
the special events it occasionally hosts.
Manager Hart cites the animation fes
tivals shown every fall as a perennial
favorite. The festivals do well, she says,
because they are unavailable on video
and unique to the Varsity.
The fact that the Varsity doesn't draw
large audiences often is surprising, con
sidering its proximity to Stanford Uni
versity. After all, students looking for a
break from their studies need only go
straight down Palm Drive and onto Uni
versity Ave. to find the Varsity. But
over the course of her fourteen years
at the Varsity, Hart has noted that stu
dents don't make up a large part of the
audience.

"People who revolve around Stanford
for other reasons, whether because
they're workers or administrators there,
are more likely to come," Hart says.
Hart isn't sure why students don't
come to the Varsity more often, or in
larger numbers. Theaters like the Var
sity in other college towns tend to do
well, certainly in the towns where the
University of California campuses are
located. UC-Berkeley even supports one
of the Bay Area's last remaining reper
tory Theaters. Why is Stanford differ
ent?
"I suppose I could blame Ronald
Reagan," Hart says, laughing. College
students may have become more con
servative in their film-going tastes, Hart
thinks, compared to when she was in
college in the early '70s. "Students
aren't interested in the European direc
tors like Fellini, Truffaut and Bergman
these days. ... I worry about that. But
maybe like all things, it'll swing back."
As with the Park in relation to the
Guild, the Varsity has a little sibling,
the 250-seat Aquarius, which is tucked
away on Emerson, just off the beaten
path of University Ave. With two
Theaters squeezed into a very small
space, the Aquarius inevitably brings a
shoebox to mind. It sells out more often
than the Varsity, naturally, although
"bigger-name" films are booked at the
Varsity, according to Slack.
Standing in easy contrast to the four
individual Theaters described above is
the Palo Alto Square, a Theater with
two screens located just off El Camino
Real. The Palo Alto Square's films are
generally much more mainstream than

those of its neighbors, and so the
Theater attracts a broad audience.
The Square seats 600 and 350 in its
two auditoriums, and thanks to a dis
tribution arrangement with Paramount
Pictures, the Square gets runaway hits
like "Top Gun" and "Crocodile Dun
dee," and hangs on to them as long as
they keep making money "Crocodile
Dundee" played for six months, a pos
sible record for the Square and a statis
tic completely unheard-of at venues like
the Park or the Varsity.
The art Theater managers expect
business in the future to continue as it
has in the past, despite Palo Alto Square
Asst. Manager Justin Steers' belief that
"the little single-screen Theater is be
coming obsolete." The opening of the
big Century 10 complex in early 1986
has hurt the Old Mill Six, they say, but
not them, because of the films they
show.
And while the rise of home video has
had an impact on repertory Theaters
("Videos were definitely the last nail in
the coffin for the way the Varsity used
to be," Hilary Hart says), first-run
Theaters haven't been much affected.
"The video at home doesn't compare
with being in an audience, the wnole
ambiance of the thing," Justin Steers
maintains.
Hart says that people appreciate the
Varsity's wide screen and Dolby stereo
system over watching movies on the
small screen. Kathy Brown of the Guild
believes the Theaters will survive for a
very time-honored reason:
"People still love to go out. And our
old Theater still has a little bit of charm
