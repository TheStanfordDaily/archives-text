A recent study, presented to the American Psychological Association, revealed
some interesting facts about former Peace Corps Volunteers. For example:
• Over a five-year period, college faculty with Peace Corps experienced
averaged almost double the salary gains of Fullbright scholars.
• 250 Congressional aides and 10 percent of all Foreign Service officers are
Returned Peace Corps Volunteers.
• From 1980 to 1985, former Peace Corps Volunteers outperformed national
average salary gains for health service workers by 40.1%, educators by
13.5&, and public sector employees by 10.6%.
