# Moving to Macs
## Residences to replace IBMs by quarter end 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
Continuing a trend begun in
1984 with the introduction of the
Apple Macintosh, by the end of
the quarter, nearly all the remain
ing IBM Personal Computers in
residence computer clusters will
be replaced with machines made
by Apple.
According to Residential Com
puter Administrator Jeff Mer
riman, the switch is being made
because the Macintosh computers
are "more effective machines"
than the IBMs they are replacing.
He also said "financially and
programmatically" the conversion
makes sense.
The elimination of the IBMs
coincides with a recent gift of 40
Macintosh II computers from Ap
ple to Meyer Library. Receiving
these powerful, new machines en
abled Meyer to give 36 older Mac
intosh 512E computers to Resi
dential Education.
These computers will be
upgraded to the functional level
of the Macintosh Plus, a mid-level
computer made by Apple, by Ac
ademic Information Resources
before being installed in the dorm
clusters.
The gift from Meyer was sup
plemented with additional Macin
tosh computers that Res Ed pur
chased from the Bookstore using
money saved from lower-than
expected maintenance costs dur
ing the past three years.
According to Merriman, the es
timated cost for the conversion

will be $275,000. This will cover
the set-up cost and allow Res Ed
to purchase the software needed
to run the machines.
The new computer clusters will
consist of five to seven Macintosh
computers and at least one IBM,
based on the number of students
in the residence and the available
space. Under the present system,
computer clusters have anywhere
from four to 11 machines.
Currently, residential electronic
classroom programs only exist in
dorms which house freshmen and
at Mirrielees House. But after the
switch over, Res Ed hopes to ex
pand the program by developing
computer clusters for Governor's
Corner and the Row, Merriman
said.
He added that although pres
ently an exact location for the
computer cluster at Governor's
Corner has not been specified, the
Row is to receive 12 computers
which Diana Conklin, assistant
dean of Residential Affairs, will
distribute based on academic and
programmatic need.
Presently, there are 125 IBM
workstations and 25 Macintoshes
in all the residence clusters com
bined. After the conversion, there
will be about 165 workstations â€”
140 of which will be Macintosh
computers.
This switch coincides with a
recent move by the Freshman
English Department to integrate
Macintosh computers into its cur
riculum, Merriman noted. He
