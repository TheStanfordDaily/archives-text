# Former CIA director claims Cold War victory for U.S.
## 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
"We have reached a new era
in foreign policy," according to
former CIA Director Admiral
Stansfield Turner. "The Cold
War is over and we have won."
Turner made these remarks
in a speech Thursday night at
Cubberley Auditorium in which
he addressed the "Gorbachev
revolution" and explored "its
impact on the future of the
United States."
There have been "widespread
admissions that communism
has failed" not only from Mih
kail Gorbachev, but from many
Soviet leaders, Turner said.
"Perestroika (the restructur
ing of the Soviet economy) is
not just a good idea, but a ne
cessity," he stated. There are
new trends toward self
determination in the Soviet Un
ion, and the Soviet people "are
demanding a say in how they
are governed."
In the past, when living con
ditions were improving, people
were willing to accept the status

quo. Today, with the Soviet eco
nomy stagnating, people are no
longer willing to sacrifice their
rights and are demanding a "say
in government."
As a result, Gorbachev has
been forced to make concessions
by allowing some freedom of ex
pression, through the program
of glasnost or openness, and by
introducing some of the incen
tives our free markets offer,
Turner said.
However, Turner noted
"there are going to be direct
conflicts between what [Gorbac
hev] wants to do with the eco
nomy" and the "traditional po
litical beliefs of the Soviet Un
ion." Free-market incentives
run counter to Marxist doctrine,
and this tension may create
problems in the future.
Turner went on to speculate
about the effects these new So
viet attitudes will have on the
world. He said the "Soviets will
be preoccupied with effecting in
ternal changes so [they will
have] less energy and resources
to meddle around in the rest of
the world."

This "will give us a wonderful
opportunity to position our
selves against whatever
perestroika may produce," he
suggested.
Turner said in light of these
changes there are "three ways
to position ourselves." First, we
must have arms control agree
ments to reduce to risk of war.
Second, we must stand together
with our allies. And third, we
must strengthen our economy
so we can stay ahead of the
Soviet Union.
He added that in the future
"our relations with our alliances
will be one of the most impor
tant foreign policy issues" and
internally, national priorities
will shift from "military to eco
nomic" interests.
According to Turner, the
Bush administration will have
to encourage U.S. businesses to
become fiercely competitive
while maintaining good rela
tions with their foreign coun
terparts.
Turner ended his speech
stating the "Cold War is behind
N
US.
