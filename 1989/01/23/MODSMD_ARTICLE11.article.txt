## Demonstrations mark 16th anniversary of Roe v. Wade 
### 
Anti-abortion and pro-choice ac
tivists held rallies yesterday
marking the 16th anniversary of
the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in
the Roe v. Wade case that
legalized abortions.
Thousands of abortion protest
ers marched in St. Paul, Minn.,
Little Rock, Ark., Allentown, Pa.,
Boston and Burlington, Vt., while
smaller pro-choice rallies were
held in several cities.
In Little Rock, Asa Hutchinson,
a lawyer and former federal pros
ecutor, told a crowd of several
thousand people that the "tide is
changing" toward reversal of Roe
v. Wade.
An estimated 4,500 abortion
protesters marched in St. Paul to
the statehouse. There were no ar
rests.
In Philadelphia, about 30 pro
choice demonstrators held a can
dlelight vigil last night in front

of Independence Hall, where the
U.S. Constitution was signed.
Organizers said the vigil em
phasized that the freedom to have
a legal abortion may be in
jeopardy because of the Supreme
Court's decision to review a Mis
souri law that declares life begins
at conception.
In San Francisco, about 200
pro-choice protesters chanted dur
ing a march, "No back alleys in
the night, for safe abortion we
will fight."
Some pro-choice groups and
abortion protesters came face-to
face.
At the offices of Planned Paren
thood of Northern New England
in Burlington, Vt., more than 500
opponents of abortion were met
by 40 pro-choice demonstrators.
The two sides faced each other
from across the street, with each
group singing, clapping and main

taining their distance. There were
no arrests.
"Right-to-life is not a political
issue," said Bishop John Marshall,
the leader of Vermont's Catholic
diocese. "It has nothing to do with
politics. It is a religious and moral
question. It is not a matter for
the politicians to decide. It is a
religious and moral issue already
decided by Cod."
More than 500 people crowded
Boston's Faneuil Hall to hear Car
dinal Bernard Law lead a rally
against abortion.
Outside Faneuil Hall, a small
group of pro-choice protesters
chanting and carrying signs led
by longtime pro-abortion activist
Bill Baird picketed the building.
"I warn you now we are in dan
ger of losing the abortion law,"
Baird said.
