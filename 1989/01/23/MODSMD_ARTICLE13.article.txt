# Bundy confesses to nine deaths
## Last-minute reprieve attempts fail; execution to be held tomorrow 
### 
STARKE, Fla. (AP) - Serial killer
Ted Bundy's tearful llth-hour confes
sions failed yesterday to bring a delay
of his impending execution, but he
scheduled more talks with investigators
from four Western states.
Bundy provided investigators on Fri
day and Saturday with details of at
least nine murders for which he has
long been suspected but never charged.
By yesterday, however, he became er
ratic in his promises as he met with
attorneys, a friend and paralegals.
The 42-year-old law school dropout,
who is scheduled to die at 7 a.m. to
morrow, met yesterday with inves
tigators from Idaho, broke but res
cheduled an appointment with a Utah
detective, and canceled an afternoon
news conference today with 30 jour
nalists, state officials said.
"He's got visits scheduled with inves
tigators from Colorado, Utah and Wash
ington, some of them tonight and some
maybe tomorrow, although we don't
know about tomorrow," L.E. Turner,
assistant superintendent at Florida

State Prison, said late yesterday."He
may not have time for all of them."
Bundy, who has been on death row
at the prison since July 1979, lost an
appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court a
week ago, and no other court he has
turned to since has offered a reprieve.
Bundy's next step could be an appeal
to Anthony Kennedy, the Supreme
Court justice assigned to consider last
minute Florida death appeals. One jus
tice may stay an execution pending
review by the full court, but Kennedy
favors the death penalty.
In talks with authorities over the
weekend, Bundy, who grew up in
Tacoma, Wash., confessed to killing at
least eight young women in that state
in 1974, said investigator Robert Keppel
of the Washington attorney general's
office.
Bundy also confessed to the 1975
slaying of Julie Cunningham, 26, a Vail,
Colo., ski shop employee whose body
was never found, said Vail Police Chief
Ken Hughey.
Hughev said Bundy is convinced that

the only way he will get to heaven is
to confess.
"He's attempting to purge himself,"
said Colorado Attorney General Duane
Woodard. "It is part of his repenting."
"The man is trying to save his life,"
Keppel told KIRO-TV of Seattle. He
added that Bundy was shaken and tear
ful as he responded to questions from
investigators.
Bundy had not previously admitted
to any slayings.
Bundy scrapped his plan to hold a
news conference apparently on the ad
vice of his attorneys, said Richard Shel
ton, executive director of the Florida
Press Association, which was coordinat
ing the event.
Last week Bundy offered to trade in
formation about other slayings for a
delay in his execution, but Gov. Bob
Martinez, who signed Bundy's fourth
death warrant Tuesday, said he would
not "negotiate with a killer."
"Bundy is welcome to talk all he
wants, but he better say it by tomorrow
morning," said John Peck, press secre
tary to Martinez.
