COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -
At least 24 people, including four
Indian soldiers, were killed across
Sri Lanka in separatist violence
during the weekend, military of
ficials said yesterday.
The officials who cannot be
identified under standing briefing
regulations, said 16 Sinhalese
were killed in seven separate at
tacks since Saturday.
The attacks were blamed on the
People's Liberation Front, an or
ganization of radical Sinhalese op
posed to Colombo's peace over
tures to the Tamils fighting for
a separate homeland in the Indian
ocean republic since 1983.

The officials said 16
Sinhalese were killed
in seven separate at
tacks since Saturday.

Tamils, who make up 18 percent
of Sri Lanka's 16 million people
allege they are discriminated
against by the Sinhalese, who ac
count for about 75 percent of the
people.
The front says that Colombo
was offering too many concessions
to the Tamils.

In the Tamil-dominated north,
four Indian soldiers were killed
Saturday when ambushed by the
most powerful of the Tamil
separatist groups, the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The attack
occurred at Vavunia, 135 miles
north of Colombo.
India has an estimated 44,000
troops in Sri Lanka to enforce the
July 1987 peace accord aimed at
ending the Tamil secessionist
campaign.
Factional fighting among Tamil
separatist group left at least two
dead and Indian troops killed two
suspected Tamil rebels in Vavunia
district, the officials said.
