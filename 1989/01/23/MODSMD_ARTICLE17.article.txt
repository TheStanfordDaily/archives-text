## Standing ovation 
### 
Stanford fans have
shown they, too, can
make a difference

WERE YOUR EARS ringing
at halftime during Satur
day's basketball game
against UCLA?
So were everyone else's. . . . And
that's the way it should be.
Finally, Stanford fans know just
what an important factor they can
be.
Cardinal faithful used to be
subdued, almost sedated. In the
past, the public address announcer
didn't need to ask the student sec
tion to be seated. They already
were.
Now, the metamorphosis is com
plete. Announcements fall on deaf
ears. Stanford students stand and
cheer for 40 minutes. It's accepted.
It's expected. And the players
relish it.
Maples Pavilion was once a wel
come relief for teams traveling
through the Bay Area. Visiting
squads making the Berkeley-Palo
Alto commute loved their stop on
the Farm. After a hellish night
with the unruly UC-Berkeley
crowd of Harmon Gym, playing at
Maples was like playing at a
neutral site.
Now, the student section gets
warnings for pounding the floor
during opponents' free throws. No
one would've believed it two years
ago.
But that was before last year's
monumental Maples victory. When
Stanford pulled off the upset of
then-No. 1 Arizona, the Cardinal
crowd realized its potential. And it
was then that Stanford players
learned what so many other teams
have known all along — there's
no place like home.

Even The Miami Herald noted
Maples was a difficult place to play
before the Hurricanes were
soundly thumped here last week.
The great Arizona Wildcat forward
Sean Elliott knows how difficult it
is. His team has lost only five times
in the last two seasons — two times
at Maples.
During the Wildcats' visit in the
first week of January, they jumped
out to a 21-4 lead. Two years ago,
the Stanford rooters would've
packed it in. This year, Cardinal
fans rallied the team before a na
tional cable audience. The lead was
down to 10 points at halftime, and
an emotional run at the start of
the second stanza pulled Stanford
ahead. It appeared that the crowd
had willed the Cardinal to victory
that day.
Before another TV audience Sat
urday, the fans were at their best
when the players needed it most.
Reeling from a loss at Berkeley
Thursday, Stanford had to win to
maintain any hope of a Pacific 10
Conference title.
The crowd was deafening. One
incredible moment will be frozen
in time for all those who saw it,
because certainly no one near the
floor could hear it: Stanford had
just finished an scintillating run,
and UCLA's star guard Pooh Rich
ardson could be seen desparately
calling for a timeout. But no one
could hear him. UCLA did not get
its timeout until a referee saw
Richardson motioning out of the
corner of his eye.
And no one will forget seeing
UCLA's Trevor Wilson, rattled by
the haunting chant of "Treeevorrr"
from the student section, commit
three silly fouls and take himself
out of the game early in the first
half.
The Cardinal is undefeated at
home thus far in 1988-89, and
much of the credit goes to the fans
who two years ago regularly sat
on their hands.
