## Tales of a faculty brat 
### 
MY FATHER didn't exactly start
his marriage off on a good foot.
Soon after my parents married,
Mom ventured into my dad's world of
language by enrolling in his Chinese class.
He gave her a B. He said she hadn't
worked hard enough.
Her side of the story, which we have
heard time and again while growing up,
is that she earned an average higher than
that of other students who had received
better grades, and had worked plenty
hard during the busiest time of her life.
My mother was finishing her own dis
sertation. She taught full-time. And to
get to class, she had to take a bus and
then a train across Chicago and then
another bus, or maybe it was two trains
and a bus, and maybe she even rode a
bicycle. Since the story gets worse each
time she tells it, let's just say that she
had a long, long commute.
Last, and worst, she was also carrying
their very-soon-to-be-born first child.
Clearly, giving a seemingly unfair B to
the woman he had married the year
before, a woman with the memory of a
computer, was not the smoothest move
my father has ever made.
So, when I announced that I was taking
Asian Languages 91 from my father, my
mother broke her precedent and inter
vened in my academic life.
"Don't take it," she warned, and again
I heard the story.
I added the class to my study list any
way. The opportunity was too good, too
rare, to be missed.
The teaching assistant for the writing
intensive course was a friend of my fath-

Sometimes after a bold or
entertaining lecture, I
wanted to announce that
he was my father, while
other times I shrunk back
from his sense of humor,
and quietly appreciated
the obscurity of my seat.

er's, and had heard a great deal about
Prof. Lyell's family. Because she read at
least one draft of each one of our four
papers, 1 had to change my first and last
name on papers, in order to be fair.
So for one quarter I became someone
else in her eyes — Judith Granetz, from
my middle name and my mother's maiden
name. If you've never given someone who
doesn't know you a false name, try it.
I couldn't focus on the class the first
week, until I learned to block the History
Corner's nauseating bright computer
grid carpet from my peripheral vision.
A few dizzying days later I managed
to blend with the seats and focus on the
lecture given by the man up front.
He's good. I was drawn into the lec
tures partially because they were inter
esting, and partially because they began
to piece together the names on countless
books that I have grown up with; books
that have lined the walls of my house
and whose authors and titles had, until

then, represented nothing more than
obscurity.
In a sense, the class helped to explain
members of my family. My dad, or Baba
as we called him as we grew up (it's
Chinese for father) often used family
members to describe Confucian philoso
phy, or Mencian ideology.
We often left class together, or met for
lunch. I wanted to explain to the class
that I was simply talking to my dad.
Sometimes after a bold or entertaining
lecture, I wanted to announce that he
was my father, while other times I
shrunk back from his sense of humor,
and quietly appreciated the obscurity of
my seat.
And yes, just as a doctor tends to over
look the health of his own children, I
was in an underprivileged position. Al
though he freely accepts phone calls from
students, he was adverse to my questions
at home.
"No favoritism," he warned.
And in the end, the man who pays my
tuition gave me an A-. Recently he sug
gested that perhaps he had been harder
on me than others, and that perhaps I
had earned better.
I would do it again. After all, now my
mother has a new story to tell.

members of my family. My dad, or Baba
as we called him as we grew up (it's
Chinese for father) often used family
members to describe Confucian philoso
phy, or Mencian ideology.
We often left class together, or met for
lunch. I wanted to explain to the class
that I was simply talking to my dad.
Sometimes after a bold or entertaining
lecture, I wanted to announce that he
was my father, while other times I
shrunk back from his sense of humor,
and quietly appreciated the obscurity of
my seat.
And yes, just as a doctor tends to over
look the health of his own children, I
was in an underprivileged position. Al
though he freely accepts phone calls from
students, he was adverse to my questions
at home.
"No favoritism," he warned.
And in the end, the man who pays my
tuition gave me an A-. Recently he sug
gested that perhaps he had been harder
on me than others, and that perhaps I
had earned better.
I would do it again. After all, now my
mother has a new story to tell.
