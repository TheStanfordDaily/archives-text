## Research Animal Facility presents potential hazard 
### 
IN HIS KEYNOTE ADDRESS to a
recent conference of the American
Association for the Advancement of
Science, University President Donald
Kennedy spoke of "hostile forces," such
as "the creationists, the right-to-life
advocates . . . and the animal liberation
crowd." He spoke of the construction
of two Stanford facilities being
"delayed by animal rights activists."
We at the Palo Alto Humane Society
were instrumental in what caused the
construction delay, and therefore, in
the interest of getting a fair and
balanced picture, it behooves us to set
the record straight.
In May 1987 we learned that Stan
ford University had applied for a con
struction permit for an addition to its
present Research Animal Facility. RAF
1 is a facility in which research
animals are contained entirely under
ground, underneath a parking lot.
This is also to be true of RAF 2,
which will house, not only mice and
rats, but also dogs, cats, primates and,
very likely, farm animals.
In 1985 Congress had passed an
amendment to the Animal Welfare Act
which would mandate, once its regula
tions were implemented, exercise for
dogs and provisions for "the psychologi
cal well-being of primates."
The implementation of this has so
far been held up by strenuous efforts
against it by the biomedical communi
ty. Our examination of the plans for
RAF 2 aroused our concern that the
facility as envisioned would not comply
with this federal law and the will of
Congress once they were put into
effect.
It was on those grounds that we
made representation before the Plan
ning Commission of Santa Clara
County, which, nevertheless, passed
favorably upon the facility.
In the process of looking at the
plans we discovered, to our consider-

able astonishment, that no environmen
tal impact report had been required of
the facility.
RAF 2 will be ancillary to Stanford's
new Center for Molecular and Genetic
Medicine. It seemed to us only reason
able to insure that all precautions be
taken in a facility designed to house
animals used in work which, for all its
possible benefits, will also be creating

organisms not so benign and capable of
reproduction, mutation and prolifera
tion, and which could be neither con
strained nor recalled.
Stanford's record on health and
safety issues is not a reassuring one.
The University has been accused of
legal violations, intimidation and cover
up in health and safety matters. Both
its own internal audit and an indepen

dent one conducted by the Stanford
Research Institute revealed egregious
failures of equipment, operation and
supervision.
Stanford researchers have already
created mice that genetically carry the
AIDS virus. Supposing such mice were
to escape into the community?
RAF 2, located in a zone in which a
powerful earthquake in the foreseeable
future is considered not just a possibil
ity, but a strong probability, will house
animals for work with diseases such as
dysentery and anthrax. Supposing an
earthquake caused the escape of such
organisms into the groundwater?
Stanford has had contracts for bio
logical warfare work and, according to
the U.S. Army Medical Research and
Development Command in Fort
Detrick, Md., is still working with
toxins in expeirments akin to those
conducted for the Department of De
fense by the Letterman Army Institute
for Research. Supposing those entered
either the air or water of the commu
nity?
It was on these grounds that we
appealed our County Planning Commis
sion's decision to the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors, who,
upon due and lengthy consideration
and hearing from representatives of
both Stanford and the community,
mandated that, according to the Cali
fornia Environmental Quality Act, an
Environmental Impact Report be
produced for RAF 2.
We have never demanded that either
of these two facilities not be built, or
not be built in their proposed loca
tions. All we have sought is that Stan
ford be accountable to the public and
that it comply with county, state and
federal law.
