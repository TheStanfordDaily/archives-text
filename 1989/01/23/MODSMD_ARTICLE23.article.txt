## Student program creates bonds between U.S. and Japan Exchanging sunsets and lifestyles for 30 years 
### Jay Pinto 
It has been said that Stanford
follows the sun. Indeed, the rising
sun has captured the campus and
lead it to Japan for more than 30
years.
While there has been much
hoopla surrounding the opening
of Stanford's Overseas Studies
Program in Kyoto next fall, less
well-known is its precursor, a
student-run Japanese exchange
program begun in the 1950s by
a Stanford professor.
The Stanford-Keio Exchange
Committee, a non-profit student
group receiving some ASSU fund
ing, arranges for several Japanese
college students every spring to
visit Stanford and witness Amer
ican life.
In addition, the committee
sends Stanford students to Keio
University in Tokyo where the
Japanese chapter of the group or
ganizes the visit.
Much of the history of the be
ginning of the program is also the
personal story of James Watkins
111, professor emeritus in the His
tory Department.
Watkins was a freshman at
Stanford in 1925, and after grad
uation went to Japan to teach

English at a Buddhist school in
Kansai in southwest Japan.
There, he met many young
businessmen, also fresh out of col
lege, most of whom were Keio
Univers.ty graduates.
He speaks affectionately of "the
Keio boys" from whom he got the
idea of establishing a sister-school
exchange program between Stan
ford and Keio.
Watkins returned to the United
States and became a history pro
fessor at here in the early 19505.
After the occupation of Japan
after World War 11, Watkins was
one of a group of Stanford pro
fessors who were the first aca
demics allowed into Japan back
then.
The professors toured and lec
tured in Japan. At that time, Wat
kins visited Keio University, met
with its president and laid the
groundwork for the exchange pro
gram that continues today.
The exchange program to Keio
provides an alternative for stu
dents who want to go to Japan,
but might not have the time or
the credentials to participate in
Stanford's new Kyoto program.
Unlike the Overseas Studies pro
gram, the Keio exchange does not
have a language requirement, and

is not academically oriented.
Students live with a Japanese
family for about two weeks while
they are in Tokyo. Although only
one American university officially
sends students to Keio, other
chapters of the committee around
the world arrange for exchanges
such as those at Stanford. Last
year, four Stanford students went
to Japan along with two from Cor
nell, three from Canada, two from

Hong Kong and three from Fin
land.
"It was one of the best times
of my life. They make you feel
really special since there are so
many people in the organization
in Japan," says senior Mia
Johnson, chair of the committee.
She notes that at the Japanese
end they were disappointed to
receive so few Stanford students.
More students should take ad
vantage of the program, she says,
since most Japanese understand
English and because exchange
participants are not required to
speak Japanese.
In addition, Keio University
students plan activites for the
visiting American students almost
every day they are in Japan.
Because the students stay with
Japanese families, the cost of the
non-profit program is much less
than independent travel to Japan.
And committee members suggest
that this host family arrangement
provides freer exposure to
Japanese life — with no attach
ments to a Stanford group and no
travel restrictions — than avail
able through the Overseas pro
grams.
"One of the best ways to realize
that people all over the world are

basically the same is to meet them
first-hand," says Johnson.
"It's also a good way to break
through much of the caricatured
reporting done by the media about
Japanese," adds junior Will
Kasumi, also a member of the
committee.
In the past, the group on
campus has organized cultural se
ries, open to all Stanford students,
with speakers such as Anthropol
ogy Prof. Harumi Befu, who leads
discussions on American-
Japanese relations.
The arrival of the visitors is
eagerly awaited by committee or
ganizers. "You make new friends
and it's a whole lot of fun," says
Stefani Tomono, who is secretary
for the group.
"We go skiing, camping and raf
ting, among other things, with the
Japanese students and we learn
a lot of things about Japan that
just can't be taught in the class
room," she adds.
"The Japanese students speak
English very well and so we talk
about things such as dating in
Japan and how Japanese feel
about racism," says Tomono.
"You also foster cross cultural
understanding in a direct way.
Last year, even after we all got

to be friends, a Stanford student
cracked a semi-dirty joke in front
of everyone which offended the
Japanese. Afterwards, both sides
understood one of the biggest cul
tural differences between Japan
and America."
"When Stanford-Keio Commit
tee members decide to go to Japan
like I did, [the Japanese exchange
students] really show their appre
ciation by welcoming you and
taking you around in Japan," says
committee member Mari Shimizu.
Although the burgeoning busi
ness opportunities with Japan
have aroused a resounding inter
est in the country only recently,
the Keio committee has existed
on campus for more than 30
years.
Susan Morita, a member of the
committee in 1981-82, says"it
amazes me that this program has
lasted for almost 30 years on the
strength of a handful of students
coming together every year and
deciding it's going to work one
more time."
The Keio Committee is holding
an organizational meeting Tues
day, Jan. 24 in the Aspen room
in Tresidder Union. Everyone is
welcome.

the world arrange for exchanges
such as those at Stanford. Last
year, four Stanford students went
to Japan along with two from Cor
nell, three from Canada, two from

Hong Kong and three from Fin
land.
"It was one of the best times
of my life. They make you feel
really special since there are so
many people in the organization
in Japan," says senior Mia
Johnson, chair of the committee.
She notes that at the Japanese
end they were disappointed to
receive so few Stanford students.
More students should take ad
vantage of the program, she says,
since most Japanese understand
English and because exchange
participants are not required to
speak Japanese.
In addition, Keio University
students plan activites for the
visiting American students almost
every day they are in Japan.
Because the students stay with
Japanese families, the cost of the
non-profit program is much less
than independent travel to Japan.
And committee members suggest
that this host family arrangement
provides freer exposure to
Japanese life — with no attach
ments to a Stanford group and no
travel restrictions — than avail
able through the Overseas pro
grams.
"One of the best ways to realize
that people all over the world are

basically the same is to meet them
first-hand," says Johnson.
"It's also a good way to break
through much of the caricatured
reporting done by the media about
Japanese," adds junior Will
Kasumi, also a member of the
committee.
In the past, the group on
campus has organized cultural se
ries, open to all Stanford students,
with speakers such as Anthropol
ogy Prof. Harumi Befu, who leads
discussions on American-
Japanese relations.
The arrival of the visitors is
eagerly awaited by committee or
ganizers. "You make new friends
and it's a whole lot of fun," says
Stefani Tomono, who is secretary
for the group.
"We go skiing, camping and raf
ting, among other things, with the
Japanese students and we learn
a lot of things about Japan that
just can't be taught in the class
room," she adds.
"The Japanese students speak
English very well and so we talk
about things such as dating in
Japan and how Japanese feel
about racism," says Tomono.
"You also foster cross cultural
understanding in a direct way.
Last year, even after we all got

to be friends, a Stanford student
cracked a semi-dirty joke in front
of everyone which offended the
Japanese. Afterwards, both sides
understood one of the biggest cul
tural differences between Japan
and America."
"When Stanford-Keio Commit
tee members decide to go to Japan
like I did, [the Japanese exchange
students] really show their appre
ciation by welcoming you and
taking you around in Japan," says
committee member Mari Shimizu.
Although the burgeoning busi
ness opportunities with Japan
have aroused a resounding inter
est in the country only recently,
the Keio committee has existed
on campus for more than 30
years.
Susan Morita, a member of the
committee in 1981-82, says"it
amazes me that this program has
lasted for almost 30 years on the
strength of a handful of students
coming together every year and
deciding it's going to work one
more time."
The Keio Committee is holding
an organizational meeting Tues
day, Jan. 24 in the Aspen room
in Tresidder Union. Everyone is
welcome.

It has been said that Stanford
follows the sun. Indeed, the rising
sun has captured the campus and
lead it to Japan for more than 30
years.
While there has been much
hoopla surrounding the opening
of Stanford's Overseas Studies
Program in Kyoto next fall, less
well-known is its precursor, a
student-run Japanese exchange
program begun in the 1950s by
a Stanford professor.
The Stanford-Keio Exchange
Committee, a non-profit student
group receiving some ASSU fund
ing, arranges for several Japanese
college students every spring to
visit Stanford and witness Amer
ican life.
In addition, the committee
sends Stanford students to Keio
University in Tokyo where the
Japanese chapter of the group or
ganizes the visit.
Much of the history of the be
ginning of the program is also the
personal story of James Watkins
111, professor emeritus in the His
tory Department.
Watkins was a freshman at
Stanford in 1925, and after grad
uation went to Japan to teach

English at a Buddhist school in
Kansai in southwest Japan.
There, he met many young
businessmen, also fresh out of col
lege, most of whom were Keio
Univers.ty graduates.
He speaks affectionately of "the
Keio boys" from whom he got the
idea of establishing a sister-school
exchange program between Stan
ford and Keio.
Watkins returned to the United
States and became a history pro
fessor at here in the early 19505.
After the occupation of Japan
after World War 11, Watkins was
one of a group of Stanford pro
fessors who were the first aca
demics allowed into Japan back
then.
The professors toured and lec
tured in Japan. At that time, Wat
kins visited Keio University, met
with its president and laid the
groundwork for the exchange pro
gram that continues today.
The exchange program to Keio
provides an alternative for stu
dents who want to go to Japan,
but might not have the time or
the credentials to participate in
Stanford's new Kyoto program.
Unlike the Overseas Studies pro
gram, the Keio exchange does not
have a language requirement, and

is not academically oriented.
Students live with a Japanese
family for about two weeks while
they are in Tokyo. Although only
one American university officially
sends students to Keio, other
chapters of the committee around
the world arrange for exchanges
such as those at Stanford. Last
year, four Stanford students went
to Japan along with two from Cor
nell, three from Canada, two from

Hong Kong and three from Fin
land.
