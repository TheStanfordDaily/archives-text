# Martial artists give Pacific twist to American bodies

Both Doshin So's art and philosophy have
little sympathy for the flock of sheep that
might be kicked about by a lone wolf. For
although there is strength in numbers, there
is no security.
For So and Shorinji Kempo — the martial
arts style he created in post-war Japan — the
essence of strength "lies in self-development
— quality, not quantity."
What sets Shorinji Kempo apart from the
entire flock of Japanese martial arts is its
emphasis on non-competitive instruction.
After World War 11, most of the martial arts
in Japan became contest sports, according to
Yuji Harada, an instructor for the Shorinji
Kempo club in San Francisco.
Today the popularity of Shorinji Kempo
soars with one million regular members and
more than 13,000 individual clubs in Japan
alone. In the United States there are several
hundred members and 15 organizations, three
of which are located in the Bay Area.
Harada attributed its popularity to the
uniquely combined physical and philosophical
aspects of the art.
Kempo combines the punching, kicking,
blocking and striking — practiced in more
familiar martial arts like karate, kung fu and

aikido — with throwing, twisting and escape
maneuvers.
But rather than sheer force, the moves push
the limits of the body's natural range of mo
tion to work "against" a partner. Harada ex
plained that in Kempo, leverage against a
partner's joints is used as a tool to replace
brute strength.
Many Kempo tactics capitalize on the body's
involuntary reactions to pain by targetting
specific nerve centers and pressure points.
According to Kempo doctrine, there are over
130 pressure points on the human body, many
of which can be pushed to inflict excruciating
pain.
A select few are almost never revealed. And
some of these hidden pressure points, when
struck at a particular angle, are said to
produce certain death — even after a delay
of three years.
Accompanying the physical side of Shorinji
Kempo is a rich philosophy of self
improvement. Jeffrey Livingston, a San Fran
cisco attorney and third-degree blackbelt,
pointed to the balance of meditation and phys
ical exercise in Kempo that have kept him
actively involved for the past 12 years.
"It is practiced in the hope that people who
study it will learn and develop true strength,
true courage, self- confidence, compassion and

the ability to act," said Livingston.
Even the history of Shorinji Kempo testifies
to the importance of compassion and self
sufficiency.
When Doshin So began teaching Kempo in
occupied Japan after World War 11, he was
struggling to restore strength and a sense of
patriotism in the defeated youth of his coun
try, according to Gassho, a newsletter of the
World Shorinji Kempo Organization.
By integrating the techniques of a Chinese
martial art form known as Luohan Quan and
his personal interpretation of Zen Buddhist
philosophy, So laid the non-competitive foun
dation of Shorinji Kempo.
According to Gassho, So set a precedent.
Kempo became the first martial art in Japan
to champion self-improvement over competi
tion. "Its purpose lay not in downing others
or winning in competitions, but rather in win
ning over one's own weaknesses, developing
one's mind and body, and enjoying the
pleasures of both one's own technical progress
and that of those around one."
He is currently planning to start a club at
Stanford for those interested. There will be
an organizational meeting in the second floor
lounge of Tresidder Union on Jan. 26 at 7:00
p.m.
