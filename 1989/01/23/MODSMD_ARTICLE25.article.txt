## Cardinal starts new winning streak against UCLA 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
With 7:11 to go in Saturday's
game against UCLA, Stanford
guard Todd Lichti stepped to the
free-throw line for yet another
shot at immortality.
Men's Basketball
Cardinal 84, Bruins 75
In the first half, Lichti had tied
the Pacific 10 Conference record

for consecutive free throws made,
held by John Greig of Oregon
(1980-81, 1981-82 seasons), at 40.
The senior had not missed a foul
shot in 1989.
But on this attempt, the front
end of a one-and-one situation,
Lichti pulled back on it just a bit.
The ball rimmed out and fell away
from the twine. The sellout crowd
of 7,500 at Maples Pavilion let
out a collective sigh.
But Lichti did an interesting
thing less than three minutes lat
er. Put in another one-and-one
situation, Lichti swiftly and surely

sank them both. Just like that,
another streak was born.
It was much like that for Stan
ford basketball in general last
weekend. When the team lost at
California Thursday night, ending
an eight-game winning streak, the
Stanford community groaned.
But with Saturday's 84-75 Pac
-10 win over UCLA, Stanford
opened up a new one-game win
ning streak, and proved that it's
not going to let little setbacks get
the team down in pursuit of the
Pac-10 title.
"During the winning streak, we
were riding kind of high, getting
kind of loose," Stanford forward
Howard Wright said. "(After the
loss), coach said now there would
be no screwing around. . . . Coach
was upset but cautious we didn't
get down on ourselves."
"Coach", that is to say, Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery, was
pleased with the team's response
to the temporary adversity of Cal.
"We didn't think we had played
with the kind of emotion or in
tensity we started the year with,"
Montgomery said. "One thing we
didn't want to be is outhustled."
Hustle was hardly a worry, as
the Cardinal set a season high
with 11 steals. The team also shot
57.1 percent for the game, includ
ing 63.6 in the second half, and
had five players in double figures
in scoring, led by Lichti's 18. On
the down side, Stanford was out
rebounded for the second straight
game, 33-25.
And by the way, since Oregon's
Creig set his free-throw standard
over two seasons, Lichti techni
cally qualified Saturday for the
Pac-10 single-season consecutive
free-throw record. So, Todd the
God, this Bud's for you.
With the win, Stanford passed
UCLA and moved into second
place in the Pac-10 at 6-2, one
game behind 7-1 Arizona. The
Cardinal, which figures to lose its
No. 20 Associated Press ranking
today due to the loss at Cal, is
now 14-4 overall. UCLA slips to
10-5 overall, 5-2 and third place
in the Pac-10.
Stanford hosts Oregon Thurs
day night before its showdown
with Arizona at Tucson Sunday.
The game turned early when

UCLA's Trevor Wilson and Pooh
Richardson got in foul trouble in
the first half. After Stanford
guard Terry Taylor hit a 24-foot
3-pointer to eliminate UCLA's last
lead of the game and knot the
score at 8-8, Wilson committed
his third personal foul at the
15:57 mark and had to leave for
almost the entire half.
Stanford took the lead for good
just over four minutes later at
14-12 when Wright slam-dunked
off a pass from freshman forward
Adam Keefe. Then, after another
Wright dunk, Richardson was
whistled for an offensive foul, also
knocking him out for most of the
half.
With Wilson averaging 18.9
points and 8.1 rebounds per game
and Richardson at 14.6 ppg and
7.5 assists per game, everyone in
Maples seemed to know what a
blow had been dealt to UCLA.
But with this advantage going
Stanford's way, the Bruins, to
their credit, hung tough despite
getting only three points com
bined from the two in the first
half.
Freshman Don Mac Lean, him
self averaging over 20 points and
eight boards per game, had 13
first-half points, and 5-foot-ll
classmate Darrick Martin
switched from shooting guard to
point guard and ran the offense
effectively.
Still, Stanford led 42-31 at
halftime, and even with Wilson
and Richardson back in the
lineup, the lead was boosted to
15 within the first three minutes
of the second half.
Richardson fouled out, on the
play that set up Lichti's ill-fated
free-throw attempt, with 7:11 to
go in the game, but not even that
could eliminate UCLA. After the
teams traded baskets, the pint
sized Martin once again defied
death, and some would say logical
thinking, by slashing through the
lane past the trees of Stanford's
front line. Martin's layup cut
Stanford's lead to 69-63 with 5:35
left.
But Lichti responded with a
jumper just inside the 3-point line

at the top of the key, and soon
after began his new consecutive
free-throw streak (now at two).
Wright then scored a 3-point play
on a basket and foul by Mac Lean,
to boost the score to 76-63 with
4:01 left. UCLA never got closer
than eight points the rest of the
way.
Wilson had 16 points in the sec
ond half for the Bruins.

With 7:11 to go in Saturday's
game against UCLA, Stanford
guard Todd Lichti stepped to the
free-throw line for yet another
shot at immortality.
Men's Basketball
Cardinal 84, Bruins 75
In the first half, Lichti had tied
the Pacific 10 Conference record

for consecutive free throws made,
held by John Greig of Oregon
(1980-81, 1981-82 seasons), at 40.
The senior had not missed a foul
shot in 1989.
But on this attempt, the front
end of a one-and-one situation,
Lichti pulled back on it just a bit.
The ball rimmed out and fell away
from the twine. The sellout crowd
of 7,500 at Maples Pavilion let
out a collective sigh.
But Lichti did an interesting
thing less than three minutes lat
er. Put in another one-and-one
situation, Lichti swiftly and surely

sank them both. Just like that,
another streak was born.
It was much like that for Stan
ford basketball in general last
weekend. When the team lost at
California Thursday night, ending
an eight-game winning streak, the
Stanford community groaned.
But with Saturday's 84-75 Pac
-10 win over UCLA, Stanford
opened up a new one-game win
ning streak, and proved that it's
not going to let little setbacks get
the team down in pursuit of the
Pac-10 title.
"During the winning streak, we
were riding kind of high, getting
kind of loose," Stanford forward
Howard Wright said. "(After the
loss), coach said now there would
be no screwing around. . . . Coach
was upset but cautious we didn't
get down on ourselves."
"Coach", that is to say, Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery, was
pleased with the team's response
to the temporary adversity of Cal.
"We didn't think we had played
with the kind of emotion or in
tensity we started the year with,"
Montgomery said. "One thing we
didn't want to be is outhustled."
Hustle was hardly a worry, as
the Cardinal set a season high
with 11 steals. The team also shot
57.1 percent for the game, includ
ing 63.6 in the second half, and
had five players in double figures
in scoring, led by Lichti's 18. On
the down side, Stanford was out
rebounded for the second straight
game, 33-25.
And by the way, since Oregon's
Creig set his free-throw standard
over two seasons, Lichti techni
cally qualified Saturday for the
Pac-10 single-season consecutive
free-throw record. So, Todd the
God, this Bud's for you.
With the win, Stanford passed
UCLA and moved into second
place in the Pac-10 at 6-2, one
game behind 7-1 Arizona. The
Cardinal, which figures to lose its
No. 20 Associated Press ranking
today due to the loss at Cal, is
now 14-4 overall. UCLA slips to
10-5 overall, 5-2 and third place
in the Pac-10.

The game turned early when

UCLA's Trevor Wilson and Pooh
Richardson got in foul trouble in
the first half. After Stanford
guard Terry Taylor hit a 24-foot
3-pointer to eliminate UCLA's last
lead of the game and knot the
score at 8-8, Wilson committed
his third personal foul at the
15:57 mark and had to leave for
almost the entire half.
Stanford took the lead for good
just over four minutes later at
14-12 when Wright slam-dunked
off a pass from freshman forward
Adam Keefe. Then, after another
Wright dunk, Richardson was
whistled for an offensive foul, also
knocking him out for most of the
half.
With Wilson averaging 18.9
points and 8.1 rebounds per game
and Richardson at 14.6 ppg and
7.5 assists per game, everyone in
Maples seemed to know what a
blow had been dealt to UCLA.
But with this advantage going
Stanford's way, the Bruins, to
their credit, hung tough despite
getting only three points com
bined from the two in the first
half.
Freshman Don Mac Lean, him
self averaging over 20 points and
eight boards per game, had 13
first-half points, and 5-foot-ll
classmate Darrick Martin
switched from shooting guard to
point guard and ran the offense
effectively.
Still, Stanford led 42-31 at
halftime, and even with Wilson
and Richardson back in the
lineup, the lead was boosted to
15 within the first three minutes
of the second half.
Richardson fouled out, on the
play that set up Lichti's ill-fated
free-throw attempt, with 7:11 to
go in the game, but not even that
could eliminate UCLA. After the
teams traded baskets, the pint
sized Martin once again defied
death, and some would say logical
thinking, by slashing through the
lane past the trees of Stanford's
front line. Martin's layup cut
Stanford's lead to 69-63 with 5:35
left.
But Lichti responded with a
jumper just inside the 3-point line
