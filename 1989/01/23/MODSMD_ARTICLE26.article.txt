# Tough defense inside ruffles UCLA's feathers
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Sometimes, the statistics just
don't tell the story.
Saturday's Stanford-UCLA
game provides a classic illus
tration.
• Stanford, a team who's suc
cess resides on outrebounding
its opponents, was out
rebounded 33-25 by UCLA.
• Todd Lichti, the straw that
stirs the drink known as the
Cardinal, shot 6-of-16 from the
field and was held three points
below his season average. He
also missed a free throw for
the first time in 41 attempts.
• Normally accurate from
outside the 3-point arc, the
Cardinal attempted only seven
treys — and hit only a pair.
Terry Taylor, the most prolific
of Stanford's long-range bomb
ers made two 2-pointers. They
were only his ninth and 10th
of the entire season.
Still, the Cardinal won fairly
handily, 84-75. And a good deal
of that victory can be attrib
uted to a facet of the game
that is virtually invisible in the
box score: defense.
Most notably, the defense of
sophomore forward Andrew
Vlahov. The 6-foot-7, 225
pound Australian spent most
of the second half covering
UCLA's 6-10 freshman sensa
tion Don Mac Lean.
Mac Lean came into the game
with a 20.8 points per game
average. After lighting up the
scoreboard for 13 points in the
first half he seemed certain to
better that mark.
But Vlahov had another idea.
"He was real effective in the
first half," Vlahov noted.
"It was a matter of shutting
him down in the second
half. . . . Doing whatever it
takes," he added.

Vlahov's heavy
handed defense
seemed to rattle the
freshman and
Mac Lean's frustra
tion manifested it
self in some chatter.

Vlahov's heavy-handed de
fense seemed to rattle the
freshman and Mac Lean's frus
tration manifested itself in
some chatter.
"He likes to talk a fair bit,"
Vlahov said. "He's got a few
things to learn as far as
keeping his cool. . . keeping his
mental set."
Mac Lean said he felt the of
ficiating was "unfair" and that
the refs should've have 1) called
more fouls on Stanford or 2)
called fewer of the fouls that
got UCLA forward Trevor Wil
son and UCLA guard Pooh
Richardson in early foul trou
ble.
For his own part, Richardson
said he expected the physical
play and didn't mind it.
"There's no finesse to their
play," Richardson said about
Vlahov, Howard Wright and
the Stanford club in general.
"They just play hard.
"They don't look for any out
lets, they just take it to you,"
he added. "I enjoyed it."
Card notes
The Cardinal, almost exclusively
a man-to-man team on defense,
played a good deal of zone in the
second half.
It was effective in limiting some
of UCLA's options, though fresh
man guard Darrick Martin had a
few easy baskets penetrating to the
hoop.
