The curtain went up on a new
movie over the weekend, "A
Nightmare on Campus Drive."
Women's Swimming
Cardinal 110, Bruins 30
Cardinal 124, Trojans 16
The women's swim teams from
both UCLA and USC came to
deGuerre Pool to face the Cardi
nal but left perhaps wishing they
had faced Freddy Krueger in
stead.
On Friday, Stanford buried the
ninth-ranked Bruins 110-30 and
the slaughter in the water con
tinued Saturday when the No. 2
Cardinal crushed the 17th
ranked Trojans 124-16.
Stanford is now 2-0 overall, 2-0
in the Pacific 10 Conference.
UCLA is 7-1, 2-1, and USC is 5-4,
1-3.
For the weekend, Stanford won
30 of 32 events, had one-two-three
sweeps in 17 of 28 individual
events, had four one-two-three

four-five sweeps, and, most im
portantly, qualified eight swim
mers for the NCAA Champion
ships, Mar. 16-18 in Indianapolis.
"It was a great total team ef
fort," Coach Richard Quick said
after his first dual meet at the
helm of the Cardinal. "I couldn't
be more happy with our perform
ances."
Leading the way were four
triple winners: seniors Aimee Ber
zins and Jenna Johnson, junior
Katie Connors and sophomore Mi
chelle Griglione. But in addition
to these results from veterans,
several freshmen made auspi
scious debuts.
Karen Kraemer won the '200-
yard freestyle Friday and quali
fied for the NCAA meet with her
time in the 400 individual medley
Saturday. Eva Mortensen won the
1,000 free Friday, took second in
the 1,650 and third in the 500
Saturday.
Jamie Rugless took the 200 but
terfly Friday and had a pair of
seconds, and Susan Johnson took
the 200 breaststroke Friday and
added two seconds and a third.
But Saturday it was the veter
ans' turn to shine. Berzins won

the 50 and 100 free back-to-back,
going under the NCAA qualifying
standard in both and setting a
pool record of 23.27 seconds in
the 50.
"I'm really pleased," she said.
"This is the fastest I've swum at
the first meet of the year ever. I
swam a 22.9 my junior year in
high school but I haven't been
that fast yet here. I'm feeling
really strong now, though. I have
a feeling I'll be able to go 22 easy.
I have this feeling in my bones
that NGAAs is going to be really
exciting."
Connors was the other high
light, winning both the one- and
three-meter springboard events,
setting a school record in the lat
ter. Connors won the one-meter
the day before by scoring a 7.5
and an 8 on her final dive to beat
Bruin Britt Williams 173.7 to
172.0. Connors took second to
Williams in Friday's three-meter
competition.
Jenna Johnson took the 200
free and the 100 fly, coming in
under the NCAA cut both times.
Junior Susannah Miller also was

Aimee Berzins symbolized Stanford's dominance over its opponents this weekend, winning all three
events she swam in, qualifying for the NCAA Championships in all three, and setting a deGuerre
Pool record in the 50-yard freestyle.
a pleasant surprise, upsetting
senior Michelle Donahue in both
the 100 and 200 backstrokes and
qualifying as well. Donahue won

both events Friday and qualified
herself then.
Qualifying "just gets the season
going right," Donahue said.
"Since I'd done that before in
workout (practice times don't
count for qualifying), it's good to
do it again."
In the first individual race Sat

urday, sophomore Barb Metz took
her turn in the spotlight, running
away from the field in the 1,650
free, qualifying and winning.
"It felt really smooth," she said.
"I took 14 seconds off my best
time so that makes me really hap
py. ... I know I'll go much faster
(later in the season). That's what

makes me happy."
Senior captain Susan Lenth won
the 100 breaststroke, while junior
Jill Johnson won the 200 breast
stroke and qualified for NCAAs
in the process. After that, class
mate Dana Anderson led the
whole way to win the 500 free.
