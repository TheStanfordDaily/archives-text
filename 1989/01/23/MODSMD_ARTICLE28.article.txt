# Women win physical battle against Bears
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
It certainly wasn't pretty, but
at least it counts as a win. In a
game marred by the insufferable
rantings of an unsportsmanlike
California Coach Gooch Foster
Women's Basketball
Cardinal 77, Golden Bears 59
and incessant fouling, the No. 7
Stanford women's basketball
team rebounded from a 10-point
deficit at halftime to earn a hard
fought win over Cal at Maples
Pavilion Friday night, prevailing
77-59 in front of a spirited crowd
of 1,450.
The victory keeps Stanford's
unbeaten Pacific 10 Conference
record intact at 5-0 while improv
ing the squad's overall record to
13-2. The Bears fall to 7-8, 2-3.
After 20 minutes of play, how
ever, it seemed as if the visitors
would walk away with the "W."
The contest was tight for most of
the half, with the lead shifting
often.
With five minutes remaining

before the buzzer and Stanford
leading 22-19, Cal came alive.
Sparked by the keen 3-point shoot
ing of junior Chris Holten, who
sank two from well behind the
line, the Bears rolled off 13 un
answered points and held a 32-22
advantage heading into the locker
room.
Stanford Coach Tara VanDer
veer was displeased, to say the
least. Typically calm, VanDerveer
gave her team a halftime taik to
remember.
"I can't tell you (what I said),
because you can't put it in your
paper," VanDerveer revealed. "I
was just this side of furious. I
mean, I was very upset with the
effort I saw from our team. I think
some people heard some things
they maybe haven't heard from
me before.
"I was very disappointed with
our first-half effort and I tried to
point out some specific things we
needed to do better in terms of
defensive intensity and rebound
ing, working our offense instead
of going one-on-one and wild, and
making a commitment to play the
game."
The team responded. Scoring
two buckets in the first minute

of play, the Cardinal squeaked its
way back until two key free
throws by forward Katy Steding
tied the score at 39 with 11:52
left to go.
Just 24 seconds later, the best
play of the game finally broke the
deficit. Stanford guard Jennifer
Azzi, circling the top of the key,
was tripped up by a Cal defender.
Before falling, however, Azzi ex
ecuted a quick behind-the-back
bounce pass to Sonja Henning,
who squared up and shot a rare
3-pointer that found no inter
ference but net. The Cardinal held
a tenuous 42-41 lead, but the mo
mentum had clearly shifted ir
reversibly toward the host with
the key basket by Henning.
The sophomore guard finished
the game with a game-high 18
points. Azzi notched 15 to ac
cmpany her seven assists and four
steals, while Steding tallied 14
more scores.
But the real spark came from
an unexpected source, freshman
forward/center Julie Zeilstra.
Shooting 6-for-7 from the field
and 2-for-4 from the line, Zeilstra
netted 14 points, eight rebounds
and two steals in just 21 minutes
of action.

"Sonja had a great game, but
the person that turned it around
for us was Julie," VanDerveer
said. "I think she offensively
scored, defensively she made
rebounds and was in the right
position. That was what I thought
really did it."
But it was the emotion and at
titude of the entire squad that
erased the first-half failings.
Lackadaisical at first, the Cardi
nal cagers regrouped at halftime
and emerged a more intense and
aware team.
"We came out and were aggres
sive in the second half," Zeilstra
said. "In the first half, we were
tentative and didn't play our
game. In the second half, we
pulled out everything."
Card notes
As much as some of the fnns were
rooting for a Cardinal comeback,
many were also awaiting for the
referees to place the magic letter "T"
in the face of Foster. Clearly unhappy
with the amount of fouls called
against her squad and frustrated with
Cal's evaporating advantage, Foster
ranted and raved and didn't set foot
off the court until after being whistled
for her second technical foul.
