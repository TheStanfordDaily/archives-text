# Hanan, spikers bounce Loyola Marymount
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Scott Fortune may have started
a trend.
Fortune, a senior on the men's
volleyball team, was a member of
the 1988 U.S. men's Olympic
team. And if junior Dan Hanan

Men's Volleyball
Cardinal 3, Lions 1
keeps playing the way he did Sat
urday, Hanan will be the Cardi
nal's next Olympian.
Hanan, a 6-foot-5 middle blocker,

had 40 kills and hit a phenomenal
.524 to lead the fourth-ranked
Cardinal to a 15-11, 16-14, 15-17,
15-4 victory over Loyola Mary
mount Saturday night at Maples
Pavilion.
The match opened the Western
Intercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion season for Stanford. After the
win the Cardinal is 1-0 overall
(the two early-season tourna
ments do not count because
Canadian teams were involved).
The Lions are 1-2 overall, 0-2
in WIVA.
Stanford started only one
player who played for the team
last year, Hanan, and got off to
a shaky start, but the team con
tinued to improve thoughout the
match.
"Going into it some of the guys
were pretty nervous," redshirt
freshman setter Ryan O'Hara
said. "They surprised me by play
ing so well. We started kind of
slow. In the fourth game we
played like we're capable of play
ing."
Joining O'Hara in the starting
lineup were Hanan, Fortune (who
stopped out last year) and fresh
men Duncan Blackman, Doug
Walquist and Chris Wrede. But
the young guys held their own
and Hanan and Fortune, the two
veterans, always made their pres
ence felt in the big moments.
Hanan had 10 digs and a match
high eight blocks to go along with
his 40 kills. Fortune had 24 kills,
two service aces, 14 digs and seven
blocks.
"I noticed right away [that
Hanan was having a good night],"
O'Hara said. "At first, when I was
setting the D's, the backrow set,
they weren't getting anyone up
(blocking) on it, then they were
only getting one up on it. With
Hanan, if you only send one guy
up, he's going to beat you most
of the time."
The first two games were rather
similar, with the Cardinal staying
one or two points ahead the whole
time. With Stanford trailing 4-5

in the third game, Coach Fred
Sturm pulled O'Hara and
replaced him with junior Parker
Blackman, the starter for the past
season and a half. The teams
stayed even to 8-8, then Hanan
took over.
He combined with Fortune for
a block, had two kills, saw a Lion
touch the net then combined with
Fortune for another block to make
it 13-8. Then Sio Saipaia hit wide,
trying to go around another
Hanan-Fortune block and it was
match point.
The Lions then saved seven
match points, caught up, took the
lead, and then a Danny Mclnerny
kill gave them the game.
With O'Hara back on the floor
in game four, it was all Stanford.
The Cardinal started pouring it
on, the Lions got frustrated, and
finally Siapaia got a red card for
unsportsmanlike conduct arguing
a call. The automatic point that
came with it made it 10-4 and
Stanford ran out the game.
Appropriately enough, after two
hours, 28 minutes, Hanan hit
through the LMU block for the
final point.
Saipaia led Loyola Marymount
with 30 kills and 13 digs and Chris
Young added 18 kills, a .469 hit
ting percentage and 14 digs.
Duncan Blackman had 13 kills,
hit .308 and recorded a match
high 18 digs for the Cardinal.
Walquist added 11 kills and hit
.435.
O'Hara, who didn't know he
was starting until the pregame
meeting, didn't play like a player
in his first conference match. He
finished with an ace, 12 digs and
74 assists, a huge total consider
ing he played less than 3V* games.
"I decided that I was just going
to be aggresive, go for it."
He feels the team is starting
off on the right foot, and although
the team had some difficulties
passing, O'Hara thinks that, and
everything else, will get better
with time.

season and a half. The teams
stayed even to 8-8, then Hanan
took over.
He combined with Fortune for
a block, had two kills, saw a Lion
touch the net then combined with
Fortune for another block to make
it 13-8. Then Sio Saipaia hit wide,
trying to go around another
Hanan-Fortune block and it was
match point.
The Lions then saved seven
match points, caught up, took the
lead, and then a Danny Mclnerny
kill gave them the game.
With O'Hara back on the floor
in game four, it was all Stanford.
The Cardinal started pouring it
on, the Lions got frustrated, and
finally Siapaia got a red card for
unsportsmanlike conduct arguing
a call. The automatic point that
came with it made it 10-4 and
Stanford ran out the game.
Appropriately enough, after two
hours, 28 minutes, Hanan hit
through the LMU block for the
final point.
Saipaia led Loyola Marymount
with 30 kills and 13 digs and Chris
Young added 18 kills, a .469 hit
ting percentage and 14 digs.
Duncan Blackman had 13 kills,
hit .308 and recorded a match
high 18 digs for the Cardinal.
Walquist added 11 kills and hit
.435.
O'Hara, who didn't know he
was starting until the pregame
meeting, didn't play like a player
in his first conference match. He
finished with an ace, 12 digs and
74 assists, a huge total consider
ing he played less than 3V* games.
"I decided that I was just going
to be aggresive, go for it."
He feels the team is starting
off on the right foot, and although
the team had some difficulties
passing, O'Hara thinks that, and
everything else, will get better
with time.

Redshirt freshman Ryan O'Hara made his Maples Pavilion debut
against Loyola Marymount Saturday and had a phenomenal 74
assists to go along with 12 digs.
Scott Fortune may have started
a trend.
Fortune, a senior on the men's
volleyball team, was a member of
the 1988 U.S. men's Olympic
team. And if junior Dan Hanan

Men's Volleyball
Cardinal 3, Lions 1
keeps playing the way he did Sat
urday, Hanan will be the Cardi
nal's next Olympian.
Hanan, a 6-foot-5 middle blocker,

had 40 kills and hit a phenomenal
.524 to lead the fourth-ranked
Cardinal to a 15-11, 16-14, 15-17,
15-4 victory over Loyola Mary
mount Saturday night at Maples
Pavilion.
The match opened the Western
Intercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion season for Stanford. After the
win the Cardinal is 1-0 overall
(the two early-season tourna
ments do not count because
Canadian teams were involved).
The Lions are 1-2 overall, 0-2
in WIVA.
Stanford started only one
player who played for the team
last year, Hanan, and got off to
a shaky start, but the team con
tinued to improve thoughout the
match.
"Going into it some of the guys
were pretty nervous," redshirt
freshman setter Ryan O'Hara
said. "They surprised me by play
ing so well. We started kind of
slow. In the fourth game we
played like we're capable of play
ing."
Joining O'Hara in the starting
lineup were Hanan, Fortune (who
stopped out last year) and fresh
men Duncan Blackman, Doug
Walquist and Chris Wrede. But
the young guys held their own
and Hanan and Fortune, the two
veterans, always made their pres
ence felt in the big moments.
Hanan had 10 digs and a match
high eight blocks to go along with
his 40 kills. Fortune had 24 kills,
two service aces, 14 digs and seven
blocks.
"I noticed right away [that
Hanan was having a good night],"
O'Hara said. "At first, when I was
setting the D's, the backrow set,
they weren't getting anyone up
(blocking) on it, then they were
only getting one up on it. With
Hanan, if you only send one guy
up, he's going to beat you most
of the time."
The first two games were rather
similar, with the Cardinal staying
one or two points ahead the whole
time. With Stanford trailing 4-5

in the third game, Coach Fred
Sturm pulled O'Hara and
replaced him with junior Parker
Blackman, the starter for the past
season and a half. The teams
stayed even to 8-8, then Hanan
took over.
He combined with Fortune for
a block, had two kills, saw a Lion
touch the net then combined with
Fortune for another block to make
it 13-8. Then Sio Saipaia hit wide,
trying to go around another
Hanan-Fortune block and it was
match point.
The Lions then saved seven
match points, caught up, took the
