# Frat poster may bring suspension

Because Sigma Chi Fraternity
placed too much emphasis on alcohol
in a recent party flier, the group is
in danger of losing its social privileges
indefinitely, Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Joe Pisano said Friday.
The flier, which advertised an open
"beach" party last Thursday, depicted
four kinds of alcoholic iced teas but
had only one drawing of an EANAB
— non-alcoholic, Lipton iced tea. The
flier also stated that beer would be
served.
Pisano said that he was concerned
about the "four to one ratio of alcohol
to EANABS" on the flier because it
placed too much emphasis on the con
sumption of alcohol. Social events
which do not provide "equally attrac
tive non-alcoholic beverages" stand in
violation of University policy.
Pisano and Sigma Chi president
Marty Hardigan plan to meet today
or tomorrow to discuss a possible
suspension. Pisano said he believed it
was important to remind fraternities
of the consequences for breaking pol
icies so that they would not repeat
their mistakes.
Hardigan maintained that alcohol
was not the focus of the Sigma Chi's
party, which featured a band and pro
vided EANABS. He said the drawing
of the iced teas was "a small part of
the flier."
Pisano, on the other hand, called
the drawing the "centerpiece."
The day of the party, Pisano called
Hardigan to express his concern about
the flier.

Joe Pisano said that he
was concerned about
the 'four to one ratio of
alcohol to EANABS' on
the flier.

"I wasn't inclined to cancel the
party because, after speaking to [Har
digan], I was convinced that the focus
of the party would not be on alcohol,"
he said.
Stressing that the party's focus was
not on alcohol, Hardigan said, "The
drinks and beer ran out early, but
people stayed and danced because they
were having a good time," he said.
In the fall, Pisano had warned the
Sigma Chis to be careful with adver
tisements after a keg appeared on a
party flier for the fraternity. This ear
lier warning has exacerbated the
Sigma Chi's current situation, accord
ing to Pisano.
In October, the Phi Delta Theta
Fraternity lost their social privileges
following the group's annual
kamikazee party, which focused wholly
on alcohol. On Wednesday, the Phi
Delts' social privileges were fully
reinstated.
Pisano said a possible suspension
of Sigma Chi's social privileges is not
part of a plan to phase out fraternities
— such a plan does not exist, he said.
But Pisano added that the possible
suspension of the Sigma Chis demon
strates a serious University commit
ment to "enforcing a reasonable alco

hoi policy."
Hardigan said he might have misun
derstood the University's policy.
"It could be all my fault, but I didn't
know that you couldn't have any ref
erence to alcohol on a flier."
Nevertheless, Hardigan informed
Pisano in a letter Friday that he would
cancel the fraternity's next two par
ties scheduled for Jan. 26 and Feb. 2
"to prove that Sigma Chi isn't taking
this lightly."
Hardigan added, "To clear this issue
up, from now on we won't mention
any alcohol in our fliers."


This poster, used to advertise a Sigma
Chi Fraternity party last Thursday,
drew criticism over the weekend from
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano
for its "emphasis" on alcohol.
