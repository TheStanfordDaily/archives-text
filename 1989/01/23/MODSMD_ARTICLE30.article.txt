# 49ers win Super Bowl
## 
### Buck Montana Staff writer With wire reports 
MIAMI â€” San Francisco's
greatest Super Bowl triumph
nearly disintegrated in a flurry
of mistakes and missed oppor
tunities.
The heroics of Joe Montana,
Jerry Rice, John Taylor and
the combined efforts of the de
fense produced a come-from
behind, 20-16 victory over the
Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday
and saved such players as
Roger Craig, Randy Cross and
Taylor himself from spending
a long off-season pondering
their mistakes.
Thanks to the 49ers' fourth
game-winning rally in the
fourth quarter this season, this
team will likely go down in his
tory as the team of the 1980's.
"It's got to be one of our
best wins ever," said Montana,
who completed 23 of 36 passes
for 357 yards. "To be down by
a field goal and come back and
win it like we did ... it's got to
rank up there, believe me."
Montana's 10-yard touch
down pass into the out
stretched arms of Taylor in the
end zone with 34 seconds
remaining brought back mem
ories of what had been known
as "The Catch" but which
might now be renamed "The
Other Catch." The Catch was
made by Dwight Clark, who
leaped in the end zone to grab

a high Montana pass to beat
Dallas in the NFC champion
ship gaxne seven years ago.
Montana said he would have
a hard time choosing between
the Clark and Taylor catches.
"We were in a tough position,
but we never gave up," Mon
tana said .
And in the much more an
ticipated and more exciting
"Bud Bowl I," undefeated Bud
weiser pulled out a squeaker,
27-24 against formerly un
beaten Bud Light in a clash of
the sudsy titans.
The second quarter ended on
a note of excitement when Bud
weiser brought in its secret
weapon, "the Freezer" for a
six-yard touchdown run to
make the score 10-7 Budweiser
at the half.
"I was surprised I got the
call," Freeze' said, adding "I
was just sitting on the sidelines
drinking some Gatorade and
watching all those beer cans in
the stands doing the wave
when Coach Busch told me to
screw my cap on and go out
there."
With two seconds left in the
game, Busch called on Pro
Bowl kicker "Budski" to kick
the game-winning field goal.
The pigskin hit the crossbar
and then the upright before fi
nally falling through as the
crowd held its collective foam.
Bud Light fans did have
some consolation as their team
beat the 3V2-point spread.
