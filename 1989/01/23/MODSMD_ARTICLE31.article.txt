# Cardinal becomes latest victim of Wolverine winning streak

Michigan extended its streak of
dual meet victories to 43 Friday
at deGuerre pool. But the num
bers mean nothing to Michigan
Coach Jon Urbanchek.
Men's Swimming
Wolverines 60, Cardinal 53
"The dual meet record is a farce
as far as I'm concerned," the
seventh year helmsman said. "It's
just the concoction of a Midwest
SID who has nothing better to
do. I don't keep track of records."
Record or not, Michigan
squeaked out a 60-53 victory over
the also impressive Cardinal be
hind the performances of free
styler Brent Lang and breast
strokers Eric Wunderlich and
Mike Barrowman. The win gave
fifth-ranked Michigan its second
dual meet defeat of Stanford in
as many years and raised the Wol
verines record to 6-0 for the
season. The second-ranked Cardi
nal dropped to 0-1.
"It's nice to come out here and
swim against one of the top teams
in the country," Urbanchek said.
"I guess the victory means that

beating Stanford last year wasn't
a fluke. As long as the 'streak* is
being brought up it's good for
morale to keep it going, especially
against a team as strong as Stan
ford."
Despite sweeping two events,
the 200-yard free and the 500
free, Stanford could not catch up
to the Wolverines after a start
that was one second too slow.
With two events to go, Stanford
had the opportunity to win, or at
least tie, its first dual competition
of the season, but Michigan's
breast corps preserved the victory.
Wunderlich and Olympian Bar
rowman took one-two in the 200
breast to put the victory out of
the Cardinal's grasp.
Featuring squads of Olympians,
NCAA finalists, and All-Americas
to be, Stanford and Michigan
battled for early tempo and what
would eventually be the decisive
point margin in the opening event,
the 400 medley relay. While the
relay squads traded leads, the
Michigan team of Wilkening, Bar
rowman, Marty Moran, and Lang
touched home one second ahead
of Stanford's Jeff Rouse, Jeff
Deßuiter, Jay Mortenson, and
Doug Lillydahl.
Jason Plummer and Alex Kos
tich placed first and third in the
folowing event, the 1,000 free. Co

captain John Witchel, Lunn Les
tina, and J.B. Barr swept the 200
free, the third race, but Stanford
could not gain control of its first
one-on-one trial of the season.
Olympian Lang was a big factor
in stopping the Cardinal's at
tempts, winning both the 50 and
100 free events in addition to his
victorious medley relay leg.
"The medley relay may have
affected the rest of the meet be
cause the upperclassmen knew
how important winning the first
event is," Stanford Asst. Coach
Ted Knapp said. "On the whole
we were just a little shy of what
we could have swum this week
end."
Knapp was quick to praise the
overall team effort, especially the
times posted by the majority of
Stanford swimmers. The free
stylers dominated the meet. In
addition to the 1,000 and 200 vic
tories, Plummer, Lestina, and
Witchel swept the 500, and the
400 free relay team were victori
ous. Freshman Rouse also took
the 200 backstroke.
"We rose up to the challenge
but on any given day any top-five
team can beat another. We're get
ting sick of losing. We really do
have a lot of talent and depth and
I don't anticipate losing any more
dual meets," Lillydahl said.

Freshman John Mikesell got off to a fast start in his first deGuerre Pool dual meet on Friday, but
the Cardinal succumbed to Michigan, which won its 43rd straight matchup.
