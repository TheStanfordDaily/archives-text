While students explore environ
mental issues in this week's "You
Can Make a Difference" confer
ence, Tresidder Union will make
its own effort to promote environ
mental awareness.
Declaring an "Environmental
Awareness Week" at Stanford,
Tresidder will focus on informing
people about the harmful effects
of Styrofoam products on the en
vironment, according to Paul
Szczesiul, associate director of
Tresidder Union.
The project was initiated by stu
dent members of the Tresidder
Food Committee with support
from The Stanford Recycling Cen
ter and Students for Environmen
tal Action at Stanford.
Steve Sutherland, student chair
of the Tresidder Food Committee,
said a tabie will be placed in front
of the student union as well as
banners and fliers to make infor
mation about Styrofoam avail
able.
Szczesiul said the key problems
behind Styrofoam products are
that they are non-biodegradable
and that they are made from
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs,
which damage the ozone layer.
CFCs are largely used in

use of Styrofoam
cups.

coolants and aerosol propellants.
Biological Sciences Prof. Peter
Vitousek said that CFCs ore also
used to make the tiny air bubbles
that give Styrofoam its heat
retaining properties. When
Styrofoam cups break down, they
release the CFC compounds into
the air. The CFCs then damage
the ozone layer, which protects
the earth from harmful ultravio
let radiation from the sun.
Szczesiul said that Tresidder
now uses cups that contain lower
concentrations of CFCs.
Szczesiul said Tresidder will
eventually phase out Styrofoam
products from all of its stores and
restaurants. While all cold drinks
are currently served in paper cups,
hot drinks are still served in
Styrofoam because no suitable
materials with the same proper
ties of Styrofoam have yet been
found. Paper cups also cost about

two to three cents more per item
than Styrofoam, Szczesiul said.
Sutherland said mugs will be
sold for two dollars at Tresidder
in the hopes of encouraging people
to find alternatives to using
Styrofoam cups. Free refills will
be given to those using the mugs.
Szczesiul, who served on a Palo
Alto city task force on environ
mental issues, said that legislation
has been proposed to make cups
with high levels of CFCs illegal.
He said the University of Oregon
and UC-Berkeley have already
enacted anti-Styrofoam legisla
tion.
Styrofoam doesn't fully decom
pose quickly, which leads to ac
cumulation of Styrofoam products
in landfills and can disrupt
ecological systems, he added.
In addition to promoting aware
ness about the harmful effects of
Styrofoam, Sutherland said Tres
idder will also help promote recy
cling. Sutherland said recycling
bins will be placed outside Tres
idder to make them easily acces
sible for students.
According to Szczesiul, efforts
to sort out trash for recycling
from public trash receptacles are
cost-inefficient. The awareness
week seeks to encourage students
to sort out and recycle their own
trash.
