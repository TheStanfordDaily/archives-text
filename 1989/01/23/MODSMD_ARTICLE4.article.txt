# Native Hawaiian numbers
## create reason for concern 
### Malinda McCollum Staff writer 
Members of the Native Hawaiian student
group claim that Stanford does not actively
recruit nor admit a sufficient number of
Native Hawaiian students to the University.
Currently there are six Native Hawaiian
students at Stanford, all of whom are sched
uled to graduate in the coming year and
a half, according to the group which goes
by the name Ho'oikaika.
The Native Hawaiian group aired its con
cerns at a meeting with the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and Financial
Aids Thursday.
In a response delivered at the meeting,
committee members said, "This committee
is sympathetic to the concerns presented
by the Native Hawaiians, and we look for
ward to taking action after collecting more
information."
According to Asian Languages Prof.
Susan Matisoff, a committee member, more
information needs to be collected on how
Native Hawaiians will be identified, the
effect this identification will have on other
campus minority groups and the financial
impact of increased recruiting.
But Ho'oikaika members said that in
cluding Native Hawaiians in affirmative
action programs will not require mayor
policy or budget changes. The Federal Gov
ernment recognized Native Hawaiians as
Native Americans in 1974, placing them
in the same category as American Indians
and Alaskan Natives.

cally Native Americans — and because

exist at Stanford — Ho'oikaika member

needed to integrate Native Hawaiians into
the current programs.
Combining Hawaiians with other Native
American groups is a feasible course of
action, according to Asst. Dean of Student
Affairs James Larimore, who observed such
a program at his previous post at
Dartmouth University.
He stressed, however, that it is necessary
to "talk with students to find out what
their hopes are" before such a program is
implemented.
Loo also downplayed an increase in ex
penses for recruiting. She said that a
recruiter already visits Hawaii every year
and that the recruiter just needs "to reor
ganize the time she does spend there to
include specific recruitment of Native
Hawaiian students."
Verification of the Native Hawaiian stu
dents' ethnicity could be handled in a
similar manner as American Indian
verification, according to Loo. Ho'oikaika
proposed that Hawaiian students obtain
official verification from government agen
cies in Hawaii. That would remove the
burden and expense of proof from the Ad
missions Office, Loo added.
Committee members are currently gath
ering information and have scheduled their
decision for the next meeting March 6.
