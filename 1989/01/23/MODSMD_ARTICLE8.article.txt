Exploring Jodo Shinshu Bud
dhism, Judaism, Christianity and
the Native-American traditions,
four environmentalists yesterday
morning discussed the relation
ship of faith and philosophy to
the environment.

sixth annual "You Can Make a
Difference Conference," the four

ter our lifestyles.
Hon Castro, a Jodo Shinsh'u
Buddhist priest, emphasized a
need to escape the modern preoc
cupation with the self and recog
nize each human being as part of

dependent on the welfare of all,"
he said. "A cell in the body that
becomes self-seeking, we call that

cancer.
Harlan Stelmach, director of
the Center for Ethics and Social
Policy in Berkeley, said it is time

Christian creation tradition from
dominion over Earth to responsi
ble stewardship of the planet.
People must confront the
"enemy within" that is our cur
rent lifestyle, Stelmach said. "Our
concept of middle-class essentials
is killing the planet."
