# Panel: Lifestyle changes would help environment
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Senior staff writer 
Exploring Jodo Shinshu Bud
dhism, Judaism, Christianity and
the Native-American traditions,
four environmentalists yesterday
morning discussed the relation
ship of faith and philosophy to
the environment.
As part of the kick off for the
sixth annual "You Can Make a
Difference Conference," the four
person panel warned a Memorial
Church audience that the Earth
and its inhabitants will not sur
vive unless we reexamine and al
ter our lifestyles.
Hon Castro, a Jodo Shinsh'u
Buddhist priest, emphasized a
need to escape the modern preoc
cupation with the self and recog
nize each human being as part of
a single whole.
"Each of us is a cell in the body
and the welfare of each cell is
dependent on the welfare of all,"
he said. "A cell in the body that
becomes self-seeking, we call that

cancer.
Harlan Stelmach, director of
the Center for Ethics and Social
Policy in Berkeley, said it is time
to shift the emphasis of Judeo-
Christian creation tradition from
dominion over Earth to responsi
ble stewardship of the planet.
People must confront the
"enemy within" that is our cur
rent lifestyle, Stelmach said. "Our
concept of middle-class essentials
is killing the planet."
These thoughts were echoed by

Charlene Spretnak, who inter
prets the divine as "Mother
Earth" rather than in the Judeo-
Christian tradition of a male "sky
god."
According to Spretnak, an au
thor and philosopher, the creation
of material desires by advertising
and industry "plays on the great
spiritual vacuum in modern in
dustrialized culture."
Without this spiritual base,
humr"Â« look at forests and wil
derness as resources instead of
"sacred habitat," she said.
Paula Gunn Allen, a professor
of Native American Studies at
UC-Berkeley, also discussed the
exploitation of sacred habitats by
civilization. The spiritual tradi
tions of many Native Americans
are compromised if all the open
grasslands and untouched wilder
ness are bought up and fenced
off, she said.
In Native American tradition,
all creatures and plants on Earth
are part of one family, and
humans are the youngest relatives
of that clan. Yet, Westerners do
not accept that role, she said.
"There have never been so many
humans and so few of the other
creatures."

The morning began with a serv
ice that included Buddhist, Native
American and Christian forms of
worship which all stressed respect
for the environment.
Castro performed the Buddhist
ceremony of Kansho, Striking of
the Inverted Bell. He was followed
by Glenn Kameda, a member of
the Palo Alto Buddhist commu
nity who read a Buddhist prayer
instructing humans, "link[s] in
the Buddhist chain of love," to be
"kind and gentle to every living
thing."
Robert Gregg, dean of the
chapel at Memorial Church, led
the congregation in a reading
called "A Lament for Creation,"
a modern reworking of Genesis.
"And God said, 'Let there be a
firmament in the midst of the
waters.' And it was so. And God
called the firmament Heaven.
"And we said, 'Let the firma
ment be filled with Strontium 90
and guided missiles, with smoke
and gasses and industrial waste."
Finally, representing the Native
American tradition, Stanford
graduate Joey Thomas read a
story of Earth's creation from
The Book of Hopi.
The program ended outside the
church with a tree planting by
Hillel, the Jewish student organ
ization, in observation of Tu
B'Shevat, the Jewish New Year
for trees.
