# CPPC sees good market for grads
## 
### Owen Maubane 
On the heels of one of its busiest
years ever, the Career Planning
and Placement Center expects this
year's seniors to enter an even
more attractive job environment
than previous graduating classes.
According to Ruth Schneider,
director of the Career Placement
and Planning Center, last year the
CPPC hosted recruiters from 494
organizations around the nation.
Those recruiters conducted 7,200
job interviews.
Optimism for this year's grad
uates is fueled in part by the
recent Endicott-Lindquist survey
of the business community's out
look for the coming fiscal year.
The report indicates that 97
percent of the employers surveyed
expect the growth of the U.S. eco
nomy to increase or, at least,
remain the same.
The report also predicts an in
cease in the employment of grad
uates with bachelors degrees by
8 percent, while starting salaries
will rise an average of 4.6 percent.
The report is published an
nually by Northwestern Univer
sity and polls firms with at least
3,000 employees. This year's sur
vey included 242 firms.
A survey conducted by the
CPPC last year suggests that
most of the current seniors will

use the center's services to take
advantage of this momentum. A
random sample of seniors last
June showed that only 0.7 percent
didn't know anything about the
CPPC, while 92 percent had used
at least one CPPC service.
Traditionally, it has been the
graduating engineering students
that have attracted the best job
offers. Currently starting salaries
for Stanford engineers average
over $30,000, with chemical engi
neering students starting at an
average of $33,900 and electrical
engineers at $32,500. Both figures
are well above the national
projected average for 1989.
Recently, the recruiting effort

has also begun to concentrate on
graduates with liberal arts
degrees. For some time, there has
been a concern that companies
concentrate their efforts on
recruiting "techies" (those with
science and engineering mtgors)
while disregarding "fuzzies" (hu
manities and social science
msyors).
While Schneider expects a good
year for liberal arts students, she
maintains that everyone should
pursue a diverse curriculum.
"As long as students pursue a
well-rounded program, they are
at no disadvantage," Schneider
said. "Courses such as computer
science, math, statistics and ac
counting help convince firms that
a student isn't afraid of math.
Quantitative skills are very im
portant if a student wants to be
employed."
She adds that firms do tend to
look for technically or business
oriented students. "Advertising,
public relations, arts and commu
nications interests are not sought
after by recruiting companies,"
Schneider said.
Yet, she is quick to point out
that all Stanford graduates are
highly regarded by recruiting
firms. For example, while national
recruiting efforts have flagged,
Stanford still attracts as many
firms as in previous years.
