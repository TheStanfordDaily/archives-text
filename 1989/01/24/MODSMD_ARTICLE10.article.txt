# Health and safety committee created

Created out of the need for campus health reg
ulations, University President Donald Kennedy re
cently appointed Biological Sciences Prof. Robert
Simoni as the chair of a new 13-member University
Committee on Health and Safety.
A complex investigation conducted in December
following a letter to Kennedy from Jon Moldestad,
former Environmental Safety Facility Operations
manager, resulted in the creation of the new com
mittee. Moldestad's letter accused Stanford of was
ting millions of dollars and endangering University
students, faculty and staff through their handling
of toxins at research facilities.
The committee's primary responsibilty is to focus
on issues related to laboratory safety in teaching
and research and to determine appropriate processes
for the design and construction of new facilities.
According to a Faculty Senate meeting in December,
this year's spending on health and safety issues is
expected to increase by $1.2 million.
Advising Kennedy on the adequacy of the Uni
versity's health and safety programs, policies and
organization, the committee reviews the safety mat
ters related to the use of hazardous biological, chemi
cal and physical agents. These issues are
unaddressed by existing administrative health
panels.
Simoni said, "It is of great importance that the
University is guaranteed of the safety parameters
implanted in the design and construction of build
ings on campus."
The committee now serves many of the Univer
sity's needs which were previously not met by less
structured committees. Although specific issues the
committee will discuss are yet to be determined,

Simoni said it will address a set of initial problems.
Rather than attempting to survey all health and
safety issues, which may become too broad, Simoni
said it will be more profitable for the committee to
concentrate on specific areas. In addition he said,
"The committee should be in a position to tell the
public that it has looked into health and safety
problems and dealt with them."
Simoni further said the the establishment of this
committee shows the University is responsible for
responding to health and safety as paramount con
cerns.
Ralph Buchanan, acting director of environmental
safety, said, "Health and safety is basically risk
management." Because there are not enough re
sources to insure absolute safety all over the campus,
he said the committee will provide a uniform and
consistent approach to the varying health and safety
needs of different groups.
Buchanan said, "The structure of the new com
mittee will allow for a University-wide perspective.
It will give the committee a better understanding
of health legislation and what its impact would be
on the University."
The committee members, all appointed by Ken
nedy, consist of five faculty members: Byron Brown,
statistics; Perry McCarty, civil engineering; William
Northway, diagnostic radiology; Eugene Webb, or
ganizational behavior; and Paul Wender, chemistry.
Other members are Gregory Cumberford, a junior
in environmental studies; Patricia Devaney, associate
dean of research; Larry Horton, associate vice pres
ident for public affairs; John Hughes, associate
provost for facilities; Lee Thompson, associate staff
counsel; Ralph Buchanan, acting director of envi
ronmental safety; and Victor Calvo, former state
assemblyman.
