## Bush calls abortion American tragedy 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Bush yesterday called abor
tion "our American tragedy" as
nearly 70,000 protesters marked
the anniversary of the Supreme
Court's landmark decision legaliz
ing abortion. The march organizer
said the new administration
should "provide actions to carry
out their words."
Bush, speaking by telephone
hook-up to the activists, said the
Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs.
Wade decision "was wrong and
should be overturned."
"I wanted to share with you my
deep personal concern about our
American tragedy — abortion on
demand," Bush said over
loudspeakers. "I think America
needs a human life amendment
and I think when it comes to abor
tion, there's a better way — the
way of adoption, the way of life."
The president said he was "con
fident that more and more Amer
icans every year — every day —
are hearing your message and
taking it to heart. I promise you
that the president hears you now
and stands with you in a cause
that must be won."
The Washington march was the
focal point of what was intended
to be a nationwide protest against
the 1973 Supreme Court decision.
In Dallas, Texas, a crowd esti
mated at 3,000 people rallied at
City Hall and march to a federal
courthouse to protest the ruling.
The Washington crowd, esti

mated by U.S. Park Police at
67,300, assembled at noon in sun
ny, mild weather on the Ellipse
with the White House as a back
drop. As Bush spoke at the start
of the rally, which came after a
weekend of demonstrations
around the nation, the demon-

strators cheered his words and
waved signs.
But Nellie Gray of the March
for Life, which organized the an
nual protest, iold the crowd Bush
could not hear their applause be
cause the White House commu
nications office had installed a

one-way communications line.
She said she hoped that did not
portend the nature of their future
communications.
"He spoke to us, but he could
not listen to us," she said. "That
was not an adequate way to deal
with our pro-life movement."
