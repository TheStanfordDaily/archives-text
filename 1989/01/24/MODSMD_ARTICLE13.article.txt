WASHINGTON (AP) - George
Bush set a brisk pace for his new
presidency as he rose before dawn
yesterday, cautioned White House
officials against ethical lapses and
told anti-abortion activists that
the Supreme Court ruling legaliz
ing abortion "was wrong and
should be overturned."
On his first full working day,
Bush reported to the Oval Office
at 7:21 a.m. and stayed until 6:37
p.m., an 11 hour, 16-minute
workday. He had breakfast with
Vice President Dan Quayle, was
briefed by CIA officials on intel
ligence developments and attended
the swearing-in of his staff â€” all
before 9 a.m., the usual hour
Ronald Reagan began work.
White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said Bush usually
works past 5 p.m., whereas
Reagan left an hour or so earlier.
Bush warned his aides that
their jobs would be "a time
consuming killer" and said "the
lights burn brightly well after
dark around this place." He said
he hoped their spouses would un
derstand.
All of Bush's Cabinet still
awaits confirmation, but they
were summoned to the White
House for their first official meet
ing and group photo. They were
briefed on the budget and foreign
policy, as well as his mandate for
high ethical standards, Fitzwater
said.
The press secretary issued a
statement later saying that during
the Cabinet meeting, chief of staff
John Sununu discussed "major
themes and initiatives to be taken
in the weeks ahead."
Secretary of State-designate
James Baker gave an overview of
foreign policy, telling his col

leagues that "we're going to be
very busy, but we start with a
strong hand and a strong
America."
Making good on a promise,
Bush refused to answer reporters'
questions during the photo-taking
session with the Cabinet. "1 think
it's a better system this way," he
said, adding that he would be
available in other forums.
Bush, who saw the Reagan ad
ministration's reputation tar
nished by questions of ethical
lapses, told his staff he wanted
them to set a high standard of
conduct.
He said the guidelines should
be "pride, honesty, spirit of
idealism when it comes to public
service, knowing that our actions
must always be of the highest in
tegrity.
"It's a question of knowing
right from wrong, avoiding con
flicts of interest, bending over
backwards to see that there's not
even a perception of conflict of
interest," Bush said.
Fitzwater said Bush was not
trying to draw a contrast with
the Reagan administration on eth
ics. "He simply wants to do it his
way and make the points that he
feels are important. . . . He is
familiar with the difficulty of in
spiring and insuring ethical con
duct among an organization as
vast as the 2-million person gov
ernment.
"He simply wants to be on the
record and clear about his feelings
from day one," Fitzwater said.
Fitzwater said Bush would give
a similar charge this week to the
bureaucrats in the senior execu
tive service and to the inspectors
general of various departments.
