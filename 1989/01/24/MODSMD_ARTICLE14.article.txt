| WARSAW, Poland (AP) - The
j deputy prince minister explained
i the Communist Party's about
face on legalizing Solidarity by
saying only compromise can rouse
! the people and economy from ap
: athy.
| "Economic reform needs polit
; ical backing not only from the
I government but also from the con
i structive opposition: it needs so
! cial support," Ireneusz Sekula
I said in an interview yesterday
; with the official news agency PAP.
i His comments come the day
j after Solidarity accepted a Com
munist Party offer to negotiate
! legalizing the banned trade union
J federation.
J "There is no choice. Either we
; decide on actions forming a
' feasible chance of success or we
reject them, selecting defeat right
I from the start," PAP quoted
| Sekula as saying.
He said the government needs
support from the opposition and
people at large to help pull "the
economy and people out from ap
, athy, helplessness and stillness."
Solidarity's National Executive
1 Commission on Sunday agreed to
| negotiate and said talks to reverse
■ Poland's economic and social
troubles should begin as soon as
possible.
"One of the most difficult
things will be the matter of eco
; nomic action, reforming the eco
• nomy. .. . This is an essential mat
! ter," said Mieczyslw Gil, one of
' three Solidarity leaders preparing

the union's negotiating position.
Groups of Solidarity activists
and factory commissions would
hold discussions on economic
reform, Gil said.
The official media, which once
denounced or ignored Solidarity's
activities, has published straight
forward accounts of its position
since the party offer was made
Wednesday.
Front pages of yesterday's
newspapers were filled with dis
cussion of the offer and
Solidarity's agreement.
Trybuna Ludu, the Communist
Party newspaper, carried the full
text of the independent union's

statement and its own report with
extensive quotes from Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa.
But voices of dissent can be
heard complaining of the party's
new stance.
"Let's speak the truth: achieve
ments are meager and there are
a lot of problems and worries,"
said Alfred Miodowicz, head of the
only official trade union alliance,
in an interview with the govern
ment newspaper Rzeczpospolita.
In Washington, President
Bush's chief spokesman said the
White House welcomes the an
nouncement of negotiations.
