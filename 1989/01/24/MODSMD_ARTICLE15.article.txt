BUENOS AIRES, Argentina
(AP) — Hundreds of soldiers
backed by tanks and mortors
regained control of most of an
infantry base last night after 15
hours of gun battles with civilian
commandos the government said
were leftist guerrillas.
At 9:30 p.m., a handful of com
mandos were holed up in an of
ficers club that soldiers had at
tacked with tanks and set on fire.
Moments earlier, a small ar
mory exploded, sending bright
flames 100 yards high into the
darkness. Sporadic gunfire and an
occasional mortar round could be

heard from inside the spacious
compound.
The battles began when an es
timated 30 to 50 commandos used
a stolen Coca Cola delivery truck
to crash through the .main gate
of the 3rd infantry regiment in
La Tablada on the outskirts of
Buenos Aires.
At least 20 commandos were
killed or wounded, local news
agencies reported. Hospital and
provincial health officials said
four soldiers were killed and 27
soldiers and police wounded, along
with one local newspaper reporter.
The casualty toll was much

higher than in the three military
insurrections against the govern
ment of President Raul Alfonsin
during the past 21 months.
The commandos did not identify
themselves or state their motives.
But a woman who called the in
dependent news agency Diarios y
Noticias said she was part of the
commando group and said it acted
to prevent a military coup.
"It was to defend democracy
and now they're massacring us,"
said the woman, who refused to
identify herself or the commando
group. "Please, do something."
