E. Germany to cut armed forces
BERLIN (AP) — East Germany said yesterday
it will cut its armed forces by 10,000 soldiers
and trim defense spending 10 percent.
In West Germany, meanwhile, a Soviet official
reiterated Moscow's call for elimination of short
range nuclear weapons from Europe.
East German leader Erich Honecker said that
as part of the cutback, six tank regiments and
an air force squadron would be mustered out,
resulting in a reduction of 600 tanks and 50
warplanes.
"At the same time, the national outlay for
defense will be reduced by 10 percent," Honecker
said.
Honecker said the cuts would be completed by
the end of 1990 to give the East German army
"an even more defensive character."
The surprise move follows an announcement
by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev last month
that the Kremlin was reducing its own troop
strength, including in Eastern Europe.

NATO officials have welcomed Gorbachev's in
itiative but maintain that the Warsaw Pact would
still retain superiority in conventional forces in
Europe.
Ted Bundy may be executed today
STARKE, Fla. (AP) — Confessed serial killer
Ted Bundy was "subdued and emotional" Monday
while he talked with the defense's psychiatrist,
and his attorneys filed a flurry of appeals to stop
his execution this morning.
The 42-year-old law school dropout, who
confessed to 20 murders inWestern states during
the last three days, met with psychiatrist Dorothy
Lewis while attorneys apparently prepared an
argument that Bundy was mentally incompetent
to be executed.
Bundy was scheduled to die in Florida's electric
chair at 7 a.m. today for the 1978 kidnap-murder
of 12-year-old Kimberly Leach of Lake City. He
also was convicted of killing two sorority sisters
in Tallahassee in 1978.
