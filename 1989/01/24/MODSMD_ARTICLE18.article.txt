Mud volleyball is one
of many ways students
serve the community

THEY LOOKED LIKE mud
caked creatures from"The
Deep" on Saturday. But now
that they've had a chance to take
a long, Warm shower and wash off
the ooze, it's time to give the mem
bers of the Kappa Alpha Fraternity
a pat on the back.
Representing 53 different teams,
more than 500 people participated
in the third annual KA Mud Vol
leyball Tournament this weekend.
An all-day affair held in the
swampy bed of Lake Lagunita, the
tournament is a fund-raiser for the
National Muscular Dystrophy As
sociation.
The event raised more than
$5,300 for the association â€” each
team wrote out a $100 check to
participate. In addition, the KAs
shelled out an extra $400 to cover
operational costs for the mud bath.
Proceeds from the tournament
benefit about 900 muscular
dystrophy patients in the Bay Area.
In preparation for the tourna
ment, fraternity members hauled
out hoses from the Palo Alto Fire
Department and drench the lake's
basin with hundreds of gallons of
water to create seven very
volleyball courts.
With local merchants such as
Lancashire Tavern taking part as
well, the KAs reached beyond the
Stanford community.
They had tunes sounding
through a loud speaker, players
doing "face plants" into the goo
and fans cheering from the
sidelines.
The KAs took an unusual ap
proach to raise money for a charity.
Their hard work really paid off.
Many a finger is pointed at Stan

ford's fraternities. While even
small slip-ups are spotlighted,
fraternal organizations' contribu
tions are too often overlooked.
For instance, every week mem
bers of'the Sigma Chi Fraternity
head over to East Palo Alto and
spend a few hours playing games
with elementary school children
there.
For those athletes who prefer
huffing and puffing to spiking a
volleyball, the Kappa Alpha Theta
Sorority sponsors a 10-kilometer
fun run each fall quarter. More
than 200 people participate in the
annual "Theta Breakers" with all
proceeds benefiting the Commu
nity Association for the Retarded.
In November, members of the
Tri-Delta Sorority took some time
away from their studies to do
charity work. The Tri Delts con
vinced local merchants and stu
dents to contribute to an auction
that raised more than $2,300 for
oncology research.
Many an unusual item was auc
tioned off at the noon-time event,
including swimming lessons from
Olympic gold medalist Pablo
Morales.
For those who love to slam dunk,
the Sigma Alpha Mu Fraternity
will sponsor a "Bounce for Beats"
this quarter to benefit the Amer
ican Heart Association.
.For a straight 25 hours,
Sammies will be in White Plaza
bouncing basketballs, and welcome
all other volunteers, in hopes of
raising more than $1,000 for the
association.
As cosponsors for the "You Can
Make a Diffence Conference," the
Sammies will also be out on the
streets directing traffic for week
end conference programs.
Stanford's fraternal organiza
tions have done some great charity
work that students both in and out
of the fraternal groups have en
joyed. Thanks.
