# Rice to join Bush staff
## 
### Lori Silver Senior staff writer 
Political Science Assoc. Prof.
Condoleezza Rice has accepted a
position in the Bush Administra
tion and will be taking a leave of
absence from Stanford, Rice told
The Daily last night.
Although Rice did not say what
position she accepted, The Daily
reported Jan. 12 that the Bush
transition team had offered her a
choice between two high level po
sitions — the deputy director of
policy planning at the State De
partment or the Soviet specialist
to the National Security Council.
"I am going to go to Washing
ton," Rice said in an interview
yesterday, but she added that she
will announce the specifics of her
departure in a press conference
today.
Rice said that she was not going

to resign her position from the
Political Science Department but
would be taking a leave of absence
instead. When asked if she

planned to stay in
Washington for
President Bush's
full four year
term, she said, "It
is not an issue at
this point."
Nationally
recognized for
her expertise in
East-West rela

tions and military policy, Rice has
worked for the federal govern
ment as a consultant to the Joint
Chiefs of Staff in 1986 and 1987.
In addition, she has appeared reg
ularly on PBS' "MacNeil/Lehrer
Newshour" and ABC's news show
"Nightline," as well as acting as
a consultant to ABC News. At
Stanford, Rice is also associated

with the Center for International
Security and Arms Control.
Speculation that Rice had been
offered a position in the Bush Ad
ministration reached a high point
two weeks ago. The Political Sci
ence Department's sudden an
nouncement that Rice canceled
her winter quarter seminar added
fuel to the rumors.
Among Stanford students, Rice
is known for her dynamic lectures
and amiable personality. Alphonso
Lara, a third-year graduate stu
dent in political science, who was
a teaching assistant in Rice's fall
quarter class, "The Role of the
Military in Politics," said that
Rice is "a constant source of in
spiration."
Adding that he enjoyed watch
ing Rice lecture, Lara said that
Rice "really brings out the best
in students."
