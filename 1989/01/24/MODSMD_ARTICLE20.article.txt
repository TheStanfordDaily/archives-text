"... I ate all the stuffing straight out of
the turkey and then went into the bath
room, stuck my finger down my throat
and . . . performed some public service
right there on the spot!"
— Berkowitz, Andrew
TODAY'S COLUMN was brought to
you by the letter B. Can you say,
B? Without this unique letter, some
of life's pleasures would be unpronoun
cable: eer, arf, athroom.
I think it's high time people started
to realize the importance of the letter B.
I shall devote the next 15 inches of this
column, at an advertising cost of
$630,000 per inch, to words that begin
with B.
B-l Bomber: A few minor details still
need to be ironed out — it tends to make
"controlled flight into terrain," it's doubt
ful it can penetrate Soviet air defenses,
its electronic jamming capabilities are
really lame, it carries a smaller payload
than promised and it costs a mere $280
million each.
The Pentagon is considering transform
ing the B-l into a high-end sports car,
the B-IMW, by giving it rack-and-pinion
steering, anti-lock brakes and tinted win
dows.
B-2 Bomber: Probably the neatest
looking sub-sonic, low-payload, $520 mil
lion bomber ever built by prudent defense
contractors. Since the stealth bomber is
vulnerable to the naked eye, and thus to
hand-held surface to air missiles, the Pen
tagon is considering painting the bomber
light blue, cloudy or sunshine depending
on mission objectives.
Plans are under way to develop the

next generation of bombers, the Aeroß-2,
by making a large hole in the middle of
the plane.
Bathroom: A place to perform public
service.
Bigger Beach at Lake Lag: A place to
.perform public service.
Bold soy crop venture: What the cen
tennial campaign needs.
Banal: Repeating the same concepts
over and over again.
Banana sludge: Flavored dessert at
Lambda Nu, not to be confused with
Banana slugs.
Banana slugs: Slimy little buggers that
tends to shrivel up upon contact with
Benzoil Peroxide.
Berkeley: Wanna-be Stanford students,
see brain-dead.
Brain-dead: see Berkeley.
Barfed: see bummer.
i Bummer: An unfortunate occurrance.
see wicked hangover.
Bowl, Toilet: see wicked hangover.
Big Game: Large wild animals — lions,
tigers, leopards, etc.
Bomber Jacket: A leather jacket that
wanna-be Air Force pilots, WAFP's, wear.
B, the grade: 1. What fuzzies get for
not working hard. 2. What techies dream
of receiving in EE classes.
Brokaw, Tom: The Soviet mole sent to
the United States, trained and hair-styled
to one day assume the identity of Dan
Quayle.
Bug: 1. A small annoying insect that
should be squished on sight. 2. A person
who tends to write convoluted thesaurus
constructed sentences using large effer
vescent words that aren't quite nescient

in response to queries that are probably
auto-formulated.
Broadcasting System, Emergency: This
is a test. This is only a test. If this had
been a real column you would have
stopped reading by now.
Boar: Luckiest animal in the Chinese
Zodiac. Strong, yet weak. Beautiful, yet
ugly. Spontaneous, yet predictable. Hos
tile, yet peaceful. Your buddies are the
monkey and the rat. Your opposite is the
dragon.
Bengals, Cincinnati: Well, at least they
beat the point spread.
Bud Light: Well, at least they beat rbe
point spread.
Berkowit: A person whose only saving
quality is humor.
Berkowits: A large gathering of
Berkowit.
Beatrice: A large food manufacturing
conglomerate that processes 86 percent
of the food you eat.
Burger King: The chain that processess
the other 14 percent.
Bookstore, The Stanford: Why are they
always out of books just when you need
them?
Bye Bye.
