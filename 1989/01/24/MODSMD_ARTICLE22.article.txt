## Boesak headline was irresponsible 
### 
Writer's note: Below is a revised version
of the column 1 submitted for publication
last week. The Daily chose not to run it
because of a discrepancy over the factual
accuracy of my words. As a result, in my
attempts to print a column on freedom
of the press, I have had my own experience
with perhaps my own abuse, and denial,
of that freedom.
JAN. 13 I picked up my Daily and
was outraged by the front page head
line that faced me: "South African
says violence only chance for change."
The headline was referring to the Rev.
Allan Boesak's speech last Thursday
night, but it was false, and I knew it
was false because I attended Boesak's
speech and not once heard him call for
violence.
Boesak suggested that violence in
South Africa may be inevitable (meaning
violence of the blacks against the whites,
since the opposite is already occuring to
a deplorable* degree) if present policies of
apartheid do not change, but he never
advocated it.
Even when asked by a member of the
audience what the next step for black
South Africans should be, he refrained
from mentioning violence and instead
continued to discuss the non-violent
measures of resistance that blacks have
been and must persistently employ.
I remember listening to that question
and waiting for Boesak to suggest vio
lence and then, upon his answer, con
sciously registering that he did not and
could not. As a black South African he
cannot call for a violent overthrow of his
government. To do so would constitute
treason and could land him in jail, if not
the execution chamber.
All these thoughts circled my mind as
I stared at the headline again. Not only
was the headline false, but it was also
dangerous. My first reaction was to write
a letter to The Daily blasting it with
irresponsible journalism, and then I

My rights as an individual
have potential to be won
derful things, but these
rights are also privileges.

remembered that I already had a column.
This empty space was waiting for me
to vent my frustrations, but I wondered
whether it was appropriate for me to
criticize the same paper for which I write.
And as I grew a bit uncomfortable with
that idea, I began to question whether
my reaction to the headline was an over
reaction.
Over the weekend, however, my room
mate commented on her own disbelief
the headline, in its inacccuracy and dan
ger, and she sparked my fire again. She
told me that it was very appropriate for
me to criticize The Daily, for it illustrates
the possible objectivity of a newspaper
and demonstrates one of the greatest in
dividual rights I have as an American:
freedom of the press.
One of the aspects of Boesak's speech
that gripped me was his commentary on
the American people from an outsider's
perspective.
He pointed out a few of the many
hypocrisies in our society, such as our
government's claim that economic sanc
tions against South Africa do not work,
while those against Nicaragua do, and
our supposed advocacy of non-violence in
South Africa to bring about change but
our refusal to support any methods of
black non-violence, i.e., sanctions, strikes,
political protest, while we do support the
white government that uses violent force
to oppress the black mjyority.
He also remarked on American rights
and how much we take them for granted.
He said that he will never understand
why over half of Americans, who are

arrtong the few people in this world
granted the right to vote, do not vote.
He claimed that he would love to vote,
and if ever given the chance would cherish
the freedom.
I would guess he feels the same way
about freedom of the press, a freedom
Americans are granted but do not always
utilize, and a freedom that Boesak, a
world-renowned political and spiritual
leader, is denied and I, a college student,
am granted.
Along with this freedom, however,
comes responsibility. My rights as an in
dividual have potential to be wonderful
things, but these rights are also
privileges, and if in my exercise of them
I act irresponsibly and injure another
person, then I have abused that privilege.
I need to be particularly careful not to
abuse my privilege of the press because
something that is printed can never be
erased, and a libelous, or even false, state
ment can scar a person.
In its headline, The Daily was not care
ful enough with its freedom of the press
and acted irresponsibly. As a community,
Stanford was fortunate to have Boesak
speak here, and as a representative of
our community, The Daily did not give
him a warm reception.
What I find the most ironic, however,
is that Boesak comes from a country
where he is denied any freedom of the
press, and upon coming here, he became
a victim of our own disturbing misuse,
and possible abuse, of that freedom.

Editor's note: In an Editor's note on
the Opinions page Jan. 17, The Daily
apologized for the erroneous headline it
ran for the faoesak speech. It was an
unfortunate mistake for which The Daily
takes full responsibility. The Daily hopes
the readers read the factually correct story
and not just the headline.

Allan Boesak's speech last Thursday
night, but it was false, and I knew it
was false because I attended Boesak's
speech and not once heard him call for
violence.
Boesak suggested that violence in
South Africa may be inevitable (meaning
violence of the blacks against the whites,
since the opposite is already occuring to
a deplorable* degree) if present policies of
apartheid do not change, but he never
advocated it.
Even when asked by a member of the
audience what the next step for black
South Africans should be, he refrained
from mentioning violence and instead
continued to discuss the non-violent
measures of resistance that blacks have
been and must persistently employ.
I remember listening to that question
and waiting for Boesak to suggest vio
lence and then, upon his answer, con
sciously registering that he did not and
could not. As a black South African he
cannot call for a violent overthrow of his
government. To do so would constitute
treason and could land him in jail, if not
the execution chamber.
All these thoughts circled my mind as
I stared at the headline again. Not only
was the headline false, but it was also
dangerous. My first reaction was to write
a letter to The Daily blasting it with
irresponsible journalism, and then I

My rights as an individual
have potential to be won
derful things, but these
rights are also privileges.

remembered that I already had a column.
This empty space was waiting for me
to vent my frustrations, but I wondered
whether it was appropriate for me to
criticize the same paper for which I write.
And as I grew a bit uncomfortable with
that idea, I began to question whether
my reaction to the headline was an over
reaction.
Over the weekend, however, my room
mate commented on her own disbelief
the headline, in its inacccuracy and dan
ger, and she sparked my fire again. She
told me that it was very appropriate for
me to criticize The Daily, for it illustrates
the possible objectivity of a newspaper
and demonstrates one of the greatest in
dividual rights I have as an American:
freedom of the press.
One of the aspects of Boesak's speech
that gripped me was his commentary on
the American people from an outsider's
perspective.
He pointed out a few of the many
hypocrisies in our society, such as our
government's claim that economic sanc
tions against South Africa do not work,
while those against Nicaragua do, and
our supposed advocacy of non-violence in
South Africa to bring about change but
our refusal to support any methods of
black non-violence, i.e., sanctions, strikes,
political protest, while we do support the
white government that uses violent force
to oppress the black mjyority.
He also remarked on American rights
and how much we take them for granted.
He said that he will never understand
why over half of Americans, who are

arrtong the few people in this world
granted the right to vote, do not vote.
He claimed that he would love to vote,
and if ever given the chance would cherish
the freedom.
I would guess he feels the same way
about freedom of the press, a freedom
Americans are granted but do not always
utilize, and a freedom that Boesak, a
world-renowned political and spiritual
leader, is denied and I, a college student,
am granted.
Along with this freedom, however,
comes responsibility. My rights as an in
dividual have potential to be wonderful
things, but these rights are also
privileges, and if in my exercise of them
I act irresponsibly and injure another
person, then I have abused that privilege.
I need to be particularly careful not to
abuse my privilege of the press because
something that is printed can never be
erased, and a libelous, or even false, state
ment can scar a person.
In its headline, The Daily was not care
ful enough with its freedom of the press
and acted irresponsibly. As a community,
Stanford was fortunate to have Boesak
speak here, and as a representative of
our community, The Daily did not give
him a warm reception.
What I find the most ironic, however,
is that Boesak comes from a country
where he is denied any freedom of the
press, and upon coming here, he became
a victim of our own disturbing misuse,
and possible abuse, of that freedom.

Editor's note: In an Editor's note on
the Opinions page Jan. 17, The Daily
apologized for the erroneous headline it
ran for the faoesak speech. It was an
unfortunate mistake for which The Daily
takes full responsibility. The Daily hopes
the readers read the factually correct story
and not just the headline.
Writer's note: Below is a revised version
of the column 1 submitted for publication
last week. The Daily chose not to run it
because of a discrepancy over the factual
accuracy of my words. As a result, in my
attempts to print a column on freedom
of the press, I have had my own experience
with perhaps my own abuse, and denial,
of that freedom.

was outraged by the front page head
