## The 						Bug tragically blows the hair off the Thinker 
### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
No doubt many of you are still
recovering from last week's ex
egeses on Einstein and Pringle's,
and so this week the Bug will
issue forth each of his inves
tigatorial fruits quickly and rela
tively neatly.
Although I hesitate to tamper
with the well-established objec
tivity of this column, the Bug
would like to bring up a few ques
tions of his own.
What's with that huge bedsheet
hanging from the ceiling of
Maples Pavilion? Is there any
thing more embarrassing than
having a gigantic banner hanging
in your basketball arena which
proudly boasts of winning the
1942 NCAA championship? Was
that before or after the advent of
jumping?
Boy, just the thought of that
banner must strike fear and envy
in the hearts of basketball teams
across the country.
Dear Bug,
There is a stretch of Highway
580 which runs between Rts. 680
and 205. Along the way, near
Livermore, are several hundred
large wind machines.
My question is: Are the wind
machines started naturally by the
wind currents, or are they

manually operated?
— Don Kwicksoat
The machines are manually
operated. Every night a really big
guy walks across the state giving
each windmill a big spin. He does
this just before he pokes holes in
the sky to make new stars.
Actually, the truth is pretty un
believable as well. According to
Mike Batham, a research engineer
for the state energy commission,

there are 15,000 of those tall
white oddities in California. Of
the 15,000 windmills, 8,000 are
located around the area you have
asked about, Don. They are all
started by wind currents.
The wind farms were first set
up in 1981 as a cost-effective en
ergy resource. Technically speak
ing, they operate thusly: Thor's
mighty winds blow strong
through the land propelling the
windmill blades. Their spinning
turns magically into electricity
which is what makes televisions
work which is what makes every
body happy.
Dear Bug,
Why does Rodin's Thinker have
that flap of hair on the left side
of his head?
— Albert Elsen
Rodin was a sucky sculptor,
that's why.
Actually, there's a couple of
things going on here. First, Rodin
often left his works seemingly in
complete. In part, he did this to
manifest the role of the artist in
portraying a subject.
In addition, projections like that
flap bring the sculpture into the
world of the observer by extending
beyond the space of the subject
and occupying space that if empty
might act as a buffer between
viewer and sculpture. Rodin
wanted the public to get emotion

ally involved in his work, not just
look at it.
Second, the Thinker originally
appeared as part of the Gates of
Hell, watching over them not as
a judge, but as an observer, as
the artist. Of course, the artist
whose work inspired the Gates of
Hell was Dante. Classic portrayals
of Dante show him in a trademark
hat. The flap could be seen as an
suggestion of that hat.
Dear Bug,
Whatever happened to Tuesday
Films?
— Victor Mature
Geez, I dunno. But they're back
now after a trimester off. Whether
or not that guy who looks like
Vitas Gerulitas will still be giving
introductory remarks, 1 also don't
know.
Unfortunately, this trimester's
series will not include a showing
of my grandmother's favorite
film, "Salo." The third best film
of the 1980s, "Brazil," will be
shown, though. This will probably
make it the only film ever to be
screened at both the Flicks and
Tuesday Films, but the Tuesday
Films print is unedited.
Dear Bug,
Are there more white, Univer
sity seal embossed trucks, Cush
men, etc. on campus than stu
dents ?
— B.A. Baracus

No, there are not. But the point
made by your exaggeration is a
good one. There are lots of
University-owned vehicles, and
the Stanford Trucks Department
is one of the most respected in
the Pac-10.
Last year, at the 12th Annual
Tractor Pull/Funny Car Pac-10
Championships, Stanford brought
home five medals. These included
two golds, in the Cushman Quar
ter Mile race and in the Noisiest
Construction Vehicle competition.
The Cardinal have held the con
ference title in the latter for the
past eight years.
Despite their apparent übiquity,
there are only 485 University
owned vehicles compared to about
12,000 students. Of these 485,

about 190 are those white trucks
and vans. The University has
vehicles for all purposes, from
mowing lawns to delivering
campus mail.
The most disturbing revelation
experienced by the Bug in his in
vestigation of this question was
that Stanford has paid tens of
thousands of dollars for forklifts,
but not a single Lincoln cent on
spoonlifts. Now you know why
there are so many spoons lying
all over the University grounds.
Dear Bug,
Who is this Bobby McFcrrin
g^y?
— Shaggy
Never heard of him.
Until next week, the Bug has
spoken.
