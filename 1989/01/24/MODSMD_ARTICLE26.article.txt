## Goofus and Gallant watch a Super Bowl 
### 
All those with personal
dilemmas, despair not.
It's time for the return
of Goofus and Gallant, those
madcap magicians of moral
mayhem.

There were some definite les
sons to be learned from last
week's events, what with Super
Bowl XXIII, Bud Bowl I and
other happenihgs around Stan
ford.
So, once again, we give our
regards to the folks over at
Highlights(TM) magazine,
which, I assure you, is in every
doctor's and dentist's office in
the world. If you've never seen
it, you've led a deprived,
miscreant life.
The Super Bowl
Goofus bet on the 49ers by
7 V2 points, and lost bigtime.
Gallant bet that Cincinnati
Bengal Mike Martin would win
the Last Annual NFL Talent
Showcase. Even if Martin had
lost, since no one could stand
watching it anymore, no bookie
would have been able to deny
that he won.
Goofus thought the Bud
Bowl was cool.
Gallant, well, he thought it
was kind of cool too. But he
didn't admit that to anyone.
Gallant's sort of shy that way.
If Goofus won the Super
Bowl, he'd be going to Dis
neyland!
If Gallant won the Super
Bowl, he wouldn't go right to
Disneyland. He'd sell the rights
to his life story to the highest
bidder among Bay Area news
papers, and buy Disneyland.
Men's hoops
But this is all meaningless
tripe and ennui compared to
Goofus and Gallant's journey
to Maples Pavilion Saturday to
see Stanford host the Bruins
of UCLA.
In the second half, UCLA
guard Pooh Richardson fouls
out of the game. A familiar
monotone emits from the
crowd.
Goofus is confused. He

doesn't want to upset Gallant,
but he really wishes he knew,
"Are they booing, or are they
saying Pooh?"
Poor Goofus. Unbeknownst
to him, some fans are booing
and some are saying "Pooh."
Goofus doesn't realize this is
one of life's little tricks.
So, Goofus gets an an idea.
This boo-Pooh stuff is too tech
nical for him. But he figures
one thing must be true. Cheer
loudly for a Stanford player.
Then the crowd will love you.
Stanford guard Todd Lichti
steps to the free-throw line,
trying to break the Pacific 10
Conference record for consecu
tive foul shots. Everyone is
quiet.
Except for a lone, loud voice
in the stands. Goofus is going
crazy, yelling and screaming.
"AHHH!," he says.
Lichti tries to pay no mind,
but he can't help but be dis
tracted. He alters his free
throw ever-so-slightly, and it
misses. No record.
Gallant is furious. He tries
to point out to Goofus what
has just happened. He em
phasizes the magnitude of
Lichti's lost opportunity.
Goofus blames Lichti's miss
on bad coaching and Prop. 42.

If Gallant won the
Super Bowl, he
wouldn't go right
to Disneyland.
He'd sell the
rights to his life
story to the high
est bidder among
Bay Area news
papers, and buy
Disneyland.

The Stanford Daily
There are some final lessons
concerning sports and jour
nalism, which the reader may
find particularly timely, that
Goofus and Gallant can help
illuminate.
Goofus signed up as a news
writer at The Stanford Daily.
He worked 12 hours doing re
search, organization and being
edited, and got paid $15. That's


JON WEISMAN
$1.25 per hour. "It was reward
ing," Goofus says.
Gallant writes sports stories. He
calls the coach to get the score
and the quote saying "We won
because we scored more points."
Or, he takes the story off the

Associated Press wire and adds a
paragraph at the top mentioning
Stanford somewhere. This takes
15 minutes. He gets paid $15.
That's $60 per hour. "No expla
nation necessary," Gallant says.
Goofus moved on to be an
Opinions Page columnist. He then
found out you're supposed to be
relevant. Justifiably or not,
Goofus was ragged upon merci
lessly. And, as has been noted on

the Opinions Page recently, he
gets no pay — but for a good
reason.
Gallant writes a column for the
sports section, where there are no
standards. He can be abominably
bad, and never hear about it. And,
he gets $20 per column — for his
time, effort and infinite patience.
As Gallant will tell you, it's
great work if you can get it.
