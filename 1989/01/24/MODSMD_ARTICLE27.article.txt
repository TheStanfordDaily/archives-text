# Golfers in sixth at USC Invite
## 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
After a long winter's rest, the
No. 9 nationally-ranked Stanford
women's golf team resumed tour
nament play yestfrdav at the Uni
versity of Southern California In
tercollegiate. But after a disap
pointing first round of play, the
Cardinal rests in sixth place over
all.
The team shot a 329 over 18
holes (the top four finishers'
scores are added together for the
team score), 16 shots behind tour
nament leader New Mexico State.
Freshman Stephanie Davis led the
five Stanford golfers with an 80,
and is currently in a three-way
tie for ninth place.
Despite the poor showing, Stan
ford is by no means out of con
tention. On a cold and rainy day
at the Oakmont Country Club,
not one golfer in the 12-team tour
nament shot for par. San Jose
State's Pat Hurst leads the field
with a two-over 74.
"Nobody had a good round
today (for Stanford)," said soph
omore Jodi Figley, who shot an
81 for the day. "Everybody shot
high. But we didn't lose much
ground. Normally, we'd be in
trouble."
Indeed, only seven shots sepa
rate Stanford from second-place
SJSU. New Mexico State will be
hard to catch, however. The
Aggies had a pair of golfers finish
ing with 755, and sit way in front
with a 313.
The harsh conditions may have
been a shock for some of the na
tion's top teams. USC came in
the favorite, with a No. 2 national
ranking and the advantage of
their home course, but could only
manage fifth place, four shots
ahead of the Cardinal.
New Mexico State's play comes
as a surprise, considering the
Aggies' 12th-place ranking. Also
an upstart is unranked U.S. In
ternational, who landed in fourth
place, 11 shots out of first. Third
ranked Oklahoma State was

nowhere to be be found.
The Oakmont course doesn't
help matters. After # the LPGA
held a tour event there last year,
it was rated as the most difficult
of the 1988 season. "The course
is very long, under ideal condi
tions, and with the weather we
had today, I think it was double
the difficulty," said freshman
Adele Moore, who finished at the
bottom of the Stanford corps with
an 86.
Moore, the top junior recruit in
the nation last year, is coming off
a great showing at the Cardinal's
last tournament. She finished in
third place overall, leading Stan
ford to a third-place finish in the
USIU tournament last November.
Asked to compare that course
with this one, Moore simply
stated, "There is no comparison.
USIU was a joke compared to
this."
The long layoff could be affect
ing the Stanford team. Moore,
Stanford's number-one player
going into this tournament, was
certainly looking for an explana
tion for her play. "I haven't shot
this badly in about three years
(in tournament play)," the stand
out from Texas said.
Even though the Cardinal
didn't break 80 as a team, the
players remain hopeful. "We need
to get into the low 705," said
Moore. "The top three is a good
goal, but if we do get into the low
70s with consistency, we can win
it despite today."
Sophomore Michele Lyford, who
shot an 85 and was fourth for
Stanford behind Stephanie Parel
(83), was positive about the
team's chances at USC this year
because of the addition of fresh
men Mt)ore and Davis. "I think
we will do better than last year,"
she said last week.
Only 36 more holes over the
next two days will tell if Stanford
can bounce back and finish the
tournament better than it started.
Coach Tim Baldwin, optimistic
before the tournament, undoubt
edly hopes so.

place, 11 shots out of first. Third
ranked Oklahoma State was

nowhere to be be found.
The Oakmont course doesn't
help matters. After # the LPGA
held a tour event there last year,
it was rated as the most difficult
of the 1988 season. "The course
is very long, under ideal condi
tions, and with the weather we
had today, I think it was double
the difficulty," said freshman
Adele Moore, who finished at the
bottom of the Stanford corps with
an 86.
Moore, the top junior recruit in
the nation last year, is coming off
a great showing at the Cardinal's
last tournament. She finished in
third place overall, leading Stan
ford to a third-place finish in the
USIU tournament last November.
Asked to compare that course
with this one, Moore simply
stated, "There is no comparison.
USIU was a joke compared to
this."
The long layoff could be affect
ing the Stanford team. Moore,
Stanford's number-one player
going into this tournament, was
certainly looking for an explana
tion for her play. "I haven't shot
this badly in about three years
(in tournament play)," the stand
out from Texas said.
Even though the Cardinal
didn't break 80 as a team, the
players remain hopeful. "We need
to get into the low 705," said
Moore. "The top three is a good
goal, but if we do get into the low
70s with consistency, we can win
it despite today."
Sophomore Michele Lyford, who
shot an 85 and was fourth for
Stanford behind Stephanie Parel
(83), was positive about the
team's chances at USC this year
because of the addition of fresh
men Mt)ore and Davis. "I think
we will do better than last year,"
she said last week.
Only 36 more holes over the
next two days will tell if Stanford
can bounce back and finish the
tournament better than it started.
Coach Tim Baldwin, optimistic
before the tournament, undoubt
edly hopes so.
