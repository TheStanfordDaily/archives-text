I he Stanford men's and women's fencing
teams continued their assault on the fortress
of the Western Regional Championships this
weekend with victories over a tough UC-Santa
Cruz squad. Competing at Santa Cruz on Sat
urday, both Cardinal teams came away with
close, hard-earned wins. The men's team ad
vanced their overall record to 14-1 with a
14-13 triumph on Saturday, while the women
attained their victory after an 8-8 match was
awarded to them because they had more
touches scored.
Starting women fencers Olivia Judson,
Tracy Schmidt, Grace Chang, and Elisabeth
Spilman each went 2-2 to post the 8-8 score
that was decided on touches. "It was very

close," said women's Coach Sherry Pos
thumus.
She also described her own team as a con
sistent, "well-rounded team." The lady duelists
are still without injured senior Juliet Johnson.
Posthumus hopes to have Johnson back in
time for the Western Regional Championships,
but says that the chances of her return do
not look very good.
Men's Coach Zoran Tulum explained that
the match against Santa Cruz was not as
close as the score seemed to indicate. "We got
ahead early and then just got too relaxed,"
he said. Indeed, the Cardinal sabre fighters
claimed an easy 7-2 victory, led by the unde
feated play of freshman Leonard D'Amico.
The foil team then posted a 6-3 record to give
the Cardinal a comfortable 13-5 lead. Needing
only one bout to clinch the win, the epee team

relaxed and gave up seven out of their eight
bouts. But senior Steve Schmidt got the single
needed win to give Stanford a 14-13 result
and their 14th win for the season.
The match with Santa Cruz was the final
dual match of the season for the Cardinal,
and marked the end of regular-season play.
The men finished only one touch away from
an undefeated season, as their only loss came
against Harvard on the final touch of the
match. The women's team also had an im
pressive record as they now look forward to
the Pacific 10 Conference Invitational and the
Western Regional Championships.
Both coaches expect victories in the upcom
ing championships. The men look to improve
on their fourth-place finish in the Western
Regionals last year, while the women hope to
achieve their sixth straight championship.
