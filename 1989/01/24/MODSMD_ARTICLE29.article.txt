# Montana rises to the occasion, as always

MIAMI (AP) — Joe Montana,
of all people, was dizzy from over
excitement with a Super Bowl title
on the line.
Montana stepped back to let the
moment pass, then put the finish
ing touches on the most dramatic
performance of a Hall of Fame
career.
As with all past adversity this
season, he had exactly the right
answer to rescue himself and the
San Francisco 49ers from trouble
on Sunday.
"Joe Montana is not human,"
said an awed Cris Collinsworth of
Cincinnati after Montana en
gineered a come-from-behind 20-
16 victory for his third Super
Bowl triumph. "I don't want to
call him a god, but he's definitely
somewhere in between.
"I have never seen a guy that
every single time he's had the
chips down and people are count
ing him out, he's come back," the
veteran wide receiver said. "I
don't know what else Joe Mon
tana has to do to prove that he's
the greatest player to ever play
this game."
Coming off what Coach Bill
Walsh had called his greatest
game ever against Chicago in the
NFC championship game, Mon
tana outdid himself. As in the
28-3 win over the Bears, when he
defied 30-mph winds in throwing
for 288 yards and three touch
downs, the numbers only began
to tell the story.
This time he was 23 for 36 for
a Super Bowl-record 357 yards
and two TDs. More impressive
than the figures was the way he
compiled them — passing for 254
yards in the second half and or
chestrating drives of 85 and 92
yards for fourth-quarter touch
downs after the Bengals had twice
taken the lead
On the first score, he dissected
the Bengals' secondarv and moved

the team the length of the field
in 91 seconds. Disdaining the
49ers' trademark ball-control
short-passing game, he gobbled up
the yardage in three passes, a 42-
yarder to Roger Craig and a 31-
yarder and a 14-yard TD to Rice
after barely escaping an intercep
tion.
Montana's leadership was char
acteristically quiet, particularly
during the game-winning drive in
the final t'aree minutes.
"We just brought it together
and said 'Look, let's go, we can
get this done,'" he said. "We were
in a tough position but we never
gave up. We had to be confident,
because we had done it in the
past."
Taking over at the San Fran
cisco 8-yard line with three
minutes to play and trailing 16-
13, he completed five passes on
the championship drive. Two went
to Rice for 44 yards, two to Craig
for 21 yards more.
Before the march was com
pleted, however, Montana became
woozy after overthrowing Rice.
"I almost called timeout be
cause I was sitting there scream
ing as loud as I could, with the
crowd noise, and I almost hyper
ventilated," Montana said. "I got
dizzy, but then it kind of faded
away. ... As I was going back I
still felt it, so I didn't take a
chance, I let it go."
With the Bengals' defenders
warily guarding against another
pass to Rice or Craig, Montana
slipped the game-winner over the
middle to John Taylor in the end
zone with 34 seconds remaining.
It was another bit of clutch "Joe
Cool" artistry that his teammates
had come to expect but could only
dare to hope for again.
"It was typical Joe Montana —
cool and calm," said 49er 'center
