# Prop. 42 raises question of discrimination in sports
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Editorial staff 
Although it will have no effect
on Stanford athletic recruiting,
the NCAA's new Proposition 42
has raised questions at the Uni
versity and elsewhere about racial
discrimination in college athletics.
Prop. 42 is an extension of the
controversial NCAA bylaw 5-1-j,
which was originally passed six
years ago. That rule, known as
Prop. 48, stipulated that fresh
man student-athletes would only
be eligible for scholarships if they
had a 2.0 grade point average in
college preparatory classes and
scored at least a 700 on the SAT.
Under Prop. 48, athletes who
only partially met the standards
could enter the university with a
scholarship, but would lose a year
of eligibility and could not play
or practice with the team. During
that year, the students would have

to prove themselves in the class
room to become athletically eligi
ble again.
The new rule will take away
the first-year scholarship for in
eligible students, forcing them to
pay for schooling, give up college
altogether or improve their aca
demics at a junior college before
transferring to a four-year insti
tution. -
Stanford voted for this new
rule, while Harvard University,
UCLA, Georgetown University
and Columbia University voted
against it last week. The rule
passed by a nine vote margin,
(163-154). As a whole, the Pacific
-10 conference abstained on both
rules.
According to Jerry Porras, a
professor in the Graduate School
of Business and Stanford's faculty
representative to the NCAA, the
University's decision to vote for
Prop. 42 was made by Porras,

run by making high schools raise
