# Prop. 42 raises question of discrimination in sports
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Editorial staff 
Although it will have no effect
on Stanford athletic recruiting,
the NCAA's new Proposition 42
has raised questions at the Uni
versity and elsewhere about racial
discrimination in college athletics.
Prop. 42 is an extension of the
controversial NCAA bylaw 5-1-j,
which was originally passed six
years ago. That rule, known as
Prop. 48, stipulated that fresh
man student-athletes would only
be eligible for scholarships if they
had a 2.0 grade point average in
college preparatory classes and
scored at least a 700 on the SAT.
Under Prop. 48, athletes who
only partially met the standards
could enter the university with a
scholarship, but would lose a year
of eligibility and could not play
or practice with the team. During
that year, the students would have

to prove themselves in the class
room to become athletically eligi
ble again.
The new rule will take away
the first-year scholarship for in
eligible students, forcing them to
pay for schooling, give up college
altogether or improve their aca
demics at a junior college before
transferring to a four-year insti
tution. -
Stanford voted for this new
rule, while Harvard University,
UCLA, Georgetown University
and Columbia University voted
against it last week. The rule
passed by a nine vote margin,
(163-154). As a whole, the Pacific
-10 conference abstained on both
rules.
According to Jerry Porras, a
professor in the Graduate School
of Business and Stanford's faculty
representative to the NCAA, the
University's decision to vote for
Prop. 42 was made by Porras,

These are the results of two rounds of
ballots. Each of the schools listed voted
the same way twice. The Pacific 10 Con
ference abstained twice.

Athletic Director Andy Geiger and
Cheryl Levick, an assistant ath
letic director.
Porras said that Prop. 42 will
help student athletes in the long
run by making high schools raise
their educational standards, but
"in the short run there will be
difficulties and costs that will
have to be borne by some indi
viduals."
It is these individuals that Prop.
42's detractors are worried about.
Since 86 percent of the victims of
Prop. 48 are black, many critcs
feel that Prop. 42's purpose is to
prevent lower-income black ath
letes from attending college. Some
have gone as far as to charge the
NCAA with racism.
UCLA basketball Coach Jim
Harrick is against both rules be
cause he feels that inner-city
blacks are culturally disadvan
taged, especially when they are
taking the SAT. "We're getting
people making the rules that have

never been in the houses of south
central L.A. where the parents'
main concern is feeding the
families. Some of these young kids
have not had the [educationall ad
vantages of growing up in middle
class," he said.
While Stanford basketball
Coach Mike Montgomery agrees
that the SAT may be culturally
biased, he feels that Prop. 42 is
a move in the right direction.
"[Prop. 42] is not an easy ques
tion but we do need to indicate
that there have got to be some
minimums. The purpose of college
is to educate, not to prepare kids
for the NBA. I think we're headed
in the right direction as far as
cultural bias in the SAT," he said.
Montgomery added that he hoped
the furor around the legislation
would help put more focus on ac
ademic standards and cultural
bias.
