### Andrew von Nordenflycht Staff writer 
With a leap, a swing, and a
dismount the Stanford wom
en's gymnastics team vaulted
into the season last weekend
with a meet at Fullerton State
on Friday and at California on
Saturday.
Though Stanford suffered
losses at both meets, 186.20 to
180.20 at Fullerton and 182.45
to 181.80 at Cal, that was the
only bad news of the weekend,
as the team's performance was
very encouraging. Coach
Homer Sardina said the meets
went "really well. I am pleased
with the way it came out."
It was the first time the team
had scored above 180 at an
opening meet, and with the ex
pected improvement, this aus
picious beginning promises a
year of success. Last year, the
team opened the season with
a 176 and ended the season
averaging 183. With this week
end's average of 181, the team
seems headed for a finish at
187, which Sardina described
as "incredible."
Leading the team with out
standing performances were
co-captains Dina Amoroso, a
junior, and senior Sheri Even
son.
With a 9.4 third-place finish
on the uneven bars, along with
high scores in the three other
events, Amoroso placed second
in the all-around competition
at Fullerton with a 37.05. At
Cal she placed second in the
uneven bars with a 9.5.

Evenson turned in excellent
performances both days also,
with a second-place 9.2 on the
balance beam at Fullerton and
personal bests of 9.5 on the
floor exercises and 37.15 in the
all-around for a third-place
finish at Cal.
"1 felt good about my per
formance," Evenson com
mented, adding that she suc
cessfully connected with some
uncertain moves. Sardina
elatedly remarked that both
veterans are "on their way to
great things this year."
Some pleasant surprises also
emerged this weekend, namely
sophomore Jenny Bloom and
freshman Nicki Kobrine.
With outstanding floor exer
cises at Cal and superb bars at
Fullerton, Bloom looks to be
heading for 9.5 performances
in several events. "She may
really surprise us," said Sar
dina.
Sardina also had praise for
Kobrine, whose "excellent
meet" at Cal has marked her
as a rising star. Excited about
her first college competition,
Kobrine thought she "per
formed well ... I hit all my
routines."
This excitement about the
encouraging signs of the first
two meets pervades the team.
Evenson labeled the competi
tion "very positive," adding
that the team was "unified We
came together and supported
each other." She was also ex
cited about the potential for im
