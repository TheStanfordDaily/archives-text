# Ujamaa events kept from public
## Fear of adverse reaction motivated decision to limit knowledge 
### Nathanael Cousins Staff writer 
When the factual report outlining the
recent racist incidents at Ujamaa House
was released last week, many students
learned about the backlash of events
for the first time.
According to the black theme house's
residents and staff, they decided not to
publicize the backlash because there had
already been enough damaging publicity
about the house and they thought the
events could be misconstrued by the
press.
The backlash to the fall Ujamaa in
cidents was kept quiet until the release
of the report because, "There had al
ready been so much trauma, and we
didn't want to add to that," according
to Ujamaa theme associate Louis Jack
son.
The final report released last Tuesday
by University President Donald Ken
nedy on the incidents at Ujamaa in
cluded evidence of backlash in the
Ujamaa residence. According to the
report, typewritten sheets which read

"Non-blacks leave our home you are not
welcome in Ujamaa," in all capitals were
found under the doors of two white
Ujamaa residents, and a third flier was
posted on a bulletin board. Although
The Daily knew about the fliers, it could
not publish the incident because Ujamaa
residents would not confirm that they
had seen the fliers.
An unknown person also punched
holes in the pictures of all but three or
four of the non-black freshmen and one
black freshmen on the picture "frosh
board" in Ujamaa, according to the
report.
Warnings reading "You shall pay for
your actions," and "Tonite is the nite,"
both in all capitals, were written on the
message pad outside Ben Dugan's door
in the weeks following the incident.
Stickers reading "Avenge Ujaama
smash the Honkie Oppressors," with
Ujamaa misspelled, were found in White
Plaza and reported in November by The
Daily.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
said he did not suspect a cover-up of
the backlash incidents and that the

report could have been released in De
cember.
However, because Lyons feared the
report would not be read during finals,
and there would not be time for public
reaction, he delayed publication of the
report until last week. Lyons said the
report was important because it was
comprehensive and served as a report
to the community.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson said members of the Office
of Residential Education believed that
publicity about the backlash would not
have helped the situation.
"There generally is a policy to be open
and honest," Robinson said. "Things
that are publicly disclosed would have
been widely known and we could have
commented. There is a Lot in the resi
dences that we don't see. Ujamaa was
under public scrutiny and they had the
desire to let things die down."
"The thinking was to see if we
couldn't let this thing die down. Why
keep it going?" added Robinson.
Jackson explained that publish
ing the incidents would have had
a negative effect on the Ujamaa
residents. "Number one, we were
concerned for our residents," said
Jackson, also the secretary for the
Black Student Union. "Number
two, we didn't want to be slammed
by the Stanford community any
more."
Jackson was also concerned
with the protection of B.J. Kerr,
the black student who was tar
geted by two white freshmen with
a defaced poster of Beethoven. In
an emergency meeting Oct. 16 at
Ujamaa, Dugan and Gus Heldt
admitted to painting a derogatory
caricature of a black man and pos
ting it outside of Kerr's room.
"If we had made a big deal out

of the backlash, the focus would
have been on those 'crazy black
people, those radicals,' " Jackson
said. "If we had released the other
information, people would have
assumed that (Kerr] did it â€”
justly or not. We would have been
justified [not publicizing the back
lash] just for the sake of protec
ting him."
However, some students outside
of Ujamaa did not agree with the
decision not to publish the in
cidences of backlash.
"I think some effort was made
by people in Ujamaa to quiet
things down," said Naranja junior
Jim Spencer.
"People were working towards
punishment of [Dugan and HeldtJ
and there certainly was not as
much publicity about the back
lash. The threats were grounds
for suspension, and I don't know
if there has been any investiga
tion," Spencer said.
