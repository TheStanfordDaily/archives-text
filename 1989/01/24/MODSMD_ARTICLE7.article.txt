# Possibility of international theme house discussed
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
The Committee on Undergraduate Res
idential Affairs debated Friday a proposal
to create an international focus house to
help undergraduate international students
ease into living in the United States.
Although many University officials have
been supportive of the proposal, there is
some concern over larger principles in
volved, such as the current criteria for ac
cepting theme house proposals and the di
rection Stanford housing may take if many
theme house proposals are accepted.
The proposal asks the Office of Residen
tial Education to create a "comfortable at
mosphere" for incoming freshmen and al
low upper class students to help freshmen
"reduce the pressure to adapt too quickly
into American culture," according to the
proposal, which was submitted in Decem
ber.
"Being an international student can be
intimidating at first," said freshman
Haydee Saffar, one of the proposal's three
authors. "A small group in a theme house
can serve as a catalyst to get programs

together and to invite and challenge foreign
policy professors."
If the committee accepts the proposal,
which may be as early as February, the
house could be created by next year.
Otero RF Dennis Matthies, a member of
the committee, said, "I hope (the interna
tional focus house) will happen. Theme
houses are terribly important. They're also
a great way of involving faculty in residen
ces. "
Matthies said his only reservation would
be if theme houses isolated all of a class
of student. But he and freshman Lucia
Volk, who co-authored the proposal, agree
that there are more than enough interna
tional students to reside and participate in
a focus house and non-thematic dormitor
ies.
But Alice Supton, associate dean of Res
idential Education, said some faculty op
posed such a theme house. They feel "in
ternational students are already taking a
big step of independence in going to school
in the United States and should experience
normal undergraduate living arrange
ments," she said.
