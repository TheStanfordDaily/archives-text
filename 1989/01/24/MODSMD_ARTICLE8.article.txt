SAN FRANCISCO - The Rev. Des
mond Tutu expressed hope yesterday
that the Episcopalian background of
George Bush would prompt the new U.S.
president to show "more compassion"
toward the plight of black South
Africans than did his predecessor.
Tutu, the Archbishop of Capetown,
South Africa' and a Nobel Peace Prize
winner, said in a press conference that
he was hopeful that Hush would "spare"
South Africans "the hypocrisy" that has
riddled the policies of the Reagan Ad
ministration
Tutu is in San Francisco this week
for the National Conference of Trinity
Institute, a continuing-education pro
gram dedicated to theological renewal.
The conference is being held at Grace
Cathedral and continues through Wed

nesday.
Addressing the theme of this year's
conference, "Spirituality and Justice,"
Tutu said that the two "are not two
disparate entities. . . . You cannot love
God and not [love] your neighbor."
Although Tutu said the United States
and other Western nations possess "cri
tical influence" over the white South
African government, he did not assign
the same significance to outside eco
nomic constraints as the Rev. Allan
Boesak did in his speech at Stanford
this month.
Boesak is also a clergyman and a pro
minent black South African anti
apartheid leader.
In his keynote speech at the Martin
Luther King Commemoration Program,
Boesak said that the "unbelievable hy
pocrisy" of the United States and other
Western nations in imposing sanctions

and disinvesting from South
Africa had severely constricted
the possibility of non-violent resis
tance.
However, Tutu said yesterday
that black South Africans "are not
wedded to sanctions per se."
The end of apartheid, Tutu said,
"is going to happen." Although he
could not project a precise date,
he said "no one doubts it will
happen."
Tutu said that individuals com
mitted to change should not give
\lp hope. "One person can make
a difference," he said. "Even if
they light just one candle, it can
dispel the darkness."
Tutu said that advocates of
change must have patience. "You
can only eat an elephant one way:

one piece at a time," he said.
A "peaceful coexistance" be
tween black and white South
Africans could become a reality
in South Africa following the abol
tion of apartheid, Tutu said. He
added that South Africans can
look toward its neighbor Zimabwe,
formerly called South Rhodesia,
as an example of a successfully
integrated society.
In 1980, the white minority
government in South Rhodesia
was overthrown by the black
nationalist leader Robert Mugabe.
Since coming to power, Mugabe
has made a serious effort to keep
white citizens in the country and
has allowed them prominent roles
in government and the country's
economy.
Unlike some anti-apartheid
proponents such as the late Step
hen Biko, who was banned from
public appearance, Tutu is al
lowed to travel relatively freely.
