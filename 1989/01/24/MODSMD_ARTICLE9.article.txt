# Bush to shift education policies
##

Editor's note: This is the third
article in a three-part series con
cerning the challenges that face
the Bush administration.

Education policy during the
Bush administration will un
dergo a significant revision from
the confrontational strategy
which was the hallmark of the
Reagan years, according to ex
perts at Stanford.
Limitations on extra funding
for federal education programs
will be an important factor
shaping policy, according to Ed
ucation Prof. Henry Levin. "The
problem in implementing new
programs is money. . . . The
Bush education department will
be very constrained because of
the budget,"he said.
As a result of this situation,
most of the proposed policy
changes involve a shift in em
phasis rather than a call for in
creased funding, said Levin, who
is also the director of the Center
for Educational Research at
Stanford.
President Bush, however, has

not yet made any concrete de
cisions on federal education
policy, Levin said.
The direction of Bush's poli
cies will be determined by who
is appointed to the lower level
positions at the Education De
partment, according to Educa
tion Prof. Lee Shulman.
"Even if Cavozos (Bush's Ed
ucation Secretary) wants to
push policies focusing on minor
ity education, if the bureaucrats
who implement the policy aren't
interested in it, the policy will
fail," Shulman said.
Cavazos drew high marks
from both Levin and Shulman
for his accomodating attitude
toward the educational es
tablishment, as compared with
the previous Education Secre
tary William Bennett.
"Bennett set himself up as ac
tively antagonistic toward the
educational community. He
created a rift that damaged his
ability to affect educational
reform," Shulman said.
Stanford senior Peter Thiel,
who worked as an intern in the
Education Department last
summer, asserted that the new
atmosphere of cooperation fos

tered by Cavazos may not be
good for education in United
States.
"Cavazos will be able to make
the current system run more
smoothly with cooperation, but
he will sidestep dealing with the
ingrained institutional prob
lems," Thiel said.
Levin described two possible
areas for change from current
policy, which include implement
ing a public school voucher sys
tem and placing greater empha
sis on an improved education
for disadvantaged students.
Such a voucher program,
known as the choice program,
would allow parents to send
their children to the public
school of their choice, rather
than the school prescribed by
their district, Levin said.
"Bush and Cavazos will put
more stress on minority educa
tion because of the evolving con
census that people from minor
ity communities will form the
labor force of the future. Bush
recognizes that the future suc
cess of the U.S. economy will
depend on improving the edu
cation of this sector of the work
force," Levin said.
