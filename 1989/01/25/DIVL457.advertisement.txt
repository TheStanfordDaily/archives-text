The ASSU Fee Refund?!
It's that time of the quarter again. Yes, time for you to pick up
your ASSU Fee Refund. So, why does the ASSU bother to take
your money in the first place, if only to give it back to you every
quarter! Just one more way for the bureaucracy here to get you
to stand in lines! Hopefully this will explain what the ASSU
Fee is and why the ASSU has rebates.
What is the ASSU Fee?
The ASSU Fee collected every quarter is not used by the
ASSU. The ASSU is only responsible for the administration of
the annual student body election and the Fee Refund system.
The ASSU (really, the Student Activities) Fee is used to sup
port various student organizations whose budgets were ap
proved by you, the stadent body, during the Spring Quarter
Elections held every year.
Two especially noteworthy organizations funded by this fee
are the Program Board and Publication Board. The Program
Board funds those groups seeking less than $4,000 annually or
quarterly. Please see the list (right) of the types of programs and
publications that your fee supports.
Why is the ASSU Fee refunded?
The ASSU Fee Refunds give those students who strongly ob
ject to a particular group's programming the opportunity to
withdraw their financial support. While most students do not
participate in all of the organizations, most students choose to
financially support the activities and programs of various groups
in order to contribute to pluralism and diversity at Stanford.
When are fee refunds available?
Fee Refunds are available during the third and fourth week of
every academic quarter. Absolutely no requests for Fee Refunds
will be considered after this period.

which you will deny funding. The refund check and the original
