## Ted Bundy executed; blames pornography for actions 
### 
STARKE, Fla. (AP) — Ted Bundy, a
charming law school dropout who ended
years of denials that he was a killer with
emotional confessions to the gruesome
slayingß of 20 women in four states, was
electrocuted yesterday for murdering a
12-year-old girl.
Bundy's last words, before a black
hooded executioner pulled a switch at
7:06 a.m. sending 2,000 volts through
his body, were to his lawyer and a min
ister: "Give my love to my family and
friends."
More than 100 proponents of the death
penalty waiting in a field across from the
Florida State Prison cheered, lit sparklers
and set off firecrackers at the signal that
42-year-old Theodore Robert Bundy had
finally been put to death for a crime
committed almost 11 years ago. Three
earlier execution dates were stymied by
appeals.
"Burn, Bundy, burn!" some shouted.
A group of about a dozen people parodied
an old tune by singing "On top of old

Sparky" — a reference to the nickname
for Florida's oaken, three-legged electric
chair.
Only about two dozen people opposed
to the death penalty turned up to keep
a vigil in the field.
"The people of Florida today adminis
tered justice," Gov. Bob Martinez said
10 hours after the execution. "If there's

ever been anyone on
Florida's death row that
deserved the electric
chair, Ted Bundy was
that individual."
Bundy had been quick
witted, known for his
cockiness and arrogance,
a handsome, blue-eyed
charmer. He was the sub
ject of five books and a

television miniseries, "The Deliberate
Stranger."
But he recently claimed to "feel God's
presence," and was reported at the end
to be remorseful about his bloody trail

of kidnappings, sadistic sexual mutila
tions and slayings in his home state of
Washington, and in Utah, Colorado,
Idaho and Florida.
In an interview with religious broad
caster and psychologist James Dobson
hours before his execution, Bundy said
his home life had been normal, but early
experiences with pornography had "crys
tallized" violent tendencies within him.
Later, alcohol reduced his inhibitions and
he acted on those tendencies, he said.
"The most damaging kinds of pornog
raphy — and again here I'm talking from
personal experience, hard, real personal
experience — are those that involve vio
lence, and sexual violence," Bundy said.
He then issued a warning:
"There is loose in their towns, their
communities, people like me today, whose
dangerous impulses are being fueled day
in and day out by violence in the media
in its various forms, particularly sexual
violence," Bundy said.
In the last days of his life, Bundy slow

ly, deliberately described his crimes in
detail, said Russ Reneau, chief inves
tigator for Idaho Attorney General Jim
Jones. Reneau said Bundy told how he
made an overnight trip from Salt Lake
City to Pocatello, Idaho. "He said he was
here for a specific purpose, and that was
to commit a murder," he said.
But when asked why he killed, Reneau
said Bundy answered "only obliquely.
When we asked him why he made that
trip (to Pocatello) he said it was because
of 'the madness.' He did not elaborate
on that."
His execution, for the murder of sixth
grader Kimberly Diane Leach of Lake
City, made him the 20th man put to
death in Florida and the 106 th in the
United States since the U.S. Supreme
Court allowed states to reinstate the
death penalty in 1976.
Kimberly was kidnapped from the
grounds of her junior high school Feb.
9, 1978, just three weeks after the killings
of two women at Chi Omega sorority at

Florida State University. The child's body
was found three months later in an aban
doned pigsty. Bundy was also under a
death sentence for the two Chi Omega
murders.
Until near the end he had insisted he
was innocent, although he had been
suspected of as many as 36 killings and
disappearances. Then late last week he
began talking to investigators from the
four Western states, closing the books on
20 unsolved crimes.
According to The San Jose Mercury
News, police suspect that Bundy was in
volved in several unsolved cases in north
ern California and in the Palo Alto area,
where he attended Stanford University
for one quarter in the 19705. But there
were no reports that he had confessed
to any California killings.
Years ago, two Santa Clara County
sheriffs deputies interviewed Bundy
about three unsolved slayings in the Palo
Alto area but were unable to link him
definitively to the crimes.

to commit a murder," he said.
But when asked why he killed, Reneau
said Bundy answered "only obliquely.
When we asked him why he made that
trip (to Pocatello) he said it was because
of 'the madness.' He did not elaborate
on that."
His execution, for the murder of sixth
grader Kimberly Diane Leach of Lake
City, made him the 20th man put to
death in Florida and the 106 th in the
United States since the U.S. Supreme
Court allowed states to reinstate the
death penalty in 1976.
Kimberly was kidnapped from the
grounds of her junior high school Feb.
9, 1978, just three weeks after the killings
of two women at Chi Omega sorority at

Florida State University. The child's body
was found three months later in an aban
doned pigsty. Bundy was also under a
death sentence for the two Chi Omega
murders.
Until near the end he had insisted he
was innocent, although he had been
suspected of as many as 36 killings and
disappearances. Then late last week he
began talking to investigators from the
four Western states, closing the books on
20 unsolved crimes.
According to The San Jose Mercury
News, police suspect that Bundy was in
volved in several unsolved cases in north
ern California and in the Palo Alto area,
where he attended Stanford University
for one quarter in the 19705. But there
were no reports that he had confessed
to any California killings.
Years ago, two Santa Clara County
sheriffs deputies interviewed Bundy
about three unsolved slayings in the Palo
Alto area but were unable to link him
definitively to the crimes.

STARKE, Fla. (AP) — Ted Bundy, a
charming law school dropout who ended
years of denials that he was a killer with
emotional confessions to the gruesome
slayingß of 20 women in four states, was
electrocuted yesterday for murdering a
12-year-old girl.
Bundy's last words, before a black
hooded executioner pulled a switch at
7:06 a.m. sending 2,000 volts through
his body, were to his lawyer and a min
ister: "Give my love to my family and
friends."
More than 100 proponents of the death
penalty waiting in a field across from the
Florida State Prison cheered, lit sparklers
and set off firecrackers at the signal that
42-year-old Theodore Robert Bundy had
finally been put to death for a crime
committed almost 11 years ago. Three
earlier execution dates were stymied by
appeals.
"Burn, Bundy, burn!" some shouted.
A group of about a dozen people parodied
an old tune by singing "On top of old

Sparky" — a reference to the nickname
for Florida's oaken, three-legged electric
chair.
Only about two dozen people opposed
to the death penalty turned up to keep
a vigil in the field.
"The people of Florida today adminis
tered justice," Gov. Bob Martinez said
10 hours after the execution. "If there's

ever been anyone on
Florida's death row that
deserved the electric
chair, Ted Bundy was
that individual."
Bundy had been quick
witted, known for his
cockiness and arrogance,
a handsome, blue-eyed
charmer. He was the sub
ject of five books and a

television miniseries, "The Deliberate
Stranger."
But he recently claimed to "feel God's
presence," and was reported at the end
to be remorseful about his bloody trail

of kidnappings, sadistic sexual mutila
tions and slayings in his home state of
Washington, and in Utah, Colorado,
Idaho and Florida.
In an interview with religious broad
caster and psychologist James Dobson
hours before his execution, Bundy said
his home life had been normal, but early
experiences with pornography had "crys
tallized" violent tendencies within him.
Later, alcohol reduced his inhibitions and
he acted on those tendencies, he said.
"The most damaging kinds of pornog
raphy — and again here I'm talking from
personal experience, hard, real personal
experience — are those that involve vio
lence, and sexual violence," Bundy said.
He then issued a warning:
"There is loose in their towns, their
communities, people like me today, whose
dangerous impulses are being fueled day
in and day out by violence in the media
in its various forms, particularly sexual
violence," Bundy said.
In the last days of his life, Bundy slow

ly, deliberately described his crimes in
detail, said Russ Reneau, chief inves
tigator for Idaho Attorney General Jim
Jones. Reneau said Bundy told how he
made an overnight trip from Salt Lake
City to Pocatello, Idaho. "He said he was
here for a specific purpose, and that was
to commit a murder," he said.
But when asked why he killed, Reneau
said Bundy answered "only obliquely.
When we asked him why he made that
trip (to Pocatello) he said it was because
of 'the madness.' He did not elaborate
on that."
His execution, for the murder of sixth
grader Kimberly Diane Leach of Lake
