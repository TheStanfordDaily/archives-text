# No verdict in Steinberg case
## Judge denies mistrial motion by defense attorney 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) â€” Joel Steinberg's lawyer un
successfully sought a mistrial yesterday after jurors
asked if they could infer from testimony about
Steinberg beating his lover that he also beat the
child he is accused of killing.
The jury deliberated for six hours yesterday with
out reaching a verdict.
State Supreme Court Justice Harold Rothwax
had told the jurors during the trial and during his
instructions Monday that they could not draw such
an inference.
Yesterday he re-read his instruction that the
evidence that Steinberg beat Hedda Nussbaum was
allowed only to show her state of mind at the time
and to explain why she did not get help for 6-year-old
Lisa Steinberg.
Defense lawyer Ira London, who had objected to
the evidence as irrelevant and inflammatory, asked
for a mistrial, but was denied.
"I told you so," he said to reporters outside the
courtroom.
He said it was impossible to show jurors the
videotape of Ms. Nussbaum's injuries and her
graphic testimony about beatings by Steinberg with
out having the jury think the defendant had a
propensity for violence.
Later in the day, London said Steinberg was en
couraged by the jurors seeking clarification on
" -For ** to, during deliberations, he is
* feeling more optimistic," London said of Steinberg.
The jury also asked for and was shown three
pieces of videotape introduced during the trial.

The tapes showed Nussbaum when she was booked
on murder charges, a policewoman showing the
bruises on Nussbaum's body, and Steinberg's
knuckles, which a policeman testified were cut.
Later, the jury provided a hint about its delibera
tions when it asked Rothwax if it could consider
lesser homicide counts against Steinberg if it was
not unanimous on the top count, second-degree
murder.
Rothwax had made clear in his instructions that
the jury could consider manslaughter charges only
if it was unanimous in acquitting him of murder,
and he repeated that yesterday.
The jurors' request seemed to indicate division
on whether Steinberg is guilty of murder.
The jurors also asked to hear a definition of
circumstantial evidence; a re-reading of what is re
quired to find someone guilty of second-degree mur
der, first- and second-degree manslaughter and
criminally negligent homicide; and the meaning of
reasonable doubt.
Steinberg is charged in the death of Lisa, the girl
he obtained at birth from an unwed Long Island
teen-ager and raised but never legally adopted.
The child was removed comatose from Steinberg's
apartment on Nov. 2, 1987, and died of a brain
injury three days later.
Nussbaum, 46, a former children's book editor,
was the prosecution's star witness. She testified
that Steinberg told her in bed, after they free-based
cocaine and while Lisa lay comatose on their bath
room floor, that he had "knocked Lisa down and
she didn't want to get up."
