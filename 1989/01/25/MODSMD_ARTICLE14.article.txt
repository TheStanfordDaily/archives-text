# Argentine siege ends in surrender
## 
### 
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) —
Armed civilians surrendered to the army
yesterday after a one-day assault on an
infantry base in which at least 36 people
were killed and scores wounded, the
government said.
President Raul Alfonsin visited the
camp and said the commandos were
"ultra-leftists." He said fighting politi
cal subversion is "the last test of my
government," and he pledged to set up
a National Security Council.
"This is my fight and I'll fight it to
the finish so society is free of this ag
gression," a somber Alfonsin said in a
12-minute address broadcast nation
wide.
Alfonsin, who also has had to cope
with three insurrections by rightist
army officers in the past 21 months,
said the council would advise him on
anti-subversion strategy. He did not
elaborate.
Alfonsin said 28 commandos were
killed and 14 captured alive as govern
ment forces recaptured the 3rd Infantry
Regiment base in La Tablada on the
outskirts of Buenos Aires, which the
commandos attacked Monday morning.
Seven soldiers and one policeman
were killed, he said, and 63 other sol
diers and policemen were wounded.

Troopers yesterday tracked down
snipers and searched bunkers at the
camp. Captured weapons included so
phisticated machine guns from the So
viet Union and China, military officials
said.
Alfonsin toured the base in the af
ternoon, looking closely at the charred
bodies and buildings blasted by tanks
and mortars. Soldiers were still ex
changing gunfire with snipers in
mopping-up operations, but no fire was
aimed at Alfonsin or his helicopter.
"Anyone there participated in a shock
ing spectacle," he said. "It was a night
mare. Death. Once again, death.
Brutality. Barbarism."
As dusk approached, small fires still
smoldered in gutted brick buildings.
Half a dozen buildings were in ruins,
their windows blown out and tile roofs
collapsed or burned away.
Helicopter gunships clattered over the
base and a seedy sprawl of project
houses across the highway.
Military and government officials said
the attackers apparently intended to
steal weapons from the camp armory.
Journalists were allowed to tour the
scene at midafternoon under a hazy
summer sun that sent temperatures into
the 90s. Soldiers and police officers

rested in the shade of trees, drinking
water and eating oranges.
The reporters counted 15 bodies, five
blackened or mutilated by explosions or
fire. At least one was a soldier and two
were women.
Although officials said the attackers
were leftists, neither their identity nor
motive was clear. Army officers said
some were foreigners, the government
news agency Telam reported.
"Surely, the objective was to take
weapons and flee, but the rapid action
of the police and the armed forces made
flight something they could not
achieve," said Antonio Berhongaray,
chairman of the Senate Defense Com
mittee and member of Alfonsin's Radi
cal Civic Union party.
Cesar Jaroslavsky, Radical Civic Un
ion leader in the House of Deputies,
said at least some in the raiders
belonged to the People's Revolutionary
Army, a leftist guerrilla group active in
the 19705.
Confiscated pamphlets indicated the
attackers called themselves the
"Popular Resistance Front," said Jose
Ignacio Lopez, presidential press secre
tary. He said other pamphlets indicated
the group felt a military coup was im
minent and wanted to prevent it.
