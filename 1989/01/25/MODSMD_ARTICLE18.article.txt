## World of difference 
### 
This year's conference
on the environment gets
participants involved

THE "You Can Make a Dif
ference" conference is a
people motivator.
As opposed to other conferences
which merely inform, the "You
Can Make a Difference Confer
ence" is geared towards rousing
individuals to action. The confer
ence, which is focusing on environ
mental issues, first informs
participants about the issues and
then instruct them on how they
can become involved.
With programs specifically
focusing on Stanford and what stu
dents here can do differently, the
conference, which culminates this
weekend, should not just entice en
vironmentalists.
For instance, a tour of Stanford's
Cogeneration Plant (the place
where you always see the steam
coming from at night) will surely
explain a mysterious part of
campus for many of us.
Of interest on Sunday is a series
of environmental tours of the Bay
Area. They should not only be in
formational, but just plain enjoy
able. And it's not just the
nature-lovers among us who could
appreciate such aesthetically pleas
ing areas as the Foothills, Jasper
Ridge (where Stanford's Biological

Preserve is located) and Big Basin.
One conference tour group will also
head out to San Gregorio to view
a sustainable agriculture farm
which is experimenting in tech
niques such as farming without the
use of pesticides.
According to junior Smita Singh,
co-organizer of the conference,
Sunday is really "You Can Make
A Difference Day." Through a se
ries of workshops, participants will
learn how they themselves can
make a difference in issues of en
vironmental conservation.
Some workshops to take note of
are: environmental journalism, en
trepreneurship in environmental
technologies and the citizens' role
in passing laws to protect Califor
nia's environment.
Before all the action of tours
and workshops, Saturday is desig
nated a learning day, in which con
ference participants can attend a
series of both global and regional
"case sessions."
The idea behind the case ses
sions is that the "players on the
issue" are invited to form a panel
which creates a dialogue. As op
posed to typical conferences in
which the audience is subjected to
a lecture on a given subject, these
"case sessions" should pull the au
dience in.
You may have heard of the con
ference because of big-name par
ticipants such as Ted Koppel, but
clearly, the conference's varied
tours and discussions should
motivate many to attend.
