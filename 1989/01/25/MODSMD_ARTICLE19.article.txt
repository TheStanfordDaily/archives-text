## Fliers constitute harassment, not 'protected speech' 
### 
Why is that such a big deal?"
This question has surfaced
frequently (and simmered
subliminally) during the campus debate
going on since October about the
resentment and emotional outburst of
black students at Lagunita.
Posters that they, justifiably, felt
were racist had appeared twice
Ujamaa. Two students have admitted
culpability in one case and blamed
their action on imbibing too much
alcohol; the Office of Residential Edu
cation has banned them from Stanford
housing for two quarters.
The question of why it was such a
"big deal" will probably come up out of
the subconscious even more frequently
now that it has been given official
voice by University President Donald
Kennedy in his "thoughtful paper,"
"Reflections on Racial Understanding."

"I was surprised," he wrote, "at how
many members of the community were
prepared to urge the swift and arbi
trary application of sanctions in the
Ujamaa case. Even now there has been
too little attention to the value of free
expression."
I am surprised that the president
considers this a free speech issue!
Empathy as well as thought is needed
for understanding this case.
These actions constituted harassment
not "protected speech." Scrawling
"niggers" over an announcement of a
dance was a hostile, aggressive act
expressing hatred and contempt. With
reports in the press of skin-head and
Klan activity in Northern California
and violence against black students on
a number of campuses in the Middle
West and the East, it would be unrea
sonable to expect the black students or

any Afro-Americans on the campus to
remain calm.
Converting a picture of Beethoven
into a minstrel-show type of black
person was an offensive, juvenile act
writing finis to an argument about
whether or not the great composer had
some African genes. Students don't
expect to find caricatures of the black
body stuck on their doors in a home
away from home.
Both acts were anxiety-producing
among those who have expected better
from an academic community. They
constituted a "big deal". Hence the
emotional group response.
Was the punishment "an arbitrary
application of sanctions?" As a 77-year
old black male who has had to deal
with harassment of this type, off and
on, for most of my life, I would an
swer "No."

But I would add an educational
component. Ignorance as well as in
ebriation was involved. Since the claim
about Beethoven must have struck
them as preposterous they should be
asked to participate in a group
"therapy" session where the black
students who hold this view should
present whatever evidence they have.
The well documented cases of Alex
ander Pushkin, Alexander Dumas,
father and son, and Alessandro, first
Duke of Florence, should be discussed
as evidence that the Beethoven claim is
not preposterous even if it can't be
validated. This claim should be dealt
with through rational discourse added
to temporary deprivation of privileges.
