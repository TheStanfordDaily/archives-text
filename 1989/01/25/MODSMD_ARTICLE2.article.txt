# IFC proposes own judiciary
## Fraternity council votes tonight on review board proposal 
### Janine De Fao Staff writer 
With the suspension of Sigma
Chi Fraternity's social privileges
hanging in the balance, the Inter
fraternity Council will decide
tonight whether it should make
its own decisions on disciplinary
problems within the fraternity
system, according to Chris Erlin,
IFC president.
The IFC will vote on a revised
version of its 18-year-old consti
tution, which includes a proposal
for the creation of a judicial board.
The board would be a subcom
mittee of the IFC, imposing
penalties in disciplinary cases
within the fraternity system.
The board's first case would be
the possible suspension of Sigma
Chi for a flier it circulated for a
party last Thursday depicting four
kinds of alcoholic iced teas and

mentioning beer. The flier placed
too much emphasis on alcohol, ac
cording to Fraternal Affairs Ad
viser Joe Pisano.
Pisano met with Sigma Chi
President Marty Hartigan yester
day to discuss a possible suspen
sion of the fraternity.
Pisano said he would allow the
IFC judicial board to judge the
case if the new constitution is
ratified. But if the constitutional
revision does not pass, or if the
proposed IFC judicial board does
not convene quickly, Pisano said
he will suspend Sigma Chi's social
privileges for three weeks,
retroactive to last Friday, the day
after their beach party.
Pisano said he supports the pro
posed judicial board and is confi
dent that the board would act with
integrity.
The IFC "is very able to [govern
themselves) because they [are] a

responsible, credible group," he
said.
He and the board would work
independently but would discuss
proposed penalties together,
Pisano said.
But he added that he would
impose his own punishments if he
ever feels a penalty handed down
by the board is too lenient and if
he is unable to convince the board
to impose a harsher penalty.
Likewise, if the subcommittee
were to decide on a penalty that
he believes is too stringent, he
would ask the board to reconsider,
Pisano said.
The internal judicial system
would make the Greek system
stronger, said Erlin. "This will
provide a chance for fraternities
to learn from their mistakes in
stead of just being told that they
are wrong. We are looking to
replace the bad aspects with good
aspects through education."
He added that although the
University may have good inten
tions, they do not have the same
perspective on problems because
they are working outside the fra
ternity system.
According to Erlin, the judicial
board would consist of five mem
bers of the IFC and an alternate.
The positions would be open to
any fraternity member in good
standing in the Greek community.
Only one representative from each

fraternity would be allowed on the
board.
Issues would be brought to the
executive cabinet of the IFC by
the IFC community, University
officials or the Stanford commu
nity. The cabinet — consisting of
the president, vice-president, sec
retary, public relations represen
tative and community service rep
resentative — would decide
whether the judicial board should
convene to discuss particular
cases.
After talking to people involved
in an issue, the board would make
a decision and then monitor the
outcome, Erlin said.
According to Erlin, the IFC has
been considering the creation of

an interna] judicial body for some
time. From the fall of 1986 until
mid-1988, decisions concerning
behavioral problems were made
by the All-Greek Council, an or
ganization consisting of members
of the IFC, the Inter-Sorority
Council and the Black Greek Let
ter Council.
Last year the council did not
rule on any cases and decided to
disband in the middle of the year,
according to Pisano.
Before the council was set up K
the IFC handled all problems on
their own. Pisano said, however,
that much of the Stanford com
munity thought the IFC was too
lenient, prompting the creation of
his position as fraternal affairs
adviser in the winter of 1985.

Council and the Black Greek Let

lenient, prompting the creation of
his position as fraternal affairs
