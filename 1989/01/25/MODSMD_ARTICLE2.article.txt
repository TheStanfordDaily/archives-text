# IFC proposes own judiciary
## Fraternity council votes tonight on review board proposal 
### Janine De Fao Staff writer 
With the suspension of Sigma
Chi Fraternity's social privileges
hanging in the balance, the Inter
fraternity Council will decide
tonight whether it should make
its own decisions on disciplinary
problems within the fraternity
system, according to Chris Erlin,
IFC president.
The IFC will vote on a revised
version of its 18-year-old consti
tution, which includes a proposal
for the creation of a judicial board.
The board would be a subcom
mittee of the IFC, imposing
penalties in disciplinary cases
within the fraternity system.
The board's first case would be
the possible suspension of Sigma
Chi for a flier it circulated for a
party last Thursday depicting four
kinds of alcoholic iced teas and

mentioning beer. The flier placed
too much emphasis on alcohol, ac
cording to Fraternal Affairs Ad
viser Joe Pisano.
Pisano met with Sigma Chi
President Marty Hartigan yester
day to discuss a possible suspen
sion of the fraternity.
Pisano said he would allow the
IFC judicial board to judge the
case if the new constitution is
ratified. But if the constitutional
revision does not pass, or if the
proposed IFC judicial board does
not convene quickly, Pisano said
he will suspend Sigma Chi's social
privileges for three weeks,
retroactive to last Friday, the day
after their beach party.
Pisano said he supports the pro
posed judicial board and is confi
dent that the board would act with
integrity.
The IFC "is very able to [govern
themselves) because they [are] a

responsible, credible group," he
said.
He and the board would work
independently but would discuss
proposed penalties together,
Pisano said.
But he added that he would
impose his own punishments if he
ever feels a penalty handed down
by the board is too lenient and if
he is unable to convince the board
to impose a harsher penalty.
Likewise, if the subcommittee
were to decide on a penalty that
he believes is too stringent, he
would ask the board to reconsider,
Pisano said.
The internal judicial system
would make the Greek system
stronger, said Erlin. "This will
provide a chance for fraternities
to learn from their mistakes in
stead of just being told that they
