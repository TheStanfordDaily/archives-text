# Race is source of identity, not tension
## 
### 
We would like to respond to Telford
Work's letter on racial polarization
which appeared in the Jan. 13 Daily,
but also to much of the dialogue going
on campus right now around the role
of the students of color organizations.
Work argues that student of color ac
tivism intensifies racial tension on
campus. "Racial power politics are
damaging our college communities," he
writes. In the "real world," he tells us,
there is far less racial tension than at
Stanford.
In light of the facts of current
events, from the recent violent incidents
in the streets of Miami to the increase
in organizing of neo-Nazi "skinheads"
among local high school youth, it is
clear that our society does not fit the

racially harmonious description Work
supplies. It is this continued racism
which creates racial tensions in our
society and, because Stanford does not
exist in a vacuum, on our campus.
Work's specific point that the Stan
ford community is somehow exacerbat
ing racial tension by acknowledging its
existence is one on which we would
like to comment.
Many people ask earnestly, "why
can't we see each other as human indi
viduals rather than immediately identi
fying each other as members of a cer
tain ethnic group?"
Some people feel that the existence
of the student of color groups only
serves to intensify the division between
the races by focusing on what is differ
ent between us and not on what we
share. However, when someone like
Work asserts that to recognize differ
ences is to create racial tension, he
denies the fact that, in our society,

part of an individual's identity is his or
her race.
To respect an individual therefore we
must respect, not deny, his or her
unique experience as a member of an
ethnic or racial group. African Ameri
cans, Chicanos, Asian/Pacific Islanders,
and American Indians have very dis
tinct histories and cultures that have
shaped unique experiences. There is
certainly diversity within each group as
well, but to deny the commonalities of
cultural traditions, and racial oppres
sion, is to deny fundamental aspects of
each individual's experience.
Differences may make us uncomfort
able at first, but why? Work writes
that minority students are "under
standably uncomfortable with the idea
of having to assimilate," when they
first come to Stanford.
On this we agree. Students of color
are as uncomfortable with this idea as
white students would be if they were

told to give up their different families,
religions, foods, music or ways of so
cializing.
Racism is not the acknowledgement
of the obvious fact of differences, but
rather the assumption that if a culture
is dominant, it must be superior, and
that others should therefore conform
to it.
No one is saying that race or "dif
ferentness" should be the defining
characteristics for anyone. We can be a
family, but we must be a family that
not only recognizes, but is proud of
the diversity of our members. We are
all different, but what we have in com
mon is the vision of a university and a
society that is open to and appreciative
of diversity.
