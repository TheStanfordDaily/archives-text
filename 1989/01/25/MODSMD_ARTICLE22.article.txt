## Take a couple steps back 
### 
IF YOU'VE EVER entered an antique
shop (or some other store selling in
variably useless goods) either because
you were intrigued by the display in the
front window or because you were simply
bored, but not because you had any
buying intentions, then you've probably
noticed that after a short while all the
good senses that you had brought in with
you have been dulled.
The little earthenware frogs playing
pan flutes while sitting happily on their
own lily pads begin to make sense. The
cherubs engraved on the handles of other
wise sharp-looking letter openers begin
to have a psychopathic appeal; you
wonder how they would feel rubbing your
hands across them.
Your senses now perverted, you are
even tempted to purchase the small
bronze bust of Gustave Flaubert because,
you think, it would add some definition
and interest to your bookshelf.
If you do buy it and bring it home and
put it on your shelf, it looks grotesque;
you wonder why you bought it. Yet
despite your distaste, the bust still holds
some horrible dictatorial power over you
(possibly because you've paid good money
for it?), and it is a tremendous effort to
chuck it in the rubbish — where it
belongs.
This problem is largely one of perspec
tive. Perspective becomes skewed when
in such a close and singular situation.
Silly things make sense and seem valid
when viewed with a distorted vision that
has been brought about through sensual
overload. Only when stepping back a dis
tance is sense rejuvenated, perspective

restored, and judgment brought back to
the world of common sense. But even
then vestigial feelings remain.
The mountain from the valley below,
and all that.
The analogy is this: Stanford is a curio
shoppe. Students enter with the idea that
their values and ideals will go through
some maturation process, but they don't
know exactly what kind. They're possibly
a little interested in a true liberal edu
cation and possibly just bored and going
through the motions for lack of another
more enticing thrill.
In any case, the values of the Univer
sity sit there for them to inspect and
fondle. They hold an unsuspected charm;
they begin to make sense in themselves
and among their counterparts. They over
power the poor student who can do noth
ing but purchase them. A certain idealism
is thus brought about.
Of course everything falls out of place
when the student leaves the University.
The goods seem sorely misplaced in a
new home. Surely it comes as no surprise
that a fairly large number of college
liberals grow up to become middle-aged
conservatives. A lot goes into the trash.
The idea is to avoid this shock by ac
quiring the proper perspective while still
in college — not being lured by the
curiosities. Stopping out and going over
seas, just getting away for awhile, step
ping back from your proximity in order
to better see your life as it is and where
its leading, these can ease the transition.
Among other reasons, this is why stu
dents choose to get away. Unfortunately,
the options for going abroad on this

campus are not as helpful in this aspect
as they should be.
Many of the Stanford in Europe pro
grams don't really offer much but a satel
lite Stanford campus. A group of students
go over and basically become tourists for
a few months, living together in as an
Americanized situation as possible. Need
less to say, this atmosphere is hardly
conducive to any real self-searching and
perspective adjustment simply because
the environment has only gone through
a superficial change.
It is a shame that there aren't more
programs where the student can literally
be immersed in another culture, either
by living as a native student lives (among
native students) or by living with a family
or by living by oneself. Even if that other
culture is the United States, it is not the
spectacle or history that matters as much
as the independence and distance from
Stanford.
Maybe after returning, the student will
be better able to judge what exactly an
education should provide — not neces
sarily the answers to questions, but the
ability to pose the right questions — and
be less susceptible to the college system
of mind-fixing. And in this way take the
fullest advantage of the university exper
ience.

The idea is to avoid this shock by ac
quiring the proper perspective while still
in college — not being lured by the
curiosities. Stopping out and going over
seas, just getting away for awhile, step
ping back from your proximity in order
to better see your life as it is and where
its leading, these can ease the transition.
Among other reasons, this is why stu
dents choose to get away. Unfortunately,
the options for going abroad on this

campus are not as helpful in this aspect
as they should be.
Many of the Stanford in Europe pro
grams don't really offer much but a satel
lite Stanford campus. A group of students
go over and basically become tourists for
a few months, living together in as an
Americanized situation as possible. Need
less to say, this atmosphere is hardly
conducive to any real self-searching and
perspective adjustment simply because
the environment has only gone through
a superficial change.
It is a shame that there aren't more
programs where the student can literally
be immersed in another culture, either
by living as a native student lives (among
native students) or by living with a family
or by living by oneself. Even if that other
culture is the United States, it is not the
spectacle or history that matters as much
as the independence and distance from
Stanford.
Maybe after returning, the student will
be better able to judge what exactly an
education should provide — not neces
sarily the answers to questions, but the
ability to pose the right questions — and
be less susceptible to the college system
of mind-fixing. And in this way take the
fullest advantage of the university exper
ience.
