## Making love on television dating premiers at Stanford 
### Dan Mendelsohn 
Mark Twain once said, "Everybody talks about
the weather but nobody does anything about it."
Many say at Stanford everybody talks about
dating but nobody does anything about it. One
of the most common sources for jokes and
lamentations here is the deplorable state of the
dating situation.
But no more. Senior Sharon Wachs did some
thing about it. And now, dating has become a
game at Stanford, linking love to life here.
Stanford's "Love Links" — a new version of
"The Dating Game" - will premiere on XTV
(Channel 10) on Jan. 30.
Wachs, the senior producer of "Love Links,"
calls it "our attempt to solve the dating problem
at Stanford." The idea came about in the spring
of 1988 when Wachs decided to get involved with
XTV. She worked with a project to produce a
student game show, and decided on the "Dating
Game" format because of the jokes about the
dating situation at Stanford. A pilot episode aired
last spring, and it spawned the idea for making
"Love Links" into a regular series this year.
The show, which will be aired Monday and
Thursday nights at 6:30, follows the same format
as "The Dating Game" — the popular game show
that was recently resurrected on national TV.
Hosted by senior Elaine Paul and freshman Kevin
Warsch, the half-hour show is divided into two
segments.
During the first half of the show, three male
students ("bachelors") are asked zany questions
by a female "bachelorette," who can hear but
not see the bachelors. Based upon their responses,
the bachelorette decides which of the three men
she would most like to go on a date. After she
makes her selection, she and her date-to-be are
given a gift certificate to a local restaurant at
which they may conduct their liason.
In the second half of the show, the genders
are switched and a single bachelor queries three
bachelorettes.
Three episodes of "Love Links" have already
been filmed with contestants recruited early in
the year.
The contestants bring their own set of ques
tions to ask the bachelors and bachelorettes.
Freshman Ingrid Happoldt came prepared with
wacky questions for her prospective date. Among
her queries were: "If you could meet the Pope,
Michael Jordan, or Bob Dylan, who would you
choose and why?" and "You come to the door to
pick me up, and see that although I am impeccably
dressed and strikingly beautiful, my zipper is
down. Do you: A) Tell me, B) Zip it up for me,
or C) Unzip yours to make me feel more at ease?"
Despite being armed with such loaded ques
tions, the results weren't quite what she expected.
"I chose Bachelor No. 2 because I was impressed
by how uninhibited he sounded. He was inhaling
a bottle of vodka the whole time, which may
have had something to do with it. I met him
later in a sober state and it turns out he's a
nice guy."
Freshman Ari Gold was not so fortunate.
Turned down by a choosy bachelorette, Gold was
a tad bitter — he blames a scarcity of questions
and difficult ones like "How do you feel about
euthanasia?" for his loss. "They (contestant re
cruiters) came to the dorm meeting and I thought,
'Why not do it?' because I'm so friggin' witty. I
didn't really get a chance to have fun on the air
. . . that's why I felt a little gypped."
Future plans for "Love Links" include a live

taping in White Plaza in the spring. In addition,
the idea of bringing back couples to discuss their
dates (as in "Love Connection") has been pro
posed. For the time being, students can tune in
Channel 10 on dorm TV's or go to the Coffee
House on Monday nights and view fellow students
looking for love.
Wachs says that XTV is still seeking contestants
for the 13-15 shows to be filmed before the end
of the year. Anyone wishing to interview or watch
a live taping of the show is encouraged to call
324-8563 for information.
