# Back to summer camp
## Sweating it out in Sierra sun 
### Becca Kovacik N. Rod Druid 
If you were stranded on a desert
island, what three items would
you want with you and why?
If you had to send a represen
tative from the United States to
another planet, who would you
send and why?
If you found out your accept
ance to Stanford was a mistake,
how would you present your case
so you could still enroll?
And why does any of this per
tain to spending a summer in the
Sierras?
It all makes sense when you
realize that creative answers —
and not just waterskiing expertise
— could help you land a job
amidst the emeralds and blues of
the Sierras near Lake Tahoe.
At least this is the case for Stan
ford students applying to work at
the Stanford Sierra Camp. The
application questions test im
agination, flexibility and character
— for good reason.
Spending 11 weeks only a few
steps away from the hiking of
Desolation Wilderness and the
waterskiing on Fallen Leaf Lake
with 50 other Stanford students
takes a lot of energy and imagina
tion.
But it's also boundless fun, ac
cording to veteran Sierra Camp
workers who often wax nostalgic
about the good times they've had.
It sounds like a fantasy to many
who are still pondering their sum
mer plans, an impossible dream
for those who have already com
mitted themselves to office jobs
in the city.
The Sierra Camp, owned and
operated by the Stanford Alumni
Association, is a family camp open
to Stanford alumni, faculty and
members of the Alumni Associa
tion. Each year about 50 Stanford
students work at Sierra Camp in
various positions, from running
the children's groups or working
in the kitchen to leading activities
like hiking, waterskiing, sailing
and tennis.
This year's staff director, senior
Sarah Stenn, is currently in the
process of trying to hire a staff
for the summer of 1989. After
spending three summers at Sierra
Camp, Stenn says she realizes

that "every summer up at camp
is unique and different because
the experience is so dependent on
what each staff decides to do with
all of the opportunities camp of
fers. The camp experience is
definitely what you make it . . .
each person is able to create his
or her own summer."
Stenn stresses that while Sierra
Camp staffers are expected to
work hard, their work is often
tempered by the opportunities for
making contacts and friends. Ac
cording to D.J. Dull who spent
last summer at camp, "There's
no doubt about the fact that you
do put in a lot of hours of work,
but a good deal of the work is
fun — you're meeting Stanford
alums and working with Stanford
students in a non-academic envi
ronment."
One of the challenges facing
Stenn and her four-member in
terviewing committee this quarter
is students' preconceptions of
Sierra Camp and of the hiring

process. Stenn points out that "in
hiring a staff, we are not looking
for one type of person but rather
a diverse group of individuals with
different personalities and inter
ests. Most of all, we'd like to have
a staff up at camp next summer
that is representative of what
Stanford is like now."
Stiff competition for the job
seems to be another popular mis
conception, according to camp vet
eran and senior Marlen McKinney.
"People think that there are too
many others applying and that
they don't have time to do the
application." Her advice is to ap
ply and have a good time while
doing it. "During the process you
wonder whether all the time and
effort is worth it, but once you're
up at camp there's no doubt that
it was."
Senior Chris Cunningham of
fers a few words of encouragement
as well to the application-wary:
"Where else can you spend a sum
mer working and playing hard
while getting paid — this is the
closest thing to paradise that I've
ever gotten paid to do!"
For those interested in applying,
applications are available at Bow
man Alumni House (directly be
hind Tresidder, open from 8:30
a.m.-5:00 p.m., Monday-Friday)
and must be returned by Friday,
Jan. 27. The Sierra Camp will
also have two informational meet
ings on Jan. 18 (Tresidder Oak
East, 7:30 p.m.) and on Jan. 23
(Tresidder Cypress North, 7:30
p.m.).

you want with you and why?
If you had to send a represen
tative from the United States to
another planet, who would you
send and why?
If you found out your accept
ance to Stanford was a mistake,
how would you present your case
so you could still enroll?
And why does any of this per
tain to spending a summer in the
Sierras?
It all makes sense when you
realize that creative answers —
and not just waterskiing expertise
— could help you land a job
amidst the emeralds and blues of
the Sierras near Lake Tahoe.
At least this is the case for Stan
ford students applying to work at
the Stanford Sierra Camp. The
application questions test im
agination, flexibility and character
— for good reason.
Spending 11 weeks only a few
steps away from the hiking of
Desolation Wilderness and the
waterskiing on Fallen Leaf Lake
with 50 other Stanford students
takes a lot of energy and imagina
tion.
But it's also boundless fun, ac
cording to veteran Sierra Camp
workers who often wax nostalgic
about the good times they've had.
It sounds like a fantasy to many
who are still pondering their sum
mer plans, an impossible dream
for those who have already com
mitted themselves to office jobs
in the city.
The Sierra Camp, owned and
operated by the Stanford Alumni
Association, is a family camp open
to Stanford alumni, faculty and
members of the Alumni Associa
tion. Each year about 50 Stanford
students work at Sierra Camp in
various positions, from running
the children's groups or working
in the kitchen to leading activities
like hiking, waterskiing, sailing
and tennis.
This year's staff director, senior
Sarah Stenn, is currently in the
process of trying to hire a staff
for the summer of 1989. After
spending three summers at Sierra
Camp, Stenn says she realizes

that "every summer up at camp
is unique and different because
the experience is so dependent on
what each staff decides to do with
all of the opportunities camp of
fers. The camp experience is
definitely what you make it . . .
each person is able to create his
or her own summer."
Stenn stresses that while Sierra
Camp staffers are expected to
work hard, their work is often
tempered by the opportunities for
making contacts and friends. Ac
cording to D.J. Dull who spent
last summer at camp, "There's
no doubt about the fact that you
do put in a lot of hours of work,
but a good deal of the work is
fun — you're meeting Stanford
alums and working with Stanford
students in a non-academic envi
ronment."
One of the challenges facing
Stenn and her four-member in
terviewing committee this quarter
is students' preconceptions of
Sierra Camp and of the hiring

process. Stenn points out that "in
hiring a staff, we are not looking
for one type of person but rather
a diverse group of individuals with
different personalities and inter
ests. Most of all, we'd like to have
a staff up at camp next summer
that is representative of what
Stanford is like now."
Stiff competition for the job
seems to be another popular mis
conception, according to camp vet
eran and senior Marlen McKinney.
"People think that there are too
many others applying and that
they don't have time to do the
application." Her advice is to ap
ply and have a good time while
doing it. "During the process you
wonder whether all the time and
effort is worth it, but once you're
up at camp there's no doubt that
it was."
Senior Chris Cunningham of
fers a few words of encouragement
as well to the application-wary:
"Where else can you spend a sum
mer working and playing hard
while getting paid — this is the
closest thing to paradise that I've
ever gotten paid to do!"
For those interested in applying,
applications are available at Bow
man Alumni House (directly be
hind Tresidder, open from 8:30
a.m.-5:00 p.m., Monday-Friday)
and must be returned by Friday,
Jan. 27. The Sierra Camp will
also have two informational meet
ings on Jan. 18 (Tresidder Oak
East, 7:30 p.m.) and on Jan. 23
(Tresidder Cypress North, 7:30
p.m.).
