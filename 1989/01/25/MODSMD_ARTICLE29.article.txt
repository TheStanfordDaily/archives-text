# Israeli consul general calls state survival a 'moral goal'
## 
### Susan McKean Editorial staff 
Last week, an ancient debate made a
Stanford appearance, and Middle Eastern
culture replaced Western culture as the
point of contention.
Recently world attention has been
riveted to developments in Israel and the
occupied territories by daily news reports
of unrest, shootings and semantic gym
nastics.
Even Stanford feels the international
grip of incidents in the modern Middle
East. The newly-appointed Pacific North
west Region Consul General of Israel
Harry Kney-Tal visited campus Friday
to speak with students and faculty.
The Daily spoke with Kney-Tal and
posed several of the hotly debated ques
tions already circulating within newspa
per pages and minds worldwide — from
domestic to foreign policy, from reconcil
iation to rejection.
Despite the precipitous pace of recent
events, Kney-Tal finds little solace in
speed of negotiation, little utility in hasty
remedies to age-old rifts.
He posits solution in small steps and
emphasizes the shortsightedness of
seeing the Palestinian conflict as Israel's
only peril.
Calling the status quo in Israel "un
tenable, Kney-Tal said diplomatic initia
tives must be employed to reverse the
cycle of violence. But the initiatives
toward peace must run a very conserva
tive course, unlike the short-cut paths
the rest of the world often chooses, he
said.
At this stage, negotiating toward the
creation of an independent Palestinian
state is premature in light of the "strong
mutual distrust" now prevailing in
Palestinian Israeli relations, according to
Kney-Tal. "It creates a quick fix, but in
the long run [an early discussion of a
Palestinian state] is a prescription for
further destabilization."
Interim agreements are the only way
an effective mutual trust can be built,

he argued, and warned of the long-term
danger in setting expectations based on
hope rather than record.
Kney-Tal advocates conducting suffi
ciently "vague and ambiguous" diplomacy
away from public view in order to rec
oncile Israel's security needs with the
Palestinians' rights.
But unlike the negotiation, the solu
tions must fall within a definite
framework constructed of both interna
tional peace and national strength. He
criticizes as "naive" the perspective that
peace in Israel will ensure the state's
security.
Echoing an argument characteristic of
the Reagan era, Kney-Tal said negotia
tions solve problems only when states
are "strong enough to achieve peace."
But recently, Israel's efforts to exert
strength have given pause to both critics
and supporters of the Jewish state.
Grumbles about Israel's failure as a
crucible for both Jewish and democratic
ideals have grown louder in the past year;
schisms between ideological camps, evi
denced by the Israeli national elections
this fall, have grown exaggerated.
Kney-Tal hears the murmurs of dis
content, but instead of voicing apology in
response, sees the active public debate
amidst violent unrest as a credit to Israeli
democracy. He said the Palestinian issue
is a "constant dilemma and agony" for
Israeli society and asserted that "no other
state" so extensively opens itself up for
scrutiny.
And he explained in clear terms the
driving philosophy behind Israel's behav
ior in the West Bank and Gaza Strip that
he admits is "not projecting very nicely."
"From Israel's perspective, state sur
vival is a moral goal. The ultimate moral
stand is to make sure the Israeli state
will survive and prosper despite rejection
by the Arab world," Kney-Tal said.
It is this tenacious commitment to
maintaining the Jewish character of the
state that dictated the decision in the
1970s to negotiate more autonomy for
the Palestinians rather than annex the

West Bank and Gaza Strip, he said.
Now, with the increased unrest in the
territories, the need for negotiation grows
more urgent, and Kney-Tal said an ac
counting of "the tactical means for state
security" balanced with Palestinian
rights is currently underway.
Kney-Tal also proposed a course of ac
tion for granting more autonomy to the
Palestinians similar to that voiced by the
Israeli minister of defense last weekend.
With the goal of instilling a "new

realism" among Palestinians, increased
autonomy would grant Palestinians more
responsibility for their daily lives, "dram
atically" decrease the Israeli military
presence, establish an electoral process
to create "elected rather than armed lead
ership" and turn over the budget process
for the occupied territories to the Pales
tinian leaders, Kney-Tal said.
He envisions more independent ter
ritories as a "huge laboratory for testing
how the two peoples will coexist."
Nonetheless, Kney-Tal admitted that
the Palestinians have rejected this idea.
"They are rejecting autonomy because
they are not reconciled to the idea of
living in peaceful coexistence with the
Jewish state.
"It is indicative of the intransigeant
unwillingness (of Palestinians) to give up
their hopes to get rid of the Jewish state,"
Kney-Tal said.
This is where the United States comes
in, according to Kney-Tal, who used to
be the Israeli counselor for congressional
affairs in Washington, D.C.
He said he expects both superpowers
to play a "major role" in facilitating the
peace process, but particularly empha
sized that Israel depends on the leader
ship of the United States in its traditional
role as an "honest broker" in the Middle
East.
"The United States is the most devoted
and reliable ally of Israel and will play
a chief role in the rapprochement between
Israel and Arabs . .. Israel has every
reason to believe the United States will
keep Israel's vital interests in mind,"
Kney-Tal said.
He said recent changes in the Soviet
Union show "encouraging signs" of their
progress toward greater credibility as
peace negotiators for Israel. But he voiced
hesitancy, calling Gorbachev's more
liberal policies for Jewish emigration and
his overtures aimed at normalizing
Soviet-Israeli relations "too modest."
"[The reforms] are not irreversible. I
need more," Kney-Tal said.
In the context of recent U.S. talks with

the Palestine Liberation Organization
and the apparent willingness of the PLO
to work for an equitable peace with Israel,
Kney-Tal reasserted the official Israeli
line of thought. "Israel views the PLO
as self-imposed leadership. If the Pales
tinians had a real chance to choose their
leaders, without intimidation, the PLO
would not be their sole leaders."
In response to allegations last week
that Yasser Arafat, head of the PLO,
threatened the Palestinian mayor of
Bethlehem for suggesting to impose a
moratorium on the violent uprisings in
that area, Kney-Tal called the scenario
typical and labeled it as "Arafat's old
story of physical intimidation."
Yet despite his calls for incremental
movement toward resolution, Kney-Tal
suggested that an autonomous Palestin
ian entity, or a unified Palestinian-
Jordanian state, would ultimately be in
the best interests of both the Arab world
and the United States. "It would preserve
the stability of two of America's allies —
Israel and Jordan," he said.
Stability is something Israel works
hard to preserve, and Kney-Tal indicated
that the newly elected coalition govern
ment will improve that stability.
In contrast to a "somewhat confused"
policy that existed under the former ad
ministration, Kney-Tal believes that Is
rael's foreign policy will have a new unity
and will "speak with one voice" under
the realigned government. Previously, the
Israeli prime minister and the minister
of foreign affairs represented two differ
ent parties.
Kney-Tal also emphasized the impor
tance of remembering the delicate posi
tion in which Israel finds itself and the
risk of distilling all its problems down to
the Palestinian conflict.
"In the long run, the bigger Israeli-
Arab conflict is how Israel copes with
the dangerous proliferation of chemical
and biological weapons, how to maintain
a military balance and how to deter an
Arab war coalition. We must be very
serious about security."


The ultimate moral stand
is to make sure the Israeli
state will survive and pros
per despite rejection by
the Arab world.'
