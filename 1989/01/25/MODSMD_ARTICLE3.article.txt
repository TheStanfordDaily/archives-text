# Rice will be NSC specialist
## 
### Lori Silver Senior staff writer 
Assoc. Prof. Condoleezza Rice
will take an immediate leave of
absence from Stanford's Political
Science Department to join the
Bush administration as the Na
tional Security Council's Soviet
and East European specialist.
In an interview with The Daily,
Rice confirmed that Bush's tran
sition team unofficially ap
proached her two weeks ago about
possible positions at the NSC or
at the State Department as deputy
director of policy planning. She
officially accepted the NSC posi
tion Monday and begins Feb. 1.
Friday is her last day at Stanford.
After working with Bush's tran
sition team "to come to terms
with what is best for both par
ties," she said she accepted the
NSC position because of its small,
intimate structure, as opposed to
the State Department's large bu
reaucracy.

"I liked the size
of the NSC more
than anything —
it's a small staff.
The NSC has an
intimate feel
about it," she
said.
A well-recog
nized expert in
Soviet and East

European military policy, Rice de
scribed her NSC duties as "han
dling matters related to the Soviet
Union and Eastern Europe"
through staff work and inter
agency coordination.
Even though she helped the
Bush campaign during the elec
tion, Rice said that the offers
caught her by surprise.
"I fully expected to be teaching
my class this quarter," she said.
"You always have an inclination
that something like this might
happen, but it's by no means
foreordained."
Political Science Department

Chair Stephen Krasner called
Rice's departure "an important
loss to the (political science) teach
ing program," but added that it
is not unusual for professors to
take leaves of absence.
"We're confronted with holes in
the teaching program all the time.
It's not a unique situation," he
said.
Rice, who is popular among stu
dents for both her teaching style
and her accessibility, said that she
felt "really ambivalent" about
leaving Stanford. "I really like
teaching — I'm going to miss that.
I'm going to try to go to Stanford
in-Washington and spend some
time there, but I heard that you
work 80 hour weeks at the NSC."
In addition, Rice said that
leaving Stanford means that she
will have to delay completing a
four year research project on the
evolution of the Soviet General
Staff.


Rice
Considered a role model by
many Stanford students, Rice, 34,
said she "tend[s] not to dwell on"
her presence in a field where
women and minorities are the ex
ception.
"She's been a tremendous in
fluence on my life, being a minor
ity, being a woman and being a
Republican," Marlene Rodriguez,
a sophomore, said of Rice. "She's
going to be thoroughly missed by
a lot of people."
As an undergraduate at the
University of Denver in the early
19705, Rice originally wanted to
be a concert pianist until, in her
junior year, she took a class in
international politics which
sparked her interest in Soviet
studies.
"I stumbled along in college
with very little direction, so I'm
tolerant of people who don't know
what they're going to do," she
said.

federal government came as a
State Department intern in 1977.
Since then, she took a leave of
absence in 1986-87 to work as the
special assistant to the director of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
She has also served as a con
sultant to ABC News and has ap
peared regularly on the ABC news
show "Nightline" and PBS's
"MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour." On
campus, she is affiliated with the
Center for International Security
and Arms Control.
"I always thought that I would
serve in government for a short
period of time," she said. "When
you're interested in the kind of
things that I am, it's hard not to
want to have some kind of effect
on them."

through staff work and inter
agency coordination.
Even though she helped the
Bush campaign during the elec
tion, Rice said that the offers
caught her by surprise.
"I fully expected to be teaching
my class this quarter," she said.
"You always have an inclination
that something like this might
happen, but it's by no means
foreordained."

Chair Stephen Krasner called
Rice's departure "an important
loss to the (political science) teach
ing program," but added that it
is not unusual for professors to
take leaves of absence.
"We're confronted with holes in
the teaching program all the time.
It's not a unique situation," he
said.
Rice, who is popular among stu
dents for both her teaching style
and her accessibility, said that she
felt "really ambivalent" about
leaving Stanford. "I really like
teaching — I'm going to miss that.
I'm going to try to go to Stanford
in-Washington and spend some
time there, but I heard that you
work 80 hour weeks at the NSC."
In addition, Rice said that
leaving Stanford means that she
will have to delay completing a
four year research project on the
evolution of the Soviet General
Staff.


Rice
Considered a role model by
many Stanford students, Rice, 34,
said she "tend[s] not to dwell on"
her presence in a field where
women and minorities are the ex
ception.
"She's been a tremendous in
fluence on my life, being a minor
ity, being a woman and being a
Republican," Marlene Rodriguez,
a sophomore, said of Rice. "She's
going to be thoroughly missed by
a lot of people."
As an undergraduate at the
University of Denver in the early
19705, Rice originally wanted to
be a concert pianist until, in her
junior year, she took a class in
international politics which
sparked her interest in Soviet
studies.
"I stumbled along in college
with very little direction, so I'm
tolerant of people who don't know
what they're going to do," she
said.

federal government came as a
State Department intern in 1977.
Since then, she took a leave of
absence in 1986-87 to work as the
special assistant to the director of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
She has also served as a con
sultant to ABC News and has ap
peared regularly on the ABC news
show "Nightline" and PBS's
"MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour." On
campus, she is affiliated with the
Center for International Security
and Arms Control.
"I always thought that I would
serve in government for a short
period of time," she said. "When
you're interested in the kind of
things that I am, it's hard not to
want to have some kind of effect
on them."
Rice is the second Stanford pro
fessor to join the Bush adminis
tration.
