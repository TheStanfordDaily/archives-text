# Metal Mania

I like it hard and fast — my music
that is. Pounding drums, throbbing
bass, screeching guitar and a screaming
voice — now that's music. Phil Collins,
Taylor Dayne, Traveling Wilburys (ex
cept the one who's dead and can't travel
anymore) watch out, because Ozzy's
back and he's hotter, and more sober,
than ever, leading a parade of new and
old heavy metal bands' album releases.
At 40, the godfather (grandfather,
perhaps) of heavy metal returns to the
airwaves with his 14th album, "No Rest
For The Wicked." This serious piece of
metal is Ozzy's best album since his
work in the early '80s with no-longer
traveling-either guitar legend Randy
Rhoads.
The quality of this album is due,
mostly, to Ozzy's new band, including
long-time friend and former Black Sab
bath bassist, Geezer Butler. (How would
you like to be named Geezer?)
Ozzy has also discovered the raw tal
ent of Zakk Wylde, the latest metal
guitar master to collaborate with the
man who once bit the head off a live
dove, pigeon and bat on stage. Yumm!
As with all real metal (unlike that
wimpy stuff Bon Jovi puts out), the
energy behind this album is in Wylde's
slick guitar licks on his no-nonsense
Les Paul. Wylde's heavy riffs are
prevalent throughout the album and
shine through in such powerhouse songs
as "Miracle Man" (Jimmy Swaggart has
a song now), "Bloodbath in Paradise"
and "Fire in the Sky." You guessed it
— no lame "Be Happy" songs
here -

Along with Wylde's power chords is
Ozzy's legendary voice — as raw and
powerful as ever, invoking memories of
such classic metal tunes as "Crazy
Train" and Black Sabbath's "Iron
Man."
But whereas Ozzy's music represents
classic metal, Ratt's newest release
"Reach For The Sky" is more on the
glitter side of modern metal (but not
as flashy and wimpy as the stuff Bon
Jovi puts out).
Like their previous albums, from
"Ratt" to "Dancing Undercover,"
"Reach for the Sky" offers a handful
of tunes that will be appreciated by
lame radio stations everywhere that
play wimpy noise, such as Bobby Brown
and Tone Loc (huh?), instead of real
music, like Ozzy and Belinda Carlisle.
(Hey, I like Belinda.)
Although the album as a whole sucks
the Big One, there are a few tracks
worth noting: "I Want to Love You
Tonight" (I've used that line before at
frat parties — it doesn't work), "Bottom
Line" (not as moving as a Lennon-
McCartney ballad, but it gets the point
across) and "What I'm After" (three
guesses what singer Stephen Pearcy is
after) all contain some decent guitar
playing by Warren Demartini.
Speaking of videos, did you catch any
over break? In case you're from Kansas
or are a music major, modern music —
the stuff normal people listen to — has
created the incredibly lucrative spin-off
music video industry in which popular
bands (usually males) jump around lip
synching to their songs while attractive
young females bounce around in the
background wearing clothes, which, if
completely unraveled would contain

sufficient thread to sew on a button.
What a country!
In between Guns n' Roses videos:
"Sweet Child O' Mine" — number one
for 1988, "Welcome to the Jungle" and
"Paradise City," you probably saw clips
from such talented (I use the term loose
ly) groups as Vixen (my choice for best
undressed), Bulletßoys (hopefully
they'll bite their name soon), Femme
Fatale (Lorraine Lewis nominated for
hose-beast of the year), Kiss (they're
still alive?), Bon Jovi (wimpiest video),
White Lion, Great White, Lion Great,
Not So Great But Still White, Not So
White But Still Great and Winger. If
you saw one, you saw them all.
Winger? Oh yeah, Kep Winger's band
released their debut album last year
and have finally gained notoriety for
their hit "Seventeen." Backed by Reb
Beach on guitar, Rod Morgenstein on
drums and Paul Taylor on keyboards,
vocalist/bassist Winger has put together
a rather decent debut album, consider
ing his name is Kep and his guitarist
is Reb. (Doesn't Zakk Wylde sound
much better?)
I must warn you about "Without the
Night." If Winger is anything like all
the other pseudo-metal bands out there
they'll be releasing this one pretty soon.
And knowing radio stations, this bailad
will be played every five minutes or sd
until you'd rather sleep with a squid
than hear it again.
Since Jimi Hendrix is no-longer
traveling-either, Winger decided to go
ahead and trash "Purple Haze" — and
did they ever trash it. But that's part
of the beauty of modern music; desperf
ate bands take classic tunes and ruin
them for their generation.
