* New to the Cardinal squad,
freshman Alex Kostich smiles and
shakes his head ruefully as he
thinks about his performance in
the meet against Michigan last
Weekend.
The long-distance swimmer did
fiot quite live up to his ability in
tlis favored 1,000- and 500-meter
freestyle events, placing third and
fourth respectively.
"You might as well have been
at last year's Olympic trials. That
was the same story all over
again," Kostich says.
- He ruffles his dark hair and
looks exasperated. "I just got too
excited and started out too fast,
and then I got tired."
That, in essence, is the tale of
Kostich's heartbreaking near
miss at the 1988 Olympic trials.
During the two-day 1,500 free
style qualifying trials, he scored
a victory and a defeat — in that
order.
Kostich blew out the first trial,
9oming in first of the 40 or 50
swimmers who competed. He
slashed five seconds off his Pan
American Games-record time by
Streaking to a 15:17.29 finish. The
previous record had stood firm
for eight years, a rare feat in
modern swimming.
That's when the pressure really
set in. The 18-year-old emerged
from the water feeling thrilled by
his success but nervous about the
very high expectations that in
stantly set in. Kostich was seeded
first of the remaining eight swim

'He's got such a
great work attitude.
He's willing to do
whatever it takes to
be good. If it meant
jumping off Hoover
Tower he would do
that.'

mers going for the final two spots
on the following night.
"Those 24 hours were hellish,"
Kostich remembers. "When I got
up that morning, it hit me that
the last four years of my life were
going to come down to one single
race that night."
Telegrams, flowers and cards
from friends came pouring in, and
the crowds and iV cameras set
in full force that night. Hyper
ventilating from nervousness, the
young swimmer went for a walk
with his coach Joseph Bernal just
before the race began.
The quiet walk helped, but then
he stepped back into the pool,
heard the crowd screaming, and,
as he matter-of-factly describes it,
"swam a terrible race."
"I think I took it a little too
seriously," Kostich says. "When
the pressure came on, I couldn't
handle it. But it was a valuable
lesson."

"I hate learning those lessons,"
he hastily adds, "because I think
I've learned enough."
Stanford Coach Skip Kenney
thinks Kostich has learned
enough lessons, too. He nodded
when asked about Kostich's case
of nerves in the recent Michigan
meet.
"Alex is much too good to keep
making that mistake," Kenney
said. "That was a breaking-in
meet and I hope the rest of them
sail smoother."
Kenney first noticed Kostich at
the National Sports Festival (now
called the Olympic Festival),
where the 15-year-old won the
1,500 freestyle. Kenney recruited
Kostich for the Cardinal t#»an .
"He's got such a great work
attitude," Kenney says, "because
he's willing to do whatever it
takes to be good. If it meant jump
ing off Hoover Tower he would
do that."
That's dedication. Kostich also
stands out, according to Kenney,
as a very "up" person who cares
about his teammates.
Freshman swimmer John de
Groot characterizes Kostich as an
individual whose commitment to
the team outside of the pool has
helped everyone.
"He's very energetic, and he can
transfer that energy to the rest
of the team. I know a lot of the
upperclassmen appreciate that be
cause as they get older, they tend
to get less enthusiastic about
swimming," de Groot said.
For Kostich, coming to Stanford
meant starting in a new direction
and leaving memories of the 1988

Olympic trials far behind.
"I've got a lot to prove," Kostich
says, mentioning his parents
among those he hopes to impress.
Both were national-level compet
itors who represented Yugoslavia
at one time (they met at a swim
meet). They threw their young
ster into the pool when he was
less than a year old and encour
aged him to train hard throughout

his childhood.
Kostich starts thinking of the
NCAAs looming ahead in late
March. He is expected to score in
the 500 free and 400 IM event?.
"I really want 1989 to be my
breakthrough year," says Kostich.
He characteristically breaks into
a smile and adds "and I personally
want one of the NCAA rings,"

thinking of an older teammate
who wears one from the Cardi
nal's NCAA championship in
1987.
For now, thoughts of the
NCAAs — and the 1992 Olympic
trials someday — temporarily fade
as Kostich heads off to listen to
a few songs by Madonna before
retiring to dream of a faster 1,000
freestyle event against Michigan.
