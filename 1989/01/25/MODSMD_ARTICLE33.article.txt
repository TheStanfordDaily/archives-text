# Cardinal basketball fans: A seething throng of schizophrenics
## 
### 
Aren't we proud of ourselves?
The fans at Stanford basketball
games are better than they have
been in recent years. The impact of the
crowd is one hundred times what it was
when I was a freshman three years ago.

Opposing teams are beginning to dis
like coming to Maples. Why? Because
Stanford, due in no small part to the
crowd, keeps winning at home.
A couple of cases to further the point:
• When Arizona's All-America for
ward Sean Elliott was on all-sports radio
WFAN in New York City recently, he
said he doubted that anyone would beat
Stanford in Maples Pavilion this season.
• When a Miami Herald reporter
called me to ask some question for her
preview of last week's Cardinal-

Hurricanes game the first thing she
said was: "I heard Maples was a tough
place to play. ..."
• After that game, Miami Coach Bill
Foster noted the impact of the fans.
"They've really got it cooking in there,"
he said. "Eight years ago, you could
have shot a cannon in [there] and never
hit anybody."
A couple of years ago, no one would
have even had the notion that Stanford
was a nasty place to visit. The fans that
showed up — all 4,900 on average, in
1985 — would sit around, nearly silent
and maybe applaud when the home team
scored.
Today, things are very different. The
students arrive two hours before tipoff
to get good seats. The arena sells out
— 7,500 seats to be specific — or at
least comes close for every game (the
average crowd is 7,347).
The crowd cheers a lot, chants "dee
fense" a lot and is into the game a lot
of the time.
When Todd Lichti or Howard Wright
throws down a thunderous slam dunk
the crowd roars, even.
Members of the team constantly cite
the impact of the crowd in helping them
come back or extend the lead.
When the intensity is running at a

fever pitch, there is no doubt that op
posing teams lose a little of their edge.
The home court advantage exists at
Maples. Of that, there is no doubt.
Aren't we proud of ourselves?

Good. Now, wipe that smile of your
face.
In all honesty, I think the
crowd at Maples is more than a little
bit complacent and not all that impres
sive. In addition, Stanford hoops fans
are not even particularly knowledgeable.
Simmer down, simmer down. Hear
me out.
Friday, the morning after the team
lost at California, countless people came
up to me and said: "Man, we (the bas
ketball team) suck. I really thought we
were going to be good this year, but we
suck."
My response? "Obviously, you don't
know what you're talking about. n
I went on to explain that Cal is a
quality ballclub. They have almost as
much experience among their players
as the Cardinal, they had already beaten
two teams in the top 20 (Florida and

You're on Candid Camera!
Stanford basketball fans ham it up for the TV camera at a recent game. Unfortunately,
when the camera goes off, the cheers die down.
