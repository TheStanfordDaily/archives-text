# Golfers vault into 4th at Southern Cal Tourney
## 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
! After a very rough first round
t>n Monday, the Stanford women's
golf team rebounded enough yes
terday to move from sixth to
Fourth place in the University of
Southern California Intercol
legiate held at the Oakmont Coun
try Club in Glendale, Calif. The
team score of 312 was a full 17
strokes ahead of the previous
day's showing.
# In stark contrast to Monday's
rusty outing for the five Cardinal
players, Stanford's four top fin
ishers shot in the 70s, with junior
Stephanie Parel and sophomore
Jodi Figley tying for the team lead
at 77. Figley moved into tenth
place overall in the tourney with
a two-round total of 158.
Despite the improvement, the
overall mood of the team was little
better than yesterday."Yesterday
was horrendous, and today was
just about as horrendous," said
sophomore Michele Lyford, who
dropped six strokes off her first
round score in posting a 79.
New Mexico State continued to
set the pace with a second-round
total of 308. The Aggies consistent
play has put them comfortably in
front, nine shots ahead of second
place Arizona State. Stanford
vaulted over San Jose State and
U.S. International, which dropped
to fifth and seventh, respectively.
Figley shaved four strokes off
Monday'B 81, and is now eight
strokes behind A.J. Nealy, who
leads the individual field with a
pair of 758 for a 150 score. The
day's low score was posted by Mic
hiko Hattori of Texas, who moved
into second with her 73. No player
in the tournament has yet to shoot
par on the 6,150 yard course.
Other Stanford players improv
ing yesterday included Adele
Moore, who dropped seven strokes

in carding a 79, and Parel, who
somewhat erased yesterday's dis
appointing 83. "I played real well,
but I still shot a 77, so I'm still
disappointed," Parel said.
Stephanie Davis, the Stanford
freshman who led the team after
first-round play with an 80 and
was tied for ninth, fell off the
pace with a second-day total of
83. "I got off to a real bad start
. . . nothing in particular went well
for me today," Davis said. "But
everyone is starting to pull back
together after three weeks off. Its
been awhile since we played in
competition."
The weather was once again far
from perfect, but the players did
not seem to consider it a factor.
"No team is playing well," said
Parel, who is tied for 15th overall.
"Either everyone else is rusty like
we are, or the course is something
difficult to deal with. It's probably
a little bit of both."
Putting was one particularly
difficult aspect of the Oakmont
course, according to Parel, who
had five 3-putt holes. "There are
some tough pin positions, because
the greens are really sloped, from
the back to the front they are
really downhill."
Lyford mentioned this in citing
the third-place USC Trojans' edge
on their home course. "They
(USC) know the greens really
well, which is a huge advantage
because the greens are really
tricky."
At this point, the Cardinal is
gunning for second place, and
feels it must shoot a solid 300 as
a team in the final round today
to catch Arizona State. The Sun
Devils are only 11 shots ahead of
Stanford going into tomorrow's
final round. Overall, the attitude
seems to be one of confidence.
"We played pretty well today
compared to the rest of the field,"
Lyford said.
