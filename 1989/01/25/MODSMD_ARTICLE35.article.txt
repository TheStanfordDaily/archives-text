INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -

a tight New York defense down
the stretch led the Knicks to

3:19 left put the Knicks ahead

to go made it 118-115 and
proved to be the decisive points.
The Lakers' Magic Johnson,
who recorded his ninth triple
double of the season and sec
ond against the Knicks,
brought Los Angeles within
118-117 with 2:25 to go.
But Gerald Wilkins' driving
shot 18 seconds later made it
120-117. After Johnson missed
3-point shots with 18 and five
seconds left, New York's
Charles Oakley made two free
throws.
