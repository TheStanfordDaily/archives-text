# Card nine shows new look for '89

### Bruce Sarkisian Editorial staff 
The tireless wonder also known as Stanford base
ball Coach Mark Marquess held his first press con
ference of the season yesterday, and in typical coach
ing fashion he played down his goals for this year's
team.
After coaching last year's squad to a national
championship and coaching the U.S. Olympic base
ball team to a gold medal, Marquess said he was
excited about returning to Stanford because "it's a
challenge and we have so many young players."
The two-time defending national champion Car
dinal was picked No. 1 in the preseason polls by
both The Sporting News and ESPN/Collegiate Base
ball. Baseball America Magazine, the other major
collegiate baseball poll, picked Stanford No. 12.
"1 don't like to be picked No. 1 in any poll but
. . . we'll take what we can get," Marquess said.
When asked the inevitable question of whether
the Cardinal could make it three in a row, Marquess
expressed his doubts. "(College baseball] is not like
the pros where you can maintain a nucleus year
after year. We're probably going to get beat a lot
this year because our opponents are so good."
Stanford will return six starting field players this
year: Frank Carey at second base; Paul Carey in
right field; Eric DeGraw in center; Tim Griffin, a
I)H last year, at third base; Brian Johnson at first;
and Troy Paulsen at shortstop.
The pitching staff also returns a solid nucleus of
last year's regulars including starters Stan Spencer
and Mike Mussina and reliever Steve Chitren.
The biggest factor Marquess lost to graduation
and the Major League draft is power. With Ed
Sprague, Ron Witmeyer, and Doug Robbins all gone,
the squad will be 45 home runs lighter.
But Marquess feels that he has the talent to pick
up the slack, and has put the pressure mainly on
the broad and powerful shoulders of Paul Carey.
"I expect a big year from Paul Carey," the coach
commented.
But neither Carey nor Marquess expect him to
do it alone. Tim Griffin and Eric Cox, a newcomer
to the starting lineup at catcher, are also expected
to provide added punch.
"This is the first time since I've been here that
we've put a lot of effort into going to the weight
room," Carey said.
In addition, Marquess hopes the Cardinal will be
a little more agressive on the basepaths, commenting

that this year's team may manufacture a few more
runs.
Frank Carey, the team's leading base stealer last
season commented that "we're going to be a different
team. Our team has a lot of speed with (starting
left fielder Jack) Hollis and DeGraw in the lineup."
While Marquess was guarded about a third na
tional championship, it will not be an anomaly to
see the Cardinal in postseason play.
"The thing I'm most proud of is that we've been
to the regionals 8 consecutive years. There's a lot
of luck involved in winning a national champion
ship," he said.
The season opens Friday with an away game
against Santa Clara. Stay tuned — Marquess was
equally cautious about winning a second title.
