# Card Rugby steps on Banana Slugs
## 
### Libby Feil Staff writer 
The Stanford men's rugby team
tasted the sweetness of success
last weekend. Coming back from
what Captain Marty Hartigan de
scribed as a "depressing loss" to
Santa Clara two weeks ago, the
team gritted its collective teeth
and outplayed a tough UC-Santa
Cruz squad at UCSC, with the
Cardinal's best team winning its
match 17-9.
"We finally were playing to
gether as a team" over the week
end, reported Hartigan. "After all

of the practice, we could finally
see the light at the end of the
tunnel." The team's win over
UCSC was especially satisfying
since the Banana Slugs had
trounced Stanford in their meet
ing last year.
All three of the teams that
Stanford fielded for its matches
played smartly and squished the
Slugs. "We wanted revenge so
bad," explained Bill Bradford, cap
tain of the first team.
"We had the ball in their half
of the field 90 percent of the
time," claimed Bradford. "Our

backs played really well and had
a really strong kicking game .. .
our forwards played well too."
Slot half John Fitzpatrick kept
the ruggers out of trouble and
was a cornerstone in the Cardi
nal's victory, said Hartigan. Will
Wall was another key player, as
usual.
The rugby team hopes to keep
its winning momentum going
through this Saturday, when it
faces another difficult opponent,
the UC-Davis Aggies. The game
will be played at Maloney Field
at 11 a.m.
