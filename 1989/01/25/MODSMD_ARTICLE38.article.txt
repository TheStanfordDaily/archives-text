SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
The San Francisco Giants
swapped starting catchers with
Baltimore on Tuesday, acquir
ing Terry Kennedy from the
Orioles in exchange for Bob Mel
vin.
The trade gives San Francisco
another left-handed hitter and
added experience behind the
plate while Baltimore sheds
Kennedy's $850,000 salary for
a younger catcher known for his
defensive skills.
Kennedy, 32, is a four-time

All-Star who slumped last year
to a .228 batting average with
three home runs and 16 runs
batted in in 85 games. A career
.266 hitter, he hit .250 with 18
homers and 62 RBIs in 1987 in
his first of two seasons with the
Orioles. He made $850,000 last
year.
Melvin, 27, split the 1988
season between San Francisco
and triple-A Phoenix. He hit
.234 with eight home runs and
27 RBIs in 92 games for the
Giants and .307 in 21 games for

the Firebirds. He threw out 17
of 45 baserunners.
In 307 major-league games,
Melvin has a .220 average with
24 homers and 87 RBIs. His
salary in 1988 was $145,000.
"Terry Kennedy is a great ad
dition for our ballclub," said
Giants' president and general
manager A 1 Rosen. "He's a
proven left-handed hitting
catcher, which is something
everyone wants "
