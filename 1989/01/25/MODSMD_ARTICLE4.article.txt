fraternities all missed their quotas three
out of the past four years.
Conklin said the University is trying
to find an equilibrium in the supply and
demand for fraternity housing. Putting
ail of the eligible houses in the Draw
would be like "testing the depth of the
water with both feet," she said.
University officials don't dismiss the
possibility of placing another house in
the Draw next year.
"The house in the next most serious
trouble is the Betas'," Pisano said. If the
Betas don't make their quota, and if the
fraternity system as a whole misses its
quota, then the Betas will enter the Draw
next year, he said.

The Alpha Delta Phi house will be the
only fraternity house to enter the Draw
this year, but five other fraternities may
also lose their houses, according to
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano.
A fraternity house is eligible for place
ment in the Draw if it fails to reach the
housing quota three out of four years.
Also, if the entire fraternity system
misses its quota, the house with the high
est quota deficit may be placed in the
Draw.
In December, University officials
placed the Alpha Delt house in the Draw,
because it met both conditions.
All of the fraternities eligible for the
Draw weren't included this year because
the University didn't want to add several
houses to the Draw at once, according to
Diana Conklin, director of the Row. Beta
