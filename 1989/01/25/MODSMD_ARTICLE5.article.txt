# Students help officers catch campus criminal
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
It was the typical dorm bur
glary that worries many students
— but this time, it was the stu
dents who left the burglar worry
ing.
Around 2:25 p.m. Monday, a
student in Robinson House in
Sterling Quad left her door open
as she went to the bathroom. A
man entered her room, stole a
handful of jewelry and silently
left.
When the student returned to
her room and discovered the theft,
she immediately announced it
over the Sterling Quad intercom
system. She also phoned the Stan
ford Police Department.
The police were quick to re
spond, but five residents of Rob
inson House were even quicker.
The residents — whose names
have been withheld to protect
their identity from the criminal
— spotted a suspicious person ex
iting the house. They followed him
into Governor's Corner.
The suspect entered other
dorms and tried to enter rooms,
according to Sgt. Tim Hanrahan,
who led the team of officers who
arrived at the scene. The band of
Robinson residents was still on
his trail.

At 3:20 p.m., the police received
another call from a witness in
Griffin House in the Suites. By
then, Hanrahan, Sgt. Hick En
berg, and Officers Barbara Ayres
and Jeff Bell had surrounded
Governor's Corner, waiting for
the suspect to leave.
Hanrahan said his officers were
following normal procedure in
waiting for the suspect. Searching
the area would have risked the
suspect's escape, he said.
One of the Robinson residents
involved then saw the suspect
near the Suites' Dining Societies
and informed the ring of police.
Within moments, William
Hathron, 28, of San Jose, whom
Hanrahan described as a "very
serious criminal," was ap
prehended. The officers searched
him and found the stolen jewelry,
which was subsequently identified
by the robbery victim.
Hanrahan praised the witnesses
and his officers.
"This was the perfect case when
we received just the right help
from members of the communi
ty," he said.
He also said the Robinson res
idents' decision not to approach
the suspect was smart because an
approach could have been poten
