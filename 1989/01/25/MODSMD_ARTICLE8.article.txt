# Campbell not satisfied with offer
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
According to Hoover Institution
Director W, Glenn Campbell, he
and the Stanford Board of Trus
tees are "still haggling" over a
number of conditions that stand
in the way of his August retire
ment.
Campbell announced at a press
conference last July that he and
Trustees President James Gaither
had reached an acceptable retire
ment package.
In April, Campbell will turn 65,
the age established for retirement
of Hoover directors by a 1959 res
olution.
Since late last September,
Campbell has maintained that his
plans for retirement were never
finalized and that he might
remain on the job until he is 70.
In an interview broadcast on
KZSU last night, Campbell echoed
these sentiments, claiming that he
and the University still "haven't
agreed to anything."
He added that his term as di
rector may continue due to the
lack of progress in the search for
his replacement. The list of his
possible successors has been "nar
rowed down" to 30 or 40, he said.
In a far-reaching interview,
Campbell also said that Hoover
accrues "very few" advantages
from maintaining ties with the

University. If the University ad
ministration and certain "jerks in
the faculty" continue their current
hostilities toward Hoover, he said,
a severing of relations will hap
pen.
Campbell said last night that
he would relinquish his current
post and accept a position as coun
selor to Hoover if he were granted
the following concessions:
• An annual salary of $150,000,
a figure which he said he had
been promised but which Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
later cut to $125,000;

• A four-month delay of his re
tirement date, which he said
would entitle him to a $100,000
bonus for having served as direc
tor for 30 years; and
• A $25,000 addition to his cur
rent pension plan.
Campbell said that he and the
University had come "very close
to agreement" over his retirement
in August. Since that time,
various difficulties arose, he said.
"They wouldn't give me what
I thought they'd promised," he
said.
Campbell said that he felt in
sulted by Kennedy's salary offer
of $125,000. "Kennedy knows how
to insult somebody."
Kennedy "amuses me," Camp
bell added.
