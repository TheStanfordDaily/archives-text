# GE gives grant to attract minorities

### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Recognizing the lack of minority fac
ulty in technical fields, the General
Electric Foundation announced Monday
that Stanford will receive a four-year
grant to attract minority faculty and
graduate students.
The grant is part of a 10-year, $15
million program called Faculty for the
Future, designed to encourage more par
ticipation by minorities and women in
science, engineering and management
fields.
Of the 21,500 engineering professors
in the United States, only 200 are black,
300 are Hispanic and 400 are women,
according to the GE Foundation.
Stanford will receive $300,000 over
four years to provide research grants of
$20,000 per year for junior faculty and
two fellowships annually for incoming
graduate students interested in aca
demic careers.
The graduate student fellowships in
clude full tuition, a $12,000 stipend,
and a $1,000 "mentoring stipend" to
allow fellows to conduct activities en
couraging minorities to pursue graduate
degrees and academic careers.
The research grants for junior faculty
will be awarded by the deans of the
faculty's respective schools to help new
minority and women faculty do the re
search necessary to apply for tenure.
Paul Ostergard, president of the GE

Foundation, said, "As more minority
and female students enroll at our uni
versities, it's important that they see
more minority and female faculty role
models."
University President Donald Kennedy
said, "General Electric and the GE
Foundation have an excellent record for
supporting and encouraging minority
students at Stanford and at other in
stitutions. I commend them for recog
nizing the importance of increasing the
numbers of minority and women faculty
in engineering, in the sciences and in
management, and for introducing a
strong program to support that objec
tive."
Joseph Goodman, chair of the Depart
ment of Electrical Engineering, said
there is a lack of minority and female
faculty in his department.
Goodman said he could not classify
any faculty member in the department
as a "disadvantaged minority," and he
added that he knew of only four Asian-
American professors, two black faculty
members and one woman, who also hap
pens to be Asian-American.
Goodman said one of the reasons
there are so few minority and female
faculty in engineering is that it takes
four years of graduate study, plus four
years of doctoral work, before a person
can become an engineering professor.
The long time required to achieve
such qualifications means that any
changes in the percentages of minority

and female faculty will come very slowly,
he said.
Assoc. Dean of Graduate Studies
Cecilia Burciaga said the number of mi
nority graduate students pursuing Ph.D.
degrees is "drastically low."
In addition to helping fund the edu
cation of graduate students, she said
the grant will also generate "the
publicity [Stanford] needs to encourage
more applicants."
Burciaga said that "many minorities
believe that a Ph.D. is simply out of
the question" because of the high costs
of graduate sclxx>l.
History Prof. Albert Camarillo, chair
of the University Committee on Minor
ity Issues, said there is a "gross under
representation" of minority faculty in
all disciplines.
Camarillo estimates that minorities
only make up about seven percent of
the total Stanford faculty. He attributed
much of the problem to the long time
and enormous expenses required to earn
a graduate degree.
Many minorities in the past 10 to 15
years have opted for higher-paying pro
fessional degrees, such as law or
medicine, rather than teaching,
Camarillo said.
He added that the GE program is
characteristic of a number of private
sector initiatives to help produce mi
nority faculty. Camarillo himself re
ceived a grant in 1970 from the Ford
Foundation to develop minority faculty.
