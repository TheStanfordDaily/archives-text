Re: Proposal Meeting Housing Assignments of First-Year Students of Color

in writing, please send your thoughts to C-URA, c/o Jackie Miller, Building 10, I.D. 2061.
CURRENT SYSTEM
Currently frosh are assigned to residences in a way that seeks to make the population of each house as much as possible a reflection of the ethnic, geographic, regional, academic and athletic diversity of the
class Each residence is an approximate microcosm of the class as a whole.
Indian population is a small percentage of the class; special housing arrangements apply to American Indian students.
The distribution of students of color over the residence system is obviously a function, in part, of the total numbers of students of color in the entering class. For 1988-89, with a large fmsh class and increased
enrollment of students of color, the numbers were: Blacks (165), Chicano/Latinos (162), and Asian Americans (245).
that they are put on the spot by being kx>ked to as representatives of their ethnic communities.
ALTERNATIVE MODEL UNDER CONSIDERATION
A proposal has been made to assign larger numbers of first year students of color, of the same ethnic background to individual houses. To facilitate discussion and response to the proposal, one specific model
is laid out below, with its components listed in order of priority. Variations of this model are possible, and, indeed, solicited.
(1) All houses with fmsh would have a least two of the three larger ethnic communities represented.
(2) In all-frosh houses, a gn.up would have no fewer than eight students of a particular background; in four-class houses, a group would have no fewer than four frosh of a particular background.
(3) In four-class houses, a group would have no fewer than eight students of the same ethnic background, including upperclass students.
The nrmosed chance would have some effect on the mix of students in the residences. The actual number of fmsh of the same ethnic background in a house could depend in part on the number of upper
class students of that ethnicity who are assigned to the house in the Draw. Where many houses now have representation of ihe three largest communities of color, most houses would have two groups rt puse e ,
for example, a house might have Asian American and Black student but no Chicano students.
If the alternative model were implemented students of color would be among more students who share their background. Students of color might feel more comfortable and supported in their residence and
more encouraged to participate fully and equally in house affairs. The alternative model would affect the mix of students assigned to a house and would have an effect on interaction and discussion. In some
houses, one significant population of students would be absent, affecting daily interaction and the range of perspectives that come up in house discussions.
QUESTIONS
Community opinion will be important in reaching a decision on whether the pniposal should be tried on an experimental basis. Please let us know your views on these questions:
1. From your vantage point, what aspects of the current undergraduate residence experience of all frosh in general and of frosh in color in particular would be affected by the proposal? And how would they
be affected? , .
2. What other considerations should be made in evaluating this pmposal:'
3. What general and specific changes in the proposal would improve it?
4. Should the system be made optional in some way?
5 At present, students' Western Culture/CIV choices determine housing assignments; then efforts are made to balance the populations of houses across several dimensions, including ethnicity. If the pnposal
is adopted, should efforts to grant students of cofor their highest available CIV choice take precedence over efforts to gmup students of color together.'
6. Should the alternative model be tried on an experimental basis next year?
7. Should the current method of freshmen assignments be maintained? Why? If so, are there better means for helping students of color feel more supported and less isolated in residences under the c urrent
system?
