## New health secretary placates conservatives 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Bush's embattled nominee
as secretary of health wooed and
won the support of a cadre of
conservative anti-abortion sen
ators yesterday and got a fresh
endorsement from the president.
"He has supported my position
100 percent," Bush told two news
paper reporters in an interview,
saying the chances were "none"
that he would withdraw the nom
ination of Louis Sullivan to head
the Department of Health and
Human Services.
"I've not heard anyone suggest
ing that he will not be confirmed,"
Bush said.
Bush's chief of staff, John
Sununu said Sullivan had sugges
ted that the key position of under
secretary be given to Constance
Horner, well known for her anti
abortion views. She is currently
director of the Office of Personnel
Management. Horner's appoint
ment was expected to be an
nounced soon.
Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-
N.H., who objected on Tuesday to
Sullivan's appointment, had asked
that the new secretary be sur
rounded by aides "who would ac
tively support the president on
abortion."
Sullivan appeared to have
calmed the uproar which broke
out when Sen. Bob Packwood of
Oregon, a pro-choice Republican,
said that in a recent meeting Sul
livan had expressed his personal
support for the Supreme Court's
1973 Roe vs. Wade decision
legalizing abortions.
The nominee met with a hand
ful of anti-abortion conservatives

in the office of Senate Minority
Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan., and
they emerged saying he persuaded
them that he would like to see
that court decision reversed.
Among those expressing satis
faction was Humphrey, who said:
"Dr. Sullivan believes in his heart
that the Roe vs. Wade decision
should be overturned."
That is Bush's position, too. As
recently as Monday, with thou
sands of anti-abortion protestors
marched to mark the 16th anni
versary of the high court's deci
sion, Bush called for the decision's
reversal.
Sullivan himself said little
publicly.
"Once the hearings go forward,
everything will be cleared," he
said.
He called the meeting in Dole's
office "very supportive."
Joining Humphrey and Dole at
the meeting were such key Re
publican opponents of abortion as
Jesse Helms of North Carolina,
Orrin Hatch of Utah, James
McClure of Idaho and William
Armstrong of Colorado.
Also attending was a conserva
tive who has taken a pro-choice
position for many years — Sen.
/Man Simpson, R-Wyo.
He agreed with the others that
Sullivan had expressed opposition
to Roe vs. Wade. He said the nom
inee "not only feels that as a desig
nee of George Bush but as a per
son."
"He never quite knew what was
waiting for him here," said
Simpson. "He was trying to,
maybe like a doctor would, explain
his diagnosis."
