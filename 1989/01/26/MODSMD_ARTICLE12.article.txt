# President appoints ethics reform panel
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Bush, saying current law fails
to keep the government suffi
ciently honest, established yester
day an ethics panel to take a fresh
look at conflict-of-interest stand
ards and recommend new ones.
In naming the eight-member
President's Commission on
Federal Ethics Law Reform, Bush
said he wants an "unambiguous
. . . code of conduct to ensure that
those who serve the public trust
avoid any actual or apparent con
flict between their personal and
public interests."
However, he said the standards
of conduct he will propose for ex
ecutive and congressional officials
should not be "unreasonably
restrictive" to dissuade capable
people from entering government
service.
Bush had supported President
Reagan's veto last fall of a con
gressional ethics package, which
Reagan said was excessive and
would hamper the government's
ability to attract top-rate people.
Bush at the time said he would
propose his own legislative re
forms.
The president this week has
made ethics a continuing theme
with symbolic events and talks to
staff members on the topic, to
ensure that he does not face the
allegations of an administration
"sleaze factor" that stemmed
from ethical allegations against
many Reagan administration of
ficials.
"Current federal ethics rules do
not adequately serve to eliminate
use of public funds for private

gains," Bush said in signing an
executive order to set up his new
commission.
"The current framework is frag
mented, confusing and, most im
portant, it does not incorporate
sufficient safeguards to protect
the public interest in an honest
and fair government."
Bush ordered the panel to give
him recommendations for new
legislation by March 9.
The panel is chaired by GrifTin
Bell, the former attorney general
in the Carter administration, and
Malcolm Wilkey, a senior judge on
the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington.
"I'm asking you and other
members of the commission to
take a fresh look at the ethical
standards that apply to all three
branches of the federal govern
ment," Bush said.
One of Reagan's criticisms of
last year's congressional package
was that it was more restrictive
against executive branch person
nel than Congress members.
White House Press Secretary
Marlin Fitzwater, asked whether
Bush's heavy public emphasis on
the ethics issue was an implied
criticism of officials' conduct in
the Reagan administration, where
Bush served as vice president,
said, "His purpose is simply to
state his views and do what he
believes is right."
He said Bush feels "It is appro
priate at the beginning of the ad
ministration for him to make
those views known in a way that
is unmistakably clear to the
federal service."
