# Tower aims for defense budget cuts

WASHINGTON (AP) - De
fense Secretary-designate John
Tower told former colleagues on
the Senate Armed Services Com
mittee yesterday "there is a need
for reform" at the Pentagon and
he will work with them to achieve
it.
On the opening day of his con
firmation hearing, Tower also
said that he would aim for budget
savings and realized the Bush ad
ministration must "try to achieve
as much or more defense with less
money."
Tower, a Texas Republican, was
chairman of the Armed Services
Committee from 1981-84 and led
the fight in Congress to approve
President Reagan's trillion-dollar
military buildup. However, he
rebuffed suggestions that he
might be unable to cut the Pen
tagon budget.
"I am not such a mindless hawk
that I will come before you and
ask for increases I know you will
not grant," Tower told the com
mittee.
On the Soviet Union, Tower
said he welcomed changes brought
by President Mikhail Gorbachev,
but he also said they did not "alter
the fact that in terms of political
philosophy and offensive capabil
ity, the Soviet Union remains our

greatest adversary."
At the Pentagon, "there is a
need for reform," declared Tower,
vowing to implement changes
legislated by Congress.
He told lawmakers he had
severed his ties with defense con
tractors for whom he worked as
a consultant over the past two
years, and said he would appoint
"tough, aggressive" deputies and

adopt a policy of "zero tolerance"
toward misbehavior in the Penta
gon.
Tower said he would review all
U.S. weapons systems with the
knowledge "that difficult choices
be made."
"Nothing is sacred," he said.
"There is no room in the future
of the defense budget for costly
mistakes."
