North subpoenas House members
WASHINGTON (AP) - Fired National Secu
rity Council aide Oliver North subpoenaed former
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Lee
Hamilton and Rep. David McCurdy for North's
upcoming trial in the Iran-Contra case, one of
the congressmen confirmed yesterday.
Also, North has subpoenaed records from three
House panels that tried unsuccessfully during
1985-1986 to determine what action he was
taking on the Contras' behalf. A House reply
that sought to quash portions of the subpoena
complained that he sought "the broadest imagi
nable range" of documents.
At a court hearing, U.S. District Judge Gerhard
Gesell said the matter of subpoenaing two con
gressmen must be approached with "some degree
of accommodation" and that "we're not going to
pull them off the floor" of Congress to testify at
North's trial.
North attorney Barry Simon didn't identify
the two congressmen. However, McCurdy, an
Oklahoma Democrat and a member of the House
Intelligence Committee, confirmed in an inter
view that he and Hamilton had been subpoenaed
by North. Hamilton, D-Ind., chaired the commit
tee during 1985-86 and is no longer a member
of the committee.
Bush considers S&L depositor fee
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush said
yesterday his administration is considering im
posing a fee on customers of savings and loan
institutions to help the federal government pay
to insure the troubled S&L industry.
A Treasury Department spokesman said ac
counts in commercial banks and credit unions
also would be subject to the fees.

Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, appearing
on television interview programs, said plans un
der review include such fees as 25 cents for every
$100 in deposits at a thrift and that the premiums
would be used by the federal government to insure
the deposits.
At the White House, Bush said, "That's one
option," adding that the idea had not been pre
sented as a formal recommendation. "And so I'm
not going to say what I'm going to do, but that
is one option," he said.
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
told reporters, "What you're looking at today is
a trial balloon" that was leaked to see what the
reaction would be. "There will be other trial
balloons."
Court revives discrimination suit
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal appeals
court yesterday revived a lesbian's suit against
the CIA for denying her a security clearance,
and ruled that judges can review discrimination
claims against the intelligence agency.
The ClA's explanation for its actions in this
case suggests the agency "considers all persons
who engage in homosexual activity to be unac
ceptable security risks," the court said in a 3-0
decision.
The ruling allows Julie Dubbs, an openly les
bian employee of a military contractor on the
San Francisco Peninsula, to go to trial on her
claim that the CIA unconstitutionally denied her
a high-level security clearance in 1981. Her
lawyer, Richard Gayer, said the decision was at
least a first step toward eliminating bias in the
agency.
"It gives us a chance to embarrass the CIA"
by forcing it to justify its practices, he said.
