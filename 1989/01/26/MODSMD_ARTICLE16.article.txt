## Clear policy needed 
### 
Sigma Chi may be next
fraternity penalized by
arbitrary party rules

TALL BLOCK letters spell out
the words 'beach party' on
the top of a recent party flier
distributed by the Sigma Chi Fra
ternity. Underneath the words,
stands the Sigma Chi emblem,
three inches high. Palm trees sur
round the emblem and a beach
bum, wearing sandals and a floppy
straw hat, lounges on top of the
two Greek letters.
The flier announces the fact that
the Electric Monks, a popular
campus band, will be playing at
the house. And at the bottom of
the flier, in two-inch dark letters,
appears the date and time of the
party — Thurs. 10 o'clock.
Also on the flier are four differ
ent types of alcoholic iced tea
drawings and one drawing of non
alcoholic Lipton iced tea.
The iced tea drawings, which
stand one inch tall, are the "cen
terpiece" of the flier, according to
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano. In Pisano's eyes, the Sigma
Chis designed a flier that placed
too much emphasis on alcohol and
violated University policy. Now fra
ternity members face a possible
suspension of their social priv
ileges.
Pisano's judgment call is not all
that convincing. In comparison
with the rest of the flier, the iced
tea drawings are small.

The Sigma Chis had their wits
about them when they were de
signing the flier — they weren't
out to make booze the focus. In
the fall, after a keg appeared on a
party flier, Sigma Chi president
Marty Hartigan received a warning
from Pisano to be more careful
next time.
Hartigan, who gave the final OK
for last week's flier, said he had
in mind Pisano's words of warning
when he approved it.
Knowing all too well that Pisano
had his eyes on their advertise
ment, the Sigma Chis weren't
about to do anything radical and
make alcohol the flier's "center
piece."
Rather than play a guessing
game with the fraternities, Pisano
needs to have a clear-cut policy
that is not so open for interpreta
tion. Or if what he is truly saying
is "no alcohol on party fliers," then
just come out and say it.
As it now stands, Pisano is un
clear about what is inappropriate
advertising — he simply asks that
alcohol not be the "focus" of party
fliers.
While Pisano said he encourages
fraternity members to "run their
ads by the [resident assistant] and
the house president," this process
didn't pay off for the Sigma Chis.
Four different pairs of eyes — two
house members, a social chair and
the president, all saw the flier and
gave it the thumbs up.
If Pisano wants to regain the
trust of Stanford's fraternities,
then he needs to establish a clear
cut policy with no surprises at
tached.
