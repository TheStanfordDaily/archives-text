## Columns, then and now 
### 
SIXTY ONE YEARS AGO. my
grandfather wrote a column for his
college newspaper, The David
sonian. It was the time of President
Woodrow Wilson and the post-World War
I, pre-Great Depression era. Abroad, com
munism was beginning to threaten and.
at home, alcohol was? removed from our
shelves.
Reading his column is a trip back to
this period of our American history, but
it provides a unique perspective, not
found in textbooks, of a young college
student who witnessed this history, in
the making.
It's a challenge to my mind to accept
that "history" has been made over time,
and has not always existed as we know
it today. Events that are so deeply rooted
in my own sense of our historical past,
that I cannot conceive of the present
without them, i.e., the stock market crash
of 1929, the rise of the Third Reich, the
independence of Africa, had at one time
not even occurred, and could probably
not have ever been predicted.
Certainly, my grandfather would have
never predicted them as he sat at his
desk writing his column. Still, upon
reading that same column today, with
the hindsight I have been granted, I can't
help but wonder what would have hap
pened if he could have predicted the fu
ture.
In one instance, my grandfather dis
cussed the federal budget, an "everyday"
kind of topic, but one that would prove
to be of critical importance in the 1980s.
However, for him the issue involved less
anxiety, and he wrote: "In making his

annual report Secretary Mellon showed
a surplus for the year of $635 million in
the treasury. Similar surpluses were pre
dicted by him for 1928 and 1929."
Imagine that — a budget surplus! Such
a treasury report would be a miracle, if
not,an impossibility, today. If Secretary
Mellon had only hod the foresight to save
the surplus, in an extremely high
interest-bearing account, we might not
be facing a trillion dollar deficit today.
Of course, much of that $635 million
would have been sucked up in the fol
lowing decade, since, contrary to his pre
dictions, knocking on the back door of
1928 was the stock market crash and
depression of 1929.
In party politics, my grandfather chal
lenged the system and may have changed
the course of our history. He came from
a rich Southern Democratic tradition that
had prevailed since the Civil War, but he
decided to vote Republican, encouraging
others to do the same, because he felt
the Democratic Party did not take the
South seriously: "Party leaders know
that the South will vote and, moreover,
they know that the South will vote the
Democratic ticket. The South has voted
solidly for the Democratic ticket for 50
years and present indications are that
they may still be good for another 50."
Over 50 years later, we know this to
not be the case, for recently, the Repub
licans have swept through the South.
Perhaps many Southerners did decide to
desert the Democratic Party until proper
attention was paid to the Southern states.
It appears, however, that the attention
came a bit too late or the desertion be

came a bit too popular, for today's
Southern-Repubiican allegiance seems as
strong as yesterday's Southern-Democrat
one. And I suppose I, as a diehard Dem
ocrat, have my grandfather to thank for
that.
The specific references have changed,
but many of the themes my grandfather
addressed, political elections, government
policies, social criticism and personal re
flection, are still found in columns today.
Although monumental changes have oc
curred in our world since he first picked
up his pen, the role of the young colum
nist is still the same. To challenge tra
dition, to question the establishment, to
examine our society, to discover where
we belong — these are the things we all
live for.
As I retire my pen, or keyboard I should
say, as a columnist, I wonder whether
the things I have written will hold future
significance or future irrelevancy. I can
only hope 1 have shed some light on the
present. And who knows, maybe some
day my grandchildren, God forbid, will
find these old columns in an attic some
where, and will have a trip through their
past history that is, for us, still an await
ing future.

the making.
It's a challenge to my mind to accept
that "history" has been made over time,
and has not always existed as we know
it today. Events that are so deeply rooted
in my own sense of our historical past,
that I cannot conceive of the present
without them, i.e., the stock market crash
of 1929, the rise of the Third Reich, the
independence of Africa, had at one time
not even occurred, and could probably
not have ever been predicted.
Certainly, my grandfather would have
never predicted them as he sat at his
desk writing his column. Still, upon
reading that same column today, with
the hindsight I have been granted, I can't
help but wonder what would have hap
pened if he could have predicted the fu
ture.
In one instance, my grandfather dis
cussed the federal budget, an "everyday"
kind of topic, but one that would prove
to be of critical importance in the 1980s.
However, for him the issue involved less
anxiety, and he wrote: "In making his

annual report Secretary Mellon showed
a surplus for the year of $635 million in
the treasury. Similar surpluses were pre
dicted by him for 1928 and 1929."
Imagine that — a budget surplus! Such
a treasury report would be a miracle, if
not,an impossibility, today. If Secretary
Mellon had only hod the foresight to save
the surplus, in an extremely high
interest-bearing account, we might not
be facing a trillion dollar deficit today.
Of course, much of that $635 million
would have been sucked up in the fol
lowing decade, since, contrary to his pre
dictions, knocking on the back door of
1928 was the stock market crash and
depression of 1929.
In party politics, my grandfather chal
lenged the system and may have changed
the course of our history. He came from
a rich Southern Democratic tradition that
had prevailed since the Civil War, but he
decided to vote Republican, encouraging
others to do the same, because he felt
the Democratic Party did not take the
South seriously: "Party leaders know
that the South will vote and, moreover,
they know that the South will vote the
Democratic ticket. The South has voted
solidly for the Democratic ticket for 50
years and present indications are that
they may still be good for another 50."
Over 50 years later, we know this to
not be the case, for recently, the Repub
licans have swept through the South.
Perhaps many Southerners did decide to
desert the Democratic Party until proper
attention was paid to the Southern states.
It appears, however, that the attention
came a bit too late or the desertion be

came a bit too popular, for today's
Southern-Repubiican allegiance seems as
strong as yesterday's Southern-Democrat
one. And I suppose I, as a diehard Dem
ocrat, have my grandfather to thank for
that.
The specific references have changed,
but many of the themes my grandfather
addressed, political elections, government
policies, social criticism and personal re
flection, are still found in columns today.
Although monumental changes have oc
curred in our world since he first picked
up his pen, the role of the young colum
nist is still the same. To challenge tra
dition, to question the establishment, to
examine our society, to discover where
we belong — these are the things we all
live for.
As I retire my pen, or keyboard I should
say, as a columnist, I wonder whether
the things I have written will hold future
significance or future irrelevancy. I can
only hope 1 have shed some light on the
present. And who knows, maybe some
day my grandchildren, God forbid, will
find these old columns in an attic some
where, and will have a trip through their
past history that is, for us, still an await
ing future.
