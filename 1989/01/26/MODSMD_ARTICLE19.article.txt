## Ujamaa community has much to offer to everyone 
### 
IN THE AFTERMATH of the
Ujamaa incident, we, the Ujamaa
Staff, would like take this opportu
nity to invite the Stanford community
to our House.
Before the tragic event last quarter,
we had, in the great tradition of the
house, been advancing the pluralistic
goals of the University and were work
ing toward building a community that
all of our residents could feel comforta
ble in and a part of.
"Unity, Education, Celebration" was
our stated theme for the year and all
of our residents were friendly, receptive
and eager to become involved in dorm
programs and activities set up to
achieve our goals.
Unfortunately the incident seriously
undermined the unity we were striving
for in the first quarter, and we were
faced with the difficult task of bring-

ing back together a dorm we had
initially worked so hard to unify.
In the spirit of Jesse Jackson's
motto, we are now "Keeping Hope
Alive" and are reaching for even
"higher ground" this quarter. Rebuild
ing our community around the theme
of education, we have planned many
programs and activities this quarter
and we invite the entire Stanford
community to attend.
Even though we are optimistic about
the future, we are still angered by the
incident. The Daily's reporting in the
wake of the incident was less than
helpful and the University's failure to
deal with the matter in a timely man
ner prolonged our stress.
It is unfortunate that some of our
residents will carry the anger, frustra
tion, disillusionment and bitterness
that comes with such an occurrence,

and it is also unfortunate that we, the
Ujamaa staff, had to sacrifice school
work, sleep and peace of mind to deal
with a situation that should have been
addressed with greater efficiency by
the University.
We continue to be outraged by the
incident but we find solace in the
recently issued fact-finding report that
documents the incident, released on
Jan. 18. Striving for objectivity, the
report is well-articulated, factually
correct and accurately portrays the
characters of the individuals involved
in the incident.
We hope that the Judicial Affairs
Office will be swift in its judgment of
the individuals involved in the incident
and hold true to the spirit of the
Fundamental Standard in advancing
the ideals of our pluralistic community.
With the attention that this case has

already received, locally and nationally,
the response of the Judicial Affairs
Officer will surely be viewed as a
highly significant decision. This will be
a precedent-setting case.
We urge the Judicial Affairs Officer
to take a serious stand on this incident
and act with dispatch so that Ujamaa
can move on to higher ground.
The Ujamaa community has much to
offer to everyone. We are excited about
the rest of the year and hope that the
Stanford community will take some
time out to visit one of its prized black
institutions, advancing the cause of
pluralism.
