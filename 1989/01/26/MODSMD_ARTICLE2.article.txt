# Res Ed crises programs criticized by some RFs
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
Three months after a racist in
cident at Ujamaa House and nine
months after the homophobic in
cidents at Otero House, some res
ident fellows are questioning
whether Residential Education's
programs prepare house staff for
potential problems and how to in
tervene when such problems arise.
According to Alice Supton, as
sociate dean of Student Affairs for
Residential Education, the role of
Res Ed is to create communities
that offer opportunities for dis
cussion and intellectual exchange
and to educate students about dif
ferences of backgrounds and
beliefs.
Some residential staff, however,
feel that Res Ed could have better
prepared house staff and more ef-

imagination it could be called satisfac

fectively handled the incidents at
Ujamaa and Otero.
Last October, two white Lagu
nita Court residents admitted to
defacing a poster in Ujamaa, the
black theme house. Last spring,
an Otero freshman was kicked out
of University housing following
numerous belligerent and homo
phobic actions.
"The procedure used was not

successful. I don't see how by any
stretch of the imagination it could
be called satisfactory," John Per
ry, Soto resident fellow, said of
Res Ed's involvement at Ujamaa.
"I can't think of one particular
program or activity they
facilitated or generated," said
Ujamaa RF Michael Britt.
Norm Robinson, Associate
Dean of Student Affairs, said Res
Ed's involvement is largely deter
mined by the extent to which a
house residential staff asks it to
step in.
"Our basic approach is for the
house to try to deal with these
situations at the house level,"
Robinson said. "Because we're so
decentralized, it's up to the house
staff to bring it to the attention
of those who don't live there."
But Perry, Britt and others feel
that a drawback of Res Ed's ap
proach to dorm conflicts is that
it does not have a consistent
guideline for staff to follow in such
situations.
Although "there is no really ob
vious glaring fault" in the Res Ed
system, Otero RF Dennis Mat
thies said that "more time and
resources need to be devoted to
the articulation of our philosophy
and policy."
"Res Ed does a good job when
they have something to commu
nicate," Perry said. "I [feel] a cer
tain sense of them not having
thought through what to tell staff
to do in these situations. We need
a document that says, 'Here's how
to handle this case."'
"It's much too important for
the RFs to figure out on their

own. Most RFs probably thought
that most racist actions come
pretty clearly under the Funda
mental Standard. That's not quite
clear now," he added.
Britt agreed that while Res Ed
prepares staff members for com
mon dorm problems, it offers little
guidance for dealing with dra
matic events.
"It's a system-wide failure to
not have in place a set of rules
that specify what happens to stu
dents in this situation. If we had
[rules], we wouldn't be hanging
in limbo right now," he said.
Supton said that residential
staff training does not specifically
focus on handling situations such
as Ujamaa and Otero because they
are highly unusual situations.
"Our role is helping residence
staff to know what kind of support
systems are available when prob
lems can't be dealt with at the
house level," Supton said.
Although Matthies would not
comment directly on Res Ed's in
volvement in resolving the Otero
incident, he said, "It caught all of
us by surprise. We all could have
used more preparation."
Laurie Larson, a resident assis
tant at Otero last year, said that
Res Ed did not play a large role
in resolving the incident. But she
added that she always knew the
Res Ed officials were available if
she needed them and that "they
did as much as we wanted them
to do."

"I think Res Ed gives each dorm
the latitude to do what it has to
do. It places a lot of trust and
responsibility in the RFs and RAs.
I appreciate that respect," Larson
added.
Matthies and other RFs are cur
rently members of a working
group, organized by Madera RF
and Asst. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Charles Junkerman, to
come up with a protocol for res
idence staff to use in situations
such as the Otero and Ujamaa
incidents.
Junkerman said that the group,
the Committee on Undergraduate
Residential Affairs, does not in
tend to criticize Res Ed, but rather
to develop some informed sugges
tions on how to reform policy
relating to residential staff prep
aration.
But Supton emphasized that
there will always be things that
no protocol could anticipate.
Under the current system, Res
Ed intervenes only when alerted
by house staff to a situation and
expects residence staff to know
when to seek outside help and
what resources to use.
"The existing system in place
is clear, although it's not always
followed. The best plan is to make
the existing system work effec
tively and make everyone com
fortable using it."
"You can have the most well
developed plan and the best
intentioned people, but the nature

of the crisis is such that no
amount of training can prepare
you to fully manage the situa
tion," Supton said.
She added that a case study of
the Otero incident will be used in
future RA training.
In addition to the question of
preparing staff, there is the ques
tion of how Res Ed should react
when a mtyor problem erupts.
Britt said that earlier Res Ed
involvement probably would not
have defused the situation at
Ujamaa, but he was critical of its
involvement during the aftermath
of the incidents.
Britt criticized Res Ed for a se
ries of meetings with RFs follow
ing the Ujamaa incident that he
said wrongly focused on Ujamaa
itself instead of racism on campus
in general.
"They needed a broader ap
proach to dealing with the after
math instead of just talking about
the Ujamaa incident like a cancer
that's isolated," he said.
"The intent was to get people

to talk about what issues the in
cident would raise in their owr
houses," Robinson said. "It coulc
have happened anywhere, and wt
wanted to make sure people were
thinking in those terms."
Britt also was disturbed thai
Res Ed did not communicate with
him much in the aftermath of the
Ujamaa incident. Res Ed did not
inform him of a meeting with
white Ujamaa students that Res
Ed and an RA organized, he said
Nor was he informed that Res Ec
was considering a dorm trip tc
get the residents away fronr
campus, Britt said.
Explaining the miscommunica
tion, Robinson said, "An R/
phoned me and had a variety o:
suggestions. My assumption wai
that there had been a staff meet
ing and that the RF must be ir
control of all this. I assumed in
correctly."
"I hope we don't ever have t(
replay this," Robinson said. "W<
were all caught by surprise. I hopt
we can learn a lot from it."
