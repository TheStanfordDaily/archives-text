# Editorial focused on positive sides of Stanford Greek life
## 
### 
Thank you for your considerate edi
torial on Jan. 24 praising the annual
Kappa Alpha/MDA Mud Volleyball
Classic. Your words mean a lot to
those of us who worked so hard to
bring about the event. Your positive
reinforcement encourages us to try
even harder next time around. Hope
fully it signals a trend toward more
coverage of the good news on campus.
Too often the occasional indiscretions
of fraternities or sororities overshadow
the positive contributions of Greeks.
Greek life, whether or not those out
side the system realize it, forms an
essential component of the Stanford

community. Not only do fraternities
actively enrich Stanford with public
service events like Mud Volleyball, but
also they passively contribute by devel
oping management and communication
skills in their individual members. This
is a fact. I know it because I've seen it
happen at KA.
Unfortunately, anti-Greek prejudice
keeps many people from appreciating
these qualities. I have heard a rumor
that some student groups declined to
participate in Mud Volleyball simply
because it was sponsored by a fraterni
ty. I think that such prejudice is as
shameful and ignorant as the other
forms of prejudice that grab headlines.
I am proud to have been a part of
something that provided so much fun
for so many people and that helped
such a great cause; moreover, I am
proud to be a KA.
