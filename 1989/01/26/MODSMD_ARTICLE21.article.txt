I am writing to invite Daily readers

Stanford officials to discuss the fate of
the cats on campus.
Representatives from Stanford's Op

fice of Public Affairs, as well as Crane
Pest Control and the Palo Alto
Humane Society will be present to
discuss Stanford's current policy
toward the cat overpopulation and the
available alternatives.
The meeting will be held tomarrow,
in the lounge of El Centro Chicano,

situation on campus, please attend.
