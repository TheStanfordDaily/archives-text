Stanford's diverse
curriculum ignores
South Asian region
Does Stanford University know that
South Asia exists? By South Asia, I
am referring to the countries India,
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka,
Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives.
Not a single course is offered in the
curriculum which focuses on the
region. The Asian Languages Depart
ment specifically explores the lan
guages, cultures and literatures of
China, Japan and Korea. It is assumed
that no other countries comprise the
vast continent of Asia.
The History and Political Science
Departments offer courses on most
regions of the world except South Asia
By excluding South Asia from the cur
riculum, Stanford is suggesting that
the region is not important enough to
merit scholarly consideration.
Perhaps some facts should be
reiterated at this point to clear up any
misconceptions. According to estimates
published by the World Bank, the pop
ulation of South Asia will increase to
about 1.33 billion by the year 2000,
meaning that more than one-fifth of
the world's people will live in South
Asia. On this basis alone, the region
cannot be disregarded.
Strategically, the region is also im
portant. Pakistan was an important
intermediary for Soviet withdrawal
from Afghanistan. Pakistan also forms
the eastern flank of the vital Middle
East with its oil riches. Significantly,

both the United States und the Soviet
Union have greatly increased naval
presence in the Indian Ocean in the
past two decades.
It is startling to consider that Stan
ford University, one of the foremost
liberal education supporters, should
deny its students an exposure to a
culturally, historically and politically
important region.
Other universities such as the Uni
versity of Chicago offer courses such as
South Asian Civilization as alternatives
to their western culture requirement.
Shouldn't Stanford try to live up to
the aim stated by its first president
David Starr Jordan "to give our stu
dents the priceless legacy of the ed
ucated man, the power of knowing
what really is"?
Reality dictates that South Asia
exists. I am sure that many Asians
and Asian Americans would join me in
entreating the University to try and
become aware of this reality as soon as
possible.

U.S. should push for
peace in the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict
The new Bush administration has
sent a disturbing signal that it intends
to give low priority to the Arab-Israeli
conflict. Secretary of State James
Baker told a Senate committee last
week that "we ought to be realistic
about the prospects for achieving a

break-through." But then he added,
"There has been no more intractable
foreign policy problem facing us for a
long time."
Why is the situation in Israel today
any more intractable, say, than the
Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, or
South Africa's control of Namibia?
Why should the United States, which
was founded on the principle that
"governments derive their just powers
from the consent of the governed,"
find it so difficult to take a clear posi
tion on Israel's continued rule by force
over nearly two million Palestinians?
The Palestinians, like the Jews, want
a homeland of their own and have
asked the U.S. government to press for
peaceful negotiations to acheive it.
Israel's Shamir government refuses to
negotiate with the Palestinians' recog
nized Jeaders and will not even con
sider a territorial compromise. Instead
it asserts its will through a policy of
"force, might, beatings." If the Bush
administration takes no action, calling
the situation "intractable," it will only
reinforce Israel's intransigence.
The need for a peaceful solution
becomes increasingly urgent. Every day
Israeli troops shoot to death one, two,
sometimes three Palestinians, many of
them under 14, some only three or
four years old. During the past year,
thousands of Palestinians, young and
old, have been shot, gassed or crippled
by beatings.
The unrelenting harshness of Israeli
actions indicate that the government's
intent is not to explore a peaceful solu
tion but to utterly crush the Palestin
ian independence movement and reduce
the Palestinians to subservience.
To that end, Defense Minister

Yitzhak Rabin has taken steps to
provoke confrontation, in order "to
show who will be stronger." He has
ordered troops to raid peaceful Pales
tinian villages "to remind residents
they [arel living under Israeli control."
The army has sent thousands of Pales
tinians to prison camps where they are
routinely beaten and tortured.
To make matters worse, the new
coalition government has agreed to
take Palestinian land for eight new
settlements this year. At the same
time, all charitable organizations have
been closed and moderate leaders im
prisoned without trial. On Jan. 20,
Israeli authorities closed all Palestinian
schools indefinitely.
But the Palestinians show no inten
tion of ending their protests, since
their dignity as human beings and
survival as a people are at stake. Many
Israelis recognize this and see the
futility of Israeli government policy.
The army chief of staff, General Dan
Shomron, recently said the army could
not put down the uprising, only a po
litical solution could end it.
A group of Israeli soldiers told Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir that their
orders to be "brutally violent to inno
cent people" in order to instill fear had
violated "the basic values we grew up
on." And last week an army unit in
Gaza refused to carry out orders to
assault Palestinians.
If Israeli soldiers can show such hu
manity and courage in protesting a
situation that can only grow more
violent and hopeless, the United States
should support their effort.
The Palestinians, through the Pales
tine National Council, have given up
their claims to all of historic Palestine

and offered to negotiate a settlement
that would guarantee security and na
tional independence to both peoples.
The new Bush administration, which
has promised a "kinder, gentler na
tion," could start by cutting funds for
the bullets and gas and truncheons the
Israeli government uses against Pales
tinian children. President Bush could
use Israeli's dependence on $4 billion a
year in U.S. aid to pressure the
Shamir government to enter serious
negotiations. Since a substantial num
ber of Israelis, as well as Palestinians,
have called for an end to the occupa
tion and for peaceful co-existence, the
problem of how to end the worsening
tragedy seems anything but intractable
