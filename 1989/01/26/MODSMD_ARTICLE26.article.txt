## Making a world of difference out of a tight squeeze 
### Jean Chen 
Squeezing into the Public Service Cen
ter has been unusually difficult lately.
With the upcoming "You Can Make a
Difference" conference, volunteers have
crammed into the small rear office that
houses the project, calling speakers and
arranging last-minute details.
For more than 130 volunteers from all
parts of the University, this weekend will
be the peak of a mountain that has taken
them many months to build.
Since last spring, visitors to the con
ference office would have seen students
busily putting the pieces of the conference

in place, contacting principal players and
luminaries for each of the different "case
sessions," and deciding whifch topics to
cover in these single-issue seminars.
The conference, titled "Deciding our
Environmental Future," continues this
weekend, launching into high gear with
opening remarks by University President
Donald Kennedy on Saturday at 9 a m.
in Kresge Auditorium.
In the Public Service Center," amidst
water conservation fliers splashed across
the walls, a continuously changing hand
ful of people have been working steadily
for month When the secluded office he
comes too crowded, students spill through
the front door of Owen House onto the
steps to tackle their logistical jumbles
outside.
Helping with the conference are a wide
variety of people from all schools and all
classes in Stanford. Volunteer Karen Van
Nuys, a Ph.D. student in economics, sits
on the porch and squints to avoid the
sun as she describes her participation.
She worked on the case session focus
ing on hazardous waste trade with the
Third World. "As a grad student, it's very
easy to become very deep and very fo
cused," she says. "This conference
broaflened my exposure to issues and to
a treinerldous group of people."
In the bustling cubicle indoors, people
like Van Nuys drift in, settle the details
of their particular case sessions, and drift

out again, but there are a few people
who always remain.
The three co-directors of the confer
ence, Julie Bunn, Greg Cumberford and
Smita Singh have set aside a huge part
of their lives to run the event.
They are three different people, .with
three different perspectives.
Finding the action
Bunn, a Ph.D. candidate in economics,
also wanted a change from rigorous grad
uate school. "Having been a graduate stu
dent for five years, I wanted to demon
strate that I had other abilities," she says.
Focusing on the environment was easy
for her, since Bunn says she has always
been interested in agricultural issues. In
graduate school, she says she "missed the
action side."
According to Bunn, the conference is
very timely. She says, "We are at a crucial
point where all our academic interests
can revolve around environmental is
sues."
Recently, the popular media, including
Time magazine and National Geographic,
have spotlighted our environmental di
lemma, and interest in global ecological
health has spread, according to Bunn.
"This has been viewed as a white,
upper-middle class movement," she says.
She emphasizes that environmental is
sues including toxics now concern urban
community development as much as they
concern the wilderness.
"We need to take an about face and
change our attitudes," says Bunn. From
an economic and cultural standpoint, she
says it is inconvenient for individuals to
act in a very environmentally conscious
way. Styrofoam and disposables are too
easy.
In light of this, Bunn wants Stanford
to be "on the forefront" of changing
people's attitudes by offering "basic train
ing in environmental problems" along
with other general academic require
ments.
Dose of practical aesthetics
In contrast to Bunn's perspective
framed by issues of economic and social
responsibility, Cumberford has a more
holistic view of the world.
He draws a parallel between the envi
ronment's sickness and that of a human
being. "So many people seem sick, ex
hausted, accepting disease" as part of
their lives, he says, comparing this ac
ceptance to our lagging environmental
standards. He likens our current remedies
to world problems to "taking a Dristan."
Cumberford, who is a junior transfer
student in environmental earth science,
lived at Synergy House last year, and
loved the "co-operative ethic."

In person, it is easy to imagine Cum
berford far away from the pavement of
a suburban campus, especially as he
draws attention to the absence of greens
and the sterile pale 9 of the new Rains
housing complex.
Before coming to Stanford. Cumber
ford sailed from Florida to Tahiti, study
ing "farming practices in different island
communities," including those in the
Galapagos, those near Panama and in
the Polynesian Islands.
"You learn lessons from people who
normally live under limited availability
of pesticides and food," he says.
Besides the cultivation of land, Cum
berford also dabbles in better ways of
building on it. He has a flair for solar
design, solar architecture, organic farm
ing, use of natural resources and ecologi
cal design.
"Most people want the usual hedges,
lawn . . . but it is possible to merge aes
thetic and practical needs," he says, citing
the use of trees as windblocks and shade.
Despite an approach different from
Bunn's, Cumberford echoes the appeal

for a reformed treatment of the planet.
He says, the global community must in
stitute a "fundamental change in how we
consume our resources."
Learning by doing
Following yet another visit td a house
meeting, the third co-directAr, Smita
Singh, appeared energetic and showed no
sign of wear after months of promoting
and organizing the conference.
A junior in public policy, with a focus
on developing countries, Singh's confer
ence work well complements her specialty.
Before her involvement with tne con
ference, she had concentrated mostly on
social issues, particularly the welfare of
women in India. But she emphasizes the
wide embrace of the conference, and the
inclusive nature of environmental studies
that draws all interested and willing
people into the effort.
"Before I did this conference, I
wouldn't have called myself knowledge
able about environmental issues."
Now, she heads a huge task force with
a diversity that surprises her.

Wonting together is one of the main
themes of this conference. "It's a confer
ence about how people can get involved,"
she emphasizes.
And the conference itself is a model of
this involvement and dedication. Kate
Morris, a graduate student in computer
scicnce, is coordinating registration.
Coming from Australia, Morris already
knows about "growing up in a dry part
of the world," and says she is "pretty
aware of not wasting things."
Senior Eric Jorgensen, a human biology
major, is focusing on cultural and ecologi
cal studies of humans and their environ
ment. He is in charge of publicity. "It's
so clear that we don't have to" use up
our resources, he says.
"Once you're committed to something,
your ears perk up when you hear about
[it]. You get involved," he says.
Many different people are involved in
this weekend jqoqference, apd there are
just as many different sets of incentives
and philosophies. But all agree that large
scale individual participation is necessary
for change.

The "You Can Make A Difference" staff brings months of floating papers, computer files and telephone calls to a successful close
this Saturday when the environmental conference begins. Tightly-packed planners (left to right) Greg Cumberford, Julie Bunn, Eric
Jorgensen, Kendell Andrews, Sally Kauffmann, Jack Barbash and Dean Eyre are hoping for the best.
