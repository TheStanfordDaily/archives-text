# Proving diamonds are a tool's best friend

Midas would have loved this.
Gold would have paled next to
the glitter of the diamonds he
might have created with the new
technology of diamond films now
researched at Stanford.
Of course, creating gemstones
for personal adornment is not the

technology under study at Stan
ford.
The "diamond" that is grown
is not the gemstone but a film
composed of many little crystals.
These films can be grown to cover
up to 100 square centimeters but
are very thin.
It is this quality that will make
them useful. The diamond film
may actually be used as a coating
to protect real gems, according to
Darin Olsen, a graduate student
in material science and engineer
ing.
In fact, diamond films would
be a desirable coating for many
more mundane surfaces as well.
The edges of die-cutting tools and
surgical scalpels rank high on the
list of applications for the un
usually hard film.

In both of these applications,
the film would serve as a cutting
edge that will stay very sharp.
In addition to hardness, these
sheets of diamond crystals have
several other properties which
promise to make them an impor
tant tool for many applications.
Tool and die bits, used for man
ufacturing small tools and mac
hines, could be made weld
resistant because of the low fric
tion properties of diamond. Wel
ding occurs when the bit bonds
with the workpiece because of
heat build-up.
This is a significant source of
wear and tear on the tools. The
diamond "chips" currently used
as sharp ends of these tools are
dislodged when welding occurs.
A diamond film coating would
potentially eliminate both these

problems. It would be slick
enough to resist welding and
would adhere better than dia
mond chips.
Because of this, diamond film
coated tools would have a sub
stantially longer life expectancy.
In pursuit of another use for
the new technology, Silicon Valley
companies interested in micro
chip design and manufacture will
be well represented amdng the an
ticipated international partici
pants of the material science and
engineering department's Dia
mond Films Short Course Feb. 1.
The application of diamond film
technology to chip design is
eagerly anticipated as a way to
make possible the manufacture of
smaller chips.
Likewise, representatives from
the National Institutes of Health
will be present Wednesday to eval
uate the potential for the film's
use on surgical instruments.
Now, chip size is constrained
by the problem of heat buildup
in micro-circuitry. Chips coated
with diamond film would be su
perior to today's silicon coated
chips, because diamond conducts
heat better than silicon, thus re
ducing heat build-up.
There are "millions of things
that it would be nice to coat with
diamond film," according to Ol
sen. Possibilities include plastic
windows, watch crystals and
cooking surfaces.
Before diamond films can be
widely used, however, ways to
grow them reliably need to be de
veloped.

Diamond is grown on a sub
strate material serving as a base
for the crystals, liquid nickel for
example, in a gas-filled chamber.
Researchers start with a mixture
of about 1 percent gaseous met
hane and 99 percent hydrogen in
the chamber.
The gas is exposed to a plasma
such as a flourescent light which
causes radical, chemical reactions
in the gas, according to Olsen,
that generate the crystals.
It is still not clear, however,
which constituents of the gas play
the key roles in the formation of
diamond, thus efficient produc
tion is still elusive.
Current research efforts to de
termine the proper mixture of
gases seek to increase the effi
ciency of the process by determin
ing the exact chemical require
ments necessary to eliminate was
teage of the gases.
They are also seeking to in
crease the reliability of the proc
ess, with the intent to achieve
diamond formation on the sub
strate 100 percent of the time.
According to Olsen, one early
research problem was the forma
tion of diamond-like carbon.
Having overcome that difficulty,
they are working to create dia
mond films with a smooth sur
face. Now, Olsen said, "You tend
to end up with a lumpy film."
The current goal for producing
more useful diamond films is "to
get high quality films and high
growth rates" in the same process,
according to Paul Dennig, a grad
uate student in materials science

and engineering. He said that
usually a high growth rate means
a lower quality film.
Stanford researchers in the de
partments of Material Science and
Engineering, Mechanical Engi
neering and Electrical Engineer
ing — with the collaboration of
the Stanford Synchrotron Radia
tion Laboratory, are at work on
the task of optimizing the process
that forms diamond films.
The MSE department's "Dia
mond Day" is a day-long work
shop, divided into morning
tutorial presentations and after
noon research presentations.
The morning sessions will
review the fundamental knowl
edge of diamond films, their
qualities, surface properties and
applications.
After gearing up in the morn
ing, the afternoon will be devoted
to discussing the newest elements
of diamond film research.
Speakers have been drawn from
both academia and industry to
facilitate the important interac
tion between the two communi
ties, according to workshop
organizers.
Anyone interested in participat
ing in the workshop can receive
more information by calling the
MSE department at 723-2534.

Midas would have loved this.
Gold would have paled next to
the glitter of the diamonds he
might have created with the new
technology of diamond films now
researched at Stanford.
Of course, creating gemstones
for personal adornment is not the

technology under study at Stan
ford.
The "diamond" that is grown
is not the gemstone but a film
composed of many little crystals.
These films can be grown to cover
up to 100 square centimeters but
are very thin.
It is this quality that will make
them useful. The diamond film
may actually be used as a coating
to protect real gems, according to
Darin Olsen, a graduate student
in material science and engineer
ing.
In fact, diamond films would
be a desirable coating for many
more mundane surfaces as well.
The edges of die-cutting tools and
surgical scalpels rank high on the
list of applications for the un
usually hard film.

In both of these applications,
the film would serve as a cutting
edge that will stay very sharp.
In addition to hardness, these
sheets of diamond crystals have
several other properties which
promise to make them an impor
tant tool for many applications.
Tool and die bits, used for man
ufacturing small tools and mac
hines, could be made weld
resistant because of the low fric
tion properties of diamond. Wel
ding occurs when the bit bonds
with the workpiece because of
heat build-up.
This is a significant source of
wear and tear on the tools. The
diamond "chips" currently used
as sharp ends of these tools are
dislodged when welding occurs.
A diamond film coating would
potentially eliminate both these

problems. It would be slick
enough to resist welding and
would adhere better than dia
mond chips.
Because of this, diamond film
coated tools would have a sub
stantially longer life expectancy.
In pursuit of another use for
the new technology, Silicon Valley
companies interested in micro
chip design and manufacture will
be well represented amdng the an
ticipated international partici
pants of the material science and
engineering department's Dia
mond Films Short Course Feb. 1.
The application of diamond film
technology to chip design is
eagerly anticipated as a way to
make possible the manufacture of
smaller chips.
Likewise, representatives from
the National Institutes of Health
will be present Wednesday to eval
uate the potential for the film's
use on surgical instruments.
Now, chip size is constrained
by the problem of heat buildup
in micro-circuitry. Chips coated
with diamond film would be su
perior to today's silicon coated
chips, because diamond conducts
heat better than silicon, thus re
ducing heat build-up.
There are "millions of things
that it would be nice to coat with
diamond film," according to Ol
sen. Possibilities include plastic
windows, watch crystals and
cooking surfaces.
Before diamond films can be
widely used, however, ways to
grow them reliably need to be de
veloped.

Diamond is grown on a sub
strate material serving as a base
for the crystals, liquid nickel for
example, in a gas-filled chamber.
Researchers start with a mixture
of about 1 percent gaseous met
hane and 99 percent hydrogen in
the chamber.
The gas is exposed to a plasma
such as a flourescent light which
causes radical, chemical reactions
in the gas, according to Olsen,
that generate the crystals.
It is still not clear, however,
which constituents of the gas play
the key roles in the formation of
diamond, thus efficient produc
tion is still elusive.
Current research efforts to de
termine the proper mixture of
gases seek to increase the effi
ciency of the process by determin
ing the exact chemical require
ments necessary to eliminate was
teage of the gases.
They are also seeking to in
crease the reliability of the proc
ess, with the intent to achieve
diamond formation on the sub
strate 100 percent of the time.
According to Olsen, one early
research problem was the forma
tion of diamond-like carbon.
Having overcome that difficulty,
they are working to create dia
mond films with a smooth sur
face. Now, Olsen said, "You tend
to end up with a lumpy film."
The current goal for producing
more useful diamond films is "to
get high quality films and high
growth rates" in the same process,
according to Paul Dennig, a grad
uate student in materials science

and engineering. He said that
usually a high growth rate means
a lower quality film.
