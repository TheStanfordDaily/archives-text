Cultures from the End of the

Helen Horowitz is angry.
As a college professor, she
deplores the pre-professional atti
tudes of her undergraduates. She
bemoans their grim acceptance of
grade-grubbing and their defer
ment of pleasure to some dim fu
ture beyond graduate or pro
fessional school.
"The fear of economic and so
cial erosion, of not being able to
reproduce the comfortable world
of one's parents, dominates un
dergraduate consciousness,"
writes Horowitz. "In this at
mosophere, education is largely
being reduced to the quest for
grades. . . . Undergraduates fail to
follow individual interests that
might lead them to find true voca
tions or to develop autonomy from
parental standards."
"Campus Life" explains why
students seem to embody this
dour profile. It does so with the
hopes of launching them towards
a better and more independent fu
ture.
Horowitz's unique and useful
contribution to our understanding
of the American college experience
is her creation of a typology of
undergraduates. Like all general
portraits, the three character
types Horowitz describes lack the
sharpness that distinguishes indi
viduals from one another. Still,
they are in general so true-to-life
that the reader will immediately
be able to identify people in each
category.
Horowitz calls her first student
type "college men and women." It
is her name for the mainstream,
"rah-rah" student culture.
Primarily organized into Greek
letter societies after the mid-19th
century, collegiate life for these
students revolved around athle
tics, publications, student govern
ment and other positions in the

extracurriculum. According to
Horowitz, this elite group defined
its values and norms against the
faculty-defined values of cur
ricular studies. For college men
and women, success depended on
whom you knew, not what you
knew, on style in dress and man
ners, not on grades. A "Gentle
ment's C" was a respectable mark.

Horowitz creates a
typology consist
ing of three under
graduate 'types' in
order to under
stand and analyze
the history of stu
dent culture.

As college men and women
pitted themselves against the fac
ulty in creating a powerful un
dergraduate value system, the
"outsiders," Horowitz' second un
dergraduate group, looked to their
education for upward social
mobility. Grades were important
to these often poor and sometimes
immigrant students. Their profes
sional careers depended on the
knowledge transmitted through
the curriculum and support from
the faculty gatekeepers to the pro
fessions.
Some outsiders consciously
rejected their position, especially
those who, for reasons of religious
or class discrimination, found this
role thrust upon them. They
rebelled and produced their own
"alternative" student culture.
Horowitz calls this group
"rebels." Bolstered by ties with
the emerging political and artistic
movements of the 20th century,
rebel student institutions rivaled
mainstream activities and pro
vided a vital critique drawn from
a perspective beyond the campus.

After describing these
categories of undergraduates,
Horowitz discusses "Stover at
Yale," a popular 1912 novel
depicting turn-of-the-century col
lege life. In the novel, Dink
Stover's search to answer the pe
rennial undergraduate question
"Where do I fit?" leads to a con
scious examination of the mean
ing of life as played out on the
football field and in the political
arena.
Horowitz uses Stover and his
ambiguous self-discoveries to in
troduce the fact that the power
relations among the three
typological groups on college cam
puses continuously adjust —
sometimes with the help of college
administrators.
For example, Horowitz des
cribes how administrative efforts
to "create a more genuine schol
arly environment" among the col
legians at Columbia University in
the 1910s and Harvard University
in the 1920s had the effect of
limiting the number of outsiders
admitted to the university. Out
siders in that period meant Jews.
In another case, the intellectual
emerged as "campus hero" at
Swarthmore College over a period
of 20 years when the college pres
ident pursued policies to reward
academic honors and discourage
Greek life.
According to Horowitz, strong
individuals in administrative po
sitions, as well as students them
selves, profoundly influence the
character of undergraduate life —
they in part determine which
"group" becomes dominant on
campus.
Horowitz concludes that in the
19705, undergraduate culture wit
nessed the triumph of the out
sider as the dominant under
graduate type — with an impor
tant difference from past genera
tions. Horowitz emphasizes that
economic conditions placed
children from prosperous and
poor families on equal footing, all
competing for financial success in

uncertain times.
In her final chapter, Horowitz
portrays informal discussions
among students in the 1980s. She
describes the existence of a new
group of rebels — students who,
for individual motives, question
the predominant outsider student
culture and face the challenge of
creating a meaningful life in col
lege and beyond. Horowitz pins
her hopes for the future on the
small acts of rebellion of this
group. One such undergraduate,
she writes, "spoke with pride of
her decision to take a course that
mattered to her even though she
anticipated a low grade."

Throughout the book, Horowitz
draws upon archival photographs
to show Stanford student life —
undergraduates leading cheers for
the football team in 1897, posing
for a drama in 1912, conducting
laboratory experiments in the
early 1900s. She assumes Stan
ford to be traditionally a "col
legiate culture," and she refers to
a Daily article calling for extend
ing library hours in the 1970s as
well as a photograph of a student
"dressed for success" to illustrate
that outsiders are now drawn
from formerly "collegiate" groups.
But is Stanford today dom
inated by the "new" outsiders?

Are the rebels' questioning atti
tudes making headway?
As members of the Stanford
community on the brink of the
19905, we owe it to ourselves to
read Horowitz's book and decide.
For while "Campus Life" may or
may not point the way to the fu
ture, it effectively mines the past
to create a context for understand •
ing whatever change may be on
the horizon for students across
the country.

"group" becomes dominant on
campus.
Horowitz concludes that in the
19705, undergraduate culture wit
nessed the triumph of the out
sider as the dominant under
graduate type — with an impor
tant difference from past genera
tions. Horowitz emphasizes that
economic conditions placed
children from prosperous and
poor families on equal footing, all
competing for financial success in

uncertain times.
In her final chapter, Horowitz
portrays informal discussions
among students in the 1980s. She
describes the existence of a new
group of rebels — students who,
for individual motives, question
the predominant outsider student
culture and face the challenge of
creating a meaningful life in col
lege and beyond. Horowitz pins
her hopes for the future on the
small acts of rebellion of this
group. One such undergraduate,
she writes, "spoke with pride of
her decision to take a course that
mattered to her even though she
anticipated a low grade."

Throughout the book, Horowitz
draws upon archival photographs
to show Stanford student life —
undergraduates leading cheers for
the football team in 1897, posing
for a drama in 1912, conducting
laboratory experiments in the
early 1900s. She assumes Stan
ford to be traditionally a "col
legiate culture," and she refers to
a Daily article calling for extend
ing library hours in the 1970s as
well as a photograph of a student
"dressed for success" to illustrate
that outsiders are now drawn
from formerly "collegiate" groups.
But is Stanford today dom
inated by the "new" outsiders?

Are the rebels' questioning atti
tudes making headway?
As members of the Stanford
community on the brink of the
19905, we owe it to ourselves to
read Horowitz's book and decide.
For while "Campus Life" may or
may not point the way to the fu
ture, it effectively mines the past
to create a context for understand •
ing whatever change may be on
the horizon for students across
the country.

"Campus Life: Undergraduate
Cultures from the End of the
Eighteenth Century"

Helen Horowitz is angry.
As a college professor, she
deplores the pre-professional atti
tudes of her undergraduates. She
bemoans their grim acceptance of
grade-grubbing and their defer
ment of pleasure to some dim fu
ture beyond graduate or pro
fessional school.
"The fear of economic and so
cial erosion, of not being able to
reproduce the comfortable world
of one's parents, dominates un
dergraduate consciousness,"
writes Horowitz. "In this at
mosophere, education is largely
being reduced to the quest for
grades. . . . Undergraduates fail to
follow individual interests that
might lead them to find true voca
tions or to develop autonomy from
parental standards."
"Campus Life" explains why
students seem to embody this
dour profile. It does so with the
hopes of launching them towards
a better and more independent fu
ture.
Horowitz's unique and useful
contribution to our understanding
of the American college experience
is her creation of a typology of
undergraduates. Like all general
portraits, the three character
types Horowitz describes lack the
sharpness that distinguishes indi
viduals from one another. Still,
they are in general so true-to-life
that the reader will immediately
be able to identify people in each
category.
Horowitz calls her first student
type "college men and women." It
is her name for the mainstream,
"rah-rah" student culture.
Primarily organized into Greek
letter societies after the mid-19th
century, collegiate life for these
students revolved around athle
tics, publications, student govern
ment and other positions in the

extracurriculum. According to
Horowitz, this elite group defined
its values and norms against the
faculty-defined values of cur
ricular studies. For college men
and women, success depended on
whom you knew, not what you
knew, on style in dress and man
ners, not on grades. A "Gentle
ment's C" was a respectable mark.

Horowitz creates a
typology consist
ing of three under
graduate 'types' in
order to under
stand and analyze
the history of stu
dent culture.

As college men and women
pitted themselves against the fac
ulty in creating a powerful un
dergraduate value system, the
"outsiders," Horowitz' second un
dergraduate group, looked to their
education for upward social
mobility. Grades were important
to these often poor and sometimes
immigrant students. Their profes
sional careers depended on the
knowledge transmitted through
the curriculum and support from
the faculty gatekeepers to the pro
fessions.
Some outsiders consciously
rejected their position, especially
those who, for reasons of religious
or class discrimination, found this
role thrust upon them. They
rebelled and produced their own
"alternative" student culture.
Horowitz calls this group
"rebels." Bolstered by ties with
the emerging political and artistic
movements of the 20th century,
rebel student institutions rivaled
mainstream activities and pro
vided a vital critique drawn from
a perspective beyond the campus.

After describing these
categories of undergraduates,
Horowitz discusses "Stover at
Yale," a popular 1912 novel
depicting turn-of-the-century col
lege life. In the novel, Dink
Stover's search to answer the pe
rennial undergraduate question
"Where do I fit?" leads to a con
scious examination of the mean
ing of life as played out on the
football field and in the political
arena.
Horowitz uses Stover and his
ambiguous self-discoveries to in
troduce the fact that the power
relations among the three
typological groups on college cam
puses continuously adjust —
sometimes with the help of college
administrators.
For example, Horowitz des
cribes how administrative efforts
to "create a more genuine schol
arly environment" among the col
legians at Columbia University in
the 1910s and Harvard University
in the 1920s had the effect of
limiting the number of outsiders
admitted to the university. Out
siders in that period meant Jews.
In another case, the intellectual
emerged as "campus hero" at
Swarthmore College over a period
of 20 years when the college pres
ident pursued policies to reward
academic honors and discourage
Greek life.
According to Horowitz, strong
individuals in administrative po
sitions, as well as students them
selves, profoundly influence the
character of undergraduate life —
they in part determine which
"group" becomes dominant on
campus.
