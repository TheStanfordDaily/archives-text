# IFC creates judiciary board
## New body set to talk about flap over Sigma Chi flier 
### DJ Berinstein Staff writer 
The Interfraternity Council voted last night to
implement a judicial board that will replace the
University's role of taking initial disciplinary action
against fraternities accused of misconduct.
While the University will still have authority to
investigate any decisions it deems unjust, Fraternal
Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano said he "would accept
any recommendation [the board would make] unless
there was flawed reasoning."
In the past, the Office of Fraternal Affairs handled
any problems that arose because of fraternity vio
lations.
In an amendment to its 18-year-old constitution,
the IFC voted for the judicial board which will be
separate from the IFC Executive Committee, but
the two governing bodies will work together in a
system of checks and balances.
Four top officers in the IFC make up the executive
committee.
Representatives from three housed and two un
housed fraternities will sit on the judicial board.
Under the new system, the executive committee
will decide, within 24 hours of any infraction,

whether to go directly to the fra
ternity implicated in a problem, or
to go to the judicial board, which
will then take over the investigative
process.
Any decisions made by the board
will be sent back for approval to the
executive committee, which will also
hear appeals.
The fledgling board will test its
new powers today in a meeting to

decide the fate of the Sigma Chi Fraternity, which
Pisano said violated University policy by distributing
a party flier focusing on alcohol.
To prepare them for their work, the IFC has
passed a number of "recommended sanctions," the
minimum actions the board can take in response
to violations by fraternities.
In the event the University disagrees with a board
decision, Pisano said he would feel free to question
the board about its decision.
At that point, the University "will then look for
common ground. We want to work in tandem [with
the board 1 ... we want the board to be a solid one


Erlin
and to be authoritative," Pisano
said.
While Pisano cautioned that the
University "would feel compelled
to act independently of a bad de
cision," he added that, "We are
behind the group, and we know
a lot of thought has gone into the
decisions. There is great recep
tivity on behalf of Dean (of Stu
dent Affairs James) Lyon, Dean
(Diana) Conklin and myself."
"But the University will func
tion independently and will act as
an observer," he stressed. Pisano
urged the board to be strong in
representing the system, adding
that he hoped the University
would have a "99 if not 100 per

cent" acceptance rate of their de
cisions.
"Only in extreme cases will the
University take action. Both the
University and the IFC have to
act in good faith," Pisano said.
Last night's meeting was
rushed along in order to allow the
board to quickly rule on the fate
of the Sigma Chis.
IFC president Chris Erlin said
he wants to use the Sigma Chi
violation as a "test case" for the
judicial board. Erlin added that
he recognizes the need for the
board to build credibility by ruling
in the case and acknowledged "the
pressure under the gun."
"But the creation of the board
has been in the works for 11
weeks now," he said, stressing
that the board was not created
only in response to the Sigma Chi
violation.
