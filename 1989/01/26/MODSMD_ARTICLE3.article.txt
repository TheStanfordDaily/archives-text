# IFC creates judiciary board
## New body set to talk about flap over Sigma Chi flier 
### DJ Berinstein Staff writer 
The Interfraternity Council voted last night to
implement a judicial board that will replace the
University's role of taking initial disciplinary action
against fraternities accused of misconduct.
While the University will still have authority to
investigate any decisions it deems unjust, Fraternal
Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano said he "would accept
any recommendation [the board would make] unless
there was flawed reasoning."
In the past, the Office of Fraternal Affairs handled
any problems that arose because of fraternity vio
lations.
In an amendment to its 18-year-old constitution,
the IFC voted for the judicial board which will be
separate from the IFC Executive Committee, but
the two governing bodies will work together in a
system of checks and balances.
Four top officers in the IFC make up the executive
committee.
Representatives from three housed and two un
housed fraternities will sit on the judicial board.
Under the new system, the executive committee
will decide, within 24 hours of any infraction,

whether to go directly to the fra
ternity implicated in a problem, or
to go to the judicial board, which
will then take over the investigative
process.
Any decisions made by the board
will be sent back for approval to the
executive committee, which will also
hear appeals.
The fledgling board will test its
new powers today in a meeting to

decide the fate of the Sigma Chi Fraternity, which
Pisano said violated University policy by distributing
a party flier focusing on alcohol.
To prepare them for their work, the IFC has
passed a number of "recommended sanctions," the
minimum actions the board can take in response
to violations by fraternities.
In the event the University disagrees with a board
decision, Pisano said he would feel free to question
the board about its decision.
At that point, the University "will then look for
common ground. We want to work in tandem [with
the board 1 ... we want the board to be a solid one
