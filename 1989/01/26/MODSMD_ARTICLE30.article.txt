## 'Nice guy' Wright leads Cardinal against Ducks 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Leo Durocher once said, "Nice
guys finish last." Obviously he
didn't know Howard Wright.
Stanford's 6-foot-8 power for
ward, who Coach Mike Mont
gomery calls "one of the all-time
nice guys," has been doing any
thing but finishing last in his ten
ure at Stanford.
As a matter of fact, it has been
Wright and his five senior team
mates — most notably Todd
Lichti — who have brought Stan
ford basketball into a new era of
excellence and put the team on
the brink of its first NCAA Tour
nament berth since 1942.
That's not to say it's been easy
for Wright, however. When he
came out of Patrick Henry High
School in San Diego much was
expected of him. Many looked at
Wright's tall, athletic body and
"maybe expected more than he
was ready to produce (at the
time)," Montgomery says.
Wright was aware of the expec
tations but was fortunate that
then-Coach Tom Davis, who is
now at lowa, wasn't one of those
demanding instant miracles.
Wright remembers Davis telling
him, "I don't think you're great,
but I think think you could be
great."
At times, slapping the label
"POTENTIAL" on someone — as
Davis did to Wright with that
remark — is a curse that lasts
forever. In Wright's case, how
ever, he took it upon himself to
live up to that challenge. The
results speak for themselves.
As a freshman, Wright averaged
9.7 points per game on 46.3 per
cent shooting from the field. He
pulled down 6.3 rebounds per
game as well.
While the numbers were better
in Wright's sophomore year, the
breakthrough didn't come. "I may
have been shackled by my own
potential," Wright notes.
Last year, the breakthrough
most certainly did come. "Some
thing clicked junior year in terms
of confidence," Wright says,
noting he stopped letting what
others said affect his play.
He came out of the gate hard
and fast, and kept on going. On
the season, Wright scored 15.7
per game, grabbed 7.7 boards and
shot a stellar 62.2 percent from
the field. He was made a first
team all-conference selection for
his efforts.
Wright received enough atten
tion to earn an invitation to the

Olympic Trials. While he was
among the early cuts, Wright
wasn't disappointed. "I knew
realistically, the best I could do
was impress the scouts and play
hard."
And that he did. So much so
.that playing in the NBA may be
in Wright's not-so-distant future.
"He's one of the better players
(in college)," says NBA superscout
Marty Blake. "Somebody's going
to give him a chance."
Though less than 60 players will
be drafted, Blake anticipates
Wright will be among them. Blake
will showcase Wright in one of
his postseason camps, where pros
such as Charles Oakley and
Scottie Pippen went from being
unknowns to high draft choices.
What does Wright think about
all this talk? "I think I can make
an (NBA) team," he says."I look
up and down at some of the
players on the bench — and even
some of those who are getting con
sistent minutes — and I know I
can play at least as well."
A factor in Wright's ability to
take his game to the next level is
former Stanford Asst. Coach, and
NBA standout, Kermit Washing
ton. Wright has kept in touch with
Washington and says "He's
taught me not to worry about
numbers and stats.
"He said the pros look at the
way you play ... your team atti
tude," Wright adds. They are
looking for "complete players."

And, even though Stanford fans
may see Wright as exclusively a
low-post player, it's more Mont
gomery's offense than anything
else that gives that impression.
When Davis was here, Wright
thought he might be switched to
the three-man, or small forward,
position. But Davis left after
Wright's freshman year and any
notions Wright had of playing out
side went with him.
Still, Wright isn't upset with
Montgomery for keeping him pri
marily on the inside. "He may
have helped me get to the position
I'm in now," he says. "There are
a lot of shooters out there, but
not many rebounders and good
defenders."
His teammates, however, are
confident in Wright's ability to
excel at all aspects of the game.
"Here, he's asked to post up a
lot," says Lichti. "Howard is very
good in the open court. He doesn't
get a chance to show the things
he can do."
Forward Bryan McSweeney
echoes a similar note, saying that
when the team plays pick-up
games Wright is comfortable
taking the jumper from 15 to 18
feet out.
Wright say 3 he spent much of
the summer working on extending
his shooting range. He continues
to work on rounding out at his
game and says he is "keeping my

Forward Howard Wright has been quite the force inside for the Cardinal this season.
