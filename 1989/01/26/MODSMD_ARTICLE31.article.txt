# Oregon at Stanford
## 
### 
TONIGHT - Radio: K2SU (90.1 FM), KCBS (740 AM). 7:30 p.m. tipoff at
Maples Pavilion.
RECORDS - Stanford (14-4, 6-2 and 2nd in Pac-10 play), Oregon (7-9,
2-4 and Bth in the Pac-10).
INJURIES - None.
SERIES — Stanford has won two straight, Oregon has won eight of last
12. Last meeting: Stanford eliminated Oregon from the Pac-10 tournament
March 11, 1988, 88-67.
DUCK UPDATE -Oregon split at home last week, whipping slumping
Washington State 67-49 before being edged by improving Washington,
71-70. The Webfoots have not shot 50 percent from the field in their last
nine games. Guard Frank Johnson leads Oregon at 17.1 ppg and leads
all Pac-10 guards with 5.2 rpg. Brent Coffey leads the Ducks in boards
with 6.4 per game, and Randy Grant also contributes 15.2 ppg and 5.6
rpg.
CARDINAL UPDATE - Stanford, ranked 19th by Associated Press and 18th
by United Press International, has won nine of its last 10 games and 13
of its last 15, and is 8-0 at home this season. Adam Keefe has shot
85.3 percent (29-for-34) over his last nine games. Todd Lichti has fallen
out of the top spot among Pac-10 scoring leaders; he's now at 20.7 ppg.
Terry Taylor has only 21 turnovers in 18 games this year.
KEYS TO VICTORY - According to Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery, the
Cardinal needs to display patience and get good shots against the
multiple defenses Oregon will throw at them. Stanford also needs to
defend well against the Ducks' key scorers: Johnson and Grant. And
though Stanford is experienced enough to know not to look past this
game toward Sunday's match against Arizona, the Cardinal needs to
keep up the fire in a game that is not likely to be emotional.
