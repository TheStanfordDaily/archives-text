# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Ending weeks of domination by the bas
ketball squads, the finalists in this week's
bouts are from other venues.
On the men's side, one athlete clearly ran
faster, jumped higher and outshone the rest.
On the women's side, it wasn't so easy.
Our protagonists went at it for 15 rounds.
They bobbed, they weaved, they pulled no
punches.
And, when all was said and done, there
was no clear winner — it was a split decision
from the judges.
Without further ado, The Daily awards
its prestigious Athletes of the Week Awards
to volleyball's Dan Hanan, swimming's
Aimee Berzins and diving's Katie Connors.
Berzins, a 5-foot-11 senior sprint free
styler from Fountain Valley, Calif., set a
deGuerre pool record, captured three events
and swam on four winning relay teams in
Stanford's big dual-meet wins over UCLA
and USC.
Friday, against UCLA, Berzins won the
100-yard freestyle in an NCAA qualifying
time of 50.69 seconds. She also finished
third in the 200 freestyle, anchored the win
ning 200 medley relay team and swam the
first leg on the winning 200 free relay team.
The next day, facing the USC Trojans,
Berzins set a deGuerre pool record by clock
ing a 23.27 to win the 50 freestyle, also an

NCAA qualifying time. She also repeated in
the 100 freestyle, clocking a 50.46 and
anchored the victorious 400 freestyle and
400 medley relays.
Connors, a 5-2 junior from Davis, Calif.,
set a school record and won three of four
events she competed in.
Friday, Connors scored a 7.5 and an 8.0
on the final dive of the one-meter diving to
defeat UCLA's Britt Williams and Karla
Goltman. Connors then took second to Wil
liams in the three-meter, but handily
defeated Goltman, a two-time All-America.
Saturday, Connors easily won the one
meter, leading a Cardinal sweep, then re
corded a school-record 311.74 points in win
ning the three-meter competition by nearly
50 points.

Hanan, a 6-5 junior middle blocker from
Huntington Beach, Calif., led the Cardinal
spikers to victory in the team's Western
Intercollegiate Volleyball Association opener.
The Cardinal, ranked sixth nationally,
defeated 12th-ranked Loyola Marymount
15-11, 16-14, 15-17, 15-4 in Maples Pavilion
Saturday night.
Hanan had an amazing 40 kills to lead
the Cardinal to victory. He is the first Stan

ford player to reach the 40-kill plateau since
current U.S. Olympic team member Chris
Braun had 49 in 1986.
Hanan hit at a .524 clip, had four assists,
one service ace, 10 digs and a match-high
eight total blocks.
The Cardinal is now 4-2 on the season
and hosts top-ranked Hawaii at Maples Pa
vilion both Monday and Tuesday nights at
7:30 p.m.

Editor's note: For those of you who've
been wondering, the following is a basic
rundown of how we go about selecting our
Athletes of the Week.
Here's how it works in a typical week: On
Monday (or Tuesday, or whenever), one of
the Spectacular Seven (Shark, Mack, Rogo,
Shifty, Crades, Evan or Port) suggests two
names. We talk it out, argue occasionally
and then everyone says "Hey, fine with me."
Some weeks (such as this one) we have huge,
earth-shattering battles that no one wins,
and we end up with a tie.

the Cardinal to victory. He is the first Stan

ford player to reach the 40-kill plateau since
current U.S. Olympic team member Chris
Braun had 49 in 1986.
Hanan hit at a .524 clip, had four assists,
one service ace, 10 digs and a match-high
eight total blocks.
The Cardinal is now 4-2 on the season
and hosts top-ranked Hawaii at Maples Pa
vilion both Monday and Tuesday nights at
7:30 p.m.

Editor's note: For those of you who've
been wondering, the following is a basic
rundown of how we go about selecting our
Athletes of the Week.
Here's how it works in a typical week: On
Monday (or Tuesday, or whenever), one of
the Spectacular Seven (Shark, Mack, Rogo,
Shifty, Crades, Evan or Port) suggests two
names. We talk it out, argue occasionally
and then everyone says "Hey, fine with me."
Some weeks (such as this one) we have huge,
earth-shattering battles that no one wins,
and we end up with a tie.
