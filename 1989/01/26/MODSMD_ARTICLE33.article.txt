# Some suggestions for improvement in hoops
## 
### 
Well, we're over halfway
through the basketball season and
the Cardinal has clearly proven
that it deserves the top-20
ranking it began the season with.
This, as most anyone would agree,
is a real good team we've got here.

Still, as the old prophets say,
nothing breeds complacency like
success. In other words, there's
nothing like a good season to
make a sportswriter greedy. After
the two Arizona battles, we know
what a big win feels like. We've
tasted the thin air atop that top
-20 mountain. Now, it's time to
start looking and acting like we
belong there.
If you're going to play big-time
basketball, you've got to do it
right. You've got to look good.
With that end in mind, here are
some small suggestions that I
think would bring big results. I
think there s something here for
everyone to work on.
First, the fans. It's great that
Maples is always packed, and
when things are going our way,
the place really is rather loud.
Now it's time to show some
creativity.
Last game I had the dubious
treat of sitting in front of one
loud fan, and unfortunately, I
think he was typical. For 40
straight minutes, he yelled again
and again: "Trevor, you're a
freak." The spirit was there, but
not much else. Somebody out
there has got to be funnier than
that, and I'd really like to hear
them.
Second, Andy Geiger and the
athletic department. We really
should eet rid of the upper- and

lower-level distinction among the
student tickets. If you get to the
game early enough, you ought to
get a seat down low, no matter
what your ticket says. And be
sides, just about everybody in the
crowd knows an usher, which
makes the rule practically mean
ingless anyway. It can't be that
hard to find something else for
all those guys in yellow jackets to
do.
It's also about time we bought
the players some new sweatsuits.
We need something real flashy,
and we' need names on the back.
They're & .top-20 team. They
deserve at least that.
Next, the players. You're play
ing great. I'm loving every minute
of it, but it's time to start plan
ning for those postseason tourna
ments. (I know you don't like to
look past the next game, but let's
just do it here.) It's going to take
something extra to beat the big
boys, and I think image is a part
of that something.
First, warm-ups: NCAA rules
prohibit dunking in warm-ups,
but that doesn't mean you can't
show off a little more than you
do. We're big, nasty leapers and
we ought to make sure everyone
knows it. For the model here, look
to Deshon Wingate, the most en
tertaining man on the team. If
everyone warmed up with moves
like Deshon's, the crowd would
be going crazy while the other
team went numb. We've got to
take this warm-up thing seriously
Second, nicknames: 1 know it's
cheesy, but we need some catchy
monikers. Our starting lineup is
named Todd, Eric, Howard, Terry
and Andrew. There's nothing
wron t { with those names, but it
could be the debate squad. Whore
are the Poohs, the J.K.s, the
Cadillacs, the Sleepya? I know you
guys have something stored away
in the lockerroom. Just let it on
out.
Finally, haircuts: With the ex
ception of Bryan McSweeney'H
flat-top, the team'B look is pretty


ERIK STEN
uninspired. I'm not advocating
the sort of thing that would ruin
anybody's social life or get them
in trouble with their mother, but
we could use a bald head, an arrow
or something of the sort.

It's too late for this season, but
for next year, I suggest that Adam
Keefe grow his hair out and start
wearing a bandana. It's been years
since a center of Bill Walton's
caliber terrorized the Pacific 10
Conference, but Adam could be
the league's next redheaded
wonder. It will, however, take
some attention to image.
Being in the top 20 is a new

thing to us Stanford people, and
I know it's taken a little getting
used to. But now, the time has
come, and if we all band together,
there's no reason we can't look
as good as we play. As Billy Crys
tal used to say, it's not how you
feel, it's how you look.
And finally, while I'm thinking
about it, I'd like to give an open
invitation to all of the campus

basketball players. If we're not
already short enough at the guard
position this year, next year, when
we lose the services of Todd Lichtu
and Terry Taylor, we certainly
will be. there's no real chance
that we'll be able to recruit four
solid guards. So if you've got what
it takes, get yourself ready and
make yourself known. That's it
for now, folks.
