### 
Daily Super Bowl
coverage not overblown
Thank you.
Yesterday morning could
have been my breaking point,
but the Daily's "Sports Mon
day" showed me that there was
at least one sympathetic sports
staff in the Bay Area. You did
so not in what you wrote, but
in what you quietly left out:
namely three pages of Super
"Bull" coverage.
For two and one-half years
I have grudgingly endured the
San Francisco Chronicle's
biased sports coverage.
Granted, you cannot fault a
newspaper for providing the ex
tra home-team coverage that
many local fans demand. But
I scoffed at how quickly the
fickle Bay Area fans and writ
ers were able to bury the 1987
pennant-winning Giants and to
resurrect that American
League team from across the
Bay.
Perhaps that is the luxury
of having two major league
teams in the area, but I know
few Mets fans who will next
adore the Yankees if they cap
ture the AL East pennant.
Football has presented less
of a problem most of the
season. After wading through
a few pages of 49er previews
on Sunday and analyses on
Monday and Tuesday, I always
found what I was looking for.
Then came an NFC champi
onship and two weeks of pure
hell. Each day a little more of
the Sporting Green turned to
red and gold. I ignored it at
first, but it got harder and
harder to find anything else.
My displeasure culminated
on Friday when 12 of 16 pages
of my Sporting Green were
devoted to the Super Bowl All
I wanted to see was a box score
for the Hartford Whalers-
Montreal Canadiens hockey
game. That's it. Just a few
square inches of hockey news,
but it was not there.
I know that hockey is not
big in California, but I don't
care. It is a sport, one
that is important to me, and,
most notably, one that is nor

mally covered. So when I called
the Chronicle and heard that
they "did not have room," I
was irate. Either God never an
ticipated the Chronicle, or he
is not a sports fan.
Predictably, on Monday, 49er
mania was everywhere: the
front page of the paper, special
sports sections, local news and
even the Today show. I couldn't
hide, and I even considered
giving up on sports. But then
I picked up my Daily. Not even
a full column of Super Bowl
news, and half of that devoted
to Bud Bowl I.
Hallelujah! You understood.
I was at the men's volleyball
game. And I talked to some of
the swimmers over the week
end. But you knew that I still
wanted to read about these
events, and not about Joe or
Jerry or Bill.
So thank you again, Daily
sports. Maybe next week you
can include Hartford Whalers'
box scores.

Columnist's tactics
called into question
Throughout the entire
season we have been very im
pressed with the Daily's cover
age of the basketball team. It
was apparent even before the
season actually began that Jon
Weisman and Mark Rogowsky
were doing all they could to
build a REAL home court for
the Cardinal.
As a few of the rare true
basketball fans here at Stan
ford, we were really psyched
that we would no longer have
to endure the stigma of having
the Pacific 10 Conference's
worst fans.
Unfortunately, yesterday's
column, however well
intentioned (which we're sure
it was), was not in the same
tradition of Chris Fialko's
column last year that inspired
the fans against Arizona.
We agree, Mark, that Cardi
nal fans should not be
complacent. Maples is not yet all
it can be. It doesn't rock like
Madison Square Garden and isn't
as intimidating as Harmon Gym,
at least not yet.
This, however, is not a reason
to disparage the efforts thus far
of the students. It's not easy to
go from the Pac-10's laziest fans
to the nation's best overnight.
It was, for example, a
accomplishment just to get the en
tire student section to remain
standing. We personally remem
ber complaints just this year in
the game against the Czechoslo
vakian National Team about our
annoying habit.
We still get questions from fel
low students on why we must
remain on our feet instead of just
sitting back and applauding good
plays. (You can just watch the
game on TV if you want to!)
To put it bluntly, Stanford fans
lack tradition. Think about it!
With the exception of clapping to
"All Right Now" and chanting
"Weenies" and "Beat Cal" can you
name any cheer that was ever oc
casionally used at Stanford ath
letic events before this year?
That's what those fans who are
from traditional college basketball
backgrounds are trying to estab
lish. So far we've been moderately

successful: i.e. DEE-fense, stand
ing .. .
Where Rogowsky hits the bul
lseye in his criticism is in his talk
about complacency. Stanford fans
ARE MUCH TOO COM
PLACENT! Despite the tremen
dous improvement since last
year's Arizona game, there is
much more to be done. The point
is, though, that to disparage our
effort thus far is the wrong ap
proach.
A better idea would have been
to use your column to suggest
positive improvements that the
fans could have followed. We need
to do more and here are some
suggestions:
• The DEE-fense cheer is sup
posed to be kept slow and not
continuously sped up; (try imag
ining in your mind which one is
more intimidating!)
• Rhythmic clapping on offense
— Maples should not go silent
when the Cardinal has the ball.
• Additional cheers — i.e. "Let's
Go Card-Nal" (clap/clap . . .
clap/clap/clap) after introductions
and after timeouts.
• Not complaining about every
call that goes against Stanford but
just close or questionable ones.
The referees will lose all respect
for the crowd's basketball knowl
edge when it boos over obviously
correct calls.
But when the call is close or
wrong — Maples should go wild!!!
(Literally) If NBA refs make

"makeup" calls certainly the "bril
liant" Pac-10 officials do.
Thus while it's obvious that our
fans are- not going to qualify as
the country's most knowledgea
ble, we believe they deserve most
improved. Next time, Mark, use
your column like we continuously
do at games to improve the
school's basketball acumen and
crowd effectiveness. We, like you,
earnestly hope that by the Feb.
16 California game (on ESPN)
nobody will be able to even hear
themselves think.

Rogo replies: Your points are
well taken. While I stand by my
remarks, we share a common goal
and that is more than half the
battle.
People must realize that we
must do everything we can now,
in this season of glory. That will
help not only this year's club, but
also future teams in areas like
recruiting and in propelling those
squads not quite as talented as
the current group to a bevy of home
victories.
Most importantly, your letter
sets the stage for a dialogue on
the sports page. While future sub
missions will have to be shorter,
Sports Mailbag is here to stay.
