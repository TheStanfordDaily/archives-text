# Golfers finish sixth at Southern Cal

The ninth-ranked Stanford
women's golf team entered the
final round of play at the USC
Intercollegiate hopeful, only to
leave it and the tournament
slightly hurting. Coming full
circle, the Cardinal posted its
highest total of the 3-day tourney
and finished right where it was
after Monday's play — in sixth
place.
After a promising second round,
in which the team's top four fin
ishers all improved their scores,

Women's Golf
Sixth in USC Intercollegiate

Stanford was in a position to take
command with a good final round.
Instead, a 329 dropped them two
notches to the middle of the field.
"We felt coming into today that
we had a good chance to win it,"
Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin said.
"We had a feeling we were going
to play well, and we just didn't."
Junior Stephanie Parel was the

only Cardinal player to shoot un
der 80 in two rounds at the Oak
mont course, and placed ninth in
the individual rankings with her
final-round 78. "Tee to green,
Stephanie Parel hit the ball better
than anyone in this tournament,"
Baldwin said. "She improves im
measurably with each tourna
ment."
Jodi Figley, the accomplished
Stanford sophomore who finished
eighth at the NCAAs last year,
started the day in tenth place
before dropping back into the pack
with an 85.
"On this course you had to hit
your driver, and I wasn't hitting
mine all that great," Figley said.
"The course was a challenge. That
was probably one of my highest
rounds in college play."
Indeed, the Oakmont course
seemed to vex the entire field, and
not one golfer shot for par over
the entire tournament. Perhaps
that is why the LPGA tour named
it the most challenging stop in
their 1988 campaign. Yet, some
how, the difficulty came as a
surprise to Stanford.
"In the practice round, I don't
think anybody thought (the
course) would jump up and get
us the way it did," said freshman
Stephanie Davis, who was bitten
for a final round of 89 yesterday.
But then, as Baldwin said, "None
of our players had ever played the
course before, and I had never
seen it."
"Basically, what happened was
the golf course won the tourna
ment," Baldwin continued. "The
premiums were on everything, es
pecially putting."
New Mexico State found out the
hard way what the course can do
in just one day. The Aggies entered
Wednesday's play in first, nine
shots ahead of Arizona State.
When it was over., the leaders had
fallen with a dismal 332, and the
Sun Devils were the victors —- by
eight full strokes.
"We had a feeling (12th-ranked)
New Mexico State was going to
come back to the field," Baldwin
said. "We think we're a better
team than they are." USC, the
home course favorite, was one
stroke behind in third (953).
Texas, with tournament winner
Michiko Hattori leading the way
(225), was a close fourth, and San
Jose State .rounded out the top

five, 16 strokes behind the win
ners.
Individually, Stanford's not-so
wonderful scores were tempered
by the rest of the field'i
mediocrity. Behind Parel's top-l(
score of 238 were Figley (243)
Michele Lyford (246), Adel'
Moore (248) and Stephanie Dav;
(252).
Baldwin cited Lyford as on<
Cardinal player who is really com
ing on. "Michele showed stronj
signs of making a comeback," h<
said. "She had a very difficul
year last year, but lately she ha:

'We had a feeling we
were going to play
well, and we just
didn't.'

shown signs of coming around.'
If anything hurt the Cardinal
in this tournament, it would have
to have been the putting game.
Both Baldwin and Figley identi
fied Moore and Parel as players
who played excellent golf, only to
be hampered by the short game
"Adele Moore played excellent
golf, tee to green," Baldwin said
of his highly-touted freshman.
"But I didn't think she had the
ability to putt (that poorly). I
don't think we'll see Adele Moore
play like that again."
This gives the team something
to focus on in the next two weeks
of practice before it heads to Tuc
son for the next tournament. "We
know what we have to work on,'
Figley said. "I don't want to say
the Arizona course is easier, but
it's less tricky."
Davis summed up the team's
attitude: "Overall, we're a litt
disappointed, because we know wi
have the potential to be one ot
the better teams in the country
We need to work a little bit
harder, concentrate a little bit
more."
Chalk this tournament up tc
experience, but from here on out
every competition is important
"We know if we want to qualify
for the NCAAs we have to plaj
extremely well at Tucson,'
Baldwin said.
