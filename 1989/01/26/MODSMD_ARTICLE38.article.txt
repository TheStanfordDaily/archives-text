# Walsh to step down as coach
## 
### 
According to an anonymous
source close to the management
of the San Francisco 49ers, Bill
Walsh will anounce at noon today
that he is stepping down as head
coach but will remain with the
team as a vice president.
Speculation has been surround
ing Walsh's future plans for
months now. When it became a

distraction during the weeks
before the Super Bowl, Walsh said
he would make an announcement
soon after the game.
Widely recognized as the chief
architect of the 49ers, Walsh
guided the team to three Super
Bowl titles in the '80s including
last Sunday's 20-16 victory over
the Bengals.
