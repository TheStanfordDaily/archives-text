has other priorities to space such as for
academics, housing and social activi
ties," he added.

report on fraternities and sororities.
The report, released in January 1988
by a committee of 18 members, ex

Greek system at Stanford.
ISC members cite the third point of
the six-point task report as justification
for establishing a lodge.
Point three states that "all fraterni
ties, whether male, female or coeduca
tional should have equal access to Uni
versity facilities if they comply with
University guidelines."
"Fraternities can facilitate their goals,
but sororities must depend on the Uni-
