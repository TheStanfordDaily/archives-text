# Sororities want space on campus
## 
### DJ Berinstein Staff writer 
In a report released yesterday, the
Intersorority Council asked the Univer
sity to establish a "lodge" on campus
that would be shared by all of Stanford's
sororities for programming and office
space.
"Sororities need certain things to sur
vive," said Lisa Hellmann, Tri Delta
president and one of the four authors
of the ISC report.
A lodge "could be a good thing for
the school since our demands are bigger"
than in past years, she said, noting that
currently 21 percent of all undergradu

ate females take part in sorority life.
While many of Stanford's fraternities
maintain on-campus residences, sorori
ties have been banned from student
housing since 1944. Sororities currently
take turns holding their weekly meet
ings in Breer Library, a small room at
the Row Housing Office, next to the
Phi Delta Theta Fraternity.
"The needs for sorority space are
legitimate," said Fraternal Affairs Ad
viser Joe Pisano. But "the University
has other priorities to space such as for
academics, housing and social activi
ties," he added.
The three-page report was written to
respond to the University's task force

report on fraternities and sororities.
The report, released in January 1988
by a committee of 18 members, ex
amined the history and the role of the
Greek system at Stanford.
ISC members cite the third point of
the six-point task report as justification
for establishing a lodge.
Point three states that "all fraterni
ties, whether male, female or coeduca
tional should have equal access to Uni
versity facilities if they comply with
University guidelines."
"Fraternities can facilitate their goals,
but sororities must depend on the Uni-
versity" to help provide a place
for events, said Gamma Phi Beta
representative to the ISC Diane
Bisgeier, one of the report's au
thors.
According to ISC representative
for Kappa Kappa Gamma Katie
Henry, sorority members could
easily pay for the lodge with the
housing dues are collected at the
beginning of each year and rarely
used.
While sorority members are still
discussing the details of this pro
posal, the main goal is to establish
a common meeting place, accord
ing to Bisgeier. "The lodge will
encourage coordination among so
rorities and will provide for more

autonomy," she said, adding that
sorority members are "flexible"
about the specifics of the lodge.
By giving sororities a common
space, "the University would be
showing support for the sorori
ties," Bisgeier said.
The ISC report also seeks to
differentiate between the roles fra
ternities and sororities play.
While the first point of the Uni
versity's task report emphasizes
the different selection processes
used by fraternities and sororities
at Stanford, the ISC's report
seeks to further clarify those dif
ferences.
According to the report, while
fraternity rush does guarantee
rushees a spot in a fraternity,
"sorority rush is a guaranteed bid
system: all participants in Rush
are assured of receiving a bid from
at least one sorority."
