# Med School updates fraud policies
## 
### Aileen Resnick Staff writer 
In response to allegations of scientific
fraud at some U.S. academic institu
tions, Dr. David Korn, vice president
and dean of the Stanford School of
Medicine, released an updated statement
of the school's "Policies and Procedures
Related to Academic Fraud and Profes
sional Misconduct."
In a memo accompanying the state
ment, Korn said he was changing the
name of the Committee on Ethical Sci
entific Performance to the Committee
on Scientific and Professional Integrity
of the School of Medicine, a name Korn
said will "describe more precisely the
role of the committee."

According to Korn, "the original com
mittee was asked to be concerned with
looking into potential problems (regard
ing) the conduct of scientific research.
Over the years, we've asked it to look
into concerns . . . involving clinical sit
uations with patients."
These situations include physician
patient relationships and, Korn added,
involve a "different kind of ethical aber
ration" than those occurring in a re
search laboratory setting.
Since its inception in 1983, the com
mittee has investigated six cases of al
leged fraud or misconduct. Six of these
investigations have resulted in Univer
sity action.
According to the statement, examples
of fraud and misconduct include "fal

sification of research results, deliberate
distortion of research data, plagiarism
in scholarly publications and misap
propriation of the intellectual property
of others."
The policies outlined also pertain to
cases of negligence that do not result
in fraud as well as to violations of rules
regarding research using human or an
imal subjects.
The statement said that all allegations
of fraud must be referred to the dean,
who will initiate a preliminary investi
gation of the accusation. If the dean
believes further investigation of the
matter is warranted, the dean will refer
the case to the Committee on Scientific
and Professional Integrity, which will
complete a "thorough examination."
