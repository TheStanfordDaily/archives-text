# Meese talk to highlight Hoover conference
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
On Saturday former U.S. Attorney
General Edwin Meese 111 will make his
first public appearance at Stanford since
leaving the Reagan administration.
Meese, who is now a "distinguished
visiting fellow" at the Hoover Institu
tion, is scheduled to give a speech on
public service as part of a day-long con
ference titled "Issues of the '90s" being
held at Memorial Auditorium.

The conference, which
is co-sponsored by the
Hoover Institution and
the Stanford Alumni As
sociation, also includes
debates on social policy,
the U.S. economy and
open societies. All par
ticipants in the debates
are contributors to the
new Hoover book

"Thinking About America: The United
States in the 19905."
The conference is open to the public
and costs $35 to attend.
Meese's appointment to Hoover this
summer drew widespread criticism in
the Stanford community. Hoover Direc
tor W. Glenn Campbell said last July
that Meese would receive "no less than
$10,000, no more than $20,000" for his
part-time affiliation with Hoover. Meese
also spends time at the Heritage Foun
dation, a conservative think-tank in

Washington, D.C.
Meese does not have an academic ap
pointment at Stanford.
Last week the Justice Department's
Office of Professional Responsibility
issued a report stating that if Meese
were still in office, "disiplinary action"
would be taken against him for "conduct
which should not be tolerated of any
government employee, especially not the
Attorney General." Allegations against
Meese include preferential treatment
given to friends and participation in de
cisions on companies in which he owned
stock.
Lawyers for the former U.S. Attorney
General called the Justice Department's
report a "travesty of justice."
Meese resigned from his post in the
Justice Department in early August, fol
lowing an independent counsel's 14-
month investigation into possible ethical
violations. An 830-page report concluded
that there was no basis for criminal
proceedings against Meese.
Upon announcing his resignation,
Meese said the report "completely vind
icated him."
Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young had
originally been scheduled to appear on
the panel debating social policy, but can
celed earlier this week.
According to conference director
Beverly Smith, Young is considering a
gubernatorial bid in Georgia, where a
meeting of potential candidates is also
scheduled for Saturday.
