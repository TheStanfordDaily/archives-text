# Black or African American: Debators square off over issue
## 
### Sophia Shing Staff writer 
To be called black American or African
American, that is the question. The answer
â€” is yet to be agreed upon.
Branner Presents, a two week series of
discussions on topics of "fun and conten
tion," sponsored a debate Tuesday night
with Kennell Jackson, associate professor
of history, and Mary Dillard, chair of the
Black Student Union, supporting the name
African American. In opposition, Michael
Jackson, associate dean of Students Affairs
and freshman Damien Atkins of Branner
spoke in favor of being called black Amer
ican.
The question of whether to change the

term applied to American
blacks was brought to
prominence by Rev. Jesse
Jackson during a Decem
ber press conference when
he said American blacks
should begin using the
term African American.
Speaking to a crowded
room, Dillard talked about
a "historical void" in edu-

cation regarding the curriculum about
Africa. She said there is a need to make
a "connection between African Americans
all over the world."
Dillard said the University has been
using the term African American for at
least two years now. She said that the use

of the term is primarily to
fill in the "historical void"
by making people aware of
African history.
In response, Atkins
pointed to the cultural di
versity in Africa and said
the term African American
was "not cultural" at all
because Africa itself has so
many different cultures

within it. Rather, he said it is the name
black American which gives people their
identity.
Atkins concluded his statement by agree
ing with the response which his barber
provided when posed this introspective
question. His barber said, "If you want to

call me anything, just call me by my name."
Citing past uses of the term African,
Kennell Jackson said the earliest black
people in the United Stated referred to
themselves as African Americans. He said
before the Declaration of Independence,
there was no question from black people
about being African in origin.
In the 19th and 20th centuries, Kennell
Jackson said people have "lost that thread."
"Until they take on the label of Africa
and uphold Africa, they cannot cross the
cultural and psychological boundary to
truly identify where they're from and be
able to educate others. Blacks should look
beyond their boundaries," Kennell Jackson
