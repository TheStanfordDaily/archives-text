Re: Proposal Affecting Housing Assignments of First-Year Students of Color
Under discussion is a proposal to modify the current plan by which entering students are assigned to their residences. On behalf of the Committee on Undergraduate Residential Affairs, I am inviting response
to the proposal described here. The community is invited to attend and participate in a public meeting Wednesday, February 1 in the Meyer Library Forum R(X)m from 4-spm. If you would like to comment
in writing, please send your thoughts to C-URA, c/o Jackie Miller, Building 10, I.D. 2061.
CURRENT SYSTEM
Currently frosh are assigned to residences in a way that seeks to make the population of each house as much as possible a reflection of the ethnic, geographic, regional, academic and athletic diversity of the
class. Each residence is an approximate microcosm of the class as a whole.
Whenever possible, students of color are assigned to the house in a group of not less than four students of the same ethnicity (usually two men and two women). The current system does not produce an exact
microcosm. Currently, about 70% of the houses with frosh include Black, Chicano/Latino, and Asian American students; about 30% of the houses have two of the three communities represented. The American
Indian population is a small percentage of the class; special housing arrangements apply to American Indian students.
The distribution of students of color over the residence system is obviously a function, in part, of the total numbers of students of color in the entering class. For 1988-89, with a large frosh class and increased
enrollment of students of color, the numbers were: Blacks (165), Chicano/Latinos (162), and Asian Americans (245).
Concern has been expressed by some students of color about the effect of the current system. They report that being one of a very few students of the same background in a residence can result in feelings of
isolation. Being one of a handful of students of the same ethnicity can lead to feelings of being marginal, outside the mainstream community, and lacking in influence in house decisions. Some students say
that they are put on the spot by being looked to as representatives of their ethnic communities.
ALTERNATIVE MODEL UNDER CONSIDERATION
A proposal has been made to assign larger numbers of first year students of color, of the same ethnic background, to individual houses. To facilitate discussion and response to the proposal, one specific model
is laid out below, with its components listed in order of priority. Variations of this model are possible, and, indeed, solicited.
(1) All houses with frosh would have a least two of the three larger ethnic communities represented.
(2) In all-frosh houses, a group would have no fewer than eight students of a particular background; in four-class houses, a group would have no fewer than four frosh of a particular background.
(3) In four-class houses, a gnmp would have no fewer than eight students of the same ethnic background, including upperclass students.
The pn>posed change would have some effect on the mix of students in the residences. The actual number of frosh of the same ethnic background in a house could depend in part on the number of upper
class students of that ethnicity who are assigned to the house in the Draw. Where many houses now have representation of the three largest communities of cok>r, most houses would have two groups represented;
for example, a house might have Asian American and Black student but no Chicano students.
If the alternative model were implemented, students of color would be among more students who share their background. Students of color might feel more comfortable and supported in their residence and
more encouraged to participate hilly and equally in house affairs. The alternative model would affect the mix of students assigned to a house and would have an effect on interaction and discussion. In some
houses, one significant population of students would be absent, affecting daily interaction and the range of perspectives that come up in house discussions.
QUESTIONS
Community opinion will be important in reaching a decision on whether the proposal should be tried on an experimental basis. Please let us know your views on these questions:
1. From your vantage point, what aspects of the current undergraduate residence experience of all frosh in general and of frosh in cok>r in particular would In* affected by the proposal? And how would thev
be affected?
2. What other considerations should be made in evaluating this proposal?
3. W'hat general and specific changes in the proposal would improve it?
4. Should the system be made optional in some way?
5. At present, students' Western Culture/CIV choices determine housing assignments; then efforts are made to balance the populations of houses across several dimensions, including ethnicity. If the proposal
is adopted, should efforts to grant students of color their highest available CIV choice take precedence over efforts to group students ofcobr together?
6. Should the alternative model be tried on an experimental basis next year?
7. Should the current method of freshmen assignments be maintained? Why? If so, are there better means for helping students of color feel more supported and less isolated in residences under the current
system?

Re: Proposal Affecting Housing Assignments of First-Year Students of Color
Under discussion is a proposal to modify the current plan by which entering students are assigned to their residences. On behalf of the Committee on Undergraduate Residential Affairs, I am inviting response
to the proposal described here. The community is invited to attend and participate in a public meeting Wednesday, February 1 in the Meyer Library Forum R(X)m from 4-spm. If you would like to comment
in writing, please send your thoughts to C-URA, c/o Jackie Miller, Building 10, I.D. 2061.
CURRENT SYSTEM
Currently frosh are assigned to residences in a way that seeks to make the population of each house as much as possible a reflection of the ethnic, geographic, regional, academic and athletic diversity of the
class. Each residence is an approximate microcosm of the class as a whole.
Whenever possible, students of color are assigned to the house in a group of not less than four students of the same ethnicity (usually two men and two women). The current system does not produce an exact
microcosm. Currently, about 70% of the houses with frosh include Black, Chicano/Latino, and Asian American students; about 30% of the houses have two of the three communities represented. The American
Indian population is a small percentage of the class; special housing arrangements apply to American Indian students.
The distribution of students of color over the residence system is obviously a function, in part, of the total numbers of students of color in the entering class. For 1988-89, with a large frosh class and increased
enrollment of students of color, the numbers were: Blacks (165), Chicano/Latinos (162), and Asian Americans (245).
Concern has been expressed by some students of color about the effect of the current system. They report that being one of a very few students of the same background in a residence can result in feelings of
isolation. Being one of a handful of students of the same ethnicity can lead to feelings of being marginal, outside the mainstream community, and lacking in influence in house decisions. Some students say
that they are put on the spot by being looked to as representatives of their ethnic communities.
ALTERNATIVE MODEL UNDER CONSIDERATION
A proposal has been made to assign larger numbers of first year students of color, of the same ethnic background, to individual houses. To facilitate discussion and response to the proposal, one specific model
is laid out below, with its components listed in order of priority. Variations of this model are possible, and, indeed, solicited.
(1) All houses with frosh would have a least two of the three larger ethnic communities represented.
(2) In all-frosh houses, a group would have no fewer than eight students of a particular background; in four-class houses, a group would have no fewer than four frosh of a particular background.
(3) In four-class houses, a gnmp would have no fewer than eight students of the same ethnic background, including upperclass students.
The pn>posed change would have some effect on the mix of students in the residences. The actual number of frosh of the same ethnic background in a house could depend in part on the number of upper
class students of that ethnicity who are assigned to the house in the Draw. Where many houses now have representation of the three largest communities of cok>r, most houses would have two groups represented;
for example, a house might have Asian American and Black student but no Chicano students.
If the alternative model were implemented, students of color would be among more students who share their background. Students of color might feel more comfortable and supported in their residence and
more encouraged to participate hilly and equally in house affairs. The alternative model would affect the mix of students assigned to a house and would have an effect on interaction and discussion. In some
houses, one significant population of students would be absent, affecting daily interaction and the range of perspectives that come up in house discussions.
QUESTIONS
Community opinion will be important in reaching a decision on whether the proposal should be tried on an experimental basis. Please let us know your views on these questions:
1. From your vantage point, what aspects of the current undergraduate residence experience of all frosh in general and of frosh in cok>r in particular would In* affected by the proposal? And how would thev
be affected?
2. What other considerations should be made in evaluating this proposal?
3. W'hat general and specific changes in the proposal would improve it?
4. Should the system be made optional in some way?
5. At present, students' Western Culture/CIV choices determine housing assignments; then efforts are made to balance the populations of houses across several dimensions, including ethnicity. If the proposal
is adopted, should efforts to grant students of color their highest available CIV choice take precedence over efforts to group students ofcobr together?
6. Should the alternative model be tried on an experimental basis next year?
7. Should the current method of freshmen assignments be maintained? Why? If so, are there better means for helping students of color feel more supported and less isolated in residences under the current
system?
