At Last,
A Real Grand Opening
Saturday and Sunday at Whole Foods Market
At Whole Foods Market, we like to do things a little differently. So when we scheduled
a grand opening celebration for our new store in Palo Alto, we decided to make it
really special.
Food For Thought
All net proceeds from our Grand Opening Weekend, January 28-29, will be donated to
the Senior Coordinating Council's Senior Learning Center. We're very anxious
to serve the needs of the senior community in and around Palo Alto, and this is one
way of demonstrating our support for the Senior Center.
Grand Prize
One of our shoppers during Grand Opening Weekend will win $1,000.00 worth of
food from Whole Foods Market. Just register when you come to the store any time on
Saturday, or Sunday before 5 p.m. The drawing will be held Sunday at 5. No purchase
is necessary, and you need not be present to win.
Other Grand Prizes
Throughout the day Saturday and Sunday, we'll be giving away books, mugs, t-shirts,
aprons, and other special prizes. Drawings will be held at the store every hour from
9 a.m. to 9 p.m. both days.
Stanford Band
The incomparable Stanford Hand will be on hand for a special performance Saturday
morning at 11:00 a.m. So, come join the Hand at Whole Foods Market.
Grand Tastes
All day Saturday and Sunday, you can enjoy free tastings of a delicious assortment of
salads, baked goods, wines, cheeses, and meats. All our prepared foods are made fresh
on the premises every day.
KCBS Kitchen
The popular "KCHS Kitchen" radio show will broadcast live from our market on Saturday
morning from 10:00 a.m. to 12. Stop by and see host Narsai David in action.
Ribbon Cutting
At noon on Saturday, we'll hold our official ribbon cutting, attended by appropriate
officials from Whole Foods Market, the city of Palo Alto, and the Senior Center.
It promises to be a grand weekend and a couple of grand days for shopping. So, come see
us, and you'll discover a store that is unique, fun to visit, and above all, good for you.
