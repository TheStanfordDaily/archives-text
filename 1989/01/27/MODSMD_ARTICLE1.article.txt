# Affirmative action
## Court vote has no impact here but stirs debate 
### Raoul Mowatt 
While a Supreme Court decision which struck
down a Richmond, Va., affirmative action plan on
Monday does not directly afTect Stanford, it has
nevertheless revived debate here over programs that
attempt to redress past discrimination towards
people of color, and created new concern for their
future.
Like many other state and municipal govern
ments, the city of Richmond designed a law which
automatically awarded 30 percent of its construction
contracts to minority-owned businesses. By a 6-3
decision, the Court held that this ordinance was
unconstitutional because it denied white contractors
equal protection of the law under the 14th Amend
ment.
This case marks the first time that the Court
has used strict scrutiny to examine a statute that
favored blacks over whites. Strict scrutiny is a type
of judicial analysis requiring laws which openly make
racial distinctions to have a compelling reason for
doing so.
Because the Richmond government did not dem
onstrate specific instances of past discrimination
that could provide a compelling reason, it failed the
standard of strict scrutiny.
Based on this application of strict scrutiny, many
existing affirmative action programs may likewise
be struck down, according to an article in the Jan.
24 New York Times.
Because the decision revolves around the Court's
reading of the 14th Amendment, which only affects
state entities and not private institutions, Stanford's
own affirmative action program is in no imminent
danger. Rob Parker, Stanford's affirmative action
officer, said yesterday,"The key point is that it will
do nothing to diminish Stanford's commitment to
an aggressive affirmative action program."
Emphasizing that he had not yet read the actual
Supreme Court opinion, which was written by Stan
ford graduate Sandra Day O'Connor, Parker was
reluctant to comment on the possible ramifications
of the holding. "This is a very narrow kind of a
case, from what I could tell, and I would hope that
it wouldn't spill over into other areas," he explained.
By contrast, Jennifer Bryson, president of the
College Republicans, hailed Monday's ruling as "a
step toward the America that Martin Luther King
Jr. envisioned, an America that is not based on race
distinction."
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Keith Archuleta
responded, "It is typical for the right wing to co-opt
the words of the Civil Rights movement as it destroys
everything that the Civil Rights movement and Mar
tin Luther King stand for. It's an insult to black
people and to the intelligence of all democratically
minded people."
Acknowledging that the decision would have a
limited effect on Stanford's formal practices, Bryson
expressed optimism that it would lessen tensions
between various ethnic groups. She stated, "I'm
hopeful, though it will take time at Stanford, that
there will be a decrease in the emphasis on labeling
people by race."
Michael Jackson, associate dean of Student Af
fairs, cautioned that people must understand the
limited scope of the Richmond ruling. However, he
indicated concern in the Court's
potential future orientation.
Jackson said, "I believe this
might be perceived as a very
devastating blow for affirmative
action in this country. I think it
indicates to black people and other
people of color that they must
redouble their efforts to ensure
that affirmative action is alive and
well."
Jackson also questioned the
standards of proof that the Court
would accept in displaying the
need for an affirmative action pro
gram. "It may be difficult to prove
that there are specific instances
of discrimination, but not impos
sible. That's why we need the sup
port of lawyers and other
community leaders if the thresh
old is higher, then we must reach
that threshold," he explained.
Subodh Chandra, co-president
of the Stanford Democrats, said,
"It is a noteworthy and ironic
point that Justice Thurgood Mar
shall, who himself argued Brown
v. Board of Education [the deci

sion which integrated America's
public school's system in 1954]
before the Supreme Court, as a
trial lawyer, passionately dis
sented in this case, urging his col
leagues to consider the past and
current history of discrimination,
while Reagan appointee O'Connor
put forward some 'theory' of con
stitutional 'color-blindness.'"
He added, "In delivering an op
inion like this, which does not
follow the previous progressive
path, the Court is inviting chal
lenges to affirmative action pro
grams all across the country. The
sad fact is over half the judges
who will decide those cases are
Reagan appointees."
Archuleta said, "What people
forget when they look at affirm
ative action is that (it) has been
with us for 15 to 20 years . ..
and they forget that for 300 years,
black folks have been denied . . .
full citizenship. People are saying,
'Black people want too much,' and
they forget that whole history."
Gina Hernandez, president of
MEChA, Timothy Pinkston, vice
president of the Graduate Black
Student Association, agreed with
Archuleta.
