# Graduate survey:
## Students environmentally aware 
### Maryellen Driscoll Staff writer 
According to a recent survey
on environmental awareness at
Stanford, students are well
informed on the basic environ
mental issues of the world.
The survey, sponsored by the
Stanford Public Service Center
in conjunction with the continu
ing "You Can Make A Differ
ence" conference, indicated that
students can answer basic ques
tions on such environmental is
sues as the ozone layer, rain
forests and the greenhouse ef
fect.
Graduate student Kent Har
ber, who circulated the survey
among 214 students this past
weekend, said that "Scoring well
does not necessarily indicate
mastery over a range of envi

ronmental issues."
Nevertheless, students indi
cated on the survey that they
did not think environmental is
sues were overwhelmingly com
plicated.
The survey also indicated that
the environment is not of "great
personal concern" to students
but still one of the most impor
tant social issues behind educa
tion and civil rights.
Students said that private in
dustry was most responsible for
causing environmental prob
lems, and that political pres
sure, not scientific
breakthrough, would help to
resolve the problem.
Also students said that as in
dividual citizens they could have
the most impact on correcting
environmental problems before

the state and local government,
the scientific community and
volunteer organizations.
Of the students responding,
only 33 percent were able to
identify a representative leader
of the environmental movement.
The names repeatedly men
tioned were: actress Jane Fonda,
consumer advocate Ralph
Nader, Sierra Club Foundation
founder David Brower and the
rock band, and advocates of
Amazon rain forests, the Grate
ful Dead.
"The environmental move
ment is a fairly decentralized
movement in the United
States," which would explain
why there is no prominent cen
tral leader, said Julie Bunn, co
director of the "You Can Make
a Difference" conference.
