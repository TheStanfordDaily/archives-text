# A 						money-back offer
## Students get quarterly chance at ASSU refunds 
### Mark Richman 
Over the next two weeks, stu
dents have the opportunity to col
lect the fees that the ASSU
claimed on tuition bills in Sep
tember.
According to estimates based on
past rebates, roughly 30 percent
of eligible students will claim some
of the $25 they paid to the ASSU.
This quarter the refunds are
$23.87, which includes the entire
ASSU fee except a surcharge that
goes to cover the election, said
Council of President member
Canetta Ivy.
The quarterly fee assessed on
both undergraduate and graduate
students supports such groups as
the Black Student Union, club
sports, The Daily, ASSU Legal
Counseling, ChIPS (Chicanos in
Public Service), the Band, KZSU
and the SURE escort service.
"If you felt strongly about a
particular organization's being

funded, and it was funded but
you didn't want it to be, you have
the democratic right to request
your money back," Ivy said.
However, Ivy speculated that
most students who request their
money back do so "because at the
time they're broke."
Most student organizations are
drained equally by the fees, ac
cording to ASSU Senate Chair Da
vid Porter. On average, about 25
percent of a group's funding is
revoked, although a few lose less
money.
Students eligible for refunds are
those who either voted last spring
in the ASSU elections or who are
first-year students who did not
have the opportunity to vote last
year.
Fee refunds are available at the
Juniper Room in Tresidder Union
between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. Monday
through Friday for the next two
weeks.
