## Soviets blamed in Afghan deaths 
### 
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) â€” So
viet gunners wiped out Afghan villages
and shelled a mountain tunnel, killing
hundreds of civilians along the key high
way carrying Red Army soldiers home
from Afghanistan, Western diplomats
said yesterday
In Washington, meanwhile, Secretary
of State James Baker 111 ordered the
closing of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul,
the Afghan capital, because of turmoil
from the Soviet troop withdrawal.
Western diplomats in Islamabad
quoted Afghan sources and a witness
as saying the Soviets and Afghan gov
ernment troops committed a "major
atrocity" on Monday in shelling both
ends of the 10-mile Salang Tunnel.
The tunnel, part of the crucial Salang
Highway that connects Kabul to the
Soviet Union, cuts through the Hindu
Kush mountains about 60 miles north
of the capital.

The diplomats, who spoke on condi
tion of anonymity, quoted a report from
Kabul as saying: "After shelling the
north and south ends of the Salang
tunnel, Soviet and Afghan artillery
obliterated all dwellings and villages
south of the tunnel."
In Washington, State Department
press representative Charles Redman
said, "There are eyewitnesses who say
no dwellings remain and hundreds of
civilians were killed."
A dispatch from Kabul received by
one Western embassy quoted reports of
witnesses seeing "Soviet tanks rolling
over dead bodies of victims" along the
highway, which runs for 250 miles be
tween Kabul and the Soviet border.
It said the report of all houses being
destroyed came from three separate
sources, including a diplomat who
defends the Afghan government.
Afghan media and military officers

had reported 377 guerrillas were killed
Tuesday along the Salang Highway,
where the insurgents have attacked
many food and fuel convoys trying to
reach Kabul.
Heavy snows also have blocked parts
of the road, and Kabul has suffered
severe food and fuel shortages as the
end of the Soviet military withdrawal
approaches.
Moslem guerrillas have fought since
a Communist coup in April 1978, and
Soviet soldiers joined the battle in De
cember 1979. Last May, the Red Army
began withdrawing under a U.N.-
mediated agreement and all Soviet mil
itary forces are to be gone by Feb. 15.
The increased tensions surrounding
the Soviet pullout prompted the Bush
administration's new secretary of state
to shut down the Kabul embassy on his
first day on the job, a U.S. official source
said.
