# Keep buyout breaks, says Fed
## Greenspan urges Congress to save takeover deductions 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Federal Reserve Chair Alan
Greenspan urged Congress yester
day not to reduce tax deductions
for interest paid on bonds and
loans used to finance corporate
takeovers.
Greenspan told the Senate
Finance Committee that restrict
ing deductions for interest paid
on high-yield bonds and other
debt to finance leveraged buyouts,
takeover defenses and corporate
restructuring "would create ad
verse secondary consequences."
In response to questions, how
ever, Greenspan said it is not pos
sible to "figure out in advance"
what the consequences of tax-law
changes would be and acknowl
edged, "If it were done over a
long period of time, I suspect the
market implications would not be
large."
Greenspan's comments con
flicted with comments by Bush
and Reagan administration offi
cials who have put part of the
blame for the October 1987 stock

market crash on an aborted at
tempt then by the Ways and
Means Committee to modestly
restrict interest deductions on
debts incurred in corporate
restructurings.
Securities and Exchange Com
mission Chairman David Ruder
warned the Finance Committee
on Wednesday that tampering
with the tax code could create
another panic in a "skittish and
nervous" stock market.
Both the Finance and Ways and
Means committees are re
examining leveraged buyouts in
the wake of the pending $25 bil
lion purchase of RJR Nabisco Co.
by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
and the $13 billion buyout of
Kraft Inc. by Phillip Morris Co.
last year.
Those were the biggest two of
more than 300 leveraged buyouts
totaling nearly $100 billion in
1988.
Two weeks before he took office,
President Bush, in discussing
buyouts, left open the possibility

of changing the way the tax laws
treat dividends and deductions for
interest payments on junk bonds.
A leveraged buyout is similar
to a person buying an automobile
on credit with a very small down
payment. In the case of the auto
purchase, a three- to five-year
loan is secured by the value of
the car being bought.
With a leveraged buyout or re
structuring of a corporation, high
interest junk bonds secured by the
company's assets are issued to
buy stock from shareholders at
premiums 45 percent or more
above its market price before
hand.
To cover the interest payments,
the new owners often have to cut
back on research, sell off some
assets or divisions, close stores or
plants, lay off workers or cut their
pay and and reduce pension con
tributions.
Congress in 1986 voted to
gradually end the tax deductions
for interest paid on car loans and
other consumer credit purchases.
