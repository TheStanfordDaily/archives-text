WASHINGTON (AP) - A gun
man opened fire on a crowd of
students outside a District of Co
lumbia high school yesterday,
wounding four, police said. The
incident apparently erupted be
cause of a dispute earlier in the
day.
At least two of the injured stu
dents were members of the bas
ketball team at the school, in an
affluent section of Northwest
Washington.
One witness said the man
"knew where he wanted to shoot,
and then he just started shooting
at random." Police said the as
sailant seemed to have targeted
the students involved.
There were no immediate ar
rests, but authorities were said to
be searching for two or three men.
The shooting "seemed to be the
result of an altercation that had

taken place earlier in the day,"
said Capt. Robert Gales of the
District of Columbia police.
School system press representa
tive Charles Seigel said two "out
siders" entered Wilson High
School about noon and were in
volved in a "verbal altercation"
with students.
The students agreed to a fight
after school, Seigel said, and were
on their way to the site when the
shootings occurred.
When asked if any of the victims
knew the assailants, Gales said,
"I think some of the victims know
who was involved."
The shootings at Wilson High
School occurred about 2:30 p.m.,
minutes after the students were
dismissed for the day. None of the
injuries was thought to be life
threatening, although police said
at least one of the students was

seriously injured.
Doug Hill, a weatherman for
WUSA-TV, said he was driving in
front of the school when he heard
what he believed was automatic
gunfire and screams as the stu
dents dove for cover.
"I was in my car right in the
middle of the high school students
and there was enough panic that
they were running to my car
trying to get away," Hill said.
"When the gunfire stopped and I
looked up there were a dozen or
two dozen kids crouching down
on the ground looking for cover."
Hill said about 200 to 250 stu
dents were outside the building.
Stacy Karageorgos, age 15, a
sophomore, said she was looking
out a window of the school when
she saw a man with a gun climb
out of a dark-colored jeep.
