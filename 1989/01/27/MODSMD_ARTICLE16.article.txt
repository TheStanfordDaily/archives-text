Bush favors minimum wage hike
WASHINGTON (AP) - Elizabeth Dole was
sworn in as labor secretary yesterday and later
told Congress President Bush supports an in
creased minimum wage if accompanied by a sep
arate, lower minimum for young people in train
ing.
But Sen. Edward Kennedy, chair of the Senate
Labor Committee, said he would push legislation
without the training wage and was hopeful of its
prospects.
"We're going to get it raised this year for sure,"
Kennedy, D-Mass., said at a hearing he called to
assess the impact of projected labor shortages
and the prospect of averting them through new
programs to train welfare recipients and lower
income workers for jobs requiring skilled labor.
Dole told the committee it was her hope the
Labor Department could work to better coor
dinate the numerous job-training programs of
government agencies and emphasize training the

poor and unemployed to ease a "skills gap" in
the labor force.
"I think that we can work together and try
to figure this out, but I know that the president
feels that if there is going to be an there
should also be the training wage," Dole said in
her first public appearance since being confirmed
by the Senate on Wednesday.
