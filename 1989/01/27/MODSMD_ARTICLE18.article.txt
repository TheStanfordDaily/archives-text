Plans bringing Macs to
the Farm should bear
fruit for ethnic centers

APPLE COMPUTER is creat
ing a situation where every
body wins with its donation
of Mac II computers to Meyer Li
brary. That decision has in turn
enabled Meyer to donate its older
Macs — which will be upgraded to
the level of the Mac Plus — to the
residences across campus, which is
part of a wise University decision
to make the campus all Macintosh.
Let's face it. Macs are easier to
use, more fun and make more
sense to the computer novice. It
doesn't take much training to be
come Mac-proficient, thereby plac
ing computer power in the hands
of even the most non-technical
people.
The spread of 36 Macs across
campus is a positive development
in terms of increasing academic
efficiency, making it easier for stu
dents to revise papers and for stu
dent groups to generate graphics
and create fliers.
Placing computers in the resi
dences makes them accessible to
everyone, not just those fortunate
enough to be able to afford a com
puter. Equal distribution of tech
nology is an important considera
tion.
But are these computers being
distributed equitably? Since so
many computers are involved,
some thought should be given to
critical areas where just one or two
computers could make a difference.
Student groups across campus,
such as the ethnic centers and the
publications board, serve large con
stituencies with minimal re
sources.
The Black Community Services

Center, for example, provides serv
ices for 700 students and 25 stu
dent groups. The center has only
one Mac Plus with an outdated
hard disk drive.
The ability to produce newslet
ters, keep mailing lists and contact
names, generate letters, produce
fliers, etc. would be greatly en
hanced with better computer facil
ities. It would improve the effi
ciency of the office and free up
staff time for other urgent needs
and help those institutions do an
even better job of providing plu
ralistic services to the campus.
Before the distribution is com
pleted, some thought should be put
into the other kinds of places that
would benefit from such an impor
tant tool. What about graduate res
idences? How about the smaller
libraries around campus? Do they
get to share the technology? Let's
hope so.
Another useful way to ensure
the greatest access is to broadly
disseminate information about
where the Macs are located on
campus. Maps should be distrib
uted to students locating the Macs
around campus.
The potential for a "Macaver
sity" is truly exciting. Eventually,
the whole campus could go on-line
improving the capacity to rapidly
share information between stu
dents, faculty and staff.
Messages could be sent over the
system to someone on the other
side of campus. Special computer
bulletin boards could be estab
lished for people sharing a common
interest. Students could access Soc
rates or Odyssey at any hour of
the day or night without having
to travel across campus.
The computerization of the
campus is a long-overdue idea.
Let's just make sure that as Stan
ford moves in this direction im
portant sectors of our community
are not left out.
