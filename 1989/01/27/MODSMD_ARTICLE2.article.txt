# Hopi spreads prophecy
## Elder warns against wrong environmental path 
### Amy Rosenfeld Senior staff writer 
"If we the people who messed this
(world) up cannot clean it up" then
Mother Earth will shake us up and
purify the world herself, a Hopi elder
warned a crowd at Cubberley Audito
rium last night.
Thomas Banyacya, the last surviving
member of the quartet of young Hopis
who received a prophecy to spread to
the world in 1948, spoke as part of the
"You Can Make a Difference" confer
ence, which continues this weekend.
The prophecy tells of two possible fu
ture paths humans can take and warns
people about the consequences of choos
ing the wrong path.
According to the Hopi tradition, all
life began with Mother Earth, and
destroying any part of the environment
is akin to destroying the Mother's family.
Plants and animals may be used to
meet basic human needs, but wanton
destruction of them for materialistic use
is unnecessary, Banyacya said.
"A great pressure has been brought
upon us by our white brothers and
sisters to change our ways," Banyacya
said.

The prophecy includes several predic
tions about modern technology.
Hundreds of years ago, the elders
warned that people would one day talk
to each other over long distances
through cobwebs. Telephone wires in the
sky look very much like cobwebs,
Banyacya said. The elders also predicted
a road up in the sky — a road which
is today traversed by airplanes, he said.
However, the prediction Banyacya
said most convinced him to devote his
life to spreading the prophecy involved
a ceremonial Indian gourd rattle, but
one filled with ashes instead of beans.
If this gourd is ever allowed to fall on
the earth, it will burn everything to
ashes, the prophecy says.
These gourds, he said, were the atomic
bombs dropped on Japan in 1945.
Despite the bleak present state of the
environment, Banyacya said he believes
there is still hope for change.
As his previously quiet and calming
voice began to rise and break, Banyacya
warned the crowd that we are nearing
the final stage of the prophecy. Humans
must choose the proper path, he said.
Mother Earth has already shook us up
twice — the two world wars — and the
next time may be the last, he said.
