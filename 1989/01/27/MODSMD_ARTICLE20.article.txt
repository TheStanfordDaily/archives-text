## Bring back the F grade 
### 
UP IN THE cobwebbed attics of
our minde, we store a moldering
tale or two about What Failure
Taught Us. Three years ago I flunked
the Poli Sci 1 midterm. I'd never gotten
so much as a C before. I was furious and
started studying like it. For me, that F
was a wake-up call.
Believe it or not, I had not yet learned
that here at Stanford one couldn't get
an F as a final grade. And so, fearing
for my academic life, I buckled down for
the final in that terrifying, wonderful
class. But had I known how safe I had
been from an F, I would not have worked
so hard.
Perhaps Stanford's 20-year-old "no-
F's" grading system has failed us after
all. This policy was supposed to protect
us from the permanent stigma of low
grades, which, after all, sometimes prove
unavoidable due to late-term emergen
cies; to free us to dabble fearlessly in
classes less oriented towards our careers
or majors — renaissance art, perhaps, or
film criticism; and to alleviate the crush
ing weight of scholarly stress.
But a mEyority of faculty members
seem to agree that, since we students
cannot fail scholastically and know it, we
can and do fail developmentally. The "no-
F's" system acts as a crutch, artificially
shielding us from reality. It "robs the
student of self-discipline, of learning to
make a decision and see it through, ir
respective of its difficulties," argues
Chemistry Prof. James Collman, chair of
the Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement.
The F's resurrection would admittedly

be an extreme step — as was its abolition.
None of us can authoritatively argue for
or against its return. (Some have tried;
many, including The Stanford Daily and
Political Science Department Chair Step
hen Krasner, wind up discussing the dis
crete issue of grade inflation.) Instead,
we can re-examine the goals of dumping
the F and determine, first, whether
they're worthwhile, and, if so, whether
lesser measures could not fulfill them.
• Keeping low marks off transcripts.
This amounts to a fudging of one's
scholastic record — qualitatively as ob
jectionable as the age-old practice of
forging Bs out of Ds and Fs on hand
written junior high school report cards.
Stanford and Brown University, just
about the only two schools with a "no-F's"
policy, seem to think that we students
— .having done well enough in high school
to have matriculated here, by golly —
are just too good for F's. This pedagogy
offers carrots (justifiably inflated grades)
but no sticks.
• Allowing for late-term emergencies.
But that's why the Registrar allows for
the quasi-grade, "Incomplete," and that's
also why Stanford students can drop a
class up to one day before its final.
• Encouraging students to take difficult
and/or off-the-beaten-track classes. A
noble cause, but one already provided for
by the Pass/No Credit option. Taken to
its proper conclusion, the argument rails
against not only the F, but also the D,
C and perhaps the B-minus as inhibitions
to such eclecticism. If a given student
truly believes that Grades Don't Matter,
Only Learning Does, then she or he will

gladly choose the P/NC option and
trailblaze away. And no whining, please,
from students who registered for a grade
but later foresee a C, D or F (as I did
once in Human Sexuality, ahem); they
were grade-greedy, and can drop anytime
they like besides. But the P/NC option
should not shift, with the F's return, to
P/F; otherwise, its value as insurance
disappears.
In sum, the return of the F — only,
obviously, to classes whose professors
wish to wield it — would not be as bad
as it sounds to students. Provided that
the P/NC-and last-day drop safety nets
remain secura, we really don't want or
need the special handling which the "no-
F's" policy offers. This view is in the
minority among students, but quite
popular among the faculty, with out
spoken exceptions.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, whose
Shakespeare classes are perennially
packed, protectively (and a bit posses
sively) says that reinstituting the F would
have a "terrible psychological impact on
our students." We, it seems to him, are
just too fragile to deal with even the
remote possibility of failure. It seems to
me that if we screw our courage to the
sticking-place, we'll not fail.
