Budget must reflect
the important role
of TAs as educators
AS A GROUP of students con
cerned with the quality and
relevance of our Stanford educa
tion, we are dismayed with the recent
cutbacks made in the teaching assis
tant budget for the School of Humani
ties and Sciences (the largest under
graduate school in the University). The
budget was cut by 6 percent — after
adjusting for salary increases — which
means that fewer TAs will be available
to teach classes. Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Ewart Thomas asserts
that these cuts will not adversely affect
the quality of undergraduate education.
However, many students, staff and
faculty believe that the TA cutbacks
will seriously compromise the quality
of undergraduate education while also
placing undue burden on graduate TAs.
History Prof. Barton Bernstein,
believes the current TA situation "is a
University problem ... we need more
TAs, so classes that need TAs can
have them." Furthermore, Political
Science Prof. John Manley has said
that with the TA cuts "the quality of
undergraduate education at Stanford
has just been lowered" as printed in
The Daily on Dec. 2, 1988.
Because of the cuts, some depart
ments have already increased section
sizes, limited the number of TAs avail
able to professors and given more
sections to each TA. Other departments
have reassigned TAs to lower-paying,
non-teaching positions such as graders
and readers. These changes mean
larger section sizes and less time that
TAs can spend with students. A recent
University study showed that students
learn more and receive better grades in
smaller classes. These cutbacks will be
detrimental to the educational experi
ence of undergraduates.

Graduate students will also suffer,
since they now have to take on more
responsibility. TAs should be ade
quately compensated for the time and
effort they devote to teaching under
graduates. They should not be
"rewarded" with more sections, larger
section sizes and an increased workload
without comparable compensation.
We feel that quality teaching is not a
high enough priority at Stanford. Thus
the current cutbacks in the TA budget,
in the words of ASSU Senator Kather
ine Van Uum just "add insult to in
jury." Although students understand
the advantages of studying at a pres
tigious research institution like Stan
ford, many are questioning the impres
sion that excellence in research must
come at the expense of undergraduate
teaching.
We feel that we can have first-rate
research and quality teaching by using
more TAs, not by cutting back. Profes
sors who are overburdened by logistical
and administrative tasks cannot effec
tively fulfill their primary responsibili
ties as researcher and educator.
Since research is seen as a higher
priority, extra time spent with students
is going to be in jeopardy. With profes
sors' busy schedules it is not possible
for them to teach many small section
courses, and so TAs play an important
role in the undergraduate educational
experience.
The cuts in the TA budget need to
be restored to previous levels for the
remainder of the year. However, that
will not be enough. Even at last year's
level, many classes still went without
needed TAs. To further increase the
quality of teaching, there also needs to
be money set aside for developing a
TA training program similar to the one
recommended by the Faculty Senate
Committee on Academic Affairs and
Appraisal.
The budget cuts will not be restored
this year nor will increased funding be
allocated without student action. We
have called several meetings with
concerned students, faculty and staff

and are also going to be circulating a
petition for students to sign. Concerned
students are invited to get involved
with the ASSU Committee on Democ
racy in Education which meets on
Monday nights at 6 p.m. in the ASSU.

Legalized abortion
is a tragic crime
against humanity
On this 15th anniversary of the Roe
v. Wade decision that made abortion
on demand legal in America, we should
contemplate the results: the 20 million
disappeared Americans. The oldest of
these would now be teenagers with 60
years of life yet before them, the
youngest would be babes in arms with
life expectancies of over 70 years.
The innocence of these disappeared
persons is complete. No misdeed of the
unborn sealed their fate. These victims
of legalized violence threatened no one
with violence. And so, though they
never had a voice, the blood of the
disappeared cries out from the garbage
dumps of our land where we have
disposed of their bodies.
The enormity of this crime against
humanity is incomprehensible; already
it far exceeds that of the Nazi Final
Solution. In six years, Hitler murdered
six million Jews. In 15 years, America
has murdered over 20 million of her
offspring.
Human life is sacred because it
reflects the nature of God. This revela
tion was fundamental to our civiliza
tion, but we have treated human life
as rubbish for the last 15 years.
Therefore, we must acknowlede our
betrayal of this principal and repent of
it — or face God's just judgment on us
as a people.

Res Ed staff has
handled past crises
very professionally
In the article on the Office of Resi
dential Education's responses to crises,
a few Resident Feliows focused upon
the need for documents which explain
procedures and rules which specify
what happens to students when trouble
occurs.
From a mental health and systems
perspective, I say with some confidence
that far more important variables for
those responsible for responding to
these types of crises are the sophistica
tion of thinking, experience, dedication
to one's professional role and depth of
caring for the individuals involved.
On these variables, the Res Ed staff
rates very high in my judgment, and
particularly when compared to other
universities I have been associated with
or observed.
The degree of discouragement and
pain generated by the Otero and
Ujamaa incidents saddens many of us;
and the varieties of learning which
emerged from these struggles in large
part is due to the efforts of those in
the residential system, both in Res
Ed's Central Office and those resident
assistants and resident fellows on the
front line.
