Actions following
Ujamaa incident
must be discussed
I am writing in response to an arti
cle that appeared in the Jan. 24 issue
of The Daily, "Ujamaa events kept
from the public." Although brief and
almost over-cautious in its content, it
was the first in a series of long
overdue measures to be taken by the
Stanford community in response to
some of the "hidden" injustices of the
now infamous Ujamaa racial incidents.
What has been brewing in our midst
for the past four months is, in its
simplest form, a delicate game of expo
sure and coverup, of parry and thrust.
Overcome by a deluge of anti-racist
campaigns, acerbic speeches and nu
merous marches through campus, the
average student immediately feels the
obligation to proclaim himself an ar
dent civil rights activist, lest he too be
accused of being racist.
Is this to say that all of the anti
racist efforts are at fault? By all
means, No! Yet when a student reads
about the so-called "backlash," about
the personalized, vigilante-style justice
some people have exercised as a result
of the incidents, he or she still feels
the necessity to keep any feelings of
objection under lock and key, far from
the campaign's madding crowd.
Worst of all, however, is when such
fears infect the media, rendering the
central campus voice practically ineffec
tual. Once the media is crippled, there
is little to prevent the spread of a

McCarthy-like alarmism, swiftly silenc
ing any would-be voice of disagreement.
Such has been the case here, as
reports of backlash were trampled
neatly underfoot in favor of stories
about the original offenses committed
by Ben Dugan and Gus Heldt.
When the incidents broke, the Black
Student Union held as their first prio
rity the task of informing the entire
Stanford community of the actions of
Dugan and Heldt, and with good rea
son. The BSU realized and held at the
heart of their argument the all
important rule that to be silent was to
accept and even advocate the offenses
perpetrated against them.
Of course, Ujamaa would have to
experience the great deal of attention
and public scrutiny attached to the
exposure of the incident, yet that was
a necessary evil of attaining their final
end. Quite simply, both Ujamaa and
the BSU felt that exposing the actions
of Dugan and Heldt was important
enough to counterbalance the exposure
the house would receive.
True enough, when such an outra
geous offense has been committed, an
increase in public attention seems a
small price to pay for having your
equal lights protected.
Equality, however, means reciprocity
as well.
Who dares to mask the threats
against the non-black residents of
Ujamaa and still march under the ban
ner of so-called equality? According to
an article in The Daily, Ujamaa theme
associate Louis Jackson said, "There
had already been so much trauma, and
we didn't want to add to that." Jack
son was well aware of the inevitable

attention and "trauma" that was to
come with the exposure of the original
offenses, yet no opposition was offered
to that movement whatsoever.
Associate Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson was quoted as saying,
"The thinking was to see if we
couldn't let this thing die down."
Is this to be considered as a valid
reason for a news coverup?
If Dean Robinson were to suggest to
the BSU that they should just let their
cause "die down," would they have
simply turned away and ignored the
entire incident?
Unquestionably not, yet once again,
the non-black residents of Ujamaa and
the entire campus as well have now
been asked to bite their tongues and
let things pass.
A new feeling of animosity has now
surfaced as a result of the Ujamaa
incidents: it is the resentment of many
students towards the coverup of what
has come to be known as the 'back
lash.'
Rather than helping to ease the
trauma of October's incidents, it has
backfired and created a sort of "closet
protest." Unable to voice their anger
for fear of reprisal and accusation,
many students must contain their
opinions and ignore that they exist.
This trend has grown, however, to the
point where even the media subscribes
to popular sentiment rather than offer
ing its proper, equal stance.
The solution to this problem does
not involve limiting anti-racial or equal
rights efforts for to do so would be to
repeat the problem over again in
reverse.
Any attempt to interpret the com-

plaints that so many students now
express about the coverup as a way to
limit the power of either Ujamaa or
the BSU is completely mistaken.
What is needed is just what the BSU
has been calling for all along: public
exposure of the offenses committed.
Exposure not just of Dugan and Heldt,
but of the backlash incidents as well.
The Jan. 24 article is a starting point.
Now it is up to the Office of Residen
tial Education, Ujamaa and the BSU
as well to treat these secondary offen
ses with just as much attention as the
initial ones.
For the past four months, Stanford
has been trying to walk on the fine
line between equal rights and reverse
discrimination. Let us hope that we
can now hold our balance, where just
weeks ago we were wavering.

International house
will be open to all
interested students
This is written in response to the
Jan. 24 article "Possibility of interna
tional theme house discussed." The
article gives the impression that the
house is for international students only.
Also, it over-emphasizes the protective
nature of this house.
The house is not only for interna
tional students. American students will
have equal importance both in number
and also in focus of this house. The

house will provide "a challenging at
mosphere for Americans to introduce
their culture to the international stu
dents and to compare their different
values." This is quoted from the pro
posal for an international focus house.
Since students in this house will
have chosen to live there and will thus
be interested in global issues, more
projects and programs will be organ
ized. Besides formalized activities, the
house will provide an informal atmos
phere for discussions.
The focus of the house is not to
seclude and protect vulnerable interna
tional students from Americans. The
dorm will be located within a residen
tial hall and will house an equal num
ber of Americans.
We don't see how international stu
dents will not experience "normal un
dergraduate living." There is nothing
abnormal about this focus dorm. Be
sides, most students spend at least
three to four years at Stanford during
which they will choose to live in non
thematic or non-focused houses.
We would like to emphasize that the
idea behind this house is to provide a
special opportunity for a mutual ex
change of culture and values.

Associate Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson was quoted as saying,
"The thinking was to see if we
couldn't let this thing die down."
Is this to be considered as a valid
reason for a news coverup?
If Dean Robinson were to suggest to
the BSU that they should just let their
cause "die down," would they have
simply turned away and ignored the
entire incident?
Unquestionably not, yet once again,
the non-black residents of Ujamaa and
the entire campus as well have now
been asked to bite their tongues and
let things pass.
A new feeling of animosity has now
surfaced as a result of the Ujamaa
incidents: it is the resentment of many
students towards the coverup of what
has come to be known as the 'back
lash.'
Rather than helping to ease the
trauma of October's incidents, it has
backfired and created a sort of "closet
protest." Unable to voice their anger
for fear of reprisal and accusation,
many students must contain their
opinions and ignore that they exist.
This trend has grown, however, to the
point where even the media subscribes
to popular sentiment rather than offer
ing its proper, equal stance.
The solution to this problem does
not involve limiting anti-racial or equal
rights efforts for to do so would be to
repeat the problem over again in
reverse.
Any attempt to interpret the com-

plaints that so many students now
express about the coverup as a way to
limit the power of either Ujamaa or
the BSU is completely mistaken.
What is needed is just what the BSU
has been calling for all along: public
exposure of the offenses committed.
Exposure not just of Dugan and Heldt,
but of the backlash incidents as well.
The Jan. 24 article is a starting point.
Now it is up to the Office of Residen
tial Education, Ujamaa and the BSU
as well to treat these secondary offen
ses with just as much attention as the
initial ones.
For the past four months, Stanford
has been trying to walk on the fine
line between equal rights and reverse
discrimination. Let us hope that we
can now hold our balance, where just
weeks ago we were wavering.

International house
will be open to all
interested students
This is written in response to the
Jan. 24 article "Possibility of interna
tional theme house discussed." The
article gives the impression that the
house is for international students only.
Also, it over-emphasizes the protective
nature of this house.
The house is not only for interna
tional students. American students will
have equal importance both in number
and also in focus of this house. The

house will provide "a challenging at
mosphere for Americans to introduce
their culture to the international stu
dents and to compare their different
values." This is quoted from the pro
posal for an international focus house.
Since students in this house will
have chosen to live there and will thus
be interested in global issues, more
projects and programs will be organ
ized. Besides formalized activities, the
house will provide an informal atmos
phere for discussions.
The focus of the house is not to
seclude and protect vulnerable interna
tional students from Americans. The
dorm will be located within a residen
tial hall and will house an equal num
ber of Americans.
We don't see how international stu
dents will not experience "normal un
dergraduate living." There is nothing
abnormal about this focus dorm. Be
sides, most students spend at least
three to four years at Stanford during
which they will choose to live in non
thematic or non-focused houses.
We would like to emphasize that the
idea behind this house is to provide a
special opportunity for a mutual ex
change of culture and values.

Actions following
Ujamaa incident
must be discussed
I am writing in response to an arti
cle that appeared in the Jan. 24 issue
of The Daily, "Ujamaa events kept
from the public." Although brief and
almost over-cautious in its content, it
was the first in a series of long
overdue measures to be taken by the
Stanford community in response to
some of the "hidden" injustices of the
now infamous Ujamaa racial incidents.
What has been brewing in our midst
for the past four months is, in its
simplest form, a delicate game of expo
sure and coverup, of parry and thrust.
Overcome by a deluge of anti-racist
campaigns, acerbic speeches and nu
merous marches through campus, the
average student immediately feels the
obligation to proclaim himself an ar
dent civil rights activist, lest he too be
accused of being racist.
Is this to say that all of the anti
racist efforts are at fault? By all
means, No! Yet when a student reads
about the so-called "backlash," about
the personalized, vigilante-style justice
some people have exercised as a result
of the incidents, he or she still feels
the necessity to keep any feelings of
objection under lock and key, far from
the campaign's madding crowd.
Worst of all, however, is when such
fears infect the media, rendering the
central campus voice practically ineffec
tual. Once the media is crippled, there
is little to prevent the spread of a

McCarthy-like alarmism, swiftly silenc
ing any would-be voice of disagreement.
Such has been the case here, as
reports of backlash were trampled
neatly underfoot in favor of stories
about the original offenses committed
by Ben Dugan and Gus Heldt.
When the incidents broke, the Black
Student Union held as their first prio
rity the task of informing the entire
Stanford community of the actions of
Dugan and Heldt, and with good rea
son. The BSU realized and held at the
heart of their argument the all
important rule that to be silent was to
accept and even advocate the offenses
perpetrated against them.
Of course, Ujamaa would have to
experience the great deal of attention
and public scrutiny attached to the
exposure of the incident, yet that was
a necessary evil of attaining their final
end. Quite simply, both Ujamaa and
the BSU felt that exposing the actions
of Dugan and Heldt was important
enough to counterbalance the exposure
the house would receive.
True enough, when such an outra
geous offense has been committed, an
increase in public attention seems a
small price to pay for having your
equal lights protected.
Equality, however, means reciprocity
as well.
Who dares to mask the threats
against the non-black residents of
Ujamaa and still march under the ban
ner of so-called equality? According to
an article in The Daily, Ujamaa theme
associate Louis Jackson said, "There
had already been so much trauma, and
we didn't want to add to that." Jack
son was well aware of the inevitable

attention and "trauma" that was to
come with the exposure of the original
offenses, yet no opposition was offered
to that movement whatsoever.
