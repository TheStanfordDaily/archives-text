## Cooking gourmet meals to impress hot dishes 
### 
When I became a man at the
age of 13, in accordance with
ancient Jewish tradition my
father pulled me aside to pass
down the wisdom that genera
tions of the Berkowitz clan have
shared. This is wisdom, I might
point out, that has caused my
father to purchase three con
secutive American-made auto
mobiles, each manufactured in
America, for Americans, by
Americans, entirely out of balsa
wood.

But on this occasion he was
not offering advice on purchas
ing a quality vehicle. No, he was
passing on the foolproof
Berkowitz secret of how to at
tract women.
"Son," he said to me, leaning
close and pulling balsa wood
splinters out of his butt, "to at
tract women you must use 'Polo,
by Ralph Lauren.'"
Aha! "Polo." Of course! I im
mediately took his advice to
heart, and it wasn't until several
years later that I found out he
hadn't meant for me to use it
as a mouthwash. But mean
while I had discovered a new
foolproof way of attracting wom
en. I learned to cook.
Now I know what you guys
are thinking. You're thinking,
"I wonder what Paulina would
look like naked?" But you're also
thinking that there must be bet
ter ways to impress women.
Yet, I guarantee that if you
were to cook a four-course meal
for the female object of your

most lustful desires, she would
finish the meal and then, sud
denly, fall trembling to your
feet, her eyes droopily trans
fixed upon yours, a half-smile
awash upon her face. Unfortu
nately, these are the early
symptoms of food poisoning,
and in order to really impress
women you men are just going
to have to learn how to cook
properly.
And this is a problem, seeing
as how your average male
chemistry major can complete
an experiment in which several
extremely hazardous acids are
mixed in exactly the correct pro
portions in a 25-step process,
the slightest error in which will
cause a crater the size of Dela
ware to appear in place of the
laboratory, yet can't make
French toast without creating
an international incident.
OK, men, still not convinced
cooking's for you? Pay attention
to the following actual tran
scripts of real dates.
SCENE 1: A gentleman's
dining room.
Woman: "Wow, that was a
great dinner you cooked.
Thanks!"
Man: "A pleasure, my dear."
Woman: "Where did you learn
so many brilliant culinary tech
niques? The falafel was heaven
ly."
Man: "Oh, I picked up some
ideas here and there. I guess
my stint as Ambassador helped
expose me to many cultures.
Can I offer you something to
drink?"
Woman: (in a sultry voice)
Yes, please. And don't you think
it's a little bright in here?
(Turns lights off, violin music
plays.)
SCENE 2: A restaurant.
Woman: "Wow, that was a
great dinner. Thanks for. . .."
Man: (interrupting) "So you
gonna sleep with me or what,
babe?"
Woman: "Oh you creep.
(Throws drink on date, runs out
of restaurant.)

Notice how the man in the first
date is far more attractive to
his date simply because he is
able to cook.
However, besides making
women melt in your arms like
butter on a steaming piece of
freshly baked bread, the ability
to cook will also serve you well
when you leave the protective
realms of University Food Serv
ice.
In my case, living in an apart
ment causes a bit of strife be
tween my roommate and me,
because whereas I regularly
prepare gourmet meals, fab
ulous sweet breads and other
delightful treats, my roommate
only cooks three foods, assum
ing you count the Wonder Bread
in the sandwich as a food.
The most serious problems
occur when we go shopping. My
roommate, whom I'll call "Seth"
(his real name is "Carl"), wants
to purchase foods which are in
their final, ready-to-consume
state. Foods like peanut butter,
jelly, Doritos and Kraft indi
vidually-wrapped yellow Ameri
can "cheese" food plastic slices.
In contrast, I prefer to buy
foods which can later be com
bined to form new foods; stuff
like flour, sugar, yeast and
vegetable oil. So when I put,
say, a five-pound bag of flour
into the shopping cart, "Seth"
looks at me as though I had just
announced my intention to pay
money for week-old muskrat
entrails.
He is not yet clear on the
concept that cinnamon rolls do
not simply pupate from old
Wonder Bread slices.

Berkowitz's column is moving.
Next week look for it in Thurs
day's Entertainment section.
