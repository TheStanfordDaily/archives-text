# The 						nature of the University
## Weekend workshops to focus on Stanford's environmental impact 
### Jean Chen 
Everyday, the simplicity and
beauty of Stanford's environment
shines through the haze of heavy
academic schedules and appoint
ments. The harried students, pro
fessors and University personnel
rush to class. And even when they
do stop to smell the roses, they
rarely stop to think about how
long the blush of beauty will last.
Recognizing the importance
and scope of Stanford's impact on
the environment, organizers of
this weekend's "You Can Make a
Difference" conference have set
aside part of Sunday's schedule
for a trio of panel discussions
focusing exclusively on issues
close to home.
Closest to home are the sights
and sounds of daily construction.
The telltale hum of drilling and
hammering is a constant
reminder of Stanford's ambitious
plans for land use and develop
ment.
The plume of steam from the
roof of Stanford's Cogeneration
plant near Governor's Corner sig
nals the release of new, arguably
innocuous fumes into the atmos
phere. Toxic wastes must be han
dled and disposed of every day in
the University research laborato
ries.
Even Stanford's yearly invest
ment budget of $2 billion directly
affects the global environment. In
vesting in companies with ques
tionably sound environmental
practices could have far-reaching
consequences on the world beyond
the Foothills.
This Sunday's workshops on
Stanford's "environmental trans
formation" will focus on the three
issues of land management, toxic
waste disposal and investment re
sponsibility. Each workshop will
begin at 12:45 p.m. in Kresge Au
ditorium and will feature a diverse
panel of "key players" in each
field, according to Allen Brown,
a Ph.D. student at Stanford who
is organizing this portion of the
conference.

The bulldozers and cranes
never stop building on campus it
seems; the newest addition to the

constructive fervor is a plywood
fence near Herrin Hall that will
eventually enclose a new biology
building.
The site and the fence sur
rounding it are part of the Near
West Campus Development Proj
ect, the subject of a discussion by
Thomas Ford, a member of the
Stanford Trustees' Committee on
Land Use and Buildings.
The project covers 41 acres of
construction and renovation,
spanning the area between the
physics tank and Forsythe Hall.
Work on nine buildings is ex
pected to take 15 years to com
plete.
Although he works for a large
company, Ford has a "reputation
as an environmental developer,"
according to Allen Brown.
Davis mayor Michael Corbett
who is also an urban planning
consultant, will also address the
topic of long-term land use plan
ning.
The city of Davis is the site of
Village Homes, an innovative
housing complex developed about
10 years ago. Village Homes was
the first solar subdivision in the
United States.
"There are community gardens,
few through streets, bike paths,
cul-de-sacs . .. they've really cut
down on pavement," said Brown.
"It's just got a warm feeling to
it. It's a very (environmentally)
conscious design."
In the same panel, Enid Pear
son, the leader of People for Open
Space and a former Palo Alto City
Council member, will speak about
balancing land conservation and
development.
"They're saying [Stanford's
development] won't have a lot of
influence on its neighbors, and
that's impossible," she said.
"Stanford is not giving any lead
ership to the rest of the country"
in the ecological use of land.
Hazardous waste
Imagining toxics in a laboratory
is easy, but dealing with them is
not. Alain DeCleve, director of
Stanford's Health and Safety De
partment, will speak about hazar
dous materials disposal in Uni
versity laboratory facilities.
"We are gearing up to a better

comprehensive management of
the whole process" of dealing with
hazardous materials, he said.
A little more difficult to imagine
is the impact of industrial waste
on the Stanford community. Toxic
seepage into the local water table
from the Stanford Research Park
is controversial and, according to
Brown, summer residents at Stan
ford were drinking groundwater
drawn from that area.
Ken Sutherland, the corporate
environmental manager for
Hewlett-Packard, and John Joynt,
president of the Barron Park As
sociation, will represent the com
panies in the industrial park that
rent land from Stanford and are
sometimes accused of being pol
luters.
Along with them, Mark Wilson,
an engineer for the California Re
gional Water Quality Control
Board for the San Francisco
region will represent the state's
perspective on groundwater con
tamination.
Corporate questions
Ted Mitchell, chair of the Trus
tees' Committee on Investment
Responsibility, will join three rep
resentatives from investment
firms in a discussion titled "En
vironmental Responsibility and
Stanford's Corporate Invest
ments."
Representing one of the largest
venture capital firms in the coun
try, Stanford graduate Nancy
Pfund will discuss environment
ally-responsible investment strat
egies.
Pfund's employer, Hamburg &
Quist, claims to invest in com
panies that "find ways around
toxics or find ways to use them
and then get rid of them," Brown
said.
Working Assets, another one of
the investment firms represented,
claims to have set up a money
market fund that avoids compan
ies that make weapons, pollute,
discriminate or support apartheid.
Instead, it invests in housing,
farming, education and small
businesses.
Working Assets also offers a
credit card which contributes rev
enue to environmental causes, ac
cording to Brown.
