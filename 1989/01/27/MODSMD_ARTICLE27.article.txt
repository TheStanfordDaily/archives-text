Put 'em on ice
Ya' love Disney; ya' love ice. Now they're
united in Walt Disney's "Magic Kingdom on
Ice," at the Oakland Coliseum Feb. 7-13 and
at the Cow Palace Feb. 15-20.
This extravagant production follows the story
of Pinocchio, the little wooden puppet who is
brought to life by the wishes of the kindly old
woodcarver named Geppetto, and an NHL
scout named Vinnie. The musical score in
cludes such Disney classics as "When You
Wish Upon a Star," "Give a Little Whistle" and
"Oh Canada."
Tickets are available pretty much everywhere.
