# DANCE
## A 						new song and dance routine 
### 
By Georgi Haynes
Unless you've ever dropped acid at
the ballet, chances are tonight's per
formance by ISO and The Bobs is going
to resemble nothing you've ever seen
before.
ISO (Daniel Ezralow, Jamey
Hampton, Ashley Roland and Morleigh
Steinberg), a psuedo-modern dance
troupe that dropped out of MOMIX a
few years ago, is said to "blur the line
between modern dance, acrobatic spec
tacle and new vaudeville." And when
ISO teams up with San Francisco's
Grammy-nominated a capella vocal
quartet, The Bobs, that line isn't just
blurred — it's completely obliterated.

Together the groups
create a sort of Modern
Dance Meets MTV

The most original dance troupe in
America isn't just working with any
typical quartet. The Bobs, who have
performed with the Grateful Dead,
Robin Williams, Frank Zappa and more,
sing modern lyrics to pop oldies and
new tunes, replete with backup instru
ments and sound effects courtesy of the
vocal chords of Richard "Bob" Greene,
Gunnar "Bob" Madsen, Matthew "Bob"
Stull and Janie "Bob" Scott. The New
York Times called The Bobs "sort of a
cross between Devo and the Mills Broth
ers.
Together, the groups create a sort of
Modern Dance Meets MTV. Gymnastic,
acrobatic, contortionist dances mesh
with elastic ropes, pulleys, Venetian
blinds, auto headlamps, shadows and
costumes, all accompanied by the

charming wit belted out by The Bobs,
from postmodern Jimi Hendrix to "Hel
ter Skelter."
Besides performing, ISO (stands for
"I'm so optimistic") are accomplished
choreographers, having created music
videos for Sting, John Fogerty, U2 and
Simply Red, as well as commercials.
The Bobs frequently appear on Na

tional Public Radio's "Morning Edi
tion," and have been seen in a one-hour
PBS special and on the "Smother's
Brothers Show."

Iso and The Bobs perform tonight at 8
p.m. in Memorial Auditorium. The show
is completely sold out. If you have tick
ets, enjoy!


If you count very carefully you will actually see nine legs in this photo. Catch
ISO and The Bobs tonight at Memorial Auditorium.
