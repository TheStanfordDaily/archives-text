During Monday's program, the company

Miller's work with contemporary American
composers.
Miller's choreography is for three men
and three women. It is intricate, fast and
legato, surging with energy and wit. It

explores contemporary themes and the
complex nature of the human situation.

Wiener's dance company.
In 1982 Miller reached out on her own
to create what has become one of the most
respected dance troupes in the country.
