# UCMI report delayed another month

Those eager to read the weighty 225-
page final report of the University Com
mittee on Minority Issues will have to
wait another month, because the docu
ment's release has been delayed for the
third time.
By the third week of February the
report should be on the desks of Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy and
Provost James Rosse, UCMI Chair Al
bert Camarillo said yesterday.
When the committee first convened
a year and a half ago as a result of
minority protests, the deadline for its
work was Oct. 1, 1988. However, last
spring, the committee realized it
couldn't make that date, so a new dead
line was set for the beginning of Jan
uary.

The report ended up as 'a
mammoth manuscript of
355 pages.'

The latest delay, according to
Camarillo, comes from the unexpectedly
lengthy final draft, which is still being
edited.
"We had estimated originally a docu
ment of about 150 manuscript pages in
length . . Camarillo said yesterday in
a prepared statement, "but we ended
up instead with a mammoth manuscript
of 355 pages and approximately 60
tables and graphs."
Neither Kennedy nor Rosse were
worried about the delays.
"So far as I know, it's only to make

it better," Kennedy said. Rosse added
that the committee should take its time
with the report.
The final report, according to
Camarillo, will be in two parts: a 25-
page summary of UCMI's mtyor find
ings and recommendations and a 200-
page full report. Both parts will be avail
able to faculty, staff and students.
Camarillo called UCMI's project an
"enormous effort," with input from all
17 committee members. The report will
have wide impact on universities across
the country, he said, calling it "a model
to universities if they're really serious
about understanding the dynamics of
race and ethnic relations."
Several universities have already
asked for copies of the report, Camarillo
said, including the universities of Wis
consin and Michigan, Cornell and UC-
Berkeley.
