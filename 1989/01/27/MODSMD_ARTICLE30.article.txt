pathos!
You came to the wrong place.
Stanford beat Oregon at Maples
Pavilion last night 75-53, in a
topsy-turvy, shoot-'em-up,
rockin'-'till-the-end nailbiter, and
any basketball fan would have
been riveted by the affair.

Cardinal 75, Ducks 53

No, that's a lie. Actually, the
No. 19 Cardinal (15-4 overall, 7-2
in the Pac-10), in its prelude to
Sunday's showdown at Arizona,
had to fight off §leep and
withstand the slowdown tactics of
the Ducks, but eventually broke
open a game that was 34-28 at
halftime.
"It was kind of an ugly game,
but those things happen some
times," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said.
To Montgomery, and the alleged
sellout crowd of 7,500 at Maples,
it was ugly. Paul Westhead, coach
of the high-scoring Loyola Mary
mount Lions, would have been
shielding his eyes from the horror.
Basically, the game plan of
Oregon (7-10, 2-5) was to come
out, work the 45-second shot clock
down to about 20, and then try
to work for a good shot.
What was even uglier for Stan
ford basketball fans was that in
the first half, Oregon would
usually get that good shot on a
backdoor layup. Despite making
only one outside shot in the half,
the Ducks only trailed by six at
halftime.
"We were playing defense, play
ing defense, playing defense," said
Stanford forward Howard Wright,
who led the Cardinal with 19
points, 10 rebounds and three
blocked shots. "It seemed like
forever. Then in the last 10
seconds, they'd slip a bounce pass
down. ~. It'd take your legs out
from undef you."
Said Montgomery: "The prob
lem was, we were of the opinion
that since they (Oregon) weren't
going to play for the first 25-30
seconds of the shot clock, they
weren't going to play for the last
15.
"Oregon did pretty much what
they wanted to do," Montgomery
commented. "It was an excellent
game plan in that [Oregon Coach
Don Monson] tried to shorten the

game, take our crowd out of it. . . .
It accomplished exactly what the
spread court is capable of."
The success of the semi-stall
meant that with just over two
minutes to go in the half, 18-point
underdog Oregon trailed by only
one, 28-27. And though Stanford
went into the locker room with a
six-point lead, the Cardinal still
had to face the fact that it was
allowing the Ducks, a team that
has shot over 50 percent only
twice this season, to shoot 60 per
cent in the first 20 minutes.
Who knows how long the chess
match might have lasted had
Stanford not left that locker room
with enough of a spark to score
the first seven points of the second
half? After a free throw by
Wright, Todd Lichti (15 points)
and Eric Reveno (11 points) each
were fouled while converting
drives to the hoop, and each came
away with three-point plays to
give Stanford a 41-28 lead.
Once the Webfoots got behind,
they had to abandon their delay
game and play catchup, with dire
results. Oregon shot only 8-for-32
in the second half and ended up
at 38.5 percent for the game.
