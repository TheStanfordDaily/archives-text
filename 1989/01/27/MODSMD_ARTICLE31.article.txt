# Cardinal defense gets the job done

Zzzzzzz. Zzzzzzz. Zzzzzzz.
Right before the tipoff of last
night's contest between Stanford
and Oregon, the student section
unrolled a 40-foot long sign that
read "Hey Alums: Stand up and
CHEER."
It was a valiant attempt to get
the Maples fans behind the Car
dinal in the hopes of propelling
them to victory.
Then the tipoff came, and
Oregon immediately went into a
slowdown offense. It would be
hard to fault the alumni for not
screaming and yelling. It would
be hard to fault them had they
fallen asleep.
Fortunately for Stanford, after
some early defensive lapses, the
Cardinal awakened and slowly
began pulling away from the
Ducks. And, with 9:50 to go, at
the time when Oregon Coach Don
Monson may have hoped his
troops would be in position to pull
out a close one, Stanford led 53-
35.
That forced the Ducks to aban
don their four-corners style of
fense and play toe-to-toe with the
Cardinal. To no one's surprise,
the Ducks weren't up to the taak
and fell by a final score of 75-53.
At halftime, Stanford led by
only six, at 34-28. "[Coach
Montgomery] came in and said
we were relaxing on the defensive
end," guard Terry Taylor said,
adding that the Cardinal allowed
Oregon to attack and make some
easy shots.
"He told us to let [the clock]
run down and when it got under
20, get into them and make sure
they take a tough shot."
Apparently, the message sunk
in. The Ducks, who blistered the
nets with 60 percent shooting in
the first half, managed to sink
only 8-of-32 second-half shots â€”
or 25 percent.
For the game, Stanford held
Oregon to 38.5 percent shooting.
That marked the seventh time
this season Cardinal opponent*
have shot under 40 percent and
the 13th time opponents have
made less than half their field
goals.
It was the kind of uplifting de
fensive effort the team will need
for Sunday's showdown at Arizo
na.
