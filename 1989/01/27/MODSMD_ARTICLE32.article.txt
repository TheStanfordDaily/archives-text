# Cardinal faces Pac-10 showdown in Arizona
## 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
"Beat Arizona! Beat Arizona!
Beat Arizona!"
The Stanford men's basketball
team could not have put it any
simpler or more appropriately
than the Maples Pavilion crowd
did as Stanford closed out its 75-
53 win over Oregon last night.
Beat Arizona. Win the Pacific
10 Conference title.
Sunday at 3:00 p.m., second
place Stanford, 7-2 in the Pac-10,
plays the Arizona Wildcats, 8-1 in
conference play, at McKale Center
in Tucson. And while it may be
only the halfway point of the Pac
-10 season, it's no secret that the
season is coming to a head.
"This is for the Pac-10 title,"
Stanford senior forward Howard
Wright said. "Arizona knows that,
and we know that. I just hope we
can rise to the occasion."
Even though each team has
eight conference games left after
this contest, it is almost un
avoidable that the winner of this
game will win the Pac-10.
After playing Arizona, Stanford
will have completed the difficult
part of its schedule. The toughest
remaining games the Cardinal has
are against California at home and
Oregon State on the road. It's
definitely possible, but relatively
unlikely, that Stanford would lose
any of its regular-season games
following the Arizona contest.
Therefore, a Stanford win Sun
day means that even if Arizona
won the rest of its games, Stan
ford would probably end the
season tied with the Wildcats at
16-2. So, the Cardinal would win
the Pac-10 on the virtue of having
beaten Arizona twice this season.
Stanford beat Arizona 83-78 on
Jan. 5.
However, if Arizona wins on
Sunday, the Wildcats would be in
the driver's seat and no one could
pull them over. The Wildcats
would be coasting through the
easy part of their Pac-10 season
with a two-game lead in the con
ference.
The only game there's even a
chance the Wildcats could lose is

at UCLA in the season's last
weekend — by then they would
have probably clinched the con
ference title already.
Of course, the automatic berth
to the NCAA playoffs goes to the
winner of the Pac-10 Tournament
in Los Angeles Mar. 9-12. But
since both these teams have all
but locked up NCAA bids, the real
championship game is Sunday.
For Stanford, the odds of turn
ing this game into an early victory
celebration are longer than Ari
zona forward Sean Elliott's list of
basketball heroics.
Arizona has won 28 straight
games at McKale Center, which
will once again seat 13,124 fervent
fans to witness Sunday's affair.
To break that home winning
streak, Stanford will have to avoid
digging the holes it has dug for
itself in its last two games with
the Wildcats: falling behind 16-2
on its way to a 97-83 loss in the
Pac-10 tourney last year, and
trailing 21-4 before rallying to win
at Maples three weeks ago.
"I think we have gotten in trou
ble by turning the ball over, and
letting them run on the break,"
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "[McKale] is a tough
place to play, no question. We've

played well on the road; the prob
lem is maybe we haven't played
40 minutes of good basketball on
the road. The thing we have to
do is start the game with some
poise."
A spearhead of Arizona's 21-4
run to start the last Stanford-
Arizona battle was All-America
candidate Elliott, who exploded
for 35 points in the game. It took
an extraordinary effort by Stan
ford guard Todd Lichti, who also
scored 35 — 27 in the second half
— to counter it. Elliott and team
mate Anthony Cook (16.5 ppg, 7.3
rpg) are definitely the keys to Ar
izona's offense.
"The less Elliott has the ball
in his hands, the better I'm going
to feel," Montgomery said. Then,
after a pause, he shrugged his
shoulders and added, "How you're
gonna do that remains to be seen."
Stanford guard Terry Taylor of
fered no answers, but also em
phasized that the Cardinal's taf«k
is to keep the ball out of Elliott
and Cook's hands.
"If the guards beat us from out
side, that's what it's gonna be,"
Taylor said.
If the Cardinal wins, it will be
the latest, "Most Extraordinary
Victory in Stanford History."
