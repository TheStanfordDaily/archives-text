# Might there be a miracle in McKale?

McKale will rock, but
the Cardinal will
Yes, it's Clash of the
Titans time in the Pacific
10 Conference men's basket
ball race, time for the much
awaited Stanford-Arizona
rematch. Or, in the eyes of
many (Stanford faithful in
cluded) the eve of Wildcat
revenge.

Don't head to the bookie
yet: Arizona may not be the
safest bet. Though Sean El
liott and company have been
unbeatable at home, Stan
ford may well be the team
that breaks their 28-0
McKaJe Center streak.
No, I do not call Fantasy
Island my home. Thanks for
asking.
This presumptuous piece
of patriotic prognostication
is based on the following
precept: Stanford is a lot
better team now than one
month ago, improved
enough to turn the impossi
ble dream into a joyous
reality.
It is undeniably true that
Arizona deserves to be
labeled the favorite. Sean El
liott is one of the beat all
around players in the nation
and will give Hank "The
Bank" Gathers of Loyola
Marymount (the nation's


EVAN TUCHINSKY
leader in both rebounding and
scoring) a battle for Player of the
Year honors.
The Cobra has a good comple
ment in Anthony Cook, who has
graduated from the Manute 80l
school of shot blocking and added
consistent scoring to his reper
toire. Inside, he is a force.
Compounding the Cardinal's
problem is an arena and crowd
that is intimidating and just bas
ically hard to deal with. No matter
how composed a player is, 13,124
yelling fans are hard to ignore.
Translation: 28-0.
Fine, Arizona is tough at home.
So are the Lakers, but somehow
the Knicks managed to strip Los
Angeles of its home-court hegem
ony. There is no reason that Stan
ford cannot do the same.

In fact, there are several
reasons that suggest that the
Cardinal will do the same.
The first is a man legally named
Todd Lichti but better known as
The God (no blasphemy intended).
Lichti has been playing some
incredible basketball this year. He
was expected to be a star, but he
has since become a supernova.
Lichti on the free-throw line is
the same as points on the board,
and from the floor he has found
similar success.
In the last several games, how
ever, he has not been the same
— he has played well, but not up
to the dream-like standard he es
tablished earlier this season. One
could cite double-coverage or the
dreaded Law of Averages (i.e. you
can't always get what you want),
but something has been missing
in Lichti's play of late.
Lichti is due for another stellar
game, and Arizona should be that
contest. When the going gets

tough, Lichti plays amazingly; it
doesn't get much tougher than
this.
The God, however, is not the
Cardinal'B trump card in
this case. Last month, Ari
zona Coach Lute Olson saw just
how amazing Lichti can be and
will prepare his team accordingly.
The card up the Cardinal's
sleeve is the improved play of its
big men, especially Adam Keefe.
During the stint when Lichti was
not as domineering, the post
players picked up the slack and
brought home the wins. Stanford
played in games, not Lichti high
light films.
In Jon Weisman's article on the
Arizona game at Maples Pavilion,
Keefe was mentioned one time
only — in the last sentence. His
noteworthy act: he, not Howard
Wright, hugged Lichti at the end
of the game.
Times have changed, and so has

Keefe. In one short month, he has
turned into one tough player,
knocking people around in the
middle and hitting the boards like
home run pitches. Big Red is a
terror disguised as a freshman —
a big freshman.
Then there is the wild card,
Howard Wright. Wright is unbe
lievable when he is motivated, and
there is no bigger motivation than
a conference crown. He could be
the extra boost the Cardinal of
fense will need to compensate for
the Cobra-Cook combo.
Combined with long-distance
bomber Terry Taylor and the
remainder of the roster, the post
players form the foundation of a
strong team. Arizona has yet to
see the Stanford team at its best;
it may very well see that team
tomorrow.
The outlook for the Arizona
game, then, is not as bleak
as expected. Yes, Arizona
probably should win, but don't bet
your tuition money that they will.
Consider one last thing: If Ar
izona loses, the 'Cats are tied with
the Cardinal for first in the
league. By virtue of having beaten
Arizona twice, however, Stanford
would surely be the top seed in
the Pac-10 Tourney with a better
chance of winning it all.
The stakes don't get much
higher. Bet at will.
