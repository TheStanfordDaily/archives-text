# Baseball opens season at Santa Clara
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Editorial staff 
No one doubts that in order
to win its third consecutive na
tional championship, the Stan
ford baseball team will have to
beat some pretty tough oppo
nents.
But no one thought the bar
rage would start so soon.
Today the Cardinal plays its
first of 44 games against teams
that are ranked in the top 30
by the ESPN/Collegiate Baseball
poll (that same poll tapped Stan
ford as its preseason No. 1). And
the two-game weekend series
against No. 29 Santa Clara will
be no walk in the park.
The Broncos return a core of
seven starters from last year's
squad, four of whom batted over
.300. Santa Clara Coach John
Oldham, whose team finished
43-18-1 last year, feels that he
has three of the best players in
the country in catcher Troy
Buckley, shortstop Matt Toole
and Ed Giovanola.
Responding to Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess' prediction that
Santa Clara would be one of the
top teams in the country this
year, however, Oldham said
"[His purpose] was to give us
an overpowering sense of op
timism."
He added that the Broncos
would not be gunning for the
Cardinal more than it would for
any other team this year. "While
playing against the national
champion is a natural high, one
of the things we really don't

want to do is to point to a par
ticular game," he said.
If Santa Clara has a weakness,
it is pitching. The Broncos lost
two pitchers to graduation who
accounted for 26 of their 43
wins. Returning pitchers include
righthander Greg Gohr (8-6,
5.36 ERA last season), who will
start Friday's game, and
righthander Larry Donahe (6-2,
4.15), who takes the hill on Sat
urday.
One Stanford player who will
figure prominently in this week
end's series and the rest of the
season is center fielder Eric
DeGraw. He was the Cardinal's
best defensive outfielder last
season, but eryoyed only modest
success at the plate, batting .271
in 140 at bats.
Marquess has decided, at least
temporarily, to eliminate the
platoon system in center this
season, which puts added pres
sure on DeGraw to produce of
fensively.
"I take a lot of pride in my
defense, but I definitely think
I'm going to contribute more of
fensively," DeGraw said.
"This year my role will change.
I'm going to be more aggressive
at the plate and not take as
many pitches as last year. I
definitely want to play every
day,"he said.
In center, DeGraw will be a
lynehpin of one of the nation's
best outfields that includes
preseason All-America Paul

Carey. "There's a lot of unity in
the outfield. We want to be
known for our defense. We hate
to see a ball drop, so we call
ourselves The Sponge' in prac
tice," DeGraw said.
The senior predicted a tough
series against the Broncos.
"They (Santa Clara) are always
ready for us. They plan their
first three weeks to prepare for
us."
Stanford will likely start soph
omore Mike Mussina (9-4, 4.44
ERA last season), on Friday and
either Stan Spencer (7-2, 3.19)
or Brian Keyser (3-0, 6.27) on
Sunday. None of them need
worry about a sinking line drive
to the outfield; "The Sponge"
will be there to suck it up.
