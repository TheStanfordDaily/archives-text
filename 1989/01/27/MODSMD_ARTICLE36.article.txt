# Men's volleyball hosts alumni tourney

### John Kirks Staff writer 
Stanford's men's volleyball
team takes one final deep breath
this weekend before entering the
bulk of its regular-season
schedule. Saturday night, the Car
dinal will play a three-game ex
hibition match against, as coach
Fred Sturm phrases it,"the
toughest Stanford Volleyball
alumni team ever assembled."

The match not only will allow this
year's varsity to have some fun
against some of Stanford's most
illustrious alums but also will
serve as a final tuneup for the
team's extremely demanding
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association regular-season
schedule.
At 3 p.m. on Saturday, activities
will get under way with a round
robin tournament involving as
many as six teams, each with a

mix of varsity and alumni players.
At 5:30 is the main event â€” var
sity vs. alumni. The alumni team
will be comprised of such quality
players as John Root '86 (Olympic
gold medalist), Chris Braun (U.S.
National team member since '87),
and varsity assistant coaches
Ruben Nieves, John McDermott,
and Craig Lauchner (former All-
American).
After the weekend's festivities,
Stanford will waste no time in

plunging headlong into the
whirlwind that is its WIVA
schedule. The Cardinal will host
the No. 1-ranked Hawaii Rain
bows at Maples in a two-match
set on Monday and Tuesday
nights. After the first serve of the
first match, all of the preseason
hype that has surrounded the
Cardinal team will be thrown out
the window. It's proving time for
Stanford, a chance to evaluate just
how good this year's team is.
