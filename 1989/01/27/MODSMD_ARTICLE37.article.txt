# Grapplers tackle Humboldt State
## 
### Greg Gottesman Staff writer 
Dorothy said it best: "There's
no place like home."
Indeed, after a two-month
respite from home competition,
Stanford's wrestling team
prepares to square off against
Humboldt State tonight at 7:30
p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
Stanford Coach Chris Horpel
expects a close match with Hum
boldt. "We have pretty even
teams. Because we don't match
up well with them, we are going
to try a few changes in the
lineup," he said. "Five or 10
matches could go either way. ...
It's going to be a close dual meet
no matter who wins it."
Because of the changes in the
lineup, three Cardinal wrestlers
will move up in weight class. Mark
Graham will move from 167 lbs.
to 177 lbs., Steve Buddie from

177 lbs. to 190 lbs., and Ron Perry
from 190 lbs. to the heavyweight
division. All three wrestlers will
return in their original weight
classes for the "All Cal" Invita
tional Saturday at San Francisco
State University.
Other members of the Cardinal
starting lineup include Dave
Nowick (118 lbs.), Mark Forman
(126 lbs.), Josh Lisle (134 lbs.),
James Dinette (142 lbs.), Geoff
Baum (150 lbs.), Mat Nowlis (158
lbs.) and Steve Yarbrough (167
lbs.).
Presently, Stanford's dual meet
record stands at 5-2-1, while
Humboldt State maintains a 10-
2-2 record.
"This is a really big home meet.
We've been averaging up to 300
people, but we would like to draw
around 500. That would definitely
help the team's performance,"
Horpel concluded.
