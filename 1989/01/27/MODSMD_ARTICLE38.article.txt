# Gymnasts in Seattle
## 
### Andrew von Nordenflycht Staff writer 
After an encouraging opening
weekend at Fullerton State and
California, the Stanford women's
gymnastics team will hit the road
again this Saturday to take on
the University of Washington.
The team can expect some
tough competition in their second
conference meet simply because
it is a conference meet. Perenially
tough, the Pacific 10 regularly
places about seven teams in the
nation's Top-20. Coach Homer
Sardina said the conference is
"anybody's ballgame."
Nor will being at Washington
be very beneficial as the Cardinal
has yet to defeat the Huskies in
Seattle. Stocked with considerable
talent, including two Canadian
gymnasts with international ex

last weekend, and Sardina expects
a performance near 185 this Sat
urday.
But Sardina also hopes to see
his team score between 184 and
185. The key will be hitting

routines with increased consis

cent on floor, like we did last
weekend," Sardina commented,
adding that he also wants an 80
percent hitting percentage in the
other events.
"We need to clean up the
routines . . . and overcome the
nervousness" he said.
Fortunately, a good deal of the
nervousness will have been dis
pelled now that the gymnasts
have two meets behind them.
Nerves have been replaced by an
eagerness to build on last week
end's performances.
Nicki Kobrine, one of two fresh
men competing in Saturday's
meet, said she was "excited to
pick up what we missed."
Also bolstering the Cardinal's
chances is the return of Denise
Villars, who will compete in the
balance beam, floor and uneven
bars events. Joining Villars, fresh
men Kobrine and Adriana Duffy
will be team co-captains Dina
Amoroso and Sheri Evenson, who
