# Hoopsters hunt Ducks, Beavers
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Where, besides Maples Pavilion,
does the Stanford women's bas
ketball team enjoy a home-court
advantage? In Oregon, of course.
Thanks to a tandem of starting
forwards that hail from the Bea
ver State, the Cardinal has found
Oregon and Oregon State to "be
friendlier places to play in the past
several seasons. Trisha Stevens of
Philomath and Katy Steding of
Lake Oswego have endeared the
local crowd to the Cardinal-clad
Pacific 10 Conference rivals.
For Stevens especially, the trip
holds special significance. Raised
an inbounds-pass away from Cor
vallis, the Oregon State game pro
vides an opportunity to revisit the
sight of her high school glory and
woo a hometown crow'd of family
and friends.
"I think I play just the same,
but it's just a feeling of going
back and playing in front of people
who have watched me since I was
in fifth grade," Stevens said. "I
want to play well just because I
want them to know that I've con
tinued to work hard."
She can also get in some "I told
you so's." Stevens was highly
recruited by the local schools, and
her migration to the south was
sorely felt. A high school Ail-
American, Stevens' power post

play would have greatly aided the
small, perimeter-oriented Beavers
or meshed well with the towering
Ducks.
Instead Stevens, like Steding
one year earlier, opted for the un
heralded Stanford basketball
team, a program in transition that
finished 14-14 her senior year in
high school.

was in fifth grade'
â€” Trisha Stevens

"A lot of people, when I told
them I wanted to go to Stanford,
were like 'Why do you want to go
there? Look at their record,' "
Stevens said. "Now we're [sixth]
in the nation. No one can have
any doubts that it was the right
decision now."
The one potential drawback at
first was, surprisingly, the trips
home. While Stevens relished the
opportunity to see her family, she

was not overly excited to face a
crowd that might not greet her
with enthusiasm.
Defection is never smiled upon,
and giving your touted services
to a rival is tantamount to defec
tion. For this reason, Stevens was
not sure whether the crowd would
bring pompons or lynching rope.
"At first I was worried, because
you hear that people go home and
get all the boos," Stevens said.
"But when I got there, I was
happy because the people were
really supportive.

"It was a friendly crowd, at least
at Oregon State. I looked up in
the crowd and saw all my friends
and old teachers. It was a great
feeling."
Card notes
Junior guard Jennifer Azzi has re
covered completely from the knee in
jury inflicted in the California game
last Friday. Azzi was kneed in the
knee by an unknown defender in des
cent after scoring on a coast-to-coast
steal play, but is just fine now.
