# Seifert to fill Walsh's shoes Former Stanford assistant coach gets 49ers' top job

It's been quite a week for George Seifert,
the new head coach of the San Francisco
49ers.
Seifert, who began the week as the 49ers'
defensive coordinator, celebrated his 49th
birthday on Sunday with San Francisco's
20-16 win over the Cincinnati Bengals in
Super Bowl XXIII. Then, four days later,
he was picked to replace Bill Waish, who
stepped down after 10 seasons as head
coach.
Seifert has been a defensive assistant at
San Francisco since 1980. Previously, he
was an assistant at Stanford during Walsh's
two-year stint as the Cardinal coach.
"A very lofty standard has been estab

lished in this organization and by Bill
Walsh, one I look forward to maintaining,"
Seifert said at a news conference Thursday.
"I believe we can continue to produce the
type of team that San Francisco will be
proud of."
San Francisco owner Eddie De√üartolo
Jr. called Seifert "without question the
foremost defensive conch in the country. . . .
I know he (Seifert) is going to go down as
one of the best coaches in history."
The day after the Super Bowl, Walsh
heaped praise on Seifert, who until yester
day was a leading candidate for the
Cleveland Browns' head-coaching position.
The 49ers' win over the Bengals was
credited in great part to Seifert, who
prepared the defense so well that Cincin
nati's controversial "no-huddle" offense
played no part in the game.
