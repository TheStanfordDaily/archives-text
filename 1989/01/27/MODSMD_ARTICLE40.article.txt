DUCK UPDATE - Carrying much of the load for the Ducks has been

West Germany, leads the team with 16.8 points per game and 9.9
rebounds per game, as well as leading the league with 4.1 blocks.

second in the first two categories with 14 ppg and 7.8 rpg.
BEAVER UPDATE — Like last season, AII-Pac-10 guard Chelle Flamoe
has borne much of Oregon State's burden. The senior tops her team
with 17.2 ppg and 3.9 rpg Forward Yasmin Gray rates second on
the squad with 9.6 ppg and 3.8 rpg.
CARDINAL UPDATE — Juniors Katy Stedlng and Jennifer Azzi continue
to dominate the Cardinal statistically. Steding is the team's top scorer
and rebounder with averages of 15.3 ppg and 6.1 rpg. Azzi is a close
second in scoring with 15.1 ppg, but is the distant leader in assists
(6.4 per game) and steals (4 4 per game). Triaha Steven*, Steding's
counterpart at starting forward, also boasts a scoring average in
double figures with 10.5 ppg.
KEYS TO VICTORY — Stanford has two very different games on its
hands. Tonight, the Cardinal must hold its own inside in order to win.
Kasperski and McCartney are two tough post players that simply must
be contained, though Stanford's strong outside game could compen
sate for troubles inside. Against Oregon State, a small and scrappy
team with tough guards and a constant full-court press, Stanford will
need to use its speed and ball control to avoid costly turnovers. Once
inside, however, the Cardinal should have an easy time scoring as
none of the starters are larger than 6-foot-1. If the Cardinal maintains
its level of play, the road trip should be a sweep.
