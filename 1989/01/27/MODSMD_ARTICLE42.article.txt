Homecoming will be much
sweeter this time around for
swimmer Byron Burson.
The last time the junior Ail-
American returned to Dallas
was to take a break from com
petition after failing to make
the Olympic squad last August.
Today Burson , along with seven
teammates, is looking to make
his NCAA cuts while competing
in the Dallas Morning News
Classic.
, 0* IU„
in tnei 00-yard fly ana 200 in
dividual medley at the national
championships during both his
freshman and sophomore sea
sons on the Farm, Burson
decided to stop out last spring
quarter to train for the Olympic
Trials. Instead of returning to
train with his club coach in
Piano, a suburb of Dallas, he
remained at Stanford to con

tinue working out with Stanford
Coach Skip Kenney.
Joining teammates Jay Mor
tenson and Jeff Kostoff on Team
USA was just not to be. Burson
got off to too slow of a start in
the 200 IM, and finished out of
the running in 13th.
"I told myself don't work the
first lap too fast but I played a
mind game on myself and didn't
swim fast enough," Burson
reflected. "I definitely was
bummed at myself because I
know I could have placed bet
ter."
So it was back to Dallas for

- relaxation after over a year
of continuous swimming. The
IMer, butterflier and freestylist
almost never made it out of the
heart of Texas, however. Heavily
recruited by Stanford, Southern
Methodist and Texas, he was
leaning towards staying in his
home city and attending SMU.
"I had meets at SMU in high

school and I really liked hanging
with the guys there. I came out
to Stanford just to prove to
myself that I didn't want to go
here. But when I took a trip to
SMU after I returned it just
didn't quite stack up," Burson
said.
With trials behind him, Bur
son's next goal is to make it to
the finals (by finishing in the
top eight after preliminary
heats) in all three of his events
at this year's national champi
onships in April. After making
it to the consolation finals
(ninth through 16th plages) the
past two years, he pi&nson quai
ifying for the big leagues in the
200 IM, 200 fly, and 100 free
in Indianapolis. "It's time for
me to finally step up and make
it to the finals and score some
points for the team," Burson
said.
