# Simmons leads 'Cat swimmers

### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
For Cheryl Simmons, it's been
a short trip to the top in the long
haul.
Simmons, a sophomore at Ari
zona, entered the realm of dis
tance swimming less than five
years ago but she is already
among the best, and getting bet
ter.

The second-ranked Stanford
women swim at 13th-ranked Ar
izona today before meeting 6th
ranked Arizona State tomorrow
in Tempe.
"In the spring of 1984 I began
swimming distances," Simmons
said. "I first started swimming
when I was five, but I didn't really
swim the long events. I took a
two-year break from swimming
when I was 11, then when I came

back I started swimming dis
tances. It was just something I
was good at, I guess."
That's putting it mildly. After
a fine high school career, Sim
mons entered Arizona and imme
diately began to turn some heads.
Last season she placed second
to Florida Olympian Tami Bruce
in both the 500-yard and 1,650
freestyles at the NCAA Champi
onships, almost pulling out a vic
tory in the later after trailing by
as much as 20 yards midway
through the race.
At tne Olympic Trials in August
Simmons made the consolation
finals (for places nine through 16)
in both the 400- and 800-meter
freestyles but was somewhat dis
pleased with the result. "They
were sort of a disappointment,"
she said. "It wasn't bad.... It
was neat to be there, but it was
kind of a disappointment."
But Simmons bounced back and
is off to a great start this season.
She has already posted an NCAA
qualifying time in the 500 free
style and is hoping to improve her
placings at the national meet by

one place. The NCAA meet will
be March 16-18 in Indianapolis.
"So far this year I've been faster
at every point [than last year],"
she said. "I've been training
harder.... I'm really excited to
see what happens in March."
Simmons will have a good
chance to see where she stands
this weekend as the Cardinal has
a very strong distance corps.
Senior Dana Anderson, a five-time
All-America and a 12th-place
finisher in the 400-meter freestyle
at the Trials; sophomore Barb
Metz, a triple finalist at the Olym
pic Trials; and freshman Eva Mor
tenson, a 1988 Olympian for Den
mark, will all give Simmons some
competition.
"We've just been training so
hard, just like Stanford is I
guess," Simmons said. "I'll be
very worn down. It's going to have
to come from deep down inside
me to do well this weekend."
