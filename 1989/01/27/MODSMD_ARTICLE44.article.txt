# Men's gymnastics travels to UCSB

### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
When men's gymnastics Coach
Sadao Hamada added this week
end's meet to his team's schedule
two weeks ago, it wasn't because
he wanted to beef up the Cardinal
record with some easy wins.
Sunday at UC-Santa Barbara,
Stanford (4-0) will face the host
Gauchos and the UCLA Bruins.
UCLA finished third at last year's
NCAA Championships, one place

ahead of Stanford. The Bruins
won the rharapinarhip m,,JL987,
and were second (again just in
front of the Cardinal) in 1986.
This year, they're as strong as
ever. The competition's outcome,
however, is unpredictable. Early
season meets are almost always
experimental, and none of the
teams is likely to have its gym
nasts attempt their most difficult
routines.
"Right now, it's more important

that we pay attention to our
selves,".. Cardinal junior Adam
Forman said. "Of course, we'd like
to beat them, but it's early in the
season and we need to take care
of ourselves."
Hamada is confident that his
top four performers can match
UCLA's best on Sunday after
noon. However, because of inju
ries to his fifth and sixth gym
nasts, he thinks the Biuins will
be tough to beat if they enter
their strongest lineup.
