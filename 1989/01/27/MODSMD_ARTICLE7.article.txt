# Hum Bio program faces faculty crisis
## But senate extends track for five years 
### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
The highly popular Program in
Human Biology was extended for
five years by the Faculty Senate
last night, to no one's surprise,
but rumblings of problems with
the interdisciplinary track may
undermine future expansion of
the program.
According to a report issued last
April that surveyed faculty, staff
and students in the program,
Hum Bio is underfunded and
faces a looming faculty crisis as
senior professors retire.
The report, authored by several
professors and led by Biology
Prof. Marcus Feldman, spurred
senate debate, but in the end,
most senators settled on the
status quo.
The professors associated with

the Hum Bio program were the
most adamant advocates for
change, arguing for increased
funding, faculty support and
space. The lack of funding
"jeapordizes the very existence of
the program," charged Biology
Prof. Robert Simoni.
Another Hum Bio supporter
said interdepartmental programs
in general are being "taken for
granted," even though 23 percent
of undergraduates major in such
programs. Hum Bio and Interna
tional Relations, the two largest
interdisciplinary majors, don't
have their own departmental or
ganizations.
Others contended that the
uproar over additional funding
was misguided.
Praising Hum Bio as "one of
the most successful experiments
in American tertiary education,"
Humanities and Sciences Dean
Ewart Thomas said Hum Bio is
the "largest and best-supported
of the inter-departmental pro
grams." The real issue, Thomas
said, is how to manage available
resources between Hum Bio and
related departments.
University President Donald
Kennedy and Biology Prof. Craig
Heller, chair of Hum Bio, agreed
with Thomas's conclusion. Ken
nedy, himself a former Hum Bio
chair, said the program suffered
from a "marginal hostility" from
established departments, which
made distribution of funds diffi
cult and competitive.
Heller said "student interest (in
Hum Bio) will continue to be
strong" and the University needs
"to find ways of directing faculty
teaching time to where students
are."
