# Bundy may be linked to Stanford murder
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Senior staff writer 
Ted Bundy may have been
electrocuted on Tuesday, but his
ghost apparently still haunts the
Bay Area.
Bundy, who was once a Stanford
student, may have been involved
in an unsolved area murder com
mitted in the early 19705, accord
ing to Sgt. Ken Kahn of the Santa
Clara County Sheriffs Office.
The Registrar's Office con
firmed yesterday that Bundy was
a registered student here studying
Chinese during the summer quar
ter of 1967.
Bundy allegedly visited the Bay
Area on a number of occasions in
1973 and 1974. Although there is
speculation that he may have
taken a second summer school
course at Stanford in 1972, the
Registrar's Office could not con
firm this.
These reports would put him
in the Bay Area during the time
when three still-unsolved
homicides were committed at and
around Stanford, according to
Stanford Police Chief Marv Her
rington.
Investigators in Santa Clara
have always considered Bundy a
suspect in the Feb. 13, 1973, mur
der of Leslie Perlov, Kahn said.
Perlov, a Stanford graduate, was
found strangled in the Foothills
near Page Mill Road.
There are many similarities be

tween the Perlov case and other
confirmed Bundy killings, such as
the victim's description and the
method of murder.
However, Kahn pointed out
that there is no "overwhelming
evidence" that Bundy was in
volved. The sheriff s office is now
"actively trying to prove or dis
prove" reports that Bundy in
cluded a reference to northern
California in his series of last
minute confessions before his ex
ecution.
Officials at Florida State Prison
in Starke, Fla., where Bundy was
executed could not be reached for
confirmation last night.
Although Bundy is a suspect in
the Perlov killing, Kahn dispelled
speculation that Bundy may also
have been responsible for two
other Stanford-related murders in
1974.
The details of the Oct. 13, 1974,
murder of Arlis Perry, the wife
of a Stanford undergraduate who
was stabbed in Memorial Church,
do not indicate involvement by
Bundy, Kahn said.
The third case involved Janet
Taylor, the daughter of a former
Stanford athletic director, who
was murdered on March 24, 1974.
Although there are several
similarities to the Perlov case,
Kahn said that investigators in
San Mateo County, where
Taylor's murder took place, have
concluded that Bundy was not in
volved.
