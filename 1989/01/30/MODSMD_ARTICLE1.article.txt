# Meese slams ethics laws
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
In his first appearance at Stanford since leaving
the Reagan administration, former U.S. Attorney
General Edwin Meese 111 said Saturday that the
implementation of "wave after wave" of ethics reg
ulations has deterred many qualified members of
the public sector from participating in government.
During his 30-minute address to about 500 in
Memorial Auditorium, Meese said the increase of
ethics regulation "does nothing in terms of providing
more honest government," but is instead "just an
annoyance and a hazard."
Meese's speech was part of the day-long "Issues
of the '90s" conference, which was co-sponsored by
the Stanford Alumni Association and the Hoover
Institution (see related story).
During his talk Meese did not make any explicit
references to the circumstances which preceded his
resignation as attorney general.
Now a distinguished visiting scholar at the Hoover
Institution, Meese resigned from his post in the
Justice Department last August following an inde
pendent counsel's 14-month investigation into pos
sible ethics violations.
Allegations against Meese included preferential
treatment given to friends and participation in de
cisions on companies in which he owned stock.
Although the independent counsel's 830-page
report concluded that there was no basis for criminal
procedings against Meese, two weeks ago the Justice
Department issued a separate report which con
cluded that, during his tenure, Meese had engaged
in "conduct which should not be tolerated of any
government employee, especially not the attorney
general."
In his speech Saturday, Meese
said that in addition to exorbitant
ethical regulations, salary consid
erations and the criticism that
public figures must endure serve
as barriers to entering public serv
ice.
Meese was also critical of the
controversy surrounding the ties

between the Hoover Institution
and the Reagan administration,
and, more generally, between
academia and government.
The interchange between uni
versities and government
"strengthens" and "enriches" both
institutions, Meese said.
"Without such cooperation be
tween government and educa
tional institutions, a great source
of problem-solving capability
would be lost," Meese explained.
"It's a simple fact. . . that there's

very little time once you're in gov
ernment for creative thinking and
objective evaluation."
Meese said that without the ac
ademic contribution of Hoover
scholars such as Senior Fellow
Martin Anderson and Director W.
Glenn Campbell, President
Reagan would not have been able
to implement his policies as
smoothly when he took office in
1981. Both served as advisers dur
ing the Reagan administration.
"Such cooperation need not

endanger academic freedom,"
Meese said.
He said Stanford's contribu
tions to government have been bi
partisan and have come from the
University as well as from the
Hoover Institution.
When he was an undergraduate
in political science, professors who
had participated in government
during the Depression and World
War II were able to enliven their
teaching of the political process
with personal anecdotes, Meese

recounted.
In his role as a distinguished
visiting scholar at Hoover, Meese
will conduct research, write, give
periodic speeches and participate
in seminars.
