# Meese slams ethics laws
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
In his first appearance at Stanford since leaving
the Reagan administration, former U.S. Attorney
General Edwin Meese 111 said Saturday that the
implementation of "wave after wave" of ethics reg
ulations has deterred many qualified members of
the public sector from participating in government.
During his 30-minute address to about 500 in
Memorial Auditorium, Meese said the increase of
ethics regulation "does nothing in terms of providing
more honest government," but is instead "just an
annoyance and a hazard."
Meese's speech was part of the day-long "Issues
of the '90s" conference, which was co-sponsored by
the Stanford Alumni Association and the Hoover
Institution (see related story).
During his talk Meese did not make any explicit
references to the circumstances which preceded his
resignation as attorney general.
Now a distinguished visiting scholar at the Hoover
Institution, Meese resigned from his post in the
Justice Department last August following an inde
pendent counsel's 14-month investigation into pos
sible ethics violations.
Allegations against Meese included preferential
treatment given to friends and participation in de
cisions on companies in which he owned stock.
Although the independent counsel's 830-page
report concluded that there was no basis for criminal
procedings against Meese, two weeks ago the Justice
Department issued a separate report which con
cluded that, during his tenure, Meese had engaged
in "conduct which should not be tolerated of any
government employee, especially not the attorney
general."
