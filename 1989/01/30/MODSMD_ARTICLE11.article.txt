# War narrowly avoided in 1962
## Soviet and Cuban troops were ready for war in missile crisis 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) - A Cuban official
has disclosed that 270,000 Soviet and
Cuban troops were ready to go to war
with the United States during the 1962
Cuban missile crisis and that 100,000
casualties were expected, former U.S.
Defense Secretary Robert McNamara
said yesterday.
A Soviet general confirmed for the
first time that one-third of his country's
nuclear warheads designed to strike the
United States were on Cuba at the time.
However, he and another Soviet official
said the warheads had not been
mounted on missile launchers and were
not ready for firing.
Also, Cuban leader Fidel Castro urged
Moscow to launch a nuclear attack on
the United States, ABC News reported.
The revelations came during a review
of the Cuban missile crisis at a confer
ence during the weekend at a trade un
ion center in southwest Moscow.
Pierre Salinger, Kennedy's former
press secretary, a conference participant
and now an ABC correspondent, yester
day quoted a top Soviet source as saying
in a private conversation that on Oct.
27, 1962, Castro urged Khrushchev to
immediately fire the missiles at the
United States to head off an invasion.
Cuban participants in the conference
refused to confirm or deny the report,
Salinger said.

Soviets and Americans have met
before to discuss the Soviet deployment
of nuclear missiles in Cuba and the
U.S. response: a blockade of the island
and a demand for the rockets' removal.
But this was the first joint meeting
with Cuban officials who guided their
country through the crisis. Premier
Nikita Khrushchev eventually withdrew
the missiles in exchange for President
Kennedy's pledge not to invade Cuba.
At a news conference wrapping up
the conference Sunday, McNamara said
the figures on Cuba's war readiness
and casualty estimate were provided by
Jorge Risquet, a member of Cuba's
ruling Politburo.
"They say they had armed 270,000
men. They were determined to fight to
the death of every man, and they
believed there would be 100,000 Cuban
and Soviet casualties," McNamara told
reporters.
It was not clear whether the 100,000
casualty estimate included deaths and
injuries and whether it referred to losses
among soldiers and civilians.
Other American officials said
privately the Cubans had said the
casualty count could have reached
800,000. Cuba's population at the time
was 8 million.
McNamara said that of the troops,
40,000 were Soviet, four times higher

than U.S. intelligence estimates at the
time.
Risquet cited the figures to show his
country seriously believed that a U.S.
invasion of his island was imminent.
McNamara said no such invasion was
ever contemplated, but speaking of the
Cubans, he added: "If I had been in
their shoes, I would have believed the
same thing."
American officials have said they were
never sure whether any Soviet nuclear
warheads had actually reached Cuba but
that they assumed they had.
Col. Gen. Dmitri Volkogonov, director
of the Defense Ministry's Institute of
Military History, said that at the time
of the crisis, 20 Soviet nuclear warheads
were on Cuba. Another 20 warheads
were headed to the island aboard a So
viet ship that was caught in the U.S.
naval blockade, he said.
He made the remarks in a closed ses
sion of the conference Saturday, and
they were reported to The Associated
Press yesterday by Raymond Garthoff,
a State Department official at the time
of the crisis.
Garthoff, now a senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution in Washington,
said Volkogonov reported 20 nuclear
missiles were on Soviet territory tar
geted at the United States.
