### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — President
Saddam Hussein agreed yesterday to a
U.N. proposal to set up a joint military
committee with Persian Gulf rival Iran,
a U.N. envoy said.
After a four-hour meeting with Sad
dam, U.N. envoy Jan Eliasson said the
Iraqi president also agreed to lift a ban
barring Iranian-bound civilian flights
from flying over Iraq.
Diplomats said the development, also
reported by official Baghdad Radio, is a
significant breakthrough in U.N. efforts
to revive stalled peace talks to end the
eight-year gulf war.
Eliasson told The Associated Press
after his negotiations in Tehran and

Baghdad that the agreements were "the
two most concrete measures that could
improve the atmosphere" but added: "I
don't want to speak about break
throughs."
Still, he said he was hopeful of new
high-level talks.
Diplomats in the Iraqi capital, who re
quested anonymity, said a joint military
group signaled hopes of a troop with
drawal by both sides. The group could
work with U.N. military observers mon
itoring the Aug. 20 cease-fire, they said.
Iraq's and Iran's failure to agree on a
withdrawal, called for under a July 1987
Security Council resolution, has been a
major sticking point in talks that have

dragged on inconclusively for five
months.
Eliasson, Sweden's U.N. ambassador
and special envoy of U.N. Secretary-
General Javier Perez de Cuellar, arrived
in Baghdad Friday after four days of
talks with Iranian leaders. He is due back
in New York tomorrow.
The envoy said the mixed military
working group would be formed under
U.N. supervision, but he said he was not
sure what level of military commander
would serve from each side.
Eliasson also said new talks were pos
sible.
"The secretary-general and I are hope
ful of being able to meet with the foreign

ministers of Iran and Iraq in New York
in the near future," he said.
He could not specify a date, saying
Perez de Cuellar had to confirm the most
appropriate forum for the talks.
Talks broke down in Geneva on Nov.
11. Iran says it considers further talks
futile unless Iraq halts what it calls delay
ing tactics.
Baghdad Radio reported that Saddam
reiterated to Eliasson that Iraq rejects
any Iranian conditions to resuming ne
gotiations, but Eliasson said no condi
tions have been set for the proposed talks.
Iran has said that before it returns to
the negotiating table, Iraq must agree to
the complete and immediate implemen

tation of the Security Council resolution,
including withdrawing troops to the
prewar border.
Baghdad Radio said Saddam agreed to
participate in the joint military commit
tee and to lift the flight ban "out of
Iraq's keenness for the U.N. envoy's mis
sion to succeed and its readiness to
cooperate with him."
Iran charges Iraq is blocking agreement
by refusing to withdraw from 260 square
miles of Iranian border territory captured
in final stages of the fighting. Iraq says
it will not withdraw until Iran agrees to
surrender its right to search ships in the
gulf for Iraq-bound war materiel.
