# IRA to avoid killing civilians
## Guerilla group admits to 'an awful lot of mistakes' 
### 
DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) — The
Irish Republican Army said yes
terday it would focus its violent
attacks on the British army and
try to avoid killing civilians.
The statement followed
criticism by the IRA's legal polit
ical wing, Sinn Fein, during the
party's three-day annual confer
ence.
Sinn Fein leaders Gerry Adams
and Martin McGuinness on Sat
urday expressed unhappiness
with the killing of civilians in the
IRA's fight against British rule
in Northern Ireland.
At the close of the conference
yesterday, an unidentified man
read a statement from the out
lawed guerrilla group's ruling
army council that said: "We will
continue to attack (British) Crown
forces — but heed Gerry Adams'
warning to avoid civilians."
The brief statement won loud
applause from the 500 conference
delegates.
In Londonderry. Northern

Ireland, yesterday, McGuinness
spoke on the same subject to a
gathering of marchers com
memorating the "Bloody Sunday"
shooting of 1972, when 14
civilians were killed there by
British troops during a Roman
Catholic civil rights protest.
McGuinness said the IRA had
made "an awful lot of mistakes"
involving the deaths of civilians.
A "lot of mayhem" was caused
among innocent people, he said,
but the IRA showed integrity and
courage in tackling the issue of
civilian killings, he said.
"The IRA have stood up and
said 'Yes it was wrong, yes we
will try to ensure it does not hap
pen again'," he told a crowd of
3,000.
"I believe the IRA have made
mistakes. They have killed people
by accident but the reality is too
many civilians have been killed."
Some observers have linked
Sinn Fein's unusual rebuke to the
party's determination to do well

in elections this year.
As expected, the conference
unanimously agreed to comply
with the new British government
order that all candidates in North
ern Ireland elections sign an anti
violence oath.
The party national executive
had urged delegates not to allow
"any British-inspired oath or
pledge to prevent Sinn Fein rep
resenting its electorate in local
councils."
Sinn Fein's leadership viewed
the British move as an effort to
remove the party from the polit
ical process in Northern Ireland.
A new law expected to be in
effect in time for local elections
in May will require candidates to
sign a declaration that if elected
they would not express support
for terrorism. Any breach is to be
punishable by a five-year ban
from office.
Skeptics have said Sinn Fein
candidates would likely take the
oath but ignore it.
