48 die in Ivory Coast bus crash
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) — A bus packed
with schoolchildren toppled into a culvert during
a thunderstorm, and news reports said yesterday
that 48 passengers were killed and 75 seriously
injured.
The storm had filled the culvert with water
and many victims drowned before rescuers could
reach them, national television reported.
Reporters for the official daily Fraternite Matin
said they had been unable to find the driver
among the dead or among those hospitalized.
The newspaper quoted survivors as saying the
bus driver was traveling too fast for the condi
tions. One survivor said the bus conducter had
twice ordered the driver to slow down.
Texaco strikes pact with Icahn
NEW YORK (AP) — Texaco Inc. yesterday
made a truce with its biggest stockholder, Carl
Icahn, who said he would not try to buy the oil
giant or wrest control from its board.
Texaco, moving toward completion of a restruc
turing, also proposed paying $1.9 billion in special
dividends to shareholders, a step Icahn applauded.
The company said it had signed a seven-year

agreement with Icahn that he will not add to his
stake in the oil giant, currently estimated at 17
percent, and will not launch or support any proxy
fights against management.
Texaco and Icahn also agreed to settle pending
litigation. Texaco sued Icahn last spring, accusing
him of securities law violations.
Swaggart accused of an affair
NEW YORK (AP) — A Louisiana stripper had
a six-month sexual relationship with evangelist
Jimmy Swaggart at the same time he allegedly
was involved with a prostitute, a men's magazine
reported.
Penthouse magazine, in its March issue, said
Swaggart sought out Catherine Kampen, a
homemaker and performer of striptease
telegrams, promising to help her financially while
demanding she perform sexual acts for him.
Swaggart's attorneys told the magazine Kam
pen 's allegations were untrue and that she fab
ricated the account. Phillip Wittmann, an attor
ney for Swaggart, said the evangelist will sue
Penthouse.
The magazine said Swaggart approached Kam
pen at a roadside telephone in July 1987 and
said he could help her with her marriage and
personal life.
