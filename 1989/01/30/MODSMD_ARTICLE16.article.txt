## Improved advising 
### 
Advising Associate
Program for frosh and
sophomores upgraded

STUDENTS HAVE BEEN
complaining about the Aca
demic Advising program for
a number of years. Graduates res
ponding to the senior survey con
tinually call Stanford's advising
system inadequate. Last year, 42
percent termed the general advis
ing system "poor."
This year, under the leadership
of senior David Kim and the aegis
of Andree Sursock of the Under
graduate Advising Center, the AA
program has finally been upgraded.
Kim has set high standards long
overdue for the AA program, and
rightly dismissed a few AAs who
did not perform up to par.
Although the program is very
decentralized, there has been a new
emphasis on maintaining contact
with AAs, which is integral to the
success of this type of program.
Kim meets with every dorm at
least once a month. AAs are also
updated on issues relevant to their
position once a month.
In an effort to build up commit
ment and continue to advise fresh
men on a regular basis throughout
spring quarter, AAs have been
given a series of standard questions
to ask their advisees and the fresh
men have been surveyed about
their experiences with the AA pro
gram.
The program has also been
strengthened by the addition of a
spring quarter class for AAs, which
orients them to the multitude of
resources at the disposal of stu
dents.
The one-unit class meets one
night a week and only requires
minimal work, but markedly im
proves the advising skills of the

AA. Through this class, AAs
familiarize themselves with useful
institutions such as the Center for
Teaching and Learning and Under
graduate Research Opportunities
recently tapped to head the pro
gram next year.
To combat the winter quarter
burn-out syndrome, the AA pro
gram encourages AAs to bring in
' stress managers like Stan Wanat
of the Center for Teaching and
Learning, to assist students in
their efforts to stay on top of their
academics. These types of seminars
offer concrete methods for students
to confront the academic pressures
of the first two years at Stanford.
One facet of the advising pro
gram continues to fall below ade
quate standards: follow-up with
sophomores. Once the freshman
year is over, many AAs tradition
ally lose contact with their ad
visees, and advisers are only
needed for the mundane task of
signing study lists.
Sophomore year here is crucial,
however, in determining academic
futures. Majors decisions and long
term academic commitments are
made during the year, and better
follow-up by AAs would provide an
essential service to sophomores.
AA program leaders have started
to increase efforts within the pro
gram to maintain contact with
sophomores who may have lost
their AA to graduation. New AAs
are asked to contact sophomores
from their adviser's previous
group. More importantly, Kim says
a sophomore advising program is
in the works, an idea that is long
overdue.
If all goes as planned, the un
dergraduate advising program may
eventually reach the quality level
necessary to ensure freshmen the
guidance they need their first year
here. Wednesday is the application
deadline for upperclass students
who might want to be AAs next
year.
