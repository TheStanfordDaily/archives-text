## Lessons on diversity from Singapore and Malaysia 
### 
IT IS WITH RELUCTANCE that I
make my contribution to the debate
on racism at Stanford. Reluctance,
because rational discussion of the issue
no longer seems possible in an atmos
phere of distrust where a different
viewpoint cannot be expressed without
the author's character being unfairly
insinuated against.
I come from Singapore, where three
racial groups live in harmony, rela
tively free from racial tension. Two
decades ago, Singapore had its share of
racial problems, as did neighboring
Malaysia which has a similar racial
composition of Chinese, Malays and
Indians. Racial strife and polarization
continue to be a fact of life in
Malaysia today, but not in Singapore.
Why is this?
The one clear difference between the
two countries is that in Malaysia,
political parties and pressure groups
are still organized along racial lines.
In Singapore, racial differences are

not emphasized. Political parties draw
their support from all races, and do
not generally put forward policies that
favor particualr racial groups. Many
Malays and Indians still wear tradi
tional dress at work and are obviously
proud of their cultural heritage. They
do not have to fear discrimination for
being different.
Stanford has been a totally different,
not altogether positive experience for
me. I have never before been in a
place where a person's race mattered
so much. I am very much disturbed by
the amount of tension and anger in
this community and how often con
frontation, rather than reconciliation,
is resorted to in dealing with racial
matters.
I think that the practice of attaching
racial labels to people and their works
is simple-minded, divisive and danger
ous. The categorizing of Cultures,
Ideas and Values texts on the basis of
race and gender is disrespectful to
their authors and neglects the univer-

sality of human values that underlies
all great works.
We do not want the result of educa
tion at Stanford to be young people
who believe that different races have
very little, if anything, in common
with one another. The way to establish
bonds between different peoples is to
build on the commonality of much of
human experience. Differences in cul
ture do exist and are important, but
they are better understood as different
responses to the same human striving
for happiness and self-fulfillment.
The Ujamaa factual report makes
the danger of this practice of labeling
works by race very clear for Stanford.
It appears that the two students re
sponsible for the racist poster were
provoked by being told that Beethoven
was black. No doubt, they reacted very
immaturely and insensitively, for which
there is no excuse. But I cannot com
prehend why the color of Beethoven's
skin should ever be brought up in any

discussion of his music.
Let me recommend a non-Western
thinker for CIV. Mahatma Gandhi's
ideas should be quite pertinent to U.S.
students, given that the civil rights
movement of the '60s often took its
inspiration from him, and especially
since we live in an increasingly violent
world. Or is non-violence only for some
races, but not for others?
I wish Stanford to be a community
where everyone can live in harmony
without the intrusion of race. Although
racism is an important national issue,
it must be realized that Stanford alone
cannot right all wrongs.
What we can try to do is provide
students with the experience of living
in an enlightened community that
succeeds, trusting that the memories
they will take with them will guide
them in their future interactions in a
multiracial society.
