# In defense of Rigoberta Menchu
## 
### 
In a Jan. 19 letter, Enrique Origgi
draws on his Guatemalan identity as a
claim to authority on Anthropology
Prof. Renato Rosaldo's selection of the
book "I .. . Rigoberta Menchu" as re
quired reading in an experimental Cul
tures, Ideas and Values course called
Europe and the Americas.
Although I am not Guatemalan, I
nonetheless feel qualified to speak on
the selection of this book, based on my
familiarity with the struggles Menchu
writes about, as well as the belief that
although Menchu is Guatemalan, her
words belong to all of us.
Origgi holds the misbegotten notion

that there exists such a thing as "the"
Latin American experience. By suggest
ing that Menchu's work does not
reflect the experience of every Latin
American and should therefore not be
used in a college classroom is to negate
her existence — and that of other
Guatemalans who share her experience
and her understanding of it.
What exactly is the criteria for some
thing to be considered "representa
tive"? That everyone, or even a large
msyority, shares the views of the au
thor? Is anything ever representative?
And why should it be? Education is a
process in which critical thinkers ex
amine different points of view.
What Origgi fails to understand is
that his view as to what constitutes
"good" Latin American literature is as
elitist aa the views of the Western

culture defenders, who deem the works
of Asturias, Borges and Neruda (whom
Origgi professes as being the "greats")
naturally inferior to the works of
(white male) European and North
American authors.
For example, French Prof. Robert
Cohn in a Jan. 19 letter, unabashedly
refers to "superior culture like the
French." Is this a person whose judg
ment we should trust over Rosaldo's?
Origgi suggests that for Rcsaldo to
use Menchu's work in his course serves
no purpose other than the promotion
of his own political views. Again, this
painfully denies the existence of
Menchu herself, and her right to ex
press "political views" and a life exper
ience distasteful to Origgi.
Further, whenever a professor selects

the canons of a literary tradition to
the neglect of alternative voices, she or
he is also promoting a view no less
political than that which is being at
tributed to Rosaldo.
As a woman of color who has recog
nized the various sources of oppression
that affect my own life, I find
Menchu's work to be an affirmation. I
applaud Rosaldo for requiring Stanford
students to grapple with the challenges
Menchu poses.
And I hold profound resentment
toward those who negate my existence
by suggesting that any representation
of my reality and that of millions like
me (Menchu among them) is not a
legitimate topic of study.
