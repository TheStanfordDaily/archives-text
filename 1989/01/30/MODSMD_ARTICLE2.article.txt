# Hiding in stalls, starving a soul: bulimia's terror

Editor's note: All the names of women with eating
disorders have been changed.

A bulimic in search of treatment for the "bingeing
purging syndrome" need only look in the Tresidder
Union women's bathroom. Interlaced with the other
graffiti on the inside door of the third cubicle is
the only comprehensive list on campus.
A plea, "Help! I have bulimia and my life is falling
apart. Please help me," evokes the anonymous sug
gestions "Call CAPS," "Call The Bridge," "Try
(Overeaters Anonymous). I did. It works."
For non-bulimics, the door offers clues about the
nature of the illness. Several pertinent issues are
raised here, from the paradoxes of "slim sexiness
power, slim sexiness % slavery," through an
attack on the narcissism of bulimics, to urgently
repeated assertions that heavy women are beautiful
and that society places too high a premium on
female appearance.
One contributor insists that this is not simply a
dieting disorder. "Bulimia is a control issue, a separa
tion issue, an anger issue, a responsibility issue."
Another hand adds that bulimia is "a barfing
issue." And this is not even one of the more secluded
bathrooms which janitorial staff, since 1982, have
reported frequently blocked with vomit. But its lo
cation, at once public and private, is probably more
than ironically apt for a discussion of bulimia.
Cycle of guilt and freedom
Bulimic behavior is the compulsive and uncon
trolled gorging on highly calorific foods, followed
by feelings of shame and guilt that prompt purging
with laxatives or self-induced vomiting.
Anne describes the intense and paradoxical sensa
tions of a bingeing episode. An "amazing feeling of
complete freedom" is enmeshed with a "feeling of
complete self-loathing, guilt and anger."
The syndrome is cyclical and spiralling. "I engaged
in bingeing and purging because I felt inadequate,
and bingeing and purging made me feel even more
inadeqate," she says.
Given that the typical bulimic is a woman of high
socio-economic status, high education and high in
telligence in her late teens or early 20s, Stanford's
female population is unusually vulnerable to the
illness. The precise prevalence of bulimia on the
campus, however, is elusive.
