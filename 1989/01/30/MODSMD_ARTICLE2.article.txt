# Hiding in stalls, starving a soul: bulimia's terror
## 
### Kate Summerscale 
Editor's note: All the names of women with eating
disorders have been changed.

A bulimic in search of treatment for the "bingeing
purging syndrome" need only look in the Tresidder
Union women's bathroom. Interlaced with the other
graffiti on the inside door of the third cubicle is
the only comprehensive list on campus.
A plea, "Help! I have bulimia and my life is falling
apart. Please help me," evokes the anonymous sug
gestions "Call CAPS," "Call The Bridge," "Try
(Overeaters Anonymous). I did. It works."
For non-bulimics, the door offers clues about the
nature of the illness. Several pertinent issues are
raised here, from the paradoxes of "slim sexiness
power, slim sexiness % slavery," through an
attack on the narcissism of bulimics, to urgently
repeated assertions that heavy women are beautiful
and that society places too high a premium on
female appearance.
One contributor insists that this is not simply a
dieting disorder. "Bulimia is a control issue, a separa
tion issue, an anger issue, a responsibility issue."
Another hand adds that bulimia is "a barfing
issue." And this is not even one of the more secluded
bathrooms which janitorial staff, since 1982, have
reported frequently blocked with vomit. But its lo
cation, at once public and private, is probably more
than ironically apt for a discussion of bulimia.
Cycle of guilt and freedom
Bulimic behavior is the compulsive and uncon
trolled gorging on highly calorific foods, followed
by feelings of shame and guilt that prompt purging
with laxatives or self-induced vomiting.
Anne describes the intense and paradoxical sensa
tions of a bingeing episode. An "amazing feeling of
complete freedom" is enmeshed with a "feeling of
complete self-loathing, guilt and anger."
The syndrome is cyclical and spiralling. "I engaged
in bingeing and purging because I felt inadequate,
and bingeing and purging made me feel even more
inadeqate," she says.
Given that the typical bulimic is a woman of high
socio-economic status, high education and high in
telligence in her late teens or early 20s, Stanford's
female population is unusually vulnerable to the
illness. The precise prevalence of bulimia on the
campus, however, is elusive.
Most bulimics have a normal body
weight, and most bulimic behavior is
secret. And along with the difficulty of
quantifying a virtually invisible disease
exists a problem of definitions.
Defining 'ox-hunger'
Definition of the disease itself is a
recent undertaking and open to revision.
Bulimia, literally "ox-hunger," was first
included in the Diagnostic and Statisti
cal Manual 111 in 1980. Research since
then has consistently estimated that
bulimia affects 5 to 20 percent of college
women.
This year's revised version of the
manual tightens the definition and so
shrinks the statistics. A study last Oc
tober, based on the revised criteria
specifying frequency of bingeing and
regular purging, suggests that a figure
of 2 percent is more accurate.
Dr. Harvey Weinstein says his exper
ience in treating bulimics at Stanford's
Cowell Health Center for 10 years ac
cords with this estimate. It would mean
that the 40 to 50 bulimic women who
visit the Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS) each year comprise a
quarter of a total bulimic population of
150 to 200 female students.
Weinstein, who in 1978 instigated one
of the first bulimic treatment groups in
the country, is anxious to match this
narrowing of the criteria with a
broadening of scope. Stringent defini
tions "vastly underestimate and ignore
the vast numbers of women whose lives
are very much controlled by how they
perceive food," he says.
The physical symptoms of bulimia in
clude regurgitated gastric juices severely
damaging the throat's mucus
membranes and eroding tooth enamel.
The body may dehydrate, or parts of it
may swell with retained water. In some
cases, the bulimic is so physically
drained by purging that she is confined
to bed.
Bridget was bulimic for five years.
She experienced several of the

symptoms associated with the illness,
and finally resolved to recover when
her schoolwork started to degenerate
and she began to dream about her teeth
falling out.
The irrationality of this silent exhaus
tion of the body is evident. Understand
ing why it occurs is more difficult and
more important.
The 'best of both worlds'
Ari, who has a picture of a "No Fat
Chicks" t-shirt on his wall in Branner
dormitory, describes bulimics as having
"the best of both worlds: They get the
best foods and they don't get fat."
Ari's trivializing bravado is a parody
of the sexism that can create or exacer
bate eating disorders. It also accurately
describes the rationale of many
bulimics. The contradictory desires for
food and for slimness are temporarily
resolved in a session of bingeing and
purging.

But the attempt to inhabit the two
worlds of denial and indulgence is even
tually self-destructive, much as might
be women's attempts to inhabit both
female and male worlds.
Drs. Susan and Wayne Wooley are
leading eating disorder researchers. In
an October 1986 article in American
Health magazine, they argue that the
incidence of bulimia has risen dramati
cally because of "a modern conflict over
women's social roles."

"For 1980s women," they claim,
"thinness is weighted with meaning. It's
become symbolic of strength, indepen
dence and achievement, as well as at
tractiveness. ... For the first time in
memory, young women are expected to
grow up to be more like their fathers
than like their mothers."
For opposing reasons, thinness
epitomizes both female beauty and male
power. With the onset of adolescence,
girls are expected to supplement
"female" nurturing, interpersonal skills
with a "male" emotional independence
and personal ambition. Simultaneously,
they are becoming physically like their
mothers.
The desire for thinness, then, may
imply the acquisition of symbolic male
qualities and a rejection of the female
shape of the mother.
For anorexics the rejection can be
unequivocal. Emma, who is anorexic,
speaks of being "disgusted with my
mother. I never liked her shape or the
fact she got her period."
Anne says of her mother, "her body
disgusts me. ... I could see myself be
coming like her and that terrified and
disgusted me."
Such emotions are complicated by the
close relationships many bulimics have
with their mothers. Cathy, also a
recovering bulimic, expresses a strong
fear of becoming like her mother, but
also suggests that her bingeing "may
be to be like her; may be saying 'I
accept you.' "
What thinness means is as confused
and contradictory as the unprecedented
roles that these high-achieving young
women are expected to play, and as all
consuming as the bingeing and purging
behaviors in which they engage.
Food is a highly charged symbol to
these, and perhaps most, women. The
language bulimics use in describing
their behavior is vividly metaphoric.
For Cathy, gorging is "literally stuff
ing down your feelings, stuffing down
your fear", "trying to fill something
that can never be filled," and purging
is "a violent act." Anne, too, speaks of
"trying to stuff those feelings down
along with the food."

telligence in her late teens or early 20s, Stanford's
female population is unusually vulnerable to the
illness. The precise prevalence of bulimia on the
campus, however, is elusive.
Most bulimics have a normal body
weight, and most bulimic behavior is
secret. And along with the difficulty of
quantifying a virtually invisible disease
exists a problem of definitions.
Defining 'ox-hunger'
Definition of the disease itself is a
recent undertaking and open to revision.
Bulimia, literally "ox-hunger," was first
included in the Diagnostic and Statisti
cal Manual 111 in 1980. Research since
then has consistently estimated that
bulimia affects 5 to 20 percent of college
women.
This year's revised version of the
manual tightens the definition and so
shrinks the statistics. A study last Oc
tober, based on the revised criteria
specifying frequency of bingeing and
regular purging, suggests that a figure
of 2 percent is more accurate.
Dr. Harvey Weinstein says his exper
ience in treating bulimics at Stanford's
Cowell Health Center for 10 years ac
cords with this estimate. It would mean
that the 40 to 50 bulimic women who
visit the Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS) each year comprise a
quarter of a total bulimic population of
150 to 200 female students.
Weinstein, who in 1978 instigated one
of the first bulimic treatment groups in
the country, is anxious to match this
narrowing of the criteria with a
broadening of scope. Stringent defini
tions "vastly underestimate and ignore
the vast numbers of women whose lives
are very much controlled by how they
perceive food," he says.
The physical symptoms of bulimia in
clude regurgitated gastric juices severely
damaging the throat's mucus
membranes and eroding tooth enamel.
The body may dehydrate, or parts of it
may swell with retained water. In some
cases, the bulimic is so physically
drained by purging that she is confined
to bed.
Bridget was bulimic for five years.
She experienced several of the

symptoms associated with the illness,
and finally resolved to recover when
her schoolwork started to degenerate
and she began to dream about her teeth
falling out.
The irrationality of this silent exhaus
tion of the body is evident. Understand
ing why it occurs is more difficult and
more important.
The 'best of both worlds'
Ari, who has a picture of a "No Fat
Chicks" t-shirt on his wall in Branner
dormitory, describes bulimics as having
"the best of both worlds: They get the
best foods and they don't get fat."
Ari's trivializing bravado is a parody
of the sexism that can create or exacer
bate eating disorders. It also accurately
describes the rationale of many
bulimics. The contradictory desires for
food and for slimness are temporarily
resolved in a session of bingeing and
purging.

But the attempt to inhabit the two
worlds of denial and indulgence is even
tually self-destructive, much as might
be women's attempts to inhabit both
female and male worlds.
Drs. Susan and Wayne Wooley are
leading eating disorder researchers. In
an October 1986 article in American
Health magazine, they argue that the
incidence of bulimia has risen dramati
cally because of "a modern conflict over
women's social roles."

"For 1980s women," they claim,
"thinness is weighted with meaning. It's
become symbolic of strength, indepen
dence and achievement, as well as at
tractiveness. ... For the first time in
memory, young women are expected to
grow up to be more like their fathers
than like their mothers."
For opposing reasons, thinness
epitomizes both female beauty and male
power. With the onset of adolescence,
girls are expected to supplement
"female" nurturing, interpersonal skills
with a "male" emotional independence
and personal ambition. Simultaneously,
they are becoming physically like their
mothers.
The desire for thinness, then, may
imply the acquisition of symbolic male
qualities and a rejection of the female
shape of the mother.
For anorexics the rejection can be
unequivocal. Emma, who is anorexic,
speaks of being "disgusted with my
mother. I never liked her shape or the
fact she got her period."
Anne says of her mother, "her body
disgusts me. ... I could see myself be
coming like her and that terrified and
disgusted me."
Such emotions are complicated by the
close relationships many bulimics have
with their mothers. Cathy, also a
recovering bulimic, expresses a strong
fear of becoming like her mother, but
also suggests that her bingeing "may
be to be like her; may be saying 'I
accept you.' "
What thinness means is as confused
and contradictory as the unprecedented
roles that these high-achieving young
women are expected to play, and as all
consuming as the bingeing and purging
behaviors in which they engage.
Food is a highly charged symbol to
these, and perhaps most, women. The
language bulimics use in describing
their behavior is vividly metaphoric.
For Cathy, gorging is "literally stuff
ing down your feelings, stuffing down
your fear", "trying to fill something
that can never be filled," and purging
is "a violent act." Anne, too, speaks of
"trying to stuff those feelings down
along with the food."

Editor's note: All the names of women with eating
disorders have been changed.

A bulimic in search of treatment for the "bingeing
purging syndrome" need only look in the Tresidder
Union women's bathroom. Interlaced with the other
graffiti on the inside door of the third cubicle is
the only comprehensive list on campus.
A plea, "Help! I have bulimia and my life is falling
apart. Please help me," evokes the anonymous sug
gestions "Call CAPS," "Call The Bridge," "Try
(Overeaters Anonymous). I did. It works."
For non-bulimics, the door offers clues about the
nature of the illness. Several pertinent issues are
raised here, from the paradoxes of "slim sexiness
power, slim sexiness % slavery," through an
attack on the narcissism of bulimics, to urgently
repeated assertions that heavy women are beautiful
and that society places too high a premium on
female appearance.
One contributor insists that this is not simply a
dieting disorder. "Bulimia is a control issue, a separa
tion issue, an anger issue, a responsibility issue."
Another hand adds that bulimia is "a barfing
issue." And this is not even one of the more secluded
bathrooms which janitorial staff, since 1982, have
reported frequently blocked with vomit. But its lo
cation, at once public and private, is probably more
than ironically apt for a discussion of bulimia.
Cycle of guilt and freedom
Bulimic behavior is the compulsive and uncon
trolled gorging on highly calorific foods, followed
by feelings of shame and guilt that prompt purging
with laxatives or self-induced vomiting.
Anne describes the intense and paradoxical sensa
tions of a bingeing episode. An "amazing feeling of
complete freedom" is enmeshed with a "feeling of
complete self-loathing, guilt and anger."
The syndrome is cyclical and spiralling. "I engaged
in bingeing and purging because I felt inadequate,
and bingeing and purging made me feel even more
inadeqate," she says.
