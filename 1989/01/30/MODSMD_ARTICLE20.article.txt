## Writing into the void 
### 
THE CLOCK behind me seems to
tick more loudly with each passing
minute as my final Stanford Daily
column deadline quickly approaches.
It's 6:30 a.m., a miserable hour for a
Sunday morning. By now I have left Stan
ford for San Francisco's Noe Valley and
the nine-to-five — er, perhaps eight-to-six
— working world. Thus, such an hour
on the weekend has taken on a nastier
meaning. So, with a fuzzy Saturday night
mind, hot Spinelli coffee, a Real Foods
bagel and an ever decreasing amount of
time, here goes. . . .
I have mentally written this final
column — a farewell description of un
anticipated column-writing experiences
— ever since I wrote my first column in
late September.
Yet, like many columns that I have
written, I have been unable, for the past
few days, to put this on paper. It's dif
ficult to write when I don't know to
whom I am speaking.
Perhaps the most difficult aspect of
writing this column has been the in
visibility of the audience. I don't know
who you are. Sometimes when I sit alone
at the computer, I doubt that you even
exist. I don't know if you've liked this
column, or if it has informed or impacted
you the way that I had intended. This
makes writing personal or opinionated
columns more difficult.
Strong opinions are much more easily
expressed among friends than in print,
next to one's name and photo, especially
when the audience is so unknown, diverse
and unforgiving.
This has forced me to define my

opinions and better substantiate them.
As a columnist, one puts oneself on the
line. Unlike writing for a professor, mis
takes are public, known to an audience
infinitely larger than one professor and
one transcript. This makes writing si
multaneously intimidating and invigorat
ing.
The photo is another issue. It takes
getting used to, watching someone in the
Coffee House smoosh your newsprint face
beneath a coffee mug, or seeing your face
stepped on among a pile of stray debris
in the Physics Tank, outside the History
Corner or in a "C" parking lot.
On the flip side, people that you don't
know, from a woman in Tresidder Union
to the blue-eyed man behind the Green
Library privileges desk to a new friend,
may recognize you from your picture and
already be familiar with some of your
opinions. It's not exactly 15 minutes of
fame, but I'd give it one or two.
Sixteen inches. Columnists are given
nearly complete control over this space,
which is too short to address, adequately,
some of the grandiose issues which I and
other columnists have sometimes chosen.
This is also a great challenge. The free
dom to fill the space as the columnist
chooses also means that we, not our
editors, are responsible for our sometimes
painfully evident mistakes. Simultane
ously, the freedom has enabled me to
write on issues about which I care, and
has given me the excuse to go to different
places to do research and talk to a variety
of people about issues which I find in
teresting.
Because nobody has told me what to

write about, after the first few eagerly
written columns, finding a topic became
much more difficult. The pressure of the
next column is constant — what to write
about and how to say it — regardless of
whether one feels like writing. Watching
T.V., talking to people, reading magazines
and letters, running, all become subtle
aspects of the topic-search.
Often my best ideas come while I'm
driving. Since driving a car is not con
ducive to writing, I have nearly killed
myself and others on highways or in traf
fic when this constant search for new
ideas, ways to say something better, or
anything to say at all, has proven fruitful.
As a columnist, I had the pleasure of
becoming the object of Andrew
Berkowitz's mockery. And I still have the
power of the pen.
Andrew, the bicycle jokes were funny,
but you must have been scraping for
material to joke about eating disorders.
Trivialize a serious and widespread prob
lem, if you will. However, for someone
who claims to bring us "Tips on Adult
hood," this was childish and insensitive,
and does not belong in The Daily.
To everyone else: Thanks for your feed
back and reassurance, of which I con
stantly reminded myself when I wrote.
Goodbye. I hope that it was good for
you; I know it was for me.
