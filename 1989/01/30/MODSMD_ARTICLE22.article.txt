## A 						brief history of Western culture 
### 
I hope the high level of debate on
the Western Culture — Cultures, Ideas
and Values program will not be too
lowered by the inclusion of this brief
historical primer:
It all began in Greece, in ancient
times a picturesque archipelago of in
significant little city-states that were
constantly at war with one another,
when not too busy enslaving their
neighbors or making their intellectuals
drink hemlock.
Then the Greeks were conquered by
the Romans, who for some perverse
reason thought it a particular sign of
distinction to keep those formerly
persecuted Hellenic intellectuals as
their house slaves, along with the

other assorted cooks, cleaners and con
cubines culled from a diverse selection
of subject peoples.
Which was fine until Rome fell to
the barbarian hordes, who didn't pay
much attention to the Greek and Latin
texts lying around the villas they
burned and pillaged. The barbarian
hordes of Europe were content to live
in feudalism, which was a much less
cultured form of social organization,
since they only had serfs, not slaves.
But just when it looked like Western
culture might be lost forever, the bar
barian hordes, who luckily for us had
by now become religious fanatics,
decided to embark on the most impor
tant enterprise in the history of West
ern civilization — the Crusades.
They went off to liberate the only
petroleum-free corner of the Middle
East from the despotic rule of the
heathen infidels, and discovered that

the heathen infidels (known today as
Muslims) had preserved, in a library in
Alexandria, Egypt, second copies of all
those Greek and Latin books that the
barbarian hordes had torched in Rome.
Their first impulse was to torch
them again, but cooler heads prevailed.
Someone figured out that it might be
worthwhile to reread some of those old
books, and that's what they did. Such
was the birth of the Renaissance.
The barbarian hordes had to tell just
a little white lie, to argue that the
Greek and Roman tradition that they
had onced burned, and that the hea
then infidels had taken such care to
preserve, was in fact their own heri
tage, or in other words, Western cul
ture. That way they cut out the em
barrasing heathen infidel middleman.
The former barbarian hordes showed
the cultural progress they had made by
reinstating the noble institution of
slavery, consulting those newly recov-

ered Greek texts for their justification.
They then went on to found univer
sities where they taught classes in
Western culture, to show how their
dominance of the world was both inev
itable and ultimately in the best inter
est of civilization as a whole. Greece to
Rome to the Renaissance to the En
lightenment to Social Darwinism — a
nice, unbroken path on the evolution
ary march of civilization — and isn't it
just too bad for the Muslims, the Chi
nese, the Aztecs, the Africans and the
Sioux, who had the bad luck to fall
behind or get in the way.
I hope this grotesque oversimplifica
tion of world history serves to show
how flawed the "Great Books" ap
proach to Western culture may be. The
inclusion of token works by Afro-
Americans, women, Latin Americans
and other minorities is not enough to
redeem a course whose origins can be
traced to the historical apology for

European domination.
However, there surely is tremendous
value in a course that uses a core of
common readings to grapple with the
complex moral dilemmas that forge the
"human condition." In fact, no liberal
arts education should be without it.
So what do we do?
• We do not berate a book such as
Rigoberta Menchu as "ideological"
when we accept Plato's justification of
despotism as "a classic."
• We do not say: "Truth is truth and
lies are lies. . . ." Truth is the lie that
happens to have won the last war.
• We remember that the conflict is
deeper than simply "canon" versus
"contemporary": We must recognize
that the canons themselves, for all
their undeniable value, nevertheless
come to us somewhat blood-stained.

So what do we do?
• We do not berate a book such as
Rigoberta Menchu as "ideological"
when we accept Plato's justification of
despotism as "a classic."
• We do not say: "Truth is truth and
lies are lies. . . ." Truth is the lie that
happens to have won the last war.
• We remember that the conflict is
deeper than simply "canon" versus
"contemporary": We must recognize
that the canons themselves, for all
their undeniable value, nevertheless
come to us somewhat blood-stained.
