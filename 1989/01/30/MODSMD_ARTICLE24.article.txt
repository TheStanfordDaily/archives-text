## Law students face court dates with video judge 
### Jonathan Eisenberg 
"In this case, the plaintiff is suing on
behalf of Ms. Criselda Ortiz, who was
killed in a car accident involving your
client, Allen Fleishman," reads the com
puter screen.
A laser videodisc player projects a
crafty attorney questioning a police of
ficer as the computer screen reads,
"Push any button to object."
No, this is not a video game — it is
an interactive law video, the latest high
tech teaching aid for Stanford Law
School students.
During the course of examination, a
student can push a button causing the
judge, played by an actor, to pose a
question such as those used in real trials:
"What is the basis for your objection,
counsel?"
If the student correctly justifies the
objection by choosing from a list of
reasons such as "irrelevant" or "hear
say," the judge nods and says, "Sus
tained."
If the student chooses the wrong ob
jection, the computer prints a detailed
explanation about the proper choice.
"The videos are for teaching skills,"
says Tim Hallahan, a trial lawyer and
video producer. Hallahan created the
first interactive law video at Harvard
University in 1983 and has produced
them primarily at Stanford's Instruc
tional Television Network since 1986.
Videodiscs also teach other essential
law techniques such as how to introduce
evidence, how to cross-examine an expert
witness and how to select a jury.
The videos serve as an optional sup
plement to Law Prof. Miguel Mendez's
evidence class. The class sometimes will
watch a videotaped trial to do a critique.
However, the videos are not designed
to replace Law School faculty. Law School

Dean Paul Breast emphasizes that the
videos teach only "certain basic skills"
and "free the instructor's time for sub
ject matter where direct feedback is
needed. They provide a more efficient
allocation of faculty resources."
According to Hallahan, the student to
faculty ratio at law schools is "huge."
The ratio is close to 60-to-l at Stanford
and about 150-to-l at Harvard, he said.
The video training is also cost
effective, Hallahan says. The equipment
needed to run the system — an IBM-PC
clone, television monitor and videodisc
player — retails for under $2,000.
Although the videos cost tens of thou
sands of dollars to produce, law schools
can rent them for $300 per year, accord
ing to an article in the Jan. 20 San
Francisco Banner, a law journal.
Because a video can take up to two
years to produce, Hallahan allows the
students to write the software and most
of the scripts themselves. "We've
produced 20 complete videos and 40
more are being written," he says. "With
out the students' input, we could not
produce them in such quantity."
In general, faculty response to the
interactive videos has been very positive.
Hallahan notes that the younger "more
practice-oriented" professors have been
more receptive to using the videos. "The
more traditional professors don't really
see the application because the videos
are not designed to teach substance.
Skills are what they teach," he says.
Student response has also been ex
tremely positive. Michael Gooen, a
second- year law student who used the
videos in Mendez's class, says the videos
give students "a chance to see, in a lim
ited sense, what law looks like in the
real world." Before video simulations
were available, "students coming out of
law school were that much more in the
dark about going into court."
