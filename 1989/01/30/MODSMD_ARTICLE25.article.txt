## Stanford gets bitten by the Cobra at McKale 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
TUCSON, Ariz. — When Sean
Elliott scores 31 points and plays
a supporting role, you know
you're in trouble.

Men's Basketball
Arizona 72, Cardinal 52

In a game that most observers
felt would determine the Pacific
10 Conference championship, Ar
izona led from wire to wire and
came away with a 72-52 victory
over Stanford before 13,615 at
McKale Center.
The win, Arizona's 29th
straight on its home floor, ce
mented the Wildcats' hold on first
place in the Pac-10. The sixth
ranked team rose to 9-1 in the
conference and 15-2 overall. No.
19 Stanford (15-5, 7-3) falls to
third place in the Pac-10, one-half
game behind UCLA.
Arizona forward Elliott, nick
named the "Cobra" last year for
his ability to slink up and down
and in and out before striking at
will, once again snakebit the Car
dinal with 9-for-13 shooting from
the field and 12-for-15 from the
free-throw line, as well as a game
high nine rebounds.
But Elliott and the rest of the
Arizona offense, according to
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery, were the least of
Stanford's problems.
"If you look at the basketball
game," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said, "defensively,
we felt we accomplished what we
wanted to. I know that sounds
silly, but 72 points is not a lot of
points. Generally speaking, in a
70-point ball game, we win....Our
problems were on offense, I think
quite obviously."
Indeed, Elliott's 31 points
might have gone for naught, just
as his 35 points did when Stanford

beat Arizona 83-78 at Maples Pa
vilion Jan. 5, if it hadn't been for
Arizona's swarming team defense.
Stanford shot only 41.9 percent
from the field, after shooting 70
percent in the schools' first meet
ing this year. Moreover, the Wild
cats held Stanford to a season-low
in scoring, made 11 steals en route
to forcing 19 Stanford turnovers,
and blocked six shots.
"Arizona is an excellent, excel
lent defensive team," Montgomery
said. "For us to win in a game
like this we have to play virtually
flawless basketball."
In particular, the Wildcats
handcuffed Stanford guard Todd
Lichti, Elliott's counterpart vying
for national honors. Lichti, who
also had 35 points at Maples ear
lier this month, was held to a
season-low 11 yesterday. Senior
forward Howard Wright led Stan
ford in scoring with 14.
Choose the more startling
statistic: Lichti made only two
field goals, and got only five at
tempts.
"The man that was guarding
me was just staying with me all
the time," Lichti said. "As soon
as I put the ball on the floor to
take it to the hoop, someone else
would jump out at me.
"It was frustrating because our
shots weren't falling," Lichti
added, "but I didn't want to start
forcing anything."
It was largely difficult for Lichti
to force anything even if he
wanted to, as Arizona guard Matt
Muehlebach, with help from sub
stitute Harvey Mason, did a great
job of denying Lichti the ball to
begin with.
Lichti had no field goals and
only five points in the first half,
but despite that and Stanford's
13 first-half turnovers, the Car
dinal stayed in the game, trailing
31-21 at halftime.
Stanford had come from behind
four times this season, but as
Wright pointed out, this challenge
was a bit tougher.
"Trying to beat Arizona by 10

points, in 20 minutes, in Tucson,
is not impossible, but it is diffi
cult," Wright said.
But Arizona went on a 11-2 run
over the first 5:28 of the second
half to open a 42-23 lead.
The lead seesawed for most of
the remainder of the game. Stan

ford scored seven straight in the
next 2:32 to cut it to 42-30, but
Arizona got it back up to 20, at
58-38, with 6:56 to go.
Stanford then made its final
bid, scoring six in a row to trail
by only 14 with 5:30 left. But
Arizona boosted it again up to 20

on two free throws by Elliott and
two backcourt steals which led to
four points.
One might have expected Stan
ford to turn to a press in a last
ditch effort to come back,

Forward Howard Wright was the Cardinal's leading scorer against Arizona yesterday with 14 points.
especially as Arizona began run
ning down the clock. But Mont
gomery re-emphasized that
defense was not the problem.
"I think we probably could have
got beat by 100 if we had tried
to extend our defense," he said.
"We just couldn't get the ball in
the hole."
Though it will be difficult for
Stanford to pass Arizona in the
league standings, the Cardinal
still has the inside track on second
place, and therefore second seed
in the Pac-10 tournament in
March.
"We can play better," Mont
gomery said. "We can play with
these guys. We'd like to get them
on a neutral court and play them
again."
There was a particularly tense
moment with 9:49 to go in the
game when Stanford center Eric
Reveno was fouled by Arizona cen
ter Anthony Cook. Reveno went
down on the floor and came up
pointing at Cook, but Reveno said
it was merely out of frustration.
"I just reacted when I shouldn't
have," Reveno said.

Michael Topolovac — Dally

leading scorer, tallied only 11 points in Sunday's loss to the Arizona
Wildcats. The defeat drops the Cardinal to third place in the con
ference, behind Arizona and UCLA.
