# Arizona defense suffocates Lichti
## 
### Jon Wesiman Senior staff writer 
TUCSON, Ariz. â€” Most people
would give anything to be Todd
Lichti.
Craig McMillan was Todd
Lichti, and he played a significant
role in the downfall of the Stan
ford guard and his Cardinal team
mates.
McMillan, Arizona's 12th all
time scorer who is now a graduate
assistant coach for the Wildcats,
played the role of Lichti during
Arizona's practices this week.
Judging by how Arizona held
Lichti to 11 points on its way to
a 72-52 win over Stanford yester
day, one could say McMillan was
better at being Lichti than Lichti.
Arizona guard Matt Mueh
lebach, who covered Lichti for
much of the game, said McMillan
often plays the opposition's star
player in practice, such as Oregon
State's Gary Payton and USC's
Anthony Pendleton.
Muehlebach added that McMil
lan had had some success guard
ing Lichti before graduating last
year, and was able to give Mueh
lebach some helpful tips in con
fronting Stanford's erstwhile
miracle-worker.
"I asked him, 'How'd you play
[Lichti] last year?'" Muehlebach
said. "He told me you don't want
to gamble too much on him, be
cause if you gamble, he'll exploit
you. If you don't get the steal
playing him straight up, you just
have to try to deny him the ball."
For the most part, Muehlebach
and backup guard Harvey Mason
succeeded. Lichti got only five
field-goal attempts, and barely
reached double figures for the
60th straight game with a short
fadeaway jumper with 1:25 left in
the game.
"They made sure they picked
me up in the open court as soon
as we got a rebound," Lichti said.
And when Lichti did get the
ball, Arizona's guards would get
help from their frontline in stop
ping him.
"Someone would jump out on
him, make him think we were
switching," Mason said. "Then
Matt and I would catch up on
him."
The defensive tour de force of

Arizona's backcourt wasn't
reserved for Lichti. Wildcat guard
Ken Lofton was key in forcing
Stanford's point guards, Terry
Taylor and Scott Meinert, into
four turnovers apiece.
"Kenny was going to help Matt
on a number of occasions," Ari
zona Coach Lute Olson said, "and
was still quick enough to cover
Taylor."
But it was Lichti, the future
NBA draft pick, who was going
to bring Stanford back if anybody.
So it was not lost on Muehlebach,
who freely admitted that this was
his best defensive effort ever, that
the man he shut down probably
will have a lot more success in
basketball down the road.
