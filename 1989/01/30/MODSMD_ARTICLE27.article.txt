# Women's swimming totally controls meets vs. Arizona, ASU
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
It is an old axiom of sports that "it's
not over until the fat lady sings." Well
if that's the case, the fat lady sung the
national anthem for the Stanford wom
en's swim team's two meets this weekend.

Women's Swimming
Cardinal 87, Wildcats 53
Cardinal 100, Sun Devils 40

The Cardinal, ranked second national
ly, easily handled Arizona 87-53 in Tuc
son Friday and then defeated Arizona
State 100-40 Saturday in Tempe. Stan
ford is now 4-0 on the season.
"I think we're pretty pleased," fresh
man Dede Trimble said. "I was pretty
happy with the way the weekend turned
out."
Stanford won 27 of 32 events on the
weekend, and if it weren't for the fact

that several Cardinal competitors swam
as exhibition swimmers Friday the score
would have been 103-37.
Leading the way was sophomore Mi
chelle Griglione, who won five different
events over the two days, quadruple win
ners Jenna Johnson and Katie Connors,
and triple winners Trimble and Jill
Johnson. Trimble also recorded NCAA
qualifying times in winning the 200-yard
backstroke and in her opening leg on the
victorious 400 medley relay team Satur
day, becoming the ninth Stanford swim
mer to qualify for the meet.
Things started a little slowly Friday
— no one swam NCAA qualifying times
— but the results of the meet were never
in doubt. Jenna Johnson won the 100
and 200 freestyles, Griglione won the 100
and 200 butterflies, Jill Johnson won the
100 and 200 breaststrokes and Connors
won both the one- and three-meter diving
competitions.
Additionally, Michelle Donahue won

the 100 backstroke, Trimble won the 200
backstroke and Susannah Miller won the
200 individual medley.
"The first day it was tough because of
the weather and the travel," Griglione
said. "Everyone came alive the second
day."
The day started with Trimble's NCAA
qualifying split on the first leg of the
400 medley relay, a split which was also
a pool record. The relay went on to post
a qualifying time as well, and another
pool record.
"It's a big surprise," said Trimble of
her performance. "I'm really happy with
the way I swam." Stanford has three
All-America backstrokers so that places
the freshman in pretty good competition.
Griglione won the 200 and 500 frees
tyles, and the 400 IM Saturday, coming
in four seconds under the NCAA time in
the latter. Jenna Johnson won the 50
freestyle and the 100 butterfly (more

than a second under the NCAA cut),
Trimble won the 100 and 200 backstrokes
and Connors won both diving events. In
four meets this season, Connors has
seven wins and one second in eight events.
Other winners for Stanford Saturday
were Jody Smith in the 1,000 freestyle,
Susan Lenth in the 100 breaststroke,
Jamie Rugless in the 200 butterfly and
Jill Johnson in the 200 breaststroke.
Although the Cardinal times weren't
as fast as the times posted the week
before in wins over UCLA and USC,
many Stanford swimmers weren't swim
ming their best events.
"I was really happy I got to swim some
other events," Griglione said, "because
when we go to the harder meets . . . we're
going to have to swim only our best
events. It's nice to swim some different
events every now and then."
The Cardinal next faces third-ranked
Texas in Austin this Saturday. The Long

horns had their two-plus year dual-meet
winning streak snapped by No. 1 Florida,
56-55, a week ago but they will be a
tough test (perhaps the only one until
the NCAA Championships) for Stanford.
"Everyone's going to have to swim
really fast," Griglione said. "That's al
ways a really fast meet. . . . We've been
looking really strong. If we just keep get
ting faster every week, next week we
have a real good shot."
Trimble agrees. "It's going to be a big
meet," she said. "I'd like to think we're
going to win, but Texas is tough. We're
pretty fast too It's going to be close."
Card note
Divers Connors and Mclisa Kuller and
swimmers Aimee Herzins, Donahue,
Griglione, Jenna Johnson, Jill Johnson, Karon
Kracmer, Barb Metz, Miller and Trimble have
qualified for the NCAA Championships. The
meet will be held in Indianapolis Mar. 16-18.

Susan Lenth in the 100 breaststroke,
Jamie Rugless in the 200 butterfly and
Jill Johnson in the 200 breaststroke.
Although the Cardinal times weren't
as fast as the times posted the week
before in wins over UCLA and USC,
many Stanford swimmers weren't swim
ming their best events.
"I was really happy I got to swim some
other events," Griglione said, "because
when we go to the harder meets . . . we're
going to have to swim only our best
events. It's nice to swim some different
events every now and then."
The Cardinal next faces third-ranked
Texas in Austin this Saturday. The Long

horns had their two-plus year dual-meet
winning streak snapped by No. 1 Florida,
56-55, a week ago but they will be a
tough test (perhaps the only one until
the NCAA Championships) for Stanford.
"Everyone's going to have to swim
really fast," Griglione said. "That's al
ways a really fast meet. . . . We've been
looking really strong. If we just keep get
ting faster every week, next week we
have a real good shot."
Trimble agrees. "It's going to be a big
meet," she said. "I'd like to think we're
going to win, but Texas is tough. We're
pretty fast too It's going to be close."

It is an old axiom of sports that "it's
not over until the fat lady sings." Well
if that's the case, the fat lady sung the
national anthem for the Stanford wom
en's swim team's two meets this weekend.

Cardinal 87, Wildcats 53
Cardinal 100, Sun Devils 40

The Cardinal, ranked second national
ly, easily handled Arizona 87-53 in Tuc
son Friday and then defeated Arizona
State 100-40 Saturday in Tempe. Stan
ford is now 4-0 on the season.
"I think we're pretty pleased," fresh
man Dede Trimble said. "I was pretty
happy with the way the weekend turned
out."
Stanford won 27 of 32 events on the
weekend, and if it weren't for the fact

that several Cardinal competitors swam
as exhibition swimmers Friday the score
would have been 103-37.
Leading the way was sophomore Mi
chelle Griglione, who won five different
events over the two days, quadruple win
ners Jenna Johnson and Katie Connors,
and triple winners Trimble and Jill
Johnson. Trimble also recorded NCAA
qualifying times in winning the 200-yard
backstroke and in her opening leg on the
victorious 400 medley relay team Satur
day, becoming the ninth Stanford swim
mer to qualify for the meet.
Things started a little slowly Friday
— no one swam NCAA qualifying times
— but the results of the meet were never
in doubt. Jenna Johnson won the 100
and 200 freestyles, Griglione won the 100
and 200 butterflies, Jill Johnson won the
100 and 200 breaststrokes and Connors
won both the one- and three-meter diving
competitions.
Additionally, Michelle Donahue won

the 100 backstroke, Trimble won the 200
backstroke and Susannah Miller won the
200 individual medley.
"The first day it was tough because of
the weather and the travel," Griglione
said. "Everyone came alive the second
day."
The day started with Trimble's NCAA
qualifying split on the first leg of the
400 medley relay, a split which was also
a pool record. The relay went on to post
a qualifying time as well, and another
pool record.
"It's a big surprise," said Trimble of
her performance. "I'm really happy with
the way I swam." Stanford has three
All-America backstrokers so that places
the freshman in pretty good competition.
Griglione won the 200 and 500 frees
tyles, and the 400 IM Saturday, coming
in four seconds under the NCAA time in
the latter. Jenna Johnson won the 50
freestyle and the 100 butterfly (more

than a second under the NCAA cut),
Trimble won the 100 and 200 backstrokes
and Connors won both diving events. In
four meets this season, Connors has
seven wins and one second in eight events.
Other winners for Stanford Saturday
were Jody Smith in the 1,000 freestyle,
Susan Lenth in the 100 breaststroke,
Jamie Rugless in the 200 butterfly and
Jill Johnson in the 200 breaststroke.
