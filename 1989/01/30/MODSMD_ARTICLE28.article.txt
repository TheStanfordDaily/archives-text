On paper Humboldt State was
a better team.
On the mats in Maples Pavil
lion, the Cardinal turned the
Lumberjacks into pulp.

Cardinal 3rd in "All Cal" Invite

Indeed, Stanford wrestlers had
a busy weekend. They humbled
Humboldt State 28-10 last Friday
in their first dual meet since No
vember and took third at the "All-
Cal" Invitational Saturday after
noon.
Against Humboldt State, Stan
ford lost only two matches. Steve
Buddie (177 lbs.) and Steve Yar
brough (167 lbs.) highlighted
Stanford's triumph with pins
early in the first round of their
matches. Not to be outdone, Geoff
Baum (150 lbs.) and Ron Perry
(190 lbs.) outwrestled favored op
ponents. "The Humboldt wrestler
was favored going in. This was
just one of those upsets that really
wasn't that close," Stanford
Coach Chris Horpel said of
Baum's 10-4 win over Bill Defen
baugh.
Perry, who decisioned John
Mclntyre 4-2, commented, "he
(Mclntyre) had beaten me earlier
in the finals of the 'Doc Petersen'
Open. He also went to my rival
high school. Humboldt State's
coach told me he was going to get
me this year. He did in an earlier
tournament. Today I turned it
around."

Mark Forman (126 lbs.) and
James Dinette (142 lbs.) also
scored impressive wins.
"On paper we were the under
dogs. But all the matches that we
needed to win went our way. The
coach (Horpel) really got us up
for this one. I think he enjoys
beating Humboldt more than
anyone," Buddie expounded.
In the "All-Cal" Invitational at
San Franscico State, six Stanford
wrestlers placed in the top six for
their weight classes. Yarbrough
captured his second tournament
in a row with a 4-3 decision over
Brian Woods of Cal State
Bakersfield.
Buddie, who had won the two
previous tournaments he had en
tered, finished second to Don
Zeman of UC Davis. Buddie had
beaten Zeman in each of their pre
vious three meetings.
"I didn't have my head in the
match. It's hard to get up for the
same guy four times. I guess he
had a little more to gain by
beating me this time," Buddie la
mented.
Perry and Lisle (134 lbs.) also
grabbed second place honors.
Along with second place, Lisle was
awarded the "most pins in the
least amount of time" award for
the tournament.
Forman and Baum took home
third and fourth, respectively.
Dave Nahama (heavyweight) com
peted but did not place.
Dave Nowick (118 lbs.), James
Dinette (142 lbs.), and Matt
Nowlis (158 lbs.) were forced out
of tournament action due to inju
ries.
Horpel concluded, "The team
did really well over the weekend.
The attitude is good. We are now
entering the final third of our

season â€” the homestretch. The
injuries we have are minor, so I
don't think we are going to be
limping the rest of the way. People
have shown visible improvement.
We are just going to try to do
well at the rest of the dual meets
and get ready for the conference
tournament."
