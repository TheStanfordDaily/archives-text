# Hoops wins two in Oregon

It may have been the homecoming for Stanford's
Oregon-bred forwards, but it was Wisconsin-native
Sonja Henning who stole the show this weekend.
Tallying 30 points for the weekend, the sophomore
point guard led the Pacific 10 Conference-leading
Cardinal past Oregon Friday night and Oregon State
Saturday.

Cardinal 75, Beavers 64

Stanford, ranked sixth in the nation in the latest
Associated Press poll, lived well up to the acclaim.
The Cardinal now boasts an impressive 15-2 overall
record and a 7-0 league mark.
The trip home could not have been more pleasant
for starting forwards Katy Steding and Trisha
Stevens. Facing two diametrically-opposite teams,
the Cardinal adapted commendably to the different
styles en route to the sweep.
"Oregon State and Oregon are almost night and
day," Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"Oregon is passive — they have a big girl in the
middle and make you shoot outside. Oregon State
is physical, presses and can cause a lot of turnovers."
Of the two, Stanford dealt best with the Ducks.
Though 6-foot-7 center Stephanie Kasperski led the
game with 29 points, the rest of her team was
unable to match-up with the Cardinal's talented
roster.
Case in point was Oregon forward Trina
McCartney, last week's Pac-10 Player of the Week.
The very next against California she scored
24 points, but the tough Cardinal defense held her
to a mere six on Friday. Apart from Kasperski, only
one other player broke double figures.

Point guard Sonja Henning led the No. 6 Cardinal's sweep of Oregon and Oregon
State this weekend. Henning had 12 of the Cardinal's 15 assists against Oregon
State on Sunday, a career high.
