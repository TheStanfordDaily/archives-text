# Hoops wins two in Oregon

It may have been the homecoming for Stanford's
Oregon-bred forwards, but it was Wisconsin-native
Sonja Henning who stole the show this weekend.
Tallying 30 points for the weekend, the sophomore
point guard led the Pacific 10 Conference-leading
Cardinal past Oregon Friday night and Oregon State
Saturday.

Stanford, ranked sixth in the nation in the latest
Associated Press poll, lived well up to the acclaim.
The Cardinal now boasts an impressive 15-2 overall
record and a 7-0 league mark.
The trip home could not have been more pleasant
for starting forwards Katy Steding and Trisha
Stevens. Facing two diametrically-opposite teams,
the Cardinal adapted commendably to the different
styles en route to the sweep.
"Oregon State and Oregon are almost night and
day," Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"Oregon is passive — they have a big girl in the
middle and make you shoot outside. Oregon State
is physical, presses and can cause a lot of turnovers."
Of the two, Stanford dealt best with the Ducks.
Though 6-foot-7 center Stephanie Kasperski led the
game with 29 points, the rest of her team was
unable to match-up with the Cardinal's talented
roster.
Case in point was Oregon forward Trina
McCartney, last week's Pac-10 Player of the Week.
The very next against California she scored
24 points, but the tough Cardinal defense held her
to a mere six on Friday. Apart from Kasperski, only
one other player broke double figures.

Point guard Sonja Henning led the No. 6 Cardinal's sweep of Oregon and Oregon
State this weekend. Henning had 12 of the Cardinal's 15 assists against Oregon
State on Sunday, a career high.
For the Cardinal, however, the
night marked a successful offen
sive outing. Henning scored 12
points, but her backcourt comple
ment Jennifer Azzi recorded a
career-high 24 to lead the team.

"Jennifer shot the ball ex
tremely well," VanDerveer
recalled. "They were giving her
the 3-point shot. If you let her
stand out there and shoot it, she'll
tear you apart."
It was the team's 3-point shoot
ing, in fact, that really buried the
lame Ducks. Stanford made a
school-record eight 3-pointers out
of another record 19 attempts, in
cluding two each by Henning and
Azzi, three by Steding and one by
freshman Martha Richards.
The sole problem plaguing the
Cardinal was tight officiating. A
large amount of fouls were called,
placing several players in foul
trouble and forcing VanDerveer
to draw heavily on her bench.
Rather than becoming a bane,
however, the bench became a
blessing. Especially on defense,
the reserves held their own and
made some key plays.
"The real story was team
depth," VanDerveer said. "We got
on them right away and we were
aggressive. The one concern I had
was that we had a lot of fouls,
but the team depth and being able
to substitute with confidence
helped that situation a lot."
An added bonus was rest for
the starters, who would have to
play extensively the following eve
ning against the pressing Beavers.
Though still a little tired toward
the end of the Oregon State game,
the rest was certainly of help at
the start.
True to tradition, OSU Coach
Aki Hill's team pressed from tip
off to buzzer. This posed some
problems in the first half, which
ended with the Cardinal leading

by a mere deuce, but Stanford
overcame them in the second half
with Henning's passing and
Steding's scoring.
Steding became Henning's fa
vorite target. Many of the point
guard's career-high 12 assists
were aimed at Steding, who
amassed a whopping 22 points for
the game to accompany her 10
rebounds.
"I got some great passes from
Sonja, and just stuck with my
shot," Steding said, adding that
"there's a certain edge you get
from being at home."
Though playing several
thousand miles from home, Hen
ning put on a show that the Cor
vallis crowd will probably remem
ber for a while. Driving almost at
will, Henning sped by defenders
to set up spectacular shots or
smooth passes.
"Sonja was the catalyst in run
ning our offense," VanDerveer
said. "She did a great job of
penetrating the weak parts of
their zone and passing off. I hope
that some of our other guards
learn from Sonja's success."
Henning also scored 18 points,
good enough for membership
along with Steding in the double
double club. Steding also earned
a place in the 3-point bomb squad
with her incredible 4-of-5
showing.
State-mate Stevens also im
pressed her hometown crowd.
Raised just a few miles from Cor
vallis in Philomath, Stevens had
a respectable contingent amid the
Beaver boosters.
The sophomore responded well,
netting 16 points and seven
rebounds.
"Trisha had a really strong in
side game," VanDerveer said. "At
the end of the game, she was
guarding (Chelle) Flamoe, Oregon
State's leading scorer, and did a
great job. She handled the pres
sure really well."
Flamoe, rated sixth in the
league in scoring with a 17.2 ppg
average, only scored 16 on Satur
day. Izzy Maryntschak notched
15, while Yasmin Gray tallied 10.
Card notes
Due to television, this weekend's
Pac-10 action has not yet been con
cluded. Tonight at 9 pm, ESPN will
broadcast live a most important
match-up of UCLA at Washington
which may well determine who will
challenge Stanford for the league title.
Washington is currently 6-1 in Pac
-10 and UCLA is 5-1, with both losses
inflicted by the Cardinal.
Next on Stanford's schedule are Ar
izona State and Arizona, who will visit
the Farm on Friday night and Satur
day night, respectively. The Cardinal
should still be No. 6 in the country
(if not higher); check 'em out.
