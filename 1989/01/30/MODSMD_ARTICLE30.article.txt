# Punchless Card loses two to Broncos
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Editorial staff 
While the Stanford baseball
team's loss to Santa Clara on Fri
day a was bizarre contest with
many odyssean twists and turns,
Sunday's loss to the same team
can be explained in two words —
no bats.

Baseball
Fit Broncos 3, Cardinal 2
Sun: Broncos 3, Cardinal 2

Both games of the weekend se
ries ended up with the same score,
but they could not have con
trasted more.
Friday's game at Buck Shaw
Stadium was a marathon contest
that lasted into the night. At
game's end, there were only about
200 fans left of the original 2,000,
and those that stayed were left
wondering whether they were wit
nessing the coldest baseball since
the Twins moved to the Homer
Dome.
The game started out in
nocuously enough for both teams,
with neither team scoring until
the top of the seventh. Stanford
starter Stan Spencer survived a
brief scare in the first, when
Bronco leadoff man Ed Giovanola
ripped a double to the gap in left
center field and Drew Miller fol
lowed with a single.
But Spencer recovered quickly
by getting three quick outs. The
sophomore showed good poise by
inducing Bronco catcher Troy
Buckley, a .442 hitter last season
to pop up to Frank Carey at sec
ond base.
The Cardinal threatened in the
top of the third when catcher Eric
Cox hit a double deep to center.
After center fielder Eric DeGraw

grounded out to the pitcher, Cox
went to third on a single by leadoff
hitter Frank Carey. However, he
could progress no further when
left fielder Jack Hollis hit into an
inning-ending double play.
Stanford finally broke through
against Santa Clara starter Greg
Gohr in the top of the seventh
when designated hitter Roger
Burnett reached first on an error.
Third baseman Tim Griffin made
Cardinal fans temporarily forget
Ed Sprague (who hit 22 home runs
last year) when he lashed a
double, sending Burnett to third.
Following a ground-out by Cox,
DeGraw poked a triple into the
right field gap, scoring both run
ners and giving Stanford the lead,
2-0.

When pinch hitter
Mike Eicher hit a
long fly ball to right
that didn't quite
make it to the
fence, the Cardinal
was a run short
once again.

Back-to-back homers in the
eighth off relief ace Steve Chitren
by Buckley and Craig Middlekauf
(a recent transfer from UC-Santa
Barbara who became eligible only
four days before) erased Stan
ford's lead.
As the sun set and the lights
went on, the fans became resigned
that it was going to be a long

game. The Stanford offense could
only manage one hit after the
eighth inning, while Chitren con
tinued to pitch himself into —
and out of — bases-loaded jams.
Finally, in the bottom of the
eleventh, the Broncos played like
the team that Destiny had or
dained the winner.
After getting ground-outs from
Howie Kennedy and Giovanola,
Chitren was a victim of bad luck
when shortstop Troy Paulsen
bobbled an inning-ending ground
ball and allowed Miller to reach
first base. After Toole singled him
over to second, Buckley drove
home the game winner with a
ground ball up the middle, send
ing the disappointed and chilled
Cardinal fans wandering into the
night.
Sunday's game dawned with a
lot more promise as Stanford re
turned to the friendly confines of
sundrenched Sunken Diamond.
But not even the vocal hometown

fans could induce the Cardinal
bats to hit it into a Bronco-free
zone.
There were some surprising
changes to the Stanford lineup in
the second game, with Tim Griffin
(3-for-4 Friday) moved up to sec
ond in the batting order and
freshman Steve Solomon getting
the starting nod in left field.
On the mound, it seemed like
old times as standout Mike Mus
sina got the start and pitched well
after encountering some problems
in the first two innings.
With two outs in the second
stanza, Bronco designated hitter
Bill Enos singled, and a single by
first baseman Andy Solomon
moved him to second. Then
Giovanola, who hit .333 against
the Cardinal this weekend,
knocked a triple to score both
Enos and Solomon. After that, it
was smooth sailing for Mussina,
who ended up with six strikeouts
while giving up no walks.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
Bronco starter Larry Donahe en
joyed smooth sailing as well. He
gave up only three hits, and never
saw a runner go past second base.
Stanford had something going
in the bottom of the fourth, when
rightfielder Paul Carey doubled.
However the threat was quickly
snuffed when Paulsen grounded
to the shortstop and Carey, com
mitting a rare baserunning error,
got caught off second base and
was thrown out.
In the Bronco half of the eighth,
Middlekauf again came through,
crushing a solo home run off
reliever Scott Weiss. It was the
only hit Weiss gave up in three
innings work.
It was not until the eighth and
ninth innings that the Cardinal
was able to get to Bronco pitching.
With reliever David Currie on the
mound in the eighth, freshman
David Holbrook (who came in to
pinch hit for Brian Johnson) sin
gled and moved to third on con
secutive walks to DeGraw and
Frank Carey which loaded the
bases. Tim Griffin grounded to
the shortstop to start a double
play, but the Cardinal's first run
made it across the plate.
In the ninth, Burnett singled
and fellow sophmore Ryan Turner
reached on an error by Giovanola.
Once again Holbrook made a good
case for a place in the starting
lineup with a double that scored
Burnett, but when pinch hitter
Mike Eicher hit a long fly ball to
right that didn't quite make it to

the fence, the Cardinal was a run
short once again.
After the game, Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess stressed the pos
itive aspects of the weekend
"Holbrook did a real good job. I
was pleased with the bench today,
we have some young talent so
we'll give them the opportunity
to play."
There is no time for the Car
dinal to let up. Today's game
against San Jose State should be
tough, and Stanford is going to
need an offensive shot in the arm
if it is to beat the Spartans.
This could mean more lineup
changes for Marquess. "It's not
like football where you can put
in new plays, but I'm looking to
get guys that can swing the bat
in there," he said.

the award for most indecisive umpires
has to go to the men in blue at Fri
day's game. On one occasion, none of
them were sure if Chitren had hit
Bronco batter Kennedy, so they
checked for shoe polish on the ball in
the eleventh inning. When they
couldn't find any, they called for the
play to be done over.
Some outstanding young pitchers
emerged for the Cardinal this week
end, namely Weiss and freshman
lefthander Steve Worrell who pitched
two innings on Friday, giving up no
runs and striking out two.
While Stanford has never lost its
first two games under Marquess'
tutelage, it has dropped the season
opener in the last two years, after
which the Cardinal went on to win
the national championship. Last
year's opening day loss: 3-2 at Santa
Clara (you'd better buy your plane
tickets to Omaha early).
