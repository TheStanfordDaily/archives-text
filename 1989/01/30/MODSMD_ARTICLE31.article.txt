# San Jose State at Stanford
## 
### 
TODAY — Sunken Diamond, 2 p.m.
RECORDS — Stanford (0-2), San Jose State (3-0).
INJURIES - None.
SPARTAN UPOATE — San Jose State is in the words of its own media
guide "young and inexperienced," yet the team is 3-0. Look for returning
veterans Kevin Tannahill, Steve Anderson and John Bracken to spark
the Spartans offensively. Anderson is only a sophomore, but he broke
into the starting lineup last season to hit .302. Bracken, one of the few
seniors on the squad is the top offensive threat. He hit .307 with 38
RBl's last season.
CARDINAL UPDATE — Junior right fielder Paul Carey had a hot weekend,
going 3-for-7 with two doubles. When he gets on base, he's always a
threat to steal. Newcomer Oavid Holbrook, a freshman, could break into
the starting lineup. He was 2-for-2 on Sunday against Santa Clara, and
showed he could hit the ball hard.
KEYS TO VICTORY — Stanford must do something about its anemic hitting.
The top of the order must get things going and get on the basepaths
in order to manufacture runs. With Brian Keyser on the mound today,
and a very deep bullpen to back him up, Stanford should be able to
hold the Spartans to very few runs.
