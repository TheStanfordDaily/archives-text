# Card volleyball hopes to find pot of gold at end of Rainbows
## 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
Hawaii volleyball fans have pre
sented Honolulu's city council
with a proposal. They would like
for the university's home city to
be renamed Allentown.
The change would, of course,
be in honor of the Rainbow-
Warriors' All-World outside hit
ter, Allen Allen. Though he is
listed at that position, it seems
any specific position name would
be too restrictive to apply to this
player that is the epitome of di
versity. In addition to being his
squad's leading hitter, Allen is
also feared for his stellar blocking,
but Stanford coach Fred Sturm
claims that Allen does not stop
there. "He does it all. Of course
he's a great hitter and blocker.
But he's a very good passer and
a great digger."
Besides being a very real con
tender for NCAA Player of the
Year, the 6-foot-3 Allen also lists
as accolades a 45-inch vertical
leap, and a bench-press maximum
of 345 pounds. In fact, Allen is
such a great natural athlete,
several NFL scouts have ex
pressed interest in him.
For now, though, Hawaii coach
Alan Rosehill is just happy to have
Allen as one of the many weapons
in his Rainbow-Warrior arsenal.
This team is simply stacked with
talent, which is probably why
Hawaii has found itself at the top
of the WIVA standings and
ranked No. 1 nationally.
Other standouts 112 * the Rain
bows are All-Amt »:a middle
blocker Carlos Briceno, a 6-3 force
at the net. Brian Poppinga, a 6-4

'Hawaii is a team
that, historically,
we have played
well against.... All
we have to do is
play our game —
play up to our abil
ity — and we'll be
right with them.'
— Fred Sturm

junior, has the potential to follow
in Briceno's footsteps on the All-
America team. Setter Lyman
Lacro, standing 6-1 is, according
to Rosehill, "the most underrated
player in the conference."
The Cardinal will certainly have
its hands full against the Rain
bows. However, Stanford's prep
aration for its WIVA foe has not
gone quite as smoothly as Stan
ford volleyball fans might have
hoped. Setter Ryan O'Hara went
down over the weekend with a
strained quadricep muscle, and
flu bugs hampered both compo
nents of the Cardinal's one-two
hitting punch, Scott Fortune and
Dan Hanan.
Stanford Coach Fred Sturm,
though, insists that the setbacks
will play no part in the matches
on Monday and Tuesday night.
"All I can say about O'Hara, For
tune, and Hanan is that they will

be there. O'Hara's iryury is just
a slight strain, and Scott and Dan
are fine."
Sturm not only thinks his team
will be at full-strength, but he
also feels good about its chances
against the Rainbow-Warriors.
Sturm qualifies his optimism:
"Hawaii is a team that, histori
cally, we have played well against.
Last year, we took them to five
(games) at their place, and we had
our chances in game four. They
have basically the same lineup
this year, and we have improved.
All we have to do is play our game
— play up to our ability — and
we'll be right with them."
When asked if he would make
any adjustments for the powerful
Allen, Sturm replied, "We will
treat him like any other good
player. We won't change anything
for him, but we'll be aware of
where he is at all times. If he
starts killing us, sure, we'll have
to make some adjustments during
the game."
Sturm continued, "The thing
about Hawaii is that they are so
deep; they have 11 different guys
they could throw at you. We've
really got to be alert for all of
their different looks. It would be
very tough to try to shut down
Allen, but even if we could, some
body else would come at us."
Hey Stanford volleyball fans:
this is as good as it gets. On both
Monday and Tuesday night, four
All-Americas and several others
with All-America potential will go
toe-to-toe in a dogfight that has
NCAA tourney implications. No.
6 in the nation hosts No. 1 at
Maples Pavilion. This one is not
to be missed.

(games) at their place, and we had
our chances in game four. They
have basically the same lineup
this year, and we have improved.
All we have to do is play our game
— play up to our ability — and
we'll be right with them."
When asked if he would make
any adjustments for the powerful
Allen, Sturm replied, "We will
treat him like any other good
player. We won't change anything
for him, but we'll be aware of
where he is at all times. If he
starts killing us, sure, we'll have
to make some adjustments during
the game."
Sturm continued, "The thing
about Hawaii is that they are so
deep; they have 11 different guys
they could throw at you. We've
really got to be alert for all of
their different looks. It would be
very tough to try to shut down
Allen, but even if we could, some
body else would come at us."
Hey Stanford volleyball fans:
this is as good as it gets. On both
Monday and Tuesday night, four
All-Americas and several others
with All-America potential will go
toe-to-toe in a dogfight that has
NCAA tourney implications. No.
6 in the nation hosts No. 1 at
Maples Pavilion. This one is not
to be missed.

two-match series that begins tonight at Maples Pavilion.
Hawaii volleyball fans have pre
sented Honolulu's city council
with a proposal. They would like
for the university's home city to
be renamed Allentown.
The change would, of course,
be in honor of the Rainbow-
Warriors' All-World outside hit
ter, Allen Allen. Though he is
listed at that position, it seems
any specific position name would
be too restrictive to apply to this
player that is the epitome of di
versity. In addition to being his
squad's leading hitter, Allen is
also feared for his stellar blocking,
but Stanford coach Fred Sturm
claims that Allen does not stop
there. "He does it all. Of course
he's a great hitter and blocker.
But he's a very good passer and
a great digger."
Besides being a very real con
tender for NCAA Player of the
Year, the 6-foot-3 Allen also lists
as accolades a 45-inch vertical
leap, and a bench-press maximum
of 345 pounds. In fact, Allen is
such a great natural athlete,
several NFL scouts have ex
pressed interest in him.
For now, though, Hawaii coach
Alan Rosehill is just happy to have
Allen as one of the many weapons
in his Rainbow-Warrior arsenal.
This team is simply stacked with
talent, which is probably why
Hawaii has found itself at the top
of the WIVA standings and
ranked No. 1 nationally.
Other standouts 112 * the Rain
bows are All-Amt »:a middle
blocker Carlos Briceno, a 6-3 force
at the net. Brian Poppinga, a 6-4

'Hawaii is a team
that, historically,
we have played
well against.... All
we have to do is
play our game —
play up to our abil
ity — and we'll be
right with them.'
— Fred Sturm

junior, has the potential to follow
in Briceno's footsteps on the All-
America team. Setter Lyman
Lacro, standing 6-1 is, according
to Rosehill, "the most underrated
player in the conference."
The Cardinal will certainly have
its hands full against the Rain
bows. However, Stanford's prep
aration for its WIVA foe has not
gone quite as smoothly as Stan
ford volleyball fans might have
hoped. Setter Ryan O'Hara went
down over the weekend with a
strained quadricep muscle, and
flu bugs hampered both compo
nents of the Cardinal's one-two
hitting punch, Scott Fortune and
Dan Hanan.
Stanford Coach Fred Sturm,
though, insists that the setbacks
will play no part in the matches
on Monday and Tuesday night.
"All I can say about O'Hara, For
tune, and Hanan is that they will

be there. O'Hara's iryury is just
a slight strain, and Scott and Dan
are fine."
Sturm not only thinks his team
will be at full-strength, but he
also feels good about its chances
against the Rainbow-Warriors.
Sturm qualifies his optimism:
"Hawaii is a team that, histori
cally, we have played well against.
Last year, we took them to five
(games) at their place, and we had
our chances in game four. They
have basically the same lineup
this year, and we have improved.
All we have to do is play our game
— play up to our ability — and
we'll be right with them."
When asked if he would make
any adjustments for the powerful
Allen, Sturm replied, "We will
treat him like any other good
