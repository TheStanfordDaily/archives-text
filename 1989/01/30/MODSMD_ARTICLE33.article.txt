# O'Meara wins at Pebble

PEBBLE BEACH, Calif.
(AP) â€” Mark O'Meara made a
six-foot birdie putt on the final
hole and scored a one-shot vic
tory Sunday in the Pebble
Beach National Pro-Am.
O'Meara's winning putt
finished off a round of 70 and
made Tom Kite a disappointed
runner-up for the second time
in as many months on the
Pebble Beach Golf Links.
O'Meara, who hadn't won on
the PGA Tour for four years,
captured the fourth title of his
career with a 277 total, 11
shots under par.
The victory, his second in
this unique event, was worth
$180,000 from the total purse
of $1 million.
Kite, who lost a playoff in
the rich Nabisco Champion
ships at Pebble Beach in No
vember, had a share of the top
spot and was standing by the

18th green when O'Meara's
winner found the cup.
Kite finished with a 69 and
a 278 total.
There was little consolation
in the $108,000 check for sec
ond place, which lifted him into
third place on the all-time
money-winning list. He now
trails only Jack Nicklaus and
Tom Watson.
"Finishing second for the
second time is tougher. It really
hurts," Kite said.
He singled out a string of
three consecutive bogeys, on
the seventh through ninth
holes, as "where I lost the golf
tournament."
Two of those three bogeys
came on three-putt greens.
"Ludicrous," Kite said.
He brought it back to tie
O'Meara, and once went ahead
with an eight-foot birdie putt
on the 14th hole.
