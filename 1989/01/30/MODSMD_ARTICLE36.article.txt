# Scholars discuss future U.S. policies
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Throwing money at social prob
lems, grieving over the deficit and
placing too much trust in Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev were
among the policies scorned by a
collection of 14 prominent scholars
who gathered for a day-long "Is
sues of the '90s" conference Sat
urday.
In addition to a 30-minute ad
dress by former U.S. Attorney
General Edwin Meese 111, the pro
gram featured three panels that
addressed broad areas which will
occupy the national agenda in the
coming decade: U.S. social policy,
economic policy and the emer
gence of open societies across the
globe.
About 500 attended the confer
ence, which was sponsored by the
Stanford Alumni Association and
the Hoover Institution.
Meese, as well as those who par
ticipated in the panel discussions,

are contributors to the Hoover
book, "Thinking About America:
The United States in the 19905,"
which was released last Septem
ber.
In addition to delivering his
speech, Meese joined two other
scholars on the social policy panel
in suggesting ways in which pol
icies of the Reagan administration
could be tailored to meet the chal
lenges of the next 10 years.
While Meese said that many
welfare programs are still in great
need of overhaul, he asserted,
"It's not a lack of funding that
is responsible for these continuing
problems."
Meese suggested that policy
makers need to conduct more fac
tual analyses before making hasty
policy decisions. Uninformed
ideas have bad consequences,
Meese said.
Speaking on the same panel,
June O'Neill, the director of the
Center for the Study of Business

and Government and an econom
ics professor at Baruch College,
echoed Meese's sentiments.
Raising welfare benefits, she said,
"would undoubtedly increase the
welfare case loads."
As part of the economic policy
panel, Berekely Public Policy
Prof. Aaron Wildavsky said there
is no need to make eliminating
the budget deficit one of the top
priorities on the national agenda.
The nation is more likely to be
hurt by attempts to eliminate the
deficit than by the deficit itself,
he said.
Stanford Economics Prof.
Robert Hall concurred. The cur
rent amount of the deficit is "just
about exactly right," Hall said. In
fact, he added, the budget deficit
is a useful tool for keeping federal
spending under control.
In a wide-ranging discussion of
the emergence of open societies,
all panelists agreed that Marxism
had failed as an economic model.
