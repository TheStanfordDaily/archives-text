# Conference focuses on crisis prevention

### Amy Rosenfeld Senior staff writer 
To save the environment, people must
"make credible again the [idea] that there
is value in doing something for others and
that we can get by with less," according
to Ted Koppel, host of the ABC news show
"Nightline."
Koppel, who earned his masters degree
in speech and drama from Stanford in 1962,
returned to campus Saturday to moderate
the main plenary session of the "You Can
Make a Difference Conference" on "Decid
ing Our Environmental Future."
The panel discussion, which addressed
environmental policy-making in the 19905,
featured five environmental issues experts
representing government and big business
as well as environmental groups.
Greg Watson, executive director of the
Massachusetts Office of Science and Tech
nology, called for a revolution in the way
people view and treat the environment and
stressed the urgency of immediate action.
Humans have a tendency to "fall into
the trap of gradualism," believing that
people can afford to change their ways

slowly, the way nature does, Watson said.
Yet, "the earth is going to let us know
very soon that (our present rate of growth)
can't continue," he added.
David Brower, founder and chair of the
Earth Island Institute, proposed changing
the name of the conference to "You Damn
Well Better Make a Difference." Humans
have a "gross oversupply of hubris and we
haven't been on the planet long enough to
deserve it,"he said.

Ted Koppel, host of the ABC news show "Nightline," strikes a
thoughtful pose while while mediating Saturday's plenary session
of the "You Can Make a Difference" conference.
The panelists urged young
people to take action for the en
vironment and promoted the idea
of "thinking globally but acting
locally," a common phrase for
grass roots action.
"There's no hope in my mind
for my generation, forget it," Joan
Martin-Brown, a representative of
the United Nations Environment
Programme said.
Koppel noted, however, that
motivating people is not easy.
"When we have a crisis in this
country, of course we can respond
to it; we always do," he said.
"The trick is to motivate the
public to do things before the
crisis comes about, not after,"
Koppel added.
The international environmen
tal problem is caused by the "ag
gregate of neglect" at the local
level. "We're all upwind or down
stream from somebody else," but
the more people pass the problem
on to the government, the less
the solution is going to meet their
specific needs, she said.
According to Judith Ayres, vice
president of William D. Ruckel
shaus Associates, parents must
educate their children that one
person's actions can affect the en
tire world because "the earth is
one system."

Martin-Brown concurred,
"Most kids think toilet paper
comes from the Safeway store and
don't know it connects to trees."
Humans must learn to separate
their needs from wants, Martin-
Brown said. The media says wants
are needs, but the true issue is
not more versus less but "how
much do people need to live in
dignity and without fear," she
said.
According to Brower, people
need to be made aware what this
country's rate of growth is costing
the planet. "What we keep
hearing are the benefits but they
never tell you the costs."
James Sullivan, vice chair of the
Chevron corporation, defended
the environmental responsibility
of large corporations, especially
oil-producing ones.
Sullivan outlined programs
funded by Chevron that gave pri
ority to educating the public about
environmental problems.
However, Martin-Brown said
she is "very uncomfortable when
a corporation addresses environ
mental problems through a public
affairs route" instead of through
corporate policy.
According to Brower, the cor
porate world needs to adopt
"green capitalism." It should be
possible for a CEO to forgo a
profitable program for an ecologi
cal reason without fear of being
sued by the stockholders, he said.

According to Brower, people
need to be made aware what this
country's rate of growth is costing
the planet. "What we keep
hearing are the benefits but they
never tell you the costs."
James Sullivan, vice chair of the
Chevron corporation, defended
the environmental responsibility
of large corporations, especially
oil-producing ones.
Sullivan outlined programs
funded by Chevron that gave pri
ority to educating the public about
environmental problems.
However, Martin-Brown said
she is "very uncomfortable when
a corporation addresses environ
mental problems through a public
affairs route" instead of through
corporate policy.
According to Brower, the cor
porate world needs to adopt
"green capitalism." It should be
possible for a CEO to forgo a
profitable program for an ecologi
cal reason without fear of being
sued by the stockholders, he said.
