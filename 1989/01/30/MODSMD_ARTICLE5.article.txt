To save the environment, people must
"make credible again the [idea] that there
is value in doing something for others and
that we can get by with less," according
to Ted Koppel, host of the ABC news show
"Nightline."
Koppel, who earned his masters degree
in speech and drama from Stanford in 1962,
returned to campus Saturday to moderate
the main plenary session of the "You Can
Make a Difference Conference" on "Decid
ing Our Environmental Future."
The panel discussion, which addressed
environmental policy-making in the 19905,
featured five environmental issues experts
representing government and big business
as well as environmental groups.
Greg Watson, executive director of the
Massachusetts Office of Science and Tech
nology, called for a revolution in the way
people view and treat the environment and
stressed the urgency of immediate action.
Humans have a tendency to "fall into
the trap of gradualism," believing that
people can afford to change their ways

slowly, the way nature does, Watson said.
Yet, "the earth is going to let us know
very soon that (our present rate of growth)
can't continue," he added.
David Brower, founder and chair of the
Earth Island Institute, proposed changing
the name of the conference to "You Damn
Well Better Make a Difference." Humans
have a "gross oversupply of hubris and we
haven't been on the planet long enough to
deserve it,"he said.
