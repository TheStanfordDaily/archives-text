# Expert warns world faces deadly problems

### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
Kicking off the "You Can Make a Dif
ference Conference" with a warning, a
renowned environmental expert said in Sat
urday's keynote address, "The world is in
trouble" and "needs us more badly than
it ever has before."
Peter Raven, director of the Missouri
Botanical Garden and secretary of the Na
tional Academy of Sciences, lambasted cur
rent U.S. policy towards environmental
threats such as the depletion of the ozone
layer, disposal of wastes, overpopulation
and the destruction of forest habitats.
As a world leader in politics, wealth and
consumption of resources, the United
States has a responsibility to take the lead
in recognizing and solving these problems,
Raven told a packed Kresge Auditorium
audience.

But most people here don't know about
these dangers and don't care, he said, and
U.S. policy-makers are not acting effective
ly-
For example, Raven charged that it is
"totally unacceptable morally" to dump
dangerous U.S. wastes on foreign territory,
regardless of our ability to induce weaker
states to accept the refuse.
The populations of Third World countries
are booming and one-quarter of the world's
people are living in poverty, Raven said.
"How is the United States reacting?" he
asked. "We're reacting to it by cutting our
allocations" to the World Health Organi
zation by 25 percent, and "our record with
other international organizations is even
worse."

Brazilian Amazon, Raven said,
and those fires "contributed 10
percent of the carbon dioxide
loading" in the atmosphere for
that year. The destruction of the
rainforest caused by those fires,
he explained, is killing off an
ecological and economic resource
of incalculable proportions.
According to Raven, the fires
occur because the Brazilian gov
ernment does not have the
strength or finances to adequately
help its poor. The government
simply builds roads to the rain
forest and lets the poor fend for
themselves.
Debt payments are the nugor
reason Brazil is allowing the
destruction of the rainforest,
Raven said. Because the large
sums that Third World nations
must send to Western powers as
payments on past loans weaken
and destabilize the debtor nations,
he charged, demanding the pay
ments is like "declaring war on
them."
Near the conclusion of his
speech, Raven said the world's
"situation is hideously difficult,"
and it will be solved only by
cooperation, conciliation, respect
and mutual interest.
Raven advocated using "an in
ternational viewpoint everywhere
you go." For example, he sugges
ted people look at the relationship
between the United States and
Mexico and not think of Mexico
in terms of drugs, illegal immi
gration and debt payments.
