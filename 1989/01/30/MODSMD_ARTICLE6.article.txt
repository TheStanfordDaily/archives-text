Kicking off the "You Can Make a Dif
ference Conference" with a warning, a
renowned environmental expert said in Sat
urday's keynote address, "The world is in
trouble" and "needs us more badly than
it ever has before."
Peter Raven, director of the Missouri
Botanical Garden and secretary of the Na
tional Academy of Sciences, lambasted cur
rent U.S. policy towards environmental
threats such as the depletion of the ozone
layer, disposal of wastes, overpopulation
and the destruction of forest habitats.
As a world leader in politics, wealth and
consumption of resources, the United
States has a responsibility to take the lead
in recognizing and solving these problems,
Raven told a packed Kresge Auditorium
audience.

But most people here don't know about
these dangers and don't care, he said, and
U.S. policy-makers are not acting effective
ly-
For example, Raven charged that it is
"totally unacceptable morally" to dump
dangerous U.S. wastes on foreign territory,
regardless of our ability to induce weaker
states to accept the refuse.
The populations of Third World countries
are booming and one-quarter of the world's
people are living in poverty, Raven said.
"How is the United States reacting?" he
asked. "We're reacting to it by cutting our
allocations" to the World Health Organi
zation by 25 percent, and "our record with
other international organizations is even
worse."
