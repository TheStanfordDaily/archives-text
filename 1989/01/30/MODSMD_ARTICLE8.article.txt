# Policy outlined to control cats
## 
### Mike Habata 
In less than a month, Stanford mice will breathe
more easily. Unidentified cats on campus will be
trapped and taken to the Santa Clara Humane Cen
ter according to a plan devised last week to combat
the increase of Stanford's roaming felines.
After a meeting Friday to discuss the problem of
the feral, or wild, cat population at Stanford, Uni
versity officials and those representing the welfare
of the cats agreed to a policy.
Because officials expect an increase in the cat
population this spring, the University has contracted
the Crane Pest Control company to trap feral cats
on campus starting Feb. 27. Trapped cats will be
transported to the Santa Clara Valley Humane Cen
ter for either adoption or termination of life.
In the meantime, those interested in the cats'
welfare will work to inform the community about
steps to protect their animals.
With the administration's cooperation, those con
cerned with cats can identify and register stray cats
before the deadline. Identifying a cat requires the
cats to be spayed or neutered, vaccinated, collared,
tagged.
An estimated 1,500 campus cats roam campus
and the majority of the population has not been
spayed or neutered, thus posing a problem of
reproducing at exponential rates, according to Pete
Sidebottom, assistant director of government rela-
tions in the Office of Public Af
fairs.
In addition, the cats pose a
health concern, according to
Sidebottom. Because they can
spread fleas and diseases, the
large number of untamed cats
"represent a risk to one another
and to the community," Sidebot
tom said. He added that the prob
lem has grown in the last four or
five years.
Carole Miller, professor of elec
trical engineering and advocate
for stray cats, estimated that of
the 1,500 cats, about 200-300 cats
are being fed and cared for, in
cluding about 15 cats near the
Electrical Engineering Depart
ment.
Primarily for the benefit of the
cared-for cats, the University
promises cooperation in properly
registering and identifying the
cats. The University will make
available locations on campus for
registering the cats for $5 each,
free traps for capturing the cats,
as well as a low-cost spaying and
neutering program to the Stan
ford community, according to
Sidebottom.
Traditionally, the adult cat pop
ulation has increased rapidly dur
ing the summer due to kittens
born in the spring, according to

Miller. By starting the removal of
cats now, Sidebottom said he
pects to "be able to reduce the
cat population significantly"
before then.
Sidebottom cited an increasing
number of calls from faculty, staff
and students to the Office of Man

agement and Budget, which
handles such cases, complaining
about fleas and requesting the
removal of dead cats.
However, among the commu
nity of cat lovers, Miller said that
"in the past there would be scares
. . . people would hear through the
grapevine that Crane was coming
in," resulting in "nasty calls to
[the Office of Management). . .
and quite a bit of hostility."
At Friday's meeting, however,
the participants reached "a basic

agreement that is humane and
fair" and "opened a line of com
munication and dialogue" be
tween two often polarized parties,
Miller said.
The hour-and-a-half meeting,
which was convened by Sidebot
tom at El Centro Chicano in Old
Union, involved about 20-30
people, according to Sidebottom,
including representatives from the
Office of Management and
Budget, Crane Pest Control and
the Santa Clara Animal Control
Division.

when the University implements its new policy designed to decrease the feline population.
