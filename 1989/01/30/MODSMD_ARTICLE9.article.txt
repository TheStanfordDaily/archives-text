# Racial slurs cause University to shut down bulletin board
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
"High-tech bigotry" in the form of
bigoted slurs on computer networks has
reached campus and has resulted in the
closing down of an electronic bulletin
board.
Last December, University computers re
ceived as part of the messages broadcasted
over USENET, an independent interna
tional computer network, a file called
"rec.humor.funny" which contained racist
and sexist jokes.
Though it is common for jokes to be sent
over USENET, Academic Information Re
sources Director Ralph Gorin said this par
ticular electronic bulletin board, or news
group, did not provide a means for any
readers to respond and show their dislike.
Gorin shut down the news group on AIR

and Data Center computers in earlv Jan
uary.
Disagreeing with Gorin's decision,
several Computer Science Department fac
ulty members met over the weekend to
discuss their objections. Prof. John McCar
thy likened AlR's actions to censorship,
saying that the department will continue
to broadcast "rec.humor.funny" over its
computers.
"The University administration has no
right to ban information access for any
segment of the University," he wrote on
"su-etc," one of the University's bulletin
boards in which local users exchange views.
'1 think the only reason that action was
even considered was the current furor over
racial issues â€” this seems to be a pretty
poor motivating device to me."
McCarthy added that the humor news
groups are often prefaced with warnings

about the potentially offensive nature of
the jokes.
But Gorin explained that the inability
for users to respond provided the impetus
for his decision. "The mere reason that
these jokes are offensive is not enough to
shut the system down," Gorin said. "This
particular news group does not provide a
mechanism in which it can be discussed."
"1 haven't the least fantasy that I'm
stopping bigotry by stopping purile jokes,"
Gorin said.
The jokes cannot be discussed because
the "rec.humor.funny" news group is
"moderated" by the jokes' author, Ontario
software company owner Brad Templeton.
A moderator decides what information ap
pears on a news group and can edit any
criticism.
Templeton refused to comment in a
phone interview last night.

Many other news groups which the Uni
versity subscribes to on USENET are un
moderated, whereby any user can transmit
information.
Computer Science Prof. Brian Reid also
disagreed with Gorin's decision. Though
he denounces all forms of bigotry, Reid
said the principle of free communication
in bulletin boards such as "rec.hu
mor.funny" is important.
"In a nation in which many of the
media organizations are controled by large
corporations, the existence of anarchical
news groups are refreshing and necessary
in a democracy," he said.
"What the Stanford community should
do is to request the administration to
clarify its policies in this area and all in a
way that is consistent with its values,"
wrote Lea Earnest of the NASA Ames Re
search Center over "su-etc."
