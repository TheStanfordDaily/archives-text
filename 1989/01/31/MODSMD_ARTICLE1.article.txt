# New undergraduate housing delayed at least till '95
## 
### Nathanael Cousins Staff writer 
The hope on the horizon for guaranteed
four-year undergraduate housing has
been obscured by fiscal reality.
Despite University forecasts in October
that new undergraduate housing would
replace the "temporary housing" of anti
quated Manzanita Park by 1992, Univer
sity officials yesterday confirmed that
funding for the new construction will be
delayed due to fiscal shortcomings in the
University's Centennial Campaign.
"We were looking at building on the
Manzanita site in the fall of 1992," said
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson. "Now that gets delayed to
1995, give or take a year," Robinson said.
Robinson said that contributions to the
undergraduate housing part of the Cen
tennial Campaign amounted to "not

many or none," adding, "It is very, very
difficult to raise donations for buildings,
and even more difficult for student res
idences."
Twelve million dollars of the $1.1 bil
lion Centennial Campaign drive is tar
geted toward undergraduate housing. Al
though overall fundraising is meeting tar
get goals, donations for undergraduate
housing have been few and far between.
Periodically the campaign committee
updates its progress and objectives, and
in a meeting last Monday the committee
reviewed progress of donations for
housing, according to David Fulton, com
munication director in the Office of De
velopment.
"Undergraduate housing is not any less
important to the University. This is just
a reflection of reality."
"Those who know concluded that it
was a very, very remote chance that the

$12 million goal for undergraduate
housing would be met," Robinson said.
Plans to tear down 21 percent of Man
zanita Park and replace it with new un
dergraduate housing were reported Oct.
18 by The Daily. The new construction
was the first phase of a plan to restruc
ture the entire Manzanita site and in
cluded eventual removal of the remaining
trailers and a possible change in location
for the Toyon Eating Clubs. Robinson
said the new housing will provide space
for 400 to 450 undergraduates.
Robinson stressed that guaranteed un
dergraduate housing was still a Univer
sity objective, but that reaching the goal
was a funding problem. He said the Man
zanita project would be financed in a
similar manner to the Rains Houses.
Public bonds from the California Educa
tional Facilities Authority will be issued
to pay for construction of the new build-

Although overall
fundraising is meeting
target goals, donations

housing have been few

Manzanita Park was given a lifetime
of five years when it was built as tem
porary housing 20 years ago. It currently
includes 116 trailers.
The Manzanita complex is the first
priority in the long-range University
housing goals. By delaying construction

at Manzanita, proposals for more grad
uate housing will also have to wait. "We'll
take them one at a time," Robinson said.
"I understand that there are many
needs for the money," said sophomore
Sholom Surges, a Manzanita resident. "I
don't want to be critical, but our trailers
are falling apart and they need attention."
But she countered, "The trailers get a
lot of criticism, but I like mine."
The Centennial Campaign's John
Wirth, vice provost for academic planning
and development, said he would address
the Faculty Senate Thursday regarding
changes in Centennial objectives. He
would not comment on the impact for
undergraduate housing.
Fulton yesterday said that funding for
the ambitious $1.1 billion Centennial was
"on target" at $676 million. He projected
that the funding goals would be reached
in 1991.
