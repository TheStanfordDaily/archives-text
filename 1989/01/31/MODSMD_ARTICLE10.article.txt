# Expert discusses genetic engineering

Creating a new breed of genet
ically engineered crops will
decrease our reliance on danger
ous pesticides, but might increase
our reliance on herbicides, an ex
pert said at the "You Can Make
a Difference" conference Satur
day.
Farmers growing crops geneti
cally altered to resist herbicides
may use more of these chemicals
to kill weeds.
"Engineered herbicide-tolerant
plants puncture the myth that
agricultural biotechnology is en
vironmentally benign," said Jane
Rissler, a biotechnology specialist
with the National Biotechnology
Policy Center.
Rissler and other panelists at

the conference's biotechnology
symposium said recent develop
ments in biotechnology might help
farmers cope with insects, poor
soil and drought, but warned that
biotechnology could have detri
mental effects.
According to Rissler, geneti
cally-engineered organisms could
displace natural populations, dis
rupt functions of the ecosystem
and decrease biological diversity.
In corn, for example, only the
varieties that conform to a num
ber of arbitrary criteria are the
ones to be grown, thus decreasing
diversity. To ease the diversity
problem, "we should require that
genetically-engineered plants
should be released simultaneously
in multiple varieties," Assoc. Bi
ology Prof. Virginia Walbot said.

Stephen Rogers, research fellow
of the Monsanto Co. which
develops biotechology, remarked
that scientists have been success
ful in creating genetically-altered
plants resistant to insects, viruses,
fungi and herbicides.
Rogers said despite the scien
tific complexities of the process,
the latest technology would still
be available to farmers in the
traditional packet, the seed.
Rogers predicted that genetic en
gineering would increase the
profitability of agriculture in the
near future.
UC-Berkeley Prof. Donald
Dahlsten called for an ecological
instead of a technological ap
proach to the problems of agricul
ture.
