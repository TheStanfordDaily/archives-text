## Steinberg guilty of manslaughter 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - A jury yes
terday convicted Joel Steinberg of
manslaughter in the beating
death of his illegally adopted 6-
year-old daughter, Lisa, a death
that refocused national attention
on domestic violence.
Steinberg showed no emotion
as each of the 12 jurors was polled
on the verdict, which came in at
6:38 p.m, in the eighth day of
deliberations in the three-month
old trial. He was acquitted on the
more serious charge of second
degree murder.
The verdict culminated a case

that touched the
nation's con
science, with wit
nesses providing
wrenching detail
of the physical
and emotional
havoc wrought by
spousal and child
abuse — and the
failure of others

to intercede.
Lisa's biological mother, Mic
hele Launders, 27, seemed to ex
hale a sigh of relief when the ver
dict was announced.
She was sitting next to
Graceann Smigiel, the grand
mother of a young boy who was
found in Steinberg's apartment
when police and Emergency Med
ical Service paramedics removed
Lisa's comatose body the morning
of Nov. 2, 1987.
The boy, who also was illegally
adopted by Steinberg, has since
been returned to his biological
mother.
The conviction on the charge of
first-degree manslaughter carries
a maximum sentence of 8 1-3 to
15 years. It was a charge that
prosecutors at one time had con
sidered dropping from the case.
Sentencing was set for March 8.
Ira London, Steinberg's lawyer,
said: "We do not consider this
(verdict) a win for Joel or a tri
umph for Joel."
One of the jurors, Helena Bar
fhell, 36, who argued in favor of
•onvicting Steinberg of murder,
laid the jury had vitfUftHy'ife- 1
nored" the testimony of Hedda
Nussbaum, Steinberg's battered

live-in companion of 12 years.
Nussbaum, testifying under im
munity from prosecution, said she
was so dominated by Steinberg
that she was unable to defend her
self from virtually systematic
beatings, or to protect the child,
Lisa Steinberg.
She also said she was unable
to bring herself to summon
medics promptly on Nov. 1, 1987,
after Steinberg told her Lisa was
unconscious on the bathroom
floor. The girl lay there nearly 12
hours by the time Nussbaum
called an ambulance; she died of
brain damage in a hospital three
days later.
Defense lawyers claimed it was
Nussbaum, Steinberg's live-in
girlfriend, who fatally beat Lisa
out of jealousy over the attention
Steinberg paid the child.
Prosecutors — pointing to Nus
sbaum's own severe injuries and
deteriorated mental state — said
she was incapable of such an act.
"She was a 45-year-old woman
who appeared much older than
her age," the emergency room doc
tor who examined Nussbaum
after her arrest testified at trial.
"She was chronically debilitated,
malnourished, wasted."
Nonetheless, state Supreme
Court Justice Harold Rothwax in
structed the jury that it must con
sider Nussbaum an accomplice in
Lisa's death. As such, her tes
timony had to be supported by
other evidence.
It was the layers of tragedy in
the Steinberg case that com
manded public attention. One
question was how Nussbaum, a
former children's book editor,
could allow herself — much less
the child — to sustain such
damage.
Another was how bruises on
Lisa could have been noticed by
a student teacher at her elemen
tary school and by neighbors, but
failed to come to the attention of
child welfare officials. Yet another
issue was the ease with which
Steinberg illegally gained custody
of " Lisa and another child, 16-
month old Mitchell, from their
unwed teen-age mothers.
