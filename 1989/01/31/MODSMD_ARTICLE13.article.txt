BALTIMORE (AP) - An
American businessman and a
Dutch national were charged with
illegally exporting poison gas com
ponents produced in Baltimore to
Jordan for suspected use in the
Iran-Iraq war, federal prosecutors
said yesterday.
Federal officials believe the
chemicals, manufactured by Al
colac International Inc. of Bal
timore, were illegally shipped to
both Iran and Iraq by separate
agents during 1987 and 1988.
Also Monday, prosecutors an
nounced that Alcolac agreed to
plead guilty to one count of
knowing violation of export laws
in connection with the export of
thiodiglycol. The lubricant, used
in the manufacture of inks and
textiles and sold under the brand
name Kromfax, produces lethal
mustard gas when combined with
hydrochloric acid.
The men charged in criminal
complaints released yesterday
were accused of shipping the com
ponent of mustard gas to Belgium
then to Jordan.
From there, federal prosecutors
believe the chemical was trans
ported to Iraq, said U.S. Attorney
Breckinridge Willcox.
Last year, a West German man
pleaded guilty to purchasing a

component of mustard gas from
AJcolac and shipping it via Greece
and Singapore to Iran.
Nicholas Defino, 64, of New Jer
sey, surrendered yesterday to U.S.
Customs Service agents, Willcox
said. Defino was released on bond
after appearing before a U.S.
magistrate.
Documents indicate DeFino
conducted business with Alcolac
International through a dummy
corporation, Nu Kraft Mercantile
Corp., of New York City, purchas
ing more than 400 tons of the
chemical in four shipments.
Defino and Dutch citizen Frans
Van Amraat, who was ap
prehended in Milan, Italy Jan. 26,
were charged with conspiracy, list
ing phony destinations on export
documents and violating U.S. ex
port laws. Van Amraat, the Eu
ropean agent for Nu Kraft, is
awaiting extradition.
Willcox said Defino is vice pres*
ident of United Steel and Strip
Corp., a legitimate New York com-,
pany located in Brooklyn.
Alcolac officials said the chemi
cals were sent to the Middle East
without their knowledge.
When asked about that state-,
ment, Willcox said "that was not
my understanding," but refused
to elaborate.
