# Ultra-rightists win in Berlin elections
## Party led by former SS soldier captures 11 seats in city's legislature 
### 
BERLIN (AP) — Conservative politicians
said yesterday they may have lost touch with
like-minded voters after surprising legislative
election victories by a tiny ultra-right party
led by a former Nazi SS soldier.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said his governing
Christian Democrats would have to "take care
of conservative voters" who defected.
The conservative Republican Party captured
11 of the West Berlin legislature's 138 seats
in Sunday's balloting. It also will have two
seats in the federal parliament in Bonn after
next year's national elections, giving the ultra
right its first representation in parliament
since 1953.
i Police stud *n«re-th«m 10,009 people dem
onstrated in downtown West Beriiu late yes
terday to protest the Republicans' showing.
There were isolated rock-throwing incidents

and vandalism, but no violence or arrests,
they said.
The Republicans, guided by former Nazi SS
soldier Franz Schoenhuber, campaigned on a
platform of ridding West Berlin of foreign
workers such as Turks and giving preferential
treatment to Germans seeking jobs.
Foreigners make up more than 10 percent
of the city's population of 2.1 million.
West Germany also has been the destination
of many asylum-seekers from the Third World,
and the Republicans called for sharp limits
on their numbers.
Sunday's balloting marked the first time
the Republican Party, formed in 1983, won
elective seats at the state level, Schoenhuber,
whose party headquarters are m Munich, did
not run.
The left-leaning Frankfurter Rundschau

newspaper called the victories "frightening."
West German Jewish leader Heinz Galinksi
said they were a "heavy defeat for democracy."
However, Greens Party leader Antje Vollmer
said the Republicans' "good showing is a chal
lenge, but it won't kill democracy."
Thousands of people chanted "Kick out the
Nazis! Foreigners stay!" in a march through
West Berlin late Sunday in protest of the party.
Kohl told reporters in Bonn the party's
showing was worrisome and indicated West
Germans are increasingly concerned about the
growing number of foreigners competing for
jobs, housing and social services.
"There is an urgent need to discuss these
problems and come up with better «eltttions,"
rCohl said. He also said "reaso'natSe^solutions"
had to be found for the large number of
asvlum-seekers.
