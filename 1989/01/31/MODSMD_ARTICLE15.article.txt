UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
The Security Council extended the
U.N. peacekeeping mandate in
Lebanon for six more months yes
terday. The secretary-general said
Israel was allowing "inexcusable"
violence against U.N. forces.
The 15-member council
renewed the U.N. Interim Force
in Lebanon despite the high cost
and Israel's refusal to leave the
border "security zone" it main
tains with the aid of the South
Lebanon Army, a surrogate
militia.
Council members accepted the
recommendations of Secretary-

General Javier Perez de Cuellar,
who recommended last week that
the operation continue.
Perez de Cuellar cited numer
ous violent acts against the force,
including the abduction by a pro-
Iranian group last February of
Lt. Col. William Higgins, a U.S.
military observer attached to it.
The secretary-general also said:
"No less inexcusable are the daily
firings close to UNIFIL positions
and vehicles.
"Most are the work of the SLA.
The Israeli authorities, who arm,
pay, train and direct the SlJ\,
have repeatedly been urged at all

levels to ensure that this danger
ous practice is brought to an end."
Israeli efforts to curb the SLA
six months ago lessened the dan
ger, he said, "but I regret that
the incidence of firings close to
UNIFIL positions has since risen
close to its former level."
UNIFIL was created in March
1978 to confirm the withdrawal
of an Israeli invasion force, res
tore security in south Lebanon
and help the Lebanese govern
ment regain authority there. The
force of 5,889 soldiers and other
personnel from nine nations costs
about $11.7 million a year.
