Suit filed against gene treatment
WASHINGTON (AP) — A Washington health
activist group filed suit yesterday asking that a
federal judge block plans for the use of a foreign
gene in the experimental treatment of a human
cancer.
The Foundation on Economic Trends and its
president, Jeremy Rifkin, asked the U.S. district
court for an injunction to block plans by re
searchers at the National Institute of Health to
use a rat virus to manipulate a gene in an ex
perimental treatment of melanoma, a virulent
and often fatal skin cancer.

The suit claims that the institute's Recom
binant DNA Advisory Committee, which reviews
human genetic engineering experiments, approved
the cancer therapy without conducting proper
public hearings.
