# Editorial
## Editor's farewell 
### 
FIRST and foremost the job
of editor in chief is a learning
experience. There is no
guidebook, no 10 easy steps to fol
low. Trusting your instincts is nec
essary to be a successful editor,
because at times, that's all there
is to go on.
I've learned a tremendous
amount about the opinions and at
titudes of the Stanford community
since coming to The Daily in the
fall of '84. Reflecting upon almost
five years of observations, there
are definitely some trends worth
mentioning.
At the beginning of this volume,
I called upon the community to
use the Opinions page as a place
to discuss and debate issues on
campus. I made this special request
because too many actions and
statements here go unanswered.
Another wish was for the entire
community to participate: the Law
School, the Business School, the
administration, everyone.
Yet, this volume continued to
witness a deluge of campus issues
and events which received little or
no response. For example, The
Daily has written story after story,
including an edit, on the delay of
the UCMI report. Many commu
nity members have been waiting
anxiously for the final draft, yet
there have been no letters demand
ing results and expressing frustra
tion.
Too often an editorial or letter
critical of a process or belief within
the community ran without a re
sponse. For example, The Daily
criticized the lack of judicial pro
cedure in the Otero incident and
offered an alternative method to
the current judicial process.
Nobody said a thing, which is frus
trating for those who offered up
the suggestion in the first place.
The lack of community response
can be attributed to indifference,
apathy or to an increasing hesita
tion of individuals to express an

opinion, in fear of being pegged as
something they are not, such as
bigoted.
Each reason addresses a definite
problem within the community:
The first two really question
whether Stanford is an intellectual
place after all. Perhaps Stanford
contains intellectuals who care
about making a difference, but the
overall attitude falls far short.
The other reason sends a strong
and serious signal that people are
afraid to speak out, thereby limit
ing any hope of progress towards
a community in which all feel a
part.
Constructive dialogue is imper
ative to reach that end. People
must be able to stand up for what
they believe and feel comfortable
expressing their opinion, even if it
is in the minority — even if it is
considered the wrong opinion to
have.
How would the end of segrega
tion ever have succeeded if those
who held the minority view were
too afraid to speak out?
The Daily offers a forum for con
structive dialogue, but it is not
used to its fullest. The Daily is the
only means through which each
component of our community can
immediately know what the rest
of the community is thinking and
articulating at the dinner table and
in dorm halls.
Debates and discussions can
never reach a productive conclu
sion if each side is not understood
completely by all involved.
I am very proud of the staff of
Volume 194. I hope their success
in returning a morning newspaper
to campus has made a difference.
