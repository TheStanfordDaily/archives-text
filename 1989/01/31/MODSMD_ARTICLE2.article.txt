# IFC puts frat on probation
## Board says Sigma Chi broke IFC rules, demands clear policy 
### DJ Berinstein Staff writer 
The Interfraternity Council
judiciary board ruled on its first
case as a judiciary body last night,
placing the Sigma Chi Fraternity
on one month's social probation.
The probation as a ruling means
that the Sigma Chis will be mon
itored by the IFC, but the frater
nity's social activities are not
suspended.
"We are quite happy with the
decision," said Sigma Chi presi
dent Marty Hartigan. "Suspension
was much too strict, especially
since we were unsure of the (party
flierl guidelines."
The guidelines Hartigan
referred to involve an important
distinction between University
and IFC guidelines regarding flier
regulation. IFC guidelines, writ
ten in 1986, stipulate that no al
cohol can be advertised on any
party fliers, whereas the Univer

sity policy makes no distinction
about the content of fliers but only
states that alcohol cannot be the
focus of a party.
In a formal letter to the
judiciary board, Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Joe Pisano specifically ob
jected to the depiction "of four
glasses of exotic and potent iced
teas made with alcohol along with
beer as opposed to only one glass
of plain Lipton (EANAB tea)."
The board unanimously voted
that the Sigma Chis "clearly vio
lated standing IFC policy by
depicting alcohol on its flier," but
after researching the events and
listening to the testimony of the
Sigma Chi president, its IFC rep
resentative and its social chair,
ruled that the party itself was not
alcohol-focused.
The sanctions placed the Sigma
Chis on a one-month probation
for flier violation, retroactively be
ginning on Jan. 20, and also states
that they must educate other fra

ternities about the IFC guidelines
regarding flier policy.
To fulfill this sanction, the fra
ternity member must present in
formation at house meetings to
all the housed and unhoused
fraternies at Stanford, and also
must "disseminate" the IFC Party
Planning Guidelines to the pres
ident and social chair of each
house.
After the judicial board reached
its decision, its members wrote
up the judgment, which was ap
proved by the executive commit
tee of the IFC.
All members of the IFC execu
tive committee said they had no
reason to believe Pisano would
not accept the board's decision.
Pisano comment.
Because of the confusion arising
between IFC and University
guidelines, the judiciary board
suggested in a statement to the

ternity Party Jan. 19, resulted in the IFC judiciary
board placing the fraternity on social probation.
IFC executive board that "the
University define, adopt and en
force for all residences and organ
izations a clear policy for the con
tent of rll advertisements and so
cial events."
The new judicial process in
volves all branches of the IFC.
The judicial board, composed of
five different fraternity members,
researched the problems with the
flier in accordance with Univer
sity party guidelines and also
brought in witnesses who had at
tended the party on Jan. 19.
"The entire process went
smoothly, and the decision was
made correctly and intelligently,"
said Nick Schaffzin, Phi Delta
Theta Fraternity member of the
judiciary board.
IFC president Chris Erlin also
said he thought the board's first
trial went well. "It was an intri
cate case," he said.
"We had to take both [the Uni
versity and IFC] policies into ac
count, and we were mindful of
the precedents we were setting,"
Erlin said.
IFC vice president Todd Ortega
said he was pleased with the sanc
tions "because they were not only
punitive but corrective as well.


This flier was used to advertise an Autumn quarter Sigma Chi
Fraternity party. Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano warned the
fraternity for the poster's emphasis on alcohol.
