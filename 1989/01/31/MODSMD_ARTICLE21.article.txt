"Burn, Bundy, burn"
— Chanted a crowd outside the prison
where Ted Bundy was executed
ON WEDNESDAY, Jan. 24, in
Starke, Florida, serial killer Ted
Bundy was finally "punished."
Two thousand volts of electricity surged
through his body for 60 seconds. A puff
of smoke lifted from his right leg. At
7:16 a.m., Bundy was pronounced dead.
According to The New York Times, a
predawn crowd of 200 or so people
"cheered lustily" when they heard the
news. The question I would like to ask
is, "What purpose, if any, does the spec
tacle of capital punishment serve?"
Proponents of the death penalty argue
that the purpose of a state-sanctioned
execution is twofold: protection of the
community and retribution. Both these
arguments are questionable.
The first argument for capital punish
ment — protection of the community —
often manifests itself in the form of deter
rence. Advocates of deterrence believe
that the existence of the death penalty
will instill such fear in people's hearts
that the thought of it keeps them from
committing murder.
Unfortunately, this theory has never
been proven. No empirical data exists to
support this notion. In fact, a study in
Florida has shown that while the
homicide rate elsewhere in the United
States declined during 1984, the rate in
Florida actually rose by 5.1 percent, even
though it executed the most people of
any state. Still, the notion of deterrence
seems logical in spite of the lack of
evidence. After all, it follows logically that

the more severe the punishment the more
it should deter.
According to leading capital punish
ment opponent Hugo Adam Bedau, how
ever, this reasoning fails to take into
account two important distinctions. First,
persons who commit heinous crimes
either premeditate them or they do not.
If they do not, then the requisite mens
rea (criminal intent) of a capital crime is
missing; and it is impossible to imagine
how in such cases any punishment could
deter. In cases where the crime is
premeditated, the criminal ordinarily ex
pects to escape detection, arrest and con
viction. It is impossible to see how the
death penalty can deter an individual who
does not expect to get caught.
Second, any punishment can be an ef
fective deterrent only if it is consistently
applied. Unfortunately, the death penalty
is applied inconsistently — randomly at
best, in a discriminatory manner at
worst. According to Columbia University
Law Prof. Charles Black, all 75 involun
tary executions between 1977 and 1987
were carried out by just nine Southern
states. Of the 75 executions, 24 of them
were for black people who had killed
white people while none of them were
for white people who had killed black
people.
Some people argue, however, that the
inconsistent application of the death
penalty is a reason to expand it. Unfortu
nately, this solution fails to take into
account the increase in probability that
an innocent victim will be executed. Even
with all the safeguards of the justice sys
tem, there have been 400 admitted cases
of erroneous murder convictions.

In the words of David Bruck, who re
ported these findings, although "very
few" of these cases involved actual ex
ecutions, the mistakes that were docu
mented "were uncovered precisely
because the prisoner was alive and able
to fight for his vindication."
, Given the problems with capital pun
ishment, both in theory and in applica
tion, people still argue that justice can
be best carried out through executions.
They believe in an "eye for an eye" and
a "tooth for a tooth." But when justice
involves the taking of another human
being's life, then justice itself has been
distorted.
After all, retributive justice with re
spect to capital punishment doesn't ac
complish anything practical — it
obviously doesn't bring the victims back
to life. Thus the main purpose of retribu
tive justice seems to be its ability to give
people a feeling of pleasure that some
thing right was done. This leads to the
perverse conclusion that perhaps Ted
,Bundy was killed for pleasure. Witness
the carnival atmosphere, the macabre
songs and the "Toast Ted" T-shirts.
What difference, then, is there between
those who executed Ted Bundy for plea
sure and Ted Bundy himself?
