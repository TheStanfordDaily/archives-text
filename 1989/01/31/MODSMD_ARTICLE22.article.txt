## Outburst at women's poetry reading was appalling 
### 
SUNDAY NIGHT in the Coffee
House a man playing chess stood
up in the midst of a scheduled
women's poetry reading and asked in a
loud voice for the reading to stop.
■ He said he had come to play a little
ihess and didn't know why he had to
[be forced to listen to these women
Reading their "sick" poetry. He left
£fter the police were called, but the
effects of his outburst remained.
• Many in the audience, including
-inyself, were angered and offended by

what he did. His actions were shocking
because they brought to life so particu
larly and vividly the generic idea of a
sexist white male who is silencing a
woman and her poetry; who is out
raged that his chess game is not given
the foremost consideration; who is
disgusted at the vivid description of a
woman's body (the poems were "sick"
and "pornographic," he later told
police); who sees himself as the central
audience ("those poems were meant to
upset me," he also told police) in total

disregard for the community of women
who were sponsoring, participating in
and listening to the reading, who is
angry at the feminist movement in
general, as evinced by his appropriation
of its language, saying he was "raped"
by their poetry; and who believes that
his voice has the ultimate authority to
interrupt, judge and command.
His behavior was appalling — an
affront to the woman reading the
poem, the Women's Center and to a
larger community at Stanford and

beyond, including some white males
who are working against sexism.
His outburst shows us all how alive
and thriving gender oppression is in
1989 and, on a very practical level,
makes a strong argument for the
holding of more women's poetry read
ings at the Coffee House. I hope that
if the Women's Center chooses to hold
those readings, he will choose to attend
them with a more open mind.
