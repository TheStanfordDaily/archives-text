Sporting a $100 blazer, a $25 shirt,
n $20 tie, $35 slacks and a new pair of
$55 Nike Crosstrainer shoes, I attended
Club Ujamaa at Lagunita Saturday
night. Unfortunately my evening was
cut short when three students wearing
two way radio headsets stopped me
and informed me that I was inap
propriately attired for the semi-formal
occasion. Apparently my shoes
distressed them. I was promptly shown
to the back door.
I later returned to the party and
was standing by the dance floor when
the same security guard came up to
me, reminded me of my inadequate
footwear and showed me to the door
the front door this time.
For 10 minutes I stood outside and
watched people coming and going,
some without ties, some wearing
sweaters and one person wearing no
shoes at all. None were escorted by the
Keystone Cops.
If the dorms around campus are
asked to donate money to support this

party, they have the right to expect
that their students will not be harassed
and kicked out for such petty reasons
as inappropriate footwear. I wore those
shoes because they were comfortable to
dance in and good for my cross-campus
walk home, not to destroy the am
bience of the party or to provoke trou
ble.
Had a flier been circulated detailing
what the vague term "semi-formal
attire" entails and warning that failure
to live up to their ideals would lead to
expulsion, I would have been in the
wrong. Before they panhandle around
campus for funds for the the next
Club Ujamaa, perhaps they should
explain the motives for their actions.
