# Ujamaa incident a result of failure on part of house staff
## 
### 
The culprit of the incident at
Ujamaa House last fall is not any of
the young people whose conduct was
examined in such exquisite detail in
the fact-finding report. It is, rather,
the functioning of those responsible for
the house.
Theme houses that, like Ujamaa,
bring together young people of differ
ent backgrounds are entirely desirable.
This is one way college can help people
of different backgrounds understand
and accept each other as members of a
single society. But any setting in which
people believe that some of those with
whom they live are like themselves
while others belong to another group
will, if left alone, polarize. Even with
the best will in the world, people in
such a setting will begin to think in
terms of "us" and "them."
The house's administration appears
to have failed to establish a single
inclusive community from which "us
and them" would have been largely
absent. All the structures supportive of

community formation that anyone
could have wanted had been provided
to the house: resident fellow, resident
assistants, programs for greeting in
coming freshmen, regular meetings.
And yet these structures failed to work
well enough to dissipate residents'
sense of "us and them," with its ac
companying feelings of exclusion and
misunderstanding. The reasons the
structures failed should be the focus of
inquiry. The incident itself was only an
expression of their failure.
