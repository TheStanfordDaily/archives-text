# Latin American experts:
## Social issues connected to environment 
### Max Scoular 
Environmental problems in Latin
America are closely linked to social prob
lems in those countries, and any efforts
to remedy the problems must necessarily
embrace more than a scientific solution,
according to panelists at a forum yester
day on Latin American environmental
policy.
Rodrigo Gamez, a presidential adviser
for natural resources in Costa Rica,
stressed that environmental problems do
not occur in a vacuum; rather, malfunc
tions in the ecosystem are inseparable
from political, economic, social and cul
tural constructs. Gamez was particating
in a "You Can Make a Difference" con
ference forum.
According to Gamez, environmental is
sues encompass many fields, and a plan
for response must attempt to address all
of these areas. Finding such a solution
is a difficult task which "we [Latin
Americans] can't do . . . alone," said
Gamez. He called on universities and
other countries to promote programs to
help address environmental problems.
Gamez also focused on Costa Rica's
self-imposed obligation to preserve bio
logical diversity. Deforestation to increase
arable land for modern farming tech
niques endangers many species and ruins
