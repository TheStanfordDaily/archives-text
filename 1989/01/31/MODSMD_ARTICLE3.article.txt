# Latin American experts:
## Social issues connected to environment 
### Max Scoular 
Environmental problems in Latin
America are closely linked to social prob
lems in those countries, and any efforts
to remedy the problems must necessarily
embrace more than a scientific solution,
according to panelists at a forum yester
day on Latin American environmental
policy.
Rodrigo Gamez, a presidential adviser
for natural resources in Costa Rica,
stressed that environmental problems do
not occur in a vacuum; rather, malfunc
tions in the ecosystem are inseparable
from political, economic, social and cul
tural constructs. Gamez was particating
in a "You Can Make a Difference" con
ference forum.
According to Gamez, environmental is
sues encompass many fields, and a plan
for response must attempt to address all
of these areas. Finding such a solution
is a difficult task which "we [Latin
Americans] can't do . . . alone," said
Gamez. He called on universities and
other countries to promote programs to
help address environmental problems.
Gamez also focused on Costa Rica's
self-imposed obligation to preserve bio
logical diversity. Deforestation to increase
arable land for modern farming tech
niques endangers many species and ruins
natural habitats.
Preserving cultural diversity is
an equally important objective,
said Gamez. For example, new
agricultural systems, in addition
to threatening species extinction,
also alter traditional values and
lifestyles. Gamez added that plans
for regional renewal should take

into account and integrate diverse
peoples and cultures.
Carlos Aliaga Uria, a principal
coordinator for the Office for the
Biosphere and Environment in
Bolivia, initiated the forum with
an assessment of the present sit
uation in Bolivia, in which he
linked social and economic prob
lems to environmental issues.
"The poverty of the land is cre
ating the poverty of the people,"
said Uria.
Uria identified land deteriora

tion as a cause of poverty, which
has resulted in rural migration to
overpopulated cities and the
growth of the cocaine industry.
Concerning solutions for
ecological problems, Uria indi
cated that Bolivia has encountered
difficulties because of violent do
mestic situations. On the other
hand, Uria implied that a more
peaceful Costa Rica has been able
to better address its environmen
tal concerns.
