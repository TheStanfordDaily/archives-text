## The
						doctor is in ... Students share the health 
### Leina Johansson 
When registered nurse Lou
Shaw originally came to the
Cowell Student Health Center
in 1986, she noticed that stu
dents here weren't giving the
center much input. "It did not
make sense that we had a stu
dent health center without stu
dent involvement," she said.
Shortly after her arrival,
Shaw teamed up with 1988
graduate Mary Thurber to form
a group that would beter link
students to Cowell. Recruitment
began and soon interested stu
dents started up the Student
Health Advisory, Review and
Evaluation Committee, known
as SHARE.

Now in its third year, the
group is striving to knock down
barriers between students and
the health care professionals at
Stanford. SHARE'S main goal
is to assist Cowell in providing
the best possible health care
service to the student popula
tion.
According to this year's co
chair, Lauren Friedly, SHARE
is working to dispel the many
misconceptions students have
about Cowell.
All SHARE members are re
quired to design a project aimed
at bettering student health.
They have been working on get
ting out a menu outlining
Cowell's services as well as a
dorm outreach project which

distributes information on such
topics as over-exercising and
cholesterol levels. SHARE mem
bers are also planning on getting
first-aid kits into dorms and or
ganizing a health fair for next
year's Orientation Week.
An on-going stress reduction
project entitled "Keeping the
Challenge, While Managing the
Stress," is another SHARE proj
ect now underway.
Another way SHARE is fos
tering student involvement at
Cowell is through an informa
tion booth. Every Tuesday and
Thursday from 11 a.m. to 1
p.m., SHARE members set up
shop in White Plaza to provide
information about Cowell and
its services.
At the booth, students can
drop off comments, suggestions
or complaints which SHARE
members then take back to
Cowell.
Shaw said that SHARE has
received a lot of support from
Dean of Sudent Affairs James
Lyons. With his help, SHARE
received funding which enabled
the group to accomplish many
of its original projects.
Students are selected to join
SHARE through an application
process each spring. SHARE
members do not have to be
human biology majors, and
come from a "real cross-section"
of students, Shaw said, adding
that they all share a concern
for student health.
SHARE has become active off
campus as well. Last spring,
Stanford was represented for
the first time at the annual
American College Health Asso
ciation conference in Denver,
Colo.
This year SHARE is actively
raising money to send more stu
dents to a spring conference in
Washington D.C.. SHARE mem
bers hope to attend a regional
conference in Newport Beach,
as well.
