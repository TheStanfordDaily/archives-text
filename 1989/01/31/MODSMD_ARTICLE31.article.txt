## Men spikers stumble while chasing 'Bows 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
Quick and painless. That is probably the
most accurate description of the Stanford
men's volleyball team's loss at the hands
of the University of Hawaii's Rainbow-
Warriors last night. In a match that lasted
less than an hour-and-a-half, Hawaii picked
apart the youthful Cardinal in three games:
15-4, 15-12, and 15-3. Stanford will attempt
to regroup before teeing it up again tonight
for match two of the two-match series
against their WIVA foe. The match will
get underway at 7:30 at Maples Pavilion.

Men's Volleyball
Rainbows 3, Cardinal 0

Yesterday morning's headlines warned
of the imminent arrival of the Rainbows'
feared outside hitter, Allen Allen. The
pregame hype focused on the battle be
tween these two WIVA powers and the
well-balanced matchups of Stanford's Scott
Fortune and Dan Hanan against Hawaii's
Allen Allen and Carlos Briceno, all of whom
have a position on this year's All-America
team locked up.
However, on a night when his two team
mates were supposed to lead his team to
victory, Hawaii's Brian Poppinga stole the
show. Poppinga's performance can be
summed up in one phrase: 20 swings, 19
kills. "Usually, Carlos and Allen get most
of the sets," Poppinga said. "I'm normally
the third hitter. Tonight, I got a few down,
and they just kept coming to me."
Poppinga, despite the ease with which
his team handled the Cardinal, had nothing
but good things to say about his opponents.
"Of all our matches, including Pepper
dine and Santa Barbara, I was most scared
about these two (last night's match and
tonight's second confrontation). We were

really worried about them; (Dan) Hanan
and (Craig) Forsyth were two guys that
we knew would be tough to stop. When
neither of them played, that made things
much easier on us. When they get them
back, they'll be a different team."
Poppinga also commented on his team's
respect for Scott Fortune: "He is really
tough. We heard before the game that he
had the flu, so we didn't really know what
to expect from him. We had a feeling that
he'd be out there, but, he didn't really
have one of his better nights. He's playing
with a very young team, and he's trying
to adjust his play to their inexperience."
One of the few bright spots for the Car
dinal was David Johnson, Stanford's senior
outside hitter, who came in for Doug
Walquist in the second game. When he
entered the game, Stanford was down 8-10,
but, riding the boost Johnson provided,
the Cardinal ran off three straight points
to take an 11-10 lead.
"Our team is loaded with outside hit
ters," Johnson said, "so I come in to give
Doug (Walquist) a breather, to get in some
tough serves, and to play solid back row
defense. I try to get guys fired up from
back there with a lot of chatter."
For a brief stretch, it appeared as if
Johnson may have provided the magical
spark that would break the ice against
Hawaii. However, the Cardinal's burst
sputtered and stalled, and Hawaii scored
five of the next six points to win game two.
When asked what he thought was the
most effective element of Hawaii's arsenal,
Johnson offered a surprising answer.
"Their defense is incredible. They just get
to everything," Johnson said. "When they
dig every shot, they frustrate opposing hit
ters, who then tend to try to hit it straight
down. Then their blockers are able to take
over and dominate."
The Cardinal will try to salvage some
optimistic thoughts about last night's
match tonight at 7:30 p.m.

Stanford hitter Scott Fortune goes for a dig. Fortune and the Cardinal couldn't
handle the Hawaii Rainbows last night, losing in three games straight.
