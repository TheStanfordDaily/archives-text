What do you get when you toss
21 Olympians in the same pool?:
More than just a few fast
swims.

Men's Swimming
Cardinal 6th at Dallas Classic

That was the scenario this past
weekend at the Dallas Morning
News Classic, where eight mem*
bers of the Cardinal swim team
squared off against fellow Seoul
competitors and All-Americans
from five of the other top pro
grams in the nation.
When the Southern Methodist
pool cleared, defending national
champion Texas was crowned vic
tor, but in the test of speed no
team could be called a loser. While
Stanford finished sixth, following
Texas, Michigan, Southern Cali
fornia, California, and SMU in the
two-day meet, Cardinal competi
tors won two events and logged
ever-quickening times in a num-j
ber of other contests.
"It was good competition, some
of the best swimmers in the coun
try were in Dallas," co-captain Jay
Mortenson said. "There were a
couple real good swims and overall
I was pleased with the effort."
Mortenson himself fell under
the former category. In winning
the 100-yard (although the but
terfly/backstroke specialist has al
ready qualified), Mortenson re
corded his fastest ever unshaved
time in the event. The second vic
tor for the Cardinal was freshman
sensation Jeff Rouse, who once
again touched the wall first in the
100 back, and also took third in
the 200-yard race.
Although the squad finished
last for the second year in a row,
the competitors emphasized that
this year the meet was a whole
different ballgame. "Last year we
were sixth but we were a
miserable sixth. This year it was

close. We were fourth after the
first day but we just didn't race
very well on the second day," Mor
tenson said.
The Cardinal squad attributed
its placing to the format of the
meet, in addition to the caliber of
the competition. Each team was
allowed to enter only two swim
mers in each event, one into a
final and one into a consolation
final. Distance freestyle, one of
the team's strongest points, was
not an event at Dallas. Stanford
relief on its depth in a number
of events to carry it past its
deficiencies in its weaker races in
dual meets, but "the depth" was
not allowed to compete.
