# Finicky Farm fans quick to quibble about squads' shortcomings

Xenophobically speaking, I'd actually
rather talk to outsiders than Stan
ford fans after a loss by any of one
the Cardinal sports teams.
The reason for this is that unlike those
who carry a detatched view toward Stan
ford sports, Stanford fans tend to sub
scribe to a view which I think is most
appropriately labeled the "We Suck" the
ory.
I phrase this in such less-than-eloquent
fashion because that is how it is usually
phrased to me.
Basically, what happens is this: (and if
you're going to write a letter saying that
you're a typical Stanford fan and you
know typical Stanford fans and this isn't
true .. . please address it to Sports Mail
bag. Meanwhile, this is what I've encoun
tered).
First, a Stanford team with a high
ranking (as Stanford teams usually have)
loses to an opponent. Any opponent, ex
cept perhaps one that has been featured

by Sports Illustrated or At The Half.
Then, the typical Stanford fan hears
this, and predictably responds, "We lost?
Aw, we suck."
This perhaps isn't the most timely time
to mention this, because Stanford's last
men's basketball game was a loss to Ar
izona, currently the team with the highest
profile west of the Rockies.
But it was particularly true after Stan
ford's loss to California Jan. 19. Despite

the fact that Harmon Gym is considered
even by most Stanford and Arizona
players as tough a place as there is to
play in the Pacific 10 Conference, and
despite the fact that Stanford was the
third top-20 victim of then 13-5 Cal, I
can think of several different occasions
when people came up to me and specif
cally sighed the words, "We suck."
This about a team that had won eight
straight games and will make its first
appearance in the NCAA playoffs in 47
years.
The same thing is probably going to
be true regarding Stanford baseball when
people pick up this paper and see that
the two-time defending national cham
pion Cardinal has started the season 0-3
for the first time, literally, in recorded
Stanford baseball history.
"We lost to San Jose State? We suck
royally."
Obviously an 0-3 start is nothing to

run through the halls of Meyer Library
and shout about â€” as a matter of fact,
I can't think of any reason worth going
to Meyer Library But it's important to
keep things in perspective.
This is by no means limited to Stan
ford. During the Los Angeles Lakers' long
losing streak on the road recently, almost
any Laker fan who wasn't asking,
"What's wrong with the Lakers?" was
simply saying, "We lost to Sacramento?
We suck, and I mean big time."
Meanwhile, even as they dipped to 9-12
on the road, Los Angeles still had the
fifth-best road record in the NBA, a
league in which home teams win 69 per
cent of games played, and held onto the
best record in the Western Conference.
Hardly a collapse into suckdom.
The problem is that the expectations
of the Stanford sport scene are raised so
high, that any setback becomes somewhat
devastating. Maybe this is patently obvi

ous. But if I didn't hear that "we suck"
so much, I wouldn't write about it.
It's as hard for me as anyone to look
at Stanford sports detatchedly, but it
needs to be done in order to appreciate
the teams we have.
It's hard to get excited about the
various Cardinals (that is, the many dif
ferent Cardinal teams) without acquiring
unreasonable expectations, but it's worth
a shot.
After all, it's reasonable to expect that
if men's basketball makes an early exit;
from the NCAAs, many, including myself
and most certainly the members of the
team, might be greatly disappointed.
Without meaning to be trite, if that
does happen, it's worth remembering how
far Stanford basketball has come, rather
than how short it may come.
