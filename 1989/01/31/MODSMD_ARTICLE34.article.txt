# Card nine drops third in a row

### Bruce Sarkisian Editorial staff 
Upon returning to the dugout
after scoring the Spartan's third
run of the game, San Jose State
left fielder Eric Booker exclaimed
"We've got more where that came
from!"
They certainly did.

Baseball
Spartans 14, Cardinal 8

The Spartans went on to score
11 more runs en route to a 14-8
shellacking of the Stanford base
ball team at Sunken Diamond yes
terday. While the Cardinal had
trouble scoring runs in its first
two losses to Santa Clara, this
time the bats woke up but the
pitching arms went numb.
"I think this is the best offen
sive club we've had in a long
time," commented Spartans' Asst.
Coach Scott Hertler, who tempo
rarily took the reins yesterday
from Sam Piraro, who is suffering
from pneumonia.
Hertler's club, which had scored
39 runs in the three games prior
to its meeting with the Cardinal,
belted out 17 nits off five Stanford
pitchers in the win.
The Cardinal came in to the
game after two tough, one-run
losses over the weekend, and was
looking to score its first win
against San Jose State, a tradi
tionally weaker school. "They
(Stanford) were looking to get well
against us, but we got some gutsy
pitching performances and good
offense," Hertler surmised.
Stanford Asst. Coach Tom Dun
ton said that the Cardinal may
have been a little overeager
against the Spartans. "I think
they were pressing a little bit,

probably. When you lose a tougb
game you want to get right back
and win. [These losses I should
give us a chance to see what we're
made of," he commented.
The Spartans fell behind early

when their starter Don Dryden
gave up walks to the first Stan
ford batters, Frank Carey and Da
vid Holbrook. Stanford Coach


April Pearson - Dally
Stanford second baseman Frank Carey heads for home. Carey went
2-for-4 with a double and a triple and scored three times yesterday.
Mark Marquess then employed
some coaching finesse, sending
both runners on a 3-1 count to
Troy Paulsen, who grounded to
the shortstop while Carey and
Holbrook advanced.
Paul Carey hit a sacrifice fly to
left field to score Carey, and Tim
Griffin got Holbrook across the
plate with a single to left.
The Cardinal was on the march
again in the third inning when
Frank Carey blasted a triple over
the right fielder's head, followed
by Holbrook's RBI double.
Holbrook in turn scored after
Paulsen and Paul Carey each hit
singles, and Carey became the last
man to cross the plate when fresh
man Steve Solomon hit a sacrifice
fly to center.
Going into the top of the fifth,
it looked like the Cardinal was on
its way to the first victory of the
season with a 6-1 lead. But Stan
ford starter Brian Keyser could
not hold the Spartans down. After
hitting shortstop Steve Anderson,
he threw a wild pitch that ad
vanced Anderson to third. Ander
son then scored on a throwing
error by left fielder Mike Eicher,
and Keyser was done for the day.
Highly-touted freshman Aaron
Dorlarque then came in to mop
up, but could not retire the side
until he gave up five hits, includ
ing a double to Ozzie Fernandez,
and three runs.
Perhaps Stanford's biggest
problem at this point is that it is
the defending national champion,
which puts outside pressure on

the Cardinal, and drives its oppo
nents even harder. "I think every
one in the nation looks forward
to playing the national champion,
and it drives our kids even
harder," Hertler concluded.
Card Note
Marquess' lineup today put an em
phasis on power. Eicher, who hit .305
last season got the starting nod over
Eric DeGraw who hit .271. Holbrook,
who had one of the only hot bats for
the Cardinal last weekend, batted sec
ond. And first baseman Brian
Johnson, who is now 0-for-ll on the
season, was moved down to eighth in
the order.

Upon returning to the dugout
after scoring the Spartan's third
run of the game, San Jose State
left fielder Eric Booker exclaimed
"We've got more where that came
from!"
They certainly did.

Baseball
Spartans 14, Cardinal 8

The Spartans went on to score
11 more runs en route to a 14-8
shellacking of the Stanford base
ball team at Sunken Diamond yes
terday. While the Cardinal had
trouble scoring runs in its first
two losses to Santa Clara, this
time the bats woke up but the
pitching arms went numb.
"I think this is the best offen
sive club we've had in a long
time," commented Spartans' Asst.
Coach Scott Hertler, who tempo
rarily took the reins yesterday
from Sam Piraro, who is suffering
from pneumonia.
Hertler's club, which had scored
39 runs in the three games prior
to its meeting with the Cardinal,
belted out 17 nits off five Stanford
pitchers in the win.
The Cardinal came in to the
game after two tough, one-run
losses over the weekend, and was
looking to score its first win
against San Jose State, a tradi
tionally weaker school. "They
(Stanford) were looking to get well
against us, but we got some gutsy
pitching performances and good
offense," Hertler surmised.
Stanford Asst. Coach Tom Dun
ton said that the Cardinal may
have been a little overeager
against the Spartans. "I think
they were pressing a little bit,

probably. When you lose a tougb
game you want to get right back
and win. [These losses I should
give us a chance to see what we're
made of," he commented.
The Spartans fell behind early

when their starter Don Dryden
gave up walks to the first Stan
ford batters, Frank Carey and Da
vid Holbrook. Stanford Coach


April Pearson - Dally
Stanford second baseman Frank Carey heads for home. Carey went
2-for-4 with a double and a triple and scored three times yesterday.
Mark Marquess then employed
some coaching finesse, sending
both runners on a 3-1 count to
Troy Paulsen, who grounded to
the shortstop while Carey and
Holbrook advanced.
Paul Carey hit a sacrifice fly to
left field to score Carey, and Tim
Griffin got Holbrook across the
plate with a single to left.
The Cardinal was on the march
again in the third inning when
Frank Carey blasted a triple over
the right fielder's head, followed
by Holbrook's RBI double.
Holbrook in turn scored after
Paulsen and Paul Carey each hit
singles, and Carey became the last
man to cross the plate when fresh
man Steve Solomon hit a sacrifice
fly to center.
Going into the top of the fifth,
it looked like the Cardinal was on
its way to the first victory of the
season with a 6-1 lead. But Stan
ford starter Brian Keyser could
not hold the Spartans down. After
hitting shortstop Steve Anderson,
he threw a wild pitch that ad
vanced Anderson to third. Ander
son then scored on a throwing
error by left fielder Mike Eicher,
and Keyser was done for the day.
Highly-touted freshman Aaron
Dorlarque then came in to mop
up, but could not retire the side
until he gave up five hits, includ
ing a double to Ozzie Fernandez,
and three runs.
Perhaps Stanford's biggest
problem at this point is that it is
the defending national champion,
which puts outside pressure on

the Cardinal, and drives its oppo
nents even harder. "I think every
one in the nation looks forward
to playing the national champion,
and it drives our kids even
harder," Hertler concluded.
Card Note
Marquess' lineup today put an em
phasis on power. Eicher, who hit .305
last season got the starting nod over
Eric DeGraw who hit .271. Holbrook,
who had one of the only hot bats for
the Cardinal last weekend, batted sec
ond. And first baseman Brian
Johnson, who is now 0-for-ll on the
season, was moved down to eighth in
the order.
