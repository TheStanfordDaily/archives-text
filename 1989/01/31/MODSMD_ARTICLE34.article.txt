Upon returning to the dugout
after scoring the Spartan's third
run of the game, San Jose State
left fielder Eric Booker exclaimed
"We've got more where that came
from!"
They certainly did.

Spartans 14, Cardinal 8

The Spartans went on to score
11 more runs en route to a 14-8
shellacking of the Stanford base
ball team at Sunken Diamond yes
terday. While the Cardinal had
trouble scoring runs in its first
two losses to Santa Clara, this
time the bats woke up but the
pitching arms went numb.
"I think this is the best offen
sive club we've had in a long
time," commented Spartans' Asst.
Coach Scott Hertler, who tempo
rarily took the reins yesterday
from Sam Piraro, who is suffering
from pneumonia.
Hertler's club, which had scored
39 runs in the three games prior
to its meeting with the Cardinal,
belted out 17 nits off five Stanford
pitchers in the win.
The Cardinal came in to the
game after two tough, one-run
losses over the weekend, and was
looking to score its first win
against San Jose State, a tradi
tionally weaker school. "They
(Stanford) were looking to get well
against us, but we got some gutsy
pitching performances and good
offense," Hertler surmised.
Stanford Asst. Coach Tom Dun
ton said that the Cardinal may
have been a little overeager
against the Spartans. "I think
they were pressing a little bit,

probably. When you lose a tougb
game you want to get right back
and win. [These losses I should
give us a chance to see what we're
made of," he commented.

Stanford second baseman Frank Carey heads for home. Carey went
2-for-4 with a double and a triple and scored three times yesterday.
