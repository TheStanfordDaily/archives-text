# Gymnasts fall in weekend meets
## Men's team loses dual meet with UCLA, Santa Barbara 
### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
One of the McDonald's commercials run last
summer to promote its Olympics game-card con
test showed a middle-aged man performing a
routine on the uneven parallel bars. That man
was UCLA men's gymnastics coach Art Shurlock.
If their performance Sunday afternoon at UC-
Santa Barbara was any indication, some Stanford
gymnasts might learn a trick or two from Shur
lock's brief performance in that advertisement.

Cardinal 3rd at UC-Santa Barbara

That assertion is a little harsh, but the Cardinal
men did not come close to their potential on
Sunday, losing to both UCLA and the host
Gauchos. Stanford's 261.7 score is 20 points lower
than the scores they expect to be achieving by
the season's end in April.
"We did very poorly," Cardinal Coach Sadao
Hamada said. "There were not too many high
lights; we just did not get through our routines."

Fortunately, at this point in the season, Stan
ford's disappointing performance will have no
effect on its status in terms of ranking or league
standings. The meet's results may prove positive
in giving the Cardinal gymnasts some incentive
to work especially hard as they prepare for the
more important meets on their schedule.
"At this time, the win-loss record means noth
ing," Hamada said. "We didn't have any intensity
because the guys knew we were not really going
for a team score.
"1 think it's a good kick in the butt," he
continued. "We still have three or four weeks to
go until we are at full power. Then, there should
be no excuses."
Hamada also said he was very pleased with
sophomore Tim Wang's work on the floor and
the rings. Junior Conrad Voorsanger was Stan
ford's top all-around gymnast, totalling 54.5
points over the six events.
Meanwhile, the perennially powerful Bruins
showed impressive depth and consistency. After
finishing third at last year's NCAA champion
ships, UCLA is back with ten gymnasts competing
for positions on the team's rotation.
According to Hamada, Santa Barbara's per
formance was a surprise.
