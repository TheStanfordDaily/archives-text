# Women fall short of victory due to flawed beam routines

The competition hung in the balance â€” or
rather, the balance beam.

Women's Gymnastics
Huskies 183.85, Cardinal 183.1

Taking the first three events at Saturday's
meet against Washington, the Stanford women's
gymnastics team led into the final event, balance
beam.
However, four of six Stanford gymnasts fell
from the beam, and when the chalk cleared, the

Cardinal was handed its third defeat of the
season.
Balance beam notwithstanding, the team had
an excellent outing. In addition to team victories
in the vault, the uneven bars and floor exercises,
Stanford swept the all-around awards as well
with Sheri Evenson, Dina Amoroso and Jennifer
Bloom taking first, second and third. Coach
Homer Sardina, though understandably disap
pointed. was pleased with the performances.
"We didn't put the meet away, we didn't stay
focused . . . but overall it went really well" he
said. "We functioned like a team. I was extremely
pleased with the way we started."
It was on the uneven bars and the floor exer
cises that the team excelled. Amoroso, a junior,
placed first on bars with a 9.35.
