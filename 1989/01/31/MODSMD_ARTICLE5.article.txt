# Bulimia:
## Falling from imagined grace 
### Kate Summerscale 
Editor's note: This is the second of two articles on
bulimia. The names of women with eating disorders
have been changed.

"I was the perfect child and I hated myself," says
Anne.
Cathy first hinged upon receiving her best grades
ever.
The binge-purge cycle of bulimia graphically ex
presses tyrannical internal contradiction.
"It should have been this great time, but I felt
so empty. I got straight As and I binged and binged
and binged." Cathy remembers.
Dissonance triggers the dissonant behavior.
The sole choice is perceived as that between ascetic
restraint and greedy sensuality, fasting and feasting.
As if re-enacting Eve's fall from grace upon biting
the apple in Eden, bingeing embodies the release
and the shame of transgression, while purging im
itates the attempt to regain purity.
All the women with eating disorders interviewed
for this article described themselves as having ap
peared to be "perfect," and described bulimia as an
expression of the disparity between that image and
internal reality.
Sherri Matteo, of the Feminist Studies Program,
equates women's extreme perceptions of food and
feeding with the traditional "Madonna or Whore"
versions of womanhood.
A punishing reward
Bulimics apply the terminology of reward and
punishment to their behaviors, but inconsistently.
Bingeing is both self-gratification and masochism;
purging is a relief and a revenge.
The same pattern of acknowledged contradictions
is evident in Cathy's repetition of her thoughts
