# Bulimia:
## Falling from imagined grace 
### Kate Summerscale 
Editor's note: This is the second of two articles on
bulimia. The names of women with eating disorders
have been changed.

"I was the perfect child and I hated myself," says
Anne.
Cathy first hinged upon receiving her best grades
ever.
The binge-purge cycle of bulimia graphically ex
presses tyrannical internal contradiction.
"It should have been this great time, but I felt
so empty. I got straight As and I binged and binged
and binged." Cathy remembers.
Dissonance triggers the dissonant behavior.
The sole choice is perceived as that between ascetic
restraint and greedy sensuality, fasting and feasting.
As if re-enacting Eve's fall from grace upon biting
the apple in Eden, bingeing embodies the release
and the shame of transgression, while purging im
itates the attempt to regain purity.
All the women with eating disorders interviewed
for this article described themselves as having ap
peared to be "perfect," and described bulimia as an
expression of the disparity between that image and
internal reality.
Sherri Matteo, of the Feminist Studies Program,
equates women's extreme perceptions of food and
feeding with the traditional "Madonna or Whore"
versions of womanhood.
A punishing reward
Bulimics apply the terminology of reward and
punishment to their behaviors, but inconsistently.
Bingeing is both self-gratification and masochism;
purging is a relief and a revenge.
The same pattern of acknowledged contradictions
is evident in Cathy's repetition of her thoughts
during her first vomiting session.
"If somebody saw me right now,
they'd think I was so out of con
trol."
All bulimics describe bingeing
as a loss of control and purging
as the regaining of control. The
cycle enables an apparent mastery
of food intake and weight, but
increasingly becomes symbolic of
a failure to cope as the behavior
becomes compulsive and controll
ing.
Shedding no pounds or tears
Bulimic behavior is a condensed
version of the fasts and binges
many women engage in. Gloria,
who is not technically bulimic, is
a compulsive over-eater who
balances a "week of badness" with
strict dieting and five or six hours
a day of physical exercise.
"I seem strong," she says, "So
it is difficult to cry or say some
thing hurts."
Instead, she uses food as "an
emotional mender, instant
warmth, a sedative." She has two
wardrobes for her two weights,
her two modes, her two selves.
Gloria's father, like Cathy's, is
an alcoholic, and she describes
herself as a "carboholic." Recent
studies from UC-Berkeley and
UCLA suggest that vulnerability
to eating disorders and other "ad
dictions" may be familial.
Cowell nutritionist Laura
Brainin Rodriguez, who describes
the vomiting cycle as an "ineffi
cient method of weight manage
ment," produces ample evidence
for the argument that weight loss
lowers your metabolism, upsets
your water levels and eventually
makes you fat.
Yet compulsive or continual
dieting is widespread on the Stan
ford campus. Freshmen refer to
slimming diets as a constant
preoccupation of the females
among them.
Diane, a sophomore who first
dieted upon coming to Stanford,
describes the social withdrawal
that results from an obsession
with food. Having lost weight, she
says she "thought everything

would be perfect, and when it
wasn't 1 started dieting some
more."
Statistics of depression
Few women reported them
selves as bulimic in a 1985 survey
of the "Health of Stanford Varsity
Athletes," but the study did show
significant sex differences in atti
tudes to weight and food.
A sampling of the data il
lustrates this: 63 percent of female
and 14 percent of male athletes
consider themselves overweight;
68 percent of women and 7 percent
of men feel down on themselves,
angry or depressed after an eating
binge; 29 percent of women and
2 percent of men consider their
binges abnormal.
Opinions about the causes and
treatment of bulimia are, like the
behavior, confused, drawing on
divergent and sometimes not
easily compatible fields. The most
inclusive definition terms bulimia
a "biopsychosocial" disease that
requires multidisciplinary treat
ment, including individual and
group therapy, and physiological
and nutritional supervision.
The physiological causes of
bulimia must not be overlooked.
The temptation to binge, and even
bulimic behavior, can often be
prompted by straightforward
hunger, brought on by purging,
dieting or fasting.
In 1950, Ancel Keys, a professor
at the University of Minnesota
systematically halved the calorific
intake of 36 young male volun
teers over a period of six months.
The men suffered dramatic psy
chological changes, becoming
obsessed by food and losing all
sexual and social interests. Three
of the men became chefs after the
experiment; several developed per
sistent bulimic behaviors.
Women seeing men looking
Media images of women are con
sistently cited as the major socie
tal contribution to eating disor
ders. While Playboy centerfolds
and Miss America contestants —
who are ampler than most fashion
models — have become signifi
cantly thinner and more tubular
during the past 25 years, the
average woman's weight has ac
tually increased by five to six

pounds, according to U.S. Census
data.
In advertisements, encourage
ment to consume is accompanied
by images of impossible slimness.
The weight loss industry is thriv
ing. But apparently, women inter
pret the current emphasis on fit
ness differently than men do.
A 1984 Glamour magazine sur
vey found that 95 percent of the
33,000 female respondents used
exercise explicitly for weight con
trol. In his study of the nude in
art, historian John Berger writes
"Men look at women. Women
watch themselves being looked
at."
Whatever the causes, problems
with food are especially acute for
this generation of young women.
The Glamour survey also found
that while 7.6 percent of women
over 30 had ever vomited for
weight loss, 20 percent of women
under 20 had done so.
In an attempt to investigate and
counter the impact of the societal
factors, Cowell's Dr. Harvey
Weinstein wrote last fall to The
Daily asking for volunteers for a
"task force" to examine the prob
lem on campus. "Maybe," he says,
"we need a safer eating approach,
like a safer sex approach."
Sophomore Kirsten Sword
proposes instigating a SWOPSI
course on eating disorders next
spring quarter. Sword currently
leads "Body-Image, Food and Self-
Esteem," an outreach program
and support group at the Bridge
which works to increase aware
ness and understanding of
bulimia and anorexia on campus.
Going it alone
At present, preventive education
about eating disorders is confined
to what Matteo describes as "just
individuals doing what they can."
Although being "ready" for
treatment is a condition for
recovery, it is in the nature of
bulimia that a sense of helpless
ness is countered and fueled by a
compulsion to be self-sufficient.
Since bulimia is largely a symp
tom of being incapable of assert
ing need, it is particularly impor
tant that responsibility for the ill
ness and the sufferer be shared.

UCLA suggest that vulnerability
to eating disorders and other "ad
dictions" may be familial.
Cowell nutritionist Laura
Brainin Rodriguez, who describes
the vomiting cycle as an "ineffi
cient method of weight manage
ment," produces ample evidence
for the argument that weight loss
lowers your metabolism, upsets
your water levels and eventually
makes you fat.
Yet compulsive or continual
dieting is widespread on the Stan
ford campus. Freshmen refer to
slimming diets as a constant
preoccupation of the females
among them.
Diane, a sophomore who first
dieted upon coming to Stanford,
describes the social withdrawal
that results from an obsession
with food. Having lost weight, she
says she "thought everything

would be perfect, and when it
wasn't 1 started dieting some
more."
Statistics of depression
Few women reported them
selves as bulimic in a 1985 survey
of the "Health of Stanford Varsity
Athletes," but the study did show
significant sex differences in atti
tudes to weight and food.
A sampling of the data il
lustrates this: 63 percent of female
and 14 percent of male athletes
consider themselves overweight;
68 percent of women and 7 percent
of men feel down on themselves,
angry or depressed after an eating
binge; 29 percent of women and
2 percent of men consider their
binges abnormal.
Opinions about the causes and
treatment of bulimia are, like the
behavior, confused, drawing on
divergent and sometimes not
easily compatible fields. The most
inclusive definition terms bulimia
a "biopsychosocial" disease that
requires multidisciplinary treat
ment, including individual and
group therapy, and physiological
and nutritional supervision.
The physiological causes of
bulimia must not be overlooked.
The temptation to binge, and even
bulimic behavior, can often be
prompted by straightforward
hunger, brought on by purging,
dieting or fasting.
In 1950, Ancel Keys, a professor
at the University of Minnesota
systematically halved the calorific
intake of 36 young male volun
teers over a period of six months.
The men suffered dramatic psy
chological changes, becoming
obsessed by food and losing all
sexual and social interests. Three
of the men became chefs after the
experiment; several developed per
sistent bulimic behaviors.
Women seeing men looking
Media images of women are con
sistently cited as the major socie
tal contribution to eating disor
ders. While Playboy centerfolds
and Miss America contestants —
who are ampler than most fashion
models — have become signifi
cantly thinner and more tubular
during the past 25 years, the
average woman's weight has ac
tually increased by five to six

pounds, according to U.S. Census
data.
In advertisements, encourage
ment to consume is accompanied
by images of impossible slimness.
The weight loss industry is thriv
ing. But apparently, women inter
pret the current emphasis on fit
ness differently than men do.
A 1984 Glamour magazine sur
vey found that 95 percent of the
33,000 female respondents used
exercise explicitly for weight con
trol. In his study of the nude in
art, historian John Berger writes
"Men look at women. Women
watch themselves being looked
at."
Whatever the causes, problems
with food are especially acute for
this generation of young women.
The Glamour survey also found
that while 7.6 percent of women
over 30 had ever vomited for
weight loss, 20 percent of women
under 20 had done so.
In an attempt to investigate and
counter the impact of the societal
factors, Cowell's Dr. Harvey
Weinstein wrote last fall to The
Daily asking for volunteers for a
"task force" to examine the prob
lem on campus. "Maybe," he says,
"we need a safer eating approach,
like a safer sex approach."
Sophomore Kirsten Sword
proposes instigating a SWOPSI
course on eating disorders next
spring quarter. Sword currently
leads "Body-Image, Food and Self-
Esteem," an outreach program
and support group at the Bridge
which works to increase aware
ness and understanding of
bulimia and anorexia on campus.
Going it alone
At present, preventive education
about eating disorders is confined
to what Matteo describes as "just
individuals doing what they can."
Although being "ready" for
treatment is a condition for
recovery, it is in the nature of
bulimia that a sense of helpless
ness is countered and fueled by a
compulsion to be self-sufficient.
Since bulimia is largely a symp
tom of being incapable of assert
ing need, it is particularly impor
tant that responsibility for the ill
ness and the sufferer be shared.
Editor's note: This is the second of two articles on
bulimia. The names of women with eating disorders
have been changed.

"I was the perfect child and I hated myself," says
Anne.
Cathy first hinged upon receiving her best grades
ever.
The binge-purge cycle of bulimia graphically ex
presses tyrannical internal contradiction.
"It should have been this great time, but I felt
so empty. I got straight As and I binged and binged
and binged." Cathy remembers.
Dissonance triggers the dissonant behavior.
The sole choice is perceived as that between ascetic
restraint and greedy sensuality, fasting and feasting.
As if re-enacting Eve's fall from grace upon biting
the apple in Eden, bingeing embodies the release
and the shame of transgression, while purging im
itates the attempt to regain purity.
All the women with eating disorders interviewed
for this article described themselves as having ap
peared to be "perfect," and described bulimia as an
expression of the disparity between that image and
internal reality.
Sherri Matteo, of the Feminist Studies Program,
equates women's extreme perceptions of food and
feeding with the traditional "Madonna or Whore"
versions of womanhood.
A punishing reward
Bulimics apply the terminology of reward and
punishment to their behaviors, but inconsistently.
Bingeing is both self-gratification and masochism;
purging is a relief and a revenge.
The same pattern of acknowledged contradictions
is evident in Cathy's repetition of her thoughts
during her first vomiting session.
"If somebody saw me right now,
they'd think I was so out of con
trol."
All bulimics describe bingeing
as a loss of control and purging
as the regaining of control. The
cycle enables an apparent mastery
of food intake and weight, but
increasingly becomes symbolic of
a failure to cope as the behavior
becomes compulsive and controll
ing.
Shedding no pounds or tears
Bulimic behavior is a condensed
version of the fasts and binges
many women engage in. Gloria,
who is not technically bulimic, is
a compulsive over-eater who
balances a "week of badness" with
strict dieting and five or six hours
a day of physical exercise.
"I seem strong," she says, "So
it is difficult to cry or say some
thing hurts."
Instead, she uses food as "an
emotional mender, instant
warmth, a sedative." She has two
wardrobes for her two weights,
her two modes, her two selves.
Gloria's father, like Cathy's, is
an alcoholic, and she describes
herself as a "carboholic." Recent
studies from UC-Berkeley and
UCLA suggest that vulnerability
to eating disorders and other "ad
dictions" may be familial.
