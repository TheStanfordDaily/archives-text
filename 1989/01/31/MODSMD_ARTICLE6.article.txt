# Panel considers Stanford's policy toward polluters

Raising the question of how to invest in environ
mentally responsible companies and turn a profit,
a five-member panel of financial leaders set out to
explain the guidelines the University follows for
selecting companies to investment in.
As part of a Sunday "You Can Make a Difference"
conference program, Gary Malone, chair of the Uni
versity's Committee on Investment Responsibility
explained that the University has now become more
critical in its evaluation of potential investments by
taking environmental issues into consideration.
In the past three or four years, Malone said, "The
focus of the committee was only investigating com
panies involved with South Africa." Since the be-
ginning of the school year, the
commission has incorporated en
vironmental issues as topics of in
vestigation.
Toxic waste and transportation
of nuclear wastes are now the is
sues most important to the com
mittee. Nevertheless, because the
University does not have a more
defined set of environmental
guidelines, the committee is
flexible in its future investiga
tions.
Malone said the University has
yet to establish "the criteria for
investments" and now follows
tentative guidelines of environ
mental responsibility which com
panies must comply with. The
University informs non
complying companies of the
changes needed and divests if the
changes are not carried out.
Once initial investments are
made, the committee checks for
any "undesirable social, economic
and political acts," according to a
history of the committee written

by Malone. The body then decides
whether to continue investing in
them.
Other panelists at Sunday's dis
cussion included Harry Turner,
University deputy treasurer;
Nancy Pfund, general partner of
Hambrecht and Quist Venture
Partners; Jon Lickerman, re
search analyst with Working As
sets Money Fund; and Michael
Kieshnick, co-founder of Working
Assets Money Fund.
WTiile Stanford's environmental
guidelines are still tentative, Lick
erman noted that his group fol
lows the guidelines set out by the
Environmental Protection Agency.
Working Assets Money Fund
does "not invest with corporations
who do not comply with Environ
mental Protection Agency regula
tions," he said.
Furthermore, Lickerman noted
that although environmental is
sues are complex, it is neverthe
less very important to learn how
to evaluate a company's environ
mental performance. "It is the so
cial responsibilty of investors to
define the criteria for invest
ment," Lickerman said.
