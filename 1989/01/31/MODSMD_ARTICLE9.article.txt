# Computerized elections would take ASSU into 21st century
## 
### Baldwin Lee Staff writer 
Stanford could become the only
mtyor university to hold fully com
puterized student government
elections if the ASSU successfully
implements its planned comput
erized voting system this spring.
Of eight universities surveyed,
all use either a ballot box or
Scantron voting system. The uni
versities surveyed were Duke,
Harvard, Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, Princeton, Univer
sity of Michigan, USC, University
of Virginia and Yale.
The Undergraduate Association
of MIT is the only student gov
ernment besides Stanford that is
considering a computerized voting
system. However, the issue is still
in the discussion stage.

Harvard and Yale student gov
ernment officials stated that the
schools do not need to com
puterize their voting process be
cause of the lower number of
voters and the fact that all voters
live on campus. Harvard and Yale
include only undergraduates in
their main student government
while Stanford includes graduate
students as well.
The ASSU wants to com
puterize the elections because it
will decrease the amount of time
required for tabulation, according
to ASSU election chair Steve
Krauss. About 6,000 students, a
50 percent voter turnout rate,
voted in last spring's elections;
official election results were not
publicly announced until five days
after the polls were officially
closed.

Michigan and USC, schools with
comparable voter turnout rates to
Stanford, manage to offer next
day results. All other student gov
ernments surveyed also had
next-day results.
All of the main student govern
ments surveyed, except for USC
and Stanford, include only under
graduates. It is more difficult to
generate a high voter turnout
with graduate students because
they are typically much less in
volved in student government.
Yet, Stanford is capable of main
taining a similar voter turnout
rate to Duke and Harvard.
Krauss attributed the ability of
Stanford to match the voter turn
out rate to the ASSU's system of
withholding fee refunds from non
voters.

university turnout rate, about 60
percent in its main election held
last weekend, according to Peter
Levine, a student government of
ficial. Levine credits this to good
publicity, and that every student
has to pass by a voting site located
in every dining hall.
Larger schools such as the Uni
versity of Virginia have a much
more difficult time getting in con
tact with students because of the
larger campus and large numbers

of students who live off-campus,
according to University of Vir
ginia Student Council election
chair Sally Coleman.
Michigan Daily news editor Eve
Becker said that a problem
with elections in large schools
with off-campus students is that
voting sites are "not in front of
you." However, she attributed the
particularly low voting turnout
for Michigan Student Assembly
elections, about 14 percent, to lack
of publicity and student disillu
sionment with the assembly.
A computerized process should
also decrease the cost of running
an election, according to Krauss.
Under the current system, the
ASSU doles out about $5,000 per
election to rent equipment from
the Santa Clara County Register's
Office in San Jose.
