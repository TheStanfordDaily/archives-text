# Computer experts criticize bulletin board close down

The University's shutdown of an electronic bul
letin board charged with broadcasting racist jokes
is brewing a campus controversy, with more than
50 computer science experts now criticizing the
censorship.
Computer Science Prof. John McCarthy began
circulating a statement protesting the shutdown
Sunday. Some Computer Science Department faculty
and students as well as several members of the
Stanford Data Center joined the protest, giving their
approval of McCarthy's statement via electronic
mail.
McCarthy's statement calls electronic bulletin
boards, otherwise known as news groups, "the com
puter analog of magazines and a partial prototype
of future universal computer libraries."
Removing the news group is like purging a book
from a library, McCarthy wrote, adding "To be able
to read anything subject only to cost limitations is
an essential part of academic freedom."
Director of Academic Information Resources
Ralph Gorin made the decision to shut down the
humor news group, called "rec.humor.funny," in
early January and is sticking by his decision despite
the current protest.
Since then, McCarthy has allowed the
"rec.humor.funny" file to be accessible on a com
puter under his control, but he does not have au
thorization over the Computer Science Department
computers.
According to Gorin, "rec.humor.funny" included
several racist and sexist jokes, and did not provide
an avenue for readers to respond because a
moderator edits the messages over the news group.
However, a copy of one of the controversial jokes
on "rec.humor.funny" obtained by The Daily reveals
that potentially offensive jokes are sent "encrypted"
in special code. For example, the first line reads:
"{rq n WRQE {Wrqqre} vf n Wbxr Rguavp/
Qrabzvangvba/Enpr."
According to McCarthy, the code is simple and
widely known, but the fact that the offensive jokes
are not immediately readable allows computer users
to avoid them easily.
A moderator receives, edits and broadcasts infor
mation over a computer network. The moderator
is the sole controller of the content of an electronic
