# English prof. places CIV origins in 1960s

### Lisa Lawrence Staff writer 
In an article tracing the evolution of the
new Cultures, Ideas and Values program,
English Prof. Herbert Lindenberger claims
the curriculum change resulted from an in
creasing appreciation, rooted in the 19605,
for non-European cultures.
The article, which is scheduled to appear
later this year in a yearbook of critical essays
titled "Comparative Criticism," asserts that
the larger issues of cultural appreciation
embodied in the debate were in a sense
political.
Lindenberger was a member of Stanford's
Faculty Senate last winter and spring when
the Faculty Senate debated the Western Cul
ture requirement.
In the essay titled "On the Sacrality of
Reading Lists: The Western Culture Debate
at Stanford University," Lindenberger
writes, "Attempts to modify or replace
canons are always in some sense political
— though what we label 'political' can itself
not easily be separated from what we call
'cultural' ... To separate the political from

the aesthetic is to see the world with
blinkers."
He attributes the increased attention paid
to non-Western cultures in universities to
the common political background of many
professors.
Lindenberger stated that many of the
changing attitudes of faculty members can
be traced to the civil rights struggle that
peaked in the 1960s during their formative
years.
The political consciousness of blacks
helped the United States to see the world
in a broader perspective, Lindenberger said.
As an example, he cites "Equiano's
Travels" by Olaudah Equiano, a Nigerian
sold into slavery. The autobiography was
first published in 1789 in Great Britain,
and was famous in both Great Britain and
the United States up until 1827.
The book was not revived in a slightly
abridged edition until 1967 — around the
time of the civil rights movement.
Western civilization courses of the past,
according to Lindenberger, were an attempt
to ensure that the children of the United
States's emerging middle class would be

familiar with the writers that their teachers
saw as binding their culture together.
Stanford's first western civilizations
course started in 1935 in the History De
partment and lasted until the late 1960s
when Lindenberger said "it fell victim to
sentiments voiced by students and faculty
members alike that students should feel free
to choose their own courses."
The Western Culture requirement was in
stituted in 1980 and differed from the pre
vious course because it was designed as a
group of related tracks with different em
phases rather than as a single class.
According to Lindenberger, the new CIV
track brings about a chance for "new
vitality" for both the faculty and the stu
dents, adding that professors who have been
teaching the same texts each year will have
added incentive to experiment with new
works.
Lindenberger is "hopeful that despite the
shortage of faculty members available for
CIV, the new course will provide an oppor
tunity for new energy to be released in the
classroom."
