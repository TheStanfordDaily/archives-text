## 17 die in military jet crash 
### 
ABILENE, Texas (AP) — A mil
itary refueling jet bound for
Hawaii with 19 people aboard
crashed in a ball of flames on
takeoff yesterday at Dyess Air
Force Base, killing at least 17
people, the Air Force said.
Officials at K.I. Sawyer Air
Force Base near Marquette, Mich
igan, where the flight originated,
said the plane's passengers in
cluded spouses of military mem
bers or retired military members.
No children were believed to be
on board.
The plane's crew "never got it
off the ground," said witness Ver
non Wright, 19. "The first thing
I saw was just the mushroom of
the smoke."
"I heard the plane as it was
coming down," said Skeet Jackson
of Abilene. "Engines were back
firing and missing. It curved off
to the left and crashed. And then
I saw the ball of smoke and fire
go up."
Initial reports fowarded to Air
Force commanders at the Penta
gon suggested the pilot of the

plane experienced some kind of
problem during his take-off roll,
according to officials who spoke
on condition they not be identi
fied.
"It was toward the end of the
roll and he apparently had no
choice but to press on," said one
source.
"But he didn't have the power
to get up for some reason," added
another.
The wreckage burned for more
than an hour after the crash. The
plane came to rest tilted at about
a 45 degree angle, a charred wing
tipped toward the sky.
The plane was en route from
Dyess to Hickam Air Force Base
in Hawaii on a training mission
with 19 people on board, said
Dyess Airman Ist Class Beverly
Foster. At least 17 people were
killed, said Lt. Col. George Peck,
a spokesman at Strategic Air
Command Headquarters at
Omaha, Neb.
Tech. Sgt. Anita Bailey at
Sawyer said officials there were
not certain who was on board.

"We had family members, that
is, either spouses of military
members or spouses of retired
military members. If you want to
call that civilians, yeah, that is
we don't have anybody not related
to the military," she said.
"Because we have people on
both bases and we have folks
other than active duty, it's taking
a little longer to get ahold of all
the families."
The sources in Washington said
the plane was carrying close to a
full load of fuel totaling 155,000
pounds, including its own fuel and
fuel to transfer during the flight
to Hawaii to some F-16 fighters
flying across the Pacific.
The Air Force said the KC-135A
tanker crashed at 12:10 p.m. near
the south end of the Dyess run
way, near U.S. Highway 277 about
six miles southwest of Abilene.
The maintenance record for the
plane, powered by four Pratt &
Whitney jet engines, was not yet
available, Peck said.
There is no ejection system on
the plane, built in 1963, said Peck.
