# Impartial North jurors may be hard to find
## Iran-Contra judge says televised testimony could cause problems of bias 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
judge in Oliver North's Iran-
Contra trial chose seven people
for possible jury duty during yes
terday's long opening day but said
there could be problems with the
"triability of the case" because so
many potential jurors had seen or
read of North's testimony in con
gressional hearings.
U.S. District Judge Gerhard
Gesell said only 16 of the first 54
prospective jurors indicated on
questionnaires that they weren't
exposed to North's congressional
appearances in which he supplied
details about misleading Congress
and shredding documents. The
former White House aide testified
to House and Senate investigating
committees in 1987 under a grant
of limited immunity from prose

cution.
North's lawyers, who contend
an impartial jury cannot be em
paneled, objected as Gesell picked
the first seven people for a pool
from which the jury might even
tually be chosen. The selection
process will continue today.
Defense lawyers also filed a mo
tion asking that "in the event a
jury can be empaneled, it should
be sequestered immediately to
minimize the potential for expo
sure to immunized testimony and
to protect Lt. Col. North's consti
tutional rights."
One of those in the pool of pro
spective jurors, a retired postal
clerk, said she paid as much at
tention to North's televised tes
timony as she paid to "the three
Stooges." She said her house had

burned down and she was occu
pied at the time of North's con
gressional testimony with itemiz
ing household items that had been
lost in the blaze.
Still, North's lawyers objected
to her selection, noting she said
she turned on a TV set during
North's testimony but said in her
questionnaire she had seen none
of the hearings.
Another ordered into the jury
pool was an unemployed man
looking for work as a security
guard who said he saw North on
television during the congres
sional hearings but knew nothing
about him. Attorney Barry Simon
objected to the selection, saying
that "if he heard even one" small
portion of North's testimony,
"which he very easily could have,"

he should be disqualified.
Gesell also heard arguments on
how exposure to North's earlier
testimony should affect qualifica
tion or disqualification of other
potential jurors.
John Keker, the head of the
prosecution team, argued that the
question should be whether a po
tential juror can be fair and im
partial, not whether the person
was exposed to lUrth's testimony.
In that testimony, North detailed
instances of misleading Congress
and altering and shredding docu
ments as well as other matters
for which he is now charged with
crimes.
North attorney Simon said
anyone who was exposed to
North's testimony should be dis
qualified.
