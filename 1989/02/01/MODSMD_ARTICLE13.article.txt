# Tower accused of 'impropriety'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A con
servative activist testified yester
day he has "on a number of oc
casions" seen Defense Secretary
designate John Tower publicly in
ebriated and in the company of
women other than his wife.
But members of the Senate
Armed Services Committee said
after a closed session with the
witness that he failed to provide
specifics to support his allegation.
"1 have made enough personal
observations of this man here in
Washington to have serious
reservations about his moral char
acter," Paul Weyrich told the Sen
ate panel, which is conducting
Tower's confirmation hearing.
Weyrich's comments prompted
quick criticism from Sen. Malcolm
Wallop, R-Wyo., who complained
about "innucndos and insinua

tions" against the former Texas
senator.
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the
chairman, suggested any further
discussion of Tower's personal fit
ness take place in a previously
scheduled afternoon session that
was closed to the public.
Senators emerging from that
session sounded unimpressed.
"A number of allegations prove
to be wrong," said Nunn, who
added that the committee is "con
tinuing to pursue all allegations."
"I heard nothing that you didn't
hear in the open session. I didn't
hear anything persuasive to me,"
Wallop said.
"Beyond statements of seeing
Senator Tower on a couple of oc
casions carrying a little more al
cohol than he should have, he
hasn't been able to add anything

specific that wasn't hearsay," said
Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif.
Tower refused to comment on
the allegations or executive ses
sion as he left the committee of
fice.
Tower was not present when
Weyrich took the witness chair
and uttered in public the allega
tions that had simmered for
several weeks while President
Bush was deciding on a candidate
to head the Pentagon.
"Over many years, I have en
countered the nominee in a con
dition lacking sobriety as well as
with women to whom he was not
married; I recognize senators'
wives because I worked here in
the Senate for many years,"
Weyrich said.
"I did encounter this on a num
ber of occasions."
