# Editorial
## Editor's welcome 
### 
INTENSE-LOOKING fresh
men drooling for a first Daily
assignment packed the place.
The sight of two ugly yellow sofas
along the walls and a wobbly
brown table as a centerpiece
should have been a warning sig
nal.
But once the editor in chief
rose and began to describe his
visions of a Daily career I was
impressed. He promised hot
stories running off the front,
probing pieces that would shake
the University.
He lied.
The crowd dispersed; writers
began hunting down different de
partment editors. A gawky Fea
tures editor cornered me; I
flipped out my notebook ready
for my first juicy assignment.
"Kathy," he said, looking me
straight in the eye, "Your first
story, and $ know you're ready
for it, is a profile on â€” dorm
cooks."
Flashes of barbeque beef
burgers and eggplant stackup
popped into mind. "So much for
exciting journalism," I thought.
I was too much of a wimp to
tell him the idea was stupid. I
was stuck with the story.
But that night, at a Stern Hall
dinner, I began to notice details.
Someone out there was trying.
After some snooping around, I
found Bill.
As the man in charge of Stern
Food Service, Bill slaved to give
students their choice of chunky,
smooth or natural peanut butter.
At midnight he was headed to
the San Francisco airport to pick
up fresh Hawaiian pineapple
shipped in for a dorm luau. Bill
sometimes worked 15 days
straight to keep operations in
tow.
A week later, my feature story
profiling Bill and his efforts made

The Daily. Friends were reading
it ... so were strangers.
I went back for a second as
signment.
The Daily offers students a
chance to look at Stanford with
a reporter's eye, to find the char
acters who bring life to the
campus. Everyone working at
The Daily is a student who is
here to learn.
During the next four months,
we will be trying some new things
to improve the paper's coverage
and to keep challenging our
selves.
In today's paper, for instance,
is a Science section, which will
cover everything from psychology
to astrophysics.
Every Thursday, "Intermis
sion," The Daily's new pullout
Entertainment section, will spot
light on and off-campus happen
ings and will have some zany,
fun reviews.
To draw in new writers, pho
tographers and artists, the staff
will also be holding Thursday
recruitment meetings. The first
one is scheduled for Feb. 9 at
noon.
You do not need previous jour
nalism experience to be part of
The Daily. You can write a letter,
phone in a suggestion or come
pick up an assignment. . . .
Your first stab at a story can
be as simple as sitting down in
your dorm dining hall and taking
a good look around. It worked
for me, and I sincerely hope you'll
think about giving us a try.
