Club Ujamaa fliers
made policy clear
WE, THE CLUB Ujamaa Plan
ning Committee, are sincerely
sorry that Peter Dominick in
his Jan. 31 letter said that the term
"Semi-Formal Attire" was insufficient
to define the dress code at Club
Ujamaa this year. The fact of the
matter is that we assumed most of the
Stanford student body knew the mean
ing of the phrase: "Semi-Formal Attire
Only."
The mere fact that the word "only"
was included indicates that the subject
was not optional and not taken lightly.
Though we don't view the phrase as
particularly vague, we will (just for the
sake of Dominick and those who may
happen to agree with him) specify on
our next poster that semi-formal
means: no jeans and no tennis shoes.
It is entirely possible that there were
people passing through the event
wearing casual attire and maybe even
no shoes. These people were residents
of Ujamaa House or other Lagunita
Court dorms. Since the event is held in
a residence hall, we, as coordinators,
have absolutely no right to dictate the
attire of those who are en route to
their rooms (assuming they are not
patrons of the event).
Lastly, we believe the term "pan
handle" in reference to dorm solicita
tions is in bad taste. Club Ujamaa is
an annual event open to the entire
campus, and it is not a cheap one. We
don't believe that there is anything
wrong with asking the various dorms
to donate to an event that most of
their residents will attend.
Dorms may contribute but they by
no means bear the brunt of the costs
for the entire event. Also we believe
that it is appropriate to mention that
all solicitors for Club Ujamaa are given
a sheet from which they read about
the semi-formal nature of the event. In

addition to that measure, the resident
assistants of each dorm we visited were
given a flier which read: "Club Ujamaa
will take place on Saturday, Jan. 28,
1989 from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. Dress is at
the very least semi-formal and enforced
at all times. No jeans, T-shirts, tennis
shoes or exceptions."

Abortion not at all
like tbfe Holocaust
Everyone is entitled to his or her
own opinion on the controversial sub
ject of abortion. But David Haddon, in
a Jan. 27 letter, draws an analogy
between abortion and the horror of
Nazi Germany which is entirely inap
propriate and insulting.
Haddon judges, "The enormity of
this crime [abortionl against humanity
is incomprehensible; already it far
exceeds that of the Nazi Final Solu
tion."
I presume he made this statement
for its melodrama, but in attempting
to exploit the emotional horror con
nected with the Holocaust, Haddon
trivializes the gravity of the crime and
insults its survivors.
The 11 million murdered in Nazi
Germany were not potential people;
they were real. None lacked nervous
systems, or had partially developed
ones; they felt pain.
All were viable and had a complex
sense of reality; they deeply experi
enced their world's hatred. The Jewish
people and other "undesirables" of
Nazi Germany were systematically
hunted down, physically and psychologi
cally tortured, then "exterminated,"
cruelly and sadistically. Abortion is not
genocide.'
The zygote or fetus is a potential
child; it is like a blueprint for a prod
uct yet to come. Does Haddon equate

the discarding of a blueprint with the
destruction of a building? I resent his
implication that the malicious murder
of more than 11 million people is an
insignificant "crime against humanity"
compared to the practice of abortion.
In this country, we are fortunate
enough not to have our morality dic
tated to us; the German people once
forgot how essential this is. I value
actual life over potential life, and I
won't allow Haddon to dictate my
morality otherwise. What I do with my
body is not Haddon's choice. I don't
hold his beliefs or see the "nature of
God" as he sees it, but I respect his
right to live life by his own morals.
Respect mine.

The United Graduate Student Alli
ance received University President
Donald Kennedy's Jan. 10 letter and
we were very disappointed that Ken
nedy overlooked the commitment he
made to us on Dec. 5.
He clearly pledged a meeting with us
"no later than mid-January if the Uni
versity Committee on Minority Issues
report were delayed again." Kennedy
also said the mid-January meeting
would convey his specific response to
the graduate alliance's report he re
ceived in early December.
We have recently learned that the
UCMI report will not be ready until
early March. Therefore, we would ap
preciate it if Kennedy would honor his
commitment for a January meeting
specifically on the graduate alliance's
report.
Recent attempts by this quarter's
alliance facilitator, John Kenney, to set
up a January meeting with Kennedy
have been rebuffed. We do not find
this encouraging since we had hoped to
establish a partnership with the Stan

ford administration to address minority
issues here. Not only are we eager to
hear Kennedy's response to our report
but we would also like to discuss the
interim graduate housing option for the
coming school year.
We look forward to meeting with
Kennedy as soon as possible.

sake of Dominick and those who may
happen to agree with him) specify on
our next poster that semi-formal
means: no jeans and no tennis shoes.
It is entirely possible that there were
people passing through the event
wearing casual attire and maybe even
no shoes. These people were residents
of Ujamaa House or other Lagunita
Court dorms. Since the event is held in
a residence hall, we, as coordinators,
have absolutely no right to dictate the
attire of those who are en route to
their rooms (assuming they are not
patrons of the event).
Lastly, we believe the term "pan
handle" in reference to dorm solicita
tions is in bad taste. Club Ujamaa is
an annual event open to the entire
campus, and it is not a cheap one. We
don't believe that there is anything
wrong with asking the various dorms
to donate to an event that most of
their residents will attend.
Dorms may contribute but they by
no means bear the brunt of the costs
for the entire event. Also we believe
that it is appropriate to mention that
all solicitors for Club Ujamaa are given
a sheet from which they read about
the semi-formal nature of the event. In

addition to that measure, the resident
assistants of each dorm we visited were
given a flier which read: "Club Ujamaa
will take place on Saturday, Jan. 28,
1989 from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. Dress is at
the very least semi-formal and enforced
at all times. No jeans, T-shirts, tennis
shoes or exceptions."

Abortion not at all
like tbfe Holocaust
Everyone is entitled to his or her
own opinion on the controversial sub
ject of abortion. But David Haddon, in
a Jan. 27 letter, draws an analogy
between abortion and the horror of
Nazi Germany which is entirely inap
propriate and insulting.
Haddon judges, "The enormity of
this crime [abortionl against humanity
is incomprehensible; already it far
exceeds that of the Nazi Final Solu
tion."
I presume he made this statement
for its melodrama, but in attempting
to exploit the emotional horror con
nected with the Holocaust, Haddon
trivializes the gravity of the crime and
insults its survivors.
The 11 million murdered in Nazi
Germany were not potential people;
they were real. None lacked nervous
systems, or had partially developed
ones; they felt pain.
All were viable and had a complex
sense of reality; they deeply experi
enced their world's hatred. The Jewish
people and other "undesirables" of
Nazi Germany were systematically
hunted down, physically and psychologi
cally tortured, then "exterminated,"
cruelly and sadistically. Abortion is not
genocide.'
The zygote or fetus is a potential
child; it is like a blueprint for a prod
uct yet to come. Does Haddon equate

the discarding of a blueprint with the
destruction of a building? I resent his
implication that the malicious murder
of more than 11 million people is an
insignificant "crime against humanity"
compared to the practice of abortion.
In this country, we are fortunate
enough not to have our morality dic
tated to us; the German people once
forgot how essential this is. I value
actual life over potential life, and I
won't allow Haddon to dictate my
morality otherwise. What I do with my
body is not Haddon's choice. I don't
hold his beliefs or see the "nature of
God" as he sees it, but I respect his
right to live life by his own morals.
Respect mine.

Grad students want
answers to UCMI
The United Graduate Student Alli
ance received University President
Donald Kennedy's Jan. 10 letter and
we were very disappointed that Ken
nedy overlooked the commitment he
made to us on Dec. 5.
He clearly pledged a meeting with us
"no later than mid-January if the Uni
versity Committee on Minority Issues
report were delayed again." Kennedy
also said the mid-January meeting
would convey his specific response to
the graduate alliance's report he re
ceived in early December.
We have recently learned that the
UCMI report will not be ready until
early March. Therefore, we would ap
preciate it if Kennedy would honor his
commitment for a January meeting
specifically on the graduate alliance's
report.
Recent attempts by this quarter's
alliance facilitator, John Kenney, to set
up a January meeting with Kennedy
have been rebuffed. We do not find
this encouraging since we had hoped to
establish a partnership with the Stan

ford administration to address minority
issues here. Not only are we eager to
hear Kennedy's response to our report
but we would also like to discuss the
interim graduate housing option for the
coming school year.
We look forward to meeting with
Kennedy as soon as possible.

WE, THE CLUB Ujamaa Plan

sorry that Peter Dominick in

to define the dress code at Club
Ujamaa this year. The fact of the
matter is that we assumed most of the

Only."
The mere fact that the word "only"
was included indicates that the subject
was not optional and not taken lightly.

happen to agree with him) specify on
