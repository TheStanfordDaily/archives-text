## Contemplating the sperm 
### 
When was the last (hopefully, it
was the last) time you spent most
of your late night hours, which
are supposedly allocated for sleep or non
work, in front of a Mac, eyes burning
with seemingly eternal weariness, trying
to grind out an assignment due the next
morning? Dead Week? Last week? Last
night? Ah, and supposedly the next morn
ing you felt 19 percent, you looked 18
percent, because you had slept zero per
cent.
Having just spent last (undoubtedly not
my last) night in front of that wonderful
Mac, hammering out that lab report on
sea urchin fertilization and embryo
genesis, I recall not how awful, how tiring
or how dreadful the evening was, but the
millions of sperm swimming around
looking for that egg, yearning for life.
Thinking about those sperm raises me
above thinking about last night's suffer
ings. • w
Before I get to my point, I should clarify
one thing for all you fuzzies out there:
that the study of science aims at the
understanding of ourselves. For example,
when we study sea urchin fertilization,
there is the underlying hope for an
elucidation of what we are and what we
mean.
OK, here is an application of the re
lationship of sea urchin fertilization to
human life. The image in my mind is
still of millions of swimming, searching,
yearning sperm. It is an image that's
hard to forget. What we observed in lab
is that only one of these hopeful sperm
will fertilize that egg.
This applies to human fertilization as

It's easier to get into
Stanford Medical
School than it is to
have been born.

well. On this earth, there are 2.5 billion
men and 2.5 billion women. Each man
has hundreds of millions of searching
sperm, and each woman has thousands
of unfertilized eggs.
Life is created by the fusion of just
one of those sperm from just one of those
men and just one of those eggs from just
one of those women, allowing for almost
infinite possibility.
So how lucky are you? Let's put it this
way. It's easier to win the state lottery
and make millions than it is to have been
born. It's easier to get into Stanford Med
ical School than it is to have been born.
It's easier to put an all-nighter in front
of a Mac than it is to have been born.
Think of what would have happened
if Dad or Mom had been using a birth
control device. Oops. Where would you
be?
It's true that existence is difficult. You
are impossible, yet what a lucky miracle.
Stop worrying so much and just accept
life as a wonderful given. You are the
proof that the hardest obstacle has al
ready been overcome. How lucky is the
one who can appreciate this!
Instead of thinking about how hard,
how tiring, how dreadful that last all

nighter was, I propose that the next time
you pat yourself on the back for what
you have just done.
Robert Pirsig writes in "Zen and the
Art of Motorcycle Maintenance," "Well,
it's hard country. They know it's hard
before they come here and are ready for
it. If one person complains he just makes
it that much harder for the others."
I'm no Zen Buddhist (although I'm con
sidering it these days), but if you have
read up to here, I hope you'll see this
ever-illusory connection: Stanford Uni
versity is "hard country." The problem
of the complainer, then, is th&t he or she
just can't forget how hard it is.
Result: The complainer forgets about
his or her sperm! (I think this is the
first time in history, science or journalism
that both males and females of the
human species "own"/"have" sperm).
So don't forget that miraculous image
of sperm swimming in your head, and
you will realize how impossible you are.
Just because of one sperm.
Save this article for future times of
need, i.e. next week. For now, just con
template the impossibility of that one
sperm fertilizing that one egg, and ap
preciate the (next to) impossible.

born. It's easier to get into Stanford Med
ical School than it is to have been born.
It's easier to put an all-nighter in front
of a Mac than it is to have been born.
Think of what would have happened
if Dad or Mom had been using a birth
control device. Oops. Where would you
be?
It's true that existence is difficult. You
are impossible, yet what a lucky miracle.
Stop worrying so much and just accept
life as a wonderful given. You are the
proof that the hardest obstacle has al
ready been overcome. How lucky is the
one who can appreciate this!
Instead of thinking about how hard,
how tiring, how dreadful that last all

nighter was, I propose that the next time
you pat yourself on the back for what
you have just done.
Robert Pirsig writes in "Zen and the
Art of Motorcycle Maintenance," "Well,
it's hard country. They know it's hard
before they come here and are ready for
it. If one person complains he just makes
it that much harder for the others."
I'm no Zen Buddhist (although I'm con
sidering it these days), but if you have
read up to here, I hope you'll see this
ever-illusory connection: Stanford Uni
versity is "hard country." The problem
of the complainer, then, is th&t he or she
just can't forget how hard it is.
Result: The complainer forgets about
his or her sperm! (I think this is the
first time in history, science or journalism
that both males and females of the
human species "own"/"have" sperm).
So don't forget that miraculous image
of sperm swimming in your head, and
you will realize how impossible you are.
Just because of one sperm.
Save this article for future times of
need, i.e. next week. For now, just con
template the impossibility of that one
sperm fertilizing that one egg, and ap
preciate the (next to) impossible.
