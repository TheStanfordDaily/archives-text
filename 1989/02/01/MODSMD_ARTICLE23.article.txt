pv . Why do we forget
vV • things when we are
tailing to people?
A, The on-the-tip-of-my
• tongue syndrome is a
result of a "retrieval cue"
being bumped from the
short term memory by a dis
traction, according to Psy
chology Prof. Gordon Bower,
a memory expert.
When speaking, people
plan their conversation in
short-term memory. This
plan consists of retrieval
cues that bring up other
memories. Since the short
term memory storing these
retrieval cues has limited
storage capacity, a distrac
tion — such as greeting
someone or introducing a
new topic of conversation —
will replace the previous
plan and retrieval cues in
the memory.
To avoid this irritating
but very common problem,
Bower suggested a tech
nique used to help absent
minded people. Visual
ization is useful for short
term storage in memory. For
better memory retention,
you should picture in your

mind whore you will be and how
you will be carrying out the ac
tion.
For example, if you want to buy
a pencil at the Stanford Bookstore,
Bower said, you could imagine
yourself in White Plaza, and that
a large pencil stops you and points
you in the direction of the book
store. When you next pass
through White Plaza, you will re

member to buy a pencil.
Q. Do toilets flush in a different
,direction south of the
equator?
A. Although the direction water
• rotates can be influenced by
the earth's spin, the direction a
toilet flushes depends mostly on
its design, Physics Prof. Douglas
Osheroff said.
Often the rotation of water in
the bowl is determined by the di
rection the nozzle is pointing,
rather than from the observed

force caused by the earth's rota
tion. Called the Coriolis effect, the
observed force is very weak.
The Coriolis force is caused by
the earth's rotation, and the effect
makes it impossible to throw ob
jects along a straight path. In
stead, they appear from the
surface of the earth to follow a
curved path when in actuality
they are going straight.
To illustrate the effect, you can
roll a marble on a dusty carousel
spinning around. As you watch it
from outside the carousel, the
marble will travel in a straight

line. The path marked by the dust,
however, will be curved because
the carousel is spinning around
underneath the marble while it
is rolling towards the center.
The Coriolis force has profound
effects on the weather, curving
the path of massive bodies of air
as they travel.
