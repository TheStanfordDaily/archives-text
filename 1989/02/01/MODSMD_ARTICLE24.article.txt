# Greenhouse effect warms up inconclusive debate
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Nobody knows if the Bay check
erspot butterfly will make it
through the next century.
The butterfly's survival
depends on whether it can adapt
to higher temperatures that
might be caused by the green
house effect, an atmospheric
buildup of carbon dioxide and
other heat-trapping gases. And
scientists are uncertain what this
local butterfly's chances of sur
vival are.
The uncertainty suggests the
major problem posed by the green
house effect. Many scientists
predict this global warming trend
will have devastating effects on
the weather, plant and animal life,
agriculture and coastal cities. But
they can't be sure.
Crude models
"There's a lot we don't know,"
said Economics Prof, and Nobel
laureate Kenneth Arrow who has
been studying some implications
of the greenhouse effect.
Arrow said he questions any
model of the greenhouse effect
that makes definite predictions,
adding that more study of the
problem is necessary before ex
perts can draw any conclusions.
Scientists are certain, however,
that unless something is done to
slow the production of carbon
dioxide, the gas level will double
by the middle of the 21st century.
Carbon dioxide, along with other
gases pumped into the atmos
phere such as methane, chloro
flourocarbons and nitrous oxide,
traps the sun's energy-filled rays.
Experts say trapped rays will
cause significant global climate
change. At least they think so.
"The models are simplistic, and
the globe is very complicated,"
Chauncey Starr said in a tele
phone interview last week. Starr,
president-emeritus of the Electric
Power Research Institute in Palo
Alto, took part in a panel discus
sion on climate change this week
end as part of the "You Can Make
a Difference" conference.
Scientists admit their models
are crude, but most of them
predict temperature rises that
could spell disaster for crops,
forests and animals. Some
climatologists predict that by the
middle of the next century we can

expect an average rise in global
temperature of 3 degrees Fahren
heit. Others say we should expect
a rise of 8 degrees Fahrenheit.
Doubts about extent of warming
The only thing scientists know
for sure is that carbon dioxide is
building up in the atmosphere at
an alarming rate. But nobody can
agree on the extent of greenhouse
warming, or even if there will be
any significant climate change.
"Even if we accept the warming,
nobody knows what will happen,"
Arrow said.
Although he agrees the effects
of the greenhouse gases might
cause severe problems in decades
to come, Arrow said "the risks
have been greatly exaggerated."
'Biological bloodbath'
Even though nobody can say
how much warming there will be,
biologists are worried. Very
worried.
Like the Bay checkerspot but
terfly, many species are destined
for trouble if temperatures rise,
even with the conservative predic
tion of a 3 degree increase.
"Basically, life on earth is very
tuned into temperature," said Stu
Weiss, a researcher in the Biolog
ical Sciences Department. None
theless, he said species might be
able to recover from climate
change by moving to higher al
titudes or by moving north.
This is not always possible,
however, since migration might
be hindered by both natural and
man-made geographical features,
such as mountains, cities and
stretches of farmland. Also, other
geographical areas might not be
suitable for the species.
Species living in limited areas,
such as the Bay checkerspot, are
especially vulnerable to restricted
migration routes.
We might be in for a "biological
bloodbath," Weiss said.
Too little and too much
Other prophecies are just as
gloomy. Ocean levels may rise sig
nificantly from melting polar caps,
and send coastal dwellers running
to higher land. Houses now lo
cated securely away from the
tides, may stand perilously close
to the water in decades to come.
And forecasts indicate that coastal
cities may be made even more vul
nerable to hurricanes.

Droughts — such as the one
last summer — may hit the
United States with increasing fre
quency and increasing severity.
Scientists predict that climate
changes will wreak havoc with
crops that are unaccustomed to
warmer weather.
Increased public awareness
Scientists' dire predictions have
thrust the possibility of a climate
change into the public spotlight.
One of the scientists chiefly re
sponsible for moving Congress to
act on preventing global climate
change is James Hansen, a
climatologist at the NASA God
dard Institute for Space Studies

in New York City.
Hansen testified last July to the
Energy and Power subcommittee
of the House of Representatives
that the global climate change was
already upon us.
He pointed out the average tem
perature of the globe in 1988 was
the hottest in recorded history,
and the four hottest years this
century have all come this decade.
In his controversial testimony,
Hansen said he could state "with
about 99 percent confidence that
current temperatures represent a
real warming trend rather than
a chance fluctuation."
Though his testimony was
highly criticized by other experts,

Hansen and other outspoken sci
entists are responsible for bring
ing the subject to the public's
attention.
Confusion over policy
Just as scientists don't know
how greenhouse gases are going
to affect the earth, policy makers
don't know what should be done
about the potentially alarming
problem.
"There is no clear picture of
what should be done about it,"
Starr said.
Nevertheless, the U.S. govern
ment h#s already started to take

action on the potential crisis.
U.S. initiatives without support
from other countries, however,
just won't cut it, Starr said. The
United States produces only about
25 percent of the world's carbon
dioxide, currently the most
prevalent greenhouse gas.
The problem is motivating
other nations to act, but chances
are, it won't be easy to reach in
ternational agreement. U.S. con
cernp are not necessarily shared
worldwide.

For instance, the Soviet Union
might actually benefit from the
greenhouse effect, Biology Prof.
Hal Mooney said this weekend in
a panel discussion on climate
change at the "You Can Make a
Difference" conference. Warmer
and wetter weather, which some
models predict for the Soviet Un
ion, might be tremendously ben
eficial to agriculture in that
country.
Even Canada, known for its en
vironmental concern, might look
with disdain at any attempt to
slow the effect that some
Canadians think might turn their
country into the breadbasket of
the world.
"We may have a very interesting
international dialogue in the fu

ture," Mooney said.
Solutions or stall tactics?
To deal with global warming,
scientists are dreaming up exotic
schemes using Star Wars technol
ogy or gigantic umbrellas to
temper greenhouse effects.
More conventional schemes for

defense against global warming
are also being devised; working
for energy efficiency, decreased
reliance on fossil fuels for energy,
reforestation and many other
measures will help to slow the
greenhouse effect.
These measures will cut pro
duction of greenhouse gases, but

researchers question how long
these precautions can maintain
the reasonable levels of green
house gases.
"They buy you time," Mooney
said at the weekend conference.
"The question I have never heard
is, 'What is anybody going to do
with the time we buy?' "

perts can draw any conclusions.
Scientists are certain, however,
that unless something is done to
slow the production of carbon
dioxide, the gas level will double
by the middle of the 21st century.
Carbon dioxide, along with other
gases pumped into the atmos
phere such as methane, chloro
flourocarbons and nitrous oxide,
traps the sun's energy-filled rays.
Experts say trapped rays will
cause significant global climate
change. At least they think so.
"The models are simplistic, and
the globe is very complicated,"
Chauncey Starr said in a tele
phone interview last week. Starr,
president-emeritus of the Electric
Power Research Institute in Palo
Alto, took part in a panel discus
sion on climate change this week
end as part of the "You Can Make
a Difference" conference.
Scientists admit their models
are crude, but most of them
predict temperature rises that
could spell disaster for crops,
forests and animals. Some
climatologists predict that by the
middle of the next century we can

expect an average rise in global
temperature of 3 degrees Fahren
heit. Others say we should expect
a rise of 8 degrees Fahrenheit.
Doubts about extent of warming
The only thing scientists know
for sure is that carbon dioxide is
building up in the atmosphere at
an alarming rate. But nobody can
agree on the extent of greenhouse
warming, or even if there will be
any significant climate change.
"Even if we accept the warming,
nobody knows what will happen,"
Arrow said.
Although he agrees the effects
of the greenhouse gases might
cause severe problems in decades
to come, Arrow said "the risks
have been greatly exaggerated."
'Biological bloodbath'
Even though nobody can say
how much warming there will be,
biologists are worried. Very
worried.
Like the Bay checkerspot but
terfly, many species are destined
for trouble if temperatures rise,
even with the conservative predic
tion of a 3 degree increase.
"Basically, life on earth is very
tuned into temperature," said Stu
Weiss, a researcher in the Biolog
ical Sciences Department. None
theless, he said species might be
able to recover from climate
change by moving to higher al
titudes or by moving north.
This is not always possible,
however, since migration might
be hindered by both natural and
man-made geographical features,
such as mountains, cities and
stretches of farmland. Also, other
geographical areas might not be
suitable for the species.
Species living in limited areas,
such as the Bay checkerspot, are
especially vulnerable to restricted
migration routes.
We might be in for a "biological
bloodbath," Weiss said.
Too little and too much
Other prophecies are just as
gloomy. Ocean levels may rise sig
nificantly from melting polar caps,
and send coastal dwellers running
to higher land. Houses now lo
cated securely away from the
tides, may stand perilously close
to the water in decades to come.
And forecasts indicate that coastal
cities may be made even more vul
nerable to hurricanes.

Droughts — such as the one
last summer — may hit the
United States with increasing fre
quency and increasing severity.
Scientists predict that climate
changes will wreak havoc with
crops that are unaccustomed to
warmer weather.
Increased public awareness
Scientists' dire predictions have
thrust the possibility of a climate
change into the public spotlight.
One of the scientists chiefly re
sponsible for moving Congress to
act on preventing global climate
change is James Hansen, a
climatologist at the NASA God
dard Institute for Space Studies

in New York City.
Hansen testified last July to the
Energy and Power subcommittee
of the House of Representatives
that the global climate change was
already upon us.
He pointed out the average tem
perature of the globe in 1988 was
the hottest in recorded history,
and the four hottest years this
century have all come this decade.
In his controversial testimony,
Hansen said he could state "with
about 99 percent confidence that
current temperatures represent a
real warming trend rather than
a chance fluctuation."
Though his testimony was
highly criticized by other experts,

Hansen and other outspoken sci
entists are responsible for bring
ing the subject to the public's
attention.
Confusion over policy
Just as scientists don't know
how greenhouse gases are going
to affect the earth, policy makers
don't know what should be done
about the potentially alarming
problem.
"There is no clear picture of
what should be done about it,"
Starr said.

U.S. initiatives without support
from other countries, however,
just won't cut it, Starr said. The
United States produces only about
25 percent of the world's carbon
dioxide, currently the most
prevalent greenhouse gas.
The problem is motivating
other nations to act, but chances
are, it won't be easy to reach in

For instance, the Soviet Union
might actually benefit from the
greenhouse effect, Biology Prof.
Hal Mooney said this weekend in
a panel discussion on climate
change at the "You Can Make a
Difference" conference. Warmer
and wetter weather, which some
models predict for the Soviet Un
ion, might be tremendously ben
eficial to agriculture in that
country.
Even Canada, known for its en
vironmental concern, might look
with disdain at any attempt to
slow the effect that some
Canadians think might turn their
country into the breadbasket of
the world.
"We may have a very interesting
international dialogue in the fu

ture," Mooney said.
Solutions or stall tactics?
To deal with global warming,
scientists are dreaming up exotic
schemes using Star Wars technol
ogy or gigantic umbrellas to
temper greenhouse effects.
More conventional schemes for

defense against global warming
are also being devised; working
for energy efficiency, decreased
reliance on fossil fuels for energy,
reforestation and many other
measures will help to slow the
greenhouse effect.
These measures will cut pro
duction of greenhouse gases, but

researchers question how long
these precautions can maintain
the reasonable levels of green
house gases.
"They buy you time," Mooney
said at the weekend conference.

Nobody knows if the Bay check
erspot butterfly will make it
through the next century.
The butterfly's survival
depends on whether it can adapt
to higher temperatures that
might be caused by the green
house effect, an atmospheric
buildup of carbon dioxide and
other heat-trapping gases. And
scientists are uncertain what this
local butterfly's chances of sur
vival are.
The uncertainty suggests the
major problem posed by the green
house effect. Many scientists
predict this global warming trend
will have devastating effects on
the weather, plant and animal life,
agriculture and coastal cities. But
they can't be sure.

"There's a lot we don't know,"
said Economics Prof, and Nobel
laureate Kenneth Arrow who has
been studying some implications
of the greenhouse effect.
Arrow said he questions any
model of the greenhouse effect
that makes definite predictions,
adding that more study of the
problem is necessary before ex
