# Chlamydia: hidden threat of infertility

Have you heard one of these
statements before? Have you
made one of these statements
before?

Like it or not, as many as
one in 10 individuals in some
sexually active populations
may be infected with the
sexually transmitted disease
known as chlamydia.
According to the American
Social Health Association,
chlamydia strikes between four
and five million Americans
each year, making it the most
common sexually transmitted
bacterial infection in the
United States. Herpes infec
tions and genital warts, both
caused by viruses, are currently
the most prevalent sexually
transmitted diseases.
However, chlamydia — pro
nounced kla-mid'-e-uh — fre
quently leads to much more
serious complications than the
viral infections, particularly in
women. Each year, chlamydial
infections cause as many as one
million cases of Pelvic Inflam
matory Disease in women,
which can lead to infertility and
possibly death.
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
left untreated can lead to in
flammation and permanent
scarring of the upper genital
tract, which includes the
uterus, fallopian tubes and
ovaries. The scarring and in
flammation can interfere with
fertilization of the egg, leading
to infertility.
If fertilization occurs, how

ever, scarring in the fallopian
tubes could block passage of a
fertilized egg to the uterus,
where implantation of the egg
normally occurs. Instead, im
plantation may happen in the
wall of the fallopian tube.
Fallopian tube implantation,
known as tubal pregnancy,
might ultimately lead to the
mother's death if not detected
early.
Chlamydia is a particulary
formidable opponent because
its presence often goes unrec
ognized. According to the Na
tional STD Hotline in Palo
Alto, as many as 40 percent of
men and 80 percent of women
infected show no symptoms of
disease at any given time. Many
people learn they have a
chlamydial infection only when
complications, sometimes per
manent, set in.
When apparent, symptoms
for women include abnormal
vaginal discharge, abdominal
pain, itching, tenderness and
burning upon urination. Men
experience similar symptoms,
including itching, tenderness in
the groin, swollen genitals and
burning upon urination.
Chlamydia and other
sexually transmitted infections
are best prevented by condom
use. Latex condoms with sper
micide used in conjunction
with another barrier method,
such as the diaphragm, sponge,
cervical cap or foam sper
micide, are the best possible
barrier protection.
Routine screening for
chlamydial infection is recom
mended for all sexually active
individuals under 25 years of
age and for anyone with mul
tiple sex partners-
