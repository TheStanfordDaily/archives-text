## Cardinal discolors No. 1 Rainbows by a shade 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
Forget about the Stanford men's basket
ball team's defeat of Arizona at Maples
Pavilion earlier this season. This one must
be the upset of the year.
In a shocker last night, the Stanford
men's volleyball team rallied from a two
game deficit against the No. 1-ranked
Hawaii Rainbow Warriors to pull off a
three-games-to-two victory: 7-15, 11-15,
15-10, 15-9, 15-13.
Men's Volleyball
Cardinal 3, Rainbows 2
Stanford rallied from a 10-13 deficit in
the fifth game to send the Rainbows to
their first Western Intercollegiate Volley
ball Association loss of the 1989 campaign.
To defeat Hawaii, the Cardinal had to
shut down the most potent offensive attack
in the country — the Rainbows' feared
threesome of Allen Allen, Carlos Briceno
and Brian Poppinga. And that's exactly
what Stanford did. Allen, Briceno, and Pop
pinga were all but neutralized in the last
three games.
The first game was in no way indicative
of the dramatics that were to follow; in
fact, it looked like a dreary replay of Mon
day night's match. The Rainbows
dominated the Cardinal in every phase of
play, en route to a 15-7 win. The Cardinal
looked lethargic and tight, just as it had
the previous night.
Game two started in a similar fashion.
Hawaii jumped out to a quick lead and
slowly built it up to an embarrassing 10-
point margin, 13-3.
However, at that point, Hawaii's
dominance of the match ended. The Car
dinal caught fire and managed to cut the
lead to 13-11. Despite the Cardinal's im
pressive run, Hawaii was able to regroup
and pull away to a 15-11 win.
Even though Stanford could not steal a
win in the second game, Stanford Coach
Fred Sturm pointed to the Cardinal rally
in game two as the turning point in the
match. "That comeback really gave us some
confidence," he said. "It enabled us to get
off to a quick start in game three."
The quick start to which Sturm was
referring was the 5-1 margin Stanford was
able to compile before the Rainbows could
get started in game three.
However, Hawaii finally regrouped and
went on a spurt of its own, running off
seven straight points to go up 8-5. Many
of the Cardinal faithful on hand at Maples
reluctantly began to gather up their belong
ings, sensing a three-game Rainbow sweep.

Unfortunately for the Rainbow Warriors,
though, the Cardinal players had no inten
tions of packing it in.
Stanford slowly caught up and pulled
ahead. Stanford's 14th point came on a
Mike Lowe smash. Then, on game point,
Hawaii was penalized for a net violation,
effectively handing the game over to the
Cardinal.
Stanford setter Parker Blackman, who
displayed a well-balanced repetoire of pre
cision sets and acrobatic dump shots be
tween blockers, commented on his team's
inspired play. "[Monday] night and even in
the first two games tonight, we just weren't
in a groove, weren't in a flow. Then, slowly,
things began to click."
Stanford Olympian Scott Fortune also
had some thoughts on his team's 24-hour
about-face. "In last night's match, we had
guys in new and different positions, trying
to fill in the holes that (Craig) Forsyth and
(Dan) Hanan left. That was tough; we
weren't playing together."
Certainly, the return of hitters Forsyth
and Hanan greatly enhanced the Cardinal's
hopes for a victory. Fortune, though, men
tioned another factor in the Stanford
charge. "Before the game, coach showed us
30 minutes of film from last night's game,"
he said. "Besides making us very mad, it
allowed us to see sortie of the formations
they hit out of. Facing them for the first
time, we had no idea how they attacked.
"But after seeing the film, we knew what
to look for. We were much better prepared."
As many of Hawaii's opponents have dis
covered, though, it takes a lot more than
good pregame preparation to beat the Rain
bow Warriors. The Cardinal knew this and
took a page out of the Rainbows' playbook,
putting on an exceptional defensive effort.
Hanan, Fortune, and Blackman combined
for a stunning 58 digs, effectively taking
the air out of Hawaii's hard-swinging hit
ters.
Offensively, the Cardinal had the hot
hands as well. Dan Hanan had 35 kills,
and Fortune piled up 34 of his own. In
addition, when the Rainbows were stalking
Hanan and Fortune down the stretch, soph
omore Mike Lowe came through with eight
kills of his own and a few key blocks of
Allen.
Indeed, the Cardinal contingent had more
than enough to excite them and the Rain
bow Warriors learned that playing in
Maples can be anything but pleasant for
Cardinal foes. After Monday night's game,
Rainbow Warrior Brian Poppinga intimated
that, of all of Hawaii's WIVA opponents,
he feared Stanford the most. Now, after
witnessing the Cardinal's comeback clinic,
Stanford and Hawaii fans alike know why
Poppinga feels the way he does.

they hit out of. Facing them for the first
time, we had no idea how they attacked.
"But after seeing the film, we knew what
to look for. We were much better prepared."
As many of Hawaii's opponents have dis
covered, though, it takes a lot more than
good pregame preparation to beat the Rain
bow Warriors. The Cardinal knew this and
took a page out of the Rainbows' playbook,
putting on an exceptional defensive effort.
Hanan, Fortune, and Blackman combined
for a stunning 58 digs, effectively taking
the air out of Hawaii's hard-swinging hit
ters.
Offensively, the Cardinal had the hot
hands as well. Dan Hanan had 35 kills,
and Fortune piled up 34 of his own. In
addition, when the Rainbows were stalking
Hanan and Fortune down the stretch, soph
omore Mike Lowe came through with eight
kills of his own and a few key blocks of
Allen.
Indeed, the Cardinal contingent had more
than enough to excite them and the Rain
bow Warriors learned that playing in
Maples can be anything but pleasant for
Cardinal foes. After Monday night's game,
Rainbow Warrior Brian Poppinga intimated
that, of all of Hawaii's WIVA opponents,
he feared Stanford the most. Now, after
witnessing the Cardinal's comeback clinic,
Stanford and Hawaii fans alike know why
Poppinga feels the way he does.

victory over the No. 1-ranked Hawaii Rainbows. Blackman signifi

Forget about the Stanford men's basket
ball team's defeat of Arizona at Maples
Pavilion earlier this season. This one must
be the upset of the year.
In a shocker last night, the Stanford
men's volleyball team rallied from a two
game deficit against the No. 1-ranked
Hawaii Rainbow Warriors to pull off a
three-games-to-two victory: 7-15, 11-15,
15-10, 15-9, 15-13.
Men's Volleyball
Cardinal 3, Rainbows 2
Stanford rallied from a 10-13 deficit in
the fifth game to send the Rainbows to
their first Western Intercollegiate Volley
ball Association loss of the 1989 campaign.
To defeat Hawaii, the Cardinal had to
shut down the most potent offensive attack
in the country — the Rainbows' feared
threesome of Allen Allen, Carlos Briceno
and Brian Poppinga. And that's exactly
what Stanford did. Allen, Briceno, and Pop
pinga were all but neutralized in the last
three games.
The first game was in no way indicative
of the dramatics that were to follow; in
fact, it looked like a dreary replay of Mon
day night's match. The Rainbows
dominated the Cardinal in every phase of
play, en route to a 15-7 win. The Cardinal
looked lethargic and tight, just as it had
the previous night.
Game two started in a similar fashion.
Hawaii jumped out to a quick lead and
slowly built it up to an embarrassing 10-
point margin, 13-3.
However, at that point, Hawaii's
dominance of the match ended. The Car
dinal caught fire and managed to cut the
lead to 13-11. Despite the Cardinal's im
pressive run, Hawaii was able to regroup
and pull away to a 15-11 win.
Even though Stanford could not steal a
win in the second game, Stanford Coach
Fred Sturm pointed to the Cardinal rally
in game two as the turning point in the
match. "That comeback really gave us some
confidence," he said. "It enabled us to get
off to a quick start in game three."
The quick start to which Sturm was
referring was the 5-1 margin Stanford was
able to compile before the Rainbows could
get started in game three.
However, Hawaii finally regrouped and
went on a spurt of its own, running off
seven straight points to go up 8-5. Many
of the Cardinal faithful on hand at Maples
reluctantly began to gather up their belong
ings, sensing a three-game Rainbow sweep.

Unfortunately for the Rainbow Warriors,
though, the Cardinal players had no inten
tions of packing it in.
Stanford slowly caught up and pulled
ahead. Stanford's 14th point came on a
Mike Lowe smash. Then, on game point,
Hawaii was penalized for a net violation,
effectively handing the game over to the
Cardinal.
Stanford setter Parker Blackman, who
displayed a well-balanced repetoire of pre
cision sets and acrobatic dump shots be
tween blockers, commented on his team's
inspired play. "[Monday] night and even in
the first two games tonight, we just weren't
in a groove, weren't in a flow. Then, slowly,
things began to click."
Stanford Olympian Scott Fortune also
had some thoughts on his team's 24-hour
about-face. "In last night's match, we had
guys in new and different positions, trying
to fill in the holes that (Craig) Forsyth and
(Dan) Hanan left. That was tough; we
weren't playing together."
Certainly, the return of hitters Forsyth
and Hanan greatly enhanced the Cardinal's
hopes for a victory. Fortune, though, men
tioned another factor in the Stanford
charge. "Before the game, coach showed us
30 minutes of film from last night's game,"
he said. "Besides making us very mad, it
allowed us to see sortie of the formations
they hit out of. Facing them for the first
time, we had no idea how they attacked.
"But after seeing the film, we knew what
to look for. We were much better prepared."
