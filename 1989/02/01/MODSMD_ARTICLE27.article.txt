# Hanan and Forsyth form a deadly duo
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Monday night, after Hawaii upended the Stanford
men's volleyball team in three games, middle blocker
Brian Poppinga noted that the Rainbow Warriors
were most afraid of two Cardinal hitters that did
not play: Dan Hanan and Craig Forsyth.
Their fears were well-founded.
Though Hanan sat out Monday's match with the
flu, neither he nor Forsyth looked the worse for
wear as the duo combined with Scott Fortune to
rebound from a two-games-to-none deficit and upset
the No. 1 team in the nation.
In the win, Hanan recorded an astounding triple
double — he earned game-high totals of 35 kills,
10 blocks and 21 digs. More significantly, the junior
All-American scored the match point, hitting a quick
middle set toward the right sideline with such speed
that the defender could only shank it into the crowd.
Without a doubt, Hanan made a difference.
"Dan has been our most consistent hitter through
out this season," Stanford Coach Fred Sturm said.
"It's a plus to have him on the court."
Forsyth made equally important contributions
even though they were not statistically as
noteworthy. After coming in toward the end of the
first game in place of freshman middle blocker Doug
Walquist, Forsyth killed the first ball he touched
and never stopped wounding the Rainbows.
It was his blocking that made the biggest impact.
On almost every play where he was eligible to block,
Forsyth put up a big obstacle for the Hawaii hitters.
Hanan and Fortune blocked for more scores, but
neither could duplicate the impact of Forsyth's read
blocking.
"The thing about Craig is that he's a great blocker,
and we needed to cover the net with his blocking,
Sturm said. "I think he came in and did a really
effective job with that."
With both Hanan and Forsyth in action, much
of the burden was lifted off Fortune. Monday, For
tune tried unsuccessfully to lift the Cardinal single
handedly, but the support of the junior middle block
ers greatly eased his task. With the pressure off
his shoulders and the opponent's focus diverted to
Hanan, Fortune reduced his hitting errors two-fold.
But it was the play of Hanan and Forsyth that
gave Stanford the needed boost. They provided the
extra ability, experience and inspiration that the
Cardinal desperately needed. With them, Stanford
is clearly one of the toughest teams in the country.
As the prophetic Poppinga observed the previous
evening, "Hanan and Forsyth were two guys that
we knew would be tough to stop. . . . When they
get them back, they'll be a different team."
So true.
