# Sports changes will improve The Daily's coverage of events
## 
### 
Out with the old, in with the new.
In an effort to better improve
our coverage of Stanford sports,
we've made some changes to the sports
page of late.
You've probably already noticed our
preview boxes alerting you to key
matchups and interesting stats for up
coming baseball and basketball (both
men's and women's) games.
They'll be continued (and will eventu
ally cover football next fall) and are joined
today their cousin the "mini-preview
box," as we call it. In the women's tennis
story, and in virtually all other sports
previews, we'll provide you with some
quick facts about the team's next contest.

These preview boxes were not intro
duced without reason. We brought them
into The Daily because we were un
satisfied with our preview stories. They
were often long-winded stat sheets that

weren't even particularly good at getting
across statistical information.
Now, the stats are easily located in the
previews boxes. Meanwhile, the stories
themselves are more like features. We've
focused on a particular player — a Stan
ford athlete like Howard Wright or an
opposing player like California's Leonard
Taylor — or chosen some interesting an
gle from which to look at the team.
Another change has been the addition
of more statistics in the form of what is
called agate in the newspaper business.
Things like basketball and baseball box
scores will be included with all stories
that report on the results of those teams'
contests.

With all the focus on statistics in sports
today, we're simply trying to provide
what you'd find in an ordinary paper.
For example, when time permits, we'll
run the long form of the basketball box
score, including everything from minutes
played to points scored.
In addition, with so many nationally
ranked teams, look for top-20 lists in
basketball, baseball, tennis and volleyball.
Another new feature is Sports Mailbag.
We received two letters last week and
ran them both. We'll run the mail every
week if you send us letters.
All of these additions come at a price,
however. We can't bring you preview
boxes, reader mail, box scores and the

like without cutting back in some areas.
That means some minor sports will be
covered in digest fashion — not unlike
the way Club Sports Roundup works.
Let me state emphatically, we will con
tinue to cover every varsity sporting event
as we do now. But, sometimes the preview
for a fencing match, or the results of a
crew meet, will be limited to fewer inches
of space.
Also, we're planning on installing a
Stanford sports hotline, like Sports
Phone, so you can call in on evenings
and weekends to get results-
