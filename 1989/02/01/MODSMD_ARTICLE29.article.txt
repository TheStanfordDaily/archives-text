## Ruggers hold off Davis Aggies for 17-15 win 
### Libby Feil Staff writer 
"Dramatic" was the word used
most frequently to describe last
Saturday's men's rugby game
against UC-Davis. Held here at

Stanford, the game was a tough
one. The score reflected the
game's closeness: the Cardinal
just managed to hold on to a
tenuous lead to win the match
17-15.
The Aggies, who are generally

considered to be one of the top
teams in the league, played well.
But despite Davis's advantages
in both weight and experience,
the Stanford team simply out
smarted their opponents. Brook
Olbrys, Will Wall and John

Fitzpatrick all had strong games
for Stanford. The Cardinal
started out strong, and the Davis
team was reduced to "playing
catch-up the whole time," com
mented club president Marty
Hartigan.
"It was a fantastic win for us,"
said Captain Bill Bradford, "be
cause they were really thinking
they were going to kill us."
Hartigan concurred, saying
that the game was "a big upset
for us." The victory was excep
tionally sweet since Davis had
just beaten Santa Clara, the
team which handed the Cardinal
a defeat in its first game of the
season. Stanford's success also
gives the players "a high note,"
according to Hartigan, to reflect
upon during their game next
Saturday at 1 p.m. at Maloney
Field against California, last
year's national champion.
