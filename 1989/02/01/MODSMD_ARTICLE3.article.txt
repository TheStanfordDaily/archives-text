# On the air: Kennedy dismisses CIV critics
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
In an interview on KZSU last night, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy struck back
at conservative critics of the Cultures, Ideas
and Values program and said "there just is
not much room for doubt" about the upcoming
retirement of Hoover Institution Director W.
Glenn Campbell.
Kennedy's comments were part of a wide
reaching discussion that included, among
other issues, cultural diversity on campus and
tightening of the University's budget.
Kennedy said an editorial about CIV that
appeared in The Wall Street Journal in De
cember was "certainly incorrect." Asst. Dean
Charles Junkerman responded to the editorial
with a letter, and last Thursday a letter writ
ten by Allan Bloom, author of "The Closing
of the American Mind," appeared.
"It's so wrong that it's silly," Kennedy said
of Bloom's letter. "Bloom indicates from be
ginning to end that he's more interested in
making an old point than in understanding
the situation."
Bloom's letter said that, with the CIV pro
gram, Stanford students will be indoctrinated
with "ephemeral ideologies" and will be taught
that "there are no permanent human ques
tions."
Kennedy said the University would not re

spond to the letter because "it displays so
much personal anger and distress that it's
almost self-indicting."
Kennedy also commented on the recent con
troversy surrounding Campbell's planned Au
gust retirement from Hoover. Kennedy said
the University's Board of Trustees and the
Executive Committee of Hoover's Board of
Overseers "share the understanding that in
August he steps down as director of the Hoo
ver Institution. Period."
In a KZSU interview last week, Campbell
said Kennedy "knew how to insult somebody"
because the president allegedly reduced Camp
bell's post-retirement salary by $25,000.
Kennedy said he has never insulted Camp
bell intentionally and that the salary arrange
ment was made by the Board of Trustees, not
him.

Asked about funding dangers facing the
Human Biology program, Kennedy said "We're
heading into a tough budget time. To say any
academic program is not jeopardized by a lack
of funding is to be a cockeyed optimist."
Last December, Provost James Rosse an
nounced the University faced an $11 million
budget shortfall, but he anticipated under
graduate programs would not be affected.
"We're all going to have to pull up our
socks a little bit and get the most out of the
dollars. Some programs are going to suffer a
little bit," Kennedy said, though he did not
elaborate.
Kennedy also discussed responses to his
statement on cultural diversity, titled "Reflec
tions on Racial Understanding," published last
month.
The paper was criticized by some for im
plying that the defacing of a poster at Ujamaa
House last October might involve free speech
issues.
"Inevitably, you find some collisions be
tween two different social values: the freedom
of members of minority groups and others
from hearing things offensive to them and
the freedom of people to express themselves
when that expression has unpleasant or con
troversial or unpopular aspects," Kennedy
said.

"Those are very difficult and
important propositions ... I ex
pressed some disappointment that
those issues hadn't come to the
top and been discussed as actively
as I thought they ought to be in
a place like this one," he added.
On the issue of multicultural
education, Kennedy said the ad
ministration has "identified it as
a prominent need" but that he
did .not support the creation of
special departments or programs
labeled Ethnic Studies.
"To put it in the mainstream
as part of other things we do in
which everybody is likely to par
ticipate is the more difficult, but
correct, way to do it,"he said.
