No doubles before NCAAs.
"That's fine with me," said
Stanford women's tennis Coach
Frank Brennan, when asked what
it would be like to go through the
season without his team ever play
ing a doubles match.
For the uninitiated in collegiate
tennis, the two teams match up
in six singles matches before mov
ing on to a trio of doubles clashes.
If one team captures five or six
of the singles matches, they score
enough points to assure victory
in the meet.
The other team is then given
the option of foregoing the dou
bles. It's an option that's exer
cised often.
Considering that Stanford
returns five Ail-Americans, and
adds two of the top freshmen in
the natibn, to a squad that has
already captured three straight
national titles, the "no doubles
before NCAAs" challenge may
very well be met by the Cardinal.
With the five AIl-Americans —
senior Fleni Rossides, junior Lisa
Green and sophomores Sandra
Birch, Tami Whitlinger and Teri
Whitlinger — top freshmen
Debbie Graham and Kylie
Johnson and senior captain Cindy
Buchsbaum, the Cardinal lineup
is certain to be loaded from top
to bottom.
"The only qualifier is our
health," Brennan said, noting that

the team has had health problems
in the past. Currently, Tami Whit
linger is nursing a strained wrist,
Rossides is recovering from an
ankle strain and Birch strained
her knee in a challenge match.
Brennan said the injuries were
"nothing mt\jor" and should be
out of the way soon. He was
nevertheless concerned that
should further injuries occur, the
team's position as an overwhelm
ing favorite would be less secure.
Still, Brennan acknowledged
that "we've never been as strong
one through six as we are this
year." Brennan noted that this in
cludes the 1984 NCAA champion
superteam comprised of stars like
Elise Burgin, Linda Gates and
Patty Fendick.
Though it would be impossible
at this point to pick a clear No.
