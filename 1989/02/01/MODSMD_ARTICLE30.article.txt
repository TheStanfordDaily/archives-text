# Women's tennis set to defend NCAA title

No doubles before NCAAs.
"That's fine with me," said
Stanford women's tennis Coach
Frank Brennan, when asked what
it would be like to go through the
season without his team ever play
ing a doubles match.
For the uninitiated in collegiate
tennis, the two teams match up
in six singles matches before mov
ing on to a trio of doubles clashes.
If one team captures five or six
of the singles matches, they score
enough points to assure victory
in the meet.
The other team is then given
the option of foregoing the dou
bles. It's an option that's exer
cised often.
Considering that Stanford
returns five Ail-Americans, and
adds two of the top freshmen in
the natibn, to a squad that has
already captured three straight
national titles, the "no doubles
before NCAAs" challenge may
very well be met by the Cardinal.
With the five AIl-Americans —
senior Fleni Rossides, junior Lisa
Green and sophomores Sandra
Birch, Tami Whitlinger and Teri
Whitlinger — top freshmen
Debbie Graham and Kylie
Johnson and senior captain Cindy
Buchsbaum, the Cardinal lineup
is certain to be loaded from top
to bottom.
"The only qualifier is our
health," Brennan said, noting that

and Valerie Wilson.

the team has had health problems
in the past. Currently, Tami Whit
linger is nursing a strained wrist,
Rossides is recovering from an
ankle strain and Birch strained
her knee in a challenge match.
Brennan said the injuries were
"nothing mt\jor" and should be
out of the way soon. He was
nevertheless concerned that
should further injuries occur, the
team's position as an overwhelm
ing favorite would be less secure.
Still, Brennan acknowledged
that "we've never been as strong
one through six as we are this
year." Brennan noted that this in
cludes the 1984 NCAA champion
superteam comprised of stars like
Elise Burgin, Linda Gates and
Patty Fendick.
Though it would be impossible
at this point to pick a clear No.
1 player from this year's squad,
consider the credentials of some
of the leading contenders (in al
phabetical order):
• Birch is ranked No. 3 in the
nation in the preseason. She is a
member of the U.S. national team
and finished the 1988 season with
a 33-9 record. Over the summer,
she and Graham won two .profes
sional doubles tournaments.
• Graliam was the top-ranked
high school player in the country
last year. Also a national team
member, Graham possesses a
strong serve-and-volley game.
• Green has been a semi-finalist
in NCAA singles twice. Last year's
Pacific 10 Conference singles
champion, Green is ranked No. 5
in the preseason and was 43-11
last year.
• Rossides has been plagued by
injuries throughout her career but
has been devastating when
healthy. A great competitor, Ros
sides came off her injuries to
record four key wins for the Car
dinal at the NCAAs last year.
• Tami Whitlinger played No. 1
for the Cardinal last year and re
corded a 20-2 dual-meet record

en route to a 38-6 overall mark.
She has beaten ex-Florida stars
Halle Cioffi and Shaun Stafford
— both of whom are now on the
pro circuit — and is ranked one
notch ahead of Birch at No. 2 in
the nation.
• Teri Whitlinger, Tami's twin
sister, recorded a 42-8 mark last
year and was 25-3 in duals.
Ranked No. 10, Brennan said she
is "possibly the best athlete on
the team."
It's enough to make your head
spin, especially if you're an op
posing coach.
For Brennan, winner of five
NCAA titles in the last seven
years, it's business as usual.
•
Card notes
Brennan said challenge matches will
continue for the next couple of weeks
in order to sort out the lineup.
After today's opener at University
of the Pacific, Brennan noted that
the matches will get progressively
more difficult in the coming weeks.
The team opens its home schedule
at the new and improved Stanford
Tennis Stadium tomorrow against
Utah. The stadium will be dedicated
this Saturday in an event sponsored
by Apple Computer.

Card notes
Brennan said challenge matches will
continue for the next couple of weeks
in order to sort out the lineup.
After today's opener at University
of the Pacific, Brennan noted that
the matches will get progressively
more difficult in the coming weeks.
The team opens its home schedule
at the new and improved Stanford
Tennis Stadium tomorrow against
Utah. The stadium will be dedicated

No doubles before NCAAs.
"That's fine with me," said
Stanford women's tennis Coach
Frank Brennan, when asked what
it would be like to go through the
season without his team ever play
ing a doubles match.
For the uninitiated in collegiate
tennis, the two teams match up
in six singles matches before mov
ing on to a trio of doubles clashes.
If one team captures five or six
of the singles matches, they score
enough points to assure victory
in the meet.
The other team is then given
the option of foregoing the dou
bles. It's an option that's exer
cised often.
Considering that Stanford
returns five Ail-Americans, and
adds two of the top freshmen in
the natibn, to a squad that has
already captured three straight
national titles, the "no doubles
before NCAAs" challenge may
very well be met by the Cardinal.
With the five AIl-Americans —
senior Fleni Rossides, junior Lisa
Green and sophomores Sandra
Birch, Tami Whitlinger and Teri
Whitlinger — top freshmen
Debbie Graham and Kylie
Johnson and senior captain Cindy
Buchsbaum, the Cardinal lineup
is certain to be loaded from top
to bottom.
"The only qualifier is our
health," Brennan said, noting that

the team has had health problems
in the past. Currently, Tami Whit
linger is nursing a strained wrist,
Rossides is recovering from an
ankle strain and Birch strained
her knee in a challenge match.
Brennan said the injuries were
"nothing mt\jor" and should be
out of the way soon. He was
nevertheless concerned that
should further injuries occur, the
team's position as an overwhelm
ing favorite would be less secure.
Still, Brennan acknowledged
that "we've never been as strong
one through six as we are this
year." Brennan noted that this in
cludes the 1984 NCAA champion
superteam comprised of stars like
Elise Burgin, Linda Gates and
Patty Fendick.
Though it would be impossible
at this point to pick a clear No.
1 player from this year's squad,
consider the credentials of some
of the leading contenders (in al
phabetical order):
• Birch is ranked No. 3 in the
nation in the preseason. She is a
member of the U.S. national team
and finished the 1988 season with
a 33-9 record. Over the summer,
she and Graham won two .profes
sional doubles tournaments.
• Graliam was the top-ranked
high school player in the country
last year. Also a national team
member, Graham possesses a
strong serve-and-volley game.
• Green has been a semi-finalist
in NCAA singles twice. Last year's
Pacific 10 Conference singles
champion, Green is ranked No. 5
in the preseason and was 43-11
last year.
• Rossides has been plagued by
injuries throughout her career but
has been devastating when
healthy. A great competitor, Ros
sides came off her injuries to
record four key wins for the Car
dinal at the NCAAs last year.
• Tami Whitlinger played No. 1
for the Cardinal last year and re
corded a 20-2 dual-meet record

en route to a 38-6 overall mark.

Halle Cioffi and Shaun Stafford
