Stanford reached new heights
in The Associated Press women's
basketball poll when the Cardinal,
15-2, jumped two spots to fourth.
"It's really scary, because I
know all the things we're not
doing," Coach Tara VanDerveer
said Monday. "But it's also very
exciting, especially for our
younger players, because of where
we were four years ago and how
far we've come."
Nine of the first 10 from last
week's poll were still on the upper
half of the list, with unbeaten
Auburn, Tennessee and Louisiana
Tech continuing to have a firm
grip on the top three positions.
Auburn, 19-0, again was a
unanimous choice for the top spot
with 63 first-place votes and 1,260
points from a nationwide panel of
women's coaches.
