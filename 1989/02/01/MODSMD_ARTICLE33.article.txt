# Ethics of lab animal research
## Abusing the inequities of nature?' 
### Maryellen Driscoll Staff writer 
Supporters of animal rights and
those defending the use of animals
in research debated their different
ethical stands in a panel last
night.
Before a crowd of about 50 local
residents and students at Okada
House, Nedim Buyukmihci, doc
tor of veterinary medicine at UC-
Davis said, "We (supporters of an
imal rights) are for the benefit of
all health if it can be done in an
ethical way ... to help, not to
harm."
Buyukmihci, who was involved
in animal research for 11 years,
said he is not opposed to the use
of animals in medical research but
added that he is concerned when
animals suffer needlessly.
Buyukmihci said, "What is
most arbitrary in nature is the
inequities of power." According to
him, the belief that animals are
"weaker" than humans does not
justify harmful treatment of
animals in medical research.
Fellow animal rights supporter
Stephen Sapontzis, professor of
philosophy at California State
University at Hayward, described
the concern for animal suffering

'It is incomplete to
stop now. When
we really under
stand how the bio
logical system
works, we won't
need to use
animals anymore.'

as a "revolutionary idea" of the
19th and 20th centuries.
Sapontzis said that those in fa
vor of animal rights are calling
not only for kind but for fair treat
ment of animals as well. He
defined animals as "all beings that
are capable of feeling pleasure or
pain."
Defenders of animal research
contended that such work is nec
essary to benefit human health.
"It is incomplete to stop now.
When we really understand how
the biological system works, we
won't need to use animals any

more," said Michael Endicott, ex
ecutive director of Citizens for
Life, Education and Research. He
said that using animals in medical
research in ways that may cause
them to suffer is necessary be
cause the work benefits human
health.
Laure Esserman, a doctor at
the Stanford Medical Center who
is currently involved in cancer re
search, added, "Medicine has
come a long way, however, we
have a long way to go."
Although Esserman said she
does not like "hurting animals,"
she said she also believes in med
ical advancement.
"I know that many people feel
that research is duplicative, but
that is the nature of the beast,"
she said.
"It just has to be put into per
spective with what we do in our
daily lives," she said, referring to
such common activities as the
eradication of rats in cities or put
ting dogs to sleep in animal
pounds.
The discussion was sponsored
by the students of last fall's In
novative Academic Courses class,
"Animal Rights or Wrongs?"
