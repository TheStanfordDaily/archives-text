# Students to propose environmental house
## 
### Nathanael Cousins Staff writer 
Fueled by last weekend's "You
Can Make a Difference" confer
ence, a group of concerned Stan
ford undergraduates will submit
a proposal for an environmental
appreciation focus house to the
University tomorrow.
"Environmental awareness at
Stanford hasn't been ignored, but
it hasn't been addressed in a
direct way," said freshman Peter
Murray, who originated the idea
for an environmental focus house.
"The 'You Can Make a Differ
ence' conference was a tremen
dous success. The environmental
appreciation house could be a per
manent facility organized on the
same goals," Murray said.
Murray and sophomore Ashley
Lodato head a group of students
petitioning Residential Education
to include an environmental focus
house in the Draw this spring.
They will present the proposal,
already endorsed by five depart
ments, to Alice Supton, associate
dean of Residential Atfiurspibr

review. Supton was unavailable
for comment last night.
The written proposal details the
need and purpose of the focus
house, and cites faculty and stu
dent support that has been
growing since last quarter.
"My feeling is that Res Ed is
encouraging the establishment of
focus houses," said Murray, a res
ident in Toyon Hall. "I think it
will depend on how much student
support we can roust up."
"The environmental apprecia
tion house will be number one on
my Draw list," said freshman
Bruce Wooster, also a Toyon res
ident. "It's one thing to talk or
read about the environment, but
it's totally different to live in an
environmentally aware lifestyle,
especially today in America. The
solutions stem from lifestyle
changes."
In Murray's eyes, 35-60 stu
dents interested in learning more
about the environment will reside
in the environmental focus house.
The house will cultivate dialogue
