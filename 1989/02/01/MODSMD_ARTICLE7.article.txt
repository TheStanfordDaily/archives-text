# Sorority Rush rules may be tightened
## 
### DJ Berinstein Staff writer 
Following the trend toward self
policing within Stanford's Greek
system, the Intersorority Council
proposed a new Rush policy yes
terday designed to crack down on
sororities that use unfair recruit
ing tactics.
The ISC also proposed a budget
ceiling for Rush parties. Em
phasizing that the proposals were
preliminary, ISC President Tina
Niu said, "We will be cracking
down much more this year than
we did last year, but these pro
posals are far from what we will
end up doing."
"Dirty rush," a recurrent prob
lem especially over the past three
years, occurs when a prospective
rushee is recruited by sorority
members outside of a Rush con
text or before the actual selection
process begins.
The exact definition of dirty
rush has been "too vague," ac
cording to ISC Secretary Kathy
Chen. The difficulty of enforcing
the loose guidelines led the ISC
to discuss firmer approaches to
deal with violations.
Both proposals are part of the
ISC's enhanced effort to make

this year's spring Rush "the best
Stanford has ever had," said ISC
Rush Chair Sonja Nagy.
Seven Stanford sororities par
ticipate in the week-long formal
Rush activities that occur spring
quarter. Twenty-one percent of
Stanford women are sorority
members.
Several alumni sorority ad
visers were present at the ISC
meeting and expressed concern
about the penalties involved.
"They were concerned because we
might hurt the future size of the
Greek system," Chen said.
The budget ceiling was pro
posed in an effort to equalize the
amount of money spent by each
sorority on Rush parties. Accord
ing to Nagy, the ISC is considering
equalizing the maximum amount
of money spent on parties to allow
rushees to see each sorority in
the same light.
Currently, each sorority is ex
pected not to exceed a $800 limit
on Rush. Nagy added that the
policy has not been strictly en
forced in the past.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano said "not a lot of docu
mented incidents (of dirty rush)
have been reported, but there
have been more instances than
have been completely detected and
punished," over the last three
years.
Pisano cited one case last year
in which "allegations flew"
against a sorority, but no punish
ment resulted.
The proposed penalties include:
social probation for one quarter
and a $100 fine per rushee in
volved for' a first violation; a re
duction of the next year's pledge
class by 10 members and a $100
fine per rushee involved for a sec
ond violation; and an exclusion
from Rush the following year for
a third violation.
The proposals were submitted

to Pisano; however the ISC has
not approved them and will dis
cuss the issues next Wednesday.
"I am confident that the (pro
posed) penalties will be dramati
cally changed," said Tri Delta
President Lisa Hellmann.
Pisano said he thought the
Rush chairs were well organized
and that they had made proposals
for "serious penalties" that would
be easier to enforce than in the
past. He acknowledged that "the
problem of defintion of terms"
needs to be addressed.
In the past, the penalty for a
Rush infraction was $100 — in
dependent of the number of rus
hees involved.
"The old rules were ineffective
because a money deterrent was
not enough," said Chen. The pun
ishment "should affect the group,
not just its finances."
