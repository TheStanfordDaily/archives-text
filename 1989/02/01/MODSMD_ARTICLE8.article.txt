# Pisano accepts IFC probation decision

### DJ Berinstein Staff writer 
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano yesterday accepted the
first recommendation of the In
terfraternity Council's newly
created judiciary board and placed
Sigma Chi Fraternity on one
month probation for circulating a
flier depicting alcohol.
Although the judiciary board's
decision differed from Pisano's
original recommendation, Pisano
said he was comfortable in accept
ing the board's decision because
the "process was so thorough and
the notes from the meeting were
quite detailed."
Pisano, acting for the Univer
sity, originally had said he would
place the Sigma Chi fraternity on
a three-week social suspension.
Under the judiciary board's
ruling, the Sigma Chis will be al
lowed to have parties, but the par
ties will be closely monitored.
In addition to the one-month
social probation, the board's sanc
tions against Sigma Chi also stip
ulate that the fraternity members
must educate other fraternities
about the IFC party guidelines
and flier policy.
"The (board's) recommendation
was designed to be beneficial, not
just punitive," Pisano said. "Not
all groups know the University
policy (so from the Sigma Chi ef
forts) the IFC will get educational
mileage from the entire process."
Pisano added that he recon
sidered his original ruling because
the IFC recognized the difference
between a flier violation and a
party violation.

The IFC judiciary board ruled
unanimously Monday night that
the Sigma Chi Fraternity did vi
olate IFC party guidelines that
prohibit "the mention or depic
tion" of alcohol on party fliers.
However, the board decided
that the party itself did not violate
IFC rules. The board listened to
accounts of witnesses who had at
tended the party and heard tes
timony from Sigma Chi president
Marty Hartigan, IFC representa
tive Mike Colglazier and social
chair Rob Milhalko to determine
that the actual Sigma Chi "Beach
Party" was not alcohol centered.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said he was pleased with
the creation of a judiciary board
and the results of its first test
case.
"I think it's a great idea for
the IFC to take responsibility, col
lectively," he said. "They made a
good decision and (took) a reason
able stab at trying to get some
clarity on the (University) policy."
Lyons said he did not nec
cesarily look at the "harshness"
of the decision, but whether it
would have a good effect on the
system as a whole. "In a way,
probation is a lot harder (than
suspension) â€” they must educate
the entire system. It's a lot more
work than they realize.
"It will be interesting to see
how closely the Sigma Chis stay
in touch," Pisano said. "I have
confidence that they will, and that
they will do well (on probation).
Sigma Chi is a responsible frater
nity and they have a good track
record with the exeption of the
flier."
