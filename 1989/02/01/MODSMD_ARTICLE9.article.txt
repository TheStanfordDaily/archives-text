# Frosh applications drop 6 percent
## 
### Eric Young Editorial staff 
The Office of Undergraduate
Admissions yesterday released
figures showing an approximate
six percent drop in the number
of applications for next year's
freshmen class.
Dean of Undergraduate Ad
missions Jean Fetter, said
"We've expected (the drop] for
years." Her office does not think
the lower number of applica
tions — a drop to 14,869 from
15,828 — portends a future
problem.
Indeed, she expects the appli
cations from high school hope
fuls to decrease until 1992 due
to a smaller number of high
school seniors nationwide.
Other factors that could cause
a smaller number of applicants
are the high costs of applying
to college or a reduction in the
number of applications each stu
dent completes.
But, Fetter said that her of
fice cannot yet determine the
specific causes because they are
only in the second week of
reading applications and do not

have enough statistics.
The reading will continue un
til early April.
Stanford is not the only col
lege to experience a drop in ap
plications. Fetter said she has
seen reports from several other
institutions in similar situa
tions.
Since 1984, the total number
of actionable applications —

those with all required materi
als, such as SAT scores and let
ters of recommendation — has
fluctuated between 13,000 and
14,750.
Last year, the University
changed its admissions process
from a two-stage to a one-stage
step. And the drop in actionable
applications turned out to be
less than 1 percent
