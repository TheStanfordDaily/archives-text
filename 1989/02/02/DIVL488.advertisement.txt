Precisely
Positioned
for your
Career
Grow with Trimble Navigation, the leader in the GPS navigation
equipment. You could plan now for your future as a member of
an elite team who will add to Trimble's expansion by developing
and marketing navigation equipment to large industrial, military,
and government organizations. We are looking for hardware and
software engineers with MSEE or PhD degrees. These engineers
will be part of small two to three person teams working on next
generation products and technologies.
Software Engineers
We have needs for engineers with knowledge of either user inter
face or signal processing software. These programs are written in
both C and Pascal, and run on microprocessors like 6809's or
68000's. These applications require both knowledge and
creativity.
Hardware Engineers
We seek expertise in both digital and RF hardware. Digital design
with microprocessor-based systems is needed that will eventually
be integrated into large CMOS gate arrays. In the RF area, we
need creative solutions for next generation satellite receivers. This
includes mixers, IF's, low noise preamps, and oscillators.
If you have expertise in any of these areas, and would like to
work in a fast growing, small company environment, we can offer
a challenging opportunity with a hard working team where your
contribution will be recognized and rewarded.
We will be interviewing on campus on Tuesday, February 7.
If you miss us, please send your resume to: Trimble Navigation,
Dept. SU, P.O. Box 3642, Sunnyvale, CA 94088-3642. We are
an equal opportunity employer.
