One-in-a-million patient
Ronald Bennett, who tripped in a
construction site parking lot Tuesday,
became Stanford University Hospi
tal's one millionth patient. But the
care in the facility's Prompt Care unit
was so fast, the patient was gone
before anyone could tell him his med
ical record number was 1,000,000.
"That's sort of terrific in a weird
way," said Bennftt, 37, after he
learned in a phone call several hours
later that he'd readied the benchmark
number that took the institution since
1959 to achieve.
Bennett, general manager of E&S
Masonry in Castro Valley, was taken
to the hospital's Prompt Care facility
from a campus construction site just
before noon. Attending physician Dr.
Gordon Kaplan didn't know Bennett
was the millionth patient when he
taped up the man's sprained ankle,
but the physician did recall that Ben
nett was worried he'd have to give up
jogging for a few weeks.

By the time department business
manager Mark James came running
out of his office to tell the hospital
staff that they'd treated patient one
million, Bennett, who had spent about
an hour in the hospital, had already
left to drive himself back to Castro
Valley.

Dial T for any area code
Starting Saturday, Pacific Bell will
require customers to dial a " 1" before
the area code on all calls placed from
Stanford to U.S. locations outside the
415 area code.
For example, to place a call to a
location in the 408 area code, dial
1-408 and the seven-digit phone num
ber.
All automatic dialing, such as speed
dialing features or modern automatic
dialers, must be reprogrammed to in
clude the "1" before the area code for

any out-of-area telephone numbers.
Those with questions about this
change or other dialing procedures
should call the Communication Serv
ices Client Help Line at 5-HELP.
