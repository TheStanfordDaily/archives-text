## Shamir offers peace plan Palestinian leaders reject Israeli solution to conflict 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) - Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir yester
day offered to withdraw soldiers
from some cities in the occupied
lands if Palestinians agree to lim
ited autonomy as an interim so
lution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Palestinian leaders rejected the
idea, saying they would settle for
nothing less than a Palestinian
state.
It was Shamir's most con
ciliatory remark yet on Israel's
future role in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
"Compared to his old stand, he
has moved a step, but it is a far
step from meeting the demands
or conditions of the Palestinian
people. We can't accept it," said
Faisal Husseini, considered the
top pro-PLO leader in the occu
pied lands.
Also yesterday, 10 Arab teen
agers were wounded in clashes
with troops in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, including a 13-vear
old boy shot in the head with a
rubber bullet, Arab hospital offi
cials said. The army confirmed
five wounded.
In the West Bank town of
Hebron, a firebomb was hurled
at a religious seminary for Jewish
settlers. A second firebomb was

thrown at the troops that arrived
to conduct searches, settlers said.
There were no injuries or damage.
Shamir presented his idea to
reporters after speaking to a
group of North American rabbis.
"The peace process will be com
prised of two stages," he said.
"First an interim condition and
this will include full autonomy.
In the second stage (there will be)
direct negotiations without
preconditions between Israel, Pal
estinian Arabs and Arab coun
tries."
"At a certain stage when there
is autonomy, the army will leave
several urban centers and be fo
cused in some other areas," he
said.
The withdrawal of Israeli troops
from populated areas into security
pockets in the occupied territories
is outlined in the 1978 Camp Da
vid accords between Egypt and
Israel, but Shamir has never spe
cifically endorsed such a troop
movement.
Although Shamir spoke of "full
autonomy", the accords say Israel
would still handle the terrorities'
external and internal security and
foreign affairs.
The Camp David accords call
for electing local Palestinians to

participate in peace talks with Is
rael, Jordan and Egypt. A five
year period of autonomy would
precede negotiations on the final
status of the territories.
The Palestine Liberation Or
ganization and many Palestinians
reject autonomy and the Camp
David plan, saying these ideas are
intended to sidestep the PLO and
cheat the Palestinians out of a
state.
"Autonomy as proposed by Is
rael is totally rejected," said Beth
lehem Mayor Elias Freij, respond
ing to Shamir's latest offer.
"Israel has to understand that
we want a comprehensive peace
settlement that will ultimately
achieve our sovereignty over the
West Bank and Gaza Strip," he
said.
Shamir told the rabbis he would
never meet with the PLO and crit
icized Western nations for giving
credibility to PLO chief Yasser
Arafat's statements in December
recognizing Israel and renouncing
terrorism.
"Our rights are questioned as
we witness a large part of the
world dancing at the PLO-Arafat
festival, which has blinded them
to reality and made them victims
of delusions and deceptions."
