BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) â€”
The navy said yesterday the sinking of
one of its supply ships in the Antarctic
did not result in a mayor oil spill or an
ecological disaster in the pristine envi
ronment.
Some environmentalists said the acci
dent left a 10-mile oil slick and that
wildlife was already dying Others said
it was too early to say how much oil
spilled and how much damage was done
to the region and its animals.
"There could be a small stain" from

the release of oil in the engine room of
the Bahia Paraiso, a navy spokesman
said. "Anything else, no."
The vessel, which carried tourists as
well as fuel for several polar stations, hit
a rock Saturday, was evacuated and listed
for three days before sinking in high
winds and heavy seas late Tuesday night.
No one was injured.
The incident occurred in the Bismarck
Strait 600 miles south of Cape Horn on
the tip of South America and within two
miles of the U.S. Palmer Research Sta

tion, where the ship's 300 tourists and
crew initially were taken.
The U.S. National Science Foundation
said the vessel carried 250,000 gallons of
diesel fuel and that an "incurable disas
ter" would result if all the fuel leaked
into the unspoiled waters in the region.
A spokesman at the research station
who requested anonymity said in a tele
phone interview that leaking oil had
caused a 10-mile slick.
Officials at the foundation, the U.S.
base and Greenpeace said leaking fuel

already has killed some krill, a shrimp
like crustacean that is the main food of
the baleen whale and a vital part of the
Antarctic food chain.
"The ship rolled over, is lying on its
side almost fully below the water," Peter
Wilkniss, director of the foundation's An
tarctic program, told ABC's Good Morn
ing America yesterday.
"This is a very enclosed area. It's a
bay bounded by a glacier and some islands
and our (research) station. So if the oil
goes into the area then it will have an

effect on the shoreline, on the ice, on the
animals, the organisms, on the sedi
ments," he told ABC.
The depth of the water was not known.
Neverthess, it remained unclear yes
terday how much oil hud spilled, and the
extent of any ecological damage.
On Tuesday, the government news
agtfricy Telam said the fuel the ship
carhed was contained in individual steel
drums. The news agency quoted a navy
source as saying "a spill is practically
impossible."
