Dali died of heart failure Jan. 23 in his home
town of Figueras at the age of 84. Media reports
have indicated the estate is worth about $87.7

Spanish people and assumes with full responsi

bility the obligations that derive from this legacy,
in particular the requirement to 'conserve, make
known and protect his works of art."'
