# Syria, Libya accused in jet crash
## Unnamed sources blame them for Flight 103 bombing

WASHINGTON (AP) - Syria
and Libya were responsible for
the bombing of a Pam Am jumbo
jetliner which crashed in Scotland
on Dec. 21 and killed 270 people,
CBS News reported yesterday.
Quoting unnamed sources, the
network said the destruction of
Flight 103 was in retaliation for
the U.S. bombing of Libya in
1986, but was also spurred by the
U.S. decision in December to talk
with the Palestine Liberaton Or
ganization.
The principle architect of the
bombing was Ahmed Jibril, head
of the extreme Palestinian Terror
Group, a front for the Liberation

of the Palestine-General Com
mand, according to CBS.
Jibril, based in Syria, was work
ing for Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi, although he was also re
quired to clear the operation with
Syrian intelligence officials, the
network reported.
The bombing was planned to
revenge the U.S. bombing raid on
Libya in 1986, the network said,
and was also designed to under
mine the U.S.-PLO talks.
Gadhafi sent a distant cousin,
Sayed Gaddafidam, to Jibril, who
is known to hate the United
States, CBS said. Three years ago,
Jibril told a news conference in

Libya: "There will be no safety
for any traveler on an Israeli or
U.S. airliner."
Jibril, a former officer in Syrian
military intelligence, cleared the
operation for an American target
with Syrian intelligence and, with
full backing of the Libyan secret
service, moved to Frankfurt, West
Germany, and made the Pan Am
plane his target, CBS said.
The network quoted Omar
Shehabi, a Jabril spokesman, as
saying through an interpreter, "I
tell you that we didn't do it and
we are not involved. We don't
practice terrorism and we con
demn such actions."
