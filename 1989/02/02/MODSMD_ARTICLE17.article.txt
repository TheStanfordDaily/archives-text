## New dorms in 199_? 
### 
University should not
base housing promises
on unrealistic prospects

DONORS TO THE Centen
nial Campaign must have
been blessed with comfort
able housing for their four years
as undergraduates. Or else they
don't remember the frustration
of paying through the teeth to
live in tin can trailers or in small
rooms far from classes and class
mates.
With only three years of
guaranteed housing and decrepit
Manzanita Park still standing,
Stanford allows unacceptable
housing to serve as undergradu
ate residences.
For several months now stu
dents have been led to believe
this would change by 1992. But
Tuesday the University "an
nounced a delay in the
groundbreaking because of fruit
less campaign fundraising ef
forts. Manzanita will keep stand
ing until at least 1995.
Rather than raise students'
hopes and then disappoint them,
the University could have pre
dicted this delay in the fall. The
earlier date was an unfounded
hope that should not have been
given such credence.
Keith Guy, director of Housing
and University Food Service, said
his office was "excited" by the
idea of receiving housing money
as a gift. With the $12 million,
he said "We could have borrowed
the rest."
But the University exhibited
wishful thinking when it bar
gained on $12 million from cam
paign contributions to go for un
dergraduate housing.

Philanthropists notoriously
avoid funding buildings, particu
larly student residences. And the
history of Stanford's record
breaking Centennial Campaign
only confirms this.
According to Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Norm Robinson,
the most recently estimated
timetable mirrors the original
pre-campaign schedule antici
pated for the next phase of
housing development.
And Assoc. Campaign Director
Richard Bennett said Tuesday, "I
don't think we'll find any donors
for this."
Indeed, Robinson admitted yes
terday that his office was "as
tounded" that the campaign had
targeted money for undergradu
ate housing in the first place.
Contributors shy away from
donating buildings because they
know universities can eventually
borrow the money and pay off
the debt through room rates.
Nonetheless, the University
must wait seven to eight years
between housing projects before
it can finance more debt. Other
wise room rates rise dramatically
to pay for the building.
On the heels of the Rains
Houses completion, this would
have meant the next project could
begin in 1994 or 1995 â€” as it will.
Homework and intellectual
dialogue do not take place outside
on the grass or on scooter rides
between Palo Alto and the Quad.
Housing is integral to learning
at Stanford.
Perhaps if donors knew that
by contributing funds earmarked
for the construction of under
graduate housing they were con
tributing significantly to the ac
ademic experience of several
years' worth of Stanford stu
dents, they'd start sending in the
money.
