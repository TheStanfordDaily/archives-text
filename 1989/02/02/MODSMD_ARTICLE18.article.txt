## Sexism, not just alcohol, is a problem at fraternities 
### 
Riding through white Plaza
last week, I had to brake to
avoid hitting a dozen or so
Playboy bunnies. These bunnies were
fraternity pledges, attired in an array
of bikini bottoms, overstuffed bikini
tops, and of course, bunny ears, pass
ing out invitations to a party.
Sadly, such a sight did not even
surprise me. It is a cliche of objec
tification and dehumanization, as
insulting to the creativity and intelli
gence of its perpetrators as it is to its
recipients.
Also sad is the fact that I was not
surprised by the reaction to such a
sight, or rather, by the lack of reac-

tion. The bunnies were greeted with
laughter. I imagined a similar situation
— one in which a group of white
students, dressed as black slaves, stood
in White Plaza, passing out invitations
to a party.
Anyone who has spent time on this
campus recently need not stretch the
power of imagination very far to con
ceive of the reaction that would result
from such a display. Racism on this
campus is finally being met with the
outrage that it deserves. Why then,
does sexism remain sacred?
When frat boys dress up as symbols
of pornography, they are paying
homage to an age-old, socially accepted

institution of enslavement. One must
ask what the motives behind such a
display are. To be most generous to
these boys — generosity which perhaps
they do not deserve — they were
motivated by what they considered to
be harmless humor.
Why do they not realize that
degradation of other human beings is
simply not funny? Either they do not
care whom they offend, or they are so
insensitive that they do not realize
that the images they evoke might
offend anyone.
I was treated to this display one day
after having read in The Daily that
another fraternity was being disciplined

for fliers that they had distributed
around campus. These fliers publicized
an upcoming party on the basis of the
drinks that would be served at it, and
thus were said to center around alco
hol. The images depicted on the fliers
consisted of four kinds of alcoholic
iced-tea drinks and one non-alcoholic.
I venture the opinion that the
images evoked by the bunnies in White
Plaza are infinitely more dangerous
than those evoked by this overwhelm
ing tea-to-tea ratio.
Perhaps these images deserve some
attention.
