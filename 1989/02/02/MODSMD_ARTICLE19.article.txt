# Prejudice causes racial division
## 
### 
I am writing to respond to Telford
Work's Jan. 13 letter. It is absurd to
assert that students have become ra
cially polarized as a result of the "con
stant theme of racism on campus." It
is prejudice, not the "constant theme
of racism," or any other "theme,"
which causes individuals to fear people
who are different from them.
Work insists that one cause of racial
polarization is that many students of
color come from racially homogeneous
environments. Furthermore, "when
they first came to Stanford, they were
understandably uncomfortable with the
idea of having to assimilate."
1 disagree with Work on at least
three points. First, why does the re
sponsibility always seem to rest on
people of color to fit into the system
and to improve race relations?
Second, he insinuates that students
of color, coming from homogeneous
environments, do not know how to

interact with white students. Could not
a similar criticism be made of white
students, since many of them come
from predominantly white environ
ments?
Third, why does he assume that
people of color "have to assimilate"?
Since he obviously considers himself
enlightened, should he not be aware
that our goal is not to becomc cultural
clones of one another? Our ultimate
objective must be to create an environ
ment in which people of different races
and cultures accept each other and
appreciate each other's differences.
Why overemphasize the role of stu
dents' perceptions of racism? In con
temporary United States society race,
class and gender determine an individ
ual's opportunities and life chances to
a significantly greater degree than do
one's ideas and values. I am not ask
ing that this is the way it ought to be.
I am merely stating the facts.
Comparing his undergraduate experi
ences at Stanford to his present living
environment, he writes, "Our college
experiences were in atmospheres far
more racially tense than tne real

world's." Is he unaware of the rise of
the Ku Klux Klan, the recent increase
in anti-Semitic activities, the racial
incidents in Forsythe County, Ga. and
the gang wars in his own city of Los
Angeles?
Work and I agree on one point:
There is too much talk about racism
on campus, but people of color on this
campus and in this country are tired
of being told that racial probelms are
nothing more than a figment of their
imagination.
He believes that such talk contri
butes to racial polarization. I believe
that Stanford has identified the very
real problem of racism; now is the
time for action.
