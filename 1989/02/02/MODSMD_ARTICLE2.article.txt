# Continuing Studies Program pushes for participants

### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
In just its first year of operation, Stan
ford's Continuing Studies Program is
fighting to meet a financial deadline im
posed by the Faculty Senate while trying
to assuage fears that its classes are
weakening undergraduate education.
The Continuing Studies Program uses
University faculty to teach several special
classes each quarter designed for Univer
sity employees, their families and adult
members of surrounding communities.
The program began in the fall and offered
seven courses for each of the last two
quarters.
The program offers credit, but units
earned cannot be applied toward Stanford
degrees. The classes, with topics ranging
from neurobiology to fiction writing, cost
$100 per unit and have a total enrollment

of 183 this quarter.
The program has been heralded by
proponents as a way of improving Stan
ford's often chilly relations with its neigh
bors by opening the University's re
sources to surrounding communities.
When the Faculty Senate created the
program last spring it gave Continuing
Studies only three years to achieve fi
nancial solvency.
What happens if the program does not
meet its 1991 deadline is not clear, ac
cording to Jeff Wachtel, the program's
director. Nevertheless, the program is
racing to meet the goal.
Breaking from the original plans for
the program, Continuing Studies will
teach a summer term this year, Dean of
Continuing Studies Marsh McCall an

most active constituency" during the
summer, McCall explained, "and we don't
want to lose momentum. We want to reach
financial solvency as quickly as possible."
To break even, McCall said, the pro
gram would have to expand to four terms
a year of 12 to 15 courses with an average

enrollment of 30 students per course. In
short, these numbers mean that the pro
gram will have to double both its offer
ings and its enrollments if it is to avoid
possible cancellation.
To meet this challenge, Continuing
Studies has been aggressively marketing
itself. Wachtel said the campaign to draw
more students has included direct-mail
brochures, radio ads, announcements
during Stanford's football and basketball
games, and the distribution of pamphlets
in local libraries, bookstores and coffee
houses.
But the campaign has been ineffective.
Total enrollment increased by just one
student between fall and winter quarters.
McCall admitted that he was disappointed
by the figures, but he called this quarter's
enrollment of 183 "impressive for a pro
gram with no tradition."
In his report to the senate, McCall also

responded to concerns that the adult
classes were distracting faculty from their
primary responsibilities of teaching full
fledged Stanford students and doing re
search.
Civil Engineering Prof. Haresh Shah
said that senior faculty were already busy,
and if they added an extra adult class,
"something has to go."
McCall said he wished to reassure the
senate that there was no competition be
tween Continuing Studies and other com
mitments: "There are no trade-offs on
teaching here."
He added, "We don't ever intend to get
in the position of being seen as infiltrat
ing" regular teaching. McCall also ex
plained that Continuing Studies volun
tarily avoids recruiting associate profes
sors "because we do not want to be an
obstacle along the tenure path for a junior
faculty member."
