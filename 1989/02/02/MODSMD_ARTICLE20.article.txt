# A 						bike is worse than a skateboard
## 
### 
I would like to address David
Levine's Feb. 1 letter concerning
skateboarders and ask him what mode

of transportation he was using when
he "almost ran over three of them." A
bicycle, perhaps?
As a paying student of this Universi
ty, who also enjoys riding a skateboard,
I resent the accusations that I am an
"uninvited, annoying pest." I cannot
tell you how many times I've been run
down by bicycles while skating and
walking to class.
I do not feel that I sould be "elimi
nated" from this campus, as Levine
suggests, just because of my choice of
transportational mode.
Levine should really examine why he
is so resentful of a few kids having
good clean fun on their boards. Would
he prefer perhaps that they were
breaking into cars or doing drum?
