## The
						great library rip-off 
### 
TUITION HIKES have a face and
a name. It is the face and name
of Robert Maxwell.
Robert Maxwell owns — among other
things — Pergamon Press, an English
publishing house of scholarly scientific
journals. The Stanford University library
system buys lots of his journals. So does
every other major research library in
North America. They have to; if they
don't stock the journals, scientists can't
use them.
When Maxwell took over Pergamon
Press, he realized that these libraries
practically defined the concept of a "cap
tive market." Research libraries would
pay whatever it took to get the materials
they need.
And they have done so: Stanford libra-
Ties had to increase their procurement
budget by $660,000 last year just to cover
price increases. This year we will have
to spend $6,241,000 just to maintain our
collections.
Last year alone, Stanford had to spend
$1.7 million to keep up with scientific
publications. That's more than we spent
on books for the humanities, social
sciences, Meyer Library, government doc
uments and special collections combined.
Maxwell has said his goal was the es
tablishment of "a series of publishing
monopolies" in each scientific field, made
possible by the fact that "scientists are
not generally as price-conscious as other
professionals, mainly because they are
not spending their own money."
Right. They're spending ours.
Maxwell has increased Pergamon's
profit margin to nearly 40 percent on

$49,000,000 of sales. A spokesperson for
Elsevier Press, one of the "big three"
European publishers of scientific journals
along with Pergamon and Springer, told
The New York Times that "we feel that
Elsevier makes a reasonable profit, not
an excessive profit." Obviously, the sell
er's definition of "excessive profit" is a
lot different from the buyer's.
To be fair, corporate greed is not the
only factor — perhaps not even the lar
gest factor — in the 17 percent per year
explosion in journal prices. Inflation has
also taken its toll. So has the huge decline
of the dollar against the European cur
rencies in which these journals are
usually priced.
The academic culture has also contrib
uted to the price increases. Each sub
specialty wants its own journal. More
over, the publish-or-perish atmosphere
of American academics means that sci
entists feed new journals with lots of
papers, even though these papers may be
uninteresting or second-rate.
Pergamon, Springer and Elsevier, of
course, are happy to create new journals
to supply this demand; after all, each
new journal they produce means more
revenue at 40 percent profit. And these
journals don't come cheap. Elsevier's
"Immunology Letters" costs $528 per
year. Pergamon's "Molecular Immunol
ogy," $1264.76 for two years.
And we're spending all that money not
to stay in one place, but rather to go
backwards at the slowest possible rate.
Just ask Joe Wible, who runs the Fal
coner Library in biology. This year, he
had to cut subscriptions by $20,000 worth

of biological journals just to cover the
increased cost of the ones the faculty
really need. That's 7 percent of his
chasing power, and next year he'll have
to do it again. Pretty soon, these cuts
are going to hurt.
In the long run, the way out of this
mess is part technological, part social
Scientists are going to have to start using
low-cost, on-line publishing for some of
their articles, and they are also going to
have to start rewarding each other for
publishing quality, not quantity.
In the short run, scientists can help
by giving people like Joe Wible a hand:
Ask yourselves if you really need all the
journals in your libraries.
I certainly would not grudge several
hundred dollars in increased tuition if
went for real library services: putting
card catalogue information in
for example, or hiring more librarians.
But I do grudge the $505.90 in extorted
profits that Robert Maxwell's company
makes off of Falconer's subscription to
"Molecular Immunology."
It's outrageous, and it's got to stop.
