## Substitute McSweeney learns to put team first 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
A former starter, now coming off the bench,
enters the game at a crucial point.
Stanford trails Arizona 13-8, and is fighting
to stay in the game. As a substitute, he knows
he has to make his contributions instantly.
There's no time to ease into the game, to feel
one's way into the rhythm.
So senior Bryan McSweeney is in with 12:55
to go in the first half, replacing starting for
ward Andrew Vlahov. Seconds later,
McSweeney is called for an offensive foul.
Soon after, Arizona guard Matt Othick
bangs home a 3-pointer. This turn of events
could be potentially devastating for a player
in McSweeney's position, who could under
standably pout and be discouraged.
Certainly, as Stanford prepares to play at
Arizona State tonight, Bryan McSweeney
would be the first to tell you this hasn't been
his dream senior season.
After starting 31 games in 1987-88, the
6-foot-6, 195-pounder was replaced in the
starting lineup five games into the season by
Vlahov. He has also been plagued by a strained
ligament in his knee, and seen his minutes
diminish from 26 per game last season to
11.5 in 1988-89 and his points-per-game drop
from 7.0 to 3.0.
But the next time down for Arizona, it's
McSweeney with the rebound. Under a minute
later, McSweeney blocks a shot.
And when he gets the ball squared up to
the basket, he shoots it as confidently as an
All-American.
Bryan McSweeney is not a brooder. He
knows he's not going to be a 20-points-per
game player in his senior year. But he's settled
into his role, and is ready to push himself as
much as he can in order to ensure that even
if it isn't a dream season for him, it is for
Stanford.
"For me, if I were to make a stink about
not playing as much, all it would do is hurt
the team," McSweeney says."And that's not
our goal."
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery, for one,
has appreciated the team-first attitude
McSweeney has as much as the effort
McSweeney brings off the bench.
"There was always potential for a guy to
be disgruntled," Montgomery says. "Whereas
he didn't necessarily agree or like it, Bryan

has always kept his attitude positive, and
worked within the framework of winning
games."
Many watching Stanford basketball would
even say that McSweeney has flowered in that
role.
"Every day he's still out there playing as
hard as he can," Stanford guard Terry Taylor
says."He hasn't really let it affect his game.
I think he might even be more comfortable
with coming off the bench."
"If you're on the bench," McSweeney says,
"and you're coming in the game, you've got
to have the mentality that you really should
be in there.
"My confidence has gotten a little better,"
he adds. "At the beginning of the year it was
wavering a bit, (but now) anytime Coach puts
me in, I feel I'll do something."
His contributions to the team, as the cliche
goes, may not be appearing in the box score,
but McSweeney has never worried much about
his stats. His forte has always been defense.

So for every great offensive game in his
career, such as when he shot a perfect 5-for-5
from the field and 6-for-6 from the line against
Alabama Birmingham in 1986-87, he has had
many great defensive efforts.
The most memorable for Cardinal fans
would probably be when he played a large
role in holding Arizona's Sean Elliott to 4-
for-10 shooting in the second half of Stanford's
win over the No. 1 Wildcats last February.
"Defensively over the years he has done a
real nice job," Montgomery says. "With the
guys we have scoring-wise, he looks at himself
as more of a role player, and he's been willing
to accept that role."
Role player. Those words probably didn't
find their way into Bryan McSweeney's
dreams as a child. But even if the Tooth Fairy
stops coming by and the Sandman is a distant
memory, there remains the pride of doing
your best and seeing it benefit others. And
that's what McSweeney and Stanford have in
1988-89.

The most memorable for Cardinal fans
would probably be when he played a large
role in holding Arizona's Sean Elliott to 4-
for-10 shooting in the second half of Stanford's
win over the No. 1 Wildcats last February.
"Defensively over the years he has done a
real nice job," Montgomery says. "With the
guys we have scoring-wise, he looks at himself
as more of a role player, and he's been willing
to accept that role."
Role player. Those words probably didn't
find their way into Bryan McSweeney's
dreams as a child. But even if the Tooth Fairy
stops coming by and the Sandman is a distant
memory, there remains the pride of doing
your best and seeing it benefit others. And
that's what McSweeney and Stanford have in
1988-89.

Stanford forward Bryan McSweeney applies tough defensive pres
sure. Sixth man McSweeney and his Cardinal teammates go up
against Arizona State tonight In Tempe.
A former starter, now coming off the bench,
enters the game at a crucial point.
Stanford trails Arizona 13-8, and is fighting
to stay in the game. As a substitute, he knows
he has to make his contributions instantly.
There's no time to ease into the game, to feel
one's way into the rhythm.
So senior Bryan McSweeney is in with 12:55
to go in the first half, replacing starting for
ward Andrew Vlahov. Seconds later,
McSweeney is called for an offensive foul.
Soon after, Arizona guard Matt Othick
bangs home a 3-pointer. This turn of events
could be potentially devastating for a player
in McSweeney's position, who could under
standably pout and be discouraged.
Certainly, as Stanford prepares to play at
Arizona State tonight, Bryan McSweeney
would be the first to tell you this hasn't been
his dream senior season.
After starting 31 games in 1987-88, the
6-foot-6, 195-pounder was replaced in the
starting lineup five games into the season by
Vlahov. He has also been plagued by a strained
ligament in his knee, and seen his minutes
diminish from 26 per game last season to
11.5 in 1988-89 and his points-per-game drop
from 7.0 to 3.0.
But the next time down for Arizona, it's
McSweeney with the rebound. Under a minute
later, McSweeney blocks a shot.
And when he gets the ball squared up to
the basket, he shoots it as confidently as an
All-American.
Bryan McSweeney is not a brooder. He
knows he's not going to be a 20-points-per
game player in his senior year. But he's settled
into his role, and is ready to push himself as
much as he can in order to ensure that even
if it isn't a dream season for him, it is for
Stanford.
"For me, if I were to make a stink about
not playing as much, all it would do is hurt
the team," McSweeney says."And that's not
our goal."
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery, for one,
has appreciated the team-first attitude
McSweeney has as much as the effort
McSweeney brings off the bench.
"There was always potential for a guy to
be disgruntled," Montgomery says. "Whereas
he didn't necessarily agree or like it, Bryan

has always kept his attitude positive, and
worked within the framework of winning
games."
Many watching Stanford basketball would
even say that McSweeney has flowered in that
role.
"Every day he's still out there playing as
hard as he can," Stanford guard Terry Taylor
says."He hasn't really let it affect his game.
I think he might even be more comfortable
with coming off the bench."
"If you're on the bench," McSweeney says,
"and you're coming in the game, you've got
to have the mentality that you really should
be in there.
"My confidence has gotten a little better,"
he adds. "At the beginning of the year it was
wavering a bit, (but now) anytime Coach puts
me in, I feel I'll do something."
His contributions to the team, as the cliche
goes, may not be appearing in the box score,
but McSweeney has never worried much about
his stats. His forte has always been defense.

So for every great offensive game in his
career, such as when he shot a perfect 5-for-5
from the field and 6-for-6 from the line against
Alabama Birmingham in 1986-87, he has had
many great defensive efforts.
