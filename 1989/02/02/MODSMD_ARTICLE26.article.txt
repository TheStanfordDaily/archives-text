# Stanford at Arizona State
## 
### 
TONIGHT - KZSU (90 1 FM), KCBS (740 AM). 6:30 p.m. (PST) tipoff in Tempe, Ariz
RECOROS - Stanford (15-5, 7-3 and 3rd in Pac-10 play, ranked 20th by AP), ASU (10-8. 3-6 and
7th in Pac-10).
SERIES — All time: ASU leads 14-11. Recently. Stanford has won four of five. Last game: On Jan.
7, Stanford had a season-high in points in posting a 94-65 victory. Last game in Tempe: Seven
ASU players scored in double figures as the Sun Devils romped. 104-80.
SUN DEVIL UPDATE — ASU has held its own this year despite being hammered with injuries to three
starters. The latest: center Mark Becker is out indefinitely with a broken right wrist. Forward Trent
Edwards leads the squad at 17.9 ppg and 8.4 rpg, with forward Alex Austin coming in at 14.8,
and 6.9.
CARDINAL UPDATE — Stanford has lost two of four after winning eight straight, and the Cardinal's
road record has dropped to 5-5 Terry Taylor leads Pac-10 point guards in assist-turnover ratio
(4.0). Todd Lichtl needs two points to move into fifth place on the all-time, all-games career scoring
list, 14 points to move into fourth and 24 points to reach third. He needs 23 points to become the
No 2 scorer all-time in conference games. Stanford went 7-2 in the month of January.
KEYS TO VICTORY — Last month, Stanford faced ASU riding high from its win over Arizona and blew
out the Sun Devils with ease. Now, coming off a loss to Arizona and playing ASU on the road, the
Cardinal must avoid a parallel letdown. Stanford needs to work on the effectiveness of its offensive
game — even when Lichti has been at his hottest, the goal of Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery's
offense has been to pound the ball inside and score. Stanford needs to reassert its strength in
that area.
