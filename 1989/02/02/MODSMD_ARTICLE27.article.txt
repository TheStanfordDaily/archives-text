# Stanford's pitching always prevails
## 
### 
Not to worry, Cardinal base
ball fans. Stanford will be
just fine. Remember last
year? We had a slow start and
went on to win the College World
Series for the second straight
season. That's not to say we'll
win it all again, but rather to
squelch any worries that 1989 will
be a dismal year.

The 0-3 start doesn't matter.
We have the arms. Successful
baseball teams sport quality hur
lers. Just ask the upstart Los
Angeles Dodgers.
Forget that ace reliever Steve
Chitren is off to another horrific
start. Chitren is a proven stopper.
He started terribly last year

before going on to pitch the final
out in the College World Series
for the second year in a row. He
will again be the best reliever in
the country by season's end.
Forget that Brian Keyser
struggled on Monday against San
Jose State. Keyser will develop
into a solid third starter for the
Cardinal. In seven innings of CWS
work over the past two years,
Keyser has given up just two runs
against some of the finest bats in
the country.
Keyser simply tired in the fifth
inning against the Spartans. Re
member that he has pitched most
of the last two seasons as a
reliever, behind the likes of Jack
McDowell, Lee Plemel, Mike Mus
sina and Stan Spencer. He's not
used to stints of more than three
or four innings. His longest outing
as a Cardinal is just seven innings,
and that came two years ago. He'll
need time to develop the stamina
necessary to keep Pac-10 South
bats at bay for nine innings.
Sophomores Mussina and Spen
cer will be Marquess' top two
starters in '89, and should stay
there as long as they want to
remain on the Farm. As freshmen

Stanford's arms are
the reason Marquess
can claim two NCAA
titles.

last season, they again proved the
old baseball adage that good pitch
ing beats good hitting. Handling
the CWS pressure like senior
teammate Plemel, Mussina and
Spencer helped pitch Stanford to
its second title. While other
teams' top starters wilt in Omaha,
Stanford's arms are the reason
Marquess can claim two NCAA
championships. Both Mussina and
Spencer pitched very well last
weekend against Santa Clara.
And just as Mussina and Spen
cer filled the huge void created
by McDowell's departure, so will
senior Keyser and a host of young
arms help us forget the loss of
Plemel.
Battling for the fourth starting
spot is sophomore Scott Weiss.
Weiss appeared in last Sunday's
3-2 loss to Santa Clara and gave
up just a solo home run in three

innings of work. Junior Robbie
Kamerschen will be used in long
relief, but is also in the hunt for
the fourth starting spot.
Freshman Steve Worrell figures
to see plenty of action out of the
pen and possibly in a spot starting
role. He is Marquess' only left
hander, bringing to mind Cardinal
lefty A 1 Osuna's 8 2/3 scoreless
innings in the 1987 CWS semi
final game. Worrell began the
season with two scoreless innings
in Friday's 3-2 loss to Santa Clara
but was roughed up for four
earned runs on four hits without
retiring a batter against San Jose.
Another freshman, Aaron Dor
larque, should see action, but his
first outing of the year was not
a good one. He surrendered two
runs on three hits in 2/3 innings
against San Jose.
Despite the early setbacks,
Stanford's young arms figure to
be productive soon, if not as soon
as precocious freshmen Mussina
and Spencer were last year. And
with the pair of sophomores going
every weekend against Six-Pac
competition they've seen before,
Stanford figures to win two out
of three more often than not in
1989.
