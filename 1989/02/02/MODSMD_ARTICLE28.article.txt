# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Following a week in which 12 different
Stanford teams competed, it was obvious
choosing just two Athletes of the Week would
be difficult. It took much deliberating, ban
tering back and forth and screaming, but
after wrestling with the facts (and each
other), we had an answer.
The lucky winners this week are women's
basketball player Sonja Henning and
wrestler Steve Yarbrough.

Henning, a 5-foot-8 sophomore guard from
Racine, Wis., led the Cardinal to two more
wins over the weekend, running the team's
victory streak to nine and moving Stanford
up to No. 4 in the AP poll, the team's
highest ranking ever.
Friday, at Oregon, Henning scored 12
points, had three rebounds, four steals and
five assists to lead the Cardinal to an easy
92-69 win.
The following night, at Oregon State, Hen
ning really took control. She scored 18 points,
pulled down five rebounds, had two steals
and dished out a career-high 12 assists as
Stanford won 75-64. Henning also hit 12 of
13 free throws in the win that ran the
team's record to 15-2, 7-0 in Pacific 10
Conference action.
Henning is currently the team's top 3-
point percentage shooter at .500 (10-20) and
is averaging 9.8 points, 3.8 rebounds, 5.2
assists and 1.9 steals per game. Although
only a sophomore, Henning is currently sixth
on the all-time Stanford career assists ladder
with 211.

Yarbrough, a junior from Corrales, N.M.,
won his match against Humboldt State and
won his weight class at the All-Cal Invita
tional last weekend.
Friday, in the Cardinal's first dual meet
in more than two months, Yarbrough pinned
his Lumberjack opponent early in the first
round to lead Stanford to an easy 28-10
victory over favored Humboldt State at

Maples Pavilion.
The following day the team travelled to
San Francisco State for the All-Cal Invite.
The 177-pounder was one of six Cardinal
placewinners and won his second tourna
ment in a row by defeating Cal-State
Bakersfield's Brian Woods 4-3 in the final.
As a team, Stanford finished third in the
tournament.
