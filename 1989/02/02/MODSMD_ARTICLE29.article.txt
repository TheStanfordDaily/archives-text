it was business as usual as the
No. 1 team in the nation shut
out the University of the Pacific
Tigers, 9-0, in its first meet of
the season.
Perhaps understating the case
a bit, Stanford Coach Frank Bren
nan said "it went very well."
Very well indeed when one con
siders that the Cardinal didn't
drop a set in either singles or
doubles. The team accomplished
that feat despite playing without

three of its All-Americans —
Sandra Birch, Eleni Rossides and
Tami Whitlinger — who were out
due to injuries.
With gusty winds, cold temper
atures and a constant light rain
that nearly forced play to be
stopped, the players had trouble
getting comfortable at any time.
Someone would start playing in
their warm-ups then, after two
games or so, remove them only
to put them back on two games
later, Rrennan said.
Despite the conditions, it was
"all very solid and businesslike,"
Brennan noted.

first chance to get in some real
competition en route to defending
their NCAA title.
"1 think it was good just to play
a match and ... get one under
our belts," said Lisa Green who
