# New phone plan may dial success
## 
### Caitlin Liu Staff writer 
Imagine walking into your
new dorm on the first day of
fall quarter and being able to
make a phone call before you
even unpack. No more lining
up for the pay phone to call
home. No more waiting for
days before you receive your
own dial tone.
Sounds too good to be true?
UC-Berkeley has made phone
lines immediately accessible to
students since 1987, and Stan
ford will follow suit starting
this fall.
Following a nationwide trend
of universities such as Duke,
Harvard, Yale, the University
of Michigan and Berkeley,
Stanford will install a campus
telephone network in student
residences, beginning with
Roble Hall this fall and con
tinuing with the remaining res
idences by fall 1990, Director
of Communication Services
Jan Thomson said yesterday.
Currently, Berkeley students
not only have instant access to
phone lines, but they receive
many other services through
their phone network such as
an individual billing system, ac
cording to Berkeley Coordina
tor for Residence Telephone
Service Mike Yuhas.
Unlike Stanford students
who must face the monthly
chore of dividing up bills with
their roommates, "the
(Berkeley) residents are each
issued a unique seven-digit
code that allows them to get
individual bills each month,"
Yuhas said.
Yuhas said Berkeley doesn't
make a profit on its phone sys
tem, in order "to save students
money and to give them better
service."

Most Berkeley students said
they appreciate the benefits of
their telephone network. "I
thought it was great we all got
individual bills," said sopho
more Rashmi Sadana, a dorm
resident last year. Fellow
Berkeley sophomore Tracey
Hessel also noted that her
monthly rates are much lower
with the network.
But the Berkeley system is
not without its problems.
Senior Chris Riback said there
are people who "play with the
codes until they find one that
works." Students then may
charge their long distance calls
to those stolen codes, he ex
plained.
"It happened to me," Riback
said. "My phone bill was double
what it should have been."
The Stanford network will
have features similar to the
current Berkeley system, in
cluding the separate billing
service and the personal au
thorization codes, according to
Thomson.
"We will be having a
lengthier (nine-digit) authori
zation code which should dis
courage (number stealing),"
Thomson said, adding that the
responsibilities accompanying
such a code will not be much
different from owning a student
ID or a credit card.
The phone system, approved
last quarter by the Board of
Trustees, will coat $5.2 million,
with "most of the money going
for facilities and equipment,"
Thomson said.
According to Stephen Es
selstyn, Communication Serv
ices assistant director, the $5.2
million will be paid in install
ments. The new monthly rates
for subscribers should be less
or "virtually identical" to the
rates that students now pay.
