# Stanford signs top lineman
## 
### 
In a major recruiting coup,
Stanford received a verbal com
mitment from Bob Whitfield who
was rated the best high school
offensive lineman in the nation.
Whitfield is 6-foot-6, 280
pounds and is 3aid to be quick
and well-porportioned. "I was con
sidering Stanford until Elway got
fired," Whitfield said. He later
changed him mind after Dennis
Green was hired as head coach.
"[Green] talked to me on a one
on-one level, not like an athlete
and coach," Whitfield said.
Allen Wallace of Super Prep
magazine said, "For Stanford to
turn the corner, they had to get
a player like this."
Whitfield is the third top
lineman to commit to Stanford.
