THE STANFORD DAILY ENTERTAINING WEEKLY

Ditch Daytona
Spring break is rapidly approaching-time to
break out the suntan lotion and head down to
Florida to catch some rays. And what better
way to have fun and catch rays in Florida than
to visit Walt Disney World!
Throughout the entire month of March,
vacationing students who present a valid col
lege I D. pay only $19.95 for one day at either
the Magic Kingdom or Michael Jackson's Epcot
Center. This is a huge savings over the regular
$28 admission, savings which could allow you
to purchase more liquid refreshments, such as
as Mickeylob Light.
Happy Groundhog Day!
Today in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania,
hordes of reporters from around the nation will
stand outside the hole of Punxsutawney Phil,
the official groundhog of Groundhog Day,
waiting to discover if he will see his shadow.
According to legend, if Phil comes out of
hibernation today and sees his shadow, he will
return to his burrow for six more weeks of
winter weather. If he does not see his shadow
then spring can begin immediately.
Literally dozends of reporters will gather out
side Punxsutawney Phil's hole, making this the
biggest news event involving rodents since the
Republican National Convention last June.
Night after night after...
Tonight through Sunday you can catch the
Drama Department's production of Shake
speare's "Twelfth Night" in the Nitery in Old
Union. Showtimes are at 8 p.m. tonight through
Sunday, with matinees at 2 p.m. on Saturday

one of the lead actors, "Ever since I got to
Stanford I've wanted to do Shakespeare very
badly." Tickets to see Hart and the rest of the
enthusiastic cast are available at the Tresidder
Ticket Office or at the door.
