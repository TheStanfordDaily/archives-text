# What happens when you make a controversial film that everybody refuses to show
## 
### Alex Kostich Staff writer 
It's been a hectic week for Bay Area filmmaker
Rob Nilsson. Since his latest film, "Heat and Sun
light," opened last November he has been busily
promoting it. Fresh off a plane from Park City, Utah
(where his film won Grand Prize at the 1988 U.S.
Film Festival) he is about to embark on a journey
to Sweden where "Heat and Sunlight" will soon open.
Aside from being a hectic week, it has also been
a frustrating one. American distributors do not v/ant
anything to do with "Heat and Sunlight," calling it
"offensive," "uncommercial" and "sexually violent."
Recently, "Heat and Sunlight" producer Steven
Burns and director Nilsson spoke to The Daily about
their careers as independent filmmakers and the
struggle in making the movie.

Explain why the
film is titled "Heat
and Sunlight." The
plot follows the last
few hours of a love
affair.
Burns: The thesis
was — or our original
idea was — to have
an all cold and
distant-looking film.
The "Heat and Sun
light" came from in
side the characters'
souls . . . the heat is
the passion which
one feels and the sun
light is the under
standing of one's
soul. Our thesis in
the end was that [the j

comes to the sunlight of his own life.
Mr. Nilsson, you play the lead character, Mel
Hurley. Are you in any ways like Mel? Is the film
in any way auto- or semi-autobiographical?
Nilsson: Well, I know what it's all about — for
Mel, it was kind of an exorcism, dealing with the
affair. I suppose I have some of his characteristics.
I think men are too competitive, and we suffer for
it; we get burned because of our need to achieve. In
arenas where women are traditionally associated with

feelings, intuition, emotion, men have lost out. They
need to find that part of themselves — the emotional
part.
Feminists must love you for that kind of attitude.
Nilsson: Actually, many feminists who don't un
derstand the film have attacked the film. They say
it's offensive to women and so forth. But they don't
understand what side I'm on! I'm on passion's side,
and I think men need to find that passion — we
need to find that emotion to bring us together.
[In the film's climactic love scene] I wanted to
show that Carmen was a prime mover; she takes
his shirt off, she slaps him, she states her own course
with him. He's the one who screws it up — there's
potential for reconciliation, but he wants to control
her. She doesn't buy it ... I love the scene.
What do you think of the distributing situation
surrounding the film?
Nilsson: It's a disgrace! The film's been rejected
by everyone we've approached. We're having a very
hard time getting the film shown — I feel really
angry at the system.
Burns: Distributors literally don't want to touch
it, even though we opened to a good financial response
in San Francisco.
Could you describe how you went about filming
the movie's controversial sex scene? What were
you trying to convey? What were you after?
Nilsson: I wanted it to be raw ... a kind of thing
showing the connections between violent rage,
sexuality and jealousy. I didn't want the "cut to the
violins" cliche sexuality. Instead, I wanted it to look
like the inside of one's head when one is making

love. There's a kind of splintering inside — a mosaic
of scenes both raw and real. It was not just sheer
titillation business-as-usual. It's very close to our
own experience, where one reaches a higher self.
The editing throughout the film, especially in
that scene, was original, clever, bizarre.
Nilsson: Thank you. Hank Van Enghen is a great

editor. In the love scene he discovered ways to use
layerings [ the fades and superimposed photographs]
in really ingenious ways. And the David Byrne music
helps the scene, too.
What are your feelings about "going Hollywood"
in the future?
Nilsson:That's always a complicated question.

Quite frankJy, it's not where you work but what you
work with. Filmmaking is collaborative, like a jazz
ensemble. You don't ask the trumpet player to do
bass. For me, I need to guard zealously the oppor
tunity to work in film freely — it's not Hollywood
— it's just an opportunity. As of right now, I would
love to stay in the Bay Area. Economics make it
difficult to distribute my work, though.

show that Carmen was a prime mover; she takes
his shirt off, she slaps him, she states her own course
with him. He's the one who screws it up — there's
potential for reconciliation, but he wants to control
her. She doesn't buy it ... I love the scene.
What do you think of the distributing situation
surrounding the film?
Nilsson: It's a disgrace! The film's been rejected
by everyone we've approached. We're having a very
hard time getting the film shown — I feel really
angry at the system.
Burns: Distributors literally don't want to touch
it, even though we opened to a good financial response
in San Francisco.
Could you describe how you went about filming
the movie's controversial sex scene? What were
you trying to convey? What were you after?
Nilsson: I wanted it to be raw ... a kind of thing
showing the connections between violent rage,
sexuality and jealousy. I didn't want the "cut to the
violins" cliche sexuality. Instead, I wanted it to look
like the inside of one's head when one is making

love. There's a kind of splintering inside — a mosaic
of scenes both raw and real. It was not just sheer
titillation business-as-usual. It's very close to our
own experience, where one reaches a higher self.
The editing throughout the film, especially in
that scene, was original, clever, bizarre.
Nilsson: Thank you. Hank Van Enghen is a great

editor. In the love scene he discovered ways to use
layerings [ the fades and superimposed photographs]
in really ingenious ways. And the David Byrne music
helps the scene, too.
What are your feelings about "going Hollywood"
in the future?
Nilsson:That's always a complicated question.

Quite frankJy, it's not where you work but what you
work with. Filmmaking is collaborative, like a jazz
ensemble. You don't ask the trumpet player to do
bass. For me, I need to guard zealously the oppor
tunity to work in film freely — it's not Hollywood
— it's just an opportunity. As of right now, I would
love to stay in the Bay Area. Economics make it
difficult to distribute my work, though.
It's been a hectic week for Bay Area filmmaker
Rob Nilsson. Since his latest film, "Heat and Sun
light," opened last November he has been busily
promoting it. Fresh off a plane from Park City, Utah
(where his film won Grand Prize at the 1988 U.S.
Film Festival) he is about to embark on a journey
to Sweden where "Heat and Sunlight" will soon open.
Aside from being a hectic week, it has also been
a frustrating one. American distributors do not v/ant
anything to do with "Heat and Sunlight," calling it
"offensive," "uncommercial" and "sexually violent."
Recently, "Heat and Sunlight" producer Steven
Burns and director Nilsson spoke to The Daily about
their careers as independent filmmakers and the
struggle in making the movie.

Explain why the
film is titled "Heat
and Sunlight." The
plot follows the last
few hours of a love
affair.
Burns: The thesis
was — or our original
idea was — to have
an all cold and
distant-looking film.
The "Heat and Sun
light" came from in
side the characters'
souls . . . the heat is
the passion which
one feels and the sun
light is the under
standing of one's
soul. Our thesis in
the end was that [the j
main character]

comes to the sunlight of his own life.
Mr. Nilsson, you play the lead character, Mel
Hurley. Are you in any ways like Mel? Is the film
in any way auto- or semi-autobiographical?
Nilsson: Well, I know what it's all about — for
Mel, it was kind of an exorcism, dealing with the
affair. I suppose I have some of his characteristics.
I think men are too competitive, and we suffer for
it; we get burned because of our need to achieve. In
arenas where women are traditionally associated with

feelings, intuition, emotion, men have lost out. They
need to find that part of themselves — the emotional
part.
Feminists must love you for that kind of attitude.
Nilsson: Actually, many feminists who don't un
derstand the film have attacked the film. They say
it's offensive to women and so forth. But they don't
understand what side I'm on! I'm on passion's side,
and I think men need to find that passion — we
need to find that emotion to bring us together.
[In the film's climactic love scene] I wanted to
show that Carmen was a prime mover; she takes
his shirt off, she slaps him, she states her own course
with him. He's the one who screws it up — there's
potential for reconciliation, but he wants to control
her. She doesn't buy it ... I love the scene.
