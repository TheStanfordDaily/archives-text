# A 						new script for everybody's favorite TV show
## 
### 
In an effort to further my writing career
I have recently written an episode of "The
Cosby Show." I am sending it to NBC in
the hopes that it will be produced.
The Cosby Show
(SCENE: The Huxtable living room. Dr.
Cliff Huxtable and his cute daughter Rudy
are sitting on the sofa. Music plays. Cut
to the New Cosby Theme Song.)
I he New Cosby Theme Song:
Let's go visit the Huxtables, the Huxtables,
the Huxtables
Let's go visit the Huxtables, the Huxtables,
the Huxtables
Nothing rhymes with Huxtables, with
Huxtables, with Huxtables
Nothing rhymes with Huxtables, with
Huxtables, with Huxtables
(Back to the living room. Camera is
tight on Cliff Huxtable's face as he makes
silly faces very similar to the ones he has
made in the last 238 episodes. We hear
Rudy laughing hysterically in the back
ground.)
CLIFF: (still making faces) How's my

Rudy tutti frutti?
RUDY: I'm hungry Daddy.
CLIFF: Well, how about some . . . lELLO
PUDDING!
RUDY: Don't be gross. (Laugh track.)
(Claire Huxtable [played by Phylicia
Ayers Allen Rashad Abdul Jabbarl comes
down the staircase. She sits on the couch
with Cliff and Rudy, and then kisses Cliff
on the lips with such passion that wc are
forced to avert our eyes and hide the
children.)
CLAIRE: Cliff, arc you excited about
Dcnise coming home from college?
CLIFF: You bet I am, Claire. And I
can't wait to meet her new boyfriend. (The
doorbell rings.)
CLAIRE: Oh Cliff, that must be her.
(She scurries across the room and opens
the door.) Oh my sweety, my darling, my
angel heart, it's so good to see you. And
this must be your boyfriepd. Why, he's
. . . he's . . . he's . . . MICKEY ROURKE!!
OH MY GOD, LOCK THE DOORS!
CLIFF: (to Denise) Honey, how long
have you been going out with your, uh,
boyfriend?
DENISE: 9weeks. (Rim shot.)

(The next day. The house is an idyllic
picture of suburban America. Vanessa and
Theo are helping Claire with housework.
Cliff is close by, entertaining the brood
with tales frotn his youth and bouncing
Rudy playfully on his knee. From upstairs
we hear Denise and Mickey Rourke
making fiery, violent love as blood drips
from the ceiling.)
CLIFF: Such an idylic scene. I wish I
could capture it on film — Kodak film.
VANESSA: Can Theo and I go out with
some friends to a movie tonight?
CLAIRE: Why, honey, you know our
rules. No dating until you turn 21 and
. . . (yelling up the sfuirsj....DENlSE,
WHAT THE DEVIL IS MAKING ALL
THAT NOISE?
DENISE: YOU GUESSED IT!
THEO: Dad, please, you gotta let me
go out. If I'm not there all my friends arc
going to think I'm not cool. (Laugh track.)
CLIFF: What was that? 1 could have
sworn I heard people laughing.
CLAIRE: Don't be silly, Cliff. It must
have been the wind. (Winks at stage man
ager.)

(late that night. We are in Cliff and
Claire's bedroom now. The house is com
pletely silent except for Denise's room
where a team of reporters from the Na
tional Enquirer have been working around
the clock to determine whether her un
born child was fathered by The Devil,
Michael 112. Fox or Elvis.)
CLAIRE: Come to bed, Cliff. You've
been pacing for hours.
CLIFF: I know. It's just that I'm worried
about Theo. It's almost 10:30 and he isn't
home yet.
CLAIRE: Don't worry, honey. It's not
like he's out subverting sorority rush or
anything. (She gives a sexy wink at Cliff
and shows him a healthy helping of her
pafama-clad shoulder.)
CLIFF: I sunpose you're right. But I'm
also worried about our finances. I mean,
we already have two kids in college, and
soon there'll be two more .. . three more
if you count Theo.
CLAIRE: I've been worried too, Cliff.
It's not easy to get by on the salaries of
a doctor and a lawyer. Maybe we should

start making some wise investment deci
sions.
CLIFF: By golly you're right. After all
it's my money. Good night, Claire.
CLAIRE: Good night, Cliff.
(Cliff turns out the lights.)
CLIFF: Claire?
CLAIRE Yes?
CLIFF: I'm thirsty.
CLAIRE: Have a Coke.
CLIFF: Yuck!

I he New Cosby Theme Song:
Let's go visit the Huxtables, the Huxtables,
the Huxtables
Let's go visit the Huxtables, the Huxtables,
the Huxtables
Nothing rhymes with Huxtables, with
Huxtables, with Huxtables
Nothing rhymes with Huxtables, with
Huxtables, with Huxtables
(Back to the living room. Camera is
tight on Cliff Huxtable's face as he makes
silly faces very similar to the ones he has
made in the last 238 episodes. We hear
Rudy laughing hysterically in the back
ground.)
CLIFF: (still making faces) How's my

Rudy tutti frutti?
RUDY: I'm hungry Daddy.
CLIFF: Well, how about some . . . lELLO
PUDDING!
RUDY: Don't be gross. (Laugh track.)
(Claire Huxtable [played by Phylicia
Ayers Allen Rashad Abdul Jabbarl comes
down the staircase. She sits on the couch
with Cliff and Rudy, and then kisses Cliff
on the lips with such passion that wc are
forced to avert our eyes and hide the
children.)
CLAIRE: Cliff, arc you excited about
Dcnise coming home from college?
CLIFF: You bet I am, Claire. And I
can't wait to meet her new boyfriend. (The
doorbell rings.)
CLAIRE: Oh Cliff, that must be her.
(She scurries across the room and opens
the door.) Oh my sweety, my darling, my
angel heart, it's so good to see you. And
this must be your boyfriepd. Why, he's
. . . he's . . . he's . . . MICKEY ROURKE!!
OH MY GOD, LOCK THE DOORS!
CLIFF: (to Denise) Honey, how long
have you been going out with your, uh,
boyfriend?
DENISE: 9weeks. (Rim shot.)

(The next day. The house is an idyllic
picture of suburban America. Vanessa and
Theo are helping Claire with housework.
Cliff is close by, entertaining the brood
with tales frotn his youth and bouncing
Rudy playfully on his knee. From upstairs
we hear Denise and Mickey Rourke
making fiery, violent love as blood drips
from the ceiling.)
CLIFF: Such an idylic scene. I wish I
could capture it on film — Kodak film.
VANESSA: Can Theo and I go out with
some friends to a movie tonight?
CLAIRE: Why, honey, you know our
rules. No dating until you turn 21 and
. . . (yelling up the sfuirsj....DENlSE,
WHAT THE DEVIL IS MAKING ALL
THAT NOISE?
DENISE: YOU GUESSED IT!
THEO: Dad, please, you gotta let me
go out. If I'm not there all my friends arc
going to think I'm not cool. (Laugh track.)
CLIFF: What was that? 1 could have
sworn I heard people laughing.
CLAIRE: Don't be silly, Cliff. It must
have been the wind. (Winks at stage man
ager.)

(late that night. We are in Cliff and
Claire's bedroom now. The house is com
pletely silent except for Denise's room
where a team of reporters from the Na
tional Enquirer have been working around
the clock to determine whether her un
born child was fathered by The Devil,
Michael 112. Fox or Elvis.)
CLAIRE: Come to bed, Cliff. You've
been pacing for hours.
CLIFF: I know. It's just that I'm worried
about Theo. It's almost 10:30 and he isn't
home yet.
CLAIRE: Don't worry, honey. It's not
like he's out subverting sorority rush or
anything. (She gives a sexy wink at Cliff
and shows him a healthy helping of her
pafama-clad shoulder.)
CLIFF: I sunpose you're right. But I'm
also worried about our finances. I mean,
we already have two kids in college, and
soon there'll be two more .. . three more
if you count Theo.
CLAIRE: I've been worried too, Cliff.
It's not easy to get by on the salaries of
a doctor and a lawyer. Maybe we should

start making some wise investment deci
sions.
CLIFF: By golly you're right. After all
it's my money. Good night, Claire.
CLAIRE: Good night, Cliff.
(Cliff turns out the lights.)
CLIFF: Claire?
CLAIRE Yes?
CLIFF: I'm thirsty.
CLAIRE: Have a Coke.
CLIFF: Yuck!

In an effort to further my writing career
I have recently written an episode of "The
Cosby Show." I am sending it to NBC in
the hopes that it will be produced.
The Cosby Show
(SCENE: The Huxtable living room. Dr.
Cliff Huxtable and his cute daughter Rudy
are sitting on the sofa. Music plays. Cut
to the New Cosby Theme Song.)
