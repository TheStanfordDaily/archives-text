# Rainfall lag may mean a dry Lake Lag

### Lara Filson 
Last weekend's warm tempera
tures and Cardinal baseball
season-opener conjured memories
of springtime in many students'
minds.
But with the continued drought
and pessimistic outlook for more
rain, Lake Lagunita is unlikely to
fill to normal levels once again.
As of last week, Santa Clara
County had received only 34 per
cent of the average annual rainfall
expected, according to a county
report. In a normal year, 57 per
cent of the annual total would
have fallen.
At this time last year, 45 per
cent of the total had fallen. By
the end of the season, the lake
only filled to 9 feet, 3 feet below
its regular level.

At this year's rate, the lake may
reach a level of only 6 feet deep.
The lake's water supply is sup
plemented by San Francisquito
Creek or Felt Lake when
precipitation is not sufficient.
These sources are suffering from
the third straight year of drought.
Last year, the creek was used
to supplement the lower levels of
rainfall, according to Cheryl Jen
sen, manager of Operations and
Maintenance. She added that this
year the creek does not seem ca
pable of serving the same purpose.
The University currently uses
Felt Lake primarily for irrigation
and agricultural purposes, Jensen
said, noting that it will probably
not change those priorities just to
fill the lake. "Windsurfing is not
as important as the need for ir
rigation at this time." he said.

It may turn out to be the clincher for
students. They will finally realize the extent of
the drought when it affects recreational use.'

The University buys most of its
water from the San Francisco
Water District, which is supplied
by the Hetch-Hetchy Reservoir.
To use this water or pump ground
water for the purpose of filling
the lake would cause a regional
uproar, Jensen said.
"The limited supply of water
has to be used for what the public
believes to be neccessary. Most
people would not agree that Lake
Lagunita is important enough,"

Jensen said.
The last time the lake remained
empty occurred sometime in the
late 19705, according to Jensen.
Julie Coopet, coordinator of the
Housing Energy Conservation
Center, found one positive aspect
of not filling the lake. "It may
turn out to be the clincher for
students. They will finally realize
the extent of the drought when it
affects their recreational use,"
Coopet said.
