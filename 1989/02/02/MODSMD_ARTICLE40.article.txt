## Crowds cackle for cool comedian 
### Mia Manzulli Staff writer 
Harlem. Comedy. Somehow the
two images don't quite fit together.
Most people do not associate
humor and laughter with the
poverty, violence and despair that
characterize Harlem. But laughter
emerges from the ghetto in the
form of funnyman Damon
Waymans who comes to Stanford
this weekend courtesy of the Con
cert Network.
Wayans' act, which recounts his
youthful years among the dangers
and vices of Harlem, has estab
lished him as a first rate stand-up
comic. He admits to having had
a great degree of hostility when he
began his career. "I thought it was
my duty to scare white people,"
he said, recalling his angry humor.

Wayans has a keen sense of ob
servation and an honesty about his
life that lends an air of wisened
hardness to his act. In his own
words, Damon Wayans tells "the
naked truth."
While performing, Wayans is
said to be unpretentious with a
"magnetic, stylish manner." His
routine details the struggles he
faced in childhood, school and
even in romance. His brandished
dialogue of racial satire reveals
much about this quietly emotional
man who uses real-life experiences
to make people laugh.
Life wasn't always easy for com
edian Damon Wayans, who grew
up very poor in Harlem. "We were
so poor we laughed instead of
eating" Wayans says of his past.
This ability to see the humor in
the pain of his everyday life com
bined with a lot of hard work made

success possible.
He gave up his day job in the
Paramount Pictures mailroom for
roles in "Roxanne," "Colors,"
"Hollywood Shuffle," "Punchline"
and the soon to be released "Earth
Girls," a Julian Temple film.
Wayans' latest efforts are in the
MGM/UA release, "I'm Gonna Git
You Sucka," which is described as
a parody of the "blaxploitation
films of the '705." The comedian
has a supporting role as a thug
with a fondness for escaping the
forces of good by tumbling down
the nearest staircase.

Damon Wayans performs Satur
day, Feb. 4 at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. Tickets are $10 with
Stanford ID, $12 for the general
public and $9 each with a group
of eight or more. Tickets are avail
able at the Tresidder Ticket Office.
