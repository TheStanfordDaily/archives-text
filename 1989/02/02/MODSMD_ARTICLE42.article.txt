# Honest billing: 'Heat' is hot
## 
### Alex Kostich Staff writer 
San Francisco's independent
film maker Rob Nilsson deserves
kudos for his latest production,
the emotionally charged "Heat
and Sunlight." Taking place dur
ing the last 16 hours of a love
affair, the movie explores themes
of jealousy and obsession, and
it blends sex with violence in a
subtle but disconcerting manner.
It is one of the most brave, yet
exhilarating, cinematic achieve
ments in several years.
Nilsson also acts in the star
ring role as Mel Hurley, a pho
tographer about to turn 40 and
lose his longtime lover in the
same week. The woman, a
modern dance choreographer
named Carmen, has recently be

come involved with a dance part
ner.
Angry, brooding and frustrat
ed, Hurley is nevertheless hurt
as he stares at his walls, which
are covered with photographs of
the enigmatic Carmen. In a pas
sionate outburst, he storms into
her apartment and confronts her
(after throwing out her new
boyfriend). The climax and res
olution of the film take place on
the floor of Carmen's unfur
nished apartment, in a thrilling
and disturbing episode of violent
passion.
Nilsson brings raw intensity
and a haunting obsessiveness to
his role as Mel Hurley, and is
downright frightening when he
goes near-mad over Carmen.
Consuelo Faust, a San Francisco
choreographer, plays Carmen

with just the right touch of in
difference combined with in
nocence. She is affectionate and
patient in her scenes with
Nilsson, but it is always clear
that she is ready to break apart.
The closest one can come to
describing this movie is to label
it a cross between "9 1/2 Weeks"
and "Blue Velvet." Although it
lacks the visual style of the
former and the exaggerated
brutality of the latter, it never
theless captures a sense of im
mediate reality. The hand-held
camera makes the viewer feel like
a Peeping Tom as it pries into
the personal lives of this ther
monuclear couple.
"Heat and Sunlight" is a stun
ning, careful work destined to
linger in the minds of those gutsy
enough to see it.
