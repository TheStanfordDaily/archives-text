Watching Pedro Almodovar's
"Women on the Verge of a Nervous
Breakdown" is like eating a Bacon
Double Cheesburger — the name
sounds fantastic, but the actual
event is little more than enjoyably
filling.
The Spanish farce has a plot as
intricate and complex as 1986's
"Ruthless People." It centers
around Pepa, a would-be actress
who finds out that her lover has
left her (via his message on her
answering machine). What follows
is difficult to describe, but it in
volves three more women of the
title, some Shiite terrorists, a
feminist psychiatrist and spiked
gazpacho.
The ingredients of "Women on
the Verge" promise wild and brash
slapstick comedy. Instead, director
Pedro Almodovar goes for a more
subtle touch. His entire film, in
cluding the climactic car chase and

shootout, is a medium paced,
gentle farce bathed in pastel colors
and Spanish torch songs.
Although this technique is dis
appointing at first, one becomes
accustomed to it and finds its af
tertaste lingering long after the film
is over. Had "Women on the Verge"

been a wild, out-of-control sex
comedy, it would have been
quickly forgotten in the muddle of
the genre. Almodovar's approach
sets the film apart from the rest,
while remaining light and airy.
Carmen Maura, Spain's hottest
discovery since the other Carmen

(Miranda, folks — the one who
dances with fruit on her head),
plays Pepa with the perfect amount
of controlled rage and desperation.
She manages to look bedraggled
and sexy at the same time, and
she truly seems to be on the verge
of a nervous breakdown.

Julietta Serrano and Rossy
DePalma play other vengeful
women out to wreak havoc on the
man who double-crossed them.
They almost steal the show from
Maura. DePalma, whose crooked,
asymmetrical face resembles an
abstract painting, provides most of
the laughs as she overdoses on the
spiked gazpacho. Serrano is
delightful as well, looking like she
might have wandered in off the
set of "Hairspray" with her beehive
hairdo and polyester suits.
The key to the film's title is
"Verge." Nothing is ever out of
control, but it is just about to fall
over the edge. The characters are
on the verge of a nervous break
down, and the film is on the verge
of being pretty wild.
