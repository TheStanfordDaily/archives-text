# Artist has loonie fun with Branner audience
## 
### Mike Seaman 
Animating his audience with an on-the
spot drawing of Fred Flintstone and video
clips featuring his recent work for the Sat
urday morning cartoon "Completely Mental
Misadventures of Ed Grimley," George
Evelyn entertained a group of about 50
students in the Branner Hall lounge last
night with his insider's perspective of the
cartoon profession.
Evelyn, an animation director and desig
ner whose first experience with popular
animation was as an artist for the ever
popular "Flintstones" cartoons, called his
form of expression "an abstraction of real
life through exagerration and simplifica
tion."
"The best thing about animation is that
it is arty and fun, but also blue-collar, as
you can just get into it and knock some
thing out," Evelyn said.
He proceeded to exhibit the artistic and
fun aspects of animation by showing his
clips ranging from "Rice Krispies" com

mercials to Prince's partially-animated
video "Raspberry Beret."
Noting that computer technology has sig
nificantly influenced current animation
techniques, Evelyn maintained that
animation has not drastically changed as
it has developed over the years.
Rather, he referred to the evolution of
his profession as a "transgenerational proc
ess" in which "different people are doing
the same things."
Evelyn pointed out that "a resurgence
of animation," spurred by the success of
last summer's blockbuster film "Who
Framed Roger Rabbit?" makes today a
promising time for aspiring cartoon artists.
His own journey into the industry began
when he read a simple book on animation,
he told the students.
As animation director and designer for
Colossal Pictures, Evelyn's work has ap
peared in various commercials, television
show openings and short promotional spots
for the Nickelodeon and MTV cable sta
tions.
