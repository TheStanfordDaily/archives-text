Nearly 150 Stanford students were captivated last
night by not just any card-carrying member of the
American Civil Liberties Union — but the organi
zation's ringleader.
"I have to show you. There really is a card,"
proclaimed ACLU Executive Director Ira Glasser,
who spoke for close to an hour in Kresge Auditorium
in a talk punctuated with humor as well as serious
discussion.
Glasser warned that political attacks levied
against his organization during the recent presiden
tial election were part of a "cultural war in this
country, a war about what really our traditional
values are."
According to Glasser, the current popularity of
groups like the Moral Majority provided an atmos
phere in which then-Presidential candidate George
Bush could profit from railing against the ACLU.
Glasser said that the attacks demonstrated how
little people know about what the ACLU actually
does. He emphasized that the ACLU defends tradi
tional American values by enforcing the Bill of
Rights.
