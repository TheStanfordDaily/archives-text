# ACLU director describes new 'cultural war'
## 
### Kaoul Mowatt 
Nearly 150 Stanford students were captivated last
night by not just any card-carrying member of the
American Civil Liberties Union — but the organi
zation's ringleader.
"I have to show you. There really is a card,"
proclaimed ACLU Executive Director Ira Glasser,
who spoke for close to an hour in Kresge Auditorium
in a talk punctuated with humor as well as serious
discussion.
Glasser warned that political attacks levied
against his organization during the recent presiden
tial election were part of a "cultural war in this
country, a war about what really our traditional
values are."
According to Glasser, the current popularity of
groups like the Moral Majority provided an atmos
phere in which then-Presidential candidate George
Bush could profit from railing against the ACLU.
Glasser said that the attacks demonstrated how
little people know about what the ACLU actually
does. He emphasized that the ACLU defends tradi
tional American values by enforcing the Bill of
Rights.

last night.
Because this leads the ACLU to
champion such unpopular groups
as pornographers and neo-Nazis,
the organization becomes an easy
target of those advocating a
return to morals.
Glasser said those Americans
who are seeking a return to
morality are frightened by soci
ety's advances. "It used to be their
country. They used to own it, and
they wanted the right to own it
again. And that's what they meant
by restoring traditional values."
Glasser said these conflicts are
rooted in a historical tension be
tween the founding principles of
United States: democracy and
liberty. "Those two ideas are not
the same, although we tend to
think of them as synonyms .. .
But in fact, in some ways, they
are opposites," he said.
"When I speak of liberty as the
most traditional of our values and
when I marvel at the way in which

Ronald Reagan and Ed Meese op
pose . . . the Bill of Rights as a
part of an attempt to restore
traditional values, it is an aston
ishing thing," Glasser said.
"Because in this country . . . the
more traditional you get ... the
more you land right in middle of
the concept of the Bill of Rights."
Glasser further asserted that
until organizations like the ACLU
were founded the promise of
liberty for all went unfulfilled.
"The people who needed the Bill
of Rights most were disabled from
getting into court to ask a court
to protect their rights."
Since then, through protest
movements and precedent-setting
cases, the ACLU and similar or-

ganizations have sparked a num
ber of fundamental changes in
U.S. society, Glasser said.
"One hundred and seventy
years after the Bill of Rights was
passed, more and more people . . .
came into court and asked a
simple question: 'Does that law
apply toward me?' " Glasser said.
He added that Americans are
raised to think "democratically,"
but often people don't understand
the concept of liberty.
Glasser explained: "There are
certain zones of autonomy that
no government can take away,
even if it is elected democraticaJ-
