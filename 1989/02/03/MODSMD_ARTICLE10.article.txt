# Correction

### 
An article in Monday's Daily
incorrectly identified Stanford's
Office of Management and Budget
as planning to reduce the number
of unregistered cats on campus.
The Office of Operations and
Maintenance is overseeing that
plan.
Due to incorrect police reports,
The Daily misspelled the name of
William Duffey in a story yester
day.
