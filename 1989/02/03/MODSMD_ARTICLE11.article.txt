# Choosing to heal the masses
## Panelists discuss national health care rationing system 
### Willie Colon 
Should adequate medical care
for the masses be a higher social
priority than expensive life
preserving treatments for the
few?
The answer to this painful
question may be a system of
rationing, in which physicians
are forced to choose when to
prolong life for premature in
fants and the elderly, concluded
a panel of medical experts who
spoke at Fairchild Auditorium
Wednesday night.
One panelist argued that the
needs of the few must be
weighed against the needs of the
many. Ernie Young, a senior lec
turer in medical ethics and
chaplain for the Stanford Med
ical Center, cited a case in
Oregon in which the state
legislature denied organ trans
plants to a group of 34 patients
so that 1,500 patients without
basic medical coverage could be
treated.
Such choices, Young pre
dicted, "will be the shape of
things to come, and I believe
this trend makes sense morally,
medically and economically."

But even if fewer people are
given high-tech care, the eco
nomic dilemma will remain, said
Dr. Alan Garber, an assistant
professor of medicine.
"We must find ways to control
expenditures while continuing
to provide adequate care for
those who most need it," Garber
said. Like Young, Garber said
some rationing is needed, but
admitted that physicians have
a hard time accepting this no
tion.
Although Dr. Walter Bortz, a
clinical associate professor of
medicine, agreed that rationing
is threatening, he said doctors
are close to devising a sensible
method of doing so.
He said doctors must look at
a patient's clinical circum
stances, the desires of patients
and their families, and the
quality of life that treatment
would provide. Only then should
economics be considered, he
said.
However, rationing could be
made superfluous if doctors
would re-evaluate the effective
ness of routine procedures, ac
cording to Dr. John Bunker, a
professor of health research and

'We must utilize in
tensive care in a ra
tional manner..
— Ronald Ariagno

policy.
"We don't understand
whether routine things work or
not," Bunker said. He contended
that physicians could save
money by eliminating proce
dures that do not work and
reallocate those funds to pay for
high-tech treatments.
Dr. Ronald Ariagno, a
pediatrics professor, noted that
doctors use intensive care auto
matically in any life-threatening
situation.
"We must utilize intensive
care in a rational manner and
not do it just because it's there
to be done," he cautioned.
The discussion was sponsored
by the Stanford University Med
ical Center, the city of Palo Alto
and the Palo Alto Medical Foun
dation.
