## Senate rejects pay raise House likely to let raise pass, then vote to reduce 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Senate last night voted to reject
a proposed 51 percent congres
sional pay raise, but Speaker Jim
Wright said the House would let
it take effect next week and then
vote to reduce it to "a decent
raise" of 30 percent.
The Senate voted 95-5 to reject
the raise for Congress and other
top federal officials, and to change
the law to eliminate current pro
cedures which allow a pay in
crease to take effect without a
vote.
Then, the Senate gave voice vote
approval to legislation to ban
members from pocketing speaking
fees or other honoraria, should
the pay raise take effect.
Five senators voted against the
package to eliminate the
currently-proposed pay increase,
to roll back the pay raise if the
deadline is missed by the House,
and to require votes on all future
pay raises. They were Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn.; Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass.; Spark Matsunaga, D-
Hawaii; Frank Murkowski, R-
Alaska; and Ted Stevens, R-
Alaska.
The final joint resolution was
approved by a voice vote.

The vote against the pay in
crease was lopsided but largely
symbolic, since both chambers
must vote to block it. House pro
cedures make it easier to protect
a pay raise in that chamber, and
Wright, D-Texas, continued as the
main target of opponents as he
maneuvered to protect most of
the raise.
House members' public posi
tions, like those of the Senate,
have been overwhelmingly against
the 51 percent pay increase, which
must be disapproved by both
chambers before Feb. 8 or it will
automatically take effect.
But Wright said yesterday a
"clear majority" of members, now
paid $89,500, privately supported
his plan for dodging a pre-deadline
vote and then voting a partial rol
lback of the raise along with a
ban on honoraria.
However, the restrictive par
liamentary procedure planned by
the speaker requires a tough two
thirds vote before the bill could
be sent to the Senate. The 51 per
cent raise above the current
$89,500 salary would remain in
effect unless both chambers
agreed to cut it back, and House
opponents vowed to roll it back

to zero whether Wright wins or
loses.
"It would be very difficult for
the speaker to find two-thirds for
this resolution," said Rep. Tom
Tauke, R-lowa, even though
Wright's tactic would force pay
raise opponents to appear to be
voting to protect the full pay in
crease.
Wright released partial results
of a personal questionnaire,
showing 57 percent of House
members opposing a pay raise
vote before the deadline and 54
percent favoring instead a vote to
reduce the raise to 30 percent.
The $26,850 pay raise he was
proposing was "a decent raise but
not an exorbitant raise," Wright
said, compared with the $45,500
increase proposed by former Pres
ident Reagan and endorsed by
President Bush.
The 30 percent figure was equal
to the amount of income House
members could lose in a ban on
honoraria. The Senate figure is
$35,800, as they are currently al
lowed to retain honoraria equal
to 40 percent of their salaries.
House members would still
make the same amount of money
they make now, he said.
