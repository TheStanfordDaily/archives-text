# Record cold wave blasts Midwest, East
## 
### 
The February Freeze spread yesterday to
New England and the mid-Atlantic states,
while dangerous wind chills lingered in the
nation's heartland and Northwest, endanger
ing livestock and crops and making venturing
outside hazardous.
A band of freezing rain extended from Texas
to New England; heavy snow was reported in
parts of the central Rockies; and wind-chill
readings hit 75 below or lower in parts of
Montana, the Dakotas and Wyoming.
The cold and snow led to a short workday
for state workers in Montana, unexpected
school and university holidays in several states
and highway accidents. Ranchers reported that
newborn calves were dying in the cold, and
citrus growers took precautions to keep the
deep freeze from harming their crops.
The misery stemmed from an ocean of cold
air that poured down from Alaska early in
the week, after a shift in the jet stream. By
midday yesterday, its effects in the Lower 48
were being felt across a vast, roughly trian
gular area from the Pacific Northwest to
Texas to New England, areas that had enjoyed

in many cases their warmest January in years.
Bostonians enjoyed a record-high 66 degrees
Wednesday. Twenty-four hours later, the city
shivered in 31-degree air, and light freezing
rain was falling.
In Montana, which continued to post the
lowest temperatures outside Alaska, Gov. Stan
Stephens sent all non-essential state workers
home yesterday. The capital, Helena, grappled
not only with the bitter cold but with a train
derailment and explosion that forced the
evacuation of thousands of people and dis
rupted electrical power.
Montana's two largest universities shut
down through the weekend.
"It's not the cold, because we've been open
in much colder weather," said Bill Tietz, pres
ident of Montana State University at
Bozeman. "It's the wind chill we're concerned
about."
Classes were canceled at many South
Dakota schools because of the wind chill and
blowing snow. Schools also were closed North
Dakota, Oregon and elsewhere.
Temperatures overnight dipped to .34 below

in three Montana towns: Great Falls, Lewis
town, and Cut Bank; and their wind-chill read
ings were as low as 78 below. In Billings, the
record low for a Feb. 2 used to be 13 degrees
below zero; on Thursday, it went to 28 below,
and 13 below wasn't even expected to be the
high for the day.
Record lows for the date also were posted
in Astoria, Ore., with 18 above; Casper, VVyo.,
27 below; and Sheridan, Wyo., 28 below.
But temperature records at the other end
of the scale, though not so widespread as on
Wednesday, also were racked up Thursday.
Places with record highs or ties for the date
included Asheville, N.C., 76 degrees; Cape
Hatteras, N.C., 74; Charlotte, N.C., 79; Chat
tanooga, Tenn., 74; Norfolk, Va.; Richmond,
Va., 77; and Wilmington, N.C., 80.
In Alaska, temperatures remained in the
cellar near the Canadian border but warmed
up elsewhere. Early yesterday it was 37
degrees at Adak in the Aleutian Islands, and
59 degrees below zero at Northway.
