HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) -
British spymaster Sir William
Samuel Stephenson, the legen
dary "man called Intrepid" whose
vast intelligence web snared Ger
man spies in the United States
during World War 11, died at his
home. He was 93.
Stephenson operated out of
New York during the war and
was given his famous code name
and a virtual carte blanche to con
duct espionage by British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill. He
died on Tuesday and was buried
the next day.
Sources close to him said he
died peacefully at home and had

instructed that his death not be
announced until after his burial.
Stephenson, the son of a lumber
mill owner, was born in Winnipeg,
Canada, in 1896 and became an
engineer. During World War I, he
was a pilot in the Royal Air Force
and shot down 26 German planes.
He became a millionaire in
dustrialist by the age of 30, largely
as a result of inventing in the
1920s a method of sending pic
tures by wire. He made a fortune
through other business ventures
and even found time to win the
world amateur light heavyweight
boxing championship.
But his most famous exploits

came after 1940, when he was
tapped by Churchill to put to
gether the most potent intelligence
network of its kind.
He was sent to New York offi
cially to establish an organization
to protect British shipping during
the war and counter the activities
of Nazi spies. But in fact, the
operation he set up was later ac
knowledged to be the hub of all
the branches of British intelli
gence.
He also was reported to be the
link between Churchill and
Roosevelt in the years before the
United States entered the war.
