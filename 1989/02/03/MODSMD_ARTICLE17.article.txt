## 'rec.speech.free' 
### 
EVERY DAY at Stanford we
feel the results of a great
expansion in information
technology. But the development
of new forms of expression does
not alter the basic principles of
free speech.
Imagine the furor if the Stan
ford library system discontinued
a subscription to a humor mag
azine because a few members of
the campus community found it
offensive. The action of Academic
Information Resources in deny
ing the news group "rec.hu
mor.funny" access to Stanford is
equivalent, and should meet with
an equivalent degree of censure.
In the past, the University has
treated forms of speech that ha
rass individuals or incite and in
flame bigotry on campus some
what differently from others. But
the jokes on an electronic bulletin
board did not meet either of those
criteria.
The jokes on the newsgroup
carried headers that made their
content clear. Although they were

encoded, they could be decoded
by pressing two keys on the
user's terminal.
And many of them did not
make fun of specific groups, but
instead instructed users to sub
stitute their "favorite" group.
And finally, most of the jokes can
only be described as stupid and
rather un-"funny."
None of this justifies humor
based on stereotypes, or explains
why so many computer scientists
would subscribe to news groups
like "rec.humor.funny."
But a university must be, if
anything, more committed to up
holding the fundamental principle
of free speech than other insti
tutions in our society.
Gorin has justified the censor
ship on the grounds that the
news group itself was censored
by its "moderator," who would
not permit comment on the jokes.
But as we all learned in kinder
garten, two wrongs don't make
a right.
