# Your brother's keeper?

SEVERAL STANFORD ad
ministrators and students
bit their nails earlier this
week in anticipation of the Inter
fraternity Council's judiciary
board decision on the Sigma Chi
flier. And while their nails may
be worse for wear, the Stanford
community's anxiety proved un
necessary. The judiciary board
handled its first test case ad
mirably.
In agreeing to hear the case,
the board placed itself in a diffi
cult position. Would it come down
hard on the Sigma Chis to assert
its authority, to show Greeks
won't be lax when dealing with

their own?
Or would the board let the
Sigma Chis off easy, in protest
of the ridiculous nature of the
offense and as a show of inde
pendence from the University?
The board's decision, which
recommended that the Sigma
Chis be placed on one-month so
cial probation and work to edu
cate fraternities on flier policy,
aptly balanced the severity of the
punishment with the Sigma Chis'
"crime."
Furthermore, the decision
points to the need for Residential
Education to establish a policy
on acceptable fliers.
