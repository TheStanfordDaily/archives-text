# New marks from Engels
## Hoover archivists uncover original manuscripts

"Demonstrations are excellent things,
but only when we have nothing better to
do," wrote Freidrich Engels in a 1893 letter
recently discovered in the Hoover Institu
tion archives.
The letter is one of four documents hand
written by Enge's that Hoover archivists
stumbled upon while cataloging an impor
tant collection of Russian and Soviet his
torical documents.
Engels was a long-time collaborator of
Karl Marx and an influential German
socialist theoretician.
Written in French and German, the
manuscripts are part of a collection ac
quired in 1963 that belonged to Boris
Nicolaevsky, a member of the Menshevik
party during the 1917 Russian Revolution.
After emigrating from the Soviet Union to
the United States, Nicolaevsky established
himself as an authority on Soviet politics.
Hoover archivist Michael Jakobson made
the valuable discovery during a thorough

processing of the collection conducted by
researchers during the past few months.
The documents, written between 1886
and 1893, contain statements illustrating
Engels' commitment to the electoral proc
ess.
"The importance of May Day," Engels
wrote in 1893, "will be eclipsed during the
course of the year by that of general elec
tions where the proletariat will be called
upon to conquer new positions, and where,
without any doubt, it will conquer them."
Charles Palm, associate director for Hoo
ver Library and Archives, said the most
significant of the four documents is the
handwritten manuscript for a pamphlet
tracing the history of the English Chartist
movement, a working-class crusade for so
cial reform during the 1830 sand 1840s.
Engels' handwritten portions of the
newly-found document confirm previous
speculation that Engels had co-authored
the anonymously-published
pamphlet with German-American
socialist Hermann Schluter, said
Hoover archivist Dale Reed.
Nicolaevsky and the late Hoover
archivist Anna Bourgina knew
that the collection contained doc
uments handwritten by Engels.
Nonetheless, until the recent com
pletion of the final processing, the
content and significance of the
documents was unknown.
According to Palm, the find will
not "bring tons of scholars to the
institution right away," but it is
significant because "there are not
that many places where Engels
documents reside."
Because the content of the doc
uments is "in conformity with
other of Engels' opinions that
were already known," Reed said
the interpretation of history will
not change as a result of the dis
covery.
The Marx-Engels Institution in
East Germany has been notified
of the find.
