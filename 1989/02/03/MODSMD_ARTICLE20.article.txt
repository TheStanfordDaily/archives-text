## Diversity, not separation 
### 
Racial segregation is alive
and growing on campus.
But, strangely enough, the im
petus behind this trend toward
separatism is pressure from minority
groups.
Many student groups have been turning
up the pressure on the University in an
effort to further splinter the housing sys
tem along ethnic and racial lines.
In this divisive spirit, the Students of
Color Coalition recently demanded that
the University end the requirement that
Ujamaa house no more than 50 percent
black residents.
Apparently the Coalition would have
Ujamaa become an all-black oasis.
This demand is but a single case of a
trend toward division rather than inclu
sion in undergraduate housing and on
the campus as a whole.
The question really is how you define
a "diverse" campus. For some, it seems
diversity translates as xenophobic group
ings of races and ethnicities, each in their
own residence on campus.
The true goal of diversity must be de
velopment of a population spread uni
formly throughout the residence system
that learns to live together healthily.
, An analagous trend away from as
similation and toward division occurred
among portions of the 19th century
American black community.
Then, the idea was for free American
blacks — with the help of self-serving
whites who wanted to promote "racial
purity" in America — to colonize western
Africa and create a black nation.
Later, the blacks and whites behind

the movement began to focus on the black
nation of Haiti that gained its indepen
dence as a result of widespread slave
revolts.
Haiti was to become the terminus of
blacks' flight from America and a shining
example of what a black nation could
achieve.
During the rise and decline of this
movement, however, there existed signif
icant numbers of blacks opposed to the
idea of Haiti's repatriation to Africa.
In 1817, a group of free blacks gathered
in Philadelphia to denounce the actions
of the society formed to promote emigra
tion. The Rev. Richard Allen, Absalom
Jones and James Forten were shocked at
the idea that they were considered
Africans.
These men thought of themselves as
Americans, and in their words wanted to
share in"the blessings of her soil."
Another prominent 19th century black,
Frederick Douglass, saw emigration as a
form of segregation, and as an as
similationist was violently opposed to it
The goal for these men was to break
down barriers within American society,
not create tensions by isolating their ra
cial group within carefully guarded
boundaries.
The Coalition's goal is quite the oppo
site. If the Students of Color Coalition
succeeds in twisting the University into
creating further racial separation on
campus, it will serve to formalize the de
facto segregation that now exists.
Just as many blacks today would find
offensive 19th century whites' efforts iu
promote "racial purity" by returning

blacks to Africa, I find the idea of man
dating "ethnic purity" in the university
environment reprehensible.
Much of the racial tension that surfaces
every year on campus is the fault of this
splintering of the community into black
and white, Chicano/Latino and Asian-
American, American Indian and Native
Hawaiian.
After all, the point of having diversity
at Stanford is for different people to in
teract at the social and residential level
in the hope that appreciation for each
other will result.
This ideal will never occur if students
of different ethnicities don't even live to
gether, and only interact on a level of
racial hostility and anger.
The hardening of existing social and
residential lines demarcating separate
races and ethnicities can only bring more
friction to an environment that already
is dominated by hypersensitivity and ten
sion in interracial relations.
Many 19th century anti-emigrationists
fought for the ideal of coexistence, not
separation . . . and we should continue
their struggle.
