## Ujamaa staff not to blame for fall racist incidents 
### 
I HAVE BEEN APPALLED at the
arrogance and insensitivity which
some members of the Stanford
community have displayed towards the
residents and staff of Ujamaa House.
Robert Weiss' Jan. 31 letter, in which
he blames the Ujamaa staff for the
racist incidents in the fall, was both
insensitive and unfair.
Weiss writes, "The culprit of the
incident at the Ujamaa House last fall
was not any of the young people whose
conduct was examined in such exqui
site detail in the fact-finding report. It
is, rather, the functioning of those
responsible for the house." Weiss seems
to have overlooked the fact that it was
not the staff that went around tacking
up racist and insulting fliers.
Would he say that the staff of Toyon
Hall was at fault and had created a

divisive environment when racist fliers
from the White Aryan Resistance
appeared in their dorm last quarter?
Would Weiss criticize last year's
Otero House staff for creating an
environment that forced a drunk stu
dent to vandalize his dorm and forced
the Phi Delts to react with a silent
vigil? It is not the staffs fault if some
one decides to air his or her racist
views.
As someone who participated in
Frosh Orientation, I witnessed the staff
making numerous efforts to create a
welcoming environment for everyone in
the dorm, both white and black.
Following all of the press attention
regarding Ujamaa, the resident fellow,
staff and many residents wrote letters
to The Daily condemning the events

but also expressing support for each
other and concern for their dorm.
Many Ujamaa residents, both black and
white, told me that they were reluctant
to make any statements to the public
for fear that their comments would be
misconstrued and ultimately end in a
criticism of the dorm, which is exactly
what is happening now.
Efforts to rebuild dorm unity have
been painstakingly slow, partly because
of the microscope that the community
has been placed under.
Unfortunately, more and more the
Ujamaa staff and residents are being
victimized again by criticism from
people who weren't even there. It is
easy to read a report three months
after the fact and play "armchair
quarterback", second guessing the
staff, residents and the Black Student

Union on what they "should" have
done. It is another thing to be in the
middle of a painful and stressful situa
tion and have to react at the time.
The events in Ujamaa raise a num
ber of issues which have yet to be
addressed. Instead of laying unfair
criticisms on Ujamaa, the dialogue
should now focus on how Stanford is
going to educate people so that this
type of thing does not happen again.
Staff in all residences deserve to be
well trained so that they can be
prepared to react in case they are
unfortunately faced with a similar
situation in the future.
