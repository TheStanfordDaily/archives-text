# Macintoshes are being distributed to groups fairly

I write in response to The Daily's
Jan. 27 editorial, "Life in the orchard."
I would like to give the view from
Academic Information Resources on
the subject of the computerization of
the campus that The Daily referred to
in this editorial.
First, we have already given particu
lar consideration to the issue that The
Daily raises regarding the equitable
distribution of technology. This past
fall, Macintosh computers were pro
vided to community centers (the Black
Community Services Center, El Centro
Chicano, the Native American Cultural
Center, the Asian American Activities
Center, the Women's Center, the Dis-

ablilty Resource Center and the Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Community
Center) through AIR and the Associate
Dean of Students for Student Affairs.
Although we don't claim that this
has achieved the "equitable distribu
tion" called for in the editorial, our
actions are evidence that we have
begun effective movement in this direc
tion, some months in advance of The
Daily's attention.
Also, although Macintosh is the pre
dominant computer on campus, there
has not been any "University decision
to make the campus all-Macintosh." We
intend to continue our vigorous support
for the Macintosh environment. How
ever, in a university as complex as
Stanford, we would be unwise to make
the campus all-anything.
We will continue to evaluate and
invest in products from IBM, Next,
Digital Equipment Corporation, Sun
Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, AT&T,
MIPS and other vendors. We will con

tinue to employ those products which
appear best suited to meet the varied
requirements of the Stanford academic
community.
