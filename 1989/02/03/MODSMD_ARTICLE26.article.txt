# Students fight for educational rights
## 
### Rhett Reese 
To some students, recent
events at Stanford serve as
reminders that nationwide in
stitutional racism exists, and
that few people seem prepared
to acknowledge or confront
failings at the educational level.
In light of the October
defacement of posters at
Ujamaa House and last year's
Western Culture debate, the
newly-formed ASSU Commit
tee on Democracy in Education
has spearheaded efforts to ad
dress issues of educational
rights on campus.
The question of democracy
in education has long been a
concern of students of color or
ganizations. Last year, this
question prompted the
formation of the Students
United for a Democratic Edu
cation which, under this year's
Council of Presidents, has
evolved into the Committee on
Democracy in Education, an
ASSU special task-force com
mittee devoted solely to educa
tional concerns.
Issues addressed by the com
mittee this year include the
need for better recruitment and
retention of minority students
and the demand for a relevant
multi-cultural curriculum. The
group is also working toward
fairer systems of tenure and
financial aid.
The committee was estab
lished, according to co-chair
Kathleen Coll, to "make
education more relevant to a
changing society." More specif

ically, Coll said, the committee
aims to deal with concerns of
the student body and increase
student awareness of educa
tional rights.
Since it was formed in Sep
tember, the committee's mem
bership has grown to nearly 40
students.
To increase efficiency, the
committee late last quarter
split into two smaller work
groups, one dedicated to the
promotion of ethnic studies,
the other designed to address
student concerns about recent
teaching assistant budget cuts.
As their first project, the eth
nic studies sub-committee
coordinated a series of
cross-campus dorm discussions
to facilitate dialogues on racism
and its links to education.
Sophomore Hilary Skillings,
co-chair of the ethnic studies
group, said organized dorm dis
cussions often help students
"talk about the fear of talking,"
providing a peaceful atmos
phere through which individ
uals can air issues they may
have previously found uncom
fortable to confront.
According to Skillings, dorm
discussions have helped not
only participating students but
also the committee's leader
ship. The group discovered that
students are often ignorant of
the issues, and base opinions
on emotional responses rather
than facts, she said.
According to Coll, students
have shown a "genuine desire
