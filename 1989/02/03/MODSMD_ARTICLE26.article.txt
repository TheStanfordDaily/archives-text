# Students fight for educational rights
## 
### Rhett Reese 
To some students, recent
events at Stanford serve as
reminders that nationwide in
stitutional racism exists, and
that few people seem prepared
to acknowledge or confront
failings at the educational level.
In light of the October
defacement of posters at
Ujamaa House and last year's
Western Culture debate, the
newly-formed ASSU Commit
tee on Democracy in Education
has spearheaded efforts to ad
dress issues of educational
rights on campus.
The question of democracy
in education has long been a
concern of students of color or
ganizations. Last year, this
question prompted the
formation of the Students
United for a Democratic Edu
cation which, under this year's
Council of Presidents, has
evolved into the Committee on
Democracy in Education, an
ASSU special task-force com
mittee devoted solely to educa
tional concerns.
Issues addressed by the com
mittee this year include the
need for better recruitment and
retention of minority students
and the demand for a relevant
multi-cultural curriculum. The
group is also working toward
fairer systems of tenure and
financial aid.
The committee was estab
lished, according to co-chair
Kathleen Coll, to "make
education more relevant to a
changing society." More specif

ically, Coll said, the committee
aims to deal with concerns of
the student body and increase
student awareness of educa
tional rights.
Since it was formed in Sep
tember, the committee's mem
bership has grown to nearly 40
students.
To increase efficiency, the
committee late last quarter
split into two smaller work
groups, one dedicated to the
promotion of ethnic studies,
the other designed to address
student concerns about recent
teaching assistant budget cuts.
As their first project, the eth
nic studies sub-committee
coordinated a series of
cross-campus dorm discussions
to facilitate dialogues on racism
and its links to education.
Sophomore Hilary Skillings,
co-chair of the ethnic studies
group, said organized dorm dis
cussions often help students
"talk about the fear of talking,"
providing a peaceful atmos
phere through which individ
uals can air issues they may
have previously found uncom
fortable to confront.
According to Skillings, dorm
discussions have helped not
only participating students but
also the committee's leader
ship. The group discovered that
students are often ignorant of
the issues, and base opinions
on emotional responses rather
than facts, she said.
According to Coll, students
have shown a "genuine desire
to understand better what stu
dents of color are fighting for, arid
why they are fighting."
Sophomore Sofia Sorensen, co
chair of the ethnic studies sub
committee, said discussions have
served as outlets to ease racial
tension, and have led many stu
dents to make better informed de
cisions about their beliefs. %
Aside from dorm discussions,
the ethnic studies sub-committee
continues to stress the importance
of follow-up with regard to CIV
and the hiring of more faculty of
color to help implement desired
change. They have also distrib
uted fliers advertising courses in
ethnic studies.
The TA sub-committee, led by
juniors David Brown, a COP
member, and Katherine Van
Uum, has begun an investigation
into the effects of recent TA
budget cutbacks in the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
According to Brown, the cuts
have left many students fearful
that the general quality of educa
tion might suffer.
In meeting with department
chairs, the group has found that
more often than not, budget cuts
translate into fewer and larger
class discussion sections, with
fewer TAs readily available to aid
students, Brown said.
Brown stressed that there "has
to be some pressure" on the Uni
versity if TA cutbacks are to be
rescinded. The group met with
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Ewart Thomas to express its con

cerns, and has begun to take up
action in the interests of the stu
dent body.
Sub-committee members have
distributed fliers in dormitories
and written letters to The Daily,
as well as written a petition that
will soon circulate across campus
stating certain student demands,
Brown said.
According to Brown, members
of the committee have also con
sidered the possibility of sending
a letter to Stanford parents de
scribing the results of TA budget
cuts and urging parents to put
pressure on the University for
change.
Besides the TA and ethnic
studies issues, the committee has
also investigated questions con
cerning the advising system and
the reinstatement of the F grade.
Although the committee has es
tablished its own identity this
year, its members are quick to
acknowledge the fact that they
are working strictly in what
Sorensen calls "coalition" with
other campus groups.
Along with ties to the ASSU,
the committee has kept in close
contact with students of color or
ganizations, consulting an advi
sory board of educational
representatives from these organ
izations, and seeking assistance
in leading campus-wide dorm dis
cussions, she said.
Because the committee is offi
cially tied to this year's ASSU and
COP , its exact future beyond the
spring elections is uncertain.
However, Brown said he hopes it
will remain part of the ASSU,
which effectively "adds a sense of
legitmacy" to the group's actions.

will remain part of the ASSU,
which effectively "adds a sense of
legitmacy" to the group's actions.
To some students, recent
events at Stanford serve as
reminders that nationwide in
stitutional racism exists, and
that few people seem prepared
to acknowledge or confront
failings at the educational level.
In light of the October
defacement of posters at
Ujamaa House and last year's
Western Culture debate, the
newly-formed ASSU Commit
tee on Democracy in Education
has spearheaded efforts to ad
dress issues of educational
rights on campus.
The question of democracy
in education has long been a
concern of students of color or
ganizations. Last year, this
question prompted the
formation of the Students
United for a Democratic Edu
cation which, under this year's
Council of Presidents, has
evolved into the Committee on
Democracy in Education, an
ASSU special task-force com
mittee devoted solely to educa
tional concerns.
Issues addressed by the com
mittee this year include the
need for better recruitment and
retention of minority students
and the demand for a relevant
multi-cultural curriculum. The
group is also working toward
fairer systems of tenure and
financial aid.
The committee was estab
lished, according to co-chair
Kathleen Coll, to "make
education more relevant to a
changing society." More specif

ically, Coll said, the committee
aims to deal with concerns of
the student body and increase
student awareness of educa
tional rights.
Since it was formed in Sep
tember, the committee's mem
bership has grown to nearly 40
students.
To increase efficiency, the
committee late last quarter
split into two smaller work
groups, one dedicated to the
promotion of ethnic studies,
the other designed to address
student concerns about recent
teaching assistant budget cuts.
As their first project, the eth
nic studies sub-committee
coordinated a series of
cross-campus dorm discussions
to facilitate dialogues on racism
and its links to education.
Sophomore Hilary Skillings,
co-chair of the ethnic studies
group, said organized dorm dis
cussions often help students
"talk about the fear of talking,"
providing a peaceful atmos
phere through which individ
uals can air issues they may
have previously found uncom
fortable to confront.
According to Skillings, dorm
discussions have helped not
only participating students but
also the committee's leader
ship. The group discovered that
students are often ignorant of
the issues, and base opinions
on emotional responses rather
than facts, she said.
According to Coll, students
have shown a "genuine desire
to understand better what stu
dents of color are fighting for, arid
why they are fighting."
Sophomore Sofia Sorensen, co
chair of the ethnic studies sub
committee, said discussions have
served as outlets to ease racial
tension, and have led many stu
dents to make better informed de
cisions about their beliefs. %
Aside from dorm discussions,
the ethnic studies sub-committee
continues to stress the importance
of follow-up with regard to CIV
and the hiring of more faculty of
color to help implement desired
change. They have also distrib
uted fliers advertising courses in
ethnic studies.
The TA sub-committee, led by
juniors David Brown, a COP
member, and Katherine Van
Uum, has begun an investigation
into the effects of recent TA
budget cutbacks in the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
According to Brown, the cuts
have left many students fearful
that the general quality of educa
tion might suffer.
In meeting with department
chairs, the group has found that
more often than not, budget cuts
translate into fewer and larger
class discussion sections, with
fewer TAs readily available to aid
students, Brown said.
Brown stressed that there "has
to be some pressure" on the Uni
versity if TA cutbacks are to be
rescinded. The group met with
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Ewart Thomas to express its con

cerns, and has begun to take up
action in the interests of the stu
dent body.
Sub-committee members have
distributed fliers in dormitories
and written letters to The Daily,
as well as written a petition that
will soon circulate across campus
stating certain student demands,
Brown said.
According to Brown, members
of the committee have also con
sidered the possibility of sending
a letter to Stanford parents de
scribing the results of TA budget
cuts and urging parents to put
pressure on the University for
change.
Besides the TA and ethnic
studies issues, the committee has
also investigated questions con
cerning the advising system and
the reinstatement of the F grade.
Although the committee has es
tablished its own identity this
year, its members are quick to
acknowledge the fact that they
are working strictly in what
Sorensen calls "coalition" with
other campus groups.
Along with ties to the ASSU,
the committee has kept in close
contact with students of color or
ganizations, consulting an advi
sory board of educational
representatives from these organ
izations, and seeking assistance
in leading campus-wide dorm dis
cussions, she said.
Because the committee is offi
cially tied to this year's ASSU and
COP , its exact future beyond the
spring elections is uncertain.
However, Brown said he hopes it
will remain part of the ASSU,
which effectively "adds a sense of
legitmacy" to the group's actions.
