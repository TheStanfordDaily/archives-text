## Pedaling for philanthropy and pleasure

Dave Gess, a graduate student in
engineering-economic systems, is a veteran
cyclist — he crossed the United States on his
own in the summer of 1987 — so when he
heard the name Bike-Aid he was naturally
intrigued.
Bike-Aid, an annual cross-country bike trip,
allows students to spend their summer enjoy
ing activities like travel and athletics while
at the same time providing valuable public
service.
Although Gess was originally drawn to Bike-
Aid as simply another opportunity for a long
distance journey, he soon became interested
in the reason behind the ride.
The trip is sponsored by the Overseas De
velopment Network, a national organization
whose main function is to raise student aware
ness about the "global environment." One of
the organization's two main offices is located
here at Stanford, the other in Cambridge,
Mass.
According to 1988 Stanford graduate Lea
Schuster, a co-coordinator of the ride, Bike-
Aid's two main functions are to raise money
for the network's other projects and to
heighten awareness about its goals.
The trip sends groups of riders along five
different cross-country routes starting from
Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland
or Austin, Texas.
Now in its fourth year, Bike-Aid begins in
mid-June and ends when all five groups con
verge in Washington, D.C. in the middle of
August.
Two cars accompany each group to carry
supplies as the bikers ride an average of 72
miles daily — roughly eight-to-10 hours of
biking. Riders are housed and fed by residents
of towns along their routes.
Bike-Aid participants must solicit sponsor
ship for their ride in the form of "pledges."
Each individual is expected to raise a total of
one dollar per mile for the 3,600 mile trek.
Since the program began three years ago, 287
riders have raised almost $400,000.
Bike-Aid '89, organized at Stanford by
Schuster and Mary Kroetch, a student at
Hayward State University, is expected to in
clude 100 riders and raise about $300,000.

Sally Kauffman, a graduate student in an
thropology, helped coordinate Bike Aid '88
and was one of about 20 riders, including
Gess, on the route from Seattle to Washington,
D.C.
Although Kauffman was more interested in
the cause than the ride, she says she realized
that she had "traveled around the world but
never seen [her] own country." While she
found the ride physically demanding, she says
the fact that the riders "were out there for
a purpose" bolstered her.
Kauffman says she was surprised that many
of the people the riders met across the country
"were interested and very generous towards
the cause." She recalls the case of a man in
Bowman, N.D. who spontaneously invited her
group to stay the night in his backyard.
Bike-Aid is "an amazing way to see the
country," she says.
Gess mentions a time in Winona, Minn,
when a family on a farm offered the group
lodging at the last minute despite the fact

that their farm was about to be foreclosed.
In Bike-Aid, "idealism meets reality," he
says. On the cross-country trip, "you learn
the reality of people's lives."
In addition to Bike-Aid, the overseas net
work sponsors several other programs for stu
dents aimed at helping to "develop" the third
world.
Among the projects are the Partnership Pro
gram, which links campus groups with third
world communities, and national and inter
national internships for students.
The organization emphasizes "grass roots"
development to help third world communities
develop from the bottom up and become self
sufficient. By making presentations and
leading discussions in towns along the way,
Bike-Aid riders help raise consciousness about
these issues.
Students interested in participating in Bike-
Aid '89 may pick up applications at the Bike-
Aid office in the Old Firehouse. The
application deadline is March 3.

In Bike-Aid, "idealism meets reality," he
says. On the cross-country trip, "you learn
the reality of people's lives."
In addition to Bike-Aid, the overseas net
work sponsors several other programs for stu
dents aimed at helping to "develop" the third
world.
Among the projects are the Partnership Pro
gram, which links campus groups with third
world communities, and national and inter
national internships for students.
The organization emphasizes "grass roots"
development to help third world communities
develop from the bottom up and become self
sufficient. By making presentations and
leading discussions in towns along the way,
Bike-Aid riders help raise consciousness about
these issues.
Students interested in participating in Bike-
Aid '89 may pick up applications at the Bike-
Aid office in the Old Firehouse. The
application deadline is March 3.
