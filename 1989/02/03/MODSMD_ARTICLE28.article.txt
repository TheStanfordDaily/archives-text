# Bug ponders tragic origins of Svengali
## 
### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
First things second. The answer
given to the question about
Rodin's Thinker last week was,
after the first sentence, entirely
serious and based on actual art
history theory.
Now that that's cleared up, let
us consider the earth-shattering
ramifications of the Bug Me
column's move from Tuesday to
Friday.
Now that that's cleared up, let
us remind ourselves that without
your questions there would be no
column, the building would be
poorly supported and eventually
closed because of susceptibility to
earthquake damage.
So for the deity of your choice's
sake, send your queries via Lots
to B.bug-me or drop them off in
the Bug Me box outside the Daily
office.
The Bug is made possible by a
grant from the Ford Foundation
in cooperation with the Corpora
tion for Public Broadcasting. The
paper upon which it is printed is
suitable for framing, fish wrap
ping and birdcage lining.
Dear Bug,
What's a svengali? Is it good to
be one? Is it Swedish?
— Buster Poindexter
Haha, Swedish, sven, I get it.
Very funny. Are you interested in
writing a weekly question-and
answer column for Stanford's
only morning newspaper?
According to Webster's Third
New International Dictionary,

svengali is usu. capitalized and is
a person who "attempts usu. with
evil intentions to persuade or force
another to do his bidding." Con
sidering this dictionary's confu
sion over the meaning of "new",
as manifest in its title, the Bug
thought he oughta check another
source.

So he walked into Palo Alto and
arbitrarily chose a home, resulting
in this definition from Random
House's Dictionary of the English
Language: "a person who com
pletely dominates another," usu.
towards selfish or sinister ends.
The term originated in a late
19th century novel by English
writer and artist George du
Maurier. Webster's refers to the

character, Svengali, as a
"maleficent hypnotist." For more
information on him the Bug con
sulted the fifth edition of the Ox
ford Companion to English
Literature, edited by Margaret
Drabble (no relation to the comic
strip character who appeared in
Seventeen Magazine's Mini Mag).
Du Maurier's novel, "Trilby",
revolves around the title charac
ter, an artist's model who becomes
a famous singer under the
tutelage of Svengali, a German-
Polish musician. When Svengali
dies, Trilby's "voice collapses" and
her career and health quickly
deteriorate.
There seems to be some confu
sion over exactly what a Svengali
ought to be. The Oxford synopsis
mentioned hypnosis and evil
about as often as it mentioned the
innovative design of Luv's new
diaper for boys. However, dic
tionaries are insistent about the
nefarious spellcasting and sinister
intentions of a Svengali.
I suggest you adopt the Bug's
approach to all polysyllabic words
the meanings of which he is not
sure: use them often, and use
them loudly.
Dear Bug,
Why is the Lots tragedy series
— Macßeth, Lear and Hamlet —
so named?
— David Johannsen
Nothing irks the Bug more than
over-eagerness. This question was
submitted by laser printed letter
to the Daily office through Lots,
and then the guy actually called

up to make sure the Bug had
received his question.
If it's that important to you,
find out for yourself.
Who cares, anyways? The sys
tem is tragically flawed and is
being phased out of the University
computer network, in the second
place. And in the first, the tragedy
names are just names. Also, I
think they have something to do
with Shakespeare.
As Gertrude Stein never said,
"A rose by any other name is
known by that other name."
Hell, some people don't even
think Shakespeare wrote so much
as a memo his entire life and that
his works are the product of
Francis Bacon, or Christopher
Marlowe. Why hasn't Stephen
King been considered?
Others say Shakespeare wrote
part of the King James Bible. For
that matter, how do you explain
the fact that Judy Blume is re
sponsible for both "Tales of a
Fourth Grade Nothing" and
"Wifey"?
And why can't James Michener
write a short book? Which came
first, the chicken or the egg? Who
ate all the blue M&M's? In old
books, everyone was always dying
of consumption; why doesn't
anybody die of consumption any
more? One hundred people sur
veyed, top five answers on the
board. . . . Name something you
do to really irritate your room
mate.
But I digress.
Until next week, the Bug has
spoken.
