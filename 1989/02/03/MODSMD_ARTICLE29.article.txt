## Todd the God's explosion damns the Devils 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
TEMPE, Ariz. — "It wasn't
pretty. It wasn't pretty."
Stanford men's basketball
players and coaches chanted those
words like a mantra as they filed
out of the locker room after last
night's 75-60 win over Arizona
State before 3,613 at the Univer
sity Activity Center.

Men's Basketball
Cardinal 75, Sun Devils 60

With the win, the No. 20 Car
dinal moved up to 16-5 overall
and retained its hold on third
place in the Pacific 10 Conference
with an 8-3 mark.
But after making 18 turnovers
and barely outrebounding a team
that was ninth in the Pac-10 in
rebound margin, the Cardinal un
derstands that the team play
could be elevated a notch or 12.
"I'm concerned about us not
preparing ourselves," Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said.
"We're not going to be in the po
sition to win games later on if
we're not better prepared."
Stanford guard Todd Lichti
would agree. He said that the
team didn't seem "mentally ready
to go tonight," and that the
players had to "kind of kick our
selves in the butt" after leading
only 25-21 at halftime.
As for Lichti himself, no jump
start was needed. Lichti scored 17
in the first half, including 11 Car
dinal points in a row, and ended
up with 30 overall in his first
game after being held to 11 during
Stanford's 72-52 loss to Arizona
Sunday.
"In the Arizona game, there
wasn't a lot I could do," Lichti
said. "They were double-teaming
me a lot, and I'd try to kick it
off to other men. . . . Unfortunate
ly, it didn't work.
"It's hard sometimes," Lichti
went on. "You try to do what's
best. ... I feel I've started to get

[my jump shot] back again.
"I just felt more relaxed out
there."
Lichti hadn't been aware he had
also leapt over three players last
night to become the Pac-10's third
all-time leading scorer with 2,102
points. He now trails only UCLA's
Lew Alcindor (Kareem Abdul-
Jabaar) at 2,325 and Arizona's
Sean Elliott at 2,198 entering
tonight's play.
"I'm just concentrating on the
season," Lichti said. "As long as
the team does well, the personal
things will take care of them
selves."
As Stanford is finding out, how
ever, wins don't take care of them
selves. For the first three-fourths
of last night's game, Stanford
struggled against an ASU team
(10-9, 3-7) that was so strapped
by injuries that it started a front
line of an average height of 6-
foot-5V2.
During that time, the Cardinal

exhibited a Mikhail Gorbachev
like control during the first half
— it seemed secure, but you never
knew how long it would last.
After trailing 6-3 with 16:26 to
go in the half, the Cardinal shut
out the Sun Devils for the next
7:40. Of course, since Stanford
only scored nine points itself dur
ing that time — just over a point
a minute — ASU was hardly
buried.
The reason for the slow pace:
turnovers. Brought on in almost
equal parts by hustling defense
(Stanford had 10 steals in the
half) and sloppy ball-handling, the
teams combined for 25 turnovers
in the half — 14 by the Sun
Devils.
It was also not a great shooting
half overall for Stanford, as the
Cardinal shot 39.1 percent (9-for
-23). Stanford guard Terry Taylor
was 0-for-5 in the half, 0-for-4 on

3-pointers.
"[ASU] packed in the zone,"
Montgomery said. "As a result,
we had a lot of perimeter shots,
and they didn't go down. . . .
Terry went 0-for-5; that hurts a
little bit. Anytime they pack it in,
he generally shoots that thing in."
It was still only 36-32 Stanford
with 13:49 left, but the Cardinal
then more than doubled its score
over the remainder of the game,
and ended up shooting 47.4 per
cent overall.
Lichti made the final two points
of a 23-7 run over the next 6:52
to open up a 59-39 lead.
He then left the game for good,
and the star of the show became
ASU's Matt Anderson. The 6-4
guard-turned-small-forward had
only two points in the first half,
but finished with 21.
Card note
Restaurant-of-the-week honors go
to the Arby's in Mesa, down the street
from where the team stayed. After
unlocking its doors at closing time to
fill the ample orders of the hungry
squad Wednesday night, the manager
brought out trays of free sandwiches
and fries to ensure that not one of
the Cardinal (and its entourage) left
without being thouroughly satiated.
