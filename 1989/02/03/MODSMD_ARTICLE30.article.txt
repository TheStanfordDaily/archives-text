# Stanford at Florida
## 
### 
SATURDAY — Television: Nationally on CBS, locally on KPIX (Channel 5).
Radio: KCBS (740 AM) only. 11:00 a.m. (PST) tipoff in Orlando.
RECORDS — Stanford (16-5, 8-3 and 3rd in Pac-10 play, ranked 20th by
AP), Florida (11-9).
SERIES — All time: Teams have met only once, with Stanford winning
80-70 during the 1974-75 season at Maples Pavilion. Common opponents:
Both teams have lost to California and beaten Vanderbilt.
GATOR UPDATE — Florida is having arguably the worst season of any
preseason top-20 pick. Two games ago, the Gators won in magnificent
fashion, however. Trailing Vanderbilt 72-70 with one second left, 7-foot-2
Florida center Dwayne Schintzius was the beneficiary of a two-shot
technical foul after, for the third time this season, opposing fans threw
tennis balls at him. Schintzius, who leads the Gators with 19.7 ppg and
10.5 rpg, made both free throws and the Gators won in overtime. This
game will be the first ever played in the new home of the Orlando Magic,
an NBA expansion team that will enter the league next year.
CARDINAL UPDATE — In non-conference games, Stanford is 8-2. Stanford
is 7-5 overall away from Maples Pavilion, 1-0 on neutral sites. The Cardinal
continues to shoot over 55 percent at home and under 50 percent away.
Todd Lichti, after scoring 30 points last night, moved into third place on
the career scoring list for the Pac-10 and is now the No. 2 scorer all-time
in conference games. Stanford went 7-2 in January.
KEYS TO VICTORY — For Florida, a win on national television could save
an otherwise bitterly disappointing season. They'll be primed, but so will
the Cardinal — Stanford has never had a game televised nationally by
a network. To win, Stanford mustn't allow the sometimes-brilliant Schintzius
to have a big game. Since Florida's front-line size matches up well against
the Cardinal, and since their guard play is mediocre, Lichti could have
a big game. Also, look for Terry Taylor to light it up from 3-point land.
