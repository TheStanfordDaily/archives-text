# Card lineup in 'state of flux'
## Marquess maneuvers as team seeks first win of season 
### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
It's time for Stanford baseball's version of musical
chairs.
"We won't have a set lineup for at least a couple
weeks," Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said.
"Everything is in a state of flux. We're going to
move things around."
While spectators will focus on preseason No. 1
Stanford's quest for its first win and Marquess's
quest for the 500 th of his career (he has 497), the
Cardinal coaching staff will also explore endless
lineup possibilities in this weekend's three-game set
with No. 8 Loyola Marymount at Sunken Diamond.
In fact, only three spots among Stanford's starting
eight appear settled. Senior Frank Carey — a four
year starter in the infield — is the Cardinal's second
baseman and leadoff hitter. Junior Paul Carey is
set for another outstanding season as Stanford's
right fielder and number three or four batter. Junior
Troy Paulsen is a fixture at shortstop and will bat
high in the lineup. Beyond those three, the Cardinal
looks a lot like a jigsaw puzzle.
Junior Tim Griffin, a designated hitter last
season, will play, but it's not clear where. He has
hit the cover off the ball in Stanford's first three
games, but he may not end up at third base, the

spot he occupies now. That's because ever-versatile
junior Brian Johnson — hitless in 1989 — may see
some time this weekend in left field, where he
started last year, according to Marquess.
If Johnson shifts to the outfield, Marquess may
swing Griffin around the diamond or even return
him to DH, allowing one of the freshmen a shot at
first base but six-foot, 190-pound freshman David
Holbrook has the inside track there. Thus far in
'89 Holbrook has three hits — two doubles — in
seven at-bats and has knocked in three runs.
"Holbrook has swung the bat extremely well, but
the freshmen can be hot one week and cool off the
next," Marquess said. "He has also been great in
practice," he added.

Junior utility man Brian Johnson, who hit .319 last year, will be one of several players Coach Mark
Marquess will juggle around the horn this weekend against Loyola Marymount.
Marquess also hinted that 6-5, 200-pound frosh
David McCarty could see action at first base over
the weekend.
And if Griffin moves around against Loyola, third
base would open up for Roger Burnett, a freshman
who already has six plate appearances in '89. Bur
nett has a hit and an RBI and has scored twice.
"We'll use Burnett as well (at third) to give him a
chance," Marquess said.
The outfield will also be a score keeper's delfght
throughout the weekend. Senior Eric DeGraw has
the best glove on the team and is the returning
starter in center field, but both center and left field
are very much up in the air.
Steve Solomon figures to get a second look in
center versus Loyola — he started there against
San Jose State last Monday and was hitless. Soph
omore Mike Eicher, who challenged DeGraw for his
job last year, has seen action in left field and is
hitless in three at-bats. He could see action both
in left and in center this weekend.
Sophomore Ryan Turner, with one pinch-hit ap
pearance thus far, should get a shot in left if the
weather permits. "Turner has looked good in left
in practice," Marquess said.
Junior Eric Cox — backup last year to the
departed Doug Bobbins — has been the catcher in
the Cardinal's first three games, but freshman Troy
Tallman, who has caught but does not have a plate
appearance, could also see action against Loyola.
Even the pitching rotation for the weekend is not
set. Marquess has sophomore Stan Spencer slated

to go today and sophomore Mike Mussina on tap
for Saturday, but he has not decided on Sunday's
starter. Brian Keyser is the likely candidate, but
any of a host of others could go.

junior Brian Johnson — hitless in 1989 — may see
some time this weekend in left field, where he
started last year, according to Marquess.
If Johnson shifts to the outfield, Marquess may
swing Griffin around the diamond or even return
him to DH, allowing one of the freshmen a shot at
first base but six-foot, 190-pound freshman David
Holbrook has the inside track there. Thus far in
'89 Holbrook has three hits — two doubles — in
seven at-bats and has knocked in three runs.
"Holbrook has swung the bat extremely well, but
the freshmen can be hot one week and cool off the
next," Marquess said. "He has also been great in
practice," he added.

Junior utility man Brian Johnson, who hit .319 last year, will be one of several players Coach Mark
Marquess will juggle around the horn this weekend against Loyola Marymount.
Marquess also hinted that 6-5, 200-pound frosh
David McCarty could see action at first base over
the weekend.
And if Griffin moves around against Loyola, third
base would open up for Roger Burnett, a freshman
who already has six plate appearances in '89. Bur
nett has a hit and an RBI and has scored twice.
"We'll use Burnett as well (at third) to give him a
chance," Marquess said.
The outfield will also be a score keeper's delfght
throughout the weekend. Senior Eric DeGraw has
the best glove on the team and is the returning
starter in center field, but both center and left field
are very much up in the air.
Steve Solomon figures to get a second look in
center versus Loyola — he started there against
San Jose State last Monday and was hitless. Soph
omore Mike Eicher, who challenged DeGraw for his
job last year, has seen action in left field and is
hitless in three at-bats. He could see action both
in left and in center this weekend.
Sophomore Ryan Turner, with one pinch-hit ap
pearance thus far, should get a shot in left if the
weather permits. "Turner has looked good in left
in practice," Marquess said.
Junior Eric Cox — backup last year to the
departed Doug Bobbins — has been the catcher in
the Cardinal's first three games, but freshman Troy
Tallman, who has caught but does not have a plate
appearance, could also see action against Loyola.
Even the pitching rotation for the weekend is not
set. Marquess has sophomore Stan Spencer slated

to go today and sophomore Mike Mussina on tap
for Saturday, but he has not decided on Sunday's
starter. Brian Keyser is the likely candidate, but
any of a host of others could go.
Yes, the most avid Stanford baseball aficionados
will need a scorecard to follow the Cardinal this
weekend. When the vendor walks by and yells, "You
can't tell the players without a scorecard," it won't
be an idle threat.
