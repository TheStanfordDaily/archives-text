## Multi-talented John Hodge has Stanford in the swim of things 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Two championship rings and an NCAA gold medal
are not the only things which separate John Hodge
from the crowd. The senior is the only Cardinal
swimmer to be recruited for football.
While most swimmers participate only in aquatic
athletics, Hodge competed in football, basketball,
baseball and golf as well as swimming while in high
school. And when his senior year rolled around, the
freestylist was recruited not only by Stanford and
other Pacific 10 conference universities for his swim
ming talents but also by eastern institutions for his
football and golf skills.
But after winning the junior nationals in the 100-
and '200-yard freestyle, the native of Buffalo, N.Y.,
decided to stick to swimming. After his performance
his freshman year at Stanford, the national
champion Cardinal could not have been happier
with his decision.
In aiding Stanford's drive for its second consecu
tive NCAA crown, Hodge swam in the finals of the
200-yard freestyle, placing sixth overall, and finished
13th in the 100-yard freestyle. The All-American
also swam a leg on each of the Cardinal's relay
squads â€” the midley, 400 free, and 800 free relays.
The freestylist's first year on the Farm also helped
give him a team attitude for the most individual
of his sports. While most squads approach competi
tions as personal meets, the Cardinal traditionally
uses a "we" mentality.
This strategy pays off for Hodge. "Swimming is
such an individual sport that I didn't like to swim
all year round. But once I got to Stanford I did
well when I swam for the team and not for myself,"
Hodge said.
The past two years have not been easy for multi

faceted athlete. After swimming a leg on Stanford's
national-champion medley relay team and winning
his second NCAA ring his sophomore year, Hodge
reinjured a knee he blew out while playing high
school football.
Now, after his fifth injury to the same knee, he
has no cartilage remaining in it. But he continues
to compete, qualifying for last season's NCAA finals
and competing in last summer's Olympic Trials.
With his practice time limited, he has even been
bumped from the traveling squad this season.
"The injury just makes me want to swim more,
it gives me more passion for the sport," he said.
"And I'm a sprinter, so the decrease in training
shouldn't hurt me at NCAAs."
But swimming is not everything that Hodge does.
In addition to being a Biology major who hopes to
become a doctor, Hodge is the director of Volunteers
for Youth, a program which matches NCAA athletes
at Stanford with troubled youngsters. Currently
Hodge coordinates the activites of 60 Cardinal ath
lete/youth pairs. "The school has given so much to
us (the athletes) that I really like to put something
back into the community," Hodge said.
Card notes
Stanford is in Arizona to open the conference schedule
this weekend. The second-ranked Cardinal faces Arizona
today, before traveling to Tempe to against
No. 9 Arizona State and Nebraska in a double dual meet
on Saturday. (The races will be scored separately against
the two opponents). Stanford is currently 0-1 in dual meets.
In Tucson, the Cardinal will be on the lookout for the
Wildcat's two All-Americans, intermediate medley and
butterfly swimmer Matt Rankin and distance freestyler
Jeff Utsch. If he is eligible, former Florida freestyler Troy
Dalby will join with Arizona State NCAA finalist Paul
Howe to challenge Stanford.
