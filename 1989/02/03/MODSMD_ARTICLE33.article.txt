## Junior Forman's only just begun 
### 
Even though he's a junior,
Stanford gymnast Adam Forman
is just now beginning his col
legiate career.
Forman was the junior na
tional all-around champion in
1985 and came to Stanford as
one of the nation's prize
recruits. Now, after redshirting
his freshman year and serving
on the team's supporting cast
last year, Forman is a Cardinal
co-captain and is ranked 22nd
among all U.S. gymnasts.
Forman's role will be espe
cially important tonight at 7:30
p.m. when Stanford competes at
San Jose State without two of
its top performers. Freshman
Tim Ryan and junior Conrad
Voorsanger are in Colorado at a
week-long U.S. National Team
training session.
The Stanford men's gymnas
tics scene is a very different one
from last year when the team
was led by three seniors to a
fourth place NCAA Champion
ship finish. The 1989 Cardinal
faces the difficult task of com
pensating for the loss of their
leadership at competitions and
in training.

"It puts a lot more pressure
on us to have to fill in for (those
graduates)," Forman said. "It's
something we'll have to get used
to, and get used to quickly."
Forman believes this year's
Cardinal is very capable of con
tinuing the tradition of success
that Stanford's program has es
tablished over the past few
years. "Once everyone is
healthy, once we bring everyone
together, we have a very, very
strong team," he said.
"Everyone seems to be adjust
ing well this seascp," he contin
ued. "The team is very cohesive
and works well together. There's
no conflict between anyone. It's
a strong team, a group-oriented
team."

Fencing teams host
Pacific 10 Invite
The region-leading Stanford
fencing teams are parrying their
way towards Roble Gym to host
the Pacific 10 Conference Invi
tational tomorrow. The Cardinal

will compete against (JSC,
UCLA, Arizona State and Cali
fornia in the round-robin tour
nament that will begin at 9:00
a.m. and will last throughout the
day.
Although the competition
promises to be fierce, the Stan
ford teams are the invite's
favorites. "We are the strongest
team and expect to win," said
women's coach Sherry Poa
thurnus.
The Cardinal teams are the
only official varsity squads in
the tournament and in the Pac
-10. The other club teams will be
fighting to show their athletic
departments that they deserve
varsity status as well.
"If the other schools do well
against us it may help them
reach varsity [statusl," Pos
thumus said. "But we definitely
expect to win."
Sporting a 14-1 record, the
men's team should have little
trouble in downing the less ex
perienced Pac-10 teams. Besides
vying for the all-around team
title, the individual squads will
be competing for titles in epee,
foil and sabre. Cardinal starting
sabre fighters will be Mike
Cramer, Dave Russ and Leonard
D'Amico; the epee duelists will be
Steve Schmidt, Rich Reader and
Lee Tankersly; and the foil team
will consist of Duncan Bell, Stan
Brobston and Nick Bravin.
The women's team will be en
tering the tournament as favorites
because they have won the West
ern Region Championships the
past six years and are currently
enjoying another successful
season. Starters Elisabeth Spil
man, Olivia Judson, Tracy
Schmidt and Grace Chang will be
competing. The women are still
without injured senior Juliet
Johnson, who hopes to return in
time for the Western Region
Championships.

Wrestlers ready to
tackle Cal Poly-SLO
Coming off an impressive 28-10
trouncing of Humboldt State on
Jan. 28, Stanford's wrestling
team looks invincible as they
prepare to square off against Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo tonight.

There is one problem, however.
Stanford hus not beaten Cal Poly
in about 20 years.
Since 1955, Cal Poly has a 26-
2-1 record against the Cardinal.
Stanford did tie Cal Poly three
years ago but the term "under
dog" still applies to the Cardinal
grapplers.
Yet, to count out this Stanford
team before the dual meet would
be unfair. According to coach
Chris Horpel, the Cardinal has an
excellent shot. "We match up well
against them. We are strong
where they are not, and they are
strong where we're not. We just
have to make our victories more
decisive than theirs."
Team leaders Steve Yarbrough
(167 lbs.), Steve Buddie (177 lbs.),
and Ron Perry (190 lbs.) should
provide some needed inspiration
and, more importantly, points late
in the match.
Dave Nowick (118 lbs.), Mark
Forman (126 lbs.), Josh Lisle (134
lbs.), James Dinette (142 lbs.),
Geoff Baum (150 lbs.), Matt Top
ham (158 lbs.), Trent Smith
(heavyweight) and Dave Nahama
(heavyweight) round out tomor
row's team, which hopes to im
prove on Stanford's 5-1-0 dual
meet record.

Wrestlers ready to
tackle Cal Poly-SLO
Coming off an impressive 28-10
trouncing of Humboldt State on
Jan. 28, Stanford's wrestling
team looks invincible as they
prepare to square off against Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo tonight.

There is one problem, however.
Stanford hus not beaten Cal Poly
in about 20 years.
Since 1955, Cal Poly has a 26-
2-1 record against the Cardinal.
Stanford did tie Cal Poly three
years ago but the term "under
dog" still applies to the Cardinal
grapplers.
Yet, to count out this Stanford
team before the dual meet would
be unfair. According to coach
Chris Horpel, the Cardinal has an
excellent shot. "We match up well
against them. We are strong
where they are not, and they are
strong where we're not. We just
have to make our victories more
decisive than theirs."
Team leaders Steve Yarbrough
(167 lbs.), Steve Buddie (177 lbs.),
and Ron Perry (190 lbs.) should
provide some needed inspiration
and, more importantly, points late
in the match.
Dave Nowick (118 lbs.), Mark
Forman (126 lbs.), Josh Lisle (134
lbs.), James Dinette (142 lbs.),
Geoff Baum (150 lbs.), Matt Top
ham (158 lbs.), Trent Smith
(heavyweight) and Dave Nahama
(heavyweight) round out tomor
row's team, which hopes to im
prove on Stanford's 5-1-0 dual
meet record.

Even though he's a junior,
Stanford gymnast Adam Forman
is just now beginning his col
legiate career.
Forman was the junior na
tional all-around champion in
1985 and came to Stanford as
one of the nation's prize
recruits. Now, after redshirting
his freshman year and serving
on the team's supporting cast
last year, Forman is a Cardinal
co-captain and is ranked 22nd
among all U.S. gymnasts.
Forman's role will be espe
cially important tonight at 7:30
p.m. when Stanford competes at
San Jose State without two of
its top performers. Freshman
Tim Ryan and junior Conrad
Voorsanger are in Colorado at a
week-long U.S. National Team
training session.
The Stanford men's gymnas
tics scene is a very different one
from last year when the team
was led by three seniors to a
fourth place NCAA Champion
ship finish. The 1989 Cardinal
faces the difficult task of com
pensating for the loss of their
leadership at competitions and
in training.

"It puts a lot more pressure
on us to have to fill in for (those
graduates)," Forman said. "It's
something we'll have to get used
to, and get used to quickly."
Forman believes this year's
Cardinal is very capable of con
tinuing the tradition of success
that Stanford's program has es
tablished over the past few
years. "Once everyone is
healthy, once we bring everyone
together, we have a very, very
strong team," he said.
"Everyone seems to be adjust
ing well this seascp," he contin
ued. "The team is very cohesive
and works well together. There's
no conflict between anyone. It's
a strong team, a group-oriented
team."

Fencing teams host
Pacific 10 Invite
The region-leading Stanford
fencing teams are parrying their
way towards Roble Gym to host
the Pacific 10 Conference Invi
tational tomorrow. The Cardinal

will compete against (JSC,
UCLA, Arizona State and Cali
fornia in the round-robin tour
nament that will begin at 9:00
a.m. and will last throughout the
day.
Although the competition
promises to be fierce, the Stan
ford teams are the invite's
favorites. "We are the strongest
team and expect to win," said
women's coach Sherry Poa
thurnus.
The Cardinal teams are the
only official varsity squads in
the tournament and in the Pac
-10. The other club teams will be
fighting to show their athletic
departments that they deserve
varsity status as well.
"If the other schools do well
against us it may help them
reach varsity [statusl," Pos
thumus said. "But we definitely
expect to win."
Sporting a 14-1 record, the
men's team should have little
trouble in downing the less ex
perienced Pac-10 teams. Besides
vying for the all-around team
title, the individual squads will
be competing for titles in epee,
foil and sabre. Cardinal starting
sabre fighters will be Mike
Cramer, Dave Russ and Leonard
D'Amico; the epee duelists will be
Steve Schmidt, Rich Reader and
Lee Tankersly; and the foil team
will consist of Duncan Bell, Stan
Brobston and Nick Bravin.
The women's team will be en
tering the tournament as favorites
because they have won the West
ern Region Championships the
past six years and are currently
enjoying another successful
season. Starters Elisabeth Spil
man, Olivia Judson, Tracy
Schmidt and Grace Chang will be
competing. The women are still
without injured senior Juliet
Johnson, who hopes to return in
time for the Western Region
Championships.
