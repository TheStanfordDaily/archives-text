cold weather and the Utah Utes in im
proving its season mark to 2-0 with an
8-0 shutout yesterday.

Cardinal 8, Utes 0

The match that served as the unof
ficial re-opening of the Stanford Tennis
Stadium provided little drama for the
few spectators who actually stayed
around to watch. It did, however, bring
some excellent news to the team as
senior Eleni Rossides played and per
formed extremely well.
Recovering from ankle injuries, just
the most recent in a long series of phys
ical problems that have plagued her dur
ing her Stanford career, Rossides was
matched against Utah's Kristin Sieg
mund at No. 4 singles.
Looking sharp throughout the match,
Rossides scored an impressive 6-0, 6-1
victory. "It was really nice to play a
match . . . since that hasn't happened
in a long time," Rossides said.
Said Coach Frank Brennan: "I was
very pleased with her performance."
Brennan added that Rossides didn't
chase after some balls and may have
been a little cautious in light of the
injury.
Still, Asst. Coach Lele Forood noted
that Rossides "played very aggressively"
overall. It was a particularly good sign
considering that Rossides feels she's
only at 60-70 percent of full strength.
At No. 2 singles, freshman sensation
Debbie Graham continued to impress
with a 6-0, 6-1 thrashing of Ruth Ann
Stevens. Brennan said he was pleased
with her play because "Debbie has a
tendency to get a little sloppy in matches
she should dominate" but she didn't

this time.
Lisa Green was again at No. 1 and
threatened to make her match interest
ing by going to 5-5 in the second set
after taking the first set 6-1. But Green
mixed it up well in the final two games
against Michelle Mras to win the set 7-5.
Despite Green's last-second heroics
the Cardinal would eventually drop its
first set of the season at No. 2 doubles.
Cindy Buchsbaum and Kylie Johnson
fell 4-6 in the opening set against
Stevens and Julie Kempin.
In the second set, however, the mo
mentum shifted. On the stregth of some
inspired play by senior captain
Buchsbaum and some strong serving
from Johnson, the Stanford duo came
back from a 2-3 deficit to win the set
6-3.
In the third set, it seemed that Stan
ford might lose its first match of the
season when Stevens-Kempin pulled out
to a 2-0 lead. But Johnson's excellent
serve allowed the Cardinal to hold in
the third game and cut the deficit to 2-1.
The teams split the next two to give
the Utah pair a 3-2 lead. The Cardinal
broke serve again and Johnson followed

that up with yet another superb service
game. That gave Buchsbaum-Johnson
a 4-3 lead. They would eventually con
vert that lead into a 6-4 win in the set
and the match.
In other action, Teri Whitlinger
struggled briefly late in the first set
before scoring a 6-4, 6-1 win over Kem
pin at No. 3. Johnson dominated at No.
5 in knocking off Susie Costa 6-1, 6-0.
Valerie Wilson rounded out the singles
sweep with a 6-4, 6-0 win over Suzy
Westfall.
At No. 1 doubles, Graham and Whit
linger dropped a set before knocking off
Mras and Costa 6-2, 1-6, 6-2.
Due to cold weather and darkness,
the No. 3 doubles match was canceled.
