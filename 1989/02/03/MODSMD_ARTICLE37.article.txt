# For Metz, distances short road to top
## 
### Chris Grader Senior staff writer 
It's a good thing kids in
Wyoming don't like to swim dis
tance events.
If they did, Stanford sophomore
Barb Metz might not have become
one of the nation's top distance
freestylers. But they don't, and
she is.
Growing up in Casper, Wyo.,
Metz always swam the short
events until she made a discovery
one day. "There'd be like 20 or
30 people in the short events and
maybe three or four in the dis
tance races," she said. "I would
never get a ribbon in the short
events. I thought, 'I can place in
the longer things because all I
had to do was finish it.' "
What she didn't know then is
that she is good enough to place
against almost any field. After
coming to Stanford as perhaps the
top distance freestyle recruit in
the country, Metz had a very good
freshman year. She placed sixth
in the 500-yard freestyle, 11th in
the 200 butterfly and swam a leg
on the third-place Cardinal 800
freestyle relay as Stanford
finished third at the NCAA
Championships.
Last summer was even better
as she reached the finals in three
events at the U.S. Olympic Trials,

placing sixth in the 800-meter
freestyle, seventh in the 400-
meter freestyle and eighth in the
200-meter freestyle. This season
Metz has already qualified for the
NCAA Championships by record
ing a time of 16 minutes, 28.53
seconds in the 1650 freestyle, 14
seconds below her previous per
sonal best.
"I'm definitely swimming faster
in practice than I ever had in my
life," Metz said. "I have a lot of
confidence this year, more than
last. I know deep down inside
we're going to be right there [at
the NCAA Championships]. I plan
on scoring a lot more points this
year."
"She's swimming so well,"
graduate Asst. Coach Stacy Shupe
said. "I think she's going to be
awesome. I think she's going to
surprise some people. [The 16:28]
is a foreshadowing of great things
to come."
So how, then, did the 1986
Wyoming high school cross coun
try champion become such a dom
inant swimmer? The answer, as
it almost always is, is hard work
and determination.
"She's got real good work eth
ics," freshman distance swimmer
Eva Mortenson said. "She's really
intense. She's the type of person
that deserves to do well."
Shupe, one of the Cardinal's
best distance swimmers ever,
knows Metz both as a training
partner from last year and as a
coachee this season. "I think Barb
has one of the best attitudes
toward swimming, and life, of
probably anyone I've ever trained
with," Shupe said. "Last year she

made swimming so exciting for
me."
Metz agrees she deserves to be
called hard-working. "I do like to
work hard at practice. I like it
when you come out of the pool
and your shoulders are dead, your
body is sore, but there's a warm
spot in your heart."
Metz cites new Coach Richard
Quick's practices as a big cause
for her improvement. "Richard's
practices are really interesting,"
Metz said. "There's always some
thing in the practice I can chal
lenge myself with. I need a pur
pose. In his workouts I can see
that.
"We're doing a lot more dis
tance training this year. . . .
Maybe I'm even starting to like
it a little."
In addition to keeping herself
motivated at practices, Metz also
gets the other distance freestylers
up. "She never complains," Mor
tenson said. "She just takes the
attitude 'Let's go' ... It rubs off.
You feel like you should work
hard. She doesn't say much, she
just does it."
Her dedication also holds in her
academics, yet she is not just a
hard-working introvert. "She's
very nice," Mortenson said. "She's
the type of person who generates
respect. . . . She's really genuine."
"She's always there with a big
smile," Shupe said, "and even
when things aren't going well
she's still smiling. She always
comes in and does what she has
to. She's real fun to coach and
was even better to train with."
She's just not fun to race
against.
Card notes
Metz and her distance freestyle
teammates will have some strong
competition at Texas tomorrow. The
Longhorns have senior Stacy Cas
siday, the fourth-place finisher in the
500 freestyle at last year's NCAA
meet and junior Andrea Hayes, who
was third in the same event. Hayes

'She's really in
tense. She's the
type of person that
deserves to do
well.'

finished sixth in the 200-meter back
stroke in the 1988 Olympics and
finished third in the 800-meter free
and fourth in both the 400-meter in
dividual medley and the 400-meter
freestyle at the Olympic Trials.
In addition to Cassiday and Hayes,
six other Lady Longhorns have qual
ified for the NCAA Championships.
They are defending 50 freestyle cham
pion Leigh Ann Fetter, butterfliers
Annabelle Cripps and Kristi Kiggans,
breaststroker Dorsey Tierney, individ
ual medley swimmer Katy Arris and
sprinter Courtney Madsen.
In addition to losing Coach Quick
to Stanford and Tracey McFarlane
and Betsy Mitchell to graduation,
Texas lost Carrie Steinseifer, Susan
Johnson and Kclley Davies to retire
ment.
The Cardinal's "best-ever" diving
squad (according to diving Coach Rick
Shavone) will face a big challenge in
Texas. The Longhorns are led by All-
America Kelly Jenkins who finished
third in the one-meter and fourth in
the three-meter diving at last year's
NCAA Championships.
