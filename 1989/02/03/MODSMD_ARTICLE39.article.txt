# Now among the elite, are women Final Four bound?
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
No. 4 in the nation.
How horizons change. Just two
years ago, the Stanford women's
basketball team celebrated a .500
season. Last year's top-20 ranking
was the cause for much jubilation,
as was the team's NCAA Tour
nament berth. This season's
preseason top-10 spot is equally
thrilling.
Now the Cardinal has leaped
the last hurdle: top five status.
With last weekend's pair of wins
and lowa's timely loss to Purdue,
the Cardinal vaulted into the
Final Four zone for the first time

in school history. Barring any un
expected defeat, Stanford may
find itself the recipient of a pres
tigious top regional seeding come
March.
As senior center Jill Yanke has
witnessed, times have certainly
changed. Recruited in the interim
between coaches Dotty McCrea
and Tara VanDerveer, Yanke was
a member of VanDerveer's first
Stanford squad.
The team went 13-15 that year,
but Yanke knew that fortunes
would soon improve.
"I knew that the program was
going to get better and better with
the new coaching staff we had,"
Yanke said. "I don't know if four

years ago when I was a freshman
1 realized how good we could really
be, in the top five in the country.
"By sophomore year, I started
thinking, 'Hey, with the recruits
we're getting, we could really
make it. We just need to be de
termined to work hard enough.'
Now we're there."
With this week's ranking and
this weekend's contests, things
have come full circle for the Car
dinal. Arizona and Arizona State,
two schools struggling under
second-year coaches, are in the
position Stanford was relegated
to a few years ago, while the Car
dinal has the then-unheard-of
chance to sweep all 18 Pacific 10
Conference games.
The difference has been recruit
ing. VanDerveer and her staff
have set new standards in recruit
ing excellence by netting the best
class in the nation three straight
years.
With players the caliber of 1988
National Freshman of the Year
Sonja Henning, All-Pac-10 selec
tion Katy Steding and preseason
Ail-American Jennifer Azzi as the
result, Stanford now boasts per
haps the most envied bench in the
nation. From one to 14, all of the
players are proven high school
winners and tough collegiate com
petitors.
Winning is easier with such a
surplus of talent. If the starters
get in foul trouble or need a
breather, the Cardinal coaches
can substitute with total confi
dence.
For Yanke, this has been the
most noticeable change. In her
freshman season, the star
performers were easily identifia
ble; this year, however, depth is
the true star.

"It's much more competitive
within the team," Yanke ob
served. "One thing I really like
now is having the depth on our
team that we really didn't have
a few years ago. I like the way
everybody can play a lot and con
tribute to the team."
Yanke may make her biggest
personal contributions to the Car
dinal this weekend in a
doubleheader that seems catered
to her individually. Arizona State
plays a physical game that the
6-foot-5 center can excel in, as she
dwarfs the tallest Sun Devil
starter by three inches. Offensive
ly, Yanke has a fine opportunity
to make an impact.
Arizona provides her a chance
to flaunt her defensive prowess.
Wildcat forward Amy Gamble has
torn opponents apart inside
throughout the season, but Yanke
could play a big role in shutting
her down.
"My defense has been pretty
good, so I'd like to block a few
shots," Yanke said. "I'd like to be
more of an offensive threat than
I have been, and just play good
team basketball."
Good team basketball, the
brand that hoisted the Cardinal
to the top of the heap. This week
end will be a showcase for Stan
ford, a chance to show observers
that the ranking is not a fluke of
pollsters.
"We're No. 4, and we want to
prove it to people," Yanke said.
"There are some people out there
that aren't quite sure, and we
need to prove it. We can't let any
thing go to our heads — we have
to go out there and show people
that we are a good team and we
can beat anybody if we play really
well and play as a team."
Times have definitely changed.

Center of attention
Senior Jill Yanke could play a key role in this weekend's games
against the Arizona teams. Yanke's physical play may propel the
Cardinal's offense as well as shut down Arizona star Amy Gamble.
