# Arizona State, Arizona at Stanford
## 
### 
TONIGHT - Arizona State. KZSU (90.1 FM). 7:30 p.m. tipoff at Maples
Pavilion.
TOMORROW — Arizona. 7:30 p.m. tipoff.
RECORDS - Stanford (15-2, 7-0 in Pac-10 play, ranked 4th by AP), Arizona
State (7-10, 1-6), Arizona (6-11, 1-6).
SUN DEVIL UPDATE — This weekend wraps up a seven-game road trip
for ASU, which has lost all five of its previous games. The Sun Devils
have given up a staggering average of 80.4 points in their last seven
contests. On the offensive side, point guard Karen O'Connor has carried
much of the load and is averaging 21.6 ppg. Fellow guard Rosalind
Senior leads the league in 3-point shooting percentage (53.5 percent
overall, 62.3 in Pac-10 play).
WILDCAT UPDATE - Arizona ended its 16-game losing streak last weekend
by beating Arizona State in McKale Center 77-70. For her contributions,
forward Amy Gamble was named Pac-10 Player of the Week. Gamble
leads the Wildcats in scoring at 17.9 ppg and rebounding at 9.1 rpg.
CARDINAL UPDATE — In the midst of a nine game winning streak, Stanford
remains atop the Pac-10 with a half-game lead over Washington. The
Cardinal remains a well-balanced team, spreading the scoring wealth
among many players. The scoring leaders are Katy Steding (15.7 ppg),
Jennifer Azzi (15.0 ppg) and Trisha Stevens (10.7 ppg).
KEYS TO VICTORY - Once again, Stanford faces two very different teams.
Tonight, the Cardinal must prevent O'Connor from having a good game,
keeping pressure on her outside and not allowing her to drive. Stanford
must afso keep an eye on Senior, who could readily rack up a half-dozen
treys if left unnoticed. Saturday, Gamble inside is the sole hindrance: A
strong and flexible post player, she must be contained by any Stanford
defender assigned to her. If Gamble is neutralized, Stanford should roll
smoothly to its 11th straight win.
