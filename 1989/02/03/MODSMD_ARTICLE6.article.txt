# ASSU urges tenure spot for Asian-American Studies prof.
## 
### Baldwin Lee Staff writer 
By a unanimous vote, the ASSU
passed a resolution last night ur
ging the University to create a
post for a tenure-track Asian-
American Studies professor im
mediately. But the call may not
be realized for more than a year.
The ASSU's resolution is an
other step towards the Asian-
American Students Association's
goal of attaining a professorship
in the area of Asian-American
Studies.
However, even with University
support, a billet, or position,
would have to be moved from an
other department and the search
could not start until next year,
said Kathryn Gillam, assistant
dean of Academic Affairs.
To prove that the professorship
is necessary, the ASSU resolution
noted the existence of Asian-
American Studies programs at
many other universities, such as
UC-Berkeley, Harvard and Yale.
Although Stanford has an East

Asian Studies Department, which
concentrates on the life of Asians
across the Pacific, it has no pro
gram in Asian-American Studies,
dealing with the experience of
Asians in the United States.
The ASSU noted that the only
professor now teaching an Asian-
American Studies course here
could possibly leave. Prof. Gordon
Chang has been offered a tenure
position at UC-Irvine. Chang, who
is also a project coordinator with
the International Strategic Insti
tute at Stanford, said he is con
sidering the offer.
Without Chang, no courses
covering the area of Asian-
American Studies would exist at
Stanford, according to East Asian
Studies major Dana Klapper.
Paul Geager, an AASA issues
committee member, said Chang's
seminar, Topics in Asian-
American History, consistently
draws student interest, resulting
in enrollments much higher than
the maximum of 25 allowed.
AASA began circulating a peti

tion last week pressuring the ad
ministration to create the profes
sorial position. Geager said the
passage of the ASSU resolution
is a boost for AASA. With ASSU
collaboration, the petitioners can
now utilize the ASSU's extensive
outreach mechanisms to organize
students, who Geager believed
were very much in support of the
resolution.
Gillam said that although no
available billets now exist in the
History Department to fill the
Asian American Studies position,
the University supports the
professorship "in principle."
In order to create the tenure
professorship, the University
must move a billet from some
other department, a process His
tory Department Chair James
Sheehan said is quite difficult.
Gillam said a search for a
tenured Asian-American Studies
professor could possibly begin
next year, with a candidate filling
the position in the 1990-91 aca
demic year.
