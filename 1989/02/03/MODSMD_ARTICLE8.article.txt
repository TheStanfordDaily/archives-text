# Influenza influx causes campus colds
## 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
This winter has been particularly
"cold," with more students than usual
catching the flu, according to Cowell
Health Center.
Symptoms of the flu include head
ache, fever, sore throat, aching muscles
and a dry cough.
One nonprescription medicine,
acetaminophen, found in Tylenol, may
help patients recover, said John Dor
man, associate director of Cowell. But

mom's old standbys — drinking lots of
juice, getting plenty of rest and staying
warm — still work.
However, patients should avoid
aspirin, Dorman said, because it can
slightly increase the chance of contract
ing Reye's syndrome. A rare side effect
of influenza, Reye's syndrome invades
the liver and brain and causes death in
extreme cases.
Dorman said there is little to do to
avoid the flu, since it is contagious.
Although people are probably more sus
ceptible to flu if they lack sleep, the
biggest problem is simnlv 3xnosure.

The Center for Disease Control in At
lanta reports that at least 32 states
have suffered widespread flu outbreaks
so far this year.
The influenza virus comes in two
st r ains, according to Dorman, Type A
and Type B. This year, unlike past
years, more cases of Type B have hit
students, Dorman said, although he
could not account for this phenomenon.
The symptoms of the two strains are
indistinguishable, Dorman said, adding
that the difference between them is
more important for research than for
treatment.
