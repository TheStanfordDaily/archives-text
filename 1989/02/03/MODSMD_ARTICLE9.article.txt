It promotes independent think
ing, reasoning and creativity.
Everyone talks about it.
And it's based on group inter
action and socialization.
Sound like a self-help program?
No, it's the "magic" of Dun
geons & Dragons, according to the
game's creator Gary Gygax who
spoke to a crowd of more than
200 students in Branner Hall last
night.
Gygaz, wearing a pink-striped
shirt and red suspenders, de
fended the popular role-playing
fantasy game he created in the
early 19705.
Dismissing the charge that the
game is occult, Gygax said, "What
is the occult? No one knows. The
occult is secret. If everyone is
talking about it, then it's not oc

cult."
And he shrugged off critics who
claim that the game is satanic.
"Satanic is anything they disagree
with. They say it has magic in it.
Sure, it's magic to play the game
and have a good time. It's enter
tainment based on group interac
tion and socialization," he said.
Gygax speculated that the fan
tasy inherent in the game helps
children cope with reality and said
psychologists give the game posi
tive reviews.
Gygax said the game can be
played by people of every age,
hinting at his own youthful atti
tude. "Do I play D & D?" he asked.
"Of course I still do. I decided a
long time ago that I would never
grow up if 1 could help it."
Gygax said he plans to release
a new multi-genre fantasy game
in the coming year, in which char

acters can move between worlds
of "medieval fantasy, science fic
tion, horror and espionage." He
declined to comment further be
cause of copyright restrictions.
In creating Dungeons &
Dragons, Gygax said he drew
upon an early love o* stories, mil
itary games, science fiction and
chess.
He told the audience, made up
mostly of males, that in the 1970s
the typical age of game-players
was 20, but dropped to 14 as col
lege players introduced the game
to younger siblings.
The idea for Dungeons &
Dragons sprang out of Gygax's
pastime of playing games with a
group of his adult friends. Prior
to playing one day, Gygax realized
his friends were bored with the
game before them. Inspired, he

"clipped some hair from [his]
daughter's doll" and created a
dragon, bringing to life the role
playing fantasy that has captured
imaginations for nearly 20 years.
Although guidelines for playing
Dungeons & Dragons now fill
several volumes, when Gygax orig
inally designed the game its loose
rules sometimes caused heated ar
gument.
"In Berkeley, three groups
wouldn't speak to each other (over
a rule dispute)," Gygax said. "It
was then I decided to expand."
Since 1978 Gygax has continued
to write interpretations and
clarify the rules of the game. He
said the game still eT\joys nearly
the same level of popularity it has
had since its creation.
