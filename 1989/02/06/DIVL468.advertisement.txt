MAKING
WAVES
Acuson is making exciting waves in the ultrasound industry. We
utilize Computed Sonography, which enables medical professionals
to literally see inside the human body. The image is formed on a
hybrid analog/digital computer under software control, providing
the highest resolution, most precise medical imaging ever.
Our waves are creating just as much excitement in Silicon Valley.
Acuson's record growth, profitability and team approach make us the
ideal environment for talented BS, MS and PhD graduates in EE, CS
and ME. If you're looking for a company on the move, join us at
Acuson.
We'll be on campus to talk about opportunities for:
• Electrical Design Engineers • Image Analysis Engineers
