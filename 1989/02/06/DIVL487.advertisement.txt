To the Stanford Community:
Much has been written and said lately regarding the University's policy regarding cats on campus. The
policy is simply as follows:
Beginning February 27th, traps endorsed by the Palo Alto Humane Society will be placed
outside Campus Drive, excluding faculty and staff housing areas. Three weeks later, on
March 20th, traps will begin to be placed in the inner academic areas. Any cat that is
tagged and collared will be released immediately. Wild cats caught in the traps will be
delivered to Santa Clara County Animal Control Services. Wild animals, such as raccoons
and skunks, will be released in the foothills.
We ask that all pets on campus, in order to facilitate identification, be vaccinated,
registered, collared, and tagged. Additionally, we strongly encourage anyone caring for a
pet to have it spayed or neutered, and we require that cats not housed in the faculty or
staff housing areas be spayed or neutered.
In order to help you register your cat, we will be setting up registration booths in the Wilbur Parking
lot (corner of Escondido and Campus Drive) on the following days: February 7, 10, 11, 14, 17, 18, 21,
24, and 25 from 10 AM to 1 PM.
Also, below is a list of local Humane Societies and Animal Service Agencies and the services they
provide. If you have any administrative or policy questions, please feel free to call me at 723-4954. For
assistance with traps or registration forms, please call the Work Information Center at 723-2281.
Thanks for your help and cooperation.
