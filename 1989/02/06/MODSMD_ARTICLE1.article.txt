# Ailing jazz program sings financial blues to tune of $40,000
## 
### Carl Bergetz 
The Stanford Jazz Program emerged
in 1986 as a promising addition to the
Music Department, but because of major
funding problems, susbstantial parts of
the program have shut down.
Almost without warning, the Music De
partment dropped its two jazz classes at
the start of this quarter. Prize-winning
jazz combo groups which had toured the
nation last year disassembled. Stan Getz,
widely recognized as one of the premiere
saxophone players of his time, is no longer
"artist-in-residence" for the program.
In just its first quarter of operation
this year, the jazz program has been

swamped by $40,000 of red ink.
A tight budget has forced the depart
ment "to retrench a large portion of the
jazz program beginning with this winter
quarter, probably for the remainder of
the academic year," according to Prof.
Albert Cohen, acting chair of the Music
Department. The jazz program has now
reverted to its rudimentary pre-1986
status.
Although the program is part of the
University's academic curriculum, Stan
ford has not given the program significant
financial backing. Despite a request from
Cohen this fall, the School of Humanities
and Sciences never bolstered the ailing
program with funding.

However, according to a 1986 agree
ment, Stanford is under no obligation to
help fund the program. Cohen noted that
the bulk of funding for the program has
always come from outside sources. The
Committee for Jazz at Stanford, made
up of University and community support
ers, recognizes this agreement.
"The jazz committee always knew they
were responsible for the funding of the
program. ... No promises were made,"
according to department administrator
Melinda Mcgee.
The primary financial source for the
program has been Stanford alumnus
John Blokker, who agreed in 1986 to
finance Stanford's pilot program in jazz,

The greatest problem af
flicting the jazz program is
the absence of 'ongoing
fund raising.'

according to Cohen.
Getz coincident ally met Blokker in 1986
and told him he wanted to help build the
jazz program. In a collective effort, Getz,
Blokker, Cohen and jazz program director
Jim Nadel — along with interested fac
ulty members — initiated the program

that same year.
Before then, the jazz program merely
consisted of a jazz band and saxophone
instruction.
When the Music Department launched
the expanded program three years ago,
music fans at Stanford and around the
Bay Area were excited about new classes,
jazz combo groups and quarterly concerts
— all energized by the world-famous
Getz, now 62.
In three years, the program evolved
from a pilot program to an integrated
part of the Music Department, success
fully generating student involvement.
A course in jazz history taught
by lecturer Ted Gioia was popular
with students. But because of the
funding difficulties, Gioia is no
longer with the program.
The jazz combo groups, which
have won several national com
petitions, offered new opportuni
ties for student musicians.
The emerging program
employed Getz as artist-in
residence, giving the program a
considerable amount of credibility
and exposure. Getz provided
saxophone instruction and per
formed in four concerts each year
as part of his duties in the pro
gram.
Despite student, faculty and
community enthusiasm for the
program, a variety of problems
arose.
This summer's jazz concert in
Frost Amphitheater, starring
Getz and other performing
groups, raised onty $8,000. The
concert the previous year with
Getz and the Manhattan Transfer

netted $70,000, according to
Cohen.
In addition, Getz has been ill
this year and is no longer an active
part of the program. Getz was to
perform this month with the
Stanford Symphony Orchestra as
a benefit for the jazz program,
but the concert was cancelled.
Most importantly, though, the
greatest problem afflicting the
jazz program is the absence of
"ongoing fundraising," Cohen
said.
Blokker, one of the original
backers of the jazz program, has
provided the bulk of the funding
for the program over the last
three years. Blokker, along with
several other donors, have contin
ually looked to the University for
additional aid.
"If Stanford University is un
willing to support the academic
part of the program ... I am not
going to put up any more money,"
Blokker said. As yet, Blokker has
not given the jazz program any
money this year.
Getz said the ailing program is
just another case of jazz music
"being pushed aside." Saying that
the program had a bright future,

Getz added that the University in
general is unwilling to give sub
stantial support to the study of
humanities and the arts.
Despite their current problems
with the program, both Mcgee and
Cohen said they are optimistic
about the program's future and
believe that they'll find the
money.
Lithograph sales and a mem
bership campaign are underway
to raise funds, but the jazz com
mittee most importantly needs
support from the Stanford com
munity, Mcgee said.
The jazz program has tentative
plans for a Huey Lewis and the
News concert at Frost in May to
benefit the program. Such a con
cert could possibly raise enough
funds to rejuvinate the program
for next year, Mcgee said.
"Everyone in this department
wants this program to succeed,"
she said, adding that she hopes
new student and outside support
will bring the important program
back to prominence. "As soon as
we can make money, the jazz pro
gram will be back in swing."

but the concert was cancelled.
Most importantly, though, the
greatest problem afflicting the
jazz program is the absence of
"ongoing fundraising," Cohen
said.
Blokker, one of the original
backers of the jazz program, has
provided the bulk of the funding
for the program over the last
three years. Blokker, along with
several other donors, have contin
ually looked to the University for
additional aid.
"If Stanford University is un
willing to support the academic
part of the program ... I am not
going to put up any more money,"
Blokker said. As yet, Blokker has
not given the jazz program any
money this year.
Getz said the ailing program is
just another case of jazz music
"being pushed aside." Saying that
the program had a bright future,

Getz added that the University in
general is unwilling to give sub
stantial support to the study of
humanities and the arts.
Despite their current problems
with the program, both Mcgee and
Cohen said they are optimistic
about the program's future and
believe that they'll find the
money.
Lithograph sales and a mem
bership campaign are underway
to raise funds, but the jazz com
mittee most importantly needs
support from the Stanford com
munity, Mcgee said.
The jazz program has tentative
plans for a Huey Lewis and the
News concert at Frost in May to
benefit the program. Such a con
cert could possibly raise enough
funds to rejuvinate the program
for next year, Mcgee said.
"Everyone in this department
wants this program to succeed,"
she said, adding that she hopes
new student and outside support
will bring the important program
back to prominence. "As soon as
we can make money, the jazz pro
gram will be back in swing."
The Stanford Jazz Program emerged
in 1986 as a promising addition to the
Music Department, but because of major
funding problems, susbstantial parts of
the program have shut down.
Almost without warning, the Music De
partment dropped its two jazz classes at
the start of this quarter. Prize-winning
jazz combo groups which had toured the
nation last year disassembled. Stan Getz,
widely recognized as one of the premiere
saxophone players of his time, is no longer
"artist-in-residence" for the program.
In just its first quarter of operation
this year, the jazz program has been

swamped by $40,000 of red ink.
A tight budget has forced the depart
ment "to retrench a large portion of the
jazz program beginning with this winter
quarter, probably for the remainder of
the academic year," according to Prof.
Albert Cohen, acting chair of the Music
Department. The jazz program has now
reverted to its rudimentary pre-1986
status.
Although the program is part of the
University's academic curriculum, Stan
ford has not given the program significant
financial backing. Despite a request from
Cohen this fall, the School of Humanities
and Sciences never bolstered the ailing
program with funding.

However, according to a 1986 agree
ment, Stanford is under no obligation to
help fund the program. Cohen noted that
the bulk of funding for the program has
always come from outside sources. The
Committee for Jazz at Stanford, made
up of University and community support
ers, recognizes this agreement.
"The jazz committee always knew they
were responsible for the funding of the
program. ... No promises were made,"
according to department administrator
Melinda Mcgee.
The primary financial source for the
program has been Stanford alumnus
John Blokker, who agreed in 1986 to
finance Stanford's pilot program in jazz,

The greatest problem af
flicting the jazz program is
the absence of 'ongoing
fund raising.'

according to Cohen.
Getz coincident ally met Blokker in 1986
and told him he wanted to help build the
jazz program. In a collective effort, Getz,
Blokker, Cohen and jazz program director
Jim Nadel — along with interested fac
ulty members — initiated the program

that same year.
Before then, the jazz program merely
consisted of a jazz band and saxophone
instruction.
When the Music Department launched
the expanded program three years ago,
music fans at Stanford and around the
Bay Area were excited about new classes,
jazz combo groups and quarterly concerts
— all energized by the world-famous
Getz, now 62.
In three years, the program evolved
from a pilot program to an integrated
part of the Music Department, success
fully generating student involvement.
A course in jazz history taught
by lecturer Ted Gioia was popular
with students. But because of the
funding difficulties, Gioia is no
longer with the program.
The jazz combo groups, which
have won several national com
petitions, offered new opportuni
ties for student musicians.
The emerging program
employed Getz as artist-in
residence, giving the program a
considerable amount of credibility
and exposure. Getz provided
saxophone instruction and per
formed in four concerts each year
as part of his duties in the pro
gram.
Despite student, faculty and
community enthusiasm for the
program, a variety of problems
arose.
This summer's jazz concert in
Frost Amphitheater, starring
Getz and other performing
groups, raised onty $8,000. The
concert the previous year with
Getz and the Manhattan Transfer

netted $70,000, according to
Cohen.
In addition, Getz has been ill
this year and is no longer an active
part of the program. Getz was to
perform this month with the
Stanford Symphony Orchestra as
a benefit for the jazz program,
but the concert was cancelled.
