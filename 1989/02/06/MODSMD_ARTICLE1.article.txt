# Ailing jazz program sings financial blues to tune of $40,000

The Stanford Jazz Program emerged
in 1986 as a promising addition to the
Music Department, but because of major
funding problems, susbstantial parts of
the program have shut down.
Almost without warning, the Music De
partment dropped its two jazz classes at
the start of this quarter. Prize-winning
jazz combo groups which had toured the
nation last year disassembled. Stan Getz,
widely recognized as one of the premiere
saxophone players of his time, is no longer
"artist-in-residence" for the program.
In just its first quarter of operation
this year, the jazz program has been

swamped by $40,000 of red ink.
A tight budget has forced the depart
ment "to retrench a large portion of the
jazz program beginning with this winter
quarter, probably for the remainder of
the academic year," according to Prof.
Albert Cohen, acting chair of the Music
Department. The jazz program has now
reverted to its rudimentary pre-1986
status.
Although the program is part of the
University's academic curriculum, Stan
ford has not given the program significant
financial backing. Despite a request from
Cohen this fall, the School of Humanities
and Sciences never bolstered the ailing
program with funding.

However, according to a 1986 agree
ment, Stanford is under no obligation to
help fund the program. Cohen noted that
the bulk of funding for the program has
always come from outside sources. The
Committee for Jazz at Stanford, made
up of University and community support
ers, recognizes this agreement.
"The jazz committee always knew they
were responsible for the funding of the
program. ... No promises were made,"
according to department administrator
Melinda Mcgee.
The primary financial source for the
program has been Stanford alumnus
John Blokker, who agreed in 1986 to
finance Stanford's pilot program in jazz,

The greatest problem af
flicting the jazz program is
the absence of 'ongoing
fund raising.'

according to Cohen.
Getz coincident ally met Blokker in 1986
and told him he wanted to help build the
jazz program. In a collective effort, Getz,
Blokker, Cohen and jazz program director
Jim Nadel — along with interested fac
ulty members — initiated the program

that same year.
Before then, the jazz program merely
consisted of a jazz band and saxophone
instruction.
When the Music Department launched
the expanded program three years ago,
music fans at Stanford and around the
Bay Area were excited about new classes,
jazz combo groups and quarterly concerts
— all energized by the world-famous
Getz, now 62.
In three years, the program evolved
from a pilot program to an integrated
part of the Music Department, success
fully generating student involvement.
