BEIJING (AP) — Soviet Pres
ident Mikhail Gorbachev will visit
China from May 15 to May 18
for the first summit between the
two countries since they split bit
terly 30 years ago, China an
nounced Monday.
The official Xinhua News
Agency also issued a joint Chinese-
Soviet statement on Cambodia
containing points of agreement
reached between Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
and his Chinese counterpart, Qian
Qichen, in meetings last week.
Both support a Vietnamese
troop pullout from Cambodia by
September, with "strict interna
tional supervision," and an end
to Chinese aid to Cambodia's anti-
Vietnamese guerrillas.
They still differ over the com
position of a transitional govern
ment in Cambodia from the cur
rent Vietnamese-installed Hun

Sen regime to a popularly elected
government. Xinhua said the two
sides will continue to discuss their
differences. However, China ap
parently considers the Cambodian
problem close enough to resolu
tion to go ahead with a Chinese-
Soviet summit.
One of its conditions for a sum
mit has been a Vietnamese with
drawal from Cambodia after a
decade of occupation.
The Soviet news agency Tass
announced Sunday the summit
would be held May 15-18. Xinhua
did not say why the Chinese
Foreign Ministry waited more
than 24 hours after Shevardnadze
ended his visit to announced the
date.
Shevardnadze told a news con
ference in Beijing on Saturday
that the two sides agreed the sum
mit would be held in mid-May,
and the Soviet Embassy privately

said on Saturday the date was
May 15.
However, in a blunt contradic
tion minutes after Shevardnad
ze's plane took off, Chinese Dep
uty Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei
insisted no date was fixed and his
government was still considering
the matter.
Shevardnadze also was two
hours late arriving in Beijing for
his news conference from Shan
ghai, where he had met with
senior Chinese leader Deng Xiaop
ing. In the absence of any official
explanation, speculation arose
that a hitch had developed in set
ting the summit date.
The summit will officially nor
malize relations that turned hos
tile in 1960 over differences in
ideology and strategy.
Trade, cultural and other ex
changes have increased sharply in
the past few years.
