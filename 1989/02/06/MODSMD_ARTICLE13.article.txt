A foreign ministry source, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Stroessner,
who has property in the area, was to stay
in Itumbiara "only temporarily."

considered Stroessner's heir apparent. Also
granted asylum were Gustavo's wife,
Maria; six security guards; and ex-Foreign

Roberto Pinto, chief of the Brazilian Em

bassy's political section in Asuncion.

in a coup in 1954 and remained
commander-in-chief of Paraguay's armed
forces until Thursday night, when
Rodriguez led the coup against him.
Rodriguez was sworn in as president on
Friday.
The two are linked by the marriage of
Stroessner's son Alfredo and Rodriguez'
daughter Marta, and share grandchildren.
As he left his country for perhaps the
last time, the 76-year-old Stroessner wore
a blue suit and red tie. He did not .>r
knowledge the crowd and made no final
gesture.
The two black limousines that carried
Stroessner's entourage to the airport were
accompanied by truckloads of soldiers in
combat gear.

near the capital since he was captured early
Friday after a night of fighting. The death
toll from the coup has been estimated at
up to 300, but no official figures have been
given.
A funeral Mass for the victims was cel
ebrated Sunday evening.
