Gasoline prices slightly increase
LOS ANGELAS (AP) — The average price of
gasoline nationwide increased .23 cent in the past
two weeks to 98.48 cents a gallon but there is
no indication of any strong increases at the mo
ment, an industry survey said Sunday.
The latest survey concluded Feb. 3, said oil
industry analyst Trilby Lundberg. The average
of the previous survey was 98.25 cents on Jan. 20.
The average wholesale price has gone up almost
a penny, pressuring retailers to pass on costs,
but because of mixed movement around the coun
try and a low-consumption period, strong in
creases "don't seem to be a likelihood," Lundberg
said.
At self-serve pumps prices per gallon were:
regular unleaded 88.16 cents; premium unleaded
104.41 cents; and regular leaded 84.82 cents.
At full-serve pumps prices per gallon were:

regular unleaded 118.39 cents; premium unleaded
129.97; and regular leaded 114.75 cents.
The Lundberg Survey checks prices at 12,000
gas stations nationwide.
Plane makes emergency landing
CLEVELAND (AP) — A contintental Airlines
jet carrying 29 passengers and six crew members
bound for Lansing, Mich., returned to Cleveland
Hopkins International Airport safely Sunday
after smoke entered part of the cabin.
The DC-9 jet left the airport about 7 p.m. and
had been in the air for about one-half hour when
an emergency light indicating a problem in the
air conditioning system went on, Continental
spokesman Ned Walker said from Houston.
The plane returned to the airport about 8 p.m.
and the passengers exited safely and were to take
another jet to Lansing later Sunday night, Walker
said.
