Stanford should show
more support for
Asian-American studies

THE SUCCESS of Leland
Stanford's Central Pacific
Railroad company
depended on the labor of nearly
12,000 Chinese Americans in the
late 1860s. And the profits from
his railroad allowed him to found
the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity.
Now, however, this same uni
versity institutionally ignores the
contributions, history and cul
ture of Asian-Americans living in
the United States.
No tenured faculty members at
Stanford teach Asian-American
studies. History 267: "Topics in
Asian-American History," is the
only departmental Asian-
American studies course cur
rently offered. And students for
the past three years have signed
up for that seminar in numbers
far greater than permitted by the
25-student limit.
But now the professor of the
class, Gordon Chang, is consid
ering accepting a tenured post at
UC-Irvine. Without him, student
taught SWOPSI classes would be
Stanford's only academic ac
knowledgement of this important
field.
This is unacceptable. The so
cial, political and cultural heri
tage and contributions of Asian-
Americans to American life
deserve whole-hearted study at
Stanford, particularly since
Asian-American students now
constitute the largest ethnic
group on campus.
Asian-American studies
courses have been offered at San

Francisco State and UC-Berkeley
since 1969. Twenty-four univer
sities in California have Asian-
American studies programs. Cor
nell University is starting up a
program, while universities such
as Harvard, Yale, Wellesley, Tufts
and Boston all regularly offer
several Asian-American studies
classes.
By virtue of Stanford's perch
on the Pacific rim, Stanford has
even more of an incentive to ded
icate itself to the scholarship of
Asian-American history and in
fluence.
California's heritage is in
separably tied to the contribu
tions and travails of Asian Amer
icans — from the 1942 intern
ment of more than 100,000
Japanese Americans to the devel
opment of agriculture, the fishing
industry and the railroads at the
hands of Americans of Asian des
cent.
With the CIV decision last year
and greater funding for ethnic
deans, Stanford has indicated a
renewed commitment to imple
menting and expanding programs
devoted to ethnic studies and un
derstanding.
Academic programs for the
study of other ethnic groups,
such as Afro-American Studies
and the Chicano Fellows pro
gram, though admittedly limited,
do exist and flourish.
The curriculum of the East-
Asian Studies Department does
not address the history or expe
riences of Americans of Asian
descent; it provides "broad expo
sure to China or Japan (or East
Asia as a whole)," according to
Courses and Degrees 1988-89.
If Stanford wants to align its
curriculum with its ideals, hiring
a tenured Asian-American his
tory professor is not only fair,
but necessary.
