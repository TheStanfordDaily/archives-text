Alpha Epsilon Pi party flier objectified women

WE ARE WRITING to draw
attention and voice our strong
objection to a flier distributed
on campus recently. The flier advertises
a party sponsored by the Alpha Ep
silon Pi Fraternity.
It quotes from the Billy Joel song,
"Only the Good Die Young," but it is
not the words that we find objec
tionable; rather, we are troubled that
the flier is dominated by a large photo
graph of a bikini-clad woman striking
a seductive pose.
To us, this is a blatant example of
the objectification of a woman's body.
Such imagery must be seen as danger
ous, for it reduces women to nothing
more than the objects of men's sexual
desires.
The flier does nothing to describe
the party itself. It merely offers its
audience the implicit promise of sex,
thereby linking the notion of "a good

The flier... offers its audi
ence the implicit promise
of sex.

time" to the availability of women at
the disposal of male partygoers.
The distributors of this flier must be
condemned for their thoughtless and
irresponsible act. We must be careful,
however, not to view this as an iso
lated incident. We are constantly ex
posed to the objectification and ex
ploitation of women in advertisements,
television programming and movies.
By distributing this flier, though, its
authors accept and perpetuate the
ideas behind such imagery: that the
primary role of women is to satisfy the
sexual desires of men.

The flier displays a fundamental lack
of respect for women as equals. It is
this lack of respect that has extremely
dangerous implications for our society
— and even for the Stanford commu
nity itself.
One such implication is rape. The
alarming frequency of both violent rape
and date rape on college campuses —
Stanford included — demands that we
confront the problem. We cannot afford
to look the other way when a flier
such as this appears on our bulletin
boards or in our cafeterias.
The Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity
must be held accountable for producing
the flier; by the same standard, we
must all be held accountable if we do
not raise our voices in objection to it.
