# Women's genitals should not be considered dirty
## 
### 
It was ironic that the poem I was
reading at the Coffee House last Sun
day night was criticized as being "sick"
and "pornographic." The man who
made this outburst was not listening.
The first half of "Each Bird
WaJking," by Tess Gallagher, begins
with the narrator thinking of her
lover, who is washing his mother. It
goes into detail as he washes her arms,
back and then her private parts.
The second half deals with a
physicality which transcends the
boundaries of sex.
It was right before I read this sec
ond half of the poem that I was bel-

ligerently interrupted by a man who
considered this reference to a woman's
genitalia to be "sick" and "pornograph
ic." In this case, it was the listener
who attached sexuality to the image of
a woman's genitalia.
It is inevitable that images and as
sociations made in the past influence
how something is interpreted. I can't
help but wonder how many of those
past images result from exposure to a
media which continually objectifies
women by displaying women's body
parts in an exploitative way.
To those of you listening that night,
did you automatically cringe when the
poet offered the image of the mother's
private parts?
The possibility that some may auto
matically attach dirtiness and shame to
a reference in a creative work to wom
en's genitalia is very disturbing.
