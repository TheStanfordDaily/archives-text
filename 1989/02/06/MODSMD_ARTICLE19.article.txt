# Chens enthusiasts are not always sexist white men
## 
### 
Sunday's outburst during a poetry
reading at the Coffee House brought to
life the stereotype of a sexist white
male who is silencing a woman and her
poetry.
I am afraid that it may also have
brought to life the stereotype that all
chess players are sexist white males.
However, three women from Hun
gary are revolutionizing the image of
women in chess. Zsusza Polgar, 19,
Zsofia Polgar, 14, and Judit Polgar, 12,
are world-class chess players.
Their results are impressive: For
example, Judit Polgar, now ranked
65th in the world, is clearly the

strongest 12-year-old chess player of all
time.
Last December the Polgars actually
played in a women's competition for
the first time by representing Hungary
in the Chess Olympiad, a world team
championship. "Team Polgar" won the
gold medal — handing the USSR its
first loss ever in an Olympiad.
Hopefully this change at the top of
the chess world will have a positive
effect on the behavior and the image
of chess players.
