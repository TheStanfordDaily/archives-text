# Cat lovers push for compromise
## 
### Mike Habata 
As the University's plan to trap
feral cats draws closer, a dedicated
group of cat lovers is working to
improve the life of the campus'
abandoned felines.
While working within the con
straints of the policy announced
Jan. 27, the network of cat adv
ocates is attempting to forge a
compromise with the administra
tion on the details of identifying
and registering the cats. Equally
important to the group are its
plans to educate the Stanford
community that is responsible for
proper care of homeless cats.
In a Friday interview with The
Daily, three principal members of
the network expressed their con
cerns over widespread ignorance
about the nature of the stray cat
problem at Stanford. University
staff members Christina Peck,
Carole Hyde and Carole Miller
said their primary concern was
that most cats in the Stanford
community are not receiving
proper care.
Described by Miller as "half
way between domesticated and
wild cats," 200 to 300 strays on
campus depend on humans to pro
vide them with food.
According to Peck, the problem
begins when "someone decides
they can no longer take care of
his or her cat" and abandons the
animal. Because they are not ac
customed to feeding themselves,
the cats are attracted to easy
sources of food, including student
residences and staffed offices and
departments.
Like the truly wild cats, aban
doned domesticated cats usually
have not been fixed or desexed.
Thus during the spring kitten
season, even one pair of cats can
reproduce at "phenomenal" rates,
according to Hyde.
When someone continues to
feed a homeless cat without
spaying or neutering it, the per
son only exacerbates the problem
of homeless cats, Peck said.
"The problem is a human one
and not the fault of the cats,"
Miller said.
Regardless of this concern, the
University will begin trapping all
wild cats, starting Feb. 27, to
reduce the feline overpopulation.
The University has agreed to a
compromise with the cat adv
ocates: if the cats being properly
cared for are registered, and can
be visually distinguised as such,
they will be released immediately.
While not questioning the basic
policy set forth by the University,
the cat advocates have questioned
the sensibility of some of its
details.
For example, Miller said cats

often get their limbs stuck in the
collars and tags which are cur
rently required to identify them
and tend to chew away at those
immobilized limbs.
The cat advocates favor some
form of ear tag that does not come
off easily and does not hinder the
mobility of the cat.
Also, the current policy allows
those caring for the cats to obtain
their tags only after demonstrat
ing that the felines have been
fixed and vaccinated, requiring
the cats to be trapped a second
time within the time period al
lowed by the policy.
In a meeting scheduled for early
this week with Pete Sidebottom
of the Office of Public Affairs, the
cat advocates plan to discuss these
options with the administration.
Concerning the chances for a com
promise of some sort, Sidebottom
insisted upon two criteria for the
cat policy: that "the cats are prop
erly cared for," and that "the dif
ference between a registered and
unregistered cat be made suffi
ciently clear."
Sidebottom said he promised to
be open to proposals if he were

satisfied that they met those
criteria.
Once the immediate concern of
protecting the homeless cats has
passed, the network plans to ed
ucate the community and increase
public awareness of the issue.
They are currently discussing
sending out fliers to student res
idences through Res Ed and
hosting meetings in dorms, Peck
said.
Responding to criticism that the
cats pose health risks, the cat adv
ocates rejected most of the
charges as not applicable to the
dependent and cared-for cats since
they will be properly vaccinated.
Though the administration and
the cat advocates share the con
cern that cats on campus are prop
erly cared for, the welfare of
"living creatures" does not seem
to represent a major concern to
the administration, said the adv
ocates. Instead of treating it as a
"bureaucratic issue," said Millor,
it is important to view the home
less cats on campus as something
concerning the entire community.

spaying or neutering it, the per
son only exacerbates the problem
of homeless cats, Peck said.
"The problem is a human one
and not the fault of the cats,"
Miller said.
Regardless of this concern, the
University will begin trapping all
wild cats, starting Feb. 27, to
reduce the feline overpopulation.
The University has agreed to a
compromise with the cat adv
ocates: if the cats being properly
cared for are registered, and can
be visually distinguised as such,
they will be released immediately.
While not questioning the basic
policy set forth by the University,
the cat advocates have questioned
the sensibility of some of its
details.
For example, Miller said cats

often get their limbs stuck in the
collars and tags which are cur
rently required to identify them
and tend to chew away at those
immobilized limbs.
The cat advocates favor some
form of ear tag that does not come
off easily and does not hinder the
mobility of the cat.
Also, the current policy allows
those caring for the cats to obtain
their tags only after demonstrat
ing that the felines have been
fixed and vaccinated, requiring
the cats to be trapped a second
time within the time period al
lowed by the policy.
In a meeting scheduled for early
this week with Pete Sidebottom
of the Office of Public Affairs, the
cat advocates plan to discuss these
options with the administration.
Concerning the chances for a com
promise of some sort, Sidebottom
insisted upon two criteria for the
cat policy: that "the cats are prop
erly cared for," and that "the dif
ference between a registered and
unregistered cat be made suffi
ciently clear."
Sidebottom said he promised to
be open to proposals if he were

satisfied that they met those
criteria.
Once the immediate concern of
protecting the homeless cats has
passed, the network plans to ed
ucate the community and increase
public awareness of the issue.
They are currently discussing
sending out fliers to student res
idences through Res Ed and
hosting meetings in dorms, Peck
said.
Responding to criticism that the
cats pose health risks, the cat adv
ocates rejected most of the
charges as not applicable to the
dependent and cared-for cats since
they will be properly vaccinated.
Though the administration and
the cat advocates share the con
cern that cats on campus are prop
erly cared for, the welfare of
"living creatures" does not seem
to represent a major concern to
the administration, said the adv
ocates. Instead of treating it as a
"bureaucratic issue," said Millor,
it is important to view the home
less cats on campus as something
concerning the entire community.
