## Living in our parking lot 
### 
AT THE BEGINNING of the year,
cars come and go in the parking
lots of the different houses in the
Cowell Cluster.
Students borrow a parent's car to move
things from home to dorm. Parents who
aren't sure where they should be parking
for the Orientation Week festivities often
park anywhere that isn't painted red.
And of course, boyfriends and girlfriends
are around to help out with the move,
bringing their cars with them.
After the first two weeks, though, these
extraneous cars leave, and the residents'
cars become familiar. There are the brand
new Japanese cars, the slightly older
Volvos, and the übiquitous VW vans that
have seen many miles, but few if any
dents.
So what about the ugly little brown
car that hasn't been washed in years?
What is it doing here? And why is that
man always inside of it?
He dressed shabbily, wearing the same
dull gray-brown clothes every day. His
hair hung down well below the fashion
able length, and his brows swallowed up
his shrunken, reddened eyes. If a person
stood close enough, he could detect the
sick smell of urine, sweat and dirt, could
see the traces of all these on the dingy
pants and shirt. But the man never hurt
anybody.
So why did I call the cops on this poor
soul? Because he didn't belong. Here was
a strange man who didn't bathe living
in our parking lot, watching every move
we made, perhaps watching our house
for every opportunity to break in.
But his going in wasn't the problem.

The problem was our coming out — at
night. As a woman I did not feel safe
knowing that a strange man was living
in our parking lot and knew other women
in the Cowell Cluster agreed with me. 1
didn't know why he lived out of an ugly
blue truck and drove around in an ugly
brown car. I didn't know he didn't wash
or change his clothes. I only knew that
he scared me, and 1 wanted him gone.
The first time I called the police, they
sent over two cars 20 minutes after my
call. The man had left by then, but they
told me to call them again if he returned.
He did, four hours later. Again I called,
again they came too late. After one more
failed attempt, they finally came while
he was still there, and what a show they
put on.
Two patrol cars came into the parking
lot, headlights off, red light off. They
came slowly to the entrance, parked just
inside, and all four officers got out of
the cars, billy clubs in hand. The three
men of the group approached the brown
car from behind, making sure the man
didn't make any sudden moves. At this
point I couldn't see any more, so I waited
in the kitchen for the report.
I had psyched myself into believing the
man was a psychopath. He was a dan
gerous Ted Bundy type and they would
cart him and his ugly cars away. But
that wasn't the real story. They sent the
woman cop in to talk to me.
She told me the man was HOMELESS.
He lived in his car because he had been
EVICTED, and not only that, but his
license had been suspended because he
COULDN'T PAY for insurance. Thev

asked him to leave, and he did so, peace
fully. He couldn't drive so he walked,
leaving his cars to be dealt with later.
"He'll probably sleep in the park," the
cop told me. Then she looked at me
reproachfully, said goodnight, and left.
And I, the villain of the piece, went up
to my room and cried.
In the Paul Simon song "Homeless"
the victims appear as distant, almost
mythical creatures. They live in a far
away land whose problems seem less real
to us than the events that transpire every
day on "One Life to Live."
Yet homelessness has never been a
problem foreign to the United States.
The countless men and women who line
the subways and cover every park bench
in Central Park will testify to that.
Still, they seem unreal, like actors per
forming in a morality play about the evils
of drinking. Until a homeless person has
set up camp on your doorstep, he will
never be more than an inconvenience to
the eye, and perhaps an impediment to
easy passage.
Afterwards, he will always be a real
man, she will always be a real women,
even though they are "homeless, home
less, the moonlight sleeping on a mid
night lake."
