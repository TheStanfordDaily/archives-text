## Seductive appeal of prejudice not limited to extremist groups 
### 
CLOSE YOUR EYES and concen
trate. Go back about 20 years or
so. Think: You are white, and
the country is near war with itself
over Vietnam and civil rights. Imagine
that, in your mail this day, you receive
a fundraising appeal. You tear it open
and glance over the contents: a letter,
a donation card with little check-the
amount boxes on it, and a business
reply mail envelope. The usual.
But something catches your eye as
you head for the trash can. The fourth
paragraph in the four-page cover letter
consists of a single sentence:
"The Negro presence on the college
campus is poisoning the minds of our
young people."
The letter goes on to argue that
blacks like Rev. Martin Luther King,
Jr., in league with communists, stand
to undermine American culture and
values by indoctrinating young whites.
Something must be done about
Them.
Who might have sent this? Sure
enough: the Ku Klux Klan. A 1989

version might have been sent by the
White Aryan Resistance. The final
message comes through clearly: Only
We can stop Them. You ignore this
appeal. Other whites do not.
Now roll your mind back one more
generation and imagine a second scene.
You are a white Californian at the end
of 1941. Along with several holiday
greeting cards, the postman delivers a
fundraising note. The fourth paragraph
of the letter inside states:
"The Japanese presence on the
college campus is poisoning the minds
of our young people."
The note argues that the Japanese,
including naturalized and natural-born
Japanese-Americans, have long been
laying the groundwork for a Japanese
takeover of the United States, starting
with the West Coast. Their ability to
surprise us at Pearl Harbor proves
that they are all in league against us.
And now they are indoctrinating Amer
ican youth — propagandizing that the
war is America's fault.

Something must be done about
Them.
We must, the letter concludes, intern
the "Japs" — temporarily, of course —
both for our security and theirs; after
all, there is a war on. Only We can
stop Them. You ignore the note.
Others do not.
Clear your mind a third time, and
push time back another decade. You
are a Protestant German wending your
way through the cobbled streets of
Munich in 1929. A closely-cropped
young man in military-style garb
hands you a leaflet on culture in
Germany, and on why the economy is
collapsing. Its fourth paragraph reads:
"The Jewish presence in the univer
sity is poisoning the minds of our
young people."
The Jews, you read, stand behind all
of Germany's woes, and hope to
enslave the world.
Something must be done about
Them.
By now you have become familiar

with the polite ravings of the National
Socialist German Workers' Party,
which in fact printed the pamphlet,
and you pay little attention to their
droning appeal: Only We can stop
Them. You ignore the leaflet. Other
Germans do not.
Open your eyes. It is 1989 again. We
have made tremendous strides in our
attempts to eradicate bigotry, but still
that demon plagues every society on
Earth.
America is no exception. Hatred dies
a slow death, and many organizations
have sprouted to help quash it that
much sooner. For nearly a century the
National Association for the Advance
ment of Colored People has struggled
for the peaceful social progress of
minorities to levels approaching parity
with whites. And for decades, the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith
has fought not only anti-semitism but
also all manner of prejudice.
Close your eyes one last time. I mag

ine that you receive a letter about
cultural and religious decline in
America. Its fourth paragraph reads:
"The Arab presence on the college
campus is poisoning the minds of our
young people."
Arabs, it says here, have begun
conversationally cornering Jewish
college students in the dormitories,
brainwashing them into a self-hatred of
their faith and culture. These Arabs
even inject doubts about Israel and the
PLO.
Something must be done about
Them.
Only We can stop Them.
The letter is signed: Seymour Reich,
President.
B'nai B'rith International.
Open your eyes. For this is no mere
supposition. I really received that
letter. I ignored it. Others might not.
