Wed., Feb. 12, 1919
The Daily Palo Alto:
Stanford University Pres
ident Ray Lyman Wilbur ap
proved a policy recom
mended by the Board of
Control of Athletics that
American football be played
as an intercollegiate sport at
Stanford.
Stating that the Univer
sity would apply to the
Pacific Coast Conference
Schedule Committee for
games "with various west
ern institutions," President
Wilbur noted that "it is not
improbable that the Univer
sity of California will apply
through the conference for
games with Stanford."
Tues., Feb. 10, 1959
The Stanford Daily:
Fraternities Zeta Psi and
Phi Gamma Delta were
suspended from campus and
Sigma Chi, Phi Delta Theta,
Delta Kappa Epsilon and
Delta Tau Delta were placed
on social probation as a
result of a Jan. 30 party in
Los Altos at which 300 stu
dents were present.
"Most Stanford students
probably agree that throw
ing beer on uniformed offi
cers and throwing cherry
bombs in a crowd (one girl
required several stitches as
a result) are definitely be
yond the bounds of common
sense and common decency,"
said a Feb. 11 Daily edito
rial. "The correction . . . lies
in revamping our living sys
tem and educational proc
esses."
Wed., Feb. 12, 1969
The Stanford Daily:
The Ad Hoc Senate Com
mittee on ROTC released its
recommendation that no ac
ademic credit be granted for
ROTC courses and that mil
itary training on campus be
conducted according to rules
governing voluntary student
activities.
"As a formal, on-campus
program, sponsored, sanc
tioned and partially sup
ported by Stanford Univer
sity," said the majority
report, "the ROTC program
is not compatible with the
University."
