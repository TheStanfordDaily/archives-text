"Stories in an Almost Classical Mode"
by Harold Brodkey

For over 30 years, Harold Brodkey
has been publishing some of the finest
fiction and poetry of our time. Yet he
remains oddly unknown.
This obscurity seems, at least in
part, a result of his sparse publishing.
Brodkey's stories have appeared at the
rate of fewer than one per year. His
new collection, "Stories in an Almost
Classical Mode," is only the second
book-length publication of his career.
It follows the first by a startling 30
years.

'Someone who claims to
write with emotion recol
lected in tranquilty is a
fool and a liar. To under
stand is to tremble.'

Brodkey's relative obscurity may
also be due to the discomfiting nature
of his work. Writer Raymond Carver
once said that "a little menace is fine
to have in a story." Most of Carver's
stories do have a little menace, a
menace that has challenged the way
we look at ourselves, our fellow citizens
and our nation.
Brodkey's stories, too, have a certain
menace. But his is of a different nature.
Brodkey's menace is huge and dark
and lurks in virtually every line of his
work. It attacks our basic perceptions,
and demands that we look at our ex
istence and the world in new and often
frightening ways.
In "Innocence," one of the works in
"Stories in an Almost Classical Mode,"
Brodkey tells us, "I distrust sum
maries, any kind of gliding through
time, any too great a claim that one
is in control of what one recounts; I
think someone who claims to write
with emotion recollected in tranquility
is a fool and a liar. To understand is
to tremble. To recollect is to reenter
and be riven ... I admire the authority
of being on one's knees in front of the
event."

It is from his knees that Brodkey
writes, and it is on our knees that we
must receive. Sustaining this position
as readers requires tremendous effort,
and after each story we find ourselves
exhausted. In"The Pain Continuum,"
Brodkey tells us, "Pain does not have
to be charted unless one is determined
to escape: And then it is charted only
so that one can find a way to its edge
in order to see the world again."
Brodkey creates such maps of pain
in many of his stories. His work forces
the reader to crawl around in the pain
of the event, in the comprehension of
it. We crawl for 20, 30 or 100 pages.
We crawl for so long we begin to feel
we can crawl no longer and that the
crawling will never end. It is at this
point that Brodkey leads us to an edge
from which we can stand again, and
start to walk, shakily, uncertainly, into
the new world.
Brodkey's stories generate from the
hidden and the secret: those odd,
strange, often humiliating, frightening
or simply painful events that we no
longer remember and never divulge.
Brodkey does not merely tell us of
these events, nor does he describe them
for us. Instead, he brings us with him
as he reenters them and kneels before
them.
In "Play" and in "Puberty," the au
thor recounts a young boy's in
credulous terror as his sister tortures
him under the porch of their house.
In "Innocence," Brodkey creates the
first orgasm of a young woman, and
for 20 unmerciful pages he masterfully
and graphically describes the event.
The perspective Brodkey brings to
these events alters our normal under
standing of them. Brodkey mines the
darkest recesses of every experience
for all that each can say. He il
luminates and amplifies to an almost
unbearable intensity of reality, ac
curacy and truth.
Memory is primary to Brodkey's
work. He has admitted to spending
eight years on a couch just teaching
himself how to remember. One of the
things he remembers best is light.
Light permeates these stories, provid
ing the backdrop to many of Brodkey's
experiences.
The experiences of childhood also
figure heavily in Brodkey's work.
Reading Brodkey's stories of youth,

one feels very much like a child expe
riencing his first disillusionments, his
first falls into the world.
Despite Brodkey's preoccupation
with pain, his final message seems
often to be one of hope and strength,
one of belief in endurance. It is the
same message we find at the end of
"The Pain Continuum," when the
young boy, resurrected from his suf
fering, tells us: "I make an odd, loud
breathing noise â€” I don't know/ I go
in search of what comfort there is for
me now."
Born in 1930, in Stanton, 111. Brod
key grew up in St. Louis, Mo. and
graduated from Harvard College. His
stories have appeared in The New
Yorker and other magazines since the

early 19505. Brodkey's first book,
"First Love and Sorrows," a collection
of nine stories, was first published in
1958 and has been recently reissued.
Brodkey has received numerous
honors, including first-place 0. Henry
Awards in 1975 and 1976, fellowships
from the American Academy in Rome,
the National Endowment for the Arts
and the John Simon Guggenheim
Memorial Foundation. He has been a
teacher of both writing and literature
at Cornell University and at City Col
lege of the City University of New
York. He lives with his wife, novelist
Ellen Schwamm, in New York City.

Torben von Staden is a senior in Eng
lish and French literature.
