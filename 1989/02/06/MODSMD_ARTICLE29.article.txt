# Taylor to read
## 
### 
Peter Taylor, acclaimed novelist, short story
writer and dramatist, will read from his work at
8 p.m. tonight in Kresge Auditorium. The
reading is the first offering in this year's Jean
and Bill Lane Lecture Series sponsored by the
creative writing program.
Born in 1917 in Trenton, Tennessee, Taylor
credits the oral tradition of the South for instilling
in him the "story telling urge." He attended
Vanderbilt University, Southwestern at Memphis
and Kenyon College, where he earned his bach
elor's in 1940.
Widely regarded as one of the most accom
plished writers of the short story, Taylor is es
pecially admired for dialogue, his smoothly
paced style and his careful development of
character.
During the course of his illustrious career,
Taylor has been awarded a Guggenheim Fel
lowship, the O. Henry Award, a Fullbright fel
lowship, a Rockefeller Foundation grant and a
Ford Foundation fellowship. In 1979 he was
awarded the National Institute of the Arts and
Letters gold medal for literature.
In the "Sewanee Review," George Garrett,
director of the writing program at University of
Virginia, Charlottesville, wrote of Taylor, "There
are few American writers, living or dead, who
have for so long a time received so much
praise — and this from the most honored quar
ters — for artistic achievement. For thirty years
now, ... Taylor's stories have been admired,
analyzed, anthologized, preserved as major
models of excellence for all other writers."
