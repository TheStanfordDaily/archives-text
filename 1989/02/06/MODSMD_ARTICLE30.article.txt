collaboration of architecture and anthropolgy
is the first book-length, fully illustrated study of
North American Indian architecture to appear
in the last 100 years.

Books, located at 1491 Shattuck (at Vine) in
Berkeley. For more information, call 486-0698.
Janet Kaplan will discuss and show slides
of her new book "Unexpected Journeys: The
Att and Life of Remedios Varo." This is the first
book in English on the Spanish surrealist,
feminist, and mystical painter who exiled herself
first in Paris and then, finding Paris impossible
("I'd rather sit on the floor in the market of
Toluca and sell tortillas than have anything to
do with those artistic bitches of Paris"), in
Mexico. This event will be held at 8 p.m. at
Black Oaks Books in Berkeley.
