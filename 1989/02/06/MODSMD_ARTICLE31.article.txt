## Cardinal makes luggage out of Gators, 84-69 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
According to Stanford men's
basketball Coach Mike Mont
gomery, it was some time last
summer when CBS made contact
with Stanford and Florida to ar
range a network-televised game
for the 1988-89 season.

Men's Basketball
Cardinal 84, Gators 69

It was none of Stanford or
Florida's doing. They were not
even scheduled to play each other
the schools had only met once
!,-,'fore ever. CBS basically picked
the two preseason top-20 schools
and said, "We want you," much
like Uncle Sam would have said
to a green recruit.
For CBS, it was just another of
the thousands of games it has
televised over the years. For Stan
lord, it was network-TV game No.
1.
Hut the newcomers to the tube
on the 20th-ranked Cardinal may
have given CBS a hint or two
about future programming. Stan
ford (now 17-5) never trailed dur
ing its 84-69 win over the Gators
1 1 -10) before 14,687 at the grand
opening of the Orlando Arena.
The arena is the future home
ol the 1989-90 NBA expansion
franchise, the Orlando Magic, so
hey, isn't it appropriate that an
ot her team with no "s" in its nick
name should post the facility's
first win.
"This was our first game on
national television," Montgomery
,-iid "and to come into a place
I ke this and win is great."
With its performance, Stanford
put forth a good argument for
lying featured on the networks
igain. Here are some of the future
lars CBS might find it wants to
show more of after studying the
game tape:
Best performance, male lead —
Todd Lichti. The Stanford guard
lit up the small screen with 27
points from every spot of the
court. His pull-up 16-foot jumper
just inside the four-minute mark
of the first half gave Stanford its
biggest lead to that point, 40-27.
And, after the Gators had got
ten back within five, 46-41, on a
floor-shaking rebound-dunk by
Dwayne Davis, with 16:15 to go
in the game, Lichti's soaring jam
with 13:13 left, capping a 7-1 run
by the Cardinal, opened up a 53-
12 Stanford lead.
" Todd Lichti shot the ball the
way he always seems to," Mont
gomery said, "right through the
hoop."
Lichti almost got his first career
triple-double, finishing with a

team-high eight rebounds and
seven assists (which tied his
career high), and also set his 11th
school record. With 12 free throws
Saturday, Lichti breezed by John
Revelli (1980-84) and now has the
Stanford career foul-shot mark at
537. The Pacific 10 Conference
record of 543, held by Oregon
State's Mel Counts (1961-64),
awaits.
Best supporting actor —
Howard Wright. Wright set the
tone for the game by slam
dunking Stanford's opening
points and kept Stanford going by
scoring 10 points during Stan
ford's 15-6 run in the second half
that put the game out of reach.
He also successfully battled 7-
foot-2, 265-pound Florida center
Dwayne Schintzius, who he held
to 13 points, seven below his
average.
"He's gonna be a force to reckon
with," said Wright (6-8, 235)
about Schintzius. "But if I can't
get around a 7-2, 250-pound guy
I don't need to be out there."
Best makeup — Adam Keefe.
The 6-9 freshman reserve was
forced into a lot of action with
starting center Eric Reveno ham
pered by foul trouble, but showed
his tough skin in many ways. He
did his part in the battle against
Florida's Schintzius (who did have
a game-high 10 rebounds),
Livingston Chatman and Dwayne
Davis.
Though the Gators front line
was ranked fifth best in college
basketball by The Sporting News
before the season started, Stan
ford outrebounded Florida 38-36.
"Defense was the key today,"
Montgomery said. "We were able
to keep Florida's front line from
getting second and third shots.
We knew to beat Florida we had
to have the pressure. We knew
that there was nothing we could
do about Schintzius' height except
to stop the ball from getting to
him. Adam Keefe and Howard
Wright did a great job defensive
ly-"
Keefe also left some of his tough
skin on the newly-christened Or
lando court. At one point, while
lying on the ground, Keefe made
a pass which led to a Lichti fast
break drive.
"He's not a freshman," Wright
said of Keefe. "We're gonna have
to check his birth certificate."
Fantastic finishes award — tie
between Bryan McSweeney and
Terry Taylor. With just one sec
ond left on the first-half clock,
McSweeney banked home a fall
away 15-footer to send Stanford
into the locker room with a 44-33
lead. Then in the second half,
Taylor canned eight straight free
throws down the stretch as
Florida fouled in an attempt to

come back. He finished with 13
points.
Overall, a great ensemble per
formance by the Cardinal kept
Florida from ever taking the lead.
Stanford, which in an unusual
turn of events was actually out
running the opposition, quickly
led 17-6 after a 3-point field goal
by Andrew Vlahov.
A bucket bv Chatman cut it to
22-18, forcing Montgomery to call
time out. Following the break,
Stanford went on an 8-2 run to
open up a 10-point lead again, 30-

20.
In the second half, Davis' dunk
reduced the Cardinal margin to
46-41 with 16:25 to go. A 3-
pointer by Florida guard Clifford
Lett at 10:04 brought Florida to
within 60-52, but Stanford
responded with the 7-1 and 15-6
runs to keep the Gators at bay.
"This was a big win for our
team," Montgomery said. "We
were coming off a game (Stan
ford's 75-60 win over Arizona
State) where we just didn't play
well.""

"I think we lost a lot of energy
just from the nervous tension,"
said Florida Coach Norm Sloan,
who ranks 10th all time among
college coaches with 617 career
wins. "We played well in spurts,
but every time we got something
going Stanford would do some
thing to take us back out of it.
Stanford has a lot of guys who
will put their body on you and
that can wear you down."
The Cardinal next plays the
Washington State Cougars at
home Thursday night.

show more of after studying the
game tape:
Best performance, male lead —
Todd Lichti. The Stanford guard
lit up the small screen with 27
points from every spot of the
court. His pull-up 16-foot jumper
just inside the four-minute mark
of the first half gave Stanford its
biggest lead to that point, 40-27.
And, after the Gators had got
ten back within five, 46-41, on a
floor-shaking rebound-dunk by
Dwayne Davis, with 16:15 to go
in the game, Lichti's soaring jam
with 13:13 left, capping a 7-1 run
by the Cardinal, opened up a 53-
12 Stanford lead.
" Todd Lichti shot the ball the
way he always seems to," Mont
gomery said, "right through the
hoop."
Lichti almost got his first career
triple-double, finishing with a

team-high eight rebounds and
seven assists (which tied his
career high), and also set his 11th
school record. With 12 free throws
Saturday, Lichti breezed by John
Revelli (1980-84) and now has the
Stanford career foul-shot mark at
537. The Pacific 10 Conference
record of 543, held by Oregon
State's Mel Counts (1961-64),
awaits.
Best supporting actor —
Howard Wright. Wright set the
tone for the game by slam
dunking Stanford's opening
points and kept Stanford going by
scoring 10 points during Stan
ford's 15-6 run in the second half
that put the game out of reach.
He also successfully battled 7-
foot-2, 265-pound Florida center
Dwayne Schintzius, who he held
to 13 points, seven below his
average.
"He's gonna be a force to reckon
with," said Wright (6-8, 235)
about Schintzius. "But if I can't
get around a 7-2, 250-pound guy
I don't need to be out there."
Best makeup — Adam Keefe.
The 6-9 freshman reserve was
forced into a lot of action with
starting center Eric Reveno ham
pered by foul trouble, but showed
his tough skin in many ways. He
did his part in the battle against
Florida's Schintzius (who did have
a game-high 10 rebounds),
Livingston Chatman and Dwayne
Davis.
Though the Gators front line
was ranked fifth best in college
basketball by The Sporting News
before the season started, Stan
ford outrebounded Florida 38-36.
"Defense was the key today,"
Montgomery said. "We were able
to keep Florida's front line from
getting second and third shots.
We knew to beat Florida we had
to have the pressure. We knew
that there was nothing we could
do about Schintzius' height except
to stop the ball from getting to
him. Adam Keefe and Howard
Wright did a great job defensive
ly-"
Keefe also left some of his tough
skin on the newly-christened Or
lando court. At one point, while
lying on the ground, Keefe made
a pass which led to a Lichti fast
break drive.
"He's not a freshman," Wright
said of Keefe. "We're gonna have
to check his birth certificate."
Fantastic finishes award — tie
between Bryan McSweeney and
Terry Taylor. With just one sec
ond left on the first-half clock,
McSweeney banked home a fall
away 15-footer to send Stanford
into the locker room with a 44-33
lead. Then in the second half,
Taylor canned eight straight free
throws down the stretch as
Florida fouled in an attempt to

come back. He finished with 13
points.
Overall, a great ensemble per
formance by the Cardinal kept
Florida from ever taking the lead.
Stanford, which in an unusual
turn of events was actually out
running the opposition, quickly
led 17-6 after a 3-point field goal
by Andrew Vlahov.
A bucket bv Chatman cut it to
22-18, forcing Montgomery to call
time out. Following the break,
Stanford went on an 8-2 run to
open up a 10-point lead again, 30-

20.
In the second half, Davis' dunk
reduced the Cardinal margin to
46-41 with 16:25 to go. A 3-
pointer by Florida guard Clifford
Lett at 10:04 brought Florida to
within 60-52, but Stanford
responded with the 7-1 and 15-6
runs to keep the Gators at bay.
"This was a big win for our
team," Montgomery said. "We
were coming off a game (Stan
ford's 75-60 win over Arizona
State) where we just didn't play
well.""

"I think we lost a lot of energy
just from the nervous tension,"
said Florida Coach Norm Sloan,
who ranks 10th all time among
college coaches with 617 career
wins. "We played well in spurts,
but every time we got something
going Stanford would do some
thing to take us back out of it.
Stanford has a lot of guys who
will put their body on you and
that can wear you down."
The Cardinal next plays the
Washington State Cougars at
home Thursday night.

Stanford forward Howard Wright scored 17 points against Florida Saturday while helping to hold
7foot-2 Gator center Dwayne Schintzius to 13.
According to Stanford men's
basketball Coach Mike Mont
gomery, it was some time last
summer when CBS made contact
with Stanford and Florida to ar
range a network-televised game
for the 1988-89 season.

Men's Basketball
Cardinal 84, Gators 69

It was none of Stanford or
Florida's doing. They were not
even scheduled to play each other
the schools had only met once
!,-,'fore ever. CBS basically picked
the two preseason top-20 schools
and said, "We want you," much
like Uncle Sam would have said
to a green recruit.
For CBS, it was just another of
the thousands of games it has
televised over the years. For Stan
lord, it was network-TV game No.
1.
Hut the newcomers to the tube
on the 20th-ranked Cardinal may
have given CBS a hint or two
about future programming. Stan
ford (now 17-5) never trailed dur
ing its 84-69 win over the Gators
1 1 -10) before 14,687 at the grand
opening of the Orlando Arena.
The arena is the future home
ol the 1989-90 NBA expansion
franchise, the Orlando Magic, so
hey, isn't it appropriate that an
ot her team with no "s" in its nick
name should post the facility's
first win.
"This was our first game on
national television," Montgomery
,-iid "and to come into a place
I ke this and win is great."
With its performance, Stanford
put forth a good argument for
lying featured on the networks
