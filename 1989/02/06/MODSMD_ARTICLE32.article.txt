# TV coverage fails to impress

Tuning in to CBS' coverage of
Saturday's Stanford-Florida
game, the uninitiated might be a
bit confused.
The scene opens with a shot of
the Gator locker room where
Coach Norm Sloan is giving his
troops a pep talk. Not a very in
spiring one, but a pep talk none
theless.

Commentary

"I thought Stanford was the
top-20 team," one might say.
"Why the hell are they in the
Florida locker room."
Why the hell indeed?
CBS commentators James
Brown and Bill Raftery spent the
better part of the telecast telling
us all about the Southeastern
Conference non-power and virtu
ally ignoring a Stanford squad
that is headed for its first NCAA
berth in nearly a half century.
Though Eric Reveno and
Howard Wright did a superb job
in allowing 7-foot-2 Gator center
Dwayne Schintzius to barely crack
double figures, Brown and Raf
tery ignored that feat and instead
reached double figures themselves
in mentioning a leg injury to
Gator Livingston Chatman.
Constantly harping on the
mediocre Schintzius, little was
said about Todd Lichti other than
the fact that he wasn't a good
jumper and that Orlando Magic
Coach Matt Goukas didn't think
he had a good outside shot.
Odd comments when one con
siders Lichti had an explosive
slam dunk during which he was
over 3 feet off the ground. Odder
still since Lichti shoots over 50
percent from 3-point range and is
widely considered one of the top
outside shooters in the nation.
While it's true that announcers
who cover dozens of games a year
have little time to become experts
on all the teams on their schedule,
you'd figure that Brown would at
least have taken the time to learn
that its REV-e-no not Re-VE-no
before the tipoff. No such luck.
It's a shame that in the one
and only pre-NCAA network
telecast of Cardinal basketball
this year fans across the nation
got such an incomplete picture of
this top-notch basketball squad.
Maybe by the time the tourna
ment rolls around, the wizards at
CBS will do their homework and
learn that there's more to this
team than the study fiends CBS
kept making them out to be.
