Cardinal sweeps three-game series from Lions

For the Stanford baseball team this weekend, the
500's were wild in its three-game sweep of visiting
Loyola Marymount - Sunday's win marked Stan
turd Coach Mark Marquess' 500 th career win, it
brought the team to a .500 winning percentage, and
it seemed like 500 runs were scored in the wild
weekend series.
Marquess' 500 th victory came after a hard first
week of the season for the Cardinal. "We were
nakebit in the first three games, things just weren't
our way. But we beat a good team this week
end. You're "hound to get your 500 th win if you
-tick around long enough," Marquess said.
Because of a rainout on Friday, a slightly sodden
Sunken Diamond played host to a doubleheader on
Saturday. The Cardinal players had been grooming
the field all morning, however, and by game time
only the outfield was still sloppy.
The first game of the twin bill looked like Stan
lord's from the bottom of the first to the top of
the ninth. The Cardinal jumped out of the blocks
quickly, scoring at least one run in each of the first
four innings.
Stanford second baseman Frank Carey led off the
game with a home run. Then third baseman Roger
Burnett, who would prove to be the weekend's hero,
walked and stole second base. He moved to third
when shortstop Troy Paulsen reached on an error
and scored on a ground ball by designated hitter
Tim Griffin.
In the second inning, Burnett rocked the house
with a towering home run over the scoreboard in
left center field.
It looked as if starter Stan Spencer was going to
1 cruise to a complete-game victory, but in the top
of the ninth, he was taken out after giving up two
runs Freshman Steve Worrell faced one batter but

could not put out the fire, surrendering a hit to
Lions' center fielder Tim Williams.
Finally Scott Weiss came in to the game and got
three quick outs to end the inning with the score
tied, 5-5.
Daryl Scott came in to pitch in the Cardinal half
of the ninth and loaded the bases before turning
to a deadly split-fingered fastball to retire two bat
ters. However, Scott's best weapon turned into his
worst enemy when, with the bases still loaded, he
threw a wild pitch in the dirt to Steve Solomon
and Griffin raced in to score the game-winning run.
The story of the second game could be told in
five words: Mike Mussina and Roger Burnett.
Mussina used an explosive fastball and mesmeriz
ing knuckle curve as well as an interesting changeup
that looked like a screwball to record a career-high
10 strikeouts between the second and seventh in
nings.
Burnett continued his wizardry at the plate in
game two, stroking a triple and two singles. For
the weekend, Burnett was 7-for-l'2 with five RBIs.
"It's nice to be able to contribute to the first
couple of wins," Burnett said Saturday "We all hit
the ball pretty well, it's all timing. We're back on
track now."
Burnett made a strong case for his earning a
permanent spot in the starting lineup, but Marquess
says he won't set a lineup for quite a while. "When
he (Burnett) swings the bat well, he's gonna keep
playing. I'd love to have a set lineup, but it's doubtful
because of all the freshmen."
Several Stanford fans brought brooms with them
yesterday in anticipation of a Cardinal sweep. They
were not disappointed.
The Lions jumped out to a 5-1 lead in the fifth
behind a three-run homer by LMU catcher Miah
Bradbury off Weiss, who relieved starter Brian
Keyser earlier in the inning.
But the Cardinal came roaring back in the bottom
of the sixth, scoring six runs. Stanford shortstop
Troy Paulsen went from goat to hero in that inning,
knocking a three-run home run of his own after
committing his sixth and seventh errors of the
season earlier in the game.
This weekend's three victories have given the
Cardinal a new outlook on life. "We're excited â€”
we can play with any team in the nation," Paulsen
commented.
Bring on victim number 501.
