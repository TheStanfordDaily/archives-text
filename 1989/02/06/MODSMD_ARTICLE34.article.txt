# Freshman Burnett powers Stanford over Loyola
## 
### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
Saturday, Cardinal freshman
Roger Burnett seized the moment.
He turned everyone's heads
with five hits, including a home
run and a triple, in Stanford's
doubleheader sweep of Loyola
Marymount.
Sunday, the infielder followed
that up by going 2-for-4 with an
RBI, his fourth of the year.
"We knew that he was a good
player in the fall. For a freshman,
he was polished, and normally
freshmen aren't," Senior Frank
Carey said. "He has really good

hands and a great arm. He's an
aggressive hitter."
Aggressive is the only way to
be for incoming freshmen in the
Cardinal baseball program. Every
day and every play is eyed with
the highest scrutiny.
"Everyone stepping in, even the
sophomores, is under pressure.
Everything you do is an attempt
to prove yourself. It's a lot of
pressure," Burnett said.
Burnett, a shortstop by trade,
has the added pressure of trying
to make it at third base, a position
that is new to him.
"I'm not comfortable yet," Bur
nett said. "With the brand new

glove I'm breaking in and a new
position, I'm not as comfortable
as 1 should be."
Burnett has also started a game
this year at another unfamiliar
position — designated hitter.
"I was DH in the first game
(of the season) and didn't get a
hit. Being DH is really tough. You
can't get into the game and into
the flow," Burnett said.
"If things work out (at third),
that's fine. It doesn't matter.
(Tim) Griffin has been playing ex
tremely well at third," he added.
Griftin. a junior, started at

third in the first three games of
the season. He was the team's
DH last year, which may bode
well for Burnett's future at third.
One thing is certain, if Burnett
continues to sting the baseball,
his future will simply be in the
starting lineup, somewhere.
"He's done a great job so far.
Ail the freshmen have a lot of
talent. For us to be successful,
they're going to have to help out,"

Carey said.
Carey and the other upperclass
men have already done their part
to help Burnett feel comfortable
in Cardinal red.
"It's not much fun when you
lose three straight, but the men
tality on this team is great," Bur
nett said. "There are guys who
have played on two national
championship teams. You follow
their example and everything goes
OK."
To Burnett and his fellow frosh,
it must seem that the two national
championship banners fly
ominously over their heads. But
Burnett claims to thrive on such

pressure.
"If you stay in the right frame
of mind, the pressure is kind of
fun. You have to deal with it as
best you can and turn it into a
positive situation," he said.
When you feel as comfortable
at the plate as Burnett did on
Saturday, every pitch looks like a
grapefruit.
"I was seeing the ball real well.
I got a fastball up and in (on the
homer). Usually I have been
laying off those high pitches," he
said.
In fact, Saturday was so good
for Burnett that Valentine's Day
came early. Freshman catcher
Troy Tallman's mother gave both
of them Valentine's Day brownies
after the game.
