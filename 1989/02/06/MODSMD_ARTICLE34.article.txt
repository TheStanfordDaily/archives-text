# Freshman Burnett powers Stanford over Loyola
## 
### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
Saturday, Cardinal freshman
Roger Burnett seized the moment.
He turned everyone's heads
with five hits, including a home
run and a triple, in Stanford's
doubleheader sweep of Loyola
Marymount.
Sunday, the infielder followed
that up by going 2-for-4 with an
RBI, his fourth of the year.
"We knew that he was a good
player in the fall. For a freshman,
he was polished, and normally
freshmen aren't," Senior Frank
Carey said. "He has really good

hands and a great arm. He's an
aggressive hitter."
Aggressive is the only way to
be for incoming freshmen in the
Cardinal baseball program. Every
day and every play is eyed with
the highest scrutiny.
"Everyone stepping in, even the
sophomores, is under pressure.
Everything you do is an attempt
to prove yourself. It's a lot of
pressure," Burnett said.
Burnett, a shortstop by trade,
has the added pressure of trying
to make it at third base, a position
that is new to him.
"I'm not comfortable yet," Bur
nett said. "With the brand new

glove I'm breaking in and a new
position, I'm not as comfortable
as 1 should be."
Burnett has also started a game
this year at another unfamiliar
position — designated hitter.
"I was DH in the first game
(of the season) and didn't get a
hit. Being DH is really tough. You
can't get into the game and into
the flow," Burnett said.
"If things work out (at third),
that's fine. It doesn't matter.
(Tim) Griffin has been playing ex
tremely well at third," he added.
