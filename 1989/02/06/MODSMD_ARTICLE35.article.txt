### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
In the educational sense, it was
a textbook weekend for the Stan
ford women's basketball team.
Mustering an 87-68jwin Friday
night against Arizona State in
spite of shoddy play, the No. 4
Cardinal learned from the previ
ous night's mistakes and pulled
itself together Saturday to blow
past Arizona 94-68.

Cardinal 94, Wildcats 68

The pair of victories increased
Stanford's win streak to 11 games
and kept alive the team's un
beaten home record for the
season. The Cardinal now enjoys
a 17-2 overall record and a 9-0
record in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, good for first in the league.
Judging solely by Friday night's
play, Stanford did not play like
the top team in the Pac-10, let
alone the No. 4 team in the na
tion. Though it is hard to criticize
a win, both the players and
coaches found themselves disap
pointed with the Cardinal's effort
after the game had been won.
"Pretty much, no one was really
happy with this game," forward
Trisha Stevens said. "It's hard to
get excited about it. I mean, we
won and that's great, but we
didn't do the right things at all."
Stanford Coach Tara VanDer
veer concurred. "My thing is, you
play against yourself. You chal
lenge yourself to give the best ef
fort no matter what the score is
and no matter who the opponent
is.
"I'd rather win and play bad
than lose and play bad, but we're
not building the right habits and
it's going to catch up with us.
That's what I'm concerned about:
When you win doing the wrong
thing, it reinforces the wrong
thing."
At the outset, things flowed
smoothly for the Cardinal. Center
Jill Yanke tipped the ball to guard
Jennifer Azzi, who raced to the
hoop for a layup after only six
seconds had elapsed. With 16
minutes left, Stanford had pulled
out to a 10-4 lead, and the 1,025
fans geared themselves for a
blowout.

It was not that easy, however.
Though the Cardinal never relin
quished its lead, uninspired de
fense allowed ASU to keep pace.
The half concluded with the score
49-41, far from blowout propor
tions.
The sole saving defensive grace
was shot blocking. Stanford tallied
an impressive seven blocks in the
first period en route to a school
record 13 by the final buzzer.
Where the team defense failed on
the floor, the post players com-
somewhat with their
score-saving swats.
"When you play help side, you
can get off your girl," explained
center Tammy Svoboda, who came
off the bench in the second half
to record four blocks in just eight
minutes. "And they happened to
be shorter than me, and I just
happened to time it well. I've got
to get the determination that
anybody that goes in the key,
they're not going to get the shot."
The Sun Devils did not exhibit
the same determination, affording
the Cardinal many scoring oppor
tunities. Stevens and Azzi capital
ized fairly well, notching 17 points
apiece, followed closely by forward
Katy Steding's 14 and guard
Sonja Henning's 13.
The numbers, like the game
score, are slightly deceptive. While
Stanford flourished statistically,
the team expected to fare better
against an ASU team that had
allowed an average of 80.4 points
in its last seven contests. For some
reason, the shots wouldn't fall.
Azzi in particular was plagued
with the missed-shot affliction.
Normally unconscious within 15
feet and almost automatic from
3-point range, the junior saw her
shots hit rim far two often.
"I was thinking a little too
much about when to shoot and
when to pass — instead of shoot
ing," Azzi said. "I feel like this is
the first game I haven't been in
a rhythm. Whether I'm missing
or not, I haven't been in the flow
of shooting.
"It just didn't feel right. The
shots I took were after I should
have taken them: I got the ball,
and I should have taken it right
away because I knew I was open.
I thought 'shot,' but at the same
time I was thinking 'pass.' I was
just thinking about it too much."
Azzi and her teammates, deter-

mined to rectify Friday's
shortcomings, came out ready to
play the following evening and ut
terly decimated the Wildcats.
Shooting a season-high 63.9 per
cent, the Cardinal cagers fostered
a Loyola Marymount-like scoring
frenzy and kept lighting up the
scoreboard with points.
Once again, Azzi came out on
top, shooting 7-for-ll to net 21
points in 33 minutes of action.
The total moved Azzi into ninth
place on the Stanford career
scoring list with 945 points.
Steding, who rates 10th in
career points, added 16 more on
Saturday. From the front court,
Julie Zeilstra notched 11, while
Evon Asforis grabbed a weekend
high 10 rebounds.
"I was just pleased with every
body — they came out and were
ready to play," VanDerveer said.
"They did what they were sup
posed to do, play good team bas
ketball, and I wouldn't be disap
pointed if we did it every night."
Card notes
Guard Martha Richards made the
best play of each game this weekend.
At the halftime buzzer on Friday, Ric
hards shot an over-the-shoulder hook
in traffic that banked in for the deuce.
The following night, Richards made
a rebound while rising from a fall
that ignited the crowd.
The "Warning of the Weekend
Award" goes to VanDerveer for cor
rectly predicting the Cardinal's turn
around against Arizona. Disgruntled
after the ASU game, the Cardinal
coach had a 15-minute postgame
meeting with her team that really
shook things up.
"I bet you right here and now that
we come out tomorrow night and blow
the Arizona team right off the floor,"
VanDerveer predicted Friday night.
"I'm just telling you ahead of time
to let you know, but I think we're
capable of coming out hard two nights
in a row."
That the Cardinal did.
