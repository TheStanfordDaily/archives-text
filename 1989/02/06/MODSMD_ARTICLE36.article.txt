Women's Swimming
Cardinal 95, Texas 45

With highs in the 20s and a
quarter-inch of ice covering every
thing, the Cardinal's flight was
delayed indefinitely. The weather
is so bad that the University of
Texas libraries were all closed yes
' terday and today's classes have
been cancelled.
But despite all that, there can
"be no question there are .several
Stanford swimmers after
»the team defeated the five-time
•defending national champions.
The meet also gave new Cardinal
I Coach Richard Quick a successful
J return to the school at which he
'coached the past six seasons. And
jit raised the Cardinal's record to
•'5-0 this season and may give Stan
ford the No. 1 ranking in the next
I poll.
s Texas, 6-2, fell to top-ranked
Florida 56-55 in Gainesville two
weeks ago. After the Lady Long
horns nearly beat the No. 1 Gators
;in Florida and then got killed at
{home by Stanford, the Cardinal
'may assume the No. 1 ranking.
» Stanford was led by Michelle
(Griglione Saturday night as the
/sophomore won three individual
i events. She beat Kristi Kiggans
'in the 200-yard butterfly (Kiggans
'was third in that event at last
Jyear's NCAA Championships),
.defeated Stacy Cassiday (the top
i point-scorer at the U.S. Open
Championships in December) by

.01 second in the 500 freestyle
and swam away from the field in
the 400 individual medley.
Another highlight was the fact
that three more Cardinal swim
mers qualified for the NCAA
Championships. Senior Susan
Lenth recorded qualifying times
in both the 100 and 200
breaststrokes, sophomore Jody
Smith qualified in the 500 free
style and sophomore Suzy Buck
ovich qualified in the 100 butter
fiy.
Stanford now has 13 swimmers
and four divers qualified for the
meet. The NCAA limits teams to
17 swimmers and three divers.
Stanford started the meet by
recording a qualifying time in
winning the 400 medley relay. The
Longhorns got on the board in
the next event, the 1650 freestyle,
which was won by Olympian
Andrea Hayes, but Stanford's
Barb Metz took second. Metz, who
set a personal record by 14
seconds in that event two weeks
ago, took six more seconds off her
best with a time of 16 minutes,

22.83 seconds.
Jenna Johnson then won the
200 freestyle for the Cardinal.
Dede Trimble, Susannah Miller
and Michelle Donahue swept the
100 backstroke, Jill Johnson,
Susan Johnson and Lenth swept
the 100 breaststroke and Stanford
never looked back.
Miller, Trimble and Donahue
swept the 200 backstroke for the
Cardinal, Jill Johnson, Lenth,
Susan Johnson and J.T. Toten
took four of the top five spots in
the 200 breaststroke and Jenna
Johnson, Buckovich and Jamie
Rugless swept the 100 butterfly
to add to the Cardinal domination.
In additon, junior diver Katie
Connors won both the one and
three-meter springboard competi
tions (she has nine firsts and one
second in ten events this season),
and Aimee Berzins took the 100
freestyle.
Should the Cardinal eventually
make it back to the Bay Area, the
team will finish its dual-meet
season at California Saturday.
