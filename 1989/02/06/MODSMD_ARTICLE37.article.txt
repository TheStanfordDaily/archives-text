# Men dominate in Desert State

How about a nice road trip
to Arizona? Few Cardinal teams
would rush to the airport when
asked such a question. But the
men's swim team had such a
good time beating Arizona, Ar
izona State and Nebraska, they
almost could have stayed there
for a few more days.
The swimmers heard Coach
Skip Kenney's theme of "effort"
for this meet and went out and
sailed past Arizona 63-50 on Fri
day. Stanford beat Arizona State

Cardinal gets three wins
in weekend meets

133-105 and Nebraska 135-102
the following day.
Junior Rick Gould had his
own victory against Arizona,
when he scored an NCAA qual
ifying time of 50.67 for the 100
yard backstroke.
"I'm really happy about it,"
Gould said. "I was surprised
that I could make the cut with
out resting."

Asst. Coach Ted Knapp
grinned when he talked about
the team morale these days.
"When every race had a great
Stanford performance, you get
caught up in that," Knapp said.
Don't be fooled by the official
score of 63-50 registered for Fri
day's Arizona meet, according
to Knapp. The Cardinal count
shows a landslide 82-31 final
score, but no one made a fuss
over a few points.
"We had thought they'd be a
little tougher," Knapp said.
