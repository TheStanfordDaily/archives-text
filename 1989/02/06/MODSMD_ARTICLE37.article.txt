# Men dominate in Desert State

### Elaine Riggs Staff writer 
How about a nice road trip
to Arizona? Few Cardinal teams
would rush to the airport when
asked such a question. But the
men's swim team had such a
good time beating Arizona, Ar
izona State and Nebraska, they
almost could have stayed there
for a few more days.
The swimmers heard Coach
Skip Kenney's theme of "effort"
for this meet and went out and
sailed past Arizona 63-50 on Fri
day. Stanford beat Arizona State

the following day.
Junior Rick Gould had his
own victory against Arizona,
when he scored an NCAA qual
ifying time of 50.67 for the 100
yard backstroke.
"I'm really happy about it,"
Gould said. "I was surprised
that I could make the cut with
out resting."

Asst. Coach Ted Knapp
grinned when he talked about
the team morale these days.
"When every race had a great
Stanford performance, you get
caught up in that," Knapp said.
Don't be fooled by the official
score of 63-50 registered for Fri
day's Arizona meet, according
to Knapp. The Cardinal count
shows a landslide 82-31 final
score, but no one made a fuss
over a few points.
"We had thought they'd be a
little tougher," Knapp said.
The Cardinal won all but two
events against the struggling
Wildcats on Friday, soon sub
stituting less experienced swim
mers for some events when they
realized that the meet would be
an easy win.
The swimmers faced more
serious competition on Saturday,
when some ASU freshmen turned
out to be faster than expected.
The thriller of the meet starred
co-captain John Witchel in the
200 freestyle. Witchel came from
behind to steal the event with a
time of 1:37.73, edging out ASU
swimmer Paul Howe's 1:37.78.
Diver Matt Frawley joined in
the team effort against Nebraska
on Saturday, scoring some of his
own personal bests.
Frawley split the Nebraska
divers so that they finished first
and third while the Cardinal
finished second and fourth.
"He broke into the national
limelight by splitting the Ne
braska divers," Knapp com
mented, adding that the solid per-

formance on the diving side added
to the overall positive team ex
perience.
"We're on a winning streak
right now," swimmer Alex Kostich
said, noting the team has won its
last five dual meets.
This week the second-ranked
Cardinal's theme will be "rest" to
prepare for challenging home
meets against USC and UCLA
this weekend.
"We're going to need to improve
to win," Knapp said, predicting
close meets.
And, of course, several swim
mers can't resist looking ahead to
the NCAA competition looming
four weeks ahead.
"We are so far ahead of where
we were last year at this time,"
Gould said. "To be able to perform
as well as we did, when we're as
tired as we are now, means we'll
swim a lot better at the NCAAs
at the end of the year."
