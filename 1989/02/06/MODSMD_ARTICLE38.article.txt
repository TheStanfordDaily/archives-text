## Shorthanded gymnasts beat SJSU 
### 
Competing without the services
of the country's fifth and ninth
ranked gymnasts, the Stanford
men's gymnastics team narrowly
defeated San Jose State Friday
night in San Jose.
U.S. National Team members
Tim Ryan and Conrad Voorsanger
were in Colorado Springs, Colo,
at the Olympic Training Center
"enjoying" the intensity of a four
day training session. Voorsanger
said the gymnasts worked out al
most seven hours per day as the
national coaches evaluated their
status in preparation for upcom
ing international competition.
Meanwhile, Voorsanger's team
mates bounced back from last
week's dismal showing at Santa
Barbara to score 264.5, edging the
Spartans by half a point and im
proving its record to 5-2. Senior
co-captain Andy Ropp said the
Cardinal definitely would have
scored at least 270 points had
Coach Sadao Hamada been able
to enter a full lineup.
"It was really close because
Conrad and Tim were both in
Colorado Springs and Scott
(Schaffer) and I are both injured,"
Ropp said. "On a lot of events we
only had five guys up — five guys
up, five guys count."
Nevertheless, Ropp thought
Stanford reacted well to last
week's disappointment. "It looked
like there was improvement over
last week," he said. "We saw what
we did last week and we're not
going to let that happen again."
Both Ropp and Hamada noted
sophomore Tim Wang's perform
ance as the Cardinal's best. Wang
scored especially well on the pom
mel horse, high bar and parallel
bars on his way to winning the
meet's all-around competition
with 54.75 points.
Hamada said that starting with
Stanford's next meet, on Feb. 18
at Santa Barbara, the team will
be competing with its best possi
ble lineup. "The San Jose meet

was the last one for us to look
around and see how things are,"
he said. "At the next competition,
we're going to go 100 percent."
Hamada repeated his analysis
of the team's potential which he
has maintained since the season's
outset. "There is no team in the
country that we can't beat if our
guys are healthy and we hit our
routines."
Schaffer returned to competi
tion Friday night, well ahead of
schedule in his recovery from torn
ankle ligaments. He turned in a
career best of 9.55 on the parallel
bars and recorded a 9.4 on the
vault to signal that his ankle
would soon be at full strength.

Women's gymnastics
falls to Fullerton State
With their highest score ever,
Fullerton State's women's gym
nastics team once again soared
over the Cardinal, 191.94-183.85,
on Saturday.
At their first home meet, Stan
ford women's gymnastics team
scored their seasons-best on both
vault, 45.80, and bars, 46.40 and
on the final team score, but still
met a tumbling defeat to Fuller
ton in every event.
"I was a little disappointed in
our performance," Stanford coach
Homer Sardina said. "We showed
a lot of nervousness out there,"
which had much to do with com
peting at home for the first time.
This year's team is "considerably
better" than last year's, Sardina
said, but the team needs to work
on performing with consistency.
Junior co-captain Dina
Amoroso, agreeing with Sardina,
said, "We really need to show in
our performance what we do in
our practices."
The team's freshmen were
needed to pull a lot of the weight
in Saturday's competition because

of minor injuries to Amoroso and
sophomore Jennifer Bloom, v/ho
usually compete in all four events.
"We had to look and see if the
youngsters on our team could and
would come through," Sardina
said. "And they did."
Sardina commended the
performances of several freshmen:
Shira Wohlberg with a 36.85 in
the all-around; Adriana Duffy
with a 9.5 on the vault, a season
best for the team; and Denise Vil
lars with a 9.35 on the balance
beam, another season-best for the
team.
Despite Villars' noteworthy bal
ance beam routine, the team's
overall performance on balance
beam suffered from inconsistent
routines for the second week in
a row.
"I think we let the adrenalin
flow a little bit too much," said
Villars.
"There were a lot of inconsis
tencies but there were a lot of
improvements individually,"
Amoroso said. "I think that will
show up in the upcoming meet,
against Oregon State next week".

Grapplers come up short
against Cal Poly-SLO
Could'ves and would'ves domi
nate the world of sports.
And, indeed, could'ves and
would'ves best explain the Cardi
nal wrestling team's 23-13 loss to
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo Friday.
Stanford could've triumphed
had it come out ahead in three
close matches in the 142 lbs., 150
lbs. and 158 lbs. divisions. Cardi
nal wrestlers would've won more
matches had the squad had more
time to rest after a long road trip
to Cal Poly. The squad could've
fared better had injuries not in
flicted their ranks.
As it stands, Stanford's dual
meet record will drop to 5-2, and

Cai Poly will have to wait two
years before getting a taste of Car
dinal vengeance.
Despite the loss, Stanford's
NCAA hopefuls Steve Yarbrough
(167 lbs.), Steve Buddie (177 lbs.)
and Ron Perry (190 lbs.) wrestled
up to expectations. Yarbrough
scored a technical fall over Cal
Poly's Jordon Robinson late in the
second round. Buddie followed
with a 14-5 major decision over
Gabe Cortina. Not to be outdone,
Perry destroyed Scott Galloway
16-3.

Stanford Coach Chris Horpel
also praised Josh Lisle (134 lbs.)
for an excellent meet despite
losing 5-3 to Robert Tabarez.
Tabarez finished second in the
Pacific 10 Conference tournament
last year.
"We could have easily beaten
them," Horpel said. "If we
wrestled them again, we would
have won at least two of the three
matches in 142 lbs., 150 lbs. and
158 lbs. divisions. It was one of
those things where we just didn't
win the matches we needed to

win." Horpel said.
Horpel cited inexperience as an
other factor contributing to the
team's loss. Matt Topham (158
lbs.), who was wrestling in his
first meet of the year, fell 8-3.
"It is really frustrating to come
up short when you know you are
capable of winning." Horpel said.
"Hopefully, we can take the frus
tration and use it to our advantage
in our next meet."

with 54.75 points.
Hamada said that starting with
Stanford's next meet, on Feb. 18
at Santa Barbara, the team will
be competing with its best possi
ble lineup. "The San Jose meet

was the last one for us to look
around and see how things are,"
he said. "At the next competition,
we're going to go 100 percent."
Hamada repeated his analysis
of the team's potential which he
has maintained since the season's
outset. "There is no team in the
country that we can't beat if our
guys are healthy and we hit our
routines."
Schaffer returned to competi
tion Friday night, well ahead of
schedule in his recovery from torn
ankle ligaments. He turned in a
career best of 9.55 on the parallel
bars and recorded a 9.4 on the
vault to signal that his ankle
would soon be at full strength.

Women's gymnastics
falls to Fullerton State
With their highest score ever,
Fullerton State's women's gym
nastics team once again soared
over the Cardinal, 191.94-183.85,
on Saturday.
At their first home meet, Stan
ford women's gymnastics team
scored their seasons-best on both
vault, 45.80, and bars, 46.40 and
on the final team score, but still
met a tumbling defeat to Fuller
ton in every event.
"I was a little disappointed in
our performance," Stanford coach
Homer Sardina said. "We showed
a lot of nervousness out there,"
which had much to do with com
peting at home for the first time.
This year's team is "considerably
better" than last year's, Sardina
said, but the team needs to work
on performing with consistency.
Junior co-captain Dina
Amoroso, agreeing with Sardina,
said, "We really need to show in
our performance what we do in
our practices."
The team's freshmen were
needed to pull a lot of the weight
in Saturday's competition because

of minor injuries to Amoroso and
sophomore Jennifer Bloom, v/ho
usually compete in all four events.
"We had to look and see if the
youngsters on our team could and
would come through," Sardina
said. "And they did."
Sardina commended the
performances of several freshmen:
Shira Wohlberg with a 36.85 in
the all-around; Adriana Duffy
with a 9.5 on the vault, a season
best for the team; and Denise Vil
lars with a 9.35 on the balance
beam, another season-best for the
team.
Despite Villars' noteworthy bal
ance beam routine, the team's
overall performance on balance
beam suffered from inconsistent
routines for the second week in
a row.
"I think we let the adrenalin
flow a little bit too much," said
Villars.
"There were a lot of inconsis
tencies but there were a lot of
improvements individually,"
Amoroso said. "I think that will
show up in the upcoming meet,
against Oregon State next week".

Grapplers come up short
against Cal Poly-SLO
Could'ves and would'ves domi
nate the world of sports.
And, indeed, could'ves and
would'ves best explain the Cardi
nal wrestling team's 23-13 loss to
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo Friday.
Stanford could've triumphed
had it come out ahead in three
close matches in the 142 lbs., 150
lbs. and 158 lbs. divisions. Cardi
nal wrestlers would've won more
matches had the squad had more
time to rest after a long road trip
to Cal Poly. The squad could've
fared better had injuries not in
flicted their ranks.
As it stands, Stanford's dual
meet record will drop to 5-2, and

Cai Poly will have to wait two
years before getting a taste of Car
dinal vengeance.
Despite the loss, Stanford's
NCAA hopefuls Steve Yarbrough
(167 lbs.), Steve Buddie (177 lbs.)
and Ron Perry (190 lbs.) wrestled
up to expectations. Yarbrough
scored a technical fall over Cal
Poly's Jordon Robinson late in the
second round. Buddie followed
with a 14-5 major decision over
Gabe Cortina. Not to be outdone,
Perry destroyed Scott Galloway
16-3.

Stanford Coach Chris Horpel
also praised Josh Lisle (134 lbs.)
for an excellent meet despite
losing 5-3 to Robert Tabarez.
Tabarez finished second in the
Pacific 10 Conference tournament
last year.
"We could have easily beaten
them," Horpel said. "If we
wrestled them again, we would
have won at least two of the three
matches in 142 lbs., 150 lbs. and
158 lbs. divisions. It was one of
those things where we just didn't
win the matches we needed to

win." Horpel said.
Horpel cited inexperience as an
other factor contributing to the
team's loss. Matt Topham (158
lbs.), who was wrestling in his
first meet of the year, fell 8-3.
"It is really frustrating to come
up short when you know you are
capable of winning." Horpel said.
"Hopefully, we can take the frus
tration and use it to our advantage
in our next meet."

James Rucker — Daily
Cardinal gymnast Sheri Evenson goes airborne during her floor routine. Evenson has been one of
the top all-around performers for Stanford this year.
Competing without the services
of the country's fifth and ninth
ranked gymnasts, the Stanford
men's gymnastics team narrowly
defeated San Jose State Friday
night in San Jose.
U.S. National Team members
Tim Ryan and Conrad Voorsanger
were in Colorado Springs, Colo,
at the Olympic Training Center
"enjoying" the intensity of a four
day training session. Voorsanger
said the gymnasts worked out al
most seven hours per day as the
national coaches evaluated their
status in preparation for upcom
ing international competition.
Meanwhile, Voorsanger's team
mates bounced back from last
week's dismal showing at Santa
Barbara to score 264.5, edging the
Spartans by half a point and im
proving its record to 5-2. Senior
co-captain Andy Ropp said the
Cardinal definitely would have
scored at least 270 points had
Coach Sadao Hamada been able
to enter a full lineup.
"It was really close because
Conrad and Tim were both in
Colorado Springs and Scott
(Schaffer) and I are both injured,"
Ropp said. "On a lot of events we
only had five guys up — five guys
up, five guys count."
Nevertheless, Ropp thought
Stanford reacted well to last
week's disappointment. "It looked
like there was improvement over
last week," he said. "We saw what
we did last week and we're not
going to let that happen again."
Both Ropp and Hamada noted
sophomore Tim Wang's perform
ance as the Cardinal's best. Wang
scored especially well on the pom
mel horse, high bar and parallel
bars on his way to winning the
meet's all-around competition
with 54.75 points.
Hamada said that starting with
Stanford's next meet, on Feb. 18
at Santa Barbara, the team will
be competing with its best possi
ble lineup. "The San Jose meet
