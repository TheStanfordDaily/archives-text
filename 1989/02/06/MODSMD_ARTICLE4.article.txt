# Checking the impact of the population boom

Rapid population growth and its
negative impact on the environment
are rapidly moving to the forefront of
the conservation agenda, surpassing
more traditional issues, according to
a panel of experts who spoke Thursday
night.
At the concluding event of the "You
Can Make a Difference" conference,
six experts discussed the effects pop
ulation growth will have on such en
vironmental problems as deforestation,
the declining number of species on the
earth and the greenhouse effect.
Stanford Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich
moderated the event, titled "Popula
tion, Resources, Enviroment: Making
the Connections" in Cubberley Audi
torium.

Beginning the discussion, Ehrlich
said the Earth's rapidly growing pop
ulation is pushing development to the
point where it will cause serious and
possibly irreversible damage to the en
vironment.
The Earth's human population is
currently 5.2 billion and is increasing
by 90 million per year, he said, ex
plaining that most of these people live
in small countries that are beginning
to industrialize. New industry will add
significantly to the global warming
process, he said.
Stephen Schneider, of the National
Center for Atmospheric Research, ex
plained that carbon dioxide and other
gases trap the sun's energy, causing
the greenhouse effect. He added that
carbon dioxide, the most prominent
greenhouse gas, is produced by burning

fossil fuels and by deforestation.
The Earth's temperature may in
crease between 3 and 9 degrees Fah
renheit in the next 100 to 200 years,
according to current predictions for
global warming range, Schneider said.
"There is no controversy over the
greenhouse effect. It is what keeps the
atmosphere warm. The controversy is
over the numbers," that is, the extent
of global warming, Schneider said.
Population growth also causes
deforestation, which, in turn, severly
damages the environment, said Peter
Raven, director of the Missouri Botani
cal Garden.
Deforestation is to blame for the
extinction of many species, especially
in the region of tropical rain forests,
he said, adding that the Earth is now

experiencing "the largest extinction pe
riod since that of the dinosaurs 65,000
years ago."
Although the panelists presented a
grim outlook, they did emphasize that
irreversible damage to the environ
ment can be prevented.
"There is an enormous potential for
change," Ehrlich said. He added that
"educating . . . and empowering
women is an important factor for
keeping population down."
John Holdren, professor of Energy
and Resources at UC-Berkeley, was
also guardedly optimistic. Because
Americans mainly react to crises, he
said that "We need a lot more educa
tion to make us aware of the (envi
ronmental) crises going on all the
time."
