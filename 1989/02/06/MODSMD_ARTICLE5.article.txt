# Res Ed reviews focus houses
## 
### Rob Burwell Staff writer 
By next fall Stanford could have as many as four
new focus houses, bringing the campus total to five
focus residences and 10 theme houses out of 76
total undergraduate residences.
The Office of Residential Affairs is currently
looking at proposals for an environmental awareness
focus house, a feminist or gender studies focus house,
an international focus house and a Judaic studies
focus house.
Focus and theme houses differ in the committ
ments expected of residents, according to Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Norm Robinson. Students
who live in theme houses must agree to fulfill a
particular obligation to live there, while focus houses
"just facilitate the living together of people inter
ested in an issue," Robinson said.
The only focus residence that currently exists is
the human biology focus house in Adams House.
At a preliminary meeting Feb. 2, Assoc. Dean of
Residential Affairs Alice Supton said she and other
officials in Residential Education had a "good dis
cussion about the merits of focus houses." She
added that proposals for each of the four houses
listed above were given an initial hearing.
Supton was noncommittal about the prospects of
each of the four houses, but said Residential Affairs
plans to make a decision in each case by Feb. 21.
Saying that she would prefer to locate focus houses
in upperclass residences, Supton stressed that
"nothing has been ruled out, but nothing has been
discussed" about which houses might become focus
residences.
"A decision will be made on the merits of [eachl
proposal before space is alloted," Supton said. "Until
we look at the proposals, I have no idea where the
proposed house would be best located."
Across the board, the student-written proposals
for each of the four houses have garnered broad
support.
Environmental awareness
Sophomore Ashley Lodato, one of the main sup
porters of an environmental awareness focus house,
said the house would "offer a program focusing on
different perspectives on the environment.
"We want to make the house an outdoor resource
center, offer seminars and lectures, encourage out
door activities and equipment rental," Lodato said.
The house could "add a general awareness of the
earth that many students don't get. It could high
light interest and focus attention on the environ
ment,' said Geology Dept. Chair Gordon Brown.
Brown is one of several faculty members support
ing the proposal. According to Lodato, the environ
mental awareness house has received support from
the Geology, Biology and Civil Engineering Depart
ments. Some in the Human Biology Program and
the Outdoor Education Program have also lent en
couragement.
Lodato added that she knows 35 students who
have committed to putting an environmental focus
house first on their Draw cards, and as many as
60 students who said they would put it somewhere
on their Draw cards. More than 300 people have
signed a petition backing the house, she said.
However, some have questioned the need for an
environmental focus house.
In a letter to The Daily, residents of Synergy
House wrote that "many of the co-ops, most notably
Synergy House, have been involved in environmental
issues for quite some time."
While supportive of the motives behind an envi
ronmental house, Synergy residents stressed that
communal living has much to teach about leading
"an environmentally sound lifestyle."
Lodato countered that an environmental house
