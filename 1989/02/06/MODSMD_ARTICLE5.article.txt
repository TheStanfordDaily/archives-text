# Res Ed reviews focus houses
## 
### Rob Burwell Staff writer 
By next fall Stanford could have as many as four
new focus houses, bringing the campus total to five
focus residences and 10 theme houses out of 76
total undergraduate residences.
The Office of Residential Affairs is currently
looking at proposals for an environmental awareness
focus house, a feminist or gender studies focus house,
an international focus house and a Judaic studies
focus house.
Focus and theme houses differ in the committ
ments expected of residents, according to Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Norm Robinson. Students
who live in theme houses must agree to fulfill a
particular obligation to live there, while focus houses
"just facilitate the living together of people inter
ested in an issue," Robinson said.
The only focus residence that currently exists is
the human biology focus house in Adams House.
At a preliminary meeting Feb. 2, Assoc. Dean of
Residential Affairs Alice Supton said she and other
officials in Residential Education had a "good dis
cussion about the merits of focus houses." She
added that proposals for each of the four houses
listed above were given an initial hearing.
Supton was noncommittal about the prospects of
each of the four houses, but said Residential Affairs
plans to make a decision in each case by Feb. 21.
Saying that she would prefer to locate focus houses
in upperclass residences, Supton stressed that
"nothing has been ruled out, but nothing has been
discussed" about which houses might become focus
residences.
"A decision will be made on the merits of [eachl
proposal before space is alloted," Supton said. "Until
we look at the proposals, I have no idea where the
proposed house would be best located."
Across the board, the student-written proposals
for each of the four houses have garnered broad
support.
Environmental awareness
Sophomore Ashley Lodato, one of the main sup
porters of an environmental awareness focus house,
said the house would "offer a program focusing on
different perspectives on the environment.
"We want to make the house an outdoor resource
center, offer seminars and lectures, encourage out
door activities and equipment rental," Lodato said.
The house could "add a general awareness of the
earth that many students don't get. It could high
light interest and focus attention on the environ
ment,' said Geology Dept. Chair Gordon Brown.
Brown is one of several faculty members support
ing the proposal. According to Lodato, the environ
mental awareness house has received support from
the Geology, Biology and Civil Engineering Depart
ments. Some in the Human Biology Program and
the Outdoor Education Program have also lent en
couragement.
Lodato added that she knows 35 students who
have committed to putting an environmental focus
house first on their Draw cards, and as many as
60 students who said they would put it somewhere
on their Draw cards. More than 300 people have
signed a petition backing the house, she said.
However, some have questioned the need for an
environmental focus house.
In a letter to The Daily, residents of Synergy
House wrote that "many of the co-ops, most notably
Synergy House, have been involved in environmental
issues for quite some time."
While supportive of the motives behind an envi
ronmental house, Synergy residents stressed that
communal living has much to teach about leading
"an environmentally sound lifestyle."
Lodato countered that an environmental house
and Synergy would attract differ
ent people. "We're trying to at
tract people who don't want to go
as far as Synergy, but want to
learn more about the enviion
ment."
Feminist or gender studies
Sarah Bryer, a co-terminal stu
dent in anthropology and co
author of the proposal, said the
movement to establish a feminist
or gender studies focus house has
generated "incredible student sup
port."
According to Bryer, about 50
students said they would put a
feminist studies house first on
their Draw cards; 100 said they
would put it somewhere on their
Draw cards; 200 said they would
"love to see the house on campus."
She added that the proposal has
received "amazing" faculty sup
port as well. Four professors said
they were interested in becoming
resident fellows there, six have
formally agreed to serve on the
advisory board to the house and
30 have offered general support,
she said.
"A feminist studies house would
complement both the Feminist
Studies Department and the
Women's Center without overlap
ping," Bryer said.
"Those who want to pursue the
intellectual field of feminist
studies in their houses are finding
that they can't. A feminist studies
house would allow that kind of
discussion on campus," Bryer

added. "As it stands now, there
is no continuous, ongoing forum
to discuss these (gender) issues."
Last month, Supton told The
Daily that a focus house must "ap
peal to a variety of students." Sup
ton added that feminist studies
fits that criterion right now be
cause it is "such an exciting area
right now."
The Program in Feminist
Studies has grown rapidly and
this year is providing 46 classes
through the program and 35
through other departments.
International
The student proposal for an in
ternational focus house would
divide the house into half inter
national students and half stu
dents who are interested in
international issues.
Supton, International Relations
Program Chair Barton Bernstein
and numerous RFs have already
expressed support for the propos
al, acording to freshman and
proponent of the house Lucia
Volk.
Volk said that at a recent RF
meeting, "there were different
voices and lots of support." Ac
cording to Volk, Bernstein "sup
ports the house, though he really
didn't get a chance to look into
the proposal."
In a survey of the international
freshmen, "a great many of them
at least came out in support of
such a house, even though some
wanted to be submerged into
American culture," said Haydee
Saffari, also a freshman and sup
porter of the house.
Saffari said the idea "is that we
would have an environment con

Department and
the Women's Cen
ter without over
lapping.'

ducive to talking about interna
tional things. With so many
backgrounds, it's easy to have
more impartial, more lively dis
cussions."
According to Saffari, the inter
national focus house would differ
from Hammarskjold House,
which is listed in the Stanford
residences guide as "the interna
tional co-op."
"Hammarskjold is small and
out of the way. It doesn't reach
out to the whole campus, and it
really doesn't have programs,"
she explained.
"We'd like to see the interna
tional focus house as part of a
larger dorm â€” like Casa Zapata
or Ujamaa," she said.
Judaic Studies
A Judaic studies focus house
has generated enthusiasm and
skepticism from Stanford's
Jewish community.
Junior Daniella Evans, who
supports the house, said it would
supplement Stanford's "budding

department in Judaic studies."
The house is intended to "empha
size Jewish history, culture and
language," rather than religion,
she said.
Evans said the proposal has re
ceived strong support from the
Program in Jewish Studies. The
faculty provided "the impetus be
hind the program (to establish a
house)."
"They are eager to see the pro--
gram go into effect," she said, "be
cause the resources of the
department are limited, and there
is a lot of burden to find support
for numerous (Judaic) programs."'
Evans said the house could take
much of this responsibility upon
itself.
However, senior Judith Eisen
berg, a former member of the Hil
lel council of presidents, said the
fact that the house would proba
bly not have a kosher kitchen has
caused concern.
Members of Stanford's Jewish
community won a long-standing
battle last year to convince Stan-"
ford to establish a kosher kitchen
on campus.
Eisenberg added that many
think "it is not a good idea ta
take Jews out of the dorms. Those*
who are left can become really
isolated, especially around the
holidays."
With fewer Jewish students in;
each dorm, it would be difficult
for those who remain to say that
a dorm-sponsored Christmas tree
bothered them, she said.
However, Evans said the house
would "probably be much less
than 50 percent Jews, and could
help promote greater understand
ing between Jews and non-Jews."
