# Communications prof. offers moral lessons to TV 'toons
## 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
He-Man, that daring, dashing
animated cartoon character, has
his sword pointed at the throat
of a dangerous dragon. But, at
the last moment, He-Man decides
to spare the dragon's life.
"Any life, even an evil one, is
worth saving," said Communica
tions Prof. Don Roberts, citing an
example of a moral lesson that
the television show He-Man offers
its viewers.
Roberts, who is also director of
Stanford's Institute for Commu
nications Research, was the edu
cational adviser for the TV car
toon show He-Man and shared his
experience as a consultant in a
speech given last Thursday night

at Larkin House.
According to Roberts, the show
was designed to be an "action
adventure" but the battles had to
be "diffused" in order to make it
a "pro-social show," offering
moral lessons that were specifi
cally stated at the end of the
episode.
Roberts showed an episode of
the cartoon and then discussed
what made He-Man such a hit.
The Adam-He-Man split of the
main character is like the Clark
Kent-Superman syndrome.
"This is every single boy (who
watches the show), a wimp. But
in the boy's heart, he knows there
will be a miraculous transforma
tion, said Roberts, noting that this
character-viewer identification is
the key to success.

"After eight to 10 weeks, the
ratings went up 13,000 percent,"
he said, explaining that the
original ratings were quite low.
Although the producers ex
pected an older audience, the gen
eral age of most viewers was four
or five years old. Consequently,
repetition was emphasized. "With
a young audience, (you) have to
keep saying things," Roberts said.
Roberts noted the importance
of stressing differences between
the cartoon and reality. The more
unrealistic the scenes, the less
likely it will be that children will
go out and attempt to imitate
what they see, he added.
As an example, Roberts cited

This change cost $120,000 be
cause production had already
begun. As a result, a new educa
tional review method was devised
in which Roberts would receive a
first draft of the script before
filming began. Within 24 hours
he would give the company a ver
bal evaluation of the script, and
shortly after, he would send them
his written recommendations for
revisions.
According to Roberts, his pri-

Mary concern was to "reduce
things that could cause children
to commit violence, get rid of
se:;ism in tne plots and add morals
to the stories."
Roberts said he wanted to
change the name He-man, but it
could not be done because the
name had been established before
the television show. He went on
to explain its origin, saying that
because Star Wars action adven
ture dolls had sold so well, Mattel
decided to produce He-Man dolls.
According to Roberts, these
were "the biggest selling dolls
with the exception of Barbie," and
because of their success, Mattel
decided to "get a TV tie-in." Mat
tel then contracted with Westing
house animation, each contribu
ting $2.5 million dollars.
