the start.
Tandem pioneered systems for on-line
transaction processing. Our systems proc

our customers the up-to-the-minute
information they need to succeed in com
petitive markets like finance, manufactur
ing, telecommunications, government
and retail.
Individual development is promoted
through a wide spectrum of resources
and rewards, like ongoing training, a
creativity awards program, perform
ance-based compensation plans, and a so
phisticated employee communications
system that includes video telecon
ferencing and worldwide electronic mail.
Right from the start, Tandem set out to
make an important difference —in prod
uct innovation, quality, price/per
formance, and customer satisfaction. At
