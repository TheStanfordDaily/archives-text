Stressing the need for contin
ued international coexistence, So
viet ambassador to the United
States Yuri Dubinin last night
kicked off a three-day seminar by
expressing the new Soviet view
that "policy should be based on
universal human interests" rather
than national and ideological con
cerns.
Dubinin and former chief U.S.
arms control negotiator Max
Kampelman, who worked under
both the Carter and Reagan ad
ministrations, spoke at the Stan
ford Park Hotel last night at the
invitational meeting of the Exec
utive Council on Foreign

Diplomats.
While a number of hurdles have
been crossed in Soviet-American
relations, Dubinin said there is
"no reason for complacency."
Noting that new Soviet foreign
policy attitudes are extensions of
the internal policies of glasnost
and perestroika, Dubinin said that
other countries must join the
Soviets with "a readiness to view
things different as not necessarily
things bad or hostile."
"Differences should be viewed
not as pretexts for confrontation,
but as a stimulus to exchanges,
interaction and cooperation,"
Dubinin concluded.
Kampelman echoed Dubinin's
push for international cooperation
rather than confrontation.
