# Bush unveils S&L bailout plan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Bush yesterday called on taxpayers to
pay for about half the $90 billion solu
tion to the savings and loan crisis, with
banks and thrift institutions paying the
rest.
He recommended no direct fee on in
dividual depositors.
"We intend to restore our entire in
sured deposit system to health," the
president told reporters in outlining a
series of regulatory changes. He vowed
to prosecute any wrongdoing at S&Ls
that have failed thus far.
"In all the time since creation of the
deposit insurance, savers have not lost
one dollar of insured deposits and I am
determined that they never will," Bush
added.
Under the Bush plan, which must be
approve by Congress, the government
would sell $50 billion in 30-year in
bonds as needed over three years to
finance the cost of closing or selling
about 350 failed institutions. That's in
addition to the $40 billion pledged last
year by regulators to rescue and prop
up 223 institutions.

Budget Director Richard Darman said
higher insurance premiums from the
savings and loan industry would pay
part of the interest on the bonds, but
that tax money would also be needed.
Taxpayer money would also be needed
to meet last year's commitments by
regulators, he said.
Darman estimated the cost to tax
payers at $1.9 billion in 1990, $28.1
billion during the first five years and
$39.9 billion over 10 years. Over the
30-year life of the plan, the public would
shoulder about 54 percent of the burden,
he said.
The banks and savings and loans
likely would try to pass on at least a
portion of their costs to consumers, pos
sibly in the form of lower interest rates
on savings accounts.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
said competition from money market
mutual funds and other investments
would prevent S&Ls from passing on
much of the cost of higher premiums.
He acknowledged that some banks and
S&Ls may get into trouble because of
that.

"There may be some (failures) but in
the long run we'll have a much sounder
system," he said.
To pay the principal on the
government-issued bonds, the govern
ment would take more than $2 billion
in retained earnings from the regional
Federal Home Loan Banks, which are
owned by the S&L industry. Money
from the sale of assets from failed S&Ls
will also be used toward the principal.
But Bush said, "I will not support
any new fee on depositors." He thus
rejected a proposal floated by his own
senior aides to charge depositors a fee
to help raise funds for the bailout, an
idea roundly criticized by members of
Congress.
Sen. Donald Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chair
man of the Senate Banking Committee,
said Bush's plan was "by and large a
sensible proposal," particularly its rec
ommendations for structural reforms.
But, he said the complicated bond
financing scheme may be more expen
sive than the simpler plan of issuing
the bonds directly through the Treas
ury.
