# Congress to vote on rejecting pay raise
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
speaker of the House, Jim Wright ,
caved in yesterday to opponents
of a 51 percent congressional pay
raise, conceding "the majority has
spoken" in demanding a vote that
will likely keep senators and rep
resentatives from getting any in
crease.
Wright set the vote for today.
The Senate was expected to
quickly give its assent and sent
legislation halting the raise, due
to take effect at 12:01 a.m. to
morrow, to President Bush. Sen
ate Republican leader Bob Dole
said he expects Bush to sign it.
The vote, Wright said, will be
on "a simple resolution of disap
proval" of the raises, which would
also affect federal judges and top
executive branch officials.
Wright had planned to let the
raise take effect tomorrow, then
have the Houee vote the next day
to scale it back to 30 percent.
Members of Congress would have
3een their annual salaries jump,
at least temporarily, from $89,500
to $135,000.
The speaker relented after op
ponents won a dramatic vote to
keep the issue alive on the House
floor. He said the chamber will
vote today and promised, "The
majority will rule."
The resolution would then go
to the Senate, which voted 95-5
Thursday for a differently worded
rejection measure.
That chamber's majority leader,
Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine,
said he "hopes and expects to
bring up whatever the House

sends over" and send it to the
president before the raise becomes
law, according to Mitchell aides.
Bush, at a late afternoon news
conference, was asked, "Would
you sign a bill that vetoes the pay
raise, not only for the members
of Congress, but also for federal
judges and other high officials in
the government?"
He answered, in an apparent
reference to the pay raise, "I said
I would support it."
But Mitchell's Republican coun
terpart, Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
told reporters:
"I understand he'll sign it. He
needs to do it by midnight so the
judiciary doesn't get a big step
while everybody else is being
stepped on."
The Constitution forbids raises
for judges from being reduced
once they take effect.
Wright's turnaround came after
pay raise opponents mustered a
238-88 majority against a House
Democratic leadership motion to
adjourn.
"The majority has spoken, and
the majority will speak emphati
cally," Wright said afterwords.
One leading opponent of the
raise, consumer advocate Ralph
Nader, said Wright's capitulation
showed he had realized "that the
power of the people is greater
than the power of his tyranny in
(trying to) close down the House
of Representatives until the mem
bers got their salary increase.' 1
The chairman of the House
Democratic Caucus, Rep. Bill
Gray, D-Pa., predicted there

would be "no pay raise, no
change" in the lawmakers' salary.
Gray also said he doubted the
House would move to ban speak
ing fees and other honoraria â€” a
plan favored by Wright in return
for the raise.
Gray said members feared a
vote to end yesterday's debate and
adjourn "was going to be inter
preted as a vote on the pay raise."
He said any vote to increase law
makers' salary now would fail.
Even "if it's a vote on 4 percent,
it ain't going to pass," Gray added.
"This pay raise is dead," said
Rep. Thomas Tauke, R-lowa, an

architect of the opposition strat
egy.
Tauke, however, said he expects
Congress to take up the issue lat
er, along wit-h a review of
honoraria, often paid to members
by special interests seeking to in
fluence legislation.
The vote and Wright's subse
quent announcement came after
Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-
Wash., presiding over yesterday's
session, refused to recognize a
pay-raise opponent who wanted to
introduce a resolution calling for
a vote on the hike.
