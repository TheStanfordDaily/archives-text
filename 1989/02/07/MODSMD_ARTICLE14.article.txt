# Polish talks begin
## Government may legalize Solidarity 
### 
WARSAW, Poland (AP) - The
government's top delegate to his
toric talks with the opposition
opened the first session yesterday
by offering to legalize Solidarity
if the union agrees to economic
and political reforms.
Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw
Kiszczak, seated opposite
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa,
called for the opposition to par
ticipate in Poland's government.
Fifty-seven delegates from the
government, the opposition and
the Roman Catholic Church gath
ered for the talks at the ornate
Council of Ministers Palace, the
building where the Warsaw Pact
was created.
The delegates met for about
three hours and issued a short
communique that said talks by
three "working groups" would
resume tomorrow. One group will
consider economic and social pol
icies, another political reforms
and the third the issue of allowing
more than one union to exist.
"We were brought together here
by the sense of responsibility for
the future of our motherland. We
are all responsible for the Poland
to be," Kiszczak told the partici
pants, the state-run news agency
PAP reported.
"We must accept the philosophy
of necessity alongside that of the
gradual character of transforma
tions," he said. "As it goes for
trade union pluralism, there is no
question if, but the point is how."
"We demand Solidarity. We have
the right to it," Walesa said in
his speech, PAP reported.
Walesa blamed Poland's eco

since the union was suppressed
by the martial-law crackdown in
December 1981.
"If we work out at the round
table a confirmed consensus on
the idea of non-confrontational
elections as well as support for
planned political and economic re
forms, there will be an immediate
possibility" to allow more than
one trade union to exist at a given
factory, Kiszczak said.
Kiszczak called for changes in
electoral laws and a new parlia-J
ment that would "represent a co
alition of forces."
Solidarity has expressed wilk
ingness to see the opposition enter
parliament. But it is reluctant to
endorse opposition participation
in a Cabinet that, despite reform;
is likely to be dominated by the
Communist Party.
Kiszczak, a member of the
ruling Politburo, said if Solidarity
were legalized, it "cannot return
to old ruts, becoming the source
of anarchy and tensions."
nomic and political crisis on a lack
of freedoms, but said he sensed
the government was ready for
change, state-run TV reported. â€¢
"We know the country is in
ruins. But it has not been ruined
by gnomes, but by the system of
carrying out power which has
been depriving people of their
rights and wasting the fruits of
their labor," Walesa said.
"The time of social and political
monopoly is ending. We need a
restructuring that will turn the
one-party state into a state of the
nation and the society," he said.
