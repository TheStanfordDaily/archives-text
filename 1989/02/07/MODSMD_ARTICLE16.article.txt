Israel claims FLO broke pledge
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel formally asked
the United States yesterday to stop talking to
the PLO, and top leaders began a campaign td
convince the U.S. administration that PLO chair
man Yasser Arafat broke a pledge to end terror
ism.
An Israeli diplomat delivered the request to
the State Department's Bureau of Near East
Affairs, sources in Washington said on condition
of anonymity.
Israeli leaders cited the case of five Palestinian
guerrillas killed Saturday night by Israeli soldiers
in south Lebanon, near the Israeli border. Israel's
embassy in Washington submitted information
"identifying details and additional facts linking
the PLO to that squad," Israel Television said.
State Department spokesman Charles Redman
said "we're looking into" whether the encounter
Saturday violated Arafat's renunciation of ter
rorism. Other officials said the United States
was seeking additional information.

In Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens
accused the Palestine Liberation Organization of
breaking a promise to refrain from terror and
gave the firefight as evidence.
Bush defends appointees' ethics
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush de
fended the ethical conduct of high-ranking offi
cials in his administration but said he might
have to tighten standards and make "our people
bend over backwards" so they avoid even the
appearance of conflict of interest.
Bush's statement came as C. Boyden Gray, his
longtime counsel and chief ethics adviser,
reversed an earlier decision and resigned as chair
man of a multimillion-dollar communications
company.
Last week, Dr. Louis Sullivan, the president's
nominee as secretary of health and human serv
ices, asked whether he could take a paid sabbati
cal leave from the Morehouse College School of
Medicine while serving in the Cabinet.
