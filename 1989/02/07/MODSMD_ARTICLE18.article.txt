Some fraternities need
to combat sexism, not
just alcohol problems

WHEN A FRATERNITY
advertised a party by in
cluding several drawings
of alcoholic drinks on a flier, a
University official called the flier
"alcohol-centered." What would
administrators say is the focus
of a fraternity party flier that
displays the acronym "NFC" —
commonly understood to mean
"no fat chicks"?
Clearly, the party will not cen
ter on developing an enlightened
relationship between the sexes.
In the wake of three public
incidents within the last two
weeks — two fliers advertising
fraternity parties and an event
in White Plaza where fraternity
pledges dressed up as Playboy
bunnies — the University has re
mained resoundingly silent.
These incidents demand atten
tion.
By their nature, fraternities
are at least susceptible to sexism,
since they exclude women from
their ranks. Therefore, they
should, at the very least, make
an extra effort to resist the ap
pearance of sexism.
But a fraternity that would in
clude "NFC" on a party adver
tisement is not even trying.
Such an attitude seems partic
ularly dangerous as Stanford be
comes increasingly aware of the
large number of women on
campus who suffer from eating
disorders.
Counseling and Psychological
Services estimates that 150 to

200 Stanford women a year suffer
from the frightening diseases of
bulimia and anorexia.
The University's silence on
these incidents is inconsistent
with their recently stepped-up ef
forts to combat racism and al
coholism at fraternities. Surely,
one half of the campus deserves
the effort.
Although the appearance of
"NFC" on a flier two weeks ago
may be the most overtly sexist
incident, the two other oc
curences warrant a second look.
Last week, one fraternity ad
vertised its party using a picture
of a woman in a bikini. At first
glance, this may seem harmless.
What's new about a scantily
dressed woman used to promote
' a product — in this case a party?
But this is exactly the problem.
There's no explanation for her
presence. Into what theme does
the woman in the bikini fit?
The male hosts of the party
offer a woman as a prize to their
male guests.
In a similar vein, one fraternity
had its pledges dress up as
Playboy bunnies, complete with
over-stuffed bikinis and bunny
ears.
This would seem to be the least
harmful of the three incidents —
just a practical joke. Yet why
should a fraternity choose to joke
about the objectification of
female beauty?
Stanford fraternities have re
cently demonstrated that they
can come together with the Uni
versity to solve a problem — in
this case alcohol. Unfortunately,
some Stanford fraternities have
also demonstrated that they have
a long way to go in combatting
sexism.
