# Group attacks sexist acts
## 
### Janine De Fao Staff writer 
Spurred by a recent fraternity flier
depicting a bikini-clad woman and the
masquerading of fraternity pledges as
Playboy bunnies, a group operating out
of the Women's Center will soon call
for Residential Education and the In
terfraternity Council to define their
policy on public displays of sexism.
Next week, Students Against Sexism
will submit a letter asking if either the
University or the IFC has a policy con
cerning "any overt displays of sexism
or objectification of women's bodies,"
group member Terri Hopper told The
Daily yesterday.
The group, which formed this fall, is
now attempting to gain support from
other student organizations before send
ing the letter.
If no such policy exists the group
would like to work with Res Ed and
the IFC to establish one, according to
Sarah Bryer, the coordinator of the
Women's Center and a member of the

group.
IFC President Chris Erlin said that
there is no explicit IFC policy concern
ing sexism and what can be printed on
a flier, but added that fliers should abide
by the Fundamental Standard, and fra
ternities should consider how people will
be affected by their advertisements.
Group member Ann Marie Bender
noted that Students Against Sexism is
not targeting fraternities in their move
ment to address sexism.
"Fraternities are not the only groups
on campus that distribute sexist fliers.
There are also dorms that do it," Bender
said.
However, the two incidents of greatest
concern to the group were the recent
posting of an Alpha Epsilon Pi Frater
nity party flier depicting a woman in a
bikini and the distribution of party in
vitations by Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fra
ternity pledges dressed as Playboy
bunnies, said Bender.
Erlin said he will meet with Alpha
Epsilon Pi president Mike Fox and other
members of the fraternity today to

analyze the purpose of their flier and
discuss its implications.
"I think it's important that the role
of the IFC is not as a censor, but as a
body to raise awareness and help fra
ternities see other people's perspec
tives," Erlin added.
According to Fox, his fraternity had
hoped to run a picture of Christie
Brinkley to compliment their Billy Joel
"Only the Good Die Young" theme but
could not find one. "There is not much
you can do on this campus without
evoking some reaction," Fox added. "I
didn't think people would get upset
about it. I saw nothing wrong with it."
Students Against Sexism is not asking
that disciplinary action be taken against
either fraternity, but that such incidents
should be prevented in the future, she
added.
The group, which counts both women
and men as members, wa3 founded in
response to Phi Delta Theta Fraterni
ty's request that the Women's Center
put on a program about feminism and
sexism at their house.
