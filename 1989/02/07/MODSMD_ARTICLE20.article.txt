"One ever feels twoness, — an Ameri

America, for America has too much to

not bleach his negro soul in a flood of
white Americanism, for he knows that
Negro blood has a message for the world.

"The Souls of Black Folks"
AS I READ the Ujamaa factual
report and the reasons the two
students gave for posting the
defaced picture of Beethoven, I began to
realize that these two gentlemen were
harboring a misconception concerning
how minorities would like to be perceived.
One of the two, "Fred," suggested that
the key was looking at minorities as being
the same as non-minorities. This is not
the case. Though I am only one black
person with one opinion, I believe I can
speak for many other blacks and minor
ities as well, when I say that the key is
not in viewing all minorities as whites,
but in realizing that minorities are dif
ferent from whites and respecting that
cultural difference.
All ethnic groups have a culture that
is special and unique to them, something
that cannot be taken from them. All that
is needed is for everyone to respect the

different cultures rather than to view
them as something weird or absurd.
This is one of the things the Students
of Color Coalition is fighting for — rather
than "creating further racial separation
on campus," as Burke Smith would have
us believe.
The "demand" that Ujamaa House be
allowed to house more than 50 percent
black students is a recognition of the fact
that there are students in Ujamaa who
do not wish to live there, as well as
students who wished to live there but
were unable to because they were black.
Those who are interested in the theme
of unity and wish to contribute to it
should be allowed to do so.
Dußois speaks of a "double
consciousness" that minorities feel in this
country — they are Americans, but also
have ancestry in another country with
another culture. By substituting different
minority groups and ancestral lands
where Dußois says "Negro" and "Africa,"
one sees that this can be applied to all
ethnic groups.
For example, I am a black American:
an American, rich in the American cul
ture. However, I also have African roots.
Though I do not live in Africa and do
not have an extensive knowledge of
African culture, it is still a part of my
heritage. No one has the right to take
that away from me.
What I would ask is that I be respected
as an American, a black American, just
as respect is given to white Americans.
My culture and heritage are what make
me unique, but not inferior or alien.
By promoting assimilation, as "Fred"

implied we should do, one promotes same
ness, which means that all minorities
should deny their backgrounds and adopt
the mtyority culture.
This is simply another type of oppres
sion, which promotes inherent inequality.
The key to eradicating racism is not
viewing everyone as the same, but real
izing that different ethnic groups have
different cultures which make them
unique and respecting those cultures.
If we concentrate on respecting one
another and our diversity, we will be able
to rid ourselves of the inequity instituted
by our Founding Fathers.
The basis of the disease of racism in
America is lack of respect and under
standing of different cultures.
We need to treat the disease instead
of the symptoms.
"Herein the longing of black people
must have respect: the rich and bitter
depth of their experience, the unknown
treasures of their inner life, the strange
rending of nature they have seen, may
give the world new points of view and
make their loving, living, and doing pre
cious to all human hearts."

not have an extensive knowledge of
African culture, it is still a part of my
heritage. No one has the right to take
that away from me.
What I would ask is that I be respected
as an American, a black American, just
as respect is given to white Americans.
My culture and heritage are what make
me unique, but not inferior or alien.
By promoting assimilation, as "Fred"

implied we should do, one promotes same
ness, which means that all minorities
should deny their backgrounds and adopt
the mtyority culture.
This is simply another type of oppres
sion, which promotes inherent inequality.
The key to eradicating racism is not
viewing everyone as the same, but real
izing that different ethnic groups have
different cultures which make them
unique and respecting those cultures.
If we concentrate on respecting one
another and our diversity, we will be able
to rid ourselves of the inequity instituted
by our Founding Fathers.
The basis of the disease of racism in
America is lack of respect and under
standing of different cultures.
We need to treat the disease instead
of the symptoms.
"Herein the longing of black people
must have respect: the rich and bitter
depth of their experience, the unknown
treasures of their inner life, the strange
rending of nature they have seen, may
give the world new points of view and
make their loving, living, and doing pre
cious to all human hearts."
