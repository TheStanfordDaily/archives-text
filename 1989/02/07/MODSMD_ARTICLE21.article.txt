## Backlash at Ujamaa not justified, but anger was 
### 
IN HIS Jan. 27 letter, Gil Blank
criticizes the suppression of infor
mation about the "backlash"
against white students following the
Ujamaa incident. In principle I agree
that the acts were reprehensible and
that we should have been told about
them. Indeed, they should be discussed
for they are a part of the problem of
inequality in our society.
However, I do not agree with
Blank's belief that "it is up to the
Office of Residential Education,
Ujamaa and the Black Student Union
as well to treat these secondary offen
ses with just as much attention as the
initial ones."
A subtle, but very important differ
ence distinguishes the initial and sec

ondary incidences. The acts of the
"backlash" were fueled by anger. It is
understandable that the unknown
aggressors were so indignant. For
regardless of their intentions, the two
freshmen responsible for the act had
hurt the secondary aggressors very
deeply, as they must have hurt all
black people who saw the poster.
They echoed the messages that
people of color receive all their lives in
our society: that they are not entirely
human, or at least inferior. The mes
sage of the flier was degrading and
oppressive of its recipients. In contrast,
although violent and hateful, the sec
ondary incidences were directed at
equals.
Because of their respective races, the

two freshmen had more power over
their victims than the perpetrators of
the secondary incidences had over
theirs. One cannot neglect this differ
ence in power that is a part of the
structure of our society when discuss
ing equality. Blank seems to think that
in order to achieve a democratic and
egalitarian society, our laws and insti
tutions must treat everyone exactly the
same.
However, this "color-blindness"
ignores the great difficulties that our
still racist and discriminatory society
puts people of color through. It as
sumes our society has already achieved
equality. Unfortunately, we have not.
Until we have, we cannot view equality
in such absolute terms.

Moreover, one must understand that
this "backlash" is not an independent
problem to be addressed alone. It is a
result of and, therefore, inseparable
from racism.
Acts and feelings of minority racism
will diminish with the decline of acts
and feelings of majority racism.
Why should the BSU risk hindering
their goal of absolute equality by
giving these secondary incidences the
same amount of attention as the initial
ones when continuing their current
course would rid us of them as well as
racism itself?
