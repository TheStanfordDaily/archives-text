# Columnist is wrong to say ethnic dorms segregate students
## 
### 
Burke Smith's Feb. 3 column enti
tled "Diversity, not separation," con
tains so many distortions it would be
unfair to let him go unanswered.
Smith begins by challenging both the
Students of Color Coalition and ethnic
theme dorms, saying they "splinter the
housing system along ethnic and racial
lines." In saying this, he grossly mis
construes the purpose of theme houses.
They are not, in philosophy or in fact,
"oases" for minority students. They are
for the study of a minority American
culture and are open to any student
who wants to share in and develop an
understanding for a particular group's
contributions to our society.
The coalition probably regards this
interest in the cultural theme more
important than skin color, and thus

wants to remove the 50 percent non
black requirement for Ujamaa House.
Smith's prediction that Ujamaa will
become a "black oasis" is profoundly
ignorant and could be interpreted as a
racial slur. At the very least it is an
insult to every student who has ever
lived in or wanted to live in an ethnic
theme house.
In next drawing a parallel between
Haiti and Ujamaa, Smith unfairly im
plies that students who live in ethnic
theme dorms are segregationists who
"create tensions by isolating their ra
cial group within carefully guarded
boundaries."
First, theme houses do not house
"racial groups." They house all kinds
of people who are interested in minor
ity American cultures. Secondly, theme
dorms do not have "carefully guarded
boundaries," physical or social.
Finally, Okada, Ujamaa and Zapata
residents are hardly segregationists.
They work and study on campus like
any other student, participate in many
student organizations and engage in
relationships with people outside of

their dorm. To say their goal is "eth
nic purity" is completely ludicrous and
very telling of the way Smith seems to
stereotype ethnic theme house resi
dents.
Furthermore, an article dealing with
a subject as sensitive as race and eth
nicity presupposes of its author a cer
tain knowledge of terms. We cannot
use "assimilation," for example, when
we mean "integration." Assimliation
implies the elimination of diversity,
while integration suggests celebration
of diversity.
Given the number of times "assimila
tion" came up in the article, I can
then only conclude that Smith would
have all minorities assimilate rather
than work for the integration of cul
tures.
As an Asian-American I resent being
asked to disappear quietly into the
dominant culture. And I resent the
way he tried to lend credence to his
argument by misrepresenting Frederick
Douglass as "a prominent 19th century
black ... assimilationist." Douglass was
no more an assimilationist than he

was a segregationist. He was an
abolitionist and an ex-slave who by no
means aspired to 19th century white
values and behaviors.
As a minority student who has lived
only in non-theme dorms, I've never
found "interact(ing) at the social and
residential level" to be a problem. The
problem is generating awareness of the
Asian-American aspects of my identity.
Smith's claim that "a population
spread uniformly throughout the resi
dence system . . . learns to live to
gether" may be true, but it doesn't tell
the whole story.
Too often, ethnic minorities feel a
need to downplay their ethnicity, and
be appreciated for their similarities,
not their differences.
We all want to "break down barriers
within American society." And we all
"hope that appreciation for each other
will result." But let's not be naive in
our methods, and let's stop blaming
students of color for showing us the
conditions we would rather not see.
