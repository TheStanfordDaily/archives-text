## A
						firsthand understanding Classes give view of disabled life 
### Amy Rosenfeld Editorial staff 
Imagine not being able to visit a friend on the
second floor. Imagine not being able to read this
story.
For people with disabilities, such situations are
not just imagination; they are reality.
Two different classes offered by the Psychology
Department help students understand the difficul
ties the disabled face every day.
Besides attending weekly seminars, students in
Psychology 185: "Experience-based Study on the
Meaning of Being Handicapped," are required to do
volunteer work at the Community Association for
the Retarded in Palo Alto and complete a special
project.
Past projects have included visits to rehabilitation
centers and a study of wheelchair accessibility on
campus.
To truly understand the experience firsthand,
some students spend a day acting as though they
were disabled.
According to Betty Wright, a resource specialist
at the community association and organizer of the
class, such a simulation is the best way to see what
it means to be disabled.
"You want to really know how it is, get on crutches
and go to the cafeteria; get in a wheelchair for a
day; blindfold yourself for a day and don't cheat,"
she says.
Sophomore Susan Berry spent an afternoon in a
wheelchair as part of a project for Psychology 177:
"Social Psychology of Physical Deviance and Dis
ability." Berry and a partner took turns maneuver

ing around the Stanford Shopping Center in the
wheelchair.
The afternoon was an "eye-opening experience to
see everything the [disabled] have to go through,"
Berry says. She recalls difficulties moving down
aisles, using the bathrooms and reaching goods
placed on high shelves.
"And that was just shopping," she says. "Imagine
if I'd had to go to a restaurant or a movie or take
a shower."
Although people were generally friendly, Berry
says she thinks some may have treated her differ
ently if she were not in the wheelchair. When Berry
asked one saleswoman for directions, the sales
woman directed her response to Berry's partner,
who was walking at the time, Berry says.
While such exercises give students a firsthand
view, working with the disabled provides a different
perspective. Students in Psychology 185 volunteer
three hours per week in one of eight of the Com
munity Association for the Retarded programs.
The association provides services for individuals
of all ages who are "developmentally disabled," ac
cording to assistant program director Calvin Her
rick.
Some students, such as junior Jason Banfield,
choose to volunteer at the association's swimmming
center in Palo Alto. "I have learned more from
[people at the pool] than I could ever teach them
about swimming," Banfield says.
The class offers a "new perspective on abilities
we have and how lucky we are," Banfield says.
According to Wright, this perspective is one all
students should have. "I wish I'd had it when I was
[that] age," she says.
