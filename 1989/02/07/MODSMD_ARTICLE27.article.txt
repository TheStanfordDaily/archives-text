# Marshall: Students do care
## 
### Jim Hsu 
Upon entering Hubert Mar
shall's office, the sunny view of
the Oval is immediately
obscured by the huge mound of
papers sitting on his desk, span
ning years and years of
academia. Even the walls are
hidden by an impressive layer
of books.
But Marshall, a thoughtful
scholar with quizzical glasses
and brushed silver hair, steals
the scene. Most students know
him as the professor of Political
Science 1, which has consistently
ranked among the most popular
and highly-recommended
classes on campus for more than
two decades.
"Oddly enough," Marshall
says, "as an undergraduate I
was a biology major and thought
that I wanted to be either a
forester or some kind of
botanist."
He remembers how being a
lab instructor as an undergrad

uate at Antioch College in Ohio
sparked his interest in teaching
for the first time.
"I guess I didn't articulate it
to myself, but I think within
three weeks or a month I just
knew I was going to be a
teacher," he says.
Marshall takes a strong
stance on American education,
arguing for more government

PROF-ile

responsibility, especially in
inner-city high schools.
"We've got to reach those kids
and say, 'If you're willing to
make the choice, then we're now
really going to help you, and we
won't abandon you the next
time there's a little recession.' "
Marshall is honest yet firmly
optimistic about the Stanford
student body and the state of
student activism.
"There are no Mother There

sa's around here, OK? Just none
— but the number of students
who want to lead useful lives is
significant," he says.
"I see a sort of underlying
commitment to lives that are
sort of usefully devoted to some
thing other than just self
advancement or power or
whatever, but it doesn't get
manifested anymore in radical
student movements."
However, Marshall says, any
thing is possible.
"Our students are just the
same as the students who were
here in the late 1960s or early
19705. Had I Reagan] had his
own way, he would have sent
the Marines into Nicaragua to
clean out the Sandinistas.
"But he couldn't do it, politi
cally, because the same students
that are so quiescent here, after
30 or 40 thousand dead Marines
and a draft, would be up in
arms, and we'd be trashing and
wrecking the college all over
again."

Political Science Prof. Hubert Marshall is dwarfed by the huge mound of papers which obscures
his desk and his view of the Oval.
