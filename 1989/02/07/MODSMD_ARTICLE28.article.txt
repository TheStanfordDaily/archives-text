## Netters meet Irvine in season opener 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Getting right down to business, the defending
national champion Stanford men's tennis team
begins its title defense today at home against UC-
Irvine. Opening with the Anteaters doesn't exactly
constitute "easing into" a season: Irvine is ranked
fifth in the preseason Volvo/Intercollegiate Tennis
Coaches Association poll and already has four
matches under its belt, compared to none for the
No. 2 Cardinal.
"That [match experience] will be an advantage
for them, there's no question," Stanford Asst. Coach
John Whitlinger said. "We'll just have to deal with
that."
Irvine's match against No. 10 California Sunday
would seem to indicate that the Cardinal shouldn't
have much trouble "dealing" with the Anteaters.
Irvine, now 2-2 on the season, was mauled 7-2 by
the Bears, who swept all six singles matches. Rather
than bolster the Cardinal's confidence, however, the
trouncing has the team wary.
"That [the match's outcome] is scary," Whitlinger
said. "We knew Cal was good, but they may be even
better than we thought.
The Anteaters are led by Trevor Kroneman,
ranked 25th in the country, who played No. 1 singles
in the three matches before Sunday, when he played
No. 3. Along with Mark Kaplan and Mike Briggs,
Kroneman leads a squad which returns everyone
from last year's NCAA-quarterfinal team. The
team's other 1989 loss was a tough 6-3 decision
against preseason No. 1 UCLA two weeks ago.
"It's going to be a hard match to start with,"
Whitlinger said. "If we can get by this match, it's
really going to tell a lot about our team.
"Of course, since we're the national champs, that's
a little added incentive for them."
