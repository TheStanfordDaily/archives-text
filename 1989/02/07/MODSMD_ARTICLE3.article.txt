# Unhoused fraternities on the rise

### DJ Berinstein Staff writer 
With membership rates in unhoused
fraternities steadily rising, group mem
bers say they see themselves as an in
creasingly popular option within the
fraternal system.
The number of members in unhoused
fraternities is now almost half the num
ber of members living in fraternities â€”
about 220 people are in unhoused fra
ternities, whereas the number of mem
bers in housed fraternities tallies 520.
Last spring, only about 120 people were
members of unhoused fraternities.
Last spring, a Sigma Nu Fraternity
chapter was re-established at Stanford
that currently has 33 members. An Al
pha Epsilon Pi Fraternity chapter also
popped up on campus last spring that
currently has 17 members. Other un
housed fraternities include Sigma Phi
Epsilon, Sigma Alpha Mu and Phi
Kappa Psi.

Eleven prospective Phi Kappa Theta
Fraternity members are meeting today
with Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano to petition for the opening of a
chapter at Stanford.
The number of fraternity members
overall represents over 20 percent of the
male population at Stanford.
Men join fraternities for many
reasons, but the recent upsurge in un
housed fraternity membership is due in
part to the fact that they are unhoused,
according to members both in the ad
ministration and in the fraternities.
"The nature of the Stanford student
body is a highly mobile one," Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons explained.
"Housed fraternities limit the choices;
the all-male environment creates a large
deterrent. The student must ask him
self, 'am I giving up choices?' "
Echoing Lyons' theory, Sammie pres
ident Johnathan Schwartz said, "I
wanted to be in a dorm and part of a
fraternity at Stanford so I could have

both social outlets."
According to Lyons, another factor
explaining the popularity of unhoused
fraternities is that housed fraternities
have a "reputation as drinking clubs."
Pisano also speculated as to why so
many unhoused fraternities seem to be
springing up. "Lots of people want the
benefits of membership without having
to join a residential group," he said,
"and there is a market for the starting
of new groups which have no history
attached to them."
One of the founders of Alpha Epsilon
Pi, Rob Weiss, said he joined because
his father is a member and he had
friends at other universities who are
members. "There is something benefi
cial about starting a new organization
and being a part of something new,"
he said.
According to Sig Ep member Todd
Ortega, it is the people in each individ-
