# Unhoused fraternities on the rise
## 
### DJ Berinstein Staff writer 
With membership rates in unhoused
fraternities steadily rising, group mem
bers say they see themselves as an in
creasingly popular option within the
fraternal system.
The number of members in unhoused
fraternities is now almost half the num
ber of members living in fraternities —
about 220 people are in unhoused fra
ternities, whereas the number of mem
bers in housed fraternities tallies 520.
Last spring, only about 120 people were
members of unhoused fraternities.
Last spring, a Sigma Nu Fraternity
chapter was re-established at Stanford
that currently has 33 members. An Al
pha Epsilon Pi Fraternity chapter also
popped up on campus last spring that
currently has 17 members. Other un
housed fraternities include Sigma Phi
Epsilon, Sigma Alpha Mu and Phi
Kappa Psi.

Eleven prospective Phi Kappa Theta
Fraternity members are meeting today
with Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano to petition for the opening of a
chapter at Stanford.
The number of fraternity members
overall represents over 20 percent of the
male population at Stanford.
Men join fraternities for many
reasons, but the recent upsurge in un
housed fraternity membership is due in
part to the fact that they are unhoused,
according to members both in the ad
ministration and in the fraternities.
"The nature of the Stanford student
body is a highly mobile one," Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons explained.
"Housed fraternities limit the choices;
the all-male environment creates a large
deterrent. The student must ask him
self, 'am I giving up choices?' "
Echoing Lyons' theory, Sammie pres
ident Johnathan Schwartz said, "I
wanted to be in a dorm and part of a
fraternity at Stanford so I could have

both social outlets."
According to Lyons, another factor
explaining the popularity of unhoused
fraternities is that housed fraternities
have a "reputation as drinking clubs."
Pisano also speculated as to why so
many unhoused fraternities seem to be
springing up. "Lots of people want the
benefits of membership without having
to join a residential group," he said,
"and there is a market for the starting
of new groups which have no history
attached to them."
One of the founders of Alpha Epsilon
Pi, Rob Weiss, said he joined because
his father is a member and he had
friends at other universities who are
members. "There is something benefi
cial about starting a new organization
and being a part of something new,"
he said.
According to Sig Ep member Todd
Ortega, it is the people in each individ-
ual group that attract new mem
bers. "My [resident assistant] was
an unhoused fraternity member,
so in a way, unhoused fraternities
have an edge since their members
are living with potential new
members."
Schwartz also said he joined
Sammies because "of the guys in
the group." He added that he was
surprised about the increasing
number of new fraternities be
cause "I thought the campus
seemed more anti-Greek, but it is
encouraging to see new ones pop
ping up."
Although the unhoused option
is attractive to some, the Sigma
Nus and the Sig Eps are discuss
ing possibilities for attaining a
house in the near future —
preferably on campus.
Saying that there is "zero
chance" that any fraternity cur
rently unhoused will be be
queathed a house on campus,
Lyons cited a recommendation
from the fraternal task force
issued in Jan. 1988 putting a
freeze on housing petitions for fra
ternities.
The housing freeze is scheduled
to end this year, Ortega said.
However, the report states that
the freeze "will continue in effect

until a firm University policy is
established."
Lyons said he "sees the trend
[in 20 years] toward mostly un
housed fraternities. The times
have changed, and the world has
changed its opinion about frater
nities."
"Housed fraternities need to do
some self-assessment," Pisano
said. "The trend will be a still
strong fraternity system, but one
that will include non-residential
fraternities. It all depends on
what the housed fraternities will
do," he said.
Citing the benefits of having a
house, Sigma Nu member Preston
Hammer said "there is a lot more
brotherhood fostered in a (physi
cal) house." The Sigma Nu chap
ter at Stanford was one of the
first fraternities on campus.
Members have been discussing the
possibility of regaining their
original house, now Synergy
House, but are also looking into
off-campus residences.
The Sig Eps are also seriously
interested in acquiring a house,
and have even looked into taking
over the Alpha Delta Phi Frater
nity house.
The Sammies, Phi Psis and Al
pha Epsilon Pi have also discussed
but are not actively seeking
housing at Stanford. The Phi Psis
have decided that they want to
remain unhoused.
Members of housed fraternities

said they were in support of their
unhoused brothers. "If all the
other fraternities are eventually
phased out, it would be great to
give those guys a chance," said
IFC representative Mike
Colglazier, a member of the Sigma
Chi Fraternity. "Unfortunately,
it's a one-way thing; fraternities

can go out, but they can't come
»»
on.
Former Alpha Delt president
Eric Gai said he does not see un
housed fraternities as a threat to
the housed ones. "There is no
direct competition," he said, "be
cause no new fraternal groups will
ever be housed at Stanford."

The fraternal system began in 1891 with seven housed fraternities
on campus. By 1924, 24 housed fraternities existed and remained
until 1967. While membership rates for unhoused fraternities is on
the rise, the number of housed fraternities have steadily decreased.
