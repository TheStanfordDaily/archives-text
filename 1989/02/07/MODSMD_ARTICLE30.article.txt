# NCAA champs hope for yet another title
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
The last time the Stanford
men's tennis team entered a
season as the defending national
champions, the team went 13-10
(their worst record in 20 years)
and wasn't even invited to the
1987 NCAA Championship Tour
nament.
Don't bet your tuition that his
tory will repeat itself, however.
In fact, with three players
ranked in the top 20 in the nation
and two more who can play on a
level with the best in the country,
look for the Cardinal to be right
in the thick of the race when this
year's tournament, to be held in
Athens, Ga. in May, rolls around.
Stanford, which begins its title
defense today at Stanford Tennis
Stadium against No. 5 Irvine (see
related story), is ranked No. 2
(along with Georgia) in the Vol
vo/Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches'
Association poll, behind preseason
title-favorite UCLA. The Cardinal
returns all but two members of
a squad that rolled to a 25-1
record last year en route to cap
turing the school's fifth NCAA
team title of the decade.
Unfortunately, the two players
lost are Ail-Americans Patrick
McEnroe and David Wheaton.
Stanford will have to answer
several questions raised by their
departure, most notably about its
doubles play, before thinking of
taking the title again.
"Do we deserve to be No. 2?"
Stanford Asst. Coach John Whit
linger asked. "I think it's gener
ous, but down the road, as the
guys improve, hopefully it'll be

one spot better.
"I think potentially we are that
good. . . . Early in the season,
we'll have to see. I think we could
be the best team," Whitlinger con
tinued. "UCLA is tremendous.
They have every right to be
preseason No. 1, but we're not
that far behind."
Of course, the only rankings
that matter are the ones used to
determine the seeding at the
championships in May, so the Car
dinal really couldn't care less
about polls taken in February.
"All we want to do is get into the
show again, which we didn't do
in 1987," Whitlinger said. "That's
our main goal."
With the strong corps of players
returning, only a fool would bet
against the team making it to at
least the opening round at Athens.
Leading the way is two-time Ail-
American Jeff Tarango, who is
No. 2 in the Volvo singles poll.
Tarango, who spent his summer
playing on the professional tour
and finished 1988 ranked 96th in
the world, has played the No. 1
singles position for the Cardinal
the iast two years, and the junior
co-captain will no doubt see most
of his action in that spot again
this season.
"Tarango obviously has a great
deal of talent," Whitlinger said.
"His summer showed us what he
can do."
Tarango may feel some heat
from sophomore Martin Black
man, who has had "a great month
of practice, probably the best prac
tice and play that he's had," ac
cording to Whitlinger. Even

ranked player, spearheads Stanford's title defense that begins today against UC-lrvine.
though he is not ranked in the
top 25 (yet), Blackman may be
poised to make a move up.
"(Blackman) has had his prob
lems with playing well one match
and not playing well the next,"
Whitlinger said. "He may have
broken through that. If he has,
he's going to be unbelievable."
The fact that Blackman and
teammate Jeff Cathrall are not
ranked is just one indication of
the relative unimportance of
preseason polls. "There are two
players [Blackman and Cathrall]
who are not ranked on our team,

both of whom I think potentially
could win the NCAAs," Whit
linger said.
Joining Tarango, Blackman and
Cathrall in the scramble for start
ing singles berths will be senior
co-captain Curtis Dunn, currently
ranked 10th in the country. Dunn,
who has won the Rolex Regional
Indoor Qualifying Tournament
the last two years, did not play
much for the team in dual-match
play last year, but is expected to
contribute in 1989.
Alex O'Brien, the only fresh
man on the squad, will see con
siderable playing time as well.
Ranked No. 17, O'Brien will prob
ably play in the No. 4 to No. 6
spots.
The major issue the team will

have to address this season, how
ever, is not the singles lineup, but
the doubles tandems. "When you
lose two players like we did . . .
what it really hurt was the dou
bles, with David and Jeff playing
together and Patrick and Martin
playing together," Whitlinger
said. "We lost two doubles teams
right there."
As for defending the NCAA
title, which no team has done suc
cessfully since the Stanford teams
of 1980-81, Whitlinger said "I
don't think there's any extra pres
sure. Our guys have been there
before, and they know what's ex
pected of them.
"We'll just try to get there [the
NCAAs], and then see how we do."
