# AP top-20s: 'Associated Press' rankings or 'absurd polls'?
## 
### 
The Associated Press poll should be
used for everything.
To quickly update you on the
latest with the AP, the Pac-10's own
Arizona has risen three spots to become
the fourth No. 1 team in the nation in
the last four weeks.
Basically, if you lose while you're the
Np. 1 team, you're not No. 1. If you lose
while you're No. 2, you can still be No.
1 as long as you win when No. 1 loses.
If you're No. 4 , you can move up three
spots to one if three, two and one lose.
The lesson from this is that life is
deliberately nonsensical and understand
able only to Dick Vitale.
The implicit philosophy that governs
the AP poll is that the No. 1 team being
chosen is the team that is No. 1 this
particular week, not the team expected
to be No. 1 at season's end. Just because
Arizona is number one this week does

not imply that the voters think it will
win the NCAA championship.
For example, part of Arizona's rise to
the top was its victory over Stanford Jan.
29. Arizona also lost to Stanford once,
on Jan. 5. Without changing the results
of those games, if you just switched the
dates, the same Arizona team would not

be the No. 1 team anymore. Like the
character on Saturday Night Live, the
AP is Mr. Short-term Memory.
But don't get me wrong. I think the
polls are great. In fact, I'm calling for a
much wider implementation of the AP
poll.
A nice little corollary to Andy War
hol's everyone's-famous-for-15-
minutes theory would result if the
AP took polls on everyday events. Every
one would have a chance to be No. 1 for
a week.
For instance, you take schoolwork. Say
you're like a lot of us over here at Storke
Publications Building and you're not ex
actly up for Phi Beta Kappa honors.
But then you really work hard on that
French assignment, looking up every
word you have to translate in the dic
tionary, actually learning the subjunctive.

You take that test. You're well
prepared. Maybe, if you're a Kentucky
or Oklahoma fan, you cheat — you look
at someone else's paper, or bring in some
crib notes.
Don't worry. The AP won't know
you've cheated for a couple of years. All
the AP will see is that teat score of 99
reported — a season-high 99, as they
say. Your classmate, who has been at the
head of the class forever, slumps to a 98
on this exam.
Go fetch that Valedictorian's cap out
of your closet. You're the new No. 1
student.
The AP poll. It's easy, and it's fun.
The poll also would work in other
arenas. Under the current system,
Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis suffered a blow to his
chances of becoming the nation's 41st

president by losing the November 1988
election. Most analysts agree it's really
going to be tough for Dukakis to come
back and reach the presidency this term.
But if AP determined the presidency,
each week there would be a re-evaluation
to see who the best person for the job
is. The pressure would be constant on
the leader, much as it is now for Arizona.
See if George Bush would suggest taxing
deposits at savings and loans if he knew
the new AP poll could pick a new No. 1
politician the next week.
As for Stanford, if Arizona can main
tain its hot streak for the rest of the
season, the Cardinal will probably have
another shot at "No. 1 for a day" status
at the Pac-10 tournament next month.
But Arizona plays Oklahoma Sunday.
If the Wildcats lose, look for either
Georgetown or Jesse Jackson to take over
the No. 1 ranking in America.
