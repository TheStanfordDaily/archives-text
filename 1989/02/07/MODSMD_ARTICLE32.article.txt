# Redshirts wait for their turn

### Andrew Wilcox 
Behind the scenes of Stanford's No. 18-ranked
basketball team, several team members are con
centrating on continuing this success in upcoming
years. Redshirt players Lang Meyer, Kenny Am
mann, Peter Dukes, and Paul Garrett are little
known members of the Cardinal squad who will
never step on the court during a game this year.
Redshirting involves spending a season to gain
strength, maturity, and an understanding of a
college athletic system with an eye to the future.
The NCAA does not consider the redshirt season
one of the athlete's four years of eligibility for
competition.
Redshirts are regular team members in every
aspect aside from playing in games. They practice
with the team, sit on the bench during games,
and accompany the team on some road trips.
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery considers
redshirting an important tool and stresses the
benefits of an extra year. "Maturity is a
factor, especially with big players. . . . Redshirting
gives a chance to adjust from being the main
guy in high school to the Division I level [of
competition!."
Dukes, a redshirt freshman, said, "Redshirting
gives me a year to go through everything in the
program without having to worry about getting
nervous before games. The biggest reason I'm
doing it is to get bigger, stronger, and quicker,
which I need to do."
Ammann, a transfer junior who played at Santa
Ana College last year after playing his freshman
year at Cal State-Bakersfield, noted that red
shirting is helping him adjust to Stanford's pro
gram after the jump from the junior college ranks.
Being out of the limelight gives him a "different
view of the game," Ammann said.
Redshirting also provides academic advantages
for scholar athletes. Montgomery emphasized that
an extra year is an important vehicle for many
players to fulfill their academic as well as athletic
potential. Ammann added that sitting out this
year will give him the opportunity to pursue
coterminal studies in his final year.
An additional motive to sit this year out for
the redshirts is the slim prospect of playing time
on the deep and talent-laden Cardinal squad.
Montgomery added that in order to get the max
imum performance out of the recruits "We try
to spread [recruiting] classes out so that there
aren't too many [redshirts] in the same class
eligibility-wise."

The decision of whether or not to redshirt is
ultimately left up to the player, Montgomery
said. He emphasized that redshirting only pays
off if the player wants to put in the hard work
inherent in redshirting. In many cases, the red
shirt option is offered during the recruiting proc
ess. Ammann, Garrett and Meyer all said they
knew coming in that they would redshirt a year.
Meyer, a sophomore, had planned on redshirt
ing last year but postponed the option until this
season because he was needed as a result of Eric
Reveno's season-ending back injury. Reveno, in
turn, redshirted last season.
In retrospect, Reveno said having redshirted
benefits him now because he is a year older."lt
sounds simple, but a year makes a big difference
maturity-wise," Reveno explained. He also praised
this year's group of redshirts saying that their
hard work helps the team and will help the
redshirts individually in the future.
Although one might expect that redshirting
was not used in past years when Stanford was
not so stocked with talent, Montgomery said he
has often used the redshirt program in the past.
In addition to Reveno, current players Derek
Bruton, Scott Meinert, and Deshon Wingate all
sat out a year.
Although redshirts do not directly influence
the outcome of games, their hard work in practice
helps the top-line players prepare for games.
Before each contest, the redshirts serve as a scout
team, learning the upcoming opponents' offensive
and defensive plays and then running these sets
during practice against the first team.
As part of the scout team, Garrett said he
"became" UCLA star Don McClean during prac
tice before the Cardinal's game against the
Bruins.
"We don't expect them to emulate the talent
of other teams but we do expect them to run
their sets," Montgomery said.
Reveno added, "Doing scout team [sets] helps
you realize what a team effort it is. When the
redshirts work hard and do well in practice it
really helps the team."
After working with the regulars, the redshirts
will often practice fundamentals on the side under
the tutelage of Assistant Coach Tom Crowley
while the team scrimmages. Garrett and Meyer
spend time perfecting post moves while Ammann
and Dukes stress guard skills such as shooting,
dribbling, foot movement, and quickness drills
with a toss-back ball machine.
Dukes said that although work
ing on fundamentals gets
monotonous at times, he recon
ciles the tedium with the realiza
tion that "working on little things
will help me in the future."
The redshirts agreed that play
ing in practice against starters
will also pay future benefits. "I
won't guard anyone better than
Todd Lichti next year and I learn
a lot going against him," Ammann
said.
Dukes added, "Guarding Lichti
and playing against players from
a top-20 team in practice makes
me a better player."
The frustration of not being

able to play once the ball goes up
is shared by all the redshirts.
Meyer said, "You wish you could
play, but you just have to be a
cheerleader on the bench. I feel
the same emotions and get into
the games as much as the regular
players.... I'm nervous during
games even though I'm not play
ing."
These players are also integra
ted into Division I basketball by
accompanying the team on non
conference road trips. (The Pac-10
allows only 12 players to travel
to conference road games; the
NCAA allows 15 to go to non
conference games.) Meyer said
traveling to basketball hot beds
like Indiana and North Carolina
is valuable because it shows the
redshirts what to expect when
playing against similar big-time
programs in the future.

"Huge opposing crowds won't
be such a shock next year," Am
man noted.
In spite of the hard work, long
hours, and lack of a concrete
reward — like playing time —
associated with redshirting,
staying motivated is not a
problem. Garrett, who missed his
senior season of high school due
to injury and is a year young for
his class, pointed out that red
shirting is essential for him. "I
came here thinking I would red
shirt and I definitely need the
extra year to mature."
Meyer concurred, saying that,
like most redshirts, he too needs
the time to develop. "I know its
best for me and I know my time
will come. I just try to keep the
attitude that redshirting is the
best thing for my career."
