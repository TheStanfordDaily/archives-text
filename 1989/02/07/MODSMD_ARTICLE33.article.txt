# Women's tennis faces Santa Clara
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
The one thing certain about
today's women's tennis match
against Santa Clara is that there's
going to be a full house at the
Stanford Tennis Stadium.
Not necessarily in the stands,
mind you, where mediocre
weather and the middle-of-the
workday start time may keep the
crowds away, but on the court.
The reason is that the Broncos
were originally slated to come on
Feb. 9. But with so many of the
Stanford players heading for the
Thursday's opening round of the
Rolex National Invitational in
Minneapolis, Minn., the match
had to be moved up. It just so
happens that the men's team also
has a home match today, so the
teams will be playing at the same
time and will therefore be using
all available courts at the stadium.
There is also a great degree of
certainty about the outcome of
the contest: another Stanford vic
tory. The Broncos are "not a great
team" according to Cardinal

Coach Frank Brennan.
"We'll use this match to hope
fully break in a couple of players
who haven't had much chance to
play," Brennan said.

Eleni Rossides, who returned
triumphantly from the latest of
her ailments with a win against
Utah last week, will miss tomor
row's match.


Teri Whitlinger and her Cardinal teammates will attempt to keep
their perfect record intacnt as they host Santa Clara at the "new'*
Stanford Tennis Stadium today.
