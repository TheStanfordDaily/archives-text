# Grapplers try to break 20-year Bulldog jinx

### Greg Gottesman Staff writer 
Stanford's wrestling team will try to play David
tonight as it prepares to square off against a Goliath
named Fresno State at 7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
This will be Stanford's second-to-last home meet.
The 5-2 Cardinal has not beaten the Bulldogs in
over 20 years. The losing streak, however, has not
dampened Coach Chris Horpel's spirits. "On paper

they are favored due to our past record against
them. But, once you're out there on the mats, it's
hard to predict how people will match up. We
definitely have a shot."
Stanford's squad will consist of Dave Nowick (118
lbs.), Mark Forman (126 lbs.), Josh Lisle (134 lbs.),
James Dinette (142 lbs.), Geoff Baum (150 lbs.),
Matt Topham (158 lbs.), Steve Yarbrough (167 lbs.),
Steve Buddie (177 lbs.), Ron Perry (190 lbs.) and
Trent Smith (heavyweight).
