## 
### Doug Boeschen Staff writer 
The din of clashing blades and
screaming duelists once again
filled Roble Gym and, once again,
the shouts of victory belonged to
the Stanford fencers. The first
ever Pacific 10 Conference Invi
tational ended Saturday in
decisive victories for both the Car
dinal men's and women's teams
as the men took the title in all
three weapon categories and the
women won 47 out of a possible
48 bouts.

Competing against USC,
UCLA, Arizona State, and Cali
fornia the Stanford fencers proved
that they are the top team in the
Pac-10 and will be the team to
beat in the upcoming Western Re
gional Championships.
Heading into Saturday's tour
nament, the heavily favored Stan
ford fencers were looking forward
to checking out their conference
competition. "It was good to
rotate in fencers who don't usually
get much chance to compete —
they got good experience," said
team manager Jim Farrell.

Men's Coach Zoran Tulum saw
the tournament as an important
step forward for fencing on the
West Coast. As Stanford is the
only varsity fencing team in the
Pac-10, Tulum hopes that tour
naments of this type will give the
other club teams experience and
exposure which will eventually
lead to a generation of more var
sity teams.
Unfortunately, because of
travel expenses, some other Pac
-10 club teams were unable to at
tend the tournament. Tulum
hopes more teams will participate
in next year's tournament to be
held at UCLA.
The Cardinal domination in the
tournament was complete and
awesome as they took every title
available — including the team
championship — and were able to
retain the "Perpetual Trophy" (a
mounted sword that has become
the prized possession of Coach
Tulum).
The men's sabre team was
devastating as they rolled to a
25-2 record and the men's epee
and foil squads ran up nearly as
impressive records on their way
to the tournament titles in these
events. The women were invin
cible against the opposing less
experienced club teams as they
compiled their nearly spotless
record.
