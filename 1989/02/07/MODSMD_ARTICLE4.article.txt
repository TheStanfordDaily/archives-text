# Suspect in hit-and-run case to undergo psychiatric evaluation
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
A Santa Clara County Municipal Court
judge has ordered a psychiatric evaluation
of the suspect in last week's fatal hit
and-run collision on Palm Drive.
Geoffrey Henderson, 19, of Palo Alto,
was arraigned last Friday on charges of
vehicular manslaughter and hit-and-run
with bodily injury. At the arraignment,
Judge Stephen Manley referred Hender
son to Santa Clara County's Mental
Health-Criminal Justice Program for a
72-hour evaluation.
According to John Guheen, Hender
son's attorney, Manley was concerned
about the defendant's current psycholog
ical and emotional state.

However, Deputy District Attorney
Cynthia Savely contended that Manley
"viewed him as a danger to himself and
others," because of his psychological his
tory, which included visiting a psychia
trist who wanted Henderson committed
to an institution. Guheen had no com
ment on that aspect of the case.
Though Henderson was also arrested
for driving under the influence of alcohol
as reported in The Daily last Friday, that
charge was not brought against him at
the arraignment. Ralph Anderson of the
California Highway Patrol's public affairs
office said he speculated that the charge
was dropped because the district attorney
had no evidence to go on.
According to police, Henderson's car
crossed two lanes of traffic on Arboretum

Road and a patch of grass before crashing
broadside into a car on Palm last Wed
nesday. William Duffey, 57, of Menlo
Park, was killed in the collision.
Savely said on the day of the collision
that Henderson's mother called Palo Alto
police saying that her son had driven
away in her car and "she wanted him
stopped."
A few minutes later, the mother called
back and canceled her request. A few
minutes after that, the collision occurred,
according to Savely.
Henderson was examined at Valley
Medical Center following his arrest.
Savely said Henderson's mother told a
police officer that her son had been seeing
a psychiatrist who wanted him to be com
mitted to an institution. The mother said

The suspect visited a psy
chiatrist who wanted to
institutionalize him.

she had not wanted him to be committed,
Savely said.
Savely did not explain what Hender
son's psychiatric problems were.
Henderson is still being held at the
county jail in San Jose, according to
Guheen, a member of Monaco, Anderlini
and Finkelstein, a Redwood City law
firm.
A spokeswoman for the county criminal
division clerk's office in Palo Alto said

Henderson was put under evaluation "for
the way he was acting in the courtroom,
(by) interrupting proceedings."
Guheen said he "wouldn't agree with
that characterization."
Henderson is scheduled to return to
court tomorrow, when the results of the
pscyhiatric evaluation will be presented,
along with police reports that were not
ready at Friday's arraignment. Savely
said she expects Henderson to plead not
guilty and the judge to order him to be
released to a hospital.
Also at the arraignment, Manley raised
Henderson's bail from $100,000 to
$500,000, and Guheen said the judge
would probably reconsider the case and
the bail amount at tomorrow's hearing
based on the results of the evaluation.
