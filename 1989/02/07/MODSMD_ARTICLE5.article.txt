# Center reflects pride of disabled

Five years ago, when the Disability Resource Cen
ter had just opened on the Stanford campus, stu
dents did not want to be seen in the center, says
founder Jim Bouquin. Framing their outlook may
have been a stigma often attached to having a dis
ability, Bouquin says.
But things have changed. "In the last five or 10
years there has been a tremendous movement toward
the treatment of people with handicaps as individual
people with individual problems," points out fresh
man John Miller, a blind student who works at the
center.
Bouquin attributes this change to a few factors.
One is "sheer numbers" â€” more and more students
with disabilities are attending Stanford each year.
Their increased presence and visibility on campus
encourages greater acceptance and dissolves the op
pressive stigma previously tainting the lives of the
disabled, he says.
Another reason for the changing attitude, Bou
quin says, is that students today have grown up
watching the progress of the 1970s disabled rights
legislation.
The disabled rights movement has followed a
course similar to the black civil rights movement,
but the disabled rights movement is about a decade
behind, Bouquin adds.
"Hopefully this generation has grown up much
less afraid of students with disabilities," he says.
"There's a greater sense of self' in disabled stu
dents, according to Bouquin. Their disabilities are
just a facet of their lives, he says, but no longer a
facet to hide.
As a result of this change, the Disability Resource
Center is no longer a place to duck in and out of
quickly. According to many of those who use the
center, its cheerful and low-key atmosphere makes
it a haven where students find the support they need.
