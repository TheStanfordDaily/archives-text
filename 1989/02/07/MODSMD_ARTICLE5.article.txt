# Center reflects pride of disabled

Five years ago, when the Disability Resource Cen
ter had just opened on the Stanford campus, stu
dents did not want to be seen in the center, says
founder Jim Bouquin. Framing their outlook may
have been a stigma often attached to having a dis
ability, Bouquin says.
But things have changed. "In the last five or 10
years there has been a tremendous movement toward
the treatment of people with handicaps as individual
people with individual problems," points out fresh
man John Miller, a blind student who works at the
center.
Bouquin attributes this change to a few factors.
One is "sheer numbers" â€” more and more students
with disabilities are attending Stanford each year.
Their increased presence and visibility on campus
encourages greater acceptance and dissolves the op
pressive stigma previously tainting the lives of the
disabled, he says.
Another reason for the changing attitude, Bou
quin says, is that students today have grown up
watching the progress of the 1970s disabled rights
legislation.
The disabled rights movement has followed a
course similar to the black civil rights movement,
but the disabled rights movement is about a decade
behind, Bouquin adds.
"Hopefully this generation has grown up much
less afraid of students with disabilities," he says.
"There's a greater sense of self' in disabled stu
dents, according to Bouquin. Their disabilities are
just a facet of their lives, he says, but no longer a
facet to hide.
As a result of this change, the Disability Resource
Center is no longer a place to duck in and out of
quickly. According to many of those who use the
center, its cheerful and low-key atmosphere makes
it a haven where students find the support they need.
The center's primary concern
is providing for the academic
needs of individuals. The re
sources offered by the center in
clude a notetaking service for
those who have vision or hearing
problems and a reading service
which transfers books to
audiotape. In addition, they pro
vide low-vision equipment and
aids for the blind.
Miller says the resources avail
able at Stanford significantly in
fluenced his college choice.
According to Miller, the reading
services in particular are superior

to those of the other schools he
considered.
The Disability Resource Center
caters to the individual and indi
vidual needs, notes Miller. The
center accomodates those who
simply require the technical serv
ices but also provides support
groups and a network of friends
for those who want more than
just technical aid.
Molly Sandperl, the services co
ordinator for the center, says she
is interested in creating optional
peer group programs which will
offer additional support. The cen
ter is currently organizing a men
tor program in which freshmen
can be paired with older students
with similar disabilities.

When students with disabilities
arrive at Stanford, at first they
may feel uncomfortable interact
ing with other students with dis
abilities, according to Jeff Lucas,
a sophomore who works at the
center. Some may see a mirror
image of themselves in others who
are disabled, he says, and don't
want to be reminded of their dis
ability.
However, Lucas says he feels
that students who use the center
"have a lot to learn from each
other."
The center reflects a growing
pride on the part of the students
who use its resources. These stu
dents have a lot of battles to fight,
Sandperl says,"and they're fight
ing them damn well."
