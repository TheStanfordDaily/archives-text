# Ambassadors arrive for campus seminar
## 
### Diane Bisgeier Staff writer 
The movers and shakers of in
ternational relations are invading
campus this week for a three-day
seminar that will give 30 ambas
sadors a chance to study interna
tional issues away from the rigor
of day-to-day diplomacy.
An entourage of 30 diplomats,
including Soviet ambassador to
the United States Yuri Dubinin
and former U.S. Secretary of
State George Shultz, will take
part in a series of panels, lectures
and informal discussions "in a so
cial and recreational setting, " ac
cording to Ronald Herring, public
programs director for the Univer
sity's Institute for International
Studies. The three-day event will

give the diplomats a chance to
"learn more about one another in
a more personal way," Herring
said.
This is the second consecutive
year Stanford has helped host the
diplomats. This year's program
titled "Economics and National
Security: the Future of U.S.-
Soviet Relations," is organized by
the Executive Council of Foreign
Diplomats, the University's Col
ter for International Security and
Arms Control and the Center for
Russian and East European
Studies. The council is a private
organization which, Herring said,
"contracts with the government
to bring diplomatic corps to
gether."


Jim Roberts — Daily
Soviet Ambassador to the United States Yuri Dubinin speaks as part of a three-day
program.
The officials, representing
Western European and Eastern
bloc nations as well as China,
Malaysia, Singapore and Brazil,
kicked off the program yesterday
afternoon as Dubinin spoke to a
group of selected faculty and East
European Studies students.
For the past eight to 10 years,
the council has held similar pro

grams — sometimes three or four
annually — throughout the coun
try. Last year's program at Stan
ford dealt with international se
curity and arms control.
Today the program continues
with presentations and informal
discussions, concluding with offi
cials dining in student residences.
Tomorrow's program will fea
ture much of the same type of
faculty and diplomatic interaction
during the day and will culminate
in a dinner featuring Shultz.
