Like most residents of Northern Cal
ifornia, Stanford community members
are wondering when they can expect a
break from the frigid temperatures that
have sent them scrambling for their
down comforters.
Fortunately, the end may be in sight.
While temperatures today are ex
pected to remain a somewhat chilly 40
to 50 degrees in the Bay Area, warmer
weather should be here by tomorrow,
according to the National Weather Serv
ice.

Temperatures last night were ex
pected to dip into the upper teens to
mid-30s, and tonight they should range
from 25 to 30 degrees.
By tomorrow, however, daytime highs
should hit 45 to 50 degrees.
Arctic air that set low temperatures
across Alaska starting in late January
triggered the recent wave of unprece
dented cold weather in the Bay Area.
Locally, Palo Alto registered a low of
27 degrees Monday morning. But
despite the unusual weather, few prob
lems have been reported.
"We have not had a big power outage,"

said Ruth Interiano of the Palo Alto
Utilities Department. There have been
reports of frozen water pipes, and as
expected power consumption is up, In
teriano said.
At Stanford, the Operations and
Maintenance Office reported no frozen
pipes and only scattered patches of ice.
With at least one more day of cold
weather forecast, temperatures have al
ready tied or broken records around the
Bay Area.
The coldest spot on the Peninsula
yesterday morning was Portola Valley,
where temperatures read 16 degrees.
