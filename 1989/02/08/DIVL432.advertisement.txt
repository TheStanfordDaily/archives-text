What Is It? Asian American Studies. Asian Americans
comprise such a large percentage of the student population here, yet the Stanford com
munity currently provides few resources for individuals to learn about the enormous
contributions made by Asian Americans to American society. Stanford has no tenured
faculty to teach Asian American Studies and presently offers no permanent Asian
American Studies classes. The occasional SWOPSI courses and the yearly renewed "In
tro to Asian American History" are usually over-enrolled, and such courses continue
to gain popularity.
Professor Gordon Chang, who teaches the history course, has been offered a tenure
track position from UC Irvine. If nothing is done, Stanford will lose one of the top
scholars in Asian American History, the only professor here who has taught a
departmental Asian American Studies Course. What is wrong with this picture?
The ultimate goal of the Asian American Student Association (AASA) and the ASSU
is the creation of an Asian American Studies Department. The first step is the hiring
of a tenure track Asian American history professor in order to create some permanence
in Asian American Studies. With your help, it can be done.
What can you do? Many students are now involved in a petition drive. SIGN IT! Or
better yet, join in and get others to sign.
ALSO ... Attend an AASA Issues Committee meeting. They happen every Wednesday
at 5 at the Asian American Activities Center. Everyone is welcome.
If you have any questions, or just want to help, call Richard Suh at 325-1955 or call
the COP at 725-ASSU.
Students, are you tired of overcrowded
sections and the shortage ofTAs?
TAs, are you tired of being overworked
and underpaid?
What's happening? For the 1988 -89 school year, the School of Humanities and Sciences
(H&S) has made a 6% cut ($200,000) to the budget for Teaching Assistants, which has
exacerbated the problem of overcrowded sections. That is why the ASSU Committee on
Democracy in Education (CODE) and the COP are working hard to restore money for the
TA program.
Effects of Cutbacks.
To deal with the cutbacks, departments have:
• Increased section sizes and number of sections per TA
• Asked TA's to work more hours without comparable pay raise
• Decreased TA's by reassigning some to non-teaching positions
• Reduced the number of TA's available to faculty
For example...
• Most sections in Asian Languages exceed 40 students!
• In an Econ class there was only one TA for over 120 students!!
Graduate Students in H&S.
We know that conditions for graduate student TA's are not ideal and that there are special
concerns that need to be addressed. That is why we have brought together grad students to
air concerns and take action. We hope you'll take time to complete the survey put together
and also sign the petition that is being circulated. Thanks.
How You Can Help.
• Look for the petition that is coming around. Sign it.
• Write a letter to the Daily. Have your friends sign it also.
• Have your parents write a letter to the Provost's office.
• Get involved with the ASSU Committee on Democracy in Education . . .
CODE meets Mondays at 6 pm at the ASSU;
call 723-ASSU for info.
FED UP WITH FOOD SERVICE?
YOU'RE NOT ALONE.
Several students and an RAin Paloma raised concerns about University Food Service and the limited
options offered students. In response, the People's Platform Council of Presidents (COP) brought the
students together to formulate a list of concerns and actions to be taken. With the help of ASSU Dorm
Reps, the COP has found that these concents are shared campuswide.
Students Want More Options:
• 10 meal plan option in addition to 14 and 19 meal plans
• A point system option
• Allowing carry over of unused meals
• Greater savings between the 14 and 19 meal plans
Taking Action. The committee has already called other college campuses to compare prices
and meal plans and have talked to several administrators. Jim Keeton, Director of Food
Service, has tentatively agreed to attend the meeting tomorrow (Thursday, February 9, at
noon, in Paloma Lounge).
Get involved ...
call the COP at 725-ASSU
and stop by Paloma tomorrow.
THE COMMITTEE ON UNDERGRADUATE
THE ASSU BULLETIN BOARD
t MJP * ' 9St * - 'liiiJu A
The Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aids is a policy setting
body that oversees the Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aids offices.
Last year, the committee discussed the financial aid system (especially in regard to
lowering self help requirements), Asian American admissions and the Jordan Scholar
Program. The committee decided not to expand financial aid available to international
students (the existing amount is not fully utilized at this time) and leaned toward
requiring Achievement Tests for admission but did not make a final decision on this
issue.
This year, the committee has decided to continue the Pro Fro Travel Grant Program
(paying for visiting costs of minority and Jordan Scholar pro fros who have a high level
of financial need). In addition, the committee will be discussing whether to increase
the number of targeted minority groups possibly to include Native Hawaiians and
Puerto Ricans, whether to change the Financial Aids self help policy, and whether to
recommend or require Achievement Tests.
If you have an interest in any of the issues being dealt with by the committee this
year, you can contact the student members of the committee:
Romy Lerner 325-6706
Otto Lin 857-1473
Cecil Talbott 325-3573
If you have questions about other committees or would like to get in touch with
people on other committees, call Lloyd Mayer, ASSU Committee Staff Assistant, at 723-
9521 (MWF or 324-3935.
