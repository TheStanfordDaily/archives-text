A number of recent incidents on the campus have
involved racially and ethnically offensive expression (some
by students, some by persons unknown):
• a student "vigil" at Otero House evoking images of the
Ku Klux Klan;
• the word "niggers" written across a poster;
• a poster sketch of Beethoven altered to a caricature of
a black person;
• "Non-blacks leave our home, you do not belong in
Ujamaa" messages following the Beethoven poster episode;
• the distribution on campus of White Aryan Resistance
fliers;
• and placement of anti-Semitic leaflets on cars around
the Oval.
These separate events have prompted a number of
questions about whether such communication is or should
be regulated by Stanford's internal student disciplinary
system, and if so to what extent.
This paper discusses what has been done at Stanford
in cases involving disruptive or offensive behavior that
consists essentially of speech and closely-related conduct.
It also explores the principles that are related to and
determine the University's actions.
It is unfortunate but probably inevitable that this review
comes at a time when emotion runs high. At such times,
our effort to adhere to principles of long-term value may
appear to ignore, or undervalue, the pain caused by the
behavior we are considering. Most of us feel outraged by
racist views; their expression is a violation of civility, and
the views themselves are repugnant to the values we hold
and would promote.
We must find ways to heal those who are hurt, and
to persuade those who are mistaken. But we must do this
through education, and not through proscription or pre
scription of thought. This paper has an underlying con
viction: it is that a university, even more than any other
institution, must preserve itself as a forum for the compe
tition of ideas, and in doing so must tolerate the expression
of ideas that some or most of us find repugnant.
In the abstract, this, conviction is no doubt shared by
nearly all members of the Stanford community. Many may
differ, however, about its appropriate influence in cases
of racially or ethnically offensive expression. If this paper
provides a framework for discussion of the issues, it will
have served an important purpose.
It begins by considering the structure of the student
disciplinary system and the standards applied in deciding
whether or not to file charges. The application of First
Amendment principles to interpretation of rules of student
conduct and a summary of the principles are taken up
next. Past examples of cases involving expression and the
recent case of the Beethoven poster are then considered
in light of these standards and principles. Finally, the
relationship of freedom of expression to the University
goal of freedom from bigotry is discussed.
The Structure of the Student
Disciplinary System
Stanford has three main substantive rules of student
conduct: the Fundamental Standard — the basic, and very
general, rule of student behavior; the Policy on Campus
Disruption (also applicable to faculty and staff); and the
Honor Code.' Charges are brought by the President through
his designate. If they are contested, they are prosecuted
before the Stanford Judicial Council. The SJC consists of
three students, three faculty members, and student or faculty
co-chairs who preside, respectively, in Honor Code and
non-Honor-Code cases.
The structure of that system parallels the external
criminal system in significant ways: It enforces behavioral
rules of general applicability, requires proof beyond a rea
sonable doubt to establish guilt, permits but does not
require the accused to give testimony, and imposes
penalties.
Standards for Prosecuting
Student Disciplinary Cases
One standard has been applied by the University in
the consideration of every student disciplinary matter: No
charges for violation of rules of student conduct are filed
unless the President's designate responsible for bringing
those charges is convinced (a) that the student to be charged
did in fact violate one of the substantive rules of conduct
and (b) that, in accordance with the requirements set forth
in the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968, the case
against the student can be proved beyond a reasonable
doubt.
Some have quarrelled with the limitations of this ap
proach. They have argued that if the facts of the case are
clear, but it is unclear whether they constitute a violation
of a rule of student conduct, the student should be charged
— leaving it to the SJC to decide the matter and submit
its recommendation to the President.
Still others have argued that despite uncertainties about
culpability or proof, charges should be filed in situations
where there is general concern over the conduct in question
so that the SJC can be a vehicle for broad community
discussion and consideration of the matter, or for symbolic
reasons — to negate any appearance of administrative com
placency with respect to the conduct in question.
Despite the urgings to increase the range of cases in
which charges are filed, however, the principle has been
followed without exception: we treat the student judicial
system as our "criminal law" system, serving only disci
plinary ends. To invoke it in order to satisfy some ancillary
agenda — in the face of the prosecutor's doubts about
whether the proof is in hand, or whether the conduct
actually violates the rules — would pervert that system.
We have a second standard, specific to decisions on
whether or not to charge a student where the conduct
consists essentially of speech: The University should be
as tolerant of such conduct as possible. The Policy on
Campus Disruption expressly recognizes the importance
of preserving free speech rights. It states in part:
Because the rights of free speech and peaceable
assembly are fundamental to the democratic process,
Stanford firmly supports the rights of all members of
the University community to express their views or
to protest against actions and opinions with which
they disagree.
All members of the University also share a concur
rent obligation to maintain on the campus an atmos
phere conducive to scholarly pursuits; to preserve the
dignity and seriousness of University ceremonies and
public exercises; and to respect the rights of all in
dividuals.
The following regulations are intended to reconcile
these objectives:
It is violation of University policy for a member of
the faculty, staff, or student body to (1) prevent or
disrupt the effective carrying out of a University func
tion or approved activity, such as lectures, meetings,
interviews, ceremonies, the conduct of University busi
ness in a University office, and public events; (2)
obstruct the legitimate movement of any person about
the campus or in any University building or facility. . ..
As it applies to students, the Policy on Campus Dis
ruption is a particular application of the Fundamental
Standard. 2
Applicability of First Amendment
Principles to Interpretation of
the Policy on Campus Disruption
and the Fundamental Standard
Since Stanford is not a governmental entity, but a
private institution, it is not bound by the First Amendment,
and can regulate or curtail the expression of thought to a
greater extent than a government — or state university —
may. As a matter of principle, though, it has not done so.
Faith in the competition of ideas, in the power of robust
and untrammeled debate, underlies the First Amendment's
protection of expression. That is a national commitment;
in a university, whose whole reason for being is the pro
duction and transmission of knowledge, that commitment
is even stronger. The only orthodoxy of thought we can
permit is the principle that no ideas be suppressed. Since
the Disruption Policy, as noted above, applies explicitly to
faculty and staff as well, the case involving Professor H.
Bruce Franklin is particularly relevant to the current dis
cussion, since it makes clear that First Amendment prin
ciples are integral to that Policy. It is the only case in
which the University has formally considered the appro
priate limits of free speech bv faculty.
In the Franklin case, the Advisory Board of the Aca
demic Council (a committee of seven, elected by and from
the Stanford faculty) concluded that "it is the University's
responsibility to enhance the exercise of rights of free
speech which the First Amendment merely protects against
governmental interference." Hence, the Advisory Board
decided in the particular case before it that there should
be no less protection of free speech here at Stanford. As
set forth by the Advisory Board in that case:
It is open to a private university to impose consti
tutional limitations on itself as a deliberate choice of
policy; in advance of the hearing the Board committed
itself to at least this much in undertaking to provide
for Professor Franklin "no less protection of his con
stitutional rights at Stanford than that to which he
could be entitled as a member of the faculty of a state
university."
At the same time, the Advisory Board concluded that,
consistent with its commitment to freedom of expression,
Stanford could punish speech that was disruptive of Uni
versity activities. It found that the University's Policy on
Campus Disruption is consistent with First Amendment
principles, and decided that some of the speech in the
case before it did indeed violate that Policy.
First Amendment Principles
Since the University has determined that First Amend
ment principles should inform its interpretation of its in
ternal policies, it may be useful to summarize four of these
principles.
First, for First Amendment purposes, speech includes
not only the spoken and written word, but expression
through art and symbolic means.
Second, government may not regulate or curtail the
content of one's speech, with very limited exceptions —
such as obscenity, "fighting words" directed to an individ
ual, 3 some kinds of defamation, and speech immediately
1. In addition, the SJC enforces the Liquor Policy, the Drug Abuse
Policy, and the Prohibition of the Possession of Dangerous Weapons
on Campus. Students must comply with other policies as well, such
as the residence agreement and the regulations governing studant or
ganizations, but charges prosecuted through the student judicial system
must involve violations of the listed rules. Departments may also apply
rules related to the particular academic field, but these are not enfarcod
through the disciplinary system.
2. The Fundamental Standard states in part that "students are expected
to show both within and without the University such respect for order,
morality, personal honor and the rights of others as is demanded of
good citizens. .. ."
3. "Fighting words," as the term is currently applied, means words
tending to incite immediate violence by the peivon to whom they are
addressed in face-to-face confrontations.
A number of recent incidents on the campus have
involved racially and ethnically offensive expression (some
by students, some by persons unknown):
• a student "vigil" at Otero House evoking images of the
Ku Klux Klan;

his designate. If they are contested, they are prosecuted
before the Stanford Judicial Council. The SJC consists of
three students, three faculty members, and student or faculty
co-chairs who preside, respectively, in Honor Code and
non-Honor-Code cases.
The structure of that system parallels the external
criminal system in significant ways: It enforces behavioral
rules of general applicability, requires proof beyond a rea
sonable doubt to establish guilt, permits but does not
require the accused to give testimony, and imposes
penalties.
Standards for Prosecuting
Student Disciplinary Cases
One standard has been applied by the University in
the consideration of every student disciplinary matter: No
charges for violation of rules of student conduct are filed
unless the President's designate responsible for bringing
those charges is convinced (a) that the student to be charged
did in fact violate one of the substantive rules of conduct
and (b) that, in accordance with the requirements set forth
in the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968, the case
against the student can be proved beyond a reasonable
doubt.
Some have quarrelled with the limitations of this ap
proach. They have argued that if the facts of the case are
clear, but it is unclear whether they constitute a violation
of a rule of student conduct, the student should be charged
— leaving it to the SJC to decide the matter and submit
its recommendation to the President.
Still others have argued that despite uncertainties about
culpability or proof, charges should be filed in situations
where there is general concern over the conduct in question
so that the SJC can be a vehicle for broad community
discussion and consideration of the matter, or for symbolic
reasons — to negate any appearance of administrative com
placency with respect to the conduct in question.
Despite the urgings to increase the range of cases in
which charges are filed, however, the principle has been
followed without exception: we treat the student judicial
system as our "criminal law" system, serving only disci
plinary ends. To invoke it in order to satisfy some ancillary
agenda — in the face of the prosecutor's doubts about
whether the proof is in hand, or whether the conduct
actually violates the rules — would pervert that system.
We have a second standard, specific to decisions on
whether or not to charge a student where the conduct
consists essentially of speech: The University should be
as tolerant of such conduct as possible. The Policy on
Campus Disruption expressly recognizes the importance
of preserving free speech rights. It states in part:
Because the rights of free speech and peaceable
assembly are fundamental to the democratic process,
Stanford firmly supports the rights of all members of
the University community to express their views or
to protest against actions and opinions with which
they disagree.
All members of the University also share a concur
rent obligation to maintain on the campus an atmos
phere conducive to scholarly pursuits; to preserve the
dignity and seriousness of University ceremonies and
public exercises; and to respect the rights of all in
dividuals.
The following regulations are intended to reconcile
these objectives:
It is violation of University policy for a member of
the faculty, staff, or student body to (1) prevent or
disrupt the effective carrying out of a University func
tion or approved activity, such as lectures, meetings,
interviews, ceremonies, the conduct of University busi
ness in a University office, and public events; (2)
obstruct the legitimate movement of any person about
the campus or in any University building or facility. . ..
As it applies to students, the Policy on Campus Dis
ruption is a particular application of the Fundamental
Standard. 2
Applicability of First Amendment
Principles to Interpretation of
the Policy on Campus Disruption
and the Fundamental Standard
Since Stanford is not a governmental entity, but a
private institution, it is not bound by the First Amendment,
and can regulate or curtail the expression of thought to a
greater extent than a government — or state university —
may. As a matter of principle, though, it has not done so.
Faith in the competition of ideas, in the power of robust
and untrammeled debate, underlies the First Amendment's
protection of expression. That is a national commitment;
in a university, whose whole reason for being is the pro
duction and transmission of knowledge, that commitment
is even stronger. The only orthodoxy of thought we can
permit is the principle that no ideas be suppressed. Since
the Disruption Policy, as noted above, applies explicitly to
faculty and staff as well, the case involving Professor H.
Bruce Franklin is particularly relevant to the current dis
cussion, since it makes clear that First Amendment prin
ciples are integral to that Policy. It is the only case in
which the University has formally considered the appro
priate limits of free speech bv faculty.
In the Franklin case, the Advisory Board of the Aca
demic Council (a committee of seven, elected by and from
the Stanford faculty) concluded that "it is the University's
responsibility to enhance the exercise of rights of free
speech which the First Amendment merely protects against
governmental interference." Hence, the Advisory Board
decided in the particular case before it that there should
be no less protection of free speech here at Stanford. As
set forth by the Advisory Board in that case:
It is open to a private university to impose consti
tutional limitations on itself as a deliberate choice of
policy; in advance of the hearing the Board committed
itself to at least this much in undertaking to provide
for Professor Franklin "no less protection of his con
stitutional rights at Stanford than that to which he
could be entitled as a member of the faculty of a state
university."
At the same time, the Advisory Board concluded that,
consistent with its commitment to freedom of expression,
Stanford could punish speech that was disruptive of Uni
versity activities. It found that the University's Policy on
Campus Disruption is consistent with First Amendment
principles, and decided that some of the speech in the
case before it did indeed violate that Policy.
First Amendment Principles
Since the University has determined that First Amend
ment principles should inform its interpretation of its in
ternal policies, it may be useful to summarize four of these
principles.
First, for First Amendment purposes, speech includes
not only the spoken and written word, but expression
through art and symbolic means.
Second, government may not regulate or curtail the
content of one's speech, with very limited exceptions —
such as obscenity, "fighting words" directed to an individ
ual, 3 some kinds of defamation, and speech immediately
1. In addition, the SJC enforces the Liquor Policy, the Drug Abuse
Policy, and the Prohibition of the Possession of Dangerous Weapons
on Campus. Students must comply with other policies as well, such
as the residence agreement and the regulations governing studant or
ganizations, but charges prosecuted through the student judicial system
must involve violations of the listed rules. Departments may also apply
rules related to the particular academic field, but these are not enfarcod
through the disciplinary system.
2. The Fundamental Standard states in part that "students are expected
to show both within and without the University such respect for order,
morality, personal honor and the rights of others as is demanded of
good citizens. .. ."
3. "Fighting words," as the term is currently applied, means words
tending to incite immediate violence by the peivon to whom they are
addressed in face-to-face confrontations.
A number of recent incidents on the campus have
involved racially and ethnically offensive expression (some
by students, some by persons unknown):
• a student "vigil" at Otero House evoking images of the
Ku Klux Klan;
• the word "niggers" written across a poster;
• a poster sketch of Beethoven altered to a caricature of
a black person;
• "Non-blacks leave our home, you do not belong in
Ujamaa" messages following the Beethoven poster episode;
• the distribution on campus of White Aryan Resistance
fliers;
• and placement of anti-Semitic leaflets on cars around
the Oval.
These separate events have prompted a number of
questions about whether such communication is or should
be regulated by Stanford's internal student disciplinary
system, and if so to what extent.
This paper discusses what has been done at Stanford
in cases involving disruptive or offensive behavior that
consists essentially of speech and closely-related conduct.
It also explores the principles that are related to and
determine the University's actions.
It is unfortunate but probably inevitable that this review
comes at a time when emotion runs high. At such times,
our effort to adhere to principles of long-term value may
appear to ignore, or undervalue, the pain caused by the
behavior we are considering. Most of us feel outraged by
racist views; their expression is a violation of civility, and
the views themselves are repugnant to the values we hold
and would promote.
We must find ways to heal those who are hurt, and
to persuade those who are mistaken. But we must do this
through education, and not through proscription or pre
scription of thought. This paper has an underlying con
viction: it is that a university, even more than any other
institution, must preserve itself as a forum for the compe
tition of ideas, and in doing so must tolerate the expression
of ideas that some or most of us find repugnant.
In the abstract, this, conviction is no doubt shared by
nearly all members of the Stanford community. Many may
differ, however, about its appropriate influence in cases
of racially or ethnically offensive expression. If this paper
provides a framework for discussion of the issues, it will
have served an important purpose.
It begins by considering the structure of the student
disciplinary system and the standards applied in deciding
whether or not to file charges. The application of First
Amendment principles to interpretation of rules of student
conduct and a summary of the principles are taken up
next. Past examples of cases involving expression and the
recent case of the Beethoven poster are then considered
in light of these standards and principles. Finally, the
relationship of freedom of expression to the University
goal of freedom from bigotry is discussed.
The Structure of the Student
Disciplinary System
Stanford has three main substantive rules of student
conduct: the Fundamental Standard — the basic, and very
general, rule of student behavior; the Policy on Campus
Disruption (also applicable to faculty and staff); and the
Honor Code.' Charges are brought by the President through
his designate. If they are contested, they are prosecuted
before the Stanford Judicial Council. The SJC consists of
three students, three faculty members, and student or faculty

non-Honor-Code cases.

The following regulations are intended to reconcile
these objectives:
It is violation of University policy for a member of
the faculty, staff, or student body to (1) prevent or
disrupt the effective carrying out of a University func
tion or approved activity, such as lectures, meetings,
interviews, ceremonies, the conduct of University busi
ness in a University office, and public events; (2)
obstruct the legitimate movement of any person about
the campus or in any University building or facility. . ..
As it applies to students, the Policy on Campus Dis
ruption is a particular application of the Fundamental
Standard. 2
Applicability of First Amendment
Principles to Interpretation of
the Policy on Campus Disruption
and the Fundamental Standard
Since Stanford is not a governmental entity, but a
private institution, it is not bound by the First Amendment,
and can regulate or curtail the expression of thought to a
greater extent than a government — or state university —
may. As a matter of principle, though, it has not done so.
Faith in the competition of ideas, in the power of robust
and untrammeled debate, underlies the First Amendment's
protection of expression. That is a national commitment;
in a university, whose whole reason for being is the pro
duction and transmission of knowledge, that commitment
is even stronger. The only orthodoxy of thought we can
permit is the principle that no ideas be suppressed. Since
the Disruption Policy, as noted above, applies explicitly to
faculty and staff as well, the case involving Professor H.
Bruce Franklin is particularly relevant to the current dis
cussion, since it makes clear that First Amendment prin
ciples are integral to that Policy. It is the only case in
which the University has formally considered the appro
priate limits of free speech bv faculty.
In the Franklin case, the Advisory Board of the Aca
demic Council (a committee of seven, elected by and from
the Stanford faculty) concluded that "it is the University's
responsibility to enhance the exercise of rights of free
speech which the First Amendment merely protects against
governmental interference." Hence, the Advisory Board
decided in the particular case before it that there should
be no less protection of free speech here at Stanford. As
set forth by the Advisory Board in that case:
It is open to a private university to impose consti
tutional limitations on itself as a deliberate choice of
policy; in advance of the hearing the Board committed
itself to at least this much in undertaking to provide
for Professor Franklin "no less protection of his con
stitutional rights at Stanford than that to which he
could be entitled as a member of the faculty of a state
university."
At the same time, the Advisory Board concluded that,
consistent with its commitment to freedom of expression,
Stanford could punish speech that was disruptive of Uni
versity activities. It found that the University's Policy on
Campus Disruption is consistent with First Amendment
principles, and decided that some of the speech in the
case before it did indeed violate that Policy.
First Amendment Principles
Since the University has determined that First Amend
ment principles should inform its interpretation of its in
ternal policies, it may be useful to summarize four of these
principles.
First, for First Amendment purposes, speech includes
not only the spoken and written word, but expression
through art and symbolic means.
Second, government may not regulate or curtail the
content of one's speech, with very limited exceptions —
such as obscenity, "fighting words" directed to an individ
ual, 3 some kinds of defamation, and speech immediately
1. In addition, the SJC enforces the Liquor Policy, the Drug Abuse
Policy, and the Prohibition of the Possession of Dangerous Weapons
on Campus. Students must comply with other policies as well, such
as the residence agreement and the regulations governing studant or
ganizations, but charges prosecuted through the student judicial system
must involve violations of the listed rules. Departments may also apply
rules related to the particular academic field, but these are not enfarcod
through the disciplinary system.
2. The Fundamental Standard states in part that "students are expected
to show both within and without the University such respect for order,
morality, personal honor and the rights of others as is demanded of
good citizens. .. ."
3. "Fighting words," as the term is currently applied, means words
tending to incite immediate violence by the peivon to whom they are
addressed in face-to-face confrontations.
A number of recent incidents on the campus have
involved racially and ethnically offensive expression (some
by students, some by persons unknown):
• a student "vigil" at Otero House evoking images of the
Ku Klux Klan;
• the word "niggers" written across a poster;
• a poster sketch of Beethoven altered to a caricature of
a black person;
• "Non-blacks leave our home, you do not belong in
Ujamaa" messages following the Beethoven poster episode;
• the distribution on campus of White Aryan Resistance
fliers;
• and placement of anti-Semitic leaflets on cars around
the Oval.
These separate events have prompted a number of
questions about whether such communication is or should
be regulated by Stanford's internal student disciplinary
system, and if so to what extent.
This paper discusses what has been done at Stanford
in cases involving disruptive or offensive behavior that
consists essentially of speech and closely-related conduct.
It also explores the principles that are related to and
determine the University's actions.
It is unfortunate but probably inevitable that this review
comes at a time when emotion runs high. At such times,
our effort to adhere to principles of long-term value may
appear to ignore, or undervalue, the pain caused by the
behavior we are considering. Most of us feel outraged by
racist views; their expression is a violation of civility, and
the views themselves are repugnant to the values we hold
and would promote.
We must find ways to heal those who are hurt, and
to persuade those who are mistaken. But we must do this
through education, and not through proscription or pre
scription of thought. This paper has an underlying con
viction: it is that a university, even more than any other
institution, must preserve itself as a forum for the compe
tition of ideas, and in doing so must tolerate the expression
of ideas that some or most of us find repugnant.
In the abstract, this, conviction is no doubt shared by
nearly all members of the Stanford community. Many may
differ, however, about its appropriate influence in cases
of racially or ethnically offensive expression. If this paper
provides a framework for discussion of the issues, it will
have served an important purpose.
It begins by considering the structure of the student
disciplinary system and the standards applied in deciding
whether or not to file charges. The application of First
Amendment principles to interpretation of rules of student
conduct and a summary of the principles are taken up
next. Past examples of cases involving expression and the
recent case of the Beethoven poster are then considered
in light of these standards and principles. Finally, the
relationship of freedom of expression to the University
goal of freedom from bigotry is discussed.
The Structure of the Student
Disciplinary System
Stanford has three main substantive rules of student
conduct: the Fundamental Standard — the basic, and very
general, rule of student behavior; the Policy on Campus
Disruption (also applicable to faculty and staff); and the
Honor Code.' Charges are brought by the President through
his designate. If they are contested, they are prosecuted
before the Stanford Judicial Council. The SJC consists of
three students, three faculty members, and student or faculty
co-chairs who preside, respectively, in Honor Code and
non-Honor-Code cases.
The structure of that system parallels the external
criminal system in significant ways: It enforces behavioral
rules of general applicability, requires proof beyond a rea
sonable doubt to establish guilt, permits but does not
require the accused to give testimony, and imposes
penalties.
Standards for Prosecuting
Student Disciplinary Cases
One standard has been applied by the University in
the consideration of every student disciplinary matter: No
charges for violation of rules of student conduct are filed
unless the President's designate responsible for bringing
those charges is convinced (a) that the student to be charged
did in fact violate one of the substantive rules of conduct
and (b) that, in accordance with the requirements set forth
in the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968, the case
against the student can be proved beyond a reasonable
doubt.
Some have quarrelled with the limitations of this ap
proach. They have argued that if the facts of the case are
clear, but it is unclear whether they constitute a violation
of a rule of student conduct, the student should be charged
— leaving it to the SJC to decide the matter and submit
its recommendation to the President.
Still others have argued that despite uncertainties about
culpability or proof, charges should be filed in situations
where there is general concern over the conduct in question
so that the SJC can be a vehicle for broad community
discussion and consideration of the matter, or for symbolic
reasons — to negate any appearance of administrative com
placency with respect to the conduct in question.
Despite the urgings to increase the range of cases in
which charges are filed, however, the principle has been
followed without exception: we treat the student judicial
system as our "criminal law" system, serving only disci
plinary ends. To invoke it in order to satisfy some ancillary
agenda — in the face of the prosecutor's doubts about
whether the proof is in hand, or whether the conduct
actually violates the rules — would pervert that system.
We have a second standard, specific to decisions on
whether or not to charge a student where the conduct
consists essentially of speech: The University should be
as tolerant of such conduct as possible. The Policy on
Campus Disruption expressly recognizes the importance
of preserving free speech rights. It states in part:
Because the rights of free speech and peaceable
assembly are fundamental to the democratic process,
Stanford firmly supports the rights of all members of
the University community to express their views or
to protest against actions and opinions with which
they disagree.
All members of the University also share a concur
rent obligation to maintain on the campus an atmos
phere conducive to scholarly pursuits; to preserve the
dignity and seriousness of University ceremonies and
public exercises; and to respect the rights of all in
dividuals.
The following regulations are intended to reconcile
these objectives:
It is violation of University policy for a member of
the faculty, staff, or student body to (1) prevent or
disrupt the effective carrying out of a University func
tion or approved activity, such as lectures, meetings,
interviews, ceremonies, the conduct of University busi
ness in a University office, and public events; (2)

the campus or in any University building or facility. . ..
