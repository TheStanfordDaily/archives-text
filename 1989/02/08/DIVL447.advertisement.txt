threatening to the safety of others, or advocacy directed
to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and likely
to produce such action.
Third, reasonable limitations may be placed on the
time, place, and manner of speech, provided these limita
tions do not discriminate with respect to content. For ex
ample, marches, parades and other demonstrations may
be regulated to minimize congestion and safety problems. 4
The Disruption Policy's prohibition of preventing or
obstructing University functions and activities is a valid
"time, place and manner" regulation of speech-related con
duct.
Fourth, the First Amendment protects a speaker's de
cision to remain anonymous. Anonymous speech is not
attractive, but it must be protected to assure that proponents
of unpopular ideas can in fact exercise freedom of expres
sion.
Whether or not racial slurs, insults, epithets and other
racially offensive expression fall within the limited excep
tions to First Amendment protection depends upon the
extent to which they are directed against a specific person
or persons, in contrast to a general group.
For example, in the case upholding the right of Amer
ican Nazis to demonstrate in the predominantly Jewish
community of Skokie, Illinois, the federal courts rejected
the city's argument that any of these exceptions permitted
a city to prohibit speech that promotes hatred against
persons by reason of their race: The speech certainly caused
extreme mental and emotional disturbance to many; but
vilification of a race or group (rather than specific indi
viduals) could not be prohibited as defamation, 5 nor could
it be prohibited as threatening unless it tended to create
immediate violence by the particular person to whom the
words were addressed. The march, and its attendant dis
semination of materials that promote racial hatred and
endorse a loathsome ideology, could not be prohibited or
punished.
Past Examples of Cases
Involving Expression
The Franklin case involved a faculty member, but as
already noted, it involved a rule that applies to students
as well. Both before and after the Franklin case, the speech
related conduct of a number of students has been found
to violate the Policy on Campus Disruption or the Funda
mental Standard. 6 The decision whether, consistent with
First Amendment principles, a student may be charged with
violating the Fundamental Standard and / or the Policy on
Campus Disruption as a result of expression is on some
occasions relatively easy and on others extraordinarily dif
ficult.
Examples of the former include the Henry Cabot Lodge
case in 1971, where the students' interruptions prevented
the speaker from being heard, and the Academic Council
case in 1972, where the students insisted on speaking at
a closed meeting of the faculty. As the Disruption Policy
makes explicit, preventing or seriously interfering with
University functions is prohibited: the message must be
delivered elsewhere, at other times, or in a different manner.
The "Otero 7" case and various peaceful student sit-ins
are examples of the more difficult decisions — in the one
case because of the First Amendment principles, and in
the others because of the University's additional practice
of permitting the expression of thought when, by suffering
only minor obstruction of limited activities, it is reasonably
possible to do so.
In one of the sit-in cases in May, 1985, for example,
during a Trustees meeting on the campus, a number of
students lay down behind the Trustees' parked cars as a
means of expressing their conviction over the "divestment"
issue. The conduct was clearly not protected by First
Amendment principles and was a provable violation of the
Policy on Campus Disruption.
But while there is no right to greater protection than
the First Amendment affords, the University has refrained
from legitimate disciplinary action in the interest of per
mitting peaceful expression. The Trustees were asked if
they would mind leaving their cars where they were and
obtaining other transportation to and from the campus
until the protest ended. Their agreement made the disrup
tion relatively minor, and eased the decision to file no
charges.
It should be noted that the decision was content
neutral: the same result would have been reached had the
demonstration been in favor of investment in South Africa.
In the "Otero 7" incident last Spring, seven students
wearing masks and carrying candles went to Otero House
and sat peacefully on the patio outside the House's lounge
to protest the eviction from the House of another student
for conduct in violation of the residence agreement.
Many residents of the House became extremely agitated
over what they perceived to be the image of the Ku Klux
Klan. One of the seven participants told a Stanford Daily
editor at the scene that this was a silent vigil, and then
wrote on a piece of paper that the vigil was intended
merely to protest the eviction of the other student. The
Daily editor read the note to the crowd that had gathered.
Several of those in the crowd challenged the participants
to remove their masks, take responsibility for their views,
and recognize the symbolic impact of their appearance.
When interviewed, the participants expressed surprise
and dismay that what they had intended to be a demon
stration of support for the evicted student was perceived
as a racist display. They stated that they wore masks to
avoid recognition and disregard as "fraternity guys" and
that they carried candles because they thought that was
how protests were made.
The decision whether or not to seek disciplinary action
against the "Otero 7" had an aspect not presented by the
divestment protest. The Otero "vigil" did not occur in the
street, but at a residence — a place in which the occupants
ought to enjoy singular freedom from fear, but were in
fact made fearful. On the other hand, our dormitories are
not private residences, nor are they simply residences:
They are part of Stanford's residential education program,
and serve also as forums for discussion and education.
In any event, the seven participants said they did not
intend to look like the KKK, and there was no proof to
the contrary. It was clear that they did not intend their
protest to endorse anything the KKK advocates, and their
protest was not directed to any particular residents of Otero
house. Other than wearing masks and carrying candles
(which may have evoked, for some, the torches of the
Klan), the appearance of the seven students did not in fact
resemble that of the Ku Klux Klan.
It could be argued that the seven students disrupted
the University's residential education program as a result
of the anxiety that the vigil created. Nevertheless, under
First Amendment principles (a) since the University does
not 7 ban all demonstrations at residences, it could not ban
this one without discriminating on the basis of content;
and (b) discriminating on the basis of content would be
improper because the symbolic conduct of this demonstra
tion, however thoughtless and upsetting, was not obscene
or defamatory, nor did it constitute "fighting words."
It could also be argued that the conduct of the seven
students could be construed as a threat to the safety of
the residents; but that simply was inconsistent with the
provable facts.
Thus, both of the principles mentioned above tipped
the scales against disciplinary action. There was no
evidence of the intent necessary to prove a violation of the
Policy on Campus Disruption or the Fundamental Standard;
interpreting those rules consistent with First Amendment
principles, there was no violation even apart from moti
vation. Moreover, the conduct was expression, which the
University seeks to permit to the greatest extent possible.
Again, the decision was content-neutral: if all the other
facts had been the same, the decision would have been
the same even if the expression had been racially motivated.
The Beethoven Poster Episode
Some of the elements in the Otero incident were also
present in the recent incident involving the Beethoven
poster. The latter also occurred at a residence — indeed,
it occurred inside the house rather than outside. From the
recently published Ujamaa Report, it appears that it also
was offensive to most of the residents of Ujamaa, and the
reactions to it disrupted the lives of the students there. 8
There are of course differences between the Beethoven
and the Otero cases. The students involved in the Beethoven
case were themselves residents of Lagunita Court, and
students living in a residence should certainly be able to
express their thoughts and opinions to their fellow resi
dents. Indeed, it would seem from the Report that the
Beethoven incident was the result of a discussion among
residents of Ujamaa as to Beethoven's role in the contri
bution to music by blacks (the position having been ad
vanced that Beethoven had black forebears).
It appears from that Report that the two students in
volved in the Ujamaa episode did intend to produce a
ludicrous, racial caricature of blacks, in contrast to the
absence of any racially offensive intent in the Otero case.
But there was nothing on the caricature, nor does the
Report suggest that the poster was intended, to threaten
or defame any particular student or students. What remains,
then, even if the two students knew how the caricature
would be perceived, is racially offensive speech directed,
perhaps, to members of a race generally.
Under these circumstances, as in the Otero case, the
standards mentioned at the outset counsel against seeking
disciplinary action: there is no evidence of the intent nec
essary to prove a violation of the Policy on Campus Dis
ruption or the Fundamental Standard; interpreting those
rules consistent with First Amendment principles, there
was no violation even apart from motivation. And again,
the conduct was expression, which the University seeks
to permit to the greatest extent possible. 9
By the same token, several of the other instances
referred to at the outset — the White Aryan Resistance
posters, the anti-Semitic leaflets, the "niggers" poster —
are also protected from punishment even if the perpetrators
were known. The "Non-blacks ... do not belong in Ujamaa"
messages would be a case that depended on more facts —
primarily issues of provable intent to threaten or defame
specific individuals. 10
It has been suggested that the University would be
better off if the Policy on Campus Disruption and the
Fundamental Standard were supplemented by more specific
rules with respect to conduct that consists essentially of
speech.
The flexibility that the University has had in respond
ing to the kinds of activities described here has, however,
been substantially facilitated because the two policies are
broadly written. And in the few instances where the stu
dents involved in the conduct in question might well not
have been aware of its disruptive nature or its adverse
effect on other individuals in violation of the Fundamental
Standard, the University gave advance warning to the stu
dents or the student body generally that further conduct
of that nature would indeed lead to disciplinary charges
— thus preserving the right to fair notice without doing
violence to the nature of our disciplinary system.
In short, there is little to be gained and a great deal
to be lost by any attempt to add substantial specificity to
Stanford's rules of student conduct in connection with
matters of this nature. The important nuances of the kind
discussed here defy codification, and the University must
be able to continue to consider them.
Freedom from Insult on Racial,
Ethnic and Other Grounds
In thinking about First Amendment principles, it is
important to keep always in mind that these are individual
rights; they do not depend on the agreement of the majority
that the views expressed are within some pale of acceptable
ideas. Even if all people of good will deplore and detest
an opinion, they may not prohibit or punish it because of
its content."
Some have urged that Stanford's Fundamental Standard
is in conflict with, or perhaps overrides, First Amendment
principles because it demands "respect for...the rights of
others" and we hold out freedom from insult on racial,
ethnic, sexual and other such grounds as a right we mean
to provide within the community. But no one has a right
that another person not hold an opinion, or express it.
The preamble to the Disruption Policy specifically
confirms the rights of free speech and peaceable assembly.
The reason the preamble appears in the Disruption Policy
is that disruption — shouting others down and preventing
their own speech, blocking their movements, incitement to
lawless action, and so on — is the main way that the
rights of others may be denied by speech-related conduct.
The purpose of the preamble is to point out that even as
we protect those rights of others, we do so within the
constraints of affording all members of the community the
right to express their views; these constraints apply equally
to our other policies, including the Fundamental Standard.
What, then, does it mean to say that conduct that
discourages full participation of any student in the life of
this University on account of sex, race, color, origin, reli
gion, or sexual orientation is not tolerable?
It is a temptation, especially in the heat of a painful
episode in which we have fallen short of our goal, to say
these are illusory promises, or mere hypocrisy, if the in
stitution is not willing to back them up by prosecutions.
But the disciplinary system is not the only, nor the
primary, way to achieve the goal. We are embarked on a
quest for a community in which we all enjoy, and afford
each other, full civil rights: not only tolerance, but appre
ciation for the entire range of cultural and personal diversity;
not only civility, but freedom from the insidious effects of
bigotry, stated and unstated; not token or marginal tenancy,
but citizenship — the true sense of being a welcome and
valued member of the whole.
It is a frightening quest, because we have the sense
that if the goal cannot be achieved here, in a university,
it cannot be achieved anywhere. But if it is to be achieved
in a university, it must be done by our traditional tools
— discussion, education, persuasion. The great value of
our struggle to become first an example — proving that it
can be done — and then a model for its being done
elsewhere, lies in the fact that we are attempting to achieve
civil rights without compromising civil liberties.
Mr. Justice Holmes, discussing the importance of free
dom of speech even when the speech is utterly repugnant,
observed:
Persecution for the expression of opinions seems to
me perfectly logical. If you have no doubt of your
premises or your power and want a certain result with
all your heart you naturally express your wishes in
law and sweep away all opposition. To allow oppo
sition by speech seems to indicate that you think the
speech impotent, as when a man says that he has
squared the circle, or that you do not care whole
heartedly for the result, or that you doubt either your
power or your premises. But when men have realized
that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may
come to believe even more than they believe the very
foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate
good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas
— that the best test of truth is the power of the
thought to get itself accepted in the competition of
the market, and that truth is the only ground upon
which their wishes safely can be curried out. That at
any rate is the theory of our Constitution. It is an
experiment, as all life is an experiment. Every year if
not every day we have to wager our salvation upon
some prophecy based upon imperfect knowledge.
While that experiment is part of our system I think
that we should be eternally vigilant against attempts
to check the expression of opinions that we loathe
and believe to be fraught with death, unless they so
imminently threaten immediate interference with the
lawful and pressing purposes of the law that an im
mediate check is required to save the country.
The passage comes from Holmes' dissenting opinion
in Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616 (1919). He added,
"I regret that I cannot put into more impressive words my
belief that in their conviction upon this indictment the
defendants were deprived of their rights under the Con
stitution of the United States." But his eloquent defense
of freedom of speech presaged and underlies modern First
Amendment law.

4. In some cases, picketing and similar conduct located at an individual
residence and targeted against the people who live there can be
prohibited altogether pursuant to a valid time, place and manner regula
tion.
5. In a 1952 decision, the Supreme Court held that the state could
punish the racial vilification of a group, i.e., group libel. Most courts
and scholars believe, however, that the holding of that case with respect
to group iibel has been effectively overruled by subsequent decisions;
the current weight of authority, like the practice at Stanford, disfavors
limitations on the content of speech, however unpopular.
6. In most of the cases in which a student's speech has been considered
to be impermissible and a violation of rules of conduct, the student
has been charged under the Policy on Campus Disruption rather than
the broader Funda mental Standard.
7. And, consistent with First Amendment principles, the University
probably could not do so.
8. Going back to tho topic of anonymity (and similarly, masks), we
note again that the issue is not altered: surely, tho sit-in cases would
not have been handled differently in respect to disciplinary action had
their participants boon wearing ski masks and holding candles. Had
the two students involved in tho Ujamaa matter stood in White Plaza,
with or without masks, holding their altered Beethoven poster, thero
is little question that such objectionablo, but peaceful, speech in a
public place must be permittod at Stanford. As noted, the difficulty
arisos from the fact that the Beethoven poster opisode occurred inside
the house. One could argue about whether tho board on which it was
posted was a public place within the house, but the main point is that
the poster was not a threat, a libel, or fighting words directed to one
or more individuals personally.
9. The "content" of an opinion cannot be separated from tho style in
which it is expressed. That is, no distinction can be drawn between a
statement that "tho idea that Boethoven was a Black is ridiculous" or
"Blacks don't write classical music" and the rudo cartoon in question
here.
10. It appears from the Report that sheets of paper containing the messago
were slipped under the door of two Ujamaa residents, whilo another
was found posted on a bulletin board in the house.
11. Whilo there are certainly borderline cases, the distinction botweon
speech and action is usually clear. Actions are prohibited when thoy
discriminate on the basis of race, ethnicity, sex and similar such criteria.
Thus, for example, students may not be given discriminatory grades,
excluded from membership in organizations, or denied other University
benefits on these bases, nor will a claim to freedom of expression
protect those who engage in such conduct. Also, destruction of property
— the defacing of the Gay Liberation statue, or graffiti on buildings —
is not protected merely because it also contains expressive elements.
