# Designs on the future: SLAC looks to Next Collider
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Although a costly new linear
collider at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center flopped last sum
mer, SLAC physicists are already
designing a bigger — and
presumably better — particle col
lider that probably would cost the
federal government more than $1
billion.
"It's a fairly exotic machine,"
said SLAC Prof. David Burke, one
of the physicists designing the
second-generation collider. The
planned collider, dubbed the Next
Linear Collider, is still on the
drawing table, and SLAC has not
yet asked the Department of En
ergy for funding.
The Stanford Linear Collider,
which was designed to find the
much sought-after Z particle, was
shut down this summer because
of several technical problems. The
$115 million SLC will continue
operation next month, but the
costly delays have been a imyor
embarrassment for SLAC.
The new machine — which will
be the second largest particle ac
celerator in the world — will be

used to further probe the physics
of the Standard Model, the theo
retical structure that physicists
have created and been using over
the last two decades to explain
the myriad of particles physicists
have found in their enormous par
ticle accelerators. The Standard
Model helps physicists under
stand what happened in the early
universe, a tiny fraction of a sec
ond after the Big Bang.
SLAC officials hope to start
building this eight kilometer-long
giant in 1998, after federal fund
ing for a $4.4 Superconducting
Super Collider winds down. The
Super Collider, a circular ac
celerator 53 miles in circum
ference destined for Texas, is
scheduled to be completed by 1998
if the project is ever funded.
SLAC's new collider will be the
largest research facility in the
world after the Super Collider if
they are both built. The machine
is to be built deep underground,
at an unspecified place on Stan
ford land. If built, the NLC will
be independent of the Stanford
accelerator now in existence.
SLAC will probably not propose
that the Department of Energy

fund the project until about 1993,
Burke said.
"It really depends on how the
research goes (over the next few
years)," SLAC spokesperson Mi
chael Riordan said.
The project would almost cer
tainly be an international col
laboration, involving the
Japanese, the Europeans and the
Soviets, Burke said.
Two accelerators proposed
The collider being evaluated
consists of two four-kilometer
long linear accelerators facing
each other. The machine will
smash together electrons ac
celerated down one of these dis
tances and positrons accelerated
down the other.
The NLC will probably ac
celerate particles to energies of 2
trillion electron volts, Burke said.
The SLC uses just one-twentieth
of this energy to collide electrons
and positrons together.
But the Super Collider — if
funded — will operate years
before the NLC is to be ready,
and at energies fully 20 times
