# Designs on the future: SLAC looks to Next Collider
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Although a costly new linear
collider at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center flopped last sum
mer, SLAC physicists are already
designing a bigger — and
presumably better — particle col
lider that probably would cost the
federal government more than $1
billion.
"It's a fairly exotic machine,"
said SLAC Prof. David Burke, one
of the physicists designing the
second-generation collider. The
planned collider, dubbed the Next
Linear Collider, is still on the
drawing table, and SLAC has not
yet asked the Department of En
ergy for funding.
The Stanford Linear Collider,
which was designed to find the
much sought-after Z particle, was
shut down this summer because
of several technical problems. The
$115 million SLC will continue
operation next month, but the
costly delays have been a imyor
embarrassment for SLAC.
The new machine — which will
be the second largest particle ac
celerator in the world — will be

used to further probe the physics
of the Standard Model, the theo
retical structure that physicists
have created and been using over
the last two decades to explain
the myriad of particles physicists
have found in their enormous par
ticle accelerators. The Standard
Model helps physicists under
stand what happened in the early
universe, a tiny fraction of a sec
ond after the Big Bang.
SLAC officials hope to start
building this eight kilometer-long
giant in 1998, after federal fund
ing for a $4.4 Superconducting
Super Collider winds down. The
Super Collider, a circular ac
celerator 53 miles in circum
ference destined for Texas, is
scheduled to be completed by 1998
if the project is ever funded.
SLAC's new collider will be the
largest research facility in the
world after the Super Collider if
they are both built. The machine
is to be built deep underground,
at an unspecified place on Stan
ford land. If built, the NLC will
be independent of the Stanford
accelerator now in existence.
SLAC will probably not propose
that the Department of Energy

fund the project until about 1993,
Burke said.
"It really depends on how the
research goes (over the next few
years)," SLAC spokesperson Mi
chael Riordan said.
The project would almost cer
tainly be an international col
laboration, involving the
Japanese, the Europeans and the
Soviets, Burke said.
Two accelerators proposed
The collider being evaluated
consists of two four-kilometer
long linear accelerators facing
each other. The machine will
smash together electrons ac
celerated down one of these dis
tances and positrons accelerated
down the other.
The NLC will probably ac
celerate particles to energies of 2
trillion electron volts, Burke said.
The SLC uses just one-twentieth
of this energy to collide electrons
and positrons together.
But the Super Collider — if
funded — will operate years
before the NLC is to be ready,
and at energies fully 20 times

higher than the NLC could
achieve. Physicists are counting
on the efficiency of electron
positron collisions to accomodate
for the disadvantage of lower
energies in the NLC.
SlI\C Director Burton Richter,
a Nobel laureate, disclosed the
planned collider to physicists this
week at a meeting of the High
Energy Program Advisory Panel
in Washington, D.C. Richter could
not be reached for comment.
In over 20 years at SLAC, Rich
ter has assembled an impressive
array of machinery. The linear ac
celerator at SLAC is the longest
and most powerful of its kind in
the world.
Also, since 1983, Richter has
overseen the construction of the
SLC, which uses a unique design
to collide beams of electrons and
positrons — positively charged

cousins of electrons — at tremen
dously high energies. The SLC is
slated to renew operation next
month, after a series of disap
pointing trial runs last summer.
The NLC is actually an exten
sion of the technology of the SLC,
which has had severe problems in
the last year focusing the particle
beams. In fact, the primary pur
pose of the SLC was to serve as
a prototype for other electron
positron colliders.
The SLC accelerates electrons
and positrons around a ring in
opposing arcs so they eventually
collide. Using a three-kilometer
long linear accelerator to boost
electrons and positrons along arcs
before they collide, the NLC will
accelerate electrons and positrons
in straight lines directly at one
another.
The cutting edge

for the NLC project, the labora
tory might once again be at the

Collider must be focused to a distance

cutting edge of particle physics
research sometime in the begin
ning of the next century.
Since about 1978, however,
SLAC has remained relatively
quiet. The center's heydey, which
began in the late 1960s with the
discovery of quarks and continued
until 1978 with the discovery of
"parity violation," is long gone.
For more than a decade, SLAC
physicists have been performing
what is termed "bread-and
butter" physics. Although this
kind of physics is essential to fill
in small gaps in a physicist's un
derstanding of the universe, it
doesn't win Nobel prizes.
Furthermore, SLAC received a
blow last summer when
problems arose with the SLC proj
ect and physicists had to shut the
machine down for nine months
for repairs. Although the SLC is
going to renew testing at the end
of this week, actual experiments
will not begin until next month
at the earliest.

The SLC is designed to find the
Z particle, which is involved with
the "weak" nuclear force. Failure
to find Z particles this summer
brought SLAC bad press coverage,
and other physicists criticized the
bold design of the SLC for being
too difficult.
Already discovered in 1983 at
the European Center for Nuclear
Research in Geneva, the Z particle
was only part of what SLAC
physicists wanted to find; they
also hoped to learn more about
the "weak" nuclear force associ
ated with the Z particle.
Better klystrons needed
To meet its high energy
demand, the NLC will need to
design better klystrons, which are
the power source for the present
and proposed machines. Klystrons
along the entire length of the pres
ent three-kilometer-long ac
celerator, 240 in all, provide
bursts of radiation that "push"

the particles along their paths.
Better klystron design is the
most critical, challenging feature
of the planned collider, according
to SLAC theoretical physicist Bob
Palmer.
One potential solution touted by
some at SLAC is the so-called
"relativistic klystrons" that are
being built at the Lawrence Liver
more National Laboratory. In Pal
mer's judgment, though, the
Livermore technology is prohibi
tively expensive. "I've dismissed
[the relativistic klystron] as a
hopeless case," Palmer said.
Other technological difficulties
Another major obstacle is to
focus the beams to the desired
narrow width. The smaller the
required beam width, the more
difficult the physics, and SLAC
physicists are now trying to devise
a method for focusing the beams
to only five-billionths of a meter
in width, or just five-thousandths
the width of the human hair. At
present, SLC scientists are strug
gling to create beams that are 10
times that size.
Even if physicists manage to
narrow the beam to the desired
width, they aren't sure they can
measure the width of the beam
once they get it that small. The
problem is "not only to make
them, but to know that you made
them," Burke said.

Besides narrowing the beams,
physicists must also aim them
with incredible accuracy. Over the
eight-kilometer length of the ac
celerator, the beam cannot stray
more than ten-millionths of a me
ter from its course. The alignment
must be 15 times more accurate
than the SLC's alignment.
In addition to the large prob
lems, according to Palmer, an
enormous number of small details
for the planned collider need to
be worked out, but none of them
should be too difficult.
"Theoretical studies say it is all
possible," said Palmer, the
theoretician. But he added that
the machine's engineering might
be prohibitively expensive.
SLAC physicists freely admit
the SLC's troubles, which raise
the question of why another, more
expensive electron-positron ma
chine should be built.
To study some of the technical
questions posed by the NLC,
SLAC will ask the Energy Depart
ment to finance a new research
program costing between $10 mil
lion and $100 million, according
to Burke. SLAC officials want to
make the proposal sometime this
spring, Burke said.
According to Riordan, Richter
pushed for the research and de
velopment program at this week's
meeting of high-energy physicists
in Washington, D.C.
Although a costly new linear
collider at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center flopped last sum

The SLC accelerates electrons

cutting edge of particle physics
research sometime in the begin
ning of the next century.
Since about 1978, however,
SLAC has remained relatively
quiet. The center's heydey, which
began in the late 1960s with the
discovery of quarks and continued
until 1978 with the discovery of
"parity violation," is long gone.
For more than a decade, SLAC
physicists have been performing
what is termed "bread-and
butter" physics. Although this
kind of physics is essential to fill
in small gaps in a physicist's un
derstanding of the universe, it
doesn't win Nobel prizes.
Furthermore, SLAC received a
blow last summer when
problems arose with the SLC proj
ect and physicists had to shut the
machine down for nine months
for repairs. Although the SLC is
going to renew testing at the end
of this week, actual experiments
will not begin until next month
at the earliest.

The SLC is designed to find the
Z particle, which is involved with
the "weak" nuclear force. Failure
to find Z particles this summer
brought SLAC bad press coverage,
and other physicists criticized the
bold design of the SLC for being
too difficult.
Already discovered in 1983 at
the European Center for Nuclear
Research in Geneva, the Z particle
was only part of what SLAC
physicists wanted to find; they
also hoped to learn more about
the "weak" nuclear force associ
ated with the Z particle.
Better klystrons needed
To meet its high energy
demand, the NLC will need to
design better klystrons, which are
the power source for the present
and proposed machines. Klystrons
along the entire length of the pres
ent three-kilometer-long ac
celerator, 240 in all, provide
bursts of radiation that "push"

the particles along their paths.
Better klystron design is the
most critical, challenging feature
of the planned collider, according
to SLAC theoretical physicist Bob
Palmer.
One potential solution touted by
some at SLAC is the so-called
"relativistic klystrons" that are
being built at the Lawrence Liver
more National Laboratory. In Pal
mer's judgment, though, the
Livermore technology is prohibi
tively expensive. "I've dismissed
[the relativistic klystron] as a
hopeless case," Palmer said.
Other technological difficulties
Another major obstacle is to
focus the beams to the desired
narrow width. The smaller the
required beam width, the more
difficult the physics, and SLAC
physicists are now trying to devise
a method for focusing the beams
to only five-billionths of a meter
in width, or just five-thousandths
the width of the human hair. At
present, SLC scientists are strug
gling to create beams that are 10
times that size.
Even if physicists manage to
narrow the beam to the desired
width, they aren't sure they can
measure the width of the beam
once they get it that small. The
problem is "not only to make
them, but to know that you made
them," Burke said.

Besides narrowing the beams,
physicists must also aim them
with incredible accuracy. Over the
eight-kilometer length of the ac
celerator, the beam cannot stray
more than ten-millionths of a me
ter from its course. The alignment
must be 15 times more accurate
than the SLC's alignment.
In addition to the large prob
lems, according to Palmer, an
enormous number of small details
for the planned collider need to
be worked out, but none of them
should be too difficult.
"Theoretical studies say it is all
possible," said Palmer, the
theoretician. But he added that
the machine's engineering might
be prohibitively expensive.
SLAC physicists freely admit
the SLC's troubles, which raise
the question of why another, more
expensive electron-positron ma
chine should be built.
To study some of the technical
questions posed by the NLC,
SLAC will ask the Energy Depart
ment to finance a new research
program costing between $10 mil
lion and $100 million, according
to Burke. SLAC officials want to
make the proposal sometime this
spring, Burke said.
According to Riordan, Richter
pushed for the research and de
velopment program at this week's
meeting of high-energy physicists
in Washington, D.C.
Although a costly new linear
collider at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center flopped last sum
mer, SLAC physicists are already
designing a bigger — and
presumably better — particle col
lider that probably would cost the
federal government more than $1
billion.
"It's a fairly exotic machine,"
said SLAC Prof. David Burke, one
of the physicists designing the
second-generation collider. The
planned collider, dubbed the Next
Linear Collider, is still on the
drawing table, and SLAC has not
yet asked the Department of En
ergy for funding.
The Stanford Linear Collider,
which was designed to find the
much sought-after Z particle, was
shut down this summer because
of several technical problems. The
$115 million SLC will continue
operation next month, but the
costly delays have been a imyor
embarrassment for SLAC.
The new machine — which will
be the second largest particle ac
celerator in the world — will be

used to further probe the physics
of the Standard Model, the theo
retical structure that physicists
have created and been using over
the last two decades to explain
the myriad of particles physicists
have found in their enormous par
ticle accelerators. The Standard
Model helps physicists under
stand what happened in the early
universe, a tiny fraction of a sec
ond after the Big Bang.
SLAC officials hope to start
building this eight kilometer-long
giant in 1998, after federal fund
ing for a $4.4 Superconducting
Super Collider winds down. The
Super Collider, a circular ac
celerator 53 miles in circum
ference destined for Texas, is
scheduled to be completed by 1998
if the project is ever funded.
SLAC's new collider will be the
largest research facility in the
world after the Super Collider if
they are both built. The machine
is to be built deep underground,
at an unspecified place on Stan
ford land. If built, the NLC will
be independent of the Stanford
accelerator now in existence.
SLAC will probably not propose
that the Department of Energy

fund the project until about 1993,
Burke said.
"It really depends on how the
research goes (over the next few
years)," SLAC spokesperson Mi
chael Riordan said.
The project would almost cer
tainly be an international col
laboration, involving the
Japanese, the Europeans and the
Soviets, Burke said.
Two accelerators proposed
The collider being evaluated
consists of two four-kilometer
long linear accelerators facing
each other. The machine will
smash together electrons ac
celerated down one of these dis
tances and positrons accelerated
down the other.
The NLC will probably ac
celerate particles to energies of 2
trillion electron volts, Burke said.
The SLC uses just one-twentieth
of this energy to collide electrons
and positrons together.
But the Super Collider — if
funded — will operate years
before the NLC is to be ready,
and at energies fully 20 times

on the efficiency of electron

for the disadvantage of lower
energies in the NLC.
SlI\C Director Burton Richter,
a Nobel laureate, disclosed the
planned collider to physicists this
week at a meeting of the High
Energy Program Advisory Panel
in Washington, D.C. Richter could
not be reached for comment.
In over 20 years at SLAC, Rich
ter has assembled an impressive
array of machinery. The linear ac
celerator at SLAC is the longest
and most powerful of its kind in
the world.
Also, since 1983, Richter has
overseen the construction of the
SLC, which uses a unique design
to collide beams of electrons and
positrons — positively charged

cousins of electrons — at tremen
dously high energies. The SLC is
slated to renew operation next
month, after a series of disap

lems, according to Palmer, an
enormous number of small details
for the planned collider need to
be worked out, but none of them
should be too difficult.
"Theoretical studies say it is all
possible," said Palmer, the
theoretician. But he added that
the machine's engineering might
be prohibitively expensive.
SLAC physicists freely admit
the SLC's troubles, which raise
the question of why another, more
expensive electron-positron ma
chine should be built.
To study some of the technical
questions posed by the NLC,
SLAC will ask the Energy Depart
ment to finance a new research
program costing between $10 mil
lion and $100 million, according
to Burke. SLAC officials want to
make the proposal sometime this
spring, Burke said.
According to Riordan, Richter
pushed for the research and de
velopment program at this week's
meeting of high-energy physicists
in Washington, D.C.
Although a costly new linear
collider at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center flopped last sum
mer, SLAC physicists are already
designing a bigger — and
presumably better — particle col
lider that probably would cost the
federal government more than $1
billion.
"It's a fairly exotic machine,"
said SLAC Prof. David Burke, one
of the physicists designing the
second-generation collider. The
planned collider, dubbed the Next
Linear Collider, is still on the
drawing table, and SLAC has not
yet asked the Department of En
ergy for funding.
The Stanford Linear Collider,
which was designed to find the
much sought-after Z particle, was
shut down this summer because
of several technical problems. The
$115 million SLC will continue
operation next month, but the
costly delays have been a imyor
embarrassment for SLAC.
The new machine — which will
be the second largest particle ac
celerator in the world — will be

used to further probe the physics
of the Standard Model, the theo
retical structure that physicists
have created and been using over
the last two decades to explain
the myriad of particles physicists
have found in their enormous par
ticle accelerators. The Standard
Model helps physicists under
stand what happened in the early
universe, a tiny fraction of a sec
ond after the Big Bang.
SLAC officials hope to start
building this eight kilometer-long
giant in 1998, after federal fund
ing for a $4.4 Superconducting
Super Collider winds down. The
Super Collider, a circular ac
celerator 53 miles in circum
ference destined for Texas, is
scheduled to be completed by 1998
if the project is ever funded.
SLAC's new collider will be the
largest research facility in the
world after the Super Collider if
they are both built. The machine
is to be built deep underground,
at an unspecified place on Stan
ford land. If built, the NLC will
be independent of the Stanford
accelerator now in existence.
SLAC will probably not propose
that the Department of Energy

fund the project until about 1993,
Burke said.
"It really depends on how the
research goes (over the next few
years)," SLAC spokesperson Mi
chael Riordan said.
The project would almost cer
tainly be an international col
laboration, involving the
Japanese, the Europeans and the
Soviets, Burke said.
Two accelerators proposed
The collider being evaluated
consists of two four-kilometer
long linear accelerators facing
each other. The machine will
smash together electrons ac
celerated down one of these dis
tances and positrons accelerated
down the other.
The NLC will probably ac
celerate particles to energies of 2
trillion electron volts, Burke said.
The SLC uses just one-twentieth
of this energy to collide electrons
and positrons together.
But the Super Collider — if
funded — will operate years
before the NLC is to be ready,
and at energies fully 20 times

higher than the NLC could
achieve. Physicists are counting
on the efficiency of electron
positron collisions to accomodate
for the disadvantage of lower
energies in the NLC.
SlI\C Director Burton Richter,
a Nobel laureate, disclosed the
planned collider to physicists this
week at a meeting of the High
Energy Program Advisory Panel
in Washington, D.C. Richter could
not be reached for comment.
In over 20 years at SLAC, Rich
ter has assembled an impressive
array of machinery. The linear ac
celerator at SLAC is the longest
and most powerful of its kind in
the world.
Also, since 1983, Richter has
overseen the construction of the
SLC, which uses a unique design
to collide beams of electrons and
positrons — positively charged

cousins of electrons — at tremen
dously high energies. The SLC is
slated to renew operation next
month, after a series of disap
pointing trial runs last summer.
The NLC is actually an exten
sion of the technology of the SLC,
which has had severe problems in
the last year focusing the particle
beams. In fact, the primary pur
pose of the SLC was to serve as
a prototype for other electron
positron colliders.
The SLC accelerates electrons
and positrons around a ring in
opposing arcs so they eventually
collide. Using a three-kilometer
long linear accelerator to boost
electrons and positrons along arcs
before they collide, the NLC will
accelerate electrons and positrons
in straight lines directly at one
another.
The cutting edge

for the NLC project, the labora
tory might once again be at the

Collider must be focused to a distance

cutting edge of particle physics
research sometime in the begin
ning of the next century.
Since about 1978, however,
SLAC has remained relatively
quiet. The center's heydey, which
began in the late 1960s with the
discovery of quarks and continued
until 1978 with the discovery of
"parity violation," is long gone.
For more than a decade, SLAC
physicists have been performing
what is termed "bread-and
butter" physics. Although this
kind of physics is essential to fill
in small gaps in a physicist's un
derstanding of the universe, it
doesn't win Nobel prizes.
Furthermore, SLAC received a
blow last summer when
problems arose with the SLC proj
ect and physicists had to shut the
machine down for nine months
for repairs. Although the SLC is
going to renew testing at the end
of this week, actual experiments
will not begin until next month
at the earliest.

The SLC is designed to find the
Z particle, which is involved with
the "weak" nuclear force. Failure
to find Z particles this summer
brought SLAC bad press coverage,
and other physicists criticized the
bold design of the SLC for being
too difficult.
Already discovered in 1983 at
the European Center for Nuclear
Research in Geneva, the Z particle
was only part of what SLAC
physicists wanted to find; they
also hoped to learn more about
the "weak" nuclear force associ
ated with the Z particle.
Better klystrons needed
To meet its high energy
demand, the NLC will need to
design better klystrons, which are
the power source for the present
and proposed machines. Klystrons
along the entire length of the pres
ent three-kilometer-long ac
celerator, 240 in all, provide
bursts of radiation that "push"

the particles along their paths.
Better klystron design is the
most critical, challenging feature
of the planned collider, according
to SLAC theoretical physicist Bob
Palmer.
One potential solution touted by
some at SLAC is the so-called
"relativistic klystrons" that are
being built at the Lawrence Liver
more National Laboratory. In Pal
mer's judgment, though, the
Livermore technology is prohibi
tively expensive. "I've dismissed
[the relativistic klystron] as a
hopeless case," Palmer said.
Other technological difficulties
Another major obstacle is to
focus the beams to the desired
narrow width. The smaller the
required beam width, the more
difficult the physics, and SLAC
physicists are now trying to devise
a method for focusing the beams
to only five-billionths of a meter
in width, or just five-thousandths
the width of the human hair. At
present, SLC scientists are strug
gling to create beams that are 10
times that size.
Even if physicists manage to
narrow the beam to the desired
width, they aren't sure they can
measure the width of the beam
once they get it that small. The
problem is "not only to make
them, but to know that you made
them," Burke said.

Besides narrowing the beams,
physicists must also aim them
with incredible accuracy. Over the
eight-kilometer length of the ac
celerator, the beam cannot stray
more than ten-millionths of a me
ter from its course. The alignment
must be 15 times more accurate
than the SLC's alignment.
In addition to the large prob
lems, according to Palmer, an
enormous number of small details
for the planned collider need to
be worked out, but none of them
should be too difficult.
"Theoretical studies say it is all
possible," said Palmer, the
theoretician. But he added that
the machine's engineering might
be prohibitively expensive.
SLAC physicists freely admit
the SLC's troubles, which raise
the question of why another, more
expensive electron-positron ma
chine should be built.
To study some of the technical
questions posed by the NLC,
SLAC will ask the Energy Depart
ment to finance a new research
program costing between $10 mil
lion and $100 million, according
to Burke. SLAC officials want to
make the proposal sometime this
spring, Burke said.
According to Riordan, Richter
pushed for the research and de
velopment program at this week's
meeting of high-energy physicists
in Washington, D.C.
