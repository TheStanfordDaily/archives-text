## Congress says no to pay raise 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Congress voted overwhelmingly
yesterday to turn down its 51 per
cent pay raise and rushed the leg
islation to President Bush, who
signed it hours before a midnight
deadline.
Lawmakers were anxious to end
the public outcry against the
$45,500 increase, which left them
feeling, in the words of one rep
resentative, like "cannon fodder
for trash television and talk
radio."
First, the House voted to reject
the raise by a vote of 380-48. Less
than three hours later, the Senate
followed suit by a vote of 94-6.
The raise would have become
law at midnight without Bush's
signature on the resolution reject
ing it. Bush had supported the
raise but went along with
Congress, signing the measure
hours after the congressional
votes.
The votes also denied large
raises for top federal executives
and federal judges. The Constitu
tion forbids judicial raises from
being scaled back once they have
taken effect.
Bush had supported the pay
raise and said in a statement yes
terday night that "I believe some
level of pay increase is in order
and I will be working with the
House and Senate leadership to
develop proposals to achieve that
end." He cited a "special concern"
about judges' pay.
Some lawmakers predicted that
defeating the raises would ac
celerate an exodus of judges and
federal managers from govern
ment service.
Indeed, Chief Justice William
Rehnquist said in a statement:
"I deeply regret the congres
sional action, which has prevented
the federal judges in this country
from receiving a well-deserved pay
raise. We will not be able to attract
and retain the kind of judges we
need unless we pay our judges
fairly and equitably."
Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan., said Bush told Sen
ate Republicans yesterday he
might ask Congress to approve

lesser raises for the judges and
executives.
With its votes, Congress
rejected raises proposed by a pres
idential commission and endorsed
by then-President Reagan.
Senators and representatives
would have seen their salaries rise
from $89,500 to $135,000.
During its less than 30 minutes
of debate, the Senate heard Jesse
Helms, R-N.C. and a foe of the
raise, proclaim that the vote
shows the American people that
"you can fight city hall and you
can take on the Congress of the
United States with all its leger
demain and all its legislative abil
ity."
The Senate last week voted 95-5
against the raise, but the wording
of that resolution differed from
the House version approved Tues
day. Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt.,
who had voted against the raise,
voted for it yesterday.
Jeffords said he cast his vote
yesterday to make clear his view
that judges are badly in need of
a pay raise and because, unlike
last week's measure, this one did
not curtail lawmakers' rights to
make speeches for fees.
The other senators voting to
sustain the raise were Democrats
Christopher Dodd of Connecticut,
Edward Kennedy of Massachu
setts and Spark Matsunaga of
Hawaii; and Republicans Frank
Murkowski of Alaska and Ted
Stevens of Alaska.
Despite the overwhelming
House margin, members were
clearly torn between their desire
for a pay raise and the public
scorn heaped upon them for con
sidering the increase.
The chamber applauded loudly
when Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D
-111., told colleagues in a rousing
speech before the vote, "Each
member of this House, Democrat
and Republican, is worth a salary
of $135,000 a year."
The irony of the House's di
lemma was reflected when Rep.
Vic Fazio, D-Calif., a pay raise
defender, introduced the resolu
tion to reject the increase — but
voted against the resolution.
