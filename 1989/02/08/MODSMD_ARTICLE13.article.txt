### 
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel
yesterday defended its treatment
of Palestinians in the face of a
U.S. report that criticized Israel
for "many avoidable deaths and
injuries" during the Palestinian
uprising in the occupied lands.
Yossi Ahimeir, press represen
tative for Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, said, "We are doing our
utmost to prevent unnecessary
suffering and bloodshed."
Palestinian leaders welcomed
the report by the State Depart
ment as a sign of a more realistic
U.S. approach to the Palestinian
problem.
Since the revolt began 14
months ago, 374 Palestinians
have been killed and thousands
wounded, most by army gunfire.
Deputy Foreign Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu said on Is
rael Television that troops "main
tain as best they can, apart from
a few exceptions, the standards
of proper conduct that no country
in the world could maintain."
The television quoted the
army's chief prosecutor, Brig.
Gen. Amnon Strashnov, as ter
ming the report "exaggerated and
unjust."
In a separate statement, Strash
nov defended the legality of Israeli
operations, saying Palestinian
prisoners were given due process
of law.
Ahimeir told The Associated

Press: "We are already used to
these accusations. We try to
defend our security and some
times people lose their lives. We
hope the moment the uprising
comes to an end life will return
to normal."
Palestinian Feisal Husseini, a
leading pro-PLO activist who was
recently released from jail after
spending most of the uprising un
der administrative detention, said,
"I believe this report will help in
creating an understanding be
tween Palestinians and Americans
and I hope it is a sign of a new
U.S. policy."
Hanna Siniora, editor of the
East Jerusalem daily Al-Fsyr, said,
"I don't think you can put on
paper the suffering of the Pales
tinian people and the human
rights violations that have taken
place in the last 14 months. But
it is a realistic report and we com
pliment the State Department for
taking such an attitude."
Israel's swift reaction, coming
even before the State Department
officially released its report, indi
cated Jerusalem was concerned
the findings may figure in U.S.
policy toward Israel. The Jewish
state receives $3 billion a year in
U.S. military and economic aid.
Palestinians began the uprising
in December 1987 to protest Is
raeli rule of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
