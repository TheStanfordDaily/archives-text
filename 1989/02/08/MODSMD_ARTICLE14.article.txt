# Housing segregation lives, says study

CHICAGO (AP) â€” Regardless of income
and education, blacks can't find housing in
integrated neighborhoods, challenging the
American dream of "working one's way up"
in society, the authors of a study said.
Hispanics and Asians, on the other hand,
move easily into the U.S. mainstream as they
get more schooling, better jobs and higher
income, according to University of Chicago
researchers whose study of 20 metropolitan
areas is published in tomorrow's edition of
Social Science Quarterly.
An Asian or Hispanic who has completed
the third grade is more likely to live in an
integrated neighborhood than a black with a
doctorate, the researchers said.
And an Asian or Hispanic who makes less

than $2,500 has a higher chance of living in
an integrated neighborhood than a black who
earns more than $50,000, they found.
"For blacks of all social backgrounds, inte
gration remains an elusive goal," they said.
The study, based on the 1980 U.S. census,
is the first national one to compare segrega
tion patterns for three minority groups on
the basis of education, income and occupation,
said Nancy Denton, a demographer who
worked on the study with sociology professor
Douglas Massey.
"The implications of these findings for
blacks are troublesome, given the civil rights
legislation of recent decades," said Denton.
"The American dream of 'working one's
way up' is not a viable option for blacks in

the United States, at least in terms of resi
dence. And other work that we have done
suggests that separate is not equal when it
comes to living conditions," she said.
Denton said middle-class blacks are forced
to live in neighborhoods of much poorer
quality than whites with similar class back
grounds.
"No matter what their education or occupa
tional achievements, and whatever their in
comes, blacks are exposed to higher crime
rates, less effective educational systems,
higher mortality risks, more dilapidated sur
roundings and a poorer socioeconomic envi
ronment than whites, simply because of the
persistence of strong barriers to residential
integration," Denton said.
