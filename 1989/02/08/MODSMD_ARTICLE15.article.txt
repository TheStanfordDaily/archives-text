# L.A. bans assault weapons
## Council, gun owners clash over semiautomatic guns 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - The
City Council voted unanimously
yesterday to ban sales and pos
session of semiautomatic weapons
such as the AK-47 rifle used to
kill five schoolchildren in Stockton
last month.
Holding aloft an Uzi rifle, Coun
cilman Zev Yaroslavsky said,
"There is absolutely no reason
why anyone should own one of
these. We are talking about offen
sive weapons of war."
After a noisy hour-long discus
sion by council members and the
public, many of the gun owners
who opposed the measure, the
council voted 12-0 for the ban.
Violators of the ordinance will
face up to six months in jail and
a fine of up to $1,000. The or

dinance applies to any semi
automatic rifle that holds 20 or
more rounds or a semiautomatic
shotgun that can be fired more
than six times.
The measure was effective im
mediately. Owners of such guns
have 15 days to get rid of the
firearms or make them in
operable.
Mayor Tom Bradley, calling the
weapons "tools of murder and
mayhem whose sole purpose is kil
ling human beings," promptly
signed the measure into law.
More than 100 people opposing
the ordinance booed those speak
ing in favor of it, forcing Coun
cilman Marvin Braude to demand
quiet in council chambers several
times.

Robert Cleaves of Los Angeles
said violent crime will not be
stopped by banning military look
alike weapons, while citizen
Robert Kahn contended the law
would target law-abiding citizens
instead of criminals.
Some questioned the con
stitutionality of the law. But City
Attorney James Hahn said he
believed it was constitutional, say
ing it was "insane to have ever
allowed these weapons to have
been sold."
Yaroslavsky, the sponsor of the
ordinance, said he believed that
Los Angeles would be only one of
many cities in the area to ban
semiautomatic AK-475, Uzis and
similar weapons.
