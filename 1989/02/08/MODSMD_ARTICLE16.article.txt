Ex-lover berates Hudson in suit
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Actor Rock Hudson
was guilty of immoral and indecent behavior for
failing to tell his homosexual companion that he
had AIDS, an attorney told the jury in closing
arguments of a $11 million lawsuit against the
Hudson estate.
Harold Rhoden, who represents Hudson's
former consort, Marc Christian, said yesterday
the movie star placed not only Christian in danger
but also anyone who had sexual relations with
Christian in the future.
"Hudson did not give a damn about Christian
or the countless other people who could have
died," Rhoden said.
"The duty to warn is what this case is all
about. Someone who has AIDS has that duty.
It's right. It is decent. It is moral," Rhoden said.
"To do what Rock Hudson and Mark Miller (his
secretary) did is immoral, is indecent."
Rhoden contends that Christian, 35, an aspiring

musician who lived with Hudson in the last two
years of his life, is entitled to compensation for
the "enhanced fear" which he suffered when he
found out that his lover had AIDS.
U.S. man guilty again in bombing
MONTREAL (AP) — A Rochester, N.Y., man
was found guilty of three counts of first-degree
murder for the 1984 Labor Day bombing of a
train station that killed three people and injured
47 others.
The 12-member jury convicted Thomas Brig
ham, a 69-vear-old drifter with a history of mental
problems, in a retrial ordered after his 1985
conviction was thrown out last June.
Brigham smiled, stood and leaned against the
prisoner's box before giving a five-minute speech
to the court after the verdict was announced.
"I appreciate the great difficulty it has been
for the jury, court, police and the media to un
derstand what happened," Brigham said.
