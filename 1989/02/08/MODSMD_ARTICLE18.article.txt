## The

WHEN A COLLEGE hires
a new football coach,
most of its fans resign
themselves to a rebuilding —
read "losing" — season or two.
After all, none of the returning
players knows the new boss,
having been recruited and trained
by the old one. These upperclass
players also may not know the
assistants he brings along.
But the most daunting obstacle
a new coach typically faces is
recruiting. Top prep prospects,
wooed by dozens of other schools
that didn't just replace the head
coach, would rather join a
dynasty than rebuild one.
- The newly-hired leader who
can overcome both obstacles is a
rare commodity indeed.
Such a man is Dennis Green.
"There's not too much looking
back right now, but a whole lot
of looking ahead," commented
senior noseguard Buck Rog

geman. "Coach Green is very en
ergetic, very get-down-to
business, and the whole team's
starting to catch fire."
And instead of a forgivably aw
ful initial recruiting year, Green
has had one of the best.
Stanford needed offensive line
power. Green targeted it and,
with a lot of help from his players
and the Athletic Department, got
the nation's best offensive
lineman, 6-foot-6, 280-pound
guard Bob Whitfield. When
former head coach Jack Elway
was dismissed, WTiitfield nearly
wrote Stanford off.
Green changed Whitfield's
mind. Far from being the sole
standout in a meager group,
WTiitfield is but one of several
furiously-recruited prep players
— top backs, linemen and
receivers — scheduled to sign let
ters of intent today for Stanford.
