# Cat predicament
## 
### 
Trapping the campus'
1,500 or so wild cats may
seem a cold-hearted move
by the University. But the deci
sion makes humane sense not
only for Stanford residents, but
also for the cats.
Starting Feb. 27, Crane Pest
Control will begin rounding up
felines roaming the area.
Trapped cats will then be taken
to the Santa Clara County Ani
mal Control Center for possible
adoption. But since most of the
animals are feral, most will likely
be put to sleep.
The University's compromise
solution, though it may seem
cruel in the short run, prevents
long-term problems. Each sum

mer the cat population has ex
ploded due to the spring arrival
of kittens. And every year,
pitying community members
have helped feed the newcomers
and their parents.
But the problem has gotten out
of hand. Many of these animals
cannot survive on sporadic com
munity handouts and conse
quently die of hunger or disease.
Wild cats that do make it often
carry fleas and disease and hence
pose a health hazard to the com
munity's human population, as
well as its tame animal popula
tion.
However, the stray cats should
be treated like any other feral
animals.
