# Campbell sides with 'nays' on pay raise vote

### Nathanael Cousins Staff writer 
U.S. Rep. Tom Campbell, representing the 12th
District since the his election in November, joined
a host of others yesterday in voting down a 51
percent pay raise for members of Congress, the vice
president, judges, cabinet secretaries and other ex
ecutive posts.
The proposed federal pay raise struck a flame of
public opposition and resulted in a 380-48 Congres
sional defeat.
Campbell, a Republican, is on leave from his
position as a professor at the Law School. He was
on the House floor yesterday afternoon and was
unavailable for comment.
But Campbell's chief of staff said that the "no"
vote pleased the representative. "We are thrilled, it
was fantastic," said Karin Miranda, speaking from
Washington, D.C. "The vote shows how much impact
the public can have. Tom Campbell has been opposed
to the pay raise since day one."
With a Ph.D. in economics, Campbell concentrated
largely on financial issues â€” including the national
budget and the trade deficit in his battle against
Democratic candidate Anna Eshoo for a Congres
sional seat. During the election season, Campbell
called for across-the-board cuts in government
spending.
On Monday, Campbell went on record that he
would return the higher pay to the federal govern
ment if the pay raise were approved, and challenged
other politicians to do the same. In opposition to
the raise, Campbell wrote that members of Congress
would have a difficult time saying no to other
needed budget items when they had said yes to
themselves.
The Peninsula's other congressional members,
Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Burlingame and Rep. Norm
Mineta, D-San Jose, also voted to strike down the
pay hike.
A Gallup poll conducted in January showed that
nationwide, 82 percent were opposed to the raise,
while 15 percent were in favor. College graduates
were the most likely to support the raise, with 32
percent in favor and 66 percent opposed.
However, when the same poll asked people if they
knew how much U.S senators and representatives
were paid, 48 percent admitted they did not.
In a similar poll last year which asked people to
rate the "honesty and ethical standards" of members
of Congress, only 16 percent gave them a high or
very high ranking.
"Constituents should know what their represen
tatives are doing," said Miranda. "Tom Campbell's
