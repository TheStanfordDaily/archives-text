# Campbell sides with 'nays' on pay raise vote
## 
### Nathanael Cousins Staff writer 
U.S. Rep. Tom Campbell, representing the 12th
District since the his election in November, joined
a host of others yesterday in voting down a 51
percent pay raise for members of Congress, the vice
president, judges, cabinet secretaries and other ex
ecutive posts.
The proposed federal pay raise struck a flame of
public opposition and resulted in a 380-48 Congres
sional defeat.
Campbell, a Republican, is on leave from his
position as a professor at the Law School. He was
on the House floor yesterday afternoon and was
unavailable for comment.
But Campbell's chief of staff said that the "no"
vote pleased the representative. "We are thrilled, it
was fantastic," said Karin Miranda, speaking from
Washington, D.C. "The vote shows how much impact
the public can have. Tom Campbell has been opposed
to the pay raise since day one."
With a Ph.D. in economics, Campbell concentrated
largely on financial issues — including the national
budget and the trade deficit in his battle against
Democratic candidate Anna Eshoo for a Congres
sional seat. During the election season, Campbell
called for across-the-board cuts in government
spending.
On Monday, Campbell went on record that he
would return the higher pay to the federal govern
ment if the pay raise were approved, and challenged
other politicians to do the same. In opposition to
the raise, Campbell wrote that members of Congress
would have a difficult time saying no to other
needed budget items when they had said yes to
themselves.
The Peninsula's other congressional members,
Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Burlingame and Rep. Norm
Mineta, D-San Jose, also voted to strike down the
pay hike.
A Gallup poll conducted in January showed that
nationwide, 82 percent were opposed to the raise,
while 15 percent were in favor. College graduates
were the most likely to support the raise, with 32
percent in favor and 66 percent opposed.
However, when the same poll asked people if they
knew how much U.S senators and representatives
were paid, 48 percent admitted they did not.
In a similar poll last year which asked people to
rate the "honesty and ethical standards" of members
of Congress, only 16 percent gave them a high or
very high ranking.
"Constituents should know what their represen
tatives are doing," said Miranda. "Tom Campbell's
philosophy is that if you're op
posed to the pay raise, you should
stay opposed. Now is not the time
to institute a pay raise," she
added.
A trade-off for the raise, which
was included in the bill, would
have been an end to paid
honorariums for members of
Congress. Honorariums for
speeches and appearances can
amount to substantial bonus pay
for some politicians: up to $26,850
for representatives and $35,800
for senators.
According to Miranda, Camp
bell does not accept honorariums.
The pay raise, which was re
commended by a non-partisan,
blue-ribbon panel and supported
by President George Bush and
former President Ronald Reagan,

would have automatically gone
into effect today had Congress not
balked and brought it to a vote.
But after closed-door man
euverings and overwhelming
public opinion on the eve of the
raise, the House brought out the
bill from the back burner and put
it to a real vote. The Senate moved
in opposition to the raise last
Thursday by a 95-5 margin.
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-
Texas, took much of the heat for
the proposed raise and his posi
tion on Capitol Hill has been
severely weakened by the defeat
of the proposal. In an attempt at
compromise, Wright earlier this
week proposed that the raise be
passed and then reduced to 30
percent for the elected positions.
However, Wright's compromise
was rejected 238-88 in the House
and the entire pay-raise proposal
was resoundingly defeated yester
day.
