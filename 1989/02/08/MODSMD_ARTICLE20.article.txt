## Synergy offers environmentally conscious living 
### 
AN ARTICLE in the Feb. 1 Daily
on the proposed environmental
focus house gave the impression
that this house would, if approved, be
the only house concerned with environ
mental awareness.
Several of the co-ops on campus,
most notably Synergy House, have
been involved in environmental activi
ties for quite some time and emphasize
environmental awareness, even though
this is not an "official" theme of these
houses and prospective residents are
not required to demonstrate environ
mental interest.
In the years since Synergy started in
1972, residents have worked on such
projects as installing solar collectors,
designing a gray water system to
re-use laundry water, creating an
organic, biodynamic garden and imple

menting a composting system to recycle
food scraps back into the garden.
Because house residents control their
food ordering, much of the food is
purchased with environmental consider
ations in mind, as evidenced by the
house's decision not to buy foods with
negative impact on the environment,
such as red meat, grapes and tuna.
House residents were also active in
starting the Recycling Center and
continue to play an active part in it.
Several environmentally-related
SWOPSI classes have been held at the
house in the last few years alone,
including "The Living Environment:
Ethical Perspectives" (taught by two
house residents, one of whom co
directed this year's "You Can Make a
Difference" conference) and "Sus
tainable Agriculture" (which used

Synergy's garden as a working base).
Last year, an environmentalist
lawyer, an environmentalist journalist
and the founder of a socially and
environmentally conscious investment
firm spoke at the house, and a
speakers series linking food consump
tion and production to environmental
issues is planned for this year.
The house's "Alternative Periodicals
Library" contains more than 30 differ
ent environmental titles, in addition to
over 100 environmental books.
Another co-op, Columbae House, has
also started a garden and a food con
sumption system and generally pur
chases food with environmental consid
erations in mind.
If approved, the environmental focus
house may not be run as a co-op.
When people accept responsibility for

such things as cooking, cleaning and
purchasing the food for their own
house, they are that much closer to
having a direct impact, whether posi
tive or negative, on the environment.
The house as we understand it, will
probably not be geared as much
towards an environmentally aware
lifestyle; rather it will be more focused
on a discussion of environmental is
sues.
We hope that students using both
approaches can work together to in
crease environmental awareness and
work towards a future where people
will want to live an environmentally
sound lifestyle, instead of viewing it as
only an academic interest.
