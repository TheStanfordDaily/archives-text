# Housed fraternities not 'drinking clubs'
## 
### 
As a member of a housed fraternity,
I take great offense to Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons' comment, quoted
in a Feb. 7 article, that housed frater
nities have a "reputation as drinking
clubs."
Not only is this comment completely
unsubstantiated, but it also reflects the
same close-mindedness and stereotyp
ing that the University is currently
trying to fight.
I have not found my house this year
to be any more of a "drinking club"
than my freshman dorm was. In fact,
given our residents' older age and
maturity, I feel that alcohol is used in
a much more responsible manner here
than in my dorm last year.
Any abuse of alcohol which might

exist is actively fought by house staff
and programming. Our fraternity ex
perience involves infinitely more than
the drinking Lyons imagines.
It is ironic that in an issue of The
Daily which devoted so much space to
discussing the topics of sexism and
racism, Dean Lyons made a comment
like that which runs directly along the
same lines of ignorance and prejudice.
I hope he realizes his mistake and
apologizes to the entire Greek commu
nity.
