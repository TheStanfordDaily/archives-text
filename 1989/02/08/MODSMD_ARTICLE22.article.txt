# Open dialogue on fraternities needed
## 
### 
There is a question which is not
addressed openly enough on campus,
but which the University administra
tion, it seems, has already answered.

I have suspected for some time that
the University would like to abolish
fraternities on campus, and its actions
over the past year or so have made me
believe this all the more.
I write not to defend the fraternities
but to ask the administration to play
fair with the Stanford community.
Instead of using "disciplinary" prob
lems to conceal a long-range plan, the
administration should place the real
question — should we abolish fraterni
ties? — squarely before the students
and faculty of Stanford.
I have considered the question, and
my answer is that fraternities should
go.
No matter how "nice" the members
may be, these fundamentally sexist (no
women) and elitist (self-selecting) insti
tutions are completely antithetical to
the ideals of the educational program
Stanford claims to be offering, both in
the classroom and through Residential
Education.

Furthermore, many of the fraterni
ties have well above-average houses in
some of the most convenient spots on
campus. And yet women, who pay the
same tuition as men, cannot move into
these houses. This is not right.
Let us begin a true dialogue, both
among the students and between the
students and the administration.
