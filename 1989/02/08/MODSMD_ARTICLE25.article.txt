## Meditations on the can 
### 
IMAGINE THAT you're walking along
a street — let's say, Mayfield Avenue
It's a breezy day, the sun is making
its daily descent, and you're merely
walking and breathing. And you are not,
I repeat, not in a rush.
Got it? OK, you're traveling down
Mayfield, until you suddenly see a Diet
Coke can. It's crushed at the center, just
waiting on the ground. What do you do?
Whoa! Wait a minute!
Before you decide to do anything, I
suggest looking at the Diet Coke can. I
mean really squint your eyes and focus
your sights onto a new vision of that can.
It sounds strange, but don't worry. I've
done this before. It happened the last
time I was walking down Mayfield, not
in a rush, and I saw this strange Diet
Coke can in a new way. So, with my
experience, I shall be your guide to a
brief history of the Diet Coke can.
Before we begin, close your eyes (well,
close only one eye — you need at least
one open to read) and think of a Diet
Coke can. A clear image comes to mind
of a hollow aluminum cylinder, white
with red helical spirals running down its
side, with the words "Diet Coke" printed
in a nice font. Ah, in your head, you've
envisioned the epitome of cans. This
seems pretty useless, doesn't it?
Then great, the tour has begun without
our knowing it. You've realized, I hope,
that this wonderful image of a Diet Coke
can isn't evoking any particularly mag
nificent associations or realizations. It
doesn't have to. But it "can."
If your thoughts about this can are
dry, I suggest that you start to think of
people associated with this can. What

I'm saying is that this can isn't at all
an independent, insignificant object. It
affects people's lives.
First thing: we deduce that someone
must have drunk the Diet Coke from this
now empty can. I see a human being,
say Chris, fumbling with the top, until
it opens. Psssht!
Now imagine the satisfaction Chris felt
as the crisp, carbonated liquid flowed
from the can into his or her mouth,
quenching his or her thirst and then
travelling down into his or her stomach.
It's quite a feeling, when you're really
thirsty, to have a chilled drink to bring
you pleasure.
So the can has done something quite
significant — its history is a good one
to think about. It was involved in the
temporary satisfaction of another person.
On a larger time scale, the caffeine
(nope, it's not the caffeine-free version)
raised Chris's blood sugar level, and he
or she felt a little hyper for a while. All
these effects are related to the Diet Coke
can that's lying on the ground of your
imagination.
But getting back to the can, we can
see many other people involved with it.
The Store took in 47 cents when Chris
felt the uncomfortable yearnings for
drink. There was thus a financial trans
action involved with this Diet Coke can.
Then picture the workers at the can
nery and the truck drivers who trans
ported the Diet Coke can to The Store
so Chris could quench his or her thirst.
These canners and drivers also earned
money. This mere aluminium can has a
rich history.

Finally, think of the conservationists
and the scientists who have been focusing
their efforts on the recycling and envi
ronmental impact of the can.
You can now look at a Diet Coke can
on the ground and see it in a new way.
It does have a significant history. And
you have just seen it. So hopefully, you
will see the underlying direction I'm mov
ing towards. I'm trying to get at two
things.
First, RECYCLE! Don't you want the
can that satisfied so many people, that
can with a unique and rich history to
"come back to life" and "live" a new
history? Unfortunately Chris forgot, and
that's why we found that the can crushed
on Mayfield.
Chris also forgot that although The
United States makes up only 7 percent
of the world population, that 7 percent
"produces" 70 percent of the world's gar
bage.
Secondly, if you look at things in a new
way, you can gain a depth of understand
ing of anything you wish. That even ap
plies to Diet Pepsi cans.

Got it? OK, you're traveling down
Mayfield, until you suddenly see a Diet
Coke can. It's crushed at the center, just
waiting on the ground. What do you do?
Whoa! Wait a minute!
Before you decide to do anything, I
suggest looking at the Diet Coke can. I
mean really squint your eyes and focus
your sights onto a new vision of that can.
It sounds strange, but don't worry. I've
done this before. It happened the last
time I was walking down Mayfield, not
in a rush, and I saw this strange Diet
Coke can in a new way. So, with my
experience, I shall be your guide to a
brief history of the Diet Coke can.
Before we begin, close your eyes (well,
close only one eye — you need at least
one open to read) and think of a Diet
Coke can. A clear image comes to mind
of a hollow aluminum cylinder, white
with red helical spirals running down its
side, with the words "Diet Coke" printed
in a nice font. Ah, in your head, you've
envisioned the epitome of cans. This
seems pretty useless, doesn't it?
Then great, the tour has begun without
our knowing it. You've realized, I hope,
that this wonderful image of a Diet Coke
can isn't evoking any particularly mag
nificent associations or realizations. It
doesn't have to. But it "can."
If your thoughts about this can are
dry, I suggest that you start to think of
people associated with this can. What

I'm saying is that this can isn't at all
an independent, insignificant object. It
affects people's lives.
First thing: we deduce that someone
must have drunk the Diet Coke from this
now empty can. I see a human being,
say Chris, fumbling with the top, until
it opens. Psssht!
Now imagine the satisfaction Chris felt
as the crisp, carbonated liquid flowed
from the can into his or her mouth,
quenching his or her thirst and then
travelling down into his or her stomach.
It's quite a feeling, when you're really
thirsty, to have a chilled drink to bring
you pleasure.
So the can has done something quite
significant — its history is a good one
to think about. It was involved in the
temporary satisfaction of another person.
On a larger time scale, the caffeine
(nope, it's not the caffeine-free version)
raised Chris's blood sugar level, and he
or she felt a little hyper for a while. All
these effects are related to the Diet Coke
can that's lying on the ground of your
imagination.
But getting back to the can, we can
see many other people involved with it.
The Store took in 47 cents when Chris
felt the uncomfortable yearnings for
drink. There was thus a financial trans
action involved with this Diet Coke can.
Then picture the workers at the can
nery and the truck drivers who trans
ported the Diet Coke can to The Store
so Chris could quench his or her thirst.
These canners and drivers also earned
money. This mere aluminium can has a
rich history.

Finally, think of the conservationists
and the scientists who have been focusing
their efforts on the recycling and envi
ronmental impact of the can.
You can now look at a Diet Coke can
on the ground and see it in a new way.
It does have a significant history. And
you have just seen it. So hopefully, you
will see the underlying direction I'm mov
ing towards. I'm trying to get at two
things.
First, RECYCLE! Don't you want the
can that satisfied so many people, that
can with a unique and rich history to
"come back to life" and "live" a new
history? Unfortunately Chris forgot, and
that's why we found that the can crushed
on Mayfield.
Chris also forgot that although The
United States makes up only 7 percent
of the world population, that 7 percent
"produces" 70 percent of the world's gar
bage.
Secondly, if you look at things in a new
way, you can gain a depth of understand
ing of anything you wish. That even ap
plies to Diet Pepsi cans.
