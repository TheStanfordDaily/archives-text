Q. Why do tape and glue
• stick?
A. Tapes and mild glues
• adhere to surfaces be
cause of a phenomenon
known as hydrogen bonding.
Stronger glues such as
Krazy Glue fasten things to
gether by chemically react
ing with and becoming a
part of their surfaces, ac
cording to Chemistry Prof.
Emeritus Harry Mosher.
Tape sticks to things
much the same way water
molecules stay together.
Weak bonds, called hydrogen
bonds, form between water
molecules. Hydrogen bonds
are typically very weak, but
a large number of them can
make a fairly strong bond.
Tape — which contains
glue — sticks because of hy
drogen bonds that form be
tween the tape and another
surface.
Glues also interact in

other ways, noted Chemistry
Prof. Barry Trost. Organic
molecules known as hydrocar
bons, such as the ones found in
glue, interact with other
hydrocarbons. Therefore, glues
only adhere to certain surfaces,
Trost said.
Air pressure also plays a role
in a glue's ability to stick, accord
ing to Mosher. If two very flat
surfaces are pressed together,
thereby eliminating all the air be
tween them, they will stay to
gether. The atmosphere presses
on the surfaces in order to fill
the vacuum between them.
The more reactive glues — for
instance Krazy Glue — actually
bond the surfaces together. The
glue's chemical structure forms
new bonds with the molecular
structure of the surfaces. The glue
therefore becomes part of the sur
faces.
Q. Why does does baking pow
• der do so many things?
A # This seemingly magic pow
.der actually gets its various

properties from one of its ingre
dients, baking soda.
Baking soda has so many uses
because it quickly and readily re
leases carbon dioxide, is non-toxic
and is easily produced on a large
scale, according to Chemistry
Prof. Emeritus Eric Hutchinson.
In cooking, baking soda —
known to chemists as sodium car
bonate — acts similar to yeast
which also releases carbon
dioxide. The gas produced by
baking soda is responsible for the
leavening of cakes and breads.
The little bubbles it generates are
useful in releasing things such as
dirt and plaque from surfaces.
This property makes it useful to
clean your teeth.
Also, baking soda neutralizes
acids in the same chemical process
which releases carbon dioxide.
A box of baking soda will absorb
odors caused by acids, and many
people use baking soda to elimi
nate odor-causing acids floating
around in their refrigerators.
