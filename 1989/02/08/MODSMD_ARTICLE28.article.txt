Q. Why do tape and glue
• stick?
A. Tapes and mild glues
• adhere to surfaces be
cause of a phenomenon
known as hydrogen bonding.
Stronger glues such as
Krazy Glue fasten things to
gether by chemically react
ing with and becoming a
part of their surfaces, ac
cording to Chemistry Prof.
Emeritus Harry Mosher.
Tape sticks to things
much the same way water
molecules stay together.
Weak bonds, called hydrogen
bonds, form between water
molecules. Hydrogen bonds
are typically very weak, but
a large number of them can
make a fairly strong bond.
Tape — which contains
glue — sticks because of hy
drogen bonds that form be
tween the tape and another
surface.
