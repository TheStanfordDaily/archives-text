# Theory on superconductivity eluding scientists

Answering the question what? isn't sat
isfying the scientists. They're furiously ask
ing why?.
For the last three years, scientists have
been racing fiercely to find materials with
no electrical resistance at room tempera
ture, but at the heart of the race for these
superconductors is the search for a theory
that will explain the properties of these
materials.
Although scientists, including some at
Stanford, have developed a large number
of theories, they fail to agree on a single
explanation for the mystifying properties
of high-temperature superconductors.
"There is no compelling evidence sup
porting a single point of view," said Applied
Physics Prof. Malcolm Beasley, an expert
on superconductivity. "Nobody knows what
the theory is."
As superconductors are cooled to tem
peratures approaching absolute zero, they
can conduct electricity without resistance,
and thus no energy will be lost to heating
the material. Power lines made from su
perconducting materials can transmit en
ergy with perfect efficiency.
High-temperature superconductors
Up until 1986, superconducting proper
ties were found in a few certain metals
only at very low temperatures, typically
lower than 30 degrees Kelvin. The mech
anism which explains the functioning of
this group of superconductors has been
relatively well understood for more than
30 years.
But within the last three years, scientists
have discovered ceramics and plastics
which become superconductors at temper
atures up to 125 degrees Kelvin. Although
the temperature is still significantly below
room temperature — set at 298 degrees
Kelvin — finding these higher-temperature
superconductors was a landmark in the
search for one which works at room tem
perature.
The standard theory of superconductors
fails to explain why these non-metallic ma
terials should be superconductors at a tem
perature so much higher than conventional,
low temperature superconductors. The
standard theory is called the BCS theory
after its authors John Bardeen, Leon
Cooper and Robert Schrieffer.
"You must base theories on experimental
facts," Physics Prof. William Little said.
"Certain theories proposed to explain high

temperature superconductivity have con
tradicting experimental evidence."
"But just because a new theory does not
apply to the alloys now does not mean that
it might not explain the superconductivity
of alloys and metals yet to bo discovered,"
Little said.
In 1964, Little proposed a theory of su
perconductivity predicting that certain or
ganic materials could be designed to have
superconducting properties well above
room temperature. Little was one of the
early pioneers in superconductivity who
suggested that room-temperature super
conductors could be possible.
Little said he thinks the BCS theory
only needs to be modified to explain high
temperature superconductors. "You must
start from first principles," says Little. "My
theory is actually an extension of the BCS
theory."
The standard theory of superconductivity
The BCS theory rests on the assumption
that as a superconducting material is cooled
below its transition temperature — the
temperature below which it acts as a su
perconductor — pairs of electrons become
loosely "bonded" together.
But how can the electrons be attracted
to one another and form pairs when they
both carry the same negative charge and

should therefore repel each other?
The answer lies in the interaction be
tween electrons and the positively charges
ions in a metal. A metal can be thought
of as a fixed lattice of positively charged
ions with electrons roaming freely between
them.
As one electron moves through a row of
positively charged ions, its negative charge
pulls on the positively charged lattice,
slightly deforming it and creating a minute
excess positive charge next to the electron.
This excess positive charge, in turn, draws
another electron through the same path,
thus loosely "bonding" the two electrons
indirectly.
The pairs are bound so loosely that any
vibration in the material can tear their
bonds apart. At very low temperatures, the
lattice of the metal vibrates only a
negligible amount, thus breaking up only
a few electron pairs.
Nonetheless, when the metal is heated
to its transition temperature, the vibra
tions in the ionic lattice are so violent that
they break up electron pairs at a cata
strophic rate. The metal stops being su
perconducting above this temperature.
With the BCS assumption, theorists es
timated that superconductors should only
exist up to 40 degrees Kelvin. But the
recent discoveries of superconductors at

much higher temperatures has required
theorists to adopt a different model to ex
plain the phenomenon.
Modifications of the standard theory
In Little's modification of the BCS the
ory, the heavy positive ions don't move.
Instead, an electron attracts another
electron by moving between long chains of
molecules. The moving electron sets up a
separation of charge in the lattice which
in turn will attract another electron in its
path.
This property allows the material to
tolerate much higher vibrations before the
catastrophic break-up of electron pairs, re
sulting in a much higher superconducting
temperature for certain plastics.
Other Stanford scientists have come up
with different approaches to the puzzle of
high-temperature superconductivity. At a
Jan. 19 conference in San Francisco,
Physics Prof. Robert Laughlin presented
another model of superconductors based
on what is termed fractional statistics.
"Under well-defined approximations, we
have been able to carry out specific cal
culations which show the model to at least
exhibit the Meissner effect," said Physics
Prof. Sandy Fetter, who has worked with
Laughlin on the theory. The Meissner ef
fect, a crucial feature of superconductors,
is a phenomenon that allows them to
levitate above a magnet.
"To my knowledge, no other models have
allowed this specific calculation to be
carried out to this extent," Fetter said.
Fetter alluded to one of the major prob
lems of formulating theories on supercon
ductivity. That is that so much remains to
be known about the properties of materials,
it is difficult to even begin formulating
theories on the reasons for superconduc
tivity.
Beasley, who is chair of the Applied
Physics Department, said imperfect under
standing of materials makes it difficult to
explain the results of an experiment. "Ex
perimental facts do not confirm or (distin
guish between) theories," Beasley said.
Even though there is no consensus on a
theory for high-temperature superconduc
tors, scientists still envision levitating
trains, better supercomputers and ultra
efficient power transmission. Still, these
applications might not be ready for decades,
and scientists still have not discovered
room-temperature superconductors.
