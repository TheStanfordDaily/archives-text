# Medical students to study anatomy with computer cadavers
## 
### Frank Chen 
Next fall, anatomy students at
the Medical School will drop their
textbooks and tote electronic ones
instead.
Students will no longer just use
textbooks, but will take advantage
of a new system created by Stan
ford doctors called "Electric-
Cadaver." The program, storing
thousands of images of the human
body, will supplement human
cadavers and partially replace
textbooks to study anatomy.
"I wouldn't ever expect
Electric Cadaver to substitute for
real cadavers," said Surgery Prof.
Robert Chase, who helped develop
the program. The program, how
ever, will make learning anatomy
more efficient.
The versatile system allows stu
dents to electronically "dissect" a
cadaver to study the parts of a
body. Though cadavers cost uni
versities only $300 for processing
— state law forbids the sale of
cadavers for money — the pro
gram allows students to dissect
the "cadaver" again and again.

Another great advantage is that
computers are very forgiving of
slips of the knife.
Electric Cadaver, developed by
Chase and Prof. Steven Freedman
of the Medical School, requires a
Macintosh computer, a videodisc
player and a television set. The
system uses the Macintosh to
draw an electronic body and the
videodisc player to send real
images to the television screen.
Chase cites other benefits to the
program, which he said boasts dis
tinct advantages over textbooks.
The program, which contains
more than 4,600 images, holds a
users' interest, requiring them to
point and type rather than to flip
pages in a textbook.
The program also allows quick
access to any particular image.
Anyone, from high school student
to opthalmologist, can use the
program with little modification,
Chase said.
Furthermore, professors might
be able to use the program to test
students instead of giving them
written exams. Finally, the pro
gram allows any image to be

printed directly to a laser printer.
Beyond the ability to display
simple images, Electric Cadaver
can simulate clinical ailments. For
example, the user can "paralyze"
specific facial nerves. The com
puter screen shows the resulting
drooped eyebrows or lopsided
smile, while the television shows
a picture of an actual patient with
the condition.
In addition, the videodisc can
show real surgical procedures in
process. The surgery clips are not
for the faint-hearted, as this
reporter discovered.
Although students can perform
surgery on cadavers, they cannot
study other aspects of anatomy
like human development. As just
one example of the system's
power, Electric Cadaver features a
sequence of hand X-rays tracing
development from birth to adult
hood.
Furthermore, students can
quickly flip between male and
female skeletal structures for easy
comparison. Labels of body parts
can be called on the screen to help
— or test — the user.

Even the manual is ea3y to use.
Students pass an "optical wand"
over bar codes in the book, similar
to the codes used to ring up goods
at grocery stores, providing direct
links to images so they can be
displayed on the television screen.
Chase said the program will be
tested in the fall at the Medical
Center, but he said he expects
"widespread use" nationally of the
Electric Cadaver program after its
experimental stage.
Chase said the technology,
which he and Freedman are still
working on, can be applied to any
discipline, technical or not. The
marriage of computer, video and
sound, loosely called "hyper
media," is already being applied
extensively in education. Freed
men, in fact, is already working
on an organic chemistry program
that will help illustrate chemical
reactions.
If successful, Electric Cadaver
will most likely be leased rather
than sold to other universities.
Chase said he did not have a cost
estimate for the system.
