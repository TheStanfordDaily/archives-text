# Alcohol remains 'drug of choice' at Stanford
## 
### Lauren Friedly 
Two weeks ago, the reprimand
of the Sigma Chi Fraternity
brought fresh attention to the
issue of alcohol consumption on
campus. Alcohol misuse is
America's greatest drug problem
and likewise plagues college cam
puses nationwide. Stanford is cer
tainly no exception to that rule.

This week, dubbed the National
Collegiate Drug Awareness Week,
colleges around the country are
assessing the extent of drug and
alcohol use and abuse on cam
puses.
At Stanford, the "drug of
choice" is alcohol. According to a
1986 survey on student health
performed by the Cowell Student
Health Center, an overwhelming
93 percent of all students drink
or have tried alcohol, and 84 per
cent drink or have tried hard liq

uor. About one of every six
undergraduates reported drinking
hard liquor at least one or two
times a week.
According to a survey of Stan
ford freshmen in spring last year,
85 percent of all freshmen had
drunk alcohol at least a few times
in the 1987-88 school year. Almost
one-third of the freshmen re
ported drinking at least once a
week.
Despite the widespread use of
alcohol on campus, 72 percent of
those surveyed in the freshman
survey said there should be less
emphasis on drinking in student
activities and 37 percent some
times felt hesitant about attend
ing social functions where alcohol
would be served.
Two-thirds of the freshmen
cited availability of alcohol as a
reason for drinking. Even more
freshmen report that the taste of
alcohol, reduction of inhibitions
and enhancement of social activity
are reasons for drinking.
Marijuana and cocaine use oc
curs at a lower frequency than
alcohol use, but the figures are
still relatively high. Some 41 per-

cent of undergraduates reported
having tried or used marijuana in
the previous year, and 17 percent
report having tried or used
cocaine, according to the Cowell
survey.
At Stanford, the Cowell Health
Promotion Program developed a
project to respond to the growing
concern about drug and alcohol
use by assessing the extent of
abuse on this campus.
The project, called Risk Reduc
tion of Intoxicants in the Stanford
Community, was developed to pro
mote a community atmosphere of
reduced risk associated with alco
hol and other drug use.
The programs are all student
led and include personal party
planning, alcohol risk appraisal,
intervention in high risk situa
tions and helping a friend with a

problem.
Students working on the pro
gram say their goal is not to
abolish drinking or alcohol. In
stead, they say, the goal is to pro
mote low-risk drinking practices
among students who chose to
drink and to create an atmosphere
in which students who choose not
to drink feel comfortable.
Warning signs of problem
drinking include getting drunk re
peatedly, drinking because of
depression, anxiety or loneliness,
experiencing blackouts, feeling
more comfortable when under the
influence than when sober, in
creasing tolerance and decreasing
hangover symptoms, out-of
character behavior and rationaliz
ing the need for alcohol.
