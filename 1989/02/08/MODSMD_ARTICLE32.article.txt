## Stanford hoops are really No. 2 
### 
It's been one of those weeks where nothing seems
to go quite right. And, so . . .
It's time for a random sampling of what's on
my mind about the world of sports.
First, an arbitrary new statistic called "total
ranking" for determining which school has the best
combined (men's and women's) basketball program
in the nation.

If a school had the No. 1 men's and women's
teams in the Associated Press polls it would receive
a total ranking of two (the best score possible). If
one team was ranked No. 18 and the other No. 4,
the total ranking would be 22.
Not only is 22 an excellent score in this stat, it
also happens to be the total ranking for Stanford
University (yes, ours truly). And, according to my
rough calculations, that's second best in the nation
to lowa's 15 (men No. 8, women No. 7).
Other notables are North Carolina State at 29,
UNLV at 36, LSU at 39 and Ohio State at 40.
What does it all mean? Not a whole lot, but it'll
give you something to do when the polls come out
next week.
On a more serious note, the selection of Bill
White to be National League president,
lauded by the media, gets additional praise
here.
Having enjoyed White's work for years on New
York Yankees telecasts, I can state categorically
that he is a knowledgeable baseball man and a class
act.
Ever since the infamous Campanis incident, blacks
have been waiting for League Baseball to do
something about the dearth of blacks in manage
ment positions.
Tabbing White as NL president is an excellent
step. No one would dare question his impeccable
credentials and White will prove that blacks have
the "necessities" to perform any job in baseball.
And, he'll perform it as well as anyone, regardless
of color.
Perhaps when one of the many teams with a


MARK ROGOWSKY
revolving door on its manager's
office gets back its five-cent
deposit after firing its latest
many-time loser, they'll finally
give the job to Bill Robinson, Bob
Watson, Hal Mc√üae or one of the
dozens of other blacks who are
eminently qualified to be field
managers (that, plus Frank Rob
inson of the Orioles would bring
the total to two of 26).
Who knows, perhaps there's

even a general manager's suite in
the offing for a non-member of
the old-boy network.
Unbelievable. There's a
men's basketball game at
Maples Pavilion that is not
yet sold out.
Even more unbelievable: The
game is tomorrow. Though the
Washington State Cougars don't
figure to be any more of a match
for the Cardinal than they were
at Pullman, it could be the last
chance for non-season ticket
holders to see the nationally
ranked Cardinal in action this

season.
During yesterday's tennis
match, Scott Meinert said there
were still about 500 tickets avail
able. Be there and scream your
heads off.
You may not believe it, but,
despite getting a very late
start, football Coach Dennis
Green is going to sign one of the
top 15 recruiting classes in the
nation today.
Headlined by the No. 1 offensive
line prospect in the land, Bob
Whitfield, Green's new charges
promise to be a top-notch crew.
