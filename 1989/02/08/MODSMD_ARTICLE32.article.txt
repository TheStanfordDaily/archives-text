## Stanford hoops are really No. 2 
### 
It's been one of those weeks where nothing seems
to go quite right. And, so . . .
It's time for a random sampling of what's on
my mind about the world of sports.
First, an arbitrary new statistic called "total
ranking" for determining which school has the best
combined (men's and women's) basketball program
in the nation.

If a school had the No. 1 men's and women's
teams in the Associated Press polls it would receive
a total ranking of two (the best score possible). If
one team was ranked No. 18 and the other No. 4,
the total ranking would be 22.
Not only is 22 an excellent score in this stat, it
also happens to be the total ranking for Stanford
University (yes, ours truly). And, according to my
rough calculations, that's second best in the nation
to lowa's 15 (men No. 8, women No. 7).
Other notables are North Carolina State at 29,
UNLV at 36, LSU at 39 and Ohio State at 40.
What does it all mean? Not a whole lot, but it'll
give you something to do when the polls come out
next week.
On a more serious note, the selection of Bill
White to be National League president,
lauded by the media, gets additional praise
here.
Having enjoyed White's work for years on New
York Yankees telecasts, I can state categorically
that he is a knowledgeable baseball man and a class
act.
Ever since the infamous Campanis incident, blacks
have been waiting for League Baseball to do
something about the dearth of blacks in manage
ment positions.
Tabbing White as NL president is an excellent
step. No one would dare question his impeccable
credentials and White will prove that blacks have
the "necessities" to perform any job in baseball.
And, he'll perform it as well as anyone, regardless
of color.
Perhaps when one of the many teams with a
