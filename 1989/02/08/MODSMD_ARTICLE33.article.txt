# Netters squeak by tough UC-Irvine
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
NCAA championship teams are
in a great position when it comes
to scheduling. Almost any team
in the nation, weak or strong,
would like a crack at the top
squad, making scheduling for a
titlist particularly easy. If the
champion wants to start the
season simply, it can readily find
an unchallonging non-conference
opponent willing to accept the in
vitation.
The Stanford men's tennis
team, however, seems averse to
easiness. Opening its season with
a nailbiter that lasted well after
the daylight and warmth had
waned, the No. 2 Cardinal per
severed to notch a 5-4 victory over
fifth-ranked U.C. Irvine.

Men's Tennis
Cardinal 5, Anteaters 4

The win jumpstarted Stanford's
season at 1-0 while dropping the
Anteaters to 2-3. Irvine's record
is hardly indicative of the team's
ability, however, as the squad re
mained poised and intense
throughout the twists and turns
of the five-hour contest.
The match came down to the
final doubles match. After the six
singles matches, the score was
tied at a dead-even 3-all, equal
even in the number of sets won
by each team.
"Irvine's No. 2 player Mark
Kaplan put the first match on the
board with a 6-3, 6-4 beating of
Stanford sophomore Martin
Blackman. Junior Jeff Cathrall
evened things up later with his
3-set win over Trevor Krone
mann.
Kronemann has been nick
named by his teammates "Tank,"
an appelation that is certainly ap
propriate. A stocky player that
would have looked more at home
on the gridiron than the tennis

court, Kronemann smashed his
way to a solid first-set win.
Cathrall adjusted well and came
back to claim a 3-6, 6-2, 6-4 win,
speeding an ace along the center
line to score match point.
"I missed less easy shots (in the
second and third sets)," Cathrall
said. "In the first set I got him
in good position but just missed
the ball at crucial times. In the
second set I didn't do that, didn't
let it get to where that would
matter."
Classmate Jeff Tarango at No.
1 singles rebounded equally well.
After dropping the second set in
a tiebreaker, Tarango took charge
in the third to post a 6-3, 6-7,
6-1 victory over Irvine's Mike
Briggs.
Sophomore Glenn Soloman's
subsequent 6-3, 7-6 win over Rich
ard Lubner increased Stanford's
advantage to 3-1, but the lead did
not last long. Irvine's Mike
Cadigan prevailed 6-4, 6-7, 6-3
over freshman Alex O'Brien and
Shige Kanroji bested senior Curtis
Dunn 5-7, 7-6, 6-3 to deadlock
the team score after singles.
The tie did not end until the
final point of the day that decided
the No. 3 doubles match. The
score had advanced to 4-3 after a
Cathrall-Dan Turbow upending of
Kaplan-Lubner at No. 2 doubles
6-2, 6-4. But the team of Briggs-
Kronemann staved off the potent
but inconsistent duo of Tarango-
Blackman to win 6-4, 3-6, 6-4.
That made No. 3 doubles match
between Barry Richards-O'Brien
and Cadigan-Aaron Stolpman the
match decider. After splitting the
first two sets, an O'Brien cross
court placement shot dribbled to
give the Stanford tandem a 6-4,
2-6, 6-4 decision. Finally, in the
frigid cold and artificial light, the
uncertainty was resolved.
"The match was in doubt all
the way for either team," Stanford
Coach Dick Gould said. "It was a
great college tennis match."
