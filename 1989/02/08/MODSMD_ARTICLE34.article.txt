# Holbrook's bat speaks loud enough for soft-spoken freshman

### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
When you're trying to break in
on a two-time defending national
champion, opportunities come few
and far between.
For freshman David Holbrook,
it was a matter of being in the
right place at the right time.
After the Cardinal's fall base
ball season, Holbrook planned to
battle fellow frosh Roger Burnett
for the role of designated hitter.
Junior Tim Griffin figured to oc
cupy third base — Holbrook's po
sition in high school.
When Holbrook pinch-hit for
first baseman Brian Johnson back
in the second game of the season,
he expected freshman David
McCarty — who worked at first
all fall — to take over defensively.
But McCarty was sick that day
and Holbrook stayed in the game
at first base. He wound up going
2-for-2 and has started every
game since.
"It's ironic that after that
pinch-hit appearance I wasn't
supposed to go in, but McCarty
was sick and I got a second at-bat
and got another hit," Holbrook
said. "That influenced (Stanford
Coach Mark) Marquess' decision
to start me there. 1 hadn't played
first all fall."
Holbrook has certainly made

the most of his opportunity. Hit
ting a torrid .389, Holbrook has
shown his bat should not be on
the bench. His five RBI are tied
for second on the team as are his
three doubles.
Along with freshman Roger
Burnett, Holbrook played an in
strumental role in Stanford's
three-game sweep of Loyola Mary
mount last weekend. He was 4-
for-11 with two RBIs and a
double.
Holbrook has made his living

on breaking pitches, an unusual
trait for a freshman.
"He's got a real quick bat. That
takes the fastball away from the
pitcher," Cardinal shortstop Troy
Paulsen said, "He also doesn't get
fooled on the curveball. That's
what makes him a tough out."
Holbrook agrees that hitting the
offspeed pitch is his strength at
the plate.
"I try to stay on balance and

A surprise starter at first base, freshman David Holbrook has been impressive at bat so far this
season. Hitting .389 with five RBIs this season, Holbrook went 4-for-11 last weekend against Loyola
Marymount.
use my hands. If I'm using my
hands, I hit the ball well. When
I'm not using my hands, I don't,"
Holbrook said. "Coach Marquess
was nagging at me for trying to
hit home runs. I have to stay
within myself."
"I try to look fastball. If I pick
up a curve real well, I'll try and
hit it hard. Even with two strikes
I look fastball, adjust to the
curve," he added. "I'd rather
swing and miss at a curve than
look at a fastball."
Paulsen attributes much of
Holbrook's success to his temper
ament.
"One of the things that I like
about him is he's really even
tempered. He stays on the same
emotional level all the time. There
are no highs and lows. That's key
in baseball," Paulsen said.
Especially when things turn
sour, and Holbrook will have to
cool off sometime.
"I think he'll be fine when he
hits a lull. The way he is — he's
not real emotional — I don't think
it'll bother him at all," Paulsen
said.
The soft-spoken Holbrook
realizes that his place in the Car
dinal lineup could easily be some
one else's.
"There's a lot of pressure
among the players. We can win
with almost anyone on the field
with the pitchers we have,"
Holbrook said. "There are so
many good players here, you're
going to have some good ones on
the bench."
As early as the first month of
fall, Holbrook must have known
this was going to be a banner
season. His roommate surprised
him with a something he could
never have expected.
According to several players, his
roommate arranged to have his
girlfriend fly out all the way from
Holbrook's hometown of Orlando,
Fla. One day she just appeared
at his door.
Holbrook just seems to have a
knack for being in the right place
at the right time.
