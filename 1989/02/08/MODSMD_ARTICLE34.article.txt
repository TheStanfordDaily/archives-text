# Holbrook's bat speaks loud enough for soft-spoken freshman

When you're trying to break in
on a two-time defending national
champion, opportunities come few
and far between.
For freshman David Holbrook,
it was a matter of being in the
right place at the right time.
After the Cardinal's fall base
ball season, Holbrook planned to
battle fellow frosh Roger Burnett
for the role of designated hitter.
Junior Tim Griffin figured to oc
cupy third base — Holbrook's po
sition in high school.
When Holbrook pinch-hit for
first baseman Brian Johnson back
in the second game of the season,
he expected freshman David
McCarty — who worked at first
all fall — to take over defensively.
But McCarty was sick that day
and Holbrook stayed in the game
at first base. He wound up going
2-for-2 and has started every
game since.
"It's ironic that after that
pinch-hit appearance I wasn't
supposed to go in, but McCarty
was sick and I got a second at-bat
and got another hit," Holbrook
said. "That influenced (Stanford
Coach Mark) Marquess' decision
to start me there. 1 hadn't played
first all fall."
Holbrook has certainly made

the most of his opportunity. Hit
ting a torrid .389, Holbrook has
shown his bat should not be on
the bench. His five RBI are tied
for second on the team as are his
three doubles.
Along with freshman Roger
Burnett, Holbrook played an in
strumental role in Stanford's
three-game sweep of Loyola Mary
mount last weekend. He was 4-
for-11 with two RBIs and a
double.
Holbrook has made his living

on breaking pitches, an unusual
trait for a freshman.
"He's got a real quick bat. That
takes the fastball away from the
pitcher," Cardinal shortstop Troy
Paulsen said, "He also doesn't get
fooled on the curveball. That's
what makes him a tough out."
Holbrook agrees that hitting the
offspeed pitch is his strength at
the plate.
"I try to stay on balance and

A surprise starter at first base, freshman David Holbrook has been impressive at bat so far this
season. Hitting .389 with five RBIs this season, Holbrook went 4-for-11 last weekend against Loyola
Marymount.
