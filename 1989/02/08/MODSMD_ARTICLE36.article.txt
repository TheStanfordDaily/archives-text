## Ruggers crushed in weekend match with Cal 
### Libby Feil Staff writer 
The Stanford men's rugby
team's Big Game against Cali
fornia was a painful experience
for the Cardinal. The Bears
commanded the game last week
end, 29-3. However, with this
game over, the rugby team now
has its three hardest matches
behind it.
California has been a for
midable opponent for the last
several years and it lived up to
this reputation in Saturday's
game. Although Stanford
started out by "playing really
well in the first half," according
to Marty Hartigan, the club's
president, and even scored first,
California had built up a slim
lead by the half.
In the second half "we fell

apart," Hartigan admitted. The
players "got really frustrated"
when Cal began scoring, he said.
In the last 15 minutes the
team came completely unglued.
Hartigan said that "that's when
they scored most of their
points. ... Once we started lag
ging a bit, they really punched
it."
However, the worst is over
for now. Having already played
Santa Clara, UC-Davis and now
California, the team has faced
its toughest opponents. The first
team is taking a bye next week
end, while the second and third
teams play away games against
Sacramento State, before play
ing at St. Mary's Feb. 18. "If
we can win the rest of our
games, we can make playoffs,"
Hartigan said optimistically but
not unrealistically.

Ice hockey wins two
matches in L.A.
Stanford's ice hockey team
played three games in Los An
geles last weekend, returning
home with two wins against Cal
State-Northridge, 4-3 and 4-2,
and one loss to UCLA, 10-3. The
victories were a happy surprise
for the players since the Cardi
nal had lost its last two games
against the Matadors here in
Redwood City in November.
The Northridge team "plays
a very physical game," says trea
surer and player David Shapiro.
"We're both defensive teams.
Both teams are very low
scoring. "
