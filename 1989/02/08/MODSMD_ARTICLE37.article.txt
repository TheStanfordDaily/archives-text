Stanford wrestling star Steve Buddie best
analogized his team's 25-14 loss to Fresno State
last night. "Our team is kind of like dry ice," he
said. "We just need a little water to start smoking.
No one poured water on us tonight."

Indeed, the guy with the water bottles must have
arrived late because Stanford lost the first six
matches before the meet hit the one-hour mark.
Squad co-captain Steve Yarbrough (167 lbs ), ap
parently deciding the meet needed a change of pace,
decisioned Fresno State leader Dan Niebuhr 7-2 in
the highlight match of the dual meet. Yarbrough,
currently the best 167 lbs. wrestler in the Pac-10
and No. 12 in the nation, improved his record to
22-3, while Niebuhr's fell to 22-4.
"I haven't had a difficult match in the last few
duals, so it was good to get a tougher one tonight.
I just tried to go out there, wrestle, and see what
the score was at the end of the match. This one
was crucial for seeding at the Pac-10 tournament,"
Yarbrough said.

Buddie (177 lbs.), the team's undisputed showboat
wrestler, literally toyed with his opponent as he
scored a 16-1 technical fall in the second period.
Ron Perry (190 lbs ), who along with Yarbrough
and Buddie compose the team's fearsome threesome,
won by default.
Dave Nowick (118 lbs.), Mark Forman (126 lbs.),
Josh Lisle (134 lbs.), James Dinette (142 lbs.), Geoff
Baum (150 lbs ), Matt Topham (158 lbs.) and Trent
Smith (heavyweight) all fell to tough Bulldog op
ponents.
Coach Chris Horpel said "Yarbrough, Buddie and
Perry looked good as usual. But our lightweights
seemed to lack a fighting spirit. They got spanked.
Hopefully, some of these lightweights will get angry
at their performance and upset some guys next
Friday against Bakersfield."
The loss moved the Cardinal's record to 5-2.
Fresno State stands at 9-9. Stanford will wrestle
one more dual meet against Cal State-Bakersfield
Saturday and then prepare for the Pac-10,'Western
Regionals, to be held Feb. 26-27.
