# Women netters dominate hapless and helpless SCU
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Villanova didn't beat Georgetown.
Kansas didn't beat Oklahoma.
The Dodgers didn't beat the A's.
David didn't beat Goliath.
The Santa Clara women's tennis team
didn't beat the Stanford Cardinal.
As a matter of fact, they didn't even win
a set as Stanford upped its season mark
to 3-0 with a 9-0 shutout of the Broncos.

Women's Tennis
Cardinal 9, Broncos 0

In a match that saw the return of soph
omore All-American Sandra Birch and the
first dual-meet action for freshman Carina
Rolley, Stanford overcame the bitter cold
and steamrolled past Santa Clara.
Rolley took all of 30 minutes in besting
Liz Malone 6-1, 6-0 at No. 6 singles. "Even
when the games were close, we didn't have
any long points at all, so that's why the
match was done so quickly," she said.
"She would hit the ball far, so either
she would blast a winner or not. She really
didn't try to keep the ball in play with
me," Rolley added.
At No. 3 singles, freshman Kylie Johnson
overcame a slow start to notch an impres
sive victory over Jenny Steen 6-3, 6-1.
"I was kind of mentally relaxed in the
first set, not concentrating as much as I

should have been," Johnson said. "I guess
I should have prepared better for the
match. But I picked it up and got it going.
In other singles action: Lisa Green may
have been a bit shaky, but was never in
danger, as she downed Shawn Considine
6-3, 6-3 at No. 1. Debbie Graham
whitewashed Tina Crivello 6-0, 6-0 in 45
minutes at No. 2.
Senior captain Cindy Buchsbaum made
almost equally short work of Kathy Voile
with a 6-1, 6-1 win at No. 4. Finally, at
No. 5 Valerie Wilson dusted Mareen Burns
6-0, 6-2.
"Valerie was very solid," Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan said. "You've got to be
really good to beat [her]."
The idea in a match like this is "you
don't play sloppy," Brennan added.
The best news of the day for the Cardinal
was that Birch finally got back into action.
Saying she felt good, Birch joined Green
at No. 1 doubles. The duo scored a 6-3,
6-2 win over Considine and Steen.
Brennan noted that it was a good chance
for Birch to see some real action. "If [her
injury] started to bother her, she could
just walk away" from the match without
costing the team, he said.
At No. 2 doubles, Johnson-Buchsbaum
didn't drop a game in beating Volle-Crivello
6-0, 6-0. The Rolley-Wilson pair toasted
Malone and Karen Smallen 6-0, 6-1 at No.
