# Researchers link cystic fibrosis to immunity
## 
### Melissa Hurley 
By discovering a connection be
tween cystic fibrosis and defects
in the immune system, Stanford
scientists have moved a step closer
toward understanding the most
common fatal genetic disease in
the United States.
Cystic fibrosis, characterized by
an overproduction of body secre
tions, causes both respiratory and
digestive problems usually result
ing in early death. Though very
little is known about the disease,
it has been linked to defects in
epithelial cells, the cells which line
ducts and passageways in the
body.

Prof. Phyllis Gardner, the re
search team recently observed this
same defect in white blood cells

of the immune system. This con
nection of cystic fibrosis to the
immune system marks an impor
tant advancement in understand
ing the disease. Gardner pub
lished a paper describing the re
search in the latest issue of the
journal Science.
"The study of these white blood
cells will aid both the molecular
and biochemical analysis of the
disease and provide new strategies
for its diagnosis," said Jennifer
Chen, research assistant for the
team.
Because white blood cells are
easily obtained, cultured and ob
served, they are ideal models for
study. Thus, their connection to
cystic fibrosis could lead to tech
niques for prenatal diagnosis of
the disease as well as identifica
tion of cystic fibrosis carriers.
