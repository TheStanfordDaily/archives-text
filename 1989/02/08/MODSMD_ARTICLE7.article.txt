# Report defends free expression
## University counsel examines First Amendment's bounds 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
Racism and bigotry are intolerable at Stanford,
University officials have affirmed time and again
in the past year. But should Stanford protect such
expressions of prejudice?
The University's legal office wrestled with that
question in developing a prepared statement released
today, and the answer, apparently, is a qualified yes.
In the wake of controversial incidents of offensive
expression last spring at Otero House and last fall
at Ujamaa House, the black theme house, many
students have argued that the University should
have more stringent rules against prejudicial speech.
But the opinion, authored by University general
counsels John Schwartz and Iris Brest, found that
in general such rules are inadvisable and that the
two specific incidents do not warrant punishment.
Schwartz and Brest admit that it may appear
hypocritical for the University to deplore discrimi
natory behavior but not support that position by
prosecuting offenders. However, they conclude that
the quest for everyone's enjoyment of civil rights
"must be done by our traditional tools — discussion,
education, persuasion."
Titled "First Amendment Principles and Prose
cution for Offensive Expression Under Stanford's
Student Disciplinary System," the statement appears
in full on page 9 of today's Daily. Schwartz, a
University vice president, said the opinion explains
and defends past University policy, and does not
define new policy.
Last spring, seven masked members of the Phi
Delta Theta Fraternity held a vigil outside Otero
to protest a student's eviction from the house after
he exhibited homophobic behavior violating the Uni
versity's residence agreement. To some, the vigil
was reminiscent of Ku Klux Klan demonstrations
and was thus considered racially offensive.
The Ujamaa incident involved two white students
drawing a caricature of Beethoven as a black man
on a poster that they tacked outside a black student's
door.
"The Otero and Beethoven and other incidents
generated a number of questions about whether
these are things students should be prosecuted for,"
Schwartz said in a telephone interview yesterday.
"We felt it was important for the community to
know the reasons we've been using in the past and
how they would affect these cases."
He added that the statement will probably be
used by the Judicial Affairs Office when it deter
mines what punishment, if any, should be adminis-
tered to the two students who
defaced the flier in Ujamaa.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole has not yet determined
whether the students implicated
in the Ujamaa incident should be
punished. The students in the
Otero incident have already been
exempted from any punishment.
The statement examines Stan
ford's disciplinary system, its ap
plication of First Amendment
principles to the system, past
cases involving free speech issues
and ways in which freedom from
insult and freedom of expression
can coexist on campus.
"This paper has an underlying
conviction: It is that a university,
even more than any other insti
tution, must preserve itself as a
forum for the competition of
ideas, and in doing so must
tolerate the expression of ideas
that some or most of us find
repugnant," the statement reads.
According to the statement,
since Stanford is a private insti
tution it is "not bound by the
First Amendment and can regu
late or curtail the expression of
thought to a greater extent than
a government — or state univer
sity — may."
Nonetheless, the University has

not done so. Indeed, after a
tenured professor was fired for
alledgedly inciting a riot on
campus during the Vietnam War,
a faculty advisory board con
cluded that the University should
interpret the free speech rights
spelled out in the First Amend
ment more generously than the
courts.
The advisory board at that time
also concluded that the Policy on
Campus Disruption, an applica
tion of the Fundamental Stand
ard, is consistent with First
Amendment principles.
Today's statement describes
limited instances when the gov
ernment can regulate expression
and notes that limitations can be
placed on the "time, place and
manner of speech" as long as they
are not based on the content of
the speech.
But the paper sides with current
legal scholarship that interprets
the First Amendment as protec
ting offensive expression directed
toward a group, rather than an
individual.
In the Otero incident, since the
vigil did not endanger Otero res
idents and did not interfere with
University activities, the Univer
sity could not ban the demonstra
tion "without discriminating on
the basis of content," asserts the
statement.
Furthermore, the University
could only ban the demonstration

on the basis of its content if it
was obscene or defamatory or in
cited violence. Although some wit
nesses of the Otero vigil said it
created a tense scene, it did not
lead to blows.
The absence of these three con
ditions, according to the state
ment, "tipped the scales against
disciplinary action. . . . The deci
sion was content-neutral: If all the
other facts had been the same,
the decision would have been the
same even if the expression had
been racially motivated."
Regarding the Ujamaa incident,
the paper says, "Students living
in a residence should certainly be
able to express their thoughts and
opinions to their fellow residents."
Though the defacing of the Bee
thoven poster offended many
Ujamaa residents, a University
fact-finding team found no intent
"to threaten or defame any par
ticular student or students." The
incident also did not disrupt any
University function.
Thus, the paper says, the
Ujamaa incident did not violate
the Policy on Campus Disruption
or the Fundamental Standard.
"Had the two students involved
in the Ujamaa matter stood in
White Plaza, with or without
masks, holding their altered Bee
thoven poster, there is little ques
tion that such objectionable, but
peaceful, speech in a public place

must be permitted at Stanford.
"As noted, the difficulty arises
from the fact that the Beethoven
poster episode occurred inside the
house. One could argue about
whether the board on which it
was posted was a public place
within the house, but the main
point is that the poster was not
a threat, libel or fighting words
directed to one or more individ
uals personally."
The statement concludes with
a discussion of applying general
free speech rights to offensive ex
pression.
"It is important to keep always
in mind that these are individual
rights; they do not depend on the
agreement of the majority that
the views expressed are within
some pale of acceptable ideas.
Even if all people of good will
deplore and detest an opinion,
they may not prohibit or punish
it because of its content.
"Some have urged that Stan
ford's Fundamental Standard is
in conflict with, or perhaps over
rides, First Amendment principles
because it demands 'respect for
. . . the rights of others' and we
hold out freedom from insult on
racial, ethnic, sexual and other
grounds as a right we mean to
provide within the community.
But no one has a right that an
other person not hold an opinion,
or express it."
