# Report defends free expression
## University counsel examines First Amendment's bounds 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
Racism and bigotry are intolerable at Stanford,
University officials have affirmed time and again
in the past year. But should Stanford protect such
expressions of prejudice?
The University's legal office wrestled with that
question in developing a prepared statement released
today, and the answer, apparently, is a qualified yes.
In the wake of controversial incidents of offensive
expression last spring at Otero House and last fall
at Ujamaa House, the black theme house, many
students have argued that the University should
have more stringent rules against prejudicial speech.
But the opinion, authored by University general
counsels John Schwartz and Iris Brest, found that
in general such rules are inadvisable and that the
two specific incidents do not warrant punishment.
Schwartz and Brest admit that it may appear
hypocritical for the University to deplore discrimi
natory behavior but not support that position by
prosecuting offenders. However, they conclude that
the quest for everyone's enjoyment of civil rights
"must be done by our traditional tools â€” discussion,
education, persuasion."
Titled "First Amendment Principles and Prose
cution for Offensive Expression Under Stanford's
Student Disciplinary System," the statement appears
in full on page 9 of today's Daily. Schwartz, a
University vice president, said the opinion explains
and defends past University policy, and does not
define new policy.
Last spring, seven masked members of the Phi
Delta Theta Fraternity held a vigil outside Otero
to protest a student's eviction from the house after
he exhibited homophobic behavior violating the Uni
versity's residence agreement. To some, the vigil
was reminiscent of Ku Klux Klan demonstrations
and was thus considered racially offensive.
The Ujamaa incident involved two white students
drawing a caricature of Beethoven as a black man
on a poster that they tacked outside a black student's
door.
"The Otero and Beethoven and other incidents
generated a number of questions about whether
these are things students should be prosecuted for,"
Schwartz said in a telephone interview yesterday.
"We felt it was important for the community to
know the reasons we've been using in the past and
how they would affect these cases."
He added that the statement will probably be
used by the Judicial Affairs Office when it deter
mines what punishment, if any, should be adminis-
