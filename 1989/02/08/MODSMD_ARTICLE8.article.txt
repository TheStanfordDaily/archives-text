## Business School offers debt relief to lower-paid graduates 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Often faced with debt after two
years at the Graduate School of
Business, students there do not
necessarily pursue corporate jobs
out of preed — sometimes it's a
matter of economic survival.
Entering a career in public serv
ice may seem out of the question
for these struggling graduates.
But a loan-forgiveness program,
started last year by the Business
School, makes jobs in public serv
ice possible.
The program helps pay off some
of the debt many Stanford grad
uates build up over their two
years at the Business School. De
pending on a graduate's yearly in
come, the program voids most of
the debt for graduates employed
in lower-paying public service

jobs.
According to Malcolm Mac-
Kenzie, cofounder of the program,
the higher salaries of corporate
jobs often lure graduates who
must pay off their debts within a
few years of receiving their diplo
ma.
He estimated that a Business
School graduate can owe as much
as $40,000. Coupled with the
temptation of private sector jobs
paying in excess of $50,000 a year,
the meager salaries of public serv
ice jobs — usually only about
$25,000 a year — quickly dis
courage new graduates from
public sector work.
MacKenzie said those interested
in working for the public sector
have to be driven by a strong sense
of altruism in an area where
"skills are desperately needed."
Even with the program, a grad

uate employed in the public sector
would still be financially pressed,
he noted, saying "Our scheme was
never to make it lucrative, only
to make it possible."
Since its inception last year,
just one graduate has benefited
from the program. The recipient
and also one of the founders of
the program, Mickey Levitan,
class of 1985, currently works in
Thailand with the Save the
Children organization. The pro
gram did not initially serve
alumni retroactively, so the loan
came as a surprise to I^evitan.
After consulting with students
and administrators from other
professional schools offering such
programs, Levitan and other stu
dents met with Business School
officials to start Stanford's pro
gram.
