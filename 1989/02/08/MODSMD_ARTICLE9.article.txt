Americans live longer
says Hoover expert
Americans are retiring earlier
and living longer, healthier and
wealthier, according to Senior
Hoover Institution Fellow Rita
Ricardo-Campbell.
A nationally prominent expert
on Social Security, Ricardo-
Campbell is the author of "The
Economics and Politics of
Health."
She noted that four out of five
Americans now retire at age 62.
Those 62 and older comprose
one-sixth of America's popula
tion.
Thanks largely to Social Se
curity, this group receives one
forth of the gross national prod

uct.
Those living in households
headed by individuals 65 and
older, now have per capita in
comes second only to the "near
old," those aged 55 to 64.
While 5 percent of the aged
live in nursing homes, most "live
in their own homes, free of
mortage, drive their own cars,
enjoy vacations and lead what
some describe as an envious life
of retirement," Ricardo-
Campbell told a Jan. 28 confer
ence on "Issues of the '90s"
sponsored by Hoover and the
Stanford Alumni Association.
"There are, of course, large
numbers of poor among the
aged, but there are a far greater
number who are well off. The
lowest incident of poverty for any

age group is for those 65 and
over," she said.
