# Free speech reports differ
## 
### Janine De Fao Staff writer 
Should the University follow freedom of speech
standards set by the U.S. Constitution or should it
develop its own guidelines?
That question was answered differently in two
separate reports published yesterday. The first, writ
ten by general counsels John Schwartz and Iris
Brest, upheld the Constitution as the University's
past, present and future measure to determine rights
of expression.
The second, published by Philosophy Prof. John
Perry and graduate student C.R. Douglas, con
tradicted the conclusions reached by the University's
legal office and argued that certain First Amendment
rights of students can and should be limited by the
administration.
Perry and Douglas stated in their report that
they "support an absolute right to express thoughts
in a university. But this does not entail the right
to express any thought in any manner or circum
stance."
Both reports address recent incidents on campus
that have been termed racist.
Although Schwartz and Brest stated that First
Amendment rights should be upheld in University
decisions, Douglas said, "Stanford
shouldn't abide by the First
Amendment. We ought to uphold
higher standards of what is ap
propriate and what is inap
propiate. There is no reason why
we should uphold rules that some
one else has established."
Perry said in an interview yes
terday that First Amendment
rights prohibit government inter
ference in freedom of expression,
but contended that the University
as a private institution has the
choice to establish its own laws
concerning this freedom.
Schwartz and Brest also ad
dressed this choice in their state
ment but said that as a university
Stanford should especially uphold
First Amendment rights.
Last spring, seven masked
members of the Phi Delta Theta
Fraternity held a vigil outside
Otero House to protest a student's
eviction from the house after he
exhibited homophobic behavior
violating the University's resi

dence agreement. To some, the
vigil recalled Ku Klux Klan dem
onstrations.
This fall in Ujamaa House two
students, named Fred and Alex in
the Ujamaa report, drew a carica
ture of Beethoven as a black man
on a poster they tacked outside
the door of a black student,
termed QC, with whom they had
argued about the possibility of
Beethoven having black roots.
Concerning the Ujamaa inci
dent, Perry and Douglas stated in
their report that the actions of
Fred and Alex violated QC's rights
as stated in the Fundamental
Standard.
Perry stated that Fred and Alex
had the right to their opinion
which they were free to express
in discussions and written state
ments, but that they "were not
free to post a derogatory flier in
the dark of the night outside a
particular person's room." The
report explains that this would
have "a chilling effect" on QC's
freedom of speech.
Although Perry and Douglas
suggest this violates the rights
given to QC by the Fundamental
Standard, Schwartz and Brest ar

gue that the action did not violate
QC's First Amendment rights be
cause it did not directly defame
QC nor did their action threaten
his safety or that of others.
Perry stressed that "there is a
distinction between freedom to ex
press thoughts and freedom to ex
press thought in any manner and
at any time." He said Fred and
Alex should have been able to see
that the expression of their opin
ion at that particular time and in
that manner "would cause
distress to a particular student."
On the other hand, Schwartz
stated that it is impossible to sep
arate an idea from its expression
because people express thoughts
in different ways. As an example,
he stated that two students stand
ing in White Plaza holding signs
reading "All Jewish people should
leave the University because they
are a bad influence" and "Kikes

go home" cannot be judged sepa
rately on the grounds that one is
written in an insulting way.
"Under the First Amendment
you can't say that the thought
was OK, but the way you chose
to express it was not," Schwartz
said.
Schwartz described his and
Brest's statement as a factual ac
count of how the University has
and will continue to handle inci
dents such as these.
Douglas noted, however, that
the general counsels' report does
not seem to echo the sentiments
of University President Donald
Kennedy and Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons. Following the
Otero incident Kennedy stated
that the University will not
tolerate "statements or expres
sions that demean or threaten
others, or that are racist, sexist
or homophobic."
