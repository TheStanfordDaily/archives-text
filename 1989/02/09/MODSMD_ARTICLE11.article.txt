## Vote on Tower nomination faces two-week delay 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Senators said
yesterday a first vote on John Tower's
nomination as defense secretary will be
delayed nearly two weeks while the FBI
reviews allegations about his finances
and drinking, but President Bush stood
by him, denouncing "rumor and frenzied
speculation."
"There are new allegations of a finan
cial nature which are now being checked
in the Tower nomination," said Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., the Armed Services Com
mittee chairman. He told reporters he
could not vote to confirm Tower until
the latest charges were checked, and said
he had told Bush that.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said new
allegations linked Tower to the Pentagon
procurement investigation, which has in
volved payments by defense contractors
for classified information regarding
lucrative military contracts.
"It has to do with this procurement
scandal, the '111 Wind' thing," said
McCain, using the Justice Department
name for the investigation. "I ... have
no independent knowledge. But I am con
fident that is the case."
Tower has denied trading secrets for
cash. But Nunn and other senators have
voiced concern whether Tower could
avoid conflicts of interests in view of the

more than $1 million he received as a
consultant for mqjor defense contractors
after ending a 24-year career in the Sen
ate four years ago.
Bush told reporters at the White House
he had seen no evidence causing him to
lose confidence in his nominee.
"Have I seen anything, or has anything
in the FBI report made me want to
change my mind as one who would be
concerned about insobriety or about fail
ure to be ready for duty 24 hours a day?
The answer is, 'No, I have not.'
"If somebody has something other than
rumor and frenzied speculation, please
get it to the FBI or get it to the White

House staff, or certainly get it to the
committee in the Senate. But let us be
fair enough that we do not deal in rumor
after rumor," Bush said.
Meanwhile, White House counsel and
chief ethics adviser C. Boyden Gray pre
sented the FBI report to Nunn and Sen.
John Warner of Virginia, the Senate
panel's ranking Republican. The White
House said it was "standard practice" for
the White House counsel's office to
"carry such reports to the hill."
But it also appeared to be a move to
appease Nunn, who on Tuesday had ex
pressed irritation that the White House
had briefed committee Republicans and

not him.
The administration had been pushing
for a vote this week, but dropped that
after Nunn and Warner met with Bush
Tuesday night.
"I told the president frankly that I
have serious concerns, and I also stated
that if a vote was held immediately as
some have urged, I would vote no because
of these concerns," Nunn told reporter.
The Senate majority leader, George
Mitchell of Maine, said that all members
of that body wanted to thoroughly review
the FBI report, and therefore, "I don't
see how it is possible to bring the matter
to a vote this week."
