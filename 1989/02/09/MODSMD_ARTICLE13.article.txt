JERUSALEM (AP) - A Jewish
settler was burned to death yes
terday when a firebomb struck
his car in the occupied West Bank,
Israel radio said. Three Palestin
ians were reported killed by army
gunfire, and a fourth was slain
in a prison riot.
The surge of violence came a
day after the U.S. State Depart
ment issued a report alleging the
Israeli army's handling of the 14-
month Palestinian uprising "led
to a substantial increase in human
rights violations" in the occupied
territories.
Yesterday's deaths raised to at

began against Israeli rule in the
occupied territories. The Jewish
settler was the 16th Israeli to die.
Israel radio said the firebomb

the West Bank settlement of Alfe
Menashe, a Jewish enclave close
to the Arab village of Qalqilya.
It quoted an Alfe Menashe res
ident as saying: "The auto was
caught in traffic and ... a
firebomb was thrown at the car.
No one left the car."
The driver, 38-year-old Albert
Jerassi, who also lived at the
settlement, was killed, the radio
said.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
told reporters: "For the third

time, I think, people have been
burned alive inside our country
by these rioters. . . . Everybody
should understand that we cannot
stand against this with empty
hands."

three young children died in a
firebomb attack near the biblical

dier who attempted to save the
