Fernando Ricardo said bodies
were spread out over a wide area
at the crash site in the center of
the island.
Witnesses told Ricardo they saw

the plane hit a lower slope, then
bounce over a road, lose an engine,
and crash into the mountain at
1:40 p.m. (6:40 a.m. PST).
The jet, which had a history of
service problems, was bound from
Italy to the Dominican Republic,
with a refueling stop in Santa
Maria.
"The plane was very low, every
thing seemed perfectly normal,
then it turned and flew straight
into the mountain," said witness
Manuel Vairos Figueredo, mayor
of the fishing village of Santa Bar
bara near the airport.
"There was a tremendous ex
plosion. The plane burst into
flames and trees around it caught
fire. Nobody could possibly have

survived," Vairos Figueredo said
in a telephone interview with the
AP.
Rescue workers spread out over
the rugged, wooded crash site re
covered between 50 to 70 bodies
by Wednesday midnight, local of
ficials said. Heavy fog and diffi
cult access to the crash site ham
pered rescue efforts.
Police sealed off the site and
rescue efforts were put off until
daybreak today. Rescuers said
they could not continue without
floodlights.
The Portuguese Civil Protec
tion Service, which provides res
cue services and aid in civilian
emergencies, said apparently no
one aboard survived.
