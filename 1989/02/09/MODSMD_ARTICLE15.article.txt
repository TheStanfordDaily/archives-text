Bush talks tough on environment
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush said
yesterday he wants to develop a consensus among
industry and environmental interests in an effort
to find ways to clean up the environment "without
stifling the economy."
Americans are impatient for results on -envi
ronmental cleanup, Bush said at swearitig-iri cer
emonies for Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr.
and Environmental Protection Agency Adminis
trator William K. Reilly, the two top officials
who will guide his administration's environmental
efforts.
"They won't accept excuses anymore and they
won't accept finger-pointing. They want us to
get all the sides together and find a way to
achieve both their goals," he told a gathering at
EPA headquarters where Reilly was sworn in.
Bush's visit to EPA was the first by a president
since the agency was created in 1970. Reilly noted
this when he made his remarks following his
swearing in.
Budget: Big boost for education
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush will
propose more than $250 million in education
spending above former President Reagan's budget

and will call for a special tax deduction of up to
$3,000-per-child for adoptions, administration
and congressional sources said yesterday.
The sources, who insisted upon anonymity, said
the $1.16 trillion spending plan Bush will outline
in a nationally televised speech to Congress at 9
p.m. EST Thursday will project a deficit of
roughly $98 billion, and even less if billions of
dollars from proposed sales of assets are counted.
Manson denied parole yet again
SAN QUENTIN, Calif. (AP) — A parole board
yesterday rejected freedom for the seventh time
for mass murder Charles Manson, convicted
leader of the infamous "family" that murdered
pregnant actress Sharon Tate and eight others.
"He's still at war with society and definitely
a danger," said Albert Leddy, chairman of the
three-member panel of the state Board of Prison
Terms, which voted unanimously against parole
for Manson.
Manson declined to attend the hearing after a
dispute over whether he would be shackled during
his appearance. The board considered the latest
psychiatric study and his prison history, which
listed six citations for behavioral problems since
his last hearing.
