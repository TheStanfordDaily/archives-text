Legal report reaffirms
University commitment
to a forum for dialogue

FREE SPEECH at Stanford
will not be compromised.
And thus the University
will cultivate the environment
conducive to teaching and learn
ing that it aims for.
Since last May, emotions flared
over the wave of painful racial
incidents that convulsed the
campus. Yet, amid all the justifi
able outrage and grief, a funda
mental principle underlying the
turmoil and necessary for its res
olution had been overlooked.
Under the First Amendment,
the seven men involved in the
Otero vigil and the two freshmen
who posted a racist flier in
Ujamaa House had a constitu
tional right to express their
opinions, no matter how abhor
rent or offensive their motiva
tions were.
The University's report on
"First Amendment Principles and
Proscecution for Offensive Ex
pression Under Stanford's Stu
dent Disciplinary System," pub
lished in yesterday's Daily, pro
vides a needed legal perspective
on the bounds of expression and
freedom of speech on campus.
While the conclusions of the
report may be difficult to accept
on an emotional level, as the
report itself acknowledges, it
guarantees Stanford students the
constitutional right to challenge
and debate without censorship.
Without such a pledge, Stan
ford loses its most powerful tool
for combating racism and preju
dice.

Although some students may
advocate a University ban on
racist or sexist speech, education
by a fiat of silence can't and won't
work.
Hopefully, the report will bring
campus debate back to life.
But guaranteeing the right to
free speech is not enough.
True freedom of expression will
never be achieved until all mem
bers of the community are
equally amplified, not just given
the microphone.
The report suggests that this
is an intention of the University.
It also serves as a reminder that
the offensive incidents of the last
year are valid and important top
ics of discussion.
With these principles in mind,
the University itself should take
a stand on the embattled issues
of racism, homophobia and
sexism with the same legitimacy
it gave to the issue of free speech.
While the report establishes
the University's commitment to
free expression, the administra
tion must use its resources to
insure that all voices on this
caWj9ttlr"9ie heard.
The University paid more than
$2,000 for the First Amendment
advertisement that appeared in
The Daily. University President
Donald Kennedy commissioned
two Stanford legal experts to dis
cuss the school's commitment to
free speech but has yet to ask
the University's ethnic experts
to address campus racism. Why
not also buy an ad for the Uni
versity's multicultural deans that
lends insight to the reality of
campus racism and its implica
tions?
The University should use the
freedom and express itself —
with words and actions.
