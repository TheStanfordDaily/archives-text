## Free speech cheapened 
### 
Freedom of speech is a powerful tradition
in our society, and nowhere does it have
greater or more special power than in
universities, where unconventional and
heterodox ideas are the very breath of life.
— University President Donald Kennedy,
"Reflections on Racial Understanding"
Because of his support of free
speech, Donald Kennedy's
"thoughtful paper" on cultural di
versity has won him my "Good-guy of
the Month" award for January.
What's more, if Kennedy's actions back
up his rhetoric, he will win my "Good-guy
of the Year" award. And if Stanford
responds to the president's exhortations
— if it truly becomes tolerant of opinions
that deviate from its norms — Stanford
will win itself recognition as the School
of the Decade.
But Stanford has a long way to go.
Kennedy's statement on free speech was
itself heterodox enough to draw two hard
hits in The Daily's editorial page, one by
a student and one by a faculty member.
Amazingly, those two attacks on Ken
nedy were the only two op-ed pieces that
addressed the issue of free speech and
the Ujamaa incident. Didn't anybody else
feel compelled to consider the First
Amendment implications of censoring
repugnant speech? Where were the law
students? Where were the card-carrying
members of the ACLU? Where were the
free-lance civil libertarians?
Unfortunately, it's hard to grudge them
their silence. Everyone familiar with
Stanford knows that this community too
often reduces honest debate to a McCar

thyite exercise in label-and-smear: Raise
the right questions on the wrong issues
and run the risk of pigeon-holing yourself
as a reactionary or worse. In most cases
and for most people, this risk is too great
to run.
The result is a passive but übiquitous
censorship. This censorship not only
squelches expression where there is broad
consensus of community opinion, as there
was and should have been over Ujamaa,
but also prohibits rational discussion
about issues over which reasonable people
can and probably should differ.
Think I'm wrong? I hope 1 am, but
my experiences lead me to conclude other
wise. Here's a test case: At dinner
tonight, with people who are not your
Hfery closest friends, try to honestly dis
cuss either divestment or affirmative ac
tion. Good luck. I bet that one of two
things happens: Either you find a pre
existing unanimity of opinion, or the con
versation disintegrates.
If you can't hold a reasonable conver
sation on a controversial topic, you know
that we're in trouble. Too many people
seem to confuse appropriate political ar
gument with ad hominem or, worse, ad
genus attack. As it stands, this confusion
threatens reasonable debate at Stanford.
If it gets much worse, it will threaten
Stanford itself.
Universities exist at the mercy of so
ciety. Our society is a noble one: It
believes so strongly in freedom of speech
and its cousin, freedom of inquiry, that
it has established at great cost institu
tions dedicated solely to the unfettered
exercise of these freedoms.

Stanford is such an institution: As
President Kennedy said, "universities are
places where ideas are life's blood." And
each time it allows an idea, even an "un
conventional or heterodox" one, to be
drowned out by the righteous clamor of
the few or the many, the University takes
a small step towards failure in the eyes
of an increasingly impatient society.
President Kennedy understands this di
lemma. To solve it, though, he must be
more active. Just as neutrality in war
favors the nation with the biggest army,
administrative inaction on free speech
favors the party with the loudest mega
phone.
Kennedy and Stanford must actively
condemn censorship. The next time a
speaker gets shouted down, the president
should publicly deplore it. The entire com
munity should know that Kennedy —
and through him, our school — finds
such action unacceptable and out of
keeping with our democratic heritage and
our academic purpose.
Moreover, Kennedy should do his best
not to allow complicated debate to be
decided by astute use of the political
smear. If Kennedy can manage this task,
it will be his lasting legacy to this school.

about issues over which reasonable people
can and probably should differ.
Think I'm wrong? I hope 1 am, but
my experiences lead me to conclude other
wise. Here's a test case: At dinner
tonight, with people who are not your
Hfery closest friends, try to honestly dis
cuss either divestment or affirmative ac
tion. Good luck. I bet that one of two
things happens: Either you find a pre
existing unanimity of opinion, or the con
versation disintegrates.
If you can't hold a reasonable conver
sation on a controversial topic, you know
that we're in trouble. Too many people
seem to confuse appropriate political ar
gument with ad hominem or, worse, ad
genus attack. As it stands, this confusion
threatens reasonable debate at Stanford.
If it gets much worse, it will threaten
Stanford itself.
Universities exist at the mercy of so
ciety. Our society is a noble one: It
believes so strongly in freedom of speech
and its cousin, freedom of inquiry, that
it has established at great cost institu
tions dedicated solely to the unfettered
exercise of these freedoms.

Stanford is such an institution: As
President Kennedy said, "universities are
places where ideas are life's blood." And
each time it allows an idea, even an "un
conventional or heterodox" one, to be
drowned out by the righteous clamor of
the few or the many, the University takes
a small step towards failure in the eyes
of an increasingly impatient society.
President Kennedy understands this di
lemma. To solve it, though, he must be
more active. Just as neutrality in war
favors the nation with the biggest army,
administrative inaction on free speech
favors the party with the loudest mega
phone.
Kennedy and Stanford must actively
condemn censorship. The next time a
speaker gets shouted down, the president
should publicly deplore it. The entire com
munity should know that Kennedy —
and through him, our school — finds
such action unacceptable and out of
keeping with our democratic heritage and
our academic purpose.
Moreover, Kennedy should do his best
not to allow complicated debate to be
decided by astute use of the political
smear. If Kennedy can manage this task,
it will be his lasting legacy to this school.
