## Women are not the only ones objectified by fliers 
### 
LAST WEEK, in a Feb. 2 letter
Diana Blank condemned a frater
nity for having its pledges dress
up as playboy bunnies in White Plaza.
Then a Feb. 6 letter condemned yet
another fraternity. This time it was for
circulating a party flier which appar
ently "objectified women." While I am
not writing this letter in an attempt to
dismiss either event as perfectly accept
able, I am questioning what appear to
be double standards on our campus.
In our attempt to overcome the
many prejudices embedded in our
society, we have become very sensitized
to incidents including the objectifica
tion of women. Unfortunately we seem
to have turned our backs on nearly
identical occurences involving men.
An excellent example of this involves
two other fliers circulating at about
the same time as Alpha Epsilon Pi
Fraternity's advertisement. Both fliers

We should refrain from
unfairly showcasing a
select few.

were advertisements for Schiff House's
Bard Essentials Bash II held on Feb.
4. One of the fliers is dominated by
two muscle-bound men who are strik
ing an equally seductive pose as the
woman on AE Pi's flier.
Schiffs flier goes one step further,
attempting to lure women to the party
by stating that "Hans and Franz will
be there!" Obviously, this must be a
blatant and dangerous example of the
objectification of men's bodies as it
reduced men to nothing more than
objects of women's sexual desires.
The second flier advertising the
Schiff party depicts a man and a

woman inexplicably intertwined. Both
figures are apparently nude and are
lacking heads. This lack of heads, and
thus individuality, is an explicit reduc
tion of both individuals to nothing
more than objects meant only to
satisfy the other's desires.
Another of the complaints against
AE Pi's flier is that it "does nothing
to describe the party itself. It merely
offers its audience the implicit promise
of sex." If a woman sitting upright in
a bikini and sunglasses is an "implicit
promise of sex," the couple in Schiffs
flier must be an open invitation for a
free-for-all.
Until we are prepared to point out
all incidences of objectification, we
should refrain from unfairly showcasing
a select few.
