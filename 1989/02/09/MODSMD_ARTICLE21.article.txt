# Three races manage to share power in a fragile triumvirate
## 
### 
I read with amusement David Chan's
Jan. 30 letter. Although I sympathize
with Chan's point of view, I cannot
help but disagree with his facts con
cerning Malaysia and Singapore.
I am a permanent resident of the
United States who was born in a
Malaysian city called Johore Bahru
which is right next to Singapore. My
father is a Malay who grew up in
Malaysia, and my mother is a Chinese
who grew up in Singapore. I spent my
childhood in both countries and I still
visit relatives in each country occasion
ally. So I dare say that I have a better'

perspective of the racial and nationalis
tic differences between the two coun
tries than Chan.
He claims that the racial composition
in the two countries are the same.
This is untrue. Although Malays form
a 50 percent majority in Malaysia, they
are a miniscule minority in Singapore.
Chan claims that political parties in
Singapore are not drawn on racial
lines. This is true but not for the
reasons he cited.
It is really because the Malay and
Indian minorities are so outnumbered
and underprivileged that they don't
count. Most of the policies are made by
the mtyority Chinese and are intended
to benefit the Chinese.
The Malays and Indians, especially
the Malays, are treated as second class
citizens and are constantly made fun of
by the Chinese. Derogatory terms such
as "Melayu Bqjloh, n meaning stupid

Malay, are commonly used.
In case Chan may consider me
prejudiced against the Chinese, let me
say something about the discrimination
against the Chinese by the Malays. As
I have mentioned above, the Malays
form the mcgority in Malaysia/ Tradi
tionally, they have always been in
charge of government and as such,
have always had the power to make
laws to suit their own race.
The minority races however have
proved to be very resilient opponents
(if one could call them that). The Chi
nese control the economy of Malaysia
and the Indians are the backbone of
intellectualism in the country. While
racial harmony in Singapore is
achieved by the trampling of minority
rights, racial peace in Malaysia is
achieved through a delicate triangular
balance of power.
The point of thia letter is to demon

strate that there is no perfect example
of racial harmony in the world. In
every country I have lived in, bigotry
and various kinds of discrimination
abound.
Unlike Chan though, I have found
that people in California, especially the
Bay Area and including Stanford, arc
the most tolerant and liberal of all the
places I have visited.
Of course, there are some stubborn
single-minded conservatives still left
around, but that shouldn't discourage
someone like Chan to meet some of
those nice Bay Area people who
wouldn't take a second look at you just
because your skin color is different.
Trust me, there are a lot of nice
Californians out there. I know, I
married one.
