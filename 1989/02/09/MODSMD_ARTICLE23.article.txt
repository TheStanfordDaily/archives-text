## Bruuuton wins fan admiration 
### Hy Elaine Riggs Staff writer 
You've seen this before.
Coach Mike Montgomery sends
in one particular tall guy during
a packed game in Maples Pavilion.
The fans start shaking the walls
with familiar shouts aimed at the
big reserve center.
And your friend, who's new to
men's hoops, turns to you in
amazement.
"Why are we booing our own
player?"
No, silly. We're "Bru-ing" him.
That's senior Derek Bruton, the
6-foot-10 guy with the most yell
able name on the Cardinal squad.
He also answers to Bru-dog and
Bru-house in practice. Teammate
Howard Wright calls him Brutus
Beefcake.
"Anything with Bru," Bruton
says obligingly.
Lately, though, Bruton hasn't
been Bru-ed nearly so often as
last year. He's seen his game time
drop from a nine-minute average
junior year to two or three min
utes in most recent games.
Disappointment. Frustration.
These are taking a toll on
Bruton's confidence.
Bruton stretches out on a chair
that seems too small for him and
looks at his sneakers.
"When I'm on the bench, I'm
saying, I'm going to go in and get
the job done. But deep down
there's this question mark — can
I do it?
"And if I could do it, why wasn't
I there before?"
The problem is not Bruton's
performance in practice, Mont
gomery said.
"Derek works hard every damn
practice and that's all I can ask,"
Montgomery says.
Teammates agree that Bruton's
hard work makes him stand out.
"Derek has improved 300 per
cent from when he got here —
and he was a good player coming

in," Wright says.
"He's stronger and quicker. He
runs better. And he jumps higher
than he ever has," Wright adds.
Bruton has lost weight, too.
Once dubbed "House" by the
team, Bruton came back this year
25 pounds lighter and earned the
nickname "Condo" from the
coach.
Even Bruton says this is his
greatest year of practice yet.
So what's the problem? Quite
simply, Bruton has to wait in line.
Last season, Bruton played second
only to senior Greg Butler at the
center position.
Now he has to wait fourth in
line behind Wright, senior Eric
Reveno, who returned after being
redshirted for an injury last
season, and strong newcomer
Adam Keefe.
Bruton has been feeling pretty
down about it. But he's trying to
turn things around.
"For the last three days, I've
been repeating the word over and
over again: 'positive,'" Bruton
says.
He may have plenty to look for
ward to if he feels positive about
the 1989-90 season. After red
shirting freshman year due to an
injury, Bruton has another season
of eligibility left.
"I want to be an effective starter
next year," Bruton says. He
warms to the subject.
"I want to know I can go up
against any of the big guys in the
league and put up the same jump
hook shot that I did in practice.
"I want to be the high scorer
one game. I want to be the high
rebounder in another game. I
want to shut down a star center
from the other team," Bruton
goes on.
Of course, next year the names
will change, but the competition
for the starting center spot will
remain. Sophomore Lang Meyer,
redshirted this year, and incoming

recruit Jim Morgan will also com
pete for the spot.
Montgomery says Bruton will
have every opportunity to beat
the competition for the starting
position.
"I've always tried to give the
seniors the benefit of the doubt,"
Montgomery says.
Meanwhile, Bruton goes to
practice an hour and a half early
every day to lift weights and work
on his game.
Actually, Bruton is no stranger
to the limelight. As a senior at
Gilroy High School, Bruton
averaged 22 points and 14
rebounds per game, breaking the
school's career scoring record.
To see the Cardinal highlight
of Bruton's high school career,
though, you'd have to go back to
his junior year.

Bruton's team was up against
their rival high school for the
homecoming game.
This was back when Bruton had
received a couple of nice letters
from Stanford, but he hadn't ac
tually talked to anyone here.
"I remember starting the game
and I looked over and saw this
guy in a three-piece suit — and
he was smiling at me," Bruton
says.
"No one wore three-piece suits
to my high school games," Bruton
adds.
Well, Bruton's team was down
one point with 13 seconds to go.
A fellow guard missed the shot
and the rebound came to Bruton.

buzzer and the homecoming-crazy
