# Washington State at Stanford
## 
### 
TONIGHT — KCBS (740 AM) broadcasts live at 7:30 p.m. from Maples
Pavilion. KZSU (90.1 FM) will provide updates during its coverage of the
Stanford-Washington women's basketball game, and will switch over to
the men's game after the women's game concludes.
RECORDS - Stanford (17-5, 8-3 and 3rd in Pac-10 play), WSU (7-12, 2-8
and 9th in the Pac-10).
SERIES — All-time. WSU leads 44-35. Last game: Stanford handed WSU
its worst Pac-10 loss ever in winning 85-43. Stanford scored the first 13
points of the game.
COUGAR UPDATE — Though it's just past the midpoint of the Pac-10 season,
WSU has already been mathematically eliminated from winning the con
ference title. However, forward Brian Quinnett has been lighting up the
box scores. He scored 44 against USC two weeks ago, and is currently
tied with Todd Llchtl for third in scoring (Pac-10 games only) at 21.4.
CARDINAL UPDATE — Stanford has clinched its third-straight winning season,
its best streak since 1964-67. The Cardinal is 9-0 at home, and with four
home games left has a chance to become only the fourth Stanford team
in history to finish undefeated at home.
KEYS TO VICTORY —In the teams' last meeting, WSU came out with a
defensive game plan that basically left Stanford unchallenged on the
perimeter, and the Cardinal exploded accordingly. If the Cougars adjust
defensively for this game, Stanford must work the ball inside patiently.
WINDEX PLAYER OF THE WEEK — Lichti, the Pac-10 Player of the week has
also received national honors as the Windex Player of the Week, which
is awarded to "the week's most versatile and hard-working player." Lichti
had 57 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists in Stanford's road wins over
ASU and Florida. The award is selected by sportscaster Dick Vitale and
a team of ESPN college basketball experts.
