# Key cager now coaches against Card
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Don't be mad at Charli Turner — she's
just doing her job.
As many longtime Stanford women's bas
ketball fans know, Turner was an integral
part of the squad for the last four years.
Named Most Inspirational Player for the last
two seasons, she served as Cardinal co-captain
on last year's 27-5 team.
This year, Turner has transformed from
ally to opponent. Now a graduate student in
sports psychology at Washington, the Stanford
grad is also graduate assistant coach of her
former team's chief rival, the+iuskies.
Tonight, when the No. 4 Cardinal travels
to Seattle for a game that may well determine
which squad will wear the Pacific 10 Confer
ence crown, Turner will see her past jux
taposed with her present as she sits on the
Husky bench, watching two teams in which
she has invested much of her energy and
emotion fight it out with the greatest of stakes
in the balance.
Who will she root for?
"It's very hard, because I consider every
body on the Stanford team a friend," Turner
said in a phone interview Tuesday from Wash
ington."I care for them all a lot as people
and I want them to do well. •
"But when it comes to us (Washington)
playing Stanford, I sit on the bench and am
happy when the Stanford players do well, but
I naturally want us to win. I'm at a new

school, and that's where my loyalties need to
lie."
With her loyalty realigned, it is natural for
Stanford fans to wonder about Turner's ad
herence to the National Security Act. With
the inside knowlege she has obtained about
the Cardinal in her four undergraduate years,
the nouvelle-Husky could be a valuable
resource for the Washington staff in preparing
for this contest.
Fortunately for Turner, this has not been
an issue. While Washington Coach Chris

Gobrecht has made a few inquiries, she has
observed over the course of three years of
Pac-10 competition all she really needs to
know about the Cardinal.
"That's one difference between Stanford and
Washington," Turner observed. "We're known
for our defense and do our own thing. We
don't prepare for opponents; we don't make
a lot of adjustments here.
"Besides, they know Stanford. I don't think
I could tell them much that they don't already
know."
