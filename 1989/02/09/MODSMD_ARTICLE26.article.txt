# Stanford at Washington
## 
### 
TONIGHT — KZSU (90.1 FM). 7:30 p.m. tipoff in Hec Edmundson Pavilion.
RECORDS — Stanford (17-2, 9-0 in Pac-10 play, ranked fourth by AP), Washington (15-6, 8-1).
SERIES — Washington leads the series 5-3, but Stanford has won the last two contests, including
a 72-60 win in Maples Pavilion last month.
HUSKY UPDATE — With sophomore forward/center Karen Oeden recovered from an early season
foot injury that kept her out of action when the Huskies and Cardinal last met, Washington had
won five straight until a nine-point loss to No. 11 Long Beach State in Seattle Tuesday night. Guard
Yvette Cole is the Huskies' most productive player (15 0 ppg, 2.2 rpg), followed by center Amy
Mickelson (12.0 ppg, 4.7 rpg).
CARDINAL UPDATE — The Cardinal enters the contest fresh off of two convincing wins over the
Arizona schools. The pair of victories increased Stanford's scoring margin to 17.4 and average
scoring to a whopping 83.9 ppg. Forward Katy Steding remains atop the Stanford scorers with
15.6 ppg, followed closely by Pac-10 Player of the Week nominee guard Jennifer Azzi at 15.4 ppg
KEYS TO VICTORY — Stanford must overcome pressure in order to win the game: Along with coping
with the 8,000 vocal fans that the Huskies are expecting tonight, the Cardinal must also handle the
tough pressure defense that Washington has made its trademark Defensively, Stanford must key
in on three players Cole, Deden and forward Traci Thirdgill — who could all score often against
a lax defense. If the Cardinal can duplicate its impressive 58.5 percent shooting performance from
the last clash and add to it consistently stingy defense, the cagers will be well on the road to a
Pac-10 sweep and title.
