# Card nine starts well, plows over Aggies, 9-3

### Bruce Sarkisian Senior staff writer 
While luck may not have been
on the Cardinal nine's side during
the first week of the season, Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess was
able to turn the fickle lady around
during last weekend's sweep of
Loyola Marymount.

Baseball
Cardinal 9, Aggies 3

Now he's got another weapon:
Mother Nature.
The rain held off just long
enough in Davis yesterday for the
Stanford baseball team to defeat
the UC-Davis Aggies 9-3 in a game
where Marquess showcased much
of his rich pool of young talent,
while the veterans also continued
to produce runs.
Stanford improved its record to
4-3, the Aggies fall to 2-3.
Freshman Steve Worrell got the
call for the mid-week start, and
performed admirably in the spot
light, giving up only one hit while
striking out three batters in two
innings work and parleying his
first Stanford start into his first
Stanford win.

The Cardinal jumped out to a
7-0 lead by the fourth inning and
just cruised to victory from there.
In the first, Davis starting
pitcher and loser Chris Kjome hit
Stanford designated hitter Roger
Burnett. Burnett scored on a
ground-rule double by Paul Carey,
who in turn crossed the plate mo
ments later on a round-tripper by
third baseman Tim Griffin.
The Cardinal picked up right
where it left off in the second,
when Frank Carey and Burnett
walked. An RBI single by short
stop Troy Paulsen scored Carey.
In the fourth, Burnett hit a single
past a charging Aggie infield to
score fellow frosh Ryan Turner
and Troy Tallman.
While the hitting attack was
very balanced, so was the pitch
ing. Six Cardinal hurlers took the
mound and shut the Aggies down.
Most encouraging were the
performances of Worrell and
freshman Aaron Dorlarque who,
like Worrell, worked two innings
and gave up only two hits.
Card note
The non-related brother team of
Frank Carey and Paul Carey continue
to have the hot bats for the Cardinal.
Each has hit safely in all seven of
Stanford's games.
