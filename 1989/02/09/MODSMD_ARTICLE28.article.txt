# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
After the usual haggling, The Daily finally
selected this week's winners of the Athletes
of the Week award. And, coincidentally, like
the award itself, neither of the two winners
was at Stanford last year.
Michclle Griglione of the women's swim
team, who stopped out last year, and fresh
man Roger Burnett of the baseball team
are the lucky winners.
Griglione, a 5-foot-10 sophomore from

Alexandria, Vir., led the second-ranked Car
dinal to a 95-45 win over third-ranked Texas
Saturday in Austin.
For the second consecutive meet,
Griglione won all three events in which she
was entered. She began in the 200 butterfly
where she defeated Lady Longhorn Kristi
Kiggans, the third-place finisher in that
event at last year's NCAA Championships.
Griglione next won the 500 freestyle by
.01 second over Texas' Stacy Cassiday. Cas
siday was the top point-scorer at the U.S.
Open Championships last December. Also
in the 500 freestyle field was 1988 U.S.
Olympian Andrea Hayes.
Griglione ended her day by winning the
400 individual medley, finishing nearly five
seconds ahead of the field. In all three events
Griglione was well below the NCAA quali
fying standard and each of her times were
Stanford season-bests.
The Cardinal is now 5-0 entering its final
dual meet of the season, at California Sat
urday.

Burnett, a 6-1 freshman from Broken Ar
row, Okla., had seven hits in 12 trips to the
plate as the Cardinal recorded its first three
wins of the baseball season by sweeping the
No. 8 Lions of Loyola Marymount.
Saturday, in the first game of a
doubleheader, Burnett started at third and
had a double and a towering homer to left
centerfield as Stanford scored a 6-5 win. He
also scored two runs in the contest.
In the nightcap, Burnett blasted a triple

among hia three hits. He again scored twice
and his third run batted in of the day helped
Stanford thrash LMU, 11-4.
Sunday, moving to the designated hitter
spot, Burnett continued his torrid offensive
barrage.
Again stroking two hits and driving in a
run, the freshman was a key contributor to
the series-sweeping 9-6 win.
For the weekend, Burnett scored six runs
while batting in four more.
