# Students to foot bill for new housing
## 
### Malinda McCollum Staff writer 
With Centennial Campaign gifts
designated for new undergraduate
housing trickling in, University
officials said yesterday that future
residence projects will be funded
by borrowed money, with stu
dents' fees paying off the debt as
usual.
As has been necessary for past
housing projects, the debt will be
financed either through addi
tional room rate increases or tui
tion increases, set specifically to
offset the loans.
Twelve million dollars of the
$1.1 billion Centennial Campaign
is targeted for undergraduate
housing. But Assoc. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Norm Robinson said
last week that contributions for
new housing have amounted to
"not many or none," and Assoc.
Campaign Dir. Richard Bennett
said he doubts any more dona
tions will be forthcoming.
"Money to build new housing,
unless there is a gift, will have
to be borrowed," said Director of
Housing and University Food
Service Keith Guy.
Both room and board rates

must increase to finance the an
nual debt repayment after a loan
has been secured to build new
housing, Guy said.
Housing and Food Service is a
self-financing unit within the
University that operates on an
"auxiliary budget" separate from
University general funds. In the
University's 1988 Financial
Report, Stanford defines auxiliary
budgets as "self-contained finan
cial entities whose expenses are
supported by the charges and fees
they levy."
Since Housing and Food Service
finances are independent of the
University, all funding must be
generated from room rents, board
plans, summer conference reve
nues and gifts.
One of several such self
financing entitites, Housing and
Food Service balances the largest
auxiliary budget at Stanford.
Other auxiliary budgets include
Tresidder Union, the Intercol
legiate Athletic Program and the
Stanford Press.
Changing the University policy
so as to allocate general fund
money specifically for new con
struction would not be a feasible
alternative to the rate increases,

according to Director of Univer
sity Budgets Tim Warner.
A separate fund of University
money subsidizing new housing
would "not fit the way we're cur
rently structured," Warner said.
The University could theoreti
cally take money from other pro
grams, he said, but he emphasized
that the budget is tight every
where. Provost Jim Rosse said,
"If we don't cover our costs from
room and board we have to cover
them with tuition or gifts."
Rosse said any tuition or room
and tjpardi increases would have
to sUJy in line with what students
could pay and what other univer
sities charge. If the University
cannot raise enough revenue
through these sources, "We won't
be able to carry out some of these
projects," he said.
The revenues from tuition are
not usually applied to housing, be
cause not all students paying tui
tion live in University residences,
according to Carol Knestrick,
manager of finances and admin
istrative services for Housing and
Food Services.
With undergraduate tuition
currently $4,260 per quarter, rev

enues from student tuition and
fee payments total more than
$150 million and represent 43.2
percent of the University's gross
income.
Construction of new undergrad
uate housing is currently sched
uled for the mid-19905, and con
struction and operating costs for
the project are now being studied.
Room and board rates currently
increase each year at the rate of
inflation, reflecting the additional
annual costs of Housing and Food
Service, Guy said.
Because of the lack of Centen
nial Campaign gifts for new
housing, Robinson has pushed
back the prospective date of
replacing Manzanita Trailer Park
from 1992 to 1995.
Last year, the new Rains
Houses were financed through
the issuing of public bonds from
the California Educational Facil
ities Authority.
Other recent construction on
campus includes the Serra Admin
istration Complex for $7.7 mil
lion, the Tennis Stadium for $2.5
million, a Tresidder addition for
$2.1 million and the Parking
Structure II for $8.7 million.
