The first bass man
You will simply be amazed.
Gary Karr, the foremost double bassist on the
planet, will be performing next Wednesday, Feb.
15 at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, as well
as giving a special family concert this Saturday
at 1:30 p.m. in Dink.
Call him what you will — maybe the Eddie
Van Halen of double bass — but this guy is
simply awesome. Drawing on the phenomenal
4-1/2 octave range of his 377-year-old instru
ment, Karr is mesmerizing in concert. Next
Wednesday's program will include works by
Albinoni, Grieg, Rachmaninoff and Stravinsky,
among others. Saturday's family concert, spe
cifically geared toward young audiences, will
feature several short pieces in addition to Karr's
legendary rapport with music fans of all ages.
Tickets are available at the Tresidder Ticket
Office, all BASS ticket outlets and at the door.
Four dollar student "rush" tickets may be avail
able.
This man will die
Forget the party posters and the Playboy
bunnies in White Plaza. If you want to have
your dander seriously raised check out pages
225-227 in the new Sports Illustrated 25th An
niversary Swimsuit Issue.
In an article about college students who put
swimsuit photos on their walls is a full-color
photo of Stanford sophomore Jay Lopez hugging
an issue of Sports Illustrated to his chest and
grinning beneath a wall smothered with scantily
clad models.
In the article, Lopez is quoted as saying 'You
need pictures around here. They say nine out
of 10 girls in California are beautiful and the
other one goes to Stanford. We get a lot of crap
about these pictures from the women. They're
all feminists around here. I tell 'em if they don't
like it, they don't have to stay in my room. But
I've got nothing against women. This equal
rights crap — let 'em do what they want, I say."
Nice knowin' ya, Jay.
