# Talkin' tap with Gregory Hines
## 
### Mark Tompkins Editorial staff 
One of the very worst things I
could ever imagine having to do
is a publicity tour. Imagine having
to hype yourself and your latest
project for day after day, having
no idea where you are or who
you're talking to. It's sort of like
the college admissions process
taken to the most hellish extreme.

Occasionally celebrities will be
so busy that they won't have time
to talk to journalists on an indi
vidual basis, and so will talk to a
bunch at a time. Such was the
case with a recent press luncheon
held for Gregory Hines at the
frighteningly well-to-do Portman
Hotel in San Francisco. Hines was
in town to talk about "Tap," a
movie which he calls the best work
experience of his life, for obvious
reasons.
Hines became a tap star at the
age of 5, right when tap was getting
crowded out by those damn

guitars, then getting cranked up
for the first time. "Tap" enables
Hines to bring tap back into the
mainstream, and into the '80s,
with a synthesized bang! More
than that, though, it lets him take
a deep bow to Sammy Davis, Jr.
and a whole generation of classic
hoofers who've kept tap dancing
going, regardless of the whims of
fashion. These pioneering dancers
all appear in "Tap," and Hines
couldn't say enough about them.
Hines sailed through the press
luncheon. The reporters assembled
to meet him were an amusing, if
somewhat motley bunch (there
was The Expert, determined to
show his expertise about every
thing ever done anywhere; there
was Bella Abzug, or at least, her
long-lost twin,- there was a guy who
looked like he'd been cloned from
one of Steve Tyler's toe nails; there
was the hapless college kid tickled
pink to find himself sitting next
to Gregory Hines, and so on).
If the reporters' collective behav
ior occasionally suggested a feeding
frenzy, Hines himself was the
model of tact and friendliness.

Hines is 42, but you'd never
know it by seeing him on-screen
or in person. Looking casually cool
in a gray collarless shirt and black
slacks, he proved to be a walking
encyclopedia of fascinating infor
mation about American show
business. Simply put, he seems to
have seen everyone, met everyone
and tried his hand at every art
form. His stories about seeing
Chuck Berry and Buddy Holly at
Harlem's legendary Apollo Theatre
were spellbinding, as was his
hilarious, if unprintable, story
about exploring Bangkok's red
light district with Willem Dafoe
while filming "Off Limits."
"Tap" shows tap dancing to be
a genuine, if somewhat neglected,
American art form, which begs the
question, where did it come from?
Hines, in all modesty, admits that
he's not sure. "I had dinner with
Gene Kelly one night. It was a
great meal, and it dissipated into
an intense discussion. Gene feels
it was the Irish bog dancers, and
I feel it was a black art. We never

did get anything settled, but we
had a great time.
"I really don't know, but I do
know that black artists took tap
dancing and began to express it in
different ways. Tap dancing was
basically something that was done
up on one's toes, until John
Bubbles bore down and began to
do syncopated combinations on his
heels, during the late '20s and early

'30s. I really don't know. The
debate goes on," concluded Hines,
an admitted "tap purist."
There's no doubt that tap danc
ing Is an integral part of Hines'
identity, how he sees himself. "I
AM a tap dancer," he says. "It's
how I express myself."
The luncheon avoided being a
Gregory Hines lovefest because of
the generous praise Hines had for
his "Tap" co-stars, particularly
Sammy Davis, Jr. For those of us
who grew up dismissing Sammy
Davis and The Rat Pack as just

so much Vegas schmaltz, it was
instructive to hear Hines talk
about what Davis meant to his
generation. "Sammy Davis was the
Michael Jackson of his time ...
he'd go out there for two or three
hours without any smoke, lights
or background singers, and just
AMAZE audiences with his tal
ent," Hines said.
Davis was a big influence on
Hines: "Man, I WAS Sammy Davis
from the age of 11 to about the
age of 15," he admitted, not with
out a trace of bashfulness.

"About 75 percent of the way
through the development of this
picture I realized that Sammy
Davis was the only one who could
play the part of Little Mo," Hines
said. "The character of Little Mo
is really a leader, and we knew we
were going to cast [veteran tap dan
cer) Sandman Sims and that ilk,
and even though those men are
older than Sammy Davis, Jr., he
is a leader. Because Sammy broke
through, and when he broke
through it was as an international
star of tap dance, in addition to
everything else he did, so in that

way he represented us all."
"I wanted to work with Sammy
so bad, and I didn't want it to be
just a gig at a nightclub. I wanted
it to be something special. I was
concerned because I knew he'd had
a hip operation about four months
before the movie was to start, and
he was signed to go out on tour
with Frank Sinatra and Dean Mar
tin. I didn't know if he could do
it. But when he read the script, he
called me up the next day and
said, 'This is it, I wanna do it."'
Had Hines ever worked before
with any of the other "indestruc
tible" (his word) old tappers in the
film? "Definitely. These men were
my heroes, my teachers. Sandman
was my mentor. He'd come by the
Apollo Theater and come back
stage when my brother and I were
there, and he'd bring me out into
the alleyway behind the Apollo,
and he and I would tap dance for
hours back there. I was 8, maybe
9 years old."
Hines talked about Sandman in
a tone of frank admiration.
"Sandman steals the movie. He's
going to take all the Scatman
Crothers roles." How close is the
Sandman on film to the real-life
Sandman? "He's not that ornery,
but he can get that ornery. But
that is exactly who Sandman is.
If you were to get up, and Sandman
were here, and you did a good step,
Sandman would say you stole from
him." [Laughs] "Nobody has their
own original steps, everybody
steals from Sandman."
What was it like to film the
film's "Challenge" scene, in which
the old tappers, some in their
seventies, compete to show who
has the slickest, most flamboyant
moves? "That was the most
amazing thing. I made a movie
with Barishnikov ["White
Nights"], and on the day that Mike
and I shot a couple of dance se
quences together, maybe 20 people
showed up, friends of the crew, to
see it. We shot that "challenge"
sequence, and there were about a
hundred people there to see it."
"And there was some concern
about Sammy," Hines continued,

"because he hadn't really danced
yet. And Nick (Castle, the director]
was concerned, because some of
these guys were over 65, and we
knew it was going to be a long
day. So about three hours before
they were ready to shoot this thing,
Sammy put on his shoes, started
warming up, Sandman accused
Sammy of stealing his steps,"
(laughs), "and the challenge was
on! It was an intense challenge.
Nick tried to break it up, but that
set the tone for the day."
With art and life copping so
many moves from each other in
this inovie, it was interesting to
hear Hines talk about how "Tap"
parallels his own experience.
"There are a lot of things in the
film that I've carried around for a
long time .. . the experience of
making a choice, that all of us
here as artists," (Hines certainly
knows how to flatter a guy), . .at
some point we had to decide
whether to go toward our art, the
thing that we love, and express
ourselves, and struggle to pay the
rent, and feel that frustration, or
get in the mainstream, and get a
job, and have dental coverage."
"In Max's case," Hines said, de
scribing his character in the movie,
"it's not a mainstream job he's
getting, but he's torn between two
forces, a real good and evil situa
tion." Max is torn between his love
of tap, his roots, and his love of
money, which ties in with his cat
burglar skills. "Tap" just doesn't
put those crisp hundred dollar bills
in his pocket the way a life of
crime does, and this dilemma is
the film's dramatic crux.
"At one point I really wanted it
to have a Hollywood ending. You
know, Max gets the lead in a
Broadway musical, and the film
producer sees him and says, 'I'm
going to make that boy a star.' But
Nick really fought me on that, and
I'm glad he did. He said, 'The truth
is, we still can't make a living at
tap dancing today, and it would
be unrealistic.' So Nick thought
we should end the movie on a
hopeful note, with a personal vic
tory for Max."
