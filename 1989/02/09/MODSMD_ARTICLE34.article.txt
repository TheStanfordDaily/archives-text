# Talkin' tap with Gregory Hines
## 
### Mark Tompkins Editorial staff 
One of the very worst things I
could ever imagine having to do
is a publicity tour. Imagine having
to hype yourself and your latest
project for day after day, having
no idea where you are or who
you're talking to. It's sort of like
the college admissions process
taken to the most hellish extreme.

Occasionally celebrities will be
so busy that they won't have time
to talk to journalists on an indi
vidual basis, and so will talk to a
bunch at a time. Such was the
case with a recent press luncheon
held for Gregory Hines at the
frighteningly well-to-do Portman
Hotel in San Francisco. Hines was
in town to talk about "Tap," a
movie which he calls the best work
experience of his life, for obvious
reasons.
Hines became a tap star at the
age of 5, right when tap was getting
crowded out by those damn

guitars, then getting cranked up
for the first time. "Tap" enables
Hines to bring tap back into the
mainstream, and into the '80s,
with a synthesized bang! More
than that, though, it lets him take
a deep bow to Sammy Davis, Jr.
and a whole generation of classic
hoofers who've kept tap dancing
going, regardless of the whims of
fashion. These pioneering dancers
all appear in "Tap," and Hines
couldn't say enough about them.
Hines sailed through the press
luncheon. The reporters assembled
to meet him were an amusing, if
somewhat motley bunch (there
was The Expert, determined to
show his expertise about every
thing ever done anywhere; there
was Bella Abzug, or at least, her
long-lost twin,- there was a guy who
looked like he'd been cloned from
one of Steve Tyler's toe nails; there
was the hapless college kid tickled
pink to find himself sitting next
to Gregory Hines, and so on).
If the reporters' collective behav
ior occasionally suggested a feeding
frenzy, Hines himself was the
model of tact and friendliness.

Hines is 42, but you'd never
know it by seeing him on-screen
or in person. Looking casually cool
in a gray collarless shirt and black
slacks, he proved to be a walking
encyclopedia of fascinating infor
mation about American show
business. Simply put, he seems to
have seen everyone, met everyone
and tried his hand at every art
form. His stories about seeing
Chuck Berry and Buddy Holly at
Harlem's legendary Apollo Theatre
were spellbinding, as was his
hilarious, if unprintable, story
about exploring Bangkok's red
light district with Willem Dafoe
while filming "Off Limits."
"Tap" shows tap dancing to be
a genuine, if somewhat neglected,
American art form, which begs the
question, where did it come from?
Hines, in all modesty, admits that
he's not sure. "I had dinner with
Gene Kelly one night. It was a
great meal, and it dissipated into
an intense discussion. Gene feels
it was the Irish bog dancers, and
I feel it was a black art. We never
