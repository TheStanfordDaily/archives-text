# Have you been offended? Use this pre-fabricated letter to the editor

Have you been offended by something
recently and wished you could get it off
your chest? If so, just how offensive are
the things on your chest?
But very seriously, a recent scientific
study conducted by researchers at the Tim
buktu Institute of Technology concluded
that . . in summary, a disproportionate
number of Stanford students are offended
by really silly things, and we would like
permission to snicker at them."
So don't feel like you're in the minority
if you've been offended recently. Don't sit
and sulk. Write a letter to The Daily. In
fact, if you're too lazy to compose your
own letter you may use the following "Prc-
Fabricated Letter to The Daily." Simply
replace each of the blank spaces with the
appropriate word or words, cut out this
page and mail or bring it to The Stanford
Daily, Storkc Building, Stanford, CA
94305.
Dear Editor,
I am writing to express how
(superlative adverb) of
fended I was by the poster for Friday's
(three Greek letters)

party, which depicted
(your sex) as nothing but
(plural noun).
Furthermore, I am offended by
_'s (a professor) as
sertion that the new CIV core list will
turn freshmen into
(adjective), raving,
(adjective), imbccillic
(animals).
Also, the characterization of all chess
players as white males was entirely mis
leading. For instance, being a nationally
ranked chess master I am personally
acquainted with a talented chess player
who is . (a color) in
addition to being (a
life form).
Lastly, I disagree with the notion that
(body part,
plural) are dirty, although I once knew a
guy named
(someone you dislike) who was so dis
gusting that he
(past tense verb) a cow patty with his
- (body part). But

seriously, folks,
(television evangelist) walks into a bar
with (ex-
Mouseketeer) and says to the bartender,
"I'll bet you (a number)
dollars that my date can guess the under
wear size of any person in this bar." The
bartender isn't any idiot, but he doesn't
think the Mouseketeer can do it so he
agrees to the bet. Pretty soon everybody
in the bar is gathered around with their
pants pulled down, and moments later
______ (punch line).
In light of these problems I would like
to propose several solutions:
• Establish a (your
major) theme house devoted to fostering
an understanding of the important issues
involved in
(your favorite hobby). In order to maintain
the house's integrity, priorities for living
there should be issued on the basis of

(a physi
cal characteristic relating to the size of
one's nose).
(a promise
made by ASSU senators running for elec
tion).
• Create a University committee to

explore institutional discrimination
against (a minority
group), (a gender),
- — (a dormitory),
(a student organiza
tion), (a fraternal organ
ization) and (a species
of rodent). This committee should be
closely modeled after the current Univer
sity Committee on Minority Issues
(UCMI), and like the UCMI would report
its findings by (a
future century).
• Several other administration conces
sions, including Donald Kennedy's left
(tjody part).
(your name)
(your major)
(the nutty, radical organization to which
you belong)
