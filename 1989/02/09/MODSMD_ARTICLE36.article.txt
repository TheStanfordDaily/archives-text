# Michael Hedges talks about his influences, his music and his hair
## 
### Mia Manzulli Staff writer 
The trademark cornrow braids
may be gone, but Michael Hedges
is still the visionary guitarist who
made a name for himself playing
acoustic guitar as a Windham Hill
artist.
No ordinary guitarist, Hedges'
signature string hammering and
pulling techniques and use of dif
ferent tunings have evolved into
a richly powerful sound. Hedges
has expanded this style by ex
perimenting with the harp guitar,
a somewhat obscure instrument
which has a tangential set of five
bass strings in addition to the reg
ular six-stringed neck.
Although many only know him
as a guitarist, Hedges is a versatile
performer who made his vocal
debut on "Watching My Life Go
By" for Windham Hill's Open Air
label. This was the first time
Windham Hill departed from its
all-instrumental format to accom
odate a vocalist. Hedges' voice is
moving and evocative, and he has
established himself as a versatile
singer and songwriter.
In addition, Hedges has proven
himself a talented interpreter of
music with his powerful renditions
of Bob Dylan's "All Along the
Watchtower" and Lennon and
McCartney's "Come Together."
His latest album, "Live on the
Double Planet" captures all the
facets of this eclectic artist's work.
Soft-spoken and relaxed in per
son, Hedges explodes in concert.
He moves easily from subdued in
strumentals to muscular rock as
he slaps, pulls and finger-picks his
guitar with cascading rhythm. He
is not a typical Windham Hill artist
but a guitarist with a difference.
Hedges will be performing Sun
day, Feb. 12 at Dinkelspiel Audi

torium. He recently took time out
from recording to speak to The
Daily about his music, current
projects and plans for the future.
You grew up in Oklahoma and
began playing piano at an early
age. You also played cello and
clarinet. When did you become
interested in guitar and when did
you decide to concentrate on it?
When I first heard Elvis Presley.
I had to "follow that dream ..."
Besides Elvis, whom did you
listen to while growing up?
Peter, Paul and Mary, The Who,
The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix . . . just
about everyone on the radio.
Who has been your main influ
ence?

5 was getting too much into the wild
musician tour road warrior kind of life.
By cutting my hair I could be centered
on my inside.

The Beatles most of all. But I've
been influenced by classical,
modern composers, from Stravin
sky on. All the music I've listened
to has affected me. I'm "very af
fected."
In 1980 you came to Stanford
for a computer music seminar.
What was it like? How did it af
fect your music?
I was there for eight weeks. I
had a wonderful time. You learn
a lot when you study the building
blocks of music in a direct way.
Computer music is the structure
of sound. You become able to
analyze and construct everything
in music. You become very know
ledgeable about what's happening,
and more in tune with how sound

is put together. Electronic music
did affect my playing.
How did you become involved
with Windham Hill and William
Ackerman?
That was really fun. The sum
mer I was at Stanford I needed to
make some bucks. I went to the
best place around and got a job.
It was at the New Varsity [now
the Varsity theater]. I played guitar
in the courtyard. I was "discov
ered" thee by Will Ackerman who
was at the theater to see a soft-porn
flick. We struck a deal the next
day.
What exactly is the Open Air
label? Was it created for you by
Windham Hill?
Yes, it was my project. Open Air

accomodates my other interests
like vocals. Windham Hill might
engulf Open Air, I'm not sure.
Where do you see your music
going? What are you working on
now?
This is the kind of question I
like . . . not that the other ones
weren't good questions. My newest
album is called "Taproot." It's a
story about plants, and the music
is the soundtrack to the story. The
plant loses its stalk, and it travels
underground to find it. There is
no singing on the album — the
narrative is included in the music.
This record is the first time I do
a solo with electric guitar. I also
use my regular acoustic, a harp
guitar, a twelve string, synthesizers

and a little high strung guitar. It's
me and a whole bunch of instru
ments .. . mostly solos.
It's sort of an expanded "Aerial
Boundaries." There are some
pretty wicked tunes. It's more
"whacka whacka," with lots of
flailing on the guitar. But there are
some very subdued sounds as well.
So I show off a lot but keep very
balanced. It's not all heavy.
Do you have any particular
songwriting method?
No. But the last one was like
this: David Crosby would call me
up — we've gotten to be good
friends. He gives me the lyrics from
a dream he's had. And I write songs
for them. This is the easy way.
Then there's the painstaking
method. I get an idea anu try to
work from it: I write music, then
go back for lyrics, then have to go
back to the music, then the lyrics
again. It just goes on and on. It
drives you crazy.
It would be fun to work more
with lyricists. It would be easier.
Trying to make music with already
existing lyrics is a viable method
of songwriting.
Not anymore.
Right now you have a group of
followers — I hesitate to use the
term "cult-like" — who arc pas
sionate about your music. Do you
like this or would you rather be
more mainstream?
I like the word "cult" — you can
use it. I have no target audience,
and I guess that's why I have a
certain amount of cult-like fans.
Not aiming at anybody is some
how an attractive attack — it's an
attack but it's not. I have no desire
to cater to anybody. And that's
attractive to me in other
musicians. I really like AC/DC,
they're not trying to make money
