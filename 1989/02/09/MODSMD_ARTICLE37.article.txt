# Only the tap dancing is not macabre

### Mark Tompkins Editorial staff 
"Tap" is a 1940s musical decked out
in 1980s clothes. It tells of Max Wash
ington (Gregory Hines), a bitter ex-con
who wanders back into the midtown
dance studio his father once owned.
There he meets his dad's old dance
cronies, veteran tappers who were his
own childhood mentors. Despite being
out-of-work and broke, these men still
have their talent and their spirit; they're
tap dancing into their own graves.
Their leader is the crusty Little Mo
(Sammy Davis Jr.), who has a scheme to
bring tap dancing into the '80s. Mo has
this crazy idea about hooking tap shoes
up to a synthesizer and figures that Wash
ington is just the man for the job. Wash
ington isn't buying in, however. Despite
his interest in Mo's daughter Amy (Suz
zanne Douglas), and his affcction for her
son (Savion Glover), he wants to leave
tap dancing behind him for good.
"Tap" is a shamelessly sentimental
movie, so sappy and good-natured that I
feel like a rotten person for criticizing it.
Without any irony whatsoever, writer
director Nick Castle Jr. presents some of
the most embarrassing cliches imagina
ble, and yet he does it with such energy
that he almost manages to pull you into
the movie despite all your misgivings.
A movie like this lives or dies on the
merits of its dance sequences, and on
this level, at least, "Tap" succeeds bril

liantly. The choreography by Henry
LeTang (as well as Gregory Hines' "im
provography") is always inventive and
sometimes amazing.
Hines himself is a triple-threat: here
he acts well, dances fabulously and even
gets to sing, showing everyone just how
he managed to have a No. 1 R & B hit
last year.
The electronic tap dancing at the
climax is a great gimmick. Using a real
system called Tap-Tronics, Hines stomps
around a nightclub, having the time of
his life, and all his tap sounds are altered
and amplified by a synthesizer. It's a neat
device and the most exciting part of the
movie. Castle and Hines know how to
end on a high note.
