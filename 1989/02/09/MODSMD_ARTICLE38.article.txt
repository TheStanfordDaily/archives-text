When, in the movie "Her Alibi," readers
start telling mystery writer Philip Blackwood
that his novels are predictable, moviegoers
take warning — "Her Alibi," starring Tom
Selleck as writer Blackwood is nothing but
predictable.
What do you expect when you cast super
model Paulina Porizkova as a Romanian mur
der suspect and Selleck in a role not far
enough removed from his TV persona on
"Magnum P. 1."? Although neither of the prin
cipals does a particularly bad job of acting,
the script they are working with does abso
lutely nothing to help them out.
Blackwood needs a bestseller. So he combs
the courthouses of Manhattan in search of

a story, and lo and behold, in walks Nina,
the most beautiful suspect either side of the
Hudson River.
Intrigued by the woman's case (she's ac
cused of killing a fellow Romanian with a
pair of scissors), Blackwood decides to provide
her with an alibi — hence the title — and
get some material for his latest novel. So he
whisks her off to his gorgeous lakeside home
in Connecticut where he will live in constant
fear of being killed by the mysterious Nina.
Of course, Nina is being followed by some
shady KGB types, and her skill in killing
huge insects by hurling knives at them
doesn't shed any light on her character. Her
acrobatic feats through the neighborhood su
permarket and her expertise in archery (except
when nailing Blackwood in the thigh) don't
exactly add up either.

It's easy to confuse Tom Selleck's character
of Philip Blackwood with that of Thomas
Magnum because he keeps up a running
commentary on the events that have hap
pened. Only in this case, Blackwood embel
lishes things to write a story for his hero
Peter Swift, the author's suave, cavalier ro
mantic alter-ego. Hearing the content of
Blackwood's novel is enough to make you
not want to read it — never mind sit through
the rest of this film.
Selleck, who was wonderful in "Three Men
and a Baby," should have stuck to television
instead of making this movie, and Paulina
is much lovlier on the cover of "Vogue." Not
only is the plot contrived, but the movie is
boring and silly as well. The only question
that will run through your head during this
film is why did they bother?
