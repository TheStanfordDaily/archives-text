# Alpha Delt alums want to save frat
## 
### DJ Berinstein Staff writer 
Local alumni of the Alpha Delta
Phi Fraternity are pushing to
have the University reverse its
recent decision to place the fra
ternity in the 1989 housing draw.
In a letter addressed to Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons,
the alumni complain of what they
call a lack of "due process" on
the part of the University and a
lack of consultation in making its
decision.
The first and only notification
of the closing alumni received was
via an article in The Daily, not
by the same letter that was sent
to former chapter president Eric
Gai. "Given that we all receive
seemingly daily requests for con
tributions to the University, it is
clear that you have our addreses,"
the letter states.
Copies of the letter were also
sent to University President
Donald Kennedy and Fraternal
Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano.
Acknowledging past problems
of the Stanford chapter such as
not meeting their housing quota,
incurring a debt to the University
and drug use, Alpha Delt alumni
stated the concerns were "valid,
but in our opinion, [arel insuffi
cient to warrant the removal of
Alpha Delta Phi's housing
privileges at Stanford."
The letter points to a "strong
alumni organization who are will
ing to work hard to overcome any
problems."
The alumni detail reasons why
the fraternity should be allowed
to keep its house. The letter states
that the Alpha Delt history is a
strong one at Stanford and also
mentions that the fraternity has
met its financial obligations in the
past, and "would fully expect to
meek them again."
Alumni also cited the unfair
ness of "singling out" the Alpha
Delts for not meeting quota since
the quota system has "never been
consistently or uniformly applied"
at Stanford.
Furthermore, the alumni state
they are enraged because they
partially funded the construction
of the house when the University
solicited money to build fraternal
housing in the late 19605.
Alpha Delt President Manoj
Waikar said he was pleased with
the letter, saying it was an "in
formed, cohesive effort on the
part of the alums with a friendly

tone. Alums have money invested
in this school, so the University
might take them a little more
seriously than us."
"We have to give the University
credit, though," he added. "They
aren't out to get us." Waikar said
the University has never "acted
in a rude or authorititative man
ner" and he foresees a good work
ing relationship with the admin
istration.
Waikar also said Alpha Delt
members are in the working
stages of a proposal to change the
all-male house into a co
educational one, somewhat like
Alpha Sigma House.
"A single conclusion has been
made [by the University], but
there are many alternatives," said
Waikar. "We are not out for a
revolution or sit-ins, but we are
willing to reach a compromise,
and the University seems willing
to listen to ideas."
According to Stanford alum
Marshall Kyger, a member of the
Board of Governors of Alpha
Delta Phi International and co
author of the letter, there are now
five co-ed chapters of Alpha Delt
nationwide.
Kyger said he has already met
with the international president
of Alpha Delts who considered the
co-educational status as "accept
able," although Kyger says the
alumni's first priority is simply
to keep the house.
"We recognize some changes
need to be made," Kyger said.
Along with noting the low mem
bership problem, he alluded to
other changes proposed in the let
ter. They include painting over
the murals in the house interior
and the curtailing of Wednesday
night happy hours "to promote
study and academic achievement."
"Individuals within the Dean of
Student Affair's office have a hid
den agenda to get rid of fraterni
ties," Kyger added, but said Lyons
has no particular vendetta against
the Alpha Delts.
The alumni are planning to ex
plore legal options concerning the
use of their money in originally
building the house. Kyger said the
alumni were investigating
whether their donations con
stituted a type of legally binding
contract to ensure its continuance
as a fraternity.
"We want to have an amicable
agreement with the University to
make Alpha Delta Phi a model
fraternity for the next century."

met its financial obligations in the
past, and "would fully expect to
meek them again."
Alumni also cited the unfair
ness of "singling out" the Alpha
Delts for not meeting quota since
the quota system has "never been
consistently or uniformly applied"
at Stanford.
Furthermore, the alumni state
they are enraged because they
partially funded the construction
of the house when the University
solicited money to build fraternal
housing in the late 19605.
Alpha Delt President Manoj
Waikar said he was pleased with
the letter, saying it was an "in
formed, cohesive effort on the
part of the alums with a friendly

tone. Alums have money invested
in this school, so the University
might take them a little more
seriously than us."
"We have to give the University
credit, though," he added. "They
aren't out to get us." Waikar said
the University has never "acted
in a rude or authorititative man
ner" and he foresees a good work
ing relationship with the admin
istration.
Waikar also said Alpha Delt
members are in the working
stages of a proposal to change the
all-male house into a co
educational one, somewhat like
Alpha Sigma House.
"A single conclusion has been
made [by the University], but
there are many alternatives," said
Waikar. "We are not out for a
revolution or sit-ins, but we are
willing to reach a compromise,
and the University seems willing
to listen to ideas."
According to Stanford alum
Marshall Kyger, a member of the
Board of Governors of Alpha
Delta Phi International and co
author of the letter, there are now
five co-ed chapters of Alpha Delt
nationwide.
Kyger said he has already met
with the international president
of Alpha Delts who considered the
co-educational status as "accept
able," although Kyger says the
alumni's first priority is simply
to keep the house.
"We recognize some changes
need to be made," Kyger said.
Along with noting the low mem
bership problem, he alluded to
other changes proposed in the let
ter. They include painting over
the murals in the house interior
and the curtailing of Wednesday
night happy hours "to promote
study and academic achievement."
"Individuals within the Dean of
Student Affair's office have a hid
den agenda to get rid of fraterni
ties," Kyger added, but said Lyons
has no particular vendetta against
the Alpha Delts.
The alumni are planning to ex
plore legal options concerning the
use of their money in originally
building the house. Kyger said the
alumni were investigating
whether their donations con
stituted a type of legally binding
contract to ensure its continuance
as a fraternity.
"We want to have an amicable
agreement with the University to
make Alpha Delta Phi a model
fraternity for the next century."
