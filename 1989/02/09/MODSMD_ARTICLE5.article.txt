# Football recruiting class hot
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
After going through the greatest come
back in Super Bowl history two weeks ago,
Dennis Green may have engineered the
greatest comeback in college recruiting his
tory.
Green, who as the receivers coach of the
San Francisco '49ers saw his team score
with 34 seconds left in the game to win
Super Bowl XXIII, performed a similar
miracle in his new role as football coach
at Stanford. Green today announced the
signings of letters of intent by a recruiting
class considered by many to be one of the
best in the nation.
"This is the surprise class of '89," Super
Prep magazine editor Allen Wallace said.
"[Stanford's recruiting class) will be ranked
somewhere between 12th and 15th, no
worse than 15th to 17th (nationally)."
When Green was named Stanford's foot
ball Coach Jan. 3, he found himself months

behind every other school in the country.
But the work done by recruiting coordina
tors David Kennedy and Keith Sparks kept
many prospects interested and Green and
his staff were able to sign 21 top players.
"We're extremely happy with our recruit
ing class of 21 guys," Green said. "All the
guys are really good ones."
The highlights of the class are offensive
lineman Bob Whitfield from Carson, Calif.,
and punter/placekicker Paul Stonehouse
from Pasadena, Calif. Both are widely con
sidered to be the top high school player in
the nation at their respective positions.
"Bob Whitfield has really all the tools,"
Green said "He has an unlimited future. . . .
Bob Whitfield has the maturity of a junior,
has the enthusiam of a freshman and has
a great football mind."
Whitfield chose Stanford over college
football powerhouses Michigan, Notre
Dame, UCLA and the University of Miami
