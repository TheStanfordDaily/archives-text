# Football recruiting class hot
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
After going through the greatest come
back in Super Bowl history two weeks ago,
Dennis Green may have engineered the
greatest comeback in college recruiting his
tory.
Green, who as the receivers coach of the
San Francisco '49ers saw his team score
with 34 seconds left in the game to win
Super Bowl XXIII, performed a similar
miracle in his new role as football coach
at Stanford. Green today announced the
signings of letters of intent by a recruiting
class considered by many to be one of the
best in the nation.
"This is the surprise class of '89," Super
Prep magazine editor Allen Wallace said.
"[Stanford's recruiting class) will be ranked
somewhere between 12th and 15th, no
worse than 15th to 17th (nationally)."
When Green was named Stanford's foot
ball Coach Jan. 3, he found himself months

behind every other school in the country.
But the work done by recruiting coordina
tors David Kennedy and Keith Sparks kept
many prospects interested and Green and
his staff were able to sign 21 top players.
"We're extremely happy with our recruit
ing class of 21 guys," Green said. "All the
guys are really good ones."
The highlights of the class are offensive
lineman Bob Whitfield from Carson, Calif.,
and punter/placekicker Paul Stonehouse
from Pasadena, Calif. Both are widely con
sidered to be the top high school player in
the nation at their respective positions.
"Bob Whitfield has really all the tools,"
Green said "He has an unlimited future. . . .
Bob Whitfield has the maturity of a junior,
has the enthusiam of a freshman and has
a great football mind."
Whitfield chose Stanford over college
football powerhouses Michigan, Notre
Dame, UCLA and the University of Miami
(Fla.). Stonehouse, who Green
feels has a great shot at becoming
the starting punter for next
season, said "no" to Michigan,
UCLA, Syracuse and several Big-8
Conference schools.
"In the future I think [this
recruiting class] is going to say
something about our ability to go
in and stand toe-to-toe with
schools that may have a national
championship ring or a Rose Bowl
ring, which we hope to have soon,"
Green said. "We don't want to
lose a player because our football
program isn't up to what he
wants. We want to be like any
other department at Stanford. We
want to be the best. ... I think
we have that potential."
Stanford has seven offensive

linemen coming in next year, in
cluding Whitfield, and Glen
Cavanaugh of Spokane, Wash.,
leading Green to say, "I don't
think there's any doubt we have
the best offensive line recruits in
the country."
Green will have 17 starters re
turning next year in addition to
the recruits. "We have what we
think is a strong team coming
back," Green said. "We're looking
forward to spring practice because
there's going to be an awful lot
of competition."
Although the Cardinal suffered
through four losing seasons in
five years under Coach Jack El
way, Green sees no reason why
Stanford cannot compete with any
other team in the nation. "From
1967 to 1977 Stanford never had
a losing season," he said. "When
you look at the players playing
for Michigan, for Notre Dame, for
USC, for UCLA, there are many

top students.... They're looking
for an education. They're looking
for a chance to play and a chance
to win. Also they want to play
football at a high level We
want to put a program together
where they will be able to do
that."
The recruits include
Stonehouse and Whitfield, USA
Today first-team All-Americans,
Cavanaugh, a second-team Ail-
American, and linebacker Dave
Garnett, receiver/running back
Darrien Gordon, defensive
lineman Dinny Hansen, offensive
lineman Steve Hoyem, free safety
Jimmy Klein and defensive back
/quarterback Matt Smith.
Klein and quarterback Jimmy
Lynch are planning on playing
two sports at Stanford. Klein, the
brother of Kristin Klein, Volley
ball Monthly's national Freshman
of the Year, will also play volley
ball and Lynch will play baseball.

schools that may have a national
championship ring or a Rose Bowl
ring, which we hope to have soon,"
Green said. "We don't want to
lose a player because our football
program isn't up to what he
wants. We want to be like any
other department at Stanford. We
want to be the best. ... I think
we have that potential."
Stanford has seven offensive

linemen coming in next year, in
cluding Whitfield, and Glen
Cavanaugh of Spokane, Wash.,
leading Green to say, "I don't
think there's any doubt we have
the best offensive line recruits in
the country."
Green will have 17 starters re
turning next year in addition to
the recruits. "We have what we
think is a strong team coming
back," Green said. "We're looking
forward to spring practice because
there's going to be an awful lot
of competition."
Although the Cardinal suffered
through four losing seasons in
five years under Coach Jack El
way, Green sees no reason why
Stanford cannot compete with any
other team in the nation. "From
1967 to 1977 Stanford never had
a losing season," he said. "When
you look at the players playing
for Michigan, for Notre Dame, for
USC, for UCLA, there are many

top students.... They're looking
for an education. They're looking
for a chance to play and a chance
to win. Also they want to play
football at a high level We
want to put a program together
where they will be able to do
that."
The recruits include
Stonehouse and Whitfield, USA
Today first-team All-Americans,
Cavanaugh, a second-team Ail-
American, and linebacker Dave
Garnett, receiver/running back
Darrien Gordon, defensive
lineman Dinny Hansen, offensive
lineman Steve Hoyem, free safety
Jimmy Klein and defensive back
/quarterback Matt Smith.
Klein and quarterback Jimmy
Lynch are planning on playing
two sports at Stanford. Klein, the
brother of Kristin Klein, Volley
ball Monthly's national Freshman
of the Year, will also play volley
ball and Lynch will play baseball.
