# Med Center tests new AIDS drugs
## 
### Jean Chen 
Stanford researchers are testing two promising
new drugs as part of a drug program that doctors
say might combat the AIDS virus without painful
side effects.
The two drugs will be used in combination with
an already-used drug called azidothymidine that can
cause serious side effects. Neither of these drugs
being tested however, is a cure for AIDS, but both
can be useful in slowing the onslaught of the disease.
If found to be useful, these new drugs could be
administered in rotation with AZT, the only drug
so far approved by the Food and Drug Administra
tion for the treatment of AIDS. By combining them
together in a drug program, researchers hope to
minimize the side effects of each.
Scientists have shown that dideoxycytidine, one
of these two drugs being tested, can suppress the
AIDS virus in patients with the full-blown disease.
However, researchers found that DDC is even more
effective in patients who have the AIDS-related com-
plex, a precursor to AIDS.
Medicine Prof. Thomas Merigan
found in a study that DDC may
be even better than researchers
previously thought. Much lower
dosages seem to be effective,
raising hopes that DDC's most
serious side effect can be avoided.
At lower dosages this side effect,
a painful form of nerve damage,
quickly disappears when the drug
is discontinued.
No results for the second new
drug — recombinant soluble T-4,
or CD-4 — have yet been estab
lished. According to Mark Holod
niy, a co-investigator in this study,
the Stanford AIDS Treatment
Unit is screening volunteer
patients now. They intend to ad
minister CD-4 to their first pa

tient this month.
The Stanford researchers are
working in collaboration with the
Cedar Sinai Hospital in Los An
geles and Massachusetts General
Hospital.
Stanford and the other two
centers have found that CD-4
lowers levels of the AIDS virus
in test tubes. Also, safe dosages
have been established by tests in
monkeys and mice.
These animal tests, along with
early tests in humans, suggest
that CD-4 has only "minimal side
effects, if any at all," according
to Holodniy.
The disadvantage of CD-4 is
that it must be administered by
injection, which could cause prob
lems for patients not under con
tinuous care. However, research
ers are planning a continuous
injection belt pack that out
patients could wear, said Holod
niy. Nevertheless, current plans

for subjects include a four-week
hospital stay.
The advantage to using these
drugs in conjunction comes from
their different methods of sup
pressing the AIDS virus. Both
AZT and DDC, chemical cousins,
thwart the virus's ability to repl
icate its own genetic material, in
terfering with viral production.
CD-4, in contrast, acts as a decoy
that simulates the cell that the
virus attacks, thus drawing away
the virus.
At higher doses, DDC has
caused a form of nerve damage
called peripheral neuropathy,
which causes burning, cramping
and some loss of sensation, pri
marily in the feet and legs.
Another new antiviral agent will
soon undergo initial testing in
humans at Stanford. This drug is
an antibiotic which blocks the
virus's ability to assemble needed
proteins.
