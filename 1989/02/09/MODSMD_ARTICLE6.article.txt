Stanford researchers are testing two promising
new drugs as part of a drug program that doctors
say might combat the AIDS virus without painful
side effects.
The two drugs will be used in combination with
an already-used drug called azidothymidine that can
cause serious side effects. Neither of these drugs
being tested however, is a cure for AIDS, but both
can be useful in slowing the onslaught of the disease.
If found to be useful, these new drugs could be
administered in rotation with AZT, the only drug
so far approved by the Food and Drug Administra
tion for the treatment of AIDS. By combining them
together in a drug program, researchers hope to
minimize the side effects of each.
Scientists have shown that dideoxycytidine, one
of these two drugs being tested, can suppress the
AIDS virus in patients with the full-blown disease.
However, researchers found that DDC is even more
effective in patients who have the AIDS-related com-
