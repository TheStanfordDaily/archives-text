# Perestroika may die, expert says

In an informal discussion yesterday night at
Slavianskii Dom, Harvard University Prof. Richard
Pipes gave Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of perestroika
little chance for success.
Pipes, who served in the Reagan administration
as the Soviet relations expert on the National Se
curity Council, stressed that it would be premature
for the United States to dramatically alter its policies
toward the Soviet Union.
Pipes' former position on the council is soon to
be filled by Political Science Assoc. Prof. Condoleezza
Rice. He is currently researching what he calls the
"first comprehensive history attempted" on the Rus
sian Revolution at the Hoover Institution.
According to Pipes, discontentment with
perestroika — a policy of ecomomic restructuring
— is growing within the Soviet Union. During a
trip to the U.S.S.R. last June, Pipes spoke with
several of the advisers to Gorbachev who were not
altogether optimistic about the policy.
"The chances of perestroika succeeding are very
small," Pipes said. "Yes, [Gorbachev] may survive
politically by ditching his program, or he may be
ditched. But nobody knows."
Pipes lauded President Bush's determination to
not rush into any summit negotiations with the
Soviet Union at the present time.
"That's just right," Pipes said, adding, "Reagan
acted on his own personal relationship with Gor
bachev. I think that's a bad way to make policy.
Bush is not doing that, he's not going to rush into
anything."
Pipes emphasized to his audience of 20 that the
United States should not rush into any changes in
military policy in reaction to ostensibly conciliatory
gestures like the withdrawal of Soviet troops from
Afghanistan.
Citing Soviet military history, Pipes said the
Soviets may be "withdrawing from aggressive po
sitions, but they've done that before. Even with
Afghanistan, Soviet military deployment is un
diminished. I'd have real confidence in a policy
change if there is a reduction in their defense budget
— but Washington doesn't see it."
Consistent with his past arguments against
detente, Pipes said, "I've always maintained that
Soviet foreign policy is a function of the political
and economic systems in place. I'm not satisfied
that the system has changed substantially enough
to justify (reciprocal) American troop withdrawal
They must change the system."
