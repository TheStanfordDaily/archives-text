# Ujamaa case ends without charges
## Cole: Two freshmen did not violate Fundamental Standard 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
The University will not bring
charges of Fundamental Standard
violations against the two fresh
men who in October defaced a
poster in a racially offensive man
ner at Ujamaa House, Stanford's
black theme house.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole, who is responsible for inves
tigating possible violations of the
Fundamental Standard, an
nounced her decision in a state
ment released yesterday.
Cole's decision effectively ends
the investigation of the events at
Ujamaa. She told The Daily yes
terday, "As far as those two kids
and their behavior is concerned,
this is intended to close the lid."
But while freshmen Ben Dugan
and Gus Heldt face no further
punishment from the University,
Cole's four-paragraph decision
says that their actions have
"raised complex questions" about
free expression and that "some of
my answers are tentative and need

the scrutiny of
others."
Cole s decision
could be preced
ent-setting in
what has become
a wide-ranging
disssion about
free speech at
Stanford that was
sparked by the

Ujamaa events. At issue has been
whether offensive expression that
is protected by the First Amend
ment can be held to violate the
Fundamental Standard.
"The students' actions in
Ujamaa House constituted a form
of expression that is protected
both by University policy and
practice and by the First Amend
ment," Cole's statement con
cludes.
This is in agreement with a
paper released this week by Stan
ford's Legal Office, which argued
that the Fundamental Standard
should not override the First
Amendment.
Vice President and General

Counsel John Schwartz, who co
authored the Legal Office's paper,
said yesterday that the paper was
not binding on Cole and its release
was not timed to influence com
munity response to Cole's deci
sion.
Cole said that in coming to her
decision she studied the Legal Of
fice's paper along with a paper

by Philosophy Prof. John Perry
and graduate student C.R.
Douglas, which advocated making
some offensive speech a Funda
mental Standard violation. She
said she also studied the Univer
sity report on the Ujamaa incident
and the policies of other univer


Cole
sities.
Ujamaa Resident Fellow Mi
chael Britt said yesterday that
Cole's decision would not come as
a surprise to Ujamaa residents.
"Our students expected that.
They won't be surprised, and nei
ther am I," Britt said.
University President Donald
Kennedy said at yesterday's Fac
ulty Senate meeting that Cole had
informed him of her decision, but
he offered no further comment.
Dugan and Heldt, white resi
dents of Lagunita Court,
anonymously drew a derogatory
caricature of a black man on a
poster and hung it near a black
resident's door. After admitting
fault at a meeting of Ujamaa res
idents, they were removed from

the house and have since been
living in a guest room on campus.
The two were found to have
violated the Residence Agree
ment's requirement of showing re
spect to others living in Univer
sity housing, Assoc. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Norm Robinson an
nounced later. In a Jan. 9 letter,
he notified Dugan and Heldt that
their punishment would be
banishment from University
housing during fall and winter
quarters. They will be allowed to
petition Robinson to re-enter the
housing system spring quarter.
Dugan and Heldt had no com
ment when reached last night.
