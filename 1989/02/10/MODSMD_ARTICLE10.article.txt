# Faculty Senate will vote on bulletin board closing
## 
### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
University President Donald
Kennedy announced yesterday to
the Faculty Senate that the fate
of an electronic bulletin board
charged with carrying racist jokes
will be decided with a vote at an
upcoming senate meeting.
The controversial board con
tains a file called "rec.hum
or.funny," which was shut down
in early January by Director of
Academic Information Resources
Ralph Gorin. Shortly afterward,
more than 50 computer science
experts at Stanford criticized its

closing.
After calling the shutdown a
"tough issue . . . and not one that
is answered by the law," Kennedy
said the file would "stay removed
until the faculty considers
whether to replace it."
A faculty member had already
placed the issue on the senate's
agenda, Kennedy said. He did not
specify who this person was or
when the bulletin board's status
would come up for a vote.
Kennedy praised Gorin's han
dling of the affair. He said that
Gorin "had to take a lot of heat"
for "an administrative decision
which fell to him."
