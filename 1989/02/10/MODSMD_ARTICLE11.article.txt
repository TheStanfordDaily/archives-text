# Prof, links homeroom with home life

In a KZSU interview Tuesday
night, a Stanford Education pro
fessor warned that teachers
must develop innovative ap
proaches to combat failures in
the California educational sys
tem.
Michael Kirst, also co-director
of Policy Analysis for California
Education, explained that
several factors outside the for
mal education system contribute
to schooling problems.
He emphasized that educators
should participate in "inter
professional education," which
would create a stronger partner
ship between government, busi

ness and organizations
concerned with nurturing
children.
According to Kirst, children
are presently helped only if their
problems fall into specific
categories. Kirst criticized this
approach because most problems
cannot be so easily characterized
and are instead the result of di
verse sociological trends.
Instead of having one place to
turn for help, many children are
sent back and forth between
various agencies, Kirst said, add
ing that because of the massive
amounts of red tape involved no
one group is fully aware of the
problem.
"We only get in when it's a
dire emergency; we are very poor

on prevention, and the service
system for kids is fractured,
fragmented," Kirst said.
"So all of these people go out,
having no sense of the needs
across the sectors, the homelife
and all of that, and each of the
institutions has its charge to do
something specific, but nobody
is in charge of a child who has
multiple needs or problems that
interact with each other," Kirst
added.
He also called for teachers and
students to develop closer rela
tionships. To this end, he advo
cated more freedom on the
individual school level. Kirst rec
ommended that class sizes be
reduced as much as economically

feasible. Likewise, he suggested
that children retain the same
homeroom teacher over a num
ber of years.
Kirst said, "Most kids, after
all, are not a statistic. Education
still operates like the steel in
dustry in the 1950s ... I think
we need new models of union
cooperation."
When asked about govern
ment's record with regard to
children and education, Kirst
praised Bill Honig, State super
intendent of California public
schools. But he criticized Gover
nor Deukmejian for being too
preoccupied with fiscal policy
and for largely ignoring the
school system.
