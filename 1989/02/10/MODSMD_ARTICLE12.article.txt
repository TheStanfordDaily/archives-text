## Bush addresses joint session of Congress 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Bush, charting a course for
his new administration, proposed
more money for domestic pro
grams and restraint of the Pen
tagon budget last night as he sum
moned the Democratic Congress
to work with him to "ensure a
better tomorrow."
In a well-received, 50-minute
address to a joint session of
Congress, the president vowed to
proceed with caution in his
dealings with Soviet leader Mik
hail Gorbachev. Still, he added,
"We will not miss any opportunity
to work for peace."
Bush devoted most of his speech
to domestic issues, though, as he
sketched the outlines of a $1.16
trillion budget. He called for $2.6
billion in reductions from Presi
dent Reagan's Pentagon spending
plan and modest increases in se
lected domestic programs such as
education and the environment.
He repeated his longstanding
vow of no new taxes.
Less than one month on the
job, the new president echoed the
campaign of 1988 with his decla
ration that he wants to be an
education president, wants the
death penalty for drug kingpins
and favors a cut in the capital
gains tax. 112
He made a notable bow to the
environmentalists with a call to
suspend three oil leases; and an
other to the anti-abortionists with
his call for an increased tax break
for parents who adopt a child.
He called for a society "free
from discrimination and bigotry"
and threw a bouquet in the di
rection of Democrat Jesse Jackson

when he said — as Jackson did
to kids in the inner cities — "Keep
hope alive."
Above all, he summoned the
Democratic Congress to join with
him in solving the deficit problem.
"The people didn't send us here
to bicker," said the new president.
"It's time to govern."
Bush also voiced his personal
support for making Puerto Rico
the nation's 51st state and called
on Congress "to take the neces
sary steps to let the people decide
in a referendum."
And he said he would set up a
new Task Force on Competitive
ness, chaired by Vice President
Dan Quayle. Saying, "The most
important competitiveness pro
gram of all is one that improves
education in America,"he traced
a number of schooling initiatives.
"I don't propose to reverse di
rection," he said. "We are headed
the right way." Nonetheless, he
proposed a string of initiatives
that signaled an end to some of
the restraints set by the Reagan
administration.
Bush received a standing ova
tion when he entered the House
chamber, packed with members
of the heavily Democratic
Congress, the Supreme Court, his
Cabinet and staff and guests. Mrs.
Bush joined in the applause from
her seat in the gallery.
The president shook hands with
several lawmakers as he made his
way down the center aisle on his
way to the speaker's rostrum.
Among the guests seated promin
ently on the floor were John
Tower, his confirmation as Sec
retary of Defense in jeopardy.
