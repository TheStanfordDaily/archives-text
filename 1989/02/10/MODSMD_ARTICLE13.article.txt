# North to face trial
## Court denies appeal to drop charges 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
federal appeals court denied a Jus
tice Department attempt yester
day to stop Oliver North's Iran-
Contra trial on national-security
grounds, but the Bush adminis
tration vowed to continue trying
to put the proceeding on hold.
Possible airing of state secrets,
as the former National Security
Council aide defends himself, has
threatened all along to scuttle the
trial. Two major charges against
North were dropped last month
for that reason.
Assistant Attorney General Ed
ward Dennis said "the risk to na
tional security would be signifi
cant" under current rules laid
down by the trial judge. He said
the government would lack control
over "disclosure of very sensitive,
classified information."
"It would be a complete crap
shoot," Dennis said.
He said the government could
seek reconsideration of the ruling
by the appeals court or go directly
to the Supreme Court.
Dennis, who heads the Justice
Department's criminal division,
spoke with reporters after the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
refused to block the trial's start.
Last night, the department said
it will ask the three judges on the
appeals court panel to reconsider
its decision this morning.
"They had before them a lot
more" material from independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh "than
they had from us," said depart
ment spokesman Loye Miller.
Walsh said the department doesn't
have the authority to intervene in
such a fashion and he opposes the
Justice Department's attempt to
block the trial.

Miller also said the appeals
court had before it the order from
the North case trial judge, who
earlier in the day rejected the Jus
tice Department's request to stop
the proceedings.
By the time the appeals court
acted, U.S. District Judge Ger
hard Gesell had already sent the
newly picked jury home for the
weekend with instructions to
return, ready for swearing in, at
9:30 a.m. Monday.
In a two-sentence order, the ap
peals court dissolved its tempo
rary stay of the proceedings, say
ing it was denying the depart
ment's motion to stop the trial
"substantially for the reasons"
cited by Gesell. The judge had
ruled that the attorney general
did not have authority to inter
vene in the prosecution, which is
being handled by Walsh.
Two hours earlier, not having
heard from the appeals court,
Gesell had sent the jury home,
saying he had to "close up shop"
until Monday because of the gov
ernment appeal.
"What we are going to do is
shut down, catch up on our sleep,"
he said.
The Justice Department had ap
pealed a Gesell ruling that depart
ment officials could not routinely
censor classified information
before it was presented in court.
Gesell ruled that the attorney
general's only authority to enter
the case at this stage is to take
the drastic step of affirming in
an affidavit that disclosure of cer
tain classified information would
damage national security.
Under that provision, the court
would be required to order North
not to make the disclosure.
