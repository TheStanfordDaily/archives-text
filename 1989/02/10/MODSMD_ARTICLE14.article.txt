# Iran, Iraq to begin negotiations
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
The foreign ministers of Iran and
Iraq will hold direct peace talks
today for the first time with
Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar acting as mediator, top
U.N. and Iranian officials said.
Iran's foreign minister, Ali Ak
bar Velayati, arrived at U.N.
Headquarters yesterday evening
for a reception sponsored by his
country's U.N. Mission.
Asked whether he plans to take
part in direct three-way talks with
Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz
and the secretary-general, he told
The Associated Press: "That is
our expectation."
Other top U.N. officials said on
condition of anonymity that the
U.N. chief would ask the two to
begin talks with him today, after
he meets with Velayati in the
morning.
"That is what Mr. (Perez) de
Cuellar invited us to do," said
Velayati.
Aziz said yesterday he is ready
for talks with Velayati in an effort
to break the deadlock in the peace
talks.
"That's what we agreed to have;
the question of the place is not a
problem," said Aziz, who met with

Iran is 'bargaining
in human flesh.'
— Tariq Aziz

Perez de Cuellar yesterday.
Velayati and Aziz have met
before for peace talks in Geneva
and New York, but have not held
face-to-face talks before. They and
their aides went to separate rooms
after an initial appearance at a
conference table for photogra
phers.
"Unfortunately, those meetings,
which were called 'direct talks,'
were fruitless to a great extent,"
Aziz told reporters.
"I cannot define them as real
direct talks. The other side chose
to debate on those meetings in
stead of negotiating the matters
that need to be negotiated in order
to reach a comprehensive peace
between Iran and Iraq."
The two Persian Gulf neighbors
went to war in September 1980.
They agreed to a cease-fire that
went into effect last August.
Responding to news that Iran

said it will release 260 sick and
injured Iraqi prisoners of war in
a few days, Aziz told reporters
that Iran should release more
than that. He accused Iran of
"bargaining in human flesh."
About 100,000 POWS are held
by both sides, with Iran holding
about twice as many as Iraq.
Both parties have expressed op
timism and a willingness to talk,
but have given no sign they are
ready to budge from their incom
patible positions.
Iran believes that the cease-fire
that took effect Aug. 20 is com
plete, and that Baghdad and Teh
ran should move on to the next
points in Security Council Reso
lution 598, the 1987 U.N. peace
plan.
That would entail withdrawal
of armies to the border, exchange
of prisoners of war, and holding
peace talks leading to a negotiated
settlement.
Iraq still occupies about 260
square miles of Iranian territory.
Baghdad says the cease-fire is
not yet legally in place because
Iran has not yet yielded its right
to search ships in international
waters of the gulf for war material
bound for Iraq.
