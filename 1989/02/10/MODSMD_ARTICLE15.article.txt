Paper admits Soviet anti-Semitism
MOSCOW (AP) — A Soviet newspaper ac
knowledged yesterday that officials in this coun
try have discriminated against Jews for decades
and that this practice has led to "the moral
damage of all society."
Sovetskaya Kultura, or Soviet Culture, carried
a nearly full-page article on anti-Semitism in the
Soviet Union, a nation which long has denied
Western charges that it discriminates against
Jews.
"It is finally time to ponder the actual reason
why tens of thousands of Jews have renounced
their Soviet citizenship and left for other coun
tries, including Israel," the newspaper said in an
article signed by historians C. Rogov and V.
Nosenko.
"Because of the emigration of thousands, even
tens of thousands, many Jews who didn't intend
to leave the motherland encountered problems
in obtaining education and jobs."
The newspaper implied that officials treated
all Jews as if they would soon be leaving, and
Soviets have long looked on emigres as traitors
abandoning their homeland.
"Limits were secret but enacted without trou
ble," the paper said.
It said the result of this discrimination can be
seen in hard numbers. The number of Jewish
students in higher education was cut in half, and

the traditionally high proportion of Jews in
specialty occupations also dropped, Sovetskaya
Kultura said. It did not give more specific figures
or the time periods for the decreases.
Although anti-Semitism in Russia dates at least
to the 19th century, when pogroms sent the first
wave of Russian Jewish emigres to the United
States, the article blamed the late Soviet leader
Josef Stalin.
Bush slated to visit Canada today
OTTAWA (AP) — Canadians believe President
Bush will do more than his predecessor about
acid rain, one of their main aggravations with
the United States, but they don't look for specifics
in his first visit today.
The preoccupation was illustrated by this com
ment in the Montreal Gazette: "U.S. President
George Bush is coming to Canada tomorrow, and
so are 8,767 tons of U.S. sulfur dioxide," which
causes acid rain.
Yesterday, however, in his first legislative in
itiative to Congress, Bush proposed spending
$120 million in fiscal 1990 to curb acid rain,
roughly $25 million more than that proposed by
the Reagan administration.
Bush's half-day trip for meetings with Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney will be his first outside
the United States as president.
