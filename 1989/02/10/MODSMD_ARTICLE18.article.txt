## Break for service 
### 
WHERE ARE YOU headed
to this spring break?
Mazatlan? Hawaii?
Jamaica?
Or a soup kitchen in San Jose?
Rather than just work on a
tan, 60 students are taking ad
vantage of the Public Service Cen
ter's four "alternative spring
breaks" this year.
Groups will work in soup
kitchens and homeless shelters in
the Bay Area and in Los Angeles.
Two other trips involve reforesta
tion work in Stanislaus National
Park in northern California and
landscaping on the Zuni reserva
tion in New Mexico.
While homelessness and the
plight of Native Americans are

not problems that a week's worth
of public service will solve, ad
dressing and exploring the issues
is a step in the right direction.
And if just two or three of the
60 participants come back with
a deeper understanding of the
problems, or a desire to devote
more than just a spring break to
public service, the trips will have
served a purpose.
Remember that devoting some
extra time to a cause outside
Stanford need not take place only
during spring break. The interest
is obviously there, now it's time
to follow the lead of the trips and
look into "alternative weekends"
or "alternative Friday after
noons" to make public service a
part of everyday life.
