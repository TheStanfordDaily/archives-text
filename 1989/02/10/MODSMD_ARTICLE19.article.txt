MICKEY LEVITAN grad
uated from the Business
School in 1985, but he's
not on Wall Street — he's in
Thailand working with Save the
Children.
For those graduates opting for
public service jobs, a recent pro
gram implemented by the Busi
ness School voids all or part of
tuition debts students incurred
while pursuing a diploma. Now
Levitan can afford to commit
himself to social work.
Levitan is the first Business
School graduate to take advan
tage of this debt remission pro
gram. Hopefully, other Business
School students will follow his ex
ample. Meanwhile, at the Law
School, 10 students are already
participating in a program
similar to the one at the Business
School.

But while similar federal grant
programs are open to Medical
School students, none of them are
presently enrolled in such pro
grams.
The programs send a message
to students that there is value in
public service and shifts the focus
of education from a pursuit of
material wealth.
But apparently not enough
graduate students are heeding
the message. Graduate schools
could do more to publicize the
plans and promote the idea that
public service is a worthwhile
pursuit.
Last month's "You Can Make
a Difference" conference, which
was co-sponsored by the graduate
schools, was a step in the right
direction. Keep sending the mes
sage. Just send it louder and
clearer.
