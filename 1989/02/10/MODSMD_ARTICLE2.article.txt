### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
In a prepared statement yester
day, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons joined Judicial Af
fairs Officer Sally Cole in an effort
to more fully explain Cole's deci
sion in the Ujamaa case.
The statement, released as a
companion to the decision, em
phasizes that the University
should not use punishment as a
means of forming policy on free

expression.
Following the emotional uproar
of the Ujamaa incident, student
leaders had demanded punish
ment of the freshmen responsible
for defacing the poster, but Lyons
and Cole urged caution in an area
where no specific policy has yet
been defined.
Their statement adds that re
sponse to and prevention of offen
sive expression is primarily de
pendent on attitudes in the com
munity, not on policies adopted
by the administration.
The statement was released to
The Daily after the deadline for
today's paper, but will be printed
in the Opinions section of Mon
day's edition. Copies of the state
ment will be distributed to resi
dent assistants today.
In part, the statement reads:
"No one is condoning offensive
speech or sees a proper place for
incivility on the Stanford campus.
There is also agreement on the
need to respond in some way to
students whose statements hurt,
offend or denigrate others. There
is disagreement, however, about
whether students should be

prosecuted through the Univer
sity disciplinary process for
making those statements."
Cole and Lyons go on to say
that though current University
policies on offensive expression
are unclear, the legislative proc
ess, not the disciplinary process,
should be used to address that
lack of precision in policy.
The ball, then, is in the Student
Conduct Legislative Council's
court. The SCLC, a student
faculty committee that formulates
disciplinary policy, should develop
a text that provides "clear guid
ance for evaluating behavior with
out being so specific as to stifle
flexibility and discretion," Cole
and Lyons say.
The statement adds that offen
sive expression may best be com
batted among the student popu
lation.
"Peer pressure to be decent, and

the embarrassment of peer disap
proval when one is not, have al
ways been the most effective
means of guiding and correcting
behavior ... As with the Stanford
Honor Code, the expectation and
need is that students respond to
unacceptable behavior, not neces
sarily that the behavior be re
ported for administrative action,"
the statement reads.
In their conclusion, Cole and
Lyons point out the danger of al
lowing "intolerance of in
tolerance" to prevent the free ex
change of ideas on campus.
"We should not expect that of
fensive expression will soon
vanish from the Stanford campus
... It would be, we believe, a
tragedy if we were to create in
advertently a campus climate that
discouraged candor, curiosity, in
teraction and the testing of ideas,"
they say.
