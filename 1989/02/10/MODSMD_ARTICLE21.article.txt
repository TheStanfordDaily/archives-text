## Postmortem on a hero 
### 
MICHAEL DUKAKIS is fading
fast from the collective memory
of the United States.
But before we consign Mike to the
dusty back shelf of American history,
let's take one last look at the man who
claims he turned Massachusetts into an
economic miracle.
The rosy facade is fading from view in
Boston, as the inevitable repercussions
of the Dukakis tax-and-spend frenzy rack
the fading state.
During his tenure as governor, Dukakis
managed to turn a $912 million budget
,surplus into a $630 million deficit.
Dukakis was forced to admit last week
that his state faces dramatic fiscal prob
lems, and he proposed a $730 million tax
increase next year, following closely on
the heels of a $300 million tax increase
this year.
Since 1983, state spending has risen
65 percent, twice the rate in the average
state and four times the average for the
federal government.
Dukakis dominates all his predecessors
in debt creation â€” in fact he has created
more debt than all previous governors
combined.
It would not be reaching to compare
this performance to that of Ronald
Reagan, who was often the focus of Du
kakis's criticism for fiscal irresponsibility.
Indeed, the only Massachusetts Miracle
is the fact that the state survived the
spending binge the governor initiated. He
hired 10,000 new state employees, and
paid for the expansion by taxing the very
industries largely responsible for the
growth experienced by the state since
1980.

Even more ludicrous, the main means
by which Dukakis proposes to raise the
revenue to bail out the strapped state is
by doubling the state capital gains tax
from five to 10 percent.
The move, if approved, would only fur
ther encourage innovative companies to
flee the state.
Ironically, the brief economic success
in Massachusetts probably resulted from
an influx of revenue from federal defense
contracts.
I am glad that Michael Dukakis is not,
and will never be, president of the United
States.
Recent developments in his home state
have shown very clearly that Dukakis's
true gift is the reckless spending of other
people's money while observing much
lauded personal frugality.
Strangely enough, Dukakis claimed
throughout the election that he was the
best suited of the candidates to deal with
the problem of the federal budget deficit.
He must have continually been looking
over his shoulder, hoping that the truth
would not become apparent about the
true character of the Massachusetts
Miracle.
Recently, Dukakis made the well
publicized announcement that he would
not be running for re-election as gover
nor.
This announcement was a skilled ma
neuver that allows the fallen hero of the
Democratic Party to save face. Mike prob
ably realizes that he would lose any elec
tion in his home state, and wanted to
avoid that embarrassing admission.
One cannot help but feel sorry for the
beleaguered man. After losing in a land-

slide to George Bush on election day, he
was faced with a reality that included
political and personal problems that
might have been avoided if the result
had been different.
To top it all off, his wife was recently
admitted to a treatment program for an
alcohol problem.
All this diatribe is interesting for one
reason. Michael Dukakis was one step
away from becoming president, albeit a
large one. History may not be too kind
to him, but it is worth wondering how
he might have been treated had he won
on that fateful day. . . .
