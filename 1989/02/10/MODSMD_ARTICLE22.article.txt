# Letters
## Ujamaa staff members have performed admirably 
### 
ROBERT WEISS, in a Jan. 31
letter, placed responsibility for
the Beethoven flier incident and
its aftermath on the Ujamaa House
staff.
In my view the Ujamaa staff —
Resident Fellows Michael and Rosalyn
Britt, the resident assistants, the
theme associates and Academic Coordi
nator Kathie Namphy — has worked
exceedingly hard to make Ujamaa a
welcoming and inclusive community
both at the start of and throughout
the year.
The residence evaluations which I
just reviewed indicate that most stu
dents, from a variety of backgrounds,
find Ujamaa a warm, comfortable and

supportive place to live.
The students who altered the Beetho
ven poster in a racially sterotyping way
take responsibility for what they did,
regret their actions and know now that
what they did was wrong and hurtful.
Stanford's practice has been to ad
dress residential problems and concerns
at the local level first; therefore, the
desire of the staff to handle the situa
tion in the house was understandable.
It might have been helpful if the
Ujamaa staff had consulted earlier
with the Residential Affairs office
about how the staff planned to deal
with the situation, but even if this
step had been taken, there is no way

of knowing whether or not events
would have unfolded differently than
they did.
Robert Weiss' letter attributes the
incident to the Ujamaa staffs failure
to prevent a sense of "us and them"
developing. Readers of the Ujamaa
factual report will have noticed that a
substantive discussion about the racial
identity of Beethoven was background
to the incident.
The staff had succeeded in promot
ing a feeling in the house that difficult
issues such as race identity could be
discussed openly. The environment for
such a discussion, however, might have
been even better.

More needs to be done by us in
Residential Education to prepare resi
dence staff to help residents have
broad-ranging, open, free and some
times heated discussions where stu
dents are comfortable arguing and
disagreeing.
Would a follow-up discussion of
Beethoven's ancestry, facilitated by a
member of the residence staff or aided
by the presence of a faculty member
(I'm thinking particularly of Prof.
Emeritus St. Clair Drake), have made
a difference?
