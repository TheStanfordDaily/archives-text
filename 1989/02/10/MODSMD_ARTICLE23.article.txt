# University should not deny housing to new fraternities
## 
### 
Reading the Feb. 7 article about
unhoused fraternities finally solidified
a suspicion I have held for a long
time.
Stanford's attitude toward fraterni
ties, as echoed by Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons, is one of un
friendliness and hope for abolition.
This policy can be interpreted through
many actions.
Stanford has acquired ownership of
all but one fraternity house. Some
were bought in difficult financial
times, and others were lured into new
houses in "clusters" â€” the fraternities
paid for half of their new home, but
the University kept the deed. This has
made it much easier for the University
to gradually cut the number of housed
fraternities in half.
The quota system has placed five

more fraternities in supposed danger,
one of which has had seven openings
in five years, an average of little more
than one per year. Normally this would
be considered a strong house, but
Stanford feels such houses are undesir
able.
Combined with Stanford's eagerness
to empty fraternity houses is its reluc
tance to fill them with new fraterni
ties. (Fraternal Affairs Adviser) Joe
Pisano stated in the Dec. 7 article that
there was a lack of demand for frater
nity housing among undergraduates,
but the interest shown by fraternities
Sigma Nu and Sigma Phi Epsilon in a
house has proven this to be untrue.
These two fraternities have good
reputations among the students body
and deserve to have a chance to prove
that they would be terrific housed fra
ternities as well.
While the Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity
have shown that they cannot attract
enough members, the Sig Eps have
proven that they can, and that they
want to live together. Their 54 mem
bers would easily fill the 51 spots in

the Alpha Delt house.
The effect on the Draw would still
be positive since these 51 or more
persons would be removed from the
Draw. The re-opening of Roble is an
other reason why the Draw does not
really need those relatively small num
ber of rooms.
The timing of Stanford's Rush is
another indication of the anti-fraternity
attitude. Stanford is practically alone
in this practice, as most universities
opt for Rush in the fall.
A fall Rush is not ideal for Stan
ford's more national student body, but
a spring rush discourages new mem
bers, and I cite myself as an example.
Freshmen must choose between a good
draw number, their year-long friends,
and a fraternity. A winter Rush would
eliminate these problems.
Pledging would not compete with the
Draw, and new members would have
more time to get to know their house
before moving in the next year.
Last but certainly not least in Stan
ford's anti-fraternity policy i9 the fact
that the University itself perpetuates

most of the negative stereotypes about
fraternities.
Dean Lyons himself called housed
fraternities "drinking clubs", but I
have yet to attend a party, fraternity,
unhoused fraternity, dorm or other
group that did not feature alcohol in
similar quantities.
The world has not changed its opin
ion of fraternities, the University has
simply chosen to ignore their positive
aspects in light of a scattered few
"negative" incidents such as small pic
tures of alcoholic teas on a flier. Fra
ternities have the same right to exist
as any other student group on the
Stanford campus.
