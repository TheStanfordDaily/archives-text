Don't forget about
freedom of speech
in fuss over fliers
I have never considered myself a
libertarian. I believe that individual
freedom is a value that must be tem
pered by other values to which we
sometimes assign higher priority.
However, Steve Levitsky and Nat
Sheidley's Feb. 6 letter causes me to
espouse the libertarian perspective in
order to reveal the ultimate implica
tions of their attitude: closed
mindedness and the denial of funda
mental civil rights.
The letter decries a recent flier ad
vertising a party sponsored by the
Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity. The flier,
they claim, objectifies women because
it portrays a woman in a bikini as the
focus of the flier. This image, they
conclude, reflects on the fraternity's
attitude about women, implies that the
members of AE Pi view women as
objects and perhaps that they even
condone rape.
Let's assume, for the sake of argu
ment, that the members of AE Pi in
tended to objectify women and that
they consequently offended certain per
sons who oppose such an intention.
This assumption leads us to a larger
question of whether or not the

proliferation of some idea or image
that offends some people should be
restricted or interdicted. In the case of
overt racism, I think that most people,
at least at Stanford, would agree that
the authorities should intervene and
censor such activity.
Yet the case of female objectification
is not so cut and dried. It is not a
universal value that female objectifica
tion is a dangerous evil. Anti
objectification is not even a universal
value in the feminist community.
Feminists have long been divided
over the role and meaning of pornogra
phy. The bottom line of feminism, as I
have come to see it, is the equality of
men and women. The question of ob
jectification, from that perspective, is a
tactical rather than a strategic issue.
Classical feminist writer Simone de
Beauvoir argues that to be fulfilled as
human beings, women must achieve
"transcendence;" they must progress
beyond animality by destroying the
traditional roles and images of feminin
ity.
Some women who describe them
selves as feminists, on the other hand,
focus on the equality issue rather than
de Beauvoir's existentialist philosophy.
They argue that pornography is only
destructive to women in that it does
not equally appeal to the female com
munity as it does to the male sector.
In effect, they argue for equal rights
for women to be erotic and carnal.

My point is that objectification is not
a universal vice as is racism. It is just
not fair to equate the two. Certainly
the fact that the members of AE Pi
offended someone is a matter that
should be addressed through all possi
ble avenues, such as the Interfraternity
Council, Residential Education and the
individual parties themselves.
But to lambast the action as abhor
rent to the whole community misstates
the case. The logic of such an argu
ment, furthermore, can be devastating.
"I've learned the truth from Lenny
Bruce!" declare Simon and Garfunkel.
Consider what would happen if every
time somebody was offended we
violently condemned the offending par
ties. For one, we would be shutting
out voices that have a basic right to be
heard.
Secondly, we might find, somewhere
down the line, that those voices were
saying something valuable which we
simply could not appreciate at the
time. Jello Biafra, the lead singer of
the Dead Kennedys, was right when he
fought Tipper (wife of Senator Al)
Gore's crusade to restrict "offensive"
rock music lyrics.
"The music contained on this album
might be offensive," he quipped.
"Sometimes life can be that way."
If our goal here at Stanford is really
a democratic education — if we really
desire a spirit of open-mindedness and
a free flow of ideas — then we must

seriously question the logic of Levitsky
and Sheidley's complaint.
Remember that the ACLU that Pres
ident Bush condemns for its "leftist
agenda" is the same ACLU that
defends Ollie North's civil liberties and
the American Nazis' right to march in
Skokie, 111.
If you want to censor those fliers, be
prepared to accept the right of the
Moral Majority to ban Sports II
lustrated's swimsuit issue. Be prepared
to tear down Coppertone advertise
ments from highway billboards. Be
prepared to rip Calvin Klein ads from
the pages of Rolling Stone. Be
prepared to defy the Bill of Rights.
Remember that a free society
guarantees equal liberty for all of its
members, not just those who possess
the dominant viewpoint.

Sophomore, history
Ethnic studies post
should not hurt
other departments
We, members of the Issues Commit
tee of the Asian American Students
Association, would like to respond to a
point made by Kathryn Gillam, assis
tant dean of Academic Affairs, in a

Feb. 3 article on Asian American
Studies.
The creation of a billet for an Asian
American history professorate should
not mean the loss of a billet in an
other department, as Gillam claims.
The University administration should
not create a situation in which ethnic
studies in general is given a certain
limited number of positions, over
which the different communities of
color must fight. This is a divide-and
conquer tactic meant to pit us against
one another.
If "in principle" the University
believes in a truly multicultural educa
tion, of which Asian American Studies
is a part, then it will create a tenure
track position in Asian American his
tory — but not at the expense of an
other department.
