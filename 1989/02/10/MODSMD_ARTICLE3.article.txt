The University dropped several
fund-raising goals in its $1.1 bil
lion Centennial Campaign yester
day, announcing that efforts to
raise money for some projects had
been unsuccessful.
The Campaign will no longer
actively seek donations to finance
undergraduate housing, build a
Stanford theater or support the
Center for the Study of Language
and Information. These projects
have proved unpopular with Cam
paign contributors, and funding

for them will have to be found
elsewhere.
In place of*these efforts, the
University will try to raise more
money for several other programs
that had been targeted earlier, in
cluding undergraduate scholar
ships, graduate student fellow
ships. The University also added
a Meyer Library renovation to the
list of projects for which it will
seek donations.
The items appear on the Cam
paign's list of "featured objec
tives," which is distributed to po
tential donors who are asked to
select projects on the list they

would like to support.
The Centennial Campaign has
two major funding targets: $567
million for the special projects on
the featured objectives list and
$533 million in "ongoing support"
for normal University operations.
According to Campaign offi
cials, the ongoing support side of
the Campaign is ahead of
schedule, but the featured objec
tives side stands at $311 billion,
under its target.
The revised list of featured ob
jectives is an effort to improve
