The University dropped several
fund-raising goals in its $1.1 bil
lion Centennial Campaign yester
day, announcing that efforts to
raise money for some projects had
been unsuccessful.
The Campaign will no longer
actively seek donations to finance
undergraduate housing, build a
Stanford theater or support the
Center for the Study of Language
and Information. These projects
have proved unpopular with Cam
paign contributors, and funding

for them will have to be found
elsewhere.
In place of*these efforts, the
University will try to raise more
money for several other programs
that had been targeted earlier, in
cluding undergraduate scholar
ships, graduate student fellow
ships. The University also added
a Meyer Library renovation to the
list of projects for which it will
seek donations.
The items appear on the Cam
paign's list of "featured objec
tives," which is distributed to po
tential donors who are asked to
select projects on the list they

would like to support.
The Centennial Campaign has
two major funding targets: $567
million for the special projects on
the featured objectives list and
$533 million in "ongoing support"
for normal University operations.
According to Campaign offi
cials, the ongoing support side of
the Campaign is ahead of
schedule, but the featured objec
tives side stands at $311 billion,
under its target.
The revised list of featured ob
jectives is an effort to improve
fund raising in that area. Accord
ing to John Ford, vice president
in the Office of Development, "We
are concerned about the featured
objectives ... That's where we
should be focusing hard."
In a key change, the construc
tion of student residences has been
eliminated from the featured ob
jectives.
Unless the University decides
to spend unrestricted Centennial
funds on housing, the decision to
drop the residence objective
means that students will have to
foot the bill for future dormitory
construction.
Explaining the decision, His
tory Prof. John Wirth, vice
provost for academic planning and
development, told the senate that
the housing plans took a long time
to develop, no donors could
be found once the plans were
finished, and the reconstruction
of Roble Hall has caused debt
finance difficulties.
"We want to do it; we just can't

do it now," he said.
Replacing student housing in
the campaign's list of objectives
is a $5 million renovation of Meyer
Library. Meyer has "clearly
reached the point of obsolescence
... and needs to be upgraded,"
Wirth said.
A $10 million goal for building
a theater has also been dropped
as a primary objective. Wirth said
that this project was deferred be
cause the site is not yet ready,
operating plans are incomplete,
and no major donor could be
found. In the theater's place is a
$6 million target for an endow
ment of the director and staff of
Stanford's museum.
The $180 million objective for
building the Near West Campus
science and engineering facilties
remains unchanged. But John
Ford, vice president of the Office
of Development, told the senate
that only about $72 million has
been received for the Near West
project.
In contrast to the lackluster
support for construction, funds
for student aid have been pouring
in, Wirth said.
