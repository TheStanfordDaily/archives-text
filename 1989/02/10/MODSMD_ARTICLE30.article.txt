## Betting on a bovine beauty Crew team offers fun with cows 
### Amy Rosenfeld John Wagner Editorial staff 
The anxious audience rings the
field. Watching. Waiting.
The center of attention looks
slowly up, surveys the crowd and
glances back down at the grass.
But wait, she's making her
move. Her expression changes.
The crowd tenses. Will it be now?
Yes?
No. She is only chewing her cud.
Welcome to the fast-paced,
action-packed spectator sport of
Bovine Bingo. Saturday at 1 p.m.,
hundreds of otherwise sane Stan
ford students, faculty and staff
will situate themselves around the
perimeter of Wilbur Field to watch
and wait.
They will be watching Mrs.
Cloverdale, a comely area cow and
Bovine Bingo plaver extraor
dinaire. This weekend's bingo
Same is a fund raiser sponsored
y the women's crew team.
The team will divide the field

into 900 squares, each labeled
with a randomly generated num
ber between one and 900. Players
can place bets on a number for
$3 each.
More than one person can bet
on each square and the team has
sold more than 2,300 chances, ac
cording to team member Julie
Vanneman, a sophomore.
After all the bets have been
placed, Mrs. Cloverdale will be
turned loose in the field and the
nervous bettors will wait to see
on whose square Mrs. Cloverdale
decides to deposit her dung.
The people who placed their
bets on the lucky number will
share a $1,000 jackpot, Vanneman
said. Owners of surrounding
squares will be treated to consola
tion prizes including dinner, roses
and not-tubbing.
If you are coming to watch
Bovine Bingo, bring something to
amuse yourself ana your friends.
Mrs. Cloverdale "will probably
graze around a bit before she
drops her first pie," Vanneman

predicted.
This bovine beauty, who resides
at Chris True's Anchor Key Ranch
in La Honda, is no stranger to
the bingo circuit. Mrs. Cloverdale
appeared previously in this area
at a Palo Alto High School Bovine
Bingo game.
Mrs. Cloverdale will be arriving
at Saturday's game with her new
born calf of whom she is "very
protective" and an adult com
panion, Vanneman said.
