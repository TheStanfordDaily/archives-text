# Of Dollies, licorice and hashers: The Bug reveals all
## 
### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
After reviewing Sports Il-
25th Anniversary
swimsuit issue for the past hour
and-a-half, the Bug can only say
that he's sorry Quaker Oats man
Wilfred Brimlev wasn't featured.
Several people, many of whom
mysteriously have nearly identical
handwriting, have written with
questions about the Stanford
Band. The following query is a
conglomeration of some of those
letters.
Dear Bug,
I've been here for about five
weeks and every time I hear the
Band they play the same
songs. . .. Who on earth thinks of
the Dollies' routines? . . . Are they
supposed to be funny ? . . . Why
don't they lead cheers and really
work the crowd like USC's and
UCLA's pom-pom squads?
— The Citizens of Whoville
While your questions are mostly
understandable, we must remem
ber that, relatively speaking, the
Band is the nation's best col
legiate band. In fact, although no
such title exists, the Band has
held the International Collegiate
Niftiest Band Title for the last 24
years.
Consider the complete fool
hardiness of most school bands.

Few play more than one or two
non-marching band tunes. The
USC band members know only
one song, and it is comprised of
only three or four notes, depend
ing on whether or not they play
it correctly.
Most bands dress like true
dorks. Some have male members
in plaid skirts (e.g. Notre Dame).
The Bug was at South Bend for
last fall's Notre Dame-Stanford
football clash. In between excuses
for the embarrassment that was
their band, Notre Dame students
lauded the zany irreverence of
ours.
Of course, one must understand
the context in which these stu
dents were making their state
ments. At Notre Dame — where
there is not even a single co-ed
dorm — simply whispering some
thing mildly anti-authoritarian
late at night in a sound-proof
booth qualifies as irreverent and
dangerously insurgent.
As for cheerleaders — we did
have "cheerleaders" here last
year, who, despite their honest
and earnest efforts, did not
receive the most gracious welcome
from the student community.
And besides, if the USC and
UCLA pom-pom squads do "work
the crowd" like you say they do,
then I'm glad I've never been in
one of those crowds, if you know

what I mean. (If you do know
what I mean please write me and
tell me, because I'm not sure I do.)
Anyway, Band manager Jon
Sherman was very helpful in
answering your questions.
Concerning the lack of new
songs, he said, "It's kinda weird
but it seems that the music of
the '70s somehow adapted itself
a lot better to our instrumentation
than current music does."
However, he said the Band is
determined to update its reper

toire. "It's reached a point where
people are saying, 'Yes, it's high
time we had some new songs,'
and people do come with new
songs that thev are jazzed about
and want to play."

Sherman has put a few LSJUM*
Bers in charge of finding new
music arrangements. The Bug is
already working on adaptations
of "Sweet Child 0' Mine" and "My
Prerogative".
On to the Dollies, Sherman said
that only those very few classic
song routines, like the "William
Tell Overture" Wild West
shootout, remain basically the
same year to year. For most of
the songs, each new set of Dollies
choreographs original routines
that the group will perform
throughout its tenure.
Dear Bug,
Are the red "Twizzlers" really
licorice or ia licorice candy always
blackf
— Sam Beckett
Mary Lancaster, who works for
Leaf Incorporated, the makers of
the "Twizzlers" twin "Switzers,"
says that licorice itself is black,
but that red "Switzers" do have
a licorice base and then are
flavored with cherry and artifi
cially colored red.
Which brings us, I guess, to
"Good 'N Plenty," which is the

Bug's favorite candy. It's also how
he'd describe his sex life.
Of course, he'd be lying.
Incidentally, with which kind of
candy would you characterize
your sex life? "Bar None,"
"Mounds," "Zero," "M&M,"
"Good 'N Fruity," "Marathon
Bar" or "Butterfinger"?
And speaking of tasteless vul
garity. ..
Dear Bug,
Where does the term "hashing"
come from?
— B.F. Skinner
As it applies to University Food
Service, tne word hashing was
first used in the late '60s when
it became fashionable to get really
high before dealing with endless
vats of powder-based foodstuffs.
Actually, Kay Gaskin, an ad

ministrative assistant with Food
Services here at Stanford, said the
term was originated in the late
'40s or early '60s by student
workers searching for an identity
other than "Food Service
workers."
Although Gaskin said she does
not know where the students
came up with "hashing," the Bug,
upon further investigation, thinks
he does.
Page 1,037, Webster's Third
New International Dictionary,
Hasher: "A worker who feeds into
a hashing machine unmarketable
meat that may be used for by
products."
Gaskin said she thought the
term "hashing" was used only at
Stanford, so the Bug called a cou
ple of other schools to find out
whether or not they referred to
Food Service employees with spe
cific monikers.
However, after food service of
ficials at UC-Berkeley and Yale
could come up only with "food
service workers" or "pantry
workers." By then, I decided the
phone bill I was ringing up could
better be used up on a call home.
And so, the Bug's investigation
ended there. (By the way, my mom
says hi.)
Until next week, the Bug is
tokin'.

UCLA's pom-pom squads?
— The Citizens of Whoville
While your questions are mostly
understandable, we must remem
ber that, relatively speaking, the
Band is the nation's best col
legiate band. In fact, although no
such title exists, the Band has
held the International Collegiate
Niftiest Band Title for the last 24
years.
Consider the complete fool
hardiness of most school bands.

Few play more than one or two
non-marching band tunes. The
USC band members know only
one song, and it is comprised of
only three or four notes, depend
ing on whether or not they play
it correctly.
Most bands dress like true
dorks. Some have male members
in plaid skirts (e.g. Notre Dame).
The Bug was at South Bend for
last fall's Notre Dame-Stanford
football clash. In between excuses
for the embarrassment that was
their band, Notre Dame students
lauded the zany irreverence of
ours.
Of course, one must understand
the context in which these stu
dents were making their state
ments. At Notre Dame — where
there is not even a single co-ed
dorm — simply whispering some
thing mildly anti-authoritarian
late at night in a sound-proof
booth qualifies as irreverent and
dangerously insurgent.
As for cheerleaders — we did
have "cheerleaders" here last
year, who, despite their honest
and earnest efforts, did not
receive the most gracious welcome
from the student community.
And besides, if the USC and
UCLA pom-pom squads do "work
the crowd" like you say they do,
then I'm glad I've never been in
one of those crowds, if you know

what I mean. (If you do know
what I mean please write me and
tell me, because I'm not sure I do.)
Anyway, Band manager Jon
Sherman was very helpful in
answering your questions.
Concerning the lack of new
songs, he said, "It's kinda weird
but it seems that the music of
the '70s somehow adapted itself
a lot better to our instrumentation
than current music does."
However, he said the Band is
determined to update its reper

toire. "It's reached a point where
people are saying, 'Yes, it's high
time we had some new songs,'
and people do come with new
songs that thev are jazzed about
and want to play."

Sherman has put a few LSJUM*
Bers in charge of finding new
music arrangements. The Bug is
already working on adaptations
of "Sweet Child 0' Mine" and "My
Prerogative".
On to the Dollies, Sherman said
that only those very few classic
song routines, like the "William
Tell Overture" Wild West
shootout, remain basically the
same year to year. For most of
the songs, each new set of Dollies
choreographs original routines
that the group will perform
throughout its tenure.
Dear Bug,
Are the red "Twizzlers" really
licorice or ia licorice candy always
blackf
— Sam Beckett
Mary Lancaster, who works for
Leaf Incorporated, the makers of
the "Twizzlers" twin "Switzers,"
says that licorice itself is black,
but that red "Switzers" do have
a licorice base and then are
flavored with cherry and artifi
cially colored red.
Which brings us, I guess, to
"Good 'N Plenty," which is the

Bug's favorite candy. It's also how
he'd describe his sex life.
Of course, he'd be lying.
Incidentally, with which kind of
candy would you characterize
your sex life? "Bar None,"
"Mounds," "Zero," "M&M,"
"Good 'N Fruity," "Marathon
Bar" or "Butterfinger"?
And speaking of tasteless vul
garity. ..
Dear Bug,
Where does the term "hashing"
come from?
— B.F. Skinner
As it applies to University Food
Service, tne word hashing was
first used in the late '60s when
it became fashionable to get really
high before dealing with endless
vats of powder-based foodstuffs.
Actually, Kay Gaskin, an ad

ministrative assistant with Food
Services here at Stanford, said the
term was originated in the late
'40s or early '60s by student
workers searching for an identity
other than "Food Service
workers."
Although Gaskin said she does
not know where the students
came up with "hashing," the Bug,
upon further investigation, thinks
he does.
Page 1,037, Webster's Third
New International Dictionary,
Hasher: "A worker who feeds into
a hashing machine unmarketable
meat that may be used for by
products."
Gaskin said she thought the
term "hashing" was used only at
Stanford, so the Bug called a cou
ple of other schools to find out
whether or not they referred to
Food Service employees with spe
cific monikers.
However, after food service of
ficials at UC-Berkeley and Yale
could come up only with "food
service workers" or "pantry
workers." By then, I decided the
phone bill I was ringing up could
better be used up on a call home.
And so, the Bug's investigation
ended there. (By the way, my mom
says hi.)
Until next week, the Bug is
tokin'.

After reviewing Sports Il-
25th Anniversary

and-a-half, the Bug can only say
that he's sorry Quaker Oats man
Wilfred Brimlev wasn't featured.
Several people, many of whom
mysteriously have nearly identical
handwriting, have written with
questions about the Stanford
Band. The following query is a
conglomeration of some of those
letters.
