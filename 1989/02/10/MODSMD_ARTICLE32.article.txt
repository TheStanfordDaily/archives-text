## Hoops wins numbers game over WSU, 65-53 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
Sometimes statistics do lie. In
their 65-53 win last night, the
18th-ranked Stanford men's bas
ketball team outshot Washington
State 65.7 percent to 39.2, out
rebounded them 30-22, out-free
throwed them 18-7 and made the
same amount of turnovers. Yet it
wasn't until a 14-1 run late in
the second half that the Cardinal
pulled away from the Pacific 10
Conference's penultimate team
and won.

With the win, Stanford (18-5
overall and 10-0 at home) moves
to within one-half game of second
place UCLA, as its record in the
Pac-10 rose to 9-3. WSU remains
in ninth place at 7-12, 2-9.
Stanford trailed 32-31 at
halftime even though it shot an
astonishing 73.3 percent in the
first half. The Cardinal then al
lowed WSU to stay in the game
by hitting only three of its first
12 free throws in the second half.
And so it was when, with 6:47
remaining in the game, WSU
guard Harold Wright stole the ball
and drove in for a layup that cut
Stanford's lead to 48-46.

But Stanford held the Cougars
without a field goal over the next
5:55 to pull away.
Reserves played a big role in
the Cardinal's spurt, preventing
another nightmarish loss like last
year's 70-68 overtime loss to
WSU. A minute after Stanford
center Eric Reveno (18 points)
made one of two free throws,
backup guard Scott Meinert
canned a 3-pointer. It was the Car
dinal's only 3-point attempt of the
game and gave Stanford breathing
room for the first time.
Meinert then assisted Todd
Lichti, who had a game-high 20
points, on a slam dunk after an
other reserve, Bryan McSweeney,
blocked a shot from behind. That
made it 54-46 Stanford with 4:14
left.
The Cougars then got a free
throw after a technical foul was
assessed to the Stanford bench.
But that's all WSU would get until
there were only 52 seconds left.
After the technical foul, Reveno
sank two from the foul line after
missing four of his last six free
throws. Meinert banked a shot
after forcing a five-second
inbounds-violation on WSU, and
then after one of McSweeney's six
rebounds, Lichti took a pass from
teammate Howard Wright and
jammed it home with his left
hand, giving Stanford a 60-47 lead
with 2:05 left.
