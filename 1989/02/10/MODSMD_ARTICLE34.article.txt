# Substitutions provide a boost
## 
### Mark Rogoowsky Editorial staff 
With 16:20 left in the second
half, Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery replaced Andrew Vlahov
with Bryan McSweeney.
Five minutes and eight seconds
later, Montgomery removed Terry
Taylor from the game and in
serted Scott Meinert.
Montgomery has made those
substitutions dozens of times this
season, without attracting any at
tention. Last night, they seemed
just as innocent .. .
However, they may very well
have been the difference between
a 65-53 Cardinal victory and a
shocking upset at the hands of
the Washington State Cougars.
Though the duo only recorded
nine points in the half (five for
Meinert, four for McSweeney), it
was McSweeney's hustling de
fense and a certain 3-point bucket
from Meinert that pushed the
Cardinal over the top.
While McSweeney did bury a
pair of 19-footers, it was his
hustle, on a night where Stanford
seemed a bit sluggish, that
counted. McSweeney ran all over
the court: breaking up a pass here,
deflecting a ball off a Washington
State player there and blocking
shots elsewhere, to boot.
The 6-foot-6 senior forward also
grabbed five rebounds down the
stretch to help Stanford break
open a game that threatened to
go down to the buzzer.
Meinert helped shake up a Car
dinal offense that, while effective,
couldn't open the lead. With 5:08
on the clock and Stanford leading
49-46, Meinert let fly the squad's
first and only 3-pointer of the eve
ning.
Nearly three minutes later,
Meinert drove through traffic to
bank in a 3-foot layup. Stanford
58, Washington State 47.
Nineteen seconds later, Todd
Lichti's third slam dunk of the
evening iced the win.
