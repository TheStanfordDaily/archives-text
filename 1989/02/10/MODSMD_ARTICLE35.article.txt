# Women cagers close on Pac-10 title
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
It's all downhill from here.
In perhaps the most important
regular season game of the year,
the Stanford women's basketball
team overcame tough defense, a
vocal crowd and tight officiating
to prevail by a slender 69-65 mar
gin over Washington at the
Huskies' own Hec Edmundson
Pavilion.
The victory boosts Stanford
into a commanding position in the
Pacific 10 Conference, a full game
ahead of second place Washington
and almost out of the reach of
anv other contenders. The Cardi-

Women's Basketball
Cardinal 69, Huskies 65

nal has also solidified its position
as one of the top four teams in
the nation with a win in one of
the most difficult arenas to play
in.
The stakes were high, but Stan
ford won the bet.
"We're definitely excited right
now," an overjoyed Sonja Henning
said 20 minutes after the game.
"I don't think it's quite sunk in
yet."
While the team may have been
stunned, Henning was stunning.

Shooting 7-for-10 from the floor
and 4-for-4 from the free throw
line, the sophomore guard led the
team with 19 points, five assists
and four steals.
Henning also may well have
saved the game, a contest that
was close from tipoff to final buz
zer. With 57 seconds left, the
Huskies leading scorer, Yvette
Cole, notched her 22nd and 23rd
points with a pair of free throws
to tighten the score at 69-63 Stan
ford. The Cardinal got the ball,
but it was quickly stripped away
by the pressing Huskies.
The Dogs charged down the
court to convert, but Henning
stunningly stalled their plans.

Playing tough defense under the
hoop, Henning forced Washington
guard Jacki Myers to miss a layup
without drawing a foul. Henning
took the ball with :37 left.
An untimely traveling call
against Henning turned the ball
over to the Huskies, who were
pressed for time to score. Laurie
Merlino and Cole both missed 3-
pointers, and by the time Traci
Thirdgill was able to follow with
a layup for two the clock showed
a paltry :13 remaining.
Washington got two more shots
off but forward Raren Deden and
Merlino both missed deuces. With
time expired, there were no more
chances — the Cardinal defense
had prevailed.
Tough defense, in fact, charac
terized the game. While Washing
ton surprised no one with their
traditionally tenacious defense,
Stanford intensified its coverage
tenfold from last weekend s
Loyola Marymount-like scoring
festival against Arizona and held
the Dogs at bay.
The Cardinal also benefitted
from inspired post play.
Forward/center Evon Asforis came
off the bench to grab seven boards
(tied with foward Katy Steding
for the team lead), but it was
forward Trisha Stevens' 14-point
performance that made the big
gest difference.
"Trisha played an awesome
game," Henning noted. "She took
it to them no matter who was
guarding her."
Guard Jennifer Azzi, who fouled
out in the waning seconds of the
game, added 11 points to the ef
fort. Steding also tallied 11, in
cluding a huge 3-pointer in traffic
off an inbounds pass that put the
Cardinal ahead 61-57 with just
over three minutes left to play.
In all, it was an excellent
showing for the whole Cardinal
roster. "Everybody played well be
cause it was such a big game,"
Henning said. "It may not have
shown in the scoring, but every
body played well.
"From the tipoff to the buzzer,
we were determined to win," she
added. "We just continued to
fight."
