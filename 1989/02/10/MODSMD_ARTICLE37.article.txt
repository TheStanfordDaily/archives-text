## Grapplers face Bakersfield 
### 
Wrestling is unlike any other
sport.
There's no strung instru
ment or ball flying around. The
combatants use Ben Gay, not
overpriced Air Jordans. Indeed,
wrestling is as simple as two
guys on a mat trying to pin
each other; strength, wit and
style all enter into the equation.
It is sport in its most original
form.
For the wrestling fan, the
Cardinal wrestling team will
square off against Cal-State
Bakersfield in Maples Pavilion
at 7:30 p.m. in its last home
meet of the year.
Nationally-ranked stars
Steve Yarbrough (167 lbs.),
Steve Buddie (177 lbs.) and
Ron Perry (190 lbs.) will lead
Stanford against Bakersfield.
"Bakersfield is tough all the
way through," Stanford Coach
Chris Horpel said. "I kind of
got angry after [a loss to
Fresno State inl the last meet.
Hopefully, the wrestlers will
react. I at least expect a better
performance than the one we
gave against Fresno State."
Along with Yarbrough,
Buddie and Perry, other start
ing wrestlers include Dave
Nowick (118 lbs.), Mark For
man (126 lbs.), Josh Lisle (134
lbs.), James Dinette (142 lbs.),
Geoff Baum (150 lbs.), Matt
Nowlis (158 lbs.) and Trent
Smith (heavyweight).
"This is like our last mid
term before the final," Horpel
said. "It's the last time we can
really test ourselves before the
Pac-lOs."

Gymnasts travel to
Oregon State meet
Once again, balance is the
key.
Suffering from inconsistent
performances, especially in the
balance beam, the winless
Stanford women's gymnastics
team heads to Oregon State
tonight hoping to recover from
a disappointing loss at home
last weekend.
Though Stanford will also
face Minnesota and Boise State
at the meet, Oregon State will
be the team's main com pet i

tion. Oregon State scored a 188
at their last meet, while Stan
ford has yet to score above 184.
Not only will OSU enjoy a
home-court advantage, but also
a potential home crowd of over
5,000.
This is quite a challenge for
a Stanford squad struggling
with inconsistency and injuries.
A big factor in the recent home
loss was a mediocre perform
ance on the balance beam, an
event which the team considers
its main strength.
Injuries also plague the
team. Two of the team's top
gymnasts, Dina Amoroso and
Jennifer Bloom, will not com
pete in the all-around compe
tition while freshman Nicki
Kobrine, who has excelled in
all three competitions, will not
compete at all in light of a
recent ankle injury. Fortunate
ly, the team has a lot of depth,
and, as senior Sheri Evenson
said, the freshman are really
"picking up the slack."
