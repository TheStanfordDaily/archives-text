# Card nine set to battle Fullerton St.
## Stanford puts four-game win streak on the line in three-game series 
### Bruce Sarkisian Senior staff writer 
Last weekend the slumping Stanford
baseball team revived itself with a sweep
over nationally-ranked Loyola Mary
mount. Now the Cardinal is riding the
crest of a four-game winning streak and
hopes to perform a similar feat against
top-10 Fullerton State.
The team has shaken itself of its
early-season woes and started to regain
the sharpness and form of a two-time
defending national champion.
"I think we can play with any team
in the country. It's just a question of
how we play," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said.
The Titans will certainly not be an
easy opponent for the Cardinal. They
have an All-America catcher in Brent
Mayne, who Marquess coached at the
Olympic trials last year. Mayne batted
an impressive .393 last year and should
carry the offensive load along with
Ralph Ramirez (.331) and Rex Peters
(.330).
But perhaps the biggest story for
Fullerton State is who is not on their
roster this season. Earlier in the year
the Titans lost star pitcher Mark Beck
to an injury. Beck beat Stanford in the
College World Series last year.
One thing that Marquess has been
concerned about in the early season is
the team's defense. While he expects
some errors from newcomers to the
lineup, the veterans should not bobble
the ball so much.
Through the first six games, junior
shortstop Troy Paulsen, who has started
at that position since his freshman year,
had committed an uncharacteristic five
errors. In 69 games last year, Paulsen
committed only 17.
But Marquess worked the team hard
in practice this week, especially defen
sively. "We played well defensively [in
a 9-3 victory over UC-Davis Wednes
day!. [The players] put a lot of time
into improving it,"he commented.

Since it is so early in the season, the
Cardinal does not have a set lineup as
of yet. Only three players have a lock
on their positions: Paul Carey in right
field, Frank Carey at second base and
Paulsen at shortstop.
The rest of the lineup is up in the
air. Tim Griffin and Roger Burnett are
certain to play somewhere because of
the duo's torrid bats. Griffin was hitting
.444 going into the Davis game and
went 2-for-5 with 3 RBIs. Burnett was
also hitting .444 with 5 RBIs and went
1-for-l against Davis with 2 RBI.
Both Mike Eicher and Eric DeGraw
are currently struggling at the plate so
it is a tossup which one will start in
center field.
In left field, Brian Johnson is showing
signs of coming out of his slump, but
Steve Solomon will challenge him at
that position this weekend.
Marquess knows that Fullerton will
put its nine best players out on the

diamond and not having a set lineup
worries him. "It's a concern of mine.
I'm not sure who the best nine are.
From a coach's standpoint it's difficult.
The best nine may change from day to
day."he said.
Since the beginning of the season
Marquess has shown a tendency to let
his players be aggressive on the
basepaths. In the Davis game, he called
for a double-steal with runners at the
corners that resulted in a Stanford run.
But the Titans are a much better
team than the Aggies and Marquess
may not get far ahead enough to call
creative plays. "The score dictates what
you can do. We're going to be as ag
gressive as we can," Marquess said.
After last Sunday's victory over
Loyola Marymount, Paulsen said that
"you like to ride the good times as long
as you can. We feel that we can go down
there and beat Fullerton right now."
Let the good times roll.
