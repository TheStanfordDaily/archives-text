### 
TONIGHT — 7 p.m. at Titan Field, Tomorrow 1 p.m., Sunday 5 00 p.m.
LIVE ON ESPN — Sunday at 5:00.
RECORDS — Stanford 4-3, Fullerton State 1-1.
PROBABLE STARTERS — Stanford Stan Spencer (0-0, 2.77 ERA), Brian Keyser (0-0,
6 00) and Mike Mussina (1-1, 2 08) Fullerton Danny DeVille Huck Flenner and
Paul Johnson
SERIES — Stanford and Fullerton met six times in 1988, splitting the series. In postseason
play, however, the Cardinal won two out of three, knocking the Titans out of the
College World Series.
TITAN UPDATE — Fullerton was ranked in the top 10 by all three college baseball polls,
but suffered a blow when it learned that Mark Beck would not pitch in 1989 Look
for second team All-America catcher Brent Mayne (.393 in 1988) to carry the offensive
load.
CARDINAL UPDATE — Sophomore Mike Mussina will pitch the TV game on Sunday
In his last start Mussina's exploding fastball earned him 10 strikeouts and should be
even more baffling under the lights.
KEYS TO VICTORY — Without Beck, the Titans are probably not a top-10 team. They
beat Campbell State, but lost to a USC team that is closer to Stanford's ability. If
Spencer and Mussina pitch as well as they did last weekend, the Cardinal should
win both games that they start, and if Keyser can pitch well for five or six innings,
break out the brooms Over the last week, Stanford Coach Mark Marquess has worked
on the team's defense. The Cardinal is 3-1 in games where it committed fewer errors
than its opponents.
