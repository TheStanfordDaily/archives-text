# Divers may be difference against No. 3 USC
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
While most eyes will be focused
on the churning 25-meter pool
this Friday and Saturday at
deGuerre, two integral members
of the Cardinal squad will be con
tributing to the Cardinal cause
above the water.
Overlooked or forgotten by most
aquatic fans, Matt Frawley and
Mike Burton will be striving for
Stanford victories over Pacific-10
rivals USC and UCIxA today and
tomorrow just like their stroking
teammates. Only they never dive
into the lanes.
Instead, the two All-Pac-10
divers will be tallying up the
points from the one- and three
meter springboards at the other
side of the aquatic complex.
With accolades heaped upon
teammates Jay Mortenson, John
Witchel and Jeff Rouse, Frawley
and Burton quietly go their way,
anonymously aiding the Cardi
nal's winning ways.
But while helping the squad win

the conference title and placing
third at the national champion
ships last year, the two have also
made a name for themselves in
the world of NCAA diving.
In his three years on the Farm
Frawley has established himself
as the best in the West as well
as one of the top divers in the

nation. Not only did the native of
Westfield, N.J., sweep both boards
at Pac-10 Championships, he also
won both events at the zone E
qualifying meet and had two top
-20 placings at NCAA's for the
second consecutive year last
season.
Burton also made a splash dur
ing his first season as a Cardinal
last year. Although his specialty,
the platform, was not included in
collegiate swimming until this
year, he still placed on both
boards at the conference finals,
taking second in the one-meter
competiton and fourth in the
three-meter competition.
Although they are usually over
looked even in the name of the
team (swimming and diving is al
most always referred to as just
"swimming") the two competitors
feel they are, indeed, members of
the swimming family. Even
though practice sessions are held
separately, the divers feel they
contribute more than points to
the Stanford cause.
"There is some distance because

we're apart from them in training
but we're all looking for the same
goal so there is some sort of
bond," Frawley said. "The swim
mers are really good about sup
porting us in meets so we try to
keep up with what they're doing
and reciprocate."
While Frawley and Burton do
not feel overshadowed by their
more renowned teammates or the
prominence of Stanford swim
ming, they do believe the team
aspect of diving puts more pres
sure on divers competing in this
mentally demanding sport.
"When your're scoring points
for a team it's a different game
than at the national level. I'm so
nervous during dual meets and
championship contests because I
know I can let the team down,"
Burton said.
"In meets that are really close
we can make or break the con
test," Burton said. "USC is going
to be really tough for the swim
mers and diving is going to be a
big, big part of helping the team
win."
