# Smith's diversity propels swimmers

### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
If Leonardo da Vinci were
around today, he would be a Jody
Smith fan.
Smith, a sophomore, is the
Stanford swim team's renaissance
woman. Although she is consid
ered primarily a backstroker, so
far this season she has swum six
different events for the Cardinal.
And she hasn't even swum the
200-yard individual medley yet,
an event she swam at last year's
NCAA meet.
"I like the fact that I do a lot
of strokes," she explained. "It
makes me feel better about my
backstroke."
Smith has swum mostly dis
tance freestyle this season and,
in fact, she posted an NCAA qual
ifying time in the 500 freestyle
in the team's 95-45 win at Texas
last weekend.
Under Stanford Coach Richard
Quick's training program Smith
has been doing a lot of distance
training this season. "His pro
gram's working well for me,"
Smith said. "I like how he's put
ting me in with the distance
people some of the time. With free
and back, the training's kind of
similar.... (And) it gives me a
chance not to get bored."
Smith began swimming at age
eight when her family moved to
Portland, Ore., and her first meet
was definitely somewhat of an ad
venture. "The first time I showed
up, I showed up in a bikini. I
didn't know any better. The first
time I dove off the blocks I knew
I had to get a new suit or a new
sport. Fortunately I got a new
suit."
Since then, things have only
gotten better. She won nine
Oregon state high school titles and
competed at both the 1984 and
1988 U.S. Olympic Trials. Last

year she finished fourth in both
the 200 backstroke and the 200
individual medley at the Pacific
10 Conference Championships
and swam on the school record
setting 800 freestyle relay team
that finished third at last year's
NCAA meet.
This season, swimming the 500
freestyle instead of the IM, Smith
feels she is doing even better. "I
think I'm a little more confident
this year," she said. "Richard
brought a lot of confidence to the
team. Last year I'd get on the
blocks and hope to do a good time.
This year I almost know I'm going
to do a good time.
"It's kind of fun to have this
new event because I can improve
a lot. ... I've had two lifetime
bests (in the 500 freestyle) al
ready. Usually you have to wait
until NCAAs to get those."
In addition to Quick's training
program, Smith cites the high
level of competition every day in
practice as helping her a great
deal. "My club team at home,
there were 20 swimmers and I
was the only one who swam at
nationals," she said. "It's just so
wonderful to train at Stanford.

'The first time I
showed up (for a
swim meet), I showed
up in a bikini.'

It's a beautiful facility. . . .
There's always someone there to
push you. With our backstrokers
there are always three or four
that are swimming really fast
(that day). The competition comes
from each other."
Smith is hoping her hard work
will pay off with an NCAA ring.
"We're all really psyched for
NCAAs. . . . Last year the season
was good, although not as good
as this one, all the way through
Pac-lOs," she said. "Last year
NCAAs were bad. When we got
to NCAAs I went a second faster
in the IM (than she had ever
swum before). Then the whole
team went on a downward spiral.
It got harder and harder to swim.
"This year, the chances aren't
as good. Everyone is saying
Florida will win the NCAA title,
and Texas is good. But now we're
a team that's going to fight for
every point. . . . We're not going
to let anyone touch us out at the
end."
No matter what event it is.

individual medley at the Pacific
10 Conference Championships
and swam on the school record
setting 800 freestyle relay team
that finished third at last year's
NCAA meet.
This season, swimming the 500
freestyle instead of the IM, Smith
feels she is doing even better. "I
think I'm a little more confident
this year," she said. "Richard
brought a lot of confidence to the
team. Last year I'd get on the
blocks and hope to do a good time.
This year I almost know I'm going
to do a good time.
"It's kind of fun to have this
new event because I can improve
a lot. ... I've had two lifetime
bests (in the 500 freestyle) al
ready. Usually you have to wait
until NCAAs to get those."
In addition to Quick's training
program, Smith cites the high
level of competition every day in
practice as helping her a great
deal. "My club team at home,
there were 20 swimmers and I
was the only one who swam at
nationals," she said. "It's just so
wonderful to train at Stanford.

'The first time I
showed up (for a
swim meet), I showed
up in a bikini.'

It's a beautiful facility. . . .
There's always someone there to
push you. With our backstrokers
there are always three or four
that are swimming really fast
(that day). The competition comes
from each other."
Smith is hoping her hard work
will pay off with an NCAA ring.
"We're all really psyched for
NCAAs. . . . Last year the season
was good, although not as good
as this one, all the way through
Pac-lOs," she said. "Last year
NCAAs were bad. When we got
to NCAAs I went a second faster
in the IM (than she had ever
swum before). Then the whole
team went on a downward spiral.
It got harder and harder to swim.
"This year, the chances aren't
as good. Everyone is saying
Florida will win the NCAA title,
and Texas is good. But now we're
a team that's going to fight for
every point. . . . We're not going
to let anyone touch us out at the
end."
No matter what event it is.
