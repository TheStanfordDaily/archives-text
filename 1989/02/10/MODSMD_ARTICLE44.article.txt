# No. 5 spikers head south for grueling test

### John Kirks Staff writer 
Coming off its upset victory
over the Hawaii Rainbow-
Warriors, the Stanford men's
volleyball team hits the road
this weekend.
The Cardinal, after er\joying
a nine-day respite, will take the
court against three dangerous
Western Intercollegiate Volley
ball Association foes: Cal State-
Northridge, USC and UC-Santa
Barbara.
Tonight Stanford plays at Cal
State-Northridge, which is cur
rently 0-3 in WIVA play. On Sat
urday night the Carding runs
headlong into defending na
tional champion USC, and, on
the road, there may be no
tougher test for Stanford all
year. The Cardinal then heads
northwest into UCSB Gaucho
territory.
Although Cal-State
Northridge is 0-3 thus far, Stan-

ford Asst. Coach Ruben Nieves
insists that Northridge is not a
team to be overlooked. "They
may be 0-3, but all of those
losses came on the road. When
they get at home in front of
their fans, they are an entirely
different team."
Stanford Coach Fred Sturm
seems to agree with Nieves. "In
the WIVA this year, no matter
which teams are playing, things
always have a way of evening
out. When each game gets under
way, it is up for grabs "
Many WIVA fans might not
agree with Sturm, especially
when one of the teams involved
in a given game is perennial
power USC. Indeed, Stanford's
opponent on Saturday night is
no pushover, to say the least.
The Trojans are 3-1 at this point
in their WIVA season with their
only loss coming at the hands
of the UCLA Bruins, currently
the nation's top-ranked team.
The Cardinal will make its

final stop on this early-season
road trip when it plays at UCSB
on Monday afternoon.
With two tough offensive op
ponents on the horizon, the Car
dinal coaching staff has made
some adjustments in pre-match
preparation. "We let the second
teamers hit out of any formation
they want to," Nieves said. "The
purpose is to prepare the first
team for the diversified offenses
that they will be facing over the
weekend."
On the optimistic side for
Stanford, the team is almost 100
percent healthy for the first
time all season. Hitter John
Alstrom, out for the first three
WIVA games, has returned and
is "going at about 70 percent,"
according to Sturm. Setter Ryan
O'Hara, unavailable for the two
matches against Hawaii, is also
ready to go.
Indeed, Stanford will have to
be playing at or very near to
its peak to do battle with USC
and UCSB.
