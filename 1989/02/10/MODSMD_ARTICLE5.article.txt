# Letter from alums prompts a review of Alpha Delts' fate
## 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
Prompted by a Feb. 7 letter from upset
alumni, the University is reconsidering
the fate of Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity.
In response to a letter he received yes
terday authored by two Alpha Delt
alumni, Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said he will review the decision to
place the fraternity in this year's Draw.
Lyons, who was not a part of the Dec.
6 decision to revoke the fraternity's
housing privileges, called the alumni let

ter "thoughtful and searching, and one
that deserves attention."
The letter, representing about 10
alumni, questioned whether the frater
nity members were treated with "due
process" during the University's decision
making process.
Responding to the alumni's concern,
Lyons said, "If there is reason to undo
(the decision), it will be undone." He said
he would review the facts of the case
within a month, and is planning to work
with the alums once the case has been
thoroughly reviewed. Until then, the de

cision stands as is.
Lyons added that he would have given
equal attention to students if they had
first asked him to appeal the decision.
Claiming that they were not
forewarned of the University's decision
to take away the Alpha Delt's house, the
alumni said they were upset that "they
were not given an opportunity to work
with [administrators)" to avoid the
closing.
In the letter, the alumni said they were
also frustrated with the University for
not sending them any notification once

the fraternity's fate had been decided.
Lyons said he intends to investigate
whether the University did in fact send
out letters of notification to the alumni.
One prominent Stanford Alpha Delt
alumnus, Psychology Prof. Philip Zim
bardo, said he might also send a letter
to the University expressing his support
to keep the fraternity alive.
"They are the most heterogeneous fra
ternity in the whole University concern
ing ethnicity, race and openness," Zim
bardo said of the Alpha Delts. "They are
not an animal house."

The alumni letter was circulated to
Lyons, Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano and University President Donald
Kennedy.
Neither Kennedy nor Pisano had a
comment.
Although the alumni letter also ques
tioned the "moral commitment on the
part of the University to fraternities since
. . . the University solicited and raised
money to fund them," Director of the
Row Diana Conklin said the decision "was
carefully and painfully thought
out."
"The Alpha Delts had been
having problems for several years
in the past concerning quota and
membership. The quota problem
alone was sufficient to merit loss
of housing, but other factors were
also involved," she added.
According to Marshall Kyger,
Alpha Delt alumnus and co
author of the letter, the alumni
are investigating the legal binding
of their past contributions "be
yond a mere moral commitment."
As far as such threats in the
letter to withhold donations,
Lyons said he hears such state
ments "from time to time." Ac
cording to Lyons, a funding drive
in the 1960s raised money for
men's housing but fraternal
alumni were only partially respon
sible for the contributions.
Lyons said he was uncertain as
to any legal rights the alums may
have to the house.
