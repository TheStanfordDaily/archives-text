# Condom contest is coming up
## 
### Caitlin Liu Staff writer 
You are asked to evaluate some
thing by the way it tastes, smells
and appears. . . Is this another
food service questionnaire?
Highly unlikely, unless you also
judge what your dining hall dishes
up by its sensualness, comfort and
sense of security.
Beginning on Valentine's Day,
students at Stanford, UC-
Berkeley, UC-Santa Cruz, San
Jose State and Santa Rosa Com
munity College will have the op
portunity to test and rate
condoms for the third annual
Condom Rating Contest.
Organized by the Stanford

AIDS Education Project, the con
test aims to educate the Bay Area
college communities about safe
sex practices, said project director
Daniel Bao.
"People have so many miscon
ceptions and fears about con
doms," Bao said. "The rating
contest will hopefully show people
that — unlike men — not all con
doms are created equal."
"We hope to free people from
rubber oppression by leading
them through the 'latex cur
tain,' " said Santa Cruz contest
coordinator Beowulf Thorne.
The event will take place from
11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. this Tues
day, Wednesday and Thursday in
White Plaza. Students will be able

to pick up free packets containing
eight condoms, an instruction
sheet and an official ballot.
"It's clearly not a scientific
study," Bao said. "Its main intent
is to raise common awareness."
The contest, originally designed
to combat the spread of AIDS,
has dramatically grown in scale.
According to Bao, this year's
contest will be larger than the
two previous contests combined.
Six thousand condoms were given
out at the 1987 event, and 17,000
were distributed last year. "This
year, we'll hand out 80,000," Bao
said.
All of the condoms for this con
test were donated by companies,
Bao added.
