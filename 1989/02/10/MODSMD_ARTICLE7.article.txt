# Advising Center loses director
## Bern field leaves behind a 'student-oriented' system 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
It had been more than two
weeks since her official depar
ture as director of the Under
graduate Advising Center. Yet,
as Audrey Bernfield assessed
the state of academic advising
at Stanford, she gave the im
pression that her heart had not
drifted far from her job.
On several occasions during
an hour-long interview with The
Daily, the tables turned, with
Bernfield abandoning her role
as interview subject and embrac
ing the more familiar role as an
academic adviser to a reporter
who also happens to be an un
declared sophomore.
In a few weeks, Bernfield will
move to Boston. Merton
Bernfield, her husband and a

professor in Stanford's Human
Biology program, has been ap
pointed to a prestigious medical
professorship at Harvard Uni
versity.
The move East, Bernfield
said, is a "wonderful opportu
nity" for her husband. Although
she does not have specific work
plans yet, she said she is excited
about the change as well.
Bernfield said that after set
tling in Boston, she would like
to do some volunteer work for
Planned Parenthood, adding
that she is deeply concerned
that the Supreme Court may
overturn Roe v. Wade, the his
toric decision legalizing abor
tion.
Bernfield officially left the
UAC Jan. 20, which, she quickly
pointed out, was both the dead
line for signing winter quarter

study lists and Inauguration
Day. "Ronald Reagan and I left
the same time," she said, "but
I think I actually did more than
he did."
From passive to active center
Four years ago, Bernfield was
appointed director of what had
formerly been the Academic In
formation Center. According to
Bernfield, the center she in
herited was a "passive,
information-giving office,"
aimed primarily at providing
pre-professional counseling.
"There was not a huge out
pouring of student interest in
the lAC," Bernfield explained.
"Most people graduated without
ever having heard of it unless
they were pre-med."
"The center had always given outstand
ing pre-med advice," she added, "but it
didn't do much of anything else."
Upon assuming the directorship of the
UAC, Bernfield said she sought to estab
lish a more "student-oriented outreach
center" which would attempt to actively
provide students with the information
and support they needed during their
years at Stanford.
Under Bernfield, for example, an
"early-warning system" has been estab
lished to seek out freshmen who are
having problems in their first chemistry
or math courses before their difficulties
escalate.
"Schools like Stanford traditionally fig
ure if you're bright enough to get in here
you don't need any help," she said. "We
have bent over backwards to realize that
the brightest and best need a lot of help
because these are big decisions kids are
making."
'You can major in anything'
According to Bernfield, the UAC "is
not a passive place . . . Somebody's going
to ask you a question about 'why' and
'what' and open your eyes to the fact
that there are other things to think about
than financial rewards."
Bernfield said too many students arrive
at Stanford with a predetermined major
and career path. "Kids come in and they
know about being a doctor or a lawyer
or an investment banker," she said. "It's
our job to say, 'Hey, there's a big world
out there. There are more majors than
economics and biology.'
"I think very many people are (eco
nomics) majors who shouldn't be. They
think that that's the only route to busi
ness. But there are plenty of human bi
ology and classics and English and art
history majors who are investment bank
ers."
The UAC is based upon the philosophy
that "you can major in anything and get
a job," Bernfield said.
If the UAC can relieve students' ap
prehension about the job market awaiting
them after graduation, the center is doing
its job, Bernfield said. "The biggest gift
we can give a student is freeing them
from the concern about what lies after
Stanford."

As an adviser, Bernfield said she tries
to help students get in touch with their
real interests. "What you try to do is
point out some things that look obvious,"
she said. "Ask students really what they
want to do and give them validation for
doing what they want to do."
According to Bernfield, regardless of
one's major, having attended Stanford
benefits the job-hunter. "People like to
think that Stanford doesn't make too
many poor choices [in admission] and
there must be something about you that's
worth looking at."
Attacks on the center
Despite what Bernfield and her col
leagues at the UAC view as remarkable
progress over the past four years, the
advising system at Stanford often came
under attack during Bernfield's tenure.
In a survey conducted last spring, 68
percent of the graduating seniors labeled
Stanford's academic advising "poor" or
"fair." Subsequently, an editorial in The
Daily April 7 asserted that the UAC had
"yet to address some fundamental prob
lems that plague the program."
The editorial claimed the advising pro
gram was plagued by poorly trained fac
ulty advisers and indifference to un
declared sophomores and juniors.
A second Daily editorial on July 19
charged that "the University's advising
system was almost as full of holes as
Palm Drive" and "must be revamped."
While Bernfield said she has found
such criticism to be frustrating, she said
she "takes it in stride."
"I know what we do is valued, that
the students who use our services are
very pleased with them," she explained.
"For the most part, I think we have as
good of an advising system as exists
anywhere in the country."
Students must actively seek advice as
well, Bernfield said. "I think there is
significant attention paid to undeclared
sophomores. I do not think we can go
out and drag them into the office if they
don't want to come."
Toward committed freshman advisers
The poor evaluation of freshman adiv
sers on the most recent senior survey is
due to the fact those surveyed were fresh
men prior to the establishment of the
UAC and the reform of the freshman

advising program in 1985, Bernfield said.
In order to ensure that the faculty
advisers are willing and dedicated to the
work, they are all now strictly volunteers,
she said.
Before she assumed her post at the
UAC, however, each department was re
quired to provide a specific number of
faculty to serve as freshman advisers.
Under the old system, Bernfield said,
"Freshman advising was a twist-the-arm
program."
Consequently, freshmen would often be
assigned to advisers who told them, "I'm
here to be your adviser, but I don't want
to be here, and I'm not interested in

you," she explained.
"Those are the kids that answered the
last senior survey," Bernfield said.
The switch from required to voluntary
service of advisers has drawn out faculty
who are much more committed, Bernfield
said.
Freshman advising "can always be bet
ter, and there are a lot of advisers whose
necks I'd like to wring," Bernfield said.
"But, there are a lot of advisers who are
absolutely wonderful and bend over back
wards for students."
"You're not going to have a perfect
system when you have 250 people who
are all volunteers, and we can pay them

nothing."
Bernfield said she has wrestled with
the question of whether or not faculty
advisers should be paid for their services.
But advising groups tend to be much
larger at schools such as Princeton Uni
versity that do pay their advisers, thus
decreasing the opportunities for students
to meet the faculty members.
It is unlikely that "you can find a
Harvard freshman who has any faculty
that know his first name," Bernfield said.
Unrealistic expectations
According to Bernfield, many freshmen
have "unrealistic expectations" of the
form their relationship with their adviser
should take.
"Freshmen are just coming out of high
school where their adviser was a course
consultant, somebody that helped them
move around between the four subjects
that they needed to get into college with,"
she said.
Students should not expect their fresh
man advisers to be "walking course
catalogs," Bernfield explained.
"A lot of people think that the adviser
should be a friend. Some faculty are not
comfortable being friends. They're shy
people, they know their fields. They want
to spend time helping a student plan a
schedule or talk about their academic
career, but they're not interested in play
ing baseball in the dorms. I think it's
incorrect to ask them to."
In addition, students often have an er
roneous perception that they should be
assigned to an adviser who is specifically
interested in their area. "We have only
one person from economics who advises,"
she said. "There's no way to give every
kid who comes to Stanford saying they're
interested in economics an economics ad
viser,"
Also, advisers do not always espouse
the same philosophy the UAC follows.
Faculty advisers bring their own "certain
bias" to counseling students, she said.
"We can't train that out of them. I'm
a parent. I told my kids to go to college
and in anything. I believe that.
But we have advisers who are also parents
out there who are like the parents who
told their kids, 'I'm not paying for your
education if you're a philosophy major.' "

ure if you're bright enough to get in here
you don't need any help," she said. "We
have bent over backwards to realize that
the brightest and best need a lot of help
because these are big decisions kids are
making."
'You can major in anything'
According to Bernfield, the UAC "is
not a passive place . . . Somebody's going
to ask you a question about 'why' and
'what' and open your eyes to the fact
that there are other things to think about
than financial rewards."
Bernfield said too many students arrive
at Stanford with a predetermined major
and career path. "Kids come in and they
know about being a doctor or a lawyer
or an investment banker," she said. "It's
our job to say, 'Hey, there's a big world
out there. There are more majors than
economics and biology.'
"I think very many people are (eco
nomics) majors who shouldn't be. They
think that that's the only route to busi
ness. But there are plenty of human bi
ology and classics and English and art
history majors who are investment bank
ers."
The UAC is based upon the philosophy
that "you can major in anything and get
a job," Bernfield said.
If the UAC can relieve students' ap
prehension about the job market awaiting
them after graduation, the center is doing
its job, Bernfield said. "The biggest gift
we can give a student is freeing them
from the concern about what lies after
Stanford."

As an adviser, Bernfield said she tries
to help students get in touch with their
real interests. "What you try to do is
point out some things that look obvious,"
she said. "Ask students really what they
want to do and give them validation for
doing what they want to do."
According to Bernfield, regardless of
one's major, having attended Stanford
benefits the job-hunter. "People like to
think that Stanford doesn't make too
many poor choices [in admission] and
there must be something about you that's
worth looking at."
Attacks on the center
Despite what Bernfield and her col
leagues at the UAC view as remarkable
progress over the past four years, the
advising system at Stanford often came
under attack during Bernfield's tenure.
In a survey conducted last spring, 68
percent of the graduating seniors labeled
Stanford's academic advising "poor" or
"fair." Subsequently, an editorial in The
Daily April 7 asserted that the UAC had
"yet to address some fundamental prob
lems that plague the program."
The editorial claimed the advising pro
gram was plagued by poorly trained fac
ulty advisers and indifference to un
declared sophomores and juniors.
A second Daily editorial on July 19
charged that "the University's advising
system was almost as full of holes as
Palm Drive" and "must be revamped."
While Bernfield said she has found
such criticism to be frustrating, she said
she "takes it in stride."
"I know what we do is valued, that
the students who use our services are
very pleased with them," she explained.
"For the most part, I think we have as
good of an advising system as exists
anywhere in the country."
Students must actively seek advice as
well, Bernfield said. "I think there is
significant attention paid to undeclared
sophomores. I do not think we can go
out and drag them into the office if they
don't want to come."
Toward committed freshman advisers
The poor evaluation of freshman adiv
sers on the most recent senior survey is
due to the fact those surveyed were fresh
men prior to the establishment of the
UAC and the reform of the freshman

advising program in 1985, Bernfield said.
In order to ensure that the faculty
advisers are willing and dedicated to the
work, they are all now strictly volunteers,
she said.
Before she assumed her post at the
UAC, however, each department was re
quired to provide a specific number of
faculty to serve as freshman advisers.
Under the old system, Bernfield said,
"Freshman advising was a twist-the-arm
program."
Consequently, freshmen would often be
assigned to advisers who told them, "I'm
here to be your adviser, but I don't want
to be here, and I'm not interested in

you," she explained.
"Those are the kids that answered the
last senior survey," Bernfield said.
The switch from required to voluntary
service of advisers has drawn out faculty
who are much more committed, Bernfield
said.
Freshman advising "can always be bet
ter, and there are a lot of advisers whose
necks I'd like to wring," Bernfield said.
"But, there are a lot of advisers who are
absolutely wonderful and bend over back
wards for students."
"You're not going to have a perfect
system when you have 250 people who
are all volunteers, and we can pay them

nothing."
Bernfield said she has wrestled with
the question of whether or not faculty
advisers should be paid for their services.
But advising groups tend to be much
larger at schools such as Princeton Uni
versity that do pay their advisers, thus
decreasing the opportunities for students
to meet the faculty members.
It is unlikely that "you can find a
Harvard freshman who has any faculty
that know his first name," Bernfield said.
Unrealistic expectations
According to Bernfield, many freshmen
have "unrealistic expectations" of the
form their relationship with their adviser
should take.
"Freshmen are just coming out of high
school where their adviser was a course
consultant, somebody that helped them
move around between the four subjects
that they needed to get into college with,"
she said.
Students should not expect their fresh
man advisers to be "walking course
catalogs," Bernfield explained.
"A lot of people think that the adviser
should be a friend. Some faculty are not
comfortable being friends. They're shy
people, they know their fields. They want
to spend time helping a student plan a
schedule or talk about their academic
career, but they're not interested in play
ing baseball in the dorms. I think it's
incorrect to ask them to."
In addition, students often have an er
roneous perception that they should be
assigned to an adviser who is specifically
interested in their area. "We have only
one person from economics who advises,"
she said. "There's no way to give every
kid who comes to Stanford saying they're
interested in economics an economics ad
viser,"
Also, advisers do not always espouse
the same philosophy the UAC follows.
Faculty advisers bring their own "certain
bias" to counseling students, she said.
"We can't train that out of them. I'm
a parent. I told my kids to go to college
and in anything. I believe that.
But we have advisers who are also parents
out there who are like the parents who
told their kids, 'I'm not paying for your
education if you're a philosophy major.' "


Jim Roberts — Daily
Former head of the Undergraduate Advising Center Audrey Bernfield explains
that the best advice is often subtle.
It had been more than two
weeks since her official depar
ture as director of the Under
graduate Advising Center. Yet,
as Audrey Bernfield assessed
the state of academic advising
at Stanford, she gave the im
pression that her heart had not
drifted far from her job.
On several occasions during
an hour-long interview with The
Daily, the tables turned, with
Bernfield abandoning her role
as interview subject and embrac
ing the more familiar role as an
academic adviser to a reporter
who also happens to be an un
declared sophomore.
In a few weeks, Bernfield will
move to Boston. Merton
Bernfield, her husband and a

professor in Stanford's Human
Biology program, has been ap
pointed to a prestigious medical
professorship at Harvard Uni
versity.
The move East, Bernfield
said, is a "wonderful opportu
nity" for her husband. Although
she does not have specific work
plans yet, she said she is excited
about the change as well.
Bernfield said that after set
tling in Boston, she would like
to do some volunteer work for
Planned Parenthood, adding
that she is deeply concerned
that the Supreme Court may
overturn Roe v. Wade, the his
toric decision legalizing abor
tion.
Bernfield officially left the
UAC Jan. 20, which, she quickly
pointed out, was both the dead
line for signing winter quarter

study lists and Inauguration
Day. "Ronald Reagan and I left
the same time," she said, "but
I think I actually did more than
he did."
From passive to active center
Four years ago, Bernfield was
appointed director of what had
formerly been the Academic In
formation Center. According to
Bernfield, the center she in
herited was a "passive,
information-giving office,"
aimed primarily at providing
pre-professional counseling.
"There was not a huge out
pouring of student interest in
the lAC," Bernfield explained.
"Most people graduated without
ever having heard of it unless
they were pre-med."
"The center had always given outstand
ing pre-med advice," she added, "but it
didn't do much of anything else."
Upon assuming the directorship of the
UAC, Bernfield said she sought to estab
lish a more "student-oriented outreach
center" which would attempt to actively
provide students with the information
and support they needed during their
years at Stanford.
Under Bernfield, for example, an
"early-warning system" has been estab
lished to seek out freshmen who are
having problems in their first chemistry
or math courses before their difficulties
escalate.
"Schools like Stanford traditionally fig
ure if you're bright enough to get in here
you don't need any help," she said. "We
have bent over backwards to realize that
the brightest and best need a lot of help

system was almost as full of holes as
Palm Drive" and "must be revamped."
While Bernfield said she has found
such criticism to be frustrating, she said
she "takes it in stride."
"I know what we do is valued, that
the students who use our services are
very pleased with them," she explained.
"For the most part, I think we have as
good of an advising system as exists
anywhere in the country."
Students must actively seek advice as
well, Bernfield said. "I think there is
significant attention paid to undeclared
sophomores. I do not think we can go
out and drag them into the office if they
don't want to come."
Toward committed freshman advisers
The poor evaluation of freshman adiv
sers on the most recent senior survey is
due to the fact those surveyed were fresh
men prior to the establishment of the
UAC and the reform of the freshman

advising program in 1985, Bernfield said.
In order to ensure that the faculty
advisers are willing and dedicated to the
work, they are all now strictly volunteers,
she said.
Before she assumed her post at the
UAC, however, each department was re
quired to provide a specific number of
faculty to serve as freshman advisers.
Under the old system, Bernfield said,
"Freshman advising was a twist-the-arm
program."
Consequently, freshmen would often be
assigned to advisers who told them, "I'm
here to be your adviser, but I don't want
to be here, and I'm not interested in

you," she explained.
"Those are the kids that answered the
last senior survey," Bernfield said.
The switch from required to voluntary
service of advisers has drawn out faculty
who are much more committed, Bernfield
said.
Freshman advising "can always be bet
ter, and there are a lot of advisers whose
necks I'd like to wring," Bernfield said.
"But, there are a lot of advisers who are
absolutely wonderful and bend over back
wards for students."
"You're not going to have a perfect
system when you have 250 people who
are all volunteers, and we can pay them

nothing."
Bernfield said she has wrestled with
the question of whether or not faculty
advisers should be paid for their services.
But advising groups tend to be much
larger at schools such as Princeton Uni
versity that do pay their advisers, thus
decreasing the opportunities for students
to meet the faculty members.
It is unlikely that "you can find a
Harvard freshman who has any faculty
that know his first name," Bernfield said.
Unrealistic expectations
According to Bernfield, many freshmen
have "unrealistic expectations" of the
form their relationship with their adviser
should take.
"Freshmen are just coming out of high
school where their adviser was a course
consultant, somebody that helped them
move around between the four subjects
that they needed to get into college with,"
she said.
Students should not expect their fresh
man advisers to be "walking course
catalogs," Bernfield explained.
"A lot of people think that the adviser
should be a friend. Some faculty are not
comfortable being friends. They're shy
people, they know their fields. They want
to spend time helping a student plan a
schedule or talk about their academic
career, but they're not interested in play
ing baseball in the dorms. I think it's
incorrect to ask them to."
In addition, students often have an er
roneous perception that they should be
assigned to an adviser who is specifically
interested in their area. "We have only
one person from economics who advises,"
she said. "There's no way to give every
kid who comes to Stanford saying they're
interested in economics an economics ad
viser,"
Also, advisers do not always espouse
the same philosophy the UAC follows.
Faculty advisers bring their own "certain
bias" to counseling students, she said.
"We can't train that out of them. I'm
a parent. I told my kids to go to college
and in anything. I believe that.
But we have advisers who are also parents
out there who are like the parents who
told their kids, 'I'm not paying for your
education if you're a philosophy major.' "

Former head of the Undergraduate Advising Center Audrey Bernfield explains
that the best advice is often subtle.
It had been more than two
weeks since her official depar
ture as director of the Under
graduate Advising Center. Yet,
as Audrey Bernfield assessed
the state of academic advising
at Stanford, she gave the im
pression that her heart had not
drifted far from her job.
On several occasions during
an hour-long interview with The
Daily, the tables turned, with
Bernfield abandoning her role
as interview subject and embrac
ing the more familiar role as an
academic adviser to a reporter
who also happens to be an un
declared sophomore.
In a few weeks, Bernfield will
move to Boston. Merton
Bernfield, her husband and a

professor in Stanford's Human
Biology program, has been ap
pointed to a prestigious medical
professorship at Harvard Uni
versity.
The move East, Bernfield
said, is a "wonderful opportu
nity" for her husband. Although
she does not have specific work
plans yet, she said she is excited
about the change as well.
Bernfield said that after set
tling in Boston, she would like
to do some volunteer work for
Planned Parenthood, adding
that she is deeply concerned
that the Supreme Court may
overturn Roe v. Wade, the his
toric decision legalizing abor
tion.
Bernfield officially left the
UAC Jan. 20, which, she quickly
pointed out, was both the dead
line for signing winter quarter

study lists and Inauguration
Day. "Ronald Reagan and I left
the same time," she said, "but
I think I actually did more than
he did."
From passive to active center
Four years ago, Bernfield was
appointed director of what had
formerly been the Academic In
formation Center. According to
Bernfield, the center she in
herited was a "passive,
information-giving office,"
aimed primarily at providing
pre-professional counseling.
"There was not a huge out
pouring of student interest in
the lAC," Bernfield explained.
"Most people graduated without
ever having heard of it unless
they were pre-med."
"The center had always given outstand
ing pre-med advice," she added, "but it
didn't do much of anything else."
Upon assuming the directorship of the
UAC, Bernfield said she sought to estab
lish a more "student-oriented outreach
center" which would attempt to actively
provide students with the information
and support they needed during their
years at Stanford.
Under Bernfield, for example, an
"early-warning system" has been estab
lished to seek out freshmen who are
having problems in their first chemistry
or math courses before their difficulties
escalate.
"Schools like Stanford traditionally fig
ure if you're bright enough to get in here
you don't need any help," she said. "We
have bent over backwards to realize that
the brightest and best need a lot of help
because these are big decisions kids are
making."
'You can major in anything'
According to Bernfield, the UAC "is
not a passive place . . . Somebody's going
to ask you a question about 'why' and
'what' and open your eyes to the fact
that there are other things to think about
than financial rewards."
Bernfield said too many students arrive
at Stanford with a predetermined major
and career path. "Kids come in and they
know about being a doctor or a lawyer
or an investment banker," she said. "It's
our job to say, 'Hey, there's a big world
out there. There are more majors than
economics and biology.'
"I think very many people are (eco
nomics) majors who shouldn't be. They
think that that's the only route to busi
ness. But there are plenty of human bi
ology and classics and English and art
history majors who are investment bank
ers."
The UAC is based upon the philosophy
that "you can major in anything and get
a job," Bernfield said.
If the UAC can relieve students' ap
prehension about the job market awaiting
them after graduation, the center is doing
its job, Bernfield said. "The biggest gift
we can give a student is freeing them
from the concern about what lies after
Stanford."

As an adviser, Bernfield said she tries
to help students get in touch with their
real interests. "What you try to do is
point out some things that look obvious,"
she said. "Ask students really what they
want to do and give them validation for
doing what they want to do."
According to Bernfield, regardless of
one's major, having attended Stanford
benefits the job-hunter. "People like to
think that Stanford doesn't make too
many poor choices [in admission] and
there must be something about you that's
worth looking at."
Attacks on the center
Despite what Bernfield and her col
leagues at the UAC view as remarkable
progress over the past four years, the
advising system at Stanford often came
under attack during Bernfield's tenure.
In a survey conducted last spring, 68
percent of the graduating seniors labeled
Stanford's academic advising "poor" or
"fair." Subsequently, an editorial in The
Daily April 7 asserted that the UAC had
"yet to address some fundamental prob
lems that plague the program."
The editorial claimed the advising pro
gram was plagued by poorly trained fac
ulty advisers and indifference to un
declared sophomores and juniors.
A second Daily editorial on July 19
charged that "the University's advising
system was almost as full of holes as
Palm Drive" and "must be revamped."
While Bernfield said she has found
such criticism to be frustrating, she said
she "takes it in stride."
"I know what we do is valued, that
the students who use our services are
