# Advising Center loses director
## Bern field leaves behind a 'student-oriented' system 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
It had been more than two
weeks since her official depar
ture as director of the Under
graduate Advising Center. Yet,
as Audrey Bernfield assessed
the state of academic advising
at Stanford, she gave the im
pression that her heart had not
drifted far from her job.
On several occasions during
an hour-long interview with The
Daily, the tables turned, with
Bernfield abandoning her role
as interview subject and embrac
ing the more familiar role as an
academic adviser to a reporter
who also happens to be an un
declared sophomore.
In a few weeks, Bernfield will
move to Boston. Merton
Bernfield, her husband and a

professor in Stanford's Human
Biology program, has been ap
pointed to a prestigious medical
professorship at Harvard Uni
versity.
The move East, Bernfield
said, is a "wonderful opportu
nity" for her husband. Although
she does not have specific work
plans yet, she said she is excited
about the change as well.
Bernfield said that after set
tling in Boston, she would like
to do some volunteer work for
Planned Parenthood, adding
that she is deeply concerned
that the Supreme Court may
overturn Roe v. Wade, the his
toric decision legalizing abor
tion.
Bernfield officially left the
UAC Jan. 20, which, she quickly
pointed out, was both the dead
line for signing winter quarter

study lists and Inauguration
Day. "Ronald Reagan and I left
the same time," she said, "but
I think I actually did more than
he did."
From passive to active center
Four years ago, Bernfield was
appointed director of what had
formerly been the Academic In
formation Center. According to
Bernfield, the center she in
herited was a "passive,
information-giving office,"
aimed primarily at providing
pre-professional counseling.
"There was not a huge out
pouring of student interest in
the lAC," Bernfield explained.
"Most people graduated without
ever having heard of it unless
they were pre-med."
