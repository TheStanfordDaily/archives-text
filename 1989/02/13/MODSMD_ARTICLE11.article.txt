# Thursday's Child sets new record
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The
yacht Thursday's Child sailed tri
umphantly under the Golden Gate
Bridge yesterday, breaking by
eight days the New York-to-San
Francisco speed record set in
1854.
The 60-foot sloop crossed the
finish line at 12:32 p.m. and was
met by cheers and yells from hun
dreds of spectators. Thursday's
Child set sail Nov. 23 on a 14,500-
mile voyage that took it around
treacherous Cape Horn on the tip
of South America.
"I wouldn't do anything differ
ent, but I wouldn't do it again —
once is enough," said skipper
owner Warren Luhrs after he
stepped ashore.
Luhrs and the other two crew
members waved to the crowd after
bettering the 89-day, eight-hour
trip by the 229-foot clipper ship
Flying Cloud during the Gold
Rush.
The crew docked the 10-ton ves
sel at Blossom Rock, about two
miles from the Golden Gate, be
cause they said the submerged
point is where clipper ships used
to drop anchor.
About 80 ships were out on San
Francisco Bay to greet the modern
racing sloop, while other specta
tors gathered on the roof of Fort
Point and at the south tower of
the Golden Gate Bridge. A biplane
flew overhead trailing a sign that
read: "We love you TC."
Thursday's Child's entrance

into the bay was delayed for hours
by a four-knot outgoing tide and
by a lack of wind.
The crew tried everything, in
cluding putting out a large sail
called a spinnaker, but all its sails
drooped. Finally, under a bright,
cloudless sky the yacht was able
to sail under the Golden Gate.
Dozens of sailboats and power
boats had headed out the Golden
Gate for the occasion and the
Coast Guard sent a 95-foot cutter
and four utility boats to escort
the yacht into the bay and lessen
the danger of a spectator boat
accidentally ramming Thursday's
Child.
The yacht left from Sandy Hook
Bay, 18 miles south of New York
City, and arrived in San Francisco

after 80 days and 20 hours, said
Thomas Conroy, race timekeeper
at the St. Francis Yacht Club. He
said Thursday's Child broke three
other sailing records; New York
to the equator, set in 1856; New
York to Cape Horn, 1857; and
Cape Horn to San Francisco,
1854. The times and old records
were not immediately available.
In a ship-to-shore interview yes
terday, crew member Courtney
Hazleton said he had "that
coming-ho me feeling."
"It's kind of like a mixed bag
of emotions right now," said Haz
leton. "Both relief, letdown, that
the whole thing's over, and just
a general feeling of accomplish
ment."
