### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh and the prosecution in Oliver North's
Iran-Contra case agreed yesterday on more stringent
safeguards for classified material whose threatened
release delayed the trial.
Chief Justice William Rehnquist yesterday
granted a Justice Department request to delay
North's trial from today's scheduled start until Fri
day, when the full Supreme Court is scheduled to
consider the department's objections to the planned
release of classified material by North's defense.
Hours later, Thornburgh and independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh announced a motion had been filed
asking the judge in the case, U.S. District Judge
Gerhard Gesell, to impose more stringent safeguards
on North's use of classified material.
"The requested relief, if granted, would provide
necessary assurance that the Attorney General
would remain in a position throughout the trial to
protect against unauthorized disclosure of classified
information," the Justice Department said in a state
ment. Thornburgh and Walsh agreed that this
protection "does not interfere in any way with the
Independent Counsel's ability to carry out his
duties," said the statement.

If the proposal is approved by Gesell, the Justice
Department will ask the Supreme Court to lift the
stay immediately so the North trial may proceed,
according to separate statements issued by the de
partment and Walsh.
Walsh and the department filed a sealed motion
with Gesell "which requests that the district court
enter an additional protective order preventing the
release of classified information vital to U.S. na
tional security interests," the Justice Department
said.
North's attorneys, Brendan Sullivan and Barry
Simon, did not return phone calls to their business
answering service seeking comment.
Rehnquist yesterday ordered "that the trial
proceedings in United States versus Oliver North
be stayed" pending consideration by the full Su
preme Court on Friday.
A jury in the case was selected Thursday and
returns to court this morning.
Walsh, whose office is prosecuting North, had
opposed the Justice Department's efforts to delay
the trial and wanted to proceed immediately with
opening arguments, saying that national security
concerns had been amply addressed.
