# Khomeini's heir criticizes Iran
## Designated successor calls for critical self-examination 
### 
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - The
designated successor to Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini called for an
end to extremism in remarks pub
lished yesterday and urged Iran's
leaders to "make up for past mis
takes" that isolated the Islamic
republic.
Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Mon
tazeri's comments, published by
the official Islamic Republic News
Agency and Tehran's Abrar daily,
echoed recent calls by other
Iranian leaders for critical self
examination as the Iranian revo
lution moves into its second dec
ade.
Montazeri went further, how
ever, by questioning the official
doctrine that Iran won the eight
year war against Iraq.
"People in the world got the

idea that our business in Iran is
just murdering people," Mon
tazeri was quoted as saying in
criticism of the self-imposed iso
lation. He spoke in the holy city
of Qom on Saturday at the climax
of 10 days of celebrations marking
the revolution's 10th anniversary.
Montazeri, 64, has been increas
ingly critical of the revolution's
shortcomings and repeatedly has
called for a relaxation of its strin
gent religious, social and political
restrictions.
In another indication of a more
open political atmosphere, the
Iranian news agency reported yes
terday that Iran's only legalized
opposition party demanded that
the government allow opposition
newspapers and provide security
needed for open political activity.

It quoted Ibrahim Yazdi, an of
ficial of the Iran Freedom Move
ment Party, as saying the opposi
tion group is not opposed to the
rule of the Islamic clergy. "Pro
vided a free press, freedom of
gatherings and freedom of
thought, we will not turn our
backs," he was quoted as saying.
The group said it would partic
ipate in any open presidential elec
tions.
His hard-hitting comments fol
low unusually frank interviews by
other Iranian leaders, including
Parliament Speaker Hashemi Raf
sanjani and Chief Justice Musavi
Ardebili, in which they acknowl
edged that Iran's war strategy
was flawed and that U.S. inter
vention tipped the scales against
Tehran.
