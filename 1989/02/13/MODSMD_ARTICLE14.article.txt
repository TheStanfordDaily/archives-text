Moslems protest 'Satanic Verses'
LONDON (AP) — Salman Rushdie, born in
India to a Moslem family, has ignited fires of
protest among Moslems worldwide with his prize
winning novel, "Satanic Verses," a story about
the eternal conflict between good and evil.
The novel takes its name from the verses the
Prophet Mohammad removed from Islam's holy
book, the Koran, on grounds they were inspired
by Satan.
Moslem critics — whom Rushdie has called
fundamentalist extremists — say the book is blas
phemous and have protested from London to
New Delhi.
Yesterday, five people died and 65 were

wounded in Pakistan when police fired on a crowd
of protesters outside the U.S. Embassy who
demanded that the United States ban the book.
Brown to chair state Democrats
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Former Gov.
Jerry Brown, a two-time Democratic presidential
hopeful, says it feels good to be back in politics
after ending six years of self-imposed political
exile with election to a party job.
"It feels very good. It feels great. It's been six
years, but it feels like six months," Brown told
reporters after he won the chairmanship of the
California Democratic Party.
He defeated investment banker Steve Westly.
