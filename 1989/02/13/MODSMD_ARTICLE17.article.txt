Racist poster violated
Fundamental Standard
in letter, if not spirit

Students are expected to show . ..
such respect for order, morality,
personal honor and the rights of
others as is demanded of good
citizens.
— The Fundamental Standard
Almost a century ago,
Stanford's first president,
David Starr Jordan, artic
ulated a standard of behavior
that today's students are ex
pected to live by — or else they
must leave.
Posting a racist poster in the
University's black theme house
is not the mark of a "good citi
zen." The crude, ugly caricature
of a black Beethoven attacked the
dignity and self-respect of the
residents at Ujamaa House and
the black community at large.
The two freshmen responsible for
the racist act violated the 100-
year-old principles set forth by
Jordan.
Last Thursday, Judicial Affairs
Officer Sally Cole decided other
wise. Cole closed the Ujamaa case
for good by deciding that the
freshmen did not deserve to face
the charge of breaking the Fun
damental Standard.
Given the context of a Univer
sity legal paper released on Tues
day, Cole's decision comes as no
surprise. The statement, commis
sioned by University President
Donald Kennedy and written by
two Stanford attorneys, argues
that the University must uphold
the First Amendment"— even if
it means ignoring Fundamental
Standard violations.

Cole's decision, which states
that "the students' actions in
Ujamaa House constituted a form
of expression that is protected
both by University policy and
practice and by the First Amend
ment," falls right in line with the
Legal Office's philosophy
Cole was caught between two
seemingly contradictory facts.
Stanford must guarantee the
Constitutional right of freedom
of expression; however, the fresh
men's act still stands as a viola
tion of the Fundamental Stand
ard, in and of itself.
Cole decided not to prosecute,
and by so doing, leaned toward
a First Amendment interpreta
tion of the case. But the decision
also sent a final, frightening mes
sage to the community: Racism
does not threaten personal honor
nor is it fundamentally opposed
to this university's principles.
If Stanford's policy is based
both on the University's commit
ment to freedom of expression
and a basic level of acceptable
behavior, then this should be
spelled out. An amendment or
clarification that reconciles free
speech and the Fundamental
Standard should be formulated,
soon.
In an explanation of her deci
sion, Cole herself admits that the
current policies are "not as clear
as they can and should be." As
a result, her final interpretation
of the Ujamaa case — a pre
cendent-setting decision — is
open to misinterpretation.
Clearly, Stanford does not
mean to tolerate racist behavior.
But until a standard that can and
will be upheld is established,
doubts and fears about the Uni
versity's commitment to an edu
cation free from the horror of
racism are justified.
