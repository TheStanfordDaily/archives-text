## Reconciling civility with freedom of expression 
### 
IN MAY 1988, Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons said: "...
Conduct which seeks to or has the
effect of discouraging the full participa
tion in the life of this University by
any student on account of his or her
sex, race, color, religion, sexual orienta
tion or national and ethnic origin is in
violation of University principle and
policy. Such conduct cannot and will
not he tolerated."
• In September 1988, University
President Donald Kennedy, in a wel
coming address to new undergraduates,
said: "Bigotry is out!"
• In October 1988, Judicial Affairs
Officer Sally Cole announced that the
seven undergraduate men who held a
silent vigil at Otero House the previous
spring were not being charged with
Fundamental Standard violations.
• Also in October 1988, two fresh
men defaced a poster in Ujamaa House
in a racially offensive manner.
• In February 1989, a paper by Vice
President and General Counsel John
Schwartz and Associate Counsel Iris
Brest examined University policies and
practices in the area of free expression
and the student disciplinary system. In
reviewing the Ujamaa incident, the
authors concluded that an interpreta
tion of our policies consistent with
First Amendment principles leads to a
decision that the students' behavior is
not a violation of the Fundamental
Standard of student conduct.
• At about the same time, Philoso
phy Prof. John Perry and graduate
student C.R. Douglas published a paper
in which they concluded: "It seems
clear to us, both as a matter of com
mon sense and as a matter of the
clearly stated expectations of Univer
sity citizens by the relevant officers,
that the sort of behavior [that the two
freshmen who defaced the Ujamaa
posterl engaged in is a violation of the
Fundamental Standard."

• Also in February 1989, several
sexist fliers appeared on campus. Many
students, male and female, were of
fended, and plan to appeal to the
administration for an unambiguous
"flier policy."
• And most recently, Cole decided not
to file Fundamental Standard charges
against the two students in the
Ujamaa incident.
Are we schizophrenic or what?
First, no one is condoning offensive
speech or sees a proper place for un
civilly on the Stanford campus. There

is also agreement
on the need to
respond in some
way to students
whose statements
hurt, offend or
denigrate others.
There is disa
greement, however,
about whether
students should be
prosecuted through
the University
disciplinary process
for making those
statements. There
is also disagree
ment about
whether students
could be pros

ecuted, given Stanford's current poli
cies, practices and judicial case law of
the past 20 years.
There may also be disagreement on
whether current policy is clear about
the interplay between the University's
commitment to freedom of expression
and its expectation that students will
grant each other respect and civility.
We believe that current policies are

dents and the disciplinary process to
raise and address lack of precision in
policies. The legislative route exists for
that purpose.
The Student Conduct Legislative
Council needs to continue its work in
developing a statement of Interpreta
tions and Applications of the Funda
mental Standard, seeking a middle
ground where institutional policies
provide clear guidance for evaluating
behavior without being so specific as to
stifle flexibility and discretion. A draft
of the statement will be distributed for
community reac-

tion.
The University's
decision not to
pursue judicial
action in the
Ujamaa case
should not be seen
as an open invita
tion to incivility.
We see a need to
develop other ways
of responding to
the expression of
unacceptable
opinions — ways
that are neither
judicial nor legisla
tive.
Peer pressure to

be decent, and the embarrassment of
peer disapproval when one is not, have
always been the most effective means
of guiding and correcting behavior.
When Stanford students hurt or
offend each other, it is usually caused
by ignorance rather than malice. While
the victims and others grow weary of
pleas of ignorance, the problems would
be far worse were we dealing with
hate and malice.
Individually and collectively, we need
to be more ready to question the
problematic opinions and actions that
we observe. All of us need to sharpen

our ability to see our behavior through
the eyes of others and to try to avoid
the unintended affronts that can be so
hurtful.
Few of us are comfortable confront
ing our peers and associates and chal
lenging their views. These skills are
needed, though, in order that formal
discipline be a last resort rather than
the first appeal. The expectation and
need is that students respond to unac
ceptable behavior, not necessarily that
the behavior be reported for adminis
trative action.
Despite our best efforts, however, we
should not expect that offensive expres
sion will soon vanish from the Stan
ford campus. As we learn to recognize
and respond to offensive speech, we
need to temper our intolerance of
intolerance.
It would be a tragedy if we were to
create inadvertently a campus climate
that discouraged candor, curiosity,
interaction and the testing of ideas
through discussion and debate.
As we address these complex ques
tions, we need to tap our supply of
wisdom, moderation and respect for
the many values and goals that we
hold in common.
