# Stanford Jews, Arabs lodge complaints
## B'nai B'rith group withdraws letter 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
An inflammatory fundraising letter,
accusing Arab-Americans of "poisoning
the minds of our young people" on col
lege campuses, has been withdrawn by
the International B'nai B'rith organiza
tion after complaints from Stanford stu
dents and faculty.
The B'nai B'rith International Foun
dation is an organization dedicated to
fighting anti-Semitism and general dis
crimination nationwide.
The' letter, signed by former B'nai
B'rith President Seymour Reich, warned
against the growing influx of "Arab
money" into U.S. universities and
blamed Arab-Americans for "a
deliberate and well-organized campaign
to undermine the basic beliefs and
values of our young people."
"I was shocked when I first heard of
it," said Arabic Prof. Khalil Barhoum.
"What hurt most is that the source of
the letter was an organization that has
at least professed to dedicate itself to
fighting racism and anti-Semitism and
then perpetuates a form of anti-
Semitism against Arab-Americans."
B'nai B'rith Director of Communica

tions Arthur Shulman said the letter
was "a mistake" with no malicious in
tent behind it. In a formal statement
which appears on the Editorial page of
today's Daily, Shulum said, "The letter
in question was prepared for B'nai
B'rith by an independent contractor, and
the offending language slipped through
our approval process."
"We assume full responsibility for the
incident," he said. "We were careless
and we regret the result. The language
in the letter does not represent the views
of B'nai B'rith."
Stanford Hillel Director Rabbi Ari
Cartun, who received the letter a week
and a half ago, responded last week
with a formal complaint about the let
ter's racist overtones. The complaint
was co-signed by a number of students.
B'nai B'rith responded to this, and
other complaints from both Arab and
Jewish groups, by immediately halting
distribution of the letter and destroying
all remaining copies, Shulman said.
Cartun said, "Though the letter that
B'nai B'rith originally sent was an un
fortunate slip, nonetheless we are
pleased that as soon as they recognized
their error, they publicly retracted their
statement in writing to those who have

heard of it."
However, many were not convinced
that these apologies were sincere and
remained skeptical about whether the
letter was in fact a "mistake."
Barhoum said, "I also feel that they
have not come out clean . . . They have
not been straightforward about it." He
said B'nai B'rith has been trying to
"stonewall" and "divert blame" onto
their outside contractor for the letter,
instead of formally apologizing.
Sophomore Jack Khouri, organizer of
a student Arab-American group, said
"The president signed the document,
with his name underneath the letter
. . . I don't know if it was an oversight."
A Feb. 10 article in The San Jose
Mercury News reported that the letter
was read by "several people" at B'nai
B'rith, including Reich, according to a
spokesman who wanted to remain anon
ymous. "I don't know how carefully
[Reich] reads them," he said. "He has
admitted that he didn't read it carefully
enough."
Hillel Program Director Jocelyn Reis
man said, "The letter was carelessly
written and reviewed in a rush to get
the letter out. I'm sure they didn't read
it carefully."
