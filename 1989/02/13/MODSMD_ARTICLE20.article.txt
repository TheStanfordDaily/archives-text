## Black squirrels on dope 
### 
Recently, whether to remove one
form of animal life — feral (fetal?)
cats — from campus has been
heatedly debated.
Perhaps what the University says is
true, and euthanasia is a kinder alterna
tive than the slow starvation the cats
face when their student feeders go home
for vacations.
But even if the cats truly are being
saved from the rigors of Stanford life,
why are they the only ones targeted for
such salvation?
At least once a week I see a squirrel
crushed to death or severely injured by
a bicycle, and this event often occurs
despite the bicyclist's best efforts to avoid
it.
Even when a bike tire actually strikes
a squirrel, it will sometimes turn around
in confusion and be hit again, and the
bicyclist can only sit and watch.
The squirrels have become so used to
the activity around here that they seem
to have lost their instinct to avoid people.
Different people have different reac
tions to the kamikaze behavior of the
squirrels, and 1 have heard comments
ranging from: "Damn thing mucked up
my tires," to "Oh, my God! I killed a
squirrel!"
But even most people who have no
compunction about going out and shoot
ing deer or rabbits find that crushing a
squirrel is too inhumane for their tastes.
And people who have a hard time killing
a spider in their bathrooms find the sight
of a dead squirrel particularly unsettling.
I don't condone hunting unless the deer
are given comparable firearms with which

to defend themselves, but I don't hesitate
to squash a bug if it invades my space,
so I am in the middle of the two extremes.
I do, however, have a soft spot for squir
rels, and I wish something would be done
to save them.
The first stories I heard when I got to
Stanford were about the squirrels. At
least five different people had a legend
about why we're the only area to have
black ones. My resident assistant told me
that a Stanford scientist genetically en
gineered them.
Another source reported that spray
painting squirrels was part of a frater
nity's initiation ritual and a third said
all male squirrels are black, but that ours
are the only ones who come out during
the day.
I didn't believe either of the first two,
and I only half-believed the last one for
about a month, but I developed a fas
cination for the squirrelß all the same.
Maybe it's their big eyes, or the way
their tails twitch. Maybe it's just because
they're animals, and not obnoxious ones
like the Tresidder Union birds.
Whatever the case may be, I took to
following them when 1 was a freshman.
I might trail along behind one for over
an hour without noticing where it had
taken me, and I have ended up in every
imaginable campus location short of the
Green Library basement men's room.
I've been known to miss classes to
watch the squirrels pick up stray hot dog
buns, or climb up and down the same
tree ten times or chase each other from
one lawn to the next. It seems pretty
silly, I guess, and I have gotten some odd

looks from passers-by, but I don't mind.
Perhaps because I have had this squir
rel fetish for so long, I hate to see any
thing happen to them.
The whole situation is unfair both for
the squirrels and for the bicyclists who
have to deal with dodging them. No one
wants to hit the squirrels, I hope, but
when people are in a hurry they tend
not to look in all directions before forging
ahead.
The number of bicycle-bicycle and
bicycle-pedestrian collisions gives ample
evidence of the fact that not everybody
can be aware all the time, and when a
tow-fo-lhe-ground, suicidal rodent kind
of thing dives under your tires, it can be
a bit hard to avoid.
While I'm not recommending eu
thanasia for the squirrels, who can forage
for themselves better than any
feral/fetal/viral feline can, I do think that
something should be done. Short of equip
ping all University squirrels with body
armor, I can think of only a few solutions,
and only one seems really workable to me.
All of the squirrels should be tran
quilized and relocated to a place with a
natural environment similar to Stanford's
without the two-wheeled menaces that
abound here.
