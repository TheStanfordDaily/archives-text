B'nai B'rith letter
did not represent
opinions of group
In a Feb. 6 viewpoint, a B'nai B'rith
fundraising letter was cited for a racist
statement.
The Daily's readers should know
that the letter in question was
prepared for B'nai B'rith by an inde
pendent contractor, and the offending
language slipped through our approval
processes.
When we received a complaint about
the letter, it was withdrawn immedi
ately, and all remaining copies
destroyed. Our internal reviewing pro
cedure was changed. We acted as
quickly as we could.
We assume full responsibility for the
incident. We were careless, and we
regret the result. The language in the
letter does not represent the views of
B'nai B'rith.
Having said that, I should point out
that B'nai B'rith has a 150 year record
in the struggle against the defamation

of all peoples. For the writer to seize
upon the situation and compare B'nai
B'rith with the Klan and the Nazis
does violence not only to the reputa
tion of B'nai B'rith, but to the truth.

Rob Weiss' Feb. 9 letter' in The
Daily both angered and amused us. In
it, he makes the very valid point that
bigotry (in this case, sexism) works
both ways. However, in making his
argument, he trivializes the initial inci
dents that drew criticism and is forced
to invent examples that illustrate his
point.
Weiss begins by decrying the double
standard, saying that while we at
Stanford are "very sensitized to inci
dents including the objectification of
women," we "turn our backs on nearly
identical incidents involving men."

To his general point, we would note
that if the community were attuned to
sexist acts to the extent he suggests,
no offensive actions would ever occur
on campus. Dialogues such as these
are not designed to "unfairly showcase
a select few" but to help us all identify
our insensitivities and avoid our past
mistakes.
Weiss then attacks two fliers for our
"Bare Essentials Bash II" as an exam
ple of male objectification. Weiss com
plains that our Hans and Franz flier
"must be a blatant and dangerous ex
ample of the objectification of men's
bodies."
This flier, a takeoff on the two
popular "Saturday Night Live" charac
ters, showed the head, shoulders, and
forearms of two scowling muscular
men in T-shirts.
We sincerely doubt that two fully
clothed men can be said to strike "an
equally seductive pose as the woman
on the AEPi's flier," or that, as Weiss
seems to believe, Hans and Franz are
issuing a lurid call to women.
We can only assume that, as an
AEPi, Weiss was using sarcasm to
draw attention away from his own
group's predicament.

The second flier which troubled
Weiss accompanied his letter. Depicting
two individuals with legs intertwined,
the flier was attacked for reducing
them to objects of sexual desire.
After long and exhaustive debate in
which we considered controversial fliers
both from this party and the first
Bare Essentials Bash, we at Schiff had
decided that the original artistic nature
of the photograph might be interpreted
in just this manner.
That is why the flier was never cir
culated.
Last week, Weiss entered Schiff and
asked for a Hans and Franz flier. In
addition to that flier, he took one of
only three copies of a flier that we
never intended to release. His irrespon
sible action of submitting this flier to
The Daily does not advance the fight
against sexism.
Weiss makes a strong statement:
Exploiting sexuality can be a two-way
street. Ironically, he chooses to attack
Schiff using many of the same argu
ments dorm residents voiced in reject
ing potentially offensive fliers.

Weiss regrets error
I would like to offer my most sincere
apologies to each member of Schiff
House who may have suffered as a
result of a misunderstanding involving
the advertising of their "Bare Essen
tials Bash 11.
When I originally asked for the fliers
used to advertise the party, I explained
my purpose and was then given the
two fliers.
I had previously only seen and
planned to base my complaint on the
one depicting "Hans and Franz," but
because I was given both, I assumed
both had been circulated.
As it turned out, the one that ap
peared with my letter was never circu
lated outside of Schiff for the very
reason that it might offend people in
the community.
While I regret this misunderstand
ing, my original complaint was based
on the flier which was in fact circu
lated campus-wide and was clearly
guilty of objectifying men.

are not designed to "unfairly showcase
a select few" but to help us all identify
our insensitivities and avoid our past
mistakes.
Weiss then attacks two fliers for our
"Bare Essentials Bash II" as an exam
ple of male objectification. Weiss com
plains that our Hans and Franz flier
"must be a blatant and dangerous ex
ample of the objectification of men's
bodies."
This flier, a takeoff on the two
popular "Saturday Night Live" charac
ters, showed the head, shoulders, and
forearms of two scowling muscular
men in T-shirts.
We sincerely doubt that two fully
clothed men can be said to strike "an
equally seductive pose as the woman
on the AEPi's flier," or that, as Weiss
seems to believe, Hans and Franz are
issuing a lurid call to women.
We can only assume that, as an
AEPi, Weiss was using sarcasm to
draw attention away from his own
group's predicament.

The second flier which troubled
Weiss accompanied his letter. Depicting
two individuals with legs intertwined,
the flier was attacked for reducing
them to objects of sexual desire.
After long and exhaustive debate in
which we considered controversial fliers
both from this party and the first
Bare Essentials Bash, we at Schiff had
decided that the original artistic nature
of the photograph might be interpreted
in just this manner.
That is why the flier was never cir
culated.
Last week, Weiss entered Schiff and
asked for a Hans and Franz flier. In
addition to that flier, he took one of
only three copies of a flier that we
never intended to release. His irrespon
sible action of submitting this flier to
The Daily does not advance the fight
against sexism.
Weiss makes a strong statement:
Exploiting sexuality can be a two-way
street. Ironically, he chooses to attack
Schiff using many of the same argu
ments dorm residents voiced in reject
ing potentially offensive fliers.

Weiss regrets error
I would like to offer my most sincere
apologies to each member of Schiff
House who may have suffered as a
result of a misunderstanding involving
the advertising of their "Bare Essen
tials Bash 11.
When I originally asked for the fliers
used to advertise the party, I explained
my purpose and was then given the
two fliers.
I had previously only seen and
planned to base my complaint on the
one depicting "Hans and Franz," but
because I was given both, I assumed
both had been circulated.
As it turned out, the one that ap
peared with my letter was never circu
lated outside of Schiff for the very
reason that it might offend people in
the community.
While I regret this misunderstand
ing, my original complaint was based
on the flier which was in fact circu
lated campus-wide and was clearly
guilty of objectifying men.

B'nai B'rith letter
did not represent
opinions of group
In a Feb. 6 viewpoint, a B'nai B'rith
fundraising letter was cited for a racist
statement.
The Daily's readers should know
that the letter in question was
prepared for B'nai B'rith by an inde
pendent contractor, and the offending
language slipped through our approval
processes.
When we received a complaint about
the letter, it was withdrawn immedi
ately, and all remaining copies
destroyed. Our internal reviewing pro
cedure was changed. We acted as
quickly as we could.
We assume full responsibility for the
incident. We were careless, and we
regret the result. The language in the
letter does not represent the views of
B'nai B'rith.
Having said that, I should point out
that B'nai B'rith has a 150 year record
in the struggle against the defamation

of all peoples. For the writer to seize
upon the situation and compare B'nai
B'rith with the Klan and the Nazis
does violence not only to the reputa
tion of B'nai B'rith, but to the truth.

fliers never posted
Rob Weiss' Feb. 9 letter' in The
Daily both angered and amused us. In
it, he makes the very valid point that
bigotry (in this case, sexism) works
both ways. However, in making his
argument, he trivializes the initial inci
dents that drew criticism and is forced
to invent examples that illustrate his
point.
Weiss begins by decrying the double
standard, saying that while we at
Stanford are "very sensitized to inci
dents including the objectification of
women," we "turn our backs on nearly
identical incidents involving men."

To his general point, we would note
that if the community were attuned to
sexist acts to the extent he suggests,
no offensive actions would ever occur
on campus. Dialogues such as these
are not designed to "unfairly showcase
a select few" but to help us all identify
our insensitivities and avoid our past
mistakes.
