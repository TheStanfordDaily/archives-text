Amid speeches, musical

"Membership in the Club
House Association means

women," proclaimed The
Daily Palo Alto. Through
membership, "Every woman
will feel her active place in
the community life, and be
come a real part of the uni
versity she represents."
Thurs., Feb. 16, 1939
The Stanford Daily:
Journalist John Gunther
spoke in Memorial Hall
about Adolf Hitler's victory
in the "Peace at Munich."
"With the British and
French feverously rearm
ing," Gunther said, "it is
only too obvious that the sel
lout of Czechoslovakia was
not a guarantee of continen
tal peace, but has served to
bolster the Nazi position in
Europe."
Tues., Feb. 18, 1964
The Stanford Daily:
A panel including a Stan
ford professor of pharmacol
ogy, the chief of staff from

Commenting on the irony
of psychic changes caused by

Auditorium that "What was
once considered insanity is
now considered insight."
