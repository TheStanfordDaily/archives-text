## Austria Week brings Vienna a waltz away 
### Sophia Shing Staff writer 
Twelve years ago, a group of
students returning from the Stan
ford overseas campus in Vienna
organized the first Viennese Ball
to bring back some of the beauty
they had found in Austria's cap
ital city. Although the campus
closed two years ago, the resplend
ent Stanford tradition continues.
Saturday night's 12th-annual
ball at Roble Gym was the cul
mination of Austria Week, a week
of cultural events put on by the
Viennese Ball Committee. Accord
ing to senior Linly Ferris, co-chair
of Austria Week, the week is de
signed to introduce people to the
Viennese lifestyle.
Although the ball is probably
the best known everit of the week,
senior Laura Yansouni, theme as
sociate of Haus Mitteleuropa, the
Central European theme house,
says, "Future committees cannot
let the Viennese Ball degenerate

into just another prom."
Senior Ulrike Rothe, Austria
Week co-chair, says the week
"makes the whole event more com
plete. We wanted students to know
that people in Austria don't just
get dressed up and waltz around
all of the time."
The general fear of the organ
izers of Vienna Week is that, since
the closure of the Vienna campus,
the tradition and charm of the
city will be lost to Stanford.
Highlights of Vienna Week in
cluded a panel discussion called
"Vienna as an International City."
It addressed Vienna's tradition of
neutrality which allows it to serve
as a connection between East and
West.
"Heurige Abend," or evening for
wine tasting, simulated the at
mosphere of an Austrian pub.
Finally, to wrap up the week,
Haus Mitteleuropa was trans
formed Friday night into a "Gast
haus Mitt," an Austrian restau
rant serving a dinner of Austrian
delicacies.
