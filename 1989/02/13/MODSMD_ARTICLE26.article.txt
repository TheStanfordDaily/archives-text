# Meyer exhibit documents history of Viennese Jews
## 
### Sophia Shing Staff writer 
With Roble Gym still whirling from Sat
urday night's Viennese Ball, an exhibit on
display this month at Meyer Library serves
as a reminder that the history of Vienna
involves more than just waltzing.
Stanford is the only northern California
stop for "Heritage and Mission: Jewish
Vienna." an exhibit sponsored by the
Jewish Welcome Service of Vienna with the
support of the city of Vienna.
The exhibit, which will continue around
the nation after it leaves Stanford Feb. 28,
was created in Vienna two years ago to
mark the 50th anniversary of Adolf Hitler's
Anschluss, when Nazi troops marched into
Vienna.
Fifty-four panels of documents, photo
graphs and quotations recount the history
of Vienna's Jewish population from its es
tablishment in 1295 to the present.
Leon Zelman, a member of the Jewish

Welcome Service explains the significance
of the display on an introductory panel.
The exhibit "bears witness to the fact that
we have the will to re-establish a Jewish
community here in Vienna after the virtual
annihilation of the previous community by
the Holocaust," Zelman says.
Rabbi Ari Cartun, director of Hillel, the
Jewish student group, says the exhibit "al
lows people to confront the totality of Hit
ler's final solution and what it could look
like if it happened to any group."
Helmut Zilk, mayor and governor of
Vienna is quoted as saying, "No history of
Vienna would be complete if it did not
include an account of the city's Jewish
community which has perhaps done more
than any other group within the Austrian
capital to mold its cultural and intellectual
life."
A glance at the exhibit's guest book
revealed dozens of names from all over the
Bay Area.

was born and lived in Vienna until Hitler's
arrival in 1938, came to see the exhibit
and recall his past and those he had to
leave behind.
Deutsch's memories reflected the true
feelings embodied by the exhibit. In March
1938, Deutsch and his mother and brother
fled from Vienna leaving the rest of his
family behind, knowing that they were
going to be "transported to the concentra
tion camps and killed."
Before the Nazi regime, the situation of

Austrian Jews was "tolerable," Deutsch
said. "There was supposed to be liberty for
the Jews."
However, "there always was and there
always will be a latent anti-semitism which
persists," Deutsch said. "Austria is even
more anti-Semitic than Germany," he
added.
Nonetheless, Deutsch said he found it
"unbelievable" when the Austrians received
the German troops as though they were
their liberators
"Jews were outside of the law. The Nazis
would command them to clean the streets
with toothbrushes and they would have to
do it. Under Hitler, there was no way to
save yourself, because you were less than
even an animal. Animals were killed to be
eaten, but Jews were just killed to get rid
of them," Deutsch recalled.
Deutsch's wife, who is German, accom
panied him to the exhibit. "Will people
ever learn? What is all of this destruction
for?" she asked.
