## Card pushed by Huskies before winning in OT 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
Ironically, as the Stanford
men's basketball team struggles
to wins against second-division
schools in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, it is arriving as a legitimate
top-20 school.
Yesterday's 82-74 overtime win
over Washington before 7,500 at
Maples Pavilion is the latest in
this paradoxical pattern. The No.
18 Cardinal didn't play poorly
against the Huskies, who arrived
on the Farm in sixth place in the
Pac-10 with a 5-7 record, but
looked less than dominant com
pared to Washington's inspired ef
fort.

"For those of you who think we
did something bad, you're mistak
en," Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "Washington scared
the daylights out of me. . . .
They're an excellent basketball
team.
"All of a sudden, everybody
wants us real bad," Montgomery
added later. "We're finding people
play their best against us."
In other words, beating Stan
ford this year can make a school's
season, where in past years such
a win would have had problems
making the school's newspaper.
But reserve guard Scott
Meinert sunk two free throws
with 32 seconds remaining in
overtime to give Stanford a 78-74
lead, and prevented the"Wash

headlines from appearing in
Seattle. Free throws by Eric
Reveno and a slam dunk by
Howard Wright at the buzzer
f>unctuated the game with an ex
amation point.
"We got a little fortunate,"

Montgomery said. "But the one
thing we've done consistently all
year is we've made the plays when
we had to make them."
Stanford guard Todd Lichti,
who scored the winning basket in
Stanford's 71-69 squeaker over
Washington Jan. 12, took over the
game in overtime, scoring eight
of his team-high 19 points, to lift
the Cardinal (now 19-5 overall
and 9-3 in the Pac-10) to within
one-half game of second-place
UCLA.
"The difference between our
team and [Stanford], and Mike
(Montgomery) and I were talking
about this before, is Todd Lichti,"
Washington Coach Andy Russo
said. "It's as simple as that."
Washington's all-Pac-10 guard
Eldridge Recasner, who knows a
little about being a star player
himself, didn't argue the point.
"Todd came out in the overtime
and he just completely took over,"
said Recasner, who led everybody
with 23 points before fouling out
in the overtime period. "You could
see it in his eyes and in the way
he moved on the court that he
wanted it."
In the overtime period, Lichti
passed Reggie Miller of UCLA to
become the Pac-10's all-time
leading scorer in conference
games. Lichti now has 1,238
points in Pac-10 games, four more
than Miller and 16 more than Ar
izona's Sean Elliott.
It is best not to get too excited,
however, because Lichti and Stan
ford would not have been forced
into an overtime had it not been
for Stanford's inability to combat
a rarely-used zone by the Huskies.
Washington came out in its
usual mflti-to-man pressure de
fense when the game started, but
had to switch to a zone as Huskies

first half. According to Russo, it
was the first time Washington had
used the zone for more than a
couple of plays all season.
"If they came out shooting
well," Russo said, "we really
would have been up a creek."
But Stanford welcomed Russo
and the Huskies back to shore as
the Cardinal went into a scoring
drought. Washington outscored
Stanford 12-0 over a period of
6:26 covering the end of the first
half and beginning of the second,
taking a 38-36 lead.
Stanford guard Terry Taylor hit
a 3-point shot to give Stanford
the lead again with 17:17 to go
in regulation, but that was the
last shooting contribution the Pac
10's all-time leader in 3-point
goals provided.
"The zone hurt us way more
than it should have," Montgomery
said. "Normally when Taylor sees
a zone he licks his lips, and his
eyes light up, and it's over with."
According to Taylor, his poor
shooting (2-for-8 on the day) may
be due to fatigue in his legs, but
it gave the Huskies a new spring
in their step. Washington had
stumbled upon a way to keep its
players from fouling out of the
game and keep Stanford at bay
to boot.
The Huskies never trailed by
more than five in the second half
and were down 66-64 when they
finally committed their seventh
team foul. That sent Stanford

freshman Adam Keefe to the line
with 32 seconds to go.
Keefe was in the midst of a fine
game (15 points and six rebounds
in 23 minutes), but missed the
front end of the one-and-one at
tempt.
Washington ran the clock down
to :08 before calling time out.
Recasner for a 3-pointer to win it
seemed like a likely option, but it
ended up that Dion Brown banked
a twisting, 14-footer to tie the
game with :02 left.
After a time out, Stanford made
a hail-mary attempt to win the
game, but the pass never got to
Howard Wright in the key.
"Howard got pushed six feet,"
Montgomery said. "I don't blame
them for not calling it ... not
wanting to decide the game that
way .. . but Howard took a swan
dive."
No matter. Todd Lichti was
about to get in the act.
After the teams traded misses,
Lichti sunk a 15-footer from the
side to give Stanford the lead for
good. Lichti later missed the front
end of a one-and-one, but Reveno
got the rebound. He passed to
Taylor who in turn passed down
low to Wright for a layup.
Lichti sandwiched pairs of free
throws around a Jeff Sanor 3-
pointer, and Stanford led 74-69
with 1:42 left. But Washington
hung tough as Mike Hayward also
hit from long range, the Huskies'
fourth 3-pointer.
Lichti drove baseline for a layup
with 56 seconds left, but Brown
powered his way inside to cut it
back to 76-74 with 40 seconds left.
Meinert was then fouled in the
backcourt by Hayward to set up
his game-winning free throws.
