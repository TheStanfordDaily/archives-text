## Card pushed by Huskies before winning in OT 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
Ironically, as the Stanford
men's basketball team struggles
to wins against second-division
schools in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, it is arriving as a legitimate
top-20 school.
Yesterday's 82-74 overtime win
over Washington before 7,500 at
Maples Pavilion is the latest in
this paradoxical pattern. The No.
18 Cardinal didn't play poorly
against the Huskies, who arrived
on the Farm in sixth place in the
Pac-10 with a 5-7 record, but
looked less than dominant com
pared to Washington's inspired ef
fort.

"For those of you who think we
did something bad, you're mistak
en," Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "Washington scared
the daylights out of me. . . .
They're an excellent basketball
team.
"All of a sudden, everybody
wants us real bad," Montgomery
added later. "We're finding people
play their best against us."
In other words, beating Stan
ford this year can make a school's
season, where in past years such
a win would have had problems
making the school's newspaper.
But reserve guard Scott
Meinert sunk two free throws
with 32 seconds remaining in
overtime to give Stanford a 78-74
lead, and prevented the"Wash
ington stuns No. 18 Stanford"
headlines from appearing in
Seattle. Free throws by Eric
Reveno and a slam dunk by
Howard Wright at the buzzer
f>unctuated the game with an ex
amation point.
"We got a little fortunate,"

Montgomery said. "But the one
thing we've done consistently all
year is we've made the plays when
we had to make them."
Stanford guard Todd Lichti,
who scored the winning basket in
Stanford's 71-69 squeaker over
Washington Jan. 12, took over the
game in overtime, scoring eight
of his team-high 19 points, to lift
the Cardinal (now 19-5 overall
and 9-3 in the Pac-10) to within
one-half game of second-place
UCLA.
"The difference between our
team and [Stanford], and Mike
(Montgomery) and I were talking
about this before, is Todd Lichti,"
Washington Coach Andy Russo
said. "It's as simple as that."
Washington's all-Pac-10 guard
Eldridge Recasner, who knows a
little about being a star player
himself, didn't argue the point.
"Todd came out in the overtime
and he just completely took over,"
said Recasner, who led everybody
with 23 points before fouling out
in the overtime period. "You could
see it in his eyes and in the way
he moved on the court that he
wanted it."
In the overtime period, Lichti
passed Reggie Miller of UCLA to
become the Pac-10's all-time
leading scorer in conference
games. Lichti now has 1,238
points in Pac-10 games, four more
than Miller and 16 more than Ar
izona's Sean Elliott.
It is best not to get too excited,
however, because Lichti and Stan
ford would not have been forced
into an overtime had it not been
for Stanford's inability to combat
a rarely-used zone by the Huskies.
Washington came out in its
usual mflti-to-man pressure de
fense when the game started, but
had to switch to a zone as Huskies
Dion Brown, Mike Hayward,
Mark West and Todd Lautenbach
all picked up three fouls in the
