# 'Ice water' Meinert seals Stanford win
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
There are 32 seconds left in overtime. Stanford,
the 18th-ranked team in the nation, is leading Wash
ington by a mere two points.
It shouldn't be this close. Hell, it shouldn't even
be in overtime.
But, the scoreboard reads Stanford 76, Washing
ton 74 and senior guard Scott Meinert is on the
free-thow line to shoot a one-and-one.
Meinert stands at the stripe as a result of Mike
Hayward's fourth foul. The frenzied Maples crowd
has quieted some to allow Meinert to concentrate.
They know, as most certainly does he, that failure
to make both shots gives the Huskies another chance
at life. Failure to make the front end could be even
worse. Washington could get the rebound and go
for the 3-pointer they had eschewed in regulation.
It could be Stanford's first home loss of the season.
The official gives Meinert the ball. He sets, bends
his knees, straightens up and confidently releases
the first throw. Swish.
The crowd roars, Meinert pumps his fist. He then
returns to the line and just as confidently sinks the
second one. Stanford 78, Washington 74. Chalk
another one up in the 'W' column for the Cardinal.
"I was just taking 'em one at a time," Meinert
said afterward. "I've always thought that's when
the game's most fun."
So you weren't nervous or anything Scott, didn't
feel any pressure?
"No ... you go through practice for 20 years of
your life for a chance to put away a game ... to
ice it."
Ice indeed. So Meinert was in the game because
he has ice water coursing through his veins, right?
"The primary reason I was in the game was to
inbound the ball," Meinert said. Guards are a "little
more used to hitting people when they're breaking
free," he added.
With 40 seconds remaining, Dion Brown hit a
layup. Washington immediately called timeout.
When play resumed, Montgomery subbed Meinert
in for Andrew Vlahov. Meinert made the inbound.
Stanford brought the ball up court, Washington
double-teamed Lichti. He passed to Meinert.
Hayward hacked him, the whistle blew and the rest,
as they say, is history.
