# Baseball sluggish, drops 2 of 3 to Fullerton
## 
### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
In danger of being swept in a
series for the second time this
season, the Cardinal (5-5) last
night came up with a patented
eighth-inning rally to defeat Cal
State-Fullerton (3-2), 11-8 and
salvage the last of a three-game
set.

Baseball
Cardinal drops two of three

Trailing 8-5 entering the top of
the eighth, Stanford pinch hitter
Eric Cox walked to lead off the
inning. Second baseman Frank
Carey's blooper into left put run
ners on first and second. After
designated hitter Roger Burnett
fanned, shortstop Troy Paulsen
put the Cardinal in business with
a double down the leftfield line
to score both Cox and Carey.
Right fielder Paul Carey popped
out, leaving the task of tying
things up in the hands of third
baseman Tim Griffin. The right
handed batting Griffin delivered
with a brilliant opposite field
single to plate Paulsen.
Griffin advanced to second on
Titan right fielder Trevor Neigh
bors' bobble of his base hit, and
when Neighbors' frantic throw to
second trickled into left field, Grif
fin got up and hustled to third.

He scored on a wild pitch to give
Stanford a 9-8 lead, its first since
the opening stanza.
The Cardinal added two insur
ance runs in the top of the ninth
on an RBI-double by Cox and a
run-scoring single from Frank
Carey, and ace reliever Steve
Chitren (1-1), who spelled starter
Mike Mussina in the bottom of
the sixth, did not allow a run the
rest of the way in by far his best
outing of the young season.
Saturday's loss was a testament
to silent Cardinal bats. Four
singles were all Stanford could
muster as the Titans pinned a 5-2
loss on the two-time defending na
tional champions. Stanford
starter Brian Keyser (0-1) pitched
just three innings, giving up seven
hits and four runs, all earned.
The lone bright spot for the Car
dinal was freshman left-hander
Steve Worrell, who permitted just
two hits and an unearned run in
five innings of relief. Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess was elated
that his only left-hander was so
sharp.
"I thought Steve Worrell was
outstanding. His fastball was
moving and Fullerton really never
got to him," he said.
In Friday night's 3-2 drubbing,
the difference was a critical,
seventh-inning defensive lapse by
the Cardinal.

seemingly secure 2-0 lead.
Stanford starter Stan Spencer
(0-1) held the Titans to just five
hits through six frames, but just
as the seventh proved fateful for
Titan starter Danny DeVille, it
also jumped up and bit Spencer.
Fullerton got singles from Nate
Borgogno and Randy Graves to
lead off the inning. Eddie Lample
then dropped down a sacrifice
bunt, and Spencer tried for the
force at third. Spencer's throw
was late, and third baseman Tim
Griffin threw wild on his relay to
first, allowing both Borgogno and
Graves to score.
Scott Weiss, on in relief of Spen
cer, hit the next batter, and
Fullerton's Trevor Neighbors
then delivered the game-winning
single.
The Cardinal will try to make
it two in a row today at Sunken
