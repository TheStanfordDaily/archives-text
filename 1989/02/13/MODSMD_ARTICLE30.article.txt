# Bats late in coming for Card
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Senior staff writer 
Stanford baseball Coach
Mark Marquess must not have
slept well Friday and Saturday
nights.
From day one of the 1989
season, his worst fear was that
the team would not give his
talented pitching corps much
offensive support.
When Ron Witmeyer, Ed
Sprague and Doug Robbins
signed professional contracts
after last season, they took 45
home runs to the big leagues
with them. Marquess worried
that Paul Carey would be the
only big bat in his lineup and
not be able to pick up the slack
by himself.
Friday and Saturday against
Fullerton State, Marquess was
living his worst nightmare.
The anemic Cardinal bats
could muster no extra base hits
in either of those games as
Stanford fell to the Titans 3-2
and 5-2. Of the four runs that
Stanford scored, only one of
them was earned.
Friday's game must have
been a heartbreaker for Stan
Spencer, who has become a vic
tim of hard luck and no support

thus far this season. Spencer
took a 2-0 lead into the bottom
of the seventh, but a throwing
error by Cardinal third base
man Tim Griffin allowed two
runs to score to tie up the
game.
And even though the Titans
only scored one more run in
that inning, it was enough to
nail down the win.
The Cardinal scored its first
earned run of the weekend on
Saturday when Paul Carey hit
a single, moved to second on a
passed ball and to third on a
single by David Holbrook. He
scored on a sacrifice fly by Mike
Eicher.
So much for heart-stopping
offense.
This story does have a happy
ending, however.
From then on the Cardinal
was roping the ball. Later in
the game Troy Paulsen and
Eric Cox stung doubles over
the outfielders' heads and
Stanford, which was losing 6-3
before Carey's double, went on
to score eight more runs and
win the game.
So, all's well that ends well
and Marquess will probably
able to sleep like a baby
tonight.
