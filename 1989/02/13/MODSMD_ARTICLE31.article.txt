# Swimmers dunk USC, UCLA

### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Jeff Rouse's leg of the 400-yard
medley relay Saturday was merely
a representation of the entire
swim team's performance.

Men's Swimming
Cardinal 59.5, Trojans 53.5
Cardinal 70, Bruins 43

The freshman backstroker set
a new pool record in the 100 back
stroke as Stanford cruised to vic
tory in the opening event against
Pacific-10 rival UCLA. Not only
did the race set the tone for the
meet, it also summarized the Car
dinal strokers' entire weekend ef
fort.
Stanford swept its pair of con
ference meets at deGuerre Pool,
defeating highly-touted Southern
California 59.5-53.5 Friday before
crushing the Bruins 70-43. The
victories over last season's NCAA
runner-ups and its cross-town
rival gave the second-ranked Car
dinal an unblemished 4-0 Pac-10

record, 5-1 overall.
"It was a great weekend because
it is really tough to win back-to
back against USC and UCLA,"
freestyler John Hodge said.
"Rouse's swim was fantastic, es
pecially considering the caliber of
backstrokers Stanford has had.
Overall everyone swam consis
tently, which is a good sign for
the end of the year (Pac-10's and
NCAA finals)."
Consistently is an understate
ment. While most times were not
very fast, performances were
definitely more than adequate, es
pecially in the clutch. With the
meet hanging in the balance Fri
day, the breaststrokers followed
their teammates' examples and
came through with victory
clinching swims. Although last
season's freshman wonder Matt
Rogers had yet to clock his NCAA
point- winning times of a year
ago, he and classmate Ken
Brakebill stepped up their inten
sity and withstood the pressure
in the 200 breaststroke against
the Trojans.
With two events to go and USC
a sure victor in the final 400 free

style relay, Stanford had to finish
at least 2-3 to win the meet.
Rodgers and Brakebill went one
step further — they took first and
third places and preserved « Car
dinal win.
"The meet against USC was
filled with some gutsy swims and
some some really clutch swims
and the breaststroke epitomized
both," Asst. Coach Ted Knapp
said.
Rodgers and Brakebill were
only two of a plethora of Cardinal
placers during the two contests.
Although Olympian Dan Jorgen
son outlasted freshman sensation
Jason Plummer in the 1000 free,
he was unable to repeat in the
500 event. NCAA champion John
Witchel came through for the sec
ond week in a row, taking the
lead with 100 yards to go to earn
another clutch victory for the Car
dinal. He also took the 200 free,
and repeated his performance in
both events Saturday against
UCLA when he touched out Olym
pian Craig Oppel in the 200 race.
Rouse won the 200 backstroke

Matt Rodgers and his Cardinal teammates have been swimming their way past the competition lately.
Over the weekend, the squad scored decisive victories over UCLA and USC.
at both meets, while freshman
Andy Lloyd took third against
USC and second against the
Bruins. Junior Doug Lillydahl
won the 100 freestyle Saturday
and placed second Friday in both
the 50 and 100-yard races, and
Jeff Garr took third in the 50
against the Trojans and second
against UCLA. Alex Kostich and
Plummer went one-two in the
1000 freestyle Saturday and
junior Lunn Lestina placed in the
200 and 500 freestyle races.
Freshman Kevin Henderson tied
for third in the 100.
"Neither win this weekend was
a surprise but they were both
easier than we anticipated,"
Rouse said. "We're swimming way
over our expectations right now
and everyone is extremely happy."
Divers Matt Frawley and Mike
Burton once again came through
for the Cardinal, in fact proving
to be the difference in the USC
meet. Well on his way to his sec
ond consecutive Pac-10 title,

Frawley added another four dual
meet victories to his portfolio,
sweeping the boards both Friday
and Saturday. Burton took second
place on both the one and three
meter events against the Trojans
and took third on the three-meter
competition over the Bruins.
"The divers really deserve a lot
of credit because USC actually
outswam us in the pool," Knapp
said.
Once again the outstanding
freshman class contributed more
than its share, winning or placing
in nine events during the two con
ference competitions. The first
year swimmers were labeled the
number one class in the nation,
but few expected as many to con
tribute so much so fast or to write
themselves into the record books
even before national champion
ships.
"The freshmen are really com
ing through big for us. They're
giving us older guys a boost,"
Hodge said.
"I think just the enthusiasm of
the freshmen helps the team out,
and maybe even adds a little bit
of a spark," Rouse said.

'The freshmen are
really coming through
big for us.'

While the ravings about the
young swimmers continue, other
whispers are starting at the
deGuerre complex. After going 5-0
against not-too-shabby opponents
the past two weeks, talk has
started of the Cardinal regaining
the national championship this
April. "We're swimming so much
better than last season. We're
most likely going to be conference
dual meet champions — and this
is the best conference in the coun
try," co-captain Jay Mortenson
said.
"The way this team is swim
ming we have a fantastic chance.
The team is ready to win," Hodge
added."
