# Swimmers dunk USC, UCLA

### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Jeff Rouse's leg of the 400-yard
medley relay Saturday was merely
a representation of the entire
swim team's performance.

Men's Swimming
Cardinal 59.5, Trojans 53.5
Cardinal 70, Bruins 43

The freshman backstroker set
a new pool record in the 100 back
stroke as Stanford cruised to vic
tory in the opening event against
Pacific-10 rival UCLA. Not only
did the race set the tone for the
meet, it also summarized the Car
dinal strokers' entire weekend ef
fort.
Stanford swept its pair of con
ference meets at deGuerre Pool,
defeating highly-touted Southern
California 59.5-53.5 Friday before
crushing the Bruins 70-43. The
victories over last season's NCAA
runner-ups and its cross-town
rival gave the second-ranked Car
dinal an unblemished 4-0 Pac-10

record, 5-1 overall.
"It was a great weekend because
it is really tough to win back-to
back against USC and UCLA,"
freestyler John Hodge said.
"Rouse's swim was fantastic, es
pecially considering the caliber of
backstrokers Stanford has had.
Overall everyone swam consis
tently, which is a good sign for
the end of the year (Pac-10's and
NCAA finals)."
Consistently is an understate
ment. While most times were not
very fast, performances were
definitely more than adequate, es
pecially in the clutch. With the
meet hanging in the balance Fri
day, the breaststrokers followed
their teammates' examples and
came through with victory
clinching swims. Although last
season's freshman wonder Matt
Rogers had yet to clock his NCAA
point- winning times of a year
ago, he and classmate Ken
Brakebill stepped up their inten
sity and withstood the pressure
in the 200 breaststroke against
the Trojans.
With two events to go and USC
a sure victor in the final 400 free

style relay, Stanford had to finish
at least 2-3 to win the meet.
Rodgers and Brakebill went one
step further — they took first and
third places and preserved « Car
dinal win.
"The meet against USC was
filled with some gutsy swims and
some some really clutch swims
and the breaststroke epitomized
both," Asst. Coach Ted Knapp
said.
Rodgers and Brakebill were
only two of a plethora of Cardinal
placers during the two contests.
Although Olympian Dan Jorgen
son outlasted freshman sensation
Jason Plummer in the 1000 free,
he was unable to repeat in the
500 event. NCAA champion John
Witchel came through for the sec
ond week in a row, taking the
lead with 100 yards to go to earn
another clutch victory for the Car
dinal. He also took the 200 free,
and repeated his performance in
both events Saturday against
UCLA when he touched out Olym
pian Craig Oppel in the 200 race.
