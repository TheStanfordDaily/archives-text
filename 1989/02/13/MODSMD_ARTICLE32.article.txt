## Spikers bully Matadors before blowing out No. 3 Trojans 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
The Stanford men's volleyball team
is on a roll of late. On Saturday night,
the Cardinal pulled off its second
shocker of the season, knocking off
defending national champion USC in
four games. The upset came on the
heels of a three-game sweep of Cal
State-Northridge on Friday night. Stan
ford will ride this wave of momentum
into today's match with the No. 4-
ranked Gauchos of UC-Santa Barbara.

Against Northridge, the Cardinal put
forth an exceptional offensive effort on
its way to a no-doubt-about-it drubbing
of the lackluster Cal State squad. Stan
ford, which hit a phenomenal .650 as a
team, jumped out to an early lead in
game one and never looked back on its
way to a 15-7, 15-2, 15-3 win.
Asst. Coach Ruben Nieves described
the match's development. "Northridge
had been struggling lately," Nieves said.
"We knew that, and we wanted to jump
on them early. That's exactly what we
did, and they could never get anything
going after that."
Of course, some head-turning num
bers from some of Stanford's starters
made things even easier on the visiting
Cardinal. Scott Fortune, continuing his
impressive 1989 campaign, had 21 kills
on his way to a .607 hitting percentage.
Dan Hanan, giving Northridge a glimpse
of his Ail-American ability, hit a stun

ning .789. In fact, all of Stanford's
starters hit over .500.
After coasting through the
Northridge match, Stanford marched
into USC Trojan territory with some
thing to prove. The Saturday night
match got off to a doubtful start for
the Cardinal; before the Stanford
players knew what had hit them, they
had fallen into a 9-0 hole.
"Everything was just not going
right," Nieves said. "We had a very slow
start, complete with passing, serving,
and hitting errors. We called a few
timeouts to try to settle the guys down
and stressed that they shouldn't try to
get it all back at once."
The Cardinal was unable to get back
into game one but was able to regain
a little momentum before falling 6-15.
Even in the early portions of game two,
there was little if any indication of the
good things to come for Stanford. In
that game, the Trojans and Cardinal
found themselves in a nip-and-tuck bat
tle, but USC was able to pull out to a
slight lead.
Stanford did not panic in that posi
tion, however, and slowly crawl back
into contention. Passing specialist Dun
can Blackman, who seemingly had lost
his form in game one, returned in game
two with increased determination.
His precision passing was a rallying
point for the Cardinal. The long-awaited
return of hitter John Alstrom, who came
in off the bench in game two, may have
also been a factor in the Cardinal surge.
Whatever the magical ingredient, the
Cardinal was able to piece together a
15-9 victory. Teeming with newly-found
confidence, the Cardinal began to roll;
Stanford proceeded to trounce the

defending national champions in the
next two games by scores of 15-8 and
15 * 6 -
Nieves pinpointed the principal factor
in the victory. "Fortune was the key
player, without a doubt," Nieves said.
"He was just unstoppable. He picked
apart their defense, hitting both cross
court and down the line.
"When they sent two men up against
him, he was able to hit off the block
for the kill. By mixing in some tips, he
was able to keep them off-balance for
the entire match."
Indeed, Fortune's individual hitting
percentage of .489 contributed greatly
to his team's hitting success. Stanford
compiled a team hitting percentage of
over .400 for the second straight match,
and Stanford's output turned out to be
just too much for the home
standing Trojans.
Trojan fans would be quick to point
out the fact that their team played with
out their superstar Tom Duke, and cer
tainly they are right in asserting that
the team Stanford defeated was short
handed.
However, because it was on the road,
the Cardinal's victory must be tallied
as a huge victory. Depending on Stan
ford's performance at Santa Barbara
(currently ranked No. 4 nationally, one
ahead of Stanford), the Cardinal stands
to jump a notch or two in the national
poll.
There is, however, "very little room
to move up," Nieves said. UCLA and
Hawaii are firmly entrenched in the one
and two spots, and UC-Santa Barbara
will fight to defend its hold on its strong
national ranking.

Craig Forsyth and the Cardinal hit their way to a pair of wins this weekend.
Nieves pinpointed the principal
factor in the victory. "Fortune was
the key player, without a doubt,"
Nieves said. "He was just unstop
pable. He picked apart their de
fense, hitting both cross-court and
down the line.
"When they sent two men up
against him, he was able to hit
off the block for the kill. By
mixing in some tips, he was able
to keep them off-balance for the
entire match."
Indeed, Fortune's individual
hitting percentage of .489 contrib
uted greatly to his team's hitting
success. Stanford compiled a team
hitting percentage of over .400 for
the second straight match, and
Stanford's output turned out to
be just too much for the home

standing Trojans.
Trojan fans would be quick to
point out the fact that their team
played without their superstar
Tom Duke, and certainly they are
right in asserting that the team
Stanford defeated was shor
thanded.
However, because it was on the
road, the Cardinal's victory must
be tallied as a huge victory. De
pending on Stanford's perform
ance at Santa Barbara (currently
ranked No. 4 nationally, one
ahead of Stanford), the Cardinal
stands to jump a notch or two in
the national poll.
There is, however, "very little
room to move up," Nieves said.
UCLA and Hawaii are firmly
entrenched in the one and two
spots, and UC-Santa Barbara will
fight to defend its hold on its
strong national ranking.
Nieves points out that the most
important team goal is for the

team to finish in the top five in
the Western Intercollegiate Vol
leyball Association. "These na
tional rankings really mean noth
ing. The winner of the WTVA gets
an automatic bid in the NCAA
Final Four," Nieves said.
The second to fifth-place fin
ishers then go to the regional
tournament, with the better seeds
going to the higher finishers.
These four teams still have a shot
at winning the national champi
onship."
Indeed, the Cardinal seems to
be well on its way to qualifying
for the regional tournament. If it
can pull off a win against Santa
Barbara this afternoon, Stanford
may need to refocus its sight on
the WTVA championship. How
ever, even with a win today, the
almighty UCLA Bruins will still
stand as an extremely formidable
obstacle.
