# Cardinal cages the Cougars
## Henning, Stevens lead balanced Stanford effort 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
While statistics are sometimes
misleading, numbers have become
the Stanford women's basketball
team's greatest reward of late:
• No. 4 in the country for four
straight weeks;
• No. 1 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference;
• 19 wins versus two losses;
• 11 wins and no losses in Pac
-10 play;
• 13 straight wins spanning
from the beginning of 1989.
These kind numbers were made
possible by the Cardinal's 89-67
win at Washington State Saturday
night. After a respectable but un
exceptional first half, the Stan
ford rolled out 28 points in eight
minutes to the Cougars' 10 at the
start of the second half to cement
the Cardinal's sweep of the Wash
ington schools.

Women's Basketball
Cardinal 89, Cougars 67

Stanford had previously
defeated second-place Washington
to seize a full-game lead in the
league, notching a 69-65 victory
Thursday night in front of a vocal
3,200-spectator crowd at Hec Ed
mundson Pavilion. Rather than
letting down for the sixth-place
Cougars, Stanford came out with
an undeterrable will to win.
"The height of the weekend was
beating Washington, and we could
have been in the situation where
we let down for Washington
State," Stanford Coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "But this team
didn't — they played hard. There
was a streak in the first ten
minutes of the second half where
1 saw that we could beat anybody."
Stanford left the court at
halftime with a comfortable 42-32
lead. The team that re-emerged
after intermission, however,
hardly played like a team resting
on its laurels.
Sparked by forward Trisha
Stevens' juggernaut scoring, the
Cardinal blew the game right
open. Stevens scored 14 of her
game-total 16 points in a blister
ing seven minutes, including three
buckets in a row.
"Trisha was on a rampage,"
VanDerveer said. "She was un
stoppable."
With 12:00 left on the clock,
the game was already over; Stan
ford's 68-42 advantage was too
great for the Cougars to over
come. The Bohler Gym crowd
could only sit in shock as the
visitors manhandled the home
town team.
"We pressed, we ran on them
— we just jumped on them at the
start of the second half," VanDer
veer said. "It was close to flawless;
it was just good basketball."
Though Washington State fared
better once Stanford's starters hit
the bench, it was too little, much
too late. With perimeter defense
as the Cardinal's sole weakness,
four 3-pointers by forward Kristal
Stahl were the only damaging of
fensive moves that the Cougars
could muster.
Stanford's leading scorer was
guard Jennifer Azzi, who scored

two 3-pointers of her own en route
to a team-high 19 points. Forward
Katy Steding, in an apparent
switch with Pac-10 assist leader
Azzi, dished a game-high seven
assists to complement her 12
points.
But the invaluable play of the
weekend came from point guard
Sor\ja Henning. After leading the
Cardinal past Washington with 19
points, the sophomore notched 16
more on 6-for-6 shooting the fol
lowing evening against the
Cougars.
"No one could do more for a
team than Sonja did for us this
weekend," VanDerveer said. "She
was the main woman of the week
end; she saved her best for the
best."
With the toughest competition

of the regular season under Stan
ford's collective belt, the team
should have a relatively smooth
sailing to its first Pac-10 title ever.
The Cardinal would have to lose
three games in order to not claim
its crown, an unlikely feat con
sidering that the hardest games
have as of now passed.
California at Berkeley this Fri
day, Arizona State in Tempe two
weeks from now and at
Stanford the following week pro
vide potential stumbling blocks.
However, as Stanford has already
beaten these teams once, the sec
ond time should be far simpler.
An undefeated Pac-10 season is
well within reach should the Car
dinal maintain the high level of
play it exhibited in Washington.

But the invaluable play of the
weekend came from point guard
Sor\ja Henning. After leading the
Cardinal past Washington with 19
points, the sophomore notched 16
more on 6-for-6 shooting the fol
lowing evening against the
Cougars.
"No one could do more for a
team than Sonja did for us this
weekend," VanDerveer said. "She
was the main woman of the week
end; she saved her best for the
best."
With the toughest competition

of the regular season under Stan
ford's collective belt, the team
should have a relatively smooth
sailing to its first Pac-10 title ever.
The Cardinal would have to lose
three games in order to not claim
its crown, an unlikely feat con
sidering that the hardest games
have as of now passed.
California at Berkeley this Fri
day, Arizona State in Tempe two
weeks from now and at
Stanford the following week pro
vide potential stumbling blocks.
However, as Stanford has already
beaten these teams once, the sec
ond time should be far simpler.
An undefeated Pac-10 season is
well within reach should the Car
dinal maintain the high level of
play it exhibited in Washington.

seven-minute second-half span as the No. 4 women's basketball
team blew out Washington State 89-67 in Pullman, Wash. Saturday.
While statistics are sometimes
misleading, numbers have become
the Stanford women's basketball
team's greatest reward of late:
• No. 4 in the country for four
straight weeks;
• No. 1 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference;
• 19 wins versus two losses;
• 11 wins and no losses in Pac
-10 play;
• 13 straight wins spanning
from the beginning of 1989.
These kind numbers were made
possible by the Cardinal's 89-67
win at Washington State Saturday
night. After a respectable but un
exceptional first half, the Stan
ford rolled out 28 points in eight
minutes to the Cougars' 10 at the
start of the second half to cement
the Cardinal's sweep of the Wash
ington schools.

Women's Basketball
Cardinal 89, Cougars 67

Stanford had previously
defeated second-place Washington
to seize a full-game lead in the
league, notching a 69-65 victory
Thursday night in front of a vocal
3,200-spectator crowd at Hec Ed
mundson Pavilion. Rather than
letting down for the sixth-place
Cougars, Stanford came out with
an undeterrable will to win.
"The height of the weekend was
beating Washington, and we could
have been in the situation where
we let down for Washington
State," Stanford Coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "But this team
didn't — they played hard. There
was a streak in the first ten
minutes of the second half where
1 saw that we could beat anybody."
Stanford left the court at
halftime with a comfortable 42-32
lead. The team that re-emerged
after intermission, however,
hardly played like a team resting
on its laurels.
Sparked by forward Trisha
Stevens' juggernaut scoring, the
Cardinal blew the game right
open. Stevens scored 14 of her
game-total 16 points in a blister
ing seven minutes, including three
buckets in a row.
"Trisha was on a rampage,"
VanDerveer said. "She was un
stoppable."
With 12:00 left on the clock,
the game was already over; Stan
ford's 68-42 advantage was too
great for the Cougars to over
come. The Bohler Gym crowd
could only sit in shock as the
visitors manhandled the home
town team.
"We pressed, we ran on them
— we just jumped on them at the
start of the second half," VanDer
veer said. "It was close to flawless;
it was just good basketball."
Though Washington State fared
better once Stanford's starters hit
the bench, it was too little, much
too late. With perimeter defense
as the Cardinal's sole weakness,
four 3-pointers by forward Kristal
Stahl were the only damaging of
fensive moves that the Cougars
could muster.
Stanford's leading scorer was
guard Jennifer Azzi, who scored

two 3-pointers of her own en route
to a team-high 19 points. Forward
Katy Steding, in an apparent
switch with Pac-10 assist leader
Azzi, dished a game-high seven
assists to complement her 12
points.
