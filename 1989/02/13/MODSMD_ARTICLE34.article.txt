## Whitlinger makes time in Rolex 
### 
Though Tami Whitlinger has
yet to play in a dual meet for
the Stanford women's tennis
team this season, the sophomore
All-America has served notice
that she is one of the nation's
best by capturing the title in
the Rolex National Intercol
legiate Championships in
Bloomington, Minn.
Whitlinger beat teammate
Lisa Green in the finals 6-1, 6-1
yesterday and, in so doing,
served notice that the injuries
that have kept her sidelined
thus far are all but behind her.
After Friday's action, an all-
Cardinal final seemed all but
assured. Freshman Debbie
Graham, junior Lisa Green and
Whitlinger all captured their
quarterfinal matches to become
three of the four semifinalists.
Saturday, Whitlinger defeated
Mary Beth Young of BYU 6-1,
6-3. In the other semifinal,
Green bested Graham 7-5, 6-2.
In doubles, Whitlinger and
her sister Teri captured the title
by beating Kelly Mulvihill and
Stephanie Reece of Indiana 6-4,
6-2.
On the men's side, junior Jeff
Tarango lost his quarterfinal
match to Michigan's Dan
Goldberg 7-6 (7-4), 6-1.

Gymnasts finish 2nd
at Oregon State meet
"It was awesome."
Such was sophomore Jennifer
Bloom's comment regarding the
Stanford women's gymnastics
team's second place finish at the
Shanico Invitational at Oregon
State last Friday. Scoring a
school record 186.30 points,
Stanford kept within 1.15 points
of 18th-ranked Oregon State
while outscoring both Big Ten
Conference champion Minne

sota and Boise State.
For the past three weeks, the
Cardinal had been struggling to
be consistent, but it posed no
problem Friday as the team re
corded no falls in any event. The
team vaulting score reached a
season high while the perform
ances on the uneven bar set an
other school record. And while
balance beam routines were not
outstanding, Stanford avoided
the falls of previous weeks.
Indeed, Stanford led up until
the final event, when Oregon
State took the meet with a su
perb showing in the floor exer
cises. Nonetheless, "it was a
heck of a meet," Stanford Coach
Homer Sardina said.
Senior co-captain Sheri Even
son placed third in the all
around with a 37.45, and fresh
man Shira Wohlberg took fourth
with' a 37.20. Evenson and
freshman Adriana Duffy tied for
second in vault and freshman
Denise Villars scored a 9.55 in
the uneven bars, tying for first
with 1984 Olympic gymnast
Mary Roethlisberger of Minne
sota.
The team also won the Sports
manship Award at the meet, im
pressing both judges and crowd
alike with their team spirit and
support. Bloom said that, after
the meet, members of the crowd
complimented Stanford on its
enthusiasm.
"We were such a team,"
Bloom said, "hyper and excited.
All the support and success
made it really fun."
And considering that several
top gymnasts either missed the
competition or competed in only
one or two events because of
injuries, Friday's success not
only demonstrated the team's
superb depth but also promises
continued improvements and
higher scores.
So with confidence and con
sistency restored, Stanford
heads into this Friday's home

meet with, as Bloom said, "a
big psychological boost."

Wrestlers lose again;
prepare for Pac-lOs
The 29-11 loss to Cal State-
Bakersfield Saturday didn't
seem to matter much; more im
portant things lay on the
horizon for Stanford's wrestling
team.
The Cardinal finished its dual
meet season with a record of
5-4. According to Stanford
Coach Chris Horpel, however,
the team's 1988-89 performance
cannot be judged until after the
Pacific 10 Conference/Western
Regionals Feb. 2G-27.
"The entire season comes
down to a one-day tournament,"
Horpel said. "You can win all
your dual meet matches, do well
at all the tournaments, and still
not have a good season. If you
don't perform well at the Pac
10s, you can't go to the NCAAs,
you can't be an All-American
. . . that's just the nature of the
sport."
Sophomore superstar Steve
Buddie (177 lbs.) commented,
"Right now a new season starts.
The competition in the Pac-lOs
will jump a whole level. The next
two weeks will be the toughest
training of the year for us."
Despite the defeat, the match
against Bakersfield — the
number-two ranked team in the
Pac 10 — was full of highlights.
Buddie and co-captains Steve
Yarbrough (167 lbs.) and Ron
Perry (190 lbs.) each managed
to end the dual meet season un
defeated.
In the last 10 years, only two
other wrestlers, Dave Lee (167
lbs.) and Pete Rogers (158 lbs.),
