# Swimmers coast past the Bears

### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY, Calif. — Another day. Another pool.
Another swim meet.
Another win.
That, basically, is the story of winter quarter for
the Cardinal women's swim team. Stanford, ranked
second nationally, finished its dual-meet season with
its sixth blow-out in six tries, a 104-45 victory over
eighth-ranked California at Spieker Pool in Berkeley
Saturday.

Cardinal 104, Golden Bears 45

Going into the Pacific 10 Conference Champion
ships Feb. 23-25, the Cardinal is 6-0, untested after
dual meets against six t,op-20 squads, and a bet
the-farm-and-the-kids'-college-fund favorite to
cruise to the league title.
Although the Cardinal did not swim as fast is
the team has before this season, perhaps a carry
over from last week's emotional 95-45 win over
third-ranked Texas, the outcome of Saturday's meet
was never in question. Stanford began by winning

the 400-yard medley relay by nearly seven seconds
and never gave the Golden Bears a chance to even
hope for victory.
"I didn't think we were very sharp today," Stan
ford Coach Richard Quick said. "(But) we raced
tough."
That toughness was epitomized by Barb Metz,
who came from way behind to record wins in both
the 200 butterfly and the 500 freestyle. Metz swam
the 2200 butterfly in the NCAA Championships
last year but is swimming the 1650 freestyle instead
this year.
Metz looked like a butterflier, however, coming
on strong in the final 50 yards to touch-out Cardinal
freshman Jamie Rugless and Cal Ail-American Alicia
Walker.
"I felt really powerful the last hundred," Metz
said. "(Before] I always tried to push that third
fifty instead of letting it f10w.... It felt awesome
to finally feel like I'm not going to die."
Then, in the 500 freestyle, Metz came from
nowhere in the second half of the race to beat
Golden Bear NCAA finalists Sarah Anderson and
Cheryl Kriegsman. "Sarah Anderson was in the
lane next to me," Metz said. "I just tried to stay
with her. ... I was confident that at the end there
was no way she was going to beat me."
Freshman breaststroker J.T.
Toten had the best swim of her
collegiate career to record a three
second victory in the 200 breast
stroke and become the Cardinal's
14th NCAA qualifier this year.
"I was really pleased that J.T.
Toten made her qualifying time
in the 200 breast," Quick said.
"That's a big one for us."
Senior co-captain Jenna
Johnson won both the 100 but
terfly and the 50 freestyle for
Stanford and diver Katie Connors
won both the one and three-meter
competitions for about the mil
lionth meet in a row. Freshman
diver Melisa Kuller recorded an
NCAA qualifying score to take
third off the one-meter board.
Other Stanford winners in

eluded Michelle Griglione in the
200 individual medley, Jody Smith
in the 100 backstroke, Susan
Johnson in the 100 breststroke,
Aimee Berzins in the 100 free
style, Dede Trimble in the 200
backstroke and the team of Jenna
Johnson, Griglione, Suzy Buck
ovich and Berzins in the 400 free
style relay.
"I think we're right where we
want to be," Metz said. "It's really
hard to come back a week after
Texas, physically and mentally."
Now Quick is mostly interested
in preparing for the NCAA Cham
pionships, March 16-18. "I feel
pretty good about [the Pac-10
meet]," he said. "We need to get
a few more people qualified.
"I'm pleased with where we are
but we've got to take the next
step; move up to the next level.
Everybody has to swim tough in
all their events."
