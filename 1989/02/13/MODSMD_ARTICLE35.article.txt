# Swimmers coast past the Bears

BERKELEY, Calif. â€” Another day. Another pool.
Another swim meet.
Another win.
That, basically, is the story of winter quarter for
the Cardinal women's swim team. Stanford, ranked
second nationally, finished its dual-meet season with
its sixth blow-out in six tries, a 104-45 victory over
eighth-ranked California at Spieker Pool in Berkeley
Saturday.

Women's Swimming
Cardinal 104, Golden Bears 45

Going into the Pacific 10 Conference Champion
ships Feb. 23-25, the Cardinal is 6-0, untested after
dual meets against six t,op-20 squads, and a bet
the-farm-and-the-kids'-college-fund favorite to
cruise to the league title.
Although the Cardinal did not swim as fast is
the team has before this season, perhaps a carry
over from last week's emotional 95-45 win over
third-ranked Texas, the outcome of Saturday's meet
was never in question. Stanford began by winning

the 400-yard medley relay by nearly seven seconds
and never gave the Golden Bears a chance to even
hope for victory.
"I didn't think we were very sharp today," Stan
ford Coach Richard Quick said. "(But) we raced
tough."
That toughness was epitomized by Barb Metz,
who came from way behind to record wins in both
the 200 butterfly and the 500 freestyle. Metz swam
the 2200 butterfly in the NCAA Championships
last year but is swimming the 1650 freestyle instead
this year.
Metz looked like a butterflier, however, coming
on strong in the final 50 yards to touch-out Cardinal
freshman Jamie Rugless and Cal Ail-American Alicia
Walker.
"I felt really powerful the last hundred," Metz
said. "(Before] I always tried to push that third
fifty instead of letting it f10w.... It felt awesome
to finally feel like I'm not going to die."
Then, in the 500 freestyle, Metz came from
nowhere in the second half of the race to beat
Golden Bear NCAA finalists Sarah Anderson and
Cheryl Kriegsman. "Sarah Anderson was in the
lane next to me," Metz said. "I just tried to stay
with her. ... I was confident that at the end there
was no way she was going to beat me."
