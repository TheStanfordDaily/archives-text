"Niggers back to Africa .. . Death to
Fags . . . Burn the Jews. Do you know that
these statements are protected under Stan

So reads the message printed on about
100 posters hung around campus Friday.
The message was in response to a Univer
sity Legal Office statement on free expres
sion at Stanford, and also to the Judicial
Affairs Office's decision on the Ujamaa
case, both of which were released last week.
In a statement released last Thursday,
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole an
nounced that two students who defaced a

Ujamaa House would not be charged with
violating the Fundamental Standard.
Nadeem Hussain, a junior and resident
computer coordinator at Otero House,
printed and distributed the posters, which
display his name at the bottom. Hussain
said yesterday that he did not intend to
offend anyone by the posters, but rather
wanted to protest the University's stance

on offensive expression.
Though the posters hung Friday were
produced by one person, they reflect the
feelings of some student leaders who are
dissatisfied with the University's response
to the Ujamaa incident.
"This decision (on the Ujamaa case) sets
a new precedent," Hussain said. "It seems
to imply that the University is not going
to take a serious enough stand on racist
statements intended to offend, not just as
statements of political thought."
Cole said yesterday that her decision did
not express any new University policy, aa
the posters assert.
"I don't think the decision did set a new
precedent. It's entirely consistent with past
practice. There really is nothing either new
or surprising in the decision," she said.
According to Cole's statement, "The stu
dents' actions in Ujamaa House constituted
a form of expression that is protected both
by University policy and practice and by
the First Amendment."
