# Student's flier protests free speech statement
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
"Niggers back to Africa .. . Death to
Fags . . . Burn the Jews. Do you know that
these statements are protected under Stan
ford's new policy?"
So reads the message printed on about
100 posters hung around campus Friday.
The message was in response to a Univer
sity Legal Office statement on free expres
sion at Stanford, and also to the Judicial
Affairs Office's decision on the Ujamaa
case, both of which were released last week.
In a statement released last Thursday,
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole an
nounced that two students who defaced a
poster in a racially offensive manner at
Ujamaa House would not be charged with
violating the Fundamental Standard.
Nadeem Hussain, a junior and resident
computer coordinator at Otero House,
printed and distributed the posters, which
display his name at the bottom. Hussain
said yesterday that he did not intend to
offend anyone by the posters, but rather
wanted to protest the University's stance

on offensive expression.
Though the posters hung Friday were
produced by one person, they reflect the
feelings of some student leaders who are
dissatisfied with the University's response
to the Ujamaa incident.
"This decision (on the Ujamaa case) sets
a new precedent," Hussain said. "It seems
to imply that the University is not going
to take a serious enough stand on racist
statements intended to offend, not just as
statements of political thought."
Cole said yesterday that her decision did
not express any new University policy, aa
the posters assert.
"I don't think the decision did set a new
precedent. It's entirely consistent with past
practice. There really is nothing either new
or surprising in the decision," she said.
According to Cole's statement, "The stu
dents' actions in Ujamaa House constituted
a form of expression that is protected both
by University policy and practice and by
the First Amendment."
Hussain said the Fundamental Standard
should take precedence over the
First Amendment in issues of of
fensive expression.
"Their (the University's) state
ment in reference to the First
Amendment is completely
correct," Hussain said. "But 1 dis
agree that we must stick by the
First Amendment and not by the
stricter Fundamental Standard."
Hussain said he hung the
posters at various places on
campus, including Terman Engi
neering Building, the Physics
Building, the dining rooms at
Wilbur Hall and Stern Hall,
around the Quad and at the Daily
offices.
According to Hussain, Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson called him Friday night

and "was annoyed." Hussain said
Robinson told him University
President Donald Kennedy had
seen the poster and was also "an
noyed."
Hussain has not talked to either
since. Robinson was not available
for comment last night.
For their own part, leaders in
the black community said Hus
sain's posters hit the mark in res
ponding to the University's recent
statements.
Mary Dillard, chair of the Black
Student Union, smd the posters
were "really shocking. They make
a dramatic and important point."
"There's a huge gap, and it's
getting bigger, between what the
University says and what they
do," Dillard said. "I don't think
the statement has been made that
it's wrong to be racist."
BSU Secretary Louis Jackson
said the posters were "pretty fun
ny. .. . I think he (Hussain) cap

tured the way the mtyority of
black students feel."
"Maybe it wasn't the best way
to approach the issue, but it
struck a lot of chords and made
people think," Jackson added.
Steve Greene, a member of the
Stanford Organization for Les
bian and Gay Equality, said that
"obviously we wouldn't like to see
those words (in Hussain's poster)
printed in a context where they
are taken seriously."
But he added that, in this con
text, "It seems like a very effective
way of making his point."
Jocelyn Reisman, program di
rector of the Hillel Foundation,
said she had not seen the poster
and did not know of any members
of her organization who were con
cerned about it. She expressed
mixed feelings about the Univer
sity's position on offensive expres
sion.
"I think the University should

be an example for the society at
large. The University should take
a harsh stance, but it's very dif
ficult legally," Reisman said.
The statement released by the
Legal Office reads, in part: "Some
have urged that Stanford's Fun
damental Standard is in conflict
with, or perhaps overrides, First
Amendment principles because it
demands 'respect for . . . the
rights of others' and we hold out
freedom from insult on racial, eth
nic, sexual and other grounds as
a right we mean to provide within
the community.
"But no one has a right that
another person not hold an opin
ion, or express it,"the statement
reads.
Hussain said he spoke with res
ident fellows at Stern and Wilbur
over the weekend and got "no par
ticular reaction" about the
posters, though "some of the RFs
were positive."

Denis Phillips, RF at Twain
House, said the poster was "cer
tainly attention-getting. A lot of
people who first saw it misun
derstood it because they didn't
see the small print at the bottom."
The first three statements in
the poster appear in large block
print, but Hussain's name and the
sentence about "Stanford's new
policy" are printed in regular type
at the bottom.
"There's an issue of whether
he should have taken this form
to express his views," Phillips
added. "Some who saw it felt it
was inappropriate."
Larkin RF Bob Harvey said, "At
first I think we sensed a very
hostile response on the part of
the students.
Harvey noted that the posters
might have been more effective if
the last sentence had been placed
first, so that readers would not
misinterpret Hussain's intent.

by University policy and practice and by
the First Amendment."
Hussain said the Fundamental Standard
should take precedence over the
First Amendment in issues of of
fensive expression.
"Their (the University's) state
ment in reference to the First
Amendment is completely
correct," Hussain said. "But 1 dis
agree that we must stick by the
First Amendment and not by the
stricter Fundamental Standard."
Hussain said he hung the
posters at various places on
campus, including Terman Engi
neering Building, the Physics
Building, the dining rooms at
Wilbur Hall and Stern Hall,
around the Quad and at the Daily
offices.
According to Hussain, Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson called him Friday night

and "was annoyed." Hussain said
Robinson told him University
President Donald Kennedy had
seen the poster and was also "an
noyed."
Hussain has not talked to either
since. Robinson was not available
for comment last night.
For their own part, leaders in
the black community said Hus
sain's posters hit the mark in res
ponding to the University's recent
statements.
Mary Dillard, chair of the Black
Student Union, smd the posters
were "really shocking. They make
a dramatic and important point."
"There's a huge gap, and it's
getting bigger, between what the
University says and what they
do," Dillard said. "I don't think
the statement has been made that
it's wrong to be racist."
BSU Secretary Louis Jackson
said the posters were "pretty fun
ny. .. . I think he (Hussain) cap

tured the way the mtyority of
black students feel."
"Maybe it wasn't the best way
to approach the issue, but it
struck a lot of chords and made
people think," Jackson added.
Steve Greene, a member of the
Stanford Organization for Les
bian and Gay Equality, said that
"obviously we wouldn't like to see
those words (in Hussain's poster)
printed in a context where they
are taken seriously."
But he added that, in this con
text, "It seems like a very effective
way of making his point."
Jocelyn Reisman, program di
rector of the Hillel Foundation,
said she had not seen the poster
and did not know of any members
of her organization who were con
cerned about it. She expressed
mixed feelings about the Univer
sity's position on offensive expres
sion.
"I think the University should

be an example for the society at
large. The University should take
a harsh stance, but it's very dif
ficult legally," Reisman said.
The statement released by the
Legal Office reads, in part: "Some
have urged that Stanford's Fun
damental Standard is in conflict
with, or perhaps overrides, First
Amendment principles because it
demands 'respect for . . . the
rights of others' and we hold out
freedom from insult on racial, eth
nic, sexual and other grounds as
a right we mean to provide within
the community.
"But no one has a right that
another person not hold an opin
ion, or express it,"the statement
reads.
Hussain said he spoke with res
ident fellows at Stern and Wilbur
over the weekend and got "no par
ticular reaction" about the
posters, though "some of the RFs
were positive."

Denis Phillips, RF at Twain
House, said the poster was "cer
tainly attention-getting. A lot of
people who first saw it misun
derstood it because they didn't
see the small print at the bottom."
The first three statements in
the poster appear in large block
print, but Hussain's name and the
sentence about "Stanford's new
policy" are printed in regular type
at the bottom.
"There's an issue of whether
he should have taken this form
to express his views," Phillips
added. "Some who saw it felt it
was inappropriate."
Larkin RF Bob Harvey said, "At
first I think we sensed a very
hostile response on the part of
the students.
Harvey noted that the posters
might have been more effective if
the last sentence had been placed
first, so that readers would not
misinterpret Hussain's intent.
"Niggers back to Africa .. . Death to
Fags . . . Burn the Jews. Do you know that
these statements are protected under Stan
ford's new policy?"
So reads the message printed on about
100 posters hung around campus Friday.
The message was in response to a Univer
sity Legal Office statement on free expres
sion at Stanford, and also to the Judicial
Affairs Office's decision on the Ujamaa
case, both of which were released last week.
In a statement released last Thursday,
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole an
nounced that two students who defaced a
poster in a racially offensive manner at
Ujamaa House would not be charged with
violating the Fundamental Standard.
Nadeem Hussain, a junior and resident
computer coordinator at Otero House,
printed and distributed the posters, which
display his name at the bottom. Hussain
said yesterday that he did not intend to
offend anyone by the posters, but rather
wanted to protest the University's stance

on offensive expression.
Though the posters hung Friday were
produced by one person, they reflect the
feelings of some student leaders who are
dissatisfied with the University's response
to the Ujamaa incident.
"This decision (on the Ujamaa case) sets
a new precedent," Hussain said. "It seems
to imply that the University is not going
to take a serious enough stand on racist
statements intended to offend, not just as
statements of political thought."
Cole said yesterday that her decision did
not express any new University policy, aa
the posters assert.
"I don't think the decision did set a new
precedent. It's entirely consistent with past
practice. There really is nothing either new
or surprising in the decision," she said.
According to Cole's statement, "The stu
dents' actions in Ujamaa House constituted
a form of expression that is protected both
by University policy and practice and by
the First Amendment."
