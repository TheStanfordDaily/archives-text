# Stanford and Cal scramble to lure qualified faculty
## 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
Although the Big Game rivalry has cooled
down for this year, the competition to
recruit top faculty has heated up as Stan
ford and UC-Berkeley attempt to lure qual
ified teachers from an increasingly scarce
supply of new professors.
While there has been just enough qual
ified faculty to satisfy Stanford and
Berkeley over the past 20 years, the current
shortage is sending both schools scrambling,
said Judson King, Berkeley's provost for
Professional Schools and Colleges.
"The market is tightening up," according
to Stanford's Provost James Rosse.
Rosse explained that students went to
law or medical school when the demand
for teachers dropped in the middle to late
1970s and that the "surplus of young
people that went into education in the [ear
ly! '70s has worked its way through the
system."
The present turnover among professors
is exceeding the number of qualified can
didates for professorships, Rosse said.
"It's a mismatch," said King, adding that
it will be "much harder" for all universities
to recruit top faculty in the future.
In a report to the Faculty Senate last
school year, Rosse noted that the annual
growth rate of Stanford's faculty over the
past nine years has been 1 percent, but it
has slowed to less than half a percent over
the past five years.
The actual size of the faculty decreased
slightly in the 1987-88 academic year, drop
ping from 1,335 to 1,324.
According to Rosse, Berkeley has shown
a tremendous increase in its ability to draw
students and faculty to the West Coast over
the last five to seven years, stiffening Stan
ford's competition.
Nevertheless, the "active, lively environ
ment of faculty and students here" and
"the student to faculty ratio and relation
ships" are factors Rosse cites as "drawing
power" of Stanford over Berkeley.
King, seeing no clear across-the-board
advantage in teaching at either Stanford
or Berkeley, said the two primary deciding
factors that recruited professors consider
are the colleagues they would work with

at a particular school and the students they
would teach.
Berkeley draws a "cross section of the
public of California, (whereas) Stanford
draws to a greater extent nationally," King
said.
Both universities offer professors top
salaries.
Although Berkeley has "done better since
the early '80s in offering competitive
salaries," there will only be a 4 percent
increase in faculty wages if the state budget
recommendations remain as they stand,
said Berkeley Public Information Officer
Ray Colvig.
Rosse said Stanford plans to increase
salaries by 5 to 6 percent next year. Stan
ford's salaries should be comparable or
slightly greater than Berkeley's next year,
he said, adding that Berkeley may surpass
Stanford in coming years depending on
state expenditures in education.
Rosse, King and Colvig all agreed that
recruiting for the sciences will be particu
larly competitive.
Schools must be able to offer its prospec
tive professors expensive, new equipment
— often priced from $100,000 to $500,000
— that is necessary for them to remain
"on the forefront of knowledge," King said.
Physicist Douglas Osheroff recently chose
Stanford over Berkeley, even though
Berkeley offered him a larger grant.
Osheroff declined to elaborate, but told
the Palo Alto Times Tribune that he chose
Stanford because he's "always been a small
town person" and "Stanford is compara
tively small."
