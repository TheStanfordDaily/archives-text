# Profs. praise challenges of Continuing Studies

While the future of the Univer
sity's Continuing Studies Pro
gram's future is still up in the
air, Stanford professors teaching
the courses gave the program rave
reviews, asserting that the adult
classes challenge and rejuvenate
them.
All seven professors interviewed
by The Daily last week gave
hearty support to the new pro
gram which has a 1991 deadline
for achieving financial solvency.
Stanford began offering special
courses to adult community mem
bers in the fall quarter. Fourteen
faculty members have taught
seven courses for the last two
quarters. Nine more professors
will teach courses spring quarter.
Adult students pay $100 dollars
per unit for credit which is not
applicable to a Stanford degree.
Nearly 400 community members,
aged 25 to 60, have taken advan
tage of the program.
The Faculty Senate has set a
1991 deadline for the new pro

gram to register in the black, ex
pand on course offerings and at
tract more community members.
What attracts professors to the
program?
"Money," answered History
Prof. James Sheehan. "And the
opportunity to teach a variety of
students." Sheehan taught a Eu
ropean history class called "War
and European Society" fall quar
ter.
Besides their standard Stanford
teaching salary, professors receive
a bonus — drawn from a special
Continuing Studies fund — for
their extra teaching. The profes
sors, most of whom are senior fac
ulty or professors emeriti, receive
a flat rate of $2,500 per two-unit
class, $3,500 per three-unit class
and $4,500 per four-unit class.
Saying that the extra teaching
is "hard work" and "time con
suming," English Prof. Ronald
Rebholz nonetheless emphasized
that the extra time in the class
room did not detract from his
other teaching. Rebholz's fall Con
tinuing Studies quarter course,
"Masterpieces of English Litera
ture II" added 12 to 14 extra
hours of work per week to his
schedule, he estimated.
While Rebholz admitted that
the teaching took "time away from
my Shakespeare book," he said
working with adults heightened
his enthusiasm for teaching.
"I think the program is excel
lent. I enjoy teaching students who
aren't in the conventional Stan
ford mode. They're very lively,"
he said.
According to Dean of Continu
ing Studies Marsh McCall, the
program stipulates that the adult
classes supplement, rather than
replace, regular classes. "There
are to be no trade-offs," he said.

McCall compared his liberal
arts professors who teach the
adult classes to professors in tech
nical fields who profit from
private consulting work.
Preparation for the adult class
"directly substitutes" as prepara
tion for his undergraduate class,
said Psychiatry Prof. Ronald
Ciaranello.
"A lot of the material I used
... I will subsequently use in my
undergraduate molecular biology
course," he said. "If it affected
my research I wouldn't be doing
it."
Dean of the Chapel Bob Gregg
said his class' evening schedule
allows him to teach "in a time
(he) already had clear," although
Geophysics Prof. Michael McWil
liams admitted his course "takes
away from family time."
Gregg also noted that teaching
adults keeps him more alert.
