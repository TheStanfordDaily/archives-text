# Ex-model slams media's depiction of women
## 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
"I used to hate feminists and
women's libbers," said Ann
Simonton, a former model and
now an outspoken advocate for
women's rights, who spoke against
the objectification of women and
violent pornography Thursday
night in Trancos House.
Simonton, who began modeling
when she was 14, is one of the
former cover models who is fea
tured in this month's Sports Il
lustrated 25th Anniversary Swim
suit Issue. She has also appeared
on the covers of Vogue and Seven
teen magazines.
During a two-and-a-half hour
speech and slide show presenta
tion, Simonton said she left the
modeling industry and picked up

the fight for women's rights when
she realized how dangerous ad
vertisements can be for women
and experienced the danger per
sonally.
"We see 1,600 ads a day, and
our idea of a good time is what
we see on TV," she said. Adver
tisements often portray women as
"scatterbrained and passive,"
Simonton said. "Women are dis
membered and compartmen
talized, and (as a result) women
end up looking at themselves in
body parts â€” it takes their hu
manity away," she said.
The degradation of women in
the advertisements, especially
those that portray women as
"bonded and helpless," also has
an adverse affect on relationships
with men. "Fifty percent of all
women are beaten by their lovers

or husband at least one time,"
according to Simonton.
In an interview with Sports Il
lustrated Simonton said she saw
a clear connection between her
modeling and a 1971 incident
when she was gang-raped at knife
point in a New York City park.
"There is a glamorization of
hate, violence and killing in our
culture, and the position for
women in the '90s that advertise
ments are promoting puts women
on their backs," Simonton said.
Slides from her presentation in
cluded ads from women's clothes
designers Guess, Gitano and
Benetton. The second part of
Simonton's presentation showed
graphic, violent pictures from
Hustler and other magazines fa
mous for their pornographic pic
tures of women.

She said gang rope, child
molestation and necrophilia are
common themes in our media and
"We all contribute in the fact that
we adhere to the beauty standard
'younger is better.' "
Everyone must fight against
the objectification of women,
Simonton urged. To further this
cause, Simonton founded Media
Watch, a non-profit organization
based in Santa Cruz, Calif., which
scrutinizes images of women in
the media.
She has also participated in
demonstrations against the
mistreatment of women, been ar
rested 11 times and shaved her
head to show that women's inner
beauty must be appreciated.
Senior David Levine said "The
beauty of what Simonton does is
to eradicate ignorance."
