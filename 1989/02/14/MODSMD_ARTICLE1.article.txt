# Campbell's exit: end of era for Hoover and Stanford
## 
### Rob Burwell Staff writer 
An era in Stanford history will soon
end.
On Aug. 31, W. Glenn Campbell, the
controversial and notoriously outspoken
director of the Hoover Institution for
War, Revolution and Peace will step
down after 30 years of leadership.
Many students and faculty believe
that with the end of Campbell's tenure
at Hoover, much of the tension which
has marked the past 30 years of
Stanford-Hoover relations will relax.
Hoover was founded as a resource
center housing extensive library and ar
chival materials in 1919. But in 1959,
the institution gained independence
from the University when, according to
the wishes of President Hoover, the

Board of Trustees declared the center
"an independent institution within the
frame of Stanford University."
A troubled relationship
Stanford-Hoover ties, though brittle,
have survived a number of University
presidents, petitions and accusations,
and weathered the 1986-87 fight over
locating the Reagan Library on campus.
Campbell and Political Science Prof.
John Manley, a long-standing Hoover
critic, speculated about the probable fu
ture of the two institutions in speeches
last month at Mirlo House.
Manley argued that the end to Camp
bell's reign will not mean better
Stanford-Hoover relations. "The
administration wants us to think that
once he's gone, that's it for Hoover prob

'There is not the slightest
chance that Hoover and
Stanford will be separate
any time in the forseeable
future. They have much
too much to gain from one
another.'

lems. [ Hoover] will still be independent
and get conservative money and push
conservative causes," Manley said.
"I never thought Campbell was the
problem. I'm touched by his honesty.

We may get some blow-dried successor
who won't say mush. I'd vote to keep
Campbell around. I'm afraid Campbell's
successor will just clean Hoover up a
little," Manley said.
The crux of the issue is Hoover's in
dependence within the framework of the
University, Manley argued. He said he
wondered how a university, supposedly
motivated by the free discussion of ideas,
could allow itself to become linked with
an institution free from the normal ac
ademic procedures that govern Univer
sity spending and appointments.
Campbell attacked the issue of
Stanford-Hoover tensions from a com
pletely different perspective, arguing
that issues of money and conflicting
ideologies elicit takeover attempts by
the University.

Conservative vs. liberal?
Campbell defined much of the con
troversy in conservative-liberal terms,
relating the anecdote of why Hoover
Tower leans to the right. As the story
goes, Campbell said, "It's an optical il
lusion, because the rest of the campus
leans so far to the left. Hoover Tower
points straight up."
Campbell denied Hoover's alleged po
litical biases asserting that the role of
Hoover included nothing more than
"scholarship, competition of ideas and
education."
Manley argued that the tower anec
dote, a favorite of Campbell, "[er
roneously] redefines the problem of
Hoover in ideological terms — just a
political fight between liberal and con-
