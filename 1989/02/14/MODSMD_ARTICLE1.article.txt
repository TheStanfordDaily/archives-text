# Campbell's exit: end of era for Hoover and Stanford
## 
### Rob Burwell Staff writer 
An era in Stanford history will soon
end.
On Aug. 31, W. Glenn Campbell, the
controversial and notoriously outspoken
director of the Hoover Institution for
War, Revolution and Peace will step
down after 30 years of leadership.
Many students and faculty believe
that with the end of Campbell's tenure
at Hoover, much of the tension which
has marked the past 30 years of
Stanford-Hoover relations will relax.
Hoover was founded as a resource
center housing extensive library and ar
chival materials in 1919. But in 1959,
the institution gained independence
from the University when, according to
the wishes of President Hoover, the

Board of Trustees declared the center
"an independent institution within the
frame of Stanford University."
A troubled relationship
Stanford-Hoover ties, though brittle,
have survived a number of University
presidents, petitions and accusations,
and weathered the 1986-87 fight over
locating the Reagan Library on campus.
Campbell and Political Science Prof.
John Manley, a long-standing Hoover
critic, speculated about the probable fu
ture of the two institutions in speeches
last month at Mirlo House.
Manley argued that the end to Camp
bell's reign will not mean better
Stanford-Hoover relations. "The
administration wants us to think that
once he's gone, that's it for Hoover prob

'There is not the slightest
chance that Hoover and
Stanford will be separate
any time in the forseeable
future. They have much
too much to gain from one
another.'

lems. [ Hoover] will still be independent
and get conservative money and push
conservative causes," Manley said.
"I never thought Campbell was the
problem. I'm touched by his honesty.

We may get some blow-dried successor
who won't say mush. I'd vote to keep
Campbell around. I'm afraid Campbell's
successor will just clean Hoover up a
little," Manley said.
The crux of the issue is Hoover's in
dependence within the framework of the
University, Manley argued. He said he
wondered how a university, supposedly
motivated by the free discussion of ideas,
could allow itself to become linked with
an institution free from the normal ac
ademic procedures that govern Univer
sity spending and appointments.
Campbell attacked the issue of
Stanford-Hoover tensions from a com
pletely different perspective, arguing
that issues of money and conflicting
ideologies elicit takeover attempts by
the University.

Conservative vs. liberal?
Campbell defined much of the con
troversy in conservative-liberal terms,
relating the anecdote of why Hoover
Tower leans to the right. As the story
goes, Campbell said, "It's an optical il
lusion, because the rest of the campus
leans so far to the left. Hoover Tower
points straight up."
Campbell denied Hoover's alleged po
litical biases asserting that the role of
Hoover included nothing more than
"scholarship, competition of ideas and
education."
Manley argued that the tower anec
dote, a favorite of Campbell, "[er
roneously] redefines the problem of
Hoover in ideological terms — just a
political fight between liberal and con-
servative. If you see it this way
you will ignore it."
, However, University President
Donald Kennedy predicted "a
gradual scholarly convergence of
Hoover and Stanford." He said he
Iloubts the issue of whether Hoo
ver runs according to an ideolog
ical agenda or not "will be very
interesting to anybody in the
'905."
Future separation
-. Campbell predicted at Mirlo
that Hoover and the University
would certainly be separate by the
turn of the century and added
"the important question is
whether they will be separate
before 1991."
However, responding to a fac
ulty petition last May demanding
that Hoover be brought under
normal academic control or
separated from the University,
Campbell issued a statement in
dicating his preference that
Stanford and Hoover remain
linked.
"Because the symbiosis between
Stanford and Hoover is potentially
so productive, it distresses me to
see attacks on Hoover renewed.
Much can be gained by strength
ening the cooperative spirit, and
I hope the Stanford faculty share
this view," he wrote.
Kennedy, disagreeing with
Campbell's prediction of a separa
tion, emphasized the mutual
benefits accorded to both institu
tions by their interaction.
"There is not the slightest
chance that Hoover and Stanford
will be separate any time in the
forseeable future. They have
much too much to gain from one
another The trustees are the sole
jgai owners of Hoover. I don't
think they have any intention of
letting that happen," he said.
The trustees' control Hoover's
endowment, appoint members to
its Board of Overseers and have
the final say in the selection of
new directors.
Manley also doubted that any
separation would be possible in
the near future. "[Campbell] has

more confidence in the adminis
tration than I do. I don't believe
Hoover and Stanford will be sep
arate until the University and the
Board get the nerve to face the
real problem of Hoover and do
something about it,"he said.
Rebholz said he completely

agreed with Manley's assessment
of the possibility of a Stanford-
Hoover separation.
"Neither Kennedy nor the
Board has the guts or courage to
make that move, for one reason
— the big donations from com
panies like Hewlett-Packard to
both Stanford and Hoover. They
are frightened from alienating
that money from Stanford," he
said.
"It's a purely financial deci

sion," Rebholz added. He called
the situation "intolerable" and
said, "There are no principles in
volved, only cash."
Though Kennedy said he
thought separation was out of the
question, he said that improve
ment in the Stanford-Hoover re
lationship through gradual
change is possible.
Acting on the recommendations
of the Ward and Dornbusch Com
mittees — two committees com
missioned by the University in
1984 and 1985 to look into rela
tions between Stanford and Hoo
ver — a number of changes have
been made in the relationship al
ready, according to Kennedy.
These changes have included an
alteration of the appointment
process of Hoover fellows, giving
Stanford increased authority in
the decision-making. "I believe
there will be further changes, but
not dramatic change," Kennedy
said.
Normal acadcmic governance
If Manley were to have his way,
Hoover would be brought under
what he and the petitions have
called "normal academic gover
nance."
"Hoover is frequently identified
as 'Stanford's Hoover Institu
tion,' " Manley argued. "We are
inevitably linked to them and held
publicly accountable for their ac
tivities without normal University
controls."
Imposing normal academic con
trols would dictate a repeal of the
political mission of Hoover, and
without its independence, Hoover
would be defined as a normal
resource center of Stanford, Man
ley said.
In 1959, Manley argued, "Hoo
ver became a leading center for
policy research, independent of
University academic governance.
It's policy mission was spelled out
by [Herbert] Hoover and Camp
bell. There was much to offer con
servative donors."
In a February 1988 Viewpoint
published in The Daily, Manley
contended that "No university can
tolerate within its midst a highly
autonomous, politically active

think tank, whether that think
tank espouses the view of Adam
Smith or Karl Marx."
Manley speculated at Mirlo
that, with the imposition of aca
demic controls, "The right wing
money would dry up, and the
problem of Hoover would go away.

It would no longer be attractive
for money to go into Stanford's
campus without Campbell's con
trol of its distribution."
The University would also be
in control of who would be hired
by Hoover. Now there are "two
tiers" of Hoover scholars, Manley
argued, those who go through
Kennedy's office, and those who

are simply appointed by Campbell.
Rebholz added that "normal ac
ademic governance would change
the appointments of new direc
tors." Currently, there are seven
people affiliated with Hoover on
the selection committee and three
from the University.
With academic governance, this
imbalance in favor of Hoover
would change, Rebholz said. A na
tional search would have to be
conducted with presumably equal
representation, he added.
Continued academic freedom
At Mirlo, Campbell said he did
not think Hoover's endowment —
approximately $120 million — or
its library and archival resources
could easily be separated from
Stanford.
Manley allayed fears that a
Stanford-Hoover divorce would
mean a decline in academic
quality or in access to resources.
"It's not a good guess that
[Hoover] would remove the libra
ry. Those materials don't belong
to Glenn Campbell. The Univer
sity has paid for most of the ar
chives and library resources," he
said.
"The political arm of Hoover
would have to go or be shut down"
should academic guidelines be im
plemented, Manley argued, "but
legitimate scholars would not have
to worry about academic control."
On the issue of the possible ex
odus of scholars, Manley said,
"I'm not interested in purging
Hoover, only placing it under nor
mal academic controls."
Manley said an end to Hoover's
political force would actually im
prove the academic resources
available through Hoover,
arguing that an apolitical Hoover
could attract a more politically di
verse faculty.
Debate over conservatism
The debate over Hoover's al
leged conservative political orien
tation has raged since the
beginnings of Hoover's indepen
dence.
The issue is much more serious


'Because the sym
biosis between Stan
ford and Hoover is
potentially so produc
tive, it distresses me
to see attacks on
Hoover renewed.'
— W. Glenn Campbell


'No university can
tolerate within its
midst a highly auton
omous, politically ac
tive think tank,
whether that think
tank espouses the
view of Adam Smith
or Karl Marx.'
— John Manley
to many Hoover scholars than
Campbell's anecdote suggests.
In Nov. 1987, George Marotta,
a senior fellow at Hoover, pub
lished a study of registered Re
publicans and Democrats at
Stanford aimed at disproving the
stereotype of Hoover as a right
wing organization.
He concluded that while more
than one-third of Hoover regis
tered Democrat, 90 percent of the
English Department and over 80
percent of the Political Science De
partment faculty registered Dem
ocrat. Both departments are seen
by Hoover scholars as the leading
thorns in the side of the institu
tion.
Campbell unsurprisingly
referred to the Marotta study fa
vorably, suggesting it evidenced
who was truly politically biased.
Manley argued it was just part of
the effort to "confuse and obfus
cate" the debate about the role of
Hoover as a conservative think
tank.

"People at Hoover brag about
how influential they have been.
They claim a role in the
Reagan revolution, and I'm in
clined to believe them," Manley
said.
During Campbell's tenure as
Hoover director, there have been
numerous strains in the relation
ship between the University and
Hoover, including three petitions
in five years backed by Manley
and Rebholz asking for inquiries
into Stanford-Hoover relations.
The most recent petition, signed
by 57 faculty last May, says the
"Board of Trustees should take
immediate steps to bring the Hoo
ver Institution under normal ac
ademic governance; failing that,
the Trustees should commence
plans to end connections between
the political arm of the Hoover
Institution...
Stanford's alumni are "largely
ignorant of the struggle with Hoo
ver," Manley explained. "Stanford
has been getting trashed in the
national press. That should be a
concern to Stanford's alumni. The
controversy Hoover has embroiled
us in has done us no good," Man
ley said.

Manley speculated at Mirlo
that, with the imposition of aca
demic controls, "The right wing
money would dry up, and the
problem of Hoover would go away.

It would no longer be attractive
for money to go into Stanford's
campus without Campbell's con
trol of its distribution."
The University would also be
in control of who would be hired
by Hoover. Now there are "two
tiers" of Hoover scholars, Manley
argued, those who go through
Kennedy's office, and those who

are simply appointed by Campbell.
Rebholz added that "normal ac
ademic governance would change
the appointments of new direc
tors." Currently, there are seven
people affiliated with Hoover on
the selection committee and three
from the University.
With academic governance, this
imbalance in favor of Hoover
would change, Rebholz said. A na
tional search would have to be
conducted with presumably equal
representation, he added.
Continued academic freedom
At Mirlo, Campbell said he did
not think Hoover's endowment —
approximately $120 million — or
its library and archival resources
could easily be separated from
Stanford.
Manley allayed fears that a
Stanford-Hoover divorce would
mean a decline in academic
quality or in access to resources.
"It's not a good guess that
[Hoover] would remove the libra
ry. Those materials don't belong
to Glenn Campbell. The Univer
sity has paid for most of the ar
chives and library resources," he
said.
"The political arm of Hoover
would have to go or be shut down"
should academic guidelines be im
plemented, Manley argued, "but
legitimate scholars would not have
to worry about academic control."
On the issue of the possible ex
odus of scholars, Manley said,
"I'm not interested in purging
Hoover, only placing it under nor
mal academic controls."
Manley said an end to Hoover's
political force would actually im
prove the academic resources
available through Hoover,
arguing that an apolitical Hoover
could attract a more politically di

to many Hoover scholars than
Campbell's anecdote suggests.
In Nov. 1987, George Marotta,
a senior fellow at Hoover, pub
lished a study of registered Re
publicans and Democrats at
Stanford aimed at disproving the
stereotype of Hoover as a right
wing organization.
He concluded that while more
than one-third of Hoover regis
tered Democrat, 90 percent of the
English Department and over 80
percent of the Political Science De
partment faculty registered Dem
ocrat. Both departments are seen
by Hoover scholars as the leading
thorns in the side of the institu
tion.
Campbell unsurprisingly
referred to the Marotta study fa
vorably, suggesting it evidenced
who was truly politically biased.
Manley argued it was just part of
the effort to "confuse and obfus
cate" the debate about the role of
Hoover as a conservative think
tank.

"People at Hoover brag about
how influential they have been.
They claim a role in the
Reagan revolution, and I'm in
clined to believe them," Manley
said.
During Campbell's tenure as
Hoover director, there have been
numerous strains in the relation
ship between the University and
Hoover, including three petitions
in five years backed by Manley
and Rebholz asking for inquiries
into Stanford-Hoover relations.
The most recent petition, signed
by 57 faculty last May, says the
"Board of Trustees should take
immediate steps to bring the Hoo
ver Institution under normal ac
ademic governance; failing that,
the Trustees should commence
plans to end connections between
the political arm of the Hoover
Institution...
Stanford's alumni are "largely
ignorant of the struggle with Hoo
ver," Manley explained. "Stanford
has been getting trashed in the
national press. That should be a
concern to Stanford's alumni. The
controversy Hoover has embroiled
us in has done us no good," Man
ley said.
An era in Stanford history will soon
end.
On Aug. 31, W. Glenn Campbell, the
controversial and notoriously outspoken
director of the Hoover Institution for
War, Revolution and Peace will step
down after 30 years of leadership.
Many students and faculty believe
that with the end of Campbell's tenure
at Hoover, much of the tension which
has marked the past 30 years of
Stanford-Hoover relations will relax.
Hoover was founded as a resource
center housing extensive library and ar
chival materials in 1919. But in 1959,
the institution gained independence
from the University when, according to
the wishes of President Hoover, the

Board of Trustees declared the center
"an independent institution within the
frame of Stanford University."
A troubled relationship
Stanford-Hoover ties, though brittle,
have survived a number of University
presidents, petitions and accusations,
and weathered the 1986-87 fight over
locating the Reagan Library on campus.
Campbell and Political Science Prof.
John Manley, a long-standing Hoover
critic, speculated about the probable fu
ture of the two institutions in speeches
last month at Mirlo House.
Manley argued that the end to Camp
bell's reign will not mean better
Stanford-Hoover relations. "The
administration wants us to think that
once he's gone, that's it for Hoover prob

'There is not the slightest
chance that Hoover and
Stanford will be separate

future. They have much

lems. [ Hoover] will still be independent
and get conservative money and push
conservative causes," Manley said.
"I never thought Campbell was the
problem. I'm touched by his honesty.

We may get some blow-dried successor
who won't say mush. I'd vote to keep
Campbell around. I'm afraid Campbell's
successor will just clean Hoover up a
little," Manley said.
The crux of the issue is Hoover's in
dependence within the framework of the
University, Manley argued. He said he
wondered how a university, supposedly
motivated by the free discussion of ideas,
could allow itself to become linked with
an institution free from the normal ac
ademic procedures that govern Univer
sity spending and appointments.
Campbell attacked the issue of
Stanford-Hoover tensions from a com
pletely different perspective, arguing
that issues of money and conflicting
ideologies elicit takeover attempts by
the University.

Conservative vs. liberal?
Campbell defined much of the con
troversy in conservative-liberal terms,
relating the anecdote of why Hoover
Tower leans to the right. As the story
goes, Campbell said, "It's an optical il
lusion, because the rest of the campus
leans so far to the left. Hoover Tower
points straight up."
Campbell denied Hoover's alleged po
litical biases asserting that the role of
Hoover included nothing more than
"scholarship, competition of ideas and
education."
Manley argued that the tower anec
dote, a favorite of Campbell, "[er
roneously] redefines the problem of
Hoover in ideological terms — just a
political fight between liberal and con-
servative. If you see it this way
you will ignore it."
, However, University President
Donald Kennedy predicted "a
gradual scholarly convergence of
Hoover and Stanford." He said he
Iloubts the issue of whether Hoo
ver runs according to an ideolog
ical agenda or not "will be very
interesting to anybody in the
'905."
Future separation
-. Campbell predicted at Mirlo
that Hoover and the University
would certainly be separate by the
turn of the century and added
"the important question is
whether they will be separate
before 1991."
However, responding to a fac
ulty petition last May demanding
that Hoover be brought under
normal academic control or
separated from the University,
Campbell issued a statement in
dicating his preference that
Stanford and Hoover remain
linked.
"Because the symbiosis between
Stanford and Hoover is potentially
so productive, it distresses me to
see attacks on Hoover renewed.
Much can be gained by strength
ening the cooperative spirit, and
I hope the Stanford faculty share
this view," he wrote.
Kennedy, disagreeing with
Campbell's prediction of a separa
tion, emphasized the mutual
benefits accorded to both institu
tions by their interaction.
"There is not the slightest
chance that Hoover and Stanford
will be separate any time in the
forseeable future. They have
much too much to gain from one
another The trustees are the sole
jgai owners of Hoover. I don't
think they have any intention of
letting that happen," he said.
The trustees' control Hoover's
endowment, appoint members to
its Board of Overseers and have
the final say in the selection of
new directors.
Manley also doubted that any
separation would be possible in
the near future. "[Campbell] has

more confidence in the adminis
tration than I do. I don't believe
Hoover and Stanford will be sep
arate until the University and the
Board get the nerve to face the
real problem of Hoover and do
something about it,"he said.
Rebholz said he completely

agreed with Manley's assessment
of the possibility of a Stanford-
Hoover separation.
"Neither Kennedy nor the
Board has the guts or courage to
make that move, for one reason
— the big donations from com
panies like Hewlett-Packard to
both Stanford and Hoover. They
are frightened from alienating
that money from Stanford," he
said.
"It's a purely financial deci

sion," Rebholz added. He called
the situation "intolerable" and
said, "There are no principles in
volved, only cash."
Though Kennedy said he
thought separation was out of the
question, he said that improve
ment in the Stanford-Hoover re
lationship through gradual
change is possible.
Acting on the recommendations
of the Ward and Dornbusch Com
mittees — two committees com
missioned by the University in
1984 and 1985 to look into rela
tions between Stanford and Hoo
ver — a number of changes have
been made in the relationship al
ready, according to Kennedy.
These changes have included an
alteration of the appointment
process of Hoover fellows, giving
Stanford increased authority in
the decision-making. "I believe
there will be further changes, but
not dramatic change," Kennedy
said.
Normal acadcmic governance
If Manley were to have his way,
Hoover would be brought under
what he and the petitions have
called "normal academic gover
nance."
"Hoover is frequently identified
as 'Stanford's Hoover Institu
tion,' " Manley argued. "We are
inevitably linked to them and held
publicly accountable for their ac
tivities without normal University
controls."
Imposing normal academic con
trols would dictate a repeal of the
political mission of Hoover, and
without its independence, Hoover
would be defined as a normal
resource center of Stanford, Man
ley said.
In 1959, Manley argued, "Hoo
ver became a leading center for
policy research, independent of
University academic governance.
It's policy mission was spelled out
by [Herbert] Hoover and Camp
bell. There was much to offer con
servative donors."
In a February 1988 Viewpoint
published in The Daily, Manley
contended that "No university can
tolerate within its midst a highly
autonomous, politically active

think tank, whether that think
tank espouses the view of Adam
Smith or Karl Marx."
Manley speculated at Mirlo
that, with the imposition of aca
demic controls, "The right wing
money would dry up, and the
problem of Hoover would go away.

It would no longer be attractive
for money to go into Stanford's
campus without Campbell's con
trol of its distribution."
The University would also be
in control of who would be hired

argued, those who go through

are simply appointed by Campbell.
Rebholz added that "normal ac

Donald Kennedy predicted "a
gradual scholarly convergence of
Hoover and Stanford." He said he

Future separation

that Hoover and the University
would certainly be separate by the
turn of the century and added
"the important question is
whether they will be separate
before 1991."
However, responding to a fac
ulty petition last May demanding
that Hoover be brought under
normal academic control or
separated from the University,
Campbell issued a statement in
dicating his preference that
Stanford and Hoover remain
linked.
"Because the symbiosis between
Stanford and Hoover is potentially

see attacks on Hoover renewed.

benefits accorded to both institu
tions by their interaction.
"There is not the slightest
chance that Hoover and Stanford
will be separate any time in the
forseeable future. They have
much too much to gain from one
another The trustees are the sole

The trustees' control Hoover's
endowment, appoint members to
its Board of Overseers and have

arate until the University and the

Hoover separation.

— the big donations from com
panies like Hewlett-Packard to
both Stanford and Hoover. They
are frightened from alienating
that money from Stanford," he
said.
"It's a purely financial deci

sion," Rebholz added. He called
the situation "intolerable" and
said, "There are no principles in
volved, only cash."
Though Kennedy said he
thought separation was out of the
question, he said that improve
ment in the Stanford-Hoover re
lationship through gradual
change is possible.
Acting on the recommendations
of the Ward and Dornbusch Com
mittees — two committees com
missioned by the University in
1984 and 1985 to look into rela
tions between Stanford and Hoo
ver — a number of changes have
been made in the relationship al
ready, according to Kennedy.
These changes have included an
alteration of the appointment
process of Hoover fellows, giving
Stanford increased authority in
the decision-making. "I believe
there will be further changes, but
not dramatic change," Kennedy
said.
Normal acadcmic governance
If Manley were to have his way,
Hoover would be brought under
what he and the petitions have
called "normal academic gover
nance."
"Hoover is frequently identified
as 'Stanford's Hoover Institu
tion,' " Manley argued. "We are
inevitably linked to them and held
publicly accountable for their ac
tivities without normal University
controls."
Imposing normal academic con
trols would dictate a repeal of the
political mission of Hoover, and
without its independence, Hoover
would be defined as a normal
resource center of Stanford, Man
ley said.
In 1959, Manley argued, "Hoo
ver became a leading center for
policy research, independent of
University academic governance.
It's policy mission was spelled out
by [Herbert] Hoover and Camp
bell. There was much to offer con
servative donors."
In a February 1988 Viewpoint
published in The Daily, Manley
contended that "No university can
tolerate within its midst a highly
autonomous, politically active

think tank, whether that think
tank espouses the view of Adam
Smith or Karl Marx."
Manley speculated at Mirlo
that, with the imposition of aca
demic controls, "The right wing
money would dry up, and the
problem of Hoover would go away.

It would no longer be attractive
for money to go into Stanford's
campus without Campbell's con
trol of its distribution."
The University would also be
in control of who would be hired
by Hoover. Now there are "two
tiers" of Hoover scholars, Manley
argued, those who go through
Kennedy's office, and those who

are simply appointed by Campbell.
Rebholz added that "normal ac
ademic governance would change
the appointments of new direc
tors." Currently, there are seven
people affiliated with Hoover on
the selection committee and three
from the University.
With academic governance, this
imbalance in favor of Hoover
would change, Rebholz said. A na
tional search would have to be
conducted with presumably equal
representation, he added.
Continued academic freedom
At Mirlo, Campbell said he did
not think Hoover's endowment —
approximately $120 million — or
its library and archival resources
could easily be separated from
Stanford.
Manley allayed fears that a
Stanford-Hoover divorce would
mean a decline in academic
quality or in access to resources.
"It's not a good guess that
[Hoover] would remove the libra
ry. Those materials don't belong
to Glenn Campbell. The Univer
sity has paid for most of the ar
chives and library resources," he
said.
"The political arm of Hoover
would have to go or be shut down"
should academic guidelines be im
plemented, Manley argued, "but
legitimate scholars would not have
to worry about academic control."
On the issue of the possible ex
odus of scholars, Manley said,
"I'm not interested in purging
Hoover, only placing it under nor
mal academic controls."
Manley said an end to Hoover's
political force would actually im
prove the academic resources
available through Hoover,
arguing that an apolitical Hoover
could attract a more politically di
verse faculty.
Debate over conservatism
The debate over Hoover's al
leged conservative political orien
tation has raged since the
beginnings of Hoover's indepen
dence.
The issue is much more serious

biosis between Stan
ford and Hoover is

tive, it distresses me

to many Hoover scholars than
Campbell's anecdote suggests.
In Nov. 1987, George Marotta,
a senior fellow at Hoover, pub
lished a study of registered Re
publicans and Democrats at
Stanford aimed at disproving the
stereotype of Hoover as a right
wing organization.
He concluded that while more
than one-third of Hoover regis
tered Democrat, 90 percent of the
English Department and over 80
percent of the Political Science De
partment faculty registered Dem
ocrat. Both departments are seen
by Hoover scholars as the leading
thorns in the side of the institu
tion.
Campbell unsurprisingly
referred to the Marotta study fa
vorably, suggesting it evidenced
who was truly politically biased.
Manley argued it was just part of
the effort to "confuse and obfus
cate" the debate about the role of
Hoover as a conservative think
tank.

"People at Hoover brag about
how influential they have been.
They claim a role in the
Reagan revolution, and I'm in
clined to believe them," Manley
said.
During Campbell's tenure as
Hoover director, there have been
numerous strains in the relation
ship between the University and
Hoover, including three petitions
in five years backed by Manley
and Rebholz asking for inquiries
into Stanford-Hoover relations.
The most recent petition, signed
by 57 faculty last May, says the
"Board of Trustees should take
immediate steps to bring the Hoo
ver Institution under normal ac
ademic governance; failing that,
the Trustees should commence
plans to end connections between
the political arm of the Hoover
Institution...
Stanford's alumni are "largely
ignorant of the struggle with Hoo
ver," Manley explained. "Stanford
has been getting trashed in the
national press. That should be a
concern to Stanford's alumni. The
controversy Hoover has embroiled
us in has done us no good," Man
ley said.
An era in Stanford history will soon
end.
On Aug. 31, W. Glenn Campbell, the
controversial and notoriously outspoken
director of the Hoover Institution for
War, Revolution and Peace will step
down after 30 years of leadership.
Many students and faculty believe
that with the end of Campbell's tenure
at Hoover, much of the tension which
has marked the past 30 years of
Stanford-Hoover relations will relax.
Hoover was founded as a resource
center housing extensive library and ar
chival materials in 1919. But in 1959,
the institution gained independence
from the University when, according to
the wishes of President Hoover, the

Board of Trustees declared the center
"an independent institution within the
frame of Stanford University."
A troubled relationship
Stanford-Hoover ties, though brittle,
have survived a number of University
presidents, petitions and accusations,
and weathered the 1986-87 fight over
locating the Reagan Library on campus.
Campbell and Political Science Prof.
John Manley, a long-standing Hoover
critic, speculated about the probable fu
ture of the two institutions in speeches
last month at Mirlo House.
Manley argued that the end to Camp
bell's reign will not mean better
Stanford-Hoover relations. "The
administration wants us to think that
once he's gone, that's it for Hoover prob

'There is not the slightest
chance that Hoover and
Stanford will be separate
any time in the forseeable
future. They have much
too much to gain from one
another.'
— Donald Kennedy

lems. [ Hoover] will still be independent
and get conservative money and push
conservative causes," Manley said.
"I never thought Campbell was the
problem. I'm touched by his honesty.

We may get some blow-dried successor
who won't say mush. I'd vote to keep
Campbell around. I'm afraid Campbell's
successor will just clean Hoover up a
little," Manley said.
The crux of the issue is Hoover's in
dependence within the framework of the
University, Manley argued. He said he
wondered how a university, supposedly
motivated by the free discussion of ideas,
could allow itself to become linked with
an institution free from the normal ac
ademic procedures that govern Univer
sity spending and appointments.
Campbell attacked the issue of
Stanford-Hoover tensions from a com
pletely different perspective, arguing
that issues of money and conflicting
ideologies elicit takeover attempts by
the University.

Conservative vs. liberal?
Campbell defined much of the con
troversy in conservative-liberal terms,
relating the anecdote of why Hoover
Tower leans to the right. As the story
goes, Campbell said, "It's an optical il
lusion, because the rest of the campus
leans so far to the left. Hoover Tower
points straight up."
Campbell denied Hoover's alleged po
litical biases asserting that the role of
Hoover included nothing more than
"scholarship, competition of ideas and
education."
Manley argued that the tower anec
dote, a favorite of Campbell, "[er
roneously] redefines the problem of
Hoover in ideological terms — just a
political fight between liberal and con-
servative. If you see it this way
you will ignore it."

Donald Kennedy predicted "a

Hoover and Stanford." He said he

He concluded that while more
than one-third of Hoover regis
tered Democrat, 90 percent of the
English Department and over 80
percent of the Political Science De
partment faculty registered Dem
ocrat. Both departments are seen
by Hoover scholars as the leading
thorns in the side of the institu
tion.
Campbell unsurprisingly
referred to the Marotta study fa
vorably, suggesting it evidenced
who was truly politically biased.
Manley argued it was just part of
the effort to "confuse and obfus
cate" the debate about the role of
Hoover as a conservative think
tank.

"People at Hoover brag about
how influential they have been.
They claim a role in the
Reagan revolution, and I'm in
clined to believe them," Manley
said.
During Campbell's tenure as
Hoover director, there have been
numerous strains in the relation
ship between the University and
Hoover, including three petitions
in five years backed by Manley
and Rebholz asking for inquiries
into Stanford-Hoover relations.
The most recent petition, signed
by 57 faculty last May, says the
"Board of Trustees should take
immediate steps to bring the Hoo
ver Institution under normal ac
ademic governance; failing that,
the Trustees should commence
plans to end connections between
the political arm of the Hoover
Institution...
Stanford's alumni are "largely
ignorant of the struggle with Hoo
ver," Manley explained. "Stanford
has been getting trashed in the
national press. That should be a
concern to Stanford's alumni. The
controversy Hoover has embroiled
us in has done us no good," Man
ley said.
