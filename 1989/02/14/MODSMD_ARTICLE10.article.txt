### Lara Filson 
On Valentine's Day couples usually er\joy the ro
mantic atmosphere of dim lights and the radio play
ing soft music in the background.
But on San Francisco radio station KITS, com
monly known as Live 105, an advertisement has
been running during the past week which has caused
some in the gay, lesbian and bisexual communities
at Stanford to adjust their dials.
Promoting a Valentine's Day give-away of a week
end at the St. Francis hotel in San Francisco for
one lucky couple, the "equal opportunity station,"
according to the advertisement, also includes an
additional prize selected by the winning couple.
For a gay couple, the station offers two tickets
to "Torch Song Trilogy," a movie dealing with gay
life in the 19705. For a lesbian couple, the choice
is "four D-cell batteries."

For a heterosexual couple the bonus prize is
money for roses and champagne.
Phil Fernandez, an officer at the Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Community Center at Stanford, said
the advertisement promoted discussion among fiv
or six members of the gay and lesbian community
yesterday.
"The first verdict on the ad was that it was neat
and gay-positive since they recognized tli
homosexual community," Fernandez explained. "B <
then we decided it was actually uncool and offensi\
especially the part about the four D-cell batteri<-<
Little Rickee Stewarte, a DJ at the radio station,
said he had not heard of any complaints registered
at the station by gay rights groups and said th
no malicious intent was behind the station's pi
motional advertisement
Fernandez said that at the present time no ndion
has been planned against the station.
