## Knight Fellowships managing director retires from post 
### Jonathan Eisenberg 
After helping to provide a gen
eration of outstanding mid
career journalists with the
opportunity to study at Stanford
for a year, Harry Press, manag
ing director of the John S.
Knight Fellowships for Profes
sional Journalists, will be retir
ing from his post in October.
"It's hard for me to imagine
the program without him," said
Communication Prof. James
Risser, director of the program
and himself a 1973-74 Knight
Fellow and a two-time Pulitzer
Prize winning journalist. "Harry
interviewed me for my fellow
ship," Risser reminisced.
Each year, Press and Risser
contribute to a selection process
that chooses 12 American jour
nalists and five to seven inter
national journalists to receive
fellowships, including a $25,000
stipend and a book allowance.

"I have overall responsibility
for the program. . . . Harry
carries out the day to day
details," Risser said. "We work
as a team." With a staff of only
three, Press, Risser and Pro
gram Assistant Relly Weiner,
Risser said there is no need for
a strict division of labor.
While the search has not
begun for a replacement for
Press, the program's staff is
seeking one person who pos
sesses both Press's talent and
credentials as a journalist and
his vast knowledge of and con
tacts at Stanford and around the
Bay Area.
Press's impressive resume
reflects his dedication to quality
communication and the written
word. He received his A.B. in
journalism from Stanford in
1936 and proceeded to work as
a copy boy on The San Francisco
Chronicle. As a reporter, he then
moved from The Anaheim Bui

letin to The Palo Alto Times
before finally joining The San
Francisco News in 1941. In
1966, Press became founding
editor of The Stanford Observer.
