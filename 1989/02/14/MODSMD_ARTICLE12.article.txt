## Lawyer suggests new Reagan-Contra tie 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Former President Reagan "partic
ipated personally and directly" in
giving favored treatment to coun
tries that supported the Contras
in Nicaragua, lawyers for Oliver
North said in a court filing aimed
at having charges against their
client dropped.
North attorney Brendan Sul
livan, opposing a compromise be
tween the independent counsel
and the Justice Department, said
in court papers released yesterday
that the proposed deal on keeping
certain secrets out of the trial
would prevent him from introduc
ing this evidence which he said
was central to North's defense.
He also criticized Attorney Gen
eral Dick Thornburgh for declin
ing "to take the political heat"
and make a separate secrets
protecting move that could lead
to charges being thrown out.
Sullivan said, "At the heart of
this case are the quid pro quo
and other third-country arrange
ments with which the Reagan ad
ministration obtained military
support for the resistance during
the so-called Boland Amendments,
and the policy that those third
country arrangements would not
be disclosed outside a limited

group of executive branch offi
cials."
The Boland amendments,
passed by Congress, restricted and
at times prohibited the spending
of federal funds in support of the
guerrilla war against the leftist
government in Nicaragua.
Former National Security Ad
viser John Poindexter testified at
the congressional Iran-Contra
hearings in 1987 that Reagan
favored making up for that lack
of official U.S. support with
money from other nations. But
the assertion that Reagan was
personally involved in arranging
to return the favors is new.
Theodore Olson, an attorney for
Reagan, declined comment on Sul
livan's filing after its contents
were described to him.
Sullivan's statements were in a
written response to U.S. District
Judge Gerhard Gesell, objecting
to a new plan for protecting na
tional security secrets at North's
trial.
The plan, worked out by inde
pendent counsel Lawrence Walsh
and the Justice Department,
"would gut the defense and guar
antee a 'cuckoo-clock' trial," Sul
livan said. It would hide "critical
information about the Reagan ad-

ministration's third-country ar
rangements for military support
of the resistance and the official
nondisclosure of those arrange
ments."
Sullivan said that the way the
government proposed to present
this information to the jury —
through a general "admission"
with no details allowed — would
leave out "that President Reagan
and top executive branch officials
participated personally and di
rectly in those arrangements."
He said under the government
proposal, the jury would never
hear about "direct personal par
ticipation in the third-country ar
rangements" by Reagan and these
officials of his administration: Na

tional Security Adviser Robert
McFarlane, Poindexter's pred
ecessor; Secretary of State George
Shultz; Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger; Chair of the
Joint Chiefs John Vessey, and the
late CIA Director William Casey.
Most of the details of the pro
posed court agreement were kept
secret, but their intent was to es
tablish nine specific categories of
information that cannot be
revealed by North in his defense.
Sullivan urged that Gesell reject
the proposed rules out of hand.
The proposed agreement be
tween Thornburgh and Walsh is
a compromise to deal with Justice
Department objections that rules
under which the trial was to be
conducted would allow North to
disclose important national secu
rity information.
Gesell is to conduct a hearing
on the agreement today.
The beginning of the trial was
put on hold Sunday when Chief
Justice William Rehnquist of the
Supreme Court granted the Jus
tice Department's request for a
stay. However, the department
has said it will ask Rehnquist to
lift the stay if Gesell approves the
agreement on testimony involving
classified information.

viser John Poindexter testified at
the congressional Iran-Contra
hearings in 1987 that Reagan
favored making up for that lack
of official U.S. support with
money from other nations. But
the assertion that Reagan was
personally involved in arranging
to return the favors is new.
Theodore Olson, an attorney for
Reagan, declined comment on Sul
livan's filing after its contents
were described to him.
Sullivan's statements were in a
written response to U.S. District
Judge Gerhard Gesell, objecting
to a new plan for protecting na
tional security secrets at North's
trial.
The plan, worked out by inde
pendent counsel Lawrence Walsh
and the Justice Department,
"would gut the defense and guar
antee a 'cuckoo-clock' trial," Sul
livan said. It would hide "critical

ministration's third-country ar
rangements for military support
of the resistance and the official
nondisclosure of those arrange
ments."
Sullivan said that the way the
government proposed to present
this information to the jury —
through a general "admission"
with no details allowed — would
leave out "that President Reagan
and top executive branch officials
participated personally and di
rectly in those arrangements."
He said under the government
proposal, the jury would never
hear about "direct personal par
ticipation in the third-country ar
rangements" by Reagan and these
officials of his administration: Na

tional Security Adviser Robert
McFarlane, Poindexter's pred
ecessor; Secretary of State George
Shultz; Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger; Chair of the
Joint Chiefs John Vessey, and the
late CIA Director William Casey.
Most of the details of the pro
posed court agreement were kept
secret, but their intent was to es
tablish nine specific categories of
information that cannot be
revealed by North in his defense.
Sullivan urged that Gesell reject
the proposed rules out of hand.
The proposed agreement be
tween Thornburgh and Walsh is
a compromise to deal with Justice
Department objections that rules
under which the trial was to be
conducted would allow North to
disclose important national secu
rity information.
Gesell is to conduct a hearing
on the agreement today.
The beginning of the trial was
put on hold Sunday when Chief
Justice William Rehnquist of the
Supreme Court granted the Jus
tice Department's request for a
stay. However, the department
has said it will ask Rehnquist to
lift the stay if Gesell approves the
agreement on testimony involving
classified information.
