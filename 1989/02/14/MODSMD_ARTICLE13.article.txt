# Nicaragua says Contra movement dead

COSTA DEL SOL, El Salvador
(AP) â€” Nicaragua is making
strong democratic commitments
because it believes the Contra
rebel movement is dead, an ad
viser to the Sandinistas said dur
ing a Central American summit
meeting yesterday.
"With the Contras' military
defeat and the passing of the
Reagan administration, the exter
nal military threat to the
Nicaraguan government that
impeded democratization is
gone," said Paul Reichler, a U.S.
lawyer employed by Nicaragua as
an adviser and representative.
Reichler spoke as the presidents
of Nicaragua, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras and Costa
Rica worked in closed session
through the first day of a two-day
summit.
Officials with the Nicaraguan
delegation said President Daniel
Ortega has proposed that the es
timated 11,000-strong Contra
force in Honduras be disbanded.
The Contras fled there after U.S.
military aid expired last year.
Under the proposal, the Contras
could accept amnesty in Nicara
gua or go to third countries. Nic
aragua would release from prison
an estimated 3,500 Contras and
former Nicaraguan National
Guardsmen.
The officials, who outlined the
proposal on condition of
anonymity, said Ortega presented
the plan to Honduran President
Jose Azcona Hoyo at the Feb. 2
inauguration of Venezuelan Pres
ident Carlos Andres Perez.
The five presidents appeared en
couraged by the mere fact of being
under the same roof after six
months of postponements, delay
and dispute over the summit's
prospects, agenda and date.
"I am sure that we, with op
timism, will analyze efforts we've
made according to Esquipulas II

and search for favorable solutions
that will promote peace and prog
ress in Central America," Presi
dent Jose Napoleon Duarte said
in brief comments as the meeting
began.
He was flanked by Alcona, Or
tega, Oscar Arias of Costa Rica
and Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala.
All except Ortega, in a green
Sandinista army uniform, wore
casual attire fitting the climate
of this seaside resort 40 miles
southeast of San Salvador.
The presidents will analyze the
successes and failures of the
Esquipulas II peace plan they
signed in Guatemala on Aug. 7,
1987. The agreement, also known

as the Arias plan for its principal
architect, was designed to pro
mote peace and democracy in the
region.
They had intended to mark the
anniversary of the signing with a
summit in August but could not
agree on an agenda. The summit
was rescheduled and has been
postponed five times.
After some initial success, the
Arias plan stalled last year.
Yesterday's discussions focused
on ways to verify democratization
and respect for human rights, of
ficials said on condition of
anonymity.
Officials said the summit's
principal subject would be enforc

ing compliance with the injunc
tion against using one signatory's
territory as a base for attacking
another, but the presidents dis
agree on verification mechanisms.
Arias is said to favor a commis
sion of Central Americans, but
Nicaraguan officials said their
government wants the United Na
tions, the Organization of Amer
ican States and human rights
groups included on such a panel.
All the presidents have ex
pressed support for the
framework constructed last week
by the Central American foreign
ministers in talks with U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar.
