# Bush's S&L plan flawed, group says
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
private group of scholars and
analysts said yesterday that Pres
ident Bush's proposal to bail out
the savings and loan industry
does not provide enough money
or reforms.
The plan, announced last week,
would provide $90 billion to close
or sell 350 insolvent S&Ls and
meet pledges made by regulators
last year in cleaning up 223 in
stitutions.
The Shadow Financial Regu
latory Committee, a group of 12
financial experts from colleges
and consulting and law firms,
praised Bush for recognizing that
the S&L problem is much more
costly than previously acknowl
edged by the government.
But, in a statement, it said,
"There is a strong possibility that
additional thrifts which are now
marginally solvent will become in
solvent in the near future. In
creases in interest rates may also
lead to financial difficulties for
many more thrift institutions."
Meanwhile, in a separate devel
opment, the Federal Deposit In
surance Corp. yesterday took con
trol of Midwest Federal Savings

& Loan Association, an insolvent
S&L in Minneapolis.
Midwest was the 11th institu
tion taken over under a program
announced by Bush last week.
The FDIC plans to assume control
of more than 200 S&Ls, insolvent
under regulatory accounting
rules, over the next four to six
weeks.
Although government regu
lators will be more strictly super
vising the institutions, the FDIC
is emphasizing that all insured
deposits will continue to be fully
protected.
Arizona State University busi
ness professor Edward Kane, a
member of the shadow regulatory
committee, estimated that 800 to
850 institutions of the nation's
3,000 thrifts are "economically in
solvent" even though regulatory
accounting rules show a far
smaller number.
"Any increase in interest rates
is going to put a lot (more) insti
tutions under water," said
Franklin Edwards, a business pro
fessor at Columbia University.
The group did not offer its own
figure to counter the administra
tion's $90 billion estimate.
