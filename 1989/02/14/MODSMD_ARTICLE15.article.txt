# Baker, Kohl discuss nuclear strategy

### 
BONN, West Germany (AP) â€”
U.S. Secretary of State James
Baker 111 said yesterday that West
Germany still supports a project
to upgrade missiles, but he ap
peared to soften U.S. demands
that NATO endorse the plan this
spring.
Baker said he and Chancellor
Helmut Kohl agreed at a "very,
very friendly" talk yesterday to
negotiate differences over the
NATO plan to develop, produce
and deploy new nuclear missiles
to replace aging shorter-range
rockets.
Kohl suggested earlier yester
day that allies could give a green
light to producing the new rockets
while delaying a vote on whether
to deploy them.
The chancellor also said
publicly for the first time that
West Germany wants a disarma
ment mandate built into NATO
strategy that would scuttle
deployment plans if progress has
been made on reducing the Soviet
advantage in conventional weap
ons.
Modernization was the main
topic of yesterday's talks, and
Baker said he was assured that
West Germany has not changed
its commitment to the project.
"This was not a decision
making meeting," Baker said.
"That is not what we are here
for. It did, I hope, clear up some
of the confusion."
The new U.S. secretary said his
meeting with Kohl and Foreign

Modernization was
the main topic of yes
terday's talks, and
Baker said he was as
sured that West Ger
many has not
changed its commit
ment to the project.

Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
also covered what steps West Ger
many has taken to tighten export
controls following U.S. complaints
that West German firms helped
Libya build a poison gas plant.
Baker said Kohl told him "in
no uncertain terms" he plans to
work out through further negoti
ations the Bonn government's dif
ferences with Washington over
what is referred to as moderniza
tion of aging, U.S.-built Lance
missiles.
The Lance system includes 88
launchers and about 700 missiles
with a range of 75 miles. It is
scheduled for replacement after
1995 with rockets capable of
reaching targets 320 miles away.
Seventy-six launchers are in West
Germany and the remainder are
deployed in Italy.
Before meeting Baker, Kohl res
tated to reporters his desire that
the North Atlantic Treaty Organ

ization delay approving the mis
sile replacement project until 1991
or 1992.
By then, he said, a Soviet re
duction of conventional arms
could take place that would allow
negotiations on the short-range
missiles for eventual removal of
all nuclear weapons from Europe.
"Before we lock ourselves in on
this issue at the NATO confer
ence, we and the Americans need
to clear up our positions," Kohl
said.
In a statement issued after his
talks with Baker, Kohl said he
reaffirmed Bonn's willingness to
define general defense policies at
the next NATO summit, but he
did not make clear whether that
would include support for moder
nization.
U.S. officials who attended a
NATO defense strategy session
last month demanded that West
Germany fall in with the rest of
the alliance on the modernization
plan.
Baker's six-day, 15-nation tour
of alliance countries produced
some signs of reluctance among
other member states. The Danish
foreign minister told reporters in
Copenhagen that he expressed
support for the West German po
sition during his talks with Baker.
West Germany has shown itself
to be far more willing to take
advantage of Kremlin disarma
ment and cooperation initiatives
than the NATO bloc as a whole.
