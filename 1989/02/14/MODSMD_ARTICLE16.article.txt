PLO denies resorting to terrorism
TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) - The Palestine Liberation
Organization answered U.S. criticism by saying
yesterday it was not resorting to terrorism but
was resisting Israeli attacks.
The commentary, carried by the Palestinian
news agency WAFA, responded to remarks by
U.S. Secretary of State James Baker to reporters
over the weekend in Iceland.
The remarks appeared to be a warning that
attacks by Palestinian guerrillas against Israeli
civilians or soldiers, either inside or outside Israel,
could threaten the newly established U.S.-PLO
dialogue.
Israeli soldiers killed five PLO guerrillas during
a clash in south Lebanon on Feb. 4. Israel said
the guerrillas were trying to infiltrate and that
the PLO had not abandoned attacks on Israeli
targets. It urged the United States to break off
its dialogue with the PLO, which opened in Tunis
on Dec. 16 after chairman Yasser Arafat
renounced terrorism.
The WAFA commentary accused Baker of
trying to impose a double standard, "prohibiting
to the Palestinian people what it allowed the
Afghan resistance."
"The PLO is not resorting to terrorism, but
resistance," the commentary said. "It is Israel
that is practicing terrorism every day while the
Palestinian people are organizing legitimate resis
tance against the occupation, thus exercising a
right in conformance with international law and
convention."
The commentator told Baker not to try to get
the PLO to "abandon the resistance in order to
be able to continue the U.S.-PLO dialogue."
"We engaged in this dialogue with the aim of
finding a just solution to the Palestinian problem

and to realize the inalienable rights of this
people," the commentary said.
"The resistance and the uprising will stop only
when it has achieved its legitimate rights, includ
ing that of creating a Palestinian state with
Jerusalem as its capital."
Moslem students protest book
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) — Moslem students
marched in several cities yesterday against a book
fundamentalists say blasphemes Islam. Their
rallies occurred the day after police fired on
protesters in Islamabad, killing five and wound
ing 83.
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said the protest
Sunday may have been the work of politicians
using Moslem objections to Salman Rushdie's
novel "The Satanic Verses" as an excuse to press
their opposition to her government and democ
racy.
In India yesterday, police fired into a crowd
protesting the book in Srinagar, summer capital
of northern Jammu-Kashmir state, killing one
person and wounding more than 60, news reports
said.
United News of India said the mob forced
shops and businesses in Srinagar to close. India,
which is overwhelmingly Hindu, banned the book
in October.
In a letter soon after the banning, published
on front pages of Indian newspapers,
Rushdie said: "The right to freedom of expression
is at the very foundation of any democratic so
ciety.
Fundamentalists say the book does not recog
nize Islam as the one true religion and ridicules
the most precious Moslem beliefs. Rushdie
declares it to be a work of fiction, in no way
blasphemous and not intended to offend anyone.
