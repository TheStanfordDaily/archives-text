Skewed funding goals
could keep University
housing in Dark Ages

"Hey, who left his toothbrush next
to the Rodin in the sculpture gar
den?" "Don't blame me. I left
mine by the golden spike
downstairs."
Students could be
living in the Stanford
Museum, if the University
doesn't get its priorities right for
the Centennial Campaign.
Last week, the Faculty Senate
approved a shift in Centennial
Campaign fundraising priorities
and decided to raise $5 million
for the museum, a building that
would probably be big enough to
house the 1,000 or so students
whose Draw numbers don't make
the cutoff for on-campus housing.
In the same senate meeting
where the museum got a boost,
Campaign funding for under
graduate housing took a nose
dive, plumeting from $12 million
to zero.
Originally, the University was
not looking to raise any money
for the museum. But now Stan
ford has decided that the money
will be used to set up an endow
ment for the museum.
The decision to prioritize the
museum's budgetary need shows
that the University has a skewed
perspective on where the need is.

Student insight is obviously miss
ing during the decision-making
process.
Although the museum's cause
may be worthwhile, most stu
dents on this campus would opt
to have one less Manzanita trailer
than one more piece of Ren
naisance art.
Students themselves provide
the largest amount of funding for
this university, but they have
little to no voice in deciding how
that money is spent.
Provost James Rosse, the Uni
versity's second-in-command and
chief budget officer, said yester
day that there is "no direct stu
dent participation" in the
budgetary process.
Some students are members of
various University committees,
but this means that their only
involvement occurs before final
budget decisions are made. Later
in the process, ASSU representa
tives are allowed to sit in on sen
ate meetings, but this step takes
place after the budget or revision
is proposed — too late to have
any input or influence.
The input is needed in between
the current steps, a gap that could
be filled if the administration's
budget officials would consult
with student representatives in
setting the budget. Student rep
resentatives need to put more
pressure on the University to be
involved in the process.
Student input may be the only
way Manzanita Park may finally
be removed from campus and be
come a museum in its own right.
