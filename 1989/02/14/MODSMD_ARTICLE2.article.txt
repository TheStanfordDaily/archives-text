# Former Roble residents gain Draw priority
## 
### Lisa Lawrence Staff writer 
All students who underwent a change of residences
in December 1987 when Roble Hall was deemed
seismically unsafe can live there again when it
reopens this fall — even those students who took
advantage of a special returning residence priority
in last year's housing Draw.
Problems arose last Wednesday when letters were
mailed to last year's Roble Hall residents outlining
the implementation of the new "Roble Alumni Pri
ority" to go into effect as soon as Roble opens.
"According to the 'Roble Alumni Priority,' as long
as the student lists Roble as the first choice on
their Draw card, that student will be assigned to
Roble Hall," said Housing Director Roger Whitney.
Students who were freshmen living in Roble last
year can only choose a guaranteed year to use this
priority. However, if students are juniors this year
and have used all three years of their guaranteed
housing, they still qualify for the priority.
However, some upperclasamen were not initially
given the "Roble Alumni Priority." Last year, these
sophomores took advantage of a special returning
residence priority, in which the Housing Center al
lotted a certain percentage of guaranteed spaces in
other residences for the former Roble residents.
But yesterday, the Housing Center mailed out
new letters giving these students the "Roble Alumni
Priority" as well. Whitney would not clarify why
this change was made.
According to Doug Bunnell, a resident assistant
in Roble last year, the administration did the best
it could when Roble was suddenly closed. "I was
really impressed by what Stanford did for the res
idents in such a short period of time."
However, some students, especially freshmen,
were not quite satisfied and suggested that the
University provide them with a fourth year of
guaranteed housing,
Eleni Kirkas, a freshman in Roble last year who
was moved along with nine others into the two
bedroom guest suite above the Wilbur Hall office,
said the whole incident was an "unavoidable crisis."
But, she added, "[Last year's frosh] deserve four
guaranteed years. The alumni priority does not make
up entirely for isolating new students in poor living
conditions."
