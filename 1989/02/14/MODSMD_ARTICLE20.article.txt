## Respect, don't objectify 
### 
Men themselves have wondered/ What
they see in me./ They try so much/ But
they can't touch/ My inner mystery.l When
I try to show them/ They say they still
can't see./
— Maya Angelou, "Phenomenal Women"
I HAVE OFTEN wondered what
people see when they look at me. Do
they see me as I am or do they have
some preconceived notion as to how I
should be and does this become a self
fulfilling prophecy?
Does the world's perception of who am
I matter more than the perception I have,
of myself? Ideally, I would answer "no"
to that question, but realistically, since
I am a woman, I must answer "yes."
The way the world perceives me deter
mines the quality of the life I wilJ lead.
If I am thought to be smart, I will be
given the opportunity to use my intelli
gence and abilities; it will be expected of
me. However, if I am thought to be good
looking and of somewhat minimal intel
ligence (two qualities which for some
reason seem to go hand-in-hand in this
society) I will have to fight 10 times
harder for everything I want and deserve.
This is not just my problem; it is the
problem of all women. We are stereotyped
as weak, inferior in intelligence to men,
but useful when it comes to satisfying
the sexual appetite of the male gender.
Yes, even in our progressive society
today, women are still thought of as
sexual objects. When they show "the"
professional woman on television, she is
always beautiful, sensual and sexy. She
does not give the image of being respected

because she is good at her job and has
earned the respect of her colleagues, but
because she is great looking with a nice
pair of legs and a "bodacious set of ta
tas."
I don't care what Virginia Slims says,
we have not "come a long way." There
have been many advances due to the
women's movement, but attitudes really
have not changed as much as we fool
ourselves into believing.
When I walk down the street and I
hear "Hey, baby! What's your name?" I
can assure you this man does not want
to know my IQ.
When I go dancing (or to the grocery
store, for that matter) and some crude,
rude and lewd man decides he would like
to pinch or pat n;e on the butt, it's not
because there is a piece of lint on my
pants and he is trying to be polite by
removing it.
When I go to a frat party and after
having been there all of five seconds I
am stared up and down, inside and out
(you get my drift) I don't think it is
because these people think I am fas
hionably dressed and want to know where
I bought my outfit.
I should be flattered, right? In this
roundabout way they are telling me that
I am attractive, right? It is a compliment,
right? WRONG! These things are not
compliments, but insults. These men
don't care about who I am or what I
have to offer society, they care about
what I can offer them.
The fundamental issue is respect. If
these people respected me they would
not do that (or so I naively believed).

The thing that blew a hole in that theory
was when one of my own friends pinched
me on the butt and didn't think that I
should be offended. If you can't trust
your friends, who can you trust?
It is obvious that this type of respect
and understanding is not prevalent in
our society or on thf» Stanford campus.
If men respected women, there would be
no question about the sexist nature of
some party fliers that have been seen
around the campus.
If this ideal of respect existed here,
there would be no such fliers, regardless
of First Amendment protection; people
simply would not make them. Sexism
sells everything from Playboy to Sports
Illustrated to campus parties, but that
does not mean it is morally right. Slavery
was very profitable also, but that did not
make it justifiable.
Not only do men need to respect wom
en, but we as women need to respect
ourselves enough to be able to speak out
against these things that oppress us. This
is not always an easy thing to do — going
against the mainstream and the norms
of society never is — but if we want to
see a change we have to do it.
