Free speech argument conveniently avoids the issue

WHEN UNIVERSITY President
Donald Kennedy published his
"Reflections on Racial Under
standing" in the Jan. 11 Daily, more
than one reader was taken aback to
learn that he saw the Ujamaa case as
a free speech issue.
As Emeritus Prof, of Anthropology
and Sociology Saint Clair Drake wrote
subsequently in a Jan. 25 letter, the
scrawling of the word "niggers" over a
dance announcement "was a hostile,
aggressive act expressing hatred and
contempt." It constituted, in Drake's
words, "harassment, not 'protected
speech.' "
Since then, I have looked in vain for
a reply from Kennedy to Drake's letter.
Now, in a costly two-page Daily insert
(and I applaud The Daily for pointing

out editorially that not everyone can
afford to buy that much space), we
learn that two of the administration's
top legal officers share the president's
concern.
I shall not argue here the dubious
merits of their contestable review of
the University's past decisions on
controversial cases, save to say that in
my 30 years at Stanford, the adminis
tration has hardly been distinguished
by its zeal for revealing the truth or
the protection of freedom of speech
over an extraordinarily wide range of
issues, including weapons research,
secret payment of dues to the racist
and sexist Bohemian Club and health
and safety policies on campus.
Whistle blowers and critics perceived
as threatening the institution's finan

cial interests have been treated far less
gently than those who call black people
"niggers."
But, although the history of the
Stanford administration's commitment
to truth and freedom of speech is an
eminently valid subject for discussion,
it is not the central issue in this case,
which is racism and the question of
how the University's leadership
proposes to deal with it.
I find it appalling that University
general counsels Iris Brest and John
Schwartz consider ugly and primitive
racial insults, scrawled anonymously at
night, a kind of "expression of views"
to be cherished and protected if we are
to "preserve the University as a forum
for the competition of ideas."
The defense of such a conception of

a "forum" is grotesque, all the more so
in view of Kennedy's repeated refusal
to participate in true open public
forums on urgent issues of University
policy.
Each day, the media brings us fresh
evidence of a massive resurgence of
racist actions all over the country.
Those who have accepted leadership in
our institutions, from the White House
down to the lowest level, have the
responsibility of denouncing racism
unequivocally as a cruel and violent
assault on human dignity. The produc
tion of wordy discourses on freedom of
speech in this context amounts to an
evasion if not outright betrayal of that
responsibility.
