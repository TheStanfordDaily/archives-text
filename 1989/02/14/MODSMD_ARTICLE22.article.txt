# Res Ed must fight a plague of eating disorders on campus
## 
### 
As a graduate of the class of 1987 I
am still disturbed by what I felt was a
distinct lack of action among Residen
tial Education officials concerning the
large number of female undergraduates
who suffer from eating disorders. In
Joan Brumberg's book "Fasting Girls,"
she estimates that up to 20 percent of
college women suffer from some sort of
disorder.
I knew of at least half a dozen
anorexic students when I was at Stan
ford, and one of my friends had
anorexia and bulimia for three of her
Stanford years. Yet I felt that little, if
any, programs were offered to help
these people.
If education and discussion about

eating disorders could take place in the
dorms perhaps several women would
not end up victims of a disorder. Pre
vention of the disorders should be
given as much attention as recognition
of its symptoms.
I think Res Ed has a duty not only
to help educate the student body, but
also to include eating disorders in its
training for resident assistants. For two
years, neither of my friends' RAs said
anything to them.
I am sure many students know of
someone with an eating disorder. The
burden and guilt associated with being
a close friend of such a person is
heavy.
I hope that Stanford and in particu
lar Res Ed has evaluated its programs
dealing with women suffering from
eating disorders in the last two years.
It is time to talk about it publicly and
to educate people before it happens to
them.
