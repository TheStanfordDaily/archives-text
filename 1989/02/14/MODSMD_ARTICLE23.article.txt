# Don't forget that Otero incident was about homophobia
## 
### 
Contrary to the commonly held
belief, the "Otero incident" was not a
racial incident, if one looks at it not as
an isolated event, but as a series of
increasingly uncontrollable events which
culminated in an act tinged with racist
overtones.
This is not to say that Otero House
had been free of any racial tensions
until the so-called "Otero-seven vigil."
Hut the main dispute that gave rise to
this traumatic end had nothing to do
with race.
T he cause of Otero's problems was
the refusal or inability of a small num
ber of people to accept the presence of
a gay male resident assistant.
The highly esteemed and usually

effective method of persuasion and
attempts to help one individual person
ally reconcile his feelings towards the
homosexual community failed.
Presumably ignorant of the preceding
events in the house, the Phi Delta
Theta Fraternity members stood vigil
outside the entrance to Otero. Whether
they knew it or not, their effect was to
assert that the harassment of an indi
vidual on the basis of his or her sexual
orientation was unremarkable.
Unwittingly, we have all allowed this
attitude to be carried through, by
making little or no mention of the gay
RA as the initial object of degradation.
The currents of homophobia which
run through daily life can cause an
equal amount of anguish and tragedy
as the easily recognizable streams of
racial intolerance. Hate groups like the
Ku Klux Klan persecute blacks, wom
en, Jews, Catholics and homosexuals.
