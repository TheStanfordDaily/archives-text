## Why should students be more vulnerable to bigotry than faculty? 
### 
IS IT TRUE that residents of living
groups do not have rights that can
weigh against the right of self
expression? Why do some members of
the University community have rights
that can constrain the self-expression
of others while students do not?
Anyone serious about the issues
involved in this debate should study
not only the Office of the General
Counsel's statement from last week but
also University President Donald Ken
nedy's interrogative essay "Reflections
on Racial Understanding," which is
available at the President's Office.
As the general counsel's report ack
nowedges, Stanford is not bound by
the First Amendment. High schools
may constrain speech — in study halls
for example. Military academies may
regulate harshly the speech of cadets.
Monasteries may restrict speech entire
ty
By referring consistently to "First
Amendment principles," the counsel's
own statements tend to reinforce the
mistaken notion that the University's
adherence to free expression is com
pelled by the force of law.
Is free expression an institutional
(not Constitutional) right that is abso
lute? The general counsel's "yes" an
swer to the question is expressed in

libertarian terms, ruling out legislation
and preferring to trust discussion,
education and persuasion alone.
The Policy on Campus Disruption
provides a more authoritative "no" to
this question when it defines:
• the right of an administrator to
conduct University business
• the right of a scholar to engage in
research,
• the right of an instructor to teach
a class,
• the right of a public speaker to
give a lecture,
• the right a University official to
perform a public ceremony,
• and the right of a recruiter to
conduct a job interview.
Although it begins with an affirma
tion of the right of free expression, the
Policy on Campus Disruption was
created to assert the primacy of the
rights of people in each of these six
groups.
How can it be that, in their own
homes, students do not enjoy rights
that are at least as compelling as the
rights granted to the rest of us? And
how can it be that the "important
nuances" in the rights of residents
"defy codification," as the counsel
maintains, whereas the equally inevita
ble nuances in the other cases do not?

As the general coun
sel's report acknowl
edges, Stanford is not
bound by the First
Amendment. High
schools may constrain
speech — in study
halls for example.

One of the most useful instruments
of "discussion, education and persua
sion" is the law itself. When Kennedy
stood before the class of 1992 and said
"Bigotry is out," he provided the most
powerful education on the subject that
any incoming class has received in the
recent memory. He was stating Univer
sity policy. The last thing we needed
him to say was, "During the next four
years, we hope to be able to persuade
you that bigotry is a violation of
civility."

I might be asked: "How can all the
borderline cases ever be decided?"
Important moral or legal principles
inevitably contain gray areas. What
matters first and foremost in establish
ing an explicit right are the clear cases
in which people need the protection
afforded by an institutional statement
of principle.
"Do you advocate shutting down a
computer bulletin board when denigrat
ing language is being used?" If you are
offended by a film that is being shown
in Memorial Auditorium, you can avoid
it. In a similar way, the reader of a
computer bulletin board is free to log
off.
But whatever we say about -cases
like these, it should be clear that the
circumstances of a student in a resi
dence hall are fundamentally different.
He or she can't just "walk away" or
"log off."
"How does this principle apply to the
Ujamaa incident?" Under this principle
it seems clear to me that a decision
should have been reached quickly that
both the Housing Agreement and the
Fundamental Standard had been vio
lated.
"Does the right to be free of
denigrating language, which protects a t

black student, a gay or a woman, also
protect a student who is white, who is
not gay or who is male?"
I strongly support a distinction
between, on the one hand, those who
have been and still are the victims of
prejudice in our society and, on the
other hand, those like myself who, in
small or large ways, have benefited
from a system that has been based on
various forms of discrimination. This
institutional distinction is crucial.
With respect to the right to be free
of denigrating language in a residence
hall, however, I can see no significant
moral differences based on the gender,
ethnicity or sexual preference of the
students involved.
In the past months, many univer
sities have formulated strong policies
affirming the rights of students to be
free of harassment, intimidation or
verbal attacks on their dignity as
human beings. Some of these are
inspiring statements. It appears that
Stanford's policy will require a longer
time to be woven together. May it
therefore be less likely to unravel.

pelled by the force of law.
Is free expression an institutional
(not Constitutional) right that is abso
lute? The general counsel's "yes" an
swer to the question is expressed in

libertarian terms, ruling out legislation
and preferring to trust discussion,
education and persuasion alone.
The Policy on Campus Disruption
provides a more authoritative "no" to
this question when it defines:
• the right of an administrator to
conduct University business
• the right of a scholar to engage in
research,
• the right of an instructor to teach
a class,
• the right of a public speaker to
give a lecture,
• the right a University official to
perform a public ceremony,
• and the right of a recruiter to
conduct a job interview.
Although it begins with an affirma
tion of the right of free expression, the
Policy on Campus Disruption was
created to assert the primacy of the
rights of people in each of these six
groups.
How can it be that, in their own
homes, students do not enjoy rights
that are at least as compelling as the
rights granted to the rest of us? And
how can it be that the "important
nuances" in the rights of residents
"defy codification," as the counsel
maintains, whereas the equally inevita
ble nuances in the other cases do not?

As the general coun
sel's report acknowl
edges, Stanford is not
bound by the First
Amendment. High
schools may constrain
speech — in study
halls for example.

One of the most useful instruments
of "discussion, education and persua
sion" is the law itself. When Kennedy
stood before the class of 1992 and said
"Bigotry is out," he provided the most
powerful education on the subject that
any incoming class has received in the
recent memory. He was stating Univer
sity policy. The last thing we needed
him to say was, "During the next four
years, we hope to be able to persuade
you that bigotry is a violation of
civility."

I might be asked: "How can all the
borderline cases ever be decided?"
Important moral or legal principles
inevitably contain gray areas. What
matters first and foremost in establish
ing an explicit right are the clear cases
in which people need the protection
afforded by an institutional statement
of principle.
"Do you advocate shutting down a
computer bulletin board when denigrat
ing language is being used?" If you are
offended by a film that is being shown
in Memorial Auditorium, you can avoid
it. In a similar way, the reader of a
computer bulletin board is free to log
off.
But whatever we say about -cases
like these, it should be clear that the
circumstances of a student in a resi
dence hall are fundamentally different.
He or she can't just "walk away" or
"log off."
"How does this principle apply to the
Ujamaa incident?" Under this principle
it seems clear to me that a decision
should have been reached quickly that
both the Housing Agreement and the
Fundamental Standard had been vio
lated.
"Does the right to be free of
denigrating language, which protects a t

black student, a gay or a woman, also
protect a student who is white, who is
not gay or who is male?"
I strongly support a distinction
between, on the one hand, those who
have been and still are the victims of
prejudice in our society and, on the
other hand, those like myself who, in
small or large ways, have benefited
from a system that has been based on
various forms of discrimination. This
institutional distinction is crucial.
With respect to the right to be free
of denigrating language in a residence
hall, however, I can see no significant
moral differences based on the gender,
ethnicity or sexual preference of the
students involved.
In the past months, many univer
sities have formulated strong policies
affirming the rights of students to be
free of harassment, intimidation or
verbal attacks on their dignity as
human beings. Some of these are
inspiring statements. It appears that
Stanford's policy will require a longer
time to be woven together. May it
therefore be less likely to unravel.

IS IT TRUE that residents of living
groups do not have rights that can
weigh against the right of self
expression? Why do some members of
the University community have rights
that can constrain the self-expression
of others while students do not?
Anyone serious about the issues
involved in this debate should study
not only the Office of the General
Counsel's statement from last week but
also University President Donald Ken
nedy's interrogative essay "Reflections
on Racial Understanding," which is
available at the President's Office.
As the general counsel's report ack
nowedges, Stanford is not bound by
the First Amendment. High schools
may constrain speech — in study halls
for example. Military academies may
regulate harshly the speech of cadets.
Monasteries may restrict speech entire

By referring consistently to "First
Amendment principles," the counsel's
own statements tend to reinforce the
mistaken notion that the University's
adherence to free expression is com
pelled by the force of law.
