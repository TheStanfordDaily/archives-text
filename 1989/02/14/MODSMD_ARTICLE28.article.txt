For most people, vacation is a
chance to read those good novels
one always hears about but rarely
reads. But for a literature megor,
vacation is often the only time to
finally put fiction down and enjoy
the real world.
Such was my attitude last De
cember as I headed home to Con
necticut, my sanctuary from the
academic world. Nevertheless,
being the creature that I am, our
new cable television couldn't keep
yet another novel, "Crossing to
Safety," by Wallace Stegner, from
finding its way into my hands.
Wallace Stegner's books have al
ways been a part of my family's
library, but this was the first time
I had ever read his work. Steg
ner's novel shook me from the
dry, habitual turning of pages and
transplanted me, as if by the hand

of a gentle surgeon, into the lives
of others whose experiences have
subsequently remained in my own
memory, mingled with my own
experiences.
"Crossing to Safety," published
last year, appropriately marks the
15th anniversary of Stegner's
writing career. It is a story of two
couples who, upon meeting each
other, exult in a rare moment of
serendipity and revelation as they
recognize in each other life-long
friends, even before their own
lives have taken full shape.
The narrator and his wife,
Larry and Sally Morgan, are from
the West, without children, trying
to make it in academia in the
middle of the Depression. They
meet Sid and Charity Lang, the
epitome of good Eastern breeding
and wealth, at a party for the
University of Wisconsin's English
Department. The Morgans find
themselves embraced by the
Lang's personal warmth and
wealth, qualities that later bolster

'Crossing to
Safety' portrays
life's unending bat
tle between chaos,
'the law of nature,'
and order, 'the
dream of man.'

the Morgans as Larry pursues a
career as a writer and Sally con
tracts polio.
"Crossing to Safety" traces this
friendship's Edenic beginning and
its interludes during nearly 50
years of the couples' successes and
failures. Through the lives of the
Langs and Morgans, Stegner
portrays life's battle between
chaos and order, or, in Larry Mor
gan's terms, the fight between
"the law of nature" and the
"dream of man."
As Stegner states, there is noth
ing "Bloomsbury" about the four
some, assuring us that we need
not anticipate grqpt sexual or fi
nancial scandals so appealing to
our modern-day palate. Yet, as
Stegner writes, "No Eden [is]
valid without serpent."
The serpent of "Crossing to
Safety" is subtle but enthralling.
It takes the form of Charity Lang,
whose obsessive need to impose
happiness and order on others
challenges not only the friendship
of the two couples, but also, more
seriously, jeopardizes her relation
ship with her les« driven husband.
This overbearing need persists
even in the face of death: When
Charity contracts cancer, she
cruelly demands total composure
from husband and friends.
Charity's polar opposite is Lar
ry, the narrator, who is guided
more by the line of least resistance
than by agenda. In contrast to
Sid's weakness, there is wisdom
in Larry's passivity. Having al
ready faced blows to his life ex
pectations by the early deaths of
his parents and other tragic dis

appointments, Larry understands
how easily life's plans can dissolve.
Larry's passivity enables him
to make dramatic changes in his
long-range plans whenever life's
chaos makes it expedient. This
passivity, too, endows him with
the insight and imagination of an
artist.
The novel is about the meaning
and value of endurance that is
maintained by the bonds of friend
ship and marriage, structures we
impose in the face of nature's
chaos. Such bonds inspire us to
dream and motivate us to work
towards security and peace in
spite of, or even because of,
hardships.
When properly balanced with
the arbitrary flow of experience,
these bonds become the forces
which navigate us across life to
the safety of sanity.
Stegner avoids themes of
despair and alienation so present
in contemporary literature, but
that is not to say his novel is a
neat package of answerable ques
tions.
Larry himself articulates an al
most built-in criticism of the
novel: "(Writers) don't under
stand any more than other people.
They invent plots they can resolve.
They ask questions they can an
swer. Those aren't people that you
see in books, those are con
structs."
Larry's words emphasize the
complexity of reality, suggesting
that if an artist is to do justice
in representing reality, there will
be pieces that don't fit.
Paradoxically, Stegner so suc
cessfully allows for the chaos of
life to be a part of the imposed
order of his plot, that we come
away with the conviction that he
is indeed chronicling a real friend
ship. We are not quite sure of
where we slipped from the aware
ness that the Morgans and Langs
are fiction, not reality.
One need not have formal
literary training to understand
and be moved by "Crossing to
Safety." Stegner's novel does not
demand that the reader strain
over every symbol, over every
theme. It asks only for our ability
to feel and experience what is an

other's experience.
Indeed, only in putting aside
our interpretive armor does the
novel yield its most powerful
themes and symbols.
I have often wondered if all the
literary constructs we learn — the
"isms" of structuralism, magic
realism, modernism and the rest
— have exhausted and
habitualized our responses to
books we read, rendering us hy
perconscious and incapable of em
pathy for real human problems.
"Crossing to Safety"

reawakened my emotional re
sponses and challenged my
trained and oversimplified expec
tations that a great novel must,
of necessity, undermine whatever
joy and security we derive from
life. For once, a modern novelist
has affirmed that "Man, even
Modern man, has some dignity if
he will assume it and that most
lives are living even when they
are lives of quiet desperation." *
