## Search for successor continues 
### Rob Burwell Staff writer 
The search for W. Glenn
Campbell's successor as di
rector of the Hoover Insti
tution for War, Revolution
and Peace is now in full
swing and Stanford hopes to
choose a replacement before
Aug. 31, the day Campbell
has agreed to relinqish his
30-year term and become a
counselor for the institu
tion, according to University
President Donald Kennedy.
Kennedy added that he
was pleased with how the
search was going and that
Campbell would step down
on that date whether a suc
cessor has been chosen or
not.
Hoover Senior Fellow
Ramon Myers, a member of
the committee which is
looking to replace Campbell,
said the "search committee
is meeting and doing its job.
It will have a successor in
a matter of time."
Myers said he could not
comment further, adding
that members of the com
mittee "took oaths not to say
anything about the nature
of the search committee."
University Provost James
Rosse, another committee
member, did say, however,
that the committee is cur
rently considering a number
of good candidates.
Explaining the reason for
the committee's secrecy in
conducting its search, Rosse
said, "You can't run a search
for a position as prominent
and important as this one
out in the open. It must be
treated in a confidential
manner."
Rosse would not confirm or
deny Campbell's statement that
the search for his successor was
down to "30 or 40 candidates."
Rosse said only that he wondered
where Campbell got his informa
tion, adding that Campbell had
no affiliation with the search com
mittee.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz,
an outspoken critic of Hoover's
ties to the University, expressed
concern that the end to
Cambpell's reign will mean "in
substantive terms . . . nothing
whatsoever."
"The person who replaces him
will be his political clone, only
smoother in public relations. He
will continue to pursue the same
missions for Hoover."
The new director will be chosen
in accordance with a Jan. 12, 1971
resolution providing that the Uni
versity president choose from
among the final nominees of the
search committee and submit his
choice to the Institution's Board
of Overseers and the Board of
Directors of the Herbert Hoover
Foundation for approval.
After this selection process, the
nomination is submitted to the
Stanford Board of Trustees for
final approval. Nominations to
the Hoover Board of Overseers
are approved by three University
trustees.
The search committee was cho
sen in 1985 in compliance with
the 1971 resolution and includes
seven representatives of Hoover
and three University representa
tives appointed by Kennedy.
