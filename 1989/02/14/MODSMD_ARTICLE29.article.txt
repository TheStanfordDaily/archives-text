## Search for successor continues 
### Rob Burwell Staff writer 
The search for W. Glenn
Campbell's successor as di
rector of the Hoover Insti
tution for War, Revolution
and Peace is now in full
swing and Stanford hopes to
choose a replacement before
Aug. 31, the day Campbell
has agreed to relinqish his
30-year term and become a
counselor for the institu
tion, according to University
President Donald Kennedy.
Kennedy added that he
was pleased with how the
search was going and that
Campbell would step down
on that date whether a suc
cessor has been chosen or
not.
Hoover Senior Fellow
Ramon Myers, a member of
the committee which is
looking to replace Campbell,
said the "search committee
is meeting and doing its job.
It will have a successor in
a matter of time."
Myers said he could not
comment further, adding
that members of the com
mittee "took oaths not to say
anything about the nature
of the search committee."
University Provost James
Rosse, another committee
member, did say, however,
that the committee is cur
rently considering a number
of good candidates.
Explaining the reason for
the committee's secrecy in
conducting its search, Rosse
said, "You can't run a search
for a position as prominent
and important as this one
out in the open. It must be
treated in a confidential
manner."
