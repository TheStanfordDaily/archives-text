### Bruce Sarkisian Senior staff writer 
In a season where the Cardinal baseball team
will face many top-20 opponents, wins over teams
like unranked Cal State-Los Angeles are supposed
to come easy.

Baseball
Cardinal 7, Golden Eagles 6

This one didn't.
Stanford went into the bottom of the ninth inning
trailing 6-4. It took a heroic three-run homer by
shortstop Troy Paulsen to earn the victory which
moved Stanford to 6-5 on the season. But the taste
in Stanford Coach Mark Marquess' mouth after the
game was not sweet.
"I don't think we're playing real well offensively
or defensively. This isn't an isolated case of bad
play," he said.
"We had to come from behind today," Paulsen
added. "It's hard to have to do that all the time
but we came out real sluggish."
Stanford starter Rob Kamerschen sailed along
smoothly through the first and second inning, but
he opened the third by hitting Eagle shortstop Brent
Bish. After he was sacrificed over to second, second
baseman Ed Pimental crushed a line-drive home
run over the left field fence.
Aaron Dorlarque came out to pitch the fourth
for Stanford, but did not fare much better than his
teammate. After retiring the first batter, Eagle des
ignated hitter Dave Adams launched a solo homer
off the scoreboard in left-center field. Dorlarque
gave up another run on a singles by David Johnston
and Frank James.
After being held scoreless and mustering only
three hits through four innings, the Cardinal bats
broke loose. Frank Carey led off with a walk and
Roger Burnett got him to second with a single.
Then Paulsen, in his first display of RBI prowess,
scored Carey with a single of his own. Paul Carey
joined the action with an RBI single, as did David
Holbrook.
Freshman Steve Solomon, who had yet to get a
hit in 17 at bats, then launched a long fly to right
to score Holbrook and put him at second to cap the
inning's scoring with four runs.
As if settling in for a second afternoon nap, the
Stanford bats remained quiet until the ninth inning.
Luckily, the Cardinal had the services of reliever
Scott Weiss on the mound, who assumed a baserun
ner with nobody out in the seventh and retired
three striaght batters.
The sophomore had another strong relief outing,
though as he's done twice before, he served up a
gopher ball. Fortunately for Stanford, it was the
only mistake he made in three innings of work to

keep the Eagles within reach.
"Weiss has gotten some big
outs," Marquess said, adding that
he would like to keep him in the
bullpen for the time being.
Once again Frank Carey was
the catalyst of the inning, leading
off with a single. Burnett walked
to bring the winning run to the
plate in the person of Paulsen.
On the first pitch, Paulsen
squared to bunt but took strike
one. Marquess then took the bunt
sign off and the next pitch was
history.
"I was looking fastball all the
way, and I didn't want it to get
away," Paulsen commented.
It got away all right — all the
way out of the ballpark.
Card notes
In addition to Solomon's first hit
of the season, sophomore Brad Brown
made his first appearance on the
mound, giving up one hit in one in
ning of work.
Holbrook is making quite a case for
himself at first base. In addition to
going 2-for-3, he made a diving stab
of a hot grounder to save a run in
the seventh.
The Eagles were the victims of some
bonehead plays in the outfield, in
cluding one where left fielder Greg
Reid circled around a fly ball so many
times he got dizzy and missed the
play. And on more than one occasion

After the game, both Paulsen and

to Paulsen.
In a season where the Cardinal baseball team
will face many top-20 opponents, wins over teams

Cardinal 7, Golden Eagles 6

This one didn't.
Stanford went into the bottom of the ninth inning
trailing 6-4. It took a heroic three-run homer by
shortstop Troy Paulsen to earn the victory which
moved Stanford to 6-5 on the season. But the taste
in Stanford Coach Mark Marquess' mouth after the
game was not sweet.
"I don't think we're playing real well offensively
or defensively. This isn't an isolated case of bad
play," he said.
"We had to come from behind today," Paulsen
added. "It's hard to have to do that all the time
but we came out real sluggish."
Stanford starter Rob Kamerschen sailed along
smoothly through the first and second inning, but
he opened the third by hitting Eagle shortstop Brent
Bish. After he was sacrificed over to second, second
baseman Ed Pimental crushed a line-drive home
run over the left field fence.
Aaron Dorlarque came out to pitch the fourth
for Stanford, but did not fare much better than his
teammate. After retiring the first batter, Eagle des
ignated hitter Dave Adams launched a solo homer
off the scoreboard in left-center field. Dorlarque
gave up another run on a singles by David Johnston
and Frank James.
After being held scoreless and mustering only
three hits through four innings, the Cardinal bats
broke loose. Frank Carey led off with a walk and
Roger Burnett got him to second with a single.
Then Paulsen, in his first display of RBI prowess,
scored Carey with a single of his own. Paul Carey
joined the action with an RBI single, as did David
Holbrook.
Freshman Steve Solomon, who had yet to get a
hit in 17 at bats, then launched a long fly to right
to score Holbrook and put him at second to cap the
inning's scoring with four runs.
As if settling in for a second afternoon nap, the
Stanford bats remained quiet until the ninth inning.
Luckily, the Cardinal had the services of reliever
Scott Weiss on the mound, who assumed a baserun
ner with nobody out in the seventh and retired
three striaght batters.
The sophomore had another strong relief outing,
though as he's done twice before, he served up a
gopher ball. Fortunately for Stanford, it was the
only mistake he made in three innings of work to

keep the Eagles within reach.
"Weiss has gotten some big
outs," Marquess said, adding that
he would like to keep him in the
bullpen for the time being.
Once again Frank Carey was
the catalyst of the inning, leading
off with a single. Burnett walked
to bring the winning run to the
plate in the person of Paulsen.
On the first pitch, Paulsen
squared to bunt but took strike
one. Marquess then took the bunt
sign off and the next pitch was
history.
"I was looking fastball all the
way, and I didn't want it to get
away," Paulsen commented.
It got away all right — all the
way out of the ballpark.
Card notes
In addition to Solomon's first hit
of the season, sophomore Brad Brown
made his first appearance on the
mound, giving up one hit in one in
ning of work.
Holbrook is making quite a case for
himself at first base. In addition to
going 2-for-3, he made a diving stab
of a hot grounder to save a run in
the seventh.
The Eagles were the victims of some
bonehead plays in the outfield, in
cluding one where left fielder Greg
Reid circled around a fly ball so many
times he got dizzy and missed the
play. And on more than one occasion
