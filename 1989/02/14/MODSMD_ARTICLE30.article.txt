In a season where the Cardinal baseball team
will face many top-20 opponents, wins over teams
like unranked Cal State-Los Angeles are supposed
to come easy.

Cardinal 7, Golden Eagles 6

This one didn't.
Stanford went into the bottom of the ninth inning
trailing 6-4. It took a heroic three-run homer by
shortstop Troy Paulsen to earn the victory which
moved Stanford to 6-5 on the season. But the taste
in Stanford Coach Mark Marquess' mouth after the
game was not sweet.
"I don't think we're playing real well offensively
or defensively. This isn't an isolated case of bad
play," he said.
"We had to come from behind today," Paulsen
added. "It's hard to have to do that all the time
but we came out real sluggish."
Stanford starter Rob Kamerschen sailed along
smoothly through the first and second inning, but
he opened the third by hitting Eagle shortstop Brent
Bish. After he was sacrificed over to second, second
baseman Ed Pimental crushed a line-drive home
run over the left field fence.
Aaron Dorlarque came out to pitch the fourth
for Stanford, but did not fare much better than his
teammate. After retiring the first batter, Eagle des
ignated hitter Dave Adams launched a solo homer
off the scoreboard in left-center field. Dorlarque
gave up another run on a singles by David Johnston
and Frank James.
After being held scoreless and mustering only
three hits through four innings, the Cardinal bats
broke loose. Frank Carey led off with a walk and
Roger Burnett got him to second with a single.
Then Paulsen, in his first display of RBI prowess,
scored Carey with a single of his own. Paul Carey
joined the action with an RBI single, as did David
Holbrook.
Freshman Steve Solomon, who had yet to get a
hit in 17 at bats, then launched a long fly to right
to score Holbrook and put him at second to cap the
inning's scoring with four runs.
As if settling in for a second afternoon nap, the
Stanford bats remained quiet until the ninth inning.
Luckily, the Cardinal had the services of reliever
Scott Weiss on the mound, who assumed a baserun
ner with nobody out in the seventh and retired
three striaght batters.
The sophomore had another strong relief outing,
though as he's done twice before, he served up a
gopher ball. Fortunately for Stanford, it was the
only mistake he made in three innings of work to
