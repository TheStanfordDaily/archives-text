# Stanford's Paulsen is late-inning hero again

Bottom of the ninth, men on first and
second, nobody out.
Shortstop Troy Paulsen steps to the plate
with the Cardinal trailing Cal-State Los
Angeles by two.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess calls for
the Cardinal's number-three hitter to lay
down a sacrifice bunt.
"Were you just a little bit disappointed,
Troy?
"At first I was surprised. Every hitter
would want to hit in that situation," Paul

sen said.
Paulsen takes the first pitch, thinking
it was outside. The plate umpire calls strike
one.
"I initially wanted to bunt [the runners]
over," Marquess said. "Then [the pitcher]
got ahead 0-1 and I thought maybe he'd
lay in a fastball."
Marquess decides to let Paulsen swing
away. L.A. reliever Abdom Pinon grooves
a fastball and Paulsen deposits it over the
wall in deep left-center. Stanford wins 7-6.
"I was glad he took the bunt off," Paulsen
said, smiling from ear to ear. "Es
pecially now."
"I was looking fastball all the
way and he threw it right down
Broadway," he added.
As it would be for any bal
lplayer, Paulsen lived out a child
hood dream yesterday.
"It's an unbelievable feeling.
You'd get that same feeling in a
wiffle ball game," he said.
For Paulsen, it was the second
storybook homer of 1989. On Feb.

5, the Cardinal trailed Loyola
Marymount 5-4 in the sixth. With
two men on, Paulsen drilled the
game-winning blast in a 9-6 Car
dinal victory.
"Today's was really the same
pitch as I got against Loyola. In
that situation I just try not to
get too crazy and pull the ball too
much," Paulsen said.
"Other than those two hits
today, I haven't been hitting that
great. I've just gotten a couple
key hits at key times," he said.
"He's not hitting the ball well,
to be honest," Marquess added.
"He's going to get a lot better.
He's not really in a groove yet."

If only everyone's slumps could
be as productive as Paulsen's.
Paulsen attributes some of his
troubles at the plate to adjusting
to his new role in the Stanford
lineup. With the departure of big
RBI-men Ed Sprague, Ron Wit
meyer and Doug Robbins, Paulsen
is now desperately needed to drive
in runs. "I was actually putting
pressure on myself during the fall
season and trying to hit for
power," he said. "Lately, I've been
trying to just hit it back up the
middle. I'm not a power hitter by
any means."
The pop in his bat happens to
come out at just the right time.
