# Fresh talent should promote women spikers to glory
## 
### 
One day in the very-near future,
the Stanford women's volleyball
team will be bringing home the
golden trophy that has eluded the team
for seven years. That day will occur this
December, the day when Stanford defeats
its challenger in the championship match
of the Final Four to claim its first NCAA
title.
After one fourth-place finish, two
thirds and three seconds over the course
of NCAA women's volleyball's eight-year
existence, the Cardinal will finally come
out on top. With the finest recruiting
class in the nation Farm-bound, Stanford
has the talent to dominate all opponents.
That's a mighty tall order, considering
the Cardinal's fate in 1988. After con
cluding the regular season ranked second

in the nation, Stanford was dramatically
upset in a five-game thriller at the West
Regional, held in Los Angeles during win
ter break.
Washington, a squad the Cardinal han
dled readily during both Pacific 10 Con

ference meetings, capitalized on inconsis
tent Stanford passing to move into the
regional final with then-No. 1 UCLA.
The dramatic rematch of No. 1 versus
No. 2 never materialized, and for the
first time since the inception of the NCAA
Tournament, Stanford was not among
the four squads playing for the NCAA
title.
Despite the upset, however, this past
season will be remembered as per
haps the best building year in
NCAA history. Starting two freshmen —
first team Ail-American outside hitter
Kristin Klein and All-Pac-10 middle
blocker Amy Cooper — in key positions,
the Cardinal combined learning and win
ning to net a respectable finish.

Now, with four blue-chip players en
tering a more seasoned program, Stan
ford has a direct shot at the top spot in
the nation. The team is deeper at every
position and has more than compensated
for its shortcomings.
The biggest problem, as evidenced in
the Husky upset, was passing. The in
consistent ball handling that plagued the
Cardinal all season proved especially
devastating in the postseason crunch:
While Stanford clearly enjoyed more of
fensive options than Washington, the
shaky passing exhibited in the match
prevented setter Lara Asper from explor
ing the more deadly ones.
Enter Kristi Paaso and Laurie Sawin,
two players identified early by Stanford
Coach Don Shaw for their passing

prowess. When Stanford's ball control
degenerates into ball mishandling, Shaw
has a pair of steady passers waiting in
the wings.
Even more valuable, however, is the
presense of Bev Oden and Carrie
Feldman. Two key players in high
school, the duo could be even better in
college.
First Feldman: a 5-10 setter from
Davis, she will be a welcome addition to
the Stanford setting corps of Asper and
Karen Anderson.
When Asper injured her ankle, the lack
of a third setter put Stanford in a vul
nerable position. No longer — with


EVAN TUCHINSKY
Feldman, Shaw has three differ
ent but solid setters at his dis
posal.
The competition between An
derson and Feldman should be
fierce, pitting experience against
acclaim; the Cardinal wins either
way.
The real recruiting coup d'etat,
however, is the acquisition of
Oden. The younger sister of two
Division I Players of the Year
(Kim and Elaina), Bev has the
potential to be even greater.
Better than U.S. Olympic Team
captain Kim immortalized with
trashcan lids and innertubes at
matches in salute of "The Big O"?
Yes, "Little O" could be that good,
much to the chagrin of Stanford's
opponents. One must see her play
to believe.
Nonchalantly, without much
noise or media splash, the
Cardinal has moved to
within striking distance of its first
national championship. Coupled
with Pac-10 champion UCLA's
loss of All-America setter Ann
Boyer and NCAA champion
Texas' loss of Volleyball Monthly
Player of the Year Dawn Daven
port, Stanford's recruiting
bonanza puts the Cardinal a leg
up on all the opposition.
Eight will indeed be a lucky
number.
