# Card spikers upset 3rd-ranked UCSB

### John Kirks Staff writer 
Slowly, ever so slowly, heads are
beginning to turn toward Stan
ford.
Yesterday afternoon, the Stan
ford men's volleyball team ran off
its fourth consecutive victory, as
No. 4 ranked UCSB fell to the
increasingly mighty Cardinal in
five games.

Men's Volleyball
Cardinal 3, Gauchos 2

After the match, whispers about
this Cardinal team began to circ
ulate throughout the Western In
tercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion. How good can this upstart
team be?
If the game in Santa Barbara
is any indication, Stanford just
might be the team to watch this
year. The Cardinal devoured every
bit of adversity that it was con
fronted with against the Gauchos:
an early deficit, a heartbreaking
loss in game three, a strong
Gaucho rally in game four, plus
UCSB's formidable homecourt ad
vantage. Stanford simply was not
to be denied.
For this match, the label of hero
would probably have to go to
Stanford's Dan Hanan. The junior
hitter had a whopping 36 kills on
his way to a (once again) stellar
.421 hitting percentage.
Of course, Scott Fortune was
not far behind. In fact, the Car
dinal Olympian tossed in 37 kills
of his own, hitting .343. In addi

tion, freshman Duncan Blackman
materialized as an offensive force
to be reckoned with, putting down
16 kills.
Defensively, the Cardinal did a
number on UCSB as well. Stan
ford's intimidating front line and
its scrapping diggers combined to
effectively neutralize the Gaucho
hitters: Jose Gandara and Eric
Fonoimoana. Gandara hit only
.250 while Fonoimoana compiled
a feeble .140 hitting percentage.
The two teams went into game
three deadlocked at one game
apiece, and, after a heated duel
in game three, Stanford appeared
to have it locked up. Stanford led
13-11 and was serving.
Off the serve, Santa Barbara
passed the ball over the net, and
Dan Hanan put the stray ball
down for an apparent point. How
ever, the referee erased the point
with an in-the-net call on Hanan,
and UCSB went on to steal the
game 16-14.
Stanford, deep in a hole for the
third time in four matches, once
again was able to regroup in
miraculous fashion. The squad
got off to a quick start, held off
a late Gaucho rally, and won game
four by a score of 15-9. Game
five, unlike the previous four, was
no contest as the Cardinal wave
swept over the stunned Gauchos.
The final tally in the decisive
game was 15-4.
Asst. Coach Ruben Nieves cited
strong bench play as possibly the
most improved aspect of this
young team. "Chris Wrede and
Doug Walquist were very big fac
tors coming off the bench
tonight," he explained.

power by edging UC-Santa Barbara last night.
