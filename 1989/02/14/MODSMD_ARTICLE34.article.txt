# Sailing gets slow start, catches gust late at UCSC

In a strange bit of
synchronicity with nature, the
Stanford sailing team got off
to a slow start in the light
winds of Saturday's racing, but
came back when the breeze
filled in on Sunday to take
third and then first at the first
two regattas of the North Se
ries, held this weekend in Santa
Cruz.
For the Cardinal sailors, the
North Series amounts to the
regular season. Results from
the Series' eight regattas,
spread over four weekends, will
determine who is eligible to
compete in the Pacific Coast
Championship later in the
season.
In the opening event, Stan
ford's sailors apparently found
it difficult to stay ahead of the
competition in the light breeze
and choppy seas of Monterey
Bay
When the windless regatta
was called after only three
races, the Cardinal varsity
boat, sailed by seniors Ev Rend
and Amy Baltzer and juniors
Robert Brown and Heidi Park,
found itself behind California
and Santa Cruz in the overall
standings.
In the junior varsity fleet,
however, which sailed sepa
rately on Saturday, the Stan
ford team dominated, with the

foursome of sophomore Dave
Dowd, freshman Lydia Snape,
sophomore Scott Dale and
junior Sue Kown winning the
day.
Returning to Santa Cruz on
Sunday for the second regatta
of the Series, the Cardinal
found more breeze and better
finishes. With the varsity and
JV fleets combined, the racing
involved more than 20 boats
from 11 schools, including long
traveling Washington and
UCLA.
As the breeze built to nearly
20 knots, Stanford dominated
the racing, with sophomores
Rick Rosen and Rebecca
Bryson sailing into first place
in A Division, just ahead of
teammates Brown and Park.
In B-Division, Dowd and Snape
tied with Rend and Baltzer for
first, with both just edging out
freshman sensation Peter
Somers and sophomore Paula
Gani.
Twenty four points back in
the overall results came Cal,
which barely managed to beat
the hometown favorites from
Santa Cruz. After the two
regattas, however, Cal leads the
series with three points, fol
lowed by Stanford with four
and Santa Cruz with five.
The Cardinal will see its next
North Series action in two
weeks, when it hosts the third
and fourth events in Redwood
City.
