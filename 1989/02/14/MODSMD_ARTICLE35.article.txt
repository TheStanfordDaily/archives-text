# Cardinal should ace Spartans
## San Jose State simply outclassed by Stanford netters 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
The 1988 San Jose State men's tennis
team had one legitimate star — junior
Malcolm Allen — and not much else.
When the Stanford men's tennis team
traveled to San Jose last February to
take on the Spartans, Allen won his
match at No. 1 singles 5-7, 6-3, 6-3 over
the Cardinal's Jeff Tarango, but got
little help from his teammates as Stan
ford posted a relatively easy 5-2 win.
Several weeks later at Stanford, even
Allen had trouble, losing to Tarango as
the Spartans were smashed 8-1.
This year, the Spartans don't even
have Allen, who chose to forego his final
year of eligibility to play on the profes
sional tour. Translation: Don't expect
the Cardinal to have much trouble today
when they take on the Spartans in San
Jose at 1:30 p.m.
"This is definitely a rebuilding year,"
San Jose Coach John Hubbell said.
"Losing Allen hurt us a lot."
The Spartans are far from inexperi
enced — they will start four seniors in
today's match — but, according to Hub
bell, their depth leaves a little some
thing to be desired.
"We really didn't have much depth
fbefore Allen decided to turn pro]," Hub

bell said, "and with him gone, everyone
just moved up a notch. We also thought
we had a couple of [new] players coming
in who decided to go somewhere else.
"I do know one thing, though," Hub
bell continued. "I sure am going to miss
those Tarango-Allen matches."
Tarango and Allen together put on
quite a show each time they squared
off — they split their two matches in
each of the last two years — but
Tarango will probably not have much
trouble this year with Roberto DiGuilio,
the Spartans' No. 1 man.
Of course, Tarango is just back from
the Rolex National Intercollegiate
Championships (where he advanced to
the quarterfinals before being elimi
nated) and may be tired from his week
end on the road.
Stanford Coach Dick Gould will be
giving Tarango a break from doubles
play, with junior Eric Peus getting the
nod at No. 1 doubles with sophomore
Martin Blackman. The rest of Stan
ford's lineup remains unchanged from
last week's season-opening win over Ir
vine.
While the match looks to have all the
makings of a blowout, Stanford Asst.
Coach John Whitlinger isn't taking any

thing for granted.
"It's true they were hurt when Allen
went pro," Whitlinger said, "but they
still have some talent. They're probably
not as talented as they have been in
the past, but then every time you say
something like that [about your op
ponents] it seems they come out and
play the match of their lives."
Hubbell, too, feels his players may be
extra-motivated. "It's a real privilege to
play Stanford," he said, "especially be
cause they're the defending national
champs. I don't think I have to worry
about getting guys up for this match."
