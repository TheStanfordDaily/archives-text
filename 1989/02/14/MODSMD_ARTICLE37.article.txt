NORMAN, Okla. (AP) - Okla
homa Coach Billy Tubbs is happy
to be No. 1 in the nation â€” again.
"We'd like to stay there," Tubbs
said yesterday after learning his
Sooners had taken over the top
spot in The Associated Press col
lege basketball poll again. "But
we're not going to get into the
hype of the thing. We've experi
enced it before, so now maybe we
can do better."
Oklahoma was ranked No. 1
two weeks ago for the first time
in the school's history. But the
Sooners lost to intrastate rival
Oklahoma State and fell to fifth
in last week's poll.
Oklahoma moved back to No.
1 this week after defeating No. 3
Missouri and Arizona, last week's
No. 1 team.
Tubbs noted after Sunday's 82-
80 victory over Arizona that the
No. 1 team has had to immedi
ately go out and play tough road
games. The Sooners are no dif
ferent.
"This week we've got Kansas
and Colorado on the road," Tubbs

said. "I think there should be
some kind of clause that if you
get to be No. 1, you can change
your schedule so you don't have
to play on the road for at least
two weeks," he joked.
Oklahoma, 21-3, received 58
first-place votes and 1,273 points
from the nationwide panel of
sportswriters and broadcasters to
top Arizona, 18-3, which dropped
to second with two first-place
votes and 1,162 points.
Missouri, 21-4, remained third
despite its loss to Oklahoma, re
ceiving two first-place votes and
1,096 points. Georgetown, 18-3,
dropped from second to fourth
after a 79-74 loss to Pittsburgh
with 1,001 points, 13 more than
Illinois, 20-3.
Duke, 17-4, led the Second Ten
with 641 points that included the
final first-place vote. The Blue
Devils were followed by Seton
Hall, Michigan, West Virginia,
lowa, Ohio State, Stanford,
Nevada-Las Vegas, North
Carolina State and Louisiana
State.
