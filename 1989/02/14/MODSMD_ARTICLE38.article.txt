While the Stanford women's
basketball team has rested atop
the Pacific 10 Conference all
season long, a Cardinal player has
only now been honored individu
ally.
For her efforts this weekend on
No. 4 Stanford's crucial road trip
to Washington and Washington
State, where the Cardinal ce
mented its hold on the Pac-1() lead
with wins over the second-place
Huskies and the sixth-place
Cougars, sophomore point guard
Sonja Henning was named Pac-1()
Player of the Week.
In Stanford's 69-65 win over
Washington last Thursday, Hen
ning shot 6-for-9 as she scored a
team-high 19 points. More sig
nifigantly, she remained cool un
der the pressure of the Huskies'
crowd and defense as she or
chestrated the Cardinal's offen
sive effort.

Henning won
Player of the Week
on one other occa
sion, the week of
Jan. 11,1988.

Henning followed this showing
Saturday evening at Washington
State with a 16-point, six-rebound
performance punctuated by a per
fect 6-for-6 field goal shooting.
Stanford prevailed again with an
89-67 decision, increasing the
team's winning streak to 13
games and upped its record to
19-2 overall, 11-0 in the Pac-10.
Henning was named Player of
the Week on one other occasion,
the week of Jan. 11, 1988.
