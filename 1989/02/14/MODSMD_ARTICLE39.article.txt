Kudos to The Daily
I've been reading The
Daily since 1947, when I
came to Stanford as an un
dergraduate. I never did
leave Stanford, having
worked next door for the
past 37 years, most of the
time (for my sins) as promo
tion manager.
I just wanted you to know
that, in terms of both con
tent and layout, you guys
have the best Daily sports
section I've ever seen.
Good luck.
