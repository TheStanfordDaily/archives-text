# Innovative academics gets mixed reviews
## 
### Maryellen Driscoll Staff writer 
While it continues to weather periods of
controversy over its course offerings, Innova
tive Academic Courses (lAC) is preparing for
yet another quarter of unusual and surprising
classes.
Every quarter lAC offers a variety of courses
which encompass controversial political issues
and are taught predominantly by students and
local activists. The lAC, a program in the
School of Humanities and Sciences, offers
courses under the auspices of Stanford
Workshops on Political and Socials Issues,
Undergraduate Special Courses and
Freshperson-Sophomore Seminars.
The accreditation committee, which consists

of three students and three faculty members,
will screen about 40 proposals over the next
two weeks before deciding which 18 courses
it will offer this spring. Possible courses in
clude "Male Gay Literature," "Nicaraguan
Revolution" and "Racism on College
Campuses." Credit for the courses range from
one to five units.
Although most lAC courses receive high
student ratings, they are occasionally criticized
for being too liberal or too subjective by pro
fessors and students, according to lAC Director
Margo Horn, a lecturer in the History De
partment.
It is often easy to criticize lAC courses
because they deal with issues that may
"engender controversy and criticism," said
graduate student Mark Vanteska, a former

member of the accreditation committee.
In addition, course instructors are often
political activists from the Bay Area. "We're
trying to bring activists here but activists who
can be critical of their own view and open
minded," Horn said, adding that "not all ac
tivists can do this."
Horn said lAC asks that the instructors do
not teach their views as a kind of polemic
but rather present the range of viewpoints on
the issue of the course.
Nevertheless, this policy has not always
been successful.
For example, last fall controversy arose over
a SWOPSI course entitled "Animal Rights or
Wrongs: a case for animal rights." Various
faculty, particularly from the Bi
ological Sciences Department, ob
jected not to the topic of the
course but to its slanted presen
tation by its instructors, who were
both local animal rights activists.
"Neither one of the teachers
(had) any background in science
— none," said Seymour Levine,
a professor of psychiatry, who is
involved exclusively in animal re
search at Stanford.
Levine, who sat in on a few of
the course's sessions, said the in
structors were incapable of rep
resenting the animal rights issue
"in any sense other than
propagandizing."
"I came away from this course
very chagrin that this was part
of the academic curriculum," he
added.
Of the seven students who were
enrolled in the animal rights
course, six rated the teachers per
formance as "excellent" and one
as "good."
Biological Sciences Prof. Robert

Sapolsky said, "... The structure
of the course and of its require
ments as well as they way sections
were conducted" made objective
teaching "impossible to occur."
Professors are not the only ones
concerned with the controversial
topics of the lAC. One of the lAC's
biggest critics is the conservative
student publication the Stanford
Review, Horn said. In an April
1988 article the Review described
lAC as being "little more than a
trade school for protesters" that
assumes "every problem in the
world" to be directly linked to
racism, sexism and elitism.
"I felt that the courses' offer
ings were very slanted ... a way
for people to get together and pro
mote agendas," said junior Sai
Prakash, author of the story.
"When you take courses from
professors you expect some objec
tivity ... but these courses seem
to be just based on opinion. . . .
It seems to me that they're just
legitimizing their view by giving
them academic credit," added
Prakash.
Refuting the article's accusa
tions, Horn said, "I think that
what people teach reflects

politics.. . . Others think it is
transmitting objective knowl
edge."
"It's someone that believes ed
ucation as being a transmission
to these higher truths," that views
anything political as a "vocational
training exercise," said Horn.
Despite the criticisms, lAC
courses do not typically invoke
much controversy.
Last quarter, for example, a
SWOPSI course called "Society
Behind Bars" was taught by an
ex-convict and a private inves
tigator. The instructors brought
in people who were "very liberal,
very conservative and in be
tween," according to senior Eric
Sten, who was enrolled in the
course.
During one session the instruc
tors had the warden of Folsom
State penitentiary debate with a
prison guard over the need to im
prove prisons.
"If anything, I wanted to hear
more from [the ex-convict in
struct], because he was really re
luctant to jump into his own
views"
lAC instructors are expected to
include in the proposal a resume,
a faculty sponsorship, a detailed
syllabus and a teaching recom
mendation if the instructor is an
undergraduate.
Once the accreditation commit
tee has determined which course
proposals to accept, Horn said she
conducts a compulsory workshop
for the spring instructors. She dis
cusses the ideology of the lAC
with an emphasis on the impor
tance of providing a "spectrum of
viewpoints."
In addition, she sits in on each
course once during the quarter.

Once the accreditation commit
tee has determined which course
proposals to accept, Horn said she
conducts a compulsory workshop
for the spring instructors. She dis
cusses the ideology of the lAC
with an emphasis on the impor
tance of providing a "spectrum of
viewpoints."
In addition, she sits in on each
course once during the quarter.
While it continues to weather periods of
controversy over its course offerings, Innova
tive Academic Courses (lAC) is preparing for
yet another quarter of unusual and surprising
classes.
Every quarter lAC offers a variety of courses
which encompass controversial political issues
and are taught predominantly by students and
local activists. The lAC, a program in the
School of Humanities and Sciences, offers
courses under the auspices of Stanford
Workshops on Political and Socials Issues,
Undergraduate Special Courses and
Freshperson-Sophomore Seminars.
The accreditation committee, which consists

of three students and three faculty members,
will screen about 40 proposals over the next
two weeks before deciding which 18 courses
it will offer this spring. Possible courses in
clude "Male Gay Literature," "Nicaraguan
Revolution" and "Racism on College
Campuses." Credit for the courses range from
one to five units.
Although most lAC courses receive high
student ratings, they are occasionally criticized
for being too liberal or too subjective by pro
fessors and students, according to lAC Director
Margo Horn, a lecturer in the History De
partment.
It is often easy to criticize lAC courses
because they deal with issues that may
"engender controversy and criticism," said
graduate student Mark Vanteska, a former

member of the accreditation committee.
In addition, course instructors are often
political activists from the Bay Area. "We're
trying to bring activists here but activists who
can be critical of their own view and open
minded," Horn said, adding that "not all ac
tivists can do this."
Horn said lAC asks that the instructors do
not teach their views as a kind of polemic
but rather present the range of viewpoints on
the issue of the course.
Nevertheless, this policy has not always
been successful.
For example, last fall controversy arose over
a SWOPSI course entitled "Animal Rights or
Wrongs: a case for animal rights." Various
faculty, particularly from the Bi
ological Sciences Department, ob
jected not to the topic of the
course but to its slanted presen
tation by its instructors, who were
both local animal rights activists.
"Neither one of the teachers
(had) any background in science
— none," said Seymour Levine,
a professor of psychiatry, who is
involved exclusively in animal re
search at Stanford.
Levine, who sat in on a few of
the course's sessions, said the in
structors were incapable of rep
resenting the animal rights issue
"in any sense other than
propagandizing."
"I came away from this course
very chagrin that this was part
of the academic curriculum," he
added.
Of the seven students who were
enrolled in the animal rights
course, six rated the teachers per
formance as "excellent" and one
as "good."
Biological Sciences Prof. Robert

Sapolsky said, "... The structure
of the course and of its require
ments as well as they way sections
were conducted" made objective
teaching "impossible to occur."
Professors are not the only ones
concerned with the controversial
topics of the lAC. One of the lAC's
biggest critics is the conservative
student publication the Stanford
Review, Horn said. In an April
1988 article the Review described
lAC as being "little more than a
trade school for protesters" that
assumes "every problem in the
world" to be directly linked to
racism, sexism and elitism.
"I felt that the courses' offer
ings were very slanted ... a way
for people to get together and pro
mote agendas," said junior Sai
Prakash, author of the story.
"When you take courses from
professors you expect some objec
tivity ... but these courses seem
to be just based on opinion. . . .
It seems to me that they're just
legitimizing their view by giving
them academic credit," added
Prakash.
Refuting the article's accusa
tions, Horn said, "I think that
what people teach reflects

politics.. . . Others think it is
transmitting objective knowl
edge."
"It's someone that believes ed
ucation as being a transmission
to these higher truths," that views
anything political as a "vocational
training exercise," said Horn.
Despite the criticisms, lAC
courses do not typically invoke
much controversy.
Last quarter, for example, a
SWOPSI course called "Society
Behind Bars" was taught by an
ex-convict and a private inves
tigator. The instructors brought
in people who were "very liberal,
very conservative and in be
tween," according to senior Eric
Sten, who was enrolled in the
course.
During one session the instruc
tors had the warden of Folsom
State penitentiary debate with a
prison guard over the need to im
prove prisons.
"If anything, I wanted to hear
more from [the ex-convict in
struct], because he was really re
luctant to jump into his own
views"
lAC instructors are expected to
include in the proposal a resume,
a faculty sponsorship, a detailed
syllabus and a teaching recom
mendation if the instructor is an
undergraduate.
