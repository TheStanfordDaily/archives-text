At the boardwalks aid,at the
start of the sea let's ask
Voltaire, King and Queen of
the open air what does he see.
Am I with you and you with
me?The shadows grow with
passing time. Does Voltaire
know, like aging wine,
cabernet leads to noble family.
The sunsets so the sun can
rise and warm the tears of
large brown eyes. To Mark
the end of starting lines and
bring us together as
Valentines.
Dearest Poo will you be mine?

Jeaneth,
O fair is love's first
hope to
gentle mind
As Eve's first star
thro' fleecy
cloudlet peeping;
And sweeter than the
gentle south
■west wind.
O'er willowy meads,
and shadow'd
waters creeping,
And Ceres golden
fields;~the
sultry hind.
Meets it with brow
uplift, and
stays his reaping.
Love Andrew
Linda- Too many times, I'm
at a
loss for words. And too many
times, I say the wrong things.
But today, hopefully, I can say
the right thing: I love you very
much and the best is yet to
come.

You call me from afar,
awaking me with your gentle

my day with you across the

In the dark before morning

You call me from afar,
awaking me with your gentle
voice. And as I begin to share
my day with you across the
miles, I realize that my life is
in you. You have touched the
center of my heart, filling me
with the rapture of being alive.

My darling Leonard,
In the dark before morning
birds begin their chorus,
You call me from afar,
awaking me with your gentle
voice. And as I begin to share
my day with you across the
miles, I realize that my life is
in you. You have touched the
center of my heart, filling me
with the rapture of being alive.
