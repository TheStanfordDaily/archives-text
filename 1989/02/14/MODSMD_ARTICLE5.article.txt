# Top volleyball recruit signs with Stanford
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior Staff writer 
When Stanford women's volley
ball Coach Don Shaw set his nets
in the recruiting waters last Sep
tember, he expected a good catch
but hardly a record haul.
With Volleyball Monthly's high
school Player of the Year Bev
Oden noncommital for most of the
recruiting period and considering
top-rated UCLA, Shaw was hope
ful but not confident of landing
the big one.
When the nets were all dragged
in, however, the Cardinal coach

proved to be the best fisherman
in the land by garnering the na
tion's top recruiting class.
Along with signing All -
Americans Carrie Feldman, Kristi
Paaso and Laurie Sawin last
Thursday, Stanford has also
gained the services of Oden, bring
ing a second star from volleyball's
royal family onto Stanford soil.
"It's nice to have an Oden back
on the Farm," Shaw said. "I was
so happy to hear her commit to
us."
