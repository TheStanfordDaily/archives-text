# Top volleyball recruit signs with Stanford
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior Staff writer 
When Stanford women's volley
ball Coach Don Shaw set his nets
in the recruiting waters last Sep
tember, he expected a good catch
but hardly a record haul.
With Volleyball Monthly's high
school Player of the Year Bev
Oden noncommital for most of the
recruiting period and considering
top-rated UCLA, Shaw was hope
ful but not confident of landing
the big one.
When the nets were all dragged
in, however, the Cardinal coach

proved to be the best fisherman
in the land by garnering the na
tion's top recruiting class.
Along with signing All -
Americans Carrie Feldman, Kristi
Paaso and Laurie Sawin last
Thursday, Stanford has also
gained the services of Oden, bring
ing a second star from volleyball's
royal family onto Stanford soil.
"It's nice to have an Oden back
on the Farm," Shaw said. "I was
so happy to hear her commit to
us."
Older sister Kim Oden, captain
of the 1988 U.S. Olympic Team
and the recipient of the Golden
Spike Award for the highest
hitting percentage in the Seoul
Olympics, played at Stanford
from 1982-1985, earning three
conference- and two NCAA
Player of the Year honors.
With Bev signing, the Cardi
nal will get another dose of
Oden excellence. The younger
Oden, a 6-foot-l middle block
er, led Irvine High School to
the California state title for the
past two years and could play
a similar role at Stanford.
"There's a lot to be said
about Bev: She's a great kid,
a good student, and many
people consider her the top
recruit in the country," Shaw
said. "With her physical talent,
she's going to help us be that
much stronger in the future."
Unlike this year's pair of
freshman phenoms, Kristin
Klein and Amy Cooper, Oden
need not step into the compet
itive limelight immediately.
Cooper, named to All-Pacific 10
Conference team as well as to
the league's All-Freshman
team, is now a well-established
and experienced player who
blended with captain Laura
Olesen to create a powerful
middle blocking tandem.
With freshman Nicole Ap
pleman as another strong con
tender for starting stardom,
Oden will find herself in good
company. According to Shaw,
this is precisely why she selec
ted Stanford.

"I think one of the aspects
that appealed to Bev was that
she wouldn't have to come here
and immediately carry the
load," Shaw said. "We've got
enough good players that she
is going to fit in when she's
ready to fit in."
The same is true for
Feldman, who the Cardinal
coaching staff considered to be
the top setter prospect in the
country. It was her Davis High
School team that Irvine bested
for the state championship this
year, but it was Feldman who
guided the squad to the
runner-up position.
Individually, however,
Feldman is hard to classify as
second-best. A first team All-
American, she is a player whose
academic success rivals her
athletic acclaim.
"It (Stanford) is the only
school I ever wanted to go to,"
Feldman said. "UCSB (UC-
Santa Barbara) has the beach,
but Stanford has really good
academics, and it's close
enough to the beach and San
Francisco."
The remaining pair, Paaso
and Sawin, are two other
heralded players. Paaso, a local
player hailing from neighbor
ing Los Altos, will provide
depth at all hitting positions
while Sawin will bolster Stan
ford's backcourt defense.
In all, Stanford has garnered
a well-balanced and skilled
group of players.
