# Jerusalem study program shelved
## 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
A lack of student applicants for
the new Stanford Program in
Jerusalem has forced Overseas
Studies officials to recommend an
indefinite postponement of the
program, which was scheduled to
begin fall quarter.
Only eight students applied for
the fledgling program, Director of
Overseas Studies Thomas Heller
said yesterday. Although no spe
cific minimum is specified, the
smallest Overseas Studies pro
gram currently is in Salamanca,
Spain, which has 15 participants.
Programs in Paris and Krakow
are each limited to approximately
20 students. Other overseas pro
grams, including Berlin, Oxford
and Florence average about 50
students, Heller said. All receive
an overflow of applications for the
quarterly programs.
A new program will open fall
quarter in Kyoto, Japan and plans
are in the works to open a pro
gram in Argentina spring quarter
of next year.
An indefinite postponement
means the Jerusalem program
will "go back to the drawing board

basically," Heller said, once the
action is approved by appropriate
faculty committees. Heller said
some rethinking will have to be
done to determine "what program
would be of use to those interested
in the Middle East."
English Prof. John Felstiner,
who was slated to direct the
Jerusalem program, said he was
"puzzled" by the lack of response.
"It's the most important city in
human history, at least for three
religions," Felstiner said, yet
"only a handful" of students ap
plied for the program.
"We have to have enough inter
est to make it worth [the Univer
sity's] investment and funding,"
Heller said, adding that there is
an "ongoing concern" that the
popularity of overseas programs
may decrease if the number of
programs increases too quickly.
Heller would not release the
names of the eight applicants until
he meets with them later this
week to discuss alternative ar
rangements.
Heller and Felstiner were hard
pressed to speculate about
reasons for the lack of applicants.
Felstiner cited "anxiety or uncer
tainty about the unrest" in Israel
as a possible reason, but he
warned that "it is hard to spec
ulate about an absence" of inter
est.
The new program also cannot
benefit from the positive feedback
that the more established pro
grams generate, Felstiner said.
An earlier Stanford program in
Haifa, Israel, which History Prof.
Mark Mancall supervised two
years ago, could have generated
interest, but Felstiner said miss
ing a year hurt continuing interest
in an Israel program.
Heller stressed that Overseas
Studies did "very heavy recruit
ing" for the program, including
class visits, selective mailings and
meeting with faculty supportive
of the program. Although the pro
gram tried to retain "a lot of
flexibility and accomodate differ
ent interest," Heller said the pro
gram "apparently didn't meet the
needs" of interested students.
