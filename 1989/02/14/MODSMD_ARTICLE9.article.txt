# Experts downplay meningitis fears
## 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
Although the Cowell Student
Health Center and the Palo Alto
Clinic received more than 100
calls this weekend regarding the
alleged meningitis epidemic affect
ing Santa Clara County, experts
say there is no cause for alarm.
"There is a lot of concern but
no evidence, and there is no
epidemic," emphasized Dr. Paul
Walters, director of Cowell Stu
dent Health Services.
Meningitis occurs when the
membranes covering the brain be
come infected and inflamed. Some
forms of meningitis can be fatal,
but it is treatable in its early
stages.
"Most of us have the immunity
and are relatively infrequently ex
posed to the organism. Normally,
we don't get infected," said Dr.
Jack Remington, professor of
medicine and physician at the
Stanford Hospital.
Local media have brought the
meningitis issue into the limelight

due to three cases in the area
that have been reported over the
past week, and an overall rise in
the record-high number of cases
reported in Santa Clara County
since last October.
• William McKissock, a senior
at Gunn High School in Los Altos,
died Friday night at Stanford
Hospital. McKissock died of
meningitis, but according to
Remington, results of the autopsy
have not proven that McKissock
died of the most dangerous
epidemic-causing meningococcal
strain.
• In a separate incident at Ardis
E. Egan Intermediate School in
Los Altos, four children and one
sibling were afflicted with a
meningitis-related infection.
• An inmate at the Elmwood
detention center in San Jose has
been diagnosed in serious condi
tion with meningitis, and another
has been hospitalized with similar
symptoms.
As a result of the infection at
Egan, Health Officials in Santa
Clara County vaccinated and dis
tributed antibiotics to the entire
student body.
Because there is no apparent
link between the high school and
junior high cases, officials at
Gunn have decided not to vac
cinate and distribute antibiotics
to the student body.
Walters said he was relieved
that those events did not occur at
the same time as the ongoing flu
epidemic because even more "hys
teria" would have resulted.
Dr. John Dorman, associate di
rector of Cowell, agreed with Wal
ters that undue media attention
had raised hysteria in the com
munity. He said doctors at the
Stanford Medical School have re
ceived phone calls reporting four
cases of meningitis which were
"completely untrue."
There are many forms of
meningitis, but it infects its vic
tims either through viruses or
bacteria. Viral or asceptic menin

gitis is more common than bac
terial meningitis and is the less
serious of the two cases.
Side effects of the vaccine in
clude a redness and soreness, and
the actual immunity to the infec
tion does not set in until two
weeks after the shot.
Senior Anne Marie Krogh was
infected witfo bacterial meningitis
during her freshman year. She
said she was disturbed to hear of
the recent reports on the news
because it "was like being slapped
in the face as to the seriousness
of my own illness."
Krogh said her symptoms sud
denly onset overnight, much like
McKissock's.
"When I went into Cowell, they
told me I had a one in 1,000
chance of having bacterial menin
gitis." Krogh spent nine days in
critical condition, and then an
other five weeks in the hospital.
Senior Aimee Berzins con
tracted viral meningitis at the be
ginning of the summer. She said
she was not aware that the
symptoms such as a chronic head
ache, pain in the neck and overall
depression could be any type of
serious illness.
