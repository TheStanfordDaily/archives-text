# Area firm sues student developer of 'talking glove'

### John Wagner Editorial staff 
A Stanford graduate student who has
developed a "talking glove" to allow non
vocal deaf and deaf-blind people to com
municate is being sued by a Redwood
City company that alleges he infringed
on the company's proprietary rights.
The suit, filed Feb. 6, charges that
James Kramer, a doctoral candidate in
electrical engineering, violated a confiden
tiality agreement he signed in 1986 which
gave him access to VPL Research, Inc.'s
proprietary glove technology.
According to a press release issued by
the company, "Kramer simply copied and

used VPL technology, claiming it as its
own."
Kramer has denied all charges made
by the company. He told The Daily yes
terday that VPL's "allegations are totally
untrue."
Another graduate student, a Stanford
staff member and the University are aJso
named in the suit, which was filed in
the Superior Court of California.
The company is seeking compensatory
and punitive damages of $500,000.
Harold Hohbach, the attorney defend
ing Kramer, told The Daily yesterday
that his client had "independently devel
oped a superior instrumental glove using
new and different sensor technology." The

glove created by Kramer, "did not use
the alleged proprietary technology of
VPL," Hohback added.
Jack Russo, the attorney representing
VPL, said he thought a "long technical
battle" to determine the similarity of the
gloves is likely to take place in the case.
Kramer's "talking glove" is an
electronic glove which gathers informa
tion about the angle of fingers from sen
sors and translates those angles into let
ters. The results are then synthesized
electronically and amplified through por
table speakers.
The University is named in the suit
because Kramer previously relinquished
the rights for his glove to Stanford. A

patent application was filed for the glove
through the University's Office of Tech
nology Liscensing.
University attorney Jasper Williams
said that Stanford has received VPL's
complaint, but has no access to informa
tion that would be necessary to verify or
disprove it.
Following the suit, a temporary
restraining order was issued by the court
last week to prevent Kramer or Stanford
from gaining financially from the glove
until a hearing takes place.
A hearing date for the case has been
set for Feb. 22, but both Williams and
the attorney representing VPL the date
was likely to be pushed back due to the

large amount of technical information in
volved in the case.
Jean-Jacques Grimaud, president of
VPL, told The Daily yesterday that the
law suit against Kramer was "absolutely
a last resort."
Russo said that the company had tried
"a number of times" to resolve the dis
pute "on an amicable basis."
Williams said the University proposed
confidential, non-binding third-party ar
bitration to judge if VPL's proprietary
rights were violated, but the company
refused. A meeting with company repre
sentatives to determine what information
