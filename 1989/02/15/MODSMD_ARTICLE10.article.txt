In a hour-long, question-and
answer session at Palo Alto
Town Hall last night, U.S. Rep.
Tom Campbell, R-Santa Clara,
advocated a tax increase for
gasoline, alcohol and tobacco as
well as a halt to off-shore oil
drilling in California.
"I was pleased (with the State
of the Union Addressl, and I'm

very optimistic," Campbell said,
summing up his first four weeks
in the House. Fleeted last No
vember, Campbell is currently
on leave from his position as a
professor at the Stanford Law
School.
Opposing President Rush's
policy, Campbell said increased
tax revenues are necessary to
reduce the budget deficit. He
said he approves of a tax in

crease of 10 to 12 cents per gal
lon of gasoline and 18 cents per
pack of cigarettes.
Although he said he supports
the government's goal to reduce
the deficit from $128 billion to
$100 billion by October 1989,
Campbell added that cutting
spending alone will not work. .
The tax increases alone would
bring in $22 billion, he esti
mated.
