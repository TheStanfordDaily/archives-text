"The show is oppression, not
entertainment," said Jacob
Holdt of his four-hour speech
and slide show Monday night to
an standing room only crowd at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The show portrays the oppres
sion of America's lower class
and is a deliberately one-sided

view, Holdt said. Although the
slides were taken in the mid
-19705, things have gotten worse
since then, he said.
Holdt, a Dane, spent five years
travelling across all parts of
America and living with 400
families, ranging in status from
the Rockefellers to lower-class
Americans living in ghettos.
Since then, he has written
"American Pictures," a book
about his experiences with the
lower class. He has toured the
United States speaking at
churches and universities and
has appeared here six times.
According to Holdt, his time
as a vagabond opened his eyes
to society's oppression of the un
derclass. Living with the
downtrodden, he was able to em
pathize with them rather than
adopt what he called the "racist
attitude of most Europeans" be
cause he "first stayed on the
black side of America."
"How can these people be

called free when everything
reminds them of slavery?"
Holdt asked. "They earn 4 cents
a pound picking cotton that is
later resold for 72 cents." This
barely provides enough for the
people to pay their rent and buy
food, Holdt said.
Slides of the workers' flimsy
shacks were juxtaposed with
pictures of millionaires' homes.
In the background rang a
chorus, "Today they say we are
free, only to be chained in this
poverty," underscoring the grim
situation.
"Twenty-one of my friends
have died since I first began my
journey," said Holdt, citing mal
nutrition, rat bites and violence
as some of the most common
causes of death in the lower
class.
The system "perpetuates and
intensifies the traits of these
people," Holdt said. They start
to believe what they hear about
themselves.
