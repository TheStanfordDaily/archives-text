## Bhopal claims settled Union Carbide to pay $470 million to India 
### 
NEW DELHI, India (AP) — Union Car
bide Corp. agreed yesterday to pay $470
million to the government of India in a
court-ordered settlement resulting from the
1984 gas leak at Bhopal that killed more
than 3,300 people in the world's worst
industrial disaster.
Activists in Bhopal denounced the settle
ment as a betrayal of the 20,000 victims
who still suffer from exposure to the deadly
gas that escaped from a pesticides plant
on Dec. 3, 1984. The government had
sought $3 billion in damages.
Chief Justice R.S. Pathak interrupted a
government prosecutor's routine argument
when the court reconvened after lunch, and
ordered the U.S.-based multinational com
pany to pay the damages by Mar. 31.
Attorneys for the government and Union
Carbide promptly agreed.
"It was apparent that there was an out
of-court agreement between Union Carbide
and the government," said a court official
who spoke on condition of anonymity. "For
such an order there should have been ex
citement, but there was no murmur even."
"It wasn't entirely out of the blue," said
another source, who also spoke on condition
of anonymity.
Pathak, citing "the enormity of human
suffering," said a settlement was needed
to "provide immediate and substantial
relief."
More than 2,000 people were killed al
most immediately when the white vapor
of methyl isocyanate seeped from a storage
tank at the plant operated by Union Car
bide's Indian subsidiary and drifted over
nearby shantytowns and into Bhopal.

The leak occurred shortly after midnight,
and some victims died in their sleep.
Others, blinded by tears and gasping for
breath, tried to flee but collapsed in death.
More than 20,000 people still suffer from
exposure to the gas and victims continue
to die at a rate of at least one a day,
according to a government gas relief board.
It says the death toll has reached 3,329.
Pathak, speaking for a five-judge Su
preme Court panel, ordered Union Carbide
to pay $470 million to the Indian govern
ment "in full and final settlement of all
claims, rights and liabilities related to and
arising out of the Bhopal gas disaster."
He also ordered all civil proceedings
transferred to the Supreme Court, and
quashed all criminal charges, including one
of culpable homicide filed in 1987 against
former Union Carbide chairman Warren
Anderson.
Pathak gave no details of how the money
should be paid to the victims, but he di
rected government prosecutors and attor
neys for the Danbury, Conn.-based com
pany to submit a detailed agreement today.
"This is a fair and just settlement," Gopal
Subramanium, one of the chief government
attorneys, told a reporter.
In New York, Union Carbide spokesman
Earl Slack said Pathak's order "was based
on its review of all pleadings in India and
the U.S., applicable law and facts, and the
enormity of human suffering that requires
substantial and immediate aid."
Union Carbide's stock price soared from
$29.12 to $31.25 a share in early trading
on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday,
and analysts said they approved of the
settlement. The closing price was $31.12.
