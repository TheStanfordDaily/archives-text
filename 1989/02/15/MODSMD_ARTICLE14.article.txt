# Judge rejects North proposal

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The judge in Oliver
North's case said yesterday the Justice Department
must rely on independent prosecutors to prevent
surprise disclosures of state secrets during the Iran-
Contra trial.
U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell rejected a
proposal he said would have allowed the Justice
Department during the trial to file objections "in
bits and pieces" to disclosing information needed
by the defense.
Gesell challenged the Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh to end the case once and for all, by
filing an affidavit barring disclosure of secrets, if
Thornburgh believed procedures the judge has
adopted are inadequate to protect national security.
"He can act now if he wants," Gesell told
Thornburgh aide Stephen Saltzburg.
The decision means the Justice Department must
decide whether it can rely on independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh to protect secrets that the depart
ment has said could endanger lives if disclosed in
court.
"Our lawyers are reviewing the judge's order,"
said Thornburgh aide David Runkel, adding thaf
Justice Department officials have been meeting with
the independent counsel.
"There are a number of things being discussed
back and forth," Runkel said. "It's a question of.
reviewing the options. We want the trial to continue,
but we want to safeguard against the unauthorized
release of classified information," Runkel said.
In the meantime, Gesell said he will await a
Supreme Court ruling on whether the trial will be
stayed indefinitely while an appellate court reviews '
the Justice Department's objection to secrecy pro
cedures already put in place by the judge.
The high court, which has temporarily stayed the
trial's start, will meet Friday to discuss the issue.
