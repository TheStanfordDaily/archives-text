# Khomeini calls for novelist's execution
## 'Satanic Verses' author taking threats seriously, may cancel U.S. tour: 
### 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini yesterday
commanded Moslems to kill the author and
publishers of "The Satanic Verses," a novel
he said blasphemes Islam. Some reports said
writer Salman Rushdie had sought police
protection.
The Iranian spiritual leader's order to the
fundamentalist faithful of Islam drew a mix
ture of support and opposition from Moslems
around the world. Rushdie said he was taking
the threat "very seriously indeed."
Scotland Yard would not comment on the
British radio reports that Rushdie, who lives
in London, had sought police protection.
Rushdie's agent, Gillon Aitken, said he
would talk with his New York associates about
whether a U.S. lecture tour, scheduled to begin
Friday, should go ahead.
"The Satanic Verses" was published in Brit

ain late last year to critical acclaim and heated
protests from Moslems. The protests spread
to other nations and culminated in violence
that claimed at least six lives in Pakistan and
India since Sunday.
The protests continued yesterday in India,
Rushdie's native land. Police in Srinager and
Anantnag in northern Jammu-Kashmir state
used batons and tear gas against demonstra
tors who threw stones at cars and shops.
About 50 people suffered injuries, mostly
minor, according to news reports.
"The Satanic Verses" has been banned in
India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt and South
Africa.
Yesterday, a Tehran Radio broadcast quoted
Khomeini as saying Rushdie and his publish
ers "are hereby sentenced to death."
"I call on all zealous Moslems to execute

them quickly, wherever they find them, so
that no one will dare to insult Islamic
sanctity," the broadcast quoted him as saying.
"Whoever is killed doing this will be regarded
as a martyr and will go directly to heaven."
Rushdie, 41, told the British Broadcasting
Corp. he was saddened. "I doubt very much
that Khomeini or anybody else in Iran has
read the book or more than selected extracts
out of context," he said.
Asked whether he was alarmed by
Khomeini's threats, Rushdie said: "I think I
have to take them very seriously indeed."
In a pre-recorded program broadcast last
night on commercial television, Rushdie said:
"It seems to me completely legitimate that
there should be dissent from orthodoxy, not
just about Islam but about anything."
