# S. African minister meets strikers' lawyers

JOHANNESBURG, South
Africa (AP) â€” A government min
ister met yesterday with lawyers
and parents of some of the nearly
300 black detainees who have
vowed to starve themselves to
death unless they are freed or
charged with a crime.
In support of the hunger
strikers, Anglican Archbishop
Desmond Tutu called on
Anglicans to fast each Monday,
Wednesday and Friday.

After a two-hour evening meet
ing with Adriaan Vlok, minister
of law and order, one member of
the six-parent delegation, Wallace
Motsetsi, said he felt there was
"a ray of hope." But delegate
Willie Bokala said the meeting
"achieved nothing."
Bokala said he was guardian of
Clive Radebe, 25, who he said has
been in detention since November
1987 and entered his 21st day of
a hunger strike yesterday.

"We are faced with the difficult
situation that children may die in
detention," Bokala said before the
meeting.
Lt. Peet Bothma, spokesman
Vlok, said detainees are reviewed
and released every day, and 17
were freed yesterday.
But he warned it was dangerous
to free detainees who were on
hunger strike "because they
might go out and fill themselves
up, and they could die."

He said two were freed Monday,
two days after they started eating
again. He said they were not re
leased because they broke their
fast, but because of the regular
review of detainees.
Some strikers have not eaten
for 22 days, and 21 reportedly
have been hospitalized. Vlok says
fewer than 1,000 people are being
held under national emergency
laws which allow indefinite deten
tion without charge.
