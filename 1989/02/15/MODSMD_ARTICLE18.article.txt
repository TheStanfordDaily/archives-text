JERUSALEM (AP) - Faisal
Husseini, a leading supporter of
the PLO in the occupied ter
ritories, met with left-wing Israeli
legislators yesterday in the first
such contact since the Palestinian
uprising began 14 months ago.
"It was a general meeting and
we discussed personal subjects,"
Husseini said after the two-hour
session at a guest house in Arab
east Jerusalem. He would say no
more and members of the Israeli
delegation declined comment.
Among the Israelis were Labor
Party legislator Chaim Ramon;
Chaim Tzadok, a former Labor
justice minister; legislator Yair
Tzaban of the socialist party
Mapam, and Mapam's general sec
retary, Elazar Granot.

Government policy prohibits
contacts with the Palestine Lib
eration Organization, but leftist
legislators want that changed on
grounds the PLO is Israel's inev
itable partner in peace negotia
tions. The government considers
the PLO a terrorist organization.
Husseini, who has spent 18 of
the past 22 months in Israeli pris
ons under "administrative deten
tion" without trial, has expressed
willingness to meet with Israelis
of all political viewpoints.
"I would like to spend more and
more time talking with different
groups of Israelis, not only groups
that support my aims but those
who are not supporting our aims,"
he said in an interview earlier yes
terday.
