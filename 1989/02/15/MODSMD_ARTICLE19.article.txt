Wheelchair lifts ordered on buses
PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Advocates for the
disabled yesteday hailed a federal court ruling
requiring wheelchair lifts on new public buses,
but a spokesman for transit agencies said the
ruling doesn't address vexing problems.
"We've been grappling with this for a long
time," said Albert Engelken, deputy executive
director of the Washington-based American
Public Transit Association.
He said wheelchair lifts receive limited use
where they exist and are an added expense to
transit agencies at a time when federal subsidies
have been dwindling.
On Monday a 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
panel ruled 2-1 that Congress has made its wishes
on accessibility clear and that lift-equipped buses
are part of that mandate.
The court ordered the U.S. Transportation De
partment to rewrite a regulation allowing com
munities to offer alternative "paratransit" serv
ice, such as van rides, to the disabled. It said
the 24-hour reservations that riders need to make

for such services hinder spontaneous use of mass
transit.
James D. Fornari, a New York City attorney
for a group of veterans with spinal cord injuries,
said the ruling will force transit systems to look
for the most efficient means of serving disabled
people.
Baker sells controversial stocks
ROME (AP) — Secretary of State James A.
Baker 111 announced yesterday he will sell his
holdings in a New York bank and all his other
publicly traded stock, a move prompted by ques
tions from President Bush's ethics chief about
potential conflicts of interest.
Baker said the decision went "well beyond"
what was required by law or had been recom
mended to him by government lawyers.
Baker's decision, which a spokesman said had
been reached Saturday but was announced only
yesterday, came as Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee sources said the panel had asked Baker
more than a week ago for additional detailed
information about his holdings.
