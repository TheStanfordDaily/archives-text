Before a focus house
gets the OK, look at
resources already here

HERE'S AN opportunity
the University cannot
refuse: a focus house that
greatly enhances the academic re
sources available through Stan
ford's residences.
On Feb. 21, Residential Edu
cation will decide the fate of four
new focus house proposals. The
four houses deal with very dif
ferent issues: environmental
awareness, feminist or gender
studies, international studies and
Judaic studies.
Although the University al
ready offers some resources in
all four academic fields, each of
the houses gives students a
chance to learn and discuss the
issue outside of the classroom.
Focus houses can mean enhanced
resources for increasingly pop
ular and relevant fields.
Despite the pluses each focus
house proposal offers, Res Ed
should be careful not to go over
board during next week's evalu
ation process.
When judging focus house ap
plications, Res Ed should make
sure the proposed houses do not
offer programing and living ar
rangements that overlap with
existing campus houses.
Of the four proposals, interna
tional studies and environmental
awareness focus houses seem un
necessary because students inter
ested in those areas can opt to
live in Hammarskjold, Columbae
or Synergy.
Hammarskjold, the interna
tional co-op, facilitates discussion
of international issues.The inter

national focus house proposal
asks that freshmen from outside
the United States be given the
chance to live together to ease
their adjustment to the United
States, but many resources, such
as the Bechtel International Cen
ter already help those students
adjust.
Columbae and Synergy allow
students to live in environment
ally-sound surroundings of their
own design. How can students
obtain a greater understanding
of environmental issues without
applying what they've learned to
their own home? As co-ops,
Columbae and Synergy residents
purchase, even grow, their own
food.
Unlike the international and
environmental house proposals,
feminist studies and Judaic
studies focus houses fill a void
at Stanford. Such houses could
complement existing academic
programs and non-residential re
sources.
A feminist studies house would
be a fine counterpart to the
Feminist Studies Program and
the Women's Center without
overlapping. The house would al
low men and women to discuss
gender issues in a residential en
vironment.
In addition, the Judaic studies
house will differ from Hillel, the
Jewish student organization, as
it intends to explore Jewish his
tory and culture, rather than re
ligion. However, as it now stands,
the proposal is missing one cru
cial element that will make the
house complete, a kosher kitchen.
So far, Adams House stands
alone as the University's only
focus house. The opportunity to
add to the list of innovative ac
ademics residences should not
slip away.
