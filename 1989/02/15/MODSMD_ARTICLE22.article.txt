Jazz is legitimate study and deserves more money

AS MANAGER OF the jazz band
and producer of last summer's
benefit concert for the Stanford
Jazz Program, I was pleasantly sur
prised to read The Daily's Feb. 6
article concerning the financial plight
of the jazz program. I commend The
Daily for its willingness to bring this
issue to the attention of the Stanford
community.
The article, however, failed to ad
dress several issues which I believe are
;nore basic to the problems which
plague the Stanford Jazz Program.
Albert Cohn, acting chair of the
Music Department, is quoted in the
article, saying "the greatest problem
affecting the jazz program is the ab
sence of 'ongoing fundraising.'"
Indeed, the lack of funds is a major

difficulty, but I believe a more crucial
problem exists in the failure of the
Music Department and the School of
Humanities and Sciences to fully exam
ine the question: "Why should Stanford
(or any university) have a jazz pro
gram?"
To formulate an answer to such a
question, one might look to the educa
tional needs of students. I often hear
people say that they cannot appreciate
jazz or classical music because they do
not understand it.
Any Stanford student can count on
finding a class to aid his or her under
standing of classical music, but educa
tional opportunities in jazz, reliant on
unsteady funding from outside the
University, may not be available. If the
once popular jazz theory and history

courses are permanently "retrenched,"
the interests of more than 100 students
a year will be ignored.
But music is more than a theoretical
construct; it is a cultural product. A
well-designed jazz program at Stanford
would contribute significantly to the
opportunities for cultural awareness
which the University claims to encour
age.
A Stanford student may not know
the theoretical mechanics of classical
music, but having taken Western Cul
ture, he or she is well acquainted with
the white European male background
which produced classical music. On the
other hand, students presently have
few opportunities to learn about the
black and white American men and
women who invented jazz music, nor

do they have many chances to learn
about the African roots of jazz.
I believe it is important for anyone
who likes music to know that "the
Blues" is a 12-bar musical form, but I
also believe it is vital for everyone to
know about the culture and the cir
cumstances which produced "the
Blues."
It is true, as the Feb. 6 article
states, that Stanford is under no obli
gation to financially support jazz, but
if this university truly values education
and ethnic diversity, then it should
carefully examine the benefits of a
fully-funded jazz program.
