# Why kick Mike? He's already down
## 
### 
I am writing in response to Burke
Smith's Feb. 10 column entitled
"Postmortem on a hero." Or, as it
should have been entitled, "Let's kick
the former presidential candidate when
he's down, then step on him."
Although I am a Democrat, I am
always interested in hearing a challeng
ing, intelligently-argued Republican or
conservative viewpoint, or constructive
criticism of a candidate I support.
Smith's column provided neither of
these. It simply added insult to injury,
two things which I think Michael Du
kakis got more than his fair share of
during a recent and fundamentally
nauseating campaign which most of us
are now trying to forget.
In particular, I think that when
Smith mentioned that Dukakis' wife
was recently admitted to an alcohol

treatment program, the columnist
placed himself on the level of such
accomplished men as Lee Atwater, the
Bush campaigner who made Willie
Horton a household name.
I also find it very unfair that
Smith's "facts" placed all of the blame
for the Massachusetts budgetary crisis
on Dukakis yet managed to give the
governor none of the credit for that
state's economic success.
If I wanted to sink to taking pot
shots like that, then I'd say how glad I
am that when referring to reckless
spending, Smith did not fail to speak
of President Reagan.
If the ability to create huge deficits
has anything to do with qualifying a
man to be president of the United
States, then I guess Dukakis really
doesn't deserve to follow in the
footsteps of Ronald Reagan.
After all, Dukakis' "tax-and-spend"
deficit only reached the millions, which
simply doesn't rank with Reagan's
stellar augmentation of the national

debt, via deficits more of the spend-on-
Star-Wars, and-spend-more-on-the-
Contras, but-don't-tax-the-rich variety.
Smith may be glad that Dukakis
lost, but what can we now expect as
the "rosy facade" Reagan created fades
under George Bush? Well, considering
that the most specific budget strategy
President Bush has articulated to date
is "no new taxes," I think that we will
all be feeling the repercussions of the
national debt soon.
No matter what the consequences for
America, though, Bush has insurance.
He's unimpeachable. And if Smith is
implying that we made some sort of
narrow escape because "Michael Duka
kis was one step away from becoming
president," let me say I find it much
more frightening to consider that Dan
Quayle is currently only a heartbeat
away.
I honestly have been trying hard not
to think too much about abortion, the
Supreme Court or Latin America. I
think it's time we all put the campaign

and the Reagan era behind us and
faced the next four years optimistically
and with an open mind. It would be a
little easier, though, without someone
telling me how lucky I am that Mi
chael Dukakis lost.
