## Just say yes to meditation 
### 
RELIEF: I FELT A GIANT sigh of
it as B put down the receiver. Sit
ting in his room, I involuntarily
overheard B's conversation with our
mutual friend, I), about not being able
to get the "merchandise."
He hesitated before he said this eu
phemism. He was talking about the
joints, the reefers, the hash (or whatever
you want to call it — I can't know the
correct terminology) for that night's
planned "smoke-out." At about 10 p.m.,
B,D, M and U would be pleasantly hal
lucinating.
B's voice betrayed his disappointment,
and he said, "That's OK, maybe another
week." I smiled and thought, "too bad."
I felt so good, as if some impossible (how
statistically probable is the impossible?
Ask Dr. Stork — he teaches Psych 60)
and wonderful force had intervened to
snatch the evil weed from their greasy
palms.
My smile did not last long, though,
because I remembered that action and
intention are equally important. Though
they did not succeed, B, D, M and U had
still intended to get stoned as bats. Their
intentions, although not fulfilled in ac
tion, were like tiny erasers that could
wipe out the smile and sigh of relief that
I had drawn on my face. That smacks
me hard.
Lameness: The day before, I had heard
M jokingly say, "Oh man, we don't even
have a bong. That's sooo lame." Eventu
ally, by the powers of reason and deduc
tion (Thank God I haven't toyed with
them by inhaling burning fungus in
bongs), I figured out what was going on.

My only question was why? Why?
WHY? B told me in his straightforward
manner, "We simply feel like we need to.
Why not? How do you know it's wrong?"
At the time, I couldn't logically explain
to myself ' Why not?" and so I said noth
ing.
Why Not: I'm pretty sure he knows
the general scientific reasons for why not:
brain cells, addiction, hallucination. And
he knows that the whole world tells you
not to.
I hear the screams of non-conformist
individualists with the challenges, "How
does society know what's right for me?"
They're absolutely right. Surely I am
not one to obey blindly societal demands.
No way!
I found out that M has never "done
drugs" before. So after my frustration
with B's response of "why not," I turned
to M and asked him, "Why?" M told me
he wanted to see what it was like.
Ah! Experimentation! New experiences!
Then you can judge for yourself, without
mindlessly obeying the law.
The flaw in that logic is that you try
drugs so you have an experience, and
this experience will be something your
mind can rationally base a decision upon.
So you can decide for yourself.
But that experience alters your percep
tion so you can't make that rational de
cision — the experimenter in his deluded
state either likes it (and now he's got a
problem), or he doesn't (so the experi
ment was pretty useless and you've man
aged to destroy a few brain cells in the
process). Either way he would have been
better off if he had not run the experi

ment. What a waste of time.
Stanford is a "Church of Reason." It
hopes that you ask questions, think for
yourself and experiment with new ways
of seeing. But what's implied is that you
use your mind and spend your time on
useful things — not experimentation in
drugs, but experimentation in thought.
The faculty and the students are sup
posed to explore intellectually, not psyc
hedelically.
Users argue that drugs allow them to
see new things. My first two columns
have been based on new ways of seeing.
The best understanding comes from new
perspectives. But these insights should
come from within, from your creative
self, not from drug-induced reveries.
I urge D, U, M and B to remember
that Drug Users Make Blunders (DUMB).
Idealistically, I imagine a world without
so many restrictive laws, where drugs
are legal.
But realistically, there are some who
"just say yes" and some who "just say
no." Spending millions of dollars on tele
vision commercials telling people to "just
say no" will have no great long-term
effect. It's not a matter of just saying
no, that's mindless. Common sense and
individual thought can't be bought. It's
really a matter of your creative self.

The best understanding comes from new
perspectives. But these insights should
come from within, from your creative
self, not from drug-induced reveries.
I urge D, U, M and B to remember
that Drug Users Make Blunders (DUMB).
Idealistically, I imagine a world without
so many restrictive laws, where drugs
are legal.
But realistically, there are some who
"just say yes" and some who "just say
no." Spending millions of dollars on tele
vision commercials telling people to "just
say no" will have no great long-term
effect. It's not a matter of just saying
no, that's mindless. Common sense and
individual thought can't be bought. It's
really a matter of your creative self.

RELIEF: I FELT A GIANT sigh of
it as B put down the receiver. Sit
ting in his room, I involuntarily
overheard B's conversation with our
mutual friend, I), about not being able
to get the "merchandise."
He hesitated before he said this eu
phemism. He was talking about the
joints, the reefers, the hash (or whatever
you want to call it — I can't know the
correct terminology) for that night's
planned "smoke-out." At about 10 p.m.,
B,D, M and U would be pleasantly hal
lucinating.
B's voice betrayed his disappointment,
and he said, "That's OK, maybe another
week." I smiled and thought, "too bad."
I felt so good, as if some impossible (how
statistically probable is the impossible?
Ask Dr. Stork — he teaches Psych 60)
and wonderful force had intervened to
snatch the evil weed from their greasy
palms.
My smile did not last long, though,
because I remembered that action and
intention are equally important. Though
they did not succeed, B, D, M and U had
still intended to get stoned as bats. Their
intentions, although not fulfilled in ac
tion, were like tiny erasers that could
wipe out the smile and sigh of relief that
I had drawn on my face. That smacks
me hard.
Lameness: The day before, I had heard
M jokingly say, "Oh man, we don't even
have a bong. That's sooo lame." Eventu
ally, by the powers of reason and deduc
tion (Thank God I haven't toyed with
them by inhaling burning fungus in
bongs), I figured out what was going on.

My only question was why? Why?
WHY? B told me in his straightforward
manner, "We simply feel like we need to.
Why not? How do you know it's wrong?"
At the time, I couldn't logically explain
to myself ' Why not?" and so I said noth
ing.
Why Not: I'm pretty sure he knows
the general scientific reasons for why not:
brain cells, addiction, hallucination. And
he knows that the whole world tells you
not to.
I hear the screams of non-conformist
individualists with the challenges, "How
does society know what's right for me?"
They're absolutely right. Surely I am
not one to obey blindly societal demands.
No way!
I found out that M has never "done
drugs" before. So after my frustration
with B's response of "why not," I turned
to M and asked him, "Why?" M told me
he wanted to see what it was like.
Ah! Experimentation! New experiences!
Then you can judge for yourself, without
mindlessly obeying the law.
The flaw in that logic is that you try
drugs so you have an experience, and
this experience will be something your
mind can rationally base a decision upon.
So you can decide for yourself.
But that experience alters your percep
tion so you can't make that rational de
cision — the experimenter in his deluded
state either likes it (and now he's got a
problem), or he doesn't (so the experi
ment was pretty useless and you've man
aged to destroy a few brain cells in the
process). Either way he would have been
better off if he had not run the experi

ment. What a waste of time.
Stanford is a "Church of Reason." It
hopes that you ask questions, think for
yourself and experiment with new ways
of seeing. But what's implied is that you
use your mind and spend your time on
useful things — not experimentation in
drugs, but experimentation in thought.
The faculty and the students are sup
posed to explore intellectually, not psyc
hedelically.
Users argue that drugs allow them to
see new things. My first two columns
have been based on new ways of seeing.
