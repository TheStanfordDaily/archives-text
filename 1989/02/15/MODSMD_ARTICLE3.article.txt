# Tuition up 8 percent
## Board responds to projected budget deficit 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
A projected severe budget deficit for the
University next year took its toll yesterday,
as the Board of Trustees approved a higher
tuition increase than expected, 8 percent
for undergraduate and graduate students.
Along with a room and board hike of
6.4 percent, the increase will bring the total
cost of undergraduate education at Stan
ford to $19,164, up from $17,821 this year.
According to a University administration
report presented to the trustees, the in
creases are needed to help combat a
projected $11 million budget shortfall in
1989-90, which was announced by Provost
James Rosse last December. At that time,
Rosse, the University's chief budget officer,
had predicted that the tuition increase
would be 6.5 percent, or 2 percent above
the inflation rate.
"Because of the seriousness of the budget
situation for 1989-90 the tuition recom
mendation is clearly well above our long
run projection of inflation plus 2 percent,"
the report said. "However, it is important
that we maintain academic program mo
mentum."
While tuition will go up 8 percent next
year, the increase was only 5.8 percent for
this academic year. That was the Univer
sity's lowest rate of increase in the past

decade.
The trustees also approved cost hikes
for students in Stanford's professional
schools. Tuition for medical and graduate
engineering students will increase 8 percent
next year, Law School tuition will increase
7.5 percent and an 8.7 percent increase will
be levied on students in the Graduate
School of Business.
The projected budget deficit
was caused by increased costs for
faculty development, health and
safety, library acquisitions and
employee benefits, according to
the report. Tuition, comprising
half of the income to the Univer
sity's operating budget, will "in
crease at a rate faster than in
recent years" to make up for the
deficit.
However, Stanford's policy of
meeting the demonstrated finan
cial need of undergraduates will
continue to maintain "the affor
dability of a Stanford education
to a wide range of students," the
report said.
According to the University
News Service, similar tuition
hikes have been approved at other
top universities recently. Brown
will increase total costs 7.4 per
cent to $19,380; Dartmouth will
boost costs 6.2 percent to $19,335;
and Princeton's costs will rise 6.9
percent to $19,207.
