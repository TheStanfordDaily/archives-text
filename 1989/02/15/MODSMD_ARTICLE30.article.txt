9. What causes the
• "crack " of snapping a
towel ?
A. This sound most often
• heard in the vicinity of
mischievous people in locker
rooms is a sonic shock that
is the result of a portion of
the the towel traveling
faster than the speed of
sound, according to Physics
Prof. Mason Yearian, direc
tor of the High Energy
Physics Lab.
When a soggy towel is
whipped at someone, it
causes a wave of energy to
travel to the tip. Towels
used in this manner func
tion similarly to bull whips.
As the wave moves down
a whip, it becomes amplified
because the whip tapers at
the end, Physics Prof.
Robert Wagoner said.
The decrease in the
diameter towards the end of
a bull whip is designed to

take advantage of the conserva
tion of energy. In order to con
serve the orginal energy given to
it when whipped, the velocity of
the wave increases as the mass
of the whip decreases towards the
tip.
When the wave reaches the end
of a towel it causes the tip to
whip out faster than the speed 01
sound, producing a shock wave,
Yearian said. This shock wave is
similar to the sonic boom of a
supersonic jet and to the sonic
shock from a bullet fired from a

gun.
Since air molecules can only re
spond at a certain speed depend
ing on air temperature and at
mospheric pressure, the super
sonic speed of the tip of the whip
forces the molecules of air to
crowd up on each other. An in
tense and coherent sound wave is
produced by these compressed air
molecules.
