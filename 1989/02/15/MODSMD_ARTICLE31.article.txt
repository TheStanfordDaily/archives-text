## Physicist looking for the heart of 'dark matter' Valentine physics: search for an exotic particle 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
When Stanford Physics Prof.
Bias Cabrera walked into his lab
oratory seven years ago yesterday,
he got the best St. Valentine's
Day present of his life.
On a quiet Sunday afternoon,
Cabrera found something in the
lab he wasn't expecting: A single
jump on his strip-chart recorder
signaled that a small piece of mar
velous physics might have just
passed through his laboratory.
Cabrera was on the hunt for
one of the Holy Grails of physics,
a particle known as the magnetic
monopole. A magnetic monopole,
or just monopole for short, is a
charge associated with the mag
netic force, in the same way as
the electron is a charge associated
with the electric force.
The implications of the possible
find were tremendous. Some
physicists hoped the monopole
might be the so-called "dark mat
ter," the mass of the universe ob
served to pull on objects, but that
astronomers can't see in their
telescopes.
The monopole is a crucial part
of the grand unification theories
that particle physicists have been
playing with since the 19705, and
its existence — or non-existence
— would tell physicists a great
deal about the accuracy of their
theories.
The cautious scientist
Despite the promising signal he
had observed, Cabrera played the
role of a cautious scientist. He
banged his equipment with a ham
mer to see if a mechanical disrup
tion might have mimicked the sig
ned a monopole would produce.
Cabrera even checked to see if an
earthquake had occurred that day.
Although knocking the equip
ment did produce signals, none of
them looked anything like the one
he had observed.
Although the apparatus was

just a prototype, and therefore did
not have any backup apparatus
that might be able to rule out
spurious signals, the discovery
matched theory in every respect.
Even the length of time he
searched seemed right. "The num
ber 151 was about the expected
number of days to match with
theory for a particle of this mass,"
Cabrera said in a recent interview.
Things almost couldn't have
looked better for Cabrera.
Eager physicists
Cabrera's possible find was, to
say the least, a big event in
physics. Within a short time, word
of his experiment had spread from
Stanford to UC-Berkeley and then
on to the rest of the world. At
this point, Cabrera couldn't stop
the rumor mill — the word was
out.
Two months after the Valen
tine's Day event, Cabrera spoke
to eager physicists at several lo
cations around the country.
"It was a tremendous experi
ence for me scientifically, because
there was no sector of physics
that was not somehow involved
in this question," Cabrera said.
"I found it fascinating that, in
fact, whenever I gave talks to
physicists, there was quite a lot
cf enthusiasm and excitement, and
I was learning an immense
amount about other areas of
physics."
Cabrera warned other
physicists that this might not be
the sought-after monopole, that
it might just be a false signal.
Nobody denied, though, that the
signal looked awfully good.
One of the physicists who heard
early on about the monopole was
Harvard University's Sheldon
Glashow. Glashow, a Nobel
laureate and preeminent theorist,
said he was very excited by the
event.
"It would have been an abso
lutely spectacular discovery,"
recalled Glashow. But Glashow
was looking, like other physicists,

for confirmation of Cabrera's lone
find.
A year later, Glashow — known
for his charm with wordplay —
sent a St. Valentine's Day
telegram to Cabrera. It read:
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
The time has come,
For monopole two.
But Cabrera has not been lucky
enough to find another one since.
'Monopole! Head all about it!'
From the scientific circles, the
discovery spread quickly to the
media. Walter Sullivan of The
New York Times, who often wrote
about particle physics, heard ex
cited talk about the find in sci
entific circles and broke the story
to the public. Soon after, Cabrera
was flooded by calls.
He kept his cautious air. To

Cabrera, this was still just a
"single candidate event," as he
was to refer to it in a May 1982
paper published in Physical
Review Letters, the prestigious
physics journal.
Although science publications
reported the find fairly accurately,
many other newspapers were "all
over the place" and "off-based,"
according to Cabrera. His care to
emphasize with the press that this
was a completely unconfirmed
find did not stop his hometown
paper to declare he was sure to
win the Nobel prize.
Growing skepticism
Although physicists still had a
strong interest in Cabrera's St.
Valentine's Day event, skepticism
about the find was growing. Add-
