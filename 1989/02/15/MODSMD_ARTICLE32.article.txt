# Cabrera's monopoles became relics a short time after the Big Bang

They are pre-historic, slow
moving and massive. No, they
are not dinosaurs. They are
elusive particles called magnetic
monopoles, and as relics from
the time of the Big Bang they
may compose at least 80 percent
of our universe.
The considerable attention
awarded these exotic particles
by both physicists and the press
is amply deserved.
Many of the great theories of
particle physics, the so-called
grand unification theories or
GUTs, hinge on the existence
of the monopole. Thus when ex
periments aimed at finding the
particle repeatedly failed in the

19705, astrophysicists felt the
heat.
The GUTs of physics
Despite physicists' affinity for
complicated equations, theorists
often exhibit an overwhelming
attachment to the belief in an
ultimately simple world, ex
plained by a very few number
of laws and equations. GUTs
grew out of this desire for
simplicity.
Using elegant but very com
plicated mathematics, the grand
unification theorists simplify
the myriad of particles found in
the universe by unifying three
of the four fundamental forces
of nature, the electromagnetic
force and the strong and weak
nuclear force into one theory.
When GUT theorists calculate

what happened in the universe
just a short while after the Big
Bang, their equations suggest
the creation of extremely heavy
magnetic monopoles.
The GUTs predict that the
mass of the monopole is fully
10,000 trillion times the mass
of the proton, one of the basic
constituents of all matter. If the
proton were the mass of the
earth, the monopole would be
the mass of 30 billion suns.
Monopoles and darK matter
Joining particle physicists in
their captivation with the
monopole hunt, astrophysicists
think they are missing some
thing. In fact, they think they
are missing a lot of something.
