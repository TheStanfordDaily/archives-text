# Cabrera's monopoles became relics a short time after the Big Bang

### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
They are pre-historic, slow
moving and massive. No, they
are not dinosaurs. They are
elusive particles called magnetic
monopoles, and as relics from
the time of the Big Bang they
may compose at least 80 percent
of our universe.
The considerable attention
awarded these exotic particles
by both physicists and the press
is amply deserved.
Many of the great theories of
particle physics, the so-called
grand unification theories or
GUTs, hinge on the existence
of the monopole. Thus when ex
periments aimed at finding the
particle repeatedly failed in the

19705, astrophysicists felt the
heat.
The GUTs of physics
Despite physicists' affinity for
complicated equations, theorists
often exhibit an overwhelming
attachment to the belief in an
ultimately simple world, ex
plained by a very few number
of laws and equations. GUTs
grew out of this desire for
simplicity.
Using elegant but very com
plicated mathematics, the grand
unification theorists simplify
the myriad of particles found in
the universe by unifying three
of the four fundamental forces
of nature, the electromagnetic
force and the strong and weak
nuclear force into one theory.
When GUT theorists calculate

what happened in the universe
just a short while after the Big
Bang, their equations suggest
the creation of extremely heavy
magnetic monopoles.
The GUTs predict that the
mass of the monopole is fully
10,000 trillion times the mass
of the proton, one of the basic
constituents of all matter. If the
proton were the mass of the
earth, the monopole would be
the mass of 30 billion suns.

their captivation with the
monopole hunt, astrophysicists

thing. In fact, they think they
are missing a lot of something.
that the mass density of the uni
verse should be dominated by
monopoles by something like 14
orders of magnitude. It's totally
out of what is observationally pos
sible."
Inflationary universe
To got around this dilemma,
two theorists independently pro
posed what has come to be known
as the inflationary universe
model. The two predicted that the
universe has not always expanded
at the same rate. For a period of
time shortly after the Big Bang,
the universe expanded exponen
tially, they argue, diluting matter
throughout all space.
After the exponential expan
sion, the energy of matter's mo
tion is converted into the energy
of lighter-weight particles found
in abundance in today's universe,
such as protons, electrons and
neutrons.
The much heavier monopoles
were left diluted as mere relics in
the new universe.
Early work on the monopole
Decades before the GUTs were
introduced, British physicist Paul

Dirac theorized in the 1930s that
monopoles would be a fortuitous
addition to the deciphering of the
universe.
Dirac used the tools of quantum
mechanics that had revolutionized
physics in the first half of the
century to prove his theory. He
showed that the existence of mag
netic charges dictates the exis
tence of electric charges in
discrete amounts, as found in na
ture.
This earlv rcali7ation spurred
interest in the monopole, and be
cause of Dirac's work, experimen
talists knew what size charge they
were looking for.
One of the brilliant successes
of the GUTs was to predict this
same charge applies to the
monopole as well, even though the
theoretical framework of the
GUTs looks very different from
that of quantum mechanics, which
Dirac used.
GUT theorists realized that
monopoles would have to be mas
sive, and that these particles
would move very slowly through
the universe.
Furthermore, theorists showed
that monopoles can only weakly
interact with other matter. So
weak is this interaction, that a
monopole could pass through the
earth with energy loss of only one
tenth of 1 percent.

monopoles would have to be mas
sive, and that these particles
would move very slowly through
the universe.
Furthermore, theorists showed
that monopoles can only weakly
interact with other matter. So
weak is this interaction, that a
monopole could pass through the
earth with energy loss of only one
tenth of 1 percent.
