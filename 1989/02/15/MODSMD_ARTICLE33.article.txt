# Scientists working to develop better test for the AIDS virus
## 
### Jill Mathews 
Everywhere we turn we seem to hear
the term "AIDS testing." Like the disease
itself, ignorance about the tests abounds.
Although misleading test results some
times occur, current tests for the disease
are very accurate compared to other med
ical diagnostic tests.
For example, consecutive tests for
cholesterol can vary a significant amount.
Doctors should repeat the test before
making concrete statements about a pa
tient's cholesterol level.
New tests
Scientists, spurred by the public's
desire for a safer blood supply, are now
developing a number of AIDS tests that
show some promise for being even more
effective than the ones presently used.
One good prospect is a test called the
polymerase chain reaction test, which
tests directly for the presence of the
human immunodeficiency virus. The
PCR test uses a probe of DNA, the genetic
material, to locate the viral DNA.
Commonly-used tests don't actually
look for HIV, but look for antibodies to
the virus. Antibodies are the body's de-

sensitive, and it is used
commonly for both
clinical diagnosis and
for screening the na

fense against all infections.
Tests for HIV in some ways have tre
mendous advantages over antibody tests,
according to Ellen Daniels, a PCR
spokesperson at Cetus Corp., the com
pany which developed the test.
Testing newborns
For example, the PCR test will differ
entiate between newborn babies with and
without HIV infection. Sometimes, infec
ted mothers pass on the antibodies to
the developing fetus, but the virus
doesn't always get transferred, Daniels
said.
Thus, the baby will test positive for
standard tests looking for antibodies, but

will never develop AIDS. Since PCR looks
for the virus, newborns with just the
antibodies will not be diagnosed incor
rectly.
Daniels said the test might be available
in the future in a kit for doctors.
Another such promising test uses "gel
beads" which are coated with HIV. The
test takes only five minutes and is com
monly used in Europe and Japan. Re
cently approved by the Food and Drug
Administration, it will probably come into
wider use in the United States soon.
To date, the FDA has approved only
tests which detect antibodies to HIV —
not HIV itself — for use in clinical diag
nosis.
Currently, the most widely used diag
nostic tests for human immunodeficiency
virus are what are known as the enzyme
linked immunoassay, called ELISA, and
the Western blot. Cowell Student Health
Center uses these tests.
Sensitivity vs. specificity
The presently-used tests are considered
very accurate by health experts. The
utility of these tests, and others, is mea
sured by sensitivity and specificity.
Sensitivity refers to the rate at which
the test correctly detects infected indi-

fection by the AIDS
virus.

viduals. A test with high sensitivity picks
up a high percentage of the infected in
dividuals, but may also have a large num
ber of false positives.
The specificity of a test refers to its
ability to detect those who are not infec
ted. A test with high specificity can detect
the true negatives from the excess of
false positives, but may miss some of
those who are infected.
In some ways, these two factors are
the big tradeoff. A high sensitivity is
perfectly compatible with a low
specificity, but a test needs to be high
in both of these characteristics to make
it a valid test on its own.
For example, a test with perfect sen

sitivity to AIDS might be one that meas
ures the heart beat of an individual,
because surely doctors will only care
about HIV infection in living people.
However, this hypothetical AIDS test
has low specificity because there is no
way to catch only those who have the
HIV infection. Every living person will
test positive to this poorly-designed test.
Testing groups
The prevalence, or the percentage of
people in a population who have the dis
ease, is also important. For example, test
ing a low prevalence population is unwise
because many more people than are ac
tually infected will test positive.
The ELISA test is very sensitive, and
it is used commonly for both clinical diag
nosis and for screening the nation's blood
supply. The Western blot test, which is
much more specific than the ELISA, is
typically used to confirm the ELISA's
positive results.
If the ELISA test at Cowell is positive,
the sample is retested. If the second test
is also positive, the Western blot test is
performed. The Western blot test weeds
out false positives from the ELISA test.
