# Experts say 'morning-after pill' is needed

Morning-after emergencies happen to
almost everyone, and it is natural to
have a heart-sinking, panicky feeling
the next morning when you think about
the possibility of unwanted pregnancy.
— "Understanding your Body," Felicia
Stewart, et al.
"Morning-after pills" should be more
readily available to women in the United
States, according to leading birth control
experts.
Morning-after pills, and other meth
ods of birth control after sexual inter
course, have been used to avoid
unwanted pregnancies in women who
experience unprotected sexual inter
course.

U.S. physicians have prescribed these
post-intercourse methods of birth con
trol for at least the past eight years,
according to Dr. Robert Hatcher from
the Emory University School of
Medicine in Atlanta, Ga.
Birth control experts at a conference
last weekend in San Francisco over
whelmingly agreed that morning-after
birth control is a necessary option for
women who experience unprotected in

tercourse.
According to Felicia Guest, a birth
control expert also from Emory Univer
sity, "our birth control technology is
imperfect, and human behavior is im
perfect."
"As long as condoms break, women
are raped, diaphragms and cervical caps
are dislodged, intrauterine devices are
expelled and pills are lost or forgotten,
we will need morning-after birth con
trol," Guest writes in the book "Con
traceptive Technology."
Guest said at the weekend conference
that increased availability and use of
the morning-after pill is a means of
reducing the number of surgical abor
tions.
Birth control after sexual intercourse,
such as use of the morning-after pill,
is currently a delicate political issue.
Some people, particularly leaders of the
right-to-life movement, view this form
of contraception as abortion of the fer
tilized egg.
Proponents of the morning-after pill
say that this method for post
intercourse birth control should be
reserved for emergency situations only.
The morning-after pill was criticized
because the pills previously used con
tained high doses of estrogen which
were associated with health risk. The
current pills, however, are regular birth
control pills with very low doses of
estrogen, experts say.
This pill, called Ovral, has a lower
failure rate than the higher-dose
estrogen pills and causes far fewer side
effects. Experts at the San Francisco
conference concluded that Ovral is safe

and effective in preventing a uterine
pregnancy and should therefore be more*
widely available.
Cowell doctors have come under fire
recently because they sometimes
prescribe Ovral as a morning-after pill.
The Food and Drug Administration
has not approved Ovral specifically for
use as a morning-after pill, but does
not prohibit using a drug for purposes
other than those approved.
Once a drug has received FDA ap
proval for a specific medical use, phy
sicians may vary the dosage of the drug
or prescribe the drug for any purpose.
Other methods of post-intercourse
birth control are lUD insertion, which
is not frequently used, and the pill RU
486, which is not available in the United
States.
An lUD inserted after intercourse can
prevent a fertilized egg from implantat
ing in the wall of the uterus. The RU
486 pill can be taken up to six weeks
after conception, and also prevents im
plantation of the fertilized egg.
In fact, RU 486 — although believed •
by experts to be a very safe and effective
alternative to surgical abortion — has
not been marketed in the United States
because of intense pressure from the
right-to-life movement.
