## Card nine prepares to battle No. 12 Fresno St. Junior infielder Griffin adjusting well to position at hot corner 
### Bruce Sarkisian Senior staff writer 
When third baseman Ed
Sprague graduated last year, he
left some pretty big shoes to fill
at the hot corner. But his replace
ment Tim Griffin is doing rather
well, thank you very much.
In the early season, the junior
has provided much of the pop in
the sometimes dormant Stanford
bats. Through 11 games, Griffin
is batting .362 and is tied for third
on the team with seven RBI. He

also has one of the squad's five
home runs.
Ironically, one of the team's
leading players was not a hotly
pursued athlete out of high school.
"I was not a highly recruited ath
lete, but I liked absolutely every
thing about Stanford. Something
special happens when you put on
that Stanford uniform.
"The team is always finishing
in the top 20, and it's nice to
know you're part of a team like
that. It was a big step up from
high school ball," Griffin said.

Griffin played on the junior var
sity squad his first year and
battled injuries that season. Last
year, however, Griffin broke into
the starting lineup and was
mostly used as a designated hit
ter, starting 35 games in the latter
half of the season.
"When I came back my sopho
more year I was more comforta
ble, and I knew what was expected
of me," Griffin said, adding that
the coaches did not expect much
from him, which relaxed him at
the plate in a year when he hit

.345.
Most Stanford fans are familiar
with the chatter that comes from
the field players and the sidelines
during a game and the way in
which they sprint to and from the
dugout between innings. While
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess'
system took some getting used to,
Griffin mentioned that the hustle
and chatter that Marquess favors
helps keep players in the game.
"IMarquess'J job' is to make us
give 100 percent all the time. At
first, his system of discipline
shocked me. But that discipline is
good, it makes us stand out from
other teams."
Griffin has had to fight for his
job with freshman Roger Burnett.
When one plays third, the other
is in the designated hitter spot,
but Griffin has been getting the
nod in the field much more fre
quently.
"I don't think I have a lock on
it, (Marquess) is just trying to
find the right combination. It's
been almost two years since I
played third," said Griffin, whose
natural position is second base.
He seems to have gotten more
comfortable at third as the season
has progressed and has only com
mitted three errors. "Once I make
a couple of plays I relax a little,"
he commented.
At the plate, it's pretty hard to
improve on a season where you
hit .345, but Griffin says he made
some batting adjustments this
year. "I'm trying to drive the ball
more and get more extra-base
hits."
A question that keeps coming
up for the Cardinal this season
is whether they can replace the
power hitters lost at the end of

last season, but Griffin doesn't
think it will be a problem.
"Paul Carey can hit as many
home runs as Sprague, and there's
no reason we can't hit a lot of
doubles to drive in some runs."
As for his personal goals, Grif
fin hopes to hit over .300 and
have "a good amount of RBI. I
proved myself last year and hope
to take it up another step. If you
don't improve every year what
good is it?"
In assessing the Cardinal's next
opponent, Griffin feels that
Fresno State's 1-4 record belies
their potential. "They're better
than their record, I can tell you
that. [Bulldog center fielder Tom]
Goodwin is incredibly fast. We
have to keep him off the
basepaths like we did last year,"
he said.

Card notes
After 10 games last year, the Car
dinal was 5-5 before putting together
a nine game winning streak including
a sweep of UC-Santa Barbara, Stan
ford's next opponent after Fresno
State.
Cardinal second baseman Frank
Carey ended last season hitting .415
over the last 19 games. This year he
is batting .429 through 11 games.
Stanford pitching is striking out
four times more hatters than it walks.
The top three relievers Steve Chitrcn,
Scott Weiss and Steve Worrell have
struck out 33 and walked only six in
32% innings. •
Fresno has outhit its competition
.256 to 251 but has been outscorep
35-20 in its first five games, perhaps
because it bats only .185 with runners
in scoring position.

Most Stanford fans are familiar
with the chatter that comes from
the field players and the sidelines
during a game and the way in
which they sprint to and from the
dugout between innings. While
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess'
system took some getting used to,
Griffin mentioned that the hustle
and chatter that Marquess favors
helps keep players in the game.
"IMarquess'J job' is to make us
give 100 percent all the time. At
first, his system of discipline
shocked me. But that discipline is
good, it makes us stand out from
other teams."
Griffin has had to fight for his
job with freshman Roger Burnett.
When one plays third, the other
is in the designated hitter spot,
but Griffin has been getting the
nod in the field much more fre
quently.
"I don't think I have a lock on
it, (Marquess) is just trying to
find the right combination. It's
been almost two years since I
played third," said Griffin, whose
natural position is second base.
He seems to have gotten more
comfortable at third as the season
has progressed and has only com
mitted three errors. "Once I make
a couple of plays I relax a little,"
he commented.
At the plate, it's pretty hard to
improve on a season where you
hit .345, but Griffin says he made
some batting adjustments this
year. "I'm trying to drive the ball
more and get more extra-base
hits."
A question that keeps coming
up for the Cardinal this season
is whether they can replace the
power hitters lost at the end of

last season, but Griffin doesn't
think it will be a problem.
"Paul Carey can hit as many
home runs as Sprague, and there's
no reason we can't hit a lot of
doubles to drive in some runs."
As for his personal goals, Grif
fin hopes to hit over .300 and
have "a good amount of RBI. I
proved myself last year and hope
to take it up another step. If you
don't improve every year what
good is it?"
In assessing the Cardinal's next
opponent, Griffin feels that
Fresno State's 1-4 record belies
their potential. "They're better
than their record, I can tell you
that. [Bulldog center fielder Tom]
Goodwin is incredibly fast. We
have to keep him off the
basepaths like we did last year,"
he said.

Card notes
After 10 games last year, the Car
dinal was 5-5 before putting together
a nine game winning streak including
a sweep of UC-Santa Barbara, Stan
ford's next opponent after Fresno
State.
Cardinal second baseman Frank
Carey ended last season hitting .415
over the last 19 games. This year he
is batting .429 through 11 games.
Stanford pitching is striking out
four times more hatters than it walks.
The top three relievers Steve Chitrcn,
Scott Weiss and Steve Worrell have
struck out 33 and walked only six in
32% innings. •
Fresno has outhit its competition
.256 to 251 but has been outscorep
35-20 in its first five games, perhaps
because it bats only .185 with runners
in scoring position.


April Pearson — Daily file
Junior third baseman Tim Griffin, who replaced former Ail-America third baseman Ed Sprague for
the Cardinal, has hit .362 this season with seven RBI and five home runs.
When third baseman Ed
Sprague graduated last year, he
left some pretty big shoes to fill
at the hot corner. But his replace
ment Tim Griffin is doing rather
well, thank you very much.
In the early season, the junior
has provided much of the pop in
the sometimes dormant Stanford
bats. Through 11 games, Griffin
is batting .362 and is tied for third
on the team with seven RBI. He

also has one of the squad's five
home runs.
Ironically, one of the team's
leading players was not a hotly
pursued athlete out of high school.
"I was not a highly recruited ath
lete, but I liked absolutely every
thing about Stanford. Something
special happens when you put on
that Stanford uniform.
"The team is always finishing
in the top 20, and it's nice to
know you're part of a team like
that. It was a big step up from
high school ball," Griffin said.

Griffin played on the junior var
sity squad his first year and
battled injuries that season. Last
year, however, Griffin broke into
the starting lineup and was
mostly used as a designated hit
ter, starting 35 games in the latter
half of the season.
"When I came back my sopho
more year I was more comforta
ble, and I knew what was expected
of me," Griffin said, adding that
the coaches did not expect much
from him, which relaxed him at
the plate in a year when he hit

.345.
