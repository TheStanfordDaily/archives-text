# Fresno State at Stanford
## 
### 
TODAY — at Sunken Diamond, 2 p.m.
RECORDS - Stanford (6-5), Fresno State (1-4).
PROBABLE STARTERS — Stanford will probably have three or four pitchers
go a few innings each. Fresno will start right hander Erik Schullstrom
(0-0, 0.75 ERA).
WHO'S HOT — Frank Carey and Paul Carey have been the Cardinal's
most consistent hitters this season. Frank is batting 429 with 5 doubles
and Paul has hit safely in all 11 games so far while notching a .415
average and 10 RBIs. First baseman David Holbrook has solidified his
spot in the starting lineup. He's batting a healthy .382 and went 2-for-3
against Cal State-Los Angeles Monday.
WHO'S NOT — While they have done a fine job defensively at the position,
catchers Eric Cox and Troy Tallman have not been hitting well. Cox
had a key hit against Fullerton State last weekend but is only batting
.125 on the season while Tallman has collected only one hit so far
BULLDOG UPDATE — Former Olympian Tom Goodwin is batting 391 so
far this season. He swiped 62 bases last season but only has two in
five games this year. Teammate Eddie Zosky is batting a healthy 409
The Bulldogs have only eight extra-base hits on the season.
KEYS TO VICTORY — After playing four games in a row and arriving from
Fullerton at 2 a.m. Monday, the Cardinal took the day off yesterday for
some well deserved rest, so the offense should not take so long to come
alive against the Bulldogs. Although Fresno State is 1-4, they played in
the College World Series last year and still have a highly regarded team.
The Stanford pitchers will have to be on top of their games to keep
Bulldog runs off the scoreboard.
