# NBA proposals are unnecessary changes to great game
## 
### 
Why mess with a good thing?
The NBA is in the midst of an
unbelievable hot streak. For the
past several years, the league has set
attendance records, made more money
than ever and begun the difficult process
of expansion without a significant hitch.
Unlike their sisters in the NFL, the
league has a collective bargaining agree
ment with the players that works. The
owners make a ton of money and the
players, already making a ton of money,
have secured the right to free agency.
The league's All-Star Weekend was a
spectacular success again — despite the
absence of Larry Bird and Magic
Johnson. Baseball's Midsummer Classic
is almost as popular, but invariably a
boring show.
Only in the NBA showcase of stars can
Isiah Thomas throw the ball off the back
board and allow Michael Jordan to magi
cally fly through the air and throw it
home.
Everything seems to be just fine for
the league and now, for some unknown
reason, they're talking about changing it.

Among the changes:
• A triangular lane, a la international
ball, to keep the ball out of the low post.
• A one-point line, maybe six feet from
the hoop, inside of which baskets would
only be worth a single point. The better
to stop the layup, my dear.
• Relaxing defensive rules to allow
"anything goes" defense.
• A wider and/or longer court. Run
and-gun gets to go further and faster.
All right, maybe the court should be
bigger. It can't really hurt anything
much.
And, yes, I wouldn't miss the "illegal

defense" rule if it goes.
The rest? No, no, a thousand times no.
There is no need to widen the lane,
nor insert a one-point line, to open the
game up and give the little guy a chance.
It's opening itself up without anyone's
help.
Height, once the be-all and end-all of
the league is no longer what its cracked
up to be.
When Kareem sits on the bench, the
Lakers take it to the opposition with a
front line that averages 6-foot-9. The Pis
tons have a seven-footer in Bill Laimbeer,
but he shoots jumpers. Their post game
is 6-6 Adrian Dantley — and he doesn't
even jump that high.
Sure, Patrick Ewing and Akeem
Olajuwon (and possibly David Robinson
next year) are classic back-to-the-basket,
seven-foot, in-your-face low post players.
And they are hurting the game?
Besides, little guys are doing just fine
thank you. Denver's Michael Adams, all
5-10 of him, is one of the top guards in
the league. Tyrone "Muggsy" Bogues of
Charlotte sees significant action despite

being a mere 5-3.
The downsizing of the league promises
to continue, as well. There are no seven
footers coming out of college this year
who have a chance in hell of starting at
center in the NBA.
As a matter of fact, outside of Dikeinbe
Mutumbo and some high school junior
in New Jersey, who's name I don't re
member, there may only be two seven
footers in the next six years who make
any impact.
Yes, I agree that Stacy King and Alonzo
Mourning will be stars in pro ball. But,
they are both 6-10 and neither plays the
classic bang-it-inside, Moses Malone-style
of basketball the rule changes are trying
to eliminate.
Finally, forcing Jordan, Clyde Drexler
and the like to take off from more than
six feet from the basket to get two points
for a dunk might make for more spec
tacular slams, but would hardly ac
complish anything significant.
I mean, why should guys need a 45-inch
vertical to slam when a 40-incher is suf-

ficient? This change would open up the
game?
In the What's New with the Men's
Basketball Team Dept.:
Moving up another notch in the
Associated Press poll proves beyond a
shadow of a doubt that people across the
country believe in the team. Combine
that with a No. 7 ranking nationally in
the Sagarin power ratings and you get
a picture of how good the team is.
Since the selection committee seeds the
teams using a similar method to the
Sagarin method, the Cardinal is in good
position to receive a seed of four or better
in one of the regions.
To those making their NCAA Tourna
ment travel plans, that news means the
Cardinal will almost definitely not be
playing in the West Region.
Attempts are made to keep conference
foes among the top 16 in the land from
meeting until the Final Four. Arizona is
the probable No. 1 seed in the West and
that means Stanford is likely to travel
elsewhere. Start packing, sports fans.
