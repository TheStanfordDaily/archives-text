## Synchro team travels to Cal 
### Libby Feil Staff writer 
Stanford's synchronized
swimming team starts off its
season quickly this Sunday
with pre-regional champion
ships at California. The team
is only planning to compete in
two meets during its season
before going on to nationals,
which will be held this year in
Florida.
According to club President
Ginny Cohn, this year's
synchro team will be "trying
to win nationals." Cohn expects
the team's main competition to
be Ohio State, which has "a
strong varsity program." Stan
ford's team is considered a club
sport, although it plays under
NCAA rules.
"We have a couple of really
good freshmen," said Cohn.
The team will be counting on
them, as well as on returning

swimmers, to lead it to victory
at the pre-regional meet this
weekend.
Hockey wins match
but misses trophy
Stanford's ice hockey team
was both victorious and
defeated last weekend in its
home game against California.
Although the team beat Cali
fornia 3-2, the Cardinal needed
to win by two goals in order
to bring home a trophy being
offered by the rink owner.
Club treasurer David
Shapiro reported that the game
went into overtime to deter
mine the trophy winner. But
"Cal scored first in overtime,"
said Shapiro, and so the trophy
eluded the Cardinal players.
That defeat was mitigated,
however, by their win over rival
California.
