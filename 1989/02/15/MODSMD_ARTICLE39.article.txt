## 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
The Stanford women's golf
team, on the rebound from a sixth
place finish at a rainy USC tour
nament a fortnight ago, is finding
Arizona weather and golf more to
their liking. The Cardinal women
were hanging tough in fourth
place yesterday for the second
consecutive day at the Domino's

Pizza/Chris Johnson Invitational
at the Randolf North Golf Course
in Tucson.
Heading into the final day of
the invite, the team is now 13
shots behind first-place Arizona
State after shooting a 306 and a
308 in the first two rounds. On
Monday, Stanford was a mere four
shots out of the lead, as the Stan
ford duo of sophomore Jodi Figley
and freshman Audrey Wooding
both carded 74s to gain a share
of fourth place in the individual
rankings.
Figley came back with a 76 yes
terday, which leaves her tied for
sixth with six other golfers.
Wooding fell slightly with a 78,
but still remains in the top 20
with a 152 total. Other Stanford
scores included Michele Lyford's
two-day total of 156 and Stepha
nie Parel's 162.
Figley and the Cardinal seem
to perennially enjoy the Arizona
tournament. Stanford finished
high in the standings last year,
and Figley had her best tourna
ment of the year, placing second
individually. Fourth place this
year would be nothing to sneeze
at, as Arizona State, Arizona, and
USC (the three teams ahead of
them currently) are all in the top
10 nationally. The Cardinal is now
ranked 17th in the country.
