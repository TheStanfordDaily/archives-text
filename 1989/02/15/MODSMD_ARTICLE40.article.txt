# Hoops road to the top 20 pitted in the early 1980s

Editor's note: This is the first of
a two-part series on the journey
of the Stanford men's basketball
program from perennial also-ran
to NCAA contender.

Nearly three years ago, Stan
ford men's basketball program ap
peared doomed.
That seems unlikely now, in the
wake of Stanford's 19-5 record,
No. 17 ranking by AP (16th by
UPI) and streak of sellout crowds
at Maples Pavilion. It would have
seemed unlikely then to those who
left campus for spring break in
1986. They had to feel good about
Cardinal hoops prospects for the
future.
• Stanford finished tied for fifth
in the Pacific 10 Conference,
where only three seasons before
it finished last.
• Stanford Coach Dr. Tom
Davis was living up to his legend
as the lighthouse of college bas
ketball — the savior of lost pro
grams.
• A couple of freshmen named
Todd Lichti and Howard Wright
had given notice that there was
room for basketball stars in Stan
ford's nighttime sky.
But when those same people
came back to campus 10 days later
and picked up the first Stanford
Daily of spring quarter, the stories
on the sports page had to have
sent them reeling.
On Mar. 31, 1986, The Daily
reported that local high-school
star Chris Munk, considered one
of the top 10 preps in the country,

had been denied admission to
Stanford. As Daily Sports Editor
Tom Senf wrote, "Munk was ex
pected to complete the turn
around of the Stanford basketball
program begun when Davis was
hired four years ago."
In tandem with that story, Senf
reported that "the future of the
Cardinal basketball program was
in doubt last night" as Davis was
deciding whether to accept an of
fer to coach at the University of
Houston.
So there it was. The man who
had started the revitalization of
Stanford basketball and the
player that was going to finish it
— one ready to leave, the other
already gone. In fact, on April 6,
Davis did leave Stanford for lowa.
To the Stanford community at
large, and to the entire Bay Area,
for that matter, the groundwork
for a sound Cardinal basketball
tradition was crumbling like we
all later feared Roble Hall might.
Yet when Stanford plays Cali
fornia Thursday night, it will be
gunning for its first pair of 20-win
seasons since the 1940-41 and
1941-42 seasons.
What rescued Stanford from
the apparent depths it had sunk
to?
After interviewing players,
coaches, and representatives from
the athletic and admissions de
partments, it appears that the
Chris Munk situation was misun
derstood by most of the media
and the Stanford community, that
it wasn't as devastating as it
seemed.
The Chris Munk saga
Munk's rejection gained such

notoriety because for over two
years, Munk (who prepped at
Riordan High School in San Fran
cisco) had been drooling over
Stanford, Stanford had been
drooling over him, and the media
had been drooling over it all.
"The reason that too much was
made of (Munk's situation) was
he was a very high-profile figure
in the Bay Area," Davis said last
week. "He was playing well; his

team was playing well. He was so
vocal about his interest in Stan
ford — he would tell the media
he wanted to go."
The media was also aware that
Stanford coaches were working
with Munk in order to prepare
him for Stanford's admissions
standards.
"It was geared toward me even
