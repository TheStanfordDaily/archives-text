# Hoops road to the top 20 pitted in the early 1980s
## 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the first of
a two-part series on the journey
of the Stanford men's basketball
program from perennial also-ran
to NCAA contender.

Nearly three years ago, Stan
ford men's basketball program ap
peared doomed.
That seems unlikely now, in the
wake of Stanford's 19-5 record,
No. 17 ranking by AP (16th by
UPI) and streak of sellout crowds
at Maples Pavilion. It would have
seemed unlikely then to those who
left campus for spring break in
1986. They had to feel good about
Cardinal hoops prospects for the
future.
• Stanford finished tied for fifth
in the Pacific 10 Conference,
where only three seasons before
it finished last.
• Stanford Coach Dr. Tom
Davis was living up to his legend
as the lighthouse of college bas
ketball — the savior of lost pro
grams.
• A couple of freshmen named
Todd Lichti and Howard Wright
had given notice that there was
room for basketball stars in Stan
ford's nighttime sky.
But when those same people
came back to campus 10 days later
and picked up the first Stanford
Daily of spring quarter, the stories
on the sports page had to have
sent them reeling.
On Mar. 31, 1986, The Daily
reported that local high-school
star Chris Munk, considered one
of the top 10 preps in the country,

had been denied admission to
Stanford. As Daily Sports Editor
Tom Senf wrote, "Munk was ex
pected to complete the turn
around of the Stanford basketball
program begun when Davis was
hired four years ago."
In tandem with that story, Senf
reported that "the future of the
Cardinal basketball program was
in doubt last night" as Davis was
deciding whether to accept an of
fer to coach at the University of
Houston.
So there it was. The man who
had started the revitalization of
Stanford basketball and the
player that was going to finish it
— one ready to leave, the other
already gone. In fact, on April 6,
Davis did leave Stanford for lowa.
To the Stanford community at
large, and to the entire Bay Area,
for that matter, the groundwork
for a sound Cardinal basketball
tradition was crumbling like we
all later feared Roble Hall might.
Yet when Stanford plays Cali
fornia Thursday night, it will be
gunning for its first pair of 20-win
seasons since the 1940-41 and
1941-42 seasons.
What rescued Stanford from
the apparent depths it had sunk
to?
After interviewing players,
coaches, and representatives from
the athletic and admissions de
partments, it appears that the
Chris Munk situation was misun
derstood by most of the media
and the Stanford community, that
it wasn't as devastating as it
seemed.
The Chris Munk saga
Munk's rejection gained such

notoriety because for over two
years, Munk (who prepped at
Riordan High School in San Fran
cisco) had been drooling over
Stanford, Stanford had been
drooling over him, and the media
had been drooling over it all.
"The reason that too much was
made of (Munk's situation) was
he was a very high-profile figure
in the Bay Area," Davis said last
week. "He was playing well; his

team was playing well. He was so
vocal about his interest in Stan
ford — he would tell the media
he wanted to go."
The media was also aware that
Stanford coaches were working
with Munk in order to prepare
him for Stanford's admissions
standards.
"It was geared toward me even

tually making the admissions re
quirements," Munk said yester
day."I completed the right core
classes, did everything according
to plan, if you want to say that."
Davis said that Munk's case was
not unusual.
"There might be a half-dozen
that you might be working on for
several years, trying to prepare
them for what's expected," Davis
said.
But Munk was the only one the
media cared about.
The problem for Munk was that
although Stanford coaches can
sign students to letters of intent
in November, coaches cannot seal
and deliver them without approval
by the admissions committee later
on in the academic year.
Even though Munk said that it
was explained to him that admis
sion to Stanford "wasn't going to
be easy by any means," his aca
demic progress was such that he
turned his back on schools the
caliber of Georgetown, Villanova
and North Carolina.
On Mar. 21, 1986, Munk was
offically denied admission to Stan
ford.
"I was just heartbroken, to put
it straight," Munk said.
He wasn't the only one. After
all the notoriety about Munk's
efforts both on and off the court,
it appeared that Stanford's admis
sions committee was not going to
allow Stanford to get the players
it wanted.
"The Chris Munk incident in
particular was frustrating," said
Wright, now a senior. "I knew
him. He was a nice guy, a good
kid. He was willing to work as
hard as anyone here, not just in
basketball, but to get a diploma.
It's just one of those situations
where nobody wins."

So there It was. The
man who had started
the revitalization of
Stanford basketball
and the player that
was going to finish it
— one ready to leave,
the other already
gone.

sions Jean Fetter certainly didn't
feel like a winner. The final de
cision on Munk rested with her.
"I guess you could say it was
a case where the coach hoped it
would go one way, and I didn't
see it that way," said Fetter. "Un
fortunately for Chris Munk [the
decision] was made in a very
public way.
"I took a lot of flak," Fetter
went on, "but that comes with
the territory. . . . We're supporters
and cheerers-on too, so it makes
it doubly difficult."
Munk's story does not end un
happily. He ended up enrolling at
USC, where the 6-foot-9, 225-
pound center is averaging 5.6
points per game and is 10th in
the Pac-10 in rebounding at 6.6
per game. His 17 rebounds
against U.S. International Dec. 5
are unmatched this year in the
Pac-10.
"USC speaks for itself," Munk
said. "There's a lot of tradition
down here. It's a great second
opportunity. Stanford was of
course my first school, but hey,
life goes on."
When Munk was declared
academically ineligible for six
games last season, many thought
this vindicated Fetter's decision.
However, his ineligibility was only
because of a technicality — once
the problem was discovered, his
eligibility was immediately
reinstated.
In fact, no one connected with

Stanford basketball has ever felt
Fetter's decision ever needed vin
dication.
"Admissions does a great job,"
Davis said. "It was handled very,
very well. You don't always like
the decisions . . . you just recog
nize that it's just part of the in
stitution and what makes it
great."
Still, less than three weeks after
the Munk denial, Davis left Stan
ford for lowa.
Davis' departure
"It was never a cause-and-effect
thing," Davis said. "There are a
lot of things going into the deci
sion; that was not one of them "
Davis added he didn't know
whether he would have left had
Munk been accepted, but appar
ently, that's beside the point. Ac
cording to Stanford Athletic Di
rector Andy Geiger, Davis was al
ready thinking of greener pas
tures than the Farm long before
Munk wasn't admitted.
"Tom was casting about for
other opportunities and Chris'
case was a simultaneous con
venient phenomenon," Geiger
said. "It wasn't getting better fast
enough for Tom."
Wright agreed. "Davis had
reservations about continuing as
coach," Wright said. "I have the
feeling that in the middle of my
freshman year, Davis wasn't
looking for a way out, (but) was
looking for a way to broaden his
horizons. He was tired of being
called a Cinderella coach. ... He
wanted to take over a top-10 pro
gram and see if he could get it
to No. 1."
lowa hasn't made it to the Final
Four yet, but the Davis-led Haw
keyes are currently ranked 15th
in the country. Stanford, now
coached by Mike Montgomery, is
now ranked 17th.
No one would have believed it
three years ago.
