# Mortenson leads swim team
## 
### Elaine Riggs Staff writer 
Tall, blond Jay Mortenson
stretches out comfortably in a
chair. The senior swimmer is sit
ting in the coach's office with the
steaming waters of deGuerre Pool
behind him.
Mortenson pushes up the
sleeves of his "Avis swimming
championships" sweatshirt and
amiably reminds you that this
place can be quite chilly in the
early morning hours.
"I'm not sure why all the pools
here are outdoors. It's 40 to 45
degrees out here at 6:30 a.m.!"
Mortenson smiles.
Listen up, folks. You just heard
Mortenson make a slight criticism
of Stanford — and you won't hear
him do it again.
Mortenson has a few good
reasons to like this place. Two
NCAA championships. A gold
medal at the Seoul Olympics in
the 400-meter medley relay. Two
NCAA titles last year for the 100-
yard butterfly and the 100-yard
backstroke.
He is still the American record
holder in the 100 back.
Mortenson knows he's come a
long way from his first days on
the Cardinal squad when he was
awed by such famed names as
Pablo Morales and Anthony
Mosse.
"They had a big part in my

improvement," Mortenson says,
remembering the advice and en
couragment those older team
mates gave him.
Coach Skip Kenney feels grate
ful for the older teammates' help,
too.
"When he came here as a fresh
man his turns were maybe the
worst I'd seen on a good athlete,"
Kenney remembers.
"During workout once [as a
freshman], Jay said 'Can I get
out and watch because there are
so many great athletes here to
learn from,' " Kenney says.
"I watched him watch. He just
picked up things so quickly," Ken
ney say 8.
The young freshman found the
Cardinal regime tougher than his
high school workouts in home
town Madison, Wise.
"I'm kind of a late bloomer,"
Mortenson explains, "because
Wisconsin is not exactly the mecca
of swimming."
"He does work hard, but be
cause of his background he can't
put in a lot of intense training,"
Kenney says.
Not a lot of intense training?
How did Mortenson become such
a superstar in swimming? Kenney
thinks Mortenson could still be
better.
"The layman would wonder how
much better he can be," Kenney
says.
The coach pauses.

"I think Jay could be as good
as he can dream about."
Mortenson lives in the fast lane
— literally. If you don't see him
swimming fast, you may catch
him speeding in his dark grey
Saab with license plates bearing
his nickname "Morte."
And Mortenson, whose best
events are quick, sprint-oriented
ones, wants to be a race car driver
someday.
"My dream career would be to
finish Stanford and to jump into
a race car," Mortenson grins.
He subscribes to three race car
magazines. He loves the subject.
He hasn't taken any lessons yet,
but it doesn't look hard.
"Competition is competition,"
Mortenson shrugs. He figures he
could learn it.
The more practical side of Mor
tenson aims at financial success.
"I'd love to work with my dad,"
Mortenson says.
He glances at you through his
glasses to make sure you heard
that right.
"I said with my dad, not for my
dad."
You wouldn't be risking an un
derstatement if you said that Mor
tenson seems pretty confident.
"I think sometimes people con
fuse my confidence with ego," he
says, sitting with his arms
crossed, "which is pretty under
standable if they don't know me
really well."

Mortenson hasn't been too
quiet about his hopes to become
a successful entrepreneur, and his
teammates kid him about it con
stantly.
"Hey, most of us want to make
money," Mortenson says.
"I'm just more blatant about
it,"he smiles.
Around the pool, Mortenson's
role as co-captain of this year's
team is pretty clear. He is the
experienced one, the senior who
can offer advice to the newcomers.
"I have been through just about
every situation those guys can be
in," Mortenson says, ticking off

situations such as an untimely
midterm or a reprimand from
Kenney.
Mortenson feels he has a lot to
offer the team.
Yet he has to spend most of his
time waiting by the sidelines while
the Cardinal squad battles it out
in dual meets. Mortenson's best
events, the 100 fly and the 100
back, are not offered in regular
men's season competition.
While he can contribute in other
events, Mortenson has to wait for
the NCAA competition at the end
of the season for his chance to
shine.

"It's real tough to have him
wait till the end of the season to
unleash his dynamic power," Ken
ney says.
"Then he fires everybody else
up. For Jay, that can only happen
in the NCAA's."
Mortenson looks forward to an
other team championship at the
NCAA's in his final year.
"I think this team has the abil
ity and chemistry to do it,"he
says. "We're not going to be the
favorites, but stranger things
have happened."

He hasn't taken any lessons yet,
but it doesn't look hard.
"Competition is competition,"
Mortenson shrugs. He figures he
could learn it.
The more practical side of Mor
tenson aims at financial success.
"I'd love to work with my dad,"
Mortenson says.
He glances at you through his
glasses to make sure you heard
that right.
"I said with my dad, not for my
dad."
You wouldn't be risking an un
derstatement if you said that Mor
tenson seems pretty confident.
"I think sometimes people con
fuse my confidence with ego," he
says, sitting with his arms
crossed, "which is pretty under
standable if they don't know me
really well."

Mortenson hasn't been too
quiet about his hopes to become
a successful entrepreneur, and his
teammates kid him about it con
stantly.
"Hey, most of us want to make
money," Mortenson says.
"I'm just more blatant about
it,"he smiles.
Around the pool, Mortenson's
role as co-captain of this year's
team is pretty clear. He is the
experienced one, the senior who
can offer advice to the newcomers.
"I have been through just about
every situation those guys can be
in," Mortenson says, ticking off

situations such as an untimely
midterm or a reprimand from
Kenney.
Mortenson feels he has a lot to
offer the team.
Yet he has to spend most of his
time waiting by the sidelines while
the Cardinal squad battles it out
in dual meets. Mortenson's best
events, the 100 fly and the 100
back, are not offered in regular
men's season competition.
While he can contribute in other
events, Mortenson has to wait for
the NCAA competition at the end
of the season for his chance to
shine.

"It's real tough to have him
wait till the end of the season to
unleash his dynamic power," Ken
ney says.
"Then he fires everybody else
up. For Jay, that can only happen
in the NCAA's."
Mortenson looks forward to an
other team championship at the
NCAA's in his final year.
"I think this team has the abil
ity and chemistry to do it,"he
says. "We're not going to be the
favorites, but stranger things
have happened."

Stanford co-captain Jay Mortenson, who has been a member of two NCAA championships for the
Cardinal, also holds the American record in the 100-yard backstroke and an Olympic gold medal for
the 400-meter medley relay.
Tall, blond Jay Mortenson
stretches out comfortably in a
chair. The senior swimmer is sit
ting in the coach's office with the
steaming waters of deGuerre Pool
behind him.
Mortenson pushes up the
sleeves of his "Avis swimming
championships" sweatshirt and
amiably reminds you that this
place can be quite chilly in the
early morning hours.
"I'm not sure why all the pools
here are outdoors. It's 40 to 45
degrees out here at 6:30 a.m.!"
Mortenson smiles.
Listen up, folks. You just heard
Mortenson make a slight criticism
of Stanford — and you won't hear
him do it again.
Mortenson has a few good
reasons to like this place. Two
NCAA championships. A gold
medal at the Seoul Olympics in
the 400-meter medley relay. Two
NCAA titles last year for the 100-
yard butterfly and the 100-yard
backstroke.
He is still the American record
holder in the 100 back.
Mortenson knows he's come a
long way from his first days on
the Cardinal squad when he was
awed by such famed names as
Pablo Morales and Anthony
Mosse.
"They had a big part in my

improvement," Mortenson says,
remembering the advice and en
couragment those older team
mates gave him.
Coach Skip Kenney feels grate
ful for the older teammates' help,
too.
"When he came here as a fresh
man his turns were maybe the
worst I'd seen on a good athlete,"
Kenney remembers.
"During workout once [as a
freshman], Jay said 'Can I get
out and watch because there are
so many great athletes here to
learn from,' " Kenney says.
"I watched him watch. He just
picked up things so quickly," Ken
ney say 8.
The young freshman found the
Cardinal regime tougher than his
high school workouts in home
town Madison, Wise.
"I'm kind of a late bloomer,"
Mortenson explains, "because
Wisconsin is not exactly the mecca
of swimming."
"He does work hard, but be
cause of his background he can't
put in a lot of intense training,"
Kenney says.
Not a lot of intense training?
How did Mortenson become such
a superstar in swimming? Kenney
thinks Mortenson could still be
better.
"The layman would wonder how
much better he can be," Kenney
says.
The coach pauses.

"I think Jay could be as good
as he can dream about."
Mortenson lives in the fast lane
— literally. If you don't see him
swimming fast, you may catch
him speeding in his dark grey
Saab with license plates bearing
his nickname "Morte."
And Mortenson, whose best
events are quick, sprint-oriented
ones, wants to be a race car driver
someday.
"My dream career would be to
finish Stanford and to jump into
a race car," Mortenson grins.
He subscribes to three race car
magazines. He loves the subject.
He hasn't taken any lessons yet,
but it doesn't look hard.
