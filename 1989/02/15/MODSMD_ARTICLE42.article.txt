# Netters conquer helpless Spartans
## Tennis team sweeps weak San Jose State, wins 9-0 without losing any sets 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
In a stunning upset, the San
Jose State men's tennis team
downed No. 2-ranked Stanford
yesterday in a grueling, tense,
emotion-riddled match that lasted
long into the night.
Yeah, right.
The Cardinal didn't have a heck
of a lot of trouble with the Spar
tans yesterday, rolling to a 9-0
victory in a little less than three
hours. The team dropped exactly
zero sets on the way to the win.

Men's Tennis
Cardinal 9, Spartans 0

"They're not a great team,"
sophomore Dan Turbow under
stated. (Yes, he said it with a
straight face.) Turbow teamed
with Jeff Cathrall at first doubles
to down the San Jose State tan
dem of Paul Carbone and Gavin
MacMillan 6-3, 6-4.
Turbow and Cathrall had been
slated to play at second doubles
while teammates Martin Black
man and Eric Peus handled the
No. 1 spot, but Blackman was
pulled from the match because of
a stiff back. Cathrall, scheduled
to play No. 3 singles, moved up
to take Blackman's singles spot,
and the rest of the lineup followed

suit, with Barry Richards moving
into the final singles space and
the team of Peus and Richards
handling the No. 3 doubles chores.
Blackman's back is not expected
to keep him out of action long.
"I don't think it's serious," Stan
ford Coach Dick Gould said. "He
practiced (Monday) and then went
to the trainer, who said to wait
and see if it got better overnight.
When he woke up (yesterday), it
was still stiff."
Needless to say, the team had
no trouble handling the Spartans
even without Blackman. Only Jeff
Tarango encountered any kind of
resistance, finding himself down
5-2 and two breaks in the second
set before rallying to a 6-4, 7-5
win over Roberto DiGuilio in the
No. 1 singles match.
"Tarango came back really
well," Stanford Asst. Coach John
Whithnger 3aid. "That's the thing
about Jeff. When he gets down,
he kicks into another gear, and
he makes it really hard to take a
set from him."
Compared to the rest of the
singles contests, the Tarango-
DiGuilio match had all the excite
ment and drama of a Wimbledon
final. No other Stanford player
dropped more than four games in
the remaining singles matches.
Cathrall led the attack with a
6-2, 6-0 romp over Gavin MacMil-

Lan to run his season record to
2-0. Glenn Solomon and freshman
Alex O'Brien cruised to post twin
6-2, 6-2 wins at third and fourth
singles while Curtis Dunn downed
Jeff Petersen 6-1, 6-3. As for Ric
hards, he answered the call in the
final singles match quite well with
a quick 6-1, 6-1 victory over Tobi
McElravey.
"In all fairness to San Jose,
they're hurting a little bit," Gould
acknowledged. "In match like
this, you're expected to win, and
you should win."
O'Brien and Solomon handled
the second doubles spot with ease,
rolling 6-1, 6-2 over DiGuilio and
Peralto, while Peus and Richards
capped the match with a 6-3, 6-2
thumping of Petersen and McEl
ravey.
"It was a very impressive day,"
Whitlinger said. "We've gone
down to San Jose in the past and
they've given us some trouble, but
the guys really got down to busi
ness today."
Gould agreed. "You can't really
over-emphasize this as a great
win, because we did expect to
win," he said, "but it's good to
see us perform well."
The team returns to action this
weekend at the NorCal Intercol
legiate Tournament, which will be
held in San Jose Saturday
through Tuesday.
