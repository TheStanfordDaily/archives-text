# Quick returns to past home Texas
## 
### Jenna Johnson 
Editor's note: On Feb. 4 Stan
ford women's swimming Coach
Richard Quick, in his first year
on the Farm, returned to his
previous home, the University
of Texas, for a dual meet with
the Longhorns. In his six years
at Texas, Quick coached the
Longhorns to five consecutive
NCAA titles. In a special to The
Daily, Stanford senior co
captain Jenna Johnson, a three
time Olympic medalist, recounts
the team's emotional meet in
Austin with Quick.

One sunny fall afternoon,
after a week of feeling horrible
and wondering why I had to be
good at one of the only "all
year-around" sports with twice
a-day practices every day, some
thing happened that turned my
negative attitude upside down.
"Consistency," Stanford wom
en's swimming Coach Richard
Quick said to me. It was the
first word that really caught my
attention. "You're going to be
hearing me say that word a lot
in the future. Consistency in ac
ademics and athletics is the
key."
Quick got right to the point
the first day he "set boot" on
Stanford territory as the new
coach of the women's swim team
last Oct. 7.
As he entered the deGuerre
complex, I felt this unexpected
surge of excitement and an
ticipation run all through me,
and 1 had the silly urge to jump
up and down and scream and
kick my feet! I wondered just
what had gotten into me. I think
I know now.
As Coach Quick walked
around the pool in his suit and
tie toward the office that was
soon to become his second home,

I began to realize why I couldn't
seem to get the dopey grin off
my face.
Although I was scared about
the challenges that lay ahead, I
knew that the change would be
for the better.
However, 1 must admit that
when I first heard the big news
that Richard Quick from the
University of Texas was coming
to coach at Stanford, it was hard
for me to imagine.
Before, whenever I thought of
Texas, I thought of that silly
Longhorn sign they always
make with their hands and how
badly I wanted to beat them
every season. But now, all I
could think of was how dramatic
an affair Stanford's dual meet
with Texas was going to be this
year, especially since we were
going to swim against Texas in
Austin.
My premonitions were pain
fully accurate because the battle
between the Cardinal and the
Longhorns turned out to be a
tough meet in more ways than
one. Looking back on it, Quick
was not at all reluctant to admit
the difficulty of the situation.
"It was a little bit of a strange
feeling to want to beat a pro
gram that you had a lot to do
with establishing," he said.
In the team meeting that
Quick held an hour or so before
the meet, he expressed his con
cern that we "swim for our
selves" and not to feel that we
had to prove anything to
anybody.
To win the meet, he said we
had to "rock 'n' roll" from the
start and fight to win those close
races. As he explained our strat
egy, his voice cracked slightlv,
and he paused for a few seconds
to regain his composure.
I felt my own eyes burn as I
noticed a hint of moisture wel

ling up inside his. I wondered
for a moment if our new coach
was having second thoughts
about his decision to leave
Texas.
"Not for a moment have I ever
thought 'I wish I'd have stayed
at Texas,' or, 'Why did I do
this?' " Quick reassured me.
"Texas will always be a big
part of me," he added, "but no
bigger than Auburn was and
other places I've been and other
people I've had the opportunity
to work with. It's a little more
visible because we won so much
there."
Quick coached at Auburn Uni
versity for four years before he
took the coaching job at the Uni
versity of Texas. He stayed there
for six years, where he helped
lead the Longhorns to five con
secutive NCAA championships.
Even though Quick felt some
animosity and mixed feelings
coming from both his former
swimmers and old friends, he
understood that "it was very dif
ficult for those people I cared
so much about in the past to
perceive that I didn't care about
them as much at this meet and
that I did care for somebody
else who had been a terrific rival
in the past."
Under the circumstances, our
victory must have been a special
one for Quick. It sure was for
me. And, come to think of it, it
was special not just because we
won (although winning is always
nice), but, in Quick's favorite
three words, it was a successful
"total team effort."
The relieved and weary coach
summed up his feelings after
ward by saying, "I'm just grate
ful to be a part of your team."
And, I'll be surprised if every
last one of us wasn't thinking
the same thing about our coach.

Quick said to me. It was the
first word that really caught my
attention. "You're going to be
hearing me say that word a lot
in the future. Consistency in ac
ademics and athletics is the
key."
Quick got right to the point
the first day he "set boot" on
Stanford territory as the new
coach of the women's swim team
last Oct. 7.
As he entered the deGuerre
complex, I felt this unexpected
surge of excitement and an
ticipation run all through me,
and 1 had the silly urge to jump
up and down and scream and
kick my feet! I wondered just
what had gotten into me. I think
I know now.
As Coach Quick walked
around the pool in his suit and
tie toward the office that was
soon to become his second home,

I began to realize why I couldn't
seem to get the dopey grin off
my face.
Although I was scared about
the challenges that lay ahead, I
knew that the change would be
for the better.
However, 1 must admit that
when I first heard the big news
that Richard Quick from the
University of Texas was coming
to coach at Stanford, it was hard
for me to imagine.
Before, whenever I thought of
Texas, I thought of that silly
Longhorn sign they always
make with their hands and how
badly I wanted to beat them
every season. But now, all I
could think of was how dramatic
an affair Stanford's dual meet
with Texas was going to be this
year, especially since we were
going to swim against Texas in
Austin.
My premonitions were pain
fully accurate because the battle
between the Cardinal and the
Longhorns turned out to be a
tough meet in more ways than
one. Looking back on it, Quick
was not at all reluctant to admit
the difficulty of the situation.
"It was a little bit of a strange
feeling to want to beat a pro
gram that you had a lot to do
with establishing," he said.
In the team meeting that
Quick held an hour or so before
the meet, he expressed his con
cern that we "swim for our
selves" and not to feel that we
had to prove anything to
anybody.
To win the meet, he said we
had to "rock 'n' roll" from the
start and fight to win those close
races. As he explained our strat
egy, his voice cracked slightlv,
and he paused for a few seconds
to regain his composure.
I felt my own eyes burn as I
noticed a hint of moisture wel

ling up inside his. I wondered
for a moment if our new coach
was having second thoughts
about his decision to leave
Texas.
"Not for a moment have I ever
thought 'I wish I'd have stayed
at Texas,' or, 'Why did I do
this?' " Quick reassured me.
"Texas will always be a big
part of me," he added, "but no
bigger than Auburn was and
other places I've been and other
people I've had the opportunity
to work with. It's a little more
visible because we won so much
there."
Quick coached at Auburn Uni
versity for four years before he
took the coaching job at the Uni
versity of Texas. He stayed there
for six years, where he helped
lead the Longhorns to five con
secutive NCAA championships.
Even though Quick felt some
animosity and mixed feelings
coming from both his former
swimmers and old friends, he
understood that "it was very dif
ficult for those people I cared
so much about in the past to
perceive that I didn't care about
them as much at this meet and
that I did care for somebody
else who had been a terrific rival
in the past."
Under the circumstances, our
victory must have been a special
one for Quick. It sure was for
me. And, come to think of it, it
was special not just because we
won (although winning is always
nice), but, in Quick's favorite
three words, it was a successful
"total team effort."
The relieved and weary coach
summed up his feelings after
ward by saying, "I'm just grate
ful to be a part of your team."
And, I'll be surprised if every
last one of us wasn't thinking
the same thing about our coach.
Editor's note: On Feb. 4 Stan
ford women's swimming Coach
Richard Quick, in his first year
on the Farm, returned to his
previous home, the University
of Texas, for a dual meet with
the Longhorns. In his six years
at Texas, Quick coached the
Longhorns to five consecutive
NCAA titles. In a special to The
Daily, Stanford senior co
captain Jenna Johnson, a three
time Olympic medalist, recounts
the team's emotional meet in
Austin with Quick.

One sunny fall afternoon,
after a week of feeling horrible
and wondering why I had to be
good at one of the only "all
year-around" sports with twice
a-day practices every day, some
thing happened that turned my
negative attitude upside down.
