# USW wants Webb Ranch workers to be union members
## 
### Hobby Landnn Editorial staff 
More than 50 ranch workers
toiling in allegedly inadequate
working and living conditions on
the Stanford campus should be
allowed into the United Stanford
Workers, the union demanded
yesterday of University President
Donald Kennedy.
In a letter hand-delivered to
Kennedy's office, the USW gave
the University until Friday to re
spond to the demand before it
takes its case to the state.
The USW also delivered a copy
of the letter to Webb Ranch, the

workers' primary employer. The
ranch is a private farm on 250
acres of land leased from the Uni
versity, just to the west of Inter
state 280, off Alpine Road.
Showing overwhelming support
for unionization, 49 of 54 current
ranch workers have signed cards
petitioning to join the union, ac
cording to Reuben Serna, a USW
field representative and liaison to
the ranch workers.
By comparison, less than 50
percent of workers at Stanford
signed cards in support of organ
izing the USW in the 19705, ac
cording to USW steward Linda
Crouse. There are currently 1,300

members of the USW.
In the letters, the union argues
that Stanford is a joint employer
along with ranch operator Stanley
Webb. This contention is the heart
of the dispute between the Uni
versity and the USW.
According to USW attorney Jim
Eggleston, the Agricultural Labor
Relations Act states that the Uni
versity, as owner of the land, is
a legally responsible employer of
the ranch workers.
However, in recent disputes
about the ranch, the University
has firmly maintained that Webb
is the sole employer, and that
Stanford takes no responsibility

for the working or living condi
tions on the ranch.
Kennedy was unavailable for
comment on the letter, and Mi
chael Vartain, a University attor
ney who recently negotiated a con
tract with the USW, said he could
not respond to the letter because
he had not seen it as of yesterday
afternoon.
The union first took up the
cause of the Webb laborers when
the ranch began leasing their
labor to the University. There are
now four to seven Webb Ranch
workers who come to campus reg
ularly to perform groundswork,
according to ranch manager Tom

Hubbard.
After investigating the living
and working conditions at the
ranch — which Serna called "ap
palling" — the union decided to
try to incorporate the workers.
During a tour of their housing
facilities, the Webb Ranch workers
laid out their grievances to The
Daily and USW officials.
For instance, they claimed that
at times as many as six people
live in one small cubicle, although
each of them pays rent of more
than $100 a month.
Hubbard called this charge of
overcrowding "absurd," saying
that with frequent county inspec-

tion, such a violation of housing
laws would be impossible.
Webb workers and the USW
also maintain that the workers
never signed a rental or utilities
agreement with the ranch.
Additional charges include in
sufficient water and toilet facili
ties, poor heating, and lack of
proper posting of safety and
housing regulations.
Hubbard refused to respond to
these charges.
However, he did confirm that
the workers receive no sick pay,
no health insurance, no vacation
pay and no pension benefits.
