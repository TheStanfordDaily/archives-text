# AIDS misconceptions still exist

Despite increased awareness of
AIDS nationwide, campus health
workers are still faced daily with
misconceptions about the ac
quired immune deficiency
syndrome.
"AIDS has had a tremendous
impact in terms of concern, fear,
anxiety, et cetera," said Dr. John
Dorman, Cowell Student Health
Center's director of medicine. "In
terms of actual impact, in terms
of the number of people infected
on campus, it's very small."
Since February 1987, 315 Stan
ford students, faculty and staff
have been tested for antibodies to
the human immunodeficiency
virus — which causes AIDS — at
Cowell.
Cowell would not release the
number of positive test results,
but Dorman said AIDS exists at

Stanford, and that people here
have died from the virus.
The Cowell test is free and con
fidential, but not anonymous be
cause Stanford identification is
required. Although only accessible
by doctors, records of the test are
kept on file.
Other testing centers in the
area, including the Palo Alto Red
Cross and Menlo Park Planned
Parenthood, provide free HIV test
ing that is completely anonymous.
Pre-test counseling
Because of the frenzy and ig
norance often associated with
AIDS, Cowell requires that every
one who requests the test meet
with a Cowell physician for pre
test counseling.
If they are uncomfortable re
questing an appointment to dis
cuss the test, they can simply ask
for a general consultation with a

physician.
"Most of the time I don't try
to talk people out of it," said Dr.
Dorman. "I just want to make
sure that they are asking to get
the test for a valid reason."
According to Dorman, people
with valid reasons include those
who have engaged in a high-risk
practice. These behaviors may in
clude sharing needles among in
travenous drug users and having
unprotected sexual intercourse
with partners whose sexual his
tory is unknown.
Less valid reasons include fear
of the disease even though the
individual has never used in
travenous drugs, never had a
blood transfusion, nor engaged in
sexual intercourse, Dorman said.
Cowell will administer the test
for unapproved reasons for a fee.
