# AIDS misconceptions still exist
## 
### Jill Mathews 
Despite increased awareness of
AIDS nationwide, campus health
workers are still faced daily with
misconceptions about the ac
quired immune deficiency
syndrome.
"AIDS has had a tremendous
impact in terms of concern, fear,
anxiety, et cetera," said Dr. John
Dorman, Cowell Student Health
Center's director of medicine. "In
terms of actual impact, in terms
of the number of people infected
on campus, it's very small."
Since February 1987, 315 Stan
ford students, faculty and staff
have been tested for antibodies to
the human immunodeficiency
virus — which causes AIDS — at
Cowell.
Cowell would not release the
number of positive test results,
but Dorman said AIDS exists at

Stanford, and that people here
have died from the virus.
The Cowell test is free and con
fidential, but not anonymous be
cause Stanford identification is
required. Although only accessible
by doctors, records of the test are
kept on file.
Other testing centers in the
area, including the Palo Alto Red
Cross and Menlo Park Planned
Parenthood, provide free HIV test
ing that is completely anonymous.
Pre-test counseling
Because of the frenzy and ig
norance often associated with
AIDS, Cowell requires that every
one who requests the test meet
with a Cowell physician for pre
test counseling.
If they are uncomfortable re
questing an appointment to dis
cuss the test, they can simply ask
for a general consultation with a

physician.
"Most of the time I don't try
to talk people out of it," said Dr.
Dorman. "I just want to make
sure that they are asking to get
the test for a valid reason."
According to Dorman, people
with valid reasons include those
who have engaged in a high-risk
practice. These behaviors may in
clude sharing needles among in
travenous drug users and having
unprotected sexual intercourse
with partners whose sexual his
tory is unknown.
Less valid reasons include fear
of the disease even though the
individual has never used in
travenous drugs, never had a
blood transfusion, nor engaged in
sexual intercourse, Dorman said.
Cowell will administer the test
for unapproved reasons for a fee.
Consent for testing
Anyone who decides to have the test
must sign a consent form indicating they
understand the possibility of false positive
and false negative results (see accompany
ing article).
The consent form assigns the student a
code number for laboratory work. The
physician places the consent form, which
is the only evidence linking the student's
name and code number, in confidential
files.
The Cowell staff then draws the person's
blood. If this person is familiar with Cowell
staff members, the physician can draw the
blood to keep anonymity.
The blood is processed at the Palo Alto
Medical Center, and the results are re
turned in about three weeks directly to
the physician.
' When they come back, we give them
the consent form and the results of the
AIDS test, so when they leave this office,
we don't have any record that they were
tested," said Dorman.
No master list is kept of the results, so
that once the results are given out, the
doctors themselves don't know who was
tested.
Picking up results
Those tested must pick up test results
in person to discuss their significance with
the physician. Post-test counseling is re
quired for every HIV test, regardless of
whether the results are positive or nega
tive.
This method of testing replaces the con

troversial method used last spring and sum
mer, in which the test results were kept
on record in a confidential file. The students
were notified of the results over the phone,
and those with negative results received
no post-test counseling.
"Nobody (at Cowell) ever asked us about
testing" said Daniel Bao of the Stanford
AIDS Education Project. Lack of post-test
counseling for those who tested negative
was one of the meyor complaints Bao had
with the Cowell testing procedures.
Counseling is currently given to those
who test negative in order to prevent mis
conceptions, such as the belief that a nega
tive test means that the student is immune
from AIDS, or that the negative result
proves that all past behavior is safe.
A person who does not have antibodies
for the HIV is safe only if he or she has
not engaged in risky behavior during the
past six months. Antibodies to the virus
can take up to six months to appear, so
the test results can be negative even if the
virus is present.
Bao had other complaints about the test
ing procedure. Poorly worded release formfe
and factually incorrect protocols showed
that Cowell had given "no thought" to the
procedure, said Bao.
These flaws in Cowell's testing program
have been corrected, but the results of the
tests performed between February and
June of 1987 are still on file at Cowell.
Cowell urges individuals who were tested
for HIV during this time to retrieve their
records.
Anyone carrying HIV is capable of trans
mitting it to others, but will not necessarily
develop AIDS or AIDS-related complex.
AIDS-related complex — the stage preced
ing full-blown AIDS — includes a variety
of symptoms such as diarrhea, sweats and
enlargement of the lymph nodes.

kept on file.
Other testing centers in the
area, including the Palo Alto Red
Cross and Menlo Park Planned
Parenthood, provide free HIV test
ing that is completely anonymous.
Pre-test counseling
Because of the frenzy and ig
norance often associated with
AIDS, Cowell requires that every
one who requests the test meet
with a Cowell physician for pre
test counseling.
If they are uncomfortable re
questing an appointment to dis
cuss the test, they can simply ask
for a general consultation with a

physician.
"Most of the time I don't try
to talk people out of it," said Dr.
Dorman. "I just want to make
sure that they are asking to get
the test for a valid reason."
According to Dorman, people
with valid reasons include those
who have engaged in a high-risk
practice. These behaviors may in
clude sharing needles among in
travenous drug users and having
unprotected sexual intercourse
with partners whose sexual his
tory is unknown.
Less valid reasons include fear
of the disease even though the
individual has never used in
travenous drugs, never had a
blood transfusion, nor engaged in
sexual intercourse, Dorman said.
Cowell will administer the test
for unapproved reasons for a fee.
Consent for testing
Anyone who decides to have the test
must sign a consent form indicating they
understand the possibility of false positive
and false negative results (see accompany
ing article).
The consent form assigns the student a
code number for laboratory work. The
physician places the consent form, which
is the only evidence linking the student's
name and code number, in confidential
files.
The Cowell staff then draws the person's
blood. If this person is familiar with Cowell
staff members, the physician can draw the
blood to keep anonymity.
The blood is processed at the Palo Alto
Medical Center, and the results are re
turned in about three weeks directly to
the physician.
' When they come back, we give them
the consent form and the results of the
AIDS test, so when they leave this office,
we don't have any record that they were
tested," said Dorman.
No master list is kept of the results, so
that once the results are given out, the
doctors themselves don't know who was
tested.
Picking up results
Those tested must pick up test results
in person to discuss their significance with
the physician. Post-test counseling is re
quired for every HIV test, regardless of
whether the results are positive or nega
tive.
This method of testing replaces the con

troversial method used last spring and sum
mer, in which the test results were kept
on record in a confidential file. The students
were notified of the results over the phone,
and those with negative results received
no post-test counseling.
"Nobody (at Cowell) ever asked us about
testing" said Daniel Bao of the Stanford
AIDS Education Project. Lack of post-test
counseling for those who tested negative
was one of the meyor complaints Bao had
with the Cowell testing procedures.
Counseling is currently given to those
who test negative in order to prevent mis
conceptions, such as the belief that a nega
tive test means that the student is immune
from AIDS, or that the negative result
proves that all past behavior is safe.
A person who does not have antibodies
for the HIV is safe only if he or she has
not engaged in risky behavior during the
past six months. Antibodies to the virus
can take up to six months to appear, so
the test results can be negative even if the
virus is present.
Bao had other complaints about the test
ing procedure. Poorly worded release formfe
and factually incorrect protocols showed
that Cowell had given "no thought" to the
procedure, said Bao.
These flaws in Cowell's testing program
have been corrected, but the results of the
tests performed between February and
June of 1987 are still on file at Cowell.
Cowell urges individuals who were tested
for HIV during this time to retrieve their
records.
Anyone carrying HIV is capable of trans
mitting it to others, but will not necessarily
develop AIDS or AIDS-related complex.
AIDS-related complex — the stage preced
ing full-blown AIDS — includes a variety
of symptoms such as diarrhea, sweats and
enlargement of the lymph nodes.
Despite increased awareness of
AIDS nationwide, campus health
workers are still faced daily with
misconceptions about the ac
quired immune deficiency
syndrome.
"AIDS has had a tremendous
impact in terms of concern, fear,
anxiety, et cetera," said Dr. John
Dorman, Cowell Student Health
Center's director of medicine. "In
terms of actual impact, in terms
of the number of people infected
on campus, it's very small."
Since February 1987, 315 Stan
ford students, faculty and staff
have been tested for antibodies to
the human immunodeficiency
virus — which causes AIDS — at
Cowell.
Cowell would not release the
number of positive test results,
but Dorman said AIDS exists at

Stanford, and that people here
have died from the virus.
The Cowell test is free and con
fidential, but not anonymous be
cause Stanford identification is
required. Although only accessible
by doctors, records of the test are
kept on file.
Other testing centers in the
area, including the Palo Alto Red
Cross and Menlo Park Planned
Parenthood, provide free HIV test
ing that is completely anonymous.
