sible name for your residence next
year if you draw into the house
presently known as Phi Psi.
Due to pressure from local and
national fraternities, both Phi Psi
and Theta Chi residences are pres

Chip Bartlett, the resident as

the idea of a name change to res
idents at last Wednesday's house
meeting at the request of the
Stanford chapter of the Phi Psi

Fraternity, an unhoused frater

But now it just causes more con
