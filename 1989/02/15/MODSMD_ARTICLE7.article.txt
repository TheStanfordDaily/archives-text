# Old houses, new names
## 
### Susan Infantino 
"Xander-doo." This is one pos
sible name for your residence next
year if you draw into the house
presently known as Phi Psi.
Due to pressure from local and
national fraternities, both Phi Psi
and Theta Chi residences are pres
ently considering a change in
name before this year's housing
Draw.
Chip Bartlett, the resident as
sistant at Phi Psi, first introduced
the idea of a name change to res
idents at last Wednesday's house
meeting at the request of the
Stanford chapter of the Phi Psi

Fraternity, an unhoused frater
nity on campus. According to Phi
Kappa Psi Fraternity President
Alan Wolf, his organization has
been considering making the pro
posal since last year and ap
proached the house earlier this
quarter with the request.
"Originally, when the chapter
left the campus, they wanted to
save the house name in order to
maintain a presence on campus.
But now it just causes more con
fusion than good," Wolf said.
Mike Ivanitsky, IFC represen
tative for the fraternity, ex
plained, "We'd like them to
officially change the name in time
for the Draw bock to come out."
The deadline for the annual
housing draw book submissions
for row houses is Mar. 1.
According to Kendall Andrews,
a Phi Psi resident, the RA sug
gested that they should choose a
more appropriate name, one that
will hold significant meaning for
the house.
Since the meeting last week,
residents have compiled a list of
possible substitutes for the name
"Phi Psi." In addition to "Xander
doo" and other names, residents
have suggested "Psi Phi," "The
Johnson's," "Bill," and"The
Enchanted Broccoli Forest." Ken
Zimmerman, a Phi Psi Fraternity
member and Phi Psi house resi
dent, said, "It's a very light
hearted process right now. The
hardest part will be deciding a
name that everyone agrees on,
and deciding who will paint the
new letters on the house."

House reaction to the idea of a
name change is generally positive.
"(Bartlett) and other people
living here, were tired of telling
people they lived in Phi Psi and
then having to tell them it wasn't
a fraternity," Andrews said.
Theta Chi house has also been
asked to change their name. Ac
cording to Theta Chi RA Neil
Feldman, there has been a lot of
pressure from the national frater
nity, which has a trademark on
the name. The house has no cur
rent connection with the fraterni
ty-
Theta Chi residents have dis
cussed the situation at a house
meeting, but they have not yet
taken any action towards follow
ing the fraternity's request.
Diana Conklin, assistant dean
of Stu Affairs and director of
the Row, said that the name
change procedure for a row house
is relatively easy and causes no
controversy. According to a letter
released from Conklin's office in
1986 that outlines the process,
the decision should involve the
whole house, and the new name
should represent what is unique
and valuable about the house —

while remaining in good taste.
Further, the house name should
not be the name of persons living
or dead, the letter states.
After limiting choices to three
or four, the house must submit
suggestions to the Row Office,
where they are reviewed and for
warded to the associate dean of
Student Affairs. The dean makes
the final decision.
Other houses that have infor
mally discussed the option to
change their name include 353
Campus and 553 Mayfield. Both
are old fraternity houses — Zeta
Tsi and Delta Upsilon, respec
tively — converted to residences
included in the Draw. At the time
of their conversion, the houses
lost the name of the fraternity
and never received a new name.
Early in the year, both residen
ces talked about the creation of
a name, but neither has come to
a conclusion. Louis Alonso, RA at
553 Mayfield, said, "No exciting
ideas surfaced early in the
year. . . . They came up with
things like 'The Tree House.'
Maybe during spring quarter we'll
discuss it again when people's cre
ative juices are flowing."
