## Soviets leave Afghanistan « w Afghan government prepares to fight guerrillas as troops leave

TERMEZ, U.S.S.R. (AP) - The So
viet Union ended *its costly nine-year
intervention in Afghanistan yesterday
when the last soldier — the commander
of the Red Army contingent — walked
across a border bridge clutching flowers
and accompanied by his teen-age son.
"I wasn't looking back," said Lt. Gen.
Boris Gromov after leaving Afghan soil
where 15,000 Soviets died in a civil war
that still rages on.
The pullout through this border town
— where many of the 115,000 Soviet
troops had entered Afghanistan —
closed a painful chapter in Soviet his
tory that even Mikhail Gorbachev once
called a "bleeding wound."
But it did little to silence the critics
who said the Kremlin's December 1979
intervention to aid a Marxist govern
ment against the Moslem insurgency
was a mistake.
About 200 cheering, windburned sol
diers clutched automatic rifles as they
rode mud-spattered armored personnel
carriers across the Friendship Bridge
over the Amu Darya River yesterday
— the U.N.-mediated deadline for all
Soviets to be out of Afghanistan.
Gromov, the 45-year-old commander
of the Soviet contingent in Afghanistan,
rode the last armored personnel carrier
off Afghan soil.
His vehicle stopped halfway across
the bridge linking Termez with the Af
ghan town of Khairaton, and his 14-
year-old son, Maxim, ran out. He gave

The Kremlin thanked
the Soviet soldiers for
'fulfilling your patriotic
and internationalist
duty.'

his father a bouquet of carnations and
they walked arm-in-arm the final yards
to Soviet soil.
At the border, the sunburned general
appeared to be near tears when he said
his thoughts were for his countrymen
who served or died in Afghanistan.
"I thought about those who were left
behind, but most importantly about
those who have come home," said
Gromov, who took command in Afghan
istan in 1984 on his third tour of duty
there.
Lt. Col. Igor Azarenok of the Soviet
Defense Ministry said Gromov's head
quarters group was the last to leave,
and the official news agency Tass said
other troops crossed the border Wed
nesday at Kushka.
In Afghanistan, tens of thousands of
guerrillas reportedly were advancing on
the capital of Kabul and other major
cities.
Moslem guerrilla leaders in Is
lamabad, Pakistan, presented a plan for

an interim government in Afghanistan
that would be debated in the coming
days.
They would take control of their coun
try swiftly now that the Soviets are
gone. Delegates to a special council
chanted "Death to the Russians!" and
"God is great!" as their leaders declared
the Kremlin had suffered a defeat.
The Afghan government last night
thanked the Soviet Union for its assis
tance, but it also said relations between
the two should develop on the basis of
non-interference in each other's internal
affairs.
The Kremlin, in a statement carried
by Tass, thanked the Soviet soldiers for
"fulfilling your patriotic and inter
nationalist duty." But the Communist
Party daily Pravda, state-run TV and
commentators questioned whether the
Kremlin was correct in sending troops
into Afghanistan in the first place.
Some of the troops at the border cer
emony also said getting involved was a
mistake.
"It was a clear error, so many died,"
said senior Sgt. Asgat Husayinov, 22.
He said Afghanistan was "a hell after
which you fear nothing, except maybe
yourself."
The Soviets acknowledged that
15,000 of its soldiers were killed and
more than 35,000 wounded in Afghan
istan. The U.S. State Department es
timates that 1 million Afghans have
been killed.
