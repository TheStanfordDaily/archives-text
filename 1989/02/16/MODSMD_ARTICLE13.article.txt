WASHINGTON (AP) - The
State Department yesterday sig
naled its skepticism about Nica
ragua's promise to hold free elec
tions in early 1990 by saying it
has no plans to lift a four-year
ban on diplomatic contacts with
the Sandinista government.
The Nicaraguan pledge was
contained in a communique issued
Tuesday after the conclusion of a
two-day summit meeting in El
Salvador of five Central American
presidents. The Sandinistas

promised to move up presidential,
legislative and municipal elections
to February 1990 instead of hold
ing them in November of that
year.
State Department spokesman
Charles Redman was generally
noncommittal about the com
munique, which called for the
drawing up of a plan for the dis
banding of the Nicaraguan Con
tras within 90 days.
"We will be interested in con
sulting with the Central American

democracies about it," Redman
said.
He acknowledged that this
meant no consultations will be
held with Sandinista officials,
consistent with the policy estab
lished by the Reagan administra
tion in 1985 when talks with Nic
aragua were broken off.
Meanwhile, Vice President Dan
Quayle said he did not think the
communique amounted to a
"death warrant" for the Contras.
