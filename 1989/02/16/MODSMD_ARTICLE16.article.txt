Centennial funds flow
but a big tuition hike
is still on its way

WHAT'S WRONG WITH
these statements?
• In two years, Stanford's Cen
tennial Campaign has raised "the
largest amount in the history of
higher education."
— John Ford, vice president for
development.
• "Because of the seriousness of
the budget situation for 1989-
90," the University will raise tui
tion 8 percent next year, 1.5 per
cent more than expected.
— a University administration
report presented to the Board of
Trustees this Tuesday.

Notice the contradiction?
Next year's tuition hike, rais
ing the cost of an education to
$19,164, will push Stanford near,
if not at, the top of the cost spec
trum for attending college.
Stanford could be both the No.
1 school in fundraising and No.
1 in costliness.
Although the goal of the Cen
tennial Campaign is to raise
money for individual objectives,
shouldn't some of the money spill
over into fighting a ridiculous 8
percent increase?
The tuition hike is meant to
cover an $11 million projected
budget deficit. The University
has not yet lost the money, only
plans to. Surely there is some
part of the budget which could
be cut. Instead of raising tuition,
cut spending.
Read our lips: Tuition hikes
stink.
