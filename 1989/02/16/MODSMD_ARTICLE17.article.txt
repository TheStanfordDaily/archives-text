Let the students pay
— that's the solution the
University offered last
week when pressed about how
undergraduate housing projects
would be funded.
Centennial Campaign money
has not been coming in for
housing, so that source has been
ruled out.
As it now stands, University
Housing and Food Services is an
auxiliary budget, funded only by
money that it receives through
room and board fees. Using this
source, money for new housing
could only be derived through an
additional hike of room and board
rates.
A more equitable solution, in
light of the $18,000 (and soon to

be more) students pay annually,
would be the creation of a sepa
rate University fund possibly
called "The Endowment for
Building New Housing."
According to Director of Uni
versity Budgets Tim Warner, a
separate fund to subsidize new
housing construction would "not
fit the way we're currently struc
tured."
Maybe that's the point — a
new structure is needed that
would let existing housing con
tinue as a self-funded operation
with a new housing fund as a
separate objective. That would
put the University's money be
hind its spoken "commitment" to
creating four years of guaranteed
undergraduate housing.
