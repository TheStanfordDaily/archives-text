## Greed imperils our coast 
### 
Over the past few years, a powerful
coalition of careless or corrupt
state and local officials, greedy
developers and an "environmental" or
ganization that seems more out to make
a fast buck than to safeguard our natural
resources have planned a development
project which will radically alter our
unique coast.
It's a development project that a Stan
ford Law School graduate, Joey Jacobs,
and her husband, George Cattermole, a
Stanford instructor, have been fighting.
They're taking on the big boys, and so
far they're holding their own.
In the early 1980s, a huge parcel of
ranch land on the local coastline — 4,000
acre Cascade Ranch — went on the mar
ket. It's location, just off of Highway 1
near Ario Nuevo State Reserve, made it
an ideal candidate for state acquisition
for use as a park.
But the governor wanted a private cor
poration to run any future park in the
area — a "marriage of public and private"
interests, the current buzzword in envi
ronmental awareness.
Along came the Trust for Public Land.
TPL is a non-profit corporation which
buys land that the state cannot afford,
supposedly in an effort to save it from
overdevelopment. Ideally, TPL holds the
land until it can find an environmentally
conscious buyer. In this case, it appears
it did not.
TPL bought Cascade Ranch, with the
state's blessing, for an estimated $4.26
million in 1985. Two weeks later, it sold
most of Cascade Ranch to the state of
California for $5.77 million.

Wait a minute, say all the econ majors.
The cash-poor state paid TPL $1.5 mil
lion more than TPL paid for the same
land two weeks earlier? No — it's worse
than that. The State paid its $5.77 million
for Cascade Ranch minus the best 480
acres, and minus the water rights to the
entire parcel. TPL kept both. Waterless,
the state's land is worthless — and if it
becomes a park, it couldn't even have a
drinking fountain. If you pay taxes in
the state of California, pat yourself on
the back; you just helped finance one of
the worst real estate deals in history.
Having turned what looks suspiciously
like a $1.5 million profit on its deal with
the state, TPL started looking for a buyer
for the 480 prime acres, plus all the
water rights. But they did not advertise
locally. Instead, they turned to Paul L.
Gould, Inc., a Connecticut developer with
a keen taste for a sweetheart deal.
Gould paid TPL $2.1 million for the
remaining parcel and water rights. (That
makes $3.6 million in "profit" for TPL,
a "non-profit" corporation.) The under
standing was that Gould would build a
campground to facilitate park-like use of
the property which he bought with state
subsidy in both money and water.
Instead, he's planning to build a $200
a night "executive renewal" center,
specializing in hypnotherapy, biofeed
back, wellness astrology, crystal healing
and color therapy.
Gould's Environmental Impact Report
claims that there will be no significant
environmental impact from the construc
tion and use of this 800-person facility
— even though Cascade Ranch is home

to at least one and probably five endan
gered species; even though the center will
have a population bigger than that of
the largest city in the area (Pescadero);
and even though the site is archaeologi
cally sensitive.
In fact, this development seems to be
the on-shore equivalent of off-shore oil
drilling — and, unlike the oil rigs, Gould's
resort will be there forever.
As Cattermole put it, this project is an
ecological disaster.
These environmental problems have
not stopped state and county officials
from signing off on his project. Nor has
the fact that Gould's water rights are in
obvious violation of the Local Coastal
Plan. Nor has the fact that Gould has
little or no intention of using the land
for public benefit. Nor have his myriad
petty manipulations of the spirit and let
ter of local law. Why not?
But this development can be stopped.
The San Mateo County board of super
visors will have a public hearing on this
issue on Monday, Feb. 27, at the Super
visor's Chambers, County Government
Center, 401 Marshall St., Redwood City.
If you are concerned about the future of
the coastside, be there. Joey Jacobs and
George Cattermole will.
