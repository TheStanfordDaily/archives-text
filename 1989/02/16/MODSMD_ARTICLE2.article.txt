# Costs discourage Jerusalem applicants

Concerns about the high costs
and format of the recently can
celed Stanford Program in
Jerusalem apparently discouraged
the sufficient number of students
from applying, although the Uni
versity anticipated and worked to
mitigate these very obstacles.
Now both the University and
the few students who applied to
the program in Jerusalem are
trying to swallow their disappoint
ment and find alternatives to
what would have been Stanford's
only Middle East overseas center.
Only eight students applied to
study at the Jerusalem center in
its first season next fall. Director
of Overseas Studies Thomas Hel
ler said he had hoped for a min
imum of 12 applicants and was
forced to postpone the program

because of the insufficient re
sponse.
Sophomore Joe Durbin, an ap
plicant to the program, said he
was very disappointed by the
delay. He said he still plans to
study in Jerusalem next year
through a program unconnected
with Stanford.
Students cited the high cost of
the program as one deterrent that
dampened interest. Durbin said
members of the Jewish commu
nity, the "largest potential source
of students for the program," can
usually go to Israel for less money
than the Stanford program. "It's
$1,500 for Hebrew University in
stead of $7,000 for Stanford tui
tion," he said.
Heller acknowledged the high
cost of the program but said ef
forts had been made to reduce the
expense. The program was limited
to a quarter instead of a year to

control costs and allow students
to take advantage of other less
expensive programs while in Isra
el, he said.
The higher costs of the program
also were necessary to create high
quality classes and special pro
grams, Hellor said. He added that
the funds would have "made the
program distinguishable from
existing alternatives."
Another student concern about
the program was that it would
not successfully integrate students
into Israeli culture. "I'm trying
to isolate myself [from Americansl
as much as possible," said soph
omore Mike Fox, who was inter
ested but did not apply to the
program.
He added that although it was
a "great program . . . you don't
really submerge yourself in the
culture."
Heller countered that officials

had gone out of their way to create
a program that would fully inte
grate Stanford students into Is
raeli culture. He said students
would have lived in suites with
Israeli students instead of in a
dormitory with other foreign stu
dents.
Additionally, an Israeli admin
istrator was scheduled to teach a
course on immersing oneself into
Jerusalem's daily life, Heller said.
Raj Balakrishna, a junior study
ing the Middle East, said he did
not apply to the program because
the program's focus did not match
his interests. He said his study of
Arabic could be better pursued in
an area such as Cairo, instead of
Jerusalem.
Dubrin speculated that students
were also concerned about con
tinuing unrest in Israel and the
fact that the program was un
tested.
