## Now is the time to defend the Roe v. Wade decision 
### 
THE CONTROVERSY over the
views held by Dr. Louis Sullivan,
President Bush's choice for Sec
retary of the Department of Health
and Human Services, on the matter of
abortion points up a fundamental
problem in the current nationwide
debate on the issue.
The Sullivan appointment has drawn
fire because, like most Americans, his
personal position is that the Roe v.
Wade decision should not be over
turned. But as a member of an admin
istration that has pledged its support
for the anti-abortion movement, Sul
livan must subordinate his personal

view to his commitment to carrying
out the Bush administration's policy.
While his private view and his public
one may be in conflict, the imperatives
of his public role will ultimately deter
mine the position he takes.
For many of us who favor the pro
choice arguments, the problem is
slightly different, yet basically similar.
While our personal views may range
across a wide spectrum of possible
positions, we too are required at this
moment to take a public stand; even
those who would not choose abortions
for themselves may still want to sup
port the pro-choice position as an

option for others.
As an essential guarantee for
reproductive choice, Roe v. Wade can
hardly be considered a partisan issue.
It has been made a matter of public
policy. And in terms of public policy,
1989 is as critical a year in this debate
as 1973 was.
The constitutional status of Roe v.
Wade is being challenged yet again,
and the Supreme Court will make a
crucial decision this summer on the
Missouri case, which poses a serious
threat to current freedom of choice
statues.
Whatever one's personal view might

be, the necessity for affirming publicly
one's support for Roe vs. Wade has
never been greater.
In 1973, the Supreme Court based
its opinion on the constitutional right
to privacy, arguing that "the 14th
Amendment's concept of personal
liberty and restrictions upon such
action ... is broad enough to encom
pass a woman's decision whether or
not to terminate her pregnancy."
We urge you to protect that right to
privacy by affirming your position.
