# Swimsuit issue not a laughing matter
## 
### 
Although I felt the headline "This
man will die" in a Feb. 9 piece in The
Daily's Intermission section was unnec
essary, I nevertheless wish to respond
as a woman and as a student.
Stanford sophomore Jay Lopez is
quoted in Sports Illustrated as saying,
"You need pictures around here.. ..
We get a lot of crap about these pic
tures from the women." Jay Lopez
apparently does not realize the fact
that Sports Illustrated is selling women
as sexual objects. Reinforcement of the
stigma that women are objects to be
enjoyed by men endangers and harms
women because, among other things, it
encourages rape.
Lopez "needs" these pictures be
cause, "They're all feminists around
here." I take this to mean that he
doesn't "need" women who see them
selves as human beings equal to men.
I take this to mean that he "needs"
women that will satisfy him by being
his subordinate object and thereby
fulfilling his desires.

i object to his using "feminist" as a
dirty word. A feminist is a person ad
vocating women's rights based on the
idea of equality between sexes.
"But I've got nothing against wom
en. This equal rights crap — let 'em
do what they want," Lopez assures us.
I wonder if Lopez knows that the pro
posed Equal Rights Amehdment to the
Constitution states "Equality of rights
under the law shall not be denied or
abridged by the United States or by
any States on account of sex." This is
not "crap" to me. It is what I've al
ways assumed to be my right.
I wonder if swimsuit issue en
thusiasts consider how much pain
these publications cause women di
rectly and indirectly. I hope those who
ei\joy the swimsuit issue will take a
moment to imagine what it is like to
be looked upon as a satisfying object
for men.
Imagine being so afraid of walking
home alone at night that you have to
run. Imagine having to think about
parking in non-secluded areas in order
to avoid an attack. We wouldn't want
to be caught "asking for it," would we?
I'm sorry that a person educated
enough to get into Stanford cannot see

any value in women other than as
objects for his pleasure. I, too, am a
human and therefore nothing more
than equal.
