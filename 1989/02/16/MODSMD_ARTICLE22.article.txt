# Mike lost, but he accomplished much

### 
Burke Smith's Feb. 10 column enti
tled "Postmortem on a hero" was of
fensive. The columnist seemed to
delight in ridiculing the record of an
already defeated man. Mike Dukakis
did not lose the election because of the
way he governed Massachusetts.
He lost because in the face of silly
attacks about the Boston harbor and
the furlough program, he failed to
focus the election debate on such is
sues as homelessness, the AIDS
epidemic, the environment and the
trade and budget deficits, which
reached a critical point during the ten
ure of the administration of which his
opponent was vice president.
But this does not diminish his m^jor

accomplishment, which was getting the
Democratic nomination.
The minute he stepped on the
podium of the Atlanta convention to
deliver his acceptance speech, Mike
Dukakis had already secured himself a
place in the history of the United
States by being the first son of immi
grants ever to run for the presidency
of his country.
