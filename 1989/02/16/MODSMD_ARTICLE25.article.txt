## Keefe coup: Hoops success brings stars to Stanford As the program turns the corner, 'It can't be done here' is left behind 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the second of a two-part
series on the journey of the Stanford men's
basketball program from perennial also-ran
to NCAA contender.

If Adam Keefe had been a high school senior
three years ago, he would not have come to
Stanford.
Currently one of the best freshmen in the
Pacific 10 Conference, Keefe was in the market
for a school with a good academic reputation.
But first and foremost, Keefe wanted an es
tablished, quality basketball school.
In 1986, that wasn't true about Stanford.
In 1989, it is.
Let that be clarified. When Keefe decided
to go to Stanford last season, he chose Stan
ford on the merits of its basketball program.
The difference between 1986 and 1989 is
that Stanford can show a recruit a game like
tonight's contest with California. It's a game
in which Stanford, ranked 17th by AP and
16th by UPI, is aiming to reach the cherished
plateau of a 20-win season, a game with NCAA
tournament ramifications, a game to be played
in a sold-out, almost raucous Maples Pavilion,
before a national television audience watching
on ESPN.
"I see a big change in our credibility," Stan
ford Athletic Director Andy Geiger said. "Not
everybody that plays college basketball at
other schools is academically inept. But we
had no credibility. It was come to Stanford,
get an education, and lose basketball games."
The journey for the Cardinal isn't over yet.
Stanford faces the challenge next year of main
taining the level of success after six seniors
(Todd Lichti, Bryan McSweeney, Scott
Meinert, Eric Reveno, Terry Taylor and
Howard Wright) graduate.
"The goal we really set is to be competitve
in the Pac-10 on a regular basis," Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said.
No, Stanford isn't there yet. But the odds
are better than one might think that Stanford
will get there.

Where it began
Though the logical place for pinpointing the
beginning of Stanford's emergence would be
Stanford's first win over a No. 1 team, the
famous 82-74 Miracle at Maples win over
Arizona 12 months ago, the foundation was
laid much earlier. After all, even miracles don't
happen by themselves.
Stanford was coming off a 7-20 season when
Dr. Tom Davis took over the coaching helm
in 1982-83. Davis then produced seasons of
14-14, 19-12, 11-17 and 14-16. Not works of
art, but as Geiger pointed out, Davis started
generating some enthusiasm.
"(With Davis), basketball wasn't just some
thing we had to get through to get to spring
football," Geiger said. "Tom brought with him
Big East know-how; he was part of the found
ing of the Big East."
Davis preferred to spread the credit around.
"The big problem that I saw was that they
just hadn't won," he said. "Everything else
seemed to be there.
"The thing that pleases me so much is that
the faculty, Andy Geiger, the administration
. . . worked so hard," Davis added. "Here's
something they wanted to do and now it's

getting done. A lot of times they don't get
credit."
Geiger admits, "We were giving away tick
ets, doing anything we could to get bodies in
the building."
So, when Davis became the head coach at
lowa, the rancorous circumstances (see yes
terday's article) under which he left belied
the groundwork of enthusiasm and optimism
among those directly connected with Stanford
basketball.
"He set the stage for Mike to come in,"
Geiger said. "[Montgomery! is tough; he's
hard; he's demanding. He's not the players'
best friend, (and) I think that's a compliment."
New coach Montgomery inherited Stan
ford's best collection of young talent ever, the
current seniors. But at the time, the only
guarantee Montgomery had was that Stanford
would be competitive while they remained
enrolled — after they were gone, anything
could happen. That's the difference between
the Stanford that Adam Keefe would have
turned down then and the one he is going to
now.

Freshman forward/center Adam Keefe jams one home. Because of
Stanford's recent basketball success, more top recruits like Keefe
should follow.
