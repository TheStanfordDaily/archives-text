# California at Stanford
## 
### 
TONIGHT - Television: ESPN Radio: KZSU (90 1 FM), KCBS (740 AM) 8:30 p.m. tipoff at Maples
Pavilion.
RECORDS - Stanford (19-5, 10-3 and 3rd in Pac-10 play, ranked 17th by AP), California (17-8, 8-5
and sth).
SERIES — All time: Golden Bears lead 128-83 Recently: Stanford has won three of four and two
straight at home Last game: Cal had no second-half turnovers in rallying to beat Stanford 75-64
at Harmon Arena Jan. 19. Last game at Maples: A 12-2 run at the start of the second half sparked
Stanford to a 70-54 win.
BEAR UPDATE — Cal's NCAA-tournament hopes were severely damaged Tuesday night when the
Bears fell at Brigham Young, 87-74 Leonard Taylor leads Cal at 19.2 ppg and 8.5 rpg. Keith Smith,
Roy Fisher and Matt Beeuwsaert are also scoring in double figures
CARDINAL UPDATE — Stanford has won four straight and 14 of 16, and is 11-0 at Maples, which is
sold out for the fifth-straight time Stanford could move into second place in the Pac-10 if it wins
tonight and UCLA loses at Arizona Saturday Stanford then plays at USC Monday
KEYS TO VICTORY — The biggest is that Stanford will be playing in Maples instead of Harmon. But
in terms of on-court action, the Cardinal should try to deny Taylor the ball as best as it can — the
Cal offense revolves around him.
