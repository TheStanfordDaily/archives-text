# Stanford pitching shuts down tough Fresno State
## 
### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
It seemed like a parade to the
pitching mound yesterday, but it
worked, and that's all Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess could have
asked for yesterday in the Cardi
nal's 2-1 win over Fresno State
at Sunken Diamond.

Baseball
Cardinal 2, Bulldogs 1

Using what seemed like his en
tire pitching staff, Marquess spent
more time at the mound than the
groundskeeper. Five Stanford
hurlers combined to shackle the
Bulldogs to a lone first-inning
run, scattering nine Fresno hits
on the day. The quintet fanned
nine and walked just two.
Hoping to get several pitchers
needed midweek work and still
notch a win, pitching Coach Tom
Dunton could not have been hap
pier.
"Everyone (on the staff) is all
set for the weekend," Dunton said.
As they did last weekend
against Cal State-Fullerton, the
Cardinal faces a difficult three
game set away from home — this
time at UC-Santa Barbara.

"Two tough weekends in a row
will prepare us better down the
road. It'll be good for us, especially
our younger players," Marquess
said.
Freshman left-hander Steve
Worrell is one player who will ben
efit quite a bit from the trip to
Santa Barbara. Worrell — who
threw brilliantly in holding Fuller
ton scoreless through five innings
of relief — made his first start
