# Chitren leashes Bulldogs
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Senior staff writer 
There were no outs and runners on first and
second in the top of the eighth inning when Stanford
baseball Coach Mark Marquess called on his relief
ace Steve Chitren to preserve the Cardinal's 2-1
lead over the Fresno State Bulldogs yesterday.
Bulldog catcher Steve Vondran squared to bunt
on the second pitch and dribbled one up the third
base line. Chitren was off the mound in a flash.
He picked up the ball, threw to Tim Griffin at third
to get the force out, and Griffin completed the
double play by firing to first just in time to get
Vondran.
It was the last threat the Bulldogs would mount.
In the ninth they were reduced to a mere whimper
as Chitren fanned former Olympian Tom Goodwin
to end the game.
That scenario will have to repeat itself many
times if the Cardinal is going to go anywhere in
the postseason this year.
While Stanford has many fine young pitchers
such as Scott Weiss and Aaron Dorlarque in the
bullpen this year, when the game is tight Marquess
will count on experience, and that means Chitren
will be handed the ball a lot.
"Chitren is really in a good groove," Marquess
said after the game. "When we get into the league,
I may put him in during the second or third inning.
He normally pitches better when he pitches more."
It seems that as Chitren goes, so goes the Cardinal.
Against Santa Clara in the season
opener, Chitren came into the
game in the eighth with a two-run
lead and gave up back-to-back
homers as well as the winning
run in the 11th.
But lately, Chitren has regained
the form that made him a first
team All-America selection by The

Sporting News and a dominant
late-inning stopper in each of the
last two seasons.
"When you're struggling, the
only way you can get through it
is to pitch more. Pitching on the
hill [in a game] is not quite the
same as being in the bullpen,"
Chitren said.
If he continues to throw as well
as he did yesterday, Chitren won't
have to pitch himself out of a
slump too often.
