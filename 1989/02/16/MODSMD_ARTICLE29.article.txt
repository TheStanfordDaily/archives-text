# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
We were walking through the park the
other day trying to decide who the Athletes
of the Week should be. All of a sudden, one
of the members of our committee said, "I've
got it! Swing!"
"Swing?" another replied. "What does that
mean?"
Said the first: "They both have a sweet

swing. Women's tennis' Tami Whitlinger
swings a mean racquet and when men's
volleyball's Scott Fortune gets ready to
swing his arm for a spike, opponents cringe
with fear.
Whitlinger, a 5-foot-6 sophomore from
Neenah, Wis., went to the Rolex National
Intercollegiate Tournament without having
seen any dual-meet action due to injuries.
Still, she powered her way though the
early rounds before meeting Mary Beth
Young in the semifinals Saturday. Young,
of BYU, presented little challenge as Whit
linger won 6-3, 6-1. In the finals, against
teammate Lisa Green, Whitlinger was even
tougher as she scored a 6-1, 6-1 victory.
Whitlinger also teamed with her sister
Teri to capture the doubles title. The pair
beat Kelly Mulvihill and Stephanie Reece of
Indiana 6-4, 6-2.

Fortune, a 6-6 senior outside hitter from
Beach, Calif., led the Cardinal to
two easy victories over the weekend to move
Stanford into first place in the Western In
tercollegiate Volleyball Association.
Friday Stanford crushed Cal State-
Northridge 15-7, 15-2, 15-6 in Northridge.
Fortune recorded 21 kills, five digs and four
blocks. He also hit .607 in the win.
Saturday Stanford met the defending na
tional champions, the USC Trojans. After
a slow start, the Cardinal came back to post
a 6-15, 15-9, 15-8, 15-6 victory. After beating

the then third-ranked Trojans, Stanford
moved up a notch to fourth in the national
poll. Fortune recorded 28 kills, a .489 hitting
percentage, and three blocks.
Stanford ended the road trip Mondav with
a 4-15, 15-12, 14-16, 15-9, 15-4 win at UC-
Santa Barbara. Fortune had 37 kills, 20 digs
and six blocks in that win.
