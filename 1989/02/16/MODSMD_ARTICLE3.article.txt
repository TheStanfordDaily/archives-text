# Standard will face new interpretation
## Council to propose free speech guidelines 
### Goodwin Liu Staff writer 
In its first attempt ever at es
tablishing guidelines for inter
preting the Fundamental Stand
ard, the Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council agreed to a set of
guidelines Tuesday night that will
be presented to the Stanford com
munity for discussion as early as
next week.
Amidst recent controversy con
cerning the First Amendment
right to free expression and its
relation to the University's su
preme code of conduct, the pro
posed guidelines will "define free
speech more clearly than any
other document [the University]
has," according to council member
Canetta Ivy.
"It is the right of students to
have thoughts and ideas and to
express them in intellectual
debate," she said. "But [students]
can't force these things on other
students."
The guidelines will "explicitly
state that students have the right
not to be unavoidably and in
voluntarily subjected to racist ex
pression," said Ivy, a member of
the ASSU Council of Presidents.
Last week, Judicial Affairs Of
ficer Sally Cole decided that the
two freshmen who defaced a pos
ter in a racially offensive manner
last October at Ujamaa House
would not be charged with a Fun
damental Standard violation.
Ivy said that under the council's
proposed guidelines, the students
"most definitely" would have vi
olated the Fundamental Standard.
But Cole expressed caution, say
ing that she could not predict if
the two students should have been
prosecuted until she studies the
proposed guidelines in detail.
According to the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, the
legislative council is charged with
"promulgating regulations
governing student conduct and es
tablishing disciplinary sanctions
for use by the Stanford Judicial
Council." The legislative council
is composed of six professors and
three students, as well as three
ex-officio members who do not
vote, including Ivy.
Cole, also an ex-officio member
of the council, emphasized that
the council is "not railroading leg
islation," explaining that the pro
posal becomes legislation only
after a lengthy process with com
munity discussion and input.

Under the guidelines,
the Ujamaa incident
most definitely'
would have violated
the Fundamental
Standard.

The final draft of the proposed
guidelines will be handed to Cole
today. Ivy and Philosophy Prof.
John Perry, a voting council mem
ber, wrote the draft.
Perry co-authored an essay
printed in Campus Report last
week, which disputed the Univer
sity Legal Counsel's statement,
written in respect to the Ujamaa
incident, ranking the right to free
speech at Stanford higher than
all other standards.
Cole said she will distribute Ivy
and Perry's final draft to all coun
cil members, who have until next
Tuesday to raise objections to the
statement.
Ivy predicted that all council
members would approve of the
final draft, saying that the group
"agreed with the spirit and phi
losophy" of the guidelines at the
meeting Tuesday night.
Perry, who would not comment
on the content of the guidelines,
said, "At Tuesday's meeting, we
were definitely achieving a sense
of closure and agreement on some
thing."
If no members object, the final
draft could be published as soon
as next Wednesday, Cole said.
For a waiting period of at least
three weeks after its initial pub
lication, the draft is subjected to
the inspection and discussion of
University President Donald Ken
nedy, the Faculty Senate, the
ASSU Senate and the Stanford
community.
If the council decides not to
modify the proposal after the
waiting period, it will publish the
guidelines again, and they will
once again be publicly scrutinized.
If the council publishes the un
modified statement a third time,
the proposal becomes legislation.
Whether or not the guidelines
become legislation "depends a
great deal on the reactions of
people who care enough about the
issues to write back to the [legisla
tive council]," Cole said.
