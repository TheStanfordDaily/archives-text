Keyser and the kids. They
are the key to the 1989
Stanford baseball season.
If Stanford can develop a third
starting pitcher who is depend
able, the Cardinal starting rota
tion will be the best in the Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division.

If the kids — the freshmen and
sophomores breaking in — can
continue to improve on their fine
performance through the first 12
games of 1989, the Cardinal will
win the Six-Pac.
Sound too simple?
Well, it is that simple. Why?
Because Stanford's experienced
position players have shown they
can be counted on to produce.
Junior right fielder Paul Carey
will hold down the fort in the

cleanup spot this season. And he's
one who knows about producing
as a freshman. It was his now
legendary, 10-inning homer
against Louisiana State that kept
the Cardinal alive for its first na
tional title in 1987.
Senior second baseman Frank
Carey will be considered for All-
America honors if he continues to
perform the way he has through
the first seven games of '89. He
provides leadership to a very
young Cardinal team.
"Frank is one of the top second
basemen in the country," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said before
the '89 campaign began. Carey
has yet to prove otherwise this
season.
Junior shortstop Troy Paulsen
last year set school records for
at-bats (304), doubles (22) and his
28-game hitting streak was also
tops in Cardinal history. Though
he is not yet happy with his per
formance at the plate, Paulsen
still leads the team with 11 RBI
and raised his batting average to
.309 by going 2-for-3 yesterday
against Fresno St. He should
finish somewhere near his .345
career average this year.

If junior Tim Griffin's bat con
tinues to boom, he'll keep
playing every day at third
base. He had six hits and four
RBI as Stanford's DH in last
year's CWS.
Yet with all this proven talent,
the Cardinal has started as many
as four freshmen in a game this
season. That means that some
where down the road, in a critical
Six-Pac situation, some first-year
player is going to be called upon
to deliver with the game on the
line.
Dazzling freshmen Roger
Burnett and David Hol
brook drew the spotlight
with their hitting heroics in a
three-game set against Loyola
Marymount. At the same time,
freshman outfielder Steve
Solomon is l-for-21 on the year.
Just as Solomon may soon catch
fire, Burnett and Holbrook may
soon cool off. And that's when
others like frosh first baseman
David McCarty will get the call.
Freshman catcher Troy Tal
lman has already played exten
sively in place of junior Eric Cox,
who suffered a concussion in the
first game of the Loyola series.
Since coming back, Cox has looked
good defensively but continues to
have problems at the plate.
Along with those everyday po
sitions not occupied by the "fab
four" of Carey, Carey, Paulsen and
Griffin, the No. 3 starter in the
Cardinal rotation is the key to
Stanford's success.
Given the spot of third starter
at the beginning of the year,
senior right-hander Brian Keyser
has stuggled thus far in '89. He
was never more than a spot
starter last season and has not
finished the fifth inning in any

of his starts this year.
With Keyser struggling, fresh
man left-hander Steve Worrell
will move into the starting rota
tion this weekend against UC-
Santa Barbara. Worrell made his
first start yesterday against
Fresno and pitched well. His best
stint was five scoreless innings
versus powerful Cal State-
Fullerton last weekend.
Keyser also pitched two very
impressive innings yesterday in
relief. If Keyser's calling again be
comes the bullpen, then Worrel,
sophomore Scott Weiss or fresh
man Aaron Dorlarque will have
to do the job. The third starter
will become absolutely critical
once league play starts.
Why? Because the first rule of
Six-Pac baseball is to never get
swept. With Mussina and Spencer,
that won't happen. The second
rule is if you want to win the
division, you have to sweep a few
series. That's where the third
starter becomes crucial.
With Mussina and Spencer
giving Stanford a great shot at
two out of three each weekend,
the No. 3 starter will be the one
who determines whether Cardinal
fans sweep the roof of the oppon
ent's dugout at the end of Sun
day's game.
So this neat little equation is
complete, except for one
small thing: defense. The
Cardinal has not been up to snuff
in that department through its
first 12 games. You have to "go
with what brung you," as they
say, and pitching and defense are
what brought Stanford two na
tional crowns. Marquess prides
himself on how sound his teams
are defensively, and it's only a
matter of time before this year's
club meets his standards.
