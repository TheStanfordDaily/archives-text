Keyser and the kids. They
are the key to the 1989
Stanford baseball season.
If Stanford can develop a third
starting pitcher who is depend
able, the Cardinal starting rota
tion will be the best in the Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division.

If the kids — the freshmen and
sophomores breaking in — can
continue to improve on their fine
performance through the first 12
games of 1989, the Cardinal will
win the Six-Pac.
Sound too simple?
Well, it is that simple. Why?
Because Stanford's experienced
position players have shown they
can be counted on to produce.
Junior right fielder Paul Carey
will hold down the fort in the

cleanup spot this season. And he's
one who knows about producing
as a freshman. It was his now
legendary, 10-inning homer
against Louisiana State that kept
the Cardinal alive for its first na
tional title in 1987.
Senior second baseman Frank
Carey will be considered for All-
America honors if he continues to
perform the way he has through
the first seven games of '89. He
provides leadership to a very
young Cardinal team.
"Frank is one of the top second
basemen in the country," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said before
the '89 campaign began. Carey
has yet to prove otherwise this
season.
Junior shortstop Troy Paulsen
last year set school records for
at-bats (304), doubles (22) and his
28-game hitting streak was also
tops in Cardinal history. Though
he is not yet happy with his per
formance at the plate, Paulsen
still leads the team with 11 RBI
and raised his batting average to
.309 by going 2-for-3 yesterday
against Fresno St. He should
finish somewhere near his .345
career average this year.
