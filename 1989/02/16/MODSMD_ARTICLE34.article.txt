against the Gauchos.
"He's getting a little more com
fortable. He pitched extremely
well against Fullerton. He's going
to be out there a lot," Dunton said.
"He had a good fastball. We
heard he was a little bit wild com

the plate," Fresno sixth-place hit

Senior Brian Keyser, who has
temporarily lost his spot in the
rotation to Worrell, pitched the
the fourth and fifth and allowed
just two hits while fanning two.

usually throws on the side in mid
week, but today he got in his work
on the field. He went two innings,
fanning four and allowing just one
hit.
Sophomore Scott Weiss started
the eighth and allowed two
straight singles, forcing Marquess
to call on his bullpen stopper,
Steve Chitren, to slam the door
for his second save of the year.

hits, Stanford needed the aid of
two Fresno errors on the same

Third baseman Tim GrifTin and
first baseman David Holbrook led
off the Cardinal fifth with singles,
putting runners on first and sec
ond. After a strikeout, left fielder
Brian Johnson grounded a pitch
to the right of Titan shortstop
Eddie Zosky.
Zosky booted the certain
double-play ball, but recovered to
catch Griffin overrunning third
base. His throw was obligingly
mishandled by Fresno third base
man Mike Burton, and the ball
dribbled into foul territory, just
far enough from Burton to allow
GrifTin to score and tie the game
at 1-1.
The errant throw also permit

to third, and Cardinal catcher Eric
Cox cashed him in with a sacrifice
fly to deep left-center that would
have been a double on any other
day.
Fresno center fielder Tom
Goodwin — an Olympian under
Marquess in 1988 — made a
fabulous running catch to prevent
a third Stanford run.
