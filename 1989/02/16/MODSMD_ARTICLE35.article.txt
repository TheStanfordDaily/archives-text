THE STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY

Wake me up before you go-go
Just when you thought the world might not be nuts after
all, along comes something simply not-from-this-planet.
This week's entry is the Sonic SafeSeat, a disposable
toilet-seat cover that is, according to its press release, an
"ingenious solution to the problem of germs and gnme
and other unpleasant stuff found on public toilet seats."
Other unpleasant stuff? Like what, John Tower?
According to its inventor, Vancouver businesswoman
Margo Stewart, "You just slide it over the toilet seat and
go! It can't fall off and nothing can soak through. When
you're finished, slide it off and throw it away. It's
degradable." We'll say!
Blow up your video
Well, maybe you shouldn't blow it up. Instead, why not
enter it in the 13 Annual Palo Alto Film & Video Festival.
Short works (45 minutes or less) in 16mm film or 3/4 inch
videotape are eligible. There are no specific categones
under which to enter, and a mere $15 fee per entry.
There are $3000 in awards, including $1000 for the Best
of Festival. All films selected for the Festival will be shown
on May 10 and 11 at the Varsity Theater in Palo Alto.
For further information and entry blanks call 329-2122.
French assassins
If you want an evening filled with light humor and relaxing
music, you probably shouldn't be in school. But you are,
so you might like "The Persecution and Assassination of
Jean-Paul Marat," a play performed by the Inmates of the
Asylum of Charenton under the direction of the Marquis
de Sade. As you can tell, there are definite French influences
in this play. You can catch the performances February
22-25 and March 1-4 at 8 p.m. in Memorial Auditonum.
The Fox meets the Apple
Welcome Samantha Fox to the United States of America.
The famed Bntish pop star has decided to bounce on over
to the Big Apple for a few months. The move is because
all the excitement over her latest release, "I Wanna Have
Some Fun," is just too much to handle in dreary old
England.
A little night music
Saturday night at 8 p.m. in Campbell Recital Hall check
out the free concert of Romantic chamber music given by
pianist Linda Huang, violinist Chuck Seiber and cellist
Rebecca Baron. Their program will include works by Men
delssohn, Sweeney and Brahms.
