# Rush's music is never dry

Open up the case of "A Show
of Hands", pop the disc into your
CD player (if you have one), and
after a minute or so of fans wilding
cheering on an electric organ rendi
tion of "Three Blind Mice" you'll
probably wonder if your roommate
secretly switched discs with his
"Sesame Street" soundtrack.
But give it a few more seconds
and you'll be blasted by the steel
chord which kicks off "The Big
Money," the first track on the latest
live/greatest hits album from Rush.
Sure, it's a strange way to start
off a concert album, but that's the
way Rush docs it. Rush has always
done things differently.
Born out of the Toronto music
scene in the early '70s, Rush got
its start where all pcrfomers except
Star Search finalists do, playing the
club scene. In 1974 Mercury
Records released Rush's self-titled
debut album, instantly branding
Rush as a Led Zepplin ripoff. And
for good reason: just compare the

guitar licks (ever lick a guitar?) in
"What You're Doing" and Zep's
"Heartbreaker."
At that point, Rush was made
up of bassist/vocalist Geddy Lee,
guitarist Alex Lifeson and drum
mer lohn Rutsey. But Rutsey didn't
even stay around for the group's
first official tour. (Put him in the
same group of dumb drummers as
Pete Best.) To compensate, Lifeson
and Lee recruited Neil Peart, who
would soon become the world's
greatest (no, none of this "one of
the greatest. . ." pussyfooting
around, THE GREATEST) drum
mer. Yes, even better than Sheila E.
Peart changed Rush forever. By
providing the band with his per
cussion wizardry he allowed Rush
to develop their own unique sound.
Rush was among the first to
write multiple-part (and some
times entire-sidc-of-an-album)
songs, with musically diverse com
ponents united by their lyrics.
Rush's sound became so unique
that after "Caress of Steel" flopped
commercially (but not artistically),
Mercury told the band to make its

sound more "sellable" (e.g. top-40
fodder) if it planned on sticking
around on the Mercury label.
Rush's response was "2112,"
simply one of the fiercest records
ever made. The 80-minute,
multiple-part title satirized Mer
cury's attempt at manipulating the
band by narrating a fictional ac
count of the discovery of music
and its rejection at the hands of
society's leaders.
Immediately after "2112", the
band released its first double
length live album, setting up a so
far unbroken pattern of four studio
albums followed by a live compi
lation.
Rush remained static for the
next several years — if anything
Rush does can be called static.
Turning out rock 'n roll anthems
like clockwork, Rush produced
"Hemispheres," "A Farwell to
Kings" and "Permanent Waves."
Then came 1981 's "Moving Pic
tures" — from start to finish an
