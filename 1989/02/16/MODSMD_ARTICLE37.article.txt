# Rush's music is never dry
## 
### Matthew Marx Staff writer 
Open up the case of "A Show
of Hands", pop the disc into your
CD player (if you have one), and
after a minute or so of fans wilding
cheering on an electric organ rendi
tion of "Three Blind Mice" you'll
probably wonder if your roommate
secretly switched discs with his
"Sesame Street" soundtrack.
But give it a few more seconds
and you'll be blasted by the steel
chord which kicks off "The Big
Money," the first track on the latest
live/greatest hits album from Rush.
Sure, it's a strange way to start
off a concert album, but that's the
way Rush docs it. Rush has always
done things differently.
Born out of the Toronto music
scene in the early '70s, Rush got
its start where all pcrfomers except
Star Search finalists do, playing the
club scene. In 1974 Mercury
Records released Rush's self-titled
debut album, instantly branding
Rush as a Led Zepplin ripoff. And
for good reason: just compare the

guitar licks (ever lick a guitar?) in
"What You're Doing" and Zep's
"Heartbreaker."
At that point, Rush was made
up of bassist/vocalist Geddy Lee,
guitarist Alex Lifeson and drum
mer lohn Rutsey. But Rutsey didn't
even stay around for the group's
first official tour. (Put him in the
same group of dumb drummers as
Pete Best.) To compensate, Lifeson
and Lee recruited Neil Peart, who
would soon become the world's
greatest (no, none of this "one of
the greatest. . ." pussyfooting
around, THE GREATEST) drum
mer. Yes, even better than Sheila E.
Peart changed Rush forever. By
providing the band with his per
cussion wizardry he allowed Rush
to develop their own unique sound.
Rush was among the first to
write multiple-part (and some
times entire-sidc-of-an-album)
songs, with musically diverse com
ponents united by their lyrics.
Rush's sound became so unique
that after "Caress of Steel" flopped
commercially (but not artistically),
Mercury told the band to make its

sound more "sellable" (e.g. top-40
fodder) if it planned on sticking
around on the Mercury label.
Rush's response was "2112,"
simply one of the fiercest records
ever made. The 80-minute,
multiple-part title satirized Mer
cury's attempt at manipulating the
band by narrating a fictional ac
count of the discovery of music
and its rejection at the hands of
society's leaders.
Immediately after "2112", the
band released its first double
length live album, setting up a so
far unbroken pattern of four studio
albums followed by a live compi
lation.
Rush remained static for the
next several years — if anything
Rush does can be called static.
Turning out rock 'n roll anthems
like clockwork, Rush produced
"Hemispheres," "A Farwell to
Kings" and "Permanent Waves."
Then came 1981 's "Moving Pic
tures" — from start to finish an

unrelenting musical romp. "Tom
Sawyer" . . . "YYZ" ... "Witch
Hunt" ... titles that make pseudo
rock charlatans like Bon Jovi quiver
in their pseudo-leather pseudo
cowboy boots. For "Moving Pic
tures" the band shed its multiple
part song style in favor of a more
concise four to six minute song
format.
The next studio album, "Sig
nals," was Rush's first attempt in
another direction. Softer and more
pensive, it was scorned by critics
and didn't sell too well either.
Undisturbed, Rush bounced
back with the best album of their
career, "Grace Under Pressure."
Let's just say that with "Distant
Early Warning," "Red Sector A"
and"The Body Electric," it rocks!
It was then time for exploration
again, so with "Power Windows"
Rush delved into the risky realm
of progressive rock. Interestingly,
the album debuted high on the
charts but sunk right away. The
same went for last year's "Hold
Your Fire."
Still, their third live album, the
aptly named "A Show of Hands,"
is hot off the presses. And it's a
zinger. After the whimsical intro
you get 80 minutes of the best

power rock money can buy.
"A Show of Hands" relies heavily
on the past few albums, including
four singles apiece from "Power
Windows" and "Hold Your Fire,"
two from "Grace Under Pressure"
and one from "Signals."
The best two songs, however,
are from earlier albums. "Witch
Hunt," from "Moving Pictures,"
sounds even more sinister than
the original. Reaching all the way
back to "A Farewell to Kings,"
Rush included "Closer to the
Heart."
The live recording is impeccable.
It sounds even better than when
I heard Rush in concert last winter
in Washington, D.C. One part,
however, that never needs im
provement is Neil Peart's drum
solo. Even pared down from the
15-minute solo he played on last
winter's tour, the five-minute
drum cut titled "The Rhythm
Method" shows the master at his
best.
From here on out Rush's future
is uncertain. According to Music
Express magazine, the band mem
bers broke up over the summer
because of musical exhaustion —
they were at a loss for new ideas.
But as they remixed "A Show of
Hands," they found that they were
writing new guitar and vocal lines
as well. What does that mean? No
telling, but let's just hope that this
show of hands won't be their last.

length live album, setting up a so
far unbroken pattern of four studio
albums followed by a live compi
lation.
Rush remained static for the
next several years — if anything
Rush does can be called static.
Turning out rock 'n roll anthems
like clockwork, Rush produced
"Hemispheres," "A Farwell to
Kings" and "Permanent Waves."
Then came 1981 's "Moving Pic
tures" — from start to finish an

unrelenting musical romp. "Tom
Sawyer" . . . "YYZ" ... "Witch
Hunt" ... titles that make pseudo
rock charlatans like Bon Jovi quiver
in their pseudo-leather pseudo
cowboy boots. For "Moving Pic
tures" the band shed its multiple
part song style in favor of a more
concise four to six minute song
format.
The next studio album, "Sig
nals," was Rush's first attempt in
another direction. Softer and more
pensive, it was scorned by critics
and didn't sell too well either.
Undisturbed, Rush bounced
back with the best album of their
career, "Grace Under Pressure."
Let's just say that with "Distant
Early Warning," "Red Sector A"
and"The Body Electric," it rocks!
It was then time for exploration
again, so with "Power Windows"
Rush delved into the risky realm
of progressive rock. Interestingly,
the album debuted high on the
charts but sunk right away. The
same went for last year's "Hold
Your Fire."
Still, their third live album, the
aptly named "A Show of Hands,"
is hot off the presses. And it's a
zinger. After the whimsical intro
you get 80 minutes of the best

power rock money can buy.
"A Show of Hands" relies heavily
on the past few albums, including
four singles apiece from "Power
Windows" and "Hold Your Fire,"
two from "Grace Under Pressure"
and one from "Signals."
The best two songs, however,
are from earlier albums. "Witch
Hunt," from "Moving Pictures,"
sounds even more sinister than
the original. Reaching all the way
back to "A Farewell to Kings,"
Rush included "Closer to the
Heart."
The live recording is impeccable.
It sounds even better than when
I heard Rush in concert last winter
in Washington, D.C. One part,
however, that never needs im
provement is Neil Peart's drum
solo. Even pared down from the
15-minute solo he played on last
winter's tour, the five-minute
drum cut titled "The Rhythm
Method" shows the master at his
best.
From here on out Rush's future
is uncertain. According to Music
Express magazine, the band mem
bers broke up over the summer
because of musical exhaustion —
they were at a loss for new ideas.
But as they remixed "A Show of
Hands," they found that they were
writing new guitar and vocal lines
as well. What does that mean? No
telling, but let's just hope that this
show of hands won't be their last.
Open up the case of "A Show
of Hands", pop the disc into your
CD player (if you have one), and
after a minute or so of fans wilding
cheering on an electric organ rendi
tion of "Three Blind Mice" you'll
probably wonder if your roommate
secretly switched discs with his
"Sesame Street" soundtrack.
But give it a few more seconds
and you'll be blasted by the steel
chord which kicks off "The Big
Money," the first track on the latest
live/greatest hits album from Rush.
Sure, it's a strange way to start
off a concert album, but that's the
way Rush docs it. Rush has always
done things differently.
Born out of the Toronto music
scene in the early '70s, Rush got
its start where all pcrfomers except
Star Search finalists do, playing the
club scene. In 1974 Mercury
Records released Rush's self-titled
debut album, instantly branding
Rush as a Led Zepplin ripoff. And
for good reason: just compare the

guitar licks (ever lick a guitar?) in
"What You're Doing" and Zep's
"Heartbreaker."
At that point, Rush was made
up of bassist/vocalist Geddy Lee,
guitarist Alex Lifeson and drum
mer lohn Rutsey. But Rutsey didn't
even stay around for the group's
first official tour. (Put him in the
same group of dumb drummers as
Pete Best.) To compensate, Lifeson
and Lee recruited Neil Peart, who
would soon become the world's
greatest (no, none of this "one of
the greatest. . ." pussyfooting
around, THE GREATEST) drum
mer. Yes, even better than Sheila E.
Peart changed Rush forever. By
providing the band with his per
cussion wizardry he allowed Rush
to develop their own unique sound.
Rush was among the first to
write multiple-part (and some
times entire-sidc-of-an-album)
songs, with musically diverse com
ponents united by their lyrics.
Rush's sound became so unique
that after "Caress of Steel" flopped
commercially (but not artistically),
Mercury told the band to make its

sound more "sellable" (e.g. top-40
fodder) if it planned on sticking
around on the Mercury label.
Rush's response was "2112,"
simply one of the fiercest records
ever made. The 80-minute,
multiple-part title satirized Mer
cury's attempt at manipulating the
band by narrating a fictional ac
count of the discovery of music
and its rejection at the hands of
society's leaders.
