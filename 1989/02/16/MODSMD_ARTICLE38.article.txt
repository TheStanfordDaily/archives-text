Bailiff: Hear ye, hear ye, all rise, the
honorable Judge Gerhard Gesell presiding.
(The jury rises)
Judge: Ha ha, Simon didn't say. You're
all out.
Jury: Grumble, grumble. (New jury

Bailiff: Hear ye, hear ye, Simon says
all rise. The Honorable Judge Gerhard
Gesell presiding in the case of the people
of the United States vs. Lt. Colonel Oliver
North. In the blue corner, weighing in at
185 pounds and undefeated in 35 profes
sional fights....
Judge: I've read both of your statements,
and I'd like you, Mrs. Podloznovich, to
tell me in your own words exactly how
Mr. Krumpwurst happened to give your
poodle a mohawk and . .. hey, wait a
minute, this isn't the People's Court! Uh,
prosecution, make your opening state
ment.
Prosecution: Your honor, with your per

mission we will waive our opening state
ment.
Judge: Permission granted.
(Prosecuting attorneys do The Wave
fury cheers.)

1 established a secret
Swiss bank account and
gave the passbook to a
number of Arab terrorists.
And then I went out drink
ing with John Tower.'

Judge: Would the defense like to give
an opening statement?
Defense: Your honor, our opening state
ment would contain state and military
secrets which could seriously jeopardize
national security. Furthermore, we Relieve
that it is impossible to have a fair trial
in Washington, D.C. because of the
publicity that occurred when our client
broke the law with reckless abandon and
disregard for authority. Therefore, we
hereby move that the court relocate the

trial to a more neutral location, such as
Managua.
Judge: Your motion is denied. And
you're ugly. Prosecution, call your first
witness.
Prosecution: Call Lt. Colonel Oliver
North.
Bailiff: Colonel North, do you swear to
tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth so help you God?
North: I do.
Bailiff: Then by the power vested in
me by the United States of America I now
declare you Man and Judge. You may kiss
his honor. (North kisses Judge Gesell)
Prosecution: Colonel North, where
were you the night of August 16, 1986?
North: I was selling arms to Iran and
then diverting the profits to the Contra
rebels in Nicaragua.
Prosecution: And what did you do after
that?
North: I established a secret Swiss bank
account and gave the passbook to a num
ber of Arab terrorists. And then I went
out drinking with John Tower

Prosecution: And then what did you
and Senator Tower do?
Defense: I object! The prosecution is
attempting to drag the good name of
Senator Tower through the slime. . ..
Arnie Becker: Slime! Slime! Did some
body say slime?
Prosecution: I'll withdraw the question.
However, at this point I would like to
petition for a pro bono writ of habeus
corpus which I will use to quod erat
demonstrantum the squid pro quo.

Judge: Your petition is granted â€” the
men's room is down the hall and to the
left. In the absence of the prosecuting
attorney I will call a 15 minute recess.
North: Oh boy, recess! I'm gonna go
play on the teeter-totter!
Defense: I object! I get to use the teeter
totter first.
North: If you let me use the teeter-totter
I'll give you lohn Tower's little black book.
Defense: It's all yours.
Judge: In light of the extremely heavy
schedule facing the court this month we
will be conducting other business during
the recess. You, the short furry guy in the
front row, what business do you have with
the court?
Squirrel: Your honor, on behalf of the
Associated Squirrels of Stanford University
I would like to request that a restraining
order be placed on Robvn Bczar. A number
of my fellow squirrels nave reported being
followed by her for hours on end, and . . .
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! . . . (squirrel
is run over by bicycle).
