# Winter One Acts goes one for three

### Mia Manzulli Staff writer 
You know the old saying, "We
saved the best for last."? Well, as
you sit through this year's Original
Winter One Acts, you can't help
but feel that the old adage is true.

Jonathan Sherman's "Musing," die
third of the three one act plays
certainly outshines the other two
in its capability to entertain and
amuse (if you'll pardon the pun!).
Don't get me wrong, both of the
other plays, "At School, At Night"
and "A Perfect Flaw," respectively,

have their merits. I was fascinated
by the originality of each of them
and enjoyed all three in their own
right. It's just in comparison to
"Musings" that the other two begin
to pale.
The One Acts begin with Gwen
Orel's (you may remember her In

visible Girl column in The Daily
several volumes back) "At School,
At Night," originally written for
an English class as a take on Beck
ett.
The scene is a familiar Stanford
dorm room and the lead, played
by Ellen Schwerin, is a female stu
dent trying not to think about
something that has happened to
her. She knows she must "Begin
Again" but she's having problems
admitting anything has occurred
in the first place.
The "something" turns out to
be date rape, although this doesn't
become immediately obvious. In
stead, we are forced to endure the
denial and subsequent emotional
disturbance of the girl through this
difficult time in the form of
monologue.
The only breaks in Schwerin's
energetic spiel come from The
Other Girl, played by Kira Snyder
and The Man, Neal Rojas, who
enact the scenes that The Girl is
trying to block out.
Unfortunately, in order for The
Girl to stop thinking about the
rape she must put it in front of
her and try to relieve herself from
it.
While "At School, At Night"
moved rapidly without unneces
sary pause, the next play, Juan
Chanco's "A Perfect Flaw" depends
on a lot of fadeouts and dramatic
pauses to move the play along.
While this format heightens the
drama of the story, the length of

time involved in the blackouts be
comes frustrating to the audience.
This play develops the struggle
between order and chaos, reality
and fantasy, and routine and art.
In life we find out that "The only
thing you can be sure of is your
self" and that is what Leonard, a
frustrated sculptor, wonderfully
acted by Vince Ricci, sets out to
discover.
Leonard lives with his lover
Steve, a control oriented manage
ment consultant, convincingly
played by Marc Katz.
While Ricci makes the tor
mented sculptor come to life, Alex
andra Dumas, as Mary, the painter
from his past, is flat and uncon
vincing in comparison.
"A Perfect Flaw" is imaginative
and provocative in its attempt to
capture the dyamics of relation
ships, art, reality and life.
Finally, there awaits "Musing,"
written by Sherman and well
directed by Christopher LaPuma,
a truly funny story of the trials of
a poet with writer's block. Ashwin
Arjun Bulchandani does a good job
playing Nash, the assistant profes
sor having a difficult time turning
his thoughts into anything lyrical.
His shrink can't help him, but

his good old buddy Wex thinks he
knows the trick. Short of drinking
away his troubles with some good
gin, Nash needs a muse. Wex,
played with a tremendous amount
of energy by Ted Quinn, is con
vinced that all his friend needs is
a little inspiration.
What ensues is Nash's en
counters with the various muses
of Nature, Death, Truth, Justice,
Love ... the list goes on. Each
visit catches Nash by surprise and
yet somehow doesn't pull him
from his abyss. The audience is
in store for some laughs, however,
as each muse is equipped with
witty remarks and saucy come
backs.
Scan Michael White is great as
Nature, Knowledge and Fred (you'll
see), and Frederik Goris makes an
easy transition from Death to Jus
tice. The women muses are won
derful each in their own way: Lisa
Fragner is brash and comical as
Truth; Carolyn Collman is a very
seductive Love ; and Kristan Klin
gelhofer makes a virtuous Celibacy
and Romance. All of the characters
are well suited to their parts and
all do justice to the very witty
script of Jonathan Sherman.

The Original Winter One Acts play
tonight through Sunday at the El
liot Program Center. Tickets are
$4 and are available in White Plaza
from 12-1 p.m.
