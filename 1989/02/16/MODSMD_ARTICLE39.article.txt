# Winter One Acts goes one for three

You know the old saying, "We
saved the best for last."? Well, as
you sit through this year's Original
Winter One Acts, you can't help
but feel that the old adage is true.

Jonathan Sherman's "Musing," die
third of the three one act plays
certainly outshines the other two
in its capability to entertain and
amuse (if you'll pardon the pun!).
Don't get me wrong, both of the
other plays, "At School, At Night"
and "A Perfect Flaw," respectively,

have their merits. I was fascinated
by the originality of each of them
and enjoyed all three in their own
right. It's just in comparison to
"Musings" that the other two begin
to pale.
The One Acts begin with Gwen
Orel's (you may remember her In

visible Girl column in The Daily
several volumes back) "At School,
At Night," originally written for
an English class as a take on Beck
ett.
The scene is a familiar Stanford
dorm room and the lead, played
by Ellen Schwerin, is a female stu
dent trying not to think about
something that has happened to
her. She knows she must "Begin
Again" but she's having problems
admitting anything has occurred
in the first place.
The "something" turns out to
be date rape, although this doesn't
become immediately obvious. In
stead, we are forced to endure the
denial and subsequent emotional
disturbance of the girl through this
difficult time in the form of
monologue.
The only breaks in Schwerin's
energetic spiel come from The
Other Girl, played by Kira Snyder
and The Man, Neal Rojas, who
enact the scenes that The Girl is
trying to block out.
Unfortunately, in order for The
Girl to stop thinking about the
rape she must put it in front of
her and try to relieve herself from
it.
While "At School, At Night"
moved rapidly without unneces
sary pause, the next play, Juan
Chanco's "A Perfect Flaw" depends
on a lot of fadeouts and dramatic
pauses to move the play along.
While this format heightens the
drama of the story, the length of
