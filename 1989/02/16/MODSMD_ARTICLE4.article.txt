# USW points out plight of Webb Ranch workers

To make public the fight they are waging
against Webb Ranch management, workers
took about 25 reporters from the local and
national media through what they consider
their overcrowded living quarters.
On Tuesday, the United Stanford
Workers demanded that the University in
corporate more than 50 workers working
at Webb Ranch, a private farm located on
campus and leased by the University, into
the union. The union organized yesterday's
press conference, attended by reporters
from the San Jose Mercury News, the As
sociated Press and local television news
stations.
Speaking through an interpreter, one of
the workers, Salvador Salas, told the
reporters that he had been living with his

wife and three children in a single room
not much larger than a double in Stern
Hall. Almost all of the workers are Mexican
Americans who do not speak English.
Calling the charges of overcrowded
housing "absurd," ranch manager Thomas
Hubbard noted that San Mateo County
inspectors frequently visit the ranch to in
sure that such problems do not occur.
But Salas accused Hubbard of evicting
him from his room earlier this month be
cause the county officials would have
judged that his living arrangement violated
housing laws.
Rent is automatically deducted from the
workers' salaries, according to both Hub
bard and Salas.
But Salas claimed that the rate is out
rageous — more than $400 a month for
five people living in one room.
The ranch also charges the
workers more than $100 a month
in utilities, Salas said.
The USW argues that the Uni
versity, as owner of the land, is
a joint employer of the workers
and should take responsibility for
the workers' plight.
In a press statement released
yesterday, University counsel
Priscilla Wheeler denied the claim
that the University is an employer
of the workers.
"While it may be difficult to
understand fully, Stanford is not
responsible for the employment
policies of its leasees or contrac
tors," Wheeler wrote.

According to Webb Ranch workers, their managers refused to put up dividers between these three
toilets. The workers conducted a tour of their facilities yesterday.
