At first, no major sparks fly ;
however, as the story
progresses, the two become
allies as well as friends. It isn't
long before Larry and Maria dis
cover that their spouses are
having an affair. After much
contemplation, they conspire to
convince their spouses that
they, too, are romantically in
volved.
Although Larry and Maria are
merely spending time together
just as friends, their attraction
for each other grows. Their re
lationship is a perfect example

of what happens when opposites
attract. Maria exemplifies the
pristine, proper sophisticate,
whereas Larry epitomizes the
laid-back, carefree man who has
failed at everything except life.
Maria faces an inner conflict
and is preoccupied with doing
what is proper and acceptable.
She finds herself caught be
tween following her traditional
values and following her heart.
Larry, on the other hand, pays
no attention to what is proper
and doesn't seem to worry about
anything. Throughout her rela
tionship with Larry, Maria
hopes to gain the strength to
confront her domineering hus
band.
Danson and Rossellini are a
winning combination. Danson
is a hilarious lazy, mellow fail
ure, and Rosselini is outstand
ing at playing a part that could
definitely prove to be a stepping
stone in her career. "Cousins"
is a fabulous romantic comedy
with a plot that includes many
twists and surprises. It is espe
cially enjoyable to watch Dan
son and Rosselini's relationship
unfold throughout the movie.
