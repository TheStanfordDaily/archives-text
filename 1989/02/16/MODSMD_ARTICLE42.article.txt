"There once was a woman who
swallowed a fly,
I don't know why she swallowed
a fly .. . perhaps she'll die."

The Fly II
Insects 4, Humans 0

Jeff Goldblum mumbled this
verse in the 1986 hit horror movie
"The Fly" as his body parts fell off
and he became the title character.
If I were to be so presumptuous
as to make up a new rhyme for
the sequel (which I am), it would
go something like this:
"There once was a ""Fly" sequel
ending in "II"
and it was so bad, it deserves

this review
The sequel begins with Geena
Davis giving birth to a living pork
chop. Smartly, Geena dies during
labor, which exempts her from the
rest of the movie. The deli-roast
thingy grows up to become Martin
Brundle (played by Eric Stoltz, who
also wore a lot of gross makeup

in "Mask"). While he looks like a
normal human being, he's got
these dormant chromosomes
which will start to monsterize him
as soon as he hits puberty.
The infamous Men in White Lab
Coats (who have appeared in a
number of movies since their debut
in "E.T.") study Martin and are
(as usual) stern, cold and awfully
nasty (sort of like Stern food). As
Martin changes into the insectile
mutant, we rest assured that he
will get his just revenge on these
scientist-beasties.
In any case, watching "The Fly
II" got so tediously routine that I
began trying to find ways to amuse
myself. What DOES Paulina look
like naked? Could I pronounce
Daphne Zuniga's name back
wards? Could I predict what part

of Martin's anatomy would fall off
next? Could I guess who he would
regurgitate on at the end of the
movie?
As these and other thoughts
crossed my mind, I tried to come
up with a good reason why this
sorry sequel was even made. I sup
pose it's all because Geena Davis
was left pregnant with the pork
chop thing at the end of the
original. (Now there's one reason
to vote pro-choice.)
David Cronenberg, who directed
the 1986 film, refused to do the
follow-up because he was off
making a movie about killer twin
gynecologists. In his place is Chris
Walace, whose previous major
achievement was creating the spe
cial effects for the first "Fly" movie.
In his directional debut, Walace
proves that special effects people
should stay in their respective de
partment. He litters his film with
clips from the original and hard
ware which looks like it came from
a backlot of "Battlestar Galactica."
He does, however, allow for the
most innovative rejection of the
1989 film season, which takes
place in a lab between two quar
reling scientist/lovers: "Get out of
my sector. You don't have
clearance [pause] anymore." Talk
about dramatic tension.
And finishing up my little poem:
"As the credits appeared, I fled
to the door,
Fearful of sitting through "Fly
III" or "IV".
