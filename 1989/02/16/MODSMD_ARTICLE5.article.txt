# Counselor defends right to burn flag

### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
A famous civil rights lawyer and his client last
night defended the constitutional right of an indi
vidual to burn the United States flag.
In a speech at Kresge, attorney William Kunstler
and his client Gregory Johnson, who is charged with
burning burned a flag in protest at the 1984 Re
publican National convention in Dallas, discussed
.Johnson's case which will go before the U.S. Su
preme Court.
Outside of the convention, Johnson and fellow
members of The Revolutionary Communist Youth
Brigade contrasted the Reagan era's notion of a
"peaceful and prosperous time with what we see
as a sick and dying empire," he said.
After several chants, including "Red, white and
blue, you stand for plunder, you will go under,"
the group torched the flag. "It
was great to see intentional mur
der and plunder go up in flames,"
he said.
Johnson also said he considered
Reagan as "the American Hitler."
Ninety-six arrests were made
and Johnson was charged under
section 4209 of the Texas statute
for "desecration of a venerated
object."
The real legal question is
whether burning of the flag con
stituted symbolic speech, and as
such, is protected by the First
Amendment.
Comparing the flag-burning
case to the recent publishing of
"Satanic Verses" which has
aroused heated controversy in Is
lamic countries, Kunstler said

that words that excite people
should especially be protected.
"Although flag burning may not
be something that everyone
agrees with, it communicateß
something, and is not a breach of
peace," Kunstler said. "It is the
best message of all — look at the
recognition it got."
After the speech, Law Prof.
Gerald Gunther said he supported
Kunstler in defending "the free
dom of thought that we hate."
But Gunther questioned how
Kunstler would approach the
Skokie, 111. case in which the Su
preme Court allowed neo-Nazis to
march through a predominantly
Jewish neighborhood, inciting ra
cial hatred.
Kunstler said that he thought
civil liberties were designed "to
protect the individual from state
action, not individual action. I
resigned from the ACLU when
they took on the case."
