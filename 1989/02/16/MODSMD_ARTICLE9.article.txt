Undisturbed by the apparent apa
thy, University President Donald Ken
nedy faulted the questioners and not
the questioned for the results of the
latest ASSU straw poll in which more
than 50 percent of the respondents
said they had no opinion about his
"Reflections on Racial Understand
ing."
"It's very difficult to get a mean
ingful answer out of a meaningless
question," Kennedy said yesterday.
The "Reflections" statement by
Kennedy concerning issues of race at
Stanford originally appeared in The
Daily and Campus Report Jan. 11.
Student pollsters telephoned a ran
dom selection of 86 undergraduate
and 55 graduate students to compile
the results.
Of the students surveyed, 53.5 per
cent of the undergraduates *nd 72.7

Most had no opinion
about the statement.

percent of the graduate students had
no opinion about Kennedy's state
ment.
BSU Chair Mary Dillard suggested
the response stems from students
"trying to step away from racism."
The majority of undergraduates
who did express an opinion agreed
that Kennedy's essay constituted a
neutral stance on the issue of racism
at Stanford while the majority of grad
uate students labeled Kennedy's
stance weak.
Richard Suh, spokesperson for the
Asian-American Students Association,
agreed with the more critical student
assessment of Kennedy's statement.

"Kennedy could have been more ex
plicit in supporting ethnic studies,"
Suh said, instead of just supporting
integration.
In response to another question, a
mtyority of the surveyed students ex
pressed satisfaction about the quality
of the teaching assistant program. And
most were aware of University reduc
tions in funding for TAs in the School
of Humanities and Sciences.
Further poll results indicate that
student use of recycling bins makes
this generally "the best year ever" for
recycling on campus, according to
Barb Voss at the Stanford Recycling
Center.
Most students said they use the bins
occasionally to frequently. Voss spec
ulated that the majority of non-users
live off campus, but said the center
intends to target non-users who live
on campus to encourage their partic
ipation.
