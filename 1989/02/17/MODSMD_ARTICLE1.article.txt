# Showtime! Card slams the Bears
## 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
If you weren't among the 103,457 that
jammed into Maples Pavilion last night, you
missed seeing the Stanford Cardinal light up
the night and then turn out the lights.
Don't tell the fire marshal, but they were
hanging from the rafters of 7,500-seat Maples
last night, and I'm not just talking about the
crowd. The 17th-ranked Cardinal came soaring
down at California from a whole other level,
stuffing the Bears 97-71.

Men's Basketball
Cardinal 97, Golden Bears 71

Cal (17-9, 8-6 in the Pacific 10 Conference),
probably operating on the knowledge that
Stanford was a bang-it-inside, low-to-the
ground offensive team, left back in Berkeley
the anti-gravity boots it needed to rise above
the crowd's decibel level and meet the high
flying Cardinal.
Showtime at Maples erupted from the
opening tip when Stanford guard Todd Lichti
drove baseline and laid it in with the best left
hand this side of Marvelous Marvin Hagler,
and didn't stop until reserve center Derek
Bruton sunk two free throws with the poise
of Sir Lawrence Olivier orating on stage.
Well, that may be a bit much, but there
were enough thrills and slam-dunk drills to
lift Stanford (20-5, 11-3) into second place in
the Pac-10 past UCIjA and to send the crowd
home to rest its vocal cords and dream that
NCAA titles do come once every 47 years.
"Other than the Arizona game last year,
that was the best crowd I've ever seen," Stan
ford guard Scott Meniert said.
Of course, even though Stanford clinched

Good night, Cal!
Senior Todd Lichti blew past two Cal defenders and slammed the lights out with
this second-half dunk in last night's 97-71 win.
its second-straight 20-win season
for the first time since that glory
year of 1942 (running its Maples
Pavilion record to 12-0 in the
process), the coaches and players
aren't willing to even verbalize
that an NCAA-tournament berth
has been won — and as Eric
Reveno points out, maybe for good
reason.
"It's in the back of our minds,"
said the Stanford center. "We
don't talk about it much; we're
trying to keep it hush We
don't want to start dwelling on
our laurels. We got a special thing
here and we want to keep it
going."
Reveno had 17 points, second
only on Stanford to Lichti's 25,
and a team-high seven rebounds.
Howard Wright and Andrew
Vlahov also scored in double fig
ures as the Cardinal reached a
season-high in points, out
rebounded the Bears 40-27 and
only turned the ball over a season
low five times.
Admittedly, the best individual
performance in last night's Show
time unequivocally was by the
Bears' Leonard Taylor. On a night
where even the Pope would have
been booed if he were a Cal alum,
the 6-foot-8 senior center left to
a standing ovation after scoring
33 points on 13-for-20 shooting.
"Leonard played pretty
awesome," Lichti said. "I didn't
see him miss a whole lot of shots."
Taylor was being defended rela
tively well inside in the first half
— his 13 points at halftime
weren't surprising considering he
was being expected to shoulder

more of Cal's offensive load even
before teammate Matt Beeuw
saert sprained his right knee at
the 15:51 mark.
But in the second half, Taylor
took it outside, with all seven of
his baskets coming on shots of 12
feet or more.
"That hurt us a little bit," Stan
ford Coach Mike Montgomery
said.
Montgomery's comment would
have been an understatement had
Stanford not been able to heal
itself so quickly from the wounds
Taylor was inflicting.
Stanford shot out to a 9-0 lead
and finished the first half with a
15-4 run to take a 46-30 lead at
halftime, but you might as well
start running the highlight film
with 15:35 to go in the second
half.
With the score 52-38, Vlahov
stole the ball and got it out on
the fast break to Stanford point
guard Terry Taylor. Taylor imme
diately tipped it out to Lichti in
the open court, and the 6-4 guard
went up and made a reverse dunk
while being fouled by Cal's Ryan
Drew. From this vantage point, it
was simply the play of the season.
Lichti and Reveno would each
get additional slams, but the
second-place award for airborne
artistry has to go to Wright, with
an assist from Meinert. With
10:41 to go, Wright got out in
front on the break, looked over at
Meinert, pointed above the basket
and got ready to leap.
"He's just a 6-8 guy," Meinert
said. "I threw it up at the basket
and let him dunk it."

10:41 to go, Wright got out in
front on the break, looked over at
Meinert, pointed above the basket
and got ready to leap.
"He's just a 6-8 guy," Meinert
said. "I threw it up at the basket
and let him dunk it."

Freshman forward/center Adam Keefe scored eight points and grabbed six rebound* last night.
If you weren't among the 103,457 that
jammed into Maples Pavilion last night, you
missed seeing the Stanford Cardinal light up
the night and then turn out the lights.
Don't tell the fire marshal, but they were
hanging from the rafters of 7,500-seat Maples
last night, and I'm not just talking about the
crowd. The 17th-ranked Cardinal came soaring
down at California from a whole other level,
stuffing the Bears 97-71.

Men's Basketball
Cardinal 97, Golden Bears 71

Cal (17-9, 8-6 in the Pacific 10 Conference),
probably operating on the knowledge that
Stanford was a bang-it-inside, low-to-the
ground offensive team, left back in Berkeley
the anti-gravity boots it needed to rise above
the crowd's decibel level and meet the high
flying Cardinal.
Showtime at Maples erupted from the
opening tip when Stanford guard Todd Lichti
drove baseline and laid it in with the best left
hand this side of Marvelous Marvin Hagler,
and didn't stop until reserve center Derek
Bruton sunk two free throws with the poise
of Sir Lawrence Olivier orating on stage.
Well, that may be a bit much, but there
were enough thrills and slam-dunk drills to
lift Stanford (20-5, 11-3) into second place in
the Pac-10 past UCIjA and to send the crowd
home to rest its vocal cords and dream that
NCAA titles do come once every 47 years.
"Other than the Arizona game last year,
that was the best crowd I've ever seen," Stan
ford guard Scott Meniert said.
Of course, even though Stanford clinched

Good night, Cal!
Senior Todd Lichti blew past two Cal defenders and slammed the lights out with
this second-half dunk in last night's 97-71 win.
its second-straight 20-win season
for the first time since that glory
year of 1942 (running its Maples
Pavilion record to 12-0 in the
process), the coaches and players
aren't willing to even verbalize
that an NCAA-tournament berth
has been won — and as Eric
Reveno points out, maybe for good
reason.
"It's in the back of our minds,"
said the Stanford center. "We
don't talk about it much; we're
trying to keep it hush We
don't want to start dwelling on
our laurels. We got a special thing
here and we want to keep it
going."
Reveno had 17 points, second
only on Stanford to Lichti's 25,
and a team-high seven rebounds.
Howard Wright and Andrew
Vlahov also scored in double fig
ures as the Cardinal reached a
season-high in points, out
rebounded the Bears 40-27 and
only turned the ball over a season
low five times.
Admittedly, the best individual
performance in last night's Show
time unequivocally was by the
Bears' Leonard Taylor. On a night
where even the Pope would have
been booed if he were a Cal alum,
the 6-foot-8 senior center left to
a standing ovation after scoring
33 points on 13-for-20 shooting.
"Leonard played pretty
awesome," Lichti said. "I didn't
see him miss a whole lot of shots."
Taylor was being defended rela
tively well inside in the first half
— his 13 points at halftime
weren't surprising considering he
was being expected to shoulder

more of Cal's offensive load even
before teammate Matt Beeuw
saert sprained his right knee at
the 15:51 mark.
But in the second half, Taylor
took it outside, with all seven of
his baskets coming on shots of 12
feet or more.
"That hurt us a little bit," Stan
ford Coach Mike Montgomery
said.
Montgomery's comment would
have been an understatement had
Stanford not been able to heal
itself so quickly from the wounds
Taylor was inflicting.
Stanford shot out to a 9-0 lead
and finished the first half with a
15-4 run to take a 46-30 lead at
halftime, but you might as well
start running the highlight film
with 15:35 to go in the second
half.
With the score 52-38, Vlahov
stole the ball and got it out on
the fast break to Stanford point
guard Terry Taylor. Taylor imme
diately tipped it out to Lichti in
the open court, and the 6-4 guard
went up and made a reverse dunk
while being fouled by Cal's Ryan
Drew. From this vantage point, it
was simply the play of the season.
Lichti and Reveno would each
get additional slams, but the
second-place award for airborne
artistry has to go to Wright, with
an assist from Meinert. With
10:41 to go, Wright got out in
front on the break, looked over at
Meinert, pointed above the basket
and got ready to leap.
"He's just a 6-8 guy," Meinert
said. "I threw it up at the basket
