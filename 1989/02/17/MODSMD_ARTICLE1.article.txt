# Showtime! Card slams the Bears

### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
If you weren't among the 103,457 that
jammed into Maples Pavilion last night, you
missed seeing the Stanford Cardinal light up
the night and then turn out the lights.
Don't tell the fire marshal, but they were
hanging from the rafters of 7,500-seat Maples

stuffing the Bears 97-71.

Showtime at Maples erupted from the
opening tip when Stanford guard Todd Lichti
drove baseline and laid it in with the best left
hand this side of Marvelous Marvin Hagler,
and didn't stop until reserve center Derek
Bruton sunk two free throws with the poise
of Sir Lawrence Olivier orating on stage.
Well, that may be a bit much, but there
were enough thrills and slam-dunk drills to
lift Stanford (20-5, 11-3) into second place in
the Pac-10 past UCIjA and to send the crowd
home to rest its vocal cords and dream that
NCAA titles do come once every 47 years.
"Other than the Arizona game last year,
that was the best crowd I've ever seen," Stan
ford guard Scott Meniert said.
Of course, even though Stanford clinched

this second-half dunk in last night's 97-71 win.
