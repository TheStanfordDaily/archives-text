## Investigators trace Pan Am bomb 
### 
LOCKERBIE, Scotland (AP) - A
radio-cassette player held the bomb that
brought down Pan Am Flight 103, but
the identity of the bomber still is not
known, the top investigator of the
bombing said yesterday.
Investigators believe the explosive
that shattered the Boeing 747 on Dec.
21 was placed aboard the aircraft in
Frankfurt, West Germany, where the
flight began, said detective Chief Su
perintendant John Orr. It apparently
had been put on the aircraft as checked
baggage.
"New positive lines of inquiry are
unfolding," he told a news conference
in this southwestern Scottish town
where the jumbo jet crashed, killing all
259 people aboard and 11 on the ground.
"While there is insufficient evidence
at this stage to establish the identity of
the person or group responsible for this
dreadful crime, the progress made and
the evidence obtained has been substan
tial," said Orr, an investigator from
Strathclyde police, a Scottish regional
police force.
Asked whether the investigation
would point to a specific country, Orr
said: "It may."
On Feb. 8, the Jerusalem Post re
ported the bomb that destroyed the jet
was hidden in a radio-cassette recorder

"While there is insuffi
cient evidence at this
stage to establish the
identity of the person or
group responsible, the
progress made has been
substantial."

and was traced to Frankfurt.
That report quoted unidentified in
vestigators as saying the device was
similar, but not identical, to one found
earlier in the possession of members of
Ahmed Jibril's extremist Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command. The group has denied in
volvement.
Orr said the brand name of the radio
cassette player had not been established
and would not say whether it was a
pocket-sized device or a larger model.
Nor did he say whether investigators
had located the detonator.
Anti-terrorist experts have said the
explosive most likely used was Semtex,
an odorless, highly malleable substance

made in Czechoslovakia and known to
be used by terrorist organizations.
Orr said he was "aware of some
aspects of the explosive that was used"
but declined to elaborate.
The discovery of the bomb's hiding
place followed painstaking reconstruc
tion of a baggage container from pieces
— some no larger than a table knife —
strewn over 40 miles of Scottish coun
tryside.
"The reconstruction of the baggage
container suggests that the explosive
device may have been among the bag
gage from the Frankfurt flight," Orr
said.
"The particular bag which contained
the device has not been identified at
this stage, but there is the most detailed
work under way with forensic assistance
to achieve this identification. I believe
this can be done," he said.
Orr said the belief that Frankfurt
was the origin of the bomb was based
on "a balance of probabilities." Most of
the 1,500 pounds of baggage in the con
tainer in which the bomb was located
was checked in at Frankfurt.
Spokesman Jochen Schroers said such
suppositions as the statement that the
bomb "probably" came on board in
Frankfurt "don't help us at all."
