11 wounded during the two-hour
attack that began at 2 a.m.
He said the rebels had many
casualties, but he said he could
not provide figures.
The Marxist-led insurgents also
launched four bombs at the head
quarters of the 6th Army brigade
in Usulutan, 68 miles east of San
Salvador, Col. Jose Tejada said by
telephone.
They also launched four bombs
at the headquarters of the elite

Atonal battalion about a mile
from the 6th brigade, he said.
Three bombs cleared the wall
around the headquarters, but did
not explode, ho said. The one that
fell outi- di at bas i led be
side a house, wounding two
civilians, he said.
The guerrillas, in a drastic tur
nabout, offered last month to par
ticipate in this year's presidential
election and respect its result if
the vote were postponed from
March 19 to September. The
rebels had boycotted and con
demned as sham the five previous
