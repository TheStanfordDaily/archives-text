JOHANNESBURG, South
Africa (AP) — Anti-apartheid
leaders gave an unprecedented
rebuke to Winnie Mandela yester
day, saying she has betrayed the
trust of the black community and
kept bodyguards who waged a
"reign of terror" in Soweto.
The influential activists accused
Winnie Mandela, wife of jailed
African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela and once called
the "Mother of the Nation," of
"violating human rights in the
name of the struggle against
apartheid."
The strongly worded statement
was the first public repudiation
of Mandela by the senior leader
ship of the anti-apartheid move
ment. They accused her of com
plicity in the abduction and as
sault of a 14-year-old black activ

ist, Stompie Seipei, whose
decomposed body was found
dumped in Soweto last month.
Mandela, in the few public
statements she has made, denied
she was at home when the teen
ager and four men were abducted
to her house on Dec. 29 by mem
bers of a so-called soccer team
known as Mandela United who
act as her unofficial bodyguards.
But she has defended the abduc
tion, saying the four were taken
to protect them from sexual abuse
at a Methodist church residence
where they were staying in
Soweto.
The church has denied the
charge, and the anti-apartheid
leaders made their denunciation
of Mandela at the Central Meth
odist Church in Johannesburg.
Tom Sebina, a spokesman for

the African National Congress,
said from the organization's
Lusaka, Zambia, headquarters
that ANC leaders were concerned
at reports linking her with the
boy's death.
Asked if Mandela was present
when Stompie was abducted,
Sebina said: "Everybody at home
believes so."
The ANC has called on Mandela
to disband the soccer team.
Leaders of the banned United
Democratic Front, the nation's
largest opposition coalition, joined
prominent anti-apartheid lawyers
and officials of the Congress of
South African Trade Unions, the
largest black labor federation, in
reaffirming their allegiance to
Mandela while distancing them
selves from his wife.
