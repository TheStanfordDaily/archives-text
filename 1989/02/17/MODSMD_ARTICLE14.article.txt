Bush opposed to gnn control laws
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush said
yesterday he will "strongly oppose" any attempt
to outlaw semiautomatic guns, despite increasing
homicides and the use of such a weapon in a
California rampage that left five children dead.
His declaration put him at odds with his wife,
Barbara, who told The Associated Press Feb. 3
she is afraid of guns and "absolutely" believes
that assault-style weapons should be outlawed.
Spurning pleas for tougher controls, Bush said,
"No, I'm not about to do that. And I think the
answer is the criminal — do more with the
criminal."
Bush, a lifetime member of the National Rifle
Association, the nation's chief gun lobby, said
states "have a lot of laws on these things. Let
them enforce them. It's hard, very hard to do,
but that's my position and I'm not going to

change it."
Bush made his comments in an Oval Office
interview with eight reporters.
Lithuanians seek independence
MOSCOW (AP) — A Lithuanian political or
ganization that claims more than 150,000 mem
bers agreed to seek an "independent path" but
stopped shy of calling for secession from the
Soviet Union, one of its leaders said Thursday.
The action coincided with the anniversary of
Lithuania's original declaration of independence
in 1918. Hundreds of thousands of Lithuanians
turned out for two days of public celebrations.
The vote late Wednesday night by the national
assembly of the grass-roots group, Sajudis,
amounted to the strongest call yet out of the
small Baltic republic for control over its own
affairs.
