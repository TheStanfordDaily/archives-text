CowelTs AIDS testing
policy has improved,
but still needs work

COWELL STUDENT Health
Service took some steps in
the right direction this
year by changing some of its pro
cedures when testing students for
antibodies to the human im
munodeficiency virus — the
cause of AIDS.
By no longer keeping the
records of those tested, Cowell
has allayed fears for people who
were afraid of their results
leaking out. Now, hopefully, stu
dents who should be tested will
take advantage of the service.
Under the new policy, Cowell
only keeps results until those
tested come and get them. This
procedure replaces the question
able method used last spring and
summer in which test results
were kept in a confidential file
— a policy that's not always
foolproof.
While testing at Cowell might
be confidential, the center has
stopped short of providing free
and anonymous HIV antibody
testing. Such testing is available
at the Palo Alto Red Cross and
other off-campus locations but
not at Stanford. As the policy
now stands at Cowell, students
who wish to be tested must pres
ent a Stanford identification card.
In light of some recently passed
state laws, asking for anonymous
testing is not a paranoid request.
Laws which went into effect
Jan. 1 now allow doctors to re
lease HIV antibody test results
to a patient's spouse, sexual part
ner, legal representative, health
workers who deal directly with

the patient and to employees of
the patient's health care provider.
All of these people can see the
results without the patient's writ
ten consent.
At least until stronger laws are
passed to prevent discrimination
against people with AIDS,
Cowell's tests should be anony
mous.
While some of its procedures
need rethinking, Cowell has
shown increased sensitivity about
the misconceptions surrounding
the disease.
Unlike last year, when Cowell
only requested that those who
tested positive seek counseling,
the center now requires pre- and
post-test counseling for both
those who test positive and those
who test negative.
This counseling service teaches
those with negative test results
that there is still a chance that
they are carrying AIDS, since the
virus might not prompt antibody
formation for up to six months.
Cowell should also offer the
free antibody testing for anyone
who wishes to be tested. Cowell
officials now say that free testing
goes to those who have a "valid
reason." If a person does not
claim to be in a so-called "high
risk category," he or she must
pay a fee for the test.
People should not need to give
a reason for wanting to feel se
cure about their health. Some
times the issue is more complex
than just being in a "high-risk
group." Even those who are not
in "high-risk" groups may have
engaged in high-risk activities
such as unprotected intercourse
or needle-sharing.
Cowell has made some signif
icant strides; now it should follow
those steps to their logical end
by making the testing anony
mous and free for anyone.
