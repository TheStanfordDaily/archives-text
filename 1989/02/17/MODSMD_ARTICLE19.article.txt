## Protest housing shortage 
### 
STUDENTS DON'T CARE.
For that very simple reason the
University can get away with delay
ing the construction of new undergrad
uate housing until 1995 or beyond.
Students mumbled and groaned when
the University made this announcement,
complained to friends or maybe got really
upset.
But few people did anything.
What, you may ask, can I do to force
Stanford to stop putting off a project so
important to undergraduates?
I have been thinking about this prob
ilern for a few years and may have come
up with a solution.
Stanford, like most large bureau
cracies, serves a constituency. The Uni
versity is here for students, though it
seems that those running Stanford often
try very hard to ignore this reality. The
myth perpetuated here is that students
really should not have a say in how the
University spends money.
This concept is entirely ridiculous, es
pecially since student payments to Stan
ford total more than $150 million and
represent 43.2 percent of the University's
gross income.
As a consumer, each student at Stan
ford deserves to have input into how his
or her money is spent. The real problem
is that most Stanford students accept the
dictates of the administration.
After all, the housing problem is really
a question of priorities. The University
claims that it can't raise the money to
build new housing and says the students
will have to foot the bill.
According to Keith Guy, director of

Housing and Food Service, construction
of enough housing to guarantee all un
dergraduates four years of housing would
cost around $30 million.
No one doubts that Stanford has $30
million dollars. The real debate is
whether the University can afford to
spend that much of the money it does
have on new housing.
But the University is presently involved
in a fundraising campaign with a
projected goal of $1.1 billion. Of that
goal, $75 million is catagorized as "un
restricted funds." This money, unlike a
great deal of the Centennial money, is
not raised for specific uses.
The University had already raised
$48.4 million of this $75 million. Accord
ing to David Fulton, deputy to the vice
president for development, the money is
divided between $39.4 million of expen
dable funds and $13.5 million for the
unrestricted endowment.
The $39.4 million enters the Universi
ty's budget like any other revenue and
can be allocated by the provost, while
the $13.5 million will be invested and
the interest can be spent.
So we have a need for $30 million
dollars to build housing — which the
University would like to take out of stu
dents' pockets — and $39.4 million in
unrestricted funds. The solution is so
simple it's brilliant.
Why not spend the $39.4 million to
build that new dorm (with almost $10
million in change to spend on increased
funding for teaching assistants)?
Of course, the University will probably
reject this proposal. It seems a new un

dergraduate dormitory is the last item
on Stanford's wish list. Keep in mind
that the University just spent over $15
million for a new parking garage and
administrative office space.
Shaking your head at this situation
will not accomplish anything. Angrily
confronting your friend sitting across the
table from you will not accomplish any
thing.
But you can do something — pressure
the University to raise the priority of
building the housing.
I suggest that you write or call Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy and
express your discontent. His office phone
number is 723-2481, and his address is
Office of the President, Building 10, Stan
ford, California 94305.
Or, if you prefer, drop a letter off at
The Daily addressed to Kennedy, and I
will see that he receives it.
Harass until you get a response. Don't
let your opinion go unnoticed.
Changing the mind of the University
is not an easy thing, but is also not an
impossible task. If enough students fi
nally demand action on undergraduate
housing in a concerted manner, who
knows . . .
