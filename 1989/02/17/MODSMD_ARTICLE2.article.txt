## New group plans to revive grape boycott 
### Meg Jeffrey Staff writer 
Efforts to boycott table grapes at Stanford
will re-emerge next week, but the student
group spearheading the drive is no longer
MEChA, a Chicano student organization that
championed the boycott the last two years.
The Stanford Farm Worker Support Com
mittee, which organized last month independ
ently of MEChA, will begin its anti-grape cam
paign Tuesday by asking students to fast for
at least one day, collect donations and refuse
to buy or eat table grapes.
The committee will back the six-year-old
nationwide grape boycott called for by the
United Farm Workers union, but it will depart
from the tactics previously used by MEChA.
This year's support committee campaign
will avoid asking groups to ban grapes and
will promote "individual responsibility."
The committee supports the three demands
of the UFW:
• "free and fair union representation for farm
workers and good faith bargaining,
• "a joint UFW-grower program for testing
pesticide residues in grapes in the market
place, and
• "a ban on the five most dangerous pesticides
used in growing grnpes."
Last year MEChA asked each dormitory to
vote for University Food Service to stop serv
ing table grapes, but its efforts disintegrated

amid charges that the group failed to live up
to its commitment to fairly present both sides
of the issue as it had promised.
MEChA supported the grape boycott as a
way of seeking better working conditions for
grape workers, many of whom are Latino.
"It's part of our culture, part of our history
. . . they're our people," explained Moira Her
nandez, a MEChA representative.
Because of this, the boycott was generally
perceived as a race issue. Its lack of student
support may have been related to the lack of
support for other minority causes last year.
MEChA co-chair Delia Ibarra explained that
MEChA dropped the issue this year because
of other time commitments but predicted that
the group would back the support committee's
and the UFW's demands.
Accusing the UFW of "holding the (table
grape) industry hostage" with "politics of hys
terics," Grape Workers and Farmers Coalition
representative Adam Ortega asserted yester
day that the union has "not found one case
(in which) grapes had illegal levels of pes
ticide."
Ortega also charged the union with "hypoc
risy" for "engaging in collective bargaining
with growers of other produce which use
chemicals it has targeted."
Support committee organizer Paul Baer, a
Stanford alumnus and University employee,
acknowledged that, "There is a sense in which
it (the pesticide issue) is being sold as a scare.

We're trying to focus on the working rights
. . . and health rights of workers . . . and only
thirdly whether grapes are in the stores."
While the state Agricultural Labor Relations
Board guarantees workers the rights to or
ganize and vote, the UFW claims that the
legislation is not being enforced.
In December, Loren Rusk, a graduate stu
dent in English who is a member of the support
committee, independently raised more than
$700 for the UFW through pledges she col
lected while fasting.
Why grapes? "You have to pick one item
to make a demonstrable effect," Rusk said.
She added that table grapes are particularly
susceptible to residues of pesticide because
they have a large surface area. Growers also
spray table grapes, and not wine or raisin
grapes, with "cosmetic" sprays that improve
the appearance of the grape.
While acknowledging that some in the
agriculture industry may be violating child
labor laws and laws protecting worker safety,
Ortega said, "We (grape growers) are being
made to answer for every little thing that
people are involved in. It's not fair."
A similar UFW boycott in the 1960s was
instrumental in establishing workers' rights
through the labor relations board. For the
last six years the UFW has tried to recapture
the success of the '60s boycott, and this sum
mer several national figures, including the
Rev. Jesse Jackson, demonstrated support.
