Condemnation of
sexist fliers needed
Mike Rubenstein's Feb. 10 letter
argues that: l)"It is not a universal
value that female objectification [unlike
racism] is a dangerous evil," and there
fore 2) "the authorities" should censor
expressions of racism, but not expres
sions of the objectification of women.
In response to Rubenstein's first
point, the popularity of an opinion is
no indication of its validity. No one
should condone the exploitative objec
tification of women just because many
people passively accept it. Passive ac
ceptance is a large part of the problem
of sexism.
Both racism and the objectification
of women (and of men, for that mat
ter) denigrate the basic dignity of
human beings. We must not establish
a popularity-based double standard in
dealing with these two vices.
Rubenstein strongly defends the right
to free speech. We agree with him.
Censorship of the expression of ideas
has no place in a free society. Oddly,
though, Rubenstein is in favor of cen
sorship if a problem is serious enough,
as is the case with racism.
We must all employ other methods
for the eradication of ideological vice.
We must wield social pressure, not
institutional coercion. Moral disap
proval is entirely consistent with free
speech; free speech means the right to
speak one's mind with impunity from
institutional coercion, not from em
phatic social condemnation.
We are calling for emphatic con
demnation of the objectification of
human beings as marketing tools. How
can those of us who understand this as
a problem combat it? We advocate
methods of constructive confrontation,
methods which aim to inform and act
to change.
For example, we could organize a
boycott of the next party whose ads
objectify people and could simultane-

ously publish a letter of explanation.
Such a letter must emphasize clearly
that the ad campaign, and not the
party or its sponsor, is at fault.
Raising public consciousness, force
fully demonstrating our moral con
demnation and striking at the individ
ual manifestations of sexist objectifica
tion are our best hope to eradicate the
problem.

Letter did not
advocate censorship
Mike Rubenstein's Feb. 10 letter
misconstrues the argument we ad
vanced in our Feb. 6 letter, "AE Pi
party flier objectified women." He puts
words in our mouths.
We certainly never implied that the
AE Pi members "condone rape.** More
over, it is not our belief that all
"members of AE Pi view women as
objects," at least not on a personal
level. These people, we hope and be
lieve, have female friends whom they
do not regard as mere objects.
Our letter did not call for censor
ship; it did draw attention to an action
that we found dangerous and reprehen
sible. While some may indeed disagree
that objectification has harmful conse
?uences for both women and men, we
irmly believe that it does.
It was Rubenstein who originally
drew the comparison between objec
tification and racism, yet we think the
comparison is a valid and useful one.
There was a time, for example, when
not everyone agreed that racism was a
"dangerous evil." In order to make any
progress toward today's less racist sod

ety, someone has had to continually
explain that racism is an evil that
harms us all.
Rubenstein confuses condemnation
with censorship. "Consider what would
happen if every time somebody was
offended we violently condemned the
offending party," he urges us. He tells
us the result would "be shutting out
voices that have a basic right to be
heard."
Does Rubenstein mean that it is not
only wrong to censor the fliers, but
that it is also wrong to condemn
them? We hope not. Does Rubenstein
think that those who condemned rac
ism before such an attitude became
widely accepted were pushing for the
same "closed-mindedness and denial of
fundamental civil rights" he accuses us
of?

AE Pi is learning
from flier incident
On behalf of the Alpha Epsilon Pi
Fraternity, we are replying to the con
cerns of Students Against Sexism about
our "Only the Good Die Young" party
flier. We would first like to express our
regret for having upset members of the
community. We did not realize the
negative implications our actions would
have.
Secondly, while some in the house do
not necessarily agree with the view
point of SAS, we do respect it. We
hope this incident will give Stanford
students the opportunity to make con
scientious, rational decisions towards
what constitutes sexism.
As a fraternity, we have had to ex
amine our own views toward this often
overlooked issue. Discussing this mat
ter at length among ourselves has
given us much greater insight into the
questions involved in the issue.

At our next weekly meeting, we will
again bring up the issue and explore
possible programs to further educate
not only members of our house, but
the entire community as well.
We thank SAS for pushing us to do
this. I hope this will be a learning
experience for all parties involved. In
closing, I would like to thank the
Women's Center and especially SAS for
voicing their opinions.

flier reproductions
As a member of the only campus
group that has benefited from the
reprinting of fliers in The Daily, I
must take exception to the reprinting
of Schiff House's "Bare Essentials Bash
II" flier.
This was the first reprinting of a
flier which did not indirectly promote a
campus band â€” thus from my narrow
viewpoint the reprinting served no
useful purpose.
The Electric Monks do not condone
excessive alcohol intake or the objec
tification of the opposite sex's bodies,
but we do accept unsolicited advertis
ing for our band.
I wish all of you had better things
to do with your time, but if you choose
to continue your absurd preoccupation
with party fliers, and The Daily contin
ues to reprint these fliers, at least this
band manager will spend less time
advertising his group and more time
attending to his pressing academic
workload. This after all should be
every student's foremost concern.

flier reproductions
As a member of the only campus
group that has benefited from the
reprinting of fliers in The Daily, I
must take exception to the reprinting
of Schiff House's "Bare Essentials Bash
II" flier.
This was the first reprinting of a
flier which did not indirectly promote a
campus band â€” thus from my narrow
viewpoint the reprinting served no
useful purpose.
The Electric Monks do not condone
excessive alcohol intake or the objec
tification of the opposite sex's bodies,
but we do accept unsolicited advertis
ing for our band.
I wish all of you had better things
to do with your time, but if you choose
to continue your absurd preoccupation
with party fliers, and The Daily contin
ues to reprint these fliers, at least this
band manager will spend less time
advertising his group and more time
attending to his pressing academic
workload. This after all should be
every student's foremost concern.

Condemnation of
sexist fliers needed
Mike Rubenstein's Feb. 10 letter
argues that: l)"It is not a universal
value that female objectification [unlike
racism] is a dangerous evil," and there
fore 2) "the authorities" should censor
expressions of racism, but not expres
sions of the objectification of women.
In response to Rubenstein's first
point, the popularity of an opinion is
no indication of its validity. No one
should condone the exploitative objec
tification of women just because many
people passively accept it. Passive ac
ceptance is a large part of the problem
of sexism.
Both racism and the objectification
of women (and of men, for that mat
ter) denigrate the basic dignity of
human beings. We must not establish
a popularity-based double standard in
dealing with these two vices.
Rubenstein strongly defends the right
to free speech. We agree with him.
Censorship of the expression of ideas
has no place in a free society. Oddly,
though, Rubenstein is in favor of cen
sorship if a problem is serious enough,
as is the case with racism.
We must all employ other methods
for the eradication of ideological vice.
We must wield social pressure, not
institutional coercion. Moral disap
proval is entirely consistent with free
speech; free speech means the right to
speak one's mind with impunity from
institutional coercion, not from em
phatic social condemnation.
We are calling for emphatic con
demnation of the objectification of
human beings as marketing tools. How
can those of us who understand this as
a problem combat it? We advocate
methods of constructive confrontation,
methods which aim to inform and act
to change.
For example, we could organize a
boycott of the next party whose ads
objectify people and could simultane-

ously publish a letter of explanation.
Such a letter must emphasize clearly
that the ad campaign, and not the
party or its sponsor, is at fault.
Raising public consciousness, force
fully demonstrating our moral con
demnation and striking at the individ
ual manifestations of sexist objectifica
tion are our best hope to eradicate the
problem.

Letter did not
advocate censorship
Mike Rubenstein's Feb. 10 letter
misconstrues the argument we ad
vanced in our Feb. 6 letter, "AE Pi
party flier objectified women." He puts
words in our mouths.
We certainly never implied that the
AE Pi members "condone rape.** More
over, it is not our belief that all
"members of AE Pi view women as
objects," at least not on a personal
level. These people, we hope and be
lieve, have female friends whom they
do not regard as mere objects.
Our letter did not call for censor
ship; it did draw attention to an action
that we found dangerous and reprehen
sible. While some may indeed disagree
that objectification has harmful conse
?uences for both women and men, we
irmly believe that it does.
It was Rubenstein who originally
drew the comparison between objec
tification and racism, yet we think the
comparison is a valid and useful one.
There was a time, for example, when
not everyone agreed that racism was a
"dangerous evil." In order to make any
progress toward today's less racist sod

ety, someone has had to continually
explain that racism is an evil that
harms us all.
Rubenstein confuses condemnation
with censorship. "Consider what would
happen if every time somebody was
offended we violently condemned the
offending party," he urges us. He tells
us the result would "be shutting out
voices that have a basic right to be
heard."
Does Rubenstein mean that it is not
only wrong to censor the fliers, but
that it is also wrong to condemn
them? We hope not. Does Rubenstein
think that those who condemned rac
ism before such an attitude became
widely accepted were pushing for the
same "closed-mindedness and denial of
fundamental civil rights" he accuses us
of?

AE Pi is learning
from flier incident
On behalf of the Alpha Epsilon Pi
Fraternity, we are replying to the con
cerns of Students Against Sexism about
our "Only the Good Die Young" party
flier. We would first like to express our
regret for having upset members of the
community. We did not realize the
negative implications our actions would
have.
Secondly, while some in the house do
not necessarily agree with the view
point of SAS, we do respect it. We
hope this incident will give Stanford
students the opportunity to make con
scientious, rational decisions towards
what constitutes sexism.
As a fraternity, we have had to ex
amine our own views toward this often
overlooked issue. Discussing this mat
ter at length among ourselves has
given us much greater insight into the
questions involved in the issue.

At our next weekly meeting, we will
again bring up the issue and explore
possible programs to further educate
not only members of our house, but
the entire community as well.
We thank SAS for pushing us to do
this. I hope this will be a learning
experience for all parties involved. In
closing, I would like to thank the
Women's Center and especially SAS for
voicing their opinions.
