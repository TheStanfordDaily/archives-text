## An evolving art form Skateboarders combat misunderstanding 
### Mark Weiner Staff writer 
Hank Scotch is young, energetic
and hates double standards.
Pretty normal for a 17 year-old.
But Hank is different (why else
would he be caught in the middle
of so much controversy?). Wearing
sweats, white hightops and a
green hat, the Palo Alto High
School senior has something going
against him.
He rides a skateboard.
He's not alone. By some es
timates, there are more than 20
million skateboarders in the
United States, and many of them
are now the focus of intense public
debate. From New York to Cali
fornia, skateboarders are trying
to hold their own against what
they perceive to be middle-aged
misunderstanding and just plain
sour grapes.
You've probably seen them here
on campus. You just don't know
their names.
I didn't until I met Hank.
Hank is one of the most politi
cally active skateboarders in Palo
Alto. With friends and sympa
thetic adults, he got the city to
legalize skateboarding in the
street.
The Palo Alto City Council
voted Feb. 13 to direct the City
Attorney to revise a Palo Alto Mu
nicipal Code that currently
prohibits skateboarding in road
ways. Skateboarding on sidewalks
will still be illegal in business dis
tricts and in city parking lots.
This means that once the new
code takes effect, Hank can skate
pretty much wherever he wants
— witnout tear oi being harrassed
by police.
Of course, Hank skated in the
street before anyway. He just took
heat. After all, skateboarding is
what Hank loves. It's his
livelihood.
"Skateboarding is a totally cre
ative sport," he tells me earnestly
one sunny afternoon, before the
City Council meeting. "When you
jam, you can just let loose. I can't
think of any other sport where
you can use your mind like you
can when you're going around
skateboarding. You get such a
high, such a huge high."
Since 1973, when smooth-riding
polyurethane wheels hit the mar
ketplace, skateboarding has

evolved to the point where it really
is a kind of art. Where skateboar
ders used to ride in a straight line
from place to place, today many
see what used to be obstacles —
a fire hydrant, a bench, a set of
stairs, even a wall — as challenges,
as places upon which they can
inscribe their own personal style.
Where in the past a skateboar
der would have ridden around a
fire hydrant, the contemporary
"street skater" might jump over
it while keeping his feet firmly
planted on his board (a maneuver
called an "ollie"). If he sees a
bench, he might slide along its
edge. He might skate down a stair
way handrail. He might even ride
straight up a wall.
"There are physics teachers in
my school who don't understand
how it can be done," says Hank.
The object is to transform a
mundane landscape into a chal
lenging obstacle course.
You can imagine the appeal. It's
this kind of excitement that's
spawned a multi-million dollar in
dustry — replete with its own
nationally-circulated magazines
("Thrasher" is the most popular)
— and attracted a following that
cuts across age, class and ethnic
lines. Although there are excep
tions, skateboarding is still pretty
much a male sport.
Stanford, of course, with its
smooth slopes, contours, ramps,
benches and loading zones, is
Skateboard 'Jden.
"[Stanford] is perfect," says
Hank. "It's a [street skating] prac
tice playground. There are so
many great places to go. You can
utilize everything."
Hank especially likes to skate
here because he doesn't really get
hassled. For one, the University
has no specific policy regarding
skateboarders. The most Stanford
police can do is tell them to go
away. That means no tickets.
But more importantly, at Stan
ford, Hank feels himself among
equals. Here, he can escape an
adult world of double standards.
"[Stanford] is so open," he says.
"Everyone here is sort of a peer.
They're not a lot of hostile adults.
This is the place where you get
the least amount of flak — that's
the main appeal."
He tells me two stories.
In one, a prominent Palo Alto
City Council member criticizes

skating in the street as being dan
gerous. Later, she receives a ticket
while riding her bike.
In the other, Hank and his
friends are skating in a relatively
deserted underground parking ga
rage. A man enters and opens the
door to his BMW. Then, he begins
shouting, telling Hank and his
friends to leave, that they don't
belong, that what they're doing
is illegal.
Hank walks up to the man and
asks, "What about that ticket on
your window?"
"That's none of your damn
business!" the man shouts.
At Stanford, skateboarders like
Hank feel they can escape this
kind of hypocrisy.
WTien we spoke, Hank told me
over and over how important
skateboarding was to his life. He
told me how it provided a bond
with his friends and common
ground with skateboarders of any

class and color, anywhere.
He even showed me his shoes,
which had holes in them from
skateboarding so often.
After the City Council decided
to change its law, Hank and I
walked outside. There are mo
ments in life when you experience
a rare and powerful self-respect,
a sense of your own ability to
remake circumstances. Hank was
experiencing one of those mo
ments.
It was 10 at night, the streets
were empty, the streets were open,
and there was a visceral, gut
feeling of accomplishment, auton
omy and identity.
Now he and his friends could
skate in those streets without
being branded criminals. Not
everyone in the community would
approve — they would still en
counter opposition and hostility
— but they would have the law
to back them up.

United States, and many of them
are now the focus of intense public
debate. From New York to Cali
fornia, skateboarders are trying
to hold their own against what
they perceive to be middle-aged
misunderstanding and just plain
sour grapes.
You've probably seen them here
on campus. You just don't know
their names.
I didn't until I met Hank.
Hank is one of the most politi
cally active skateboarders in Palo
Alto. With friends and sympa
thetic adults, he got the city to
legalize skateboarding in the
street.
The Palo Alto City Council
voted Feb. 13 to direct the City
Attorney to revise a Palo Alto Mu
nicipal Code that currently
prohibits skateboarding in road
ways. Skateboarding on sidewalks
will still be illegal in business dis
tricts and in city parking lots.
This means that once the new
code takes effect, Hank can skate
pretty much wherever he wants
— witnout tear oi being harrassed
by police.
Of course, Hank skated in the
street before anyway. He just took
heat. After all, skateboarding is
what Hank loves. It's his
livelihood.
"Skateboarding is a totally cre
ative sport," he tells me earnestly
one sunny afternoon, before the
City Council meeting. "When you
jam, you can just let loose. I can't
think of any other sport where
you can use your mind like you
can when you're going around
skateboarding. You get such a
high, such a huge high."
Since 1973, when smooth-riding
polyurethane wheels hit the mar
ketplace, skateboarding has

evolved to the point where it really
is a kind of art. Where skateboar
ders used to ride in a straight line
from place to place, today many
see what used to be obstacles —
a fire hydrant, a bench, a set of
stairs, even a wall — as challenges,
as places upon which they can
inscribe their own personal style.
Where in the past a skateboar
der would have ridden around a
fire hydrant, the contemporary
"street skater" might jump over
it while keeping his feet firmly
planted on his board (a maneuver
called an "ollie"). If he sees a
bench, he might slide along its
edge. He might skate down a stair
way handrail. He might even ride
straight up a wall.
"There are physics teachers in
my school who don't understand
how it can be done," says Hank.
The object is to transform a
mundane landscape into a chal
lenging obstacle course.
You can imagine the appeal. It's
this kind of excitement that's
spawned a multi-million dollar in
dustry — replete with its own
nationally-circulated magazines
("Thrasher" is the most popular)
— and attracted a following that
cuts across age, class and ethnic
lines. Although there are excep
tions, skateboarding is still pretty
much a male sport.
Stanford, of course, with its
smooth slopes, contours, ramps,
benches and loading zones, is
Skateboard 'Jden.
"[Stanford] is perfect," says
Hank. "It's a [street skating] prac
tice playground. There are so
many great places to go. You can
utilize everything."
Hank especially likes to skate
here because he doesn't really get
hassled. For one, the University
has no specific policy regarding
skateboarders. The most Stanford
police can do is tell them to go
away. That means no tickets.
But more importantly, at Stan
ford, Hank feels himself among
equals. Here, he can escape an
adult world of double standards.
"[Stanford] is so open," he says.
"Everyone here is sort of a peer.
They're not a lot of hostile adults.
This is the place where you get
the least amount of flak — that's
the main appeal."
He tells me two stories.
In one, a prominent Palo Alto
City Council member criticizes

skating in the street as being dan
gerous. Later, she receives a ticket
while riding her bike.
In the other, Hank and his
friends are skating in a relatively
deserted underground parking ga
rage. A man enters and opens the
door to his BMW. Then, he begins
shouting, telling Hank and his
friends to leave, that they don't
belong, that what they're doing
is illegal.
Hank walks up to the man and
asks, "What about that ticket on
your window?"
"That's none of your damn
business!" the man shouts.
At Stanford, skateboarders like
Hank feel they can escape this
kind of hypocrisy.
WTien we spoke, Hank told me
over and over how important
skateboarding was to his life. He
told me how it provided a bond
with his friends and common
ground with skateboarders of any

class and color, anywhere.
He even showed me his shoes,
which had holes in them from
skateboarding so often.
After the City Council decided
to change its law, Hank and I
walked outside. There are mo
ments in life when you experience
a rare and powerful self-respect,
a sense of your own ability to
remake circumstances. Hank was
experiencing one of those mo
ments.
It was 10 at night, the streets
were empty, the streets were open,
and there was a visceral, gut
feeling of accomplishment, auton
omy and identity.
Now he and his friends could
skate in those streets without
being branded criminals. Not
everyone in the community would
approve — they would still en
counter opposition and hostility
— but they would have the law
to back them up.

Hank Scotch, a 17 year-old "street skater," considers Stanford a

Hank Scotch is young, energetic
and hates double standards.
Pretty normal for a 17 year-old.
But Hank is different (why else
would he be caught in the middle
of so much controversy?). Wearing
sweats, white hightops and a

School senior has something going
against him.
He rides a skateboard.
