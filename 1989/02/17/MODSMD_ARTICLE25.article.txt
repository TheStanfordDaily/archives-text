# Bug: winds of freedom blowing across campus
## 
### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
A lot of people have been asking
whether or not the Bug is upset
by the addition of the Science Bug
to The Daily's illustrious insect
collection.
Well, the Bug puts it simply but
firmly: He expects that no loyal
fan of Bug Me (whether electric
or hand-held) would even think
of reading the Science Bug, unless
he or she wants to.
Considering that the two
columns are nearly identical, it is
understandable that the Bug
might feel some competition from
his Mr. Wizard counterpart. But
if you try hard you may be able
to distinguish the vital disparity
between the two:
1) The Science Bug welcomes
questions from The Daily's read
ership and answers them in a
straightforward manner which
can be both understood by the
layperson (as well as the virgin)
and appreciated by the sophisti
cated scientist.
2) The Bug welcomes questions
from The Daily's readership and
answers them in a straightback
ward manner which he can't even
understand himself.
Dear Bug,
Every so often I see a Stanford
emblem or seal with a German
motto encircling the tree instead
of the usual "Leland Stanford
Junior University/Organized
1891." What's the story behind
this emblem ?
— Samuel Gompers
Well, it depends what book it's
on the cover of. But seriously, I
didn't even know there was a
Stanford seal. Of course, I haven't
been down to the Hopkins Marine
Station lately, 50...
The German motto of which
you write reads "Die Luft Der
Freiheit Weht," and is translated
as "The winds of freedom are
blowing."
Stanford's first president, David
Starr Jordan, adopted the phrase
as the motto for the President's
Seal. However, it is considered un
official and Bob Hamrdla of the
President's Office says that al
though it has not been officially
eradicated from association with
the president, neither does such
the seal appear on any offical

presidential materials.
An article on the seal in a 1962
Stanford Alumni Review provided
information as to the history of
the phrase itself, which was first
penned by 16th century German
satirist Ulrich Von Hutten.
Von Hutten led a brief, difficult
and committed life as a writer
whose aim was to decry the tyran
nical governments of his time. He
was born in 1488, and the phrase
first appeared in Latin in this sen
tence: "Can ye not see that the

winds of freedom are blowing;
that men are wearied of the pres
ent state of things and want to
bring about a change."
Of course, as far as we know,
he may have just been jotting this
phrase down after seeing it on a
TV commercial or hearing a friend
say it. And speaking of Latin
phrases which would make good
University mottos allow me to
propose "Semper Übi Sub Übi,"
a nice soundin' little sentence
which speaks great wisdom: Al
ways Where Under Where.
Incidentally, the Alumni Review
article also mentioned that the
tree adorning the Stanford seal is
based on an actual tree which at
the time of the article's printing
still stood on the bank of the Spn
Francisquito Creek, but the I&ig
couldn't care less if it is still thare
now and so didn't bother to check.
Until next week, die Bug der
freiheit weht.
