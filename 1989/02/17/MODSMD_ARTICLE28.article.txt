## Gymnasts host first meet 
### 
Tomorrow at Maples Pavil
ion, Stanford's men's gymnas
tics team will face UC-Santa
Barbara in its first home meet
of the year.
The 2 p.m. competition will
showcase some of the nation's
finest gymnasts as the Cardi
nal (5-2) attempt to avenge an
early season loss at Santa Bar
bara. Stanford senior Scott
Schaffer does not expect that
to be a problem for the Cardi
nal and dismissed the first
meet's outcome as a fluke.
"That was not really a fair
meet," Schaffer said, "Our
team was short-handed due to
injuries and we performed
poorly on top of that."
The Cardinal scored only
261.7 points at that meet.
Schaffer predicted that the
team should be able to total
about 270 points tomorrow af
ternoon.
Stanford, however, is still not
at full strength. Junior co
captain Adam Forman will
probably not compete due to a
shoulder iryury and freshman
Tim Ryan, another of the
team's vital performers, is
hampered by a forearm ir\jury
which will limit his effective
ness.
Despite these injuries Schaf
fer said that the Cardinal's su
perior depth should give it an
edge. The Gauchos are led by
three excellent all-around gym
nasts but lack the supporting
cast necessary for a strong
team score.
Conrad Voorsanger will lead
the way individually for Stan
ford but will find competition
for the meet's all-around title
from Santa Barbara's David
Stow. The high bar routines
of Voorsanger and teammate
Tim Wang, along with
Voorsanger's pommel horse
and Schaffer's work on the still
rings, promise to be among the
competition's highlights.

Track team travels
to meet in Seattle
Stanford's track team will be
competing at Washington Sun

day in what is perhaps the
strangest part of their schedule
— indoor track and field.
This Sunday they will fly to
Seattle and move straight in
doors to the track without even
exposing themselves to the cold
Seattle weather. Last year the
team was held up at the airport
for several hours by fog.
As long as that's where the
competition is, however, the
Cardinal will continue to forego
the usually friendly Bay Area
weather in search of track
meets.
This will be the first team
event for the Cardinal this
season as they will be fielding
a full indoor team of 36 ath
letes for the first time.
"The team is in exceptional
condition for February", ac
cording to Asst. Coach Scott
Chisam. For most of the team
members, Sunday will be the
first official competition of the
season.
The Cardinal have sent lim
ited squads to Michigan, Min
nesota and Louisiana State this
year. Senior Patty Purpur, a
perenial All-American since
coming to the Farm, has had
the best indoor season so far.
With a 51' 9" throw in the
indoor shotput, she has already
qualified for the NCAA indoor
and outdoor championships.
Freshman Christie Gains
has been running wild in the
women's sprints. Gains, consid
ered the best high school
sprinter in the country over the
past two years, may prove to
be the best women's sprinter
in Stanford history. Last year
she ran 11.50 seconds in the
100-meter dash and 23.13 in
the 200-meter dash to set na
tional high school records,
marks that would establish
new Stanford records if dupli
cated.
The men's team will be
bolstered by several members
of the football team. Standout
running back Jon Volpe will be
doing the 55-meter sprints
before spring football starts.
Slotback Charlie Young and de
fensive back Rick Davis also
run for the Cardinal.
