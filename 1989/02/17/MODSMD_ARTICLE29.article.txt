# Rowdy crowd yields victory
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Last night, somewhere in these
United States, a high school junior
with a good jumper and a high
GPA tuned his television to ESPN
at 8:30 p.m. Pacific Standard
Time.
And, sometime in the next two
hours, as he watched the Cardinal
romp past California, that kid
must have said, "I'm going to
Stanford!"
With that, the Cardinal avenged
one of its five losses on the season
and collected its 20th win.
When the teams met previously
on Jan. 19, the Cardinal let the
screaming Harmon Arena crowd
affect their play.
"We gave into their aggressive
ness," said Todd Lichti last night
of the first contest.
Not this time. Instead, the
Maples Pavilion crowd, which is
proving to be one of the toughest
crowds in the land and is in no
small part responsible for the
team's 12-0 home record, inspired
the Cardinal from even before the
opening tip.
The student section's jumping
caused the springy Maples floor
to undulate several feet up and
down and the noise during the
introductions was so loud it
practically drowned out the PA
announcer.
After the Cardinal controlled
the tip, Terry Taylor got the ball
to Todd Lichti. He drove to the
baseline, layed it in and the crowd
let out a roar that was heard all
the way in Dubuque, Detroit,
Duluth and anywhere there's
cable television.
"Other than Arizona last year,
the crowd was the best I've ever
seen it," Scott Meinert said.

Other than Arizona
last year, the crowd
was the best I've ever
seen it.'

Said Coach Mike Montgomery:
"There's no reason why we can't
have this kind of crowd all the
time....
"I think we could," he added.
It was the kind of crowd that
takes the visitors out of the game
before they knew what hit them.
Outside of the incredible Leonard
Taylor (who said, "Ever since high
school I've loved to play against
away crowds. You learn to shut
them out") the rest of the Bears
seemed out of joint.
Roy Fisher, a double-figures
scorer, managed only four points
and committed five turnovers
before fouling out. Keith Smith
made 4-of-13 shots. Eric
McDonough turned the ball over
twice for every point he scored.
And the Cardinal thrived on the
intense atmosphere. Slam dunks,
alley-oops, 3-pointers and the like
provided the razzle-dazzle and
each spectacular play elicited a
roar from the crowd.
Who knows? If it keeps up,
there may be a lot of those kids
watching TV and thinking the
same thing. Maybe then those T
shirts will read: "A lot more than
once every 47 years."
