# Rowdy crowd yields victory
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Last night, somewhere in these
United States, a high school junior
with a good jumper and a high
GPA tuned his television to ESPN
at 8:30 p.m. Pacific Standard
Time.
And, sometime in the next two
hours, as he watched the Cardinal
romp past California, that kid
must have said, "I'm going to
Stanford!"
With that, the Cardinal avenged
one of its five losses on the season
and collected its 20th win.
When the teams met previously
on Jan. 19, the Cardinal let the
screaming Harmon Arena crowd
affect their play.
"We gave into their aggressive
ness," said Todd Lichti last night
of the first contest.
Not this time. Instead, the
Maples Pavilion crowd, which is
proving to be one of the toughest
crowds in the land and is in no
small part responsible for the
team's 12-0 home record, inspired
the Cardinal from even before the
opening tip.
