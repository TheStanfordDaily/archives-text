# Men spikers emerging from women's shadow
## 
### 
If you do not happen to have
an older 9ibling, for a few mo
ments please hypothetically
place yourself into a family with
one. Trust me, things will make
more sense this way

Now, imagine that this hypo
thetical brother or sister (for the
sake of argument, we'll say sister)
is the pride and joy of the school
you both attend. You are always
compared to her, always referred
to as "her brother," even though
your accomplishments are almost
as impressive.
She ranks second in her class
of 265, while you rank fifth in a
slightly smaller one. She perenni
ally misses the award for Student
of the Year by the narrowist of
margins, while you typically get
bypassed by especially qualified

individuals amid your highly
competitive class.
In a word, you are eclipsed by
your sibling. Only a mtyor ac
complishment on your part, cou
pled with a sub-par year by your
sister, could finally erase the
shadow you are forced to live un
der.
Switch back to reality. You now
understand the magnitude of the
Stanford men's volleyball team's
achievements this season.
For years, the squad has lived
in the shadow of its older sister,
the perennially powerful women's
team. With this season as the sole
blemish to its postseason record,
Stanford has appeared in all six
previous Final Fours, an NCAA
record and a phenomenal feat.
However, with its 5-1 Western
Intercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion start, good for first in the
league and a No. 4 national
ranking, the Cardinal men have
finally stepped out from the dark
ness and now stand alone.
The men, at least for winter
and spring, have become the Stan
ford volleyball team.
The transformation began
two weeks ago with the
Hawaii matches. After
dropping the first of a two-match

series with the nation's top
ranked team, the Cardinal
rebounded the following evening
to outlast the Rainbow-Warriors
in a five-game marathon. Maples
Pavilion has not seen a finer
match in years.
From one uphill battle to the
next, the Cardinal hit the road
last weekend for perhaps the
toughest trip of the year. Facing
Cal State-Northridge, USC and
UC-Santa Barbara on their own
courts, Coach Fred Sturm set his
hopes on a two-out-of-three week
end.
The team outdid him by one.
After blowing out the Matadors
in a crushing three-game match,
the Cardinal bested the defending
NCAA champion Trojans in four
and outlasted the No. 3 Gauchos
in a five-game marathon.
Five top-20 teams, five wins â€”
Stanford is clearly the team to be
beaten. Though the ever-modest
Sturm would hesitate to admit it,
the Cardinal has evolved into one
of the national powers. From
fighting to beat the big teams, it
has become one of them.
Saturday night, a shell
shocked Northridge comes
to Stanford for a rematch.
Their star player Bob Samuelson,

benched during the last Cardinal-
Matador meeting, might well be
back. Even if not, revenge will be
a sufficient motivator for
transcendent play.
Even so, the Matadors will most
probably leave Maples with their
red carpets draped over their
heads. With Ail-American Dan
Hanan and Olympic gold medalist
Scott Fortune spearheading a
deadly Stanford arsenal,
Northridge will have to be the
Miracles in order to upset the suc
cessful Cardinal.
Championship-caliber men's
volleyball has finally arrived on
the Farm. As long as the players
play with confidence and not
cockiness, Stanford could have its
best season ever.
With a lot of work and good
Fortune (pun unfortunately in
tended), the Cardinal men's squad
might even surpass its talented
sister. Even if not, the team has
at least extricated itself from over
shadowing.
As any younger sibling would
attest to, that is perhaps the
nicest feeling of all.
