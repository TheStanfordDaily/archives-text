### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
The reigning singles champion
of the Northern California Inter
collegiate Championships won't
be able to defend his title at the
42nd annual event, held this Sat
urday through Tuesday at San
Jose State.
Stanford junior Jeff Tarango,
who defeated teammate Patrick
McEnroe 6-2, 1-6, 7-6 (7-5 in the
tiebreaker) last year at Stanford
Tennis Stadium to take the title,
is seeded No. 1 in this year's tour
ney, but will not compete in order
to rest his left wrist, which he
iryured in practice last month.
"We want to rest his wrist be
cause we've got the Team Indoors
[at Louisville next weekl coming
up," Stanford Asst. Coach John
Whitlinger said. "I'm sure he'll
be OK."
Even without the services of the
defending champ, Stanford still
has an excellent chance of bring
ing home both the singles and
doubles crowns. Four of the tour

ney's first 10 seeds will be wearing
cardinal and white.
Sophomore Martin Blackman,
recovered from a stiff back that
forced him to withdraw from the
team's dual match at San Jose
State on Tuesday, is the No. 3
seed behind California's Woody
Hunt. Jeff Cathrall and Glenn
Solomon are seeded fifth and
seventh, respectively, and Alex
O'Brien is at No. 10.
The Cardinal singles contingent
is rounded out by Curtis Dunn,
seeded 11th, and Barry Richards.

Not unlike the Stanford Cardi
nal, the Pepperdine women's ten
nis team has often resembled the
walking wounded this season.
"There's been only one day dur
ing the whole year when we've
had everyone for practice," Pep
perdine Asst. Coach Alan Hopkins
said.
But as the Waves come into the
Stanford Tennis Stadium today,
they are in fairly good health.
Led by All-Americans Ginger
Helgeson and Janna Kovacevich,
Pepperdine presents the Cardinal
with their toughest test of the
season so far. The Waves were
22-4 last season and reached the
second round of the NCAAs before
losing to perennial power Florida.
Ever cautious, Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan said his team
wasn't overlooking the match.
Brennan noted that at the Rolex
Tournament, Helgeson reached
the quarterfinals and Kovacevich
made it to the finals of the con

solation bracket.
Brennan added that was a bet
ter showing than either UCLA or
use.
The Waves also bring in two
Swedish imports who are making
their marks. Anna Brunstrom and
Camilla Ohrman are two of the
team's hardest workers.
"It's always nice to play Stan
ford," he added. "Ail our girls get
to play a quality opponent.
"It's a good way for [theml to
judge themselves . . . they're
hoping to do well and to work on
some thingß," Hopkins said.
For the Cardinal's part, the
match is a chance for the team
to play at nearly full strength.
