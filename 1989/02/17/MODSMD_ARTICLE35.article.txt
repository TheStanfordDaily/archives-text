# Worrell moves into rotation
## 
### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
Stanford's lone left-handed
hurler looks like he may be the
Mike Mussina or Stan Spencer of
1989.
As freshmen last season, Mus
sina and Spencer helped pitch the
Cardinal to its second straight na
tional championship.
A freshman has again moved
into the starting rotation, this
time in the person of 6-foot-1,
170-pound Steve Worrell. And if
his season approaches the success
of last year's freshman phenoms,
Worrell will have put himself on
the collegiate baseball map.
Worrell is scheduled to start
Sunday against UC-Santa Bar
bara. It will be his third start of
the season, but his second in the
regular rotation. He started Wed
nesday against Fresno State and
gave up one run in three innings
of work.
To earn that start, however, he
pitched five brilliant, scoreless in
nings last Saturday at Fullerton
State. The precocious freshman
still can't believe his meteoric rise
in Stanford's pitching universe.
"They told me last weekend
after the Fullerton series. I was
excited," Worrell said. "In the fall
my big thing was just to make
the traveling squad. Everyone is
so good here, the freshmen are
just trying to make a name for
themselves."
The move to the starting rota
tion is even more surprising be

cause Worrell is the team's only
left-hander.
"In the beginning of the year,
they kept saying I'd pitch against
left-handed batters. If I didn't get
a (specific) guy out I felt like I
failed," Worrell said.
Worrell mainly started for his
high school team and is much
more comfortable in that role.
"Relieving you have to have a
different attitude. You have to
come in and throw strikes. You're
not going to strike everybody
out," Worrell said.
In other words, as a reliever
you have to challenge every hitter.
That means throw your best
pitch, and for Worrell that means
fastball. The Cardinal coaches
have moved him out of the bullpen

for that very reason.
"We can do much more with
him there. For his development
we want to start to develop him
more as a pitcher," Cardinal
Coach Mark Marquess said. "He
has a really good fastball. We want
him to work on his breaking ball
and change. In relief he'll throw
mostly fastballs."
Worrell admits that he is at a
disadvantage because he threw al
most exclusively fastballs in high
school.
"In high school I didn't throw
a curve or a change. It wasn't a
pitch for strikes. I'm so far behind
everybody else. I can't spot my
curveball yet like everybody else,"

In his two appearances this season, Worrell has given up only one run in eight innings.
