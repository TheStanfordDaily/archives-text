# Stanford at UC-Santa Barbara
## 
### 
TODAY, TOMORROW, SUNDAY - K2SU (90.1 FM). Today: 2 p.m. start
Tomorrow and Sunday: 1 p.m. start. At Campus Diamond.
RECORDS — Stanford (7-5), Santa Barbara (3-5).
INJURIES - None.
SERIES — Stanford holds a slight lead over the Gauchos, 8-7, in a series
that dates back to 1983. Last season, the Cardinal swept a three-game
set from Santa Barbara.
GAUCHO UPDATE — After spending most of the early season in the dugout
with an ankle injury, designated hitter Doug Landphere, a former first-team
All-Big West selection (.371, 10 HR), will see his first extensive action at
the plate this season.
CARDINAL UPDATE — The Cardinal offense has exploded in the last two
games, hitting an impressive .319 (23-for-72). Stanford's center fielders,
however, have been unable to duplicate the team's success; Eric DeGraw,
Mike Eicher and Steve Solomon are only hitting a combined .089
(four-for-45) this season.
QUOTING MARQUESS - "This is an important series for us because it's
the last one before our league starts. We need to get our offense going
and have some momentum heading into the Cal series."
