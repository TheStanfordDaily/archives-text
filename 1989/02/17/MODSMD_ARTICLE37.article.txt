# 'Classy' Stevens leads women's hoops toward NCAA tourney
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Ask opponents why Trisha
Stevens is such an integral part
of the Stanford women's basket
ball team's success this season
and the responses will invariably
be tied to her play.
Intensity, physicality, quickness
and sharp-shooting are all deadly
parts of the sophomore forward's
repertoire, all elements that have
led to the demise of 19 opposing
teams. When Stevens plays well,
the opposition is often wont to
stop her.
Ask her teammates and coaches
why Stevens plays so well, and
the focus suddenly shifts. Talk of
post and passing turns into per
sonality and persistence, shooting
into support.iv»ness, competition
into kindness?*"
Risking understatement,
Stevens has the attributes of the
ideal player.
"Her personality and her en
thusiasm are really as important
as her points," Stanford Coach
Tara VanDerveer assessed. "She
is very supportive of all her team
mates. She plays hard and gives
everything she has, but she cheers
everybody at the same time."
"Trisha just has a great atti
tude," junior guard Jennifer Azzi
said. "Sometimes I don't think
the guards do a good enough job
throwing the ball inside, but
Trisha doesn't get pissed off.

She'll talk to us, and she's really
easy to work with.
"A lot of people are hard to
work with because they get mad;
Trisha never gets mad, and that's
why she's easy to play with. She
always sticks with things and
helps us out on the perimeter."
This season has pushed her per
severance to the limit. While the
team has played well since its
season opener against Wisconsin
(a 119-62 scoring extravaganza,
led by Stevens' game-high 20
points), the forward has lan
guished of late under the ener
vating effects of illness.
Last weekend, she demonstra
ted on Washington State's Bohler
Gym floor that her play has re
turned to its characteristically
high level. Scoring 14 points in
ju9t seven minutes, Stevens waat
utterly unstoppable.
Her teammates, however,
noticed nary a change. Both in
attitude and execution, it was the
same Stevens they have practiced
and played with all year.
Things may have been rough,
but Stevens never showed the
struggle.
"As much as she's physically
gifted, she's mentally tough and
is really poised on the floor," Van-
Derveer said. "Things do not
shake her — she does not take
herself out of the game. Things
might not be going well, but she
doesn't get down on herself and
she doesn't give up. She might

feci like doing it, but she doesn't."
Of course, a little self-awareness
helps. As Stevens admits, she
comes on stronger toward the end
of the season. Understanding this,
it is far easier for her to weather
iHB potffl&r showings in anticipa
tion for success to come.
Stevens also has intelligence
and adaptability as her allies.
Though technically a low-post
player, she jumpshoots with ac
curacy and passes when she sees
a perimeter opening. Versatility
— another Stevens buzz word.
"I just think Trisha's a great
player," sophomore point guard
Sonja Henning said. "She's a great
all-around player — she's not lim
ited to just standing on the block,
which is why I think we work so
well together. She's just a smart
player."
Coming from Pac-10 Player of
the Week Henning, a player noted

for her composure on the court,
this is a true compliment indeed.
Describing Stevens as an aware
athlete with the intuitiveness of
a star point guard, Stevens might
be seen by some as a mini-
Henning.
"Actually, she's better than I
am," Henning enthusiastically
confessed. "Maybe I'm a mini
Trisha Stevens. But she's
definitely a complete player."
Also beaming with praise, the
Cardinal coach added her share
of praise for one of her prize
players. Recipient of the Coaches'
Award at the end of last season
for exhibiting the best competitive
attitude, Stevens has earned even
more personal admiration than
the athletic respect she has com
manded from opponents in her
two years on the Farm.
"Trisha is very steady, very con
sistent and very dependable,"
VanDerveer said. "I'll just say
this: She is a pleasure to coach
every day, even when she was sick
and it was really hard for her.
She really has it together on the
court and off the court.
"She's a class young lady, and
I'm really proud of her."
Card note
Should Stevens and her teammates
beat California as expected tonight,
the Cardinal will tie the school-record
14 game win streak established last
season. The win will also tie the
lifetime series at 12-12.

is very supportive of all her team
mates. She plays hard and gives
everything she has, but she cheers
everybody at the same time."
"Trisha just has a great atti
tude," junior guard Jennifer Azzi
said. "Sometimes I don't think
the guards do a good enough job
throwing the ball inside, but
Trisha doesn't get pissed off.

She'll talk to us, and she's really
easy to work with.
"A lot of people are hard to
work with because they get mad;
Trisha never gets mad, and that's
why she's easy to play with. She
always sticks with things and
helps us out on the perimeter."
This season has pushed her per
severance to the limit. While the
team has played well since its
season opener against Wisconsin
(a 119-62 scoring extravaganza,
led by Stevens' game-high 20
points), the forward has lan
guished of late under the ener
vating effects of illness.
Last weekend, she demonstra
ted on Washington State's Bohler
Gym floor that her play has re
turned to its characteristically
high level. Scoring 14 points in
ju9t seven minutes, Stevens waat
utterly unstoppable.
Her teammates, however,
noticed nary a change. Both in
attitude and execution, it was the
same Stevens they have practiced
and played with all year.
Things may have been rough,
but Stevens never showed the
struggle.
"As much as she's physically
gifted, she's mentally tough and
is really poised on the floor," Van-
Derveer said. "Things do not
shake her — she does not take
herself out of the game. Things
might not be going well, but she
doesn't get down on herself and
she doesn't give up. She might

feci like doing it, but she doesn't."
Of course, a little self-awareness
helps. As Stevens admits, she
comes on stronger toward the end
of the season. Understanding this,
it is far easier for her to weather
iHB potffl&r showings in anticipa
tion for success to come.
Stevens also has intelligence
and adaptability as her allies.
Though technically a low-post
player, she jumpshoots with ac
curacy and passes when she sees
a perimeter opening. Versatility
— another Stevens buzz word.
"I just think Trisha's a great
player," sophomore point guard
Sonja Henning said. "She's a great
all-around player — she's not lim
ited to just standing on the block,
which is why I think we work so
well together. She's just a smart
player."
Coming from Pac-10 Player of
the Week Henning, a player noted

for her composure on the court,
this is a true compliment indeed.
Describing Stevens as an aware
athlete with the intuitiveness of
a star point guard, Stevens might
be seen by some as a mini-
Henning.
"Actually, she's better than I
am," Henning enthusiastically
confessed. "Maybe I'm a mini
Trisha Stevens. But she's
definitely a complete player."
Also beaming with praise, the
Cardinal coach added her share
of praise for one of her prize
players. Recipient of the Coaches'
Award at the end of last season
for exhibiting the best competitive
attitude, Stevens has earned even
more personal admiration than
the athletic respect she has com
manded from opponents in her
two years on the Farm.
"Trisha is very steady, very con
sistent and very dependable,"
VanDerveer said. "I'll just say
this: She is a pleasure to coach
every day, even when she was sick
and it was really hard for her.
She really has it together on the
court and off the court.
"She's a class young lady, and
I'm really proud of her."
Card note
Should Stevens and her teammates
beat California as expected tonight,
the Cardinal will tie the school-record
14 game win streak established last
season. The win will also tie the
lifetime series at 12-12.

Sophomore forward Trisha Stevens has been an integral part of
the rise of women's basketball to the top 20.
Ask opponents why Trisha
Stevens is such an integral part
of the Stanford women's basket
ball team's success this season
and the responses will invariably
be tied to her play.
Intensity, physicality, quickness
and sharp-shooting are all deadly
parts of the sophomore forward's
repertoire, all elements that have
led to the demise of 19 opposing
teams. When Stevens plays well,
the opposition is often wont to
stop her.
Ask her teammates and coaches
why Stevens plays so well, and
the focus suddenly shifts. Talk of
post and passing turns into per
sonality and persistence, shooting
into support.iv»ness, competition
into kindness?*"
Risking understatement,
Stevens has the attributes of the
ideal player.
"Her personality and her en
thusiasm are really as important
as her points," Stanford Coach
Tara VanDerveer assessed. "She
is very supportive of all her team
