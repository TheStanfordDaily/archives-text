# Volleyball team faces tough WIVA tests during homestand
## 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
The Stanford men's volleyball team has
swept through USC, UC-Santa Barbara and
Hawaii, three of the Western Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association's toughest opponents,
as well as two other WIVA squads. Stanford
has performed on the road and has repeat
edly shown the ability to come from behind.
The only team left in the Cardinal's path
is UCLA, and, though the Bruins are ranked
No. 1 right now, Stanford is capable of
knocking them off. It seems like Stanford
is on its way to the WIVA title.
"Now wait just a minute."
That is what Stanford coaches Fred Sturm
and Ruben Nieves are saying in the wake
of Stanford's amazing success on its recent
road trip. The two are maintaining a very
even keel in dealing with the hype that is
now surrounding this Cardinal squad.
Though acknowledging that their players
have fared exceptionally well thus far, the
Cardinal's brain trust is quick to point out
that there are a lot of games left in the
season.
When asked if the upcoming homestand

'Every team in this confer
ence, from the bottom up,
has the ability to win against
quality opponents.'
â€” Coach Fred Sturm

might serve as a bit of a mid-season respite
for his players, Coach Sturm responded with
an emphatic "no." Though the Cardinal's
upcoming opponents, Cal State-Northridge,
San Diego State, and UC-Davis are, on
paper, much weaker that Stanford, Sturm
insists that the Cardinal cannot afford to
take any opponents lightly.
Sturm, to qualify his caution, said "Every
team in this conference, from the bottom
up, has the ability to win against quality
opponents. Cal State-Northridge (Stanford's
opponent tomorrow night) is a perfect ex
ample. Here's a team that is 0-4 in the
conference, and these guys beat Hawaii [in
the Santa Barbara tournament]. They get

Samuelson back, and they're an entirely dif
ferent squad."
Sturm was referring to Northridge's
feared hitter, Bob Samuelson. Infamous
around the WIVA both for his bald head
and his brutal hitting, Samuelson missed
the early part of Northridge's season and
his absence greatly debilitated his team.
When the Matadors storm into Maples Pavil
lion tomorrow night, however, Stanford is
expecting him to be in their ranks.
"Imagine our team without Fortune,"
Sturm said. "It would certainly be a different
squad. Samuelson's just like Fortune. He's
a team leader, not to mention a great hitter.
With him in the lineup, they are going to
be a tough team to beat."
Even in light of Sturm's cautious words,
though, the evidence does seem a little over
whelming. This Cardinal team is on n roll
and may be playing the best volleyball ever
played by a Stanford team. Stanford is
loaded with talent and as close to 100 percent
healthy as it has been all year.
Tomorrow night, Bob Samuelson and his
Matador teammates will have to do some
miracle-working to keep things close against
the Cardinal.
