# University denies self-op status to Slavic theme house
## 
### Raoul Mowatt Staff writer 
To the surprise and dismay
of most residents, budget
restraints have forced the Uni
versity to deny self-op status for
Slavianskii Dorm next fall.
Residents of the Soviet and
Eastern European studies house
proposed the change earlier this
year, but Keith Guy, director of
Housing and Food Services cited
both budget considerations and
the lateness of the house's ap
peal as reasons for denying this
year's request.
By converting to a self-op,
Slavianskii Dom would gain
more autonomy than at present.
Among other benefits, house
members could select a cook to
prepare meals appropriate to
the Slavic theme.
The house's theme associate
David Ritsher said, "We as
sumed we'd turn in an applica
tion to become a self-op and we
would become one. But we
heard from Food Service that
because of their budget deficit
that we couldn't."
Guy said the proposal was
rejected due to bad timing.
"When the idea of that reached
my office, it was beyond budget
preparation time. The point is,
we have to have those sort of

changes in the works when we
prepare our budget."
According to Guy, if
Slavianskii Dom switched from
Food Service to a self-op, all stu
dents' Food Service bills would
be affected because fixed costs
would spread among fewer stu
dents.
Guy also noted that unex
pected problems played a role
in the decision to pass over
Slavianskii Dom, referring to
the cost of renovating Roble Hall
and unexpected vacancies in
graduate housing.
From the beginning, some of
the advocates of establishing a
Slavic theme house hoped it
would have self-op status.
Nonetheless, to ease the tran
sition from regular Row house
to Slavianskii Dom, Res Ed and
house members agreed last year
to wait until the 1989-90 school
year for the change. Slavianskii
Dom, formerly called Hurlburt
House, became a theme house
this year.
As Residential Fellow Paul
von Stamwitz put it, "We would
make the flavor more in line
with the theme by becoming a
self-op."
"We're the biggest academic
theme house on the campus, and
our main reason for wanting to
become a self-op is to attract

new residents and to add to the
community feeling of the cur
rent ones," House Manager
Erica Deese-Dobson said.
Deese-Dobson added that the
proposed switch to self-op had
such support among the house's
residents that "We'd be willing
to have a higher meal plan bill
if we got some of these things,
because their excuse is always
money."
In response to a letter from
Deese-Dobson protesting the de
cision, Row Director Diana Con
klin wrote, "That is not to say
there is nothing we can do to
help the house realize some of
its Food Service-related goals
this year and next."
She suggested that the resi
dents should confer with Food
Service officials to determine
what improvements could be
made.
According to Ritsher, "About
two weeks ago, we had a meet
ing with Food Service and Res
Ed ... to determine ways to
become like a self-op without
being a self-op. That's as con
tradictory as it sounds."
Ritsher added, "They (Food
Service) are prepared to do all
they can as long as they don't
have to spend any money."
