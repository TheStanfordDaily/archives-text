# ASSU says no to computer voting

### Baldwin Lee Staff writer 
An ASSU Senate vote last night
rejected the use of computer
voting machines in this spring's
elections.
The bill's defeat shocked and
disappointed Elections Commis
sioner Steve Krauss, who said he
considered the voting system, "my
baby." The system, comprised of
clusters of Macintosh II comput
ers, had already been approved by
the Adminstration and Rules
Committee of the senate.
Claiming that the computerized
system was set to run, Krauss
said the no vote effectively threw
away hundreds of working-hours
and more than $2,000 in devel
opment costs.
The bill, which needed 12 votes
to pass, or a two-thirds senate
majority, received only eight
votes. The seven graduate
senators and nine undergraduate
senators voted in blocs. All grad
uate senators rejected the bill,
while only undergraduate senator
Le√üoy Davis deviated from the
undergraduate bloc and cast a no
vote.
During last night's meeting, the

graduate students voiced concern
about the decrease in the number
of visible voting sites if a comput
erized voting system were imple
mented. Thirteen ballot booth
sites existed in last year's elec
tions, mainly in high-traffic sites
such as White Plaza, Tresidder
Union Back Patio and the Clock
Tower. Krauss planned on only
six sites for computerized elec
tions.
Graduate senators argued that
graduate students tended to vote
impulsively when they "ran across
a voting site" in a high-trafTic
area, and would not vote if sites
were stuck away in computer
clusters such as the one at Ter
man Engineering Center.
Some graduate senators ques
tioned the reliability of a com
puter voting system, pointing to
possible computer crashes or
hardware breakdowns.
Krauss noted that there are
reliability problems with other
voting systems as well; he pointed
to the 1987 ASSU election where
a broken Scantron machine caused
an unexpected delay in tabula
tions.
Barring new developments, the
ASSU will rent ballot booths.
