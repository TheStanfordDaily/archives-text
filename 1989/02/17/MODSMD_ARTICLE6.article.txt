# University delays response to USW
## Deadline passes on Webb Ranch demand 
### Eric Young Editorial staff 
The University called the
United Stanford Workers' bluff
yesterday. But the union plans on
proving it wasn't bluffing.
The USW had demanded in a
letter Tuesday that Stanford al
low more than 50 Webb Ranch
employees to join the union by
today. But the Stanford Legal Of
fice announced late yesterday that
it would ignore the "so-called
deadline." In response, the USW
will ask the state to intervene in
Stanford labor relations.
USW officials said they will pe
tition the state Agriculture Labor
Relations Board today to require
a Webb Ranch workers' vote on
whether to unionize.
University lawyer Michael Var
tain said yesterday that although
his office would ignore today's
noon deadline, it would move "as
quickly as possible" to respond.
USW president Alan Wagner
said the University's failure to re
spond "does not surprise me."
At the crux of the conflict is
the USW's contention that Stan
ford is a joint employer along with
ranch operator Stanley Webb, and
therefore the USW should have
the right to represent the ranch
workers. Stanford officials say the
University is not responsible for
overseeing labor conditions at the
ranch which is on land leased by
the University.
Ranch workers came to the un
ion for help, alledging that there
are health and safety violations
on the ranch, Webb Ranch man
agement denies the charges.

Forty-nine of 54 cur
rent ranch workers
have signed cards
petitioning for union
ization.

To publicize the conditions on
the ranch, workers led members
of the local and national media
on a Wednesday tour of the ranch
facilities.
The workers who live on the
ranch are housed in plywood
buildings and share one com
munal kitchen. Most rooms have
few furnishings and some walls
are patched with old carpet to
cover holes and conserve heat.
Vartain said he did not know
if there have been any health and
safety violations at the ranch. "If
there are health and safety viola
tions . . . that is something that
would concern us (the Universi
ty)," Vartain said.
He said his office would have
to contact county authorities to
see if there have been any com
plaints of violations.
The 1,300-member USW
reports that 49 of 54 current
ranch workers have signed cards
petitioning for unionization.
Webb Ranch, a private berry
and vegetable farm, is located on
250 acres of land that is situated
just to the west of Interstate 280,
off Alpine Road.
Workers said they were afraid
to speak up before because several
were illegal aliens from Mexico.
