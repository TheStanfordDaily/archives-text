# Frosh fencers lunge into limelight, foil Eastern rule
## With sharp style, top recruits bring the sport west 
### Ann Marsh Editorial staff 
There's something unmistakable about
freshman recruit Nick Bravin's fencing.
Crouching down into an unusually deep
"en garde" position, Bravin holds his body
frighteningly still when the command to
"Fence!" sends other foilists shuffling back
and forth in nervous anticipation.
Their edginess is justified.
Bravin's startling, rapid-fire advance can
be nearly impossible to counterattack and
an unwavering hand nets him enough
"touches" to land him among the top three
junior foilists in the United States this year.
As one of two new recruits who are na
tionally ranked — and arguably — world
class fencers, Bravin is a boon to Stanford's
Varsity Fencing Team, which has consis
tently been the top fencing team in the
western United States, despite the fact that
most of its fencers learn to fence in classes
here.
Stanford's other freshman fencing
recruit, D'Amico, wields a sabre
with a so-called "aristocratic" style. Speed
and agility give D'Amico an unexpectedly
light touch in his sport where swashbuck
ling cuts to the head and chest are the

bruising name of the game.
"Sometimes I hit and it's a bit light,"
D'Amico said matter-of-factly. "I guess I'm
quieter than most fencers."
D'Amico and Bravin "were two of the
hottest recruits in the nation last year,"
said men's fencing Coach Zoran Tulum.
Nineteen-year-old D'Amico, who fences
sabre, and 17-year-old Bravin, who fences
foil, each held the number-one spot in their
particular weapon in the under-20 category
last year. The third weapon in fencing is
6pee.
The three weapons differ in the size of
permitted target area on the body, and
more generally in the style and tempera
ment required of each fencer. "Foil and
£pSe are thrusting weapons, while sabre is
for cutting as well," Tulum said.
At the Junior World Olympics this week
end in Colorado Springs, Colorado, both
athletes are favored to finish in the top
three and go with the U.S. team to the
Junior World Championships to be held in
Athens, Greece from March 23 to 27.
Together, three men and two women
from Stanford's Fencing Team will compete

Freshman fencers Leonard D'Amlco and Nick Bravln have been dubbed "the hottest
recruits in the nation" by Stanford's fencing Coach Zoran Tulum. D'Amlco and Bravln
are competing at the Junior World Olympics this weekend In Colorado Springs, Colo.
this weekend in Junior Olympic
competition.
Because the East Coast boasts
the toughest fencing competition
in the country, staying in the kind
of shape necessary to participate
in high-level competition is an on
going challenge for Bravin and
D'Amico at Stanford.
"I knew Zoran was a good sabre
coach," D'Amico said of Tulum,
who came to Stanford two years
ago from assistant coaching at
Harvard. "But at the East Coast
schools I would have gotten better
fencing and more competition."
"What irks me the most is that
the range of quality fencers is so
much greater in the East," said
Bravin, who flew to New York
over Christmas break to get in
some extra practice.
Both could have easily gone
East to schools like the University
of Pennsylvania or Columbia Uni
versity, where fencing competition
exceeds the rest of the country
and the sport is as presitigious as
it is unsung at Stanford.
At Pennsylvania State, for ex
ample, "other teams wait for the
fencers to finish in the training
room and they have special dorm
rooms for the members of the
fencing teams," said Stanford
women's fencing Coach Sherry
Posthumus. And at Columbia,
fencing "is their number one
sport."
Both Bravin and D'Amico said
the clincher in each of their de
cisions to come to Stanford was
the school's academic reputation.
Bravin added, "Now that I'm here
I realize there's so much more
than the academics."
Whatever the motivations, Pos
thumus said these decisions could
be precedent-setting because
D'Amico and Bravin are among
the first promising native West
Coast fencers who have opted not
to go East.
Now that the proteges are here,
both coaches said they hope their
presence will attract more recruits
from around the United States —
and the world — to Stanford.
"Having good guys like that
(Bravin and D'Amico) around
helps attract other good guys,"
said senior sabre fencer Dave
Russ. "That's how you start a

dynasty."
Bravin and D'Amico's presence,
along with improvements in the
team's overall performance this
year, should combine to make a
potent recruiting tool, Tulum said.
"We proved this year in going to
the East Coast that we can com
pete."
Stanford won seven out of eight
meets against East Coast fencing
powers this fall, receiving their
only loss from Harvard by a single
touch in a tense face-off. Accord
ing to Tulum, these wins place
Stanford among the top 10 college
fencing teams in the country, up
from the 28th spot last year.
Performances by Bravin, who
went undefeated in all his 24
bouts during the trip, and
D'Amico, who lost only four of
his fights, helped considerably.
"They're both fast," said
Tulum. "But comparing their
temperaments is like comparing a
calm river to a fast mountain
spring," he said of Bravin's ex
plosive style and D'Amico's un
flappable poise.
"They pull the same results
from different temperaments,
which is what makes fencing in
teresting because people are so
different," Tulum said.
According to Tulum, the two
have helped to "clean the team,"
by providing other fencers with
some of their toughest bouts ever.
"It's like watching (the popular
movie) 'The Princess Bride' and
having Inigo Montoya turn and
say, 'Hey, do you want to fence?
I'll use my left hand,' " Tulum
said.
"When I fence Nick, I fence
really hard and I still lose,"
laughed foil team captain Duncan
Bell, a senior. "If I get one touch
I'm happy. It keeps you sharp."
Russ said both he and captain
of the sabre team Mike Kramer
"can beat him (D'Amico) on a

good day." To counteract
D'Amico's natural talent, he said,
"We try to trick him, and it's good
for him," Russ said. "It's been
good having him on the team."
But, having a wide range in
talents on one team has also
caused some tension. For in
stance, the other side to Bravin's
self-assuredness is that he can
sometimes seem aloof.
"You have to know it's not easy
for them if they don't have similar
quality talent with which to
fence," Tulum explained.
"Honestly, I don't think there
are very many good fencers on
the West Coast right now," Bravin
admitted.
Unlike individual competition
in the United States Fencing As
sociation, in collegiate fencing
when "you make a team, you have
to meet your lessons, go to com
petitions, go to practices," Pos
thumus said, explaining that for
some the transition can be rough.
"You have to get along with people
on the team. While you can
change your roommate, you can't
change your teammates."
While difficult, Posthumus said
sticking with the team has real
benefits. "There's something you
derive from being on a team and
being part of a group. There's a
sense of pride there," she said.
She added that the "oil and
water mix of experienced and in
experienced fencers" is one of the
best things about Stanford's
team. "They really have to learn
to help each other out," Pos
thumus said.
D'Amico said he enjoys the in
creased support on a team. "Also
it forces me to practice every day.
I'm in a lot better shape than I
used to be," he said.
While members of the Stanford
fencing team spend 12 to 15 hours
a week fencing on average, Bravin
supplements this schedule by
seeking additional competition in
fencing salles throughout the Bay
Area. In addition, both he and
D'Amico spend considerable
amounts of time and money at
tending fencing circuit events
year-round throughout the coun
try.
This fall, for instance, D'Amico
finished first at the first junior
North American Circuit Compe

tition at Penn. State and Bravin
took a silver medal at the Junior
Pan American Championships in
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
For several years now, "I've had
this goal to be in the '92 Olym
pics," Bravin said. According to
Bravin, he and a friend, who is
now fencing at the Univ. of Penn.,
made a pact to go there together.
"His license plate says ' '92
GOLD,' " Bravin added.
"A lot of people ask, 'So are
you going to the Olympics?' and
I don't know," D'Amico said.

"We'll have to wait and see in a
few years."
But before they ever see Olym
pic competition, both fencers must
tackle senior-level fencing in the
over-20 category, according to
Posthumus.
In making that transition, both
will have to "work their way to
the top again," Posthumus said,
adding that the challenge should
be especially tough for D'Amico.
"Sabre is the hardest of the weap
ons to break into."
With school, fencing for both

athletes is hard enough as it is.
"Last quarter was just insane,"
Bravin said. "I missed two weeks
of school and five weekends (and)
I'm missing finals for Junior
Worlds" in March. Both Bravin
and D'Amico had to drop a class
in their first quarter at Stanford.
But D'Amico, who has fenced
for nine years, and Bravin, who
has fenced for six, said they both
will probably stick with it for a
while longer.
According to D'Amico, fencing
"has a mystique about it that
nothing else has."
