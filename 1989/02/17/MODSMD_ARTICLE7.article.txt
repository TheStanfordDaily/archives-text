# Frosh fencers lunge into limelight, foil Eastern rule
## With sharp style, top recruits bring the sport west 
### Ann Marsh Editorial staff 
There's something unmistakable about
freshman recruit Nick Bravin's fencing.
Crouching down into an unusually deep
"en garde" position, Bravin holds his body
frighteningly still when the command to
"Fence!" sends other foilists shuffling back
and forth in nervous anticipation.
Their edginess is justified.
Bravin's startling, rapid-fire advance can
be nearly impossible to counterattack and
an unwavering hand nets him enough
"touches" to land him among the top three
junior foilists in the United States this year.
As one of two new recruits who are na
tionally ranked — and arguably — world
class fencers, Bravin is a boon to Stanford's
Varsity Fencing Team, which has consis
tently been the top fencing team in the
western United States, despite the fact that
most of its fencers learn to fence in classes
here.
Stanford's other freshman fencing
recruit, D'Amico, wields a sabre
with a so-called "aristocratic" style. Speed
and agility give D'Amico an unexpectedly
light touch in his sport where swashbuck
ling cuts to the head and chest are the

bruising name of the game.
"Sometimes I hit and it's a bit light,"
D'Amico said matter-of-factly. "I guess I'm
quieter than most fencers."
D'Amico and Bravin "were two of the
hottest recruits in the nation last year,"
said men's fencing Coach Zoran Tulum.
Nineteen-year-old D'Amico, who fences
sabre, and 17-year-old Bravin, who fences
foil, each held the number-one spot in their
particular weapon in the under-20 category
last year. The third weapon in fencing is
6pee.
The three weapons differ in the size of
permitted target area on the body, and
more generally in the style and tempera
ment required of each fencer. "Foil and
£pSe are thrusting weapons, while sabre is
for cutting as well," Tulum said.
At the Junior World Olympics this week
end in Colorado Springs, Colorado, both
athletes are favored to finish in the top
three and go with the U.S. team to the
Junior World Championships to be held in
Athens, Greece from March 23 to 27.
Together, three men and two women
from Stanford's Fencing Team will compete
