Study explores future
of California's kids
The number of California
children is exploding: By 1995,
California school enrollment will
equal the total enrollment of the
24 smallest states and show an
unprecedented ethnic diversity.
These children are already ex
periencing more poverty, more
drug- and alcohol-related health
problems and an enormous
degree of immigration
adjustment problems. Moreover,
their conditions are changing so
rapidly that our already over
burdened social system may not
be able to cope.
That's the picture emerging
from "Conditions of Children in
California" — a major, ground
breaking report issued Feb. 13,
by Policy Analysis for California
Education.
According to Education Prof.

Michael Kirst, co-director of the
analysis group and head of the
study, which involved the work
of 26 researchers around the
state: "California is growing and
changing with such scope, in
tensity and rapidity that if the
state continues with its present
course and its current policies,
several crucial conditions of
children, such as educational
achievement, will decline even
more."

New 'music medicine'
The world may be ready for
"music medicine," said a Stan
ford research psychiatrist, since
the medical ailments of
musicians can be serious enough
to end a career.
In addition to such conditions
as "cellist's chest," "fiddler's
neck" or "guitar nipple," Dr.

Duncan Clark said that severe
performance anxiety can stop a
career cold. He reported on the
range of musical maladies in the
March "Annals of Behavioral
Medicine."
Clark, a former musician,
looks to a time when "music
medicine" is recognized as a
speciality much like sports
medicine.
In a current study, Clark is
attempting to see whether com
binations of medication, relaxa
tion training and learning the
power of positive thinking can
put musicians with stage fright
back on track.
He's recruited a cadre of vol
unteers, both professional and
amateur musicians, who are re
ceiving behavior therapy, and in
some cases state-of-the-art
drugs, to control their perform
ance anxiety.
More professional musicians
are using drugs for performance
anxiety now more than ever.
