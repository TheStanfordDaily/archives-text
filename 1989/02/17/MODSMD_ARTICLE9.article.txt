# The
						myth of 'new fatherhood'
## Govt. psychologist claims male family roles have remained the same 
### Debbie Brear 
Contrary to popular assump
tions, American fathers are no
more involved in child-rearing
than they were in the days of
television programs like "Father
Knows Best," according to a gov
ernment psychologist who studies
male roles within the family.
"Men aren't tearing down the
nursury doors to get in, but
women aren't letting them in,
either," Micheal Lamb, an expert
with the Department of Health
and Human Services, said in a
speech here Wednesday.
According to Lamb, the media
have created a myth of "new fat
herhood" in the last decade by
portraying fathers as more active
in the day-to-day rearing of their
children.
Movies like "Kramer vs.
Kramer," in which Dustin Hoff
man played a father who can't
make french toast for his son,
"made the culture aware of the

deficiency (of paternal involve
ment) and everyone started think
ing about fatherhood in a different
way, in a way that emphasized
the father's involvement in his
child's life," explained Lamb.
The media's portrayal of the
"new father" may have preempted
reality, however.
While there is increasing theo
retical acceptance of fathers more
actively involved in their
children's lives, few fathers are
taking over child-rearing tasks
traditionally performed by moth
ers, Lamb said.
"Fathers, when mothers are
employed, do not spend more time
with their children; their partners
spend less time with the children.
The behavior doesn't change, it
just appears to," Lamb said.
But this lack of involvement
may not be hurting children,
Lamb said. Children who perform
best do not necessarily receive the
most paternal attention. Instead,
children benefit more when

partners are happy with their
respective roles in child-rearing.
But Lamb advises that there is
still potential for change. "One of
the best-kept secrets," he said, is
that women are just as poorly
prepared as men to care for
children.
"The difference is that women
are expected to know. Men can be
just as successful, but they exist
in a system that tells them they
can't," he said.
Because of this, Lamb said, men
perceive themselves as less sensi
tive and less competent in caring
for children.
As long as the channels of com
munication remain open between
parents, there will be room for
the "new father" to emerge, he
said.
Lamb's lecture was part of the
winter Jing Lyman lecture series,
which is sponsored by the Insti
tute for Research on Women and
Gender and focuses this year on
parenting options.
