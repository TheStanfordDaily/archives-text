Researchers at the Stanford School of Medicine
are working on a new treatment of lymphatic cancer
that has been proven effective on a number of
patients with otherwise untreatable tumors.
Significant tumor shrinkage occurred in nine of
11 patients tested for the new treatment, developed
by Medicine Prof. Ronald Levy. Two of these
patients, completely recovered from the treatment
for lymphatic cancer, or lymphoma.
Lymphoma strikes the lymph glands, which are
central components of the immune system and are
located all over the body.
