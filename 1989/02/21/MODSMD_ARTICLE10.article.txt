# Lymphatic cancer drugs promising

### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Researchers at the Stanford School of Medicine
are working on a new treatment of lymphatic cancer
that has been proven effective on a number of
patients with otherwise untreatable tumors.
Significant tumor shrinkage occurred in nine of
11 patients tested for the new treatment, developed
by Medicine Prof. Ronald Levy. Two of these
patients, completely recovered from the treatment
for lymphatic cancer, or lymphoma.
Lymphoma strikes the lymph glands, which are
central components of the immune system and are
located all over the body.
Lymphoma occurs in about
10,000 new people yearly, and
about one-half of them do not
recover from ordinary treatment.
"Lymphoma is a disease with a
lot of treatments that are success
ful," Levy said. The patients in
volved in the test, however, had
all failed to respond to standard
treatments of lymphatic cancer.
Therefore, the probability any
treatment like his would work
were poor, Levy said.
According to lymphoma expert
Erwin Bernstein of the Brad
Hutchins Cancer Institute in
Seattle, Wash., the treatment
needs more work to be completely
effective, but holds promise.
"It may be real," Bernstein said
about Levy's work. "It's exciting
stuff."

Levy and colleagues reported
their results in the current issue
of the medical journal Blood.
Levy said the new treatment
would probably not replace exist
ing treatments, but will supple
ment them.
Conventional treatments of lym
phoma involve chemotherapy and
radiation therapy. The toxicity of
these treatments make them less
than ideal, because of their many
side effects including nausea and
hair loss. The high cost of the
chemotherapy is another draw
back.
The new treatment involves a
combination of injections of
chemicals normally produced in
humans to combat invaders of the
body: interferon and antibodies.
Industrially-produced interferon
has been used for years as a treat
ment for both viral infections and
cancer.
Seven years ago, Levy's group
pioneered use of a certain kind of

antibody, called the anti-idiotype
antibody, to combat cancer. Since
then, the researchers have found
that combining interferon and
these antibodies is an effective
treatment of lymphoma.
Antibodies are very specific, so
the body requires an antibody for
each invader.
To fight cancer, antibodies bind
to tumor cells and signal the body
that the cell should be destroyed.
The body's natural defenses take
over from this point. Lymph cells,
called lymphocytes, swallow the
tumor cells, thus destroying them.
The researchers have deter
mined that tumor cells which
don't respond to the new treat
ment have subtle but distinct
in their surfaces. These
changes make the cells unrecog
nizable to the anti-idiotype an
tibody. Because antibodies are
very specific, they will not coat
the altered cells.
