## FBI releases final report on Tower 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
President Bush yesterday con
cluded after reading a final FBI
report on embattled Defense
Secretary-designate John
Tower that there was nothing
in the files to derail Tower's
nomination, the White House
said.
Press Secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said that Bush went
over the 140-page report on
Tower, a former U.S. senator
from Texas, during an Oval Of
fice meeting with White House
counsel C. Boyden Gray.
Gray went to Capitol Hill late
Monday to present the report
to Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and
John Warner, R-Va., the
ranking members of the Armed
Services Committee.
"The report shows no reason
why Sen. Tower should not be
confirmed, in our judgment,"
Fitzwater told reporters as the
dinner hour approached.
"The president urges that
Sen. Tower be confirmed as
soon as possible," Fitzwater
said.
"We'll let the senators read
the report and make their own
judgement," the press secre
tary said.
Fitzwater said the FBI
report was "very exhaustive"
and said that the document was
sent unaltered to the Armed
Services Committee leaders.
"It did not corroborate the
personal charges (of womaniz
ing and excessive drinking)
against the senator, nor did it
show any problems with illegal
campaign contributions,"

Fitzwater told reporters.
He said that Nunn and
Warner are welcome to "keep
the report and read it at their
convenience," but made it clear
the White House believes that
Tower's nomination should be
recommended favorably by the
committee and approved by the
full Senate.
Fitzwater said that Gray
phoned Bush at Camp David,
Md., in the early afternoon and
discussed the report briefly
with the president, and then
had a fuller discussion with
Bush in the Oval Office.
On his return to the White
House from the presidential
retreat, Bush gave a thumbs
up sign when asked about
Tower's prospects. But the
president did not comment.
Fitzwater said the report fo
cused "on the last remaining
allegations" against Tower. He
said that Bush "agreed with
Boyden's conclusion that there
was no reason in that report
that Sen. Tower should not be
confirmed."
Nunn and Warner met into
the night after Gray delivered
the report and later avoided
reporters as he left.
"There's a lot to go over,"
Warner said as he made one
of several trips between the
committee office and his own
office.
Spokesmen for both Nunn
and Warner said the senators
would have nothing further to
say for the night.
