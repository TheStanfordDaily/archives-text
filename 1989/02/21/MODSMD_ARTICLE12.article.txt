# Europeans recall diplomats from Iran
## 
### 
European Common Market
governments decided yesterday to
withdraw their top diplomats
from Iran to protest Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's renewed or
der for Moslems to kill novelist
Salman Rushdie. Britain went fur
ther by pulling out its entire em
bassy staff.
Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey
Howe said the death threats
against Rushdie and the publish
ers of "The Satanic Verses" for
allegedly blaspheming Islam were
"unwarranted interference" in
Britain's internal affairs.
He left open the possibility of
expelling Iran's lone diplomat in
London, where Rushdie lives.
The 12 European Economic
Community governments, in a
sharp blow to Iran's hopes of im
proving relations with Western
nations, decided to recall their
diplomats for consulations and
suspend high-level visits to and
from Iran.
They said they also will restrict
the movement of Iranian
diplomats in their countries.
Howe told a news conference
that the EEC foreign ministers,
meeting in Brussels, had sent "a
strong, concerted signal to the
Iranian leadership that
Khomeini's threats are an affront
to international standards of be
havior and will not be tolerated."
For Britain's part, he said, "it
is no longer sensible to maintain
a diplomatic presence in Tehran."
He said Iran's charge d'affaires
in London, Mohammad Basti,
would be summoned to hear "the
reasons for this action along with
the implications for Mr. Basti and
his mission."
Asked if that meant closing the
Iranian Embassy, he replied: "I
leave it for your own conclusions."
In London, Basti was sum
moned and told of the decision

but made no immediate comment.
Rushdie, 41, apologized Satur
day for any distress the publica
tion of his book caused to Mos
lems, after Iranian President Ali
Khamenei indicated that an apol
ogy could lead to a pardon.
On Sunday, however, Iran's of
ficial Islamic Republic News
Agency quoted Khomeini as ruling
out any reprieve for Rushdie and
urging Moslems to "send him to
hell" for his writings.
Neither Khomeini's statement
nor IRNA referred to Khamenei's
comments, reflecting a widening
rift in the Iranian hierarchy over
the Rushdie affair.
"There plainly is confusion
amongst the Iran authorities,"
Howe said.
He added, however: "If the
threat were turned into fact, that
would call for an even more
serious response, but I hope that
it will not come to that."
Iran's deputy parliament
speaker, Mehdi Karrubi, reaf
firmed Khomeini's execution or
der yesterday.
Rushdie, an Indian-born Mos
lem, has been in hiding, reportedly
under armed police guard, since
Khomeini decreed Feb. 14 that he
should be killed and two Iranian
religious leaders put a $5.2 million
bounty on his head.
In London, Archbishop of Can
terbury Robert Runcie, spiritual
leader of Anglicans worldwide, ap
pealed to Britain's Moslem com
munity to contain its anger.
Commenting on the controversy
for the first time, Runcie acknowl
edged the book had deeply of
fended Moslems. But he con
demned the murder call and asked
Moslem leaders "to have regard
to the expression of profound
regret that Salman Rushdie
issued on Saturday."
Asked whether the latest rup

ture would worsen the plight of
Western hostages in Lebanon and
British businessman Roger
Cooper, who is jailed in Tehran,
Howe said: "Nobody can pretend
that it makes our task .. . any
easier."
Britain's embassy in Tehran,
closed for eight years, reopened
in December.
Moslems say "The Satanic

Verses" portrays the prophet
Mohammed's wives as prostitutes
and suggests that he wrote, rather
than Allah, the Koran,
The novel is banned in Pakis
tan, Bangladesh, Iran, India,
Egypt and South Africa. Publish
ers in France, West Germany,
Greece and Turkey have canceled
plans to publish it.
