# Soviets work on Middle East peace

### 
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) - The So
viet Union yesterday invited
Egypt's president to Moscow and
scheduled meetings in the Egyp
tian capital with Israel and the
PLO in quest of a Middle East
peace confcrence.
But Israeli Foreign Minister
Moshe Arens told reporters after
90 minutes of talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak that
they made no progress on the key
obstacle blocking a peace confer
ence — Israel's refusal to sit with
the PLO.
Cairo was the focus of new
peace efforts with the arrival Sun
day night of Soviet Foreign Min
ister Eduard Shevardnadze, who
is on a five-nation Middle East
tour.
He gave Mubarak a letter from
Soviet President Mikhail Gorba
chev, extending an "official and
friendly invitation" for the Egyp
tian leader to visit Moscow.
The message included "some
important presentation regarding
a Middle East settlement," Shev
ardnadze said in Russian through
an Arabic interpreter. He did not
elaborate.

After chastising Israel earlier
for adopting a "stubborn posi
tion," Shevardnadze was sched
uled to meet with Arens in Cairo
tomorrow. There was a strong
possibility he would meet with
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat sep
arately on the same day.
Israeli officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity, stressed
the Soviet and Israeli positions
were not so far apart that they
could not be bridged on the sub
ject of an international peace con
ference.
Shevardnadze proposed in
Damascus, Syria, on Saturday
that the U.N. Security Council's
five permanent members convene
a preparatory conference within
nine months to arrange for Arab-
Israeli negotiations.
Israel has said it would agree
to the Soviet Union and the
United States, perhaps with some
United Nations involvement pro
viding a launching pad for direct
negotiations between Israel and
its Arab neighbors.
However, Israel has refused to
talks with the PLO, which it con
tends is a terrorist organization

bent on destroying the Jewish
state.
Asked if progress was made in
his talks with Mubarak on the
issue, Arens said: "on the PLO
there is no progress now."
But Arens described his talks
with Mubarak as "§ very good
exchange of views" that took place
in a cordial atmosphere.
Egypt's Foreign Minister Esmat
Abdel-Meguid called on Israel to
consider "with an open mind and
open heart" the possibility of
talking to the PLO. The Palestin
ians, he told reporters after the
meeting, have shown "a greater
deal of flexibility and a great deal
of understanding."
The Soviets and Israelis have
permanent but low-level diplo
matic missions in each other's
country but are represented by
embassies of Finland and the
Netherlands.
Shevardnadze, who first flew to
Jordan and Syria, is to visit Iraq
and Iran before returning home.
He is the first Soviet foreign
minister to visit Jordan and is
the first high-ranking Soviet of
ficial to visit Egypt in 15 years.
