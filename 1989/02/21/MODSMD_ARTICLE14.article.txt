INS to speed up asylum decisions
BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) — Central Amer
icans applying for asylum will get an answer in
as little as one day and will be subject to imme
diate imprisonment if turned down, officials said
yesterday.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service
staff in southern Texas will be increased by 500
to patrol the border and speed up the weeding
out of "frivolous" asylum claims, INS Commis
sioner Alan Nelson announced.
More jails will be built to hold people who are
turned down pending their appeal or deportation,
he said.
"We intend to send a strong signal to those
people who have the mistaken idea that by merely
filing a frivolous asylum claim, they may stay in
the United States," Nelson said. "This willful
manipulation of America's generosity must stop."
The policy will be phased in over the next
several weeks. Nelson said the INS hopes even
tually to process most asylum applications in the

region in a day or two. Currently, asylum deci
sions can take months.
"We hope to have same-day service," said INS
spokeswoman Virginia Kice.
The changes came the same day the INS was
allowed to reinstate a policy restricting people
seeking asylum from leaving southern Texas
while they await decisions.
Duke's seating to be challenged
BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — A freshman legis
lator said yesterday he will challenge the seating
of former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David
Duke when the Legislature convenes in a special
session this week.
Workers at Duke's headquarters said he could
not be reached for comment on the challenge.
Rep. Odon Bacque, the only registered inde
pendent in the House, said he will challenge
Duke's seating on grounds that Duke did not
live in the district for a year, as required by law.
