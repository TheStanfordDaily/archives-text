## Reconsider the vote 
### 
Computerized voting
saves money and time,
deserves another look

ALONG WAIT in a long
line faces every student
every year when casting a
ballot in the ASSU spring elec
tions. Thousands of dollars in
student money pays for rented
voting booths, specially-hired poll
personnel and vote-counting by
the Santa Clara County Registrar
of Voters. In short, the ASSU
election procedure is outdated.
Every year, students complain
that the election ought to be bet
ter administered. And every year,
the powers responsible for elec
tions — the ASSU's Council of
Presidents, Senate and Elections
Commission — solemnly promise
to do better next time around.
Finally this year the new elec
tions commissioner, Steve
Krauss, decided to act on the
promise.
Krauss spent weeks — and
$2,000 of the commission budget
— developing a voting system
centered on the University's
clusters of Macintosh II comput
ers. Under Krauss' system, the
elections commission could save
funds spent in years past on
booth rentals, poll watchers and
vote-tallying; moreover, election
results could be calculated almost
immediately upon poll-closing.
But last Thursday the senate
rejected his package, with seven
of the eight nays coming from
the seven graduate senators pres
ent.
Why?
Not because of the cost.
Krauss' system — which utilizes
hardware already owned by the

University and the ASSU and
condenses 13 polling sites into six
larger, more efficient computer
clusters — would in fact result
in a sizable net savings to stu
dents, perhaps as much as $5,000
per year.
Despite the financial bonuses,
the ASSU reached a strange con
sensus at Thursday's meeting.
The arguments against the
Krauss plan seem to come in two
flavors. The first is purely me
chanical: Some graduate senators
doubted the reliability of any
purely computer-driven voting
system, citing the possibility of
a hardware crash.
But, as Krauss points out, any
mechanized or computerized
voting system can experience
breakdown, including the one
presently being used. If anything,
a change to modern Mac ll's
promises more reliability, not
less.
The second objection is even
less substantial. Graduate
senators worried that, with the
reduction in number of voting
sites from 13 to six, already ap
athetic graduate students might
not notice polling places at all
and hence not vote.
Tough. Why should our elec
tions system cater to the apathet
ic, no matter what their academic
status, by retaining the anti
quated and unpopular status
quo?
In fact, since Krauss' plan
promises much more rapid voting
than before, the results would be
shorter waits and, accordingly,
more student willingness to vote,
not less.
In short, the senate failed the
student body in turning down the
plan for computers. Krauss has
appealed the decision; hopefully,
this time, they will vote the right
way on the right way to vote.
