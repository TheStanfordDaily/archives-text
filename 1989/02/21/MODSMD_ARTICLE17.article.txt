## The
						University should vigorously defend Rushdie 
### 
THE ASSAULT on the novelist
Salman Rushdie and his book,
The Satanic Verses, is at its core
an attack on the vocation of creativity
and the voice of imagination. It thus
constitutes a threat to all intellectuals,
not just to writers, and, as a commu
nity of the mindful, the University —
all universities — ought to be forceful,
public, and, yes, uncompromising in
response.
The issue, of course, is not Islam,
the source of the present anguish, nor
Christianity, the source of a similar
fury against faith, be it religious or
philosophical or political. The issue is
militant fundamentalism and the cult
of unassailable Truth. The danger

arises when these forces secure
patronage by political authority or gain
control over the political process.
The Nobel laureate in literature,
Naguib Mahfouz, has called this latest
outrage an act of "intellectual terror
ism," and we agree. And while we are
comfortably situated far behind the
battle lines, we ought to refuse to
accept the implications of the attack
on Rushdie by doing several things.
We propose that the University's
Public Affairs Office invite Rushdie to
come to Stanford as a speaker and
official guest.
We urge University President Donald
Kennedy to call his fellow presidents at
m£yor universities in this country to

issue a joint, formal invitation to visit
their campuses to discuss his novel
and the current "affair".
We ask the Stanford Bookstore and
local Bay Area booksellers to announce
that they will seek to stock the novel
so that we can read it for ourselves.
We invite the religious communities
connected with Stanford to join us in
condemning the threat to Rushdie's
life and the abandonment of his book
to political and religious opportunism.
