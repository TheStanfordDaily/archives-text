# Six people cannot speak for the entire gay community
## 
### 
At this time of heightened sensitivity
to minority concerns at Stanford, I
was particularly distressed to find
myself quoted in a Feb. 14 Daily arti
cle subtitled, "Live 105 promo dis
tresses Stanford gay, lesbian, bisexual
community."
As the article reported, I was inter
viewed by The Daily and noted that
"five or six" members of the gay and
lesbian community had discussed the
Live 105 advertisement. I fear that the
extension from a handful of individuals
to a generalization about our commu
nity at large shows a serious misun
derstanding.
Stanford is home to thousands of
lesbian, gay and bisexual students,
faculty, and staff. We are a diverse
community: men, women, black, white,
Chicano, Asian and a myriad of others.

I ask that The Daily take special
care to distinguish between one or a
few of us speaking as individuals and a
true community response. To do other
wise seems to show a deep lack of
appreciation for the breadth and diver
sity of the lesbian, gay and bisexual
community at Stanford.
