# Stanford's liberal bias needs to be balanced by Hoover
## 
### 
Whenever you hear discussion about
the Hoover Institution, you can be
sure that Political Science Prof. John
Manley will be preparing accusations
and attacks against it. Why do we
always, always have to hear his com
plaining voice? What is so fundamen

tally wrong with Hoover?
The "problem" certainly cannot be
that the institution is politically biased.
As the article in the Feb. 14 Daily
pointed out, Hoover is much less politi
cally biased than the overwhelmingly
liberal departments of Political Science
and English (and, indeed, the Stanford
campus as a whole). Hoover is a wel
come organization for many people as
one of the very few balancing factors
against the liberalism-run-amuck we
must face here.
According to Manley, "no university
can tolerate within its midst a highly
autonomous, politically active think
tank." My question is quite simply:
Why not?
Where is it written that an indepen
dent organization, like Hoover, must
not be politically active if it has some
link — however loose — to a universi
ty?
I don't think this is really the prob
lem Manley is concerned about. It's
clear that he can't stand the fact that
there is a powerful organization that
actually challenges his political beliefs.
He complained that after the current

director's retirement, Hoover "will still
.. . get conservative money and push
conservative causes." The solution to
this "problem," as Manley says, is to
bring Hoover under stricter University
control and increase the University's
decision-making power within the insti
tution.
According to The Daily, Manley
"wondered how a university, supposedly
motivated by the free discussion of
ideas, could allow itself to become
linked with an institution free from
the normal academic procedures. ..."
My answer is that if a university is
truly committed to maintaining an
environment conducive to the free dis
cussion of ideas, why should it have to
bring under control any group that
uses that environment?
Manley doesn't agree. According to
Manley, "The political arm of Hoover
would have to go or be shut down."
Doesn't this sound like censorship and
regulation of political expression?
Didn't our Constitution try to do away
with that 200 years ago?
