## Women and minorities face academic and institutional obstacles 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
There can be more snarls in the flow
of minorities and women into engineering
than 5 o'clock traffic on the Bayshore
Freeway. And the routes into an engi
neering career in academia are more
obstructed than rush hour blocked by an
accident.
From the undergraduate to the faculty
level, the numbers of women and minor
ities in engineering continue to lag far
behind those of white males.
Despite efforts to alleviate this im
balance, most women and minorities still
face unusually difficult obstacles before
obtaining engineering degrees.
When women and minorities interested
in engineering enter high school, guidance
counselors often discourage them from
entering a field dominated by white
males, according to engineering faculty
at Stanford.

Those who overcome this initial hurdle
and hope to pursue engineering on the
undergraduate and graduate level soon
encounter other obstacles â€” college ad
missions staffs often insensitive to the
cultures of minorities, financial concerns,
subtly oppressive male attitudes in class,
few role models among faculty and a lack
of support for the challenges they face.
While both emotional and financial
support for women and minorities in en
gineering has increased over the last few
years, the impenetrable cycle of white
male dominance rolls on.
Ironically, the efforts of the engineering
industry to break the cycle have in some
ways made it even more exclusive. Many
women and minorities who do earn a
Ph.D. in engineering turn away from
academia to the financial rewards of
private corporate careers and industry's
financial courtship of minorities and
women. Thus, the faculty and role models
at universities continue to be overwhelm

ingly white males.
Lopsided enrollment figures
The lopsided enrollment in the School
of Engineering over the past five years
confirms this trend.
Between 1984 and 1988, on the under
graduate level there has been an average
of 487 male engineering majors compared
to 145 female, a 10-3 ratio. Both groups
have been declining in numbers since
1984.
Graduate school statistics show an even
heavier bias toward men, who have a 6-1
majority. The number of graduate stu
dents overall has been steadily increasing,
but the male-female ratio has stayed rela
tively constant.
The situation for minorities is also un
balanced.
Since 1984, on average only 2.5 percent
of engineering students have been black.
