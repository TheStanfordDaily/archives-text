# A 						clogged engineering pipeline
## Women and minorities face academic and institutional obstacles 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
There can be more snarls in the flow
of minorities and women into engineering
than 5 o'clock traffic on the Bayshore
Freeway. And the routes into an engi
neering career in academia are more
obstructed than rush hour blocked by an
accident.
From the undergraduate to the faculty
level, the numbers of women and minor
ities in engineering continue to lag far
behind those of white males.
Despite efforts to alleviate this im
balance, most women and minorities still
face unusually difficult obstacles before
obtaining engineering degrees.
When women and minorities interested
in engineering enter high school, guidance
counselors often discourage them from
entering a field dominated by white
males, according to engineering faculty
at Stanford.

Those who overcome this initial hurdle
and hope to pursue engineering on the
undergraduate and graduate level soon
encounter other obstacles — college ad
missions staffs often insensitive to the
cultures of minorities, financial concerns,
subtly oppressive male attitudes in class,
few role models among faculty and a lack
of support for the challenges they face.
While both emotional and financial
support for women and minorities in en
gineering has increased over the last few
years, the impenetrable cycle of white
male dominance rolls on.
Ironically, the efforts of the engineering
industry to break the cycle have in some
ways made it even more exclusive. Many
women and minorities who do earn a
Ph.D. in engineering turn away from
academia to the financial rewards of
private corporate careers and industry's
financial courtship of minorities and
women. Thus, the faculty and role models
at universities continue to be overwhelm

ingly white males.
Lopsided enrollment figures
The lopsided enrollment in the School
of Engineering over the past five years
confirms this trend.
Between 1984 and 1988, on the under
graduate level there has been an average
of 487 male engineering majors compared
to 145 female, a 10-3 ratio. Both groups
have been declining in numbers since
1984.
Graduate school statistics show an even
heavier bias toward men, who have a 6-1
majority. The number of graduate stu
dents overall has been steadily increasing,
but the male-female ratio has stayed rela
tively constant.
The situation for minorities is also un
balanced.
Since 1984, on average only 2.5 percent
of engineering students have been black.
Hispanics have contributed 3.1
percent; Asians 9 percent; and Na
tive Americans 0.2 perccnt of the
engineering population. Black and
Asian students have made signif
icant gains in percentage points
since 1984.
"All across the country the
numbers of minorities and women
in engineering are low," said
Cheryll Hawthorne, acting asso
ciate dean of student affairs for
the School of Engineering.
The pipelining problem
According to Prof. Charles
Kruger, the school's associate
dean for faculty and academic af
fairs, the low number of minority
engineering students later trans
lates into low numbers of avail
able minority engineering profes
sors. This "pipelining problem" is
readily evident at Stanford, where,
as of last year, 212 of the 220
engineering faculty members were
males. Of the eight females on
the faculty, two were untenured.
According to the General
Electric Foundation, of the 21,500
engineering professors nation
wide, 200 are black, 300 are
Hispanic and 400 are women.
Although there are many
reasons for these awkward ratios,
the preponderance of non
minority males and subtle but op
pressive male attitudes prevalent
in engineering environments is of
ten cited as the factor in
women's and minorities' decisions
to shun a in engineering.
"In classes, there is a general
atmosphere of male-dominance,"
said Alicia Martinez, a sophomore
in industrial engineering, who is
also secretary of the So
ciety <.' Chicano. Lath Engineers
and Scientists. "There is a lot of
pressure. Minorities have to work
extra hard to prove we can do it."
Eventually, the discouragement
of women and minorities blocks
the pipeline for these students and
perpetuates the system of white
male dominance.
Combating early discouragement
Some say the initial discourage
ment of women and minorities
begins when students are in high
school. Many high schools do not
provide adequate pre-college
training or fail to make women
and minorities aware of career
paths in engineering.

High school counselors often
persuade women to avoid the
"male-oriented field" of engineer
ing, according to Daniel Ber
shader, professor of aerody
namics and astronautics.
Also, Stanford's high tuition
and stringent acceptance policies
may discourage many potential
minority engineers from applying,
Hawthorne said.

obstacles has been the Math, En
gineering and Science Achieve
ment program, a nationwide or
ganization devoted to providing
minority high school and junior
high students with information
about career opportunities, schol
arship information and enrich
ment activities in engineering.
The Stanford chapter of the
achievement program, which
Hawthorne said has been very
successful, serves eight high
schools and one junior high be
tween Belmont and Mountain
View and soon plans to add three
middle and three elementary
schools
Members of Stanford's Chicano/
Latino engineering student organ
ization help, too, by participating
in an outreach program and tu
toring students in algebra once a
week at a local high school with
a large minority population.
Undcrgrads fight for respect
But once minority and women
students do become engineering
undergraduates, the problems do
not disappear.
"Many women become dis
traught by the male attitudes in
class and in lab, and by the over
whelming number of male profes
sors and teaching assistants,"
Hawthorne said.

Guerra said she has talked to
women who claim some TAs often
don't give as much credit or re
spect to women as they do to men
who do the same work.
She added, though, that the
male domination makes her
studies more challenging, and she
did not take the male-female ratio
into account when she declared
her major.
Hawthorne also qualified her
statement by saying that minority
students who apply and are ac
cepted here are usually dedicated
enough to pursue engineering
despite outside pressures, and she
worries more about those students
who do not apply. She said they
may be concerned Stanford is not
sensitive enough to their needs.
According to Hawthorne, the
School of Engineering is currently
most concerned with accepting
and maintaining minority gradu
ate and Ph.D. candidates.
Problems with admissions
A major problem facing poten
tial minority graduate students is
miscommunication in the gradu
ate admissions process. Most of
the application readers are white
males and they may negatively
interpret information on a minor
ity student's application that em
phasizes aspects consistent with
his or her cultural upbringing,
Hawthorne said.
For example, a student whose
culture emphasizes humility may
withhold or downplay certain
achievements on an application.
The reader, however, may inter
pret this humility as a lack of
aggressiveness or preparation.
Hawthorne said the solution is
to increase the number of women
. 1 minority fa ulty n
missions staff instead of forcing
applicants to conform to majority
standards.
She said the school is beginning
to reorganize its office to provide
staff to meet minority needs. By
April 1, the school plans to hire
three new deans, an associate
dean for graduate studies, an as
sistant dean for undergraduate af
fairs and an assistant dean for
precollege affairs, all focusing on
minority affairs.
"The creation of t;he new deans
is one of the best steps so far,"
Guerra said. "We haven't had
someone full time to help organize
links between • minority students
and faculty "

In addition, Hawthorne said,
the school is implementing a plan
to compensate for the financial
difficulties commonly facing mi
nority graduate applicants. She
said qualified graduate applicants
without sufficient personal finan
cial resources to attend Stanford
are often rejected.
Alleviating financial concerns
Currently, many minority grad
uate students who are admitted
to the School of Engineering
receive a yearly $5,000 stipend
and a $1,500 grant toward tuition
from the National Consortium for
Graduate Degrees for Minorities
in Engineering, a consortium of
25 universities nationwide includ
ing Stanford.
If the graduate student cannot
meet tuition with the grant, the
School of Engineering makes up
the difference. Individual depart
ments supplement the differences
between the stipends and the nor
mal earnings of graduate stu
dents.
The problem now, according to
Rose Ewing, administrator for
faculty affairs and graduate finan
cial aid in the school, is that in
dividual departments are having
difficulty supplementing the
stipend grant. La3t year, the def
icit was around $93,000 for all
departments, Ewing said.
But starting next year, she said,
the School of Engineering will
help individual departments make
up for short falls in graduate
stipends. This should serve to
make Stanford more attractive to
minority graduate candidates,
Hawthorne said.
The paradox of industry
Hawthorne sai i support from
industry for minority graduate
students has been "outstanding"
in providing money for fellow
ships and financial aid and offer
ing interviews geared toward mi
norities.
"Industry has gone out of its
way to extend a hand to minori
ties," she said.
This helping hand, however, is
snatching up many of these Ph.D.
recipients into private corpora
tions and thus failing to increase
the diversity of the pool of poten
tial university faculty.
Sharon Gerlach, assistant chair
of the Electrical Engineering De
partment, said it is also hard to
attract female faculty because
they can make more money in
industry than in academia.
"There are currently not as
many women faculty as we would
like," Kruger said. "The problem
is even more severe for minori
ties."

Kruger said the School of En
gineering is making progress in
its hiring of minorities and wom
en, and that several are now ap
plying. The Electrical Engineering
Department hired its first female
professor this year.
He said the school involves itself
in faculty searches, writes to or
ganizations that suggest qualified
rondida f es and actively
agcs its graduate students to
pursue a Ph.D., which is implicitly
required in order to become a pro
fessor.
"You know how it is," Ber
shader said. "We look for the very
best person. But in the entire
world, there is an extremely lim
ited number of highly competent
women in aerodynamics and
astronautics — you can count
them on your fingers." In Ber
shader's department, there are 17
male and no female faculty.
Prof. Margaret Brandeau, one
of three female professors in the
Industrial Engineering Depart
ment, said Stanford is extremely
supportive of female faculty. She
said she would like to see more,
but acknowledges that they are
hard to find.
"In engineering in general, a lot
of women get turned off, partially
because there aren't a lot of role
models," Brandeau said.

An extensive support system
There may not be many faculty
role models, but there is an ex
tensive support system for women
and minority student engineers
here.
The Women's Science and En
gineering Network, for example,
assigns undergraduate female en
gineering and science students a
graduate "mentor" in their field
with whom they can r?iacus£
classes, career paths and any
problems they may be having.
Currently 100 mentors and 200
undergraduates participate in the
network, which began in 1986.
The group meets regularly and
organizes trips to such places as
the U.S. Geological Survey and
Xerox Palo Alto Research Park.
The group also invites female
guests to speak to students.
Network Director Andre Sur
sock said that a mentor once took
her student into her lab and later
found her a job there. The student
went on later to publish papers
from work in the lab.
"The mentor can also be some
one who is married and has a
child and a career and can do it
all and survive," Sursock said.
Network member Lea Montefal
con, a senior in computer science,
said, "It'fi neat to have someone
to talk to who knows what you're
talking about."
