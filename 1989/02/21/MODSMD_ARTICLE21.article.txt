## The
						illusion of equality 
### 
The White Team and the Black Team
are playing the last football game of the
season. The White Team owns the stadi
um, owns the referees and has been al
lowed to field nine times as many players.
For almost four quarters, the White Team
has cheated on every play and, as a con
sequence, the score is White Team 140,
Black Team 3. Only 10 seconds remain
in the game, but as the White quarterback
huddles with his team before the final
play, a light suddenly shines from his
eyes.
"So how about it, boys?" he asks his
men. "What do you say from here on we
play fair."
— Andrew Ward, The New York Times
ON JAN. 23, in a 6-3 vote, the
Supreme Court declared that it
was unconstitutional for the city
of Richmond, Va. to require that 30 per
cent of all city contracts go to minority
businesses.
Why is this decision so important?
Should minorities be given "a special
break" to remedy past discrimination?
Should men and women of today pay for
the sins of their ancestors?
These are the questions often asked
when the topic of affirmative action
arises. One thing that many opponents
of affirmative action don't seem to realize
is that "the system," the institutions of
this country, were created unequal and
these inequalities are still present within
it.
It is naive to assume that a system
which has been created for one group of
people (white, Protestant, heterosexual

males) and has historically discriminated
against those who were not a part of this
group (minorities, women, homosexuals,
etc.) for more than 200 years to be equal
in a matter of 25 or 30 years. Let's keep
in mind that it took more than 150 years
to abolish slavery, and we still have yet
to deal with discriminatory laws against
homosexuals.
The "Richmond Plan" was attempting
to combat the past racism that existed
in this city — which was once known as
"the capital of the Confederacy." Surely
a 30 percent minority business require
ment for all city contracts is not asking
too much in a city with a population of
220,000 people, 50 percent of whom are
minorities.
It is important to realize that affirm
ative action plans such as this one are
not permanent remedies, but temporary
ones. The purpose of such plans is to get
minorities into "the system" so they are
able to compete fairly and on the same
level as everyone else.
Once this has been achieved, there will
be no need for such remedies.
Let's consider for a moment companies
that have seniority policies. A constant
complaint concerning affirmative action
promotion plans is that many people who
have been at the company for a longer
period of time, may be "passed over" for
promotions because there is a percentage
of minority promotions (a quota, of sorts)
that has to be met.
Is it a coincidence that the people who
have been on the job longest are almost
always white? No. It was not until 25
years ago that minorities were

enfranchised into the promotion policies
of most businesses in America — and
that is a very generous estimation.
A seniority rule, in this case, would
seem to be similar to a grandfather
clause. How can a minority be expected
to have seniority when he or she has
been systematically excluded from certain
areas of the work force for the past 15-25
years? At this time, such policies are
inherently discriminatory.
One cannot simply say "let's be equal
now" when there is still so much ine
quality within our institutions. A system,
such as ours, which has been excluding
people since its founding cannot be ex
pected to have rid itself of all its discrim
ination within a span of 25 years.
In deciding the Richmond case, the
msyority of the Supreme Court did not
take into account the discrimination
which is inherent in the foundations of
the various institutions in this country.
A decision such as this has the potential
to set back the civil rights movement at
least 25 years.
Until equality of all minority groups
has been achieved, we must use whatever
remedies are at our disposal to include
minorities in the institutions of this na
tion.
