"The Question of Hu"

Imagine a middle-aged Cantonese in filthy European
clothes running through the streets of Paris of 1725, carrying
a Chinese banner urging the segregation of the sexes. What
does the Paris beggar think when he confronts this curious
Chinese?
Such is one of the many questions put forth by Jonathan
Spence's book "The Question of Hu."
Spence tells the story of Foucquet, a scholarly French
Jesuit missionary, who returns home from China with a
Chinese secretary, John Hu. Foucquet brings Hu to a Europe
engrossed by religious and intellectual arguments concerning
its understanding of China, a Europe absorbed in political
posturing of both state and church.
Yet the author does not let this backdrop overshadow his
story. Instead, Spence pursues the paradox and question of
John Hu, a Chinese in 18th century Europe.
Spence places Hu in a day-to-day context by exquisitely
drawing out details from the historical record such as 18th
century Europe's physical landscape and architecture. Skill
fully, Spence records Hu's outward actions and the events
which surround him â€” but from which he is largely divorced.
Spence's ability to draw upon historical detail fascinates
as we see Hu through the eyes of various individuals and
various components of 18th century French society: the mer
chant, the keepers of the lunatic asylum, the servants, the
religious superiors.
Every detail Spence pulls from the available documents
seems plausible; every description seems based on eyewitness
testimony. From a few words describing the light from a

Charenton, near Paris
Hu stands a moment at the doorway
to the reception hall, looking in. The
room is filled with about a dozen seated
men in clerical robes. The attendants
who dressed him and escorted him
from his cell wait at his side, in case he
should be prompted to some act of
violence. They have not told him why he
has been summoned, since he knows
no French and they no Chinese.

prison window of a particular size and shape, the reader can
imagine the characters in their time and place.
Spence's depictions of historical factors are equally lean
and accurate: from his depiction of class differences and the
era's political machinations to descriptions of how the Paris
police lieutenant got his job, the cynicism of the royal librarian
and the disposition of the passengers in a carriage.
Unfortunately, Spence is rarely able to give Hu his own
voice because the historical record does not yield one up.
During the difficult years Hu spent in France, he learned
no European language and left only one letter in Chinese.
He was able to speak to only four people: three Jesuits and
a Tonkinese convert. Although he reportedly spoke of writing
an account of Europe from his Chinese perspective, none
exists. We only know of Hu's whereabouts and actions from
the accounts of those Europeans around him.
For this reason, Spence allows most of the narrative to
be recited by Jean-Francois Foucquet, the French missionary
who brings, and later laments bringing, Hu to Europe.
Foucquet's character is a complex one. He does not emerge
as a likeable fellow. Yet there is an undeniable fascination
in the tension of Foucquet's life: between the religious, schol
arly and political components of the years he spends working
towards his vision for the Catholic mission in China.
Foucquet is convinced that he will be able to prove scien
tifically that Christianity is universal, prefigured even in the
Chinese philisophical and religious record itself. He labors
unceasingly to fashion this key.
Foucquet is perserverant through protracted frustrations.
He is brilliantly acerbic but never mean-spirited. After rela
tions with Hu break down, Foucquet is tormented for years
as he wonders what to do with his former secretary. One
wonders how can Foucquet can think he has the key to
Chinese thought when he cannot even manage the erratic
actions of one Chinese assistant.
After four-and-a-half trying years, Hu is forceably sent
back to his homeland, leaving the great implicit question of
the book unanswered: what Hu's impressions of Europe are.
Nor do we learn what happens to Foucquet's grand plan for
unity of Chinese thought and Christian religion. (Foucquet's
massive corpus of writings has been carefully analyzed in
another book by John Witek.)
These omissions detract nothing from Spence's book. The
story of Hu is brilliantly and simply put forth; it tells us
much about the society of Catholic Europe of the Old Regime,
its view of the world and the treatment of a nonconformist.
Purposefully, Spence allows the questions of Hu to remain.
