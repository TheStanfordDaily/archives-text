# KEPLER'S
## A 						bookstore with history 
### Marina Krakovsky 
Kepler's Books in Menlo Park is a
bookstore with a history.
For Roy Kepler, the store's founder,
working at Kepler's was more than just
a job.
"My father was very politically ac
tive," says Clark Kepler, Roy's son and
Kepler's current owner. "The store
served as a forum for his beliefs."
Roy Kepler was a conscientious dis
senter duing World War 11. Arrested for
withholding his federal income taxes as
a protest against the war, his store later
became a gathering point for civil rights
activists and anti-Vietnam demonstra
tors.
"Kepler's was a happening place," says
Clark Kepler, "It was a fun place to go
into. . . . Inside it was like a hippies'
bedroom."
But Kepler's was not popular with
everyone. At one point, recalls Clark
Kepler, a group of right-wing demon
strators, convinced that Roy Kepler was
a communist, made death threats and
"bombed the store and threw hatchets
at it."
Though Kepler's of today may lack
the atmosphere and character it did in
the past, people still come up to Clark
Kepler thanking him for what his father
did, or simply telling him, "I dropped
my first acid at Kepler's."
If Kepler's is no longer a site of drug
experimentation, it is still a staunch sup
porter of alternative literature. Today,

Kepler's has an extensive magazine rack,
including international magazines, a
large children's collection and, as the
current owner notes with pride, "no
teenybopper publications."
In each case, the current owner is
careful to be sensitive to his father's
original ideology; he maintains the non
violence section that his father founded
and refuses to sell a book that describes
how to make bombs. He also consciously
selects books and magazines that might
not be available elsewhere and avoids
those that can be found "in any
drugstore."
Another tradition Clark Kepler con
tinues is the regular "events" when au
thors of "serious fiction and nonfiction"
come to discuss their books. One of these
authors, noted Bay Area writer and
Ghandian scholar, Ira Sandperl, contin
ues to work at the store.
This summer, the store will move to
a larger, "more customer-friendly" loca
tion, says the owner. Yet Kepler's is not
moving far, for as Clark Kepler explains,
good independent bookstores "are
usually in communities like this . . . that
can read, that can support a good book
store." He adds that "if this bookstore
were in Fresno or somewhere with a
less educated population, we wouldn't
last."

Editor's Note: Although the moving date
is not yet fixed, the new Kepler's will
appear at the corner of El Camino Real
and Ravenswood, in Menlo Park.
