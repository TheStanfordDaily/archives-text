## Cardinal hoops survives scare to beat USC 68-52 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
LOS ANGELES - Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery has
done a lot of things right this
year. So, when he predicted last
Thursday that USC would give
the Cardinal a tough game, it was
not to be taken lightly.
And sure enough he was right
— at least for the first 30
minutes.
But, as it is wont to do, the
cream rose to the top and the
Cardinal (21-5, 12-3 in Pacific 10
Conference play) knocked off the
Trojans 68-52 before a mere 2,531
fans at the Sports Arena.

Cardinal 68, Trojans 52

On an night where Howard
Wright and Todd Lichti were the
team leaders, with 20 and 16
points respectively, it would be
easy to assume it was business
as usual for the Cardinal.
However, without key contribu
tions off the bench from Deshon
Wingate, Scott Meinert and Adam
Keefe, it might well have turned
into one of the biggest upsets of
the year in the Pac-10.
"We might have dodged a bullet
tonight," Montgomery said after
the game. "We were out of synch
and made too many mental mis
takes."
As a result of those mistakes
and some inspired play from
USC's Ronnie Coleman (a game
high 26 points on 11-of-13 shoot
ing), the Trojans were in position
to win the game midway through
the second half.
USC cut an eight-point halftime
deficit to just two with three bas
kets in the first two minutes of
he second stanza. The teams then
traded hoops before Duane
Cooper's fast-break layup knotted
the game at 41.
The Cardinal called timeout
and the USC band went into its
rendition of "All Right Now."

There was 16:11 on the clock
when play resumed, but it was
during the timeout that Mont
gomery made his best move of
the night — subbing Meinert for
Terry Taylor.
It's not that Taylor was having
a bad game so much as that
Meinert would step in and imme
diately make things happen. On
Stanford's first possession he
made a move to the hoop and got
fouled. Meinert made one of the
free throws.
Then USC's Chris Munk scored
off a rebound to give the Trojans
a 43-42 lead — their first and
only one of the game.
But Trojan Coach George
Raveling angered the officials by
complaining that Stanford was
"mugging" Coleman and drew a
technical. Lichti made both free
throws to regain the lead for Stan
ford at 44-43.
Raveling said, "I felt that at
that point in the game the tech
nical didn't have much effect."
He may have been right because
in the next four minutes each
team scored five points, culminat
ing in a Munk layup with 10:06
remaining to bring it to 49-48,
Cardinal.
Then the roof caved in for USC.
Keefe followed a Lichti miss with
a layup. Wright scored on a fast
break basket. USC called timeout,
but it didn't help as Lichti stole
the ball on the Trojans' next pos
session and layed it in.
Meinert pushed the ball up
court with ease, virtually ignoring
the USC press when it was
employed, and penetrated
through the lane to create some
things for Stanford. Keefe did his
part with a couple of steals, a
couple of blocked shots and a
bunch of rebounds.
"I just came out and played
hard," Meinert said. "I didn't
think we were being very aggres
sive."
It was his second straight ex
cellent game (Meinert also played
well against California).
"Meinert did a nice job defen
sively (as well)," Montgomery said

of Meinert's work in the 1-1-3
zone Stanford employed which
frustrated USC's attempts to get
the ball to Coleman in the second
half.
The aggressiveness was con
tagious as the Cardinal put to
gether a tempestuous 19-1 run,
with Wright scoring eight of the
Cardinal's points (USC's only
point came on a Coleman free
throw). Stanford had a 68-49 lead
when the dust finally settled.
"I felt the scoreboard was bro
ken (on our side)," Raveling said.
Ken Countryman made a 3-
pointer with four seconds remain
ing in the game to put the final
tally at 68-52.
The Cardinal had started quick
ly, scoring the game's first seven
points including a Lichti dunk
right from the tipoff.
With Stanford up 11-6 Wright
was fouled by Munk. He made
both free throws (en route to a
perfect 6-of-6 from the line in the
half) to give the Cardinal another
seven point lead.
But then Stanford fouled the
Trojans three times in a row. Pol
lard made both of his free throws
but Coleman, who totaled 17 in
the half, missed three of his four
and Stanford led 13-6.
Wingate's dunk with 8:23 to
play opened the lead to eight at
21-13 and would be the start of
one of the finest nights in his
career.
With just under five minutes
Wingate hit two straight 17-foot
jumpers to put the score at 29-20,
the Cardinal's biggest lead to that
point.
Moore layed it in but then
fouled Wingate on the next pos
session. Wingate sunk both
throws and in so doing matched
his career high with his eighth
point.
"I was just trying to play as
hard as I can," Wingate said. "I've
worked a little overtime trying to
improve my game.
"I was just taking what the de
fense gave me," he added. "They
