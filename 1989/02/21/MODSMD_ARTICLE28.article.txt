## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
On their long voyage to the
NCAA championships, the Stan
ford women's tennis team was
buffeted by the Waves Friday
before coming ashore to execute
a Cortez-like conquest of the Az
tecs the next afternoon.

Cardinal 5, Waves 4
Cardinal 9, Aztecs 0

In facing No. 9 Pepperdine, the
Cardinal knew going in they'd be
facing their toughest match of the
season to that point. The Waves
have two Ail-Americans in Ginger
Helgeson and Janna Kovacevich,
who play at No. 1 and No. 2
singles respectively.
But with the return of sopho
mores Tami Whitlinger and
Sandra Birch to the lineup Stan
ford was able to counter with two
All-Americans of its own.
Whitlinger, the winner of the
recent Rolex tournament, blew by
Helgeson 6-2, 6-2 showing no ill-

effects from her wrist injury. Still,
discretion being the better part
of valor, Whitlinger would sit out
the doubles to limit the risk of
reinjuring herself.
She had the luxury because
though Birch fell to Helgeson 6-3,
6-3, Stanford swept the remainder
of the singles matches to assure
victory in the meet.
"Birch was showing the effects
of not playing the [Rolex]," Stan
ford Coach Frank Brennan said.
"She's not match tough yet."
At No. 3, Lisa Green downed
Camilla Ohrman 6-0, 6-1. Debbie
Graham started slowly before be
sting Anna Brunstom 4-6, 6-1, 6-2
at No. 4. Teri Whitlinger had an
easy time at No. 5 scoring a 6-1,
6-2 victory over Noelle Porter. At
No. 6, Kylie Johnson continued
to impress with a 6-1, 6-0 victory
over Carrie Crisell.
It was during the doubles when
Stanford acted like a carefree
beachgoer: They didn't let the
Waves drown them, but instead
got sucked in by the undertow.
The first squall came at No. 3
where Valerie Wilson and Carina
Rolley fell 6-4, 6-2 to Crisell and
Ohrman.
Then Green and Johnson
dropped the No. 2 match 7-5, 4-6
to Brunstom-Kovacevich.
Finally, Birch and Graham

dropped the No. 1 match 6-2, 2-6,
4-6 to Helgeson-Porter.
The result: a very deceptive 5-4
final tally two hours after the
match had already been decided.
"That's why coaches get paid
to worry," Brennan said.
Saturday, against a lesser squad
from San Diego State, the Cardi
nal executed a successful
blitzkrieg and blew by the Aztecs
9-0.
Graham came back from her
lackluster performace Friday to
vanquish Kristen Hill 6-2, 6-0.
Graham said getting used to play
ing No. 4 is "kind of hard."
Tami Whitlinger knocked off
Sondra Mitchell 6-1, 6-3 at No.
1. Birch, perhaps gaining some of
that match toughness, dusted
Dorey Brandt 6-4, 6-2 at No. 2.
At No. 3, Green had no trouble
with Jessica Buss in scoring a 6-2,
6-1 win.
