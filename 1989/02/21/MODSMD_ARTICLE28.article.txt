On their long voyage to the
NCAA championships, the Stan
ford women's tennis team was
buffeted by the Waves Friday
before coming ashore to execute
a Cortez-like conquest of the Az
tecs the next afternoon.

Cardinal 5, Waves 4
Cardinal 9, Aztecs 0

In facing No. 9 Pepperdine, the
Cardinal knew going in they'd be
facing their toughest match of the
season to that point. The Waves
have two Ail-Americans in Ginger
Helgeson and Janna Kovacevich,
who play at No. 1 and No. 2
singles respectively.
But with the return of sopho
mores Tami Whitlinger and
Sandra Birch to the lineup Stan
ford was able to counter with two
All-Americans of its own.
Whitlinger, the winner of the
recent Rolex tournament, blew by
Helgeson 6-2, 6-2 showing no ill-

effects from her wrist injury. Still,
discretion being the better part
of valor, Whitlinger would sit out
the doubles to limit the risk of
reinjuring herself.
She had the luxury because
though Birch fell to Helgeson 6-3,
6-3, Stanford swept the remainder
of the singles matches to assure
victory in the meet.
"Birch was showing the effects
of not playing the [Rolex]," Stan
ford Coach Frank Brennan said.
"She's not match tough yet."
At No. 3, Lisa Green downed
Camilla Ohrman 6-0, 6-1. Debbie
