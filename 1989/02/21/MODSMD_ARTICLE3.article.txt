# Commission takes 2nd crack at computerized ASSU vote
## 
### Rob Burwell Staff writer 
Since at first it did not succeed,
the ASSU Elections Commission
has decided to try and try again
to push its spring quarter elec
tions into the computer age.
Responding to an ASSU Senate
vote that rejected the use of com
puter voting machines, the elec
tions commission decided this
weekend to resubmit with changes
its wave-of-the-future plan to
computerize ASSU elections, ac
cording to elections commissioner
Steve Krauss.
The elections commission plans
to resubmit its proposal to the
senate March 9 with changes ad
dressing the two main concerns
voiced by the graduate senate
members whose voting bloc stalled
the plan. The graduate senate
members criticized the proposal,
targeting the possibility of a hard
drive crash and decreased
visibility of polling places.
To provide insurance in case of

hard drive failure, printers will
be hooked up to print out a coded
ballot for every person, said
Krauss, a sophomore.
The elections commission will
also try to install machines in
highly visible locations in re
sponse to the objection raised by
the graduate senators that grad
uates had a tendency to vote on
the spot when they passed by
voting sites, he added.
Nonetheless, Krauss explained
that the possible new sites could
include the Post Office and the
Clock Tower and would be small
with only four or five terminals,
compared to Meyer Library or
Tresidder Union sites, which
would each have 15 to 20. He said
there would be signs sending
people to larger voting places.
"The idea would be to get people
interested in voting, and if there
were lines at the smaller voting
places, they could walk the 100
or so yards to the larger voting
stations," he said.
However, Krauss warned,

"None of the changes are entirely
official. We still have to make sure
they are feasible." He explained
that both changes can occur only
if the elections commission can
obtain more computer hardware,
which will be determined later
this week.
Assoc. Elections Commissioner
Mike Conte said the graduate
senators who objected "had
legitimate concerns." Although he
said the possibility of a hard drive
crash was low, he agreed it was
a problem that had to be ad
dressed.
Conte, a junior, also agreed that
the decreased visibility of polling
sites could pose a problem. "We're
working to let them know our
changes will work," he said.
According to Conte, last year'*
elections commission had to spend
a considerable amount of money
to rent ballot booths from Santa
Clara County.
