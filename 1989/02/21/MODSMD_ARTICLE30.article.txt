## Gymnasts win Maples meet 
### 
They're back!
After a period of hibernation,
during which they barely man
aged to defeat mediocre oppo
nents, the Stanford men gym
nasts woke up and, relieved of
most of their early season inju
ries, scored 277.80 points to re
establish the Cardinal among
the nation's best teams.
Saturday afternoon at Maples
Pavilion, Stanford defeated UC-
Santa Barbara by over nine
points, improving its record to
6-2 and avenging a loss to these
same Gauchos three weeks ago.
The impressive team scoring
total came despite the absence
of co-captain Adam Forman who
recently suffered a minor shoul
der injury.
It was a performance of which
the Cardinal knew it was capable
eventually, but was not expecting
at this point in the season with
Forman out and freshman Tim
Ryan recovering from a pulled
forearm muscle.

"I wasn't expecting this kind
of a good performance," Stan
ford Coach Sadao Hamada said.
"The guys really hit the good
routines. ... Definitely, it's one
of the top three scores in the
country (at this time)."
Junior Conrad Voorsanger led
the way individually, winning
the meet's all-around competi
tion with 56.45 points. His
scores of 9.75 on the parallel
bars and 9.70 on the pommel
horse were the meet's highest.
However, it was not individual
prominence but across-the-board
consistency which led to such a
high score. The floor exercise
and parallel bars events were ex
emplary, with no Cardinal com
petitors scoring below 9.20.
"On the events where we had
really good scores, we had a
number of good routines leading
up to the final high score," Ryan
said. "That's part of the strategy
