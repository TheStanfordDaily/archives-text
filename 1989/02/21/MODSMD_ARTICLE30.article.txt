## Gymnasts win Maples meet 
### 
They're back!
After a period of hibernation,
during which they barely man
aged to defeat mediocre oppo
nents, the Stanford men gym
nasts woke up and, relieved of
most of their early season inju
ries, scored 277.80 points to re
establish the Cardinal among
the nation's best teams.
Saturday afternoon at Maples
Pavilion, Stanford defeated UC-
Santa Barbara by over nine
points, improving its record to
6-2 and avenging a loss to these
same Gauchos three weeks ago.
The impressive team scoring
total came despite the absence
of co-captain Adam Forman who
recently suffered a minor shoul
der injury.
It was a performance of which
the Cardinal knew it was capable
eventually, but was not expecting
at this point in the season with
Forman out and freshman Tim
Ryan recovering from a pulled
forearm muscle.

"I wasn't expecting this kind
of a good performance," Stan
ford Coach Sadao Hamada said.
"The guys really hit the good
routines. ... Definitely, it's one
of the top three scores in the
country (at this time)."
Junior Conrad Voorsanger led
the way individually, winning
the meet's all-around competi
tion with 56.45 points. His
scores of 9.75 on the parallel
bars and 9.70 on the pommel
horse were the meet's highest.
However, it was not individual
prominence but across-the-board
consistency which led to such a
high score. The floor exercise
and parallel bars events were ex
emplary, with no Cardinal com
petitors scoring below 9.20.
"On the events where we had
really good scores, we had a
number of good routines leading
up to the final high score," Ryan
said. "That's part of the strategy

of the coach in lining up his gym
nasts: to arrange them in that
kind of an order."
Conversely, the Gauchos placed
their top two individuals, David
Stow and Mark Brodman, oecond
and third in the all-around stand
ings but were unable to keep up
with Stanford because of a weak
supporting cast.
Cardinal gymnasts Charles
Loop, Scott Schaffer and Andy
Ropp each surpassed the 54-point
mark individually while Tim
Wang was just half a tenth below
it. Ryan competed in five of the
six events, totaling 47.40 points
for an average of 9.45 per event.
The meet was Stanford's first
at Maples this year. Many of the
sets showcased new maneuvers
and sequences, some of which
have not yet been perfected. These
routines, plus those to which more

advanced tricks are still to be
added, will be closer to their peak
condition when the Cardinal
returns to Maples next Sunday.

Women's gymnastics
finishes second in L.A.
Stanford gymnastics Coach
Homer Sardina is fond of saying,
"You're only as strong as your
weakest link."
At last Friday's women's gym
nastics meet against Washington,
UC-Santa Barbara and Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo, the weakest link
was not any performer on the
Stanford team, but rather the
scores handed down by the judges.
Undeservedly low marks resulted
in only a second place finish as
the Cardinal fell to Washington
185.25 to 186.15, though Stanford
beat UC Santa Barbara's 177.40
and San Luis Obispo's 178.40.
The Cardinal could not be upset

with its performance, however, as
the team turned in top-level
routines on each event. Vaulting
included two handspring fronts as
freshman Adriana Duffy made her
mark with a 9.35 and senior Sheri
Evenson started the meet strong
with a 9.50.
On bars, freshman Denise Vil
lars made her difficult routine
look easy and effortless as she
swung to a 9.55, and Evenson kept
her momentum going with a clean
9.35 routine.
Beam gave senior Laurence
George the opportunity to per
form a beautifully danced 9.45
routine and Villars stunned the
audience with a flip-flop, flip-flop,
lay-out, resulting in a 9.20.
Behind Washington by .7, the
Cardinal hoped to make up the
difference on floor exercise. Even
son's energetic routine earned her
a 9.40 and freshmen Shira
Wohlberg and Nicki Kobrine both
put in solid 9.20 performances,
but the team came up short by .9.

Bright spots included Evenson's
all-around score of 37.45, tying
her personal record and earning
her second-place all-around
honors. At Saturday's meet down
at UCLA, Evenson once again
brought in this score. Unfortu
nately, the rest of the Cardinal
did not fare as well as they man
aged to produce only a 183.65
team score because of a rash of
falls on the beam.
The tragedy in the loss on Fri
day was that most of the .9 could
be attributed to judging that was
less than equitable, according to
Sardina.
"The difference shows up when
the judges are deciding between
giving a 9.20 and a 9.40," Sardina
said. "Our judges don't give us
the benefit of the doubt, so we
get a 9.20." As a result, Sardina
plans to approach the judges with
the problem in hopes of affecting
a change.

finishes second in L.A.
Stanford gymnastics Coach
Homer Sardina is fond of saying,
"You're only as strong as your
weakest link."
At last Friday's women's gym
nastics meet against Washington,
UC-Santa Barbara and Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo, the weakest link
was not any performer on the
Stanford team, but rather the
scores handed down by the judges.
Undeservedly low marks resulted
in only a second place finish as
the Cardinal fell to Washington
185.25 to 186.15, though Stanford
beat UC Santa Barbara's 177.40
and San Luis Obispo's 178.40.
The Cardinal could not be upset

with its performance, however, as
the team turned in top-level
routines on each event. Vaulting
included two handspring fronts as
freshman Adriana Duffy made her
mark with a 9.35 and senior Sheri
Evenson started the meet strong
with a 9.50.
On bars, freshman Denise Vil
lars made her difficult routine
look easy and effortless as she
swung to a 9.55, and Evenson kept
her momentum going with a clean
9.35 routine.
Beam gave senior Laurence
George the opportunity to per
form a beautifully danced 9.45
routine and Villars stunned the
audience with a flip-flop, flip-flop,
lay-out, resulting in a 9.20.
Behind Washington by .7, the
Cardinal hoped to make up the
difference on floor exercise. Even
son's energetic routine earned her
a 9.40 and freshmen Shira
Wohlberg and Nicki Kobrine both
put in solid 9.20 performances,
but the team came up short by .9.

Bright spots included Evenson's
all-around score of 37.45, tying
her personal record and earning
her second-place all-around
honors. At Saturday's meet down
at UCLA, Evenson once again
brought in this score. Unfortu
nately, the rest of the Cardinal
did not fare as well as they man
aged to produce only a 183.65
team score because of a rash of
falls on the beam.
The tragedy in the loss on Fri
day was that most of the .9 could
be attributed to judging that was
less than equitable, according to
Sardina.
"The difference shows up when
the judges are deciding between
giving a 9.20 and a 9.40," Sardina
said. "Our judges don't give us
the benefit of the doubt, so we
get a 9.20." As a result, Sardina
plans to approach the judges with
the problem in hopes of affecting
a change.

They're back!
After a period of hibernation,
during which they barely man
aged to defeat mediocre oppo
nents, the Stanford men gym
nasts woke up and, relieved of
most of their early season inju
ries, scored 277.80 points to re
establish the Cardinal among
the nation's best teams.
Saturday afternoon at Maples
Pavilion, Stanford defeated UC-
Santa Barbara by over nine
points, improving its record to
6-2 and avenging a loss to these
same Gauchos three weeks ago.
The impressive team scoring
total came despite the absence
of co-captain Adam Forman who
recently suffered a minor shoul
der injury.
It was a performance of which
the Cardinal knew it was capable
eventually, but was not expecting
at this point in the season with
Forman out and freshman Tim
Ryan recovering from a pulled
forearm muscle.

"I wasn't expecting this kind
of a good performance," Stan
ford Coach Sadao Hamada said.
"The guys really hit the good
routines. ... Definitely, it's one
of the top three scores in the
country (at this time)."
Junior Conrad Voorsanger led
the way individually, winning
the meet's all-around competi
tion with 56.45 points. His
scores of 9.75 on the parallel
bars and 9.70 on the pommel
horse were the meet's highest.
However, it was not individual
prominence but across-the-board
consistency which led to such a
high score. The floor exercise
and parallel bars events were ex
emplary, with no Cardinal com
petitors scoring below 9.20.
"On the events where we had
really good scores, we had a
number of good routines leading
up to the final high score," Ryan
said. "That's part of the strategy

kind of an order."
Conversely, the Gauchos placed
their top two individuals, David
Stow and Mark Brodman, oecond
and third in the all-around stand
ings but were unable to keep up
with Stanford because of a weak
supporting cast.
Cardinal gymnasts Charles
Loop, Scott Schaffer and Andy
Ropp each surpassed the 54-point
mark individually while Tim
Wang was just half a tenth below
it. Ryan competed in five of the
six events, totaling 47.40 points
for an average of 9.45 per event.
