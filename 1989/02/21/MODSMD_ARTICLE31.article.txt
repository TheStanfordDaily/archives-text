# Spikers squeak by rejuvinated Northridge
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
If only both teams could have
won the match. ...
On paper at least, Stanford's
match Saturday night with Cal
State-Northridge should have
been a blowout. The Cardinal (9-3,
6-1), ranked fourth in the nation
and tied for first in the Western
Intercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion, had completely manhandled
the last-place Matadors (3-6, 0-6)
in Northridge last Friday in an
offensive extravaganza where no
Stanford starter hit below .500.

Cardinal 3, Matadors 2

At Maples Pavilion, however,
the circumstances were greatly al
tered. Fueled by outside hitter
Bob Samuelson's 39-kill perform
ance, Northridge came within two
points of an upset before falling
to Stanford 5-15, 15-6, 15-17, 15-
13, 15-13.
Rather than a blowout, the Car
dinal got one of its tightest

matches of the season and its
closest brush with defeat since the
loss to Hawaii at the start of the
teams' doubleheader at Maples at
the end of January. On the other
side of the net, Northridge re
ceived yet another frustrating
defeat in a match that might have
turned the troubled team around.
"It's killing us losing,"
Northridge Coach John Price
confessed. "I don't know how
much more we can take of this.
Down in Santa Barbara being up
two games and lose, up here being
up 13-9 in the fifth game and
lose, it's really killing us."
Despite the troubles of late, the
Matadors played with the alacrity
and enthusiasm of a winning
team. Rather than fearing the
squad that had trounced them the
week before, the Northridge
players entered the match ready
to win.
The result was a first-game
blowout — by Northridge. With
Samuelson back in the lineup (he
missed the last match against
Stanford), the Matadors were a
completely different team, record
ing an astounding seven team
blocks against a Cardinal squad

that was unaffected by North
ridge's net play last week.
"He gives us a leader on the
court," Price explained of Samuel
son's contributions. "Without
him, we don't have a leader, some
one we can go to. [Stanford] has
(Scott) Fortune and (Dan) Hanan,
two guys that when it's crunch
time you can go to them, and the
other team knows that you're
going to them and you can still
be successful.
"I think to be competitive in
this league, you have to have a
dominant player. Without Bob, we
don't; we just have a bunch of
role players after Bob."
Though his presence wasn't felt
on the floor during the second
game, when Stanford turned the
tables to win 15-6, his impact
resounded throughout the final
three game 9. Standing toe-to-toe
with Olympian Scott Fortune and
All-American Dan Hanan, the
former junior college Player of the
Year kept shelling the Cardinal
until his final spike attempt at
match point went long, a rare hit
ting error that cost his team the

Scott Fortune led the Cardinal splkers on Saturday night over Cal State-Northrldge with hit 33 kills.
Seemingly putting all his
strength into every hit, Samuel
son abused the hardwood repeat
edly. Just when it seemed his team
was out of the match, the senior
would find a new angle to keep
the Matadors alive.
"He did a job on us," Hanan
said. "Our blocking wasn't really
good against him — he was hitting
a lot of holes and we didn't really
dig him very well, either."
Northridge found similar diffi
culties with Hanan and Fortune.
Logging 32 and 33 kills respec
tively, the duo ultimately pulled
the inexplicably flat Cardinal out
of imminent defeat.
After taking a 6-2 lead at the
start of the fifth game, the Car
dinal let down and allowed the
Matadors to score five un
answered points to take the lead.

As in the two previous games,
Stanford responded with a streak
of its own, but a Northridge spurt
placed the home team in a
precarious 9-13 situation, two
points away from elimination.
Fortune and Hanan responded
admirably. Combining for a block
to break Stanford's scoreless spell,
Hanan logged four kills and For
tune tallied two plus a block assist
to pull the Cardinal over the top.
As the team will readily confess,
the win was bittersweet at best.
Rather than recording an easy
win, Stanford was forced into a
dogfight that made Samuelson
look like the Ail-American he may
become if his excellent play con
tinues.
"I think we haven't learned yet
that every match in WIVA is going
to be a very tough match," Hanan
said. "We have to plan on every
match being like a Hawaii or a
UCLA.

have to come out 100 percent all

and tied for first in the Western
Intercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion, had completely manhandled
the last-place Matadors (3-6, 0-6)
in Northridge last Friday in an
offensive extravaganza where no
Stanford starter hit below .500.

At Maples Pavilion, however,
the circumstances were greatly al
tered. Fueled by outside hitter
Bob Samuelson's 39-kill perform
ance, Northridge came within two
points of an upset before falling
to Stanford 5-15, 15-6, 15-17, 15-
13, 15-13.
Rather than a blowout, the Car
dinal got one of its tightest

matches of the season and its
closest brush with defeat since the
loss to Hawaii at the start of the
teams' doubleheader at Maples at
the end of January. On the other
side of the net, Northridge re
ceived yet another frustrating
defeat in a match that might have
turned the troubled team around.
"It's killing us losing,"
Northridge Coach John Price
confessed. "I don't know how
much more we can take of this.
Down in Santa Barbara being up
two games and lose, up here being
up 13-9 in the fifth game and
lose, it's really killing us."
Despite the troubles of late, the
Matadors played with the alacrity
and enthusiasm of a winning
team. Rather than fearing the
squad that had trounced them the
week before, the Northridge
players entered the match ready
to win.
The result was a first-game
blowout — by Northridge. With
Samuelson back in the lineup (he
missed the last match against
Stanford), the Matadors were a
completely different team, record
ing an astounding seven team
blocks against a Cardinal squad

that was unaffected by North
ridge's net play last week.
"He gives us a leader on the
court," Price explained of Samuel
son's contributions. "Without
him, we don't have a leader, some
one we can go to. [Stanford] has
(Scott) Fortune and (Dan) Hanan,
two guys that when it's crunch
time you can go to them, and the
other team knows that you're
going to them and you can still
be successful.
"I think to be competitive in
this league, you have to have a
dominant player. Without Bob, we
don't; we just have a bunch of
role players after Bob."
Though his presence wasn't felt
on the floor during the second
game, when Stanford turned the
tables to win 15-6, his impact
resounded throughout the final
three game 9. Standing toe-to-toe
with Olympian Scott Fortune and
All-American Dan Hanan, the
former junior college Player of the
Year kept shelling the Cardinal

match point went long, a rare hit

Scott Fortune led the Cardinal splkers on Saturday night over Cal State-Northrldge with hit 33 kills.
Seemingly putting all his
strength into every hit, Samuel
son abused the hardwood repeat
edly. Just when it seemed his team
was out of the match, the senior
would find a new angle to keep
the Matadors alive.
"He did a job on us," Hanan
said. "Our blocking wasn't really
good against him — he was hitting
a lot of holes and we didn't really
dig him very well, either."
Northridge found similar diffi
culties with Hanan and Fortune.
Logging 32 and 33 kills respec
tively, the duo ultimately pulled
the inexplicably flat Cardinal out
of imminent defeat.
After taking a 6-2 lead at the
start of the fifth game, the Car
dinal let down and allowed the
Matadors to score five un
answered points to take the lead.

As in the two previous games,
Stanford responded with a streak
of its own, but a Northridge spurt
placed the home team in a
precarious 9-13 situation, two
points away from elimination.
Fortune and Hanan responded
admirably. Combining for a block
to break Stanford's scoreless spell,
Hanan logged four kills and For
tune tallied two plus a block assist
to pull the Cardinal over the top.
As the team will readily confess,
the win was bittersweet at best.
Rather than recording an easy
win, Stanford was forced into a
dogfight that made Samuelson
look like the Ail-American he may
become if his excellent play con
tinues.
"I think we haven't learned yet
that every match in WIVA is going
to be a very tough match," Hanan
said. "We have to plan on every
match being like a Hawaii or a
UCLA.
"The bottom line is that we
have to come out 100 percent all
If only both teams could have
won the match. ...
On paper at least, Stanford's
match Saturday night with Cal
State-Northridge should have
been a blowout. The Cardinal (9-3,
6-1), ranked fourth in the nation
and tied for first in the Western
Intercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion, had completely manhandled
the last-place Matadors (3-6, 0-6)
in Northridge last Friday in an
