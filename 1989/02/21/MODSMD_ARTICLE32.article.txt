# Cagers slide past Golden Bears Azzi's 14 points in eight minutes secure Stanford's 14th straight

### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY — The Stanford wom
en's basketball team tried to take the
California game Pass/No Credit and
came within eight points of a failing
grade. Plagued by spells of lackluster
play and an unrelenting Golden Bear
perimeter attack, the No. 4 Cardinal
escaped from Harmon Arena with an
87-79 victory that just as readily might
have been a home-team upset.

Stanford did claim the win, however,
upping its tally to 20-2 overall and a
commanding 12-0 in Pacific 10 Confer
ence play. Apart from cementing the
Cardinal's apparently unreleasable hold
on first place in the Pac-10, the victory
marked the team's 14th consecutive
win, tying the school record set last year.
Without the offensive firepower of
guard Jennifer Azzi and forwards
Trisha Stevens and Katy Steding, Stan
ford would not have earned these dis

throughout the contest, the cagers failed
to assert control until the final moments
of each half.

Golden Bears at Maples Pavilion on Jan.

pulled out to a 33-29 lead with 4:30 to
go in the first half.
Faced with a below-median perform
ance, the Stanford squad finally awoke.
Asserting the dominance inside that the
Cardinal should have flaunted all along
in light of the four injured California
forwards (including leading scorers and
rebounders Teresa Palmisano and
Trisha Stafford), Stanford outscored the
Bears 16-4 in the waning moments to
claim a 45-35 halftime advantage.
"We really didn't want to get in and
play a physical game," California Coach
Gooch Foster said. "We really wanted
to try and stay away from it, but that
is their game. It's hard because they
are physical, they are strong and that
is their game."
Especially devastating to the homes
tanding Bears was Steding, who am
massed an impressive 15 points in the
first period. Penetrating and taking
more inside shots than she normally
does, the junior caught California
slightly off guard — expecting a potent
perimeter player, the Bears found them
selves faced with a post.
"The past few games I haven't been
lighting it up outside, so I tried to con
centrate on the inside part and then

maybe move outside as time wore on,"
Steding explained. "I didn't get the op
portunity, but that's okay."
As time wore on, however, Stevens
and Azzi contributed most to Stanford's
scoring. Dependable all game long,
Stevens exploded in the second half with
unstoppable shooting to net a team
high-tying 19 points (along with
Steding) on 9-for-16 shooting.
But the real surprise came from Azzi.
Scoreless in the first half, the junior
guard came on strong at the end to
garner 14 points in the final eight
minutes of the game. Just as Todd
Lichti has pulled the Cardinal men out
of several holes this season, Azzi con
fidently cemented Stanford's victory.
"I think the big thing is to not let
anything get you down and having
enough confidence that things are going
to go your way," Azzi reflected. "Todd,
he wants to win, and I want to win,
and that carries you.
"When you think about your own
play, that's when you get really frus
trated. When you think, 'Oh, I missed
a shot, my percentage is going to go
down,' that's when you get in trouble.
When you think, 'I need to do what it
takes to win,' you'll play that way."
Card notes
Of the 1,456 spectators in attendance, at
least half had to be Stanford supporters.
Sitting en masse behind the Stanford bench
and adjacent to the jocular Stanford Band,
the Cardinal contingent turned Harmon into
a neutral court.
"When we came out at warm-ups, it was
almost like being at home because there
were so may people cheering and the band
was here," Azzi noted.
The cheer of the game came from an
animated trombone player, who upon the
referees' awarding of a dubious foul that
sent a Bear to the line chanted, "The ref
bet the spread! The ref bet the spread!" Use
it freely, use it often.

play a physical game," California Coach
Gooch Foster said. "We really wanted
to try and stay away from it, but that
is their game. It's hard because they
are physical, they are strong and that
is their game."
Especially devastating to the homes
tanding Bears was Steding, who am
massed an impressive 15 points in the
first period. Penetrating and taking
more inside shots than she normally
does, the junior caught California
slightly off guard — expecting a potent
perimeter player, the Bears found them
selves faced with a post.
"The past few games I haven't been
lighting it up outside, so I tried to con
centrate on the inside part and then

maybe move outside as time wore on,"
Steding explained. "I didn't get the op
portunity, but that's okay."
As time wore on, however, Stevens
and Azzi contributed most to Stanford's
scoring. Dependable all game long,
Stevens exploded in the second half with
unstoppable shooting to net a team
high-tying 19 points (along with
Steding) on 9-for-16 shooting.
But the real surprise came from Azzi.
Scoreless in the first half, the junior
guard came on strong at the end to
garner 14 points in the final eight
minutes of the game. Just as Todd
Lichti has pulled the Cardinal men out
of several holes this season, Azzi con
fidently cemented Stanford's victory.
"I think the big thing is to not let
anything get you down and having
enough confidence that things are going
to go your way," Azzi reflected. "Todd,
he wants to win, and I want to win,
and that carries you.
"When you think about your own
play, that's when you get really frus
trated. When you think, 'Oh, I missed
a shot, my percentage is going to go
down,' that's when you get in trouble.
When you think, 'I need to do what it
takes to win,' you'll play that way."
Card notes
Of the 1,456 spectators in attendance, at
least half had to be Stanford supporters.
Sitting en masse behind the Stanford bench
and adjacent to the jocular Stanford Band,
the Cardinal contingent turned Harmon into
a neutral court.
"When we came out at warm-ups, it was
almost like being at home because there
were so may people cheering and the band
was here," Azzi noted.
The cheer of the game came from an
animated trombone player, who upon the
referees' awarding of a dubious foul that
sent a Bear to the line chanted, "The ref
bet the spread! The ref bet the spread!" Use
it freely, use it often.

California game Pass/No Credit and
