If this becomes a habit, it could
be dangerous.
For the second weekend in a
row, the Stanford baseball team
lost two games in a three-game
weekend series, this time to UC-
Santa Barbara. And it took a Her
culean effort for the Cardinal to
pull out the final game in a five
hour, 12-inning comeback effort.

Cardinal loses two of
three to Gauchos

"We're still not playing very
smart baseball, but we battled
back today and I give the guys
credit," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said after the final
.game Sunday
The Cardinal dropped the first
two games 13-5 and 5-3, and won
the final 8-5. Stanford's record is
now 8-7, the Gauchos are 5-6.
With the Gauchos leading 5-4
in the top of the ninth Sunday,
Paul Carey led off the inning with
a single. Then Brian Johnson, who
had a two-run homer earlier in
the day, singled.
Jack Hollis then singled up the
middle to score Carey. The Car
dinal failed to push any more runs
across in the inning, however, and
the game went into extra innings.
The Gauchos threatened in the
bottom of the 11th, with Steve
Chitren still on the mound for
the Cardinal. Chitren had relieved
Scott Weiss with one out in the
fifth inning and had already
amassed a career-high 10 strike
outs. But Marquess sensed that
his relief ace was tired, and with
one runner on and one out, fresh
man Aaron Dorlarque entered the
game.
Dorlarque, whose previous out
ings had been spotty at best, got
two of the biggest outs of his
career, including an inning-ending
strikeout of Peter Martin to keep

the Cardinal alive.
As darkness approached at the
top of the 12th, David McCarty
and Troy Tallman both walked
for the Cardinal, and Frank Carey
singled home McCarty for what
would prove to be the game's win
ning run.
Troy Paulsen then doubled to
score Tallman and Carey. As
UCSB tried to delay the game in
order to get a tie, Paul Carey
intentionally struck out to end the
inning. Moments later, Dorlarque
collected his second strikeout for
the final out of the game.
Saturday's game was a heart
breaker for Stanford starter Mike
Mussina. He pitched his first com
plete game of the season, allowing
three earned runs on seven hits.
But spotty play by Stanford in
fielders resulted in two unearned
runs for the Gauchos, which
turned out to be the winning mar
gin in a 5-3 Cardinal loss.
In the fourth inning, Paulsen
booted a double-play ball and then
threw it into right field to put
runners at first and third. Ed
Landphere then hit a double to
score one run while Wes Tac
hibana tied the game at three with

a sacrifice fly.
The Cardinal also had trouble
with its offense on Saturday, col
lecting 10 hits, but all of them
singles. "We didn't have much of
fense. Mussina pitched a pretty
good game. We've just got to put
it all together," Marquess
summed up.
In the first game of the series
on Friday, sophomore Stan Spen
cer had his first bad pitching out
ing of the season, pitching three
innings and giving up five earned
runs. Spencer's bad karma carried
over to the rest of the staff, which
issued a season-high eight walks
and four hit batters.
Things got so bad for the Stan
ford pitching corps that infielder
Jeff Light made his first appear
ance of the season, coming in to
pitch the bottom of the eighth,
allowing no hits and striking out
one.
Stanford jumped out to an early
3-0 lead in the first when Frank
Carey led off with a double and
moved to third when Roger Bur
nett singled. Paulsen walked to
load the bases and Tim Griffin's

Brian Johnson went 6-for-11 at the plate this weekend. Despite Johnson's efforts, the Card nine
dropped two of three to UC-Santa Barbara.
