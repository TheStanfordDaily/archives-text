State Donnle Rea (3-0, 2.34).
WHO S HOT — Brian Johnson had a good weekend against UC-Santa
Barbara, going 6-for-11 including a 2-run homer on Sunday. Steve
Solomon also turned some heads after slumping early in the season
He was 5-for-15 and hit the ball hard in every at bat.
WHO'S NOT — Troy Paulsen is in a hitting and a fielding slump after
fine performances against Fullerton State, Cal State-Los Angeles and
Fresno State Against Santa Barbara, however. Paulsen committed four
errors and went 2-for-14
SPARTAN UPDATE — Rea has won all three of his starts and has a fine
5-to-1 ratio of strikeouts to walks Left fielder Eric Booker hurt the Cardinal
in their last meeting and is currently batting 381 and leads the team
with two home runs.
KEYS TO VICTORY — Stanford Coach Mark Marquess has been frustrated
that the Cardinal has not put together its pitching and hitting in the same
game yet this season. Keyser had a rough outing in Santa Barbara,
giving up three earned runs in 1 1 /i innings But if he can place his curve
ball, it's virtually unhittable
