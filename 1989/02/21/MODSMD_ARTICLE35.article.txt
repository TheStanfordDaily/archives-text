# Blackman, O'Brien meet in NorCal final
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
For the second consecutive
year, the Northern California In
tercollegiate Tennis Champion
ships singles final will be an all-
Stanford affair.
Sophomore Martin Blackman
and freshman Alex O'Brien will
face off today to determine who
will get the honor of keeping the
title, won last year by Stanford's
Jeff Tarango over teammate
Patrick McEnroe, on the Farm.
A Cardinal final was assured
after the quarterfinal round Sun
day, when four of the five remain
ing Stanford players advanced to
the semis. If senior Barry Ric
hards had not lost to California's
Matt Lucena 6-2, 6-1 in the third
round, the entire Stanford singles
slate would have made it to the
quarters.
"It was a good week," Stanford
Asst. Coach John Whitlinger said.
"We had some good wins. The
guys are really hitting the ball
well."
Blackman, who entered the
tournament as the No. 3 seed,
was actually the highest-seeded
player to compete. Both Stan

ford's Jeff Tarango and Cal's
Woody Hunt, who were the top
two seeds, pulled out of the singles
draw because of injuries. Black
man's road to the finals included
a 7-6, 1-6, 6-2 win over teammate
Curtis Dunn in the quarters and
a 6-3, 7-6 win over Glenn Solomon
yesterday.
O'Brien feels his 6-1, 6-4 semi
final win over Jeff Cathrall may
be a sign that he is coming
around. "Finally, I played a good
match," O'Brien said. "I've been
getting my confidence up in this
tournament. I like the way Jeff
plays. ... I like playing guys like
him."
"Alex had to play really well to
beat Jeff, who's just been spectac
ular," Whitlinger said.
