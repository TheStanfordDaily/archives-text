# Several profs, urge University to invite Rushdie to speak here
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
Twelve Stanford professors are urging
the University's Office of Public Affairs
to invite the author of the controversial
novel "The Satanic Verses" to campus
as a speaker and official guest.
The novel, written by British author
Salman Rushdie, prompted the Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's spiritual
leader, to declare last week that Rushdie
must be killed and sent "to hell."

Those Muslims who have taken offense
believe Rushdie's novel blasphemes Is
lam. For example, the novel portrays the
wives of the Islamic prophet Mohammed
as prostitutes.
In a letter, which appears on the
Opinions page of today's Daily, the pro
fessors claim that the death threat issued
by Khomeini is "at its core an attack on
the vocation of creativity and the voice
of imagination."
According to the professors who wrote
the letter, the death threat issued by

Khomeini "constitutes a threat to all in
tellectuals, not just to writers."
The University, "as a community of
the mindful . . . ought to be forceful,
public and uncompromising in response,"
the letter states.
History Prof. Harold Kahn, the author
of the letter, told The Daily that an in
vitation would offer Rushdie "a place to
explain himself."
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, one
signer of the letter, said the invitation
would be chiefly "symbolic." Considering

the nearly $6 million bounty that has
been placed on Rushdie's head by several
Iranian clerics, it is unlikely that Rushdie
would accept Stanford's invitation imme
diately, Rebholz said.
Rebholz added that he hoped domestic
tension in Iran would eventually resolve
itself, allowing Rushdie to accept an in
vitation to speak on campus.
Neither Kahn nor Rebholz have read
"The Satanic Verses." Kahn noted that
he had read other books by Rushdie and
had found them "absolutely marvelous."

In addition to suggesting the Univer
sity bring Rushdie to campus, the pro
fessors propose the following in their let
ter:
• That University President Donald
Kennedy call on presidents at other irauor
universities to issue a "joint, formal in
vitation" to Rushdie to visit their cam
puses and discuss his novel;
• That the Stanford Bookstore and lo
cal Bay Area booksellers "seek to stock
the novel so that we can read it
for ourselves;" and
• That the religious communi
ties at Stanford join in condemn
ing the threat to Rushdie's life.
Kennedy declined to comment
on the proposals of the professors
until having an opportunity to
read the letter himself.
The Bookstore sold out of "The
Satanic Verses" Saturday.
Bookstore officials could not be
reached yesterday for comment on
whether more copies of "The
Satanic Verses" will be ordered.
According to Julie Magnus, the
circulation supervisor at Meyer
Library, both Meyer and Green
Library have ordered copies of
"The Satanic Verses," but the
book has yet to arrive.
