# Drycleaning biz is cleaning up

### Kaye Lothes 
Encouraged by turning a profit for the first time
in its five quarters of operation, the ASSU Dryclean
ing service will officially open a second branch today
in Encina Gym.
The non-profit operation, currently located in the
back of Tresidder Union, averages about 30 orders
a day, according to Cliff Yee, who works at the
ASSU service.
Yee said the new location, right next to the Encina
towel room, will help to widen the market by at
tracting faculty and staff. Yee said faculty and staff
use the gym and many of their offices are nearby,
so it would be convenient for them to take advantage
of the new facility.
"We'll start a flow to see how it goes," Yee said,
adding that business may be slow at first because
many people will not know about the new branch.
The new branch should be self-sufficient, Yee said,
and will eventually become a "money-maker."
The current pace of 30 orders a day is up from
20 per day last year, when the service would run
a deficit of a couple hundred dollars per quarter.
Yee attributed the service's greater success this
quarter to the wintertime interview season, when
many students are in need of professional laundry
services.
Also, due to campus-wide advertising, more stu
dents have become aware of the benefits of going
to ASSU drycleaning, he added. The service is on
campus and is no more expensive, if not cheaper,
than other locations in Palo Alto.
Furthermore, Yee said the service has a very
impressive turnaround rate: overnight.
However, students continue to feel drycleaning is
a luxury, Yee said. According to ASSU straw poll
results released last week, only 17 percent of stu
dents on campus use the service one to three times
a quarter, and 70 percent never use it at all.
