# Report by Bridge counselors defends the need for live-ins
## 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
Fighting an uphill battle to keep its space
on campus, supporters of the Bridge Peer
Counseling Center have submitted a 50-
page report to University officials justifying
the need for live-in counselors.
The impact of the report remains uncer
tain, however, as Asst. Dean of Student
Affairs Michael Ramsey-Perez in an inter
view last night still questioned the need
for live-in students considering the space
shortage on campus.
"There is no other crisis hotline in the
Bay Area that provides housing," he said.
Repudiating the statement the Bridge

does not ask for much from the University,
Ramsey-Perez said, "Free housing is some
thing â€” even I pay rent."
The Committee on Student Organized
Spaces, chaired by Ramsey-Perez and As
soc. Dean of Student Affairs Michael Jack
son, asked members of the Bridge to submit
a report justifying the existing live-in struc
ture and general use of the Bridge building.
The committee will consider allocating the
space to other public service groups for
their use.
Ramsey-Perez said the committee will
meet again in the next week to discuss the
report's findings.
