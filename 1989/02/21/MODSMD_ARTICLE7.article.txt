# Report by Bridge counselors defends the need for live-ins
## 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
Fighting an uphill battle to keep its space
on campus, supporters of the Bridge Peer
Counseling Center have submitted a 50-
page report to University officials justifying
the need for live-in counselors.
The impact of the report remains uncer
tain, however, as Asst. Dean of Student
Affairs Michael Ramsey-Perez in an inter
view last night still questioned the need
for live-in students considering the space
shortage on campus.
"There is no other crisis hotline in the
Bay Area that provides housing," he said.
Repudiating the statement the Bridge

does not ask for much from the University,
Ramsey-Perez said, "Free housing is some
thing — even I pay rent."
The Committee on Student Organized
Spaces, chaired by Ramsey-Perez and As
soc. Dean of Student Affairs Michael Jack
son, asked members of the Bridge to submit
a report justifying the existing live-in struc
ture and general use of the Bridge building.
The committee will consider allocating the
space to other public service groups for
their use.
Ramsey-Perez said the committee will
meet again in the next week to discuss the
report's findings.
The Bridge, which is entirely
student-run, currently houses five
live-in counselors who serve the
needs of undergraduates, gradu
ates and the community at any
time of day or night. The center
has been providing services at its
current location, 640' Campus Dr.,
for 18 years.
The Bridge is a self-supporting
organization. Each spring it hosts
"The Spring Faire," which raises
about $15,000 for operating ex
penses. Staffers and live-ins work
on a voluntary basis. Bridge coun
selors only ask the University for
a building.
The other main counseling
service on campus, CAPS, a serv
ice of Cowell Student Health Serv
ices, is run by professionals and
only allows drop-ins on an
emergency-type basis.
The report details:
• Why the Bridge is vital to
Stanford's support network;
• Why live-ins are necessary for
the 24-hour counseling service;
• Why alternative methods to
24-hour live-in won't work; and
• Why live-ins are necessary as
Bridge administrators.
The report also includes statis
tics showing that 62 percent of all
calls come in after business hours,

and that almost 50 percent of all
counsels are handled by live-ins.
Enclosed in the report are 11 let
ters of support for the live-ins
from various community mem
bers.
"We've had 18 years of live-ins
and this system really works there
is no alternative," said senior
Stephanie Kondik, a live-in coun
selor. She said that of the eight
suicidal students counseled last
year, seven called in after mid
night.
"We don't have a lot of political
allies, so we're an easy target,"
Melendez said. She added that no
other group, to her knowledge,
evaluated and had been asked to
prepare a written report.
The report took almost an entire
quarter to prepare, she said.
"We could not survive without
live-ins. Our services would be
drastically curtailed," said Chuck
Bryant, co-author of the report
and coordinator of The Spring
Faire.
"I really question any organi
zation that needs that kind of sup
port," said Ramsey-Perez. "I
wonder what the call is on that
kind of space," he said, mention
ing other student groups that had
no type of meeting space what
soever. "No one is well served,
and I question why it is a Stanford
priority."
"It's a big waste" of space
having live-ins, he added.

According to Ramsey-Perez, the
University will not be building
any new facilities for student or
ganizations in the near future.
"We want to establish land
lordship of the existing build
ings," such as LOTS, he said.
The last time the University
constructed any type of student
organizational buildings was al
most 25 years ago when Storke
Student Publications Building
was built.
Ramsey-Perez said he noticed
the hard work that went into pre
paring the report. "It was very
helpful and told us more than I
think we ever imagined," he said.
Melendez said the University
has been fairly cooperative
throughout the ordeal by not
giving the group a set deadline.
But she added it was in the
group's best interest to get out
the report as soon as possible "to
get things rolling."
Melendez did say that before
the group of 10 set out to write
the report, they wrote a letter to
the University asking precisely
what should be answered in the
report, but never received a re
sponse.
She explained that some people
do not feel comfortable going to
CAPS.
Kondik emphasized that peer
counseling programs at other col
leges without live-ins have "fallen
by the wayside."
