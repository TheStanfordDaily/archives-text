# Is perestroika old hat?
## VTSS prof. analyzes technology in the USSR 
### Joseph Williams 
There's nothing new about
perestroika, the Soviet Union's
current effort to rebuild its eco
nomy, a Stanford scholar told res
idents of Slavianskii Dom last
night.
Lois Becker, a lecturer in VTSS,
asserted that the Soviet desire for
Western technology is based on
the philosophies of Vladimir
Lenin and Karl Marx.
Marx felt that technological ad
vances are usually done for social
reasons, Becker said. Hence, that
which is the most scientific is the
most socialist.
The Soviet Union has been at
tempting to catch up with the
West economically since the early
19205. Historically there has been
a sense of "Soviet Americanism,"
or an instinct for technological ad
vance, Becker said. The founder
of the Soviet Institute of Labor,
in fact, envisioned "a new, flower
ing America."

Becker asserted that socialist
ideology can adapt and benefit
from Western technology and con
sumer markets.
The Soviet view of technology
is "a giant conveyor belt" where
each worker partakes of the tech
nology and contributes to the
giant machine of the Soviet Un
ion, according to Becker. For
Lenin, that meant that people
would become highly advanced
machines, she said.
Becker went on to say that the
new emphasis on technology has
definite historical references. Fig
ures such as Marx and Lenin envi
sioned highly technological
socialist societies.
With the emergence of a busi
ness school in Moscow and the
beginnings of MasterCard and
Visa competing for the Soviet
market, it is clear that the his
torical influence of these men is
taking place in the modern Soviet
economy, Becker said.
