## North trial finally begins Defense, prosecution open fight that may take months 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Oliver
North's criminal trial opened yesterday
with the prosecutor portraying him as
a liar who "places himself above the
law" but with North's lawyer defending
him as a patriotic Marine who obeyed
unflinchingly the orders of his com
mander in chief.
North, now retired from the service,
listened intently as prosecutor John
Keker told the jury the defendant had
lied time and again to his president and
to Congress about the Iran-Contra af
fair.
Chief defense lawyer Brendan Sul
livan countered that North, a former
top National Security Council aide,
worked in a secret world where "he
always acted with the approval of his
superiors; he acted always with the best
interests of his country."
Thus the two sides squared off for

Thus the two sides squared off for
the oft-delayed first trial to come out
of the Iran-Contra affair, a trial that
may take as much as five months to
complete.
The first testimony comes this morn
ing when Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind.,
the former chairman of House Intelli
gence Committee, takes the stand.

Keker told the jury
yesterday that North
had profited personally
by using traveler's
checks furnished by a
Contra leader and, on a
broader scale, had told
lies that amounted to
"a crime that goes to
the soul of our self
government."

"You will hear he considers himself
a patriotic person, but there is no higher

patriotic purpose than to protect 'our
system of government," Keker said. "To
lie to Congress because you mistrust it
then is a crime and not a defense."
Sullivan did portray North as a pa
triot, saying he believed in the Marine
motto "Semper Fidelis" â€” always faith
ful.
"He lived with that Marine Corps
motto. He was always faithful to coun
try, to commander in chief, to his family,
to those whose lives depended on him,"
said Sullivan.
And yet, said the defense attorney:
"Lt. Col. Oliver North has in the end
been abandoned by his government."
North's eyes moistened as Sullivan
wound up his opening statement almost
in a whisper.
The courtroom was filled to its 120-
seat capacity, with reporters taking 60.
The public got only 15 .
