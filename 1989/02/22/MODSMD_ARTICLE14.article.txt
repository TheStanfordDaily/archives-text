# El Salvador rebels offer conditional ceasefire in talks

OAXTEPEC, Mexico (AP) - El Sal
vador's leftist rebels offered yesterday to
lay down their weapons if the armed
forces are sharply cut, the police force
reorganized and next month's presiden
tial elections postponed by at least four
months.
The Farabundo Marti National Liber
ation Front presented its revised proposal
on the second day of talks with delegates
from 13 political parties seeking ways to
end El Salvador's nine-year civil war.
The front's offer attempted to address
a mgyor stumbling block in the talks —

the constitutional requirement that Pres
ident Jose Napoleon Duarte leave office
by June 1 — by proposing an interim
president.
The proposal appeared to be aimed at
neutralizing El Salvador's rightist
dominated military, which has warned
publicly it might seize power in a coup
if Duarte does not step down as sched
uled.
The revised proposal came as guerrillas
in El Salvador attacked the country's
principal army base and an engineering
detachment, leaving eight dead and 17

injured. The war has taken 70,000 lives,
most of them civilian.
Reports from San Salvador said the
rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance,
Arena, was standing firm against
postponing the March 19 vote, which it
is favored to win, but deputy chairman
Jose Francisco Merino Lopez said the
party would not tip its hand.
The Arena and guerrilla representa
tives met for talks yesterday morning
but both groups refused to disclose
details.
At an afternoon news conference, one

Arena delegate, Jose Francisco Guerrero,
called the guerrilla attitude "sincere" but
would not say whether the party favored
or rejected postponement of the election.
"Peace is very distant but the distance
is not so great," said Guerrero. "With
the cooperation of the FMLN and ours
we can achieve peace in the short term."
Guillermo Ungo, presidential candidate
of the Democratic Convergence, told
reporters here the new guerrilla proposal
was "a very important change that would
give us a better chance for peace."
But Ungo said he did not see any pos

sibility of achieving concrete results. The
rebels themselves appeared pessimistic
about the prospects of their offer.
"For reactionaries such as Arena it
would seem that the meeting with the
FMLN is more an opportunity for
dilatory maneuvers than the mature re
sponse that the people demand for a vi
able means of pointing the country
toward peace," they said in a broadcast
yesterday on the clandestine Radio Ven
ceremos.
The FMLN broadened the scope of the
talks here with its call for a cease-fire.
