# Germany, U.K. plan summit

FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) - The
leaders of West Germany and Britain yesterday
unexpectedly scheduled an April summit meeting
after two days of face-to-face talks failed to resolve
differences over nuclear missiles.
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher un
successfully tried to persuade Chancellor Helmut
Kohl to go forward with the replacement of short
range nuclear missiles in West Germany.
At the end of the talks with Kohl in Frankfurt,
Thatcher also confidently predicted that the Euro
pean Economic Community's withdrawal of top
ranking diplomats from Iran will be "very success
ful."
The 12 EEC nations decided on the move after
Iran called for the death of author Salman Rushdie,
author of the novel "The Satanic Verses," which
Moslems believe is blasphemous.
During a post-summit news conference, Kohl and
Thatcher faced a round of questions replacing the
approximately 600 Lance nuclear missiles in West
Germany.
"Constancy is a very good factor," Thatcher said,
referring to her government's insistence on replace
ment of the missiles. "Constancy and consistency
in politics are very strong, very rare, alas all too
rare."
