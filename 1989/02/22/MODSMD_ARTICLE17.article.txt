# Gun owners plan to fight ban
## Activists plan to take case to California Supreme Court 
### 
UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP)
— Seven gun owners assisted by
the National Rifle Association
prepared yesterday to ask the Cal
ifornia Supreme Court to rule
that state law pre-empts city bans
on semiautomatic rifles in Stock
ton and Los Angeles.
The two cities enacted or
dinances this month after a gun
man killed five children and
wounded 30 other people at a
Stockton elementary school on
Jan 17.
The gun owners, including two
Stockton residents and two Los
Angeles police officers, prepared
to file suit directly to the state
Supreme Court because the two
cities and other communities that
have enacted similar laws are in
different state appellate districts,
said Richard Gardiner, assistant
general counsel for the NRA.
The case belongs in the high
court because it is of significant
statewide importance, Gardiner
said.
Four of the plaintiffs told a

news conference at a Universal
City hotel that the city ordinances
take away rights and instill fear
that the bans will lead to action
against other types of firearms.
Gardiner and the gun owners
said that rather than controlling
guns, the justice system should
deal more strongly with criminals
such as the Stockton gunman,
Patrick Purdy, who killed himself
after the schoolyard massacre.
"I'm paying the price that un
fortunately the man who commit
ted the crime in Stockton is not
alive to pay," said Bill Hilburn, a
Department of Energy engineer
who lives two miles from the
Stockton school. "Nobody is more
outraged about what happened in
my hometown."
Tony Acevedo, 35, complained
that the Stockton City Council's
action makes him a criminal for
owning such weapons.
Donald Castillo of Los Angeles,
an nerospace electronics engineer,
said he was interested in target
shooting with such guns and he
worries the bans will lead to at

tacks on other civil liberties.
"I'm here because I'm scared
to death," Castillo said.
Andre Coulombe, a financial
consultant in Los Angeles, said
he works with a youth Explorer
group and fears he will no longer
be allowed to engage in such ac
tivities as firearms instruction,
which he says teaches discipline.
Gardiner identified the other
three plaintiffs as Robert Feeley,
a Los Angeles lawyer, and Sgt.
Louis Salsedo and Officer George
Luczy, both Los Angeles police of
ficers.
Los Angeles officials said they
will delay any attempts to enforce
the ban on possessing the weap
ons until March 1. Several other
proposed gun bans are being con
sidered in various committees of
the Legislature.
The NRA counsel asserted that
the city bans are really against
all semiautomatic rifles. He said
the mechanism of the so-called
military style assault rifles are
the same as other types of semi
automatic rifles.
