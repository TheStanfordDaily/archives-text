### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — More than 100 Jewish
youths, shouting "Free the Pollards now!," took
their case yesterday to the rainy steps of the Justice
Department, where they demanded a re-examination
of the sentences and treatment of convicted spy
Jonathan Pollard and his wife.
"We will not be silent," said Jacob Davidson,
president of the North American Jewish Students'
Network, which organized the rally of high school
and college students, most of them from the New
York-New Jersey metropolitan area.
Although Attorney General Dick Thornburgh was
not in town and no one from his office came outside
to meet with the demonstrators, Davidson said, "I
want them to know this issue is not dead."
Pollard, 34, was sentenced in April 1987 to life
in prison after he was convicted of supplying clas
sified U.S. documents to Israeli agents. His wife,
Anne Henderson-Pollard, 28, was given a five-year
sentence as an accessory to her husband's illegal
possession of the documents.
"Nothing he turned over to Israel damaged Amer
ican society in any way," said Davidson, comparing
Pollard's situation with that of John Walker, who
provided countless U.S. Navy secrets to the Soviet
Union.
