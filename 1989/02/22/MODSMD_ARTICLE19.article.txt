Court charges Mandela guards
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) - Two
men arrested at the home of black activist Winnie
Mandela appeared in court yesterday on charges
of murder, abduction and assault.
Jerry Richardson and Jabu Sithole were not
asked to enter pleas at their arraignment in
Soweto Magistrates Court. Their case was
postponed for a week.
It is part of a growing scandal surrounding
the wife of jailed African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela, and a group of unofficial
bodyguards who lived at her home in Soweto,
the huge township outside Johannesburg.
Sithole was a member and Richardson described
himself as coach of the bodyguards, who called
themselves the Mandela United soccer club.
Anti-government leaders last week accused
Mandela United of waging a "reign of terror."
They renounced Mandela, and urged their fol
lowers not to associate with her.
Paraguay vows end to drug trade
WASHINGTON (AP) — The new leader of
Paraguay has promised to help fight drug traf
ficking and cooperate in hunting Nazi war
criminals who may be hiding in the South Amer
ican nation, the first congressman to visit

Paraguay since the coup said yesterday.
Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., said Gen.
Andres Rodriguez told him during an hour-long
meeting last week that Rodriguez "wants to
change the reputation of Paraguay as a refuge
for thieves and scoundrels to a very different,
more positive place."
"In our conversation, the provisional president
was very specific. He even assured me that he
is willing to receive requests from those who
hunt war criminals, because he wants to end
Paraguay's historic reputation as a haven for
ex-Nazis, drug dealers and Third World dic
tators," Morrison said.
Hush blasts Tower allegations
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush yester
day denounced as "vicious rumor" allegations
against Defense Secretary-designate John Tower
and declared they had been "gunned down" by
a thorough FBI report. A Senate committee vote
on the embattled nominee was tentatively sched
uled for tomorrow.
Urging the Senate to move "forthrightly" on
the nomination, Bush said at a news conference
that he had personally reviewed portions of the
FBI report into Tower's alleged drinking, philan
dering and financial improprieties.
"What I got from it was that there has been
a very unfair treatment of this man."
