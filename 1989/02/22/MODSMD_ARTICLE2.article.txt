# Kennedy passes on plea to bring Rushdie here
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
Responding to a plea by 12 professors
that the author of "The Satanic Verses"
be asked to speak on campus, University
President Donald Kennedy said yester
day that he would not issue a formal
invitation to the author of the contro
versial novel.
Kennedy, however, said faculty mem
bers "are free" to invite Salman
Rushdie, the British author who has
been targeted for death by the Ayatollah
Khomeini.
In a letter that appeared in the
Opinions section of yesterday's Daily,
the professors called on Kennedy to
marshall support from the intellectual
community to defend Rushdie's artistic
freedom.
The death threat issued by Khomeini
is "at its core an attack ... on all in
tellectuals," they wrote.
Claiming the University should be
"forceful, public and uncompromising
in response" to Khomeini, the profes
sors requested that the University's
Public Affairs Office invite Rushdie to
come to Stanford as a speaker and of
ficial guest.
In addition, they urged Kennedy "to
call his fellow presidents at mcyor uni
versities to issue a joint, formal invita
tion" to Rushdie, granting him the op
portunity to visit college campuses
across the country.
While Kennedy said he agreed that
the threat on Rushdie's life is an assault
on the intellectual community, he said
he questioned the utility of inviting the
author to campus.
"The question is whether Stanford or
any American university can provide a
helpful remedy," Kennedy said.
He said it was "very doubtful" that
an invitation would help Rushdie's sit
uation.
"There's no reason to believe this
move would be in Rushdie's interests,"
Kennedy added.
Bob Freelen, vice president of Public
Affairs, told The Daily yesterday that

while extending an invitation to Rushdie
posed "no problem in principle," he said
he doubted that Rushdie would be
making any public appearances in the
near future.
The logistics of a campus appearance
by Rushdie "may be a little more dif
ficult than people anticipate," Freelen
said.
Nearly $6 million in bounty has been
placed on Rushdie's head by several
Iranian clerics. He is reportedly in
hiding near London.
Freelen said that he would not even
know where to send an invitation to
Rushdie.
History Prof. Harold Kahn, the au
thor of the letter, told The Daily last
night that he "would be happy to supply
an address" for Freelen. Kahn suggested
sending the invitation to Rushdie's pub
lisher.
"I don't think there's any problem in
making an invitation," Kahn said.
Both Kennedy and Freelen questioned
why the professors had requested that
the Office of Public Affairs extend the
invitation to Rushdie, rather than just
inviting him themselves.
Under University policy, professors
may invite guest speakers to campus at
their discretion.
Kennedy said he would not block such
an invitation if one were to be issued
by members of the faculty.
Kahn said last night that an invita
tion to Rushdie would carry more sym
bolic weight if Kennedy, as a "logical
spokesman" for the community, would
endorse it.
Kahn said he was disappointed that
Kennedy seemed unwilling to take the
actions suggested in the professors' let
ter.
Rushdie apologized Saturday for any
distress the publication of his book
caused to Moslems, after Khomeini in
dicated that an apology could lead to a
pardon.
On Sunday, however, Iran's official
Islamic Republic News Agency quoted

pulling out its entire embassy staff.

near future.
The logistics of a campus appearance
by Rushdie "may be a little more dif
ficult than people anticipate," Freelen
said.
Nearly $6 million in bounty has been
placed on Rushdie's head by several
Iranian clerics. He is reportedly in
hiding near London.
Freelen said that he would not even
know where to send an invitation to
Rushdie.
History Prof. Harold Kahn, the au
thor of the letter, told The Daily last
night that he "would be happy to supply
an address" for Freelen. Kahn suggested
sending the invitation to Rushdie's pub
lisher.
"I don't think there's any problem in
making an invitation," Kahn said.
Both Kennedy and Freelen questioned
why the professors had requested that
the Office of Public Affairs extend the
invitation to Rushdie, rather than just
inviting him themselves.
Under University policy, professors
may invite guest speakers to campus at
their discretion.
Kennedy said he would not block such
an invitation if one were to be issued
by members of the faculty.
Kahn said last night that an invita
tion to Rushdie would carry more sym
bolic weight if Kennedy, as a "logical
spokesman" for the community, would
endorse it.
Kahn said he was disappointed that
Kennedy seemed unwilling to take the
actions suggested in the professors' let
ter.
Rushdie apologized Saturday for any
distress the publication of his book
caused to Moslems, after Khomeini in
dicated that an apology could lead to a
pardon.
On Sunday, however, Iran's official
Islamic Republic News Agency quoted

While Kennedy agreed
that the threat on
Rushdie's life is an as
sault on the intellec
tual community, he
questioned the utility
of inviting the author
to campus.

Khomeini as ruling out any reprieve for
Rushdie and urging Moslems "to send
him to hell" for his writings.
European Common Market govern
ments decided yesterday to withdraw
their top diplomats from Iran to protest
Khomeini's renewed order for Moslems
to kill Rushdie. Britain went further by
pulling out its entire embassy staff.
Iran recalled all its ambassadors from
European Common Market nations yes
terday and Britain expelled an Iranian
envoy as the diplomatic battle grew.
In Washington, President Bush said
he supported the retaliatory moves by
the European countries.
