## Feudal shame 
### 
Stanford should fulfill
its moral duty to the
Webb Ranch workers

PRINCE STANFORD
granted Duke Webb a fief
dom. The land-holding
noble provided meager pay in ex
change for his peasants' labor.
The workers lived on his plot, in
shabby housing. They had fled
another kingdom, couldn't speak
the noble's language and thus
had no voice to ask for better
standards. The royalty stayed out
of the Duke's affairs in exchange
for a form of tax and occasional
use of the noble's laborers.
But now the workers want to
unionize. And the national media
have opened the Ivory Tower's
gates and revealed a rather un
savory discrepancy inside.
It makes one wonder: If Webb
Ranch were as visible as the Stan
ford Shopping Center, which is
also on Stanford land, would the
contested working conditions
remain?
The University must uphold
the right of Webb Ranch workers
to unionize, protect them from
potential reprisals from their em
ployer and do all it can to defend
the workers' welfare.
This behooves Stanford partic
ularly because the workers are
regularly used to provide the Uni
versity with cheap labor, un
checked by union restrictions.
Every day workers come to per
form groundswork on campus
and receive about one-third of
what other Stanford workers are
paid for similar jobs.
Members of the Prince's court
say Stanford has no legal respon
sibility for the plight of the

workers, and the Prince's legal
counsel last week stated that
Stanford is not the workers' of
ficial employer.
The University seems to be ig
noring the fact that the laborers'
wages are unconscionably low
and their living and working con
ditions are below acceptable
standards.
The bathroom for both the
male and female workers consists
of three toilets unseparated by
any form of divider. Other alleged
breaches of the workers' rights
include insufficient water outlets,
poor heating and failure to prop
erly post safety and health reg
ulations.
Duke Webb's fief-ranch mana
ger Tom Hubbard himself said
workers receive no health insur
ance, no sick leave, no vacation
pay and no pension benefits.
Surely for workers earning
$4.25 an hour, the $150 monthly
rent plus utilities for minimal
shared living space is excessively
high. Webb is allegedly making
more than $500 per month for
single, poorly-appointed rooms.
Stanford should realize its egal
itarian assertions and should
show concern for the whole com
munity, not just the half that it
so proudly displays to the rest of
the world.
Stanford should advocate
rather than resist the workers'
rights, in order to maintain some
degree of credibility in its claims
of being a morally conscious com
munity.
If the national media blitz tar
geting the unpalatable labor prac
tices allowed under Prince Stan
ford's nose aren't enough to con
vince the Prince that these prac
tices are degrading and morally
unacceptable, then at least let the
public condemnation spur action
to save royal face.
