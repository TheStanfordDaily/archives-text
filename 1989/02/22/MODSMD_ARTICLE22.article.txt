## Drug prohibition stems from history, not medicine 
### 
IN HIS FEB. 15 column, John
Chuang assures us that he "is not
one to obey blindly societal de
mands." Yet his attack on marijuana,
which contains a host of moral judge
ments but a profound lack of substan
tive detail, leaves at least this reader
wondering where else the motivation
for his column could have come from.
Certainly, it's not from an under
standing of the substance. He mentions
some oft-feared effects of the drug —
brain cells, addiction and hallucination
— but fails to explore them in any
depth. If he had, he might have
realized that the "common knowledge"
he's presenting is more a function of
societal demands than any of any real
truths.
Don't get me wrong: any substance
you put in a human body has potential

for harm, and pot is no different. But
the fears Chuang plays off are greatly
exaggerated by today's drug-hyped
society. Marijuana is not a hallucinogen
and is less addictive, and arguably less
destructive, than America's legal drugs:
alcohol, nicotine and caffeine.
Of course, saying a drug is less
dangerous than nicotine isn't saying a
whole lot about its safety But Chuang
chooses to attack pot while ignoring
nicotine and alcohol, even though pot is
probably less dangerous than those two
and certainly less prevalent. Is he sure
that he's not blindly obeying society's
demands?
Why is it then, Chuang asks, that
marijuana is illegal? Surely, there must
be some reason for it. Of course there
is, but the reason has less to do with
science than it does with race.

Almost every race in the history of
the globe has used at least some mind
active substances. In each of these
races there has been an effort to con
trol some, but not all, of these sub
stances.
In 17th century England, cocaine
was legal but possesion of a cup of
coffee was a capital offense. There are
Indian tribes that consider peyote (a
psychedelic) to be a fine asset to living
but that consider alcohol and
marijauna evil. These decisions were
made on criteria other than medical
facts.
In the early stages of U.S. history,
all drugs were legal. But their users
differed: alcohol, tobacco and coffee
were the drugs of choice for most
whites, maryuana a favorite of many
hispanics, psychedelics used mostly by

natives, and cocaine a largely black
drug. Guess which ones became illegal?
The political/racial nature of the
drug laws becomes even more apparent
when you consider alcohol. Since the
addicting and damaging nature of
alcohol could not be overlooked, an
attempt was eventually made at out
lawing it.
If just as many people had been
using marijuana at the time it was
outlawed, and had they been white and
had marijuana produced the same
intense cravings for use, pot would
certainly be legal today.
Marijuana is not the menace it's
made out to be, and those who claim it
is are much more biased by today's
culture than they're willing to admit.
