# Create academic resources for environmentalists
## 
### 
As residents of Phi Psi House, a
co-op, we believe an environmental
theme house would be an excellent
idea, but the proposal being considered
this year is unsatisfactory. Further
more, what this campus needs first is
an environmental academic program.
An organizer of the project told a
house member that Synergy House is
not being considered for the new
theme house because people "aren't
willing to go that far." This is a
travesty. If they won't go so far as to
wash their own dishes, what, then, are
they willing to do?
Environmental theme house residents
must commit to ecologically responsible
lifestyles, not just discussion. Our daily

actions have far-reaching implications
as well as direct impact upon the im
mediate surroundings.
Having read the theme house's state
ment of philosophy, we are afraid that
this project may create the Outdoor
Recreational Theme House for Politi
cally Correct Thinkers.
Ironically, the same year Stanford's
"You Can Make a Difference" confer
ence focused student attention on envi
ronmental issues, the University has
discontinued the Civil Engineering
Resources Planning Program, which
provided students with a focus on ener
gy, land use and hazardous waste man
agement.
Instead of this theme house, create
an Environmental Programs Office on
campus. Such an office could advise
students on all forms of environmental
study and provide a database for re
search internships and service opportu
nities. The office could also coordinate
lecture series, house literary resources
and serve as a convening place for the

various faculty members and students
sharing environmental interests.
