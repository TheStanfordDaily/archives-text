# Webb Ranch visit prompts frustration at University
## 
### 
I went up to Webb Ranch today.
I wish I could describe the emotions
I felt. I wanted to get angry at some
one, but I wasn't sure at whom. I felt
sad that people were forced to live in
these conditions. I felt frustrated at a
sense of powerlessness to do some
thing.
As I looked around at the living
conditions and learned more about the
treatment of these people, I kept think
ing I was on Stanford property.

I cannot express the disappointment
I feel with Stanford. As a resident
assistant, a Stanford employee, I have
worked to promote important ideals
such as respect for others and respon
sibility for one's actions.
Looking around at the small shacks,
I couldn't help but wonder how sin
cerely Stanford is committed to those
ideals. I understand that the people at
Residential Education are removed
from those who manage Stanford land,
but I cannot ignore the fact that the
university which appears on my tuition
bill and my paycheck is the same uni
versity which owns this land.
I hope Stanford will now take re
sponsibility for its actions and
promptly and cooperatively answer the
workers' demands.
Yet I know I will never think of
Stanford the same way again.
