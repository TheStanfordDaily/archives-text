## Sandwich of freedom 
### 
P.S. 13, New York, New York. I
spent a good part of each day there
back then at the age of five. Free
dom of choice usually isn't a great concern
for five year olds, but it was for me.
I vividly remember one thing from P.S.
13 — lunch, specifically, my "lunch of
freedom."
Yes, I can too easily see and smell that
ham sandwich, peculiarly situated on the
tray. It's on two pieces of wheat bread
and it's got mustard (!), mayonnaise (!)
and a pickle (!) on it with a slice of yellow
American cheese on top. Ugh!
I'll bet that most of you are thinking,
"What's wrong with that? It sounds like
a fairly decent sandwich." Perhaps your
stomach is growling from the thought of
it? For me, this sandwich symbolizes ab
solute misery and absurdity, my own
"Clockwork Orange." Let me explain why.
Too often you'll hear complaints at
lunches and dinners about the food that
Stanford is serving us. Speaking from
my experience, these complaints are
usually unjustified. Perhaps, the com
plainer has something troubling on his
or her mind or has nothing to say at the
table and so criticizes what is easy to
criticize — the food.
Actually, the food here is quite good,
especially when you compare it to most
P.S. 13 lunches.
Back then, at the age of five, I knew
that whining was useless. So I gathered
up my will power, stood (sat) firmly and
declared a hunger strike. Every day at
lunch, I would enter the cafeteria and sit
down at the table, refusing the lunch

they served.
The teachers were obviously concerned
about this "malnourished," bratty boy.
More than two weeks passed and my
"hunger-strike" was still in full swing,
and the teachers figured that something
had to be done.
I can see the faceless teachers ap
proaching me. They are hesitant but de
termined to "serve" me lunch. A bit of
disagreement, followed by my refusal.
Then the assertion of their will. The ham
sandwich is forced through my mouth
and into my stomach. Then I'm staring
into the depths of the nearest garbage
can, vomiting, rejecting that ham sand
wich.
The loss of choice is indigestible. Even
now, whenever I smell mustard, pickles
or mayonnaise, I am reniinded of that
"indigestible" lunch and my throat
tightens in disgust. I get sick! I would
not eat yellow American cheese until last
year! All this sickness is associated with
that loss of choice during lunch at P.S.
13. This is absurd.
Last week's Sunday Flick, "A Clock
work Orange," illustrates my point. Alex,
the hoodlum, undergoes a brainwashing
therapy in which crime or the desire for
violence becomes associated with physical
pain. This is done so that he won't choose
crime.
By an unforeseen mistake in the
therapy, he also becomes conditioned
against Beethoven's (that's Ludwig Van)
Ninth Symphony. So whenever Alex
thinks criminal thoughts or hears Bee
thoven's Ninth, he becomes sickened and

nauseated.
The latter part of the movie shows how
Alex has lost his freedom of choice and
is continually tormented, and eventually
he attempts suicide upon hearing Bee
thoven's Ninth. The movie demonstrates
how ridiculous life is without the power
of choice.
I've grown up from a brat of five to
a boy of 18, from P.S. 13 food "service"
to Stanford's "You Choose" Food Service.
The philosophy behind the "You Choose"
program is that your own good choice
requires that you, the chooser, see the"
contents of each option (each entreej.
Seeing is essential for choosing. Last
week's column about drugs was not a
plea for morality, as many readers
thought. Rather, it was an appeal for
choice with vision. Before you choose, see
all you can. Do you choose to live in an
altered state or do you choose real life,
your creative self?
If you ever lose your right to choose,
do something about it. Otherwise you
may find yourself nauseated. And in
times when you do make decisions, re
member the importance of seeing. Other
wise you may find yourself nauseated,
sickened at yourself.
