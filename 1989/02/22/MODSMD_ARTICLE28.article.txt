## IAC animal rights course did cover both sides of the issue 
### 
A Feb. 14 article on Innovative Aca
demic Courses devoted considerable
space to criticism of the SWOPSI
course, "The Case for Animal Rights,"
that Kimberly Sturla, executive direc
tor of the Peninsula Humane Society,
and I taught last quarter at SWOPSI's
request.
Neither Sturla nor I were contacted
by The Daily. Quoted only were Asst.
Biology Prof. Robert Sapolsky, who
claimed that our course "made objec
tive teaching impossible to occur," and
Psychology Prof. Seymour Levine, who
called us "incapable of representing the
animal rights issue in any sense other
than propagandizing."
Here are excerpts from the student
evaluations, of which six called our
teaching "excellent" and the seventh
"good — not enough time." They said:
"One of the best courses I have taken
... A great course — we covered many
different aspects of animal rights, and
both sides of the issues ... Inspired,
well-planned teaching ... Fascinating,
beautifully organized, packed with in
formation on both sides of a controver
sial and very relevant issue .. . Great
speakers — we have been exposed to
both sides of the issue without doubt

.. . Readings excellent, gave us insight
on both sides of the issue ... Readings
provocative, controversial and interest
ing. Discussions first-rate .. . Instruc
tors knew their material well, did not
force their opinions on us ... ex
plained both sides of every issue, gave
room to formulate our own opinion .. .
Sacrificed their time to speakers from
both sides of the issue."
The above from the students who
faithfully attended the entire course.
Sapolsky came exactly once. He in
troduced himself as "Robert — I ob
serve animals in the wild" and omitted
to mention his research work at Stan
ford.
Levine came twice. In the past, he
has conducted mother-infant separation
studies on monkeys and studied the
fear reaction of wild-born monkeys
when a live boa constrictor (enclosed in
a plastic box) was placed on top of
their cage.
He complained to The Daily that we
were not scientists. True; but there is
a sizeable body even of scientific opin
ion that deems the anguish such work
inflicts on animals not justified but its
utility to human welfare and the
money spent on it more profitably

channeled elsewhere. Stanford has re
ceived millions of dollars in federal
funds for his work over the years.
Although it is hardly customary to
have animal rights advocates present in
biomedical teaching that involves the
use of animals, Sturla and I had, as a
matter of course, invited two Stanford
Medical School proponents of animal
use in research, Drs. David Maurice
and Thomas Hamm.
lAC Director Margo Horn addition
ally saw to it that we invited a rodeo
promoter and a spokesperson from the
American Meat Institute, to contest
our assertions that rodeos are a brutal
exercise in domination and that
factory-farmed animals suffer from the
day they are born to the day the die.
The rodeo promoter turned out to be
a most charming man and considerably
more up-front than most of the Stan
ford researchers and their supporters
who flocked to our course — at some
sessions outnumbering the students —
under pretenses that commanded re
spect, for their inventiveness.
Horn's insistence that, in a course
intended to challenge the accepted no
tions, "equal time" must be given to
the beliefs already endemic to our soci

ety, may have been prompted by Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy's
expressed — and conceivably unprece
dented — interest in a course taken by
seven students.
With willing suspension of academic
freedom, Horn strongly put it to us
that "it would be very good" to invite
him. We did and also suggested that
he join us in a campus-wide public
forum on animal use in research. He
declined on scheduling grounds and did
not reply to the suggestion of a forum.
Our course covered far more than
animals in biomedical research. It dealt
with the philosophical basis of animal
rights, the legal status of animals, with
animals used for entertainment, in
zoos, for food and fur, with wildlife
and the environment.
We don't hold that decisions on war
must be left to the generals. We do not
normally take it for granted that ethi
cal or political decisions in areas that
concern us all are best placed in the
hands of those who make a living off
them.
The ethics of human interaction with
nonhuman animals is a societal topic
of great legitimacy that has so far not
found its most satisfactory answers
coming from scientists.

In this "free marketplace of ideas"
that considers racist scribblings to be
protected free speech, the paranoia and
hostility engendered by two women
spending some eight hours talking with
seven students about animals in re
search (during most of which time we
merely acted as facilitators for
spokespersons from both sides) is truly
remarkable and speaks volumes —
significant and disturbing — about the
institution.

funds for his work over the years.
Although it is hardly customary to
have animal rights advocates present in
biomedical teaching that involves the
use of animals, Sturla and I had, as a
matter of course, invited two Stanford
Medical School proponents of animal
use in research, Drs. David Maurice
and Thomas Hamm.
lAC Director Margo Horn addition
ally saw to it that we invited a rodeo
promoter and a spokesperson from the
American Meat Institute, to contest
our assertions that rodeos are a brutal
exercise in domination and that
factory-farmed animals suffer from the
day they are born to the day the die.
The rodeo promoter turned out to be
a most charming man and considerably
more up-front than most of the Stan
ford researchers and their supporters
who flocked to our course — at some
sessions outnumbering the students —
under pretenses that commanded re
spect, for their inventiveness.
Horn's insistence that, in a course
intended to challenge the accepted no
tions, "equal time" must be given to
the beliefs already endemic to our soci

ety, may have been prompted by Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy's
expressed — and conceivably unprece
dented — interest in a course taken by
seven students.
With willing suspension of academic
freedom, Horn strongly put it to us
that "it would be very good" to invite
him. We did and also suggested that
he join us in a campus-wide public
forum on animal use in research. He
declined on scheduling grounds and did
not reply to the suggestion of a forum.
Our course covered far more than
animals in biomedical research. It dealt
with the philosophical basis of animal
rights, the legal status of animals, with
animals used for entertainment, in
zoos, for food and fur, with wildlife
and the environment.
We don't hold that decisions on war
must be left to the generals. We do not
normally take it for granted that ethi
cal or political decisions in areas that
concern us all are best placed in the
hands of those who make a living off
them.
The ethics of human interaction with
nonhuman animals is a societal topic
of great legitimacy that has so far not
found its most satisfactory answers
coming from scientists.

In this "free marketplace of ideas"
that considers racist scribblings to be
protected free speech, the paranoia and
hostility engendered by two women
spending some eight hours talking with
seven students about animals in re
search (during most of which time we
merely acted as facilitators for
spokespersons from both sides) is truly
remarkable and speaks volumes —
significant and disturbing — about the
institution.

A Feb. 14 article on Innovative Aca
demic Courses devoted considerable
space to criticism of the SWOPSI
course, "The Case for Animal Rights,"
that Kimberly Sturla, executive direc
tor of the Peninsula Humane Society,
and I taught last quarter at SWOPSI's
request.
Neither Sturla nor I were contacted
by The Daily. Quoted only were Asst.
Biology Prof. Robert Sapolsky, who
claimed that our course "made objec
tive teaching impossible to occur," and
Psychology Prof. Seymour Levine, who
called us "incapable of representing the
animal rights issue in any sense other
than propagandizing."
Here are excerpts from the student
evaluations, of which six called our
teaching "excellent" and the seventh
"good — not enough time." They said:
"One of the best courses I have taken
... A great course — we covered many
different aspects of animal rights, and
both sides of the issues ... Inspired,
well-planned teaching ... Fascinating,
beautifully organized, packed with in
formation on both sides of a controver
sial and very relevant issue .. . Great
speakers — we have been exposed to
both sides of the issue without doubt

.. . Readings excellent, gave us insight
on both sides of the issue ... Readings
provocative, controversial and interest
ing. Discussions first-rate .. . Instruc
tors knew their material well, did not
force their opinions on us ... ex
plained both sides of every issue, gave
room to formulate our own opinion .. .
Sacrificed their time to speakers from
both sides of the issue."
The above from the students who
faithfully attended the entire course.
Sapolsky came exactly once. He in
troduced himself as "Robert — I ob
serve animals in the wild" and omitted
to mention his research work at Stan
ford.
Levine came twice. In the past, he
has conducted mother-infant separation
studies on monkeys and studied the
fear reaction of wild-born monkeys
when a live boa constrictor (enclosed in
a plastic box) was placed on top of
their cage.
He complained to The Daily that we
were not scientists. True; but there is
a sizeable body even of scientific opin
ion that deems the anguish such work
inflicts on animals not justified but its
utility to human welfare and the
money spent on it more profitably

channeled elsewhere. Stanford has re
ceived millions of dollars in federal
funds for his work over the years.
