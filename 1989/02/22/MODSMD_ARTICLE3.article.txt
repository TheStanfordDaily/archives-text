# Two top execs leave University Hospital

### David Dirks 
The University is gearing up to
fill a void at the Stanford Uni
versity Hospital, following the
recent resignations of its two top
executives.
On May 1, Sheldon King, pres
ident and chief executive officer
at the hospital, will leave to accept
a position at the Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center in Los Angeles.
This announcement closely fol
lows the resignation of Executive
Vice President William Arnold,
who left in December.
"The opening of the new wing
(at the hospital) was a natural
point to decide," said King, who
has been at the hospital since
1981. "The only appropriate time
to leave is while one is happy . . .
and I think that six to 10 years
is an appropriate amount of time
(to be in one location)."

The new wing, part of a $153
million modernization program,
was completed in January.
King's resignation comes dur
ing a time of change for the hospi
tal. No one has been appointed to
serve in the post vacated by Ar
nold, who now heads up the
Parkview Medical Center in Nash
ville, Tenn.
University President Donald
Kennedy, who is leading a 12-
member committee to find King's
successor said the search has just
started.
"No time is easy" for the hospi
tal to change directors, said Ken
nedy. The search committee is ex
pected to announce a successor in
two to three months. King's re
placement will then hire an exec
utive director to take over for Ar
nold.
