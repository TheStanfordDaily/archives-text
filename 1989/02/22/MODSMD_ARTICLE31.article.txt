## 'Sugar frosting' causes cancerous tumor cells to spread 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
In what might lead to a new way to
treat cancer, a Stanford researcher has
determined how cancer cells may spread
through the body.
Dr. Tien-wen Tao Wiedmann, an asso
ciate professor of nuclear medicine,
suspects that sugars on the surface of
cancer cell membranes affect the spread
— or metastasis — of tumor cells from
one part of the body to another.
"When the metastatic growths involve
vital organs such as the lungs, the bones
[and] the brain, it is usually a matter of
time before death results," Wiedmann
said.
"There are no effective treatments,"
Wiedmann said. "Therefore, it is impor
tant to interrupt the metastatic process
and prevent the destructive effects of can
cer.
The sugars exist on the cell's surface
attached to other molecules such as
proteins. Not all tumor cells spread, but
all cells have surface sugars.

Sugars are found on all
cell surfaces, and
these sugars are
thought to be what
cause tumors to
spread.

By finding the proteins specifying the
sugars on non-spreading cancer cells,
Wiedmann said she hopes the proteins
can be used to introduce these sugars to
cells that spread. Thus, non-spreading
cells can be made, thereby controlling the
spread of cancer.
Wiedmann targets the malignant
tumor cells, the ones responsible for most
cancer deaths because they spread
throughout the body.
"Metastasis involves a series of steps,"
Wiedmann said. "Tumor cells destined
to spread must break off from the pri
mary tumor mass, make their way into
a vessel, survive in the vessel, make their
way out of the vessel to seed in different
organs, and then grow there."
Wiedmann said the chances of finding
a way to interrupt metastatis are in
creased by its multi-step nature since the

interruption of any of these steps can
halt the process.
Role of 'sugar frosting'
Wiedmann began her search for the
mechanism of metastasis in the 19705.
She noted that the primary level on which
cells interact is through their cell surface
membranes. On all of these membranes
are found large numbers of sugars at
tached to various cell surface components.
These carbohydrates form long, com
plex structures that branch out like trees.
The carbohydrate trees vary among dif
ferent types of cells.
Only recently have researchers made
any connection between these carbohy
drate trees and their function in cell in
teractions.
"It used to be that they were thought
of as sugar frosting," said Dr. Chris War
ren of the Harvard Medical School. "Now,
we have become excited about what car
bohydrates are doing on proteins."
These carbohydrates seem to deter
mine whether a tumor cell spreads. Wied
mann isolated mutants that had different
surface carbohydrates from mouse cancer
cells. The mutants were derived from
metastasizing cells.
When these mutant tumor cells were
injected into mice, she found the resulting
tumors did not spread as well as the
original cells from which they came. In
one case, the tumors hardly spread.
Thus in the 19705, Wiedmann pre
sented the first strong evidence for the
link between the surface sugars and the
ability for tumor cells to spread. The
exact mechanism by which carbohydrates
influence metastasis has not yet been de
termined. However, work is currently un
der way by Wiedmann and other
researchers to find this mechanism.
Proposals, but no clear evidence
Wiedmann said these sugars are com
ponents of "receptors" on the cell surface.
The receptors interact with proteins and
other chemicals on other cells and
proteins from the space around the cell,
called the extracellular matrix.
These interactions may determine
whether the tumor cell spreads. If the
carbohydrates on the receptors can some
how be changed, then the action of the
receptors may also be changed to control
metastasis.
In one recent study, begun in 1985,
Wiedmann analyzed the receptors that
control the adhesive interactions of cells
with proteins in the fluid around the cell.

These receptors probably play an impor
tant role in the movement of cells during
metastasis.
Wiedmann showed that mouse tumor
cell mutants with different carbohydrate
structure in their receptors displayed a
change in the adhesive interactions of
the cells.
Dr. Daniel Podolsky from the Harvard
Medical School said another hypothesis
is that the carbohydrates may act to
somehow fool the body's immune system,
making it fail to recognize a destructive
foreign growth in an organ.
Neither of these hypotheses have been
conclusively demonstrated. Warren said
the bulk of data on the link between
carbohydrates and cancer metastasis is

"circumstantial at this point."
Controlling cancer's spread
Despite the lack of clear evidence sup
porting a precise mechanism, Wiedmann
said she believes there can still be a way
to interfere with metastasis.
According to Wiedmann, a gene coding
must exist for a specific protein that is
responsible for specifying a certain car
bohydrate structure in the mutant cells
that do not metastasize. If the gene can
be isolated, then the protein that specifies
these carbohydrates can also be found
and be used to control metastasis.
Wiedmann said this protein could pos
sibly be manufactured and administered
for treatment of cancer, or that a similar

drug can be developed to interfere with
the spread of cancer.
Wiedmann is currently trying to isolate
this gene to transfer it into the DNA,
the genetic material, of tumor cells that
metastatize. If they fail to metastatize,
it will be conclusive evidence that carbo
hydrate structure modifies the level of
metastatic activity.
All of this is possible because the tiniest
change in a sugar of a cell surface can
affect the cancer cell's behavior enor
mously.
"A difference in one amino acid or one
sugar can change the biological activity
of a cell in a big way," Wiedmann said.
"That's biology for you."

researchers to find this mechanism.
Proposals, but no clear evidence
Wiedmann said these sugars are com
ponents of "receptors" on the cell surface.
The receptors interact with proteins and
other chemicals on other cells and
proteins from the space around the cell,
called the extracellular matrix.
These interactions may determine
whether the tumor cell spreads. If the
carbohydrates on the receptors can some
how be changed, then the action of the
receptors may also be changed to control
metastasis.
In one recent study, begun in 1985,
Wiedmann analyzed the receptors that
control the adhesive interactions of cells
with proteins in the fluid around the cell.

These receptors probably play an impor
tant role in the movement of cells during
metastasis.
Wiedmann showed that mouse tumor
cell mutants with different carbohydrate
structure in their receptors displayed a
change in the adhesive interactions of
the cells.
Dr. Daniel Podolsky from the Harvard
Medical School said another hypothesis
is that the carbohydrates may act to
somehow fool the body's immune system,
making it fail to recognize a destructive
foreign growth in an organ.
Neither of these hypotheses have been
conclusively demonstrated. Warren said
the bulk of data on the link between
carbohydrates and cancer metastasis is

"circumstantial at this point."
Controlling cancer's spread
Despite the lack of clear evidence sup
porting a precise mechanism, Wiedmann
said she believes there can still be a way
to interfere with metastasis.
According to Wiedmann, a gene coding
must exist for a specific protein that is
responsible for specifying a certain car
bohydrate structure in the mutant cells
that do not metastasize. If the gene can
be isolated, then the protein that specifies
these carbohydrates can also be found
and be used to control metastasis.
Wiedmann said this protein could pos
sibly be manufactured and administered
for treatment of cancer, or that a similar

drug can be developed to interfere with
the spread of cancer.
Wiedmann is currently trying to isolate
this gene to transfer it into the DNA,
the genetic material, of tumor cells that
metastatize. If they fail to metastatize,
it will be conclusive evidence that carbo
hydrate structure modifies the level of
metastatic activity.
All of this is possible because the tiniest
change in a sugar of a cell surface can
affect the cancer cell's behavior enor
mously.
"A difference in one amino acid or one
sugar can change the biological activity
of a cell in a big way," Wiedmann said.
"That's biology for you."
In what might lead to a new way to
treat cancer, a Stanford researcher has
determined how cancer cells may spread
through the body.
Dr. Tien-wen Tao Wiedmann, an asso
ciate professor of nuclear medicine,
suspects that sugars on the surface of
cancer cell membranes affect the spread
— or metastasis — of tumor cells from
one part of the body to another.
"When the metastatic growths involve
vital organs such as the lungs, the bones
[and] the brain, it is usually a matter of
time before death results," Wiedmann
said.
"There are no effective treatments,"
Wiedmann said. "Therefore, it is impor
tant to interrupt the metastatic process
and prevent the destructive effects of can
cer.
The sugars exist on the cell's surface
attached to other molecules such as
proteins. Not all tumor cells spread, but
all cells have surface sugars.

Sugars are found on all
cell surfaces, and
these sugars are
thought to be what
cause tumors to
spread.

By finding the proteins specifying the
sugars on non-spreading cancer cells,
Wiedmann said she hopes the proteins
can be used to introduce these sugars to
cells that spread. Thus, non-spreading
cells can be made, thereby controlling the
spread of cancer.
Wiedmann targets the malignant
tumor cells, the ones responsible for most
cancer deaths because they spread
throughout the body.
"Metastasis involves a series of steps,"
Wiedmann said. "Tumor cells destined
to spread must break off from the pri
mary tumor mass, make their way into
a vessel, survive in the vessel, make their
way out of the vessel to seed in different
organs, and then grow there."
Wiedmann said the chances of finding
a way to interrupt metastatis are in
creased by its multi-step nature since the

interruption of any of these steps can
halt the process.
Role of 'sugar frosting'
Wiedmann began her search for the
mechanism of metastasis in the 19705.
She noted that the primary level on which
cells interact is through their cell surface
membranes. On all of these membranes
are found large numbers of sugars at
tached to various cell surface components.
These carbohydrates form long, com
plex structures that branch out like trees.
The carbohydrate trees vary among dif
ferent types of cells.
Only recently have researchers made
any connection between these carbohy
drate trees and their function in cell in
teractions.
"It used to be that they were thought
of as sugar frosting," said Dr. Chris War
ren of the Harvard Medical School. "Now,
we have become excited about what car
bohydrates are doing on proteins."
These carbohydrates seem to deter
mine whether a tumor cell spreads. Wied
mann isolated mutants that had different
surface carbohydrates from mouse cancer
cells. The mutants were derived from
metastasizing cells.
When these mutant tumor cells were
injected into mice, she found the resulting
tumors did not spread as well as the
original cells from which they came. In
one case, the tumors hardly spread.
Thus in the 19705, Wiedmann pre
sented the first strong evidence for the
link between the surface sugars and the
ability for tumor cells to spread. The
exact mechanism by which carbohydrates
influence metastasis has not yet been de
termined. However, work is currently un
der way by Wiedmann and other
researchers to find this mechanism.
