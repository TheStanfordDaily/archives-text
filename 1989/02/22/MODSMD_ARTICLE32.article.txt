A researcher in the Stanford School of Medicine has found that various sugars on the surface of cancer cells are linked
to the spreading of the tumor cells throughout the body. The exact connection is not yet known, but research in this
area is continuing. If the surface sugars can be modified in the right way, the spread of cancer may be controlled. Cancer
is one of the leading killers in the United States.
