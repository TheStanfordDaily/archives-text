# Heart experts warn cholesterol warrants concern from students

Although heart disease is un
common in youth, substantial
evidence links coronary risk fac
tors in young adults and the
subsequent development of ath
erosclerosis, a mtyor factor con
tributing to heart disease.
Atherosclerosis, the buildup
of fatty deposits along the walls
of the coronary artery, can begin
in childhood or adolescence and
the behavioral risk factors for
atherosclerosis become
entrenched in young adulthood,
according to experts.

Experts now recommend that
preventive intervention and
modification of risk factors
begin early in life.
Risk factors tend to "cluster"
together, and young people are
the most susceptible to multiple
factors. For example, risk fac
tors common in college are
stress, cigarette smoking, use of
oral contraceptives and poor
diet.
Although heart disease is
most commonly associated with
males, it is the leading cause of
death among women in the
United States. Heart disease ac
counts for about one-half of all
deaths in this country.
Unchangeable risk factors in
clude age, heredity and gender,

The buildup of
fatty deposits
along the walls of
the coronary ar
tery can begin as
early as child
hood or adoles
cence.

but doctors believe everyone has
some control over their risk for
heart disease.
The most dangerous of the
controllable risk factors are cig
arette smoking and high blood
cholesterol.
Although it is a necessary
component of body metabolism,
cholesterol becomes a problem
when it exceeds normal levels.
Cholesterol is produced
naturally by the body's cells for
metabolism and also comes from
foods high in saturated fats or
pure cholesterol. Cheese, butter,
milk, eggs and animal fats are
rich sources of cholesterol.
According to new guidelines
set by the National Institute of
Health, "desirable" levels of
cholesterol for adults are 200
milligrams per deciliter and 180
mg/dl for those younger than 30
years. "Borderline-high" blood

cholesterol levels range from
200-239 mg/dl, and "high" blood
cholesterol lies above 240 mg/dl.
The national average choles
terol level is well into the
borderline-high category,
indicating that the American
public needs to heed the mes
sage that lowering cholesterol
can prevent heart disease.
The National Cholesterol Ed
ucation Program recommends
that all adults age 20 and above
have their cholesterol levels
checked when they see a
physician. The organization also
recommends people two to 19
years of age with a significant
family history of coronary dis
ease check their cholesterol
levels.
The National Institutes of
Health recommend people with
elevated total blood cholesterol
receive a more detailed analysis
of their lipoproteins, the com
ponents involved in cholesterol
metabolism.
Some experts recommend
screening college students for
the major reversible coronary
risk factors, such as smoking,
hypertension and blood choles
terol.
