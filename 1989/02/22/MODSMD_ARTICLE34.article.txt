Q. This question has been puz
• zling my mother for years,
we lived in the Midwest, and all
winter we'd see birds hopping
around on the ice and snow, ap
parently perfectly happy. Why
don't birds freeze their little toes
off in the cold weather?
A. Birds, caribous, wolves and
• other animals with extended
limbs don't get frostbite on their
toes because of a reflex that
directs warm blood to their feet,
according to Biological Sciences
Prof. Craig Heller.
Large birds such as ducks and
geese have high metabolic rates
and produce large amounts of
heat. The final product of metab
olism — the process in which the

body uses energy — is heat.
An example of a process involv
ing metabolism producing heat is
shivering.
The large amount of heat
produced by metabolism is sent
through the blood to the feet. This
is known as the peripheral reflex.
The reaction keeps the bird's toes
above freezing temperature so
that the animal will not get
frostbite.
If the weather is too cold, the
bird will fold its feet under and
fluff up its feathers. As a "ball of
fluff" it is able to keep warm with
out wasting energy, Heller said.
In warm weather, the large cir
culation in their legs can actually
make birds hot. To combat the
heat, some birds urinate on their
legs to cool them off by evapora
tion, according to Biological
Sciences Prof. Philip Hanawalt.
Lobster fishermen in the
Northeastern United States have
adapted reflexes similar to the pe
ripheral reflexes of birds.
Ordinarily when someone puts
his or her hands into very cold
water, the blood vessels constrict.
The blood vessels in the fisher
man's hands, however, dilate to
keep their hands warm and
flexible in the freezing water.
Q, When you put Coke into a
• glass that you just finished
annking milk from, why does it
make so much of that disgusting
brown foam?
A. This phenomenon experi
• enced by some who do not
wash their dishes is the result of
fat molecules in the milk and the
coloring of Coke, according to
Chemistry Prof. Michael Fayer.
The carbon dioxide in sodas
such as Coke produces bubbles.
When the bubbles reach the sur
face, most of them burst, but

some stick because of the surface
tension of the liquid.
Milk has long fat molecules
similar to those found in soap.
These molecules form thicker and
more stable bubbles than water
bubbles, said Fayer. The long-life
bubbles form and appear as foam
in your cup.
The "disgusting" brown color
of the foam is simply a result of
the "disgusting" coloring in Coke.
An interesting experiment to do
in a university cafeteria is to try
to mix different kinds of sodas
with different kinds of milk. For
example, try pouring Sprite into
a glass that contained regular
milk. You should see foam without
color.
Also try pouring Coke in to a
glass that contained non-fat milk.
For this last experiment, you
should see foam, but it will not
be as thick.
