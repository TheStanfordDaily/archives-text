## Track teams split meets in Seattle 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Indoor track is a time of "assessment", according
to Stanford assistant track and field coach Scott
Chisam. Sunday's indoor meet at Washington has
shown that the Cardinal have definite strengths
with other weaknesses to improve before the outdoor
season.
Both the men and the women split a tri-meet
against Washington and Simon Fraser, with several
individuals accounting for the bulk of the Stanford
scoring.
Fifth-year senior Lisa Bernhagen has perhaps the
most to prove this season, and she was in fine form
yesterday.
Two years ago she had just set the women's
collegiate indoor high jump record at 6-foot-5V2 and
was at the top of her sport. At the Modesto relays
later in the year, she sprained her ankle while
warming-up for an indoor meet and has struggled
to regain championship form.
She easily took the women's high jump competi
tion Sunday at 6-IV4. She finally went out when
she missed at 6-3, and looks to be a real threat at
the NCAA indoor championship meet March 10 and
11 in Indianapolis.
Bernhagen is currently completing a co-terminal
program in sociology. This is her last season of
eligibility, with her final meet at Indianapolis.
The women also featured a trio of new faces on
the track. Freshman Chryste Gains blew away the
competition in the 55 meter dash, finishing in 7.12
seconds.
Taking over in the distances for Ail-American
Carol Gray, who was home nursing a foot injury,
was freshman Jodie Bilotta. Bilotta won the 800
meters in 2:16.7, while coming in second in the mile.
Bill Crowley also ran a strong double, taking the
mile and coming back to win the half-mile. The
junior ran tactical races, following a plan to tail
the main pack and then sprint to victory. The critical
stretch in the mile came in"the last 300 meters,"
where he pulled away to win by a second in 4:13.8.
The indoor racing season has always been low-key
for Stanford and has served as a period to evaluate
the teams strengths and weaknesses before outdoor
competition begins in March.
