Valerie Wilson could not
have had a happier 21st
birthday. Playing No. 6 singles
and No. 3 doubles for the Stan
ford women's tennis team yes
terday against Fresno State,
Wilson dropped but one game
in four sets to contribute two
wins to the Cardinal's 9-0 tally.

Cardinal 9, Bulldogs 0

The win increased No. 1
Stanford's record to 6-0 in dual
match play this season and
bodes well for this weekend's
Pacific 10 Conference series at
Arizona and Arizona State.
"I was very pleased," Stan
ford Coach Frank Brennan
said. "I think that we're start
ing to come together pretty
nicely. This was a really good
performance, because this
team (Fresno State) was not
half as bad as the scores indi
cate. We weren't playing with
a full lineup, but everybody
played nicely."
Missing was Lisa Green, who
was in Oakland competing as
a wild card in the Virginia
Slims tournament. Though she
has spent much of the season
as Stanford's No. 1 player, her

presence was not missed in the
Stanford Tennis Stadium yes
terday afternoon.
From the top of the lineup
to the bottom, every Stanford
player put in an outstanding
performance. Though the com
petition was hardly taxing —
as a team, the Cardinal only
lost 12 games in the nine
matches played — the Cardinal
netters played intensely enough
to beat any team in the coun
try.
Case in point was Kylie
Johnson, who faced Tara Eden
at No. 4 singles. Wielding her
tough serve as a potent weapon,
Johnson destroyed Eden 6-0,
6-0 in a rapid 40 minutes.
At the hands of Johnson,
Eden looked like a novice, able
to handle neither Johnson's
serve nor her quick returns.
Even more embarrassing, Eden
was thwarted by passing shots
though she never ventured
from the baseline. In short,
Johnson was dominant.
"I played well," Johnson
said. "I started out aggressively
and kept it up for the entire
match. That's when I play best,
when I'm on the offensive."
Cardinal captain Cindy
Buchsbaum had an equally
easy time with Karen Farquar
at No. 5 singles, recording a
