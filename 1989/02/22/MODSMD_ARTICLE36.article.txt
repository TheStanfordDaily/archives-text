# Netters down Fresno St.

Valerie Wilson could not
have had a happier 21st
birthday. Playing No. 6 singles
and No. 3 doubles for the Stan
ford women's tennis team yes
terday against Fresno State,
Wilson dropped but one game
in four sets to contribute two
wins to the Cardinal's 9-0 tally.

Cardinal 9, Bulldogs 0

The win increased No. 1
Stanford's record to 6-0 in dual
match play this season and
bodes well for this weekend's
Pacific 10 Conference series at
Arizona and Arizona State.
"I was very pleased," Stan
ford Coach Frank Brennan
said. "I think that we're start
ing to come together pretty
nicely. This was a really good
performance, because this
team (Fresno State) was not
half as bad as the scores indi
cate. We weren't playing with
a full lineup, but everybody
played nicely."
Missing was Lisa Green, who
was in Oakland competing as
a wild card in the Virginia
Slims tournament. Though she
has spent much of the season
as Stanford's No. 1 player, her

presence was not missed in the
Stanford Tennis Stadium yes
terday afternoon.
From the top of the lineup
to the bottom, every Stanford
player put in an outstanding
performance. Though the com
petition was hardly taxing —
as a team, the Cardinal only
lost 12 games in the nine
matches played — the Cardinal
netters played intensely enough
to beat any team in the coun
try.
Case in point was Kylie
Johnson, who faced Tara Eden
at No. 4 singles. Wielding her
tough serve as a potent weapon,
Johnson destroyed Eden 6-0,
6-0 in a rapid 40 minutes.
At the hands of Johnson,
Eden looked like a novice, able
to handle neither Johnson's
serve nor her quick returns.
Even more embarrassing, Eden
was thwarted by passing shots
though she never ventured
from the baseline. In short,
Johnson was dominant.
"I played well," Johnson
said. "I started out aggressively
and kept it up for the entire
match. That's when I play best,
when I'm on the offensive."
Cardinal captain Cindy
Buchsbaum had an equally
easy time with Karen Farquar
at No. 5 singles, recording a
6-1, 6-0 victory just two minutes
after Johnson and Eden shook
hands at the end of their match.
Five minutes after that, Wilson
finished her 6-1, 6-0 besting of
Katy Mclntyre.
With Stanford ahead 3-0, the
focus switched to center court.
Debbie Graham dispensed with
Valerie Stukovsky at No. 3 singles
6-1, 6-1 at the end of the Wilson-
Farquar match, leaving the No. 1
and No. 2 singles matches the
only contests left unresolved.
But not for long. Faced with a
tenacious competitor at No. 2
singles, Sandra Birch soon
prevailed 6-0, 6-0 over Maria Men
dez to clinch the Stanford win.
The score is deceiving, however.
Mendez, who last year upset
Green, gave Birch a challenging
match with her persistent baseline
topspin game.
"I figured I had to play a smart
match, be patient and wait for the
right shots and then to take my
opportunity when it came," Birch
said. "I felt I did that. I waited
and played high-percentage, ag
gressive tennis, which is what I
planned to do when I went out
today, and it worked."
That left Tami Whitlinger at
No. 1 singles, who faced another
topspin, rally-oriented player.
Taken off guard by the long ex
changes, WhitKnger fell behind 1-
2 in the first set before recovering
a 6-3, 6-0 victory over Jandrea
Ouwendijk.
With doubles a mere formality,
both teams relaxed a bit but
played intently. Concentration did
not help the team of Kim
Yohman-Farquar, who fell 6-0, 6-
0 to Johnson-Wilson at No. 3.
The Birch-Graham duo had
little difficulty either, toppling
Ouwendijk-Mendez 6-1, 6-0. A

team for years in juniors compe
tition, Birch and Graham blended
nicely and played fluidly, scoring
frequently with Graham's un
returnable serving and Birch's

sharp cross-court returns.
Buchsbaum-Whitlinger had a
bit more trouble at No. 2 doubles,
but not enough to spoil the pair's
6-2, 6-2 defeat of Stukovsky-Eden.
