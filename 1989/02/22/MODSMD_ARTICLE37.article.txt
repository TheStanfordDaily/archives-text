## Cyclists compete in weekend races at San Diego 
### Libby Feil Staff writer 
Paradoxically, last weekend's
cycling races at San Diego State
went both well and poorly for
the Stanford cycling team. "Lots
of people got some good exper
ience, but we had some unfor
tunate crashes," summarized
Co-captain Vit Henisz.
Saturday's punishing race
was "the hardest road race the
West Coast has ever seen,"
Henisz said, primarily because
of its 3,000 feet of ascent per
lap. In the women's race, Stan
ford's Shannon Phillips took
13th place to bring in some team
points, but the highest placings
for the day were found in the
men's categories.
B-category rider Henisz took
third place after being caught
by two other riders during his
gutsy solo breakaway attempt.
In the A category Stanford's
point scorers (in 10th and eighth
places, respectively) were Brian
Sterling, competing in his first

collegiate race, and Co-captain
Steve Miller. Both Sterling and
Miller were in the first chase
group trying to catch a small
breakaway group.
Sunday's criteriums were more
successful in garnering points for
the team than were Saturday's
races, yet they also brought an
unexpectedly large number of
crashes. The tricky course in
cluded a u-turn, forcing the racers
to drastically reduce their speed
and then sprint back to full
velocity on each lap.
In the women's B field, Becky
Wigglesworth and Stephanie Page
were in the lead group with only
three laps to go but were both
taken out by a crash. A field
cyclist Phillips had better luck in
her race. "She was a star," said
Henisz.
Phillips, in her first criterium
ever, took third place at the finish
after winning two "primes"
(bonus points awarded to the rider
crossing the finish line first on a
designated lap). As Miller com
mented, "Once she figured out
what [the primes] were, she won
them."
The men's races were marred
by wipeouts as well. However, D
category rider Josh Allen man
aged to overcome his crash. After
taking a grace lap to get his bike
back in shape, he hopped back
into the race and finished fifth
overall.
In the men's A-category, Tom
Moyer, Jason Tavakolian and Mil
ler grabbed prime points. On one
notable prime lap, Tavakolian
sprinted up along one side of the
field while Moyer moved up the
other for a 1-2 Stanford prime
finish. In the final A placings,
Tavakolian came in eighth and
Moyer was ninth.
Next weekend the team will

travel to Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
for an "early season test," accord
ing to Henisz. He said that "all
of our riders are going" to Cal
Poly-SLO. Stanford's strategy,
Henisz said, was to use the SDSU
races to gain experience for the
more important races like those
at Cal Poly-SLO this weekend. It
is unfortunate, however, that the
cost of getting this experience was
so high last weekend.
Synchro wins at Cal
Stanford's synchronized swim
teams swept all of their events in
last weekend's pre-regional meet
at California. The senior team
placed first to California's senior
team's second. The Cardinal
junior team came in third while
the Bears' junior team took
fourth.
In the duet event, the Cardinal's
Karen Madsen and Dee Cohen
took first place while their team
mates Debbie Brear and Ginny
Cohn earned second. The Stan
ford teams of Cohen, Melinda
Downey and Karen Madsen, and
Brear, Cohn and Amy Brown,
finished first and second respec
tively in the trios.
The compulsory figures were
even more of a showcase for Stan
ford's talent. The Cardinal's
senior team swept the top seven
places in its event. Madsen,
Downey, and Cohn took first, sec
ond and third respectively. Stan
ford swimmers were victorious as
well in the junior and novice com
pulsory figures, with Jenny Cole
man and Dawn McGuiness the
winners in their respective events.
The team's strong showing in
this dual meet against Cal
qualifies it for regionals, to be
held March 4 at Stanford.

game last weekend and emerged

victorious from the fray. Despite
their preseason ranking as one of
the top five teams on the West
Coast, the Gaels proved unable to
best the Cardinal.
"Our forwards played a very
strong game and we dominated
in the scrums," Captain Bill Brad
ford said.
Despite the efforts of forwards
Bradford, Matt Stone and Glenn
Jones, the "backs seemed to have
an off day," according to Bradford,
and the Cardinal got off to a
slower than usual start. Although
Stanford's Carter Stewart scored
a try and John Fitzpatrick got
two points on a conversion, the
Cardinal was one point down with
eight minutes left in the game.
At this crucial juncture
Fitzpatrick punted a drop-kick
from the middle of the field and
made it, giving the Cardinal a
small lead of 9-7. At that point,
Bradford later explained, "We
knew we were going to win."
The team held onto its tenuous
lead for the remainder of the game
to secure the win.
The victory over St. Mary's
"puts us in real good standing"
for the playoffs, Bradford said.
However, the team still has to
win its remaining three league
games to secure its berth in the
playoffs on April Bth at Arizona.
Although Stanford has a match
this Saturday against non-league
opponent San Francisco, its next
league game is not until March
2. On that date the team plays
San Jose State at Stanford's
Maloney Field at 1 p.m.

successful in garnering points for
the team than were Saturday's
races, yet they also brought an
unexpectedly large number of
crashes. The tricky course in
cluded a u-turn, forcing the racers
to drastically reduce their speed
and then sprint back to full
velocity on each lap.
In the women's B field, Becky
Wigglesworth and Stephanie Page
were in the lead group with only
three laps to go but were both
taken out by a crash. A field
cyclist Phillips had better luck in
her race. "She was a star," said
Henisz.
Phillips, in her first criterium
ever, took third place at the finish
after winning two "primes"
(bonus points awarded to the rider
crossing the finish line first on a
designated lap). As Miller com
mented, "Once she figured out
what [the primes] were, she won
them."
The men's races were marred
by wipeouts as well. However, D
category rider Josh Allen man
aged to overcome his crash. After
taking a grace lap to get his bike
back in shape, he hopped back
into the race and finished fifth
overall.
In the men's A-category, Tom
Moyer, Jason Tavakolian and Mil
ler grabbed prime points. On one
notable prime lap, Tavakolian
sprinted up along one side of the
field while Moyer moved up the
other for a 1-2 Stanford prime
finish. In the final A placings,
Tavakolian came in eighth and
Moyer was ninth.
Next weekend the team will

travel to Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
for an "early season test," accord
ing to Henisz. He said that "all
of our riders are going" to Cal
Poly-SLO. Stanford's strategy,
Henisz said, was to use the SDSU
races to gain experience for the
more important races like those
at Cal Poly-SLO this weekend. It
is unfortunate, however, that the
cost of getting this experience was
so high last weekend.
Synchro wins at Cal
Stanford's synchronized swim
teams swept all of their events in
last weekend's pre-regional meet
at California. The senior team
placed first to California's senior
team's second. The Cardinal
junior team came in third while
the Bears' junior team took
fourth.
In the duet event, the Cardinal's
Karen Madsen and Dee Cohen
took first place while their team
mates Debbie Brear and Ginny
Cohn earned second. The Stan
ford teams of Cohen, Melinda
Downey and Karen Madsen, and
Brear, Cohn and Amy Brown,
finished first and second respec
tively in the trios.
The compulsory figures were
even more of a showcase for Stan
ford's talent. The Cardinal's
senior team swept the top seven
places in its event. Madsen,
Downey, and Cohn took first, sec
ond and third respectively. Stan
ford swimmers were victorious as
well in the junior and novice com
pulsory figures, with Jenny Cole
man and Dawn McGuiness the
winners in their respective events.
The team's strong showing in
this dual meet against Cal
qualifies it for regionals, to be
held March 4 at Stanford.

victorious from the fray. Despite
their preseason ranking as one of
the top five teams on the West
Coast, the Gaels proved unable to
best the Cardinal.
"Our forwards played a very
strong game and we dominated
in the scrums," Captain Bill Brad
ford said.
Despite the efforts of forwards
Bradford, Matt Stone and Glenn
Jones, the "backs seemed to have
an off day," according to Bradford,
and the Cardinal got off to a
slower than usual start. Although
Stanford's Carter Stewart scored
a try and John Fitzpatrick got
two points on a conversion, the
Cardinal was one point down with
eight minutes left in the game.
At this crucial juncture
Fitzpatrick punted a drop-kick
from the middle of the field and
made it, giving the Cardinal a
small lead of 9-7. At that point,
Bradford later explained, "We
knew we were going to win."
The team held onto its tenuous
lead for the remainder of the game
to secure the win.
The victory over St. Mary's
"puts us in real good standing"
for the playoffs, Bradford said.
However, the team still has to
win its remaining three league
games to secure its berth in the
playoffs on April Bth at Arizona.
Although Stanford has a match
this Saturday against non-league
opponent San Francisco, its next
league game is not until March
2. On that date the team plays
San Jose State at Stanford's
Maloney Field at 1 p.m.
Paradoxically, last weekend's
cycling races at San Diego State
went both well and poorly for
the Stanford cycling team. "Lots
of people got some good exper
ience, but we had some unfor
tunate crashes," summarized
Co-captain Vit Henisz.
Saturday's punishing race
was "the hardest road race the
West Coast has ever seen,"
Henisz said, primarily because
of its 3,000 feet of ascent per
lap. In the women's race, Stan
ford's Shannon Phillips took
13th place to bring in some team
points, but the highest placings
for the day were found in the
men's categories.
B-category rider Henisz took
third place after being caught
by two other riders during his
gutsy solo breakaway attempt.
In the A category Stanford's
point scorers (in 10th and eighth
places, respectively) were Brian
Sterling, competing in his first
