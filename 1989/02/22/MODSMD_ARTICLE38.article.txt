# O'Brien triumphs in NorCal tourney
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
If this weekend's Northern Cal
ifornia Intercollegiate Tennis
Championships are any indica
tion, Stanford men's tennis Coach
Dick Gould has once again
brought an outstanding freshman
class to the Farm. A small class,
yes, but an outstanding one none
theless.
Alex O'Brien, the only fresh
man on the Stanford team, cap
tured the first of what may be
his many collegiate tournament
titles yesterday, rolling over team
mate Martin Blackman 6-2, 6-3
in the finals of the 42nd NorCal
Tournament at San Jose State.
Riding an efficient first serve,
O'Brien, seeded 10th at the start
of the weekend, racked up his sec
ond straight win over a fellow
Cardinal player (he defeated Jeff
Cathrall 6-1, 6-4 in the semis) to
take the title.
"Alex had a great weekend,"
Gould said. "He's done a heck of
a job. I was really impressed with
him all weekend. He had a great
match against Jeff and then again
(yesterday)."
The key to O'Brien's win, ac
cording to Gould, was the service
game. "(Alex) served very well,"
Gould said. "He hardly missed
any first serves, so Martin didn't
really have a chance to attack with
his returns. Martin didn't serve
as well .. . [and] Alex has the
kind of game that if you don't
serve well, he can really use that
to his advantage."

O'Brien also felt his strength
throughout the weekend was his
serve. "I'm really serving well,"
he said. "I'm happy with my serve
— it's basically what pulled me
through this tournament."
The freshman's confidence,
which had been building all week
end, is now at full strength. "I
was in kind of a slump," O'Brien
said, referring to his loss in the
team's season opener against UC-
Irvine. "It's good to get over the
hump. . . . Martin's a great player,
and I'm just happy I played well.
I just want to do my best to be
a good part of the team."
O'Brien has been handling the
No. 5 spot for the Cardinal in
dual-match play, but his play this
weekend shows that "he's proven
he can play with anybody," in
Gould's words.
In the doubles final yesterday,
the Stanford tandem of Barry Ric
hards and Eric Peus lost to Cal
ifornia's Kurt Streeter and Carl
Chang 6-4, 6-4. The Cardinal
team jumped all over the Bear
duo at the start, racing ahead to
a 4-0 lead, but then ran out of gas.
"They [Richards and Peus] got
up 4-0 in the first and were cruis
ing, but then they had some bad
breaks in their service games,"
Stanford Asst. Coach John Whit
linger said. "They probably still
can't believe they lost the match.
"You have to give the Cal team
credit, though," Whitlinger con
tinued. "When you get down 4-0
you usually forget about the first
set, but they came right back."
