# Final Four fantasy: Cinderella in Seattle
## 
### 
The date: March 25, 1989. The place:
Rupp Arena in Lexington, Ky. The
event: The finals of the Southeast Re
gional of the NCAA men's basketball tourna
ment. The time: 10 p.m.
The camera zooms in on Stanford's all-time
leading scorer, and probably the best player
in the school's history, Todd Lichti. The game
has been over for several minutes, and most
of the team has taken the celebration into
the locker room.
But not Lichti.

The senior guard is staring at the scoreboard
and smiling. There in lights is the final tally:
Stanford 76, North Carolina 72. On the CBS
close-up, even the most amateur of lip readers
can make out Lichti's words â€” "I can't believe
it. We're going to the Final Four."
What a fitting last chapter on a storybook
season for Lichti and the rest of the Cardinal.
The team hadn't won 20 games in back-to
back seasons since 1940-41 and 1941-42. They
hadn't even been to the tournament since
winning the thing back in '42.
And, though they finished second in the
conference behind Arizona, Stanford's 26-6
record was enough to earn the Cardinal a No.
3 seed in the Southeast.

Still, the pundits had their doubts. They
said the team lacked quickness, that the point
guard wasn't very good and that Coach Mike
Montgomery should stop thinking he's the
next Dean Smith.
But this night the team was more than
quick enough as they easily brought the ball
up the court in the game's waning minutes.
Point guard Terry Taylor's four second-half
3-pointers forced the Tar Heels to extend their
defense and opened up things inside. And,
Montgomery's 1-1-3 zone left Smith's troops
in a tizzy as their offense never seemed quite
settled.
Stanford avenged one of its six losses on
the year and was headed for the Promised
Land.
Still, the "experts" remained unsatisfied.
The other Final Four teams were Okla
homa, Arizona and Georgetown. The No.
1, 2 and 3 teams in the nation heading into
the tourney.
Could the Cardinal wear the glass slipper
in Seattle? "Not a chance!" analyst Billy
Packer said emphatically. "Georgetown will
press the Cardinal to death in that semi and,
in the other one, Arizona won't let Oklahoma
get 'em like they did last year."
Turn the clock forward to the Final Four.
The Kingdome is the setting this Saturday
evening. The Georgetown Hoyas, coached by
John Thompson and led by superfrosh Alonzo
Mourning, are prohibitive lIV 2 point favorites.
In the earlier game, Arizona knocked off
the Sooners 94-88 to earn a spot in the final.
In his pregame chat, Montgomery reminds
the Cardinal that the keys to the game are
to remain calm and not make many mistakes
against the press.
"That's easy for you to say, coach," one of

the Stanford players mumbles.
"What was that?" Montgomery retorted.
There was silence.
The player's are introduced and the team's
get ready for the tipoff. The 6-foot-10 Mourn
ing outleaps Stanford's Howard Wright and
the Hoyas control the ball.
Charles Smith IV stands outside the 3-point
arc and lets fly a rainbow from 20 feet. Swish.
The Hoyas draw first blood.
Georgetown immediately employs their full
court press. Wright inbounds to Taylor who
dribbles past two Georgetown defenders. He
passes to Eric Reveno who sees Andrew Vlahov
on the wing.
Reveno throws a baseball pass to Vlahov.
The Australian pulls up from 22 feet and
finds nothing but net. The game is tied.
The rest of the first half is similar. The
teams trade hoops most of the way. The Car
dinal has some trouble with the press and
turns the ball over nine times. The halflime
score: Georgetown 47, Stanford 40. The most
important statistic: Mourning has three fouls.
At halftime, Montgomery tries to keep the
team loose. He suggests a few adjustments to
deal with the press and diagrams a few plays
designed to get the ball to Lichti. The Hoyas
have been unable to stop Lichti thus far. He
has tallied 17 points.
In the second half, Georgetown goes into a
box-and-one defense to keep Lichti from light
ing it up. The technique is effective in tying
up Lichti but does nothing to stop Wright's
offensive explosion. Slams, jams and
fadeaways from Wright allow the Cardinal to
keep it close. Then, with 9:14 on the clock
and Georgetown leading 69-60, the game's
most pivotal play unfolds.
