You never thought it would hap
pen. But believe it or not, errors
are killing the Cardinal this
season.

Baseball
Spartans 7, Cardinal 6 (10 inn.)

In each of the last two seasons,
the Stanford baseball team has
ridden to the College World Series
on the strength of its defense, but
this year untimely miscues have
cost the Cardinal more than one
game.
Against San Jose State yester
day, the Cardinal took a 6-5 lead
to the bottom of the ninth inning
only to see two unearned runs
turn it into a 7-6, 10-inning loss.
When Stanford was unable to
score in the top of the 10th, the
Spartans took advantage of a tired
Cardinal squad, which had just
come off a tough weekend against
UC-Santa Barbara.
With one out, Spartan right
fielder John Bracken led off the
inning with a double followed by
Steve Anderson's intentional

walk. Cardinal first baseman
Brian Johnson then mishandled
a ground ball by Greg Mitchell
and the bases were loaded with
one out.
Stanford's defense tightened for
the moment as second baseman
Frank Carey took Greg Borger
son's ground ball and threw it
home for the second out of the
inning. But Kevin Tannahill's
short fly ball to right field fell
just in front of a charging Paul
Carey and the game was over.
With the score knotted at five
runs apiece going into the top of
the ninth, Frank Carey led off
with a single and Troy Paulsen
was hit by a pitch. On Paul
Carey's fly ball to center, both
runners tagged up but Paulsen
was caught at second while Frank
Carey moved on to third.
Tim Griffin then singled up the
middle to score Carey and the
Cardinal led 6-5.
In the home half of the inning
however, an error by shortstop
Paulsen allowed the tying run to
score. Mike Irvin started things
off for the Spartans with an in
field single and moved to second
on Paulsen'B throwing error. Then
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
replaced pitcher Aaron Dorlarque
with Scott Weiss, Stanford's
pitcher of good fortune who had
already racked up a 3-0 record.
But Weiss could not stop the
inevitable this time as Tannahill's
groundout moved Irvin to third

and Andy Coan scored him with
a sacrifice fly.
Card notes
Stanford is now 1-2 on the season
in extra-inning games.
Griffin has hit well throughout the
Cardinal's sluggish streak. He was 3-
for-5 yesterday with 3 RBI. He is now
tied for second on the team with 11
RBI. Paulsen leads that category with
14 of his own.
