## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
If Stanford's 1989 football team
is half as impressive as the team's
coaches' resumes, Cardinal fans
will be in for a pleasant surprise.
Stanford Coach Dennis Green,
who was the wide receivers coach
for the Super Bowl champion San
Francisco '49ers, filled the ninth
and final coaching spot with Mike
Riley yesterday. Riley comes to
the Farm from the Winnipeg Blue
Bombers where he was the head
coach of the 1988 Canadian Foot
ball League champions.
Riley will serve as the defensive
coordinator and the inside
linebackers coach. Dick Mannini,
previously named inside lineback
ers coach, will now become the
defensive line coach.
Riley led the Blue Bombers to
a 12-9 record in his first season,
the top record in the Eastern Di
vision of the CFL. Last season,
Riley's second with the squad,
Winnipeg went 9-9 in the regular
season but the team went on to
win the Grey Cup 22-21 over the
British Columbia Lions.
"I feel that Riley is an outstand
ing defensive specialist," Green
said. "He'll employ an innovative
and aggressive style that we'll
develop into a Stanford
trademark. His experience as a
former head coach of the Grey
Cup Champion Winnipeg Blue
Bombers has given him a thor
ough leadership quality and ad
ministrative background to be a
great addition to our staff."
"I'm very excited and pleased
to be a part of Stanford University
and Coach Green's football pro
gram," Riley said.
