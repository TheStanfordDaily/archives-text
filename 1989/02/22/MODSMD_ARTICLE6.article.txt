# On discriminatory grounds
## Law students push to expel recruiter 
### Caitlin Liu Staff writer 
Invoking the Law School's non
discrimination policy for the first
time, a coalition of the school's
student groups is calling for a one

law firm, Baker & McKenzie, from
recruiting on campus.
The demand is in protest of
reportedly sexist, racist and anti-
Semitic remarks made by a part
ner of the firm during a recruiting
interview at the University of
Chicago last fall.

have their own."
After the applicant reported the
incident, the University of
Chicago Law School banned Baker
& McKenzie from recruiting on
its campus for one year. Stanford
law student organizations said
they want their administration to
do the same.
According to Law School Dean
Paul Brest, however, pressure
from student groups will not
decide the issue. Instead, the in
cident will be evaluated based on
Law School policy,
"The issue is the correct thing
to do under the Law School's
policy on non-discrimination," he
said.
Stanford's current policy,
adopted last May by the Law
School faculty, states "... Stanford
Law School makes its facilities and
services open only to employers
who do not discriminate on the
basis of age, religion, disability,
ethnic background, national
