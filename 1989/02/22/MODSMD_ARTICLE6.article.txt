# On discriminatory grounds
## Law students push to expel recruiter 
### Caitlin Liu Staff writer 
Invoking the Law School's non
discrimination policy for the first
time, a coalition of the school's
student groups is calling for a one
year ban on the nation's largest
law firm, Baker & McKenzie, from
recruiting on campus.
The demand is in protest of
reportedly sexist, racist and anti-
Semitic remarks made by a part
ner of the firm during a recruiting
interview at the University of
Chicago last fall.
According to a Feb. 3 New York
Times article, the partner asked
a black woman applicant how she
would respond if she were called
a "black bitch" or a "nigger" by
colleagues or adversaries.
Later in the interview, The
Times reported, the woman said
she played golf and the partner
asked, "Why don't blacks have
their own country club?" Answer
ing his own question, he con
cluded, "There aren't too many
golf courses in the ghetto."
At the end of the interview, ac

cording to The Times, the partner
said he would never join a Jewish
country club, but "at least they
have their own."
After the applicant reported the
incident, the University of
Chicago Law School banned Baker
& McKenzie from recruiting on
its campus for one year. Stanford
law student organizations said
they want their administration to
do the same.
According to Law School Dean
Paul Brest, however, pressure
from student groups will not
decide the issue. Instead, the in
cident will be evaluated based on
Law School policy,
"The issue is the correct thing
to do under the Law School's
policy on non-discrimination," he
said.
Stanford's current policy,
adopted last May by the Law
School faculty, states "... Stanford
Law School makes its facilities and
services open only to employers
who do not discriminate on the
basis of age, religion, disability,
ethnic background, national
origin, gender, race, sexual orien
tation or veteran status."
According to Brest, an oversight
committee, composed of two fac
ulty members and one student,
will decide whether or not to ban
the firm from campus recruit
ment. Brest said he would "over
ride" the decision only if the com
mittee acts in a way that is "ex
traordinarily ill-advised."
A committee member, Law
School Asst. Dean of Student Af
fairs Sally Dickson declined to
comment on the case yesterday,
saying that the members are still
deliberating. She also refused to
say when they will announce the
decision.

Baker & McKenzie has asked
to hold a forum at Stanford to
discuss the incident. Law students
have opposed this, saying discus
sion is unnecessary since no one
disputes the facts.
"In the past, this law school has
held forums because the facts of
a case were in dispute," said Black
Law Students Association Co
chair Whitney Leigh. "Here, this
incident was verified. Both the
student and the firm agree about
what had happened."
Lisalyn Jacobs, also an associ
ation co-chair, said the firm
should not be given a chance to
downplay the offences.
In addition to the the black stu
dent association, the women's,
Latino, Jewish, and gay and les
bian law student associations have
also demanded that the Law
School ban Baker & McKenzie.
