Unless the University acts quickly, Stan
ford will have no Asian-American studies
classes next year.
Gordon Chang, a lecturer who is the only
person currently teaching a course in the
area, informed the University last week
that he will leave to take a tenure-track
position at UC-Irvine.
Several student organizations worked
this year to gain a professorship for Chang.
In a list of demands nailed to University
President Donald Kennedy's door in the
fall, the Students of Color Coalition asked
that Chang be grant**! tenure immediately.
The ASSU and the Asian-American Stu
dents Association has also asked that the
University create a tenured seat in Asian-
American studies, though they have not
specifically named Chang.
Stanford officials say they are still con
sidering the requests.
Chang will resign at the end of the ac
ademic year from the International Stra
tegic Institute at Stanford, where he directs
a project on current security relations in
Asia. He said the Irvine offer was "more
attractive" than staying at Stanford be
cause the school gave him a tenure-track
position in its History Department.
Chang will still teach his course, "Topics
in Asian-American History," spring quarter
through the History Department. The de
partment has not announced whether it
will hire someone to teach the class next
year.
Chang taught the first Asian-American
studies course at Stanford as a graduate
student here 18 years ago. After a 10-year
absence, during which he taught at UC-
Berkeley and other schools, Chang returned
to Stanford and taught student-initiated
SWOPSI courses about Asian-American
history throughout the 1970s and early
1980s.
In the mid-80s, students were able to
convince the History Department to offer
an Asian-American studies course. The de
partment did not pay Chang for teaching
the course in 1984, its first year, but stu
dent fund raising helped pay him. Others

taught the course for the next two years,
and Chang took over again in 1987. At
that point the History Department reim
bursed the International Strategic Institute
but did not pay Chang directly.
The History Department has been
"buying my time from ISIS," Chang said.
Stanford has programs in Afro-American
studies, Mexican-American studies and
Jewish studies, but the University has
made no commitment to an Asian-
American studies program.
"I think it's noteworthy that it has taken
students to push for this program when
[the program's necessity] should be evident
to the University," Chang said.
Richard Suh, who chairs AASA's Issues
Committee, said yesterday that he believes
Chang's leaving is part of a pattern that
has repeated for the past 15 years. "Asian-
American scholars teach at Stanford and
then leave for better offers," he said.
The association has been petitioning for
the creation of a tenure-track position for
an Asian-American history professor since
the end of January. "We are looking for a
commitment from someone in the admin
istration, probably Provost (James) Rosse,
that there will be a search for a tenured
professor," Suh said.
Members of the Asian-American commu
nity will meet with Rosse on Friday to
discuss the issue, Suh said.
"We feel optimistic at this point. The
History Department seems to be behind
[the proposal]," Suh said. "What we are
asking for is not unreasonable," he added.
History Department Chair James Shee
han was unavailable for comment yester
day.
In addition to the AASA movement, three
weeks ago the ASSU passed a resolution
that the University create a position for a
tenure-track position in Asian-American
studies.
Even with University support it is not
possible that such a position could be
created for next year because it would have
to be moved from another department. A
search could begin next year for a professor
to fill a position for the 1990-91 school
year, according to Kathryn Gillam, assis
tant dean of Academic Affairs.
