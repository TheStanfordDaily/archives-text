# Tuning into brain wave research
## Scientists question accuracy of anesthetized animal testing 
### Rachel Oliker 
Stanford scientists assert that
years of research on anesthetized
animals might be erroneous be
cause researchers have not been
measuring brain wave activity, a
valuable measure of factors that
might influence the experiment.
"Most of the knowledge about
the brain comes from anes
thetized animals, but how much
of that information is really
true?" said Biological Sciences
Prof. Craig Heller, one of the re
searchers involved in the finding.
Dennis Grahn, a graduate stu
dent working with Heller, said sci
entists have been working with
incomplete animal models, and
this finding has closed the door
on some previous research on
anesthetized animals with un
monitored brain wave activity.
The team determined that cer
tain experiments using anes
thetized animals are inaccurate

because changes in an animal's
arousal state — the general state
of the nervous system — have
not been accounted for. Arousal
state changes can occur even if
an animal is anesthetized with
urethane, an anesthetic com
monly used on animals, the
Stanford team concluded.
Heller said that within ther
moregulatory physiology, a field
which involves temperature
regulation in animals, researchers
will have to re-evaluate their data.
He added, however, that it is too
early to predict how their dis
covery will affect other fields of
research.
Grahn, Heller and Steven
Glotzbach, a Medical Center re
search associate, investigated how
brain patterns reflect tempera
ture changes and other stimuli.
They used electrodes to record ac
tivity of cells in the nervous sys
tem while temperature stimulus
was applied to the skin.

An electroencephelogram, or
EEG, recorded changes in arousal
by monitoring activity of the
whole brain. Also, the scientists
monitored muscle activity
through an electromyogram.
The Stanford team found that
arousal states of sleep and wake
fulness have strong effects on the
nervous system. A stimulus, such
as a drug, may have a different
effect on an animal when it is
asleep as opposed to when it is
awake.
Heller's research group found
that the rate at which neurons
fire reflected in the EEG correlate
to temperature, one of many types
of stimuli which can change an
animal's arousal state.
Urethane-anesthetized animals
are inappropriate unless changes
in arousal state are measured.
This finding has cast doubt upon
previous research which tried to
regulate animals without moni*
toring EEG patterns.
