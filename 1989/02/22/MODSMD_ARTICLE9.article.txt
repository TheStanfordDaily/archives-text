# Council soon to release statement on Standard
## 
### Goodwin Liu Staff writer 
, The Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council plans to make public
its proposed guidelines for inter
preting the Fundamental Stand
ard next Wednesday, council chair
George Parker said yesterday.
The council's statement, which
will appear in The Daily and
Campus Report next week, marks
the council's first attempt ever to
establish interpretations of and
guidelines for applying the 83-
year-old code of conduct.
In a meeting last week, the 12-
member council agreed on the
guidelines and interpretations to
appear in the proposal. Two coun
cil members, Philosophy Prof.
John Perry and council of Presi
dents member Canetta Ivy
produced a draft of the guidelines
last Friday.
The council met for nearly two
hours last night and unanimously
approved a final draft of the state
ment, said Parker, a professor in
the Graduate School of Business.
While none of the members cast
a "no" vote at last night's meet
ing, Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole noted that only seven of the

12 members attended. In addition,
discussion moved so swiftly that
"no one could focus on the com
plete, final version" of the state
ment, said Cole, one of three non
voting council member.
All members of the council "still
have several days to propose revi
sions" to the final draft, she said.
Adding that she does not believe
the council will revise the present
statement, Cole said she expects
the statement to be released next
Wednesday as planned.
Parker told The Daily last night
that the statement is "carefully
written" and emphasizes "both
the importance of free speech and
diversity."
Neither Perry, Cole nor Parker
would comment on the proposal's
specifics.
"We don't want to talk about
the specific content of the draft,
although I believe its content will
be considered reasonable by the
Stanford community," Parker
said, adding that the draft con
tains "nothing close to provoca
tive."
The publication of the proposed
guidelines is just the first step in
the long process of enacting the
council's statement as legislation.
