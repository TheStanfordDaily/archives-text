THE ASSU NEWS
Are You Batting a Mid-Winter Bout with Spring Fever?
Don't fight it. JOIN IT!
Spring into Action with SPRING ACTION '89!
RALLY FOR EDUCATION with
JESSE JACKSON and CESAR CHAVEZ!
Do you care about education? Here's your chance to make a difference. Spring
Action '89 is your opportunity to help write, lobby for, and pass California
legislation that will make education better for all people.
We've been hearing a lot recently about nurturing a multi-cultural education
here at Stanford, but the issue doesn't end at Campus Drive, it's an issue
everywhere. A majority of the students in California's public schools are Chicano,
Asian, Black, or American Indian, yet less than 1.5% of five-year olds of color will
ever graduate from a four year institution because they are pushed out at various
levels of their education.
We need to set a new direction for education in California—in a direction that
appreciates the multi-cultural nature of our state and our society.
On April 10, 1989, our statewide Third World Student networks of
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA), African Black
Statewide Students' Alliance (A/BSSA) and Asian/Pacific Islander Student
Union (APSU) will join thousands of students, community members,
parents and teachers in a spring event for education.
Come join Jesse Jackson and Cesar Chavez, a host of community leaders,
teachers, and legislators. Meet with the governor and help get his
commitment to sign this legislation into law and to insure funding. Lobby
for support for our Education Bill.
What you can do:
• Organize your dorm to go to the April 10th action! We may challenge Berkeley to
see which campus can bring the most people! (Beat Cal for Education)
• Help establish a mailout center in the ASSU to help publicize the event!
• Educate yourselves about these issues! Educational policy is complicated but key
to making change.
If you are interested in finding out more or want to get involved, talk to your dorm
rep, or get in touch with someone in AASA, BSU, MEChA, or SAIO, or call
72 5-ASSU!
TA CUTBACK UPDATE
In the last issue, the ASSU News reported that as a result of the TA cutbacks,
most sections in Asian Languages exceed 40 students, and that an Economics
class had only one TA for over 120 students.
The situation, though still in need of improvement, is not as bad as it may
seem.
• The Asian Language department does try to limit the section sizes to 25, but
because of the limit, many students are pushed out of sections at popular times.
The increasing demand of students for Asian Languages merits attention and
accomodation.
• After a COP meeting with TAs, the economics department assigned another TA
to the 120 student class. We applaud this step in the right direction, but more
still needs to be done.
Sign the petition to reinstate TA cutbacks!
COP Update 0n...
ASSU Dorm
Reps
• ASSU Survey: Along with Dorm Reps,
we've conducted two surveys: one on
the new ASSU services initiated by
the COP, and another on the ASSU
Speakers' Bureau and Sunday Flicks.
We've learned that the new services
were a big hit, and with your input
these services will be even better
next quarter. We'll publish the results
from both surveys 500n...
• Expanding Student Representation:
This week the COP will have Dorm
Reps meetings on the Row, in Cowcll
Cluster and Mirrielees, and in
Governor's Corner. Join us in making
the ASSU responsive to your needs.
• Taking Action on Student Issues:
Dorm Reps have asked us to organize
students to fight against TA cutbacks
and secure more Food Service
options. Over seventy students,
including many Dorm Reps, arc now
working with us on these two
important issues. Several Reps also
want to see something done.
Got the Food Service Blues?
• Does you wallet suddenly start feeling very light when you throw away
seven uneaten meals off your mealcard every week?
• Do your arteries start hardening just looking at a turkey meal that has
69% of its calories coming from fat?
• Do you sometimes get the feeling that something is not quite right
when you pay $9 for $1.50 worth of food?
• Do you ever look up from your $9 salad to see a 250 pound football
player shoveling down his fourth entree and think, is there justice in
the world?
• Do you ever stare at your food service meal, and ask yourself, WHY?
Well, the COP can relate, and we're doing something about it. Here's what:
Opening up communication lines with Food Service. We've met with
Jim Keeton, Director of Food Service, and let him know students' concerns. The
meeting seemed to offer promise that we would be able to have a 10-meal plan
and possibly would be able to allow students to carry over meals from week to
week.
Comparing Stanford's Food Service to other schools'. We called other
universities and found that most had much more flexible meal plans. The cost of
the food service was generally comparable, but students at other schools received
more for their money.
Tresidder accepting meal cards? We thought it was a good idea too.
Tresidder officials seem very interested in the possibility of allowing students to
use meal cards at Tresidder, and are willing to work something out with food
service. Stay tuned.
Involving students. Two students have been appointed to the Food Service
Advisory Committee. Over 40 others have attended our meetings. Dorm reps have
also contributed suggestions and let their dorms know what's going on.
What's Happening Now?
• Campus-wide Food Service Survey. Look for it and PLEASE fill it out. It's
something very near and dear to everyone's heart-FOOD!
• Investigation of financial implications is underway. How much is
carrying over meals and having a 10-meal option going to cost us, and
is it worth it?
We're having a meeting!! TODAY at 12 novn in Paloma Lounge. WE WANT YOU!
Please come!

important issues. Several Reps also
want to see something done.
Got the Food Service Blues?
• Does you wallet suddenly start feeling very light when you throw away
seven uneaten meals off your mealcard every week?
• Do your arteries start hardening just looking at a turkey meal that has
69% of its calories coming from fat?
• Do you sometimes get the feeling that something is not quite right
when you pay $9 for $1.50 worth of food?
• Do you ever look up from your $9 salad to see a 250 pound football
player shoveling down his fourth entree and think, is there justice in
the world?
• Do you ever stare at your food service meal, and ask yourself, WHY?
Well, the COP can relate, and we're doing something about it. Here's what:
Opening up communication lines with Food Service. We've met with
Jim Keeton, Director of Food Service, and let him know students' concerns. The
meeting seemed to offer promise that we would be able to have a 10-meal plan
and possibly would be able to allow students to carry over meals from week to
week.
Comparing Stanford's Food Service to other schools'. We called other
universities and found that most had much more flexible meal plans. The cost of
the food service was generally comparable, but students at other schools received
more for their money.
Tresidder accepting meal cards? We thought it was a good idea too.
Tresidder officials seem very interested in the possibility of allowing students to
use meal cards at Tresidder, and are willing to work something out with food
service. Stay tuned.
Involving students. Two students have been appointed to the Food Service
Advisory Committee. Over 40 others have attended our meetings. Dorm reps have
also contributed suggestions and let their dorms know what's going on.
What's Happening Now?
• Campus-wide Food Service Survey. Look for it and PLEASE fill it out. It's
something very near and dear to everyone's heart-FOOD!
• Investigation of financial implications is underway. How much is
carrying over meals and having a 10-meal option going to cost us, and
is it worth it?
We're having a meeting!! TODAY at 12 novn in Paloma Lounge. WE WANT YOU!
Please come!

THE ASSU NEWS
Are You Batting a Mid-Winter Bout with Spring Fever?
Don't fight it. JOIN IT!
Spring into Action with SPRING ACTION '89!
RALLY FOR EDUCATION with
JESSE JACKSON and CESAR CHAVEZ!
Do you care about education? Here's your chance to make a difference. Spring
Action '89 is your opportunity to help write, lobby for, and pass California
legislation that will make education better for all people.
We've been hearing a lot recently about nurturing a multi-cultural education
here at Stanford, but the issue doesn't end at Campus Drive, it's an issue
everywhere. A majority of the students in California's public schools are Chicano,
Asian, Black, or American Indian, yet less than 1.5% of five-year olds of color will
ever graduate from a four year institution because they are pushed out at various
levels of their education.
We need to set a new direction for education in California—in a direction that
appreciates the multi-cultural nature of our state and our society.
On April 10, 1989, our statewide Third World Student networks of
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA), African Black
Statewide Students' Alliance (A/BSSA) and Asian/Pacific Islander Student
Union (APSU) will join thousands of students, community members,
parents and teachers in a spring event for education.
Come join Jesse Jackson and Cesar Chavez, a host of community leaders,
teachers, and legislators. Meet with the governor and help get his
commitment to sign this legislation into law and to insure funding. Lobby
for support for our Education Bill.
What you can do:
• Organize your dorm to go to the April 10th action! We may challenge Berkeley to
see which campus can bring the most people! (Beat Cal for Education)
• Help establish a mailout center in the ASSU to help publicize the event!
• Educate yourselves about these issues! Educational policy is complicated but key
to making change.
If you are interested in finding out more or want to get involved, talk to your dorm
rep, or get in touch with someone in AASA, BSU, MEChA, or SAIO, or call
72 5-ASSU!
TA CUTBACK UPDATE
In the last issue, the ASSU News reported that as a result of the TA cutbacks,
most sections in Asian Languages exceed 40 students, and that an Economics
class had only one TA for over 120 students.
The situation, though still in need of improvement, is not as bad as it may
seem.
• The Asian Language department does try to limit the section sizes to 25, but
because of the limit, many students are pushed out of sections at popular times.
The increasing demand of students for Asian Languages merits attention and
accomodation.
• After a COP meeting with TAs, the economics department assigned another TA
to the 120 student class. We applaud this step in the right direction, but more
still needs to be done.
Sign the petition to reinstate TA cutbacks!

• ASSU Survey: Along with Dorm Reps,
we've conducted two surveys: one on

were a big hit, and with your input
these services will be even better
next quarter. We'll publish the results
from both surveys 500n...
• Expanding Student Representation:
This week the COP will have Dorm
Reps meetings on the Row, in Cowcll
Cluster and Mirrielees, and in
Governor's Corner. Join us in making
the ASSU responsive to your needs.
• Taking Action on Student Issues:
Dorm Reps have asked us to organize
students to fight against TA cutbacks
and secure more Food Service
options. Over seventy students,
including many Dorm Reps, arc now
working with us on these two
important issues. Several Reps also

THE ASSU NEWS
Are You Batting a Mid-Winter Bout with Spring Fever?
Don't fight it. JOIN IT!
Spring into Action with SPRING ACTION '89!
RALLY FOR EDUCATION with
JESSE JACKSON and CESAR CHAVEZ!
Do you care about education? Here's your chance to make a difference. Spring
Action '89 is your opportunity to help write, lobby for, and pass California
legislation that will make education better for all people.
We've been hearing a lot recently about nurturing a multi-cultural education
here at Stanford, but the issue doesn't end at Campus Drive, it's an issue
everywhere. A majority of the students in California's public schools are Chicano,
Asian, Black, or American Indian, yet less than 1.5% of five-year olds of color will
ever graduate from a four year institution because they are pushed out at various
levels of their education.
We need to set a new direction for education in California—in a direction that
appreciates the multi-cultural nature of our state and our society.
On April 10, 1989, our statewide Third World Student networks of
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA), African Black
Statewide Students' Alliance (A/BSSA) and Asian/Pacific Islander Student
Union (APSU) will join thousands of students, community members,
parents and teachers in a spring event for education.
Come join Jesse Jackson and Cesar Chavez, a host of community leaders,
teachers, and legislators. Meet with the governor and help get his
commitment to sign this legislation into law and to insure funding. Lobby
for support for our Education Bill.
What you can do:
• Organize your dorm to go to the April 10th action! We may challenge Berkeley to
see which campus can bring the most people! (Beat Cal for Education)
• Help establish a mailout center in the ASSU to help publicize the event!
• Educate yourselves about these issues! Educational policy is complicated but key
to making change.
If you are interested in finding out more or want to get involved, talk to your dorm
rep, or get in touch with someone in AASA, BSU, MEChA, or SAIO, or call
72 5-ASSU!
TA CUTBACK UPDATE
In the last issue, the ASSU News reported that as a result of the TA cutbacks,
most sections in Asian Languages exceed 40 students, and that an Economics
class had only one TA for over 120 students.
The situation, though still in need of improvement, is not as bad as it may
seem.
• The Asian Language department does try to limit the section sizes to 25, but
because of the limit, many students are pushed out of sections at popular times.
The increasing demand of students for Asian Languages merits attention and
accomodation.
• After a COP meeting with TAs, the economics department assigned another TA
to the 120 student class. We applaud this step in the right direction, but more
still needs to be done.
Sign the petition to reinstate TA cutbacks!
COP Update 0n...
ASSU Dorm
Reps
• ASSU Survey: Along with Dorm Reps,
we've conducted two surveys: one on
the new ASSU services initiated by
the COP, and another on the ASSU
Speakers' Bureau and Sunday Flicks.
We've learned that the new services
were a big hit, and with your input
these services will be even better
next quarter. We'll publish the results
from both surveys 500n...
• Expanding Student Representation:
This week the COP will have Dorm
Reps meetings on the Row, in Cowcll
Cluster and Mirrielees, and in
Governor's Corner. Join us in making
the ASSU responsive to your needs.
• Taking Action on Student Issues:
Dorm Reps have asked us to organize
students to fight against TA cutbacks
and secure more Food Service
options. Over seventy students,
including many Dorm Reps, arc now
working with us on these two
important issues. Several Reps also
want to see something done.
Got the Food Service Blues?
• Does you wallet suddenly start feeling very light when you throw away
seven uneaten meals off your mealcard every week?
• Do your arteries start hardening just looking at a turkey meal that has
69% of its calories coming from fat?
• Do you sometimes get the feeling that something is not quite right
when you pay $9 for $1.50 worth of food?
• Do you ever look up from your $9 salad to see a 250 pound football
player shoveling down his fourth entree and think, is there justice in
the world?
• Do you ever stare at your food service meal, and ask yourself, WHY?
Well, the COP can relate, and we're doing something about it. Here's what:
Opening up communication lines with Food Service. We've met with
Jim Keeton, Director of Food Service, and let him know students' concerns. The
meeting seemed to offer promise that we would be able to have a 10-meal plan
and possibly would be able to allow students to carry over meals from week to
week.
Comparing Stanford's Food Service to other schools'. We called other
universities and found that most had much more flexible meal plans. The cost of
the food service was generally comparable, but students at other schools received
more for their money.
Tresidder accepting meal cards? We thought it was a good idea too.
Tresidder officials seem very interested in the possibility of allowing students to
use meal cards at Tresidder, and are willing to work something out with food
service. Stay tuned.
Involving students. Two students have been appointed to the Food Service
Advisory Committee. Over 40 others have attended our meetings. Dorm reps have
also contributed suggestions and let their dorms know what's going on.
What's Happening Now?
• Campus-wide Food Service Survey. Look for it and PLEASE fill it out. It's
something very near and dear to everyone's heart-FOOD!
• Investigation of financial implications is underway. How much is
carrying over meals and having a 10-meal option going to cost us, and
is it worth it?
We're having a meeting!! TODAY at 12 novn in Paloma Lounge. WE WANT YOU!
Please come!

COMMITTEE OF THE WEEK
WHO MAKES THE DECISIONS
ABOUT $$$ AT STANFORD?
The TRUSTEE'S COMMITTEE ON FINANCE AND
ADMINSTRATION is responsible to the Board of
Trustees relating to fiscal and general business
management of the University (with the exeption of
those matters delegated to other committees).
Last year the committee made recommendations for
University budget adjustments, campus construction
and Overseas Studies programs.
This year the committee discussed the budget
shortfall and included among their recommendations
the new student residences telephone system, the
leasing of a facility in Kyoto, Japan, the 8% tuition
increase and the postponing of new dorm construction
for 5-7 years.
If you have an interest in any of the issues being
dealt with by the committee this year, you can contact
the student members of the committee.
