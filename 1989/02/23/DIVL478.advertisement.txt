$25,000 SCHOLARSHIPS:
THE FAST TRACK TO SUCCESS.
Two-year NROTC scholarships offer tuition and other
financial benefits worth as much as $25,000 to qualified
college sophomores.
All these benefits are provided for one purpose: to educate
and train qualified young men and women to serve as
commissioned officers in the Navy.
The Navy pays for tuition, textbooks, instructional fees, and
gives you an allowance of $100 a month for up to 20 months
during your last two years of college. Upon graduation and
completion of requirements, you'll become an important part of
the Navy adventure as a Navy officer.
Call your Navy representative for more information on this
challenging and rewarding program.
