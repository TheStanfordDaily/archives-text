"EARTHQUAKES ENGINEERING -
CAN IT HELP OS SAVE LIVES?"
by
Professor Haresh C. Shah
The John M. Bloom Professor of Engineering*
Chairman, Department of Civil Engineering
Why are there so many casualties after even a moderate size
earthquake in some parts of the world? Can we have similar fate if an
earthquake of moderate to large size occurs in the Bay Area? We will
explore the role of the earthquake engineering is saving lives and
reducing economic losses.
