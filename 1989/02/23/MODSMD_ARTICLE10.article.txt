# Congress challenges Bush on Tower
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee and other
Democrats yesterday challenged
President Bush's assessment that
an FBI report on John Tower had
"gunned down" allegations
against the defense secretary
designate.
"I did not agree with the pres
ident's assessment of this latest
segment of the FBI report. The
president's entitled to his view but
I think most people reading that
would not come to that same con
clusion," said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-
Ga., after he chaired a three-hour,
closed-door session of the commit
tee.
Nunn said the panel is waiting
for more material from the White
House on the embattled nomina
tion as well as a transcript from
a separate investigation that a
House subcommittee is conduct
ing into alleged security lapses in
the arms control delegation in
Geneva in 1986 while Tower was
a member.
Congressional sources said the
subcommittee heard testimony
yesterday from a former secretary
to the arms control delegation who
said that before her subcommittee
appearance, she felt she was in
timidated by White House staff.
Deborah Baker told the panel
that on Tuesday she met with
White House staff who stressed
that Tower was the president's
nominee and emphasized to her
the serious implications of her tes
timony, said the sources, who re
quested anonymity.
Baker served as secretary to
retired Air Force Lt. Col. Robert
Moser, whose request for a De

partment of Energy security
clearance is part of the subcom
mittee's inquiry.
Calls to Baker, who is employed
at the White House, were not im
mediately returned.
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.,
chairman of the subcommittee,
told reporters afterward he was
"particularly troubled that there
appears to have been an attempt
made to limit the testimony of
one of the witnesses to the com
mittee."
The panel also heard testimony
yesterday from Berne Indahl, a
State Department Security officer
who had been sent to Geneva in
1986 to investigate allegations of
security breaches in the U.S. del
egation.
An Office of Personnel Manage
ment review of Moser's request
for the DOE security clearance
included allegations that Tower
kept both his secretaries in
Geneva as mistresses, said the
sources.
Indahl on Sunday corroborated
the review, including the charges
against Tower, the sources said.
Nunn said the committee will
meet again in executive session
today and decide whether to vote
on the nomination. "It is my hope
and I am sure it is Senator
Warner's hope that we can vote
tomorrow afternoon," Nunn said.
Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.,
said he thought Bush was being
"overly generous" in his charac
terization of the FBI report.
And even the ranking Republi
can on the committee, John
Warner of Virginia, said, "reason
able men and women could look
at these stated facts and have dif

ferences of opinion."
At least one Democrat said he
will vote against the nomination,
citing his concerns about Tower's
drinking habits.
"I've made a decision, not
withstanding the expertise of
John Tower on defense matters,

that after careful consideration
it's my considered judgment that
we should look elsewhere for a
secretary of defense," Sen. James
Exon, D-Neb., told reporters.
"Therefore I will be voting no."
Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo. 112 said
he was "deeply skeptical."
