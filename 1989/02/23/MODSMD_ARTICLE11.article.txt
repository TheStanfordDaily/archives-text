LOS ANGELES (AP) - Bobby
McFerrin won four Grammys, in
cluding three for his celebratory
"Don't Worry, Be Happy," edging
Tracy Chapman's downhearted
"Fast Car" for record and song
of the year at the 31st annual
Grammy Awards last night.
"I'm just sort of numb right
now," McFerrin, 38, said back
stage after accepting the top
record-of-the-year Grammy. Of
his song, he added, "I think it's
a very serious song because I take
my happiness very seriously."
Chapman's debut recording
won her three awards, including
best new artist, best female pop
vocal performance for the single
"Fast Car" and best contemporary
folk recording for the album,
"Tracy Chapman."
After winning the top award,
McFerrin addressed Chapman
and others, saying, "This is really
not a gauge of artistic ability by
any means."
Chapman's work, largely dwell
ing on poverty and desperation,

earned her six nominations while
McFerrin's generally upbeat
music, including the "Don't Wor
ry" single, earned him five.
Some critics picked Chapman
to sweep but it was McFerrin's
music combined with a surprise
win by crossover pop star George
Michael, who won album of the
year for his "Faith" LP, that
prevented Chapman's dominance.
McFerrin won record, song and
best male pop vocal for "Don't
Worry," and took best male jazz
vocal performance for the song
"Brothers."
"I want to thank my family â€”
my mother, who bought me my
first guitar, my sister, who's al
ways been my best audience, best
critic and best friend," Chapman
said tearfully as she accepted the
female pop vocalist trophy.
Three of McFerrin's five
nominations were for "Don't Wor
ry, Be Happy," an a cappella tune
offering simple advice for dealing
with daily strife.
"I think it was so popular be

cause it went to the spirit,"
McFerrin said backstage. "I think,
given the mood at the time, it
was such that people wanted
something uplifting and jovial and
funny. The tempo was nice."
Jazz singer Anita Baker took
best rhythm & blues song and
best R&B female vocal perform
ance for "Giving You The Best
That I Got." She shared the
songwriting award with Skip
Scarborough and Randy Holland.
The vocal group Manhattan
Transfer spoiled the Beach Boys'
hopes for their first Grammy
when "Brasil" won over the surf
group's "Kokomo" for best group
pop performance.
In the rap category, which was
hit by a boycott by some of the
mj\jor nominees, the best song
was "Parents Just Don't Under
stand" by D.J. Jazzy Jeff & The
Fresh Prince, who were among
those not attending the show be
cause the award was given during
the pre-telecast presentations.
