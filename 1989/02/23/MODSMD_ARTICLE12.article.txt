FBI breaks nationwide drug ring
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Authorities charged at
least 33 people and a corporation yesterday with
laundering more than $500 million in Colombian
cocaine profits through jewelry merchants in Los
Angeles, Texas, Florida and New York.
The 13-month drug money-laundering investi
gation was the biggest of its kind ever undertaken
by the government, Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh and Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady said in a statement released in Washington.
Some of those taken into custody were expected
to be arraigned yesterday afternoon in connection
with the case, described in U.S. District Court
documents as a four-year conspiracy involving
wholesale jewelry dealers.
The documents said that in addition to arrests
on the money-laundering charges, the investiga
tion resulted in the seizure of 640 pounds of
cocaine.
Code-named Polar Cap, the investigation un
covered an operation that in the past two years
alone laundered an estimated minimum of $1
billion, the Justice and Treasury departments
said.

The federal court documents, totaling over 400
pages, said the conspiracy involved bank accounts
in New York, Panama, Uruguay and elsewhere.
Authorities alleged the defendants, many of
them family groups, packed their cocaine
proceeds in boxes and shipped them between the
jewelry stores in New York, Houston and Los
Angeles.
Freighter crew killed in storm
LONDON (AP) — A Panamanian-registered
freighter hauling a load of salt to Iceland capsized
and sank in violent seas yesterday, and all 17
crew members died, the coast guard said.
Ships, rescue planes and helicopters struggled
in vain to aid the Japanese-owned, 2,625-ton
Sescil Angola, which sank 350 miles west of Scot
land.
Squadron Leader Bob Conolly of the Royal Air
Force said crew members may have died because
they waited too long to abandon ship.
Planes and ships searched all day for survivors
from the Sescil Angola, which was carrying salt
from Spain to Iceland.
