Slavianskii Dom should
get the self-op status
Res Ed promised

This year marks the
second time Slavianskii
Dom has asked to be freed
from University Food Service and
the second time the University
has shelved the request.
In 1987, Hurlburt House got
a new name and identity. It of
ficially became Slavianskii Dom
— the Soviet and East European
studies theme house.
As part of the conversion plan,
theme house supporters argued
that Slavianskii Dom should be
come a self-op — and the Uni
versity seemed to agree.
According to Slavianskii Dom
Resident Fellow Jehanne Gheith,
Residential Education officials
were promising that as early as
1986 the house could become a
self-op once the theme change
was complete.
To ease this transition, Res Ed
and house members decided to
postpone the issue of self-op
status until this fall. So, when
fall quarter rolled around,
Slavianskii Dom residents were
putting together the proposal
that they planned to submit by
a pre-arranged November dead
line.
But what seemed to require
little more than a rubber stamp
of approval from Res Ed turned
into a major problem. Despite all
the earlier discussions, Keith
Guy, director of Housing and
Food Service, told residents that
their request was coming too late
to fit into his 1989-90 budget.
Guy cited unexpected budget
considerations and the lateness

of the house's appeal as factors
that forced him to deny the re
quest.
Unexpected problems or not, a
promise, implicit or otherwise,
was made and the University
reneged on it. The University
alienated students and lost a
chance to make a good theme
house even better.
Its conversion to a self-op
would have given students auton
omy and the right to select a
cook who would prepare meals
appropriate to the Slavic theme.
Self-op status would have also
meant an open kitchen, vital to
residents due to the house's lo
cation at the end of the Row.
An open kitchen would also al
low the house to act as a restau
rant such as the Italian House's
La Pizzeria or La Maison Fran
cais' Crepe Chouette. These
resident-run restaurants bring
students into the house, introduce
them to the house's environment
and build interest for drawing
into the house.
Students may be discouraged
from drawing into Slavianskii
Dom if it remains with Food
Service, because self-ops often of
fer better, cheaper meal plans.
Row Director Diana Conklin
has left room for some hope. Al
though Slavianskii Dom can not
become a self-op next year, stu
dents will confer with Food Serv
ice to see what temporary im
provements can be made.
Though the University
deserves credit for making some
inroads into solving the problems
of its newest academic theme
house, it has yet to face the real
issue of the house's battle for
self-op status. Maybe next year,
Slavianskii Dom.
