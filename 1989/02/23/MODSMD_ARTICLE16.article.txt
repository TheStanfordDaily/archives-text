## The 						voice of the right 
### 
PETER THIEL, editor in chief of
The Stanford Review, is puzzled
by the reaction that his monthly
paper gets in the Stanford community.
"The reactions are so extreme . . . some
people think we're totally right, right on
everything, and others think that we are
completely wrong," he says.
Well, that's the price The Review pays
for being the only voice of organized con
servatism on the Stanford campus. Thiel
started The Review in June of 1987, put
ting it together in his dorm room with
the help of a high school friend, Norm
Book, who is now managing editor of the
paper. They published four issues last
year. This year they plan to publish seven.
Thiel says that he started the paper
because he felt there were a number of
issues on which not all sides of the
campus debate were being heard. The
Reagan Library was one such issue. The
Review was founded partly to give voice
to the large number of individuals at
Stanford who supported the library.
Along with presenting the "other side"
of campus debate by challenging the per
ceived liberal orthodoxy of campus
politics, The Review tries to bring up
issues that people do not usually think
about. Take ROTC as an example.
Stanford students who for financial or
patriotic reasons want to participate in
ROTC have to go far off campus to do
so. It's an issue that affects a lot of
students; yet the last time Stanford
debated it was a decade ago, and The
Stanford Daily has, to the best of my
knowledge, not covered the story in the
past four years. In December, The Stan

ford Review did cover the story — and,
hopefully, their coverage will spark some
discussion.
Although The Stanford Review often
gets put into the same category with The
Dartmouth Review and other conserva
tive college papers, such stereotyping is
unfair. I've read a lot of "alternative"
papers, and the Stanford Review is far
more responsible — and in many ways,
far better — than most of its brethren.
The Review's editorial policy is to avoid
both the ad hominem attacks and sar
castic style that have brought the
Dartmouth paper notoriety. Book puts it
this way: "We find it a better policy to
confront ideas and deal with those rather
than attack people."
Nonetheless, people who feel them
selves targeted by The Review, such as
Anthropology Prof. Renato Rosaldo, ques
tion its motives. Rosaldo responded to a
November article that criticized his new
"Europe and the Americas," this year's
experimental Area One course, by accus
ing Review reporters of "verbal mug
ging-
Thiel dismisses such accusations,
claiming that The Review's detractors
very rarely disagree with the facts in a
Review article; rather, he says "People
get wedded to their interpretation," and
confuse differences of opinion with inac
curacy.
Indeed, this difference of interpretation
is often what sets The Review off from
The Daily. Both papers did a story on
the "Europe and the Americas" course

in November, for example, but they
tackled completely different issues. To
The Daily, the issue was "how are stu
dents and faculty members responding
to the new class?" whereas to The
Review, the issue was "does this course
have intellectual integrity?"
Neither approach is "right." Pragmati
cally, the fact that we have access to a
plurality of sources for news and inter
pretation makes us a richer and healthier
campus.
The paper itself is healthy. The
Review's 40 staffers distribute 12,000
copies of each issue. The production of
the paper has gotten cleaner, and the
quality of writing has improved. With
fewer sensational issues — like the
Reagan Library or Western Culture —
The Review is hunting harder for stories
and presenting a more interesting and
less predictable face to its readership.
It's also becoming economically self
sufficient. The Review now raises 50 per
cent of its budget from advertising.
But to Thiel, people's reactions to the
paper provide the biggest indicator of
success. "Last year we were ignored," he
says with a smile. "This year, we have
not been ignored."
