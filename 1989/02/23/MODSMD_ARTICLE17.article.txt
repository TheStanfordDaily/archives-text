## Relief is needed soon for famine raging in the Sudan 
### 
FOUR YEARS AGO I was a mem
ber of a group at a Canadian
university working on a famine
relief project for Ethiopia. Toward the
end of the project, when I sat at a
table soliciting donations, I realized
that people were tired of hearing about
the famine and seeing images of
emaciated, dying people on their televi
sion screens.
As a consequence, they were not as
inclined to open their wallets as they
had been months earlier. Their reaction
was dismaying but understandable;
horrifying events can seem almost
commonplace when we are exposed to
information about them for a sustained
period of time. Moreover, when there
is not an obvious and quick remedy to

a problem which appears chronic or
cyclical, people are often less inclined
to give assistance.
However, the reality remains that in
parts of the world, crisis periods do
occur in which people suffer and die in
great number unless immediate assis
tance is made available. We lose our
humanity when we stop being appalled
by, and willing to react positively to,
crises of such devastating proportions.
While long term solutions to condi
tions giving rise to famine must con
tinually be sought, in the short term
we are morally compelled to do what
we can to ease the agony of a popula
tion facing starvation.
The southern Sudan is presently
experiencing such a crisis. Droughts,

floods, civil war and locusts have all
contributed to famine and the spread
of diseases. At one relief camp alone
workers stated last September that
more than 3,000 people had starved to
death in the preceding three months;
at food collections points in southern

Sudan it is reported that no child
under the age of two survived this
past summer.
Stanford's African Students' Associa
tion is presently conducting a drive for
the donation of blankets and funds, to
be transported via airlift to the Sudan
on March Ist. These donations will be
distributed within the Sudan.
Let's hope that midterm exams and
everyday concerns do not prevent
members of the Stanford community
from being moved by, and responding
generously to, the plight of a popula
tion suffering to an extent which we,
living in a wealthy industrialized na
tion, are incapable of even imagining.
