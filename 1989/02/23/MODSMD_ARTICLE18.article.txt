# Inviting Rushdie to speak on campus may irk Moslems
## 
### 
The 12 Stanford professors urging
the University to vigorously support
author Salman Rushdie suggest that
Khomeini's antics obligate us to do
this.
It seems to me that there is some
thing seriously wrong with this argu
ment. Just because someone like
Khomeini disagrees with, and wants to
kill, this author, it does not follow that
we have to support the author.
I am not saying that Rushdie has
done anything wrong; I can hardly say
that since I have not read the book.
But then, neither has the author of
yesterday's letter, History Prof. Harold
Kahn, and at least one of the
proponents, English Prof. Ronald Reb
holz.
However, given that a good portion

of the world's Muslims have taken
offense, I think we should be gracious
enough to acknowledge the possibility
that the book may be a malignant as
sault on an ethnic group, rather than
a scholarly work. Of course I am not
suggesting that the book be pulled
from the shelves — the First Amend
ment is sacred — however an official
invitation to Rushdie would imply that
Stanford supports his opinion.
Let me put this another way: if
Khomeini took offense at a publication
of the Ku Klux Klan, would we extend
a cordial invitation to the author?
Before Stanford decides to support
Rushdie, it should be established by
those who know something about Is
lam, whether the work offers any
legitimate grounds for offense.
If the idea is just to protest against
Khomeini, I am sure there are better
ways which will not involve the risk of
affronting Muslims here and elsewhere.
