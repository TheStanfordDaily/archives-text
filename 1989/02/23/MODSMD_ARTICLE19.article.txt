# More cross-cultural personal relations should be fostered

### 
As a Stanford parent and alumna
and concerned human being, I have
read in The Daily this year of incidents
which allegedly reflect racial dishar
mony on campus and of various efforts
to combat this problem. It occurred to
me that further steps in maximizing
the potential of all Stanford students
could be taken on a one-to-one basis.
Specifically, students who classify
themselves as black, hispanic or Native
American could sign up to be partners
for the year with students who classify
themselves as white.
The pairs of partners could have a
meal and conversation together every
two weeks at one or the other's dorm,
apartment or fraternity. Each could
gain insight into the other's perspec
tive. Some acquaintances would lead to

friendships. The increased empathy and
communication would lead to under
standing and appreciation of each
other.
Stanford parents, too, might want to
have a chance to get acquainted on a
cross-racial basis. A perfect opportunity
would be Parents' Weekend, October
20-22. Local parents could host out-of
town parents for dinner, white parents
hosting their black counterparts, black
parents hosting white.
Parents who live in the vicintiy of
Stanford and who would like to host
should call Debbie Duncan, organizer
of Parents' Weekend, in the Develop
ment Office. Her number is 725-4264
or 725-4292. As this would be the first
year such an event would be included
in Parents' Weekend, questions and
comments would be useful and appreci
ated.
Let us enrich ourselves maximally
from the unique human resources and
cultural environment which exist and
flourish at Stanford.
