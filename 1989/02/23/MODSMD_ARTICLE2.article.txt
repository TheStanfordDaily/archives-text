# Kennedy proposes environment core

### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
A new course sequence in envi
ronmental studies may be devel
oped at Stanford within a year,
if faculty members heed the
wishes of University President
Donald Kennedy.
The interdisciplinary track
Kennedy is pushing is still on the
drawing boards, but faculty from
both social and natural science
departments appear to support
the idea in its preliminary stages.
A unified three-quarter se
quence of classes touching on the
scientific and social angles of en
vironmental policy planning
would encapsulate the field of en
vironmental studies, currently
scattered among at least 10 Uni
versity departments.
Kennedy is concerned that by
thus splitting up the discipline,
students often miss out on what
he considers to be one of today's
most important areas of study.
Presently, students have to do
"very careful shopping" to build
a cohesive program of environ
mental studies, Kennedy said.
"Peter Raven (once on the Stan
ford faculty, now secretary of the
National Academy of Sciences)
said environmental studies ought

to be just as much a requirement
for every student in the country
as Cultures, Ideas and Values,"
Kennedy said. "I don't know
about that, but it is such an im
portant part of not just scientific
literacy but political literacy for
this day and age."
Kennedy said although the en
vironmental awareness level at
Stanford is higher than at most
comparable universities, students
would benefit from a more visible,
comprehensive program present
ing the scientific information and
social issues involved in environ
mental policy planning.
To accomplish this, Kennedy
has started to hammer out a
three-class sequence aimed at
teaching students environmental
literacy over the course of a year.
Plans are still rough and open
to discussion, but Kennedy's pro
posed course would include one
quarter of geology and physical
sciences, a quarter focusing on bi
ological and ecological relation
ships and a quarter studying
human settlement and the politi
cal economy of environmental
policy.
Kennedy, a former biology pro
fessor at Stanford, has found early
praise for his interdisciplinary
brainchild from Biological
Sciences Chair Philip Hanawalt
and several other faculty mem
bers.
"As science evolves, the tradi
tional boundaries of physics,
chemistry and biology become ar
tificial boundaries," Hanawalt
said. "But intellectual under
standing of phenomena knows no
boundaries. It's important to be
able to set up programs that cross
these boundaries."
According to Kennedy, the
course would not be required but
could possibly fulfill the natural
sciences and social processes dis
tribution requirements (DR:7 and
DR:S).
All faculty members contacted
by The Daily supported the con
cept of such an environmental
literacy course, but most said
more discussion is needed before
any program is developed.
Civil Engineering Prof. Gilbert
Masters, who teaches a class on
environmental science and tech
nology focusing on pollution and
energy consumption, said the pro

posal is a good idea but in its
preliminary stage overemphasizes
the biological side of environmen
tal issues.
"Representing the engineers
dealing with the pollution side of
environmental questions, I feel
somewhat left out," Masters said.
"I hope he (Kennedy) doesn't
overlook the fact that pollution is
what people are most concerned
about."
Junior Greg Cumberford, co
organizer of the recent "You Can
Make a Difference" conference on
environmental issues, said Ken
nedy's proposal is a step in the
right direction.
"We need something that does
for our relationship to the natural
world what Western Culture does
for the history of ideas," Cum
berford said.
Kennedy said he is not con
cerned with developing a degree
program in the subject right now.
He also did not specify a depart
ment or existing program which
would incorporate his proposed
course.
Anthropology Assoc. Prof. Bill
Durham, who teaches a human
biology course in ecological an
thropology, called Kennedy's pro
posal "a terrific idea whose time

has come."
"It would provide a thread to
sew together the bits and pieces
we offer now," Durham said. "We
do tend to be scattered now â€”
we lack a community of discus
sion."
Hanawalt said he was "enthu
siastic at this kind of initiative"
on the part of the administration
and that the proposal is "certainly
not premature ... it might even
be tardy."
Although money is tight in the
University right now and funding
might be an obstacle to the
course's development, Kennedy
said he is confident the barriers
can be overcome.
"The faculty members most
likely to be interested in this are
already stretched thin," Kennedy
admitted. "But it's something we
could raise some money for. I'm
ready to help. In fact, it's a course
I'd like to teach in."
Kennedy has not written a for
mal proposal for the course and
said that, for now, he is just
"trying to get the right kinds of
conversations started." But he
added that if discussion and plan
ning begin soon, the proposed
course or a similar one could be
in place by fall of 1990.
