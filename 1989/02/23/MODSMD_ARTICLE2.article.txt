# Kennedy proposes environment core

A new course sequence in envi
ronmental studies may be devel
oped at Stanford within a year,
if faculty members heed the
wishes of University President
Donald Kennedy.
The interdisciplinary track
Kennedy is pushing is still on the
drawing boards, but faculty from
both social and natural science
departments appear to support
the idea in its preliminary stages.
A unified three-quarter se
quence of classes touching on the
scientific and social angles of en
vironmental policy planning
would encapsulate the field of en
vironmental studies, currently
scattered among at least 10 Uni
versity departments.
Kennedy is concerned that by
thus splitting up the discipline,
students often miss out on what
he considers to be one of today's
most important areas of study.
Presently, students have to do
"very careful shopping" to build
a cohesive program of environ
mental studies, Kennedy said.
"Peter Raven (once on the Stan
ford faculty, now secretary of the
National Academy of Sciences)
said environmental studies ought

to be just as much a requirement
for every student in the country
as Cultures, Ideas and Values,"
Kennedy said. "I don't know
about that, but it is such an im
portant part of not just scientific
literacy but political literacy for
this day and age."
Kennedy said although the en
vironmental awareness level at
Stanford is higher than at most
comparable universities, students
would benefit from a more visible,
comprehensive program present
ing the scientific information and
social issues involved in environ
mental policy planning.
To accomplish this, Kennedy
has started to hammer out a
three-class sequence aimed at
teaching students environmental
literacy over the course of a year.
Plans are still rough and open
to discussion, but Kennedy's pro
posed course would include one
quarter of geology and physical
sciences, a quarter focusing on bi
ological and ecological relation
ships and a quarter studying
human settlement and the politi
cal economy of environmental
policy.
