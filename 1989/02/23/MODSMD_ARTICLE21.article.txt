## Sanctions are working, now Bush can make them stronger 
### 
LAST MONTH Americans cele
brated Martin Luther King Jr.'s
birthday and the beginning of
George Bush's administration and the
101st Congress. This juxtaposition of
events serves to remind us of the work
the U.S. government has yet to ac
complish in extending civil rights —
particularly to South Africa.
Bush's mentor, Ronald Reagan,
supported trade and military exchange
with the apartheid regime in the failed
policy of "constructive engagement"
and the result has been more repres
sions: a state of emergency in its third
year, and countless suffering.
It is clear that the continued foreign
support and tolerance of apartheid
have done nothing to feed or free the
26 million South Africans not included
in the government or businesses of
South Africa. An estimated 30,000
citizens are political prisoners — often
held without charge — and 40 percent
of these prisoners are children. Black
unemployment is at 40 percent. Three

in five black children die before age
five, most due to malnutrition and
inadequate and segregated health care.
Worst of all, the myriad indigenous
attempts at political reforms have been
made illegal by the South African
government. On Feb. 24, 1988, 18
democratic institutions and their
leaders were "banned."
It is now illegal for them to meet,
call for changes in government policy,
publish, call for strikes or worker
stay-aways or other economic actions,
request the release of detainees, con
duct press interviews or call for their
own re-legalization.
On Dec. 29, 1988 four additional
local teachers' unions and student
groups were banned — bringing the
total to 30 banned groups in 1988.
Our former president left office in the
embarrassing position of having con
demned the "state of emergency" in
Poland (which we call martial law)
that will soon recognize the Solidarity
Union, while having simultaneously

allied himself with the South African
"state of emergency" that bans unions
as quickly as they form.
It is clear what steps the U.S. gov
ernment and citizens can take against
apartheid. On Jan. 12, the Rev. Allan
Boesak told a full house at Stanford's
Bishop Memorial Auditorium that
apartheid will fall if westerners enact
three economic sanctions against South
Africa: boycott South African gold,
boycott air travel to and from South
Africa and refuse to reschedule debt
payments on loans to South Africa.
Many other South African leaders,
such as Bishop Desmond Tutu, Rev.
Frank Chikane and representative
institutions such as the Congress of
South African Trade Unions, the
United Democratic Front and the
African National Congress, have also
called for trade sanctions.
Given the structure of the South
African economy, in which blacks own
virtually nothing and are already in
poverty, whites are making money both

from cheap labor and from expending
almost nothing on social services for
blacks.
The obvious strategy to dismantle
apartheid is to take the profit out of
it. International economic sanctions
would hurt the 'janking and mec
hanized industries the most because
they require foreign capital, which
would affect far more white workers
than black workers.
The good news is that even the
modest sanctions enacted in 1986 are
beginning to take effect. An estimated
$10 billion has left South Africa since
1985, economic growth has slowed to
2.7 percent in 1988, and the gold
component of the South African
Reserve Bank has dropped $258 mil
lion, to $1.2 billion.
We know the American people abhor
apartheid, and few would personally
like to profit from the inhuman condi
tions of blacks in South Africa. If you
would like to see apartheid end, please

express your support for a U.S. pull
out.
Last year, Sen. Alan Cranston and
Rep. Ron Dellums authored a compre
hensive trade sanctions bill which
passed the House but was not consid
ered by the Senate. A good fresh start
for the new president and new
Congress would be to enact this bill.
We hope George Bush has learned
from the failures of the Reagan admin
istration and will sign the bill into law.
We also hope he will use his political
muscle to encourage Britain and Japan,
South Africa's largest trading partners,
to adopt sanctions as well.

101st Congress. This juxtaposition of
events serves to remind us of the work
the U.S. government has yet to ac
complish in extending civil rights —
particularly to South Africa.
Bush's mentor, Ronald Reagan,
supported trade and military exchange
with the apartheid regime in the failed
policy of "constructive engagement"
and the result has been more repres
sions: a state of emergency in its third
year, and countless suffering.
It is clear that the continued foreign
support and tolerance of apartheid
have done nothing to feed or free the
26 million South Africans not included
in the government or businesses of
South Africa. An estimated 30,000
citizens are political prisoners — often
held without charge — and 40 percent
of these prisoners are children. Black
unemployment is at 40 percent. Three

in five black children die before age
five, most due to malnutrition and
inadequate and segregated health care.
Worst of all, the myriad indigenous
attempts at political reforms have been
made illegal by the South African
government. On Feb. 24, 1988, 18
democratic institutions and their
leaders were "banned."
It is now illegal for them to meet,
call for changes in government policy,
publish, call for strikes or worker
stay-aways or other economic actions,
request the release of detainees, con
duct press interviews or call for their
own re-legalization.
On Dec. 29, 1988 four additional
local teachers' unions and student
groups were banned — bringing the
total to 30 banned groups in 1988.
Our former president left office in the
embarrassing position of having con
demned the "state of emergency" in
Poland (which we call martial law)
that will soon recognize the Solidarity
Union, while having simultaneously

allied himself with the South African
"state of emergency" that bans unions
as quickly as they form.
It is clear what steps the U.S. gov
ernment and citizens can take against
apartheid. On Jan. 12, the Rev. Allan
Boesak told a full house at Stanford's
Bishop Memorial Auditorium that
apartheid will fall if westerners enact
three economic sanctions against South
Africa: boycott South African gold,
boycott air travel to and from South
Africa and refuse to reschedule debt
payments on loans to South Africa.
Many other South African leaders,
such as Bishop Desmond Tutu, Rev.
Frank Chikane and representative
institutions such as the Congress of
South African Trade Unions, the
United Democratic Front and the
African National Congress, have also
called for trade sanctions.
Given the structure of the South
African economy, in which blacks own
virtually nothing and are already in
poverty, whites are making money both

from cheap labor and from expending
almost nothing on social services for
blacks.
The obvious strategy to dismantle
apartheid is to take the profit out of
it. International economic sanctions
would hurt the 'janking and mec
hanized industries the most because
they require foreign capital, which
would affect far more white workers
than black workers.
The good news is that even the
modest sanctions enacted in 1986 are
beginning to take effect. An estimated
$10 billion has left South Africa since
1985, economic growth has slowed to
2.7 percent in 1988, and the gold
component of the South African
Reserve Bank has dropped $258 mil
lion, to $1.2 billion.
We know the American people abhor
apartheid, and few would personally
like to profit from the inhuman condi
tions of blacks in South Africa. If you
would like to see apartheid end, please

express your support for a U.S. pull
out.
Last year, Sen. Alan Cranston and
Rep. Ron Dellums authored a compre
hensive trade sanctions bill which
passed the House but was not consid
ered by the Senate. A good fresh start
for the new president and new
Congress would be to enact this bill.
We hope George Bush has learned
from the failures of the Reagan admin
istration and will sign the bill into law.
We also hope he will use his political
muscle to encourage Britain and Japan,
South Africa's largest trading partners,
to adopt sanctions as well.
