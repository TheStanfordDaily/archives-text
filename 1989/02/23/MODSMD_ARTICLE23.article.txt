## Vlahov mixes it up 'down under' the boards 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
For once and for all, Andrew
Vlahov is not a football player.
"Football's too slow," the 6-
foot-7, 225-pound sophomore
says. "Too much bashing each
other around for no reason."
Make no mistake, Vlahov does
his share of bashing. He's one of
the fiercest competitors on Stan
ford's men's basketball team,
which takes on Oregon tonight in
Eugene at 7:30 p.m.
"As hard as he plays, it feeds
on the other players on the court,"
teammate Howard Wright says.
"We've beaten some teams before
when we've outworked them, and
Andrew Vlahov epitomizes that."
But opposing coaches and fans
take one look at the Rock of
Vlahov and immediately decide he
belongs in the NFL. Oh, he's from
Australia? Then he belongs on a
rugby field.
"That doesn't bother me at all,"
Vlahov says. "[My body's] more
suited to football, but big deal. I
chose to play basketball."
It was one of his better choices.
By picking basketball, Vlahov is
helping Stanford get to the NCAA
tournament. The starting small
forward, or three-man, on the
Cardinal since the season's sixth
game, Vlahov is averaging 5.8
points, 3.8 rebounds and 3.0 as
sists per game in 1988-89.
Selecting basketball over foot
ball also got Vlahov a trip to Seoul.
Vlahov was a backup on
Australia's Olympic Team, which
was ranked only 13th going into
the 1988 Summer Olympics but
ended up fourth after losing to

the United States in the bronze
metal game.
"I had a great time, probably
the best experience in my life,"
Vlahov says."It fulfilled one of
the main ambitions in my life."
Vlahov gained an immeasure
able amount of experience by play
ing against and watching some of
the best amateur players in the
world. In fact, the only problem
that it posed was making it hard
for Vlahov to get the international
game out of his system.
One example was a game in
January at Washington. Vlahov
looked like a hero after making a
3-pointer in the final minute to
give Stanford a 69-67 lead over
the Huskies.
But it seemed like Vlahov would
be fitted for the dunce cap when
Stanford got the ball back with
the game tied at 69, and Vlahov
fired up a 30-foot desperation shot
that missed badly — with several
seconds left.
The reason: according to inter
national rules, the clock starts
ticking immediately after the ref
eree hands the player the ball out
of bounds, but in the NCAA, the
clock doesn't start until the ball
is inbounded.
"It was just a stupid thing for
me to do," Vlahov says.
The transition from Australia
to America has had rough mo
ments like that for Vlahov.
Wright says that as tough as it
is adjusting to Stanford, it was
particularly tough on Vlahov. The
main similarity between the two
cultures for Vlahov was basket
ball, and Vlahov was plagued even
in that area with loose cartilage
in his knee last year.

"I think we're starting to see
the true Andrew Vlahov this
year," Wright says.
Vlahov seems to agree.
"It's a lot better," he says.
"Now that my knee's healed up,
I can play what I want to play. . . .
It's helped me off the court too;
I'm doing pretty good at school.
I'm pretty happy really."
According to Todd Lichti, a
roommate this year, Vlahov is
nothing if not well-adjusted.
"He's great; he's so easy to get
along with," Lichti says."He
keeps us loose, keeps life exciting,
keeps it fun. He's a great friend
of mine, someone I can confide
in. He has a great loyalty for

friends."
Obviously, that loyalty is
mutual. In that game at Wash
ington, Lichti rebounded Vlahov's
shot and put in the game-winner.
As a result, Vlahov ended up
being a role player in that win,
which is his job this year. With
potential NBA draftees Lichti and
Wright on the Cardinal, Vlahov
mainly fills the gaps, picking up
the slack. He's excelled in that,
achieving career highs in points
(12), rebounds(nine) and as
sists(seven). He is considered to
be the best passing forward on
the team.


Dan Ledford — Daily file
Stanford forward Andrew Vlahov, the Cardinal's most versatile
player, should see his minutes increase next year.
But after six seniors graduate
in 1989, Vlahov will assume center
stage for Stanford.
"I'll probably be the guy that's
the most senior of the lot, as far
as minutes played go," Vlahov
says. "I'm looking forward to the
next couple of years, to the chal
lenge."
"With the seniors leaving he'll
definitely need to increase his of
fensive output," Lichti says.
After that challenge will come
another. Vlahov plans on return
ing to his native Australia and
playing in the leagues there.
"Basketball in Australia is
really booming," he says. "It's out
of control."
Until he graduates, Vlahov will
still probably be considered by
outsiders to be a more likely can
didate for Australian rules foot
ball than basketball. But he's got
plenty of basketball left in him
now, and should have plenty left
in him then.
