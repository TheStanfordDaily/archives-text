# Stanford at Oregon
## 
### 
TONIGHT - KZSU (90.1 FM), KCBS (740 AM). 7:30 p.m. tipoff in Eugene.
RECORDS — Stanford (21-5, 11-3 and 2nd in Pacific 10 Conference),
Oregon (8-16, 3-11 and tied for Bth in the Pac-10.)
SERIES — Recently: Series has been split last three seasons. Last game:
Howard Wright had a double-double (19 points, 10 rebounds) as Stanford
won 75-53 Jan. 26. Last game at McArthur Court: Three Ducks rebounded
in double figures to rally Oregon to an 80-66 win Jan. 30, 1988.
DUCK UPDATE — Oregon has lost four straight and eight of its last nine.
Frank Johnson, wpo leads Oregon with 17.1 points per game, had
scored in double figures for 21 straight games until last Thursday's loss
to Washington State. The junior guard also leads the Ducks with 5.2
rebounds per game.
CARDINAL UPDATE — Stanford is ranked 16th by AP, 17th by UPI and 14th
by USA Today/CNN. The Cardinal has won six straight and 20 of its last
23. Stanford is 7-5 on the road this season. Stanford's non-conference
opponents this season are a combined 171-104 (.622). Todd Lichtl, who
is third in the Pac-10 in scoring, trails Arizona's Sean Elliott by 118 points
in all-games career scoring but leads Elliott by 11 in conference-games
career scoring.
KEYS TO VICTORY — Stanford must be smart and patient against Oregon's
ever-changing defenses. If the Cardinal can move the ball around, it
should get a fair amount of layups. Oregon slowed the game to a crawl
at Maples, but while a calm tempo should remain, the Ducks are less
likely to stall in front of the home crowd.
