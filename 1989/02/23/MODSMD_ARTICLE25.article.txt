# Cardinal stumbles into division play
## 
### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
Last season, the Stanford Cardinal baseball
team was just hitting stride as the Pacific 10
Southern Division season opened.
Last season, a .500 Stanford club played a
three-game set against UC-Santa Barbara just
prior to the start of league play.
The Cardinal swept three from the Gauchos
and never looked back on route to its second
straight national title.
The stage was set for a similar scenario
this season.
But this time the Gauchos took two of three
and Stanford dropped another Tuesday to San
Jose State, leaving the Cardinal at 8-8 and
reeling as the competitive-as-ever Six-Pac
season looms on this weekend's horizon.
Bothered by the nagging inability to get
good pitching and good hitting to coincide,
Stanford has had to battle for each of its
eight victories.
Even more disturbing, the Cardinal has al
ready committed 37 errors in just 16 games.
Stanford had only 98 gaffes in 69 games last
year. Some simple algebra tells us that 37
errors translates to a whopping 159 miscues
in a 69-game season.
In the past, if one thing could be said about
Coach Mark Marquess' Cardinal teams, it was
that they didn't beat themselves. 1989 has
seen Stanford blow games with shoddy de
fense, something it rarely did in '87 and '88.
On the eve of this year's first Six-Pac con
test at Berkeley tomorrow, here is a progress
report on the Stanford team that will try to
defend two consecutive NCAA championhsips.
The starting nine
• Catcher: Currently the job appears to

belong to freshman Troy Tallman. He has
started the last three games and six of the
last eight.
• First base: It had been the private domain
of freshman David Holbrook, who started 12
straight games after junior Brian Johnson
could not get going at the plate. He's batting
.354 — fourth best on the team — with eight
RBI, four extra-base hits and six multiple hit
games. Johnson, who seems to have found
his eye at the plate, started at first last Sunday
and went 3-for-5 with a homer and two RBI
— he was 6-for-ll on the weekend. Holbrook
moved to DH and continued his torrid pace,
going 2-for-5 with an RBI and a triple.
• Second base: Senior Frank Carey is going
to receive notice for All-America honors. He
is hitting a torrid .400 with eight extra-base
hits, nine RBI, 20 runs scored and four stolen
bases out of the lead-off position. He has
committed four errors and leads the team
with 54 assists.
• Third base: Junior Tim Griffin has
flourished at the plate. Batting .379, Griffin
is tied for second in RBI with 11 and his five
doubles are second on the squad.
• Shortstop: Junior Troy Paulsen owns the
job, but he has suffered thus far in '89. His
average is down from .345 last season to .268,
though he does lead the team in RBI with 14.
• Left field: A smorgasbord. Freshman
Steve Solomon was given a long look in left,
and got just one hit in 21 at-bats. But last
weekend he started all three games — moving
between left and center — and went 5-for-15.
Though the jury is still out on his bat, Solomon
has yet to commit an error in the outfield
and runs everything down that comes his
way. Senior Jack Hollis started a game last
weekend and went 4-for-7 with a double and
an RBI. Johnson played here last year and

started in left Tuesday against San Jose.
• Center field: Could be Solomon. Could be
Mike Eicher, who has started the last two
games — one each in left and center. Eicher
assumed the job from returning starter Eric
DeGraw, who is batting just .111 and has not
started since Feb. 10 at Cal State-Fullerton.
DeGraw is the best defensive outfielder in the
Six-Pac. If the game is close after the sixth
and he's not already in the game, you can
bet he will be.
• Right field: Junior Paul Carey is the man.
Hitting .361 with 11 RBI and four doubles,
he is also tied for second on the club with
three steals. Carey is without a homer in '89,
but he had zero through 34 games last season
before busting loose to send 12 over the
boards.
• DH: Frosh Roger Burnett was it, but he
hit the skids after a great start. He is 4-for-26
over his last eight games. Should Johnson
continue to stay hot, Holbrook may end up in
this spot.
Pitching
• The starters: Sophomores Mike Mussina
and Stan Spencer are the stalwarts. Mussina
is coming off his first complete game of the
year last weekend against Santa Barbara. He
surrendered three earned runs on seven hits.
Mussina (1-2, 3.49) will go tomorrow at Cal.
In 28 1/3 innings of work, he has fanned 32
and walked just two. Mussina is the cream
of the crop. Spencer suffered his worst outing
of the year last weekend, lasting just three
innings and allowing five earned runs on seven
hits. Spencer (0-2, 4.09) is a solid number-two
starter and should shake off his only bad

outing of the year. He'll pitch Sat
urday against the Bears. The
third starter is now freshman
lefty Steve Worrell, who took the
spot from senior Brian Keyser.
• Relief: Ace stopper Steve
Chitren is off to a great start and
is one of the best in the country.
Chitren (1-1, 2.21) has two saves
and is coming off six innings of
shoutout ball against the Gauchos
last Sunday. Rest assured he will
pitch sometime this weekend.
Sophomore Scott Weiss struggled
last weekend, giving up two
earned runs on three hits in two
innings of work Sunday.

ready committed 37 errors in just 16 games.
Stanford had only 98 gaffes in 69 games last
year. Some simple algebra tells us that 37
errors translates to a whopping 159 miscues
in a 69-game season.
In the past, if one thing could be said about
Coach Mark Marquess' Cardinal teams, it was
that they didn't beat themselves. 1989 has
seen Stanford blow games with shoddy de
fense, something it rarely did in '87 and '88.
On the eve of this year's first Six-Pac con
test at Berkeley tomorrow, here is a progress
report on the Stanford team that will try to
defend two consecutive NCAA championhsips.
The starting nine
• Catcher: Currently the job appears to

belong to freshman Troy Tallman. He has
started the last three games and six of the
last eight.
• First base: It had been the private domain
of freshman David Holbrook, who started 12
straight games after junior Brian Johnson
could not get going at the plate. He's batting
.354 — fourth best on the team — with eight
RBI, four extra-base hits and six multiple hit
games. Johnson, who seems to have found
his eye at the plate, started at first last Sunday
and went 3-for-5 with a homer and two RBI
— he was 6-for-ll on the weekend. Holbrook
moved to DH and continued his torrid pace,
going 2-for-5 with an RBI and a triple.
• Second base: Senior Frank Carey is going
to receive notice for All-America honors. He
is hitting a torrid .400 with eight extra-base
hits, nine RBI, 20 runs scored and four stolen
bases out of the lead-off position. He has
committed four errors and leads the team
with 54 assists.
• Third base: Junior Tim Griffin has
flourished at the plate. Batting .379, Griffin
is tied for second in RBI with 11 and his five
doubles are second on the squad.
• Shortstop: Junior Troy Paulsen owns the
job, but he has suffered thus far in '89. His
average is down from .345 last season to .268,
though he does lead the team in RBI with 14.
• Left field: A smorgasbord. Freshman
Steve Solomon was given a long look in left,
and got just one hit in 21 at-bats. But last
weekend he started all three games — moving
between left and center — and went 5-for-15.
Though the jury is still out on his bat, Solomon
has yet to commit an error in the outfield
and runs everything down that comes his
way. Senior Jack Hollis started a game last
weekend and went 4-for-7 with a double and
an RBI. Johnson played here last year and

started in left Tuesday against San Jose.
• Center field: Could be Solomon. Could be
Mike Eicher, who has started the last two
games — one each in left and center. Eicher
assumed the job from returning starter Eric
DeGraw, who is batting just .111 and has not
started since Feb. 10 at Cal State-Fullerton.
DeGraw is the best defensive outfielder in the
Six-Pac. If the game is close after the sixth
and he's not already in the game, you can
bet he will be.
• Right field: Junior Paul Carey is the man.
Hitting .361 with 11 RBI and four doubles,
he is also tied for second on the club with
three steals. Carey is without a homer in '89,
but he had zero through 34 games last season
before busting loose to send 12 over the
boards.
• DH: Frosh Roger Burnett was it, but he
hit the skids after a great start. He is 4-for-26
over his last eight games. Should Johnson
continue to stay hot, Holbrook may end up in
this spot.
Pitching
• The starters: Sophomores Mike Mussina
and Stan Spencer are the stalwarts. Mussina
is coming off his first complete game of the
year last weekend against Santa Barbara. He
surrendered three earned runs on seven hits.
Mussina (1-2, 3.49) will go tomorrow at Cal.
In 28 1/3 innings of work, he has fanned 32
and walked just two. Mussina is the cream
of the crop. Spencer suffered his worst outing
of the year last weekend, lasting just three
innings and allowing five earned runs on seven
hits. Spencer (0-2, 4.09) is a solid number-two
starter and should shake off his only bad

outing of the year. He'll pitch Sat
urday against the Bears. The
third starter is now freshman
lefty Steve Worrell, who took the
spot from senior Brian Keyser.
• Relief: Ace stopper Steve
Chitren is off to a great start and
is one of the best in the country.
Chitren (1-1, 2.21) has two saves
and is coming off six innings of
shoutout ball against the Gauchos
last Sunday. Rest assured he will
pitch sometime this weekend.
Sophomore Scott Weiss struggled
last weekend, giving up two
earned runs on three hits in two
innings of work Sunday.
Last season, the Stanford Cardinal baseball
team was just hitting stride as the Pacific 10
Southern Division season opened.
Last season, a .500 Stanford club played a
three-game set against UC-Santa Barbara just
prior to the start of league play.
The Cardinal swept three from the Gauchos
and never looked back on route to its second
straight national title.
The stage was set for a similar scenario
this season.
But this time the Gauchos took two of three
and Stanford dropped another Tuesday to San
Jose State, leaving the Cardinal at 8-8 and
reeling as the competitive-as-ever Six-Pac
season looms on this weekend's horizon.
Bothered by the nagging inability to get
good pitching and good hitting to coincide,
Stanford has had to battle for each of its
eight victories.
Even more disturbing, the Cardinal has al
ready committed 37 errors in just 16 games.
Stanford had only 98 gaffes in 69 games last
year. Some simple algebra tells us that 37
