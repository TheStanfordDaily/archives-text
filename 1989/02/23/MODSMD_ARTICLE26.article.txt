# Athletes of the WeeK

### 
Ah, Stanford! Home of the basketball
teams with the best combined ranking in
the nation at 20 (Men — No. 16, Women
— No. 4). It seems obvious, then, that The
Daily's Athletes of the Week should both be
basketball players.
And, this time, it's Power Forward Week.
That must mean our winners are Trisha
Stevens and Howard Wright.
Stevens, a 6-foot-3 sophomore forward

from Philomath, Oregon, led the Cardinal
past California last Friday in Berkeley,
strengthening Stanford's hold on the top
spot in the Pacific 10 Conference and as
suring a second straight 20-win season.
Shooting 9-of-16 from the field and l-for-2
from the line, Stevens tallied a team-high
19 points. She also grabbed nine rebounds
in her 30 minutes of play.
On the season, Stevens is averaging a
healthy 11.8 points per game, one of four
Cardinal Starters averaging in double fig
ures.
Stanford is currently ranked fourth na
tionally by Associated Press, fifth by USA
Today and third by Sports Illustrated. With
a 20-2 overall record, 12-0 in the Pac-10,
the team virtually assured itself the top
seeding in the West Region in next month's
NCAA Tournament with the 87-79 win over
Cal. The victory also tied a school record
14th straight, a mark set in the middle of
last season.

Wright, a 6-8 senior from San Diego,
Calif., scored 33 points on the weekend as
No. 16 Stanford knocked off California and
USC and upped its record to 21-5.
Against the Golden Bears Thursday,
Wright slammed home two of Stanford's
many dunks on the evening. In the second
half, Wright pointed at the hoop and Scott
Meinert delivered a perfect alley-oop pass
to him.

On the night, Wright tallied 13 points on
6-of-10 shooting.
Monday, facing the Trojans on the road,
Wright had one of his best games of the
season. He scored 20 points on 7-of-8 shoot
ing from the field and 6-of-6 shooting from
the charity stripe.
Wright also blocked a career-high four
shots, grabbed six rebounds, dished out three
assists and made two steals.
