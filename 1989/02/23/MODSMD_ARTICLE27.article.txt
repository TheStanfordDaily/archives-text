# In A Class By Himself
## 
### 
Sometimes, there is an athlete
so far ahead of the rest of the
field that they merit extra special
attention. Every now and then
someone goes one step beyond
that.
Todd Lichti has.
Therefore, to honor Lichti's ac
complishments we have placed
him In A Class By Himself.
Currently, Lichti is the third
leading scoring in Pacific 10 Con
ference history with 2,209 points.
Arizona's Sean Elliott tops the
list with 2,327. If only conference
games are counted, Lichti leads
Elliott 1,279 to 1,268.
This year, the 6-foot-4 shooting
guard from Concord, Calif., is
making a strong bid for First-
Team All-America honors. Lichti
is averaging 20.6 points, 4.9
rebounds and 3.1 assists per
game. He is shooting 57 percent
from the field and a stellar 87
percent from the free-throw line.
Lichti is also making 46 percent
of his 3-point attempts.
Three times the conference has
recognized Lichti's effort by
naming him Pac-10 Player of the
Week. It seems likely that he will
become the third player in con
ference history to be a four-time
all-conference selection.
Against California last Thurs
day, Andrew Vlahov stole the ball
and passed to Lichti who was un
der the hoop with his back to the

basket. Lichti went skyward and
slammed home the first reverse
jam of his college career. On an
other occasion, the ambidextrous
wonder drove to the hoop and
stuck it to the rack left-handed.
When Elliott was recently asked
to name the best shooting guard
in the country, he replied, "It's
got to be Todd Lichti of Stan
ford. .. . He's tough."
Marty Blake, the NBA's direc
tor of scouting, projects Lichti as
a middle-first round selection in
this June's draft.
