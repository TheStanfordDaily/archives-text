# Hot spikers seek to plunder Aztecs

took Stanford to five games before
finally succumbing.
Despite repeated warnings from
the Stanford coaching staff, it
seemed as if the Cardinal players
could not convince themselves
that Northridge was a real oppon
ent. However, down 13-11 in game
five, Stanford finally realized that
the Matadors had come to play.
Now, a few days after the near
fiasco, Stanford's spikers vow
that they will never let an oppon
ent sneak up on them again.
"It seems like the guys have
really learned their lesson," asst.
coach Ruben Nieves said. "I'm
just glad that they learned in a
close victory and not in a
heartbreaking loss."
Junior hitter Dan Hanan
echoed his coach's sentiments: "I

The Stanford men's volleyball
team has taken yet another quan
tum leap forward in the past
week, adding another impressive
element to its 1989 resume. By
virtue of the team's victory at
Santa Barbara last week, the team
has jumped to No. 3 in the na
tional poll.
However, as anybody who was
on hand at Maples Pavilion last
Saturday night will attest, the
giddy streak that the Cardinal is
currently experiencing could have
easily been brought to a grinding
halt. Cal State-Northridge
stretched the powerful Cardinal
almost to the breaking point;
riding a career performance by
one Bob Samuelson, the Matadors

for us because it was so close,"
Hanan said.
"If we had won by a slightly
bigger margin, I don't think we
would have been scared by the
possibility of losing. After the
match, we had a lengthy meeting,
and a lot of guys gave their input.
We've made the necessary adjust
ments and we've had a great week
of match preparation."

ford will apparently be ready for
anything the Aztecs throw at
them tonight.
"They're a very young team,"
Nieves explained. "We've never
seen a lot of their top players. We
do know that they do not have
one dominant player like
Northridge did, however. They are
more of a balanced team."
On a night when the No. 3-

By virtue of the team's victory at Santa
Barbara last week, the team has jumped
to No. 3 in the national poll.

Referring to tonight's opponent,
San Diego State, Hanan said, "We
should be all right. We have to
get out to a fast start, though,
which is something we didn't do
against Northridge."
San Diego State is definitely
one of the Western Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association's weak
sisters, having scraped up a mere
two conference wins thus far in
1989. This meager total, though,
judging by the Stanford players'
reflections on the nightmarish
Northridge game, will not lull the
Cardinal to sleep. In fact, Stan

ranked Cardinal is looking to
redeem itself after a sub-par
showing last weekend, it will take
a lot more than "balance" to keep
SDSU in contention.
Stanford may very well ambush
the invading Aztecs; fired-up play
and focused precision could con
ceivably carry the Cardinal to a
three-game sweep of San Diego
State. The Stanford players seem
as if any other result would be
unsatisfactory.
The game gets under way at
7:30 p.m. tonight at Maples.
