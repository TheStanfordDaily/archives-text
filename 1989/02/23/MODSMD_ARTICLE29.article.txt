# Johnson (Jill, that is) strokes past opponents

### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
It is often a quick hop from the
shadows to the spotlight and Jill
Johnson, for one, is glad she made
the trip.
Johnson, a junior breaststroker
on the Cardinal women's swim
team, got shoved into the limelight
this fall, but after a short adjust
ment she's thriving.
After being in the shadow of
1988 graduate Susie Rapp, a
three-time Olympian, Johnson fi
nally got her chance to star this
season. But was she ready for it?
"I did kind of see myself as the
heir to the 200 breaststroke,"
Johnson said. Rapp won the 200-
yard breast stroke as a freshman
and as a junior and finished sec
ond her other two years.
"In the begining of the year I
really went through a great crisis
of confidence," Johnson said. "I
almost didn't want to swim. . . .
Once I started swimming in meets
though I saw how fast I was
going."
Johnson swam the 200 in two
minutes, 16.86 seconds against
Texas Feb. 4, a time .03 seconds
faster than she swam the event
to take sixth at last year's NCAA
Championships. Considering she
did not rp<?t much for the Texas
dual meet, Johnson feels she can
take a few seconds off that time
before March 18th, the day the
200 breaststroke will be swum at
this year's NCAA meet.
"Personally, my goal is to win
the 200 breast," she said, adding,
"and set an American record. The
record is 2:11.4 [actually 2:11.46,
set by Tracy Caulkins in 1980]
and I think I can take five seconds
off my time. If I set that out there
then even if I don't do it I'll still
go really fast."

Johnson began swimming at
age eight in a summer league. "I
came pretty close to breaking the
summer league records in breast
stroke," she said, and she has
stuck with that stroke ever since.
A crisis was choosing be
tween Stanford and Harvard for
college. "I really wanted to go to
Harvard," she said. "IBut] I'm
certainly glad I didn't."
Johnson came to Stanford and
found it quite to her liking. "It
was a great change," she said. "I
love collegiate swimming. It's ac
tually great to train with four
other breaststrokers who are at
least as good or better than you."
This season, however, Johnson
has usually been the Cardinal's
top gun. In addition to her suc
cesses in the 200, she also has
the team's best time in the 100
breastroke. With perhaps the four
top breaststrokers from last year
not swimming this season (Rapp
and Texas' Tracey McFarlane
graduated, Texas' Susan Johnson
retired and California's Hiroko
Nagasaki is out for the season
with an injury), Johnson has a
great chance to reach the finals
in both breaststroke events at the
NCAA meet.
And more importantly to her,
the Cardinal has a good shot at
winning the NCAA team title. She
thinks first-year Coach Richard
Quick is a part of that.
"[Practicesl are definitely more
difficult this last year," she said.
"Having half the swimmers being
freshmen helps us because they
weren't used to the old way. They
just do it.
The team is competing in the
Pacific 10 Conference Champion
ships this weekend in Cerritos,
Calif., a meet very similar to the
NCAA meet. "I think we're going

to blow some people out of the
water if we swim fast like we did
at Texas," she said.
"Other teams are going to have
a lot of people shaved and tapered
to make NCAA cuts but I don't
think we should have a problem."
Stanford scored 1545.5 points
last year, 339.5 more than
runner-up California, and the
Cardinal has been swimming con
sistently faster this season com
pared to last.
And then it's on to the NCAA
Championships in Indianapolis,
March 16-18 where the best in
the nation, and the American
record, are waiting.

which should run away with the Pacific 10 Conference Champion
ship.
It is often a quick hop from the
shadows to the spotlight and Jill
Johnson, for one, is glad she made
the trip.
Johnson, a junior breaststroker
on the Cardinal women's swim
team, got shoved into the limelight
this fall, but after a short adjust
ment she's thriving.
After being in the shadow of
1988 graduate Susie Rapp, a
three-time Olympian, Johnson fi
nally got her chance to star this
season. But was she ready for it?
"I did kind of see myself as the
heir to the 200 breaststroke,"
Johnson said. Rapp won the 200-
yard breast stroke as a freshman
and as a junior and finished sec
ond her other two years.
"In the begining of the year I
really went through a great crisis
of confidence," Johnson said. "I
almost didn't want to swim. . . .
Once I started swimming in meets
though I saw how fast I was
going."
Johnson swam the 200 in two
minutes, 16.86 seconds against
Texas Feb. 4, a time .03 seconds
faster than she swam the event
to take sixth at last year's NCAA
Championships. Considering she
did not rp<?t much for the Texas
dual meet, Johnson feels she can
take a few seconds off that time
before March 18th, the day the
200 breaststroke will be swum at
this year's NCAA meet.
"Personally, my goal is to win
the 200 breast," she said, adding,
"and set an American record. The
record is 2:11.4 [actually 2:11.46,
set by Tracy Caulkins in 1980]
and I think I can take five seconds
off my time. If I set that out there
then even if I don't do it I'll still
go really fast."

Johnson began swimming at
age eight in a summer league. "I
came pretty close to breaking the
summer league records in breast
stroke," she said, and she has
stuck with that stroke ever since.
A crisis was choosing be
tween Stanford and Harvard for
college. "I really wanted to go to
Harvard," she said. "IBut] I'm
certainly glad I didn't."
Johnson came to Stanford and
found it quite to her liking. "It
was a great change," she said. "I
love collegiate swimming. It's ac
tually great to train with four
other breaststrokers who are at
least as good or better than you."
This season, however, Johnson
has usually been the Cardinal's
top gun. In addition to her suc
cesses in the 200, she also has
the team's best time in the 100
breastroke. With perhaps the four
top breaststrokers from last year
not swimming this season (Rapp
and Texas' Tracey McFarlane
graduated, Texas' Susan Johnson
retired and California's Hiroko
Nagasaki is out for the season
with an injury), Johnson has a
great chance to reach the finals
in both breaststroke events at the
NCAA meet.
And more importantly to her,
the Cardinal has a good shot at
winning the NCAA team title. She
thinks first-year Coach Richard
Quick is a part of that.
"[Practicesl are definitely more
difficult this last year," she said.
"Having half the swimmers being
freshmen helps us because they
weren't used to the old way. They
just do it.
The team is competing in the
Pacific 10 Conference Champion
ships this weekend in Cerritos,
Calif., a meet very similar to the
NCAA meet. "I think we're going

to blow some people out of the
water if we swim fast like we did
at Texas," she said.
"Other teams are going to have
a lot of people shaved and tapered
to make NCAA cuts but I don't
think we should have a problem."
Stanford scored 1545.5 points
last year, 339.5 more than
runner-up California, and the
Cardinal has been swimming con
sistently faster this season com
pared to last.
And then it's on to the NCAA
Championships in Indianapolis,
March 16-18 where the best in
the nation, and the American
record, are waiting.
