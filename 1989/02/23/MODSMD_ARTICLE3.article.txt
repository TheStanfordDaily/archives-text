# Affirmative action goals not yet met
## Minority student numbers up, faculty numbers still low 
### Rob Burwell Staff writer 
Despite gains in the last 20 years, a
"painfully large" gap still exists between
the University's progress and its goals
to recruit minorities and women and
provide "equal citizenship," according
to the annual Affirmative Action Report
made public yesterday.
The report, authored by Provost
James Rosse, outlines Stanford's objec
tives for pursuing affirmitive action pol
icies and chronicles efforts to recruit
minority undergraduates, graduates,
faculty and staff. The report will be
presented at today's Faculty Senate
meeting.
According to Rosse, "the coming
generations of leadership will include
many drawn from the ranks of black
Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native
Americans and Asian-Americans." Be

cause of this belief, the University is
trying to enroll "those students who will
be the leaders of the next generation
and beyond, regardless of ethnic back
ground."
The report, however, states that such
diverse enrollment will not occur unless
Stanford can offer an education that
meets the needs of minority students
and develops an environment where
recruited minority faculty and staff "can
teach by the example of their own suc
cess."
Undergraduates
According to the report, the Class of
1992 has higher percentages of women
and minorities than the undergraduate
population as a whole.
The entering class consisted of 37.2
percent minorities, compared to 32.5
percent minorities in the total under

graduate population.
In fact, the class that entered in 1988
showed a higher percentage of minori
ties than the current student body in
every category but one. The categories
show increased percentages of black,
Hispanic other than Chicano, Asian-
American and Native American stu
dents.
Chicano students were the only mi
nority group whose percentage of total
enrollment did not increase. The per
centage of Chicano students in the fresh
men class equalled the 8.6 percentage
in the undergraduate population.
According to the report, blacks,
Chicanos and Native Americans are
"targeted minorities." This status
brings "a) special recruiting efforts, b)
more sensitive admissions criteria and

The graph above details the increase in the number of minorities among entering
freshmen since 1982. The University does not consider Asian-American students
"targeted minorities" since they are not under-represented at Stanford.
