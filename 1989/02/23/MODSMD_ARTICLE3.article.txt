# Affirmative action goals not yet met
## Minority student numbers up, faculty numbers still low 
### Rob Burwell Staff writer 
Despite gains in the last 20 years, a
"painfully large" gap still exists between
the University's progress and its goals
to recruit minorities and women and
provide "equal citizenship," according
to the annual Affirmative Action Report
made public yesterday.
The report, authored by Provost
James Rosse, outlines Stanford's objec
tives for pursuing affirmitive action pol
icies and chronicles efforts to recruit
minority undergraduates, graduates,
faculty and staff. The report will be
presented at today's Faculty Senate
meeting.
According to Rosse, "the coming
generations of leadership will include
many drawn from the ranks of black
Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native
Americans and Asian-Americans." Be

cause of this belief, the University is
trying to enroll "those students who will
be the leaders of the next generation
and beyond, regardless of ethnic back
ground."
The report, however, states that such
diverse enrollment will not occur unless
Stanford can offer an education that
meets the needs of minority students
and develops an environment where
recruited minority faculty and staff "can
teach by the example of their own suc
cess."
Undergraduates
According to the report, the Class of
1992 has higher percentages of women
and minorities than the undergraduate
population as a whole.
The entering class consisted of 37.2
percent minorities, compared to 32.5
percent minorities in the total under

graduate population.
In fact, the class that entered in 1988
showed a higher percentage of minori
ties than the current student body in
every category but one. The categories
show increased percentages of black,
Hispanic other than Chicano, Asian-
American and Native American stu
dents.
Chicano students were the only mi
nority group whose percentage of total
enrollment did not increase. The per
centage of Chicano students in the fresh
men class equalled the 8.6 percentage
in the undergraduate population.
According to the report, blacks,
Chicanos and Native Americans are
"targeted minorities." This status
brings "a) special recruiting efforts, b)
more sensitive admissions criteria and

"targeted minorities" since they are not under-represented at Stanford.
c) more favorable treatment on
financial aid."
According to Rosse, the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Admis
sions and Financial Aid is again
discussing whether additional mi
nority groups, especially Asian-
Americans , will be added to the
list of targeted minorities.
The report also contrasts Stan
ford's minority enrollment to uni
versities such as UC-Berkeley,
Harvard, Yale and Princeton.
Berkeley's entering class con
sisted of 50.3 percent minorities,
contrasted with Stanford's 37.6
percent and Harvard's 28.9 per
cent. Yale and Princeton came in
at 22.6 and 20.8 percent respec
tively.
Faculty
Growth of minority faculty has
been impressive, but the numbers
are still small, Rosse writes.
"One of the important reasons
for affirmative action is to develop
role models for our students. We
have.been considerably less suc
cessful in this than we would like

or than we need to be," according
to Rosse.
At the beginning of this year,
women made up 10.7 percent of
the Academic Council and minor
ities accounted for 8 percent of
the total council.
The Academic Council consists
of about 1,320 professors, associ
ate professors, assistant profes
sors and members of the non
tenure line.
Approximately half of the mi
nority faculty were of Asian back
ground, with 4.2 percent making
up the Academic Council. Blacks
made up 1.6 percent and
Hispanics accounted for 2.1 per
cent. Only one Native American
is a member of the Academic
Council.
According to the report, minor
ity faculty are not evenly distrib
uted across the schools of the Uni
versity. For example, 9 percent of
the social sciences faculty are mi
norities compared to just slightly
more than 4 percent for the nat
ural sciences.
The report, however, stresses
the care that is taken during the
selection process to encourage the
hiring of additional minority fac
ulty.

Graduate students
"Graduate training provides an
especially powerful lever for gen
erating the leaders of the next
generation. . . . Educational lead
ership in the University faculties
of the future is found in the grad
uate schools of today," writes
Rosse.
He says that the next two
decades will see an increasing rate
of retirement from the faculties
of American universities, and
adds that taking advantage of this
opportunity to introduce more mi
norities into the faculty will re
quire "a considerable enrollment
increase among minorities in doc
toral programs."
According to the report, minor
ities make up 19.1 percent of the
entering class of doctoral students,
but only 14.8 percent of enrolled
doctoral students.
Staff
According to Rosse, it is impor
tant to have affirmative action
policies for hiring staff.
Two-thirds of the University's
staff are women, and minorities
make up a quarter of the staff.
