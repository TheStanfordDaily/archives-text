### 
Rough, tough and of the Lough
What does Celtic folk music bnng to mind? Screeching
bagpipes played by bearded men prancing around in
dresses that they call "kilts" to hide the fact that they're
dresses?
Well forget everything you know, or think you know,
about Celtic folk music — the Boys of the Lough are coming.
The Boys — Dave Richardson, John Coakley, Cathal
McConneli, Aly Bain and Chnsty O'Leary — have appeared
all over the world, and are well known for their appearances
on Garrison Keillor's "Prarie Home Companion."
Playing guitar and piano, as well as wood flute, uilleann
pipes (don't ask me....). tin whistle, fiddle, mandolin and
banjo, the Boys of the Lough perform jigs, hornpipes, reels
and songs dating back as far as 1690, as well as onginal
compositions.
Appeanng with The Boys will be Jean Redpath, an
internationally recognized interpreter of traditional Scottish
music.
The Boys of the Lough and Jean Redpath will be per
forming this Sunday at 2:30 p.m. in Memonal Auditonum.
Tickets are available at all BASS outlets as well as on
specially-marked boxes of Kellogg's Frosted Flakes and
at the door.
Next up for Scorcese
Coming off the wildly popular success of "The Last
Temptation of Chnst," we would like to suggest that Martin
Scorcese make his next project the film version of "The
Satantic Verses."
Only Scorcese's unique vision could bnng such a shock
ing and provocative tale to the big screen. Maybe he could
even get the Ayatollah to do a cameo.
Watch out for "The Very Last Temptation of Salman
Rushdie," coming soon to a theater near you.
