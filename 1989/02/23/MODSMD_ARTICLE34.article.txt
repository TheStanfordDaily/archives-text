# There's music in her veins

Chances are you don't know
who Melissa Etheridge is. Yet. Six
months from now — maybe a year
at the most — you will know ex
actly who she is.
Melissa Etheridge's self-titled
debut album is a terrific showpiece
of acoustic rock, her gravelly vocals
neatly complimenting rocking,
catchy melodies. She is, clearly,
the best new artist of the year.
Not that her talent has gone un
recognized in all corners. Her
single "Bring Me Some Water" was
nominated for a Grammy in the
Best Female Rock Vocal category.
And although she didn't win the
award last night, the nomination
is proof that Etheridge belongs
alongside such heavyweights as
Tina Turner, Pat Benatar, Toni
Childs and Sinead O'Connor.
Born and raised in Leavenworth,
Kansas, Etheridge, 27, began play
ing with local cover bands, and at
18 left to study guitar at the pres
tigious Berklee College of Music
in Boston. At Berklee she supple
mented her income by playing her
music in coffee houses throughout
the Boston area.
Soon after, Etheridge moved to

Los Angeles to pursue a career in
music, playing solo gigs in bars
and honing her songwriting skills.
It was in one of those bars that
Island Records' founder Chris
Blackwell discovered her and
signed her to a contract on the spot.
The Grammy-nominated single
from her first album, "Bring Me
Some Water," was a top-10 AOR
radio hit. The next release, "Like
The Way I Do," the catchiest song
on the album, was a strong follow
up. The recently released "Similar
Features" promises to be her
breakthrough hit, partly on the
strength of a music video which
will introduce Etheridge to MTV
and the purchasing public.
After touring with Huey Lewis
and The News, and Bruce Hornsby
and The Range in 1988, Etheridge
is currently on a solo tour playing
small clubs across the country. But
by the time her follow-up album
is released in late spring, Melissa
Etheridge should be graduating
from small clubs to headlining
events.
Unlike Tracy Chapman, Mi
chelle Shocked and Suzanne Vega,
three other women playing acous
tic music, Melissa Etheridge is a
rock star at heart. Don't be fooled
by the label "acoustic" — this is

first and foremost rock music, in
fectiously catchy yet never overly
commercial.
Still, chances are you've never
heard any of Melissa Etheridge's
music. Don't worry, six months
from now you will have. Her music
simply can't miss.
Etheridge recently spoke to In
termission from New York after a
sold-out performance. She speaks
slowly, emphasizing her words
with a strange Kansas twang. Her
voice is deep and rough, much like
it sounds on the album:
Do you still feel like a real un
known, even in the music world!
Yeah, I kinda do. It's funny,
some days something will happen
to make me think, "gosh I must
be doing well." Like I recently met
[songwriter] Holly Knight, and she
said she was a big fan, and I went
"Whoa!" because here's someone
whose work I've admired for a long
time. To hear her say that it's like,
"Oh, I must be doing well."
