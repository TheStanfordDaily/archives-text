# There's music in her veins
## 
### Andrew Berkowitz Editorial staff 
Chances are you don't know
who Melissa Etheridge is. Yet. Six
months from now — maybe a year
at the most — you will know ex
actly who she is.
Melissa Etheridge's self-titled
debut album is a terrific showpiece
of acoustic rock, her gravelly vocals
neatly complimenting rocking,
catchy melodies. She is, clearly,
the best new artist of the year.
Not that her talent has gone un
recognized in all corners. Her
single "Bring Me Some Water" was
nominated for a Grammy in the
Best Female Rock Vocal category.
And although she didn't win the
award last night, the nomination
is proof that Etheridge belongs
alongside such heavyweights as
Tina Turner, Pat Benatar, Toni
Childs and Sinead O'Connor.
Born and raised in Leavenworth,
Kansas, Etheridge, 27, began play
ing with local cover bands, and at
18 left to study guitar at the pres
tigious Berklee College of Music
in Boston. At Berklee she supple
mented her income by playing her
music in coffee houses throughout
the Boston area.
Soon after, Etheridge moved to

Los Angeles to pursue a career in
music, playing solo gigs in bars
and honing her songwriting skills.
It was in one of those bars that
Island Records' founder Chris
Blackwell discovered her and
signed her to a contract on the spot.
The Grammy-nominated single
from her first album, "Bring Me
Some Water," was a top-10 AOR
radio hit. The next release, "Like
The Way I Do," the catchiest song
on the album, was a strong follow
up. The recently released "Similar
Features" promises to be her
breakthrough hit, partly on the
strength of a music video which
will introduce Etheridge to MTV
and the purchasing public.
After touring with Huey Lewis
and The News, and Bruce Hornsby
and The Range in 1988, Etheridge
is currently on a solo tour playing
small clubs across the country. But
by the time her follow-up album
is released in late spring, Melissa
Etheridge should be graduating
from small clubs to headlining
events.
Unlike Tracy Chapman, Mi
chelle Shocked and Suzanne Vega,
three other women playing acous
tic music, Melissa Etheridge is a
rock star at heart. Don't be fooled
by the label "acoustic" — this is

first and foremost rock music, in
fectiously catchy yet never overly
commercial.
Still, chances are you've never
heard any of Melissa Etheridge's
music. Don't worry, six months
from now you will have. Her music
simply can't miss.
Etheridge recently spoke to In
termission from New York after a
sold-out performance. She speaks
slowly, emphasizing her words
with a strange Kansas twang. Her
voice is deep and rough, much like
it sounds on the album:
Do you still feel like a real un
known, even in the music world!
Yeah, I kinda do. It's funny,
some days something will happen
to make me think, "gosh I must
be doing well." Like I recently met
[songwriter] Holly Knight, and she
said she was a big fan, and I went
"Whoa!" because here's someone
whose work I've admired for a long
time. To hear her say that it's like,
"Oh, I must be doing well."
Do you think your first music
video, for "Similar Features," will

be the thing that launches you
into the mainstream!
I hope so, I guess. I don't really
do those things to break into the
mainstream. You do videos be
cause the record company really
wants you to,- it's become the thing
to do now. So I did a video that
fit the song. It looked good, and I
felt it was a good representation
of the song. If it helps me get into
the mainstream .. . great, I guess.
Who were some of your influ
ences growing up!
I grew up in the Midwest. We
had one radio station, one pop,
rock and roll radio station. I lis
tened to Steppenwolf and Tommy
James and the Shondells. I remem
ber I had Carol King's "Tapestry"
album, James Taylor's "Sweet
Baby Jane," and as I grew older I
got Bruce Springsteen's "Born to
Run." I remember listening to The
Who's "Tommy." It's different
pieces rather than a single artist.
Who would you compare your
musical sound to!
That's really hard. I leave the
comparisons up to people who like
to do that. There's a lot of critics
that that's the way they do it. They
say, "She sounds like, you know,
Bruce Springsteen and Joni
Mitchell; or her voice is like Janis
Joplin ; or she writes like .. I've
had all sorts of different compar
isons. I try to stay away from com
paring myself.
Have they been comparing you
to some of the other new acoustic
artists like Suzanne Vega and
Tracy Chapman!
Each [reviewer] always says,
"You know, some people would
like to compare you to Tracy Chap
man, but you're really different."
So no one's really ever compared

me to Tracy Chapman or Suzanne
Vega. They say there's a new wave
of women singer/songwriters with
acoustic guitars and such, but they
kind of know better than to com
pare us because we are all different.
We come from a real different base,
and our songwriting is different
and our approach to performance
is different.
When your second album comes
out are we going to hear changes

We have gone about it in the
same manner. We've recorded it
in the same way. It's recorded live
in the studio; the three of us, my
drummer, bass player and myself
playing and singing, cutting the
track at the same time, and then
we go back and put the guitar or
the keyboards on. In that sense
it's recorded in the same way. The
songs I believe, and my perform
ance, and me myself, I think have
gotten better — at least I hope.
And the writing is a little wiser.
I'm moving on, and I think that's
what the difference will be.
What is your goal in this whole
businessi
My idea of success would be just
to be able to keep doing what I

love to do, which is recording, per
forming. That's my first love, per
forming live in front of people. And
being able to reach more and more
people with my music, with my
writing, that's what I want. To be
able to do that would be the ful
fillment for me.
Where do you want to be a year
or two from nowi On the covers
of all the magazines, or are you
content where you are now{
I just want to get better. I want
to move on. I don't think about it
in terms of getting on a cover of
a magazine. I wouldn't not like it,
but it's not something that I hope
for.
Why did you decide to go to the
Berklee College of Musict
It was sort of a decision between
my parents and myself. They
wanted me to go to college; I said
alright, but it had to be a music
college, because I knew that's what
I wanted to make my life, that's
the career I wanted to follow. So
the Berklee College of Music was
one where I could major in Modem
Guitar — like jazz guitar — since
I was not classically trained.
What was it like opening for
Huey Lewis in Europe!
That was incredible; those were
the largest audiences I've ever
played for, and at times it was very
challenging. There were places
where not a single soul knew who
I was, and it was a matter of win
ning the audience over in 30
minutes. Most of the times it was
very satisfying very succesful.
And what was it like playing on
Late Night with David Lettermanl
He allowed me to come on his
show, I just sang a song and sat
down and he asked me a couple
questions — he just left it at that.
The music he likes he really ap
preciates, and he let me know
many times that he enjoyed the
music.

people with my music, with my
writing, that's what I want. To be
able to do that would be the ful
fillment for me.
Where do you want to be a year
or two from nowi On the covers
of all the magazines, or are you
content where you are now{
I just want to get better. I want
to move on. I don't think about it
in terms of getting on a cover of
a magazine. I wouldn't not like it,
but it's not something that I hope
for.
Why did you decide to go to the
Berklee College of Musict
It was sort of a decision between
my parents and myself. They
wanted me to go to college; I said
alright, but it had to be a music
college, because I knew that's what
I wanted to make my life, that's
the career I wanted to follow. So
the Berklee College of Music was
one where I could major in Modem
Guitar — like jazz guitar — since
I was not classically trained.
What was it like opening for
Huey Lewis in Europe!
That was incredible; those were
the largest audiences I've ever
played for, and at times it was very
challenging. There were places
where not a single soul knew who
I was, and it was a matter of win
ning the audience over in 30
minutes. Most of the times it was
very satisfying very succesful.
And what was it like playing on
Late Night with David Lettermanl
He allowed me to come on his
show, I just sang a song and sat
down and he asked me a couple
questions — he just left it at that.
The music he likes he really ap
preciates, and he let me know
many times that he enjoyed the
music.


in your sound, or is the music on
your first album fairly representa
tive!
Chances are you don't know
who Melissa Etheridge is. Yet. Six
months from now — maybe a year
at the most — you will know ex
actly who she is.
Melissa Etheridge's self-titled
debut album is a terrific showpiece
of acoustic rock, her gravelly vocals
neatly complimenting rocking,
catchy melodies. She is, clearly,
the best new artist of the year.
Not that her talent has gone un
recognized in all corners. Her
single "Bring Me Some Water" was
nominated for a Grammy in the
Best Female Rock Vocal category.
And although she didn't win the
award last night, the nomination
is proof that Etheridge belongs
alongside such heavyweights as
Tina Turner, Pat Benatar, Toni
Childs and Sinead O'Connor.
Born and raised in Leavenworth,
Kansas, Etheridge, 27, began play
ing with local cover bands, and at
18 left to study guitar at the pres
tigious Berklee College of Music
in Boston. At Berklee she supple
mented her income by playing her
music in coffee houses throughout
the Boston area.
Soon after, Etheridge moved to

Los Angeles to pursue a career in
music, playing solo gigs in bars
and honing her songwriting skills.
It was in one of those bars that
Island Records' founder Chris
Blackwell discovered her and
signed her to a contract on the spot.
The Grammy-nominated single
from her first album, "Bring Me
Some Water," was a top-10 AOR
radio hit. The next release, "Like
The Way I Do," the catchiest song
on the album, was a strong follow
up. The recently released "Similar
Features" promises to be her
breakthrough hit, partly on the
strength of a music video which
will introduce Etheridge to MTV
and the purchasing public.
After touring with Huey Lewis
and The News, and Bruce Hornsby
and The Range in 1988, Etheridge
is currently on a solo tour playing
small clubs across the country. But
by the time her follow-up album
is released in late spring, Melissa
Etheridge should be graduating
from small clubs to headlining
events.
Unlike Tracy Chapman, Mi
chelle Shocked and Suzanne Vega,
three other women playing acous
tic music, Melissa Etheridge is a
rock star at heart. Don't be fooled
by the label "acoustic" — this is

first and foremost rock music, in
fectiously catchy yet never overly
commercial.
Still, chances are you've never
heard any of Melissa Etheridge's
music. Don't worry, six months
from now you will have. Her music
simply can't miss.
Etheridge recently spoke to In
termission from New York after a
sold-out performance. She speaks
slowly, emphasizing her words
with a strange Kansas twang. Her
voice is deep and rough, much like
it sounds on the album:
Do you still feel like a real un
known, even in the music world!
Yeah, I kinda do. It's funny,
some days something will happen
to make me think, "gosh I must
be doing well." Like I recently met
[songwriter] Holly Knight, and she
said she was a big fan, and I went
"Whoa!" because here's someone
whose work I've admired for a long
time. To hear her say that it's like,
"Oh, I must be doing well."
Do you think your first music
video, for "Similar Features," will

be the thing that launches you
into the mainstream!
I hope so, I guess. I don't really
do those things to break into the
mainstream. You do videos be
cause the record company really
wants you to,- it's become the thing
to do now. So I did a video that
fit the song. It looked good, and I
felt it was a good representation
of the song. If it helps me get into
the mainstream .. . great, I guess.
Who were some of your influ
ences growing up!
I grew up in the Midwest. We
had one radio station, one pop,
rock and roll radio station. I lis
tened to Steppenwolf and Tommy
James and the Shondells. I remem
ber I had Carol King's "Tapestry"
album, James Taylor's "Sweet
Baby Jane," and as I grew older I
got Bruce Springsteen's "Born to
Run." I remember listening to The
Who's "Tommy." It's different
pieces rather than a single artist.
Who would you compare your
musical sound to!
That's really hard. I leave the
comparisons up to people who like
to do that. There's a lot of critics
that that's the way they do it. They
say, "She sounds like, you know,
Bruce Springsteen and Joni
Mitchell; or her voice is like Janis
Joplin ; or she writes like .. I've
had all sorts of different compar
isons. I try to stay away from com
paring myself.
Have they been comparing you
to some of the other new acoustic
artists like Suzanne Vega and
Tracy Chapman!
Each [reviewer] always says,
"You know, some people would
like to compare you to Tracy Chap
man, but you're really different."
So no one's really ever compared

me to Tracy Chapman or Suzanne
Vega. They say there's a new wave
of women singer/songwriters with
acoustic guitars and such, but they
kind of know better than to com
pare us because we are all different.
We come from a real different base,
and our songwriting is different
and our approach to performance
is different.
When your second album comes
out are we going to hear changes

We have gone about it in the
same manner. We've recorded it
in the same way. It's recorded live
in the studio; the three of us, my
drummer, bass player and myself
playing and singing, cutting the
track at the same time, and then
we go back and put the guitar or
the keyboards on. In that sense
it's recorded in the same way. The
songs I believe, and my perform
ance, and me myself, I think have
gotten better — at least I hope.
And the writing is a little wiser.
I'm moving on, and I think that's
what the difference will be.
What is your goal in this whole
businessi
My idea of success would be just
to be able to keep doing what I

love to do, which is recording, per
forming. That's my first love, per
forming live in front of people. And
being able to reach more and more
people with my music, with my
writing, that's what I want. To be
able to do that would be the ful
fillment for me.
Where do you want to be a year

Bruce Springsteen and Joni
Mitchell; or her voice is like Janis
Joplin ; or she writes like .. I've
had all sorts of different compar
isons. I try to stay away from com
paring myself.
Have they been comparing you
to some of the other new acoustic
artists like Suzanne Vega and
Tracy Chapman!
Each [reviewer] always says,
"You know, some people would
like to compare you to Tracy Chap
man, but you're really different."
So no one's really ever compared

me to Tracy Chapman or Suzanne
Vega. They say there's a new wave
of women singer/songwriters with
acoustic guitars and such, but they
kind of know better than to com
pare us because we are all different.
We come from a real different base,
and our songwriting is different
and our approach to performance
is different.
When your second album comes
out are we going to hear changes

We have gone about it in the
same manner. We've recorded it
in the same way. It's recorded live
in the studio; the three of us, my
drummer, bass player and myself
playing and singing, cutting the
track at the same time, and then
we go back and put the guitar or
the keyboards on. In that sense
it's recorded in the same way. The
songs I believe, and my perform
ance, and me myself, I think have
gotten better — at least I hope.
And the writing is a little wiser.
I'm moving on, and I think that's
what the difference will be.
What is your goal in this whole
businessi
My idea of success would be just
to be able to keep doing what I

love to do, which is recording, per
forming. That's my first love, per
forming live in front of people. And
being able to reach more and more
people with my music, with my
writing, that's what I want. To be
able to do that would be the ful
fillment for me.
Where do you want to be a year
or two from nowi On the covers
of all the magazines, or are you
content where you are now{
I just want to get better. I want
to move on. I don't think about it
in terms of getting on a cover of
a magazine. I wouldn't not like it,
but it's not something that I hope
for.
Why did you decide to go to the
Berklee College of Musict
It was sort of a decision between
my parents and myself. They
wanted me to go to college; I said
alright, but it had to be a music
college, because I knew that's what
I wanted to make my life, that's
the career I wanted to follow. So
the Berklee College of Music was
one where I could major in Modem
Guitar — like jazz guitar — since
I was not classically trained.
What was it like opening for
Huey Lewis in Europe!
That was incredible; those were
the largest audiences I've ever
played for, and at times it was very
challenging. There were places
where not a single soul knew who
I was, and it was a matter of win
ning the audience over in 30
minutes. Most of the times it was
very satisfying very succesful.
And what was it like playing on
Late Night with David Lettermanl
He allowed me to come on his
show, I just sang a song and sat
down and he asked me a couple
questions — he just left it at that.
The music he likes he really ap
preciates, and he let me know
many times that he enjoyed the
music.


in your sound, or is the music on
your first album fairly representa
tive!
