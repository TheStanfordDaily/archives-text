When you come right down to it, the
people in this world can be divided into
two categories: Those who have been con
demned to Eternal Hell by the Ayatollah
and those who haven't. Unfortunately,
this week's topic is pets, so we will have
to find new categories:
When you come right down to it, the
people in this world can be divided into
two categories: dog people and cat people.
By this I mean "people who own dogs,"
and "people who own cats," not "people
who are aogs," and "people who are cats."
I make this clarification because recently
there have been a whole slew of fine doc
umentary films about people who turn
into cats and dogs, the most notable being
"The Shaggy D.A.," a movie about a shaggy
D.A., and "Cat People," a movie in which
Natassia Kinski gets naked several times
and probably turns into a cat at some
point.
Now among dog people and cat people
there rages a great debate as to which is
the superior pet. Dog people like to point
out that dogs are friendly and obedient
and faithful and good-natured and loyal
and devoted and have the same approxi
mate I.Q. as that of the typical house
plant. Cat people like to point out that

cats are "independent." Then again, The
Daily likes to point out that IT'S inde
pendent, and it isn't even huggable.
Dogs can be divided into five categories:
(1) Dogs that come from Germany:
Schnauzer, Panzer, German Shepherd,
Rottweiler, Bratwurst.
(2) Dogs that are designed to kill
people: Pit bull, Doberman, Tyran
nosaurus, Mastiff.
(3) Dogs that belong on a bun:
Dachshund, Chihuahua, Pekingese, Brat
wurst.
(4) Dogs whose names sound like eup
hemisms for bowel movements: Scooby
Doo, Rin Tin Tin, Tinkerbell, Poopsie.
(5) Does that have been condemned
to death by the Ayatollah: Fido Rushdie,
Rex Rushdie, Scraps Rushdie, Mar
maduke.
Cats can be divided into one category:
(1) Cats.
There arc many advantages to owning
a dog. For example, your dog will provide
loving companionship during the day by
always meeting you with a wagging tail
and an affectionate nuzzle when you come
into your home. If a burglar should break
into your house in the middle of the night,
you will feel safe knowing that your dog

will be there to greet him with a waiting
tail and an affectionante nuzzle.
At first glance it would seem that there
are far fewer advantages to owning a cat,
but in reality cats arc superior pets. For
one thing, cats are fastidiously clean. Dog
owners don't realize how nice it is to own
a pet that never ever makes a mess. For
instance, as soon as she eats, my cat Gink
immediately spends the better part of an
hour licking her fur clean until it positively
glistens in the light. Then she throws up
an entire week's worth of Purina Cat
Chow on the sofa and wanders off, cleanly.
Another advantage to owning cats is
that they have a keen sense of direction.
I'm sure you've all heard the stories about
how a grandmother in New York acci
dentlv left her cat on the streets of Los
Angeles, and three weeks later the cat was
bacK on her doorstep — albeit addicted to
crack and a member of a religious organ
ization that worshiped Spaghcttios.
My cat has such a keen sense of direc
tion that I let it make my airline reserva
tions every summer.
Of course it isn't absolutely necessary
that you be a cat person or a dog person;
there arc other available pets. For instance,
back at home we have pet llamas (Spanish

pronunciation: "Ya-ma-has"). Llamas are
extremely fun and useful pets, primarily
because they are capable of expelling the
full contents of their stomach at upwards
of 90 miles an hour. If Oliver North had
known about llamas three years ago it's
likely he would have traded some to Iran
in exchange for an autographed copy of
"The Satanic Verses."
Llamas also heir tO 112 teach youngsters
about sexual reproduction. When mating,
the male llama leaps onto the female llama

and mates enthusiastically; during this
time, the female llama sits patiently with
a bored expression on her face, chewing
her cud. I won't go into detail here as to
how this educated me into the ways of
sexual reproduction, except to say that
I'm glad most women don't have cuds.
The only kind of pet I dislike are birds.
I say this because my only exposure to
pet birds came when I dated a girl in high
school named Cathy who had a pet parrot.
At least she claimed it was a parrot, al
though in reality I am quite certain that
it was a pterodactyl. I say this because
on more than one occasion this "parrot,"
which was roughly the size of a 747,
would swoop off of its perch and attempt
to carry me back to its nest. It would
usually do this right when I was preparing
to make a pass at Cathy.
It went on like this for several weeks:
"You know I find you very . . . (SWOOP)
.. . attractive and I'd like to know if ...
(SWOOP). .. you'd mind if I. .. (SWOOP,
GRAB, FLAP, FLAP, FLAP, MUNCH,
MUNCH, BURP)."
I finally stopped seeing Cathy altogether,
although the parrot and I still write to
each other from time to time.

there arc other available pets. For instance,
back at home we have pet llamas (Spanish

pronunciation: "Ya-ma-has"). Llamas are
extremely fun and useful pets, primarily
because they are capable of expelling the
full contents of their stomach at upwards
of 90 miles an hour. If Oliver North had
known about llamas three years ago it's
likely he would have traded some to Iran
in exchange for an autographed copy of
"The Satanic Verses."
Llamas also heir tO 112 teach youngsters
about sexual reproduction. When mating,
the male llama leaps onto the female llama

and mates enthusiastically; during this
time, the female llama sits patiently with
a bored expression on her face, chewing
her cud. I won't go into detail here as to
how this educated me into the ways of
sexual reproduction, except to say that
I'm glad most women don't have cuds.
The only kind of pet I dislike are birds.
I say this because my only exposure to
pet birds came when I dated a girl in high
school named Cathy who had a pet parrot.
At least she claimed it was a parrot, al
though in reality I am quite certain that
it was a pterodactyl. I say this because
on more than one occasion this "parrot,"
which was roughly the size of a 747,
would swoop off of its perch and attempt
to carry me back to its nest. It would
usually do this right when I was preparing
to make a pass at Cathy.
It went on like this for several weeks:
"You know I find you very . . . (SWOOP)
.. . attractive and I'd like to know if ...
(SWOOP). .. you'd mind if I. .. (SWOOP,
GRAB, FLAP, FLAP, FLAP, MUNCH,
MUNCH, BURP)."
I finally stopped seeing Cathy altogether,
although the parrot and I still write to
each other from time to time.

When you come right down to it, the
people in this world can be divided into
two categories: Those who have been con
demned to Eternal Hell by the Ayatollah
and those who haven't. Unfortunately,
this week's topic is pets, so we will have
to find new categories:
When you come right down to it, the
people in this world can be divided into
two categories: dog people and cat people.
By this I mean "people who own dogs,"
and "people who own cats," not "people
who are aogs," and "people who are cats."
I make this clarification because recently
there have been a whole slew of fine doc
umentary films about people who turn
into cats and dogs, the most notable being
"The Shaggy D.A.," a movie about a shaggy
D.A., and "Cat People," a movie in which
Natassia Kinski gets naked several times
and probably turns into a cat at some
point.
Now among dog people and cat people
there rages a great debate as to which is
the superior pet. Dog people like to point
out that dogs are friendly and obedient
and faithful and good-natured and loyal
and devoted and have the same approxi
mate I.Q. as that of the typical house
plant. Cat people like to point out that

cats are "independent." Then again, The
Daily likes to point out that IT'S inde
pendent, and it isn't even huggable.
Dogs can be divided into five categories:
(1) Dogs that come from Germany:
Schnauzer, Panzer, German Shepherd,
Rottweiler, Bratwurst.
(2) Dogs that are designed to kill
people: Pit bull, Doberman, Tyran
nosaurus, Mastiff.
(3) Dogs that belong on a bun:
Dachshund, Chihuahua, Pekingese, Brat
wurst.
(4) Dogs whose names sound like eup
hemisms for bowel movements: Scooby
Doo, Rin Tin Tin, Tinkerbell, Poopsie.
(5) Does that have been condemned
to death by the Ayatollah: Fido Rushdie,
Rex Rushdie, Scraps Rushdie, Mar
maduke.
Cats can be divided into one category:
(1) Cats.
There arc many advantages to owning
a dog. For example, your dog will provide
loving companionship during the day by
always meeting you with a wagging tail
and an affectionate nuzzle when you come
into your home. If a burglar should break
into your house in the middle of the night,
you will feel safe knowing that your dog

will be there to greet him with a waiting
tail and an affectionante nuzzle.
At first glance it would seem that there
are far fewer advantages to owning a cat,
but in reality cats arc superior pets. For
one thing, cats are fastidiously clean. Dog
owners don't realize how nice it is to own
a pet that never ever makes a mess. For
instance, as soon as she eats, my cat Gink
immediately spends the better part of an
hour licking her fur clean until it positively
glistens in the light. Then she throws up
an entire week's worth of Purina Cat
Chow on the sofa and wanders off, cleanly.
Another advantage to owning cats is
that they have a keen sense of direction.
I'm sure you've all heard the stories about
how a grandmother in New York acci
dentlv left her cat on the streets of Los
Angeles, and three weeks later the cat was
bacK on her doorstep — albeit addicted to
crack and a member of a religious organ
ization that worshiped Spaghcttios.
My cat has such a keen sense of direc
tion that I let it make my airline reserva
tions every summer.
Of course it isn't absolutely necessary
that you be a cat person or a dog person;
there arc other available pets. For instance,
