## In quest of American justice 
### Martha Brockenbrough 
As Julius Rosenberg said
before his execution, "There had
to be a Rosenberg case because
there had to be an intensification
of the hysteria in America to
make the Korean War acceptable
to the American people. There
had to be a hysteria and a fear
sent through America in order
to get increased war budgets. And
there had to be a dagger thrust
in the heart of the left to tell
them that you are no longer
gonna give five years for a Smith
Act prosecution or one year for
Contempt of Court, but we're
gonna kill ya! . .
There had to be a play about
the Rosenberg Case to remind
us of the ugliness of the trial
and the questionable execution
of justice. Beyond this purpose
though, "Inquest", the latest pro
duction by the Palo Alto Players
at the Lucie Stem Theater in
Palo Alto, borders on being a
maudlin, and perhaps inac
curate, portrayal of the trial of
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.
Julius, an electrical engineer,
and his wife Ethel, were accused
of transferring information to the
Soviet Union about the atomic
bomb project at Los Alamos,
New Mexico.
Ethel's brother, Sgt. David
Greenglass, who was stationed
there, allegedly gave them the
information. His testimony,
combined with the questionable
evidence of an old collection plan
for a Communist organization,
was enough to convict both
Rosenbergs of espionage.
And despite the defense of
such people as Jean Paul Sartre
and Albert Einstein, who said
that the Rosenbergs did not have

the knowledge required to trans
mit such information to the Rus
sians, the couple was executed
shortly thereafter.
Playwright Donald Freed
makes it clear from the start that
he considers the Rosenbergs vic
tims of the extreme McCar

thyism of the times. They are
convicted because of their Com
munist affiliation, coupled with
the prosecution-encouraged
misinterpretation of their invoca
tion of the Fifth Amendment as

a tacit admission of guilt.
The mystery as to whether the
Rosenbergs were unjustly con
victed remains the most interest
ing aspect of their story. Yet Freed's
portrayal of them is so one-sided
that injustice seems a foregone
conclusion. "Inquest" would have
been a stronger and more accurate
production had the question of jus
tice remained a question.
Freed's characterization of the
Rosenbergs is shallow. Julius,
smoothly played by Rich Keuny,
lacks the passion and bitterness
that the real-life Rosenberg dis
played in the above quote.
Ethel, played by Stacie Ditchek,
is admirably dignified while on the
stand, but lapses into sloppy sen

timentality whenever she talks
about her two sons.
Flashbacks serve to fill in his
torical information about the case.
Although this technique is at times
confusing, it breaks up the other
wise one-dimensional, lengthy tri
al. And when the flashbacks work,
they are quite helpful and inter
esting.
"Inquest," if you can cut through
the one-sidedness, is a thought
provoking production, particularly
because the audience is addressed
as if they were the jury.
But as it is, Freed has over
simplified the issues in the trial.
He chalks up what may well have
been a wrong conviction to what
we now regard condescendingly as
McCarthyism. However, he never
concedes that McCarthyism,
though by no means justifiable, is

understandable in the context of
the times.
The play is a commentary on
American justice, yet all Freed il
lustrates is injustice. That, in it
self, is a distortion. The Rosen
bergs are portrayed as unquestion
ably innocent, when in actuality,
their innocence has no more been
proven than their guilt.
Although "Inquest" makes for
solid, intellectual entertainment,
Freed's criticism of the American
legal system is no more just than
the Rosenberg trial which he con
demns.

"Inquest" plays at the Lucie Stern
Theatre in Palo Alto through
March 4. Call 329-2623 for dates,
