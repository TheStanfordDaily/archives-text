## Do you believe in lawyers?

James Woods could read a page of the phone book
aloud and probably make it a riveting experience,
such is his ability to turn mediocre scripts into
intense movies. Fortunately, after struggling through
"Best Seller" and "Cop," Woods has found a movie
worthy of his talent in "True Believer." Part thriller,
part courtroom drama, the film gives Woods a role
he can really sink his teeth into.
Woods plays lawyer Eddie Dodd, a fascinating case
study of 1960s idealism gone sour. Once the defender
of Black Panthers and other activists, Dodd now
works at getting small-time drug dealers off the hook.
He defends them with impressive-sounding talk about
protecting civil liberties from the government's war
on drugs. But this is just rhetoric, and Dodd knows
that most of his clients are guilty. He's well on his
way to becoming a legal hack.

Robert Downey, Jr. doesn't
care about being cute in this
movie, and so he's better
than he ever has been
before.

Enter Roger Baron (Robert Downey, Jr.), idealistic
and fresh out of law school, who comes to New
York to work as Dodd's associate. Having read ad
miringly about Dodd's earlier work, Baron is appalled
by the current Dodd, a habitual pot smoker choking
on his own cynicism. Baron wants Dodd to take on
a real case and help someone who truly needs it.
Baron's chance arrives when two Oriental women
come to Dodd's dingy Greenwich Village office.
They're the mother and sister of one Shu Kai Kim
(Yuji Okomoto), a young convict who murdered an
other inmate in self-defense. Kim was first imprisoned
for murdering a street gang member eight years ago
in Chinatown, but the two lawyers soon find that
the evidence doesn't hold up. For this reason — and

because Kim's family has no one else to turn to —
Baron successfully argues Dodd into taking the case.
Their investigation quickly becomes a dark, messy
labyrinth, with Uzi-toting white supremicists and a
powerful district attorney (Kurtwood Smith) both
warning them off the case. This energizes Dodd like
nothing has in years. As he and Baron drive through
the seemingly bombed-out turf of New York's ghettos,
it's clear that Baron is now working with the zealous
Eddie Dodd of old, not the stoned has-been he'd first
met.
Robert Downey, Jr. doesn't care about being cute
in this movie, and so he's better than he ever has
been before. Still, every time he's onscreen, he looks
like he's about to cry. Maybe he was nervous about
co-starring with a real actor for the first time. James
Woods does so much to make the film credible that
he can't help but make Downey look good.
As Dodd, Woods twitches and gnaws his way
through every scene, reading his lines as if his life
depended upon it. Once or twice he overdoes it, but
the rest of the time his desperation is convincing.
It's clear that Dodd has nothing left, that the case
is the only thing keeping him going.
Writer Wesley Strick's dialogue for Dodd has a
bitter, acidic quality. Strick and director Joseph Ruben
keep things fast-moving; for the last hour, the tension
builds and builds so much that when Dodd finally
finds out the truth about what's been going on —
in an indoor parking lot filled with weird green light
ing — he, and we, can hardly believe it. The scene
has an eerie, almost hallucinatory feel to it.
At times "True Believer" verges on being too slick
(it would be hard to find a film that overuses flashy
crane shots as much as this one does), but Ruben
also gets surprisingly gritty. A movie director in the
late 1980s who seems willing to get his hands dirty
— amazing.
Ruben's grainy black-and-white flashbacks of the
Chinatown murder are unsettling, and the other vi
olent moments are so brutal that we really wony
about the heroes. (If he can get audiences to care
about Robert Downey, Jr., Ruben must be some kind
of great humanitarian). Ruben takes Eddie Dodd and
his sordid milieu seriously enough for us to care
what happens.

has an eerie, almost hallucinatory feel to it.
At times "True Believer" verges on being too slick
(it would be hard to find a film that overuses flashy
crane shots as much as this one does), but Ruben
also gets surprisingly gritty. A movie director in the
late 1980s who seems willing to get his hands dirty
— amazing.
Ruben's grainy black-and-white flashbacks of the
Chinatown murder are unsettling, and the other vi
olent moments are so brutal that we really wony
about the heroes. (If he can get audiences to care
about Robert Downey, Jr., Ruben must be some kind
of great humanitarian). Ruben takes Eddie Dodd and
his sordid milieu seriously enough for us to care
what happens.
