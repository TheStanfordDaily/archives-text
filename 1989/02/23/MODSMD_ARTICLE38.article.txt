# One excellent adventure

I know it looks stupid from the
previews. I know you've never
heard of any of the actors. And I
know it has a silly title.
But trust me on this one, OK.
Have I ever let you down? "Bill
and Ted's Excellent Adventure" is
the funniest movie of 1989.
Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted
(Keanu Reeves) are two high school
students who must pass their his
tory test the next day with an A +
or be kicked out of school. For
them, playing in their band, The
Wyld Stallyns, is far more impor
tant than passing classes.
Luckily, a genie named Rufus
(George Carlin) from the 27th cen
tury comes back in time to help
Bill and Ted pass their test by
taking them on a self-guided tour
of history, including meeting Billy
the Kid, Socrates and Napolean.
OK, it still sounds stupid, but
writers Chris Matheson and Ed
Solomon have turned out a wildly
clever script, filled with clever his
torical references and silly
anachronisms. Check out the
scene where Billy the Kid plays
football with Socrates.
The film was made on a shoe
string budget by an independent
film company with virtually un
known actors and directed by one
time film editor Stephen Herek,
who directed "Critters." Once
again, a small movie proves that
a film need not have a $40 million
budget and Meryl Streep to enter
tain. All that's necessary is a good
script, and "Bill and Ted's Excellent
Adventure" has one that's, well,
EXCELLENT!
