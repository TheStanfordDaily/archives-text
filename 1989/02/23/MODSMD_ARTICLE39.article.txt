# This sucka's gonna git you
## 
### Alex Kostich Staff writer 
Making fun of Hollywood genre
films can be very funny. As the
Zucker brothers proved with
"Airplane" and the "Naked Gun,"
parodies about disaster movies and
cop shows can send audiences into
fits of laughter. Now Keenan Ivory
Wayans, Robert Townsend's
protege, brines us a spoof of the
1970s "blaxploitation" films called
"I'm Gonna Git You, Sucka."
The movie starts off on the right
foot and rarely falters. It begins
with a black man found dead on
the streets of "Any Ghetto, USA."
The cause of death is attributed
to "wearing too many gold chains."
(He is shown buried in a mound
of jewlery.) In true "Superfly" style,
the victim's brother arrives in town
to bust the "suckas" who operate
the gold dealing gang (a metaphor
for crack-dealers, perhaps?).

Unfortunately, the
story takes
precedence over the
parody, and the con
clusion ends up
emulating the same
films it sets out to
satarize.

This sets the stage for the many
entertaining gags that give life to
the film. For example, there's a
Neighborhood Olympics Contest
in which participants must strip a
car in record time or outrun police
dogs with TV sets perched on their
shoulders.
And in one of the film's funniest
scenes, a just released ex-con

struts down the street in a zebra
zoot-suit and platform shoes with
fishtanks for heels.
The best thing about "I'm
Gonna Git You Sucka" is that it
never tries too hard to be funny
and as a result most of the jokes
work. Surprisingly, the gags are
never offensive — just goodhearted
jabs at the '70s black subculture.
Unfortunately, the story takes
precedence over the parody, and
the conclusion ends up emulating
the same films it sets out to
satarize.
Wayans, who wrote, directed and
stars in "Sucka," has the right idea.
He's a fresh turn from Spike Lee,
whose outlook on white Holly
wood is bitter and heavy-handed.
Wayans instead takes a goofy ap
proach to black cinema: His lack
of seriousness works in favor of
the film, because anybody of any
color can laugh at the jokes.
