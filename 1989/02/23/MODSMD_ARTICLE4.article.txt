# Cole, Perry debate free speech
## 
### Lisa Lawrence Staff writer 
In a strange bit of irony, Otero House
was the site of a debate last night regarding
whether the U.S. Constitution or Univer
sity policy gives a student the right to use
denigrating language in residence halls.
Opinions differed on the subject during
a panel discussion dealing with free speech,
the First Amendment and the Fundametal
Standard — all issues of year-long debate
in part inaugurated by events at Otero last
spring.
Soto House Resident Fellow John Perry
and Otero Resident Fellow Dennis Matthies
sided against Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole and General Counsel John Schwartz,
who argued that the University should up
hold the First Amendment even though it
is not legally required to.
"When one applies the Fundamental
Standard, one must take into consideration
First Amendment guidelines and principles.
. . . The Fundamental Standard should in
corporate the First Amendment," Schwartz
said.
He added that freedom of expression is
one of the most important rights of our
society that serves to protect people of
diverse backgrounds.

Perry, a philosophy professor, and Mat
thies, a lecturer in the English Department,
both argued that certain uses of denigrating
language should not be allowed.
Perry stated that partially restricting
freedom of speech would not diminish the
effect of the First Amendment, adding that
the University should set up concrete rules
before it starts penalizing students based
on unclear policies.
He also said there is a definite distinction
between expression of opinion and cruel,
hateful attacks directed at individuals or
groups.
On the other hand, Cole expressed the
concern that prohibiting freedom of speech
in prescribed instances would only cause
students to rebel against the Fundamental
Standard and look for exceptions to the
rules.
Cole said she would prefer a distinct
policy regulating general disruption rather
than the Fundamental Standard because
the Fundamental Standard just says "be
have yourself."
Next week, thi Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council will issue a statement attempt
ing to clarify the Fundamental Standard,
after the council consults with different
organizations on campus, including the
ASSU Senate.
