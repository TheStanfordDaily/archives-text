# Stay away from the 'Burbs'
## 
### Mia Manzulli Staff writer 
If you've ever thought of some
day moving to the suburbs, "The
'Burbs" is enough to make you
forget that idea. The neighbors
you'll find in this dreary film will
forever cure you of those dreams
of suburbia.
Meet Raymond and Carol Peter

son (Tom Hanks and Carrie Fis
her). They're your stereotypical
suburban couple — he works, she
minds the house. Only this week
Raymond is on vacation, and he
has way too much time on his
hands.
Tom Hanks spends all his newly
found free time with his neighbor
hood buddies: the local Vietnam
veteran/warmonger (Bruce Dern)
and a food fiend named Art (Rick
Ducommun), both of whom have
overly active imaginations. Along
with a partying teenager played by
Corey Feldman, the men spy on
their neighbors — a creepy trio
with a penchant for digging up
their yard in the middle of the
night, who just moved into the

block's dilapidated haunted house.
Hanks and"the boys" are con
vinced that there are bodies being
buried next door and the disap
pearance of the old man across
the street adds fuel to their im
aginations. So, welcome to the
neighborhood ...
Even Tom Hanks (who lowered
his standards by accepting this
role) can't save this ridiculous
comedy-horror flick. The story is
ludicrous and the ending mis
guidedly twisted. "The 'Burbs" is
aimed at the 13 and under crowd,
and they'll be the only ones laugh
ing during this movie. Save your
money and skip "The 'Burbs." Life
in the city is infinitely more sane.
