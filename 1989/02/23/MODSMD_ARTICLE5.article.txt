# Black Greeks reject liaison proposal
## 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
For several months, the Black Greek
Letter Council has resisted overtures
by the Interfraternity and Intersorority
Councils to promote formal interaction
between their groups and the black com
munity.
A report issued last night at separate
IFC and ISC meetings describes the
process in which the Black Greek Letter
Council rejected an IFC-ISC proposal
to create a liaison position between the
two systems, and the subsequent work
to improve relations with the black com
munity at large.
Members of the IFC originally pro
posed the institution of a new council
position called "liaison to the BGLC"
last quarter, but the new plan met with
opposition from members of the BGLC
itself.
A provision for the liaison to attend
BGLC meetings prompted objections
from BGLC President Kim Coleman,
reflecting the general doubt about the
post.
In a letter to Kappa Sigma Fraternity
member Don Burdette, who authored

the report, Coleman objected to having
a member of the IFC participating in
BGLC meetings, saying the liaison po
sition "is not a necessary or functional
position in regards to the BGLC. . . .
Little [of the] business discussed in
BGLC meeting concerns or regards the
IFC-ISC."
Coleman further objected to the IFC
ISC's willingness to promote relations
with the BGLC but not the entire black
community at large.
"As members of black groups," she
wrote, "we have our own agendas which
include changes and improvements for
each other .. . not waiting around for
white students to show their interest or
approval for our efforts."
Nonetheless, Coleman did write that
she saw the need for more programs
and interaction between the two sys
tems, but said other avenues were
needed.
Despite the initially negative BGLC
reaction to the liaison position, Burdette
said he decided to continue his efforts
to reach out to the black community,
but with a new focus.
A position of "liaison to the black
community" was created at the begin

ning of fall quarter within the IFC and
ISC, yet the post does not attempt to
bridge the separate Greek communities.
The existing liaison is charged with
staying aware of events within the black
community.
"The position is different than I had
envisioned, but it is just as useful,"
Burdette said.
"If I had taken all of the excuses from
them (BGLC) as valid, then I would
have given up a long time ago," he
added. "We can still reach out."
According to Burdette, recent IFC
ISC interest in improved relations with
the black community had been spurred
on by recent racially-oriented events at
Stanford, as well as a realization on the
part of IFC-ISC members that their
minority membership was relatively
low. "We are willing to make a change,
and it may involve changing the atmos
phere."
The report, titled "The Role of Greeks
in the Black Community" also sum
marizes a closed workshop that took
place last December which addressed
the relations between the Greek
systems.
The workshop was held to pro
mote and define the role of the
IFC-ISC in the black community,
and to direct routes to further
understanding of that role. Ap
proximately 60 IFC-ISC members
attended the workshop, including
45 who answered questionnaires
regarding their opinions on
various black and other racial is
sues on campus, and then dis
cussed their responses.
The report presented last night
analyzes the questionnaires
statistically and offers possible in
terpretations of their answers.
Of 45 total responses, 33 an
swered that there is racism in the
Greek system at Stanford. Fifteen
responded that they had encoun

tered overt racism in the Greek
system. Thirty-eight responded
that Greeks should take part in
fighting racism, mostly through
self-education.
Following the discussion, Keith
Archuleta, assistant dean of Stu
dent Affairs who is in charge of
community service at the Black
House, gave a speech about his
conception of Greeks in the black
community. He stated that the
goal of Greek and black commu
nities to deal with each other on
a purely individual level is unre
alistic.
Archuleta advocated co
sponsorship by the groups of ed
ucational and service-oriented
events, such as the workshop, and
called for continued efforts in that
direction.
After reading the report, Mary
Dillard, chair of the Black Student
Union, wrote in a letter to Bur
dette that she was uncertain
about perceptions within the

black community of the IFC fra
ternities.
She wrote, "Many of us cannot
relate to the focus on alcohol as
a means of socializing" in the IFC
and ISC. She added that the black
community is "wary of the
Greeks, especially in light of the
actions by the Phi Delts last
spring."
Last spring, seven members of
the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity
protested the eviction of a student
from Otero House for repeated
homophobic remarks. Wishing not
to be associated with their frater
nity, the members concealed their
identities in a way that some
found similar to the Ku Klux
Klan.
Commenting on the BGLC
resistance, Burdette said, "There
are misunderstandings on both
sides, and I agree with Kim (Cole
man) on the need to self-educate
ourselves, but it does go both
ways."

man) on the need to self-educate
ourselves, but it does go both
ways."
For several months, the Black Greek
Letter Council has resisted overtures
by the Interfraternity and Intersorority
Councils to promote formal interaction
between their groups and the black com
munity.
A report issued last night at separate
IFC and ISC meetings describes the
process in which the Black Greek Letter
Council rejected an IFC-ISC proposal
to create a liaison position between the
two systems, and the subsequent work
to improve relations with the black com
munity at large.
Members of the IFC originally pro
posed the institution of a new council
position called "liaison to the BGLC"
last quarter, but the new plan met with
opposition from members of the BGLC
itself.
A provision for the liaison to attend
BGLC meetings prompted objections
from BGLC President Kim Coleman,
reflecting the general doubt about the
post.
In a letter to Kappa Sigma Fraternity
member Don Burdette, who authored

the report, Coleman objected to having
a member of the IFC participating in
BGLC meetings, saying the liaison po
sition "is not a necessary or functional
position in regards to the BGLC. . . .
Little [of the] business discussed in
BGLC meeting concerns or regards the
IFC-ISC."
Coleman further objected to the IFC
ISC's willingness to promote relations
with the BGLC but not the entire black
community at large.
"As members of black groups," she
wrote, "we have our own agendas which
include changes and improvements for
each other .. . not waiting around for
white students to show their interest or
approval for our efforts."
Nonetheless, Coleman did write that
she saw the need for more programs
and interaction between the two sys
tems, but said other avenues were
needed.
Despite the initially negative BGLC
reaction to the liaison position, Burdette
said he decided to continue his efforts
to reach out to the black community,
but with a new focus.
A position of "liaison to the black
community" was created at the begin

ning of fall quarter within the IFC and
ISC, yet the post does not attempt to
bridge the separate Greek communities.
The existing liaison is charged with
staying aware of events within the black
community.
"The position is different than I had
envisioned, but it is just as useful,"
Burdette said.
"If I had taken all of the excuses from
them (BGLC) as valid, then I would
have given up a long time ago," he
added. "We can still reach out."
According to Burdette, recent IFC
ISC interest in improved relations with
the black community had been spurred
on by recent racially-oriented events at
Stanford, as well as a realization on the
part of IFC-ISC members that their
minority membership was relatively
low. "We are willing to make a change,
and it may involve changing the atmos
phere."
The report, titled "The Role of Greeks
in the Black Community" also sum
marizes a closed workshop that took
place last December which addressed
the relations between the Greek
systems.
The workshop was held to pro
mote and define the role of the
IFC-ISC in the black community,
and to direct routes to further
understanding of that role. Ap
proximately 60 IFC-ISC members
attended the workshop, including
45 who answered questionnaires
regarding their opinions on
various black and other racial is
sues on campus, and then dis
cussed their responses.
The report presented last night
analyzes the questionnaires
statistically and offers possible in
terpretations of their answers.
Of 45 total responses, 33 an
swered that there is racism in the
Greek system at Stanford. Fifteen
responded that they had encoun

tered overt racism in the Greek
system. Thirty-eight responded
that Greeks should take part in
fighting racism, mostly through
self-education.
Following the discussion, Keith
Archuleta, assistant dean of Stu
dent Affairs who is in charge of
community service at the Black
House, gave a speech about his
conception of Greeks in the black
community. He stated that the
goal of Greek and black commu
nities to deal with each other on
a purely individual level is unre
alistic.
Archuleta advocated co
sponsorship by the groups of ed
ucational and service-oriented
events, such as the workshop, and
called for continued efforts in that
direction.
After reading the report, Mary
Dillard, chair of the Black Student
Union, wrote in a letter to Bur
dette that she was uncertain
about perceptions within the

black community of the IFC fra
ternities.
She wrote, "Many of us cannot
relate to the focus on alcohol as
a means of socializing" in the IFC
and ISC. She added that the black
community is "wary of the
Greeks, especially in light of the
actions by the Phi Delts last
spring."
Last spring, seven members of
the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity
protested the eviction of a student
from Otero House for repeated
homophobic remarks. Wishing not
to be associated with their frater
nity, the members concealed their
identities in a way that some
found similar to the Ku Klux
Klan.
Commenting on the BGLC
resistance, Burdette said, "There
are misunderstandings on both
