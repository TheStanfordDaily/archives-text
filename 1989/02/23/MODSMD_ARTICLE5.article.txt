# Black Greeks reject liaison proposal
## 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
For several months, the Black Greek
Letter Council has resisted overtures
by the Interfraternity and Intersorority
Councils to promote formal interaction
between their groups and the black com
munity.
A report issued last night at separate
IFC and ISC meetings describes the
process in which the Black Greek Letter
Council rejected an IFC-ISC proposal
to create a liaison position between the
two systems, and the subsequent work
to improve relations with the black com
munity at large.
Members of the IFC originally pro
posed the institution of a new council
position called "liaison to the BGLC"
last quarter, but the new plan met with
opposition from members of the BGLC
itself.
A provision for the liaison to attend
BGLC meetings prompted objections
from BGLC President Kim Coleman,
reflecting the general doubt about the
post.
In a letter to Kappa Sigma Fraternity
member Don Burdette, who authored

the report, Coleman objected to having
a member of the IFC participating in
BGLC meetings, saying the liaison po
sition "is not a necessary or functional
position in regards to the BGLC. . . .
Little [of the] business discussed in
BGLC meeting concerns or regards the
IFC-ISC."
Coleman further objected to the IFC
ISC's willingness to promote relations
with the BGLC but not the entire black
community at large.
"As members of black groups," she
wrote, "we have our own agendas which
include changes and improvements for
each other .. . not waiting around for
white students to show their interest or
approval for our efforts."
Nonetheless, Coleman did write that
she saw the need for more programs
and interaction between the two sys
tems, but said other avenues were
needed.
Despite the initially negative BGLC
reaction to the liaison position, Burdette
said he decided to continue his efforts
to reach out to the black community,
but with a new focus.
A position of "liaison to the black
community" was created at the begin

ning of fall quarter within the IFC and
ISC, yet the post does not attempt to
bridge the separate Greek communities.
The existing liaison is charged with
staying aware of events within the black
community.
"The position is different than I had
envisioned, but it is just as useful,"
Burdette said.
"If I had taken all of the excuses from
them (BGLC) as valid, then I would
have given up a long time ago," he
added. "We can still reach out."
According to Burdette, recent IFC
ISC interest in improved relations with
the black community had been spurred
on by recent racially-oriented events at
Stanford, as well as a realization on the
part of IFC-ISC members that their
minority membership was relatively
low. "We are willing to make a change,
and it may involve changing the atmos
phere."
The report, titled "The Role of Greeks
in the Black Community" also sum
marizes a closed workshop that took
place last December which addressed
