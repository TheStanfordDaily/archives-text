# USW files for restraining order to prevent ranch worker eviction
## 
### Nathanael Cousins Staff writer 
Amid charges that Webb Ranch manage
ment retaliated against employees attempt
ing to unionize, the United Stanford
Workers filed for a temporary restraining
order in San Mateo County Superior Court
yesterday that would protect workers from
eviction from their homes.
Speaking at a press conference, USW
representative Reuben Sena outlined al
leged ranch plans to force workers out of
their homes as punishment for their efforts
to unionize and their protests against sub
standard working conditions. He also said
the workers' demands had prompted one
ranch manager to physically harass a
worker.
Webb Ranch is a private berry and
vegetable farm located on 250 acres of Uni

versity land just west of Interstate 280 on
Alpine Road.
According to Sena, Webb Ranch employ
ees were asked to pay illegal rental deposits
of $350. For those workers who did not
pay the deposit, managers threatened evic
tion from their ranch-owned housing.
Sena explained that because laborers are
paid the equivalent of $2 per hour after
deductions for housing and taxes, and be
cause housing prices are so high in the
area, ranch workers are caught in a bind.
In addition, ranch laborer Cayetano Soto,
a 21-year-old native of Zitacuaro, Mexico
who has worked at Webb for three years,
said ranch manager Thomas Hubbard phys
ically assaulted him in an incident Wed
nesday morning.
Speaking in Spanish and accenting his
story with cutting hand motions, Soto
said Hubbard grabbed him by the shirt
collar, threw him against a corral fence
and knocked him to the ground.
Soto, whose story was corroborated
by two fellow laborers, said he ap
proached Hubbard to ask about the
recent lack of work for the farm
laborers. According to Sena, Soto was
not injured in the incident, but he "was
very scared and is frightened for his
physical health."
Hubbard could not be reached for
comment yesterday.
Sena and Soto spoke to local media
at noon behind the USW's office, located
near the Toyon eating clubs. About 50
ranch workers and their families held
a red USW banner behind him during
the conference.
In the suit filed yesterday, USW at
torney Jim Eggleston attempted to
prevent the eviction of the laborers who
refused to pay the rental deposit by
requesting a temporary restraining or
der against Webb Ranch. Stanford was
not named in the restraining order.

On Tuesday, USW attorney Jim Eg
gleston filed a class action suit in Su
perior Court against Webb Ranch and
the University. The legal action charges
Webb Ranch with breaching the Em
ployee Housing Act, providing "defec
tive, unsafe and unsanitary" living con
ditions, threatening ranch workers and
illegal retaliatory attempts to force
them out of their housing.
In addition, the suit charges the Uni
versity and Webb Ranch with civil rights
violations, negligence and breach of con
tract. The union seeks an unspecified
amount in damages.
Sena called for "Stanford and (Uni
versity President) Donald Kennedy to
put a stop to this retaliation. What Stan
ford is condoning is an effort to throw
these laborers and their families into
the street because they are trying to
organize.
"We will not tolerate this," said Sena.
"We will do something about it. Stan
ford has done nothing but disclaim re
sponsibility."
The University has maintained that
while it owns the land, it is not directly
responsible for the management tech
niques and employment policies of lessee
Webb Ranch.
Prompted by a Feb. 17 finding of

approximately 60 health and safety vi
olations on the ranch, reported by San
Mateo County inspectors, Stanford at
torney Michael Vartain yesterday said:
"The University is extremely concerned
if there are any health and safety vio
lations occurring. The University will
be ascertaining what Webb Ranch is
doing about the situation."
Vartain noted that the Webb Ranch
debate is a complex legal issue and that
the University was not named in yes
terday's restraining order.
The 1,300-member USW reported
that 49 of 54 current ranch workers
have signed cards petitioning for uni
onization. The union officially made its
request to unionize Webb Ranch Tues
day in a petition to the California
Agricultural Labor Relations Board.
Last Wednesday workers publicized
accusations about poor living conditions
at Webb Ranch and led 25 members of
national and local media on a tour of
their living quarters. Manager Hubbard
called the accusations "absurd," citing
periodic housing checks by San Mateo
County authorities.
Last Tuesday, the union set Feb. 17
as a deadline for University action, but
their deadline passed without response.
