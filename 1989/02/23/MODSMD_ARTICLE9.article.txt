## Inflation rate rises sharply in January Prices up at fastest pace in 2 years 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Consumer prices shot up 0.6
percent last month, their fast
est rise in two years, the gov
ernment said yesterday in a
report that analysts cited as
fresh evidence of entrenched
and accelerating inflation.
Propelled by higher costs for
food, energy and a variety of
other goods and services, the
seasonally adjusted increase in
the Consumer Price Index
doubled the moderate 0.3 per
cent gains of November and De
cember, the Labor Department
said.
January's rise, if it persisted
for 12 months, would amount
to an annual inflation rate of
7.2 percent, a dramatic increase
from the 4.4 percent posted for
both 1988 and 1987.
"Inflation is accelerating,
pure and simple," said econo
mist Allen Sinai of the Boston
Co. "It shows some signs of
lurching out of control. Any
way you cut that report, infla
tion was everywhere."
He predicted the Federal
Reserve Board would respond
by swiftly driving interest rates
higher in an attempt to slow
the economy and dampen in
flationary presures.
Fed Chairman Alan Green
span, testifying before a House
Banking subcommittee yester
day, called January's gain "dis

turbing" and said the rising
prices were probably the result
of accelerating wage increases.
Financial markets fell
sharply as the report and
Greenspan's comments fueled
fears of inflation and rising in
terest rates. The Dow Jones
30-stock average fell 42.50
points, its steepest drop in
more than three months.
"The market is getting a
little bit jittery," said econo
mist Dan Seto of Nikko Secu
rities Co. International Inc. in
New York. "The market will
look for the Fed to put more
pressure on interest rates."
Last month's 0.6 percent in
crease in consumer prices was
the biggest jump since a 0.7
percent rise in January 1987.
Higher prices for fuels,
poultry, fish and eggs, coupled
with a sharp advance in tobacco
prices, accounted for much of
the price acceleration.
Food costs were up 0.7 per
cent and energy costs rose 0.8
percent. Even excluding those
two volatile categories, con
sumer prices were up 0.5 per
cent.
Increased food prices were
attributed in part to after
effects from last summer's
drought, but also to generally
higher costs of doing business,
including rising distribution
and packaging expenses.
