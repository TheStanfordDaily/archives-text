# Back on campus, Shultz hopes for student contact
## Features 
### Amy Rosenfeld Editorial staff 
Although the walls of his office
at the Graduate School of Busi
ness are still bare, George Shultz
— former secretary of state,
part-time professor of interna
tional economics and honorary
Hoover Institution fellow — is
here to stay.
"I'm settled back here and my
wife has got our house all fixed
up," Shultz said in an interview
with The Daily Tuesday. "We
like it here and we'd just as soon
stay."
Shultz, who was a part-time
professor before leaving to be
come President Reagan's secre
tary of state in 1982, said he
plans to spend most of his time
on campus.
As both a Hoover fellow and
a University professor, Shultz
has a firsthand interest in the
tense relations between the two
institutions. "There is a working
affiliation [between the two! and
from my personal standpoint, it
seems to go easily," he said.
Shultz said it takes him
"about four minutes" to walk
from his Business School office
to his office at Hoover.
Besides the physical proximity
of the two, he said he believes
a close academic interchange can
exist.
In discussions with University
professors who also work at Hoo
ver, Shultz said he has discov
ered they share his assessment
that Hoover is "a very congenial
place to do different kinds of pro
fessional work."

Shultz said he hoped the con
troversy over Hoover's exact role
and relation to the University
would "fade."
"It seems to me on the basis
of what I can observe that both
have a lot to contribute to each
other," he said.
Rejection of Reagan library
Another source of controversy
during Shultz's hiatus from
Stanford was the University's
rejection of the proposed Reagan
library in 1987. Shultz expressed
disappointment over the loss of
the library, which will be built
in Ventura County.
"From the standpoint* of a
community of scholars, [it was]
an opportunity to have available
a very extensive set of records
and primary materials about a
period in the history of the
United States where a lot
changed," Shultz said.
Regardless of whether they
agreed with the ideology of the
Reagan administration, his
torians will want to study the
era, he added.
Shultz said that he thought a
university could only benefit
from the availability of such ma
terials and that it was "a great
loss for Stanford to pass up this
opportunity."
A historical record
Shultz said his future plans
may include a seminar in the
Business School's public man
agement program, but his main
project at Stanford will be re
viewing and organizing his ma
terials from his years of govern
ment service.

Shultz said he is still uncer
tain exactly what format this or
ganization will take, but com
mented that he is interested in
creating video tapes or television
documentaries on foreign serv
ice.
Regardless of the form the
work takes, "I will set forth my
own thinking, a piece of data for
historians who will inevitably be
more objective than 1 will be,"
he said.

Interaction with students
While at Stanford, Shultz said
he will be seeking opportunities
to interact informally with stu
dents, though not necessarily in
a classroom setting. "I'm not
going to do Monday, Wednesday
and Friday and correct blue
books and term papers and
things like that," he said.


April Pearson — Daily
Former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz discusses his role
at Stanford and the constantly evolving arena of foreign affairs.
"l like to be around people and
talk," he said. "If they learn some
thing I suppose you could call that
teaching or if I learn something
you could call it teaching."
In the brief time since he re
turned to Stanford, Shultz said
he has been impressed with the
knowledge of students with whom
he has spoken. He said students
seem to be very interested in gov
ernment processes and ways to
improve these processes.
An interest in government is
one "well worth nourishing be
cause the work is fascinating and
the people you associate with in
the foreign service are gifted,"
Shultz said. He added that a
global outlook is important for
students no matter what career
they plan to pursue.
"As far as I can see, Stanford
is doing quite a lot to sponsor an
awareness of what's going on in
the rest of the world," he said.
Shultz cited international stu
dents and faculty and overseas
campuses as examples of this
"world view."
"I was interested to see Stan
ford founding a campus in a
foreign country called Washing
ton, D.C.," he deadpanned, refer
ring to the newly opened
Stanford-in-Washington campus.
This global view helps prepare
students for a world in which
global communication plays an in
creasingly important role.
Because information travels so
rapidly, future leaders will have
to deal with a much more inte
grated world than their predeces
sors, Shultz said.
"We're in . . . an information
said. Things that happen
anywhere are somehow suddenly

relevant everywhere."
Period of positive change
Overall, Shultz said, the past
eight years have been "a period
of basically positive change and
to the extent that I've had a hand
in it, I'm very proud."
However, he was quick to add
that "everything is the product
of many influences."
Shultz began his government
career 35 years ago as a member
of the President's Council of Eco
nomic Advisers. He recalled a
story told to him many years ago
when the council was trying to
get its report out on time:
"Policy in Washington, is sort
of like a log drifting down a river,
and it's covered by ants. They're
all running around wildly on this
log, each one thinking it's steer
ing."
Yet, individual actions and pol
icies can have an important im
pact, Shultz said, adding that he
thought this was true of the
Reagan administration.
Shultz suggested that policies
of the Reagan team would have
a lasting impact on future admin
istrations.
"The evolution of our relation
ship with the Soviet Union has
been a very important develop
ment, and it's had a huge impact,
a big ripple effect all over the
world," he said.
In addition, future U.S. policy
in the Middle East will require
"intense effort," Shultz said. "I
think things have gradually got
ten a little bit better there, but
it's a hard and important area."
A changing world
Since World War 11, the United
States has sought "to create an
open world, create a world that
has a greater respect for the rule
of law, for human rights, for de

'Policy in Washing
ton is sort of like a
log drifting down a
river, and it's cov
ered by ants.

this log, each one
thinking it's steer
ing.'

mocracy," Shultz said.
The world has changed im
mensely in recent decades and "to
a very considerable extent [it has
changed] as a result of the policies
of the United States," he said.
Shultz pointed to the emergence
of Japan and Germany as major
powers and the establishment of
the European Common Market in
1992 as examples of "success on
the part of the policies that the
U.S. and our friends advocated."
The U.S. helped Japan and Ger
many "get up off the floor" after
World War 11, and the European
Common Market was "an idea
which we helped to nourish way
back," Shultz explained.
Although other nations are
emerging as world powers, Shultz
said he doesn't think the United
States is in danger of losing a
tremendous amount of its inter
national influence.
"As others have succeeded, we
too have succeeded," he said. "But
since they have come along very
strongly from way back, our
proportionate importance is not

as great as it once was.
Yet, the United States still ac
counts for 25 percent of the
world's GNP, he added.
"I think the world looks to us
for leadership and we have to give
that leadership increasingly in
terms of working with our friends
and allies," Shultz said. "1 think
. . . we have to foster a notion of
partnership."
'Fun and rewarding' work
Looking back on his service in
government, Shultz said, some
what understated, that "work on

some of these large seminal
developments has been fun and
rewarding."
However, he said the "things
that stand out the most are those
things connected with human
beings."
He remembered one instance in
particular involving a prominent
Soviet refusnik, Ida Nudel. A
refusnik is a Soviet Jew who has
been denied permission to emi
grate by the Soviet government.
Shultz had met with Nudel in
Moscow and her sister in
Jerusalem, but was not receiving
any assurances from Moscow that
Nudel would be allowed to emi
grate. He said, with a smile, that
after she finally was allowed to
emigrate to Israel, Nudel called
him in Washington and said, "I'm
home. I'm in Jerusalem."
Private vs. public life
As a veteran of business and
academia, Shultz said he thought
government benefits from having
people from these areas in its
ranks. These fields give people ex
perience that is relevant and help
ful for government work, he ex
plained.
These people should enter gov
ernment "not just because they
supported the candidate of the day
or because philosophically they
agree with him or her but because

they are competent people and
have something to bring," Shultz
said.
However, as evidenced by the
current focus on ethics in Wash
ington, D.C., conflicts can arise
between individuals' private and
government roles.
"Whenever you have people who
have had a rich life where they've
taken part in a great many things,
they bring experience which is de
sirable," he said.
"You have to take advantage of
that experience on the one hand
and provide some way of separat
ing out any special influence that
may be derived from it,"he added.
When he was appointed secre
tary of state, Shultz was president
of the Bechtel Group Inc., an in
ternational engineering and con
struction firm. Upon joining the
administration, he resigned from
Bechtel.
Since he had been so closely
connected to Bechtel, Shultz
signed a recusal when he entered
office stipulating that if any mat
ters involving his former company
arose, they would be routed to
other people in the State Depart
ment.
"Since I'm no longer in the gov
ernment ... I've learned that lots
of things went on (involving Be
chtel] that I didn't know anything
about," he said.

supported the candidate of the day
or because philosophically they
agree with him or her but because

they are competent people and
have something to bring," Shultz
said.
However, as evidenced by the
current focus on ethics in Wash
ington, D.C., conflicts can arise
between individuals' private and
government roles.
"Whenever you have people who
have had a rich life where they've
taken part in a great many things,
they bring experience which is de
sirable," he said.
"You have to take advantage of
that experience on the one hand
and provide some way of separat
ing out any special influence that
may be derived from it,"he added.
When he was appointed secre
tary of state, Shultz was president
of the Bechtel Group Inc., an in
ternational engineering and con
struction firm. Upon joining the
administration, he resigned from
Bechtel.
Since he had been so closely
connected to Bechtel, Shultz
signed a recusal when he entered
office stipulating that if any mat
ters involving his former company
arose, they would be routed to
other people in the State Depart
ment.
"Since I'm no longer in the gov
ernment ... I've learned that lots
of things went on (involving Be
chtel] that I didn't know anything
about," he said.

Although the walls of his office
at the Graduate School of Busi
ness are still bare, George Shultz
— former secretary of state,
part-time professor of interna
tional economics and honorary
Hoover Institution fellow — is
here to stay.
"I'm settled back here and my
wife has got our house all fixed
up," Shultz said in an interview
with The Daily Tuesday. "We
like it here and we'd just as soon
stay."
Shultz, who was a part-time
professor before leaving to be
come President Reagan's secre
tary of state in 1982, said he
plans to spend most of his time
on campus.
As both a Hoover fellow and
a University professor, Shultz
has a firsthand interest in the
tense relations between the two
institutions. "There is a working
affiliation [between the two! and
from my personal standpoint, it
seems to go easily," he said.
Shultz said it takes him
"about four minutes" to walk
from his Business School office
to his office at Hoover.
Besides the physical proximity
of the two, he said he believes
a close academic interchange can
exist.
In discussions with University
professors who also work at Hoo
ver, Shultz said he has discov
ered they share his assessment
that Hoover is "a very congenial
place to do different kinds of pro
fessional work."

Shultz said he hoped the con
troversy over Hoover's exact role
and relation to the University
would "fade."
"It seems to me on the basis
of what I can observe that both
have a lot to contribute to each
other," he said.
Rejection of Reagan library
Another source of controversy
during Shultz's hiatus from
Stanford was the University's
rejection of the proposed Reagan
library in 1987. Shultz expressed
disappointment over the loss of
the library, which will be built
in Ventura County.
"From the standpoint* of a
community of scholars, [it was]
an opportunity to have available
a very extensive set of records
and primary materials about a
period in the history of the
United States where a lot
changed," Shultz said.
Regardless of whether they
agreed with the ideology of the
Reagan administration, his
torians will want to study the
era, he added.
Shultz said that he thought a
university could only benefit
from the availability of such ma
terials and that it was "a great
loss for Stanford to pass up this
opportunity."
A historical record
Shultz said his future plans
may include a seminar in the
Business School's public man
agement program, but his main
project at Stanford will be re
viewing and organizing his ma
terials from his years of govern
ment service.

Shultz said he is still uncer
tain exactly what format this or
ganization will take, but com
mented that he is interested in
creating video tapes or television
documentaries on foreign serv
ice.
Regardless of the form the
work takes, "I will set forth my
own thinking, a piece of data for
historians who will inevitably be
more objective than 1 will be,"
he said.

Interaction with students
While at Stanford, Shultz said
he will be seeking opportunities
to interact informally with stu
dents, though not necessarily in
a classroom setting. "I'm not
going to do Monday, Wednesday
and Friday and correct blue
books and term papers and
things like that," he said.


April Pearson — Daily
Former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz discusses his role
at Stanford and the constantly evolving arena of foreign affairs.
"l like to be around people and
talk," he said. "If they learn some
thing I suppose you could call that
teaching or if I learn something
you could call it teaching."
In the brief time since he re
turned to Stanford, Shultz said
he has been impressed with the
knowledge of students with whom
he has spoken. He said students
seem to be very interested in gov
ernment processes and ways to
improve these processes.
An interest in government is
one "well worth nourishing be
cause the work is fascinating and
the people you associate with in
the foreign service are gifted,"
Shultz said. He added that a
global outlook is important for
students no matter what career
they plan to pursue.
"As far as I can see, Stanford
is doing quite a lot to sponsor an
awareness of what's going on in
the rest of the world," he said.
Shultz cited international stu
dents and faculty and overseas
campuses as examples of this
"world view."
"I was interested to see Stan
ford founding a campus in a
foreign country called Washing
ton, D.C.," he deadpanned, refer
ring to the newly opened
Stanford-in-Washington campus.
This global view helps prepare
students for a world in which
global communication plays an in
creasingly important role.
Because information travels so
rapidly, future leaders will have
to deal with a much more inte
grated world than their predeces
sors, Shultz said.
"We're in . . . an information
said. Things that happen
anywhere are somehow suddenly

relevant everywhere."
Period of positive change
Overall, Shultz said, the past
eight years have been "a period
of basically positive change and
to the extent that I've had a hand
in it, I'm very proud."
However, he was quick to add
that "everything is the product
of many influences."
Shultz began his government
career 35 years ago as a member
of the President's Council of Eco
nomic Advisers. He recalled a
story told to him many years ago
when the council was trying to
get its report out on time:
"Policy in Washington, is sort
of like a log drifting down a river,
and it's covered by ants. They're
all running around wildly on this
log, each one thinking it's steer
ing."
Yet, individual actions and pol
icies can have an important im
pact, Shultz said, adding that he
thought this was true of the
Reagan administration.
Shultz suggested that policies
of the Reagan team would have
a lasting impact on future admin
istrations.
"The evolution of our relation
ship with the Soviet Union has
been a very important develop
ment, and it's had a huge impact,
a big ripple effect all over the
world," he said.
In addition, future U.S. policy
in the Middle East will require
"intense effort," Shultz said. "I
think things have gradually got
ten a little bit better there, but
it's a hard and important area."
A changing world
Since World War 11, the United
States has sought "to create an
open world, create a world that
has a greater respect for the rule
of law, for human rights, for de

'Policy in Washing
ton is sort of like a
log drifting down a
river, and it's cov
ered by ants.

ing.'

mocracy," Shultz said.
The world has changed im
mensely in recent decades and "to
a very considerable extent [it has
changed] as a result of the policies
of the United States," he said.
Shultz pointed to the emergence
of Japan and Germany as major
powers and the establishment of
the European Common Market in
1992 as examples of "success on
the part of the policies that the
U.S. and our friends advocated."
The U.S. helped Japan and Ger
many "get up off the floor" after
World War 11, and the European
Common Market was "an idea
which we helped to nourish way
back," Shultz explained.
Although other nations are
emerging as world powers, Shultz
said he doesn't think the United
States is in danger of losing a
tremendous amount of its inter
national influence.
"As others have succeeded, we
too have succeeded," he said. "But
since they have come along very
strongly from way back, our
proportionate importance is not

as great as it once was.
Yet, the United States still ac
counts for 25 percent of the
world's GNP, he added.
"I think the world looks to us
for leadership and we have to give
that leadership increasingly in
terms of working with our friends
and allies," Shultz said. "1 think
. . . we have to foster a notion of
partnership."
'Fun and rewarding' work
Looking back on his service in
government, Shultz said, some
what understated, that "work on

some of these large seminal
developments has been fun and
rewarding."
However, he said the "things
that stand out the most are those
things connected with human
beings."
He remembered one instance in
particular involving a prominent
Soviet refusnik, Ida Nudel. A
refusnik is a Soviet Jew who has
been denied permission to emi
grate by the Soviet government.
Shultz had met with Nudel in
Moscow and her sister in
Jerusalem, but was not receiving
any assurances from Moscow that
Nudel would be allowed to emi
grate. He said, with a smile, that
after she finally was allowed to
emigrate to Israel, Nudel called
him in Washington and said, "I'm
home. I'm in Jerusalem."
Private vs. public life
As a veteran of business and
academia, Shultz said he thought
government benefits from having
people from these areas in its
ranks. These fields give people ex
perience that is relevant and help
ful for government work, he ex
plained.
These people should enter gov
ernment "not just because they
supported the candidate of the day
or because philosophically they
agree with him or her but because

they are competent people and
have something to bring," Shultz
said.

and allies," Shultz said. "1 think
. . . we have to foster a notion of
partnership."
'Fun and rewarding' work
Looking back on his service in
government, Shultz said, some
what understated, that "work on

some of these large seminal
developments has been fun and
rewarding."
However, he said the "things
that stand out the most are those
things connected with human
beings."
He remembered one instance in
particular involving a prominent
Soviet refusnik, Ida Nudel. A
refusnik is a Soviet Jew who has
been denied permission to emi
grate by the Soviet government.
Shultz had met with Nudel in
Moscow and her sister in
Jerusalem, but was not receiving
any assurances from Moscow that
Nudel would be allowed to emi
grate. He said, with a smile, that
after she finally was allowed to
emigrate to Israel, Nudel called
him in Washington and said, "I'm
home. I'm in Jerusalem."
Private vs. public life
As a veteran of business and
academia, Shultz said he thought
government benefits from having
people from these areas in its
ranks. These fields give people ex
perience that is relevant and help
ful for government work, he ex
plained.
These people should enter gov
ernment "not just because they
supported the candidate of the day
or because philosophically they
agree with him or her but because

they are competent people and
have something to bring," Shultz
said.
However, as evidenced by the
current focus on ethics in Wash
ington, D.C., conflicts can arise
between individuals' private and
government roles.
"Whenever you have people who
have had a rich life where they've
taken part in a great many things,
they bring experience which is de
sirable," he said.
"You have to take advantage of
that experience on the one hand
and provide some way of separat
ing out any special influence that
may be derived from it,"he added.
When he was appointed secre
tary of state, Shultz was president
of the Bechtel Group Inc., an in
ternational engineering and con
struction firm. Upon joining the
administration, he resigned from
Bechtel.
Since he had been so closely
connected to Bechtel, Shultz
signed a recusal when he entered
office stipulating that if any mat
ters involving his former company
arose, they would be routed to
other people in the State Depart
ment.
"Since I'm no longer in the gov
ernment ... I've learned that lots
of things went on (involving Be
chtel] that I didn't know anything
about," he said.

Although the walls of his office
at the Graduate School of Busi
ness are still bare, George Shultz
— former secretary of state,
part-time professor of interna
tional economics and honorary
Hoover Institution fellow — is
here to stay.
"I'm settled back here and my
wife has got our house all fixed
up," Shultz said in an interview
with The Daily Tuesday. "We
like it here and we'd just as soon
stay."
Shultz, who was a part-time
professor before leaving to be
come President Reagan's secre
tary of state in 1982, said he
plans to spend most of his time
on campus.
As both a Hoover fellow and
a University professor, Shultz
has a firsthand interest in the
tense relations between the two
institutions. "There is a working
affiliation [between the two! and
from my personal standpoint, it
seems to go easily," he said.
Shultz said it takes him
"about four minutes" to walk
from his Business School office
to his office at Hoover.
Besides the physical proximity
of the two, he said he believes
a close academic interchange can
exist.
In discussions with University
professors who also work at Hoo
ver, Shultz said he has discov
ered they share his assessment
that Hoover is "a very congenial
place to do different kinds of pro
fessional work."

Shultz said he hoped the con
troversy over Hoover's exact role
and relation to the University
would "fade."
"It seems to me on the basis
of what I can observe that both
have a lot to contribute to each
other," he said.
Rejection of Reagan library
Another source of controversy
during Shultz's hiatus from
Stanford was the University's
rejection of the proposed Reagan
library in 1987. Shultz expressed
disappointment over the loss of
the library, which will be built
in Ventura County.
"From the standpoint* of a
community of scholars, [it was]
an opportunity to have available
a very extensive set of records
and primary materials about a
period in the history of the
United States where a lot
changed," Shultz said.
Regardless of whether they
agreed with the ideology of the
Reagan administration, his
torians will want to study the
era, he added.
Shultz said that he thought a
university could only benefit
from the availability of such ma
terials and that it was "a great
loss for Stanford to pass up this
opportunity."
A historical record
Shultz said his future plans
may include a seminar in the
Business School's public man
agement program, but his main
project at Stanford will be re
viewing and organizing his ma
terials from his years of govern
ment service.

Shultz said he is still uncer
tain exactly what format this or
ganization will take, but com
mented that he is interested in
creating video tapes or television
documentaries on foreign serv
ice.
Regardless of the form the
work takes, "I will set forth my
own thinking, a piece of data for
historians who will inevitably be
more objective than 1 will be,"
he said.

Interaction with students
While at Stanford, Shultz said
he will be seeking opportunities
to interact informally with stu
dents, though not necessarily in
a classroom setting. "I'm not
going to do Monday, Wednesday
and Friday and correct blue
books and term papers and
things like that," he said.


April Pearson — Daily
Former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz discusses his role
at Stanford and the constantly evolving arena of foreign affairs.
"l like to be around people and
talk," he said. "If they learn some
thing I suppose you could call that
teaching or if I learn something
you could call it teaching."
In the brief time since he re
turned to Stanford, Shultz said
he has been impressed with the
knowledge of students with whom
he has spoken. He said students
seem to be very interested in gov
ernment processes and ways to
improve these processes.
An interest in government is
one "well worth nourishing be
cause the work is fascinating and
the people you associate with in
the foreign service are gifted,"
Shultz said. He added that a
global outlook is important for
students no matter what career
they plan to pursue.
"As far as I can see, Stanford
is doing quite a lot to sponsor an
awareness of what's going on in
the rest of the world," he said.
Shultz cited international stu
dents and faculty and overseas
campuses as examples of this
"world view."
"I was interested to see Stan
ford founding a campus in a
foreign country called Washing
ton, D.C.," he deadpanned, refer
ring to the newly opened
Stanford-in-Washington campus.
This global view helps prepare
students for a world in which
global communication plays an in
creasingly important role.
Because information travels so
rapidly, future leaders will have
to deal with a much more inte
grated world than their predeces
sors, Shultz said.
"We're in . . . an information
said. Things that happen
anywhere are somehow suddenly

relevant everywhere."
Period of positive change
Overall, Shultz said, the past
eight years have been "a period
of basically positive change and
to the extent that I've had a hand
in it, I'm very proud."
However, he was quick to add
that "everything is the product
of many influences."
Shultz began his government
career 35 years ago as a member
of the President's Council of Eco
nomic Advisers. He recalled a
story told to him many years ago
when the council was trying to
get its report out on time:
"Policy in Washington, is sort
of like a log drifting down a river,
and it's covered by ants. They're
all running around wildly on this
log, each one thinking it's steer
ing."
Yet, individual actions and pol
icies can have an important im
pact, Shultz said, adding that he
thought this was true of the
Reagan administration.
Shultz suggested that policies
of the Reagan team would have
a lasting impact on future admin
istrations.
"The evolution of our relation
ship with the Soviet Union has
been a very important develop
ment, and it's had a huge impact,
a big ripple effect all over the
world," he said.
In addition, future U.S. policy
in the Middle East will require
"intense effort," Shultz said. "I
think things have gradually got
ten a little bit better there, but
it's a hard and important area."
A changing world
Since World War 11, the United
States has sought "to create an
open world, create a world that
has a greater respect for the rule
of law, for human rights, for de

ton is sort of like a
log drifting down a
river, and it's cov
ered by ants.

ing.'

mocracy," Shultz said.
The world has changed im
mensely in recent decades and "to
a very considerable extent [it has
changed] as a result of the policies
of the United States," he said.
Shultz pointed to the emergence
of Japan and Germany as major
powers and the establishment of
the European Common Market in
1992 as examples of "success on
the part of the policies that the
U.S. and our friends advocated."
The U.S. helped Japan and Ger
many "get up off the floor" after
World War 11, and the European
Common Market was "an idea
which we helped to nourish way
back," Shultz explained.
Although other nations are
emerging as world powers, Shultz
said he doesn't think the United
States is in danger of losing a
tremendous amount of its inter
national influence.
"As others have succeeded, we
too have succeeded," he said. "But
since they have come along very
strongly from way back, our
proportionate importance is not

as great as it once was.
Yet, the United States still ac
counts for 25 percent of the
world's GNP, he added.
"I think the world looks to us
for leadership and we have to give
that leadership increasingly in
terms of working with our friends
and allies," Shultz said. "1 think
. . . we have to foster a notion of
partnership."
