# Back on campus, Shultz hopes for student contact

Although the walls of his office
at the Graduate School of Busi
ness are still bare, George Shultz
— former secretary of state,
part-time professor of interna
tional economics and honorary
Hoover Institution fellow — is
here to stay.
"I'm settled back here and my
wife has got our house all fixed
up," Shultz said in an interview
with The Daily Tuesday. "We
like it here and we'd just as soon
stay."
Shultz, who was a part-time
professor before leaving to be
come President Reagan's secre
tary of state in 1982, said he
plans to spend most of his time
on campus.
As both a Hoover fellow and
a University professor, Shultz
has a firsthand interest in the
tense relations between the two
institutions. "There is a working
affiliation [between the two! and
from my personal standpoint, it
seems to go easily," he said.
Shultz said it takes him
"about four minutes" to walk
from his Business School office
to his office at Hoover.
Besides the physical proximity
of the two, he said he believes
a close academic interchange can
exist.
In discussions with University
professors who also work at Hoo
ver, Shultz said he has discov
ered they share his assessment
that Hoover is "a very congenial
place to do different kinds of pro
fessional work."

Shultz said he hoped the con
troversy over Hoover's exact role
and relation to the University
would "fade."
"It seems to me on the basis
of what I can observe that both
have a lot to contribute to each
other," he said.
Rejection of Reagan library
Another source of controversy
during Shultz's hiatus from
Stanford was the University's
rejection of the proposed Reagan
library in 1987. Shultz expressed
disappointment over the loss of
the library, which will be built
in Ventura County.
"From the standpoint* of a
community of scholars, [it was]
an opportunity to have available
a very extensive set of records
and primary materials about a
period in the history of the
United States where a lot
changed," Shultz said.
Regardless of whether they
agreed with the ideology of the
Reagan administration, his
torians will want to study the
era, he added.
Shultz said that he thought a
university could only benefit
from the availability of such ma
terials and that it was "a great
loss for Stanford to pass up this
opportunity."
A historical record
Shultz said his future plans
may include a seminar in the
Business School's public man
agement program, but his main
project at Stanford will be re
viewing and organizing his ma
terials from his years of govern
ment service.

Shultz said he is still uncer
tain exactly what format this or
ganization will take, but com
mented that he is interested in
creating video tapes or television
documentaries on foreign serv
ice.
Regardless of the form the
work takes, "I will set forth my
own thinking, a piece of data for
historians who will inevitably be
more objective than 1 will be,"
he said.

Interaction with students
While at Stanford, Shultz said
he will be seeking opportunities
to interact informally with stu
dents, though not necessarily in
a classroom setting. "I'm not
going to do Monday, Wednesday
and Friday and correct blue
books and term papers and
things like that," he said.
