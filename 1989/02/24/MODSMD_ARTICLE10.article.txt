# Maneuvering Stanford toward a multicultural curriculum
## 
### Raoul Mowatt Staff writer 
Despite general approval of
the idea of multicultural educa
tion, a panel of administrators,
faculty and students sharply dis
agreed about Stanford's current
policies in that area Wednesday
night.
Although Stanford cannot im
plement a cohesive multicul
tural curriculum immediately, it
is still acting with all deliberate
speed to offer more courses em
phasizing diverse perspectives,
said Thomas Wasow, dean of
Undergraduate Studies.
But there are a number of
obstacles to multicultural learn
ing, Wasow said. Among these
are the lack of expert faculty to

teach multicultural subjects and
a limited budget that prevents
a more extensive search for such
instructors.
"What we are doing at this
point tends to look more like a
patchwork than any coherent
program," Wasow admitted.
Wasow said he is unsure
about instituting a new require
ment for ethnic or gender
studies distribution require
ment. Such a new requirement
would be controversial, Wasow
added, because it would end one
of the current eight distribution
areas and raise the problem of
which ethnic groups to study.
However, Black Student Un
ion Secretary Louis Jackson
rejected the notion that creating
a new distribution area would

be especially challenging. He
cited the presence of programs
at UC-Berkeley and several
other schools as models for Stan
ford to follow.

compared the start of multicul
tural education to the construc
tion of a house that welcomed
all the world.
"Are we building a world
house and hoping for some way
to express this (in Stanford's
curriculum), or an exclusive
country club?" asked Jackson.
Multicultural education,
Jackson said, requires a part
nership between students,
visionary faculty and an admin
istration eager to hire more mi
nority professors.
