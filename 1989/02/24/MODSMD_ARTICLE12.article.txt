## Committee votes no on Tower 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate
Armed Services Committee voted yes
terday to reject John Tower's nomina
tion as defense secretary, splitting 11-9
along party lines as it handed President
Bush the first mtyor defeat of his ad
ministration.
The decision by the Democratic
controlled committee sends Tower's
nomination to the full Senate with a
recommendation that it be rejected. The
Senate is expected to make a final de
cision next week.
In Tokyo, presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said Bush stands by
the nomination. "We now go to the
floor" of the Senate, Fitzwater declared.
He said the committee had "every
right to look into" allegations which in
cluded reports of heavy drinking and
womanizing. But Fitzwater also com
plained, "We hear vague talk about con
cern about his personal habits and we
think this debate ought to be on a
slightly higher level than that."

If the full Senate should turn down
Tower, a former senator who used to
chair the Armed Services panel, it would
be the first time in history a newly
elected president had suffered a rejec
tion of a nominee to his first Cabinet.
In all, eight Cabinet nominations have
been rejected, the most recent 30 years
ago.
Tower, in a statement, said he was
"obviously disappointed with the out
come of the Senate Armed Services
Committee vote." But the statement
said Tower will continue to work at the
Pentagon "and await the vote of full
Senate on his confirmation."
Before the vote, the panel's chairman,
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said, "The
record of alcohol abuse by the nominee
cannot be ignored." He added, "I have
researched in vain for several weeks for
the point in time when the nominee
sought help."
As for relationships with women,
Nunn said "there were some examples

of his conduct which I find distressing."
Nunn said that was not the basis for
his decision but "added to the cumula
tive body of concern."
On the other side, John Warner of
Virginia, the committee's top-ranking
Republican, said the allegations
amounted only to a "cobweb of fiction
and fantasy."
Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said,
"This committee ought to have the
courage to do what is right." He
shouted, "Perception should not control
this committee — it ought to be the
truth."
Earlier, Sens. Richard Shelby, D-Ala.,
and Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said they
would vote against Tower.
"It is true that about 90 percent of
all the charges (against Tower) have
been garbage. The 10 percent that
remain are of concern to me and many
other members of the committee." said
Sen. James Exon of Nebraska, the
panel's second-ranking Democrat.
