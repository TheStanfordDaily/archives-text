11 killed in Austrian plane crash
VIENNA, Austria (AP) â€” A twin-engine plane
crashed into Lake Constance near the Swiss-
Austrian border yesterday, and all 11 people
aboard were killed, including Austrian Social Af
fairs Minister Alfred Dallinger, officials said.
Dozens of helicopters, boats and a West German
submarine took part in international search ef
forts. Around 6 p.m., seven hours after the crash,
the wreck of the Gulfstream Aerocommander
AC-90 aircraft was found about 260 feet below

the surface, about half a mile from the shore.
Waldemar Marquart, a Swiss investigating
judge, said in an interview on Austrian TV that
the submarine crew made a video film of the
sunken plane to help salvage teams in their efforts
to raise the aircraft today
"On the basis of the (video) pictures it is quite
clear that none of the people on board is still
alive," Marquart said.
Ernst Sperl, a spokesman for the civil aviation
authority, told The Associated Press earlier no
hope of survivors existed.
