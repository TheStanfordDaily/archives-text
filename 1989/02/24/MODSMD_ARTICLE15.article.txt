# Final farewell for Hirohito
## Leaders gather for largest state funeral in modern history 
### 
TOKYO (AP) - The largest
gathering of world leaders in
modern times joined Japan today
in a final farewell to Hirohito, the
emperor-god who was made mor
tal by a disastrous war and died
in January after a reign of 62
years.
The capital, a sprawling me
tropolis of 12 million people, came
to a standstill as 32,000 police
mounted a massive security oper
ation to protect foreign leaders,
including President Bush.
A black hearse carrying the em
peror's lace-draped coffin drove
at 6 mph through central Tokyo
along a four-mile route from the
moated Imperial Palace to the fu
neral site at Shinjuku Imperial
Garden.
Hirohito was to be buried near
the grave of his father, Emperor
Taisho, about 30 miles outside the
city.
Dressed in a black tailcoat,
black gloves and gray trousers,
Hirohito's son, Emperor Akihito,

and a black-veiled Empress Mic
hiko were shielded by umbrellas
from a streaming winter rain as
they left the palace for the funeral
motorcade.
A 21-gun salute boomed from
howitzers, mingling with ancient
court music played on pipes and
drums. Crowds six to 10 deep
watched the motorcade as it
pulled out of the main gate of the
palace, moved across the moat and
along its route.
The path of the 32-car funeral
procession was chosen because of
symbolism and traffic conditions,
according to government sources.
It passed the Diet, or Parliament,
the democratic core of modem
Japan; and the National Stadium,
where the emperor opened the
1964 Summer Olympics and
heralded Japan's postwar re
emergence.
The 13 hours of funeral cere
monies began with two hours of
private Shinto ceremonies
presided over by the 55-year-old

Akihito, who ascended the
Chrysanthemum Throne after his
father's death.
The body of Hirohito, who died
of cancer Jan. 7 at the age of 87,
was encased in an inner wooden
co{Tin and an outer one of metal.
Before the procession, officers
joining the largest security oper
ation in Japanese history checked
cars and patrolled streets in case
of attacks by foreign terrorists or
by Japanese radical groups that
threatened to disrupt the ceremo
nies.
Police in Nagasaki said a letter
containing a bullet aaia death
threat was sont
Mayor Hitoshi Motoakifna, wno
had said Hirohito bore some re
sponsibility for World War fl. The
mayor was in Tokyo for the fu
neral.
Japanese officials say participa
tion by 163 nations make this the
largest state funeral or gathering
of international leaders in modern
history.
