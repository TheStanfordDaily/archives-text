Finding office space
at Stanford is not a zero
sum game, and the Univer
sity should not pretend that it is
when considering the report of
the Bridge Peer Counseling Cen
ter, which justifies the need for
live in counselors.
Responding to the Committee
on Student Organized Spaces's
request for information explain
ing the use of the building,
student supporters of the Bridge
recently submitted a 50-page
report to the committee. Un
fortunately, it appears that the
students' efforts are not being
matched in good faith by Univer
sity officials.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Ramsey-Perez, who co
chairs the University committee,
has publicly commented on the
live in counselors by saying, "I
really question any organization
that needs that kind of support."
The Bridge is not a waste of

space but an integral part of the
campus community that provides
a vital service. Some students in
a high-pressure environment like
Stanford do consider suicide. If
the Bridge has been able to save
lives, then that is justification
enough.
That the University is seri
ously considering taking the
Bridge's space away and giving
it to other student organizations
is troubling, to say the least. If
there is one thing this University
does not lack, it is construction
of new buildings. But the last
time Stanford constructed any
student offices was in 1964.
If the University really cares
about providing adequate space
for students, then it should take
that into consideration as it
develops its priorities and plans
for the next wave of construction.
But, until then, seriously con
sider the report on the Bridge
and seek elsewhere for additional
student office space.
