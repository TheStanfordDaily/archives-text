# Gordon, stay here!

DON'T LET Gordon Chang
go. The imminent depar
ture of Chang to UC-
Irvine for a tenure-track position
represents a serious setback to
efforts to build a truly multicul
tural community here. Chang, a
lecturer in the History Depart
ment, teaches the University's
only Asian-American studies
classes.
Ironically, the announcement
of Chang's decision to accept the
Irvine position came on the same
day that Provost James Rosse
was quoted as saying, "We have
been considerably less successful
in [faculty affirmative action]
than we would like or than we

need to be." Rosse's honesty is
appreciated, but his words sound
hollow in light of the loss of
Chang.
While Stanford took months to
consider the merits of creating a
tenured position in Asian-
American history, a scholar qual
ified enough to gain a tenure
track position in the prestigious
University of California system
was stolen out from under us.
The key decision-makers in fac
ulty hiring owe the community
an explanation as to why we lost
Chang, or — better yet — they
owe the community some fast ac
tion to match Irvine's offer and
keep Chang here.
