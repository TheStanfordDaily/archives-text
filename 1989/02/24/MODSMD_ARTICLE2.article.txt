# New slots, new luck in this year's Draw
## 
### Nathanael Cousins Staff writer 
Two hundred new spaces, a revamped Roble
Hall and a little bit more "randomness and
luck" await undergraduate players in Stan
ford's annual housing lottery this spring, says
the University's housing chief.
The extra 200 undergraduate slots for next
year are due to the relocation of graduate
students into the new Rains Houses apart
ments this year, said Rodger Whitney, director
of University housing, in an interview yester
day.
Whitney is eager to let people know about
new rules of the Draw, scheduled for April
25-28. Next week he's sending out a letter to
remind undergraduate Draw players that the
"returning residence priority" has been
dropped from the rules of the game.
The returning residence priority, which gave
undergraduates one automatic return ticket
into a residence for their junior or senior year,
was axed by Residential Education officials
last spring at the urging of a committee of
students, faculty and staff.
"Overall, the new policy has been very well
received," said Whitney, adding that the sys
tem is now more egalitarian.

rity is the most forceful
principle in the Draw.'

Last year, about 30 percent of undergrad
uates used returning residency to secure
housing. Houses range from 10 to 40 percent
in returning residents, according to Whitney,
depending on their popularity.
A remnant of the returning residence pri
ority is a grandfather clause favoring students
who matriculated while the priority was still
in effect. Students who were freshmen in 1986-
87 or earlier, and those who transferred during
or before 1987-88, will still get a returning
priority.
"Returning residence priority is the most
forceful principle in the Draw," said Whitney.
"It will be interesting to see the effect of its
elimination."
Some Row house residents and students who
lived in popular spots opposed the policy

change, saying returning residency ensured
continuity in programming.
To allay those concerns, Whitney said, some
program leaders, such as Theme Associates,
will still receive the returning priority. How
ever, he said, "sometimes students don't
return to a house just so they can support
the programming."
A seismically braced Roble is one fixed-up
feature slotted back into this spring's under
graduate housing choices. In addition, engi
neering undergraduates will be allowed into
Crothers Hall and one-bedroom apartments
will be set aside for undergraduates in Es
condido Village, Whitney said.
Former residents of Roble will get another
sort of priority, an "alumni priority" that
effectively grants them returning resident
status.
With Roble open, some guest and study
rooms currently used for makeshift housing
will be returned to their original status, and
Manzanita Park trailers will house three
people instead of four. The Alpha Delt house
and several focus houses will probably also
be included in the Draw.
In preparation for the Draw, the housing
office will be giving out information in resi
dences beginning next week.
