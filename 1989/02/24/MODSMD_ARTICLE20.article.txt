## Dinner date in drag 
### 
IT BEGAN INNOCUOUSLY enough
— with the usual brash trading of
dares between my roommate and me.
As I recall, we both were bemoaning our
recent lack of romantic success with the
women of Stanford.
The result of our conversation was the
following agreement — I would buy Jus
tin dinner at a local restaurant if he
dressed up in drag. Justin agreed to the
proposition, and we began to plan the
evening.
The dare was just the kind of thing
we both thought extremely funny. All
week, we shared our little inside joke,
imagining how shocked people would be
by the performance we planned.
Our fellow residents at Whitman House
even got in on the fun when we made
our plans public one day over lunch.
People joked about the "big date." By
Saturday, the appointed evening for the
outing, the event had become quite the
sensation. A laughing group of women
helped Justin into his outfit. The make
up was applied, the hair teased and a
whole new woman was created.
To be honest, Justin did not look very
feminine. His short brown hair and his
mannerisms struggled to fit the role, but
ultimately fell short. But that didn't
really matter because the point was to
shock our fellow diners on that fateful
Saturday evening. If Justin looked too
much like a woman, the whole effort
would be wasted.
Justin and I were clearly enjoying the
attention, with Justin thriving in his role
at the center of the arena. Life is, after

all, largely occupied by the pursuit of
attention.
So off we went to a local Mexican res
taurant. We left Whitman around 8 p.m.
and arrived at the restaurant a few
minutes later. We were immediately
seated at a secluded table for two.
The next 30 minutes were both the
most enlightening and the most embar
rassing in my short life. Throughout our
brief stay, we noticed the stares of the
people around us. This was unwanted
attention, and I tried desperately to
shrink into my chair.
Even though people were not constantly
staring at us, I could not shake the feeling
that they were. The combination of my
self-consciousness and the attitudes of
people around us killed the idea of having
fun during the meal.
That evening, we received the fastest
service I have ever experienced. Our food
was ordered within two or three minutes,
and it showed up on our table almost
immediately. As soon as we had finished
our meal, the waitress took away our
plates. The bill appeared, we paid it and
left the restaurant.
Justin was behind me as we walked to
the door, and I could hear utensils clang
ing as people dropped their food to watch
my roommate. Disdaining furtive, subtle
glances, people blatantly stared. The looks
seemed malicious, as if to say "How dare
you interrupt our meal?" All of this oc
cured in less than 30 minutes, and we
were back at Whitman by 8:30 p.m. with
the distinct impression that we had been
rushed through our meal.

Justin and I talked about the evening
during the ride home. We were amazed
about the turn of events. Both of us
gained incredible respect for openly gay
people who endured similar treatment
daily.
The experience we had might have been
more extreme than that of the average
gay person, and we might have been
overly sensitive. Clearly there is a differ
ence between transvestitism and
homosexuality. But I do think the two
lifestyles involve similar psychological
pressures, as does any behavior com
monly considered deviant.
We interpreted our experiences at the
restaurant, and I think rightly so, as
subtle pressuring by the management to
leave as quickly as possible. We were not
asked to leave, but it was clear that we
were not to linger over our meal. Even
more unbearable were the stares of the
"normal" diners.
I would not take back my actions last
Saturday night; I gained a great deal of
insight into how psychologically torment
ing it can be to live outside what is
considered ordinary.
And I learned how prevalent distaste
for the unknown really is.

more extreme than that of the average
gay person, and we might have been
overly sensitive. Clearly there is a differ
ence between transvestitism and
homosexuality. But I do think the two
lifestyles involve similar psychological
pressures, as does any behavior com
monly considered deviant.
We interpreted our experiences at the
restaurant, and I think rightly so, as
subtle pressuring by the management to
leave as quickly as possible. We were not
asked to leave, but it was clear that we
were not to linger over our meal. Even
more unbearable were the stares of the
"normal" diners.
I would not take back my actions last
Saturday night; I gained a great deal of
insight into how psychologically torment
ing it can be to live outside what is
considered ordinary.
And I learned how prevalent distaste
for the unknown really is.
