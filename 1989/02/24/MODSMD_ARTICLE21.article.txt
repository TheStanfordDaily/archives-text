## University should build more student office space 
### 
I CANNOT SAY I was completely
surprised to read the University's
response to the Bridge Peer Coun
seling Center's 50-page report in the
Feb. 21 article "Report by Bridge
counselors defends the need for live
ins.
As the deputy director of the ASSU
Publications Board â€” the body charged
under the ASSU Constitution with
"... authority over assignment within
the Storke Student Publications Build
ing ..." I have watched as Asst. Dean
of Student Affairs Michael Ramsey-
Perez has systematically tried to devise
a way to allow himself to reallocate
the workspace in the Storke Building
without much consideration for the

publications currently housed there.
Although I sympathize with the
many "homeless" student organizations
on this campus and agree that they
are all deserving of space, I believe
that the elimination of the Bridge's
live-in counselors would only hurt the
Stanford community as a whole.
In spite of his allegation that the
live-ins are "a big waste (of space)"
and reasoning that since "there is no
other crisis hotline in the Bay Area
that provides housing," why should we,
I question where Ramsey-Perez expects
the 50 percent of the clients handled
by the live-ins to go for help after he
gets rid of the live-ins' space.
The mere fact that seven suicidal

students sought the late-night services
of live-ins last quarter would seem
reason enough for any rational person
to leave the Bridge system intact.
Although the many other groups
currently without space on campus all
contribute to the Stanford community,
I seriously doubt if any of them could
have as direct and dramatic an impact
on life at Stanford as the Bridge.
Regardless of what the Committee
on Student Organized Spaces finally
decides to do with the space currently
occupied by the Bridge, perhaps this
would be a good time for the Univer
sity to begin thinking about building
more space to house the growing num
ber of student organizations.

Without the addition of new build
ings, what little space is currently
available is going to be slowly "reall
ocated" into oblivion. As Stanford
approaches the end of its Centennial
Celebration, it would behoove the
University to apply some of the $1.1
billion anticipated to be collected
toward the alleviation of this ever
worsening problem.
The fact that no new student space
has been created since the Storke
Student Publications Building was built
over a quarter of the University's
100-year history ago is a sad reflection
on the University's commitment to the
student community at Stanford.
