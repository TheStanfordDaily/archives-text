# The 						Bridge helps save students' lives
## 
### 
I am appalled at the recent attack
upon the Bridge's use of space for
live-in counselors. I am especially con
cerned by Asst. Dean Of Student Af
fairs Michael Ramsey-Perez's comment
in a Feb. 21 article, "No one is well
served [by the Bridge], and I question
why it is a Stanford priority." This
statement implies a lack of understand
ing of the live-in couselors' role and
the Bridge's impact upon students.
I have used the Bridge's services
three different times, and on each occa
sion I called after normal business
hours, including once at 2 a.m.
The fact that most crises occur at
night does not surprise me. Many
people do not give that much thought
about problems during the day because
classes or errands occupy their minds.
However, at night just prior to going
to bed or after a long period of study
ing, a problem has a way of creeping

in and disrupting the rest of the eve
ning.
Someone going through this process
may need someone to talk to at some
obscure hour, which is why the live-ins
are there. I feel comfortable in saying
that if the Bridge did not have a 24-
hour service, then I would not have
been able to solve my 2 a.m. crisis,
and I would probably be a very differ
ent person now.
The live-ins' importance becomes
even more apparent when problems of
a much more serious nature, such as
suicide, arise. Live-ins received 24
suicide calls last year. What if there
were no live-ins? Would the University
have had 24 unnecessary deaths?
Isn't the Bridge worth having if it
saves even one life? Or are human
lives less important than giving space
to other student organizations? Before
the University decides whether to use
the Bridge space for some other pur
pose, it should think carefully about
these issues.
I believe that saying nobody benefits
from the live-ins is a huge misconcep

tion made without knowing what really
happens at the Bridge, especially late
at night. Once one realizes how many
people live-ins have helped, then one
can see that live-ins surely should be a
Stanford priority.
