# Animal rights class was biased
## 
### 
Even as she attempts in a Feb. 22
viewpoint to defend her objectivity, Lise
Giraud reveals the agenda she brought
to her course, "The Case for Animal
Rights."
One can begin with the course title,
which makes it clear that she intended,
in fact, to build "The Case for Animal
Rights." A title such as "The Question
of Animal Rights" would have left the
instructor's view ambiguous. Given the
title chosen, the students, who all gave
outstanding evaluations, may have also
been slightly self-selected in their own

viewpoints.
Giraud's bias is also revealed by her
characterization of Psychology Prof.
Seymour Levine and his research as
"not justified" and inflicting "anguish
on animals." The invitation of speakers
with opposing views does not hide or
diminish this bias, which she freely
admits when she describes "our asser
tions" on issues of animal rights.
The question, then, becomes whether
an instructor whose sole qualification
is her extreme views (compared to the
rest of society) on a particular issue
can truly lead an unbiased course or
workshop on that issue.
And if it is not unbiased, does such
a course have a place in Stanford's
catalog? I would not pretend to answer
such a difficult question with a simple
"yes" or "no," but I would like to see
the political agendas of such instruc
tors accurately represented so that one
can form a clear opinion on this ques
tion.
