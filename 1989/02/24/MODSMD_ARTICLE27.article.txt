## Cardinal struggles to sink the Ducks 
### Erik Sten Senior staff writer 
Last year about this time, play
ing here at McArthur Court, the
Oregon Ducks handed Stanford
an 80-66 loss that may have cost
the Cardinal a second-place finish
in the Pacific 10 Conference, and
a possible trip to the NCAA Tour
nament.

Last night, with the Cardinal's
spot in the NCAAs almost
guaranteed, the stakes weren't
quite as high. But that didn't mat
ter to the pesky Ducks, who just
about pulled another one off,
slowing the game to a snail's pace
and forcing the Cardinal to claw
its way to a 54-50 win. The victory
moved Stanford's record to 22-5
overall, 13-3 in the Pac-10.
It probably should have been

easier, but having lost the last
two years in McArthur, Stanford
was thankful to leave with the
win.
"It was my first win at Oregon,"
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "And it was a hard
game to win. I was a little sur
prised they would try to slow
down at home, but it was fairly
effective."
What Coach Don Monson's
troops did was hold the ball at
halfcourt for at least the first 20
seconds of each possession. They
did it so well that for the entire
game the Ducks took not a single
shot with more than 20 seconds
showing on the 45-second clock.
As a result, the high-scoring
Cardinal, which averages 78.5
points per game, lost a bit of its
rhythm, and turned the ball over
14 times in very few possessions.
"It's tough," senior guard Terry
Taylor said. "You sort of lose your
aggressiveness just standing there

only two of his three field goal attempts. Licthi had 15 points in the first half, however.
waiting for them to do some
thing."
But as the Cardinal suffered,
so did the Ducks, who coughed
up 14 turnovers of their own.
Twice in the first half, Oregon
threw the ball away right under
neath the basket and gave up op
portunities for uncontested layups
that would have given them the
lead. The Ducks also managed a
field-goal percentage of just .460
on a 23-of-50 shooting night.
The Cardinal was held to 31
shots, but made up for it behind

the shooting of Todd I 'chti and
Scott Meinert, by hitting 18 of
them for a solid .581 percentage.
Stanford converted 16 points at
the line to just three by the Ducks.
A last-minute defensive switch
also helped the Cardinal. With
Oregon's starting point guard
Mike Helms out with a pulled
hamstring, the Ducks were forced
to move 6-foot-6 small forward
Keith Reynolds to guard, and that
left Stanford with a mismatch.
Usually, in the Cardinal's man
to-man defense Lichti would have
drawn the assignment of guarding
Frank Johnson, the Ducks 6-1
shooting guard and leading scorer.
But that would have left Taylor
on the bigger, faster Reynolds.

Yesterday in practice, Mont
gomery decided that would not
work, and went to what's called
a diamond-and-one defense. While
Lichti stayed at the top of the
key, Howard Wright, Eric Reveno
and Andrew Vlahov packed the
middle, and Taylor played
Johnson man-to-man.
On the offensive end, the job
may have tired out Taylor, who
went an uncharacteristic 0-for-3
from the field and finished with
only one point. It did, however,
seem to do the job on Johnson,
who was held to just 10 points,
well below his season average of
17.1
In the first half, the Cardinal
was all Lichti, who scored 15 of

the team's 28 points and shot 7-
for-10 from the field.
"In the first half they were
giving me the outside shot," Lichti
said. "The second half, they got
up on me, and with all their big
guys, there weren't a lot of places
to go."
As a result, Lichti was able to
score only four points in the sec
ond half, and the Cardinal needed
to find some help from other
sources.
Montgomery went to a three
guard offense of Lichti, Taylor and
Meinert. Coming off the bench,
Meinert did exactly what he was
supposed to, going 3-for-4 and
finishing with seven big second
half points. The biggest was a

baseline 3-pointer that gave the
Cardinal a badly needed six-point
cushion with nine minutes to go.
The crowd booed Meinert, who
played high school ball in Oregon,
nearly everytime he touched the
ball. But if anything, the attention
seemed to help the senior.
"It's kind of fun to have the
fans dislike you. It gets you a
little pumped," he said.
In the end, though, it was the
Oregon players who gave the
hometown fans their hardest pill
to swallow. Down by four with
12 seconds to go, the Ducks threw
away a fast-break layup opportu
nity. They then proceeded to steal
the Cardinal's inbounds pass, only
to miss a 2-foot shot.

was all Lichti, who scored 15 of

the team's 28 points and shot 7-
for-10 from the field.
"In the first half they were
giving me the outside shot," Lichti
said. "The second half, they got
up on me, and with all their big
guys, there weren't a lot of places
to go."
As a result, Lichti was able to
score only four points in the sec
ond half, and the Cardinal needed
to find some help from other
sources.
Montgomery went to a three
guard offense of Lichti, Taylor and
Meinert. Coming off the bench,
Meinert did exactly what he was
supposed to, going 3-for-4 and
finishing with seven big second
half points. The biggest was a

baseline 3-pointer that gave the
Cardinal a badly needed six-point
cushion with nine minutes to go.
The crowd booed Meinert, who
played high school ball in Oregon,
nearly everytime he touched the
ball. But if anything, the attention
seemed to help the senior.
"It's kind of fun to have the
fans dislike you. It gets you a
little pumped," he said.
In the end, though, it was the
Oregon players who gave the
hometown fans their hardest pill
to swallow. Down by four with
12 seconds to go, the Ducks threw
away a fast-break layup opportu
nity. They then proceeded to steal
the Cardinal's inbounds pass, only
to miss a 2-foot shot.
Last year about this time, play
ing here at McArthur Court, the
Oregon Ducks handed Stanford
an 80-66 loss that may have cost
the Cardinal a second-place finish
in the Pacific 10 Conference, and
a possible trip to the NCAA Tour
nament.

Last night, with the Cardinal's
spot in the NCAAs almost
guaranteed, the stakes weren't
quite as high. But that didn't mat
ter to the pesky Ducks, who just
about pulled another one off,
slowing the game to a snail's pace
and forcing the Cardinal to claw
its way to a 54-50 win. The victory
moved Stanford's record to 22-5
overall, 13-3 in the Pac-10.
It probably should have been

easier, but having lost the last
two years in McArthur, Stanford
was thankful to leave with the
win.
"It was my first win at Oregon,"
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "And it was a hard
game to win. I was a little sur
prised they would try to slow
down at home, but it was fairly
effective."
What Coach Don Monson's
troops did was hold the ball at
halfcourt for at least the first 20
seconds of each possession. They
did it so well that for the entire
game the Ducks took not a single
shot with more than 20 seconds
showing on the 45-second clock.
As a result, the high-scoring
Cardinal, which averages 78.5
points per game, lost a bit of its
rhythm, and turned the ball over
14 times in very few possessions.
"It's tough," senior guard Terry
Taylor said. "You sort of lose your
aggressiveness just standing there

waiting for them to do some
thing."
But as the Cardinal suffered,
so did the Ducks, who coughed
up 14 turnovers of their own.
Twice in the first half, Oregon
threw the ball away right under
neath the basket and gave up op
portunities for uncontested layups
that would have given them the
lead. The Ducks also managed a
field-goal percentage of just .460
on a 23-of-50 shooting night.
The Cardinal was held to 31
shots, but made up for it behind

the shooting of Todd I 'chti and
Scott Meinert, by hitting 18 of
them for a solid .581 percentage.
Stanford converted 16 points at
the line to just three by the Ducks.
A last-minute defensive switch
also helped the Cardinal. With
Oregon's starting point guard
Mike Helms out with a pulled
hamstring, the Ducks were forced
to move 6-foot-6 small forward
Keith Reynolds to guard, and that
left Stanford with a mismatch.
Usually, in the Cardinal's man
to-man defense Lichti would have
drawn the assignment of guarding
Frank Johnson, the Ducks 6-1
shooting guard and leading scorer.
But that would have left Taylor
on the bigger, faster Reynolds.

Yesterday in practice, Mont
gomery decided that would not
work, and went to what's called
a diamond-and-one defense. While
Lichti stayed at the top of the
key, Howard Wright, Eric Reveno
and Andrew Vlahov packed the
middle, and Taylor played
Johnson man-to-man.
On the offensive end, the job
may have tired out Taylor, who
went an uncharacteristic 0-for-3
from the field and finished with
only one point. It did, however,
seem to do the job on Johnson,
who was held to just 10 points,
well below his season average of
17.1
