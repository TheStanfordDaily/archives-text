## Cardinal struggles to sink the Ducks 
### Erik Sten Senior staff writer 
Last year about this time, play
ing here at McArthur Court, the
Oregon Ducks handed Stanford
an 80-66 loss that may have cost
the Cardinal a second-place finish
in the Pacific 10 Conference, and
a possible trip to the NCAA Tour
nament.

Cardinal 54, Ducks 50

Last night, with the Cardinal's
spot in the NCAAs almost
guaranteed, the stakes weren't
quite as high. But that didn't mat
ter to the pesky Ducks, who just
about pulled another one off,
slowing the game to a snail's pace
and forcing the Cardinal to claw
its way to a 54-50 win. The victory
moved Stanford's record to 22-5
overall, 13-3 in the Pac-10.
It probably should have been

easier, but having lost the last
two years in McArthur, Stanford
was thankful to leave with the
win.
"It was my first win at Oregon,"
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "And it was a hard
game to win. I was a little sur
prised they would try to slow
down at home, but it was fairly
effective."
What Coach Don Monson's
troops did was hold the ball at
halfcourt for at least the first 20
seconds of each possession. They
did it so well that for the entire
game the Ducks took not a single
shot with more than 20 seconds
showing on the 45-second clock.
As a result, the high-scoring
Cardinal, which averages 78.5
points per game, lost a bit of its
rhythm, and turned the ball over
14 times in very few possessions.
"It's tough," senior guard Terry
Taylor said. "You sort of lose your
aggressiveness just standing there
