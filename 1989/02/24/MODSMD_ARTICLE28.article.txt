BEAVER UPDATE — Oregon State, beat California 60-54 last night, has
won five straight to make this game a battle for second place in the
Pac-10. Gary Payton is third in the Pac-10 in scoring average (19.9) and
first in assists average (8.5) and steals average (3.1).
KEYS TO VICTORY — Once again, patience is the needed virtue for the
Cardinal. Oregon State, the league's leader in steals and turnover margin
by wide differentials, will be ready to prey on Stanford's mistakes. Stanford
needs to avoid turnovers and hold Payton somewhat in check.
