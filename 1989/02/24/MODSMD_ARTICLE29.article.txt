# Spikers down No. 10 Aztecs

### John Kirks Staff writer 
Ho hum.
It was, as they say, another day at the office
for the Stanford volleyball team. The 10th
ranked yet obviously inferior San Diego State
Aztecs stepped onto the floor with the Cardinal
last night thinking they might catch the No.
3-ranked Stanford squad on an off night.
It didn't happen.

Cardinal 3, Aztecs 0

The Cardinal, intent on besting its perform
ance of five nights ago against Cal State-
Northridge, dismantled the hapless Aztecs in
the first game and survived a slight charge
by San Diego State in the second before coast
ing to victory in the third. The final tally was
15-6, 15-12, 15-6.
Scott Fortune, maintaining the torrid pace
he has established for himself this season,
checked in with a hitting percentage of .330
at game's end. Duncan Blackman posted an
exemplary .400 percentage, stepping his play
up a notch.
However, very quietly leading the Stanford
hitting corps was Dan Hanan, who had an
exemplary 18 kills for a .467 hitting percent
age.
The Cardinal jumped on the Aztecs from
the opening gun. Before the San Diego State
players could get out of their warmups, Stan
ford was up 14-3. During that initial outburst,
the Cardinal looked extremely crisp.
But from that point on in the match neither
squad looked exceptional as service errors and
shanked passes abounded. Stanford was the
better team, though, and was not to be denied
the victory.
Stanford, not surprisingly, was victorious in
the game of numbers as well. The Cardinal
outhit the Aztecs .327 to .167 and, on the
defensive side of the net, Stanford had 51 digs
compared to San Diego State's 36.
