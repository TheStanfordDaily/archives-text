# USW, Webb Ranch set to negotiate
## 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
In a first sign of reconciliation,
Webb Ranch management told the
United Stanford Workers Wednes
day that it wants to begin dis
cussing housing conditions for
workers on the ranch early next
week, according to USW represen
tatives.
The announcement of negotia
tions comes on the heels of a tem
porary restraining order issued
Wednesday by San Mateo County
Superior Court Judge Clarence
Knight, preventing Webb Ranch
from evicting or harassing ranch
workers.
Knight's order responded to a
class action suit filed Tuesday by
USW attorney James Eggleston,
charging Webb Ranch with
breaching employee housing laws,
civil rights violations, negligence
and breach of contract.
According to Eggleston, the or
der is effective through March 20,
when a hearing on a preliminary
injunction will be held. A prelim
inary injunction is a stronger step
that would restrain Webb Ranch
from evicting workers or harass
ing them prior to a formal trial.
An employee contacted yester
day at Webb Ranch said that the
owner and manager of the ranch,
Stanley Webb and Thomas Hub
bard, were unavailable for com
ment to confirm the USW report.

USW representative Reuben
Serna speculated that Webb
Ranch management's "sudden
change of heart," was due to what
he called public exposure of the
ranch "for running a slave camp
out there."
The negotiations are "a starting
point" and the smartest thing
Webb Ranch has done so far,
Serna said. It "shows some signs
of their wanting to work things
out."
It is unclear whether the Uni
versity, the owner of the land near
Alpine Road and Interstate 280,
will join the two parties at the
bargaining table.
Stanford attorney Michael Var
tain said he was unaware of the
meeting and declined to say
whether the University would be
present if invited by either of the

two sides.
From Serna's perspective, the
University must become involved,
to stop what Webb Ranch is doing,
instead of "burying its head in
the sand." However, the Univer
sity disavows responsibility for
the policies or actions of its lessee,
Webb Ranch.
Webb Ranch managers have
said that their workers' camp is
a model for all others in San
Mateo County.
But San Mateo County Envi
ronmental Health inspector

Leonard Chew said yesterday that
a county inspector examined the
ranch last week and "went
through 12 places and found there
were 70-some-odd things" that vi
olated health and safety regula
tions.
"It's a model compared to
what?" Chew asked.
As a result of the alleged poor
living conditions, ranch workers
have decided to unionize. The
1,300-member USW reported that
49 of the 54 ranch workers have
already petitioned to unionize.
