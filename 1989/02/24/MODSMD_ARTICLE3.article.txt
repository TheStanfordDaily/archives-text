# USW, Webb Ranch set to negotiate
## 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
In a first sign of reconciliation,
Webb Ranch management told the
United Stanford Workers Wednes
day that it wants to begin dis
cussing housing conditions for
workers on the ranch early next
week, according to USW represen
tatives.
The announcement of negotia
tions comes on the heels of a tem
porary restraining order issued
Wednesday by San Mateo County
Superior Court Judge Clarence
Knight, preventing Webb Ranch
from evicting or harassing ranch
workers.
Knight's order responded to a
class action suit filed Tuesday by
USW attorney James Eggleston,
charging Webb Ranch with
breaching employee housing laws,
civil rights violations, negligence
and breach of contract.
According to Eggleston, the or
der is effective through March 20,
when a hearing on a preliminary
injunction will be held. A prelim
inary injunction is a stronger step
that would restrain Webb Ranch
from evicting workers or harass
ing them prior to a formal trial.
An employee contacted yester
day at Webb Ranch said that the
owner and manager of the ranch,
Stanley Webb and Thomas Hub
bard, were unavailable for com
ment to confirm the USW report.

USW representative Reuben
Serna speculated that Webb
Ranch management's "sudden
change of heart," was due to what
he called public exposure of the
ranch "for running a slave camp
out there."
The negotiations are "a starting
point" and the smartest thing
Webb Ranch has done so far,
Serna said. It "shows some signs
of their wanting to work things
out."
