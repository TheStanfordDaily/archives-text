## Cardinal men's gymnastics prepares for busy week 
### 
The difference between gymnastics train
ing and gymnastics competition is that the
mental demands necessary to handle the
latter are much greater than for the former.
By the end of next week, the Stanford
men's gymnasts should not be any more
physically tired than usual, but their mental
sharpness will have weathered four separate
meets. The No. 10 Cardinal competes
tonight, Sunday night, Wednesday and then
again Mar. 3.
Tonight, the competition is at San Jose
State, where Stanford (6-2) should have an
easy time with the Spartans. Sunday night,
No. 11 Michigan will visit Maples Pavilion
and should the Cardinal gymnasts perform
as solidly as they did in Maples last Saturday,
they'll chalk up another win.

At that meet, the Cardinal totaled 277.85
points, a score which will launch them into
one of the nation's top five spots. Collegiate
gymnastics rankings are determined accord
ing to the average score of a team's three
best meets. The latest standings, however,
were compiled according to scores recorded
before last weekend's competitions.
Junior co-captain Adam Forman will
remain sidelined for this weekend's meets
with a shoulder injury. Coach Sadao Hamada
said that Forman has been training, though,
and will soon return to the team at full
strength.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal depth will com
pensate for the absence of Forman and could
lead to a score as high as 280 at Sunday

night's home meet.

Wrestlers ready for Pac-lOs
Stanford wrestlers can forget about their
5-4 record. Steve Yarbrough, Steve Buddie
and Ron Perry can disregard their unde
feated dual meet season. Cardinal Coach
Chris Horpel can put the injury-plagued
season behind him.
Indeed, it all comes down to this — the
Pacific 10 Conference/Western Regionals, a
two-day tournament to be held at Arizona
State Feb. 26-27.
