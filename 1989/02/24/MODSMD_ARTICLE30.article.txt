## Cardinal men's gymnastics prepares for busy week 
### 
The difference between gymnastics train
ing and gymnastics competition is that the
mental demands necessary to handle the
latter are much greater than for the former.
By the end of next week, the Stanford
men's gymnasts should not be any more
physically tired than usual, but their mental
sharpness will have weathered four separate
meets. The No. 10 Cardinal competes
tonight, Sunday night, Wednesday and then
again Mar. 3.
Tonight, the competition is at San Jose
State, where Stanford (6-2) should have an
easy time with the Spartans. Sunday night,
No. 11 Michigan will visit Maples Pavilion
and should the Cardinal gymnasts perform
as solidly as they did in Maples last Saturday,
they'll chalk up another win.

At that meet, the Cardinal totaled 277.85
points, a score which will launch them into
one of the nation's top five spots. Collegiate
gymnastics rankings are determined accord
ing to the average score of a team's three
best meets. The latest standings, however,
were compiled according to scores recorded
before last weekend's competitions.
Junior co-captain Adam Forman will
remain sidelined for this weekend's meets
with a shoulder injury. Coach Sadao Hamada
said that Forman has been training, though,
and will soon return to the team at full
strength.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal depth will com
pensate for the absence of Forman and could
lead to a score as high as 280 at Sunday

night's home meet.

Wrestlers ready for Pac-lOs
Stanford wrestlers can forget about their
5-4 record. Steve Yarbrough, Steve Buddie
and Ron Perry can disregard their unde
feated dual meet season. Cardinal Coach
Chris Horpel can put the injury-plagued
season behind him.
Indeed, it all comes down to this — the
Pacific 10 Conference/Western Regionals, a
two-day tournament to be held at Arizona
State Feb. 26-27.
"My first priority as a coach is to produce
Ail-American wrestlers," said
Horpel. "The only way you can
do that is by getting wrestlers to
the NCAA's. So, the Pac-10 tour
nament is definitely a big, big
competition."
To qualify for the NCAA cham
pionships in March, a wrestler
competing in the Pac-lOs must
place in the top three of his weight
class or be one of the 16 wild-card
wrestlers.
Stanford wrestlers who will
compete in the Pac-10 tournament
include Dave Nowick (wrestling
in the 118 pound weight class),
Mark Forman (126), Josh Lisle
(134), James Dinette (142), Geoff
Baum (150), Matt Nowlis (158),
Yarbrough (167), Buddie (177),
Perry (190) and Trent Smith
(heavyweight).
Yarbrough, Buddie and Perry
should be seeded in the top three
of their respective weight divi
sions. Horpel said that all three
have an excellent shot at becoming
the first Stanford champions in
the tournament since 1986.
Horpel said "For the most part,
we are in the best shape of the
year. We have peaked at the right
time. We'll just have to see what
happens."

Track team travels to
weekend meet at Cal
Stanford will journey to Cali
fornia to compete in the Bay Area
Relays this Saturday at 9 a.m. for
the first meet of the outdoor track
season. With California and
Fresno State the top competition,
honor and pride will be riding on
the outcome.
Stanford will be focusing on its
strengths this weekend. "We're
emphasizing the women's sprints,
men's distance and men's middle
distance relays," Asst. Coach
Scott Chisam said.
The most interesting competi
tion will be the women's sprints,
a competition in which Stanford
will be attempting to overcome a
traditional weakness. This year
freshman standouts Chryste
Gaines and Jackie Edwards, both
of whom beat the 100 meter Stan
ford record during high school,
should turn this around.
Last year, Stanford's women
took only two third-place finishes
in the sprints in a narrow victory
over the Bears at the Stanford-
California dual meet. Stanford
has been working hard to win the
4 X 100 meter and 4 X 200 meter
relays this year.
The men should continue their
dominance in the distance events.
Graduated seniors Marc Olesen
and Steve Schadler will be missed
but Stanford expects to hold off
all challengers in the distance
medley and 4 X 800 meter relays.
Several fifth-year seniors, with
only indoor eligibility, will be
making their final appearances of
their careers at California.
