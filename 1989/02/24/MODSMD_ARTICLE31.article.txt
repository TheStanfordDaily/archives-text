The Stanford women's tennis
team is getting its act together
and taking it on the road.
After five straight meets in the
friendly confines of the Stanford
Tennis Stadium, the Cardinal is
in the Desert State of Arizona to
take on Arizona State today and
No. 17 Arizona tomorrow.
The prospect of facing two top
-20 teams would be daunting to
most squads, but for No. 1-ranked
Stanford the biggest challenge is
to keep focused and make certain
everyone plays up to their ability.
And how able is the Cardinal?
Well . . . Tami Whitlinger, Lisa
Green, Debbie Graham, Teri
Whitlinger, Kylie Johnson, Eleni
Rossides, Cindy Buchsbaum,
Valerie Wilson and Carina Rolley
have lost a total of zero singles

matches between them.
All-American Sandra Birch, no
slouch herself, is 2-1 in singles.
Thus far, the Cardinal has as
sured itself victory in every meet
before the doubles have been
played.
The other variable for the Car
dinal is health. Tami Whitlinger,
Teri Whitlinger, Rossides and
Birch have all missed matches.
