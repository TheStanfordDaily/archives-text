# Steding steps into eager spotlight
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Katy Steding has finally
emerged from the shadows.
Though an All-Pacific 10 Confer
ence selection last season and the
No. 4 Cardinal women's basket
ball team's leading scorer and re
bounder in 1989, the junior has
only now emerged from relative
obscurity to Stanford stardom.
Shadow dwelling, however, has
suited Steding fine. A wild card
in the Stanford offense by position
and playing style, the 6-foot small
forward has spent much of the
season sneaking up on opponents
concentrating on last season's
leading scorer Jennifer Azzi,
prolific power forward Trisha
Stevens and heralded point guard
Sor\ja Henning.
"I wouldn't want to be in Jen
nifer's position, or Trisha's even,
because they have pressure on
them all the time to perform,"
Steding explained. "I look at it
like, 'Yes, I can perform, but 1
don't have to.' 1 want to every
game, that's a given, but if I don't
I always have people who can take
up the slack."
This season, however, those oc
casions have been few. In 21 of
the 22 games the Cardinal has
played to date, Steding has scored
in double figures. Moreover, the
Oregon native has evolved into
the team's top 3-point shooter
(tied with Azzi), improved on her
Stanford-leading rebounding and
picked enough pockets to rank
first in the Pac-10 in steals.
"If you told me last year that
I would be that (a statistical
leader) this year, I wouldn't have
believed you," Steding said,
smiling. "It's very surprising. It
shouldn't be, because all of the
work I've put into it is paying off,
but people tell me things like that
and I'm flabbergasted. I say, 'Are

you sure Jennifer isn't?' "
To the Cardinal coaching staff,
however, Steding's success is no
fluke. When they recruited her in
high school, Coach Tara VanDer
veer and her assistants saw the
makings of a top player in an
athlete almost universally ignored
by even the local schools, Oregon
State and Oregon.
What makes Steding's ac
complishments even more surpris
ing is that she has spent the past
year playing out of position. She
entered Stanford as a power for
ward, accustomed to playing phys
ical post-oriented basketball. With
the signing of Stevens, an
Orcgonian with even stronger in
side moves, VanDerveer gambled
and moved Steding outside.
"In high school, she played with
her back to the basket, and in

her first year at Stanford she
played a post position, a four
I power forward]," VanDerveer
said. "When I went up and saw
Trisha play, I came back and told
Katy, 'Katy, you're a three (small
forward I.' "
As this season affirms, the ex
periment was a total success. After
a summer of constant playing and
hard workouts, Steding worked
out the inconsistencies in her
game and has become the team's
steadiest player.
"1 worked really hard to get my
shot consistent and that's paid off
â€” a little bit," Steding laughed.
"I feel a lot more comfortable
shooting outside, and I know how
to play outside. Last year, I don't
think 1 knew all of the little
things. A year of experience is
always good."
