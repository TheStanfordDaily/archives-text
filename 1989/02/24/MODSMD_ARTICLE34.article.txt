## 
### 
TONIGHT — Oregon State KZSU (90.1 FM). 730 p.m. tipoff at Maples
Pavilion
TOMORROW — Oregon 7:30 p m tipoff at Maples Pavilion.
RECORDS — Stanford (20-2, 12-0 and first in Pac-10 play, ranked fourth
by AP), Oregon State (13 10, 7 6 and fourth), Oregon (17-7, 9-4 and third).
BEAVER UPDATE — The OSU scoring effort this season has been led by
All Pac-10 guard Chelle Flamoe who is averaging 18 4 points per game
and rates in the top 10 in the league in scoring and assists. Her efforts
were not enough last weekend, however, as the Beavers fell to both
Washington and Washington State in Corvallis
DUCK UPDATE — Oregon is on a roll After defeating WSU in overtime
last Friday, the Ducks upset second-place Washington 89-76 The main
reason for the success is 6 foot-7 center Stephanie Kasperski the Pac-10
Player of the Week, who is averaging 20 points and 10 3 rebounds per
game,
CARDINAL UPDATE — Unlike Its Oregon counterparts, Stanford played on
the road last week, defeating California 87-79 at Berkeley Forwards
Trisha Stevens and Katy Steding (both Oregon natives) led the Cardinal
with 19 points, followed by guard Jennifer Azzi s 14 points in the final
eight minutes
KEYS TO VICTORY —Though Oregon State and Oregon are diametrically
opposite, post play will be the key for the Cardinal both nights Against
the pressure-oriented, small and scrappy Beavers, Stanford's forwards
will need to exploit their height advantage to take the burden off of the
challenged perimeter. Tomorrow evening, defense inside will be essential,
as a big game by Kasperski could more than compensate for her weaker
teammates on the outside
