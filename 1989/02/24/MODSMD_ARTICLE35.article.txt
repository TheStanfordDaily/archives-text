Women's Swimming
Cardinal Ist at Pac-10s

By showing no mercy.
After completing its dual meet
season sporting a 6-0 record fol
lowing six blowouts, the Cardinal
jumped out to a big lead after the
first day of competition at the
Pacific 10 Conference Champion
ships.
After five events the Cardinal
has 393 points. California is sec
ond at 272.5, UCLA is third at
259, USC is fourth at 252, Ari
zona State is fifth at 222.5 and
Arizona is sixth at 202. Oregon
State (105), Washington (96) and
Washington State (84) round out
the field.
The best news of the day came
in the morning's qualifying heats.
Swimming in heat No. 7 of the
500-yard freestyle, senior Dana
Anderson and freshman Julie
Martin both qualified for the
NCAA Championships. Anderson
had the second- fastest time of
the qualifying at four minutes,
47.65 seconds, and Martin quali
fied third at 4:48.32.
Stanford haÂ» now qualified 17
swimmers for the meet, the max
imum allowed by the NCAA.
"That was great," Stanford
Coach Richard Quick said. "That
was the highlight of the day. Dana
and Julie bring us up to 17 swim
mers qualified. I'm real pleased
with that."
Anderson, a two-time Ail-
American as a freshman and a
three-time All-American as a
sophomore, broke her wrist last
season and did not make it to
NCAAs. "I'm so glad," she said
yesterday. "There wasn't a doubt
in my mind I'd qualify. ... It was
so smooth. It was like I wasn't
even trying."
Martin recorded her qualifying
time only two miles from her
home in La Palma. "I'm really
excited to go to NCAAs," Martin
said. "It's been really hard be
cause I was sick almost all winter.
I feel like I'm getting my strength
back.... Hopefully I'll do well in
the mile (the 1650 freestyle, to
be swum Saturday)."

After the fine morning, the
team of Susannah Miller, Susan
Johnson, Jenna Johnson and
Aimee Berzins edged California to
win the 200 medley relay. Martin
and Anderson took third and
fourth in the 500 freestyle final
and then Michelle Griglione, Jill
Johnson and Karen Kraemer went
one-three-five in the 200 individ
ual medley. The rout was on.
Berzins, who set a new Pac-10
meet record in the 50 freestyle in
the morning qualifying heat, took
second in the final of the 50. In
the final event of the day, the 800
freestyle relay, Stanford took third
after the Golden Bears were dis
qualified.
"I was real pleased with this
morning," Quick said, "but I was
displeased with tonight.... Well,
we should get better. The 100s
and 200 sin the strokes are our
best events. It should get better."
