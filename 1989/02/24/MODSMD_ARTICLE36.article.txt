# Cardinal nine to begin Six-Pac competition
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Senior staff writer 
Souvenir hounds will have no
luck if they hang around be
hind the outfield wall at either
Evans Diamond or Sunken Dia
mond this weekend. There will
not be many home runs.
But the umpires and uniform
washers will be kept busy with
all the action on the basepaths
as the speedy Stanford baseball
team takes on California, a
squad with a few base stealers
of its own.
The three-game home-and
home series marks the begin
ning of Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division play. With
five of the nine College World
Series champions in the '80s,
the Six-Pac is the toughest col
legiate baseball conference in
the nation.
Stanford comes into the
game with an 8-8 record, its
slowest start since Coach Mark
Marquess took the helm in
1977. While the Cardinal has
faced a tough non-league
schedule in the preseason, most
of the losses can be blamed on
sloppy defense and sleepy bats.
Since the Cardinal has only
hit six homers this season, com
pared with its opponents' 11,
Marquess has used all sorts of
techniques to push runs across
the plate, including suicide
bunts and delayed double
steals. Expect to see more of
that this weekend.
Through 16 games, Stanford
as a team is batting .278 but
the hitting has not been
balanced. Senior second base
man Frank Carey leads the
Cardinal with a .400 batting
average and is playing "the best
offense of his career," accord
ing to Marquess.
Third baseman Tim Griffin,
right fielder Paul Carey and
first baseman/designated hitter
David Holbrook have also
carried the Cardinal offensive
ly, accounting for 30 of the Car
dinal's RBI between them.
At the low end of the batting
totem pole are catchers Eric
Cox and Troy Tallman, and

outfielders Steve Solomon,
Mike Eicher and Eric DeGraw.
There is hope, however, as
Solomon and Tallman, both
freshmen, have shown signs of
adjusting to college pitching
and recently have hit the ball
hard.
California comes into the
game with an 11-2 record due
to fine pitching by junior
Travis Willis and senior Mike
Matthews. The team's pitching
staff enjoys a 2.56 ERA.
Offensively, the Bears are
carried by Todd Mayo and Dar
ryl Vice, who in addition to
batting are also able to burn
up the basepaths. Vice already
has 10 stolen bases on the year.
The Cardinal will have its
two premier starters, sopho
mores Mike Mussina and Stan
Spencer, on the mound in the
first two games. Mussina saw
a fine, complete game outing
go to waste due to two un
earned runs in a 5-3 loss at
UC-Santa Barbara.
Spencer, however, had his
first bad outing of the year
against Santa Barbara, giving
up five earned runs on seven
hits in three innings on the
mound.
The third starter should be
Steve Worrell.
