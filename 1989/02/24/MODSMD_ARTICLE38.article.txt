### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
The Stanford men's tennis team
will get to see exactly how it
matches up with the elite in the
collegiate tennis world this week
end. The National Indoor Team
Championships, which began
Wednesday in Louisville and con
tinues through Sunday, features
19 of the nation's top 20 teams.

"This is a wonderful opportu
nity to see where we stand with
the other teams," Stanford Coach
Dick Gould said. "Of course, the
only tournament that really mat
ters is the one at the end of the
year. . . . Right now we're just
trying to get better each match
we play."
Which isn't to say that the Car
dinal doesn't have a good shot at
taking the title. Stanford, seeded
third behind UCLA and Georgia
despite being ranked ahead of
Georgia in the most recent poll,
opened the tournament yesterday
with a 5-2 win against No. 10

Clemson. Stanford is now 3-0 on
the season and faces No. 14 Ken
tucky today at noon.
The Cardinal almost wrapped
up the match without being forced
to play the doubles but both Jeff
Tarango and Alex O'Brien, play
ing at No. 1 and No. 2 respectively,
dropped third-set tiebreakers, and
the Cardinal took only a 4-2 lead
into the doubles matches.
Not that it mattered: Tarango
and Martin Blackman, playing as
a doubles tandem, quickly
brought the match to a close with
a 6-3, 6-2 pasting of Clemson's
John Sullivan and Mike Watson.
In singles, Tarango, ranked
sixth in the most recent Volvo/In
tercollegiate Tennis Coaches As
sociation poll, lost to Sullivan (No.
7 in the country) 6-3, 1-6, 7-6
(8-6 in the tiebreaker).
O'Brien, who moved up to N0.2
partially on the strength of his
wins over teammates Blackman
and Jeff Cathrall in last week
end's Northern California tourna
ment, was beaten 7-5, 1-6, 7-6 (7-
3) by Vince Van Gelderen.
Stanford had taken the third
through sixth singles matchups
with only the loss of one set.
Blackman, playing at No. 3,
downed Clemson's Todd Watkins

7-5, 6-2 while Cathrall took care
of Owen Casey 6-3, 6-4. Glenn
Solomon had the easiest match of
the day, crushing Greg Seilkop
6-2, 6-2 and Curtis Dunn dis
patched Watson 4-6, 6-4, 6-2.
O'Brien had been enthusiastic
before the Indoors because of the
team's chance to measure up with
the best in the country. "It's going
to be great," he said. "I don't
know if this will tell how we'll do
the rest of the year, but it'll show
where we are right now."
The Cardinal fielded a new dou
bles lineup for yesterday's match
and will continue to do so for the
remainder of the tournament.
Sophomore Dan Turbow, who has
been paired with Cathrall at No.
2 doubles this season, has the flu
and did not make the trip. Eric
Peus took Turbow's spot.
"I was really hoping to see Dan
and Jeff play against some top
flight competition," Gould said.
"We've already seen a lot of Eric
and Jeff â€” we know what they
can do. We need to see how well
Dan and Jeff can do.
"Overall, we're in pretty good
health," Gould continued.
"Tarango still has a sore wrist;
he's been practicing for a week,
but he's still not at full strength."
