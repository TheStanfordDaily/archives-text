# Men swimmers prepare for California
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
The mini showdown is on.
The Cardinal men's swim squad
battles for the Pacific-10 regular
season bragging rights tomorrow
when it faces cross-Bay rival Cal
ifornia. As the teams are tied in
the league standings with 4-0
records, the noon meet in
Berkeley will determine the win
ner of an unblemished conference
record.
Both squads enter the meet
with only one loss on the year,
each having dropped its first dual
competition of the season to the
Michigan Wolverines in January.
Stanford is 5-1 overall while the
Golden Bears post a 9-1 record.
Although the Bears emerged
victorious in the contest a year
ago, the Cardinal had the last
laugh, outpacing California to win
the Pac-10 championships, and
taking third to the Bears' fourth
place finish at NCAA finals.

While both teams have lost key
swimmers to graduation since last
season's meeting, junior freestyler
Doug Lillydahl gives Stanford an
edge.
"Even though Cal has lost some
depth, this weekend is going to
be tougher than we thought. They
have excellent sprinters and free
stylers and Ron Karnaugh is
swimming out of his mind. But
we should pull it out because we
have more depth," Lillydahl said.
While the contest on its face is
the last dual meet of the season,
it is actually a testing ground for
the upcoming championship
meets. The meet will provide an
opportunity not only for Stanford
swimmers to test themselves
against another of the nation's
top teams but also to qualify
swimmers unshaved for NCAA's.
As of yet only four swimmers
— Jay Morternson, Jason Plum
mer, Jeff Rouse and John Witchell
— have posted sub-NCAA stand
ard times. Qualifying unshaved

will give the national champion
ship contender a mental edge
heading into the national finals.
"This is a midway point before
Pac-10's. We've had a litte rest so
we should have a couple people
make cuts because it is a pretty
fast pool," Lillydahl said.
Stanford's corps will have to
content with the likes of Ail-
American Ron Karnaugh, who has
already posted unshaved times
which would have placed him in
last season's NCAA top eight,
American 800 meter freestyle
record-holder Sean Killion and
Olympians Paul Kingsman, Staf
fan Persson and Niko Lahanas.
