Waving a photo of toilets at
Webb Ranch before the Faculty
Senate yesterday, English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz demanded that
the University "seek quick reme
dies to the appalling living condi
tions" of ranch workers.
University President Donald
Kennedy countered that the ad
ministration was responding to
such requests, but "the options
for action may be somewhat lim
ited."
In a lively 10-minute exchange,
Rebholz and Kennedy, sitting just
a few feet apart, debated Webb
Ranch policy before the rest of
the faculty.
Rebholz charged that, since the
ranch is on University property,
the administration should put
more pressure on ranch manage
ment to improve treatment of
their workers.

In the University's defense,
Kennedy said the provisions of
most of the University's leases do
not give Stanford the right to en
force stricter standards than those
mandated by local, state and
federal laws.
Kennedy added that govern
ment agencies recently inspected
the ranch, and the results of those
inspections had not yet been re
leased.
If government officials decide
that the conditions at the ranch
fall below standards, the

operators will be obligated to im
prove them. But if the ranch
meets governmental standards,
the University will consider what
action is appropriate, Kennedy
said.
Speaking dramatically, Ken
nedy said he was unwilling to take
an action that would "get the
problem off our backs" but not
help the workers at the ranch.
Rebholz then suggested that the
University should use its power
as a landlord to put "moral pres
sure" on Webb management.
