# Affirmative Action
## Report encounters guarded optimism 
### Rob Burwell Staff writer 
Stanford has made significant
strides in affirmative action in
recent years, but it's necessary to
keep pressing on.
That was the upshot of reaction
yesterday to the University's an
nual Affirmative Action Report,
discussed in the Faculty Senate
and around campus.
According to University Provost
James Rosse, who released the
report Wednesday, the document
shows that Stanford has become
more diverse, step by step. "Al
though the diversity among un
dergraduates continues to
improve, there is a need to develop
progress [within the faculty] to
go along with the resposibility of
having drawn in a more diverse
student body."
University President Donald
Kennedy assured the senate that
recruiting more black faculty "will
be a high priority." Black faculty
members were the only minority
faculty that lost ground this year,
due to the leaving of five black
professors.
Referring to the lack of black
faculty, Rosse said that this "set
back will be gone soon. There is
more work that can be done, and
we will be successful."
"It is an unfortunate fact of the

world that it takes a long time to
create minority faculty. There are
not enough kids going to graduate
school," Rosse said.
ASSU Senate Chair David
Porter said at the senate meeting
that increasing faculty diversity
requires greater commitment
from individual departments.
"What Kennedy and Rosse are
doing is not enough. The depart
ments are where [hiring] decisions
are made."
Kennedy also said that the Uni
versity is working hard to coun
teract the "lack of minorities in
higher administrative positions."
"I see myself right in the target
zone," Kennedy said, bearing
some responsibility for the lack
of minorities in the administra
tion.
Porter criticized the report's
claim of affirmative action suc
cesses among the staff. He said
women and minorities are locked
into lower positions in the Uni
versity staff — a problem not
highlighted in the report.
Tasha Castaheda, a student rep
resentative to the senate, asked
the faculty to encourage minority
students to continue their studies
in graduate school and consider
teaching careers.
Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions Jean Fetter said, "We have
worked hard, and we're proud of
the progress we have made."
Fetter added, however, that the
faculty-student Committee on Un
dergraduate Admissions and Fi
nancial Aid will have some
challenges for her office in the
near future.
Admissions committee member
Romy Lerner, a senior, said the
committee is considering adding
native Hawaiians to the list of
"targeted minorities."
Lerner also denied a statement
in the affirmative action report
that the committee might con
sider listing Asian-Americans as
a targeted minority, saying they
are "not at all under-represented."
