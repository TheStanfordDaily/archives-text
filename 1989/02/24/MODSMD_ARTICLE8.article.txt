# Faculty Senate juggles bulletin board decision
## 
### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
The fate of an electronic bulle
tin board carrying allegedly racist
jokes will remain unresolved until
at least next Wednesday because
of a lack of communication and
misunderstandings between the
University administration and the
Faculty Senate Steering Commit
tee.
The board contains a controver
sial file called "rec.humor.funny, H
which was shut down in early Jan
uary by Director of Academic In
formation Resources Ralph Gorin.
Since then, 120 Stanford com
puter science experts have criti
cized its closing. Also, the Com
puter Science Department passed
a resolution on Tuesday urging
restoration of the bulletin board.
The issue is currently in the
Steering Committee, and will be
examined in a meeting next Wed
nesday. The committee could
decide to refer the board matter
to another senate committee or
to send it back to the administra
tion.
University President Donald
Kennedy hinted to the senate yes

terday that if the matter is sent
to the administration, it would
decide to stop policing computer
files on campus, effectively allow
ing the board to be replaced. It
would be nearly impossible, he
said, to "patrol an elaborate net
work of computers with contacts
to a number of national net
works."
The issue has bounced back and
forth from the administration to
the committee three times, and
now sits in the committee, leading
Kennedy to joke to the senate yes
terday, "We're not trying to play
volleyball with the senate."
Two weeks ago, Kennedy told
the senate that it should decide
the fate of the board. But the
issue was never actually put on
the senate agenda, creating con
fusion for the steering committee.
According to Academic Secre
tary Arthur Coladarci, the com
mittee decided not to take action
without a specific request and
referred the issue back to the ad
ministration.
Kennedy then suggested that
the matter be sent back to the
committee citing the "strong fac
ulty and academic policy interest."
