Nearly one million Americans will die of heart attacks, strokes and other
cardiovascular diseases this year. That's more than were killed in
World War I and II combined. But you can reduce your risk of cardiovascular
disease by eating a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, controlling your
blood pressure, and not smoking. Do it now. Because in the battle against
cardiovascular disease, it may be do or die.
