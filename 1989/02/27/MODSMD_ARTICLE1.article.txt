# Interpreting the bounds of student conduct
## 
### Goodwin Liu Senior staff writer 
Students at Stanford are expected to show both
within and without the University such respect for
order, morality, personal honor and the rights of
others as is demanded of good citizens. Failure to
do this will be sufficient cause for removal from the
University.
— The Fundamental Standard
Established in 1906 by Stanford's first president
David Starr Jordan, the Fundamental Standard rep
resents a supreme code of conduct for students here.
However vague and open to interpretation it might
be, Jordan's original wording has endured, without
change.
This Wednesday, the Student Conduct Legislative
Council will embark on a lengthy legislative process
to give the first official interpretation of the 83-
year-old Standard. The council — composed of six
faculty, five students and one non-voting adminis
trator — will make public its proposed guidelines
for applying the Fundamental Standard in Wednes
day's Daily and Campus Report.
Until it comes out in print, council members are
reluctant to comment on the substance of their
proposal.
In 1977, the council undertook a similar inter
pretative process with Stanford's other long
standing principle, the Honor Code. Part of this
new interpretation now appears on exam blue books.
Similar to the work in 1977, the present council
hopes to determine "which classes of behavior po
tentially violate the Fundamental Standard — and
why," Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole said in an
interview last Friday.
Council chair George Parker, a professor in the
Graduate School of Business, told The Daily last
week that the council's statement is "an enhance
ment of the Fundamental Standard in the context
of ... cherishing and protecting diversity." The set
of "carefully written" guidelines emphasize "the
importance of both free speech and diversity,"
Parker said.
Prompted by last spring's night vigil at Otero
House, the council convened this fall already seeing
the need to clarify Fundamental Standard guide
lines. "It was very easy to see the agenda," Cole said.
As a judicial officer, Cole is not in the position
to enact legislation that clarifies policies. However,
she is the first to admit that a more specific inter
pretation of the Fundamental Standard would
"greatly improve" her ability to determine what
type of behavior will not be tolerated by the Uni
versity.
"We've got to use the legislative route to clarify
policy so that policy can be applied
judicially," she explained.'
Last spring, Cole cleared seven
students who took part in a night
vigil at Otero from Standard vi
olations. Some community mem
bers believed the incident envoked
images of the Ku Klux Klan.
As with the Otero incident, two
freshman responsible for a
racially-offensive defacement of a
poster this fall were not charged
with a Standard violation. Cole,
who this month decided not to
indict the students in the Ujamaa
House case, said it was not clear
that their actions violated the
University's policies and prac
tices.
Although Cole has officially
closed the book on both incidents,
they stand as the driving force
behind the council's efforts to
clarify the Fundamental Stand
ard.
According to Cole, when the
council's statement is released,
two key questions will arise:
First, are the proposed guide

lines for applying the Fundamen
tal Standard consistent with the
University's commitment to First
Amendment rights?
Second, if the answer to the
first question is "no," then should
the guidelines still be enforced?
Cole said she expects that many
members of the Stanford commu
nity will differ in answering the
two questions, as evidenced by
several opposing papers recently
written concerning free speech, di
versity and student conduct.
While Parker says the guide
lines contain "nothing close to
provocative," Cole noted that
community reaction is difficult to
predict given the sensitivity of the
issue.
While the council makes the ul
timate decisions on key changes
or slight modifications of the
statement, Cole emphasized that
community reaction plays a sig
nificant role in determining
whether the proposed guidelines
should become University policy.
University President Donald
Kennedy, the ASSU Senate, ad
ministrators, faculty and students
all will have ample opportunity
to take part in a lengthy review
process. At the very earliest, the

policy could be enacted by the end
of this school year.
Cole, who has continually urged
community members to write the
council with their opinions, said
the council will strive to formulate
a policy that most community
members can accept, she said.
"It would be extraordinarily
stupid for the University to put
legislation into effect that its own
Legal Office (for example) doesn't
agree with," she said.
The challenge of creating guide
lines for student conduct that
fairly balances diversity and free
speech is not unique to Stanford:
"Almost every campus is doing
what we're doing," Cole said.
"Some (schools) are way behind
us, some are way ahead. No one
is ignoring it."
