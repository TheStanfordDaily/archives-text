# Interpreting the bounds of student conduct
## 
### Goodwin Liu Senior staff writer 
Students at Stanford are expected to show both
within and without the University such respect for
order, morality, personal honor and the rights of
others as is demanded of good citizens. Failure to
do this will be sufficient cause for removal from the
University.
— The Fundamental Standard
Established in 1906 by Stanford's first president
David Starr Jordan, the Fundamental Standard rep
resents a supreme code of conduct for students here.
However vague and open to interpretation it might
be, Jordan's original wording has endured, without
change.
This Wednesday, the Student Conduct Legislative
Council will embark on a lengthy legislative process
to give the first official interpretation of the 83-
year-old Standard. The council — composed of six
faculty, five students and one non-voting adminis
trator — will make public its proposed guidelines
for applying the Fundamental Standard in Wednes
day's Daily and Campus Report.
Until it comes out in print, council members are
reluctant to comment on the substance of their
proposal.
In 1977, the council undertook a similar inter
pretative process with Stanford's other long
standing principle, the Honor Code. Part of this
new interpretation now appears on exam blue books.
Similar to the work in 1977, the present council
hopes to determine "which classes of behavior po
tentially violate the Fundamental Standard — and
why," Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole said in an
interview last Friday.
Council chair George Parker, a professor in the
Graduate School of Business, told The Daily last
week that the council's statement is "an enhance
ment of the Fundamental Standard in the context
of ... cherishing and protecting diversity." The set
of "carefully written" guidelines emphasize "the
importance of both free speech and diversity,"
Parker said.
Prompted by last spring's night vigil at Otero
House, the council convened this fall already seeing
the need to clarify Fundamental Standard guide
lines. "It was very easy to see the agenda," Cole said.
As a judicial officer, Cole is not in the position
to enact legislation that clarifies policies. However,
she is the first to admit that a more specific inter
pretation of the Fundamental Standard would
"greatly improve" her ability to determine what
type of behavior will not be tolerated by the Uni
versity.
"We've got to use the legislative route to clarify
