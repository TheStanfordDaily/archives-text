# Bush winds up five-day Asian tour
## 
### 
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — President
Bush, calling the United States "a faithful
friend and a dependable ally" of South Korea,
said yesterday he has no plans to reduce U.S.
troops stationed in this strife-torn nation, the
last stop on a whirlwind five-day Asian tour.
"They will remain in the Republic of Korea
as long as they are needed and as long as we
believe it is in the interest of peace," Bush
said in remarks prepared for a speech to the
National Assembly.
Bush's visit came amid unusually stringent
security because of a rash of recent anti-
American demonstrations. The president
made no mention of the often-violent protests
in his prepared remarks, but focused on the
history of the U.S. military presence that
Korean radicals want removed.
In 1950, when North Korean forces invaded
the south, "without hesitation or delay, Amer
ican and U.N. forces rushed to your aid. To
gether, Americans and Koreans fought side
by-side for your right to determine your own
future," Bush said.
"I remember the devastation of your coun
try. Your cities lay in rubble. Your factories
were in shambles. Millions of your people
wandered the streets homeless and hungry."
Bush headed here after a two-day visit to
China, whose troops fought on the side of
North Korea in that 1950s conflict. While
in Beijing, the president stressed new, much
improved U.S. relations with China. But his
upbeat visit was marred by China's harass
ment of a leading dissident.
The dissident, astrophysicist Fang Lizhi,

said his efforts to attend a farewell banquet
hosted by Bush were repeatedly frustrated by
police, even though he and his wife had been
invited by the president.

'U.S. troops will remain in
the Republic of Korea as

recent weeks by violent anti-American dem
onstrations as radical students demanded that
the U.S. bases be moved.
A security force 120,000-strong was
mobilized to guard Bush during his five-hour
visit against threats, both from student rad
icals and from North Korean commandos.
In his speech, Bush likened the Korean
National Assembly to the U.S. Congress, "full
of noise, contention and emotion."
"But that is the sound of democracy at
work," he said. "Throughout, let our close
economic and strategic relationship remain as
it is — a pillar of peace in East Asia."
But, while calling Korea a "world class eco
nomic power," Bush cited recent trade fric
tions between the two nations.
He called on South Korea to do more to
lower its barriers to U.S. products, citing the
large U.S. trade deficit with the nation and
declaring: "Protectionism is fool's gold."

However, the main thrust of the president's
remarks dealt with U.S. troops.
"Our most important mission together is
to maintain the freedom and democracy you
fought so hard to win," he said.
"I have come here today as the leader of a
faithful friend and a dependable ally. There
are no plans to reduce U.S. forces in Korea."
"Our soldiers and airmen are there at the
request of the Republic of Korea and their
presence contributes to the peace and stability
of northeast Asia."
Then, he said, another officer prevented
him from walking to the site and when he
attempted to get to the U.S. embassy to com
plain, his taxi was stopped and buses were
prevented from picking him up.
Earlier, Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national
security adviser, said, "There's been a lot of
unrest. There's been an anti-American tone
to some of it."
"One of the reasons the president is going
there is to reassure the South Koreans of our
support for their moves toward democracy
and of the firmness of our strategic relation
ships," Scowcroft said.
Of the incident involving the Chinese dis
sident, Scowcroft said, "The president, of
course, would hope that all of his guests would
be allowed to attend" the U.S.-hosted banquet.
Holding his invitations aloft, he declined to
directly criticize Bush for not raising human
rights issues in his talks with Chinese leaders.
But, he said, the United States shouldn't hold
China to a lesser standard than it holds the
Soviet Union.

in Beijing, the president stressed new, much
improved U.S. relations with China. But his
upbeat visit was marred by China's harass
ment of a leading dissident.
The dissident, astrophysicist Fang Lizhi,

said his efforts to attend a farewell banquet
hosted by Bush were repeatedly frustrated by
police, even though he and his wife had been
invited by the president.

'U.S. troops will remain in
the Republic of Korea as
long as they are needed.'

recent weeks by violent anti-American dem
onstrations as radical students demanded that
the U.S. bases be moved.
A security force 120,000-strong was
mobilized to guard Bush during his five-hour
visit against threats, both from student rad
icals and from North Korean commandos.
In his speech, Bush likened the Korean
National Assembly to the U.S. Congress, "full
of noise, contention and emotion."
"But that is the sound of democracy at
work," he said. "Throughout, let our close
economic and strategic relationship remain as
it is — a pillar of peace in East Asia."
But, while calling Korea a "world class eco
nomic power," Bush cited recent trade fric
tions between the two nations.
He called on South Korea to do more to
lower its barriers to U.S. products, citing the
large U.S. trade deficit with the nation and
declaring: "Protectionism is fool's gold."

However, the main thrust of the president's
remarks dealt with U.S. troops.
"Our most important mission together is
to maintain the freedom and democracy you
fought so hard to win," he said.
"I have come here today as the leader of a
faithful friend and a dependable ally. There
are no plans to reduce U.S. forces in Korea."
"Our soldiers and airmen are there at the
request of the Republic of Korea and their
presence contributes to the peace and stability
of northeast Asia."
Then, he said, another officer prevented
him from walking to the site and when he
attempted to get to the U.S. embassy to com
plain, his taxi was stopped and buses were
prevented from picking him up.
Earlier, Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national
security adviser, said, "There's been a lot of
unrest. There's been an anti-American tone
to some of it."
"One of the reasons the president is going
there is to reassure the South Koreans of our
support for their moves toward democracy
and of the firmness of our strategic relation
ships," Scowcroft said.
Of the incident involving the Chinese dis
sident, Scowcroft said, "The president, of
course, would hope that all of his guests would
be allowed to attend" the U.S.-hosted banquet.
Holding his invitations aloft, he declined to
directly criticize Bush for not raising human
rights issues in his talks with Chinese leaders.
But, he said, the United States shouldn't hold
China to a lesser standard than it holds the
Soviet Union.
