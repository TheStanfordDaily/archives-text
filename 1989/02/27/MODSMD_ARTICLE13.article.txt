### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Defense
Secretary-designate John Tower said yes
terday that he is not an alcoholic and
issued an extraordinary pledge not to
take a single drink if he is confirmed by
the Senate to head the Pentagon.
As Tower defended his reputation in
nationally televised interviews, Senate
Armed Services Committee Chairman
Sam Nunn, D-Ga., accused the White
House of leaking information from the
FBI report on Tower and threatened to
reopen the hearings on the nomination
and subpoena anonymous witnesses
quoted in the agency review.
The committee voted 11-9 along party
lines last Thursday to recommend that
the full Senate reject Tower's nomina
tion, with Nunn citing allegations of ex
cessive drinking by the nominee.
In his first interview since the vote,
Tower denied that he was an alcoholic.

and with his unusual promise sought to
allay fears among his former colleagues
and remove the obstacles to his confir
mation.
The full Senate is expected to take up
the nomination on Wednesday.
"Noting the principal concern of
Senator Nunn and other members of the
Senate relative to my confirmation as
secretary of Defense, namely the extent
to which I may engage in excessive use
of beverage alcohol, let me state that I
have never been an alcoholic nor depen
dent on alcohol," Tower said in a state
ment he read on ABC-TV's "This Week
With David Brinkley."
"I hearby swear and undertake that if
confirmed, during the course of my ten
ure as Secretary of Defense, I will not
consume beverage alcohol of any type or
form, including wine, beer or spirits of
anv kind," he said.

Sam Nunn accused the
White House of leaking
information from the FBI
report and threatened to
reopen the hearings on
the nomination.

Tower distributed copies of the state
ment after reading it on the air. Dated
Saturday, it was signed by Tower and
witnessed by his doctor at Baylor Uni
versity, Dr. Warren Lichliter, and Depart
ment of Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner.
Tower also vowed that if he broke his
pledge not to drink, he would step down.
"I think I'd be obliged to resign if I

broke the pledge. I've never broken a
pledge in my life," said the former Texas
senator.
And following the interview, Tower was
asked whether it would be all right for
reporters to follow him, as they did
former presidential candidate Gary Hart,
whose bid for the presidency was derailed
by his liaison with a part-time model.
"Look, a secretary of defense lives in
a goldfish bowl. If anybody wants to put
a tail on me, they can," Tower said.
In the interview, Tower read a portion
of a letter from Lichliter that said tests
conducted prior to his surgery to remove
a colon polyp found normal liver func
tions and that there was no evidence of
alcohol withdrawal following the opera
tion.
"Based on this fact that can be stated
with relative certainty, Senator Tower
shows no evidence at all of alcoholic im

pairment or alcoholism," the letter said.
In an interview with Cable News Net
work, Tower acknowledged that he was
an excessive drinker during the 1970s
but denied that he had a drinking prob
lem. "Drank to excess. I wouldn't say
that I had a problem. That is to say, I
wasn't hooked on it; I wasn't dependent
on it. I did drink too much," he said.
Tower has been dogged by allegations
of both excessive drinking and womaniz
ing.
But Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole
called Tower's pledge "very, very signif
icant," and urged Democrats and Repub
licans to meet and reassess the nomina
tion.
"My view is it ought to be a new ball
game. We ought to sit down and try to
work it out and spare any hard feelings,"
said Dole as he arrived at National Air
port near Washington.
