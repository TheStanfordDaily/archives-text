# Failed lock suspected in tragedy
## 
### 
HONOLULU (AP) - A failed
lock may have caused a United
Airlines jumbo jet's cargo door to
pop open at 22,000 feet, ripping
a huge hole up the side of the
plane and sending nine passengers
to their deaths, federal inves
tigators say.
Damage to the plane is consis
tent with the cargo door popping
open under pressurization of the
cabin as the jet gained altitude
and atmospheric pressure outside
the aircraft declined, National
Transportation Safety Board in
vestigator Lee Dickinson said at
a late Saturday news conference.
More than 70 investigators, in
cluding 16 from the NTSB,
worked yesterday on finding the
cause of the accident. But the
Coast Guard suspended a sea and
air search 100 miles south of here
after finding more debris from the
plane.
Coast Guard Lt. Brad Nelson
said the search was hampered by
high seas. "There's probably not
a lot more that can be picked up,"
he said.
United Flight 811, carrying 354
people, had taken off Friday for
New Zealand and was about 100
miles from Honolulu when the
fuselage ripped open over the
Pacific Ocean. Nine passengers
were sucked out and are pre
sumed dead.
The pilot lost power in one of
the four engines and shut down
another when a fire indicator light
went on, but the plane returned

safely to Honolulu.
United announced yesterday
that it had begun a series of spe
cial maintenance checks on its
aircraft. United Chairman Step
hen Wolf said the maintenance
checks are "over and above
United's existing procedures and
those required by the Federal Avi
ation Administration."
He also said an FAA-licensed
mechanic will inspect each 747
cargo door after a landing and
will oversee the closing of each
747 cargo door before departures.
The closings have been handled
by ramp personnel, his statement
said. •
Two cutters returned to port
yesterday morning with items re
covered by then, including part of
an overhead compartment, a sec
tion of fuselage and two seats.
Also found were safety instruc
tion cards and personal items in
cluding shoes and a teddy bear,
said Lt. Cmdr. Paul Ellner, a
Coast Guard spokesman.
No bodies have been found, of
ficials said.
Michael Marx, the NTSB's
senior metallurgist, said there was
no evidence that metal fatigue —
weakness caused gradually by
long-term use — caused the hole
in the 18-year-old jet, United's
oldest Boeing 747.
Marx said the hole's edge indi
cated that "overstress" — a stress
greater than the plane could stand
— had been placed on the aircraft,
but he did not say what it might

have been.
"If a door opened in flight, it
could possibly cause overstress,"
Dickinson said in response to a
question. Dickinson added that
the condition could be caused by
other factors he declined to ex
plain.
"It's typical of an overload,"
Marx said.
The hole follows the dimensions
of the cargo door and flares far
ther up the aircraft, Dickinson
said.
The Federal Aviation Adminis
tration in July ordered airlines to
improve cargo door lock systems
on older Boeing 747s after a door
in one plane partly opened in
flight. The deadline for the work
was the end of 1989.
United had inspected all 25 of
its jets covered by the order but
had completed the required mod
ifications on just six by last week,
spokesman Russell Mack said in
Chicago. The plane in last week's
accident was not one of the six,
he said.
Dickinson said the pilot and co
pilot told investigators Saturday
there was no indication of trouble
closing the cargo doors. Dickinson
said a warning light in the cockpit
would have indicated if the doors
were not closed properly.
FBI agents searched the cargo
area with dogs and found no
evidence of explosives, Dickinson
said.

spokesman Russell Mack said in
Chicago. The plane in last week's
accident was not one of the six,

Dickinson said the pilot and co
pilot told investigators Saturday

were not closed properly.
FBI agents searched the cargo
area with dogs and found no
evidence of explosives, Dickinson
said.
