Chicago's Mayoral race heats up
CHICAGO (AP) — Jesse Jackson, Mayor
Eugene Sawyer's most vocal supporter, urges
voters to "maintain the gains" that blacks have
brought to City Hall, but others are predicting
that Chicago could become the first major city
to have a black mayor defeated by a white.
Several variables could alter the result, but
the most likely scenario — according to pundits
and polls — has Richard M. Daley, who is white
and the son of late Mayor Richard J. Daley,
winning tomorrow's Democratic primary and the
April 4 election.
Blacks fear that losing power in City Hall
would erase gains achieved by Harold Washing
ton, the city's first black mayor, who died a few
months into his second term in 1987.
"Of course that fear helps motivate people to
get out the vote," said Robert Starks, professor
of political science at Chicago's Northeastern Il
linois University. Starks is chairman of a task
force on black political power which he said helped
elect Washington in 1983.
"Not only would it be the first loss of a black
mayor, it would also be a loss of the completion
of Harold Washington's last two years in office,"
Starks said. "It would be a tragic loss."
Even if Sawyer managed to win tomorrow and
a newspaper poll a week ago had him gaining
on Daley but still 8 percentage points behind —
it would not guarantee that a black would stay
in Citv Hall.

The GOP candidate in April will be white —
and could be former Washington nemesis Edward
Vrdolyak, who is running a write-in campaign
for the Republican nomination. That candidate
would face Sawyer and third-party candidate
Timothy Evans, a black alderman. A split in the
black vote could put a white in office.
Atlantic storm brings destruction
LISBON, Portugal (AP) — A fierce storm in
the Atlantic Ocean sank or disabled eight ships
yesterday, and rescue workers said eight people
drowned and 25 were missing and presumed
dead. At least 80 people were rescued.
The storm, which battered a wide section of
the Atlantic from Britain to Spain, produced
winds up to 80 mph and 30-foot waves.
In Spain, strong winds knocked over billboards
and blew off parts of roofs, killing five people in
the eastern city of Valencia and two more in
central Valladolid, Spanish National Radio re
ported. A man drowned when his canoe over
turned in the Trasona reservoir in northern
Spain, the radio reported.
Two vessels sank during the storm and one
ran aground.
A Singapore-registered freighter, the Anna
Leonhardt, issued a distress call and sank off
France's Atlantic coast Saturday, and rescue
workers searched fruitlessly yesterday for 14
sailors who were aboard.
