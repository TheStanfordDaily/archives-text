## Policy with teeth? 
### 
The Law School should
not let companies that
discriminate recruit

Stanford Law School makes its
[recruiting] facilities and services
open only to employers who do
not discriminate on the basis of
age, religion, disability, national
origin, gender, race, sexual ori
entation or veteran status.
NOW LAW SCHOOL stu
dents are putting this non
discrimination policy to
the test. A coalition of student
groups is calling on the Law
School to ban the nation's largest
law firm from recruiting on
campus because of the firm's dis
criminatory practices.
This fall, a partner of Baker
& McKenzie, the firm under fire,
made sexist, racist and anti-
Semitic remarks while conduct
ing an interview at another
university. Baker & McKenzie
has confirmed the charges.
Baker & McKenzie was in the
spotlight last year as well and
faced a lawsuit for firing an em
ployee with AIDS. The Law
School continued to allow the
firm to recruit on campus,
despite the fact that 25 Stanford
law students protested the action.
A week later, a Stanford law
student accused another law firm
of racist discrimination. The Law
School allowed the firm to hold
a forum to discuss the accusa
tions before they began recruit
ing. At the forum last year, it
became "quite clear . . . that the
firm screwed up," said Law
School Dean Paul Brest. Soon
after the forum, a modified non

discrimination policy went into ef
fect.
In light of the new charges
against Baker & McKenzie, the
Law School now has an opportu
nity to prove their commitment
to the revised policy. If the Law
School intends to uphold stand
ards of decency and fairness for
recruiters on campus, then the
students' demand for a ban
deserves attention and action.
Baker & McKenzie has a track
record of racist, sexist, anti-
Semitic and homophobic discrim
ination. Their current non-dis
crimination policy is feeble.
And although only one partner
of the firm committed this fall's
racist acts, Baker & McKenzie
should be held responsible for his
actions. The offending partner
has since retired, but it is unclear
whether he did so on his own
initiative or was asked to as a
result of his actions.
By banning Baker & McKenzie
from recruiting on campus for a
year, as major universities, in
cluding Yale University and the
University of Chicago, have al
ready done, Stanford would force
the firm to more carefully think
about what they do and say.
Given that many questions
remain unanswered, the Law
School could follow last year's ex
ample and again hold a forum;
Baker & McKenzie have already
agreed to such a discussion. The
forum would force the firm to
respond to charges and explain
what steps are being taken to
crack down on discriminatory
practices.
The forum could very well im
plicate Baker & McKenzie. If
that's the case, then the one-year
ban should go right into effect.
What good is a non-discrimi
nation policy if it's not enforced?
