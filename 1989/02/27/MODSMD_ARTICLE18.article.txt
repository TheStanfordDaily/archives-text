## Movie review showed condescension and ignorance 
### 
THE DAILY'S Feb. 23 review of
"I'm Gonna Git You, Sucka"
reeks of ignorance, paternalism
and condescension. The reviewer states
that "[writer/director Keenan Ivory
Wayansl is a fresh turn from Spike
Lee, whose outlook on white Hollywood
is bitter and heavy-handed."
Why does the reviewer compare
Wayans to Lee? Could the reason be
that there are similarities in the film
makers' styles that would invite com
parison? Or is it because both Wayans
and Lee are black, and because of the
irrefutable racism in the film industry,
the number of black filmmakers is so
small that one must be compared with
the other?
Certainly, when my black friends and
I discuss a film by a black filmmaker,
we compare it to Spike Lee's films or
to Robert Townsend's. However, the
dearth of black film makers is the
reason that to some, Lee and Town
send seem bitter.
When the people of your race buy 30

percent of the product of an industry,
but you are denied opportunities in
that industry because of your race,
then to speak the truth about that
industry is not to be bitter, but rather
is the only true course.
When reporters asked Spike Lee
(whose movies have not even addressed
white Hollywood, nor white America
for that matter) when he would put
whites in his movies, he replied that
he would do so as soon as Woody Allen
put black people in his movies.
The reviewer might argue that that
illustrates bitterness. I would argue
that the real point is that no reporter
would even think of asking Allen about
the lack of black faces in his films.
Why is it that for people like the
reviewer, when a black person speaks a
truth that makes the white establish
ment look bad, the complaint can so
easily be brushed off, even in the face
of overwhelming evidence, as bitter
ness?
The reviewer compounds insult with
injury when he informs us that this

fresh turn away from the bitterness of
Spike Lee is in Wayans' "goofy" ap
proach to black cinema. It appears that
the reviewer is ready for an executive
position in Hollywood this very min
ute.
After all, it appears that Hollywood's
number one rule concerning blacks is
"always keep 'em laughing ... or
dancing." Perhaps the reviewer would
have been most happy had the actors
in Wayans' movie been whites in black
face. For isn't it true that A 1 Jolsen
and his ilk took the goofiest approach
to black cinema that Hollywood has
ever seen?
Hollywood likes to see black people
being funny, but not black people
being courageous, warm, sexy, com
petent or in love. And when Hollywood
does do a serious movie concerning
blacks, then invariably, the important
conflict is filtered through white eyes.
Witness the recent examples of "Mis
sissippi Burning," "Cry Freedom" and
"A World Apart." I guess had blacks
been more prominent in these 'serious'

movies then the reviewer would have
thought them "bitter and heavy
handed."
Just a couple more points. The
reviewer states "Surprisingly, the gags
are never offensive â€” just goodhearted
jabs at '70s black subculture." Given
the offensive nature of the review, it is
highly unlikely that he would be able
to distinguish good-natured jabs from
offensive stereotyping.
I would also be interested in
knowing where the reviewer gets his
understanding of '70s black subculture,
'70s black overculture or '70s black
anything. From television? Or the
movies? I would venture to say that a
person who understands black culture
so little as to deem its portrayal
worthy only when it is "goofy" has no
business making statements about '70s
black "subculture."
I hope that future reviewers of black
films will have more respect for black
culture.
