# Waitress did not rush couple's meal
## 
### 
As Burke Smith's waitress for his
"Dinner date in drag," I must defend
myself and my restaurant from his
journalistic distortion of the meal in
his Feb. 24 column. Although I realize
that he and his date were indeed the
subject of stares and hushed conversa
tions, his claims against the service
that night are unfair and unwarranted
Smith seems to think that I pur
posely served their food quickly. Well,
it's true. I pride myself on serving hot
food, and could not think of any rea
son not to bring Smith's dinner as

soon as it was ready.
I would like to know exactly how "It
was clear that [they] were not to
linger over [their] meal." I asked if
Smith and his date cared for coffee,
dessert or anything else to end their
meal; they did not. And so, after clear
ing their plates (an acceptable practice
in restaurants), I left the check for
them to pay when they were ready.
I have indeed served openly gay
people and they have received the
same good service that I try to give all
my customers.
I fear that Smith's journalistic zeal
has gotten the best of him. I would
hope that in the future he looks at
situations without preconceived notions
of what may happen. 1 think Smith was

prejudiced against the employees of the
restaurant, and not the other way
around.
