# Homophobia not a 'left-wing' issue
## 
### 
In a recent issue of The Stanford
Review, the Innovative Academic
Courses Program was criticized for
offering "left-wing educational" oppor
tunities that "simply won't impress
employers in the real world."
It was pointed out that the course

"The Politics of Poetry: Lesbian-
Feminist Verse" is listed on official
University transcripts as simply
"Politics of Poetry."
But The Review completely misses
the point. The fact that a student has
to worry about having the word "les
bian" recorded on her transcript is
proof that we are living in a homopho
bic, heterosexist society. The Review
obviously sees nothing wrong with this.
It is a sad comment on this society
that a human issue such as the right
to be respected as a person, no matter
what one's sexual preference, can be so
easily discarded as merely a "left-wing"
concern.
