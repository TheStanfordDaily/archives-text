## Stanford's dating shame 
### 
The frustrated Stanford
couple, a few years ago, found its
epitome in Jane and Leland. These
two characters from a now-defunct comic
strip were Stanford dating incarnate.
They ate outside at Tresidder Union, took
Western Culture classes together and
wore the jeans and top-siders uniform so
popular when I was a freshman.
Most importantly, they liked each other
but never went out.
What makes the typical Stanford stu
dent balk at the idea of a real date? Why
can't a person who can memorize and
recite 30 lines of Old English ask a basic
question? Why do couples form and break
up within dorms and no one outside the
dorm is any wiser?
The evidence is obvious, the reason is
not.
Take, for example, the huge groups
that go to the Sunday Flicks together.
There are couples within these massive
hordes, but they are often too busy fen
ding off paper missiles to do any serious
face-sucking.
Another popular alternative to dating
is, to coin a phrase, Greening. "Would
you like to go study at Green?" is as
close as some guys ever get to asking a
girl out.
A final one is the ever-popular, "Let's
go to Tresidder for fro-yo." Are these
people just cheap or do they not have a
car to go the two miles to a real restau
rant? Whatever the case, this is not a
date.
Fear of rejection may be a big deterrent
to real dating. It is hard to tell somebody
that we like him or her enough to fork

out 40 bucks for an evening. It makes
us vulnerable, and the typical person is
not out for pain. But rejections aren't
really that bad.
There are only three real reasons for
a rejection, and lots of reasons for ac
cepting.
One, the askee is currently dating
someone else. If that is the only reason
for the rejection, the askee should suggest
going out for coffee or something equally
innocuous. If the asker really likes the
askee and is not just out for nookie, then
spending time talking is better than sit
ting home sulking.
Two, the askee really is busy, not just
making an excuse. This leaves the op
portunity for another time, but people
tend to take this as an outright no. It's
not. This is Stanford, people do have
work, but we all need to blow off a little
steam once in a while.
Three, the asker and askee are from
different planets. She likes Guns 'n'
Roses, he likes real music, or vice versa
He's into leather, she prefers Naugahyde.
She's human, he hasn't evolved that far
yet.
When No. 3 happens, just accept it as
fate. If there isn't an attraction, there
most likely never will be one. Try to be
friends, but if this isn't possible, try not
to spit at the parting of the ways.
I'm not really an expert on rejections,
but I do know more about them than
the average bear, and not just because
I've done some rejecting myself.
Over the course of my Stanford career
I have asked 10 guys out. Three of them
said no for various reasons involving

There are couples within
these massive hordes, but
they are often too busy
fending off paper missiles
to do any serious face
sucking.

height differences, the fact that I wear
garlic cloves around my neck at night
and my unnatural obsession with squir
rels.
I had great times with the other seven,
and all 10 are still my friends.
Asking people out on a date tells them
that someone finds them desirable.
That's not an insult, and if they are put
off by it, then they're probably Naug
ahyde-variety and should be avoided any
way. Most people seem to enjoy the im
plicit compliment, and after all, a movie's
a movie.
So what's the big deal? Is it fear of
rejection or just mob instinct? Or perhaps
it's some darker, more sinister reason I
haven't explored yet. If I remember cor
rectly, people don't date in "Invasion of
the Body Snatchers" either.

One, the askee is currently dating
someone else. If that is the only reason
for the rejection, the askee should suggest
going out for coffee or something equally
innocuous. If the asker really likes the
askee and is not just out for nookie, then
spending time talking is better than sit
ting home sulking.
Two, the askee really is busy, not just
making an excuse. This leaves the op
portunity for another time, but people
tend to take this as an outright no. It's
not. This is Stanford, people do have
work, but we all need to blow off a little
steam once in a while.
Three, the asker and askee are from
different planets. She likes Guns 'n'
Roses, he likes real music, or vice versa
He's into leather, she prefers Naugahyde.
She's human, he hasn't evolved that far
yet.
When No. 3 happens, just accept it as
fate. If there isn't an attraction, there
most likely never will be one. Try to be
friends, but if this isn't possible, try not
to spit at the parting of the ways.
I'm not really an expert on rejections,
but I do know more about them than
the average bear, and not just because
I've done some rejecting myself.
Over the course of my Stanford career
I have asked 10 guys out. Three of them
said no for various reasons involving

There are couples within

fending off paper missiles

sucking.

height differences, the fact that I wear
garlic cloves around my neck at night
and my unnatural obsession with squir
rels.
I had great times with the other seven,
and all 10 are still my friends.
Asking people out on a date tells them
that someone finds them desirable.
That's not an insult, and if they are put
off by it, then they're probably Naug
ahyde-variety and should be avoided any
way. Most people seem to enjoy the im
plicit compliment, and after all, a movie's
a movie.
So what's the big deal? Is it fear of
rejection or just mob instinct? Or perhaps
it's some darker, more sinister reason I
haven't explored yet. If I remember cor
rectly, people don't date in "Invasion of
the Body Snatchers" either.
