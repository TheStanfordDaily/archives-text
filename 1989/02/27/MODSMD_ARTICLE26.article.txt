The following letter ran
on the front page of The
Daily under the headline
"Campus Women Ask For
More Room on Steps":
"Because many other girls
have had the same difficulty,
I ask you to allow me to
make a suggestion in the
columns of your paper.
"A few months ago you
published an editorial, tell
ing the girls to stay away
from the law steps, because
by tradition, they belong to
the men.
"The girls did as they were
requested and went up and
down other steps, where
upon some men decided to
take possession of the now
more interesting ones. At
present the men are at
tempting to monopolize all
the steps. Many women are
not anxious to be criticized
by a group of men, who have
nothing else to do and are
therefore compelled to walk
a long distance out of their
way.
"I should like to suggest
that if the men need to con
gregate between classes that
they limit their meeting
places to those given them
by tradition."

The Stanford Daily
As part of a continuing
aeries at Tresidder Union on
sexual ethics, Dr. Paul Ram
sey, a professor of religion
from Princeton University,
stressed the importance of
the "moral bond" of mar
riage as a prerequisite for
procreation.
Ramsey's speech, "The
Marriage of Adam and Eve,"
asserted that procreation is
"creation for God" and be
yond the control of mere
human beings.
Each woman "makes a
man Adam and each man
makes a woman Eve," Ram
sey said. God created Eve
for the purpose of commu
nication on equal terms,
Ramsey said, adding that
woman was an "improve
ment even paradise needed."
