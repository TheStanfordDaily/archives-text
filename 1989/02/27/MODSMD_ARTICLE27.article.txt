# What to do if it ever happens to you: Talley urges proper practice of dating procedures
## 
### Dan Mendelsohn Staff writer 
According to local legend, Stan
ford students have only one thing
on their minds, but not on their
agendas — sex. The allegedly poor
dating scene on campus continues
to prompt almost as many com
plaints as Wilbur Food Service.
Enter Jerry Talley. A former
professor in the Sociology depart
ment, Talley now teaches a dorm
based class called "The Etiquette
of Sex."
A bearded, spectacled individual
who stands 6-foot-7, Talley is cer
tainly one of the tallest authorities
on relationships to be found on
campus.
His one-unit course emphasizes
role-playing, putting students in
situations that are "very common
situations for any sexually active
adult," Talley explains.
According to Talley, one main
benefit of the course is that it
allows students to practice skills
necessary in relationships. "Most
students can noodle through al
most anything, but they might
not be able to do it on Friday
night with the person that they're
involved with where it matters.
So I give them a chance to practice
on Wednesday night," Talley says.
The opportunity for students to
experiment with their techniques
also helps prevent bruised egos,
Talley explains.
"People get a chance to stumble
when it doesn't hurt as much, to
try something out. If you've never
been real smooth at asking some
one out, you get a chance to see
how five other folks do it and a

chance to practice your own
style."
Talley says he is somewhat
mystified by the great number of
Stanford men and women who are
complaining about their lack of
opportunities to practice their
own style.
"What's intriguing to me is that

the women are hearing the men
complain about not having more
opportunities, the men are
hearing the women complain
about not having more opportu
nities, and nobody seems to hear
the message, which is, 'I'm ready.'
"It's like everyone is waiting
for someone else to start."

Talley says he often discusses
what would be a "workable first
date" in the class. He recalls a
freshman several years ago who
spent $300 for a limousine, dinner
and a nightclub in the city in
order to impress his date.
"All he did was make her hor
ribly nervous," Talley says.
"Sometimes the best first dates
are the simplest: go for a walk,
take a study break, get some fro
yo. They're the easiest kinds of
encounters. People have made the
first date into something so
awkward they can't do it any
more."
In addition to having observed
the campus as part of the faculty
for many years, Talley also has
his own experience as a Stanford
student to draw upon as a basis
for giving relationship advice.
He first came to Stanford as a
freshman in 1963.
"Stanford in the '60s was a little
strange," Talley says. "This was
just before the sexual revolution,
I suppose. All the dorms were
either all-male or all-women. In
that sense, all the distinctions
seemed clearer. The women were
over there, and the men were over
there, and there were lots of bar
riers in between — house moth
ers, and lots of rules."
The abundance of rules, how
ever, left less room for uncertain
ty, Talley says.
"There was some clarity about
the rules," he says. "We all knew
what you did on a first date. We
were probably nervous about it,
but we all knew what to do, and
it worked."
Today, however, there seems to

be a lot more confusion about
what the rules are, Talley says.
"I hear an enormous amount of
confusion and ambiguity. People
just don't know what to do," he
says. "They're not sure how to
ask somebody out. They're not
sure whether or not she should
ask him out or he should ask her:
'Who pays?'; 'Should I open the
door for her?'; 'Do I have to bring
a condom?' "
In addition to their confusion,
lovelorn Stanford students seem
to be hindered by time con
straints, Talley says.
At Stanford, "the amount of
task-focus, and the pressure to do
well and perform well has been
allowed to slop over into the arena
of relationships," he says. "So we
get people who treat relationships
like a four-unit class. 'I've already
got 18, I can't take 22, so I can't
have a relationship,' " he says.
Talley says he believes Stanford
students "miss all kinds of excel
lent opportunities because their
criteria are crazy," he says.
"The world is not going to work
if everyone is running around
looking for a 'tall, leggy, gorgeous
blond' or a 'well-tanned, muscled
Adonis.' The fact is that most of
us are going to be relatively nor
mal folks, looking for relation
ships with relatively normal
folks."
According to Talley, "the bot
tom line is that a major task for
people here is to practice, which
means going out and stumbling
and doing it now, rather than
doing it when you're 32."
"You're going to have to go out
and take some chances."

criteria are crazy," he says.
"The world is not going to work
if everyone is running around
looking for a 'tall, leggy, gorgeous
blond' or a 'well-tanned, muscled
Adonis.' The fact is that most of
us are going to be relatively nor
mal folks, looking for relation
ships with relatively normal
folks."
According to Talley, "the bot
tom line is that a major task for
people here is to practice, which
means going out and stumbling
and doing it now, rather than
doing it when you're 32."
"You're going to have to go out
and take some chances."

A former Stanford student and a former member of the Sociology
Department, Jerry Talley presently teaches a dorm-based class on
"The Etiquette of Sex."
According to local legend, Stan
ford students have only one thing
on their minds, but not on their
agendas — sex. The allegedly poor
dating scene on campus continues
to prompt almost as many com
plaints as Wilbur Food Service.
Enter Jerry Talley. A former
professor in the Sociology depart
ment, Talley now teaches a dorm
based class called "The Etiquette
of Sex."
A bearded, spectacled individual
who stands 6-foot-7, Talley is cer
tainly one of the tallest authorities
on relationships to be found on
campus.
His one-unit course emphasizes
role-playing, putting students in
situations that are "very common
situations for any sexually active
adult," Talley explains.
According to Talley, one main
benefit of the course is that it
allows students to practice skills
necessary in relationships. "Most
students can noodle through al
most anything, but they might
not be able to do it on Friday
night with the person that they're
involved with where it matters.
So I give them a chance to practice
on Wednesday night," Talley says.
The opportunity for students to
experiment with their techniques
also helps prevent bruised egos,
Talley explains.
"People get a chance to stumble
when it doesn't hurt as much, to
try something out. If you've never
been real smooth at asking some
one out, you get a chance to see
how five other folks do it and a

chance to practice your own
style."
Talley says he is somewhat
mystified by the great number of
Stanford men and women who are
complaining about their lack of
opportunities to practice their
own style.
"What's intriguing to me is that

the women are hearing the men
complain about not having more
opportunities, the men are
hearing the women complain
about not having more opportu
nities, and nobody seems to hear
the message, which is, 'I'm ready.'
"It's like everyone is waiting
for someone else to start."

Talley says he often discusses
what would be a "workable first
date" in the class. He recalls a
freshman several years ago who
spent $300 for a limousine, dinner
and a nightclub in the city in
order to impress his date.
"All he did was make her hor
ribly nervous," Talley says.
"Sometimes the best first dates
are the simplest: go for a walk,
take a study break, get some fro
yo. They're the easiest kinds of
encounters. People have made the
first date into something so
awkward they can't do it any
more."
In addition to having observed
the campus as part of the faculty
for many years, Talley also has
his own experience as a Stanford
student to draw upon as a basis
for giving relationship advice.
He first came to Stanford as a
freshman in 1963.
"Stanford in the '60s was a little
strange," Talley says. "This was
just before the sexual revolution,
I suppose. All the dorms were
either all-male or all-women. In
that sense, all the distinctions
seemed clearer. The women were
over there, and the men were over
there, and there were lots of bar
riers in between — house moth
ers, and lots of rules."
The abundance of rules, how
ever, left less room for uncertain
ty, Talley says.
"There was some clarity about
the rules," he says. "We all knew
what you did on a first date. We
were probably nervous about it,
but we all knew what to do, and
it worked."
Today, however, there seems to

be a lot more confusion about
what the rules are, Talley says.
"I hear an enormous amount of
confusion and ambiguity. People
just don't know what to do," he
says. "They're not sure how to
ask somebody out. They're not
sure whether or not she should
ask him out or he should ask her:
'Who pays?'; 'Should I open the
door for her?'; 'Do I have to bring
a condom?' "
In addition to their confusion,
lovelorn Stanford students seem
to be hindered by time con
straints, Talley says.
At Stanford, "the amount of
task-focus, and the pressure to do
well and perform well has been
allowed to slop over into the arena
of relationships," he says. "So we
get people who treat relationships
like a four-unit class. 'I've already
got 18, I can't take 22, so I can't
have a relationship,' " he says.
Talley says he believes Stanford
students "miss all kinds of excel
lent opportunities because their
criteria are crazy," he says.
