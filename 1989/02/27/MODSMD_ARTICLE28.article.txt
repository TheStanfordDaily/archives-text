# Katchadourian ponders intellectualism and sexuality
## 
### Alexander Edmonds 
In the past decade, nearly
12,000 Stanford students have
made Prof. Herant Katchadouri
an's "Human Sexuality" class a
part of their Stanford education.
More than just the course title
has kindled such interest.
A psychiatry professor who also
teaches in the Human Biology
program, Katchadourian was
raised in Lebanon and educated
in Beirut and the United States.
He came to Stanford in 1966 and
over the past 23 years has served
as University ombudsman, dean
of Undergraduate Studies and
vice provost of undergraduate ed
ucation.
As a pioneer in the field of

sexuality and the author of six
books and numerous articles,
Katchadourian has had a distin
guished career in cross-cultural
psychiatry and other areas of re
search. Yet, he says he has always
found time to do what he loves

PROF-ile

most — teaching.
The energy he brings to his
work and his wit in the lecture
hall have won Katchadourian
much affection among Stanford
students — five times they have
elected him outstanding professor
and Senior Class Day speaker.
In 1985, Katchadourian wrote

a book on intellectualism and
careerism among college students.
The book divides students into
four categories — intellectuals,
careerists, strivers and the uncon
nected.
The composition of each group,
Katchadourian says, is influenced
by such factors as class, gender
and parental pressure. For exam
ple, careerists tend to come from
the middle class, are heavily pres
sured by their parents to succeed
and are twice as likely to be male,
he says.
On the contrary, intellectuals
often come from a more affluent
backround with females outnum
bering males 2-to-l.
As for the intellectual atmos

phere at Stanford, Katchadourian
remarks that he thinks many stu
dents feel inhibited about express
ing intellectual ideas and often
strive for the appearance of
achievement without effort. How
ever, he says he believes there is
less pretentiousness at Stanford
than at other schools.
But, Katchadourian adds with
a smile, he is so attached to this
place and to his students that he
really cannot be an impartial
judge.
This year, in addition to
"Human Sexuality," Katchadour
ian is teaching a seminar on adult
hood, a discussion section of the
Great Works track in Western
Culture and part of the Human
Biology core next quarter.
