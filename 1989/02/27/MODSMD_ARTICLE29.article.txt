## Card traps Beavers after a nailbiter up north 
### Erik Sten Senior staff writer 
CORVALLIS, Ore. - The
Beavers had a pair of shots to win
this one, but they didn't go in,
and thanks to that bit of good
fortune, Stanford held on Satur
day and upended the Beavers BO
SS. T he win clinched second place
in the Pacific 10 Conference for
the Cardinal, and moved the
team's record to 14-3, 23-5 over
all.

Through the course of the
game, the lead changed hands 10
times. Thirteen times the score
was tied. Finally, with 41 seconds
to go, Stanford was up by one
and the Beavers had the ball at
halfcourt.
Oregon State Coach Ralph Mil
ler decided to go for one final
shot, and for nearly 30 seconds,
the Beaver guards played catch
while a capacity crowd waited on
the edge of its seats.
At last, OSU's Eric Knox drove
toward the basket, ducked under
Terry Taylor's arms and threw
up an off-balance 8-footer. He
missed, but the rebound went to
his backcourt mate, Gary Payton,
who was wide open on the
baseline.
Who knows why, but instead of
going to the basket, the star guard
shot a hurried fadeaway that
rattled out of the rim. Freshman
Adam Keefe grabbed one of the
biggest rebounds of his career,
and the Cardinal proved once
again that it deserves its national
ranking.
"That's the type of shot you
expect a great player like Payton
to make," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said of the last
second shot. "But we'll take it.
We've had some good fortune
along with some great play from
our kids."
Miller, for his part, didn't
second-guess the strategy. "All we
wanted to do was take the clock

down and get a shot up, and have
a chance for a rebound, which we
got," he said.
It was a game Stanford won
the hard way. Playing its third
road game in six days, the Car
dinal was understandably a bit
tired, a fact you can bet the vet
eran Miller was well aware of.
The Beavers pressed the Cardinal
for the entire game, and by the
second half the fatigue was start
ing to show on the Stanford
guards.
"It was tough out there," Mont
gomery said. "The pressure was
key."
Todd Lichti, who shot 5-of-9 in
the first half, went l-for-9 in the
second, while Taylor missed his
only shot of the stanza.
"I was exhausted in the second
half," Lichti said, "There were a
couple of times when I probably
should have taken myself out, but
it was such a tight game and I
wanted to be in there."
Luckily for the Cardinal, the
press didn't take nearly as much
out of center Eric Reveno and for
ward Howard Wright. Nearly
every time Stanford needed a bas
ket in the second half, Wright and
Reveno responded.
Together the duo went 9-for-14
from the field and 2-for-2 from
the line to score 20 crucial second
half points. For the game, Wright
finished with a team leading 21
and Reveno had 15, including a
5-for-5 performance at the line.
Keefe added eight points in 17
minutes, and as a team the Car
dinal out-rebounded the Beavers
38-29.
In short, the Cardinal big men
were more than the smaller
Beavers could handle. "It was a
physical game," Wright said, "but
we like that. That's what we pride
ourselves on."
Another key to the Cardinal vic
tory was an 11-0 spurt that ended
the first half. With four minutes
to go in the half, Stanford was
down 30-23 and the OSU crowd
was on its feet. But helped by two
Knox turnovers and some lousy
