# Serving time for Operation Rescue incident
## Twin protesters find justification in jail 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
Freedom was cherished a little more than
usual this past weekend by juniors Janice and
Joyce Keen. They were just let out of jail.
The Keens finished serving a 48-hour jail
sentence on Thursday for participating in a
demonstration as members of Operation Res
cue, the national anti-abortion group.
The demonstration occurred Oct. 29, 1988
in front of Family Planning Alternatives, Inc.,
in Sunnyvale. Approximately 270 protesters
were arrested for trespassing. And the Keens,
the only Stanford undergraduates at the dem
onstration, were jailed for their participation
in the incident.
Due to a backlog in the court system, their
case for the October protest was heard last
Tuesday. They pleaded guilty to a mis
demeanor charge of trespassing, and since the
October protest they have been arrested three
other times for three other abortion protests.
According to the twins, "Going to jail is a
small price to pay in order to save the lives
of many babies who would be put to death
in the abortion clinics."

"A two-day sentence is nothing compared
to the death sentence those babies receive,"
Janice Keen said.
The Keens said they realize they probably
will be going to jail many more times in the
future because of their anti-abortion activities,
although they say they did find jail to be a
harrowing, yet humbling experience.
They first became involved with Operation
Rescue this fall when a mutual friend sug

gested they attend the group's meeting. "We
had to be dragged to the first meeting," said
Janice Keen, but added that from that point
on, they realized they would be dedicated to
a cause for which they already held the
tenants.
"I won't pay any fines because that money
supports the system that supports killing
babies," Janice Keen said of her reason to
plea bargain and not accept a $75 fine or go
on to trial. Protesters who have gone to trial
have faced up to $400 penalties and 90-day
jail-terms.
Janice Keen agreed, jail had been "One of
the best experiences of (their) lives. It made
us appreciate things so much more once we
got out, and really appreciate our freedom
now. I wanted to get back just to walk down
Campus Drive."
"I really feel blessed to have been able to
go," added Janice.
After their conviction, the Keens were taken
from the courthouse, strip-searched, deloused
and given prison uniforms. They said one of
the most memorable aspects of being in jail



Joyce and Janice Keen
was getting to know some of the
other inmates. "We laughed about
the circumstances that brought
us all together," Joyce Keen said.
"It's a good experience to un
derstand what jail is like, and I
almost think all Stanford students
should have to experience it,"
Joyce Keen said. "Now I live my
life more from day to day,"and
appreciate it, added Janice Keen.
"Time goes very slowly in jail."
The twins said thay have also
encountered police brutality as a
result of their last demonstration
in Fremont. They claim the
Fremont Police could not supply
enough handcuffs for the entire
group of protesters so they pro
ceeded to use plastic ties instead.
The ties cut off blood circula

tion to their hands, they said.
Janice Keen said she was lifted
up by her wrists until she had to
beg for the arresting officer to
take off the plastic ties.
Both the Keens said they were
content knowing that a protest
would save just one life. Joyce
Keen said she encountered a
woman who was going in for her
second abortion, but was blocked
due to the demonstration. That
woman later thanked the Keens
and Operation Rescue for prevent
ing her from undergoing a second
abortion.
Currently, there are 16 mem
bers of Operation Rescue who
have been jailed for two weeks.
Both twins agreed that Opera
tion Rescue and all the demon
strations have been time consum
ing for students. "But no one can
speak for those babies," said Joyce
Keen.
