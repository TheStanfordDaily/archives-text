CORVALLIS, Ore. — After watching his team
beat the Oregon State Beavers 60-58, the first thing
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery had to say was:
"This group has guts."
Any less gutty a group would have lost. But
yesterday, despite a full and vocal house in Gill
Coliseum, despite inconsistent officiating and despite
the fact that the team was playing its third road
game in six days, the Stanford players refused to
back down.
From the beginning, the Beavers, and particularly
their hot-shot guard Gary Payton, were out to in
timidate the Cardinal. A minute into the game
Stanford's Terry Taylor was called for reaching in
on the lightning-quick Payton.
Payton loves to talk, and sure enough, he im
mediatly began to taunt Taylor, and in doing so
angered Cardinal captain Eric Reveno. "Tell him to
shut up," Reveno yelled at the referee.
"Before the game, the referees always tell us to
keep our mouths shut," Reveno said, "And here it
was the first play of the game, and Payton's already
yelling his head off."
The tone was set, and neither team backed down.
The game became more and more heated, and
Payton continued to talk as he battled Taylor and
Todd Lichti on both ends of the court.
' He's a great player, I'll give him that," Taylor
said of Payton. "But I think he'd be better if he
didn't talk so much."
In the second half, the tension finally exploded.
Payton was called for reaching in on Taylor, but
then came back and forced Taylor to commit a
turnover. He then yelled something at Taylor that
Reveno clearly didn't want to hear.
"He just ticked me off," Reveno said, "I grabbed
his jersey and told him to shut up."
Payton turned around swinging and the benches
cleared. Everyone was yelling, but cooler heads came
to the resuce of both sides. Howard Wright grabbed
Reveno, and OSU's Eric Knox took hold of Payton,
who was still struggling to get at his much bigger
adversary. (Reveno is 6-foot-8 and 250 pounds,
Payton 6-2 and maybe 190.)
"I pushed Reveno away, but not for Reveno's
sake," Knox said, "It was for Gary's sake."
"I said to myself 'I have to get to Eric (Reveno)
before he gets to Gary, and Gary is broken in half,' "
Wright said.
