BERKELEY — For the third weekend in a row,
the Stanford baseball team lost two games of a
three-game weekend set, this time to conference
rival California.
Luckily it's a long season.

Cardinal loses two of three
to Golden Bears

Stanford won the opener Friday in hostile terri
tory 2-0, but dropped the remaining two games,
one at Sunken Diamond and one at Berkeley, 4-1
and 3-1. The Cardinal's record is now 9-10, 1-2 in
the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division. Cal
upped its record to 13-3, 2-1 in the Six-Pac.
Mike Mussina pitched an absolute gem on Friday
for the two-hit shutout win. He struck out a career
high 12 batters while walking only one in a full
nine innings of work. Mussina spotted his knuckle
curve well and his fastball could only be described
as explosive.
" Today the knuckle curve was dropping in there
where I wanted it. It was my best Pac-10 perform
ance by far," Mussina said.
Defensively, the game was also a gem for the
Cardinal. The Bears made their only threat of the
game in the seventh when Daryl Vice singled and
left fielder Mike Harrison hit it hard to the right
side of the infield. But Frank Carey dove to his
left, and flipped it to Troy Paulsen covering second
who fired tc first to complete the double play.
Cal's nex batter, Brad DeJardin, stung a long
fly to deep center field but Eric DeGraw, who had
come into the game defensively in the top of the
inning, made a diving catch to save an extra-base hit.
"(The defensive play in the seventh] got me over
the hump. I was getting tired," Mussina commented.
He went on to strike out three of the last six batters
in the game.

Offensively, Steve Solomon was the hero for the
Cardinal. He was 2-for-3 and hit a booming home
run over right-center field wall in the fifth for
the Cardinal's first run. Stanford added an insur
ance run in the eighth when Frank Carey walked
and scored on Brian Johnson's two-out single.
Sophomore Scott Weiss was the surprise starter
in Saturday's game when Stan Spencer was sidelined
with the flu. Weiss pitched brilliantly through the
first five innings of the game, not allowing a ball
out of the infield until Cal catcher Derek Stark hit
a fly ball to center fielder Solomon in the fifth with
one out.
In the sixth inning, however, Cal left fielder Kevin
Brown stung a long fly ball over Solomon's head
for a triple. After Brian Scott walked, Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess pulled Weiss in favor of Steve
Chitren.
But for the first time in a long time, Chitren
could not hold down the fort. He gave up a long
fly ball to Todd Mayo to score Brown, while Mike
Harrison's double scored Scott.
It would be all the offense Cal needed as the
Cardinal could only manage one run. It came in
the second inning when Johnson walked, reached
second on a wild pitch, went to third on a single
by Roger Burnett and scored on a fielder's choice.
Lack of big hits was also the story in Sunday's
game as Spencer pitched a fine game but was a
victim of no support.
Spencer had thrown innings of shutout ball
when, in the bottom of the eighth, Vice hit a line
drive off third baseman Tim Griffin's glove and
tried to stretch it to a double. Solomon's throw to
Frank Carey was right on the mark, but Vice ap
parently beat it by a hair.
"I'm in the worst position to judge [whether Vice
was safe]. There's not much you can do about it,"
Marquess said about the call.
"He was safe. It was a good call and it didn't
really affect me," Spencer said.


_ April Pearson — Daily
Second baseman Frank Carey contests a call. The punchless Cardinal fell under .500, losing twice
to California this weekend.
It affected the Bears, however,
as they rallied to score all three
of their runs with two out. Har-

After the game, Marquess said
he left Spencer in the game be
cause his pitch count was down,
and the sophomore had told him
he was not tired. "I don't really
think 1 tired out, and I kept all
of my pitches down low," Spencer
said.
