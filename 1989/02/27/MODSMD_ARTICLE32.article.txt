# Mussina hurls two-hitter, fans 12

### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
On most days, a top-notch
pitcher knows whether he's going
to be working with his best stufT.
Mike Mussina took the hill Fri
day against California thinking he
would have to fight his way
through the baJlgame.
"When I went out on the field,

I didn't think I had that good
stuff. Then I started controlling
my curve ball. The way it turned
out, it was probably the best game
I've pitched," Mussina said. "It's
my best outing in the Six-Pac by
far."
The Cardinal ace starter shut
out Cal on just two hits in Stan
ford's 2-0 win. He recorded a
career-high 12 strikeouts and

walked just one Bear batter. His
previous best effort was on Feb.
12, 1988, at Hawaii, when he also
pitched a two-hitter. Mussina's
win at Berkeley raised his record
to 2-2 and lowered his ERA to
2.65.
"You just try to loosen up in
the bullpen (before the game). I
couldn't reach that point where I
felt good," Mussina added. "Some
days you feel like you can throw
with your eyes closed and get it
over the plate. It wasn't that way
Friday."
But by the third inning, Cali
fornia knew the man known af
fectionately as "Moose" had
finally loosened up.
"After the first couple innings,
it felt like it's supposed to feel
when you're going to have one of
those days," Mussina said.
"I was able to throw the fastball
anywhere I wanted to in any sit
uation. My breaker was bending
over whenever I threw it. If I get
both pitches going together, it's
the best day I can ask for. That
doesn't happen very often," he
added.
Mussina used both fastball and
curve as his out pitches on a day
when either would have sawed off
any Six-Pac bat.
