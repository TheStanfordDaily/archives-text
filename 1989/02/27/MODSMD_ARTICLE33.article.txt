# Cal sneaks past swimmers while they take a breather

### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
In collegiate swimming, the entire
season is geared toward the Pacific 10
Conference Championships and NCAA
finals. The regular season dual meets are
considered to be preparation for the
championships.
The Stanford men's team may have
been concentrating just a little too much
on the fast-approaching conference finals
Saturday, however. Stanford, previously
undefeated in Pac-10 action, dropped its
final dual meet of the season to California
78-64 in the fog of Berkeley's Spieker
Aquatic Center. The loss brought the Car
dinal's overall dual meet record to 6-2
for the season.
"We overlooked the meet a little bit.
We were already looking forward to Pac
10's," co-captain Jay Mortenson said. "We
are better than them (Cal) but we just
swam flat."

Golden Bears 78, Cardinal 64

While Mortenson stated "we got out
scored in every swim," the entire picture
in Berkeley was definitely not glum.
Stanford's backstroking corps, espe
cially, once again showed that they will
be a key ingredient in the Cardinal's drive
for a fifth national crown.
Ix>d by freshman sensation Jeff Rouse,
Stanford swept both backstroke events.
In the 100-yard race Rouse was followed
by teammates Rick Gould and Mortenson,
while in the 200 backstroke Rouse and
Gould again took one-two and freshman
Andy Lloyd rounded out the top three.
Although the Bears shut Stanford out
in both of the distance freestyle winners'
circles, Ail-American Sean Killion took
the 500 free and Olympian Staffon

rersson won the 1650 event.
Cardinal Jason Plummer made his
NCAA cuts in the mile race while swim
ming to a second place finish. Defending
NCAA champion John Witchell was the
only Stanford freestyler to win a race,
taking his specialty, the 200 free. Junior
Lunn Lestina followed Witchell, and also
placed second in the 500 event.
The only other Cardinal victor was
Lloyd in the 400 individual medley, while
teammate Hank Wise placed third.
Sprinter Doug Lillydahl, however, did
place second in the 100 butterfly and
third in the 100 free.
"Basically they won all of the close
races and we weren't mentally prepared
for the meet," Matt Rodgers, a third place
finisher in the 100 breaststroke said.
According to Rodgers, the Cardinal's
lackluster performance was a result not
only of overlooking the meet, but also of
the team's resting process. The squad
has already started trimming its workout

yards and increasing practice speed to
prepare for the championship meets, but
is not yet to the point where the drop
has taken a large effect.
"We're right in the middle of tapering
and there is a time during resting when
you just don't swim fast," Rodgers said.
The loss, however, does not diminish
the Cardinal's confidence heading into
next week's conference finals.
Although the squad would have rather
ended the regular season with quicker
times and a victory over traditional rival
California, it still feels it has the talent,
momentum and times to take its eighth
consecutive Pac-10 title.
In fact, the squad dropped the same
season-concluding dual meet to the Bears
last season, bringing their overall record
to a mediocre 5-5, and swam away with
the title in Ix>ng Beach, Calif.
"We're really confident going into Pac
10's," Rodgers said. "After beating both
UCLA and USC we know we have a good

chance of doing well. Our dual meet
record is a lot better this year and it is
helping our confidence going into Pac
10's. We'll be really ready."
Neither docs the fact that the Cardinal
only has four swimmers qualified for na
tional finals faze the squad.
To compete at the NCAAs each swim
mer must post a time under a national
standard. And while the majority of com
petitors do not qualify until they are
rested and shaved, the nation's stronger
teams have traditionally qualified a num
ber of competitors during regular season
meets.
Although it does not give the swimmers
a different placing or treatment once they
reach Indianapolis, squads claim it gives
racers a psychological advantage.
"We're really looking forward to Pac
lO's," Mortenson said. "We're just going
to rest and shave and we'll do better in
a week and a half."
