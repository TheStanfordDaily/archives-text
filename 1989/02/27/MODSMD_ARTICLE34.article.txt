Ready the dustpans, pull out the
brooms — Stanford may well be sweep
ing. . '
Coming off a narrow win at California
that seemed halfhearted and unin
spired, the No. 4 Cardinal women's bas
ketball team felt it had something to
prove to itself. The result was a demoli
tion derby in Maples Pavilion where the
homestanding Stanford squad smashed
the third- and fourth-place teams in the
Pacific 10 Conference.

Cardinal 93, Beavers 56
Cardinal 107, Ducks 73

After besting Oregon State Friday
night 93-56 and Oregon on Saturday
107-73, the Cardinal boasts a spotless
14-0 Pac-10 record, 22-2 overall. The
pair of victories also extended the team's
school-record win streak to 16, shatter
ing last year's record-setting series of
14.
Moreover, the weekend's results
moved the Cardinal to within one game
of clinching a share of its first confer
ence title ever, and two wins from out
right possession. With a mere four
games remaining on its schedule, Stan
ford has a great chance to sweep the
league should it maintain the high level
of play exhibited against the Oregon
schools.
The juggernaut started rolling at the
tipoff Friday night. Forward Katy
Steding grabbed center Jill Yanke's tip,
and 20 seconds later sunk a 3-pointer

to get the Cardinal going.
From the early seconds, the game
went entirely in Stanford's direction.
The Cardinal notched 13 points in five
minutes, and Oregon State was unable
to score a single point until high-scorer
Yasmin Gray (who tallied 13 for the
game) sunk the front end of a one-and
one.
At the half, the scoreboard read Stan
ford 54, Oregon State 20. The game
never got much closer.
"I thought we played a really strong
first half," Stanford Coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "We came out with a lot
of enthusiasm, a lot of intensity, and
established the way we were going to
play.
"It was nice in that individuals didn't
stand out as much as our team looked
good. Everyone played really, really well.
I like it."
One individual, however, commanded
most of the audience's attention. Earn
ing her I,oooth point and 500 th assist
at Stanford before leaving the game
with 10 minutes left in the second half,
guard Jennifer Azzi played a spectacular
game.
Her most important contributions,
however, came on defense. Assigned to
guard All-Pac-10 guard Chelle Flamoe,
who topped the league's scoring chart
for much of last season, Azzi completely
neutralized Flamoe's threat, holding her
to a paltry nine points.
The Beaver senior seemed so afraid
of Azzi that she consistently drove in
side, preferring to match-up with taller
players like Yanke, Steding and Trisha
Stevens than face the smaller but feis
tier Azzi.
"I don't think she likes someone to

be very physical with her," Azzi ex
plained. "A lot of times coming off of
screens, she would run into me and it
would be like, 'Oh no, here she (Azzi)
is again.'
"I think it was a personal goal before
the game to hold her as much as I could,
and she seemed to have a little less
confidence down here than she did up
there."
Another standout performance came
from guard Martha Richards, whom
VanDerveer substituted in at both small
forward and shooting guard. Recording
11 points in 20 minutes of play, she
formed a deadly tandem with Azzi and
a more-than-apt replacement upon Az
zi's exodus.
"I felt more like I was in the flow of
the game," Richards said. "I think I felt
a little more confident because I've
played well in practice, and what you
do in practice carries over into games."
Apparently the team has been prac
ticing blow-outs, because that's exactly
what it exacted from Oregon the fol
lowing evening. Fueled by another
patented Azzi performance — 20 points
and eight assists to add to her 12 points
and eight assists the night before —
and post persistence by centers Jill
Yanke and Julie Zeilstra, Stanford broke
the century mark for the third time
this season.
Yanke, in particular, was the key for
the Cardinal. Matched up with the tal
lest player in the Pac-10, 6-foot-7
Stefanie Kasperski, Stanford's 6-5
starter had a sizeable challenge. Her
response was her best all-around outing
of the season: 16 points, five rebounds,
