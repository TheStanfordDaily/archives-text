CERRITOS, Calif. - The more
things change, the more they stay
the same.
With a new coach, a new class
of freshmen and at a new pool,
the Cardinal women's swim team
did exactly the same thing it did
last year — win the Pacific 10
Conference Swimming Champion
ships going away.

Women's Swimming
Cardinal Ist in Pac-10s

The Cardinal scored 1633
points (team totals'do not include
yesterday's platform diving) in
the three-day meet, placing the
team well ahead of second-place
California, which scored 1237.5.
UCLA finished third with 1002
points, USC finished fourth at
977.5, Arizona State was fifth at
874 and Arizona was sixth with
820. Washington (320.5), Oregon
State (279.5) and Washington
State (253) rounded out the field.
"The meet was a much tougher
meet for our team than I thought

it would be," Stanford Coach
Richard Quick said. "In general,
I'm pleased to be Pac-10 champs.
I think we're in a good position
for NCAAs; to do a good job
there."
Stanford qualified three more
swimmers for the NCAA meet
over the weekend, bringing the
team total to 18. Senior Dana An
derson and freshman Julie Martin
qualified in the 500-yard freestyle
Thursday and freshman Jamie
Rugless qualified in the 100 but
terfly Friday.
Only 17 swimmers are allowed
to go to the NCAA meet, and with
two more opportunities to qualify
coming up this weekend, Quick
will have to leave at least one
qualifier behind.
"I was real pleased with Jamie
Rugless, Dana Anderson and Julie
Martin," Quick said. "We had a
lot of (season) best times in this
meet for people who were going
for best times."
"I think we have a wonderful
conference and it was a great
meet," California Coach Karen
Moe Thornton said. "It's always
tough to come in here and swim
tired, like Stanford did. I thought
they handled it pretty well. ... I

think Stanford and Florida will
be challenging for the (NCAA)
title."
Stanford's top performer was
sophomore Michelle 'Griglione,
who despite not shaving or resting
for the meet tied with Golden Bear
sophomore Sarah Anderson for
high point honors. Both won three
events to earn their team 90
points. Griglione won the 200 in
dividual medley Thursday, the
400 IM Friday and the 200 but
terfly Saturday.
Although she came up a bit
slower than her season bests in
both the 400 IM and the 200 but
terfly, Griglione isn't worried.
"The way I feel is the way I
swim," she said. "After all these
years ... I'm not going to worry
about anything. I just know that
I've been working out harder than
I ever have; my practice times are
better than they ever have been.
I'm just going to go and see what
happens (at NCAAs)."
Junior Jill Johnson placed third
among individual point-scorers
after placing third in the 200 IM
Thursday, taking fifth in the 100
breaststroke Friday and winning
