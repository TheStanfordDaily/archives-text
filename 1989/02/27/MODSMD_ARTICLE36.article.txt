# Men's netters lose twice at National Indoors
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
If there's anything to be learned
from this weekend's National In
door Team Championships, it's
that the national rankings for
men's tennis are meant to predict
who will be No. 1 at the end of
the season, rather than simply say
which team is No. 1 as of this
week.
Either that, or those voting in
the poll are completely clueless.
How else to explain the fact that
every single seeded team at the
tournament, held in Louisville,
lost at least once during the week
end — with some, such as second
ranked Stanford, going down to
defeat twice?

Bulldogs 5, Cardinal 1

Stanford's performance was
typical of the play of the nation's
top teams. UCLA, undefeated and
ranked No. 1 for the first month
of the season, fell in the semi
finals to UC-Irvine, who had sent
fourth-seeded USC packing a
round earlier.
No. 3 Georgia, the tourney's
second seed, dropped a 5-4 deci
sion to California in the quarter
finals in a match that came down
to a third-set tiebreaker in the
No. 1 doubles match.
The tournament was eventually
won by the unseeded Golden
Bears, who took out Texas (No. 7
seed), Georgia (No. 2), Kentucky
(No. 6) and Irvine (No. 5) to cap
ture the title. Does this make the
Bears the top team in the coun
try?
As of yesterday, yes — but, as
noted before, the Intercollegiate
Tennis Coaches Association
rankings are slightly different
from the Associated Press "No.
1-team-of-the-week" men's bas
ketball poll. In other words, don't
look to see California make a vault
to the No. 1 spot.
As far as Stanford is concerned,
however, the two losses, which
bring the team's record to 3-2 on
the year, aren't any great cause
for alarm. Losing to a top-10 team
(which happens to be playing at
home) and then falling to the
country's third-ranked team cer
tainly is no reason to celebrate,
but it still does not exactly con
stitute a wasted weekend.
