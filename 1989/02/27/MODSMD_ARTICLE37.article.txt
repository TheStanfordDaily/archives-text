# Spikers have no problem handling Aggies in Davis
## 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
A shorthanded Cardinal vol
leyball squad stormed into
Aggie country on Friday night
to do battle with the UC-Davis
spikers. Although Stanford
starters Scott Fortune, Dan
Hanan, Craig Forsyth, Parker
Blackman and Duncan Black
man did not make the trip, Car
dinal Coach Fred Sturm
thought that the Aggies would
put up a tough fight.

And, though the match was
tight at the outset, Stanford's
talent-laden troops eventually
pulled away with a 15-7, 15-5,
15-7 victory.
Stanford coach Fred Sturm
started Doug Walquist, Scott
Pedersen, John Alstrom, Ryan
Moos, senior Dave Johnson and
setter Ryan O'Hara in the non
league game.
O'Hara, making his second
start of the season, commented
on the development of the
match. "We could tell at the
beginning that they were going
to be tough to beat. In game
one, they started out playing
right with us. All of us thought

that the match would be very
close. But then we got warmed
up; we consistently sided out."
Many of the six starters had
not had the opportunity to see
much action prior to Friday
night's match, and, as a result,
they may have been a little un
polished at the outset. How
ever, once the team did "warm
up," things really began to
click.
O'Hara selflessly dished out
credit to his teammates. "I
thought (Ryan) Moos played
really well," O'Hara said.
"That's two straight good
matches for him; he played
solidly against San Diego State
as well. And Pedersen was
really tough in the middle. I
feel like we all played a very
good game."
Apparently, coach Fred
Sturm seemed to agree with
O'Hara, because the normally
stoic Sturm appeared to be ex
ceptionally pleased with his
team's showing.
Said O'Hara: "That's one of
the first times this season, I
think, that Coach really felt
that we played a complete
match. Usually, he congrat
ulates us and then makes sug
gestions as to how we could
have improved our play.
Tonight, he just smiled and
said 'Good job, guys.' "
