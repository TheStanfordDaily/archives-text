# Women defeat Sun Devils and Wildcats in Arizona
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
It was a pretty big weekend:
the first major road trip of the
year, the opener of the conference
schedule and two meetings with
top-20 teams.
It was the kind of weekend that
maybe, just maybe, would cause
a team to lose a little of its edge
and maybe even a meet.
Not the Stanford women's ten
nis team, however.
The Cardinal (8-0, 2-0 in Pacific
10 Conference play) recorded its
sixth shutout of the season in top
ping No. 7 Arizona State Friday

Women's Tennis
Cardinal 9, Sun Devils 0
Cardinal 7, Wildcats 2

and came back to best No. 17
Arizona State, 7-2, Saturday.
Against the Sun Devils, Stan
ford came out strong and didn't
let up. Led by Ail-American Tami
Whitlinger, who scored a 6-0, 6-2
win over Krista Amend, the Car
dinal swept all six singles matches
to render the doubles moot as'they
had done in all previous meets
this year.
The Cardinal showed strength

from top to bottom in the lineup.
At No. 2, Sandra Birch showed
her All-America form in toppling
Kristi Jonkosky 6-1, 6-2. Follow
ing her, Lisa Green dropped a set
to Barb Thompson before closing
out a 6-1, 2-6, 6-3 victory.
Freshman sensation Debbie
Graham knocked off Jennifer
Rojohn 6-1, 7-6 at No. 4. Teri
Whitlinger nearly shut out Paola
Conte 6-1, 6-0. Finally, at No. 6
Kylie Johnson soundly drubbed
Karen Bergan 6-1, 6-2.
Even though the doubles didn't
matter, the Cardinal swept all
three. The Whitlinger twins beat

Rojohn-Bergan 6-1, 6-2. Partners
Birch and Graham scored a 6-4,
6-1 win over Amend-Jonkosky.
Captain Cindy Buchsbaum joined
Lisa Green at No. 3 where they
beat Thompson and Luann Lim
chock 6-4, 6-1.
Saturday's match with the
lower-ranked Wildcats provided
much of the same. Tami Whit
linger beat Betsy Somerville 6-0,
6-1. Birch blew by Banni Redhair
6-1, 6-1. Danielle Scott scored a
surprising upset over Lisa Green
6-2, 2-6, 6-4 at No. 3
Graham had little trouble with
Danielle Klurman, winning 6-4,

6-1. Teri Whitlingher handily
defeated Harriet Knols 6-1, 6-2.
Buchsbaum, in the lineup for
Johnson, fell to Nancy Breen 6-3,
1-6, 6-4.
Again, Stanford swept the dou
bles in the already-decided match.
Teri and Tami Whitlinger scored
a convincing 6-2, 6-0 win over
Somerville-Redhair.
Birch and Graham were sharp
in besting Knols-Scott 6-2, 6-1.
At No. 3, Eleni Rossides saw her
first action in a while, teaming
with Green. However, the duo lost
a difficult three-setter to
Klurman-Breen 4-6, 6-3, 7-5.
