# Gymnasts trounce No. 11 Wolverines
## 
### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
In what is often considered an
individual sport, the Stanford
men's gymnasts worked together
last night and put together one
of the nation's top scores of the
season.
The host Cardinal scored 279.95
points to insure themselves a
place among the NCAA top live
when this week's collegiate gym
nasties rankings are released. The
Stanford total included career
personal bests by three individ
uals in the all-around competi
tion.
The Cardinal left No. 11 Mich
igan (which scored 266.95) in the
dust on their way to what Stan
ford junior Charles Loop believes
is the highest team score yet
achieved in the country this
season. Loop said he has not
heard of any better scores but will
have to wait until the next NCAA
standings come off the press to
verify this.
Stanford defeated Michigan,
California, and San Jose State at
San Jose State on Friday night
with a 277.30 total. This week
end's wins put the Cardinal record

Three gymnasts had
career-best totals.

at 10-2 and provide momentum
for two meets this week versus
perennial powerhouse UCLA,
which it faces Wednesday at
Berkeley and Friday night at
Maples Pavilion.
Tim Ryan continued his stellar
freshman campaign by scoring
56.95 points to win the meet's
individual all-around title by more
than half a point over runner-up
Conrad Voorsanger. Ryan's total,
like those of Loop (55.45) and
sophomore Tim Wang (54.55), was
a career best.
The improvement of Loop and
Wang has been especially marked
lately, and has been indicative of
the team's rise towards its poten
tial.
"Even though 1 had some
misses on a few events, I was still
able to get a a high all-around
score," Wang said. "I think all of
us can score 56 if we hit our
routines. We're getting there;
we're becoming very consistent."
Often the Cardinal gymnasts

were more than consistent. Loop's
total included a 9.7 on the high
bar and a 9.65 on the floor, both
personal bests. Ryan turned in
the meet's high score with a 9.75
on the high bar.
As a team, Stanford's combina
tion of flair and consistency was
most obvious on the floor exercise
where the team's low score was
9.25 despite a number of dazzling
and precarious acrobatic moves.
Card notes
Stanford's recent success has come
despite the absence of co-captain
Adam Forman who may be ready to
return to competition by Wednesday.
With the addition of Forman, the Car
dinal's depth will be especially im
pressive.
Senior Scott Schaffer tied with
Ryan for the meet's parallel bar title,
but distinguished himself most
notably on the still rings. Schaffer
missed his complicated release move
on this event when his hand slipped
from one of the rings, leaving him
hanging from one arm. After the
meet, Schaffer modestly admitted that
it was not the force of his motion
that led to his fall. Rather, the veteran
of three NCAA Championships wore
the entirely wrong type of handgrips
