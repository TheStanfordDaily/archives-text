carrying the momentum from
each event," senior co-captain
Sheri Evenson said.
After struggling to "stick"
their routines on the balance
beam all season, the team took
the first three places on this
event.
Finishing first on the balance
beam, junior co-captain Dina
Amoroso scored a season best
with 9.6 points. Senior Laurence
George placed second and Even
son third.
Coach Homer Sardina could
not have been more correct
when he said, "I can't say
enough about Dina Amoroso."
Amoroso, who had been unable
to compete all-around for over
a month because of an injury,
was still injured during this
weekend's meet.
Nevertheless, she not only

scored a season best on balance
beam, but also on the uneven
bars, the floor exercise, and the
all-around with 38.2 points, for
which she placed fourth in the
meet.
Sardina was impressed by the
team's "outstanding job" con
sidering four team members
were unable to perform because
of various injuries.
"When you can consider who
is not competing and what we're
doing, we're a pretty tough
team," Sardina said.
Sardina hopes the team will
prove their strength once again
during tonight's competition at
Utah, whose team is ranked
first in the nation. The Cardinal
will also be competing with
Oklahoma, the nation's fifth
ranked team, and New Mexico.
