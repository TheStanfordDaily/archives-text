Speaking from the "hallowed
Stanford Law School, where
the plot to defeat me was
born," former Republican Con
gressman Ernie Konnyu
shared insights from his six
year stint in the California
state legislature and two-year
term in the House of Repre
sentatives.
Last Thursday was Konnyu's
second Stanford speaking ap
pearance since losing his Con
gressional seat to fellow Repub
lican Tom Campbell, a Stan
ford law professor. Last June,
Campbell defeated then
incumbent Konnyu by a sub
stantial margin. Konnyu was
the only incumbent House
member seeking re-election to
lose in the June 7 primary.
Speaking to about 20 mem
bers of the Stanford College
Republicans, Konnyu
reminisced about his years in
Congress.
"It's amazing how much
more 'play it safe' goes on in
Congress ... if your first-time

date has bad breath, you don't
discuss it. In Congress, there
are things you discuss and
things you don't."
While he does not see himself
winning another Congressional
seat, Konnyu had positive
words about the Washington,
D.C. scene.
"1 was pleasantly surprised
by the quality of the people
and staff in Congress. Most
people in college are very ca
pable, and they (Congressmen)
may match a set of Stanford
professors in brains — most of
the time," he said.
According to Konnyu, the
United States is going through
a pragmatic phase and Ameri
cans are evaluating what direc
tion they should go towards.
Voters, for instance, are no
longer following a strict party
line and base their decision on
qualifications, he said.
At present, Konnyu said he
is content to do "something
positive," and saw his Stanford
visit as an opportunity for Uni
versity students to "to talk to
someone in politics."
