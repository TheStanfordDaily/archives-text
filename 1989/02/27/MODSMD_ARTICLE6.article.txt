# HP to fund joint research center
##

An unprecedented program
sponsored by the Hewlett-
Packard Company will give
Stanford Computer Science a wel
comed boost in resources and will
tighten the bond between the cor
poration and the University.
With a bill of $2.4 million footed
by HP, a new science center sup
porting joint projects between
Stanford and HP researchers will
begin operation at Stanford in
March, according to a formal an
nouncement released Thursday.
HP launched the center at Stan
ford this year for an initial three
year term, sending their own
scientists onto campus to work
with Stanford scientists to add up
a sum greater than its parts.
By March 1, HP scientists will
begin to work on campus with
Stanford researchers, collaborat
ing on problems of common sci
entific interest. HP will provide
funds and equipment to support
the projects as the company's re
searchers work in the labs of fac
ulty members investigating these
research areas.
The center will initially focus

on applications involving artificial
intelligence, database technology
and neural networks, according
to Steven Rosenberg, HP manager
of the Stanford Science Center.

Stanford was chosen because of
its highly-esteemed computer sci
ence program and its close asso
ciation with HP labs in the past,
said Associate Director of HP labs
Lawrence Rogers, head of the sci
ence center program. The foun
ders of HP, William Hewlett and
David Packard, graduated from
Stanford in 1934. Since its found
ing, the company has generously
donated to the University.
The Stanford center is the first
of three new science centers HP
will build to expand its research
capabilities. "By establishing sci
ence centers, HP can respond
faster to the technological needs
of its U.S. and international cus
tomers. In addition, good research
is going on in universities all over
