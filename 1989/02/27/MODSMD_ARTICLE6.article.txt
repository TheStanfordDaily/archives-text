# HP to fund joint research center
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
An unprecedented program
sponsored by the Hewlett-
Packard Company will give
Stanford Computer Science a wel
comed boost in resources and will
tighten the bond between the cor
poration and the University.
With a bill of $2.4 million footed
by HP, a new science center sup
porting joint projects between
Stanford and HP researchers will
begin operation at Stanford in
March, according to a formal an
nouncement released Thursday.
HP launched the center at Stan
ford this year for an initial three
year term, sending their own
scientists onto campus to work
with Stanford scientists to add up
a sum greater than its parts.
By March 1, HP scientists will
begin to work on campus with
Stanford researchers, collaborat
ing on problems of common sci
entific interest. HP will provide
funds and equipment to support
the projects as the company's re
searchers work in the labs of fac
ulty members investigating these
research areas.
The center will initially focus

on applications involving artificial
intelligence, database technology
and neural networks, according
to Steven Rosenberg, HP manager
of the Stanford Science Center.

Stanford was chosen because of
its highly-esteemed computer sci
ence program and its close asso
ciation with HP labs in the past,
said Associate Director of HP labs
Lawrence Rogers, head of the sci
ence center program. The foun
ders of HP, William Hewlett and
David Packard, graduated from
Stanford in 1934. Since its found
ing, the company has generously
donated to the University.
The Stanford center is the first
of three new science centers HP
will build to expand its research
capabilities. "By establishing sci
ence centers, HP can respond
faster to the technological needs
of its U.S. and international cus
tomers. In addition, good research
is going on in universities all over
the world and HP wants to stay
close to it," said Frank Carruba,
director of HP labs.
The location of the other two
centers have not been determined
yet, but HP plans to place them
in the Pacific Rim region and in
Europe.
The center is beneficial to Stan
ford for a number of reasons, said
Computer Science Chair Nils
Nilsson, Stanford director of the
center.
He said the HP program was a
new way for the University to
interact with industry. Nilsson
said the new relationship will
work to solve long-term basic re
search problems that concern
both academic and commercial in
terest.
Elliot Levinthal, associate dean
for research in the School of En
gineering, said the center is "not
here as an HP research lab" but
is an attempt to work on problems
of "overlapping interests."
"We've had research grants and
contributions from companies
before," he said. The center is
unique in its tight interaction be
tween the company and the Uni
versity on projects that both
would usually study independent
ly, Levinthal said.
"The HP people are themselves

very bright researchers. We would
have to hire research associates
if HP didn't provide their very
best people," Nilsson said.
He added that the funds and
the equipment donated are signif
icant contributions to research.
Nilsson said the center will pro
vide funds for graduate students
and Ph. D. dissertations.
One of the planned projects will
aim to develop a computer svstem
created to optimize assembly line
design, Rosenberg said. The re
searchers hope to create a com
puter system that will process the
relevant information necessary
for designing an assembly line far
more efficiently.
Another project will develop a
database system that will adapt
to changing information from a
variety of sources.
Rosenberg said, "Let's say you
have a system that will determine
a class schedule, placing classes
in certain rooms. Now let's say
things change and a classroom is
flooded, or there are too many
students for a room. This system
will change the task of assigning
a schedule if you can't just assign
things and say it's fixed, if you
know the information is
changed."
The third project the center will
focus on involves applying neural
networking technology to chemi
cal analysis.

here as an HP research lab" but
is an attempt to work on problems
of "overlapping interests."
"We've had research grants and
contributions from companies
before," he said. The center is
unique in its tight interaction be
tween the company and the Uni
versity on projects that both
would usually study independent
ly, Levinthal said.
"The HP people are themselves

very bright researchers. We would
have to hire research associates
if HP didn't provide their very
best people," Nilsson said.
He added that the funds and
the equipment donated are signif
icant contributions to research.
Nilsson said the center will pro
vide funds for graduate students
and Ph. D. dissertations.
One of the planned projects will
aim to develop a computer svstem
created to optimize assembly line
design, Rosenberg said. The re
searchers hope to create a com
puter system that will process the
relevant information necessary
for designing an assembly line far
more efficiently.
Another project will develop a
database system that will adapt
to changing information from a
variety of sources.
Rosenberg said, "Let's say you
have a system that will determine
a class schedule, placing classes
in certain rooms. Now let's say
things change and a classroom is
flooded, or there are too many
students for a room. This system
will change the task of assigning
a schedule if you can't just assign
things and say it's fixed, if you
know the information is
changed."
The third project the center will
focus on involves applying neural
networking technology to chemi
cal analysis.
