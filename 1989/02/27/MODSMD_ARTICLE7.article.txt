# AASA still pushing for professorship
## 
### Janine De Fao Staff writer 
Seeking to create a tenure-track
spot in Asian-American studies,
representatives from the Asian-
American Students Association
claim the University is hedging
to commit and secure such a po
sition.
At a Friday meeting with Uni
versity Provost James Rosse,
AASA members and students
from other minority groups tried
to push through their tenure
track proposal. At the meeting,
they submitted a letter that had
the support of 13 Asian-American
campus groups as well as a peti
tion signed by 1,000 community
members.
Saying that such a decision
should not ride solely on his
shoulders, Rosse said he preferred
to consult with Thomas Wasow,
dean of Undergraduate Studies;
James Sheehan, chair of the His
tory Department; and Ewart
Thomas, dean of Humanities and
Sciences before drawing a conclu
sion.
"I feel that this is a priority,"
Rosse said in reference to the post,
adding that he must first meet
with Wasow, Sheehan and
Thomas "to explore and confirm
this priority in relationship to
other priorities that the Univer
sity has."
However, AASA members said
Rosse's Friday response frus
trated them because they had al
ready consulted these faculty
members.
"We were frustrated because we
had already talked to those people
and they said they couldn't do
anything without Rosse because
he would have to grant the fund
ing [for the position]," said soph
omore Michelle Yee, a member of
AASA.
AASA's request comes on the

heels of the recent resignation of
Gordon Chang, the only person
currently teaching a course in the
area of Asian-American studies.
Chang will leave Stanford at the
end of the academic year for a
tenure-track position with UC-
Irvine's History Department. As
it now stands, there is no faculty
member to replace Chang.
While acknowledging that
Rosse generally agreed with the
AASA proposal, junior Richard
Suh told The Daily yesterday that
Rosse "started hedging and
hawing when it came to making
a commitment."

'We've been waiting
for this position for 18
years.'

Suh, who is issues committee
chair for AASA, said Rosse agreed
to set up a meeting with the other
faculty members. "This way they
can't pass the buck. They'll all be
in one room," Suh said. As of
yesterday, a specific date had not
been set.
According to AASA members,
Rosse also agreed to issue a public
statement supporting the idea of
a tenure-track position.
While Rosse predicted that an
Asian-American studies tenure
post will be created within the
next year-and-a-half, Suh stressed
the urgency of the post.
"We've been waiting for this po
sition for 18 years. It should be
created now," Suh said.
"The bottom line is if [the Uni
versity] really were committed to
ethnic studies in general, they
would put their money where
their mouth is and create this
tenure-track position. They have
the resources," Suh said.
