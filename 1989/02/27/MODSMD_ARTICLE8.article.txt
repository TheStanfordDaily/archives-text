# Cat network prepares for many-whiskered sweep
## 
### Kaye Loethes 
In order to control Stanford's increasing
population of wild cats, the University will
begin trapping campus cats today. Animals
that are not tagged and registered will be
taken to the Palo Alto Humane Center;
those with proper registration will be set
free.
To prepare for this sweep of feral felines,
the Cat Network, a group of animal lovers
from the Stanford area, spent this weekend
notifying residents on the edges of campus
about the trapping campaign.
Stanford's new trapping policy has given
rise to controversy between the network
and the University because the network
does not feel the locaJ non-University com
munity has been thoroughly informed
about the cat-control measures.
Carole Miller, a member of the network,
said she felt "The community is not suf
ficiently aware" of the University's pro
gram. Despite media coverage by both local
newspapers and television stations, Miller,
an accounting manager in the Electrical
Engineering Department, said she feels

Stanford could do more to inform the com
munity about the procedure.
Despite her argument that "Notifying
the public is beyond the scope of the Cat
Network," Miller said she believes that res
idents who live near the Stanford Medical
Center, where the first traps will be set,
should be aware their animals might be
removed during the sweep.
"Someone has to take responsibility to
make sure those who live on the borders
of campus know what is going on," Miller
commented. To accomplish this, members
of the network distributed notices and
posted fliers this weekend in the area of
College Terrace, Willow Road and Sand
Hill Road, near the Medical Center.
The network is not entirely against
removal of the animals, Miller said, adding
that many of the wild cats were once do
mestic and "were not intended to fend for
themselves."
These cats "are not doing well and are
suffering from starvation and disease," she
said.
However, Miller said she feels that

animals being regularly fed and cared for
by students and faculty around campus
should not be trapped by the University.
In order to prevent this from happening,
students need to register the animals, she
said.
Miller said she believes many students
on campus are not aware of the respon
sibilites of caring for a pet, and speculated
that most of the cats on campus were once
pets of irresponsible students.

Many students release their pet cats at
the end of the year without ever having
them spayed or neutered, she said. For
this reason, Miller said she wants to in
stigate a Humane Education program in
residences.
"Students need to know about the prob
lems with overpopulation," Miller said,
comparing the responsibilities of pet owner
ship to those associated with having
children.
Proper care of a pet can be "a 20-year
commitment," she said.
Although the residence program is still
in the initial stages, Miller hopes that even
tually residences will each adopt a pet for
residents to care for year afler year.
The Cat Network is receiving aid from
members of the Stanford community who
are making donations to a fund called "Save
The Cats at Stanford." The money is col
lected in an account at the Stanford Federal
Credit Union.
The group is also receiving aid from other
animal activist groups such as Paws and
In Defense Of Animals, as well as the Palo
Alto Humane Society.
