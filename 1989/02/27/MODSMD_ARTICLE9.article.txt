# Dividing over unification in '92
## Panelists discuss implications of a united European economy 
### Mike Habata 
Officials from both sides of
the Atlantic found it hard to
agree on the economic effects
the Single European Act of 1992
might have on the United
States.
The Single European Act of
1992, known simply as "1992,"
promises to complete the proc
ess of European economic uni
fication begun in 1951 with the
creation of the European Eco
nomic Community, now com
posed of 12 nations.
In a panel discussion last
week in Kresge Auditorium
sponsored by the student group
Club Europe, six speakers —
including attaches from Italy,
France and Germany, a Euro
pean Community group repre
sentative, a visiting history pro
fessor and an official of an in
ternational consulting company
— presented their differing

views on the unification act to
an audience of about 175.
Keynote speaker Barbara
Jacob, representative of the Eu
ropean Community, said the
1992 act aims to "create a single
market" in the European com
munity and give new momen
tum for unification.
John Henry, senior vice pres
ident of Menlo Park's SRI In
ternational, said the "driving
force of 1992 is industrial power
politics, not political power
politics." He added that Amer
ican companies and the general
public are not "taking the issue
as seriously as they should."
The three European represen
tatives argued that the 1992
plan would benifit the United
States.
Johannes Peisinger, deputy
consulate general of Germany
in San Francisco, stated that in
the past the "founding and en
largement of the European com

munity . . . has not led to pro
tectionism ... but to an elimi
nation of trade barriers,"
promising that the economic
community will honor its free
trade agreements.
The task of disputing the as
sertions of the other speakers
praising the 1992 act fell to
Robert Kleiman, visiting history
professor and New York Times
correspondant. Kleiman cited
"nationalistic and protectionis
tic pressures [which] remain
strong in some [European!
countries."
According to Kleiman, Euro
pean nations claim that the
1992 program is directed
against Japanese protectionism,
but he stated that since this
bias cannot be written into the
new regulations, a general pro
tectionism would become insti
tutionalized to the detriment of
American interests.
