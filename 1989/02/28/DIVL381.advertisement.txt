Theme Associate Positions for
Theme Houses for 1989-90
— —
Students who are interested in applying for TA positions in the American Studies House,
EAST House, La Maison Francaise, La Casa Italiana, Haus Mitteleuropa, Slavianskii Dom
and the American Indian Theme House can pick up information and applications from the
Resident Fellows at the houses* or from the Row Office (Governor's Corner Office for
EAST House) starting Tuesday, February 21. Complete applications should be turned in
to the RF's Friday, March 3.
Theme Associates in Academic Theme Houses are selected by and supervised by the
Resident Fellow(s). While the role of Theme Associate reflects the theme and operation of
the particular house, all TA's have four basic job responsibilities (with some variation):
1) To help residents develop and present theme-related programs and projects.
2) To develop at least one theme-related program per quarter (not true for all houses).
3) To foster the involvement of faculty members from fields related to the theme in the
house as regular meal guests, program presenters, faculty associates and in other
ways.
4) To meet regularly with the RF(s) and RA as part of the residence staff and to share
responsibility for making the house a well-functioning, active house community.
TA applicants are expected to have a strong background in the topic area of the theme
(not true for all houses) and developed skills at organizing activities and motivating
participation. Students are strongly encouraged to speak with the RFs and RAs of
individual houses for information about distinct TA duties and the selection process.
Theme Associates will attend a training program in the fall. Call 723-0778 with
questions.
*Students interested in the American Indian House can pick up materials from
RF Jim Larimore in the DOS A office at 323 Old Union.
