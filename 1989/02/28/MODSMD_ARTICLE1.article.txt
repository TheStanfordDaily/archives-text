# Weekend fire guts home of Webb Ranch director
## Cause of blaze unknown, USW negotiations begin today 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
Destroying the home of Webb
Ranch's director early Sunday
morning, a fire of unknown origin
caused damages estimated at
$110,000, a fire captain confirmed
yesterday.
The blaze comes at a critical
time for Webb Ranch manage
ment. Negotiation sessions be
tween the United Stanford
Workers and Webb Ranch begin
today.
The source of the fire is still
under investigation, according to
Kirk Mathew, fire captain of the
California Department of Forestry
and Fire Protection.
"The cause of the fire is offi
cially under investigation, and it
is premature to release coryec
tures when we have no good, hard
evidence," said Mathew. Arson
has not been ruled out, he said.

At 1:35 a.m. Sunday, the de
partment received a 911 call in
forming them of a fire at the home
of Gary Webb, director of the
ranch and son of retired owner
Stanley Webb. Firefighters were
dispatched to the scene and Palo
Alto and Menlo Park fire depart
ments soon joined them there,
Mathew said.
No one was injured, and the
fire was declared "contained" by
2:09 a.m., said Mathew. Webb and
his family were away at a wedding
in Redwood City at the time.
Both the owner and manager
of Webb Ranch were unavailable
for comment yesterday.
USW field representative Mike
Tatham stressed that Sunday's
incident should not affect negoti
ations between Webb Ranch and
the union.
Ranch workers, through the
USW, have sued Webb Ranch and
obtained a temporary restraining

order, charging that workers have
been harassed and threatened
with loss of their homes. The law
suit includes the University,
which owns the ranch located be
tween Interstate 280 and Alpine
Road.
With Webb workers now in the
process of joining the union, the
USW will represent the Webb
Ranch laborers during the negota
tions. The University has declined
to take part in the negotiations.
In a letter delivered to USW
President Alan Wagner last
Thursday, University attorney
Michael Vartain said "Stanford
must necessarily reject [the
USW's] request" to have the Uni
versity at the bargaining table.
Vartain explained that Stanford
is not an "employer of any agricul
tural employees at Webb Ranch,"
and therefore has no "authority
over Webb Ranch's agricultural
enterprises.
