## Boeing advises 747 inspections 
### 
HONOLULU (AP) — Airlines
worldwide were advised to check
the cargo doors of their Boeing
747s as federal investigators fo
cused yesterday on the cargo door
latch system of a United Airlines
jumbo jet that ripped open at
22,000 feet.
U.S. Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner said he thinks
"It's very important that we not
jump to conclusions until that
report (on the investigation) is
done."
"The preliminary indications,
of course, are that the (cargo) door
opened or at least the skin peeled
around the door. But let's wait
until the board reports, then we'll
know finally what went on," Skin
ner said in an interview yesterday
with ABC's "Good Morning
America."
United announced that it con
ducted detailed examinations of
all cargo doors in every plane in
its fleet. Seven doors required re
pairs, the airline said, but press
representative Rob Doughty said
none of the repairs was urgent.
"The items we repaired did not
affect operating performance or
airworthiness," he said.
United's Flight 811 was gaining
altitude 100 miles south of here
after taking off for Auckland, New
Zealand, early Friday when a 10-
by-20-foot section of the fuselage
ripped away, including the right
front cargo door.
Nine passengers disappeared

when 10 seats in the business
class on the right side were blown
out through the gaping hole, in
vestigators said.
There was no indication from
the ground crew or cockpit crew
that anything was amiss when the
cargo door was secured for flight,
said Lee Dickinson, a National
Transportation Safety Board in
vestigator.
Dickinson said investigators
have found no evidence of a bomb,
sabotage or metal fatigue that
might have caused the mishap,
and "are focusing on and looking
at the latching mechanism."
"We're also trying to get a bet
ter handle on these latch pin sup
ports and comparing them to
others," he said.
The cargo bay door closed elec
trically, with eight latching mech
anisms along the bottom, attached
to the plane's frame, as well as a
latching mechanism and a hook
pin on each side, Dickinson said.
Investigators determined Sun
day that a warning system, that
would have alerted the cockpit
crew if the door was not closed
properly, did work, Dickinson said
at the NTSB's news briefing Sun
day night.
