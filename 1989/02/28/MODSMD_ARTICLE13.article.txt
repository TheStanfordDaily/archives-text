# Democrats remain opposed to Tower

WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate
Democrats remained unmoved
yesterday in their opposition to
John Tower's nomination as de
fense secretary despite his un
precedented pledge to abstain
from alcohol if confirmed. Presi
dent Bush returned home declar
ing that he hasn't "wavered one
iota" in his support.
Moments before Air Force One
touched down at Andrews Air
Force Base, Bush told reporters
that only "time will tell" as to
whether Tower will win Senate
confirmation.
"I don't have any predictions
nor do I plan to, except to say I
haven't wavered one iota and I
don't intend to," Bush said.
Questioned about the possibil
ity of defeat, Bush said: "Never
address yourself to a hypothesis
that's lying out there in the fu
ture. There's planning, but not
on this one."
The president described Tower
as "the best man for the job and
nobody's challenged that. He
knows where I want to be on de
fense matters. No one's challenged
his qualifications and that's
ironic, as a matter of fact."
Asked if Tower's pledge would
help his cause, Bush shrugged his
shoulders, laughed and said, "I
don't know."
White House Chief of Staff
John Sununu met at the White
House late Monday with Tower,
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., and Sen. John Warner of
Virginia, ranking Republican on

the Senate Armed Services Com
mittee, to discuss the nomination.
During the day, senators
trekked to a special committee
hearing room to read the latest
FBI report on Tower, while those
members the Bush administra
tion hopes to sway indicated they
are either undecided or leaning
against confirmation.

White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater, speaking to reporters
on Air Force One as Bush re
turned to Washington, said the
president will meet with 12
senators beginning early this
morning.
Bush also telephoned DeConcini
from aboard Air Force One and
urged him to reserve judgment
until he had a chance to see all
the evidence, according to the
senator's staff.
