### 
ATLANTA (AP) — Thousands of illegal
aliens may have been shuttled across the
country on a daily Eastern Airlines flight
from Los Angeles to New York, an official
said yesterday after 79 people were ap
prehended.
Agents of the Immigration and Natu
ralization Service apprehended the
suspected illegal aliens shortly after East
ern Flight 80's arrival for a stopover at
Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport.
"We believe this is one of the largest
operations we've conducted that involves
illegal aliens on board commercial aircraft

here in the U. 5.," said Thomas Fischer,
district director of the Atlanta INS office.
"This may be part of a massive alien
smuggling operation," he said, adding
that the INS would continue to investi
gate.
Investigators believe illegal aliens had
been aboard the same Eastern flight
nearly every day for the past 30 days,
said Tom Thomas, an INS press repre
sentative in Atlanta. "It appears at this
point from our sources that it's almost
a daily occurrence," he said.
He estimated that thousands had been

moved across the country on Eastern
airliners. He said authorities did not
know how they entered the country.
Thomas said Eastern had cooperated
fully in the investigation.
"We don't in any way connect Eastern
and don't want to intimate that they
were even remotely involved at this
point," Thomas said.
In Miami, Eastern Airlines press rep
resentative Virginia Sanchez said: "All I
know is that the INS had told us they'd
be monitoring a flight this week and, of
course, we cooperated with them."

The suspected aliens taken off yester
day's flight included 39 from Mexico, 22
from Guatemala, 13 from the Dominican
Republic, three from El Salvador and one
each from Honduras and Ecuador. They
were to be transferred to INS processing
centers in Florida and Texas for deporta
tions, Thomas said.
Thomas said some of the aliens paid
smugglers up to $4,000 for a package
deal, although authorities don't know
what that deal included other than air
fare from California to New York.
"We don't know if that was out of the

country to get into the country — to get
set up in New York," he said, adding
that the package could have included
living arrangements, phony documents
and a job.
Special INS agents working the case
acted on tips from confidential sources
at the Atlanta airport, airline employees,
undercover operations in the Los Angeles
area, and even a commuter, Thomas said.
Thomas speculated that Eastern's
Flight 80 might have been popular be
cause no transfers were involved and
rates might have been cheaper.
