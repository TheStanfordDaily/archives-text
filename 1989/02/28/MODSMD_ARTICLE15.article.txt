# 1 dead, 7 hurt in Rushdie protest
## Moslem theologians declare 'Satanic Verses' author a heretic 
### 
A bomb killed one person and
wounded seven yesterday at a
protest of "The Satanic Verses"
in India, and Britain said Iran's
order to kill author Salman
Rushdie was a "fearful example
of where intolerance may lend."
Activists in Moscow demonstra
ted for Rushdie outside the
Iranian Embassy.
In Karachi, Pakistan, a bomb
exploded at the British Council
library while it was closed Sunday
night, killing a guard.
At least 18 people have been
killed in India and Pakistan since

Feb. 12. Both countries have
banned the novel.
Syria said it banned "The
Satanic Verses," which many
Moslems consider blasphemous, a
month ago and suspended all
dealings with Viking Penguin, the
publisher. The Information Min
istry said the ban includes any
other publishing house that trans
lates or distributes the book.
Moslem theologians meeting in
Mecca, the holy city of Islam,
branded Rushdie a "heretic and
a renegade" yesterday but did not
endorse murdering him. Islamic

law condemns heretics to death,
but only after they are tried and
refuse to repent.
In London, the government
refused a request by British Mos
lems to extend the blasphemy law
to all religions.
Rushdie, 41, was born into a
Moslem family in Bombay, India,
but has become a British citizen
and does not actively practice re
ligion. The writer has been in
hiding and under heavy police
guard since Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini ordered his death.
