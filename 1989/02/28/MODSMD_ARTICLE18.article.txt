## Right of Rushdie 
### 
If universities will not
stand up for Rushdie,
then who else will?

WITH A PRICE TAG on
his head, Salman
Rushdie would never
dare leave hiding and emerge on
the Stanford campus.
However, last week 12 Stan
ford professors requested that
University President Donald
Kennedy issue a formal invitation
to Rushdie — the author of "The
Satanic Verses" — as a demon
stration of Stanford's support for
free expression. Kennedy
demurred: Rushdie could never
accept with his life in jeopardy;
hence, inviting him would serve
no purpose.
Well, yes and no. While extend
ing an invitiation to someone in
capable of accepting is empty
symbolism, that doesn't mean
that the University cannot take
a stand.
For instance, a forceful public
statement from Kennedy con
demning Rushdie's persecution
and calling for other university
presidents to do likewise would
accomplish as much as an invi
tation, and probably more.
Stanford more than anywhere
is a place committed to the ex
change of ideas. But if university
leaders shy away from defending
Rushdie's right to free speech
then who will take a stand?
Embroiled in a free speech
debate of its own, the Stanford
community is learning that the
right to free expression, even if
it gives offense, can sometimes
supersede the right to be free
from grossly offensive expression.
Just as party fliers, posters and

electronic bulletin boards might
offend many a Stanford student,
Rushdie's story is bound to out
rage orthodox Moslems. "The
Satanic Verses" treats some of
Islam's most sacred tenets — the
purity of the Koran, the holy
prophet Mohammed and his
three wives — irreverently in
their eyes.
But the Ayatollah Khomeini vi
olates even the lowest standards
of decency in issuing his assas
sination order.
Regardless of religion, the
civilized world — and especially
the world of the university —
must categorically condemn
Khomeini's terrorist acts.
True enough, the West's (in
cluding Stanford's) ignorance of
Islam exacerbates the anger of
many Moslems. Islam shares a
common religious foundation
with Judaism and Christianity.
When the Western media present
Khomeini's faithful as typical
Moslems, most mainstream Mos
lems are as aggravated as
Christians or Jev/s might be if
the Eastern press presented Jim
Bakker or Meir Kahane as typical
of those respective religions.
While truly informed debate on
"Verses" is limited to those per
sons who have read not only
Rushdie's book but also the
Koran, the latter work offers
some pearls apparently over
looked by Khomeini.
The Koran reads: "There is no
compulsion in religion" (Surah
11, 40); "Begin not hostilities. Lo!
Allah loveth not aggressors"
(Surah 11, 30); and weightiest of
all, with regard to the contract
on the life of the Moslem
Rushdie, "Whoso slayeth a
believer of set purpose, his
reward is Hell forever" (Surah
IV, 93). Fair enough.
