# Second ASSU party emerges for this spring's elections
## 
### Baldwin Lee Staff writer 
ASSU elections moved one step closer
to resembling national elections, when a
second political party called "Students
First" formed last night.
Students First selected a COP slate
and will endorse undergraduate and grad
uate student candidates for the ASSU
Senate.
The new party aims to offer more al
ternatives in the ASSU elections, to be
held April 18 and 19. The People's Plat
form was the only student political party
existing before yesterday.
Sophomore Alex Hoye, a founder of
the new party, said he was dissatisfied
with the one-party system because it did

not allow the interests of all students to
be aired. He noted, "By definition, a one
party system is not representative of all
students."
Junior Anthony Chor, a fellow party
founder, said the large number of "non
group" students, who do not belong to a
special-interest group, were not repre
sented by the People's Platform. He ex
plained, "Students First aims to establish
student government as a forum for all
voices to be heard."
Hoye said the new party "does not
have an axe to grind," but emphasized
that the party was not turning its back
on minority groups.
The People's Platform was very suc
cessful in last year's elections. Of 14 un
dergraduates and graduates endorsed for

senate positions last year, 13 were
elected. The COP slate it endorsed, "A
New Slate of Mind," also was elected.
The People's Platform is meeting torn
morrow to nominate COP and senatorial
candidates.
The primary goal of Students First,
which Chor said differentiates it from the
People's Platform, is a focus on improv
ing life for all students. Although social
issues such as voter registration and a
grape boycott are important, the ASSU's
greatest responsibility is to address issues
that directly affect students, Chor said.
Senior Lucky Gutierrez, last year's
People's Platform campaign manager, de
fended his party. Gutierrez said the

dent issues, such as teaching assistant

The Black Student Union, MEChA (a
Chicano student organization) and the
Asian-American Students Association
have already met to select their recom
mendations for People's Platform en
dorsements. The BSU is recommending
two COP candidates and five senatorial
candidates from its members, according

to BSU press secretary Louis Jackson.
Official endorsements cannot be made
public until April 11, the first day of
campaigning, said ASSU Election Com
missioner Steve Krauss.
Chor said the idea to form Students
First originated during a discussion con
cerning a perceived lack of diverse rep
resentation in the ASSU. Serious thought
about forming a party began a month
ago, and the party has evolved into a
solid core group of about 10 students.
When the People's Platform was
formed in the spring of 1986, no other
political parties existed, according to
Gutierrez. The group was originally
formed to endorse candidates for the
spring election, but it was turned into a
nominating body last March.
