Who Have Considered Suicide When The

AS I TALKED to a close friend of
mine a few nights ago, I began to
think about the worth of the
phrase "I'm sorry." We were talking
about how people are capable of hurting
each other so that saying "I'm sorry" is
insufficient.
What does "I'm sorry" really ac
complish? Does it take away any of the
damage done that would create the need
for such a phrase?
In some instances, "I'm sorry" is suf
ficient to assuage the feelings of pain or
anger that the recipient of the phrase
might feel. Other times, it is inadequate.
For example, if you run over your next
door neighbor's dog, Fifi, and the dog
dies, will "I'm sorry" take away the
owner's pain or grief? No, it won't, but
it does show that you feel remorseful at
having run over Fifi.
In this circumstance, "I'm sorry" is an
accepted phrase, a way of conveying a

feeling of remorse at your actions; yet
there are times when to accept "I'm sor
ry" is to compromise oneself.
For instance, if someone has treated
you badly and hurt your feelings, is an
"I'm sorry" sufficient? Did he or she
purposefully intend to hurt your feelings?
Do intentions really matter, since the
result is the same? Will you be saying
that it is OK to treat people badly if you
accept an "I'm sorry" for their actions?
There is a fine line between being un
forgiving and telling someone (by accept
ing their "sorry"), "it's okay to be
inconsiderate."
Normally, "I'm sorry" is a way of tell
ing the person wronged that you did not
intend to hurt them and regret having
done so, assuming that the apology is
sincere. Well, the person who receives the
apology has a few choices:
1. He or she can accept it and can
forgive and forget the matter.
2. He or she can refuse to accept the
apology.
3. He or she can accept the apology
but refrain from excusing the action.
The third response implies that you
take into account the intentions of the
apologizer. You may be able to accept
that he or she did not hurt you inten
tionally, but that does not necessarily
mean that you excuse the perpetrator for
his or her actions. Saying "I'm sorry;
that's just the way I am" is not an excuse
for certain types of behavior; if something
is unacceptable, the offender should be
made aware of it.
An apology for a physical injury is
easier to accept than one for a mental
or psychological injury. For example, if

Saying I'm sorry; that's just
the way I am' is not an
excuse for certain types of
behavior; if something is
unacceptable, the offender
should be made aware of it.

someone steps on your foot it is easy
injury. If someone steps on your feelings,
you cannot help but feel that it could
have been prevented •
Furthermore, it is easier to heal a
bruised foot than a bruised heart. When
both have been damaged, as in cases of
child abuse, healing becomes even more
difficult. Physical scars will eventually
disappear, but psychological scars will
remain for a long time. "I'm sorry" is
definitely insufficient in this instance.
When dealing with feelings and emo
tions, there are never clear-cut answers.
The key is to treat people the same way
you want to be treated. This should cut
down on the need for apologies for psy
chological injuries, and create a more
thoughtful and considerate group of
'ndividuals.
