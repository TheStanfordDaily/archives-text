## Irksome speakers are needed for thorough debates 
### 
WE ARE WRITING in reply to
Aamer Hai's Feb. 23 letter
entitled "Inviting Rushdie to
Speak on Campus may irk Moslems."
Without intending to sound harsh â€”
"So what?" We have nothing against
Moslems, Jews, Pro-lifers, Pro-choicers,
contras, Sandinistas, feminists, frats or
feral cats. But we find it extremely
disturbing to constantly hear "so-and
so's speech may offend me; therefore,
he/she should not be invited to apeak
here."
If not here, where? UC-Berkeley,
Harvard, USC, nowhere? How can we

learn anything by listening only to
those with whom we agree? One of the
purposes of Stanford is to provide a
forum for discussion and education
through debate. When special interest
groups (whether liberal or conserva
tive) constantly whine about speakers
they don't like, we run the risk of
closing our forum, our education and
our minds.
An invitation to speak on campus
does not imply that the University
supports the speaker, as Hai states.
Koppel and MacNeil and Lehrer, with
out supporting or opposing the

speaker, discuss and debate many
volatile issues. Their goal is not to
"agree" or "disagree" but to open
discussion and hear all sides of an
issue. This should be our goal as well.
What difference does it make if we
invite Louis Farakhan one week and
David Duke the next? Many people
disagree with them both on many
issues, but that does not mean we
cannot learn more about ourselves by
listening to them. Even if we come
only to strengthen our current
opinions, at least we gain a better
understanding of our opponents.

An educated person is not formed in
box, and as educated people it is our
obligation to react to unusual situa
tions with rational thought and dis
course rather than with emotionality
and earplugs. When we can listen to
someone who we think is "full of it,"
and yet respectfully disagree, we will
be on our way to a full, diverse and
truly educational experience.
