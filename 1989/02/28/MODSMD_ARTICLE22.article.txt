# Discussions ignore pain caused by Rushdie's book
## 
### 
I have followed with great concern
the lopsided coverage given to the blas
phemy and preposterous lies of a man
who is apparently devoid of integrity
and honesty â€” a must for a man of
letters and research. The media cover
age of Salmam Rushdie has been sadly
devoid of truth and has presented the
facts in a distorted and twisted man
ner.
As a Moslem, I echo the feelings of
my fellow believers and all men of
rational thought when I say that free
dom is a right and a cherished thing
as long as it does not infringe upon
the rights and freedom of fellow
beings. Freedom of expression is a
must as long as it is backed by facts
and proof and is not used to hurl
abuses.
When a so-called author uses free
dom of expression to fill his greed and
writes garbage with no facts and re
search to back it, it becomes the duty

of all honest writers of integrity to
publicly disown such a person.
While freedom of expression is a
right, it is also a responsibility. If
someone flaunts this right even in
normal terms, i.e., writes so much as a
line or word about a person without
proof, he is sued and taken to court.
He is tried by the law to which he
subscribes.
The so-called author of "The Satanic
Verses" is guilty of blasphemy against
the most sacred of Islamic beliefs and
does so with utter lack of integrity
driven by pure lust for money and joy
of hurting other Moslems.
Since he is a Moslem, he subscribes
to the law of Allah above all other
man-made laws. In Islamic jurispru
dence his blasphemy is punishable by
death.
Salman Rushdie by his own belief
considers British law subservient to
God's law. In fact, the government of
the United Kingdom should extradite
him to any Moslem country which may
or may not be Iran. Any Islamic court
would endorse the capital punishment
in conjunction with Islamic shariah
(law).
It was really astonishing to read that
some professors are so carried away by

the one-sided media coverage that they
actually asked to honor a man who is
a shame to the name of honest and
conscientous authors all over the world.
Salman Rushdie has committed an
atrocity and crime of unimaginable
pain and suffering to millions all over
the world. He too must be hunted
down and punished. It is exactly like
hunting down the Hitler junta, and the
whole world should realize the suffer
ings and pain caused by the greed of
one person and should extend all help
in finding him and extraditing him to
any Moslem country for trial.
