The suggestion of inviting Salman
Rushdie to speak at Stanford confuses
two issues. One is the ❖ery important
and laudable freedom-to-publish issue.
On that we should all stand firm and

not be cowed by threats from the
Ayatollah Rutollah Khomeini.
The second issue is the basis on
which we invite authors to speak at
Stanford. If Rushdie is to be invited
here, it should be because of the
literary merits of his book, not because
of our sympathy with the author's
plight. In our desire to fight vigorously
for free speech, we should not forget
our standards of academic excellence.
