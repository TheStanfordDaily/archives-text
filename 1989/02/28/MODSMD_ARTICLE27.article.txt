## Giving voice to the gay and lesbian experience Founders of Bay Area feminist movement to speak 
### Linda Garber 
At a recent book release party in San
Francisco, poet Judy Grahn recalled
with a laugh that she and her friends
never dared to dream of founding any
thing like the enormous Bay Area
lesbian-feminist movement when they
began the Women's Press Collective in
Oakland in the early 19705.
Almost 20 years later, the small pub
lishing collective is gone, but lesbian
poetry and the feminist, antiracist and
antihomophobic politics with which it is
intimately connected still thrive.
The movement — both poetic and
political — has grown to include thou
sands of young women, but it is still
led in large part by poets and activists
who have been around since the early
days. Pat Parker, Willyce Kim and
Avotjca — three of these artists, ac
tivists and leaders — will come to Stan
ford on March 2 to read their poetry
in honor of Women's History Week.

Bay Area poets, ac
tivists and lesbian
leaders Pat Parker,
Willyce Kim and
Avotjca will come to
Stanford on March 2
to read their poetry in
honor of Women's His
tory Week.

The public readings of black poet Pat
Parker and Judy Grahn in the late
1960s and early 1970s were among the
very first community gatherings of
feminists, whether lesbian or heterosex
ual. The readings are still looked to by
antiracist feminists as one of the few
times that a black woman and a white
woman have consistently shared the
stage at a cultural/political event.
The readings led to much of the wide
spread activism, education and
"consciousness-raising" that marked
the early women's liberation movement
and gave rise to the pluralistic coalition
politics of the 1980s.
Parker's poetry is direct, musical and
uncompromising. It is a poetry of com
plex and painful identity, as she writes,
"I am a child of America/ a step child/
raised in a back room." But it is also
poetry of strength and emancipation,
as she warns the traditional world of
women's domestic "duty" in her poem
"Exodus": "Trust me no more."
Much of Parker's poetry asserts a
strong, independent self who will not
deny any part of herself as black, wom
an, lesbian, mother. She acknowledges
in one of her most famous and ex
quisitely painful poems that "I, Woman
must be/ the child of myself."
With many of her poems and public

actions, Parker has shown women the
way to create and sustain themselves
in an oppressive society. She concerns
herself with defining herself, in oppo
sition to the ways in which the "they"
of white, straight, male-dominated so
ciety would describe us all.
In recent years Parker has often per
formed in the Bay Area with Avotcja,
a black Puerto Rican lesbian musician
and poet. Avotcja brings her bilingual
and multicultural background to her
craft. She performs and recites a capella
with a variety of indigenous instru
ments, often inviting her audience to
help create rhythms evoking the Puerto

Rican rainforests or the noisy street of
Spanish Harlem where she grew up.
Avotcja skillfully blends music, poetry
and direct political commentary in her
charged, emotional performances. Her
first book of poetry is due out in the
spring. Meanwhile, Bay Area residents
hear her perform locally and as a disc
jockey on KPFA FM.
Willyce Kim's first book of poetry,
"Eating Artichokes," was published by
the groundbreaking Women's Press Col
lective in 1972. At once intelligent,
angry and loving, Kim's poetry captures
the razor-eged spirit of the early worn

en's liberation movement at its finest:
"You want an angry poem/ Allright/
Strip us both down and/ compare./ The
scars on my body/ are laced along the
front/ The scars on your body/ are found
running across/ your back/ Did you see
the enemy/ and run, coward."
Always tough, Kim is often respect
fully, beautifully tender:
Let's hear it for reality, babe.
How I came back home to you.
It's been one year,
and several beds later
The door opening
and your face washing
over me
like cold water
on a winter morning,
and I prayed
as your arms swam around me
I prayed
that for those few hours
you wouldn't love me,
but miracles aren't
being sold these days
and I'm not strong enough
to turn around ...
As an outspoken Asian-American les
bian, Kim gives voice to an experience
and an oppression rarely confronted spe
cifically by even the feminist movement.
Kim writes in a "Young Woman in the
Arkansas Hills" that "Maybe she'd
never seen an Asian before," and im
mediately the reader feels the cold,
curious stare of the white girl who later
ran "out and hid / behind a corner of
the building."
Recently Kim has turned her talents
to prose writing. Her most recent book,
"Dead Heat," is an adventure/mystery
set in the San Francisco Bay Area. It
follows the characters from her earlier
novel, "Dancer Dawkins and the Cali
fornia Kid."
Independently and together, Willyce
Kim, Avotcja and Pat Parker have been
writing, speaking and organizing
against racism, sexism and homophobia
since the beginnings of the women's
movement and the civil rights move
ments of the 19605. Their performance
this week at Stanford continues a vital
artistic and political tradiiton as it
points us toward the future as a com
munity devoted to respect for all of its
members.
Parker, Kim and Avotcja will appear
in the Tressidor Oak Lounge at 8 p.m.
on Thursday, March 2. Admission is
free and open to the public; a reception
for the poets and audience will follow
the reading.
