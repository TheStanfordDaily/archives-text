# Where Will You Be?
## 
### 
Boots are being polished
Trumpeters clean their horns
Chains and locks forged
The crusade has begun.
I do not believe as some
that the vote is an end,
I fear even more
It is just a beginning.
So I must make assessment
Look to you and ask:
Where will you be
when they come?
Where will we all be
when they come?
And they will come â€”
they will come
because we are
defined as opposite ...
from "Movement in Black: The
Collected Poetry of Pat Parker,
1961-1978"
