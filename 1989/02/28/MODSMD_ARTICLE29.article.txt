"Equal Affections"

Much has been made of David
Leavitt's youth. His first story was pub
lished in The New Yorker at the age of
20, his first collection of short stories,
"Family Dancing," at 23 and his first
full-length novel, "The Lost Language
of Cranes," at 25. His latest novel, "E
-qual Affections," ensures his status as
a well-established author — and this at
the age of 27.
Of course, age is not the sole criterion
by which we judge an author. But it is
impossible to read Leavitt and ignore
this factor. For not only is
"Equal Affections" surprisingly fluid, it
is also uncannily wise in its understand
ing of human interactions.
Leavitt's domain is the strained, sad
nature of familial relations. "Equal Af
fections" traces the slow disintegration
of the Cooper family as its members
confront the death of its matriarch,
Louise. Louise Cooper's cancer serves
to open and close the novel; it twists its
way through "Equal Affections" with
quiet oppresiveness.
"Illness," Leavitt writes, "moved into
their house like an elderly aunt in a
back bedroom. It lived with them; it sat
at the kitchen with them; it became
ordinary."
As Leavitt says, illness is the "dividing
line" of this novel. Before this line, as
we see in a series of flashbacks, strained
relations are repressed or ignored. After
it, problems between the Coopers are
revealed with uncomfortable clarity.
Leavitt treats his characters with com
passion, but does not gloss over the
roughness of their existence. After
Louise dies, her children, now grown,
meet for a weekend at the shore. As
they sit on the beach, Danny turns to
his sister, April, and asks "Do you think
she had a terrible life — our mother?"
April pauses, looks at the moon, and
answers "Yes."
Leavitt's treatment of homosexuality
is less aggressively didactic here than
in his previous novel, "The Lost Lan
guage of Cranes." The fact that both
Danny and April are gay is an issue,
but one subordinate to the novel's pri
mary theme of family.
Danny leads a suburban life with his
long-time lover, Walter, on the outskirts
of New York. They watch porn on their
VCR and eat take-out food from con
tainers. His sister, April, tours across
the country with her all-woman band
singing feminist music. Less
monogamous than her brother, she has
affairs with various women; at the end
of the novel she becomes impregnated
by artificial insemination.
Danny and April's relationships are,
like their parent's, alternately satisfying
and lonely. They do not shock us because
they reflect an all-too recognizable
search for meaning in the orderless

world of 1980s America.
Some have criticized Leavitt for his
refusal to shock, saying he has bleached
homosexuality of its power and rendered
it unnaturally accessible to the hetero
sexual world. (Leavitt's story in The
New Yorker was the first the magazine
had ever run dealing explicitly with
homosexuality.)
But strident prose would be inconsis
tent with Leavitt's writing as a whole.
The homosexuality of the author's char
acters seems consistent with the author
himself; it is not blatantly political be
cause Leavitt himself is not.
If "Equal Affections" deserves
criticism, it is for its occasional stag
nancy. The novel lacks drive. Too often,
we feel we are reading a loose collection
of scenes, each compelling in its own
right, but lacking force and cohesion as
a whole.
This is a small price to pay for a novel
otherwise so rich. "Equal Affections" is
a sensitive and honest work. While
Leavitt refutes that he is the "voice of
the new generation," as some critics
have suggested, he is certainly one voice
worth listening to.
