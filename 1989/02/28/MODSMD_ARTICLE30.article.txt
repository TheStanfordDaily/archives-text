# Sources for liberation: a growing corpus of women's bookstores
## 
### Elizabeth Howton Editorial staff 
In recent years, the greater Bay Area
has witnessed a growing body of feminist,
gay and lesbian bookstores. No longer
must one trek to San Jose or Oakland
(though some of these stores are still
worth the trip); options now exist closer
to Stanford.
The tradition of Bay Area women's
bookstores began in 1971 with Oakland's
A Woman's Place, said to be the first
women's bookstore in the country. The
most recent in this trend is Two Sisters
Bookshop, which opened in Menlo Park
in June 1988.
In between, at least nine other stores
specializing in women's and gay/lesbian
titles have appeared in the Bay Area.
Visiting these bookstores is more than
going shopping, it's an experience. Many
of them are also coffeehouses, community
centers or entertainment venues. Most
have community bulletin boards, monthly
newsletters and regular programs of au
thors reading from their works.
The following is one bookstore lover's
somewhat impressionistic guide to Bay
Area bookstores.
Women's Bookstores
The following bookstores carry fiction
and literature by women, women's
studies books in all categories, biography,
lesbian fiction and non-fiction, books on
women's health issues and non-sexist
children's books. Most also have a smat
tering of gay male-interest titles.
Two Sisters Bookshop, the closest
women's bookstore to Stanford, was, as
its name suggests, founded by two sisters
(in the biological sense of the word).
Suzanne Unger and Betsy Warner were
searching for an escape from"the patriar
chal workplace," as Warner puts it; they
wanted to be self-employed.
The store is anything but patriarchal.
Warner says one of the store's goals is
"to bring about the emergence of female
energy on the planet and to support

women and men in transition." It is a
restful, comfortable place to browse or
just to sit and read on one of the chintz
covered couches.
In addition to books, there are crystals,
tapes and videotapes everywhere, reflect
ing the bookstore's strong emphasis on
healing and spirituality. Warner and lin
ger avoid the term "feminist" to describe
their store, saying the term is too "po
litical and warlike."
Behind the spacious main room of the
store is the "living room," which doubles
as a gallery and community meeting
space. Two Sisters holds several events
here each month, including astrological
readings, concerts, massage workshops
and book readings.
Two Sisters Bookshop is located at 605
Cambridge Ave. in Menlo Park. It is open
Tuesday and Thursday 10 a.m.-7 p.m.,
Wednesday and Friday 10 a.m.-lO p.m.,
Saturday 10 a.m.-5 p.m., Sunday noon-5
p.m. and closed Monday. For more in
formation, call 323-4778.
Echoing the theme of sisterhood, Sis
terspirit aims to bring together the San
Jose area women's community through
its bookstore, weekly coffeehouses, dances
and other special events. One conscious
goal of the collective is to provide a social
alternative to bars for the lesbian and
feminist community.
Sisterspirit was founded in 1984 and
is run as a non-profit collective. In 1986
it moved to its current location in the
Billy DeFrank Lesbian and Gay Commu
nity Center. The store is small but well
stocked, featuring lesbian magazines and
a good selection of women's poetry books.
Sisterspirit is located at 1040 Park Ave.
in San Jose. It is open Monday through
Friday 6:30-9 p.m., Satutday 3-6 p.m.,
and Sunday 1-4 p.m. For more informa
tion, call (408) 293-9372.
When asked if her store is a collective,
Mama Bears co-owner Alice Molloy ex
claims, "God, no! Make that 'Goddess,
no.' We're entrepreneurs, not bureau
crats. And we probably make less profit
than the 'non-profit' stores do."
She should know, since she and the

other owner of Mama Bears, Carol Wil
son, helped to found the collectively
owned bookstore A Woman's Place in
Oakland in 1971. In 1983, the collective
split up, and Molloy and Wilson founded
Mama Bears.
Molloy argues that the "capitalist"
mode actually helps the women's com
munity, citing the trendsetting jewelry
that shows up first in women's bookstores
and then moves into the mainstream.
She sees Mama Bears as a place to
cultivate women's culture, both through
the books sold and the performances,
readings and forums in the coffeehouse
section of the bookstore. This coffeehouse
also provides space for women-only,
alcohol-free socializing every Thursday
night.
The store's newsletter, "Mama Bears
News & Notes" is almost a full-fledged
newspaper, with articles, reviews and
columnists. It has been more successful
than many other Bay Area women's
newspapers, which generally seem
doomed to failure.
Mama Bears is located at 6536
Telegraph Ave. in Oakland (just outside
Berkeley). It is open 10 a.m.-7 p.m. every
day. For more information, call 428-9684.
The grande dame of Bay Area women's

bookstores is Old Wives Talcs, which ar
guably has the largest selection of any
of the women's bookstores. The store's
selection is particularly strong in books
on women of color, but all areas are well
represented.
The store is spacious and attractive,
especially with the recent addition of a
second room which has nearly doubled
the store's floorspace. A women-only
lounge houses community bulletin
boards, couches and a visitor's guide to
the city.
Readings are held every Thursday
night, and a catalogue of the store's stock
is available for $1. The store is run by
a collective, which now consists of three
women assisted by three part-time
workers.
Old Wives Tales is located at 1009
Valencia St.in San Francisco. It is open
Monday through Wednesday and Friday
11 a.m.-7p.m., Thursday 11 a.m.- 9p.m.,
and Saturday and Sunday 11 a.m.-6p.m.
For more information, call 821-4675.
A Woman's Place Bookstore and In
formation Center has experienced finan
cial difficulties over the past few years,
but continues to survive. It provides
meeting space for various groups and for
women's socializing.
A Woman's Place is located at 4015

Broadway in Oakland. It is open Thurs
day 3-9 p.m., Friday 3-7 p.m., Saturday
noon-9 p.m., Sunday noon-6 p.m. and
closed Monday through Wednesday. For
more information, call 654-3645 or 547-
9920.
As ou Like It Books has a more
academic focus than the other women's
bookstores, stocking mainly women's
studies, ethnic studies and Shakespeare.
As You Like It is located at 2556
Telegraph Ave. in Berkeley. It is open
Monday through Saturday 10 a.m.-6p.m.
and Sunday noon-6 p.m. For more in
formation, call 848-2291.
Gay and Lesbian Bookstores
Located in the heart of San Francisco's
Castro District, A Different Light Book
store buzzes with customers until late at
night, as tourists and locals alike discover
the wealth of books on the gay and lesbian
experience. A Different Light has
branches in New York and Los Angeles
as well.
A Different Light Bookstore is located
at 489 Castro St.in San Francisco. It is
open Sunday through Thursday 10 a.m.-
11 p.m. and Friday and Saturday 10
a.m.-midnight.
The Walt Whitman Bookshop, named
for "the great gay poet," used to stock
only gay male titles, but has expanded
into lesbian books as well.
Walt Whitman Bookshop has recently
moved to 1429 Polk St.in San Francisco.
It is open Monday through Thursday 10
a.m.-lO p.m. and Friday and Saturday
10 a.m.-midnight. For more information,
call 861-3078.
For its wide selection and pleasant at
mosphere, The Love That Dares was my
favorite gay and lesbian bookstore until
it burned down late last year. It is tem
porarily closed, but hopefully will reopen
soon.
The Ijove That Dares islwas located at
506 Castro St.in San Francisco. For

In recent years, the greater Bay Area
has witnessed a growing body of feminist,
gay and lesbian bookstores. No longer
must one trek to San Jose or Oakland
(though some of these stores are still
worth the trip); options now exist closer
to Stanford.
The tradition of Bay Area women's
bookstores began in 1971 with Oakland's
A Woman's Place, said to be the first
women's bookstore in the country. The
most recent in this trend is Two Sisters
Bookshop, which opened in Menlo Park
in June 1988.
In between, at least nine other stores
specializing in women's and gay/lesbian
titles have appeared in the Bay Area.
Visiting these bookstores is more than
going shopping, it's an experience. Many
of them are also coffeehouses, community
centers or entertainment venues. Most
have community bulletin boards, monthly
newsletters and regular programs of au
thors reading from their works.
The following is one bookstore lover's
somewhat impressionistic guide to Bay
Area bookstores.
Women's Bookstores
The following bookstores carry fiction
and literature by women, women's
studies books in all categories, biography,
lesbian fiction and non-fiction, books on
women's health issues and non-sexist
children's books. Most also have a smat
tering of gay male-interest titles.
Two Sisters Bookshop, the closest
women's bookstore to Stanford, was, as
its name suggests, founded by two sisters
(in the biological sense of the word).
Suzanne Unger and Betsy Warner were
searching for an escape from"the patriar
chal workplace," as Warner puts it; they
wanted to be self-employed.
The store is anything but patriarchal.
Warner says one of the store's goals is
"to bring about the emergence of female
energy on the planet and to support

women and men in transition." It is a
restful, comfortable place to browse or
just to sit and read on one of the chintz
covered couches.
In addition to books, there are crystals,
tapes and videotapes everywhere, reflect
ing the bookstore's strong emphasis on
healing and spirituality. Warner and lin
ger avoid the term "feminist" to describe
their store, saying the term is too "po
litical and warlike."
Behind the spacious main room of the
store is the "living room," which doubles
as a gallery and community meeting
space. Two Sisters holds several events
here each month, including astrological
readings, concerts, massage workshops
and book readings.
Two Sisters Bookshop is located at 605
Cambridge Ave. in Menlo Park. It is open
Tuesday and Thursday 10 a.m.-7 p.m.,
Wednesday and Friday 10 a.m.-lO p.m.,
Saturday 10 a.m.-5 p.m., Sunday noon-5
p.m. and closed Monday. For more in
formation, call 323-4778.
Echoing the theme of sisterhood, Sis
terspirit aims to bring together the San
Jose area women's community through
its bookstore, weekly coffeehouses, dances
and other special events. One conscious
goal of the collective is to provide a social
alternative to bars for the lesbian and
feminist community.
Sisterspirit was founded in 1984 and
is run as a non-profit collective. In 1986
it moved to its current location in the
Billy DeFrank Lesbian and Gay Commu
nity Center. The store is small but well
stocked, featuring lesbian magazines and
a good selection of women's poetry books.
Sisterspirit is located at 1040 Park Ave.
in San Jose. It is open Monday through
Friday 6:30-9 p.m., Satutday 3-6 p.m.,
and Sunday 1-4 p.m. For more informa
tion, call (408) 293-9372.
When asked if her store is a collective,
Mama Bears co-owner Alice Molloy ex
claims, "God, no! Make that 'Goddess,
no.' We're entrepreneurs, not bureau
crats. And we probably make less profit
than the 'non-profit' stores do."
She should know, since she and the

other owner of Mama Bears, Carol Wil
son, helped to found the collectively
owned bookstore A Woman's Place in
Oakland in 1971. In 1983, the collective
split up, and Molloy and Wilson founded
Mama Bears.
Molloy argues that the "capitalist"
mode actually helps the women's com
munity, citing the trendsetting jewelry
that shows up first in women's bookstores
and then moves into the mainstream.
She sees Mama Bears as a place to
cultivate women's culture, both through
the books sold and the performances,
readings and forums in the coffeehouse
section of the bookstore. This coffeehouse
also provides space for women-only,
alcohol-free socializing every Thursday
night.
The store's newsletter, "Mama Bears
News & Notes" is almost a full-fledged
newspaper, with articles, reviews and
columnists. It has been more successful
than many other Bay Area women's
newspapers, which generally seem
doomed to failure.
Mama Bears is located at 6536
Telegraph Ave. in Oakland (just outside
Berkeley). It is open 10 a.m.-7 p.m. every
day. For more information, call 428-9684.

wanted to be self-employed.
The store is anything but patriarchal.
Warner says one of the store's goals is
"to bring about the emergence of female
energy on the planet and to support

women and men in transition." It is a
restful, comfortable place to browse or
just to sit and read on one of the chintz
covered couches.
In addition to books, there are crystals,
tapes and videotapes everywhere, reflect
ing the bookstore's strong emphasis on
healing and spirituality. Warner and lin
ger avoid the term "feminist" to describe
their store, saying the term is too "po
litical and warlike."
Behind the spacious main room of the
store is the "living room," which doubles
as a gallery and community meeting
space. Two Sisters holds several events
here each month, including astrological
readings, concerts, massage workshops
and book readings.
Two Sisters Bookshop is located at 605
Cambridge Ave. in Menlo Park. It is open
Tuesday and Thursday 10 a.m.-7 p.m.,
Wednesday and Friday 10 a.m.-lO p.m.,
Saturday 10 a.m.-5 p.m., Sunday noon-5
p.m. and closed Monday. For more in

Echoing the theme of sisterhood, Sis
terspirit aims to bring together the San
Jose area women's community through
its bookstore, weekly coffeehouses, dances
and other special events. One conscious
goal of the collective is to provide a social
alternative to bars for the lesbian and
feminist community.
Sisterspirit was founded in 1984 and
is run as a non-profit collective. In 1986
it moved to its current location in the
Billy DeFrank Lesbian and Gay Commu
nity Center. The store is small but well
stocked, featuring lesbian magazines and
a good selection of women's poetry books.
Sisterspirit is located at 1040 Park Ave.
in San Jose. It is open Monday through
Friday 6:30-9 p.m., Satutday 3-6 p.m.,
and Sunday 1-4 p.m. For more informa
tion, call (408) 293-9372.
When asked if her store is a collective,
Mama Bears co-owner Alice Molloy ex
claims, "God, no! Make that 'Goddess,
no.' We're entrepreneurs, not bureau
crats. And we probably make less profit
than the 'non-profit' stores do."
She should know, since she and the

other owner of Mama Bears, Carol Wil
son, helped to found the collectively
owned bookstore A Woman's Place in
Oakland in 1971. In 1983, the collective
split up, and Molloy and Wilson founded
Mama Bears.
Molloy argues that the "capitalist"
mode actually helps the women's com
munity, citing the trendsetting jewelry
that shows up first in women's bookstores
and then moves into the mainstream.
She sees Mama Bears as a place to
cultivate women's culture, both through
the books sold and the performances,
readings and forums in the coffeehouse
section of the bookstore. This coffeehouse
also provides space for women-only,
alcohol-free socializing every Thursday
night.
The store's newsletter, "Mama Bears
News & Notes" is almost a full-fledged
newspaper, with articles, reviews and
columnists. It has been more successful
than many other Bay Area women's
newspapers, which generally seem
doomed to failure.
Mama Bears is located at 6536
Telegraph Ave. in Oakland (just outside
Berkeley). It is open 10 a.m.-7 p.m. every
day. For more information, call 428-9684.
The grande dame of Bay Area women's

bookstores is Old Wives Talcs, which ar
guably has the largest selection of any
of the women's bookstores. The store's
selection is particularly strong in books
on women of color, but all areas are well
represented.
The store is spacious and attractive,
especially with the recent addition of a
second room which has nearly doubled
the store's floorspace. A women-only
lounge houses community bulletin
boards, couches and a visitor's guide to
the city.
Readings are held every Thursday
night, and a catalogue of the store's stock
is available for $1. The store is run by
a collective, which now consists of three
women assisted by three part-time
workers.
Old Wives Tales is located at 1009
Valencia St.in San Francisco. It is open
Monday through Wednesday and Friday
11 a.m.-7p.m., Thursday 11 a.m.- 9p.m.,
