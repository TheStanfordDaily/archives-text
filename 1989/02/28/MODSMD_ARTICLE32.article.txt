## Here she is, Gretchen Carlson As Miss America, senior wants to improve pageant's image 
### Eric Muñoz 
When Gretchen Elizabeth
Carlson stopped out of Stanford
in 1987, she did not tell anybody
why. One year later, on Sept.
16, 1988, Carlson, a senior
majoring in sociology, was
crowned Miss America.
Stanford —» and the world —
finally knew her secret.
As the new Miss America,
Carlson took time out from her
four-to five-city-a-week travel
ing schedule to candidly discuss
her new role in a phone inter
view with The Daily.
"I'm doing something
everyday. There is no consider
ation of where you're at or
where >ou're going, " she said,
adding that she has an itemized
list of where she will be every
day of the month.
"It's not a glamorous job by
any means," she said.
Carlson said she feels her
most important job as Miss
America is to help improve the
image of the pageant.
"First of all, the Miss America
Pageant is not a 'beauty'
pageant but a scholarship
pageant," Carlson said. Since
most of the pageant is organized
by more than 300,000 state and
local volunteers, all of the
money that sponsors contribute
goes to educational scholarships,
she explained.
Carlson will receive over
$30,000 in scholarship money.
"My goal is to change the at
titude about what the pageant
stands for. Pageants build con
fidence, discipline and self
esteem," she said.
"The Miss America Pageant,"
said Carlson, "is analogous to
an athlete preparing for the
Olympics. I spent two hours a
day practicing the violin, three
hours a day with a professional
body consultant and took inten
sive courses in world politics."
Despite her 16 years of violin
experience, 12 years of piano ex

perience, 12 years in choir and
vocal ensembles, seven years in
ballet and drama and a 93rd
percentile score on the LSATS,
Carlson said she still finds the
public perceiving her as just an
other dumb blond.
"I'm always defending my
credentials," she said. "Let me
perform (the violin) so you can
see some of the qualities which
got me here."
Carlson said she believes that,
through her efforts, the pageant
is finally being understood.
"The Miss America Pageant
is a lot like the women's move
ment which started a long time
ago and only now are we seeing
the effects of it, " she explained.
"The Miss America Pageant

has, from the beginning,
stressed dynamic, all-around
contestants and only now is the
public starting to see the
Pageant for what it really is."
Carlson said she has been sur
prised at the Stanford commu
nity's general reaction to her
becoming Miss America.
"I thought they would be
more mature than they have
been," Carlson said. "Perhaps
jealousy is the right word."
Carlson said she hopes people
at Stanford will treat her like
a "normal student" when she
returns. "One can't compare
what I've done, the things I've
gone through, the places I've
been or the people I've met with
the experiences at Stanford."


Even though she met Mickey himself, Gretchen Carlson, Stanford
senior and Miss America 1988-89, still insists that meeting
President Reagan was the "highlight" of her experience.
