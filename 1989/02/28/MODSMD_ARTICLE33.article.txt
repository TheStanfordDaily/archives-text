## Six-Pac preview: Card nine second to Wildcats 
### Bruce Sarkisian Senior staff writer 
When asked what all Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division winners had
in common, Stanford Coach Mark Mar
quess responded: "Pitching, defense and
power — and there's not a lot of power
this year."
Stanford was not the only team in
the Six-Pac to lose many of its power
hitters from last season. Defending con
ference champion Arizona State lost 300
RBI off a team that produced 590 RBI
last season, including its leading home
run hitter, Tim Spehr.
There are more freshmen playing
starting roles in the Six-Pac this year
than ever before, and they will have to
fill in the offensive gaps left by gradu
ation and last year's Major League draft.
With one notable exception, the
youngsters will determine the fate of
the Six-Pac this season:
Arizona Wildcats
The Wildcats are the exception to the
freshman rule. Their entire starting
lineup returns from last season except
for right fielder Dave Shermet and All
Six-Pac pitcher Frank Halcovich.
"They have more veterans returning
than everybody, and in this league, ex
perience really helps,'' Marquess noted.
Arizona will be counting heavily on
the services of catcher Alan Zinter, a
preseason All-America by Baseball
America magazine. Zinter hit .339 last
season and had 55 RBI. Also returning
is All Six-Pac center fielder Kevin Long,
who was tied with Shermet for the team
lead in home runs last year with 10.
If there is a question mark for the
'Cats it is pitching. Two veterans
return: lefties Lance Dickson and Jim

Richardson, who were both starters last
year. But the person whom Coach Jerry
Kindall is most counting on to fill the
gap left by Halcovich is junior college
transfer Scott Erickson, who has already
compiled a 6-1 record thus far.
Last Season: 10-20 (6th)
Predicted Finish: 18-12 (Ist)
Stanford Cardinal
Last Season 18-12 (2nd)
Predicted Finish: 17-13 (T2nd)
California Golden Bears
Cal's best asset is its pitching, and
the Bears' offense has a good mixture
of veterans and freshmen, all of whom
can steal bases. The combination should
result in a squad that will inhabit the
upper echelons of the Six-Pac.
Senior Mike Matthews and juniors
Mark Juhas and Travis Willis form a
three-man starting rotation that will

keep the opposition under three runs
in just about every game. Willis was
the team leader in innings pitched last
season and has only improved with age.
Joe Buckley, Cal's ace reliever with five
saves and a 2.92 ERA last season, also
returns.
Offensively, Todd Mayo will be the
leadoff batter again this year. If he gets
on base, he's dangerous, as is the second
batter in the lineup Daryl Vice, who
currently leads the team in stolen bases.
Freshmen Mike Harrison and Dan
Cholowsky will both start, and give Cal
an added dimension of power.
Last Season: 16-14 (3rd)
Predicted Finish: 17-13 (T2nd)
Arizona State Sun Devils
It's difficult to place one of Jim


April Pearson — Daily
Second Baseman Frank Carey takes a cut. Carey and the Stanford baseball team
should finish second in the tough Sixpac conference.
Brock's teams in the second divi
sion of the Six-Pac, but of all the
coaches in the league, Brock lost
the most to graduation and the
draft.
Offensively, they lost a lot of
production in the persons of Mar
tin Peralta, Ricky Candelari, and
Tim Spehr. However, the team
has two returning Ail-Americans,
first baseman Dan Rumsey and
second baseman Kevin Higgins.
Brock will also depend heavily on
the bat of Steve Willis, the Devils
second-leading hitter last season.
Where the Devils are really hur
ting is in the pitching department.
Gone are their best starter, Linty
Ingram, and their best reliever
Bias Minor. Rusty Kilgo had a
fine season last year and will have
to carry the pitching staff. Fresh
men Kip Vaughn and Sean Rees
will have to contribute.
With at least three and maybe
five starting positions going to
freshmen, the Devils are a young
team. They still have an explosive
offensive and it will be up to the
young pitching staff to hold Six-
Pac opponents down until the hit
ting can finish them off.
Last Season: 21-9
Predicted Finish: 16-14 (4th)
USC Trojans
If All-American third baseman
Rodney Peete had not decided to
forgo baseball in favor of his foot
ball career, the Trojans would be
a lot scarier. As it is, they're still
not patsies.
Coach Mike Gillespie will miss

Peete's .338 average and 46 RBI,
but even more, he'll miss the serv
ices of Jim Campanis (yes that's
Al's grandson), who knocked in a
league-leading 92 RBI and
crushed 23 home runs, also a
league high.
But the Trojan infield is strong
without Peete. Second Baseman
Bret Boone, a preseason Ail-
American, will anchor the corps.
He batted .328 with 53 RBI last
season. Murph Proctor's solid bat
will be in the lineup at first base.
In the outfield, Damon Buford, a
freshman All-America last year
with five homers and 29 RBI,
returns with John Jackson, who
had a team-high 17 stolen bases
last year.
Like Cal, USC has a strong
pitching staff with three return
ing starters included. Anchoring
the staff is Randy Powers, who
led the Trojans with 11 wins last
year. Darrin Beer, a starter who
led the team in innings pitched
last season, may move to the bull
pen.
Last Season: 13-17 (4th)
This Season: 14-16 (sth)
UCLA Bruins
UCLA has traditionally relied
on power to win games. In the
past three season, the Bruins have
hit 101, 116, and 85 home runs.
But without Eric Karros, who hit
17 homers last year, UCLA will
rely on speed, defense and pitch
ing.
Left fielder Robbie Katzaroff
will lead the Bruins' offensively.
He hit .329 and led the nation
with 10 triples last season.
Last Season: 12-18 (sth)
Predicted Finish 9-21 (6th)

will be in the lineup at first base.
In the outfield, Damon Buford, a
freshman All-America last year
with five homers and 29 RBI,
returns with John Jackson, who
had a team-high 17 stolen bases
last year.
Like Cal, USC has a strong
pitching staff with three return
ing starters included. Anchoring
the staff is Randy Powers, who
led the Trojans with 11 wins last
year. Darrin Beer, a starter who
led the team in innings pitched
last season, may move to the bull
pen.

UCLA Bruins
UCLA has traditionally relied
on power to win games. In the
past three season, the Bruins have
hit 101, 116, and 85 home runs.
But without Eric Karros, who hit
17 homers last year, UCLA will
rely on speed, defense and pitch
ing.
Left fielder Robbie Katzaroff
will lead the Bruins' offensively.
He hit .329 and led the nation
with 10 triples last season.
Last Season: 12-18 (sth)
Predicted Finish 9-21 (6th)
When asked what all Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division winners had
in common, Stanford Coach Mark Mar
quess responded: "Pitching, defense and
power — and there's not a lot of power
this year."
Stanford was not the only team in
the Six-Pac to lose many of its power
hitters from last season. Defending con
ference champion Arizona State lost 300
RBI off a team that produced 590 RBI
last season, including its leading home
run hitter, Tim Spehr.
There are more freshmen playing
starting roles in the Six-Pac this year
than ever before, and they will have to
fill in the offensive gaps left by gradu
ation and last year's Major League draft.
With one notable exception, the
youngsters will determine the fate of
the Six-Pac this season:
Arizona Wildcats
The Wildcats are the exception to the
freshman rule. Their entire starting
lineup returns from last season except
for right fielder Dave Shermet and All
Six-Pac pitcher Frank Halcovich.
"They have more veterans returning
than everybody, and in this league, ex
perience really helps,'' Marquess noted.
Arizona will be counting heavily on
the services of catcher Alan Zinter, a
preseason All-America by Baseball
America magazine. Zinter hit .339 last
season and had 55 RBI. Also returning
is All Six-Pac center fielder Kevin Long,
who was tied with Shermet for the team
lead in home runs last year with 10.
If there is a question mark for the
'Cats it is pitching. Two veterans
return: lefties Lance Dickson and Jim

Richardson, who were both starters last
year. But the person whom Coach Jerry
Kindall is most counting on to fill the
gap left by Halcovich is junior college
transfer Scott Erickson, who has already
compiled a 6-1 record thus far.

California Golden Bears
Cal's best asset is its pitching, and
the Bears' offense has a good mixture
of veterans and freshmen, all of whom
can steal bases. The combination should
result in a squad that will inhabit the
upper echelons of the Six-Pac.
Senior Mike Matthews and juniors
Mark Juhas and Travis Willis form a
three-man starting rotation that will

keep the opposition under three runs
in just about every game. Willis was
the team leader in innings pitched last
season and has only improved with age.
Joe Buckley, Cal's ace reliever with five
saves and a 2.92 ERA last season, also
returns.
Offensively, Todd Mayo will be the
leadoff batter again this year. If he gets
on base, he's dangerous, as is the second
batter in the lineup Daryl Vice, who
currently leads the team in stolen bases.
Freshmen Mike Harrison and Dan
Cholowsky will both start, and give Cal
an added dimension of power.

April Pearson — Daily
Second Baseman Frank Carey takes a cut. Carey and the Stanford baseball team
should finish second in the tough Sixpac conference.
Brock's teams in the second divi
sion of the Six-Pac, but of all the
coaches in the league, Brock lost
the most to graduation and the
draft.
Offensively, they lost a lot of
production in the persons of Mar
tin Peralta, Ricky Candelari, and
Tim Spehr. However, the team
has two returning Ail-Americans,
first baseman Dan Rumsey and
second baseman Kevin Higgins.
Brock will also depend heavily on
the bat of Steve Willis, the Devils
second-leading hitter last season.
Where the Devils are really hur
ting is in the pitching department.
Gone are their best starter, Linty
Ingram, and their best reliever
Bias Minor. Rusty Kilgo had a
fine season last year and will have
to carry the pitching staff. Fresh
men Kip Vaughn and Sean Rees
will have to contribute.
With at least three and maybe
five starting positions going to
freshmen, the Devils are a young
team. They still have an explosive
offensive and it will be up to the
young pitching staff to hold Six-
Pac opponents down until the hit
ting can finish them off.
Last Season: 21-9
Predicted Finish: 16-14 (4th)
USC Trojans
If All-American third baseman
Rodney Peete had not decided to
forgo baseball in favor of his foot
ball career, the Trojans would be
a lot scarier. As it is, they're still
not patsies.
Coach Mike Gillespie will miss

Peete's .338 average and 46 RBI,
but even more, he'll miss the serv
ices of Jim Campanis (yes that's
Al's grandson), who knocked in a
league-leading 92 RBI and
crushed 23 home runs, also a
league high.
But the Trojan infield is strong
without Peete. Second Baseman
Bret Boone, a preseason Ail-
American, will anchor the corps.
He batted .328 with 53 RBI last
season. Murph Proctor's solid bat
will be in the lineup at first base.
In the outfield, Damon Buford, a
freshman All-America last year
with five homers and 29 RBI,
