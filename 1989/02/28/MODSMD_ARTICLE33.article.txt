## Six-Pac preview: Card nine second to Wildcats 
### Bruce Sarkisian Senior staff writer 
When asked what all Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division winners had
in common, Stanford Coach Mark Mar
quess responded: "Pitching, defense and
power — and there's not a lot of power
this year."
Stanford was not the only team in
the Six-Pac to lose many of its power
hitters from last season. Defending con
ference champion Arizona State lost 300
RBI off a team that produced 590 RBI
last season, including its leading home
run hitter, Tim Spehr.
There are more freshmen playing
starting roles in the Six-Pac this year
than ever before, and they will have to
fill in the offensive gaps left by gradu
ation and last year's Major League draft.
With one notable exception, the
youngsters will determine the fate of
the Six-Pac this season:
Arizona Wildcats
The Wildcats are the exception to the
freshman rule. Their entire starting
lineup returns from last season except
for right fielder Dave Shermet and All
Six-Pac pitcher Frank Halcovich.
"They have more veterans returning
than everybody, and in this league, ex
perience really helps,'' Marquess noted.
Arizona will be counting heavily on
the services of catcher Alan Zinter, a
preseason All-America by Baseball
America magazine. Zinter hit .339 last
season and had 55 RBI. Also returning
is All Six-Pac center fielder Kevin Long,
who was tied with Shermet for the team
lead in home runs last year with 10.
If there is a question mark for the
'Cats it is pitching. Two veterans
return: lefties Lance Dickson and Jim

Richardson, who were both starters last
year. But the person whom Coach Jerry
Kindall is most counting on to fill the
gap left by Halcovich is junior college
transfer Scott Erickson, who has already
compiled a 6-1 record thus far.
Last Season: 10-20 (6th)
Predicted Finish: 18-12 (Ist)
Stanford Cardinal
Last Season 18-12 (2nd)
Predicted Finish: 17-13 (T2nd)
California Golden Bears
Cal's best asset is its pitching, and
the Bears' offense has a good mixture
of veterans and freshmen, all of whom
can steal bases. The combination should
result in a squad that will inhabit the
upper echelons of the Six-Pac.
Senior Mike Matthews and juniors
Mark Juhas and Travis Willis form a
three-man starting rotation that will

keep the opposition under three runs
in just about every game. Willis was
the team leader in innings pitched last
season and has only improved with age.
Joe Buckley, Cal's ace reliever with five
saves and a 2.92 ERA last season, also
returns.
Offensively, Todd Mayo will be the
leadoff batter again this year. If he gets
on base, he's dangerous, as is the second
batter in the lineup Daryl Vice, who
currently leads the team in stolen bases.
Freshmen Mike Harrison and Dan
Cholowsky will both start, and give Cal
an added dimension of power.
Last Season: 16-14 (3rd)
Predicted Finish: 17-13 (T2nd)

April Pearson — Daily
Second Baseman Frank Carey takes a cut. Carey and the Stanford baseball team
should finish second in the tough Sixpac conference.
