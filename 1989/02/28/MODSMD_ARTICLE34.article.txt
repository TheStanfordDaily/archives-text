# USF at Stanford
## 
### 
TODAY - 2 p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
RECORDS - Stanford (9-10, 1-2 in Six-Pac play), USF (2-7).
PROBABLE STARTERS — Stanford: Coach Mark Marquess will go with the standard
midweek pitching, which means that Aaron Dorlarque, Steve Worrell, Brian Keyser,
and Rob Kamerschen will see action. USF: Mark Pecha (0-2, 9.00 ERA).
SERIES — Stanford won the only meeting between the two teams last year, 17-6.
Kamerschen got the win in that game.
WHO'S HOT — Center fielder Steve Solomon had a good weekend, clubbing the
game-winning home run Friday against California. Mike Eicher went 2-for-3 Sunday
and probably earned himself a starting spot today.
WHO'S NOT — Paul Carey was 0-for-12 against Cal and saw his batting average fall
to .301. The Cardinal won't win too many games in which he wears the collar.
DONS UPDATE — Outfielder Arnie Sambel leads USF's offense. He is batting .371 with
11 RBI and three home runs so far this season.
KEYS TO VICTORY — This is one of those mid-week, non-league games that the Cardinal
should win and win big. The hitters must get to Pecha early — in his two losses, he
has lasted 4% and 1 innings. This is a good time for the Cardinal bats to break
out and for a bevy of Stanford pitchers to get in some good work.
