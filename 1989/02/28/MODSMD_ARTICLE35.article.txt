# 'Crunch time' for Elliott Gorn, American sportsman
## 
### 
And in a short while, crunch time
begins.
Postseason action for many of
Stanford's athletic teams is imminent
after completing successful regular sea
sons. But because this is an institution
that prides itself on academics as much
as athletics (more or less), it's also time
to take a look at crunch time in the
classroom — the approach of Dead and
Finals weeks.
Elliott Gorn knows all about crunch
time. He's been there before. Having
spent time at such noted programs as
Alabama and Miami (Not in Fla.), he has
perrenially faced the task of molding a
hapless squad of dull-witted, unen
thusiastic students into a well-oiled ma
chine of dull-witted, unenthusiastic stu
dents.
But this is Gorn's first year at Stan
ford, where he has a different dilemma
on his shoulders. Sure, he's got the same

kind of dull-witted, unenthusiastic and
in many cases, maladjusted, group of stu
dents. There's more, though.
Ever since the kids he is now coaching
entered the Farm, they have been slapped
with the label of "potential." That label
is easy to live up to. All one has to do
is not accomplish anything, and then one
still has the potential to do something.
But God forbid the students in Gorn's
class should ever accomplish something

worthwhile.
Yes, it's crunch time for Elliott Gorn.
He has to get 20 lazy kids to produce 20
sizzling term papers.
Perhaps Gorn may repeat the two in
spirational aphorisms he spoke upon first
taking charge of these students at the
beginning of this quarter.
"I think I like country music so much
because my life's been in the dumper for
so long," he said.
Or, in other words, "I'm easy."
Gorn, main man in American Studies
at Miami of Ohio (the Miami which, he
proudly proclaims, came before the rebel
Miami of Florida), is at Stanford as a
visiting professor this year, and is teach
ing a seminar this quarter entitled "Sport
in American Life."
There are mostly American Studies
majors in this class, mainly because
American Studies majors tend to
gravitate toward classes which sound

about as strenuous and taxing as playing
shuffleboard on the Lido deck of the Love
Boat. Classes like "The American
Dream," or "Material Culture," or "The
Peanut-Butter Sandwich in American So
ciety, 1950-1960."
But Gorn takes American Studies, and
particularly the study of sport in the
U.S., quite seriously. He has already pub
lished a book called, "The Manly Art," a
look at the history of bare-knuckle boxing
in America and what that reveals about
society. Another article carries the title,
"Gouge and Bite, Pull Hair and Scratch."
Pretty heady stuff for a medium
height, curly-haired, bespectacled guy
originally from the San Fernando Valley.
Reading his works, as well as several
additional articles including "Puritans
and Sport," "Sports That Kill" and "Are
Athletics Making Girls Masculine?" indi
cates quickly that sport can't be
downplayed as a barometer of beliefs and

trends in American society.
It also gives one an excuse to debate
the philosophical ramifications of the
Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue for 45
minutes.
But if there's one thing that Gorn pro
vides in the study of "Sport in American
Life," it's perspective.
How else could he suddenly say things
like, "What do you say we give up all
this sports stuff and go find Elvis?" Or,
"Cameron, say something to get your
mind off your face."
Suffice it to say, he's blunt. He's sar
castic. He's a wild-and-crazy guy. He's
Elliott Gorn. The fans are going wild.
And, as crunch time approaches, he
knows precisely why I've taken the time
and space to point out what a great Amer
ican sportsman he is.

additional articles including "Puritans
and Sport," "Sports That Kill" and "Are
Athletics Making Girls Masculine?" indi
cates quickly that sport can't be
downplayed as a barometer of beliefs and

trends in American society.
It also gives one an excuse to debate
the philosophical ramifications of the
Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue for 45
minutes.
But if there's one thing that Gorn pro
vides in the study of "Sport in American
Life," it's perspective.
How else could he suddenly say things
like, "What do you say we give up all
this sports stuff and go find Elvis?" Or,
"Cameron, say something to get your
mind off your face."
Suffice it to say, he's blunt. He's sar
castic. He's a wild-and-crazy guy. He's
Elliott Gorn. The fans are going wild.
And, as crunch time approaches, he
knows precisely why I've taken the time
and space to point out what a great Amer
ican sportsman he is.
