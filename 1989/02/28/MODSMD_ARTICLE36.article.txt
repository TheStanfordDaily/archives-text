# Sailors lead North Series after fourth regatta
## 
### Hugh Bethell Staff writer 
With first place finishes at the third and
fourth regattas of the North Series, the Stan
ford sailing team moved into the top spot in
the regular season standings this weekend dur
ing two days of racing on the waters of Red
wood City.
On the way to its victories, the Cardinal
squad defeated a fleet of 22 boats from 10
schools that came from as far away as Southern
California. As a result of the two wins, Stan
ford now leads the North Series with six points,
a point ahead of California and five points
ahead of Santa Cruz.
Stanford built its lead during two separate
events held over the weekend. The third
regatta of the North Series, held on Saturday,
involved team racing between squads of three
boats from each school.
On Sunday, though, the racing returned to
a more usual format, with each school entering
one scoring boat and sometimes several others
into a Jleet that all raced together.
Stanford's team racing squad, which went
undefeated through nine races to win the
event, was made up of three pairs: seniors Ev
Rend and Amy Baltzer, junior Robert Brown
and sophomore Heidi Park, and sophomore
Dave Dowd and freshman Lydia Snape.
The six Stanford sailors crowned their per
fect performance with a convincing win over
Cal in the final race of the day.
On Sunday, the Cardinal scoring boat was
sailed by Rend and Baltzer in the A Division
and Dowd and Snape in the B Division.
The foursome sailed consistently enough to
win top honors in the overall standings, just
ahead of another Stanford boat sailed by soph
omores Scott Dale and Sue Kown in A Division
and sophomores Rick Rosen and Rebecca
Bryson in B Division. UC-Irvine finished in
third, Cal took fourth place, and Santa Cruz
was fifth.
Also turning in strong performances for the
Cardinal were Brown and Park, who sailed in
A Division opposite junior Kim Grose and
sophomore Matt Dunbar. Grose and Dunbar
showed their speed by scoring a decisive win
in the day's first B Division race, and following
it with a series of solid finishes.
"We're sailing very strongly right now, and
I think we have a good chance of not only
qualifying for nationals, but of doing well there
once we arrive," Coach Blake Middleton said.
