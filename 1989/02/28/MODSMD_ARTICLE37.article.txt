# No. 13 in the land
## Pac-10 honors Wright, Lichti among elite 
### 
Good news came in threes yes
terday for the Stanford men's bas
ketball team.
No, not 3-point baskets, but
three separate honors for the
squad and two of its key members.
First, in the latest Associated
Press Top 20, the Cardinal moved
up three notches (there's that
three again) to 13th in the land.
In so doing, the team seems to
be well positioned for a top-four
seed in one of the regions in the
NCAA Tournament.
That means in all likelihood
Stanford will travel out of the
West because the selection com
mittee tries to prevent conference
rivals among the top 16 from
meeting before the Final Four.
The Arizona Wildcats, who
recaptured the No. 1 ranking from
Oklahoma in the poll, will almost
certainly be the top seed in the
West and Stanford will travel.
The second piece of good news
is that a Stanford player was
named Pacific 10 Conference
Player of the Week for the fourth
time this year.
However, for the first time it
was not Todd Lichti. Instead, the
honor was bestowed upon 6-foot-8
forward Howard Wright.
In three games last week,
Wright shot 76 percent from the
field making 19-of-25 field-goal
attempts. He also made 13-of-14
free throws for a 93 percent tally.
Overall, Wright scored 58 points
and grabbed 19 boards. He also
dished out six assists, swatted six
shots and made three steals.
Against USC last Monday,
Wright scored 18 points in power
ing the Cardinal to a 68-52 vic
tory. In that contest, he blocked
a career-high four shots.
Thursday, in Duck country,
Wright scored 19 of Stanford's 54
points as the Cardinal snuck by
Oregon.
In the week's big game, versus
Oregon State Saturday, Wright
shot an unbelievable 10-of-13
from the field and grabbed a

season-high 10 rebounds. Along
with the 20 points, those rebounds
gave Wright a double-double.
The third honor belongs to
Lichti. The 6-4 guard is among
10 finalists for the AP's Player
of the Year award. Lichti is
averaging 20.3 points and 4.8
rebounds per game on the season.
He is also shooting 58 percent
from the field and 88 percent from
the free-throw line.
He is currently third all-time in
Pac-10 scoring behind Sean
"Cobra" Elliott, another Player
of-the-Year candidate, and
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (nee Lew
Alcindor).

was not Todd Lichti. Instead, the
honor was bestowed upon 6-foot-8
forward Howard Wright.
In three games last week,
Wright shot 76 percent from the
field making 19-of-25 field-goal
attempts. He also made 13-of-14
free throws for a 93 percent tally.
Overall, Wright scored 58 points
and grabbed 19 boards. He also
dished out six assists, swatted six
shots and made three steals.
Against USC last Monday,
Wright scored 18 points in power
ing the Cardinal to a 68-52 vic
tory. In that contest, he blocked
a career-high four shots.
Thursday, in Duck country,
Wright scored 19 of Stanford's 54
points as the Cardinal snuck by
Oregon.
In the week's big game, versus
Oregon State Saturday, Wright
shot an unbelievable 10-of-13
from the field and grabbed a

season-high 10 rebounds. Along
with the 20 points, those rebounds
gave Wright a double-double.
The third honor belongs to
Lichti. The 6-4 guard is among
10 finalists for the AP's Player
of the Year award. Lichti is
averaging 20.3 points and 4.8
rebounds per game on the season.
He is also shooting 58 percent
from the field and 88 percent from
the free-throw line.
He is currently third all-time in
Pac-10 scoring behind Sean
"Cobra" Elliott, another Player
of-the-Year candidate, and
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (nee Lew
Alcindor).

Good news came in threes yes
terday for the Stanford men's bas
ketball team.
No, not 3-point baskets, but
three separate honors for the
squad and two of its key members.
First, in the latest Associated
Press Top 20, the Cardinal moved
up three notches (there's that
three again) to 13th in the land.
In so doing, the team seems to
be well positioned for a top-four
seed in one of the regions in the
NCAA Tournament.
That means in all likelihood
Stanford will travel out of the
West because the selection com
mittee tries to prevent conference
rivals among the top 16 from
meeting before the Final Four.
The Arizona Wildcats, who
recaptured the No. 1 ranking from
Oklahoma in the poll, will almost
certainly be the top seed in the
West and Stanford will travel.
The second piece of good news
is that a Stanford player was
named Pacific 10 Conference
Player of the Week for the fourth
time this year.
However, for the first time it
was not Todd Lichti. Instead, the
honor was bestowed upon 6-foot-8
forward Howard Wright.
In three games last week,
Wright shot 76 percent from the
field making 19-of-25 field-goal
attempts. He also made 13-of-14
free throws for a 93 percent tally.
Overall, Wright scored 58 points
and grabbed 19 boards. He also
dished out six assists, swatted six
shots and made three steals.
Against USC last Monday,
Wright scored 18 points in power
ing the Cardinal to a 68-52 vic
tory. In that contest, he blocked
a career-high four shots.
Thursday, in Duck country,
Wright scored 19 of Stanford's 54
points as the Cardinal snuck by
Oregon.
In the week's big game, versus

shot an unbelievable 10-of-13
