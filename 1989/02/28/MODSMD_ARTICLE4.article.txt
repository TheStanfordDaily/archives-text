# Program now downplays status of Jordan Scholars
## 
### Sophia Shing Staff writer 
Looking for a Jordan Scholar
this year is like looking for a par
ticular stalk of hay in a haystack.
Only the scholars themselves
and the Office of Admissions staff
who chose them for their "super
star" high school records are cer
tain who the selected freshmen
are. And the University has given
them no further special treatment
since it sent notes of recognition
along with the acceptance letters
last year.
This is the first year of Stan
ford's revamped Jordan Scholar
Program, which is now solely a

means of recruiting and recogniz
ing top applicants. Last spring the
year-old program was changed,
eliminating special honors for the
matriculated scholars and withold
ing the students' names from the
public.
Last year, which was the first
year of the scholar program, many
students voiced concern that the
award compromised the idea of
equality at Stanford. Protesting
that all Stanford students should
begin their college career on equal
footing, some students regarded
the program as contrary to Stan
ford's attempt to make all incom
ing students feel equally qualified.
The reforms last year aimed to
address these concerns. Acccord
ing to Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Thomas Wasow, the pre
vious intentions for the program
were to recruit, recognize and
honor students for their achieve
ments. Now, the University has
eliminated the honor factor and
simply uses Jordan Scholar
recognition to recruit and recog
nize.
Wasow attributed last year's ob
jections to the honor factor and
added, "We don't want to set stu
dents up on a pedestal by work
they did elsewhere." He said the
program's "primary purpose is a
recruiting tool" to attract aca
demic "superstars."
Moreover, he said, "It is a mis
taken belief that financial awards
are given to Jordan Scholars." The
award is not a monetary scholar
ship but a recognition of excel
lence.
However, the scholars are given
personal invitations to attend Pro
spective Freshmen Week and the
University pays transportation
costs for those with financial
need, according to Wasow.
Although Wasow did not take
part in the initial design of the
program, he said he is committed
to carry out the original plans
that were promised to the first
recipients of the award. The class
of 1991 Jordan Scholars received
a letter in their acceptance packet
telling of exclusive activities for
the scholars.

This year's program no longer
includes such special treatment.
Lynne Madison, assistant dean
of Undergraduate Admissions, ex
plained the purpose of the award
as a recognition rather than a
privilege.
"We are committed to the prin
ciple that every student entering
the University should start off on
an equal footing; therefore, the
Jordan Scholar designation
carries with it no speciai privileges
after matriculation. It is simply
a recognition in promise of future
intellectual accomplishment."
As a result of the first attempt
at the program, some Jordan
Scholars have been left confused
about their status. Sophomore
Jordan Scholar John Nagel said,
"I really don't know what it
means to be a Jordan Scholar."
Sophomore Margaret Wu, also
a scholar, said she was somewhat
"disappointed" in the program.
According to Wu, the scholars
should not be made to feel un
comfortable about the program.
"I wish the program was more
open, so that we would at least
know each other," she said.
Moreover, she said, "I don't
think people come in on an equal
footing. It may be unfortunate,
but it's true that some people
have had more opportunities than
others." She clarified that it
should not be a program about
privileges but about recognizing
academic excellence.
In contrast, Mary Beth McNitt
said, "Everyone here is on an
equal footing and should be." She
described the program as "just a
kind of recognition. It doesn't
really affect life at Stanford."

According to McNitt, the con
troversy arose because the pro
gram was not well defined. Even
without special privileges, she said
it is just nice that "someone has
recognized us."
Nagel said he could understand
the reaction caused by the pro
gram from other students, but he
said the issue became a little "hy
persensitive." As far as the
recognition, Nagel says"It was a
nice thing to get, but it certainly
wasn't a deciding factor" in his
decision to attend Stanford.
Regarding the special programs
which have been organized, soph
omore Matt Ver Halen said, "Once
I got here, going to those things
wasn't a high priority for me."
He said many of the Jordan Schol
ars do not participate in the pro
gram's activities.
"There's no point in having pro
grams that nobody wants to go
to," Ver Halen said.
Though he said he does not feel

the special activities are benefi
cial, Ver Halen agrees that the
program is generally a good idea.
"It probably did not contribute to
my coming here, but it made me
a little more confident that I
would have a pretty good chance
of doing well."
Ver Halen added, "The main
value of the program is to encour
age the individual students into
coming and not to puff their
names up to the public."
