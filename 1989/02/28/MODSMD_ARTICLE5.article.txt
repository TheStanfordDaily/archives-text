# Committee forms to protect free speech
## 
### Rob Burwell Staff writer 
Fearing that a soon-to-be
released interpretation of the
Fundamental Standard might
restrict free speech, a group of
Stanford students recently formed
the Committee for First Amend
ment Rights to oppose content
based regulation of speech.
The group was formed in an
ticipation of the Student Conduct
Legislative Council's expected rec
ommendations for clarification of
the Fundamental Standard, due
out tomorrow. The council has
the final say for any changes and
interpretation in the Standard's
wording.
Junior Ric Simmons, one of the
new group's founders, said the
goal of the committee is to get
the free speech debate out in the
open. "We believe there is a large
proportion of students who agree
with us whose opinion is not being
heard," he said.

Following a Sunday organiza
tional meeting attended by 12 un
dergraduates, faculty and staff,
Simmons said he was "confident
that the committee had a good
core group. Five or six other stu
dents have also expressed interest
in joining the committee, he said.
Although the new group has yet
to see the council's report, group
members spoke to people who
have viewed it.
According to Simmons, a
probable clause in the council's
recommendations stipulates that
students who verbally attack
groups should be punished. This
new clause is of special concern
to the new group.
Differentiating between verbal
attacks directed at individuals and
attacks against groups, Simmons
said individuals are legitimately
protected by laws against harass
ment. He said he fears the coun
cil's report allegedly advocates
punishment of students who at
tack specific groups in violation

of "accepted community stand
ards."
Simmons said such restrictions
infringe on First Amendment
rights and the Supreme Court's
interpretation of it, and thus con
stitute "a threat to open discus
sion and education."
Simmons added that members
of the new group are "not (First
Amendment) absolutists" and rec
ognize that some cases, such as
"fighting words," are not
protected by the First Amend
ment.
"We support First Amendment
rights at least as they are enforced
in the rest of the country," Sim
mons said. "We would like to
change or amend [the council's
recommendations] so that free
speech questions would have to
be interpreted according to First
Amendment principles."
Simmons stressed the commit
tee's desire to "get something
cointr. to build an infrastructure

to be ready as soon as the report
came out."
He said he expected an influx
of new members following the
council's release of their state
ment tomorrow. The new group
will hold a meeting tomorrow, and
it plans to start circulating a pe
tition around campus.
"We want to bring the issue to
the students. We don't intend to
let this pass by default," Simmons
said.
Simmons said the committee
hopes to have the council proposal
amended, not shelved as a whole.
He added that members agree
that clarification of the Funda
mental Standard is necessary.
The First Amendment Commit
tee hopes to talk to and work with
the ASSU's Committee on Democ
racy in Education, but according
to Simmons, there will probably
not be an agreement between the
two committees because they have
such different goals.
