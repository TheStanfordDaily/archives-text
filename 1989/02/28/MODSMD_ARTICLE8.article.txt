# In search of support and solidarity
## Graca Machel continues struggle for sovereignty in Mozambique 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
The memory of her late hus
band has stirred Graca Machel to
continue the struggle for
sovereignty in the war-torn and
impoverished country of Mozam
bique.
Machel is Mozambique's cur
rent Minister of Education and
the widow of the African nation's
first president, Samora Machel,
who died in a plane crash two
and-a-half years ago.
During a visit to Stanford last
Friday night, Machel spoke to stu
dents at CERAS as part of a
nation-wide tour to alert Ameri
cans to the horrors which are
taking place in her country.
Although Mozambique gained
independence from Portugal in
1975, a brutal civil war has raged
across the countryside for nearly
13 years, claiming an estimated
100,000 lives.
Mozambique's embattled Marx
ist government, led for a decade
by Machel's husband, has been
destabilized by the guerrilla forces
of the Mozambique National
Resistance.
The guerrilla army, better
known by its Portuguese
acronym, Renamo, has won world

wide notoriety for acts of terror
ism. Renamo is infamous for its
massacres, its practice of lopping
off ears and noses as punishment
and its mass kidnappings and sys
tematic forced labor.
In a Friday interview with The
Daily, Machel said she hoped "to
make some friends" while in the
United States and to find "people
who understand, who will give us
solidarity"
Until 1983, the United States
regarded the Marxist government

of Mozambique as a Soviet client
and consequently gave little aid
to its liberation efforts.
The United States has since in
creased its efforts to cooperate,
Machel said, but much more could
be done by way of increased eco
nomic aid.
Machel's hope is that those in
the United States who hear her
message will share it with others
and then put pressure on the U.S.
government "to do much more
than it's doing" to aid the Mozam
bique government in its struggle
and to destroy South Africa's
apartheid regime.
Since the inception of Mozam
bique's civil war, the neighboring
South African government has
supplied Renamo with substantial
covert aid, including airdrops of
supplies, training and other
logistical support.
Western journalists have re
ported that, since the summer,
South Africa's aid to Renamo has
virtually evaporated, but Machel
indicated on Friday that the white
minority government is still very
much a destabilizing force in the
region in general and in Mozam
bique in particular.
