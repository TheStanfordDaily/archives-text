# In search of support and solidarity
## Graca Machel continues struggle for sovereignty in Mozambique 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
The memory of her late hus
band has stirred Graca Machel to
continue the struggle for
sovereignty in the war-torn and
impoverished country of Mozam
bique.
Machel is Mozambique's cur
rent Minister of Education and
the widow of the African nation's
first president, Samora Machel,
who died in a plane crash two
and-a-half years ago.
During a visit to Stanford last
Friday night, Machel spoke to stu
dents at CERAS as part of a
nation-wide tour to alert Ameri
cans to the horrors which are
taking place in her country.
Although Mozambique gained
independence from Portugal in
1975, a brutal civil war has raged
across the countryside for nearly
13 years, claiming an estimated
100,000 lives.
Mozambique's embattled Marx
ist government, led for a decade
by Machel's husband, has been
destabilized by the guerrilla forces
of the Mozambique National
Resistance.
The guerrilla army, better
known by its Portuguese
acronym, Renamo, has won world

wide notoriety for acts of terror
ism. Renamo is infamous for its
massacres, its practice of lopping
off ears and noses as punishment
and its mass kidnappings and sys
tematic forced labor.
In a Friday interview with The
Daily, Machel said she hoped "to
make some friends" while in the
United States and to find "people
who understand, who will give us
solidarity"
Until 1983, the United States
regarded the Marxist government

of Mozambique as a Soviet client
and consequently gave little aid
to its liberation efforts.
The United States has since in
creased its efforts to cooperate,
Machel said, but much more could
be done by way of increased eco
nomic aid.
Machel's hope is that those in
the United States who hear her
message will share it with others
and then put pressure on the U.S.
government "to do much more
than it's doing" to aid the Mozam
bique government in its struggle
and to destroy South Africa's
apartheid regime.
Since the inception of Mozam
bique's civil war, the neighboring
South African government has
supplied Renamo with substantial
covert aid, including airdrops of
supplies, training and other
logistical support.
Western journalists have re
ported that, since the summer,
South Africa's aid to Renamo has
virtually evaporated, but Machel
indicated on Friday that the white
minority government is still very
much a destabilizing force in the
region in general and in Mozam
bique in particular.
Mozambique was the first na-


Graca Machel
tion in the region to gain independence from its
imperialist power and establish a non-racial society,
Machel said.
"This was something South Africa could not
stand," she explained.
According to Machel, South Africa's support of
Renamo in the bloody civil war has been an attempt
to destabilize the new Mozambiquan government
and consequently "discourage other countries from
following the example of Mozambique."
The apartheid regime in South Africa "is the
cause of all problems" in the region, Machel asserted.
In addition to the anguish of the military struggle
that has devastated her nation, Machel has been
tormented by the loss of her husband. In October,
1986, Samora Machel was killed in a suspicious
airplane crash in a mountainous area on the
Mozambican-South African border.
South African officials blamed the crash on pilot
error, but Mozambiquan officials have claimed the
principle cause of the crash was a false radio beacon
which diverted the plane from its normal flight
path into the mountainous area.
During her appearance on Friday, Machel spoke
with a charismatic presence remarkable for a woman
who had endured so much pain and tragedy. Upon
addressing the circumstances surrounding her hus
band's death, however, some of the anguish buried
inside her surfaced.
"I find [my husband's death] very difficult to
talk about," she said. "It's a very sensitive problem."
According to Machel, the South African govern
ment has not been cooperative in investigating the
possibility of foul play. She said her government
had "some information" regarding her husband's
death, but that earlier allegations had been "very
difficult to prove."
Machel has not allowed her pain to dampen her
commitment to Mozambique's future.
"I have my own personal commitment to the
struggle, and I don't think whatever happens to
my life, I should just give up because I have a
personal problem," she said.
Indeed, she said she feels compelled to do all she
can to fulfill her husband's legacy.
"Because of the loss I have suffered from my
husband, I feel that the only thing I can do in his
memory, in his respect, is to try to continue what
he was doing and what he was aiming at," Machel
said.
"Of course, I'm not able to do all that he was
doing, but in my position, in my own capacity, at
least I should do what I'm sure he would expect of
me.
In her role as Minister of Education, Machel
helped to reduce the illiteracy rate in Mozambique
from the 93 percent left by the Portuguese to 72
percent five years after gaining independence.
The civil war has taken its toll on Machel's efforts,
though. Since the war began, Renamo has destroyed
45 percent of the schools in Mozambique.
Destruction of schools is just one tactic being
used by Renamo in what Machel terms "social des
tabilization." According to Machel, Renamo, backed
by South Africa, has transferred their attempts at

political and economic destabilization to "a level
which is much more sensitive — attacking human
beings, their personalities and cultural values."
Machel said that Renamo often kidnaps young
Mozambiquan schoolchildren. The enemy, she said,
then trains the children to be assassins and bandits
who will later return to destroy their own villages.
"They kill their relatives and people they know
in the villages," Machel said. "They are being in
strumentalized by South Africans."
Another tactic of social destabilization used by
Renamo is the destruction of families, Machel said.
Children often witness the massacre of their parents,
she said, and are left orphaned.
The absence of family leaves the children im
poverished and without cultural identity, she ex
plained.
"When we have peace in the country, we can
rebuild," Machel said. "Factories can be rebuilt.
Roads can be rebuilt. Houses can be rebuilt. But
how are we going to rebuild personalities and rebuild
moral and cultural identities of children?"
Social destabilization has been "very painful,"
Machel explained. "We would like to give our
children our heritage — at least our children [should
be] happy and develop their capacities, their poten
tialities and their faculties."
The Mozambique government has had some suc
cess in rehabilitating some of the kidnapped
children, Machel said. The goal of rehabilitation,
she said, is to "teach children how to be children"
and "make them believe it's possible to grow and
live a normal life."
The biggest challenge in educating children in
Mozambique, Machel said, is giving them a sense
of individual and national pride.
"It's important to make people children feel that
we as a sovereign nation, as a sovereign people,
have the right to be ourselves and be able to decide
what we want to do," Machel said. "It is our right.
Independence means we at least have the right to
express, to decide and to act."

solidarity"
Until 1983, the United States
regarded the Marxist government

of Mozambique as a Soviet client
and consequently gave little aid
to its liberation efforts.
The United States has since in
creased its efforts to cooperate,
Machel said, but much more could
be done by way of increased eco
nomic aid.
Machel's hope is that those in
the United States who hear her
message will share it with others
and then put pressure on the U.S.
government "to do much more
than it's doing" to aid the Mozam
bique government in its struggle
and to destroy South Africa's
apartheid regime.
Since the inception of Mozam
bique's civil war, the neighboring
South African government has
supplied Renamo with substantial
covert aid, including airdrops of
supplies, training and other
logistical support.
Western journalists have re
ported that, since the summer,
South Africa's aid to Renamo has
virtually evaporated, but Machel
indicated on Friday that the white
minority government is still very
much a destabilizing force in the
region in general and in Mozam
bique in particular.
Mozambique was the first na-


Graca Machel
tion in the region to gain independence from its
imperialist power and establish a non-racial society,
Machel said.
"This was something South Africa could not
stand," she explained.
According to Machel, South Africa's support of
Renamo in the bloody civil war has been an attempt
to destabilize the new Mozambiquan government
and consequently "discourage other countries from
following the example of Mozambique."
The apartheid regime in South Africa "is the
cause of all problems" in the region, Machel asserted.
In addition to the anguish of the military struggle
that has devastated her nation, Machel has been
tormented by the loss of her husband. In October,
1986, Samora Machel was killed in a suspicious
airplane crash in a mountainous area on the
Mozambican-South African border.
South African officials blamed the crash on pilot
error, but Mozambiquan officials have claimed the
principle cause of the crash was a false radio beacon
which diverted the plane from its normal flight
path into the mountainous area.
During her appearance on Friday, Machel spoke
with a charismatic presence remarkable for a woman
who had endured so much pain and tragedy. Upon
addressing the circumstances surrounding her hus
band's death, however, some of the anguish buried
inside her surfaced.
"I find [my husband's death] very difficult to
talk about," she said. "It's a very sensitive problem."
According to Machel, the South African govern
ment has not been cooperative in investigating the
possibility of foul play. She said her government
had "some information" regarding her husband's
death, but that earlier allegations had been "very
difficult to prove."
Machel has not allowed her pain to dampen her
commitment to Mozambique's future.
"I have my own personal commitment to the
struggle, and I don't think whatever happens to
my life, I should just give up because I have a
personal problem," she said.
Indeed, she said she feels compelled to do all she
can to fulfill her husband's legacy.
"Because of the loss I have suffered from my
husband, I feel that the only thing I can do in his
memory, in his respect, is to try to continue what
he was doing and what he was aiming at," Machel
said.
"Of course, I'm not able to do all that he was
doing, but in my position, in my own capacity, at
least I should do what I'm sure he would expect of
me.
In her role as Minister of Education, Machel
helped to reduce the illiteracy rate in Mozambique
from the 93 percent left by the Portuguese to 72
percent five years after gaining independence.
The civil war has taken its toll on Machel's efforts,
though. Since the war began, Renamo has destroyed
45 percent of the schools in Mozambique.
Destruction of schools is just one tactic being
used by Renamo in what Machel terms "social des
tabilization." According to Machel, Renamo, backed
by South Africa, has transferred their attempts at

political and economic destabilization to "a level
which is much more sensitive — attacking human
beings, their personalities and cultural values."
Machel said that Renamo often kidnaps young
Mozambiquan schoolchildren. The enemy, she said,
then trains the children to be assassins and bandits
who will later return to destroy their own villages.
"They kill their relatives and people they know
in the villages," Machel said. "They are being in
strumentalized by South Africans."
Another tactic of social destabilization used by
Renamo is the destruction of families, Machel said.
Children often witness the massacre of their parents,
she said, and are left orphaned.
The absence of family leaves the children im
poverished and without cultural identity, she ex
plained.
"When we have peace in the country, we can
rebuild," Machel said. "Factories can be rebuilt.
Roads can be rebuilt. Houses can be rebuilt. But
how are we going to rebuild personalities and rebuild
moral and cultural identities of children?"
Social destabilization has been "very painful,"
Machel explained. "We would like to give our
children our heritage — at least our children [should
be] happy and develop their capacities, their poten
tialities and their faculties."
The Mozambique government has had some suc
cess in rehabilitating some of the kidnapped
children, Machel said. The goal of rehabilitation,
she said, is to "teach children how to be children"
and "make them believe it's possible to grow and
live a normal life."
The biggest challenge in educating children in
Mozambique, Machel said, is giving them a sense
of individual and national pride.
"It's important to make people children feel that
we as a sovereign nation, as a sovereign people,
have the right to be ourselves and be able to decide
what we want to do," Machel said. "It is our right.
Independence means we at least have the right to
express, to decide and to act."

Mozambique, shown In gray, has been en
veloped by a brutal civil war for almost 13
years.
The memory of her late hus
band has stirred Graca Machel to
continue the struggle for
sovereignty in the war-torn and
impoverished country of Mozam
bique.
Machel is Mozambique's cur
rent Minister of Education and
the widow of the African nation's
first president, Samora Machel,
who died in a plane crash two
and-a-half years ago.
During a visit to Stanford last
Friday night, Machel spoke to stu
dents at CERAS as part of a
nation-wide tour to alert Ameri
cans to the horrors which are
taking place in her country.
Although Mozambique gained
independence from Portugal in
1975, a brutal civil war has raged
across the countryside for nearly
13 years, claiming an estimated
100,000 lives.
Mozambique's embattled Marx
ist government, led for a decade
by Machel's husband, has been
destabilized by the guerrilla forces
of the Mozambique National
Resistance.
The guerrilla army, better
known by its Portuguese
acronym, Renamo, has won world

wide notoriety for acts of terror
ism. Renamo is infamous for its
massacres, its practice of lopping
off ears and noses as punishment
and its mass kidnappings and sys
tematic forced labor.
