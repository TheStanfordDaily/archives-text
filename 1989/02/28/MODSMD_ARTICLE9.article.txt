Wrong ruling against Rushdie?
The punishment for someone who writes
a blasphemous book should not be death
but excommunication, the chief Sephardic
rabbi of Israel said here last Friday.
Mordechai Eliahu, in a talk sponsored by
Stanford's B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation,
said the chief rabbinate has the power to
excommunicate a Jew who blasphemes a
religion.
Responding to a question about the cur
rent controversy over Salman Rushdie's book
"The Satanic Verses," which many Moslems
believe commits blasphemy against their re
ligion, Eliahu, whose authority is somewhat
comparable to that of an ayatollah in Mos
lem countries, said that "The punishment
in Judaism is equal to the crime."
"We don't kill a person who speaks heresy.
If a person speaks against [God], the chief
rabbinate can excommunicate him. If the
person owns a store, a person who listens
to the chief rabbinate won't go and make
a purchase from him."
"The chief rabbinate obviously won't en
courage and won't condone people who speak

or write uncomplimentary books about re
ligions," he said, pointing to the close con
nections between Judaism and Islam.
The most famous Jew to be excommun
icated was probably the philosopher Baruch
Spinoza, who was excommunicated by Dutch
rabbis in the 17th century for proclaiming
that God is nature, not a supernatural being.
Eliahu spoke to an audience of about 70
in the Political Science building.

Palo Alto hits 100, in a way
One hundred years ago yesterday, the
seeds of what would become the city of Palo
Alto were planted on the Peninsula.
On Feb. 27, 1889, Stanford University
Trustee Timothy Hopkins filed with the
county recorder a map for a residential com
munity called University Park. The prop
erty, purchased for Leland Stanford Sr.,
would serve as the college town for the new
university already under construction.
Three years later, the town's name would
be changed to Palo Alto.
Although Palo Alto's primary centennial
celebration will not be until 1994 — the
anniversary of the date of incorporation —
the Palo Alto City Council did not let yes
terday's historic significance pass unnoticed.
At the time Hopkins filed the map for
University Park, the area consisted of just
three houses and acres and acres of open
fields, oak trees and farm land.
