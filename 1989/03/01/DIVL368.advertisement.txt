PROPOSED INTERPRETATIONS AND APPLICATIONS
OF THE FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD
The Student Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC) authors and amends both academic and non-academic codes of
conduct that relate to students. The 1989-89 SCLC is initiating the legislative process, as prescribed by the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968, by releasing to the University community the proposed new text that
appears below.
Your comments, which are warmly encouraged, should be directed in writing to Professor George Parker,
School of Business. The deadline for responding is March 22, 1989.
SCLC members are:
FACULTY George Parker (Chair), Tom Kane, Mark Mancall, John Perry, Alan Schwettman, Edward Solomon
STUDENTS Sam Kim, Eric Li, Janie Yen
EX-OFFICIO Canetta Ivy, David Porter, Sally Cole
The Fundamental Standard reads:
Students at Stanford are expected to show both within and without the University such
respect for order, morality, personal honor and the rights of others as is demanded of good
citizens. Failure to do this will be sufficient cause for removal from the University.
The SCLC proposes to leave this statement unchanged and to follow it with this text:
Interpretations and Applications of the Fundamental Standard in the Area of Diversity.
1. Stanford is committed to diversity both of ideas and persons. The members of the Stanford community are
bound together by the desire to participate in the interplay of ideas in the pursuit of truth, and they differ
from each other in many other ways. In this statement, "personal and cultural diversity" refers to
differences in gender, race, color, sexual orientation, physical abilities, national or ethnic origin, and
religious affiliation, while "intellectual diversity" refers to differences in beliefs, including political beliefs.
2. Freedom of speech has long been cherished in our society, and nowhere does it have greater or more special
power than in a university, where unconventional and heterodox ideas are the very breath of life. Precisely
because Stanford values diversity and welcomes the many cultures that feed the University's intellectual
life, students must expect to find, and are expected to tolerate, opinions that they not only disagree with,
but may find abhorrent. No student at Stanford has a right to prevent another from holding a particular
opinion or from expressing it in ways appropriate to exploring, developing, vigorously promoting and
defending it, and thus entering it into the life of the University, there to flourish or wither according to its
merits.
3. In general, Stanford's commitment to the diversity of ideas and persons and to the principle of freedom of
speech reinforce one another. But they can come into conflict. All members of the University have a right to
be protected from exposure to conduct that is intended, or could reasonably be expected, to discourage
them from full participation in the University's life on the bases of personal, cultural, or intellectual
differences. In certain circumstances, some forms of expression can thus constitute violations of the
Fundamental Standard. The following statements are intended to clarify these circumstances.
4. PERSONAL ABUSE. Students and other members of the Stanford community have the right to be free from
personal attacks which involve the use of obscenites, epithets, and other forms of expression that by
accepted community standards degrade, victimize, stigmatize, or perjoratively characterize them on the
basis of personal, cultural, or intellectual diversity.
5. DEFAMATION OF GROUPS. Members of the Stanford community have the right not to be inescapably and
involuntarily exposed to obscenities, epithets, and other forms of expression that by accepted community
standards stigmatize, victimize, or perjoratively characterize persons or groups on the basis of personal or
cultural differences.
