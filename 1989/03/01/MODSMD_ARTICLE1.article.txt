# 27 students evacuated due to asbestos leak

### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
Twenty-five students were
evacuated from Paloma House
last night and two on Monday
night due to asbestos leakage
caused by University maintenance
work on the third floor corridor.
The asbestos leakage was a
direct result of fixing a ventilator
fan between a ceiling and the roof
in the all-freshman house in
Florence Moore Hall. The Univer
sity has notified students several
times in the past year and a half
about asbestos inspections and
possible problems. This is the lar
gest asbestos-related evacuation

of students from campus housing
in recent history.
The repairs began Jan. 25,
when workers drilled a hole in the
wall of room 318, which was oc
cupied by two freshmen. The re
pairs continued Feb. 2, when an
other hole was cut in the corridor
ceiling, connecting to the hole in
the room.
The asbestos was knocked loose
from the ceiling at that time,
meaning that students were pos
sibly exposed to the asbestos for
more than three weeks.
During an emergency dorm
meeting last night, Alain Decleve,
assistant director of Health and
Safety, emphasized that the as

bestos levels were not dangerous
and that prevention was the rea
son for evacuation.
Brian Meckler and Alex Lee, the
occupants of room 318, were
evacuated Monday night and
moved to a guest room in Alondra
House. Their suspicions of possi
ble asbestos were aroused after
the workers came back to finish
the repair work this week. When
the two freshmen asked about the
possibility of asbestos, the Uni
versity began to look into the sit
uation.
According to Suzanne Tamiesie,
Student Housing Operations man
ager, there is more of a problem
in the corridor than in the indi
vidual rooms. For this reason, the
University decided to evacuate the
entire third floor, despite the
measures already taken to prevent
leakage from the room. After
Monday's evacuation, mainte
nance workers closed off the end
of the corridor with plastic sheet
ing to prevent further asbestos
from traveling down the hall.
University unaware
At the emergency meeting last
night, third floor resident Dan
Mandel asked Keith Guy, director
of Housing and Food Sevices, why
it had taken the University three
weeks to investigate possible con
tamination. Guy responded that
he was not aware of the amount
of time that passed after the first
repairs began.
He said the University was
lucky that Bill Marquez, the fa
cilities supervisor, had just under
gone training to detect possible
sources of asbestos leakage.
"Somebody messed up," said
Decleve of the negligence on the
part of maintenance.
The Housing Office sent notices
to all students in University
housing in January warning

against potential problems with
asbestos in their rooms. Students
were warned not to puncture their
ceilings, and if they suspected any
damage, to notify housing offi
cials.
Lee asked Guy why mainte
nance workers were unaware of
potential asbestos hazards al
though the University had already
alerted students to the hazards.
He also questioned Stanford's
policy toward general mainte
nance of its facilities.
Guy said he recognized Lee's
"legitimate concerns," and ac
knowledged "the error made on
(facilities') part."

For the three- to six-day evacua
tion period, students were given
three options for new housing ar
rangements: apartments in Escon
dido Village, which could house
approximately 20 students; rooms
in Alpha Delta Phi fraternity,
which could house 10 men; and
rooms in Hyatt Rickeys and in
the Hyatt Palo Alto, which could
house all of the students three
miles from campus.
Only one of the freshmen has
a car, but about half chose to live
in the hotels.
The University said it will pay
for student transportation to and
from the hotels. Officials may pro

vide the students with Marguerite
bus service. The students will
remain on University food service.
And Assoc. Dean of Student Af
fairs Norm Robinson joked,
"We're not going to pick up any
room service tabs."
Asbestos levels not dangerous
After sampling the area sur
rounding room 318 on Monday
through a process called electro
microscopy, University health and
safety experts found a measure
of .085 asbestos fibers per cubic
centimeter in the air. According


April Pearson â€” Daily
Paloma House freshmen Kevin Hartz and Steve Solomon voice their concern about the predicament
of third-floor residents at a house meeting last night with Dean of Residential Affairs Norm Robinson
and other University officials to discuss the temporary evacuation.
