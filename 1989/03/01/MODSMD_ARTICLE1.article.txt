# 27 students evacuated due to asbestos leak
## 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
Twenty-five students were
evacuated from Paloma House
last night and two on Monday
night due to asbestos leakage
caused by University maintenance
work on the third floor corridor.
The asbestos leakage was a
direct result of fixing a ventilator
fan between a ceiling and the roof
in the all-freshman house in
Florence Moore Hall. The Univer
sity has notified students several
times in the past year and a half
about asbestos inspections and
possible problems. This is the lar
gest asbestos-related evacuation

of students from campus housing
in recent history.
The repairs began Jan. 25,
when workers drilled a hole in the
wall of room 318, which was oc
cupied by two freshmen. The re
pairs continued Feb. 2, when an
other hole was cut in the corridor
ceiling, connecting to the hole in
the room.
The asbestos was knocked loose
from the ceiling at that time,
meaning that students were pos
sibly exposed to the asbestos for
more than three weeks.
During an emergency dorm
meeting last night, Alain Decleve,
assistant director of Health and
Safety, emphasized that the as

bestos levels were not dangerous
and that prevention was the rea
son for evacuation.
Brian Meckler and Alex Lee, the
occupants of room 318, were
evacuated Monday night and
moved to a guest room in Alondra
House. Their suspicions of possi
ble asbestos were aroused after
the workers came back to finish
the repair work this week. When
the two freshmen asked about the
possibility of asbestos, the Uni
versity began to look into the sit
uation.
According to Suzanne Tamiesie,
Student Housing Operations man
ager, there is more of a problem
in the corridor than in the indi
vidual rooms. For this reason, the
University decided to evacuate the
entire third floor, despite the
measures already taken to prevent
leakage from the room. After
Monday's evacuation, mainte
nance workers closed off the end
of the corridor with plastic sheet
ing to prevent further asbestos
from traveling down the hall.
University unaware
At the emergency meeting last
night, third floor resident Dan
Mandel asked Keith Guy, director
of Housing and Food Sevices, why
it had taken the University three
weeks to investigate possible con
tamination. Guy responded that
he was not aware of the amount
of time that passed after the first
repairs began.
He said the University was
lucky that Bill Marquez, the fa
cilities supervisor, had just under
gone training to detect possible
sources of asbestos leakage.
"Somebody messed up," said
Decleve of the negligence on the
part of maintenance.
The Housing Office sent notices
to all students in University
housing in January warning

against potential problems with
asbestos in their rooms. Students
were warned not to puncture their
ceilings, and if they suspected any
damage, to notify housing offi
cials.
Lee asked Guy why mainte
nance workers were unaware of
potential asbestos hazards al
though the University had already
alerted students to the hazards.
He also questioned Stanford's
policy toward general mainte
nance of its facilities.
Guy said he recognized Lee's
"legitimate concerns," and ac
knowledged "the error made on
(facilities') part."

For the three- to six-day evacua
tion period, students were given
three options for new housing ar
rangements: apartments in Escon
dido Village, which could house
approximately 20 students; rooms
in Alpha Delta Phi fraternity,
which could house 10 men; and
rooms in Hyatt Rickeys and in
the Hyatt Palo Alto, which could
house all of the students three
miles from campus.
Only one of the freshmen has
a car, but about half chose to live
in the hotels.
The University said it will pay
for student transportation to and
from the hotels. Officials may pro

vide the students with Marguerite
bus service. The students will
remain on University food service.
And Assoc. Dean of Student Af
fairs Norm Robinson joked,
"We're not going to pick up any
room service tabs."
Asbestos levels not dangerous
After sampling the area sur
rounding room 318 on Monday
through a process called electro
microscopy, University health and
safety experts found a measure
of .085 asbestos fibers per cubic
centimeter in the air. According


April Pearson — Daily
Paloma House freshmen Kevin Hartz and Steve Solomon voice their concern about the predicament
of third-floor residents at a house meeting last night with Dean of Residential Affairs Norm Robinson
and other University officials to discuss the temporary evacuation.
to Decleve, the results are "far
below" standards set by the U.S.
Occupational Safety and Health
Administration.
The danger level set by OSHA
is .25 asbestos fibers per cubic
centimeter. However, Stanford
aims to keep the level below .01.
The levels currently in the air "are
permissible for people to work in
the area without protection" and
acceptable for students to retrieve
belongings for the next week, if
neccesary, Decleve said.
Decleve said more "aggressive
samples" need to be taken in the
next few days. Air pumps will be
used to "dislodge all the fibers as
much as we can," said Decleve.
Fortunately for the rest of
Paloma residents, said Decleve,
the ventilation system does not
connect the third floor to the
remaining two floors of the dor
mitory.
But air samples will be taken
in the other halls because some
of the vacuum cleaners that were
used to clean up the third-floor
dust were used on the first two
floors. Hyperfiltered vacuums are
normally used to clean asbestos,
but in the Paloma third-floor in
cident, maintenance workers were
unaware of the hazardous chemi
cals.
"Contamination via vacuum
cleaners is not a high possibility,
but we will sample other parts of
the building," said Decleve.
'Not a time for panic'
Ray Sims, resident fellow of
Alondra House, expressed concern
at a staff meeting about "whether
another student could replicate
the situation" that let asbestos
leak. Decleve replied that the area
was sawed by maintenance
workers, and was difficult to im
mitate. He added that asbestos
"is a übiquitous material and is
everywhere."
Guy said there is a law requir
ing all buildings to use asbestos
in their construction until it is
discovered that the materials
could be toxic. He noted that Cal
ifornia is the only state where
asbestos natually occurs in rocks.
Decleve said the short-term ef
fects of the asbestos exposure
were "negligible," but that long
term effects over a five- to six-year
period "would create a problem."
He added that "nothing is safe in

life," but that this is "not a crisis."
Concerned for belongings
Mendel told the University of
ficials that the plastic sheet
closing off the hallway had holes
in it. He also said clouds of dust
had fallen into his room, number
315, during the drilling. Decleve
said their asbestos air check had
taken "the worst-case hypothesis"
into account.
Decleve said the asbestos level
in question was "not a snowfall
situation," and that there might
be occasional asbestos fibers in
the air anyway.
Another resident asked whether
asbestos monitoring would con
tinue after the initial cleanup.
Decleve responded: "Asbestos
fibers are heavy — they never
disappear — even in your lungs.
They hang in the air unless you
disturb them."

Tamiesie said 30 "moon-suited"
workers would plastic-bag all
items that the students were con
cerned about.
The third floor will be sealed
off today at 2 p.m., when the
workers will begin air blowing the
hall. The students may be allowed
to return as early as Friday, but
no later than Tuesday.
Eighteen university officials
b?lped the students move their
belongings from Paloma to their
temporary lodging, providing
their cars and services throughout
the evening.
Most students were concerned
about their physics midterm
today, and their Structored
Liberal Education paper due Mon
day. The residence dean of
Florence Moore Hall, Jim
Larimore, said he is trying to ar
range extensions for the tests and
papers.
