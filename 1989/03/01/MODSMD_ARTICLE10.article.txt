Daley wins Chicago primary race
CHICAGO (AP) — Richard M. Daley, son of
the legendary bos9 of Chicago politics Richard J.
Daley, defeated Mayor Eugene Sawyer in a Demo
cratic primary yesterday and took a giant step
toward the City Hall office his father held for
21 years.
Daley built a commanding lead with overpower
ing support from predominantly white wards.
Although Sawyer, the city's second black mayor,
ran up impressive margins in his own stron
gholds, he was hampered by a lower turnout
among blacks than whites.
With 67 percent of the city's 2,911 precincts
reporting, Daley had 386,950 votes or 65 percent
to Sawyer's 206,345 votes or 34 percent. Three
other candidates divided the remaining votes.
If Daley wins the April 4 general election and
claims leadership of the nation's third-largest
city, it would mark the first time a white has
ousted a black mayor in one of the country's
biggest cities.
Usually, a victory in a Chicago Democratic
primary is enough to ensure victory in the general
election.
But this year could be different. The Republican
primary took on unusual interest in the past
week when former Democratic Alderman Edward
Vrdolyak announced a last-minute write-in cam

paign against endorsed GOP candidate Herbert
Sohn.
Sawyer needed heavy black turnout in order
to duplicate the victories of the late Harold Wash
ington, who became the city's first black mayor
in 1983 and four years later, the first since the
elder Daley to win re-election.
Teen drug use lowest since 1975
WASHINGTON (AP) — Drug use among nign
school seniors last year dropped to its lowest level
since 1975, said an annual survey released yes
terday. Still, more than half of all students use
an illegal drug at least once before graduating.
The continued decline in drug use suggests
that anti-drug campaigns educating the young
about the hazards of drug use are being heard,
said Lloyd Johnston, a University of Michigan
social psychologist and co-director of the study.
"These important successes have been achieved
not through supply reduction. They are due al
most entirely to a reduction in demand," Johnston
said.
The survey, which has been conducted by the
University of Michigan's Institute for Social Re
search every year since 1975, found that the
proportion of high school seniors who reported
having ever used an illegal drug dropped from
56.6 percent in 1987 to 53.9 percent in 1988.
