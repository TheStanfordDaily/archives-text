# Republicans try to delay Tower vote

WASHINGTON (AP) -
President Bush launched a full
court press yesterday to sal
vage John Tower's nomination
as his defense secretary while
Republicans sought to delay a
showdown vote until next
week.
"I'm working hard at it,"
Bush told reporters at a
picture-taking session during
an afternoon Cabinet meeting
after he met privately with a
dozen swing Democrats and
wavering Republicans but win
ning no new immediate pledges
of support.
"I'm committed," Bush said.
Senate Republican Leader
Bob Dole of Kansas, speaking
to reporters after an evening
meeting with Bush, said,
"We're going to go to the mat."
He said debate on the nomina
tion would begin this afternoon
or tommorow, possibly delay
ing a vote until next week.
"I would assume its going to
take more than a couple of
days," Dole said. "We need
some time to explain our case
to the American people because
I sense a change going on."
Dole said the confirmation
process "so far has not been
fair" to Tower.
Sen. John Warner, R-Va.,
ranking minority member on
the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said Republicans
planned a full-floor debate to
persuade Americans that Bush
has the right to his chosen nom
inee.
"We cannot let this case
stand as an example of whether
or not power was tried to be
wrested from the president of
the United States by the
majority in the Senate just for
political reasons," Warner said.
Before the evening meeting,
Republican Sen. Larry Pressler

of South Dakota, a wavering
senator important to the drive
to hold all 45 Senate Republi
cans in line, announced he was
"very much leaning against"
confirmation and urged Tower
to withdraw before a vote.
"I think that he may very
well be doing him (Bush) a fa
vor in this case," said Pressler,
who said he was fearful that
Tower would not be capable of

'We need some time
to explain our case
to the American
people because I
sense a change
going on.'

White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater told reporters
that there was "no chance
whatsoever" of the president
withdrawing the nomination.
"We're going to fight it out
as far as we can. We've con
vinced a lot of senators and we
hope to convince a lot more,"
said Fitz water, who refused to
specify what senators had been
won over.
Formal debate on the nomi
nation is scheduled to open
today, and senators are reading
a confidential FBI report on
the former Texas senator's
drinking habits, charges of
womanizing and lucrative con
sulting contracts with military
companies.
