CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) â€”
The government suspended con
stitutional rights yesterday and
imposed a curfew as riots over
price increases ravaged Venezuela
for a second day and looting
spread.
President Carlos Andres Perez
appealed on television for an end
to the "incredible tragcdy"which,
according to police estimates,
killed up to 50 people and injured
500.
Even as Perez spoke, gunfire
was heard in the streets and
rioting and looting continued in
the worst violence in 30 years of
democratic rule. Authorities said
thousands were arrested.
In the eastern shantytown of
Petare, battles between police and

rioters killed 17 people. Victims
were carried down from the hills
to major avenues to be taken to
hospitals while crowds watched,
said witnesses.
Civilians and police exchanged
gunfire and shop owners took up
arms to protect their property.
The Education Ministry ordered
school and university classes
suspended nationwide.
Among the rights suspended in
definitely were those guarantee
ing public gatherings, limits on
police searches and arrests, and
freedom of expression. The last
time that happened was 1964,
when Venezuela was plagued by
Cuban-backed guerrillas.
Riots exploded Monday over in

creases in bus fares and gasoline
prices, announced in a recent eco
nomic package that included
higher prices for food and basic
items. Violence began in Caracas
and rapidly spread to at least
seven other cities.
The measures, announced two
weeks after Perez took office Feb.
2, were required before the Inter
national Monetary Fund would
grant $1.5 billion in badly needed
credit. Venezuela signed a letter
of intent for the credit on yester
day.
Perez said the riots meant the
country was "risking the defini
tive consolidation of its demo
cratic process. This is an incred
ible tragedy, dozens have been
killed and (hundreds) wounded."
