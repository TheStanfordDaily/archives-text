Kennedy's proposal
for 'environmental
literacy' shows vision

THE EARTH is in the
throes of environmental
collapse, and University
President Donald Kennedy is
hoping to adjust Stanford's cur
riculum accordingly.
Applying both his authority
and his expertise to the pursuit
of a good idea, Kennedy sprung
his proposal for an environmental
studies course sequence last
week, passing the idea on for
open debate.
It's now the Stanford commu
nity's turn to take the baton and
run.
He envisions a unified three
quarter course sequence focusing
on both the social and scientific
angles of environmental policy
planning, or "environmental
literacy," as Kennedy calls it.
This interdisciplinary inroad
into one of today's most urgent
issues would enrich Stanford's
curriculum to the benefit of stu
dents in all majors.
The University community
showed great concern for and
commitment to environmental
conscientiousness' during the
January "You Can Make a Dif
ference" conference.
And one fall environmental
studies course that begins at 8
a.m. three days a week still draws
crowds every year. Partially ful
filling Kennedy's vision, Civil En
gineering Prof. Gil Masters'
highly praised class CE 170, "En
vironmental Science and Technol
ogy," comprehensively introduces
issues of pollution and energy
even to non-scientists.

Clearly, the interest is out
there. And so is the need. Witness
the dry fountains and smoggy
skylines.
And Kennedy, a former biology
professor, knows this. Witness
his proposal.
In line with curricular change
to address environmental con
cerns, the University should
seriously consider providing
space, if not funding, for an en
vironmental programs office
fashioned along the lines of the
student minority groups' centers.
Such a center could be a meet
ing place for groups such as Stu
dents for Environmental Action
at Stanford, which now meets in
a co-op lounge, as well as housing
resources for environmental
studies research.
However, Kennedy's proposal
is marred by one rotting issue.
In contrast to his ostentatious
proposal of the environmental
studies core, the initiative given
to improving ethnic studies
clearly lacks similar commitment
and seems to have slipped from
presidential vogue.
Because Kennedy is not espe
cially versed in ethnic studies, as
he is in biology and other natural
sciences, he is not the one to
outline a core for ethnic studies
at Stanford. But he is the one
who should call on Stanford's eth
nic experts to follow his example
and devise an ethnic studies plan
for community review.
No doubt he will intimately in
volve himself in the environmen
tal studies course formulation,
the area closest to his heart.
But he owes it to those who
have shown dauntless commit
ment to promoting ethnic studies
to keep that issue at the forefront
of Stanford's agenda, and let it
share the limelight with his en
vironmental studies brainchild.
