## Environmentally oriented houses shouldn't compete 
### 
Recently, the daily has
published negative reactions to
the proposal for an Environmen
tal Appreciation Focus House. A de
fense of the proposal through
clarification of the house's philosophies
and plans along with evidence of its
need seems timely.
The proposal for an Environmental
Appreciation Focus House outlines a
house "which would provide the Stan
ford community with programs which
revolve around the synthesis of differ
ent perspectives on our environment."
The house plans "to combine academic
programs with experiential learning on
the subject of our environment."
The house would be different from

Stanford's other environmentally
concerned residences. It would have a
specific focus: a formal declaration to
actively examine the environment for
and with the Stanford community.
Not only will the house consider the
impact of how it eats (regardless of
whether it is dubbed co-op, self-op or
University-operated), but it will also
integrate environmental issues and
activities into many other aspects of its
residents' lives.
The proposal states that the house
will have two types of programs:
academia and outings. The lectures
and seminars of guest speakers and
Stanford faculty will be correlated with
hands-on experience to create the ideal

learning situation.
This structured atmosphere will be
supplemented with the personal
sharing of experience and interest
which is inevitable in a community of
people with similar interests, ideas and
skills.
The need for a house which concen
trates on viewing the environment with
a broad perspective is increasingly
obvious. The success of the "You Can
Make a Difference" conference demon
strates the expansion of Stanford's
environmental inquisitiveness, as does
University President Donald Kennedy's
recent informal proposal of a new
course sequence in environmental
studies. Kennedy's estimated date for

the establishment of the sequence, fall
1990, would coincide appropriately with
a blossoming environmental focus
house.
The uniqueness of the house is
intended to contribute to the diversity
of a community of environmentally
oriented houses. The idea is not to
aggressively compete, but to stride
forward together towards a common
goal.
Is it not reasonable to broaden one's
perspective via as many routes as
possible? Residential Education will
soon make its reply.
