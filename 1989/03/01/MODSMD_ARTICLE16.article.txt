# Two sides to the Baker & McKenzie discrimination case
## 
### 
I am writing in response to the Feb.
22 article about motions to ban the
nation's largest law firm from recruit
ing at Stanford. My purpose is not to
justify racism or anti-Semitism, but to
attack careless journalism.
The Daily accurately reports the
following: a partner at Baker &
McKenzie, the firm in question, made
racist and anti-Semitic remarks to a
black woman he was interviewing at
the University of Chicago Law School.
As a result, several student groups at
Stanford Law School want to ban the
firm from interviewing on campus.
On these two points, the article is
correct, but it is incomplete. It quotes
neither Baker & McKenzie nor the
University of Chicago. One article from
The New York Times is not a sufTi-

cient resource for information, espe
cially when one picks and chooses from
the article to present only one aspect
of an issue.
No one, including Baker &
McKenzie, is denying that the attor
ney's remarks were entirely unaccepta
ble. That he will never again practice
law at Baker & McKenzie isn't men
tioned in The Daily.
Neither is it mentioned that in the
press release announcing its one-year
ban of Baker & McKenzie, the Univer
sity of Chicago commented, "We com
mend the firm for its cooperativeness,
its forthrightness and its seriousness of
purpose. It has handled the matter
with a high degree of sensitivity,
professionalism and institutional integ
rity."
I am not writing to urge the Law
School to allow the firm to recruit
here. I am simply reminding The Daily
to consider as many perspectives and
use as many sources as possible when
reporting on such an important topic.
