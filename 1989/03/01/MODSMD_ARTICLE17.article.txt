# Rosse didn't hedge' on Asian-American studies position
## 
### 
I write to correct a false impression
left by the Feb. 27 story on my meet
ing with Asian-American Student Asso
ciation representatives on that group's
proposal for a tenure-line faculty posi
tion in Asian-American history. The
Daily's article suggested that my posi
tion on this proposal was unclear.
I support AASA's proposal as a prio
rity for this university. Asian-American
history appears to be a developing
academic discipline, with scholars well
trained to teach in this field. Further,
I have no doubts regarding the
capacity of such an appointment to
make important contributions to our
curriculum.
The decision, however, as to whether
and when such an appointment pro
gram will develop at Stanford rests

with the School of Humanities and
Sciences and the pertinent departments
within the school, in accordance with
the University's budget planning proc
ess.
In this process, I provide schools and
departments with what are in essence
"block grants," and ask them to set
program priorities and allocate funds
within the limits of those grants. What
Richard Suh interpreted as my
"hedging and hawing" was a clear,
unequivocal statement to this effect.
I am prepared to transmit my views
on the importance of a faculty position
in Asian-American history to Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Ewart
Thomas, Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Thomas Wasow and History
Department Chair James Sheehan in a
meeting with AASA representatives
that I am taking steps to arrange.
It will be up to the school and the
department to determine priorities
among the many academic programs of
high value to the institution.
