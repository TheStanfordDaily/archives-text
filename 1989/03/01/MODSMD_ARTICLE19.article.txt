## Lessons from bicycle theft 
### 
LAST WEEK'S THEFT of my in
credible green bicycle left me
feeling quite bitter. I told my mom
over the phone about how I would take
an axe and cut the crook into pieces, but
she told me that was a bad idea.
I insisted that it was brilliant, so she
kept talking, suggesting that instead of
devoting energy and time to angry, futile
thoughts, I should try to learn something
from the theft. Since there was nothing
I could humanly do to get my bicycle
back, I should just think about other
things.
And now that I think about it, axe
murder is a pretty silly plan.
But I was justifiably upset last Monday
night when I came out of Falconer Li
brary to find no trace of my bicycle. I
was upset at the principle behind theft;
at how helpless and irreversible the sit
uation was (when I called the police the
next morning, they told me they were
too busy, that I should call back later!);
at how I no longer had my bicycle. So
sometimes that vengeful impulse I've
managed to repress makes its way up to
my mind again, and I want to do some
thing about it.
I have done something about it. I've
decided to look at the bike theft not in
an angry, vengeful way, but in such a
way that it could become a learning ex
perience. And it's been more worthwhile
than just sulking would have been.
Lately, I've been thinking a lot about
material independence. Living in an age
of fashionable materialism, high-priced
quality products and recreational (as op
posed to practical) shopping, it is easy to

lose sight of what is really important and
to become overwhelmed with possessions.
My worst experience last year was not
taking three finals in 12 hours or sleeping
30 hours in seven days. That was nothing
compared to staying up all night on the
last day of the school year trying to squish
all my junk into five big boxes. Sadly
enough, it was impossible.
This nightmarish experience started a
purge of materialism within me. I started
letting go of my possessions here and
there, not really caring about what I
owned, not really asking myself what was
important.
Because the theft made me angry about
not having something, it has allowed me
to see and think about things in a dif
ferent way. Instead of thinking about
having something, like most of us usually
do, it allowed me to think about lacking
something.
To comfort myself about my missing
bike, I thought about what else could
have been stolen. "At least it wasn't my
(uh) my (uh)..." I started thinking about
what I value, about what is most impor
tant to me. What would really upset me
if it were stolen?
I thought for a few seconds and smiled
to myself. The only two answers I came
up with were my blankets and my bioc
hemistry notebook, especially the
notebook. This notebook represents my
purpose at this school — to learn.
I would most definitely become trans
formed into a vengeful axe murderer if
the notebook disappeared. Losing my
bicycle allowed me to reflect upon and
realize what I value — learning. That

my notebook is most dear to me shows
this.
In fact, I had been at Falconer that
Monday night to look up the original
research article behind that day's lecture.
I had ridden to the library to do that
extra reading, out of pure interest in the
material.
If I can convince myself that my bicycle
has been sacrificed for the sake of learn
ing, I can relieve my grief about its loss.
If I had not been so interested in bio
chemistry, I would not have gone to the
library at such a late hour, and I would
still have my bicycle.
I smile at this conclusion because it
verifies for me the results of a recent
survey of this year's Stanford freshman
class. In this survey, conducted by the
American Council of Education, 93 per
cent of the respondents cited "to learn
more" as a reason for coming to Stanford.
I may not have my bicycle, but I still
can walk to my biochemistry lecture.
This learning attitude is inspiring to
me. Not only can I learn in classes, but
I can learn about myself through terrible
things like bicycle theft. But of course
I'm not suggesting that you go out and
get your bicycle stolen.

my mind again, and I want to do some
thing about it.
I have done something about it. I've
decided to look at the bike theft not in
an angry, vengeful way, but in such a
way that it could become a learning ex
perience. And it's been more worthwhile
than just sulking would have been.
Lately, I've been thinking a lot about
material independence. Living in an age
of fashionable materialism, high-priced
quality products and recreational (as op
posed to practical) shopping, it is easy to

lose sight of what is really important and
to become overwhelmed with possessions.
My worst experience last year was not
taking three finals in 12 hours or sleeping
30 hours in seven days. That was nothing
compared to staying up all night on the
last day of the school year trying to squish
all my junk into five big boxes. Sadly
enough, it was impossible.
This nightmarish experience started a
purge of materialism within me. I started
letting go of my possessions here and
there, not really caring about what I
owned, not really asking myself what was
important.
Because the theft made me angry about
not having something, it has allowed me
to see and think about things in a dif
ferent way. Instead of thinking about
having something, like most of us usually
do, it allowed me to think about lacking
something.
To comfort myself about my missing
bike, I thought about what else could
have been stolen. "At least it wasn't my
(uh) my (uh)..." I started thinking about
what I value, about what is most impor
tant to me. What would really upset me
if it were stolen?
I thought for a few seconds and smiled
to myself. The only two answers I came
up with were my blankets and my bioc
hemistry notebook, especially the
notebook. This notebook represents my
purpose at this school — to learn.
I would most definitely become trans
formed into a vengeful axe murderer if
the notebook disappeared. Losing my
bicycle allowed me to reflect upon and
realize what I value — learning. That

my notebook is most dear to me shows
this.
In fact, I had been at Falconer that
Monday night to look up the original
research article behind that day's lecture.
I had ridden to the library to do that
extra reading, out of pure interest in the
material.
If I can convince myself that my bicycle
has been sacrificed for the sake of learn
ing, I can relieve my grief about its loss.
If I had not been so interested in bio
chemistry, I would not have gone to the
library at such a late hour, and I would
still have my bicycle.
I smile at this conclusion because it
verifies for me the results of a recent
survey of this year's Stanford freshman
class. In this survey, conducted by the
American Council of Education, 93 per
cent of the respondents cited "to learn
more" as a reason for coming to Stanford.
I may not have my bicycle, but I still
can walk to my biochemistry lecture.
This learning attitude is inspiring to
me. Not only can I learn in classes, but
I can learn about myself through terrible
things like bicycle theft. But of course
I'm not suggesting that you go out and
get your bicycle stolen.
