# Paloma residents left bewildered and upset

Packing their clothes and books
into suitcases, boxes and blue
plastic trash bags, third floor res
idents of Paloma House could do
little but laugh and wonder, "Why
us?"
Although the freshmen resi
dents agreed that the University
is doing all it can to assist them
in moving to temporary housing,
they are angry that the University
permitted exposure of the as
bestos in the first place.
"There was no cohesive policy
and no communication between
the workers and the people who
would check for asbestos," said
resident Kim Freidberg. "They
should have been aware of the
danger."
Freidberg added, however, that

the University had been fair about
the way it handled the evacuation.
"They have accomplished a lot in
a short period of time."
Brian Meckler, whose room was
cordoned off after asbestos had
fallen from his cut-open ceiling,
criticized how the University fixed
a fan between his ceiling and the
roof, calling it a "mom and pop
operation."
"It was such an impromptu af
fair," he said. "Things leading up
to this (evacuation) were handled
on a day-by-day basis. There was
no foresight in the planning."
Meckler's roommate, Alexander
Lee, criticized the University's
"negligence" in not testing for as
bestos three weeks ago, when the
work on the ceiling actually took
place.
