# Paloma residents left bewildered and upset
## 
### Rob Burwell Staff writer 
Packing their clothes and books
into suitcases, boxes and blue
plastic trash bags, third floor res
idents of Paloma House could do
little but laugh and wonder, "Why
us?"
Although the freshmen resi
dents agreed that the University
is doing all it can to assist them
in moving to temporary housing,
they are angry that the University
permitted exposure of the as
bestos in the first place.
"There was no cohesive policy
and no communication between
the workers and the people who
would check for asbestos," said
resident Kim Freidberg. "They
should have been aware of the
danger."
Freidberg added, however, that

the University had been fair about
the way it handled the evacuation.
"They have accomplished a lot in
a short period of time."
Brian Meckler, whose room was
cordoned off after asbestos had
fallen from his cut-open ceiling,
criticized how the University fixed
a fan between his ceiling and the
roof, calling it a "mom and pop
operation."
"It was such an impromptu af
fair," he said. "Things leading up
to this (evacuation) were handled
on a day-by-day basis. There was
no foresight in the planning."
Meckler's roommate, Alexander
Lee, criticized the University's
"negligence" in not testing for as
bestos three weeks ago, when the
work on the ceiling actually took
place.
Resident Assistant Tom Chi, a
senior, said the University is
"doing everything it can" with its
limited options to accomodate the
students forced to evacuate. Uni
versity officials "probably acted
in the best possible manner, but
they certainly dug a hole for them
selves," Chi said, by not checking
for asbestos before they began
work on the ceiling.
Chi added that the evacuation
was a "mtyor inconvenience." He
said as many as nine of the people
on his floor had physics midterms
today and that residents enrolled
in Structured Liberal Education
have papers due Monday.
Daniel Madell said he wished
the Universitv "could have made
an arrangement with Food Service

so I don't have to truck over to
eat."
He complained as well that he
had a midterm on Friday and two
papers due Monday.
Residents were told to pack
everything they thought they
would need for six days. They
hurried to call parents and friends,
stuff underwear into suitcases and
ready their belongings for Univer
sity movers to pick up.
Susie Wu attended last night's
meeting in slightly disheveled con
dition after being awakened from
a nap. Although shocked by the
news, Wu said, "The University
is trying to make things as con
venient as possible for us."
Her roommate, Colleen Terrell,
said the University is doing "an
incredible job of dealing with the
situation. It's an inconvenience,
but they're trying to make it as
easy on us as possible," she said.
