# Injuries to runners can be sidestepped
## 
### Lauren Friedly Staff writer 
"You can cram for finals, but
not for fitness," said Tim Bow
man, the physical therapist at
Cowell Student Health Center.
With the return of the warm
weather, runners and joggers
are flocking outdoors hoping to
cram in some recreational fit
ness before spring break. Run
ning for sport and pleasure is
one of the simplest and least
expensive ways to stay healthy
and thus is very popular for
Stanford students.

However, Bowman said one
of the most common injuries
he sees at Stanford is running
injuries.
Although most injuries are
minor sprains and strains, even
minor injuries can become
chronic problems if left un
treated.
Up to 70 percent of joggers
will at some time sustain a
running-related injury. The
knee is the most common site
for injury, accounting for about
40 percent of all running inju
ries.
The most common causes of
injuries are trying to do too
much, too fast, too soon and
wearing improper shoes.
The President's Council on
Physical Fitness and Sports re
ported recently that the most
important item of equipment
for the runner is a pair of
sturdy, properly fitting run
ning shoes. Shoes with good
arch and heel supports and well
padded or cushioned soles are
suggested. Because running
shoes are the only major ex
pense of this sport, runners
should not shy away from
making an investment in a pair
of quality running shoes. Run
ning shoes should be taken to
your doctor or physical thera
pist for evaluation.
On the average, runners' feet
hit the ground between 800 and
2,000 times per mile. At each
step, the impact is between two
to four times the body weight,
depending on terrain and body
weight.
When running downhill,

across slopes or on pavement,
the impact of each stride mul
tiplies dramatically, up to eight
times the body weight at each
step. Thus, good running shoes
with enough support to absorb
this shock are crucial.
According to Bowman, a pair
of running shoes should be used
for no more than 500 to 700
miles of running. After 100
miles, 30 percent of the shock
absorption is lost from the
shoes. After 300 to 500 miles,
50 percent of the shock absorp
tion can be lost from the shoes.
Some people are predisposed
to injury. Inadequate warm-up
can also predispose runners to
stress injuries. In addition to
quality running shoes, good
warm-up and stretching exer
cises are necessary to avoid
stress to the legs, knees, feet
and back. For more informa
tion about good stretching ex
ercises, contact your doctor,
trainer or physical therapist.
A proper running surface is
also essential to avoid iryury.
A soft, level dirt path is ideal.
Concrete sidewalks increase
the shock impact to the legs
and feet, and running on un
even grassy surfaces can cause
sprained or twisted ankles.
Although running is not for
everyone, the health benefits
of running are many. Running
can strengthen the heart, can
strengthen the heart, muscles
and bones, lower blood pres
sure, help burn fat and increase
muscle tone. Running can also
help relieve stress and produce
a calming sense of well-being.
Alternate forms of exercise,
however, should be part of
every good exercise routine.
Running should be alternated
by swimming, bicycling,
weight-training, walking or
low-impact aerobics.
Experts agree that runners
should listen to their bodies to
help avoid injury. Do not "run
through pain." Many runners
buy into the concept "no pain,
no gain." However, there is no
evidence to support this atti
tude. Doing too much, too fast,
too soon is bound to cause in
jury.
