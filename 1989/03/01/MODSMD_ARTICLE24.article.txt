## The 						Dish transmits a colorful history

OSCAR 9 talked to itself, com
pletely oblivious to its surround
ings.
Miles away, its master urgently
called to it. But OSCAR 9 seemed
content to listen to its own loud
babbling rather than the weak
pleading of its master.
It took the work of the metallic
giant standing in the Stanford
Foothills to save OSCAR 9 from
extinction in September 1982.
The 150-foot parabolic antenna
reached up into the heavens with
its powerful transmission to pluck
the satellite from a cold and lonely
death.
UOSAT-OSCAR 9, the British
satellite, had accidentally turned
on its transmitters and had blared
them so loudly it couldn't receive
the transmission from the earth.
The Dish responded by bursting
a powerful signal to turn off the
satellite's transmitters so that it
could once again respond to its
master.
Thanks to the Dish, OSCAR 9
was able to resume its scientific
duties.
To a student, the Dish is but a
stop on a jogger's trail through
the foothills. To scientists, the
Dish has been a valuable tool to
probe the nature of the solar sys
tem and the earth's atmosphere.
The U.S. government built the
Dish on Stanford land in 1962.
Ever since, SRI International has
been operating the Dish.
When it was built, the Dish and
its three identical companions —
two on the East Coast and one
built in Scotland, but later moved
to Germany — were among the
most powerful instruments of
their kind, according to Electrical
Engineering Prof. Von Eshleman.
Among the Dish's original func
tions was gathering data on the
ionosphere, that part of the
earth's atmosphere extending
from 25 to 250 miles about its
surface. The ionosphere is so
named because it contains many
charged particles called ions,
created when meteors collide into
air molecules at high speeds.
The ionosphere is crucial for
radio communication, as radio
waves reflect from the ions which
serve as "long, thin, wire-like con
ductors", according to Eshleman.
This reflection allows radio waves
to be transmitted beyond the
horizon.
In addition, the Dish measured
the effects of Pacific Island nu
clear blasts on the ionosphere.
In 1965, the Dish was upgraded
to perform spacecraft communi
cation. It was involved with
various Pioneer missions as well

as the highly successful Mariner
5 voyage to Venus in 1968.
By beaming signals through the
atmosphere of Venus to Mariner
5 stationed behind the planet,
astronomers gathered data funda
mental to their understanding of
Venus' ionosphere.
The Dish is sensitive to waves
anywhere between 50 centimeters
to 6 meters long. Monitoring
human speech with wavelengths
around 30 centimeters, then, is
out of the question, but not so
for prime-time television — the
carrier frequencies for VHF trans
missions occupy the one to 10 me
ter range.

The computer still used to con
trol the Dish is a PDP-8 originally
installed in 1964. The PDP-8,
with its germanium transistors
and "core memory," is a relic in
computer history.
Relic or not, the Dish continues
to be used three or four times a
year. In fact, the Dish was recently
considered to perform a satellite
sign language of sorts. Scientists
thought about sending signals to
the crippled Voyager spacecraft
scheduled to fly by Neptune next
November. Of the Voyager's two
receivers, one has failed and the
other is damaged. Eshleman
likened this damage to "losing one

ear with the other bad."
Although the Dish won't actu
ally be used for communication
to Voyager, it still serves a great
purpose for Stanford students.
Many a picnic lunch has been
eaten in the shadow of the sleep
ing giant on the hills overlooking
the campus, and many a jogger
has endured the steepness of the
trail to the Dish.
And as many early-morning
runners will surely attest, the
Dish serves as the site where
many a policy decision has been
made by University President
Donald Kennedy, who is perhaps
Stanford's greatest fan of the
satellite dish.


... ran away with the spoon.
The sun dips behind Stanford's sleeping giant of the foothills. The 29-year-old satellite dish is used
three or four times each year to study the earth's atmosphere.
