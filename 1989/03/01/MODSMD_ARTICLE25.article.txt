Q. Why do frisbees and paper
• airplanes fly?
A. Frisbees, paper airplanes
• and real airplanes fly be
cause their shape produces suc
tion on their top surfaces which
pushes them upward, according

to Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Alan Adler, designer of the
Aerobie.
The air pressure on the upper
surfaces of the frisbees and planes
is less than the air pressure of
the lower surface. This effect oc
curs because the velocity of the
air at the top surface is greater
than the velocity of the other sur
face, said Physics Prof. Mason
Yearian.
Known as the Bernoulli effect,
the difference in air velocity on
both surfaces is due to the shape
of the frisbee and the spin of the
frisbee.
The number of molecules pass
ing over both surfaces must be
the same due to the conservation
of air flow. Because the top of a
frisbee is larger than the the bot

torn is, as in an airplane wing,
the air flow over the top must
have a greater velocity.
Due to the difference in the
velocities, the concentration of air
molecules on the top surface of
these devices is less than the con
centration on the bottom.
This smaller concentration on
the upper surface means a
decrease of air pressure, and the
result is a suction effect which
counteracts the force of gravity.
Frisbees fly as a result.
Q # What are those patterns of
• swirling colors that you see
on the backsides of your eyelids
when you close your eyes? I used
to try to reach out and grab them
in the dark, but they always got
away!

Those colors you see
when you close your
eyes tightly are the
result of the pressure
applied on eyeballs
by the eyelids.

A. If you're not using hal
• lucinogens, those colors you
see when you close your eyes
tightly are the result of the pres
sure applied on eyeballs by the
eyelids, according to Dr. Dennis
Ratinoff, a Palo Alto optometrist.
Most nerves are designed to
detect certain stimuli. If an ex

treme stimulus of another kind
is applied to any nerve, it can
send a signal. For example, bur
ning a pressure-sensitive nerve
will cause it to send a signal.
Likewise, the optical nerve can
be stimulated by mechanical pres
sure, even though it is designed
to respond to light. Closing your
eyes tightly, rubbing your eyes or
having a migraine headache can
cause the visual receptors on the
retina to send signals to the brain
through the optical nerve.
