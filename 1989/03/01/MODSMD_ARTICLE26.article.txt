### David Earnest Editorial staff 
The Stanford baseball team
won yesterday. Easily, in fact.
That's right. The preseason No.
1, currently unranked, 10-10 Car
dinal baseball team finally won
an easy contest, destroying the
Dons of the University of San
Francisco 12-4 yesterday at
Sunken Diamond.

Cardinal 12, Dons 4

Right fielder Paul Carey and
first baseman Brian Johnson each
hit two-run home runs to lead a
10-hit barrage against San Fran
cisco pitching. With the loss, the
Dons fall to 2-8.
"We hit the ball well, as well
as we have hit it all year," Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess said.
"Even some outs were hit hard."
Leading the offense was
Johnson, who was 2-for-4 with
three RBI, including a third
inning line shot off the score
board in left field that drove in
the final two runs of the five-run
inning.
Carey went 3-for-5 at the plate
with a bloop single, a line single
and a two-run homer.
The Stanford pitching staff,
however, could not match the im
pressive efforts of the Cardinal
batters. Four pitchers gave up 12
hits, including a five-hit, three
run first inning that forced the
Cardinal to fight its way back into
the game.
Stanford starter Aaron Dor
larque got Don center fielder Mike
Campas to pop up to center for
the first out of the game but
quickly got into trouble. Dor
larque gave up hits to the next
four batters before he was pulled
by Marquess.

Right-hander Brian Keyser
then entered the game with Stan
ford down 2-0 and San Francisco's
Ron Nocetti on second. Don third
baseman Jim Yertzil took
Keyser's first offering and slapped
it to left field to score Nocetti.
Keyser then struck out Pete
Columbo and Stanford catcher
Eric Cox threw out Yertzil as he
tried to steal second to end the

inning.
With San Francisco up 3-0 and
the Stanford pitching staff
seeming to struggle, the Cardinal
fought back in the bottom half of
the first. Leadoff man Frank
Carey walked on four pitches and,
after Steve Solomon looked at a
third strike, Paul Carey came to
the plate and authoritatively
deposited a 1-0 high fastball over

the scoreboard in left-center field.
Stanford was back in the game
at 3-2.
After the Dons scored a run in
the top of the third, Frank Carey
opened the bottom half by reach
ing second on a throwing error
by Yertzel. He then moved to third
on a wild pitch and scored on
Solomon's ground out to second
baseman Columbo.

Then the floodgates opened.
Paul Carey blooped an infield
single up the middle and shortstop
Troy Paulsen walked. Then des
ignated hitter Tim Griffin singled
to right to score Carey and Paul
sen scored on a throwing error.
Stanford led for the first time 5-4.
After third baseman David
Holbrook struck out, Johnson laid
into a 2-1 fastball and lined it into

the scoreboard in left-center field.
With the five runs in the third,
the Cardinal would never look
back.
"They're not the caliber of team
(that we normally face)," Mar
quess said after the victory yes
terday."I was happy that we broke
out and hit some balls hard, re
gardless of who the opponent
was."
