# 'T.C.' shoulders offensive load

### Bruce Sarkisian Senior staff writer 
Like it or not, junior Paul
Carey will be immortalized in
Stanford history for one hit â€”
a one-out, grand-slam home
run in the 10th inning of a
College World Series game
which put Stanford over the
top against Louisiana State, 6-
5. The Cardinal went on to win
the championship in 1987,
Carey's freshman year.
Two seasons later, people
still talk about that homer, and
when the subject of Stanford's
offense comes up, discussion
gravitates to Carey. When he
doesn't hit, in general the Car
dinal doesn't score.
Last weekend's game against
California is a prime example.
Carey wore the collar in the
three-game series, going 0-for
-12. Not coincidentally Stanford
scored just four runs in three
games, with most of those com
ing on a combination of walks,
singles and sacrifices.
Stanford Coach Mark Mar
quess has had to endure bat
ting slumps by most of his
players this season, but no
doubt when Paul Carey's bat
falls asleep Marquess doesn't.

According to Marquess,
Carey's slump was due to
timing and balance on curve
balls, which Cal's pitchers were
using effectively against him.
"He was off balance all week
end, and he was guessing too
much on pitches," Marquess
said.
Carey agreed. "I was feeling
completely disoriented. I wasn't
seeing the ball well. [The curve
ball] isn't a problem if I wait
on it."
But yesterday San Francisco
pitcher Mark Pecha made the
mistake of throwing Carey a
high, outside fastball in the
first inning which was sum
marily deposited over the
scoreboard by Cardinal's star
right fielder.
It could be just what Carey
needed to break out of his
slump. He proceeded to go 3-
for-5 on the day with two RBI
and three runs scored.
With so much pressure on
him to spark the Cardinal of
fense, what did it feel like to
hit that first round-tripper of
the season?
"I literally lost about 40
pounds with that home run
today," Carey concluded in his
inimitable New England style.
