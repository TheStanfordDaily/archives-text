# Naysayers beware — the Card is stacked against you
## 
### 
The daffodils are blooming. The sun
is shining brightly. Students are
trading in their pants for shorts in
droves.
It's beginning to look a lot like spring
at Stanford.

And for the sports fan on the Farm,
that means the most joyous time of year
is just around the corner.
You've been there before (if you ha
ven't, you're not reading this column).
Baseball on the grassy hill at Sunken

Diamond. Tennis and a suntan at the
Tennis Stadium.
The best thing about it is that the
endless victories piled up by the Cardinal
nine and the Stanford netters almost al
ways erase the bitter taste left behind
by disappointing seasons on the
hardwood.
But wait, the world is upside down
this year.
Pick up a paper. (The Daily will
do.) The men's basketball team is ranked
13th in the land, the women nine notches
higher.
Stanford University, for this brief mo
ment, what James Joyce would call an
epiphany, is the finest basketball school
in the U.S. of A.
Should the men defeat USC in rollick
ing Maples Pavilion Thursday night,
they'll complete the regular season with
a perfect home record and a 24-5 tally.
Even if you don't have a ticket yet,
you can be there to see Todd Lichti,

Howard Wright, Eric Reveno, Terry
Taylor and Scott Meinert in their Maples
swan song. Today and tomorrow from 9
to 9:30 a.m. a total of 500 tickets will
be made available to students at the Ath
letic Department ticket office.
None will be sold on game night, so
get yours while you can.
The women, on the other hand, have
their home finale a week from Saturday
against USC. They'll not only have a
chance at a perfect home mark (You mean
to say that every time a Stanford hoops
team took the floor at home this year it
came away with a win? Are you crazy?)
but also can complete a Pacific 10 Con
ference perfecto — an 18-0 conference
record.
There'll probably be about 5,000 empty
seats for that one, which is really too
bad because the team is something to
see. They've also got a good chance to
wind up in the Final Four. Not too shab
by.
How far will the men go in the NCAA

Tournament? That seems to be a favorite
topic of conversation amongst the faithful
as well as the faithless, the bandwagon
jumpers, the converts and the johnny
come-latelies. _
I was talking to a couple of guys in
Sterling Quad today and was commenting
on the nice weather. They nodded, turned
away and one of them muttered snidely,
"Stanford's not going to the Final Four."
It was a reference to a certain column
written last week by a certain columnist
(namely me).
For those who missed it, a scenario was
presented in which the Cardinal was
about to tussle with the Arizona Wildcats
for the national championship in Seattle.
This naysayer, and many of his ilk,
seem compelled to doubt the Cardinal —
to doubt its 23 wins, to doubt its high
national ranking, to doubt the prowess
of All-Universe Todd Lichti and All-Pac
-10 Howard Wright (and the superb cast
that surrounds them).

They are certain the Cardinal will be
lucky to reach the Sweet 16 and will
need a Moses-parting-the-Red-Sea
miracle to do any better.
Let them-wallow in tk>om-and
gloom world that knows no sunshine and
lacks the sweet smell of daffodils.
There are some among us who Believe.
We have seen Patrick Ewing's mighty
Georgetown Hoyas fall to Villanova on
the night the Wildcats shot the lights out.
We have seen an unbeatable Oklahoma
Sooner squad succumb to Danny Man
ning's underdog Kansas Jayhawks.
To the rest of you evil step-sisters and
step-brothers: a rotten pumpkin pie will
give you your just desserts. For the
Believers: a sincere wish that this time
will be the charm and that a certain shoe
will fit after all.
