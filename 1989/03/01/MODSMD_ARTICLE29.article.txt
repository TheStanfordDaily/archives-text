# Spikers host Gauchos
## 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
They've got a good thing going.
Yesterday, the Tachikara Men's
Volleyball Top 20 came out and
Stanford was the beneficiary of
the only change made in the top
10. Stanford moved ahead of the
University of Hawaii to the No.
2 spot, although the margin of
the overall vote was extremely
slim (221 votes to 219). UCLA
remained unscathed at the top of
the Tachikara heap.
The new ranking is the highest
ever to be achieved by a Stanford
men's team. Stanford's improved
national ranking, however, will
immediately be put to the test
against the invading Gauchos of
No. 4 UC-Santa Barbara. Tonight
at 7:30 in Maples Pavilion, the
two teams will square off for the
second time this season.
Stanford won the first meeting
at Santa Barbara earlier this
season in five games, the last of
which was a blowout, 15-4.
However, the final score of that
last game is probably not indica
tive of Santa Barbara's true
mettle. In fact, Stanford Coach
Fred Sturm has nothing but re
spect for this tough Gaucho team.
"These guys beat UCLA in
three games earlier this season,"
Sturm said. "And if that doesn't
give you some idea of their talent,
they've also beaten USC and Pep
perdine, and the USC game was
on the road."
Then, almost as an after
thought, Sturm added with a nod,
"And don't forget — last year
these guys almost won the na
tional championship. They did
lose (Dave) Rottman, but they've
filled in for him very well."

Indeed, Jose Gandara and Eric
Fonoimoana have stepped up
their play a notch to compensate
for the loss of Rottman. The two
Gaucho hitters have led their
team to incredible success against
their Western Intercollegiate Vol
leyball Association opponents.
However, in the match against
Stanford, the stellar play of Gan
dara and Fonoimoana was miss
ing. Gandara hit .250 while
Fonoimoana could only scrape up
a .140 hitting percentage. Stan
ford fans have to be a little con
cerned about what might happen
should the Gaucho duo heat up.
In the Stanford victory at Santa
Barbara, the Cardinal players
played an exceptional match while
Santa Barbara's stars were strug
gling. Scott Fortune and Dan
Hanan combined for 73 kills; For
tune hit over .300 and Hanan had
a phenomenal showing of better
than .450. Duncan Blackman may
have played his best match of the
year, compiling 16 kills, and Stan
ford bench play was exceptional.
Sturm said, "I look for tonight's
match to be a really long match.
Santa Barbara is a good side-out
team. We have to play with them
and just try to outlast them. All
we can do is try to play our game
and keep up our intensity for the
entire match. We will try to start
faster than we did against them
last time. Our guys have devel
oped some new warmup tech
niques that should have us better
prepared to play hard right from
the first serve."
Stanford will try to hang on to
its share of the league lead with
a victory. The Cardinal currently
has only one league loss, that at
the hands of the Hawaii Rainbow-
Warriors.
