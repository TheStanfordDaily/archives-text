# Loop, Voorsanger team up to propel gymnastics
## 
### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
Why these two don't hate
each other is one of the world's
great mysteries.
Well, perhaps not one of its
great mysteries, but still, it's
surprising that Stanford gym
nasts Conrad Voorsanger and
Charles Loop get along as well
as they do. The secret, they
say, is maintaining a sense of
humor about the whole deal.
Voorsanger, Loop and their
teammates take the floor
tonight at California's Harmon
Arena for a four-way meet. Of
its opponents — the Bears,
Michigan, and UCLA — the
Cardinal (10-2) will be concen
trating primarily on defeating
the Bruins, who have placed
among the top three teams at
the NCAA Championships each
of the last three years.
For Voorsanger and Loop,
the meet will just be two more
hours of their lives wherein one
can't seem to get out of the
presence of the other.
The two juniors lived in the
same dorm last year and are
roommates off campus this
year. They take the same
courses. They both work in the
mechanical engineering depart
ment, one pursuing his me
chanical engineering mi\jor, the
other studying product design.
As well, they both have
played vital roles in the success
of the Stanford gymnastics pro
gram since their freshman

years. And they're both cur
rently ranked among the
United States' top 20 gym
nasts, Voorsanger at No. 9,
Loop at No. 19.
So, do they hate each other?
"Only on weekends," says
Loop.
"We're buddies to the end,"
says Voorsanger. "We're get
ting to be like Siamese twins."
Of course, they're not identi
cal twins, not quite. In fact,
when the two first came to
Stanford, they seemed an un
likely pair.
"We were incredibly differ
ent, fundamentally,"
Voorsanger says. "Now we're
kind of blending together."
"We were pretty far apart,"
Loop agrees, classifying himself
as a "conservative Republican"
from Dallas and Voorsanger as
a "radical Californian".
During this quarter when
they're often traveling to away
meets, it's harder than ever to
stay in contact with the outside
world. "We're losing friends
quickly," Voorsanger admitted.
It's probably not as bad as
all that, but if being team
mates, roommates and class
mates puts a strain on their
relationship and creates fierce
rivalry in the gym, the world
would never know it. Then
again, if either earns All-
American honors at April's
NCAA Championships, you can
bet he won't share his medal.
