# Legislative Council:
## Some free speech breaks the rules 
### Goodwin Liu Senior staff writer 
The debate over restricting
freedom of expression at Stanford
took a new turn this morning, as
the Student Conduct Legislative
Council released a much
anticipated statement argu»ng
that "some forms of expression
can . . . constitute violations of the
Fundamental Standard."
In a two-page opinion, the coun
cil proposed that both individuals
and groups on campus should
have the right to be free from
forms of expression that degrade
persons or groups on the basis of
"personal or cultural differences."
Such differences include
"gender, race, color, sexual orien
tation, physical abilities, national
or ethnic origin, and religious af
filiation," stated the proposal,
which is the latest paper about

freedom of expression among
many circulating on campus this
year.
The statement distinguishes be
tween these "personal and cul
tural differences" and intellectual
differences, or "differences in
beliefs." Only individuals, and not
groups, are entitled to be free from
forms of expression that victimize
them on the basis of intellectual
differences in beliefs, according to
the statement.
The legislative council, consist
ing of six faculty members, five
students and one administrator,
sets Stanford's policies governing
student conduct.
The proposed legislation enters
a 21-day waiting period, during
which the University community
may review it and suggest
changes. (The full text, titled "In
terpretations and Applications of
the Fundamental Standard in the
Area of Diversity," appears as a
paid advertisement on page 2.)
Council members and Univer
sity officials who were contacted
yesterday declined to comment
until they and the community can
review the statement.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole, a non-voting council mem
ber, emphasized that the proposal
defends the right of all students
to hold their own opinions: "No
student at Stanford has a right
to prevent another from holding
a particular opinion ...the pro
posal states.
What the statement seeks to
restrict, Cole said, are forms of
expression, such as obscenities

and epithets, which "discourage
students from full participation in
the University's life on the bases
of personal, cultural and intellec
tual differences."
"There are ways to express
beliefs without hurting other
people," she said. "In my (inter
pretation) of the statement, the
legislation (if enacted) would
restrict not the content of expres
sion, but the form one expresses
it in."
The council stated that forms
of expression involving "personal
abuse" or "defamation of groups"
may violate the Fundamental
Standard, but the proposal did not
include a list of specific prohibited
forms of expression.
"It was not the intent of the
council to write a ... code-specific
statement," according to council
chair George Parker, a professor
in the Graduate School of Busi
ness.

Although the Student Conduct Legislative Council makes proposals for a Fundamental Standard Interpretation and has final word on the
Issue, students, faculty and administration officials have plenty of chances for Influence In the long approval process.
