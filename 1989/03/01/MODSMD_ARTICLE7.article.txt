# Arms control center picks new co-director
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Stanford's Center for International Se
curity and Arms Control, recovering from
recent resignations, has chosen a new leader
to replace Prof. Sidney Drell, who will step
down this year as co-director amid a dispute
over professorial appointments.
William Perry, an undersecretary of de
fense in the Carter administration and cur
rent member of the arms control center,
will take over Drell's post this summer if
he receives an appointment in the Depart
ment of Engineering and Economic Sys
tems, according to John Lewis, the center's
other co-director.
Perry, who has given guest lectures in
Stanford's arms control classes, was un
available for comment yesterday because
he was aboard an airplane bound for Stan
ford. In his absence, University officials
sung his praises.
"Perry has academic experience com
bined with real-world experience that will
be hard to beat," University Provost James
Rosse said.
Prof. David Luenberger, chair of the De
partment of Engineering and Economic
Systems, said Perry's recommendation
from the department, if made, will be ap

proved in the next few weeks. Although
he emphasized that the search for a faculty
appointment was open to others,
Luenberger said Perry is "an extraordinar
ily gifted person who will bring a multitude
of abilities to Stanford."
If he is appointed, Perry's strong tech
nical background will help save the arms
control center from the difficulties that
have plagued it since Drell announced his
resignation in November, arms control ex
perts predicted yesterday.
Drell contends that the University should
grant the interdisciplinary center the au
thority to make its own professorial ap
pointments, which is usually reserved for
individual departments.
Following Drell, senior research fellow
Ted Postol and former astronaut and arms
control fellow Sally Ride announced they
will also leave this year. The three — par
ticularly Drell — were the cornerstone of
the technical analysis of arms control that
has long been the pride of the center.
Lewis, a political science professor, said
Perry is a "wonderfully generous person"
and will bring "immense strengths in sci
ence and technology" to the center. As un
dersecretary for defense from 1977 to 1981,
