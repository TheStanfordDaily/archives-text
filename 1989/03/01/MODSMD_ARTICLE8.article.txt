# Webb fire remains mystery
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
Investigators still don't know
what caused the fire that
destroyed the home of Webb
Ranch's director early Sunday
morning.
"There are accidental causes
that can't be ruled out, and we
can't rule out arson," said Mike
Martin, an investigator with the
California Department of Forestry
and Fire Protection who has been
at the fire scene since Sunday.
Ranch director Gary Webb and
his family were not at home at
the time of the fire, which caused
an estimated $110,000 in dam
ages. The family is now staying
at the home of Webb's father,
retired ranch owner Stanley
Webb.
Because the home was totally
destroyed, Martin said, searching
for clues to the cause of the fire
has been difficult. But he added
that a wall heater was left on
near an upholstered chair, and he
strongly suspects the fire may

have begun there.
However, he said the possibility
of arson is also being closely
scrutinized, given the current ten
sions between management and
ranch workers, many of whom
want to unionize.
Reviewing ranch worker
housing on Feb. 18, San Mateo
County inspectors cited the ranch
for 75 state health and safety vi
olations. Three days later, attor
neys for the United Stanford
Workers filed a lawsuit against
Webb Ranch and the University
on behalf of ranch workers,
seeking to protect the workers
from harassment.
The ranch, located between Al
pine Road and Interstate 280, is
on property owned by the Uni
versity.
A meeting between USW offi
cials and ranch management to
discuss housing conditions was
scheduled for yesterday but was
postponed until Friday.
According to USW field repre
sentative Reuben Serna, Webb
Ranch officials "said they needed

more time to study the housing
question and overcrowding issues
and wanted more time to gather
facts."
Ranch representatives were not
available last night to comment
on the fire or the negotiations.
The University is not par
ticipating in the talks because
Stanford does not employ any
Webb Ranch workers and does not
have authority over the ranch's
"agricultural enterprises," accord
ing to University attorney at law
Michael Vartain.
However, Vartain told the Uni
versity News Service that the ad
ministration is concerned about
the health and safety citations
and has been assured by ranch
management that the violations
will be corrected by mid-March.
A San Mateo County Superior
Court judge issued a temporary
restraining order Feb. 22 to
prevent ranch managers from
retaliating for the workers'
protest of housing conditions. A
hearing to consider a tougher pre
liminary injunction is set for
March 20.
