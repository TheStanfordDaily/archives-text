## Bookstores bombed for selling 'Verses' 
### 
BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) - Two
bookstores that sold all their
copies of "The Satanic Verses"
were damaged by firebombs yes
terday, and the offices of a New
York newspaper that recently de
fended the book were wrecked in
an explosion.
Authorities in both cities said
they weren't sure the bombings
had any connection to the contro
versial novel by Salman Rushdie,
but the owner of Cody's Books in
Berkeley said he had little doubt.
"I can't imagine any other rea
son why people would be lobbing
bombs through bookstores —
Cody's or anyone's," said Andy
Ross.
Molotov cocktails were thrown
through the windows of Cody's,
a Berkeley institution that helped
nurture the Free Speech Move
ment in the 19605, and a Berkeley
outlet of the Waldenbooks chain.
Neither store was badly damaged.
A firebomb seriously damaged
the offices of The Riverdale Press,
a weekly newspaper in the Bronx
that published an editorial last
week defending "The Satanic
Verses."
The novel has outraged Mos
lems throughout the world, and
prompted Iran's Ayatollah Ruhol
lah Khomeini to issue a death or
der for Rushdie and the book's
publishers.
New York fire marshals said
there was "street talk" that the
bombing was retaliation for the
editorial in the Press, which has
a reputation for feistiness and has
twice been nominated for Pulitzer
Prizes for its editorials.
Richard Stein, co-publisher of
the 14,000-circulation weekly,
said he guessed the bombing "had
something to do with something
that was printed in the paper, but
I don't know what."
Connecting it to the editorial
about Rushdie "is nothing but
speculation," he said. "We have
not received any telephone or
written threats. No one has taken
credit for this."
Similarly, the manager of the
Berkeley Waldenbooks, Bob Gam
mon, said he wasn't ready to at

tribute the attack on his store to
the book.
The Berkeley bombings were
reported to police at 4:28 a.m.
One man, Brett Rideout, 44, told
officers he was sleeping in his van
outside Cody's when he heard
crashing glass and a car roar
away.
A bomb squad detonated one
unexploded pipebomb found in
side the store.
Damage at Cody's was limited
to broken glass, a few scorched
book shelves and some damaged

books. Ross said he planned to
leave a charred end case in place
for a while as a reminder of the
incident.
At Waldenbooks, a plate glass
window was broken and a large
circle was burned in the carpet
about five feet from the hole.
Ross estimated damage to his
store at "a few thousand dollars,"
while a glass repairman at Wal
denbooks said replacing the bro
ken window and glass would run
close to $1,000.

Cody's, which is on Telegraph
Avenue about a block from
People's Park, is a local landmark.
Original owner Fred Cody de
signed the store with a corner
setback to allow free speech dem
onstrators in the 1960s to speak
there without being cited for
trespassing on a public street.
Bookstores throughout the
country have been threatened if
they carry the book, but yester
day's bombings were the first in
the United States since the furor
arose over "The Satanic Verses."
