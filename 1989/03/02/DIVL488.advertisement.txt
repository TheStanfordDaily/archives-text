To: Stanford Faculty
From: A. Bienenstock, Chair of Committee on Research
Materials Science & Engineering Department
Subject: Faculty Time Available for Research
Over the past year or so, many faculty have expressed concern about the meager time that
they have available for scholarship. The Committee on Research has considered this situation
briefly and decided that the problem is well worthy of its extended consideration IF it is
widespread. The purpose of this letter is, therefore, twofold. We seek to determine whether a
significant fraction of the faculty is facing this problem and, if so, to determine its sources. We
hope that those of you who are concerned about it will respond.
The Committee has noted that these concerns tend to be stated by senior faculty. It is
possible, therefore, that they are symptoms of a normal process in which senior faculty take
on general university responsibilities and then discover the consequences of that act, rather
than a problem faced by all faculty. For that reason, we are anxious to hear from junior
faculty as well as senior faculty.
POTENTIAL SOURCES OF THE PROBLEM
The Committee has also had an initial discussion on potential sources of the problem, if it
exists. Among the topics considered are:
1. Increases in time writing and following up on research proposals.
2. Increases in time spent on departmental or University fund-raising.
3. Faculty governance.
It has been said that faculty presently spends much more time writing and following up on
proposals than they did in to '50s and '60s. This is due in part to cutbacks in federal research
funding. Some also allege that Stanford's indirect costs rate is a factor.
Similarly, some believe that the University's economic pressures have led to much more
faculty participation in fund-raising at both the departmental and University levels.
It is also possible that we have "done it to ourselves". Some faculty observe that there has
been a profusion of university, school and departmental committees formed since the late '60s
as a result of changing attitudes towards governance of the university. Over this period, both
faculty and student involvement in governance and review of governance has increased
markedly.
The Committee would, therefore, appreciate hearing from faculty who are concerned
about this problem. It is our intention to take the mail volume as an indicator of how
important the problem is. We are also hoping that those that do write will take a little bit of
time to analyze the sources of the problem in their own cases. What would be particularly
helpful would be an analysis of a month or two of academic year time through, say, an
analysis of how time was actually spent or scheduled. Many of us keep pocket calendars
which record appointments. These might be used to identify the sources of the problem.
I realize that asking you to develop a written response might add to your workload. To the
extent you do see this as a serious concern and do not have time to write a more thoughtful
response, please feel free to use the checklist provided below. Responses may be sent to me
by electronic mail addressed to RS.AJBfa FORSYTHE. Alternatively, written material,
should be addressed to me at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, Mail Code
0210, Bin 69.
Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
