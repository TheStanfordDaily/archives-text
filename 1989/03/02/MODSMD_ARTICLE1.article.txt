# Doonesbury creator to speak at Commencement services
## 
### Baldwin Lee Staff writer 
The man who brought us Mike
Doonesbury, Mark Slackmeyer, Zonker
Harris and Roland Hedley will soon
come to campus, but he will most likely
make the trip alone.
Cartoonist Garry Trudeau, creator of
the nationally-syndicated comic strip
"Doonesbury," has been chosen as Stan
ford's 1989 Commencement speaker.
Trudeau's selection, and subsequent
acceptance, was announced to the Com
mencement Speaker Selection Commit
tee yesterday afternoon by Marlene
Wine, special assistant to University
President Donald Kennedy.
According to Senior Class President
Preston Hammer, a committee member,
Trudeau was nominated by the com
mittee partly because he is "widely
known" and is an "expert in his field."
Hammer said the committee also tried
to "pinpoint someone different" than

recent Stanford Com
mencement speakers,
who have been politi
cians or reporters.
Michael Keefe, an ed
itorial cartoonist for the
Denver Post and a
1988-89 Knight Fellow
at Stanford, said yester
day that Trudeau rarely
makes public appear-

ances and his agreement to speak is a
coup for Stanford.
Last year's selection, Oakland
Tribune editor Robert Maynard, ini
tially upset some students who did not
recognize his name.
Besides having name recognition,
Trudeau also was chosen because he is
a creative and humorous person, said
Senior Class President Catherine
Jovicich, another selection committee
member.
Hammer acknowledged that a sense
of humor was a particularly important

quality to offset the "heavy issues"
prevalent at Stanford and in the world
as a whole.
Trudeau, who spoke at Duke Univer
sity's graduation last year, won a Pulit
zer Prize for his comic strip in 1975.
Hammer and Jovicich, two of the four
senior class presidents, said they were
confident Trudeau would excite stu
dents, administrators and faculty.
The speaker committee was com
prised of members from diverse areas
of the University, including two gradu
ate students, two senior class presidents,
the dean of the Chapel, three professors
and two representatives from the Office
of the President.
The committee submitted a list of six
speaker candidates to Kennedy at the
end of last quarter, according to Ham
mer. Kennedy was responsible for final
selection and acquisition of the speaker.
Hammer said that besides working
on "Doonesbury," Trudeau is also cur
rently developing a television show.
