# Computerized election plan to get 2nd chance
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
The plan to computerize this year's
ASSU elections passed another obstacle
yesterday as the ASSU Administration
and Rules Committee voted to recom
mend the proposal to the full ASSU
senate.
However, the committee's decision
was not without reservation. The rec
ommendation of the proposal was con
tingent on two assurances mode by
ASSU Elections Commissioner Steve
Krauss, who framed the proposal.
The original proposal was rejected by
the senate at a meeting two weeks ago,
but Krauss resubmitted a modified pro

posal to the committee yesterday. The
changes include the addition of poll sites
at the Law School, Green Library, the
Post Office and the Clock Tower corner
of the Quad, boosting the number of
poll sites from six to nine.
The full senate will vote on Krauss'
revised proposal at its next meeting on
March 9.
In yesterday's meeting, Krauss
promised to have polling stations at
Meyer and Green libraries open until
10 or 11 p.m. both nights of the election.
Krauss' original proposal planned to
have all polls close by 8 p.m. in order
to tally the results more quickly
Krauss also assured the committee

that the ASSU will own a copy of the
computer program used to collect elec
tion data. The software to be used in
this year's election does not allow the
names of candidates to be changed from
year to year without changing the pro
gram.
Using the system annually will re
quire that it be updated by a program
mer.
Committee-member David Porter, a
graduate student in industrial engineer
ing, mentioned a problem the ASSU had
six years ago when Scantron sheets were
used to tally the election results. Ac
cording to Porter, the software used
then also was not modifiable and could
not be used the following year.
