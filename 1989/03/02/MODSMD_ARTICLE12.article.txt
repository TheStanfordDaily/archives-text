## Witness: North 'assumed worst' 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A retired
general testified at Oliver North's trial
yesterday that he and North decided in
1985 "to assume the worst" — that
North's actions were covered by a law
forbidding official aid to the Nicaraguan
Contras — and to act accordingly.
Earlier in the day, however, Robert
Owen testified that he made many trips
between Washington and Central
America for North, carrying instruc
tions from the presidential aide for how
the guerrilla war was to be fought, and
carrying maps and money.
Owen said North told him he acted
with the knowledge and approval of su
periors. The courier testified at one
point that North said he had President
Reagan's approval, but he said later
that testimony was wrong, that North
never got more specific than "super
iors."
Retired Gen. John Singlaub, an
ardent anti-communist who directed spy
activities in three wars, also testified
he persuaded Taiwan and another Asian
nation — with North's knowledge —
to give $5 million each to the
Nicaraguan Contras but the plan failed
for lack of a required signal from the
U.S. government.

At the time, the Reagan administra
tion was under a Congress-imposed ban,
the Boland Amendment, against helping
the rebels conducting a guerrilla war
against the Nicaraguan government.
The second Asian country was not iden
tified.
Singlaub said he proposed to North
in December 1984 to solicit funds in
the Far East from Singlaub's "close per
sonal friends at high levels sympathetic
to the cause."
"I explained that the policy of the
United States was quite clear, to sup
port the Nicaraguan resistance, and
that Congress* temporary action
stopped us," he testified.
Singlaub, who will return to the wit
ness stand today, was the fourth witness
in the trial which resumed despite
serious, still-unresolved, national secu
rity issues that had halted testimony
for nearly two days.
Defense lawyer Brendan Sullivan has
renewed a motion to declare that a
federal law designed to protect state
secrets from being spilled in the court
room is unconstitutional as applied to
the North case. Sullivan also has asked
that the 12 criminal charges against
North be thrown out.

Yesterday, the government replied
that the process of handling classified
material in court "is not, as North con
tends, a reason to conclude that the
trial is unworkable."
While North's trial continues, one of
the key figures who will testify for the
prosecution, former National Security
Adviser Robert McFarlane, is to be sen
tenced Friday by U.S. District Judge
Aubrey Robinson. He pleaded guilty a
year ago to four misdemeanors involving
withholding information from Congress
about North's activities.
North is accused of lying to Congress
about his activities on behalf of the
Nicaraguan Contras — activities in
which both he and Singlaub were deeply
involved — in the 1984-1986 period
when the Boland Amendment banned
such aid.
"Colonel North said he agreed, but
could not get consensus — some said
it did apply some said it did not,"
Singlaub said. They agreed that "the
best thing was to assume the worst:
that it did apply."
Singlaub said they worked out an ar
rangement under which he would work
with rebel leader Adolfo Calero and keep
North informed.
