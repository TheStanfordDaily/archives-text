# Crackdown on aliens continues
## Govt. trying to breakup smuggling rings that help the illegals

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - U.S. im
migration agents apprehended 27 more
suspected illegal aliens yesterday on a
flight bound for New York City, bringing
to 175 the number detained in a three
day government crackdown.
INS agents, acting on a tip from a
regular commuter on the Piedmont Air
lines flight, were waiting for the 25
males and two females shortly before 7
a.m. during a stopover at Charlotte-
Douglas International Airport.
By 4 p.m., the detainees taken off the
jetliner had been interviewed, fin
gerprinted, photographed and put on a
bus for an Immigration and Naturali
zation Service processing center near
Brownsville, Texas.
The bust was part of a three-day
crackdown against alien smuggling
rings that netted 175 suspected illegal
aliens in Charlotte, Atlanta and Los An
geles, authorities said.
None of the aliens spoke English.
Most of them spent the day sleeping off
the effects of their long ordeal, which

began Monday night in Los Angeles.
According to the INS, the aliens
boarded America West Airlines flight
1277 in Los Angeles at 10 p.m. Monday
night bound for Phoenix. There, they
boarded Piedmont flight 1522 bound for
New York City, with a stopover in Char
lotte.
On Monday, 79 suspected illegal aliens
were apprehended aboard an Eastern
Airlines flight, also bound for New York,
during a stopover in Atlanta. The same
day, 69 others were taken into custody
as they tried to board the same flight
in Los Angeles.
David Carmichael, an INS agent in
Charlotte, said his agency was alerted
by a regular commuter on the Piedmont
flight who had seen television news
reports of Monday's apprehensions â€”
which also had stemmed from a com
muter's tip.
"The source told us he had taken the
same flight on February 15th and he
noticed 30 to 40 people who looked to
him like the same people he saw on the

news," Carmichael said.
Donald Young of the INS's Charlotte
office said one airline official told him
yesterday that smuggling rings have
been moving as many as 30 aliens on
the same Piedmont flight three times
a week for the past several months.
"The publicity we get out of this
might cause it to dry up for awhile,
and force them to change their tactics,"
Young said. "But this isn't going to
stop these people from coming into the
country looking for work."
Carmichael said authorities were
trying to determine whether any of the
27 taken into custody in Charlotte were
part of the smuggling ring.
"We're talking to a couple of them
more than some of the others," he said.
"For example, one had six airline tickets
in his possession when we took him into
custody."
Illegal aliens pay smugglers as much
as $4,000 apiece to get them into the
United States and to a place where they
can find work.
