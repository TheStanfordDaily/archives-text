Capitol Clown
Bozo the Clown saunters down the steps of the Capitol yesterday. America's
favorite clown flew from Chicago to tape a segment of CBS Television's
"Nightwatch," then stopped on Capitol Hill to meet with Illinois Sen. Alan Dixon.
A nearby security guard, obviously used to such sights, stands unfazed.
