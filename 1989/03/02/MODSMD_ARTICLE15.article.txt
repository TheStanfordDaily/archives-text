# Tower acknowledges his marital infidelity

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - John
Tower, his nomination as defense
secretary in grave trouble, made
an extraordinary public admission
of marital infidelity yesterday but
vowed to keep fighting for Senate
confirmation. His prospects
dimmed further, however, by the
Senate mryority leader's opposi
tion.
President Bush continued to
court Democrats in a last-ditch
effort to save the appointment,
and spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
asserted, "We'll just keep up the
good fight."
But Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell further damp
ened Tower's chances by declaring
his opposition, even as Vice Pres
ident Dan Quayle conceded the
administration still lacks the
votes needed for Senate approval.
The president said his appeal
to senators has been, "Look, do
what you've got to do, but re
member fair play, remember
decency and honor and then re
member also historically the con
cept of advise and consent where
reasonable doubt is given histor
ically to the president of the
United States who after all is re

sponsible for the executive branch
of this government."
Bush dispatched Quayle to
Capitol Hill to lobby for the nom
ination.
"We hope the prospects im
prove. We don't have 50 votes yet.
But we're moving in that direc
tion," Quayle told a White House
photo session.
The White House effort failed
with at least one conservative
Democrat, Sen. David Boren of
Oklahoma, who announced his op
position to the nomination and
urged Tower to withdraw. Boren
was one of two Democrats to vote
for former President Reagan's un
popular Supreme Court nominee
Robert Bork.
Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., who
had been invited to a White House
session with Bush, declared his
opposition, saying Tower "is just
not the right person for the po
sition of secretary of defense."
Mitchell announced that floor
debate on the nomination had
been postponed until today as the
ranking members of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., and John Warner,
R-Va., met with White House

counsel C. Boydcn Gray to decide
what material from the FBI
report could be made public.
Tower showed flashes of grit
and humor as he fielded questions
at the National Press Club about
allegations concerning excessive
drinking, womanizing and lucra

tive consulting fees he received
from defense contractors.
Asked whether he had ever bro
ken his wedding vows, the twice
divorced Tower said, "As a matter
of fact, I have broken wedding
vows. I think I am probably not
alone in that connection."
