# Coach put Johnson on steroids in 1981

### 
TORONTO (AP) - Ben
Johnson's track coach testified
yesterday that he turned the
Canadian sprinter on to steroids
in 1981 because their use was
necessary to keep up with the
competition.
Johnson won the gold medal
and set a world record in the 100-
meter race at the Summer Olym
pics in Seoul last year, but was
stripped of both after he tested
positive for steroid use. Johnson
has maintained that he never
knowingly used drugs to enhance
his performance.
But Charlie Francis, who has
been Johnson's coach since 1977,
told a Canadian inquiry into drugs
and sports that he put Johnson
on a steroid program in 1981.
Francis said he first approached
Johnson about steroids that sum
mer, but Johnson "was not sure
of the advantages." That fall,
Francis said, Johnson "decided he
would go on."
"If he wanted to compete, it's
pretty clear that steroids are
worth a meter at the highest level
of sports," Francis said. "I think
he understood that his competi
tors were on them."

Francis' only previous state
ment since the Olympics was that
the sprinter's urine test may have
been sabotaged.
Francis said that top-level in
ternational competition is virtu
ally impossible without steroids.
He cautioned against believing
any claims from top-level athletes
that they are clean and that their
records are the result only of hard
work.
"It just isn't true, not at the
highest, level," Francis said. He
said repeatedly that steroids "are
not a short cut" but the reason
top-level athletes are able to train
as hard as they do.
Francis has been Johnson's
coach since 1977, when the
sprinter was 15.
He said he first worked on
steroid programs with Issajenko
on steroids in 1979 and with
Johnson and fellow runners Desai
Williams and Sharpe in 1981.
The coach said he first consid
ered the "moral dilemma" pre
sented by the use of banned sub
stances international competition.
"You have to decide, is it uni
versally being used out there?"
he said.
