Adams conviction overturned
LOVE LADY, Texas (AP) â€” The man whose
guilt was questioned in the movie "The Thin
Blue Line" had his conviction for the murder of
a police officer overturned yesterday, giving him
hope of freedom after more than 12 years in
prison.
"I have firmly believed someday, some way,
somehow, I would prove my case," Randall Dale
Adams said after learning of the ruling. "I didn't
know how, when or why. I knew."
The appeals court ruled that Adams was denied
a fair trial in 1977 because witnesses lied and
the prosecutor suppressed evidence.
The court ordered Adams transferred from a
state prison to the custody of the Dallas County
sheriff, where he'll be entitled to release on bond,
according to his attorney, Randy Schaffer of
Houston.
Adams, who has steadfastly maintained he is
innocent, is likely to leave state prison after legal
procedures are completed in 15 days, SchafTer
said.
The Dallas County District Attorney's office
will decide in "a short time" whether to retry

Adams for the 1976 shooting of Officer Robert
Wood, said Assistant District Attorney Norm
Kinne.
High winds halt oil spill cleanup
PUNTA ARENAS, Chile (AP) - An oil slick
in Antarctica caused by a Peruvian scientific ship
that ran aground has grown to more than a
half-mile long, and rough weather has hampered
cleanup efforts, the navy reported yesterday.
It was the first indication that the slick from
the Sunday accident, the second in a month in
the region, is more serious than originally
thought. In another report earlier yesterday, the
navy called the oil spill "minor."
Winds reaching up to 80 miles per hour
prevented efforts to right the 1,980-ton Humbolt
and clean up the slick of diesel oil leaking from
two of the ship's fuel tanks, the navy said in a
communique.
Frogmen from the nearby Uruguayan and
South Korean Antarctic stations finally succeeded
yesterday in checking the vessel's hull after
stormy weather prevented them from doing so
for two days.
