SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador
(AP) â€” Leftist rebels yesterday
called the army's unilateral cease
fire "a publicity maneuver" and
said they would accept only a
negotiated truce in the 9-year-old
civil war.
The guerrillas continued fight
ing with an attack on a garrison
town in La Union, the eas
ternmost province. Just before
the army cease-fire was to begin
at midnight Tuesday, rebels at
tacked the Mecafe coffee
processing plant outside Nejapa,
six miles north of San Salvador.
The rebels reported killing 67
soldiers.
"A cease-fire not negotiated be
tween opposing forces is not real,"
said a statement issued by the
rebel general command. "We
demand a serious response from
the government to our com
munique regarding negotiations
in the capital." On Tuesday, the
army said it was declaring a uni
lateral halt in offensive operations
to support a peace proposal Pres

ident Jose Napoleon Duarte made
Sunday night, which included ne
gotiations to be held in Guatemala
City.
Rebel leaders responded to the
Duarte proposal with a demand
that negotiations begin Saturday
in San Salvador because talks
"should be held among and in full
view of all Salvadorans."
Yesterday's statement from the
Farabundo Marti National Liber
ation Front said: "Once we agree
on a date for a meeting in the
capital, we will declare a cessation
of offensive operations.
"We consider that the supposed
unilateral cease-fire of the armed
forces does not halt repression in
the cities, nor does it withdraw
troops from operations in the
countryside. It is a publicity ma
neuver to give the impression of
flexibility."
State Department spokesman
Charles Redman said yesterday in
Washington: "This decision by
President Duarte and the Salva
doran armed forces addresses the

most critical issue, that of bring
ing peace to El Salvador.
"President Duarte recognizes
the crucial fact that violence and
democracy don't mix. We are now
waiting for the guerrillas to dem
onstrate that they are willing to
do the same by ceasing their on
going campaign of terrorism and
assassinations."
There was no government re
sponse to the demand for talks
in San Salvador, for which the
rebel leadership also wants a
broader agenda than the president
suggested.
liuarte, a Christian Democrat,
and the president of the Legisla
tive Assembly discussed prospects
for peace talks yesterday, but
there was no immediate word on
results. The rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance, known as
Arena, controls the legislature.
The guerrillas demand that the
presidential election scheduled for
March 19 be postponed until Sep
tember as a condition of their par
ticipation.
