# Paloma asbestos problem due to a lack of communication
## 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
A lack of communication between
maintenance workers, their supervisors
and Student Housing Officials caused
the asbestos leak on the Paloma House
third floor and the delay in evacuation
of the all-freshman dormitory.
Director of Student Housing Keith
Guy admitted yesterday "we made some
mistakes" when maintenance workers
sawed into a ceiling of a Paloma corridor
known to contain asbestos.
Although officials at the Housing Of
fice knew that asbestos was located in
Paloma, Fred Millard, the supervisor in
charge of the Paloma project, said his

working crew was unaware that the
chemical was present in the dorm.
While students received a University
memo in January warning them of po
tential asbestos hazards, Millard said
his workers were left off the list. Con
sequently, his workers did not expect to
find the material when drilling a hole
into a residential room Jan. 25.
"Asbestos in Paloma was un
beknownst to us. There is no past his
tory of it on Florence Moore (Hall)
ceilings," he said.
However, Guy said Millard and other
maintenance supervisors undergo a
training program which alerts them to
potential asbestos hazards. Workers do
not undergo the same training program.

The two men responsible for the fate
ful work in Paloma had not received
this training, Guy speculated.
Today Guy, Administration Services
Manager Leslie Quintero and Shops
Manager Richard Stevens will meet and
plan strategies to avoid any possible
miscommunication in the future. They
will also discuss ways to train the entire
maintenance staff about asbestos, not
just the supervisors.
However, Millard speculated that his
workers were never forewarned of a
potential asbestos hazard because as
bestos was not thought to be in Paloma.
"Paloma is not a known area of as-
bestos fibers, at least by looking
at it," Millard said. "The color
and the texture are different (than
what asbestos typically looks
like)."
Guy, however, cited an asbestos
survey conducted in 1986 which
he said the workers should have
taken note of. "They are aware
of the survey that the asbestos
information comes from,"he said.
The '86 survey was conducted
of different areas across campus.
Results showed which dormitories
contained asbestos materials.
Students surviving
The students were temporarily
relocated in four areas for the
next two to five days, pending
further testing and cleanup. Four
are living in Hyatt Rickeys Hotel
in Palo Alto at cost to the Uni
versity; 13 are living in Escondido
Village with the resident asistant;
seven made arrangements to live
with friends or relatives.
"The whole process is an
amazing tribute to the reeilly good

attitude of the students," said
Julie Zelenski, Paloma second
floor RA. Describing the emer
gency evacuation, she said, "They
turned a really inconvenient situ
ation into a good one."
At an informational meeting
yesterday at noon, Norm Robin
son, associate dean of Student Af
fairs, said he appreciated how the
students responded to the "dis
ruption in (their) lives."
Third floor residents are cur
rently using the Florence Moore
Residence Office and the RA's
answering machines to stay in
contact with relatives and friends.
Arrangements were made with
Food Service to loan students
plates and silverware, although
they will remain on their Univer
sity meal plans. Robinson joked,
"please return them. I put my
name on them."
Kevin Hartz, one of the stu
dents staying in the hotel, as
sessed the situation. "It's
definitely better than campus
housing. We have HBO, tennis
courts, and we each have a double
bed. I'm hoping to get a lot of
work done this weekend."
