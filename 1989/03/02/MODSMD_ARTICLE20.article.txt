Exactly ios days from
now, seniors will wield a
new type of power — the
choice to give or not to give.
Although graduation is still a
quarter away, Stanford's 1,600
or so seniors have risen to alumni
ranking . . . and the plea for
money is already resonating in
their ears.
The Development Office — the
University's fundraising central
— is now calling on seniors to
join together and make a long
term financial pledge to their
soon-to-be alma mater.
The Senior Pledge asks that
members of the Class of '89
donate volunteer time or $100 by
their fifth-year reunion.
But before members of the
class of '89 get out the checkbook,
they should take a long look
around.
Seniors: Don't sit back and let
high-ranking University bureau
crats decide where to put your
cash. Take some initiative and
question the University's funding
priorities.
Why are those stupid trailers
still standing? Why are room and
board fees skyrocketing when
students still only have three

years of guaranteed housing?
As a class with some clout,
graduating seniors have a chance
to spotlight an undergraduate
problem that other alums just
can't see.
Take advantage of this insight;
make the senior pledge carry
some weight.
Rather than designating your
money for some fuzzy "endow
ment" or "general" fund, the
Class of '89 should pull together
and start its own fund.
Last month, the University
dropped undergraduate housing
from its Centennial Campaign
priority list. And as it now stands,
money for new undergraduate
housing only comes from hikes
in room and board fees.
It's high time for a fund de
signed specifically for undergrad
uate housing — and members of
the senior class should be the
ones to establish it.
Now that they've found a Com
mencement speaker, the four
senior class presidents have time
to direct their energies to a fund
and make the idea fly. Indeed,
Julie Lythcott, one senior class
president, said "That's where I'd
put my money," when The Daily
asked her about the funding idea.
Granted, the fund will start out
small. One hundred dollars from
approximately 1,600 students to
tals $160,000, just a drop in the
bucket when considering the
grand scheme of undergraduate
housing. But a financial gesture
from an outgoing class carries
weight.
Bound for real-world experi
ences, seniors no longer face the
dread of drawing into Manzanita
Park. But by pledging their
money to a special fund, the class
of '89 will walk out with a mes
sage: Undergraduate housing
does matter.
