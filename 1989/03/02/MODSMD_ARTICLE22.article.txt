## Too big for their genes 
### 
BRACE YOURSELVES. The people
who brought us the $2.8 billion
Hanford Reservation nuclear dis
aster are about to bring us the human
genome.
The federal government — led by the
Department of Energy — has decided to
launch a $3 billion project to catalogue
the entire human genetic library. It's a
good idea, but today's political and fiscal
realities make it a bad use of available
resources.
The DOE decided that it would be the
perfect lead agency to supervise a massive
and very expensive project to sequence
the genome. The largely uncreative, grind
it out, University-of-Nebraska-football
style science on which the project will
ultimately depend seems to be right up
the DOE's road.
But intellectual rationale for Depart
ment of Energy supervision of a biology
project are hard to come by.
The National Institutes of Health are
now also involved and are already build
ing what will probably be a better pro
gram than DOE's to sequence the
genome. But the project as a whole will
still take too big a slice of the biotech
nology budget and may deeply hurt
private research institutions such as
Stanford.
First, scientists do not need to plow
through the entire genome to identify
interesting or important genes. Lots of
scientists in different laboratories can do
the genome piece by piece as need arises,
just as they are doing today. This way
they can assemble a picture of the genome

without a massive, federal sequencing
program.
So instead of spending $3 billion on
one project — as the DOE plan seems
to advocate — it makes more sense to
spend the money on a wide range of
experiments in molecular genetics and to
let the genome get sequenced as a side
effect. There is no pressing national need
to have it done right now.
Second, the attractiveness of the
genome project rests on the assumption
that Congress will appropriate extra
money for it — that giving money to the
genome project will not take money away
from anywhere else.
This assumption is naive. In an era of
Gramm-Rudman and the Flexible Freeze,
the chances that the feds will spend an
extra few billion on molecular biology are
slim. Congress is far more likely to juggle
pre-existing resources than to create new
ones.
The people who will be hurt most di
rectly by this centralized, bureaucratic
allocation of research dollars are the
young professors at private research in
stitutions — such as Stanford — who
will be forced to compete for an increas
ingly smaller pool of grant funding.
Within a decade, the DOE's big gene
sequencing center will be operating on a
scale at least 100 times larger than most
biology labs at Stanford. That's a lot of
money that will have to come from some
where; chances are good that it will come
from here.
Just as people will probably lose, so
will projects. Scientists do not yet under
stand the control of gene expression, for

example, an issue of enormous medical
and industrial applicability. Unfortunate
ly, you can probably slow it down for a
while if the genome project gets fired up.
Third, the premise behind the human
genome project — namely, that cen
tralized, federal control of basic research
is necessary and beneficial — is both
wrong and dangerous.
Yes, we do need increased coordination
of interdisciplinary work, and we should
reward scientists for joint ventures with
industry and government. But we should
let the pace and nature of science itself
dictate where we put our money and not
throw it around by fiat at whatever the
current sound-good fad of the Washington
power elite happens to be.
The human genome project could be a
success; but odds are it will be a failure.
At its worst and most primitive, it has
the feel of a Soviet-style five-year-plan
for biological science.
Although the project could create im
portant tools and discover important
knowledge, the allocation of resources
towards this project and away from
smaller, Stanford-style labs threatens the
young biologists whom America will need
to compete in the next century's biotech
nology race.
