CAPS and Bridge
both needed, and
aren't competing
As one of the founders of the Bridge
and the principal trainer and continu
ing consultant, I am aware of space
allocation requests and decisions being
made approximately every five years
over the 18 years that I have been
associated with the Bridge and the
University.

I am disquieted on this occasion to
be experiencing a strident tone in the
relationship between the Student Or
ganization Services and the Bridge
community.
I also want to say as a staff psychia
trist at the Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services, and former director, that
the relationships between the profes
sional mental health providers at CAPS
and the peer counselors at the Bridge
have generally been good; that the peer
counselors in no way see themselves as
a substitute for, or in competition with
the professional work of the CAPS
staff members and furthermore;
that the Bridge counselors have
enough training and common sense to
refer students requiring highly profes
sional skills to CAPS on a fairly regu
lar basis.

The article of Feb. 21 in The Daily
seemed to set up a competition be
tween the professional and paraprofes
sional groups. I can assure you that
there is no such competition and that
overall a state of mutual respect exists
between helping groups on campus.

Closing of Israeli
campus leaves gap
in a crucial field

In Stanford's Overseas Studies Of
fice, students can get buttons encour
aging them to "go away". Two years
ago I took this advice and went away
to Stanford's program in Israel.
Stanford's Israel program was a
unique educational experience. Its
small size allowed great flexibility to
participating Stanford students. During
my year in Israel, I studied Hebrew
and Arabic, as well as Middle Eastern
history and politics, at Haifa Universi
ty. I also lived with a family in an
Arab village and worked on a kibbutz.
The Stanford program challenged me
to think about the world in a new
way.
Now, Stanford has decided to close
its campus in Israel. Unbelievably,
Stanford has decided to discourage its
students from studying the Middle
East at a time when that region is
growing in importance.
Stanford does not exist in a vacuum.
It should encourage its students to
away and study other cultures. I hope
Stanford reconsiders its decision to
close its Israel campus.

Moslem law should
not supersede the
West's secular law
I am writing in response to Syed
Mustafa Ashraf s Feb. 28 letter in
which he describes the pain caused to
Moslems by Salman Rushdie's book,
"The Satanic Verses." I disagree very,
strongly with many of the points Ash
raf makes, and I think he misun
derstands the anger expressed in the
West over the Moslem reaction to
Rushdie's book.
Ashraf claims that "The Satanic
Verses" is a blasphemy against the
most sacred of Islamic beliefs and that
Rushdie should be extradited to a Mos
lem country for trial. That "The
Satanic Verses" is a blasphemy may
very well be true, since nearly the
entire Moslem world says so, but that
is not really the point as far as the
West is concerned.
The point is that religious leaders
are calling for Rushdie's punishment
despite the fact that he has broken no
secular law. Does Ashrah really think
that it is wise for secular governments
to let religious institutions punish
people who offend them?
Should rock groups be tried and
punished by people who don't like
their music? Should evolutionary
biologists be turned over to fundamen
talist preachers for trial and punish
ment?
The West has eryoyed a fairly long
tradition of the separation of church
and state, and the idea of tossing
Rushdie over to Iran to be punished
by religious authorities is clearly ab
surd.
Ashraf argues that since Rufthdie is
a Moslem, he should subscribe to Is
lamic law and be tried in a Moslem
country. What Ashraf fails to realize is
that it is not the British government's
responsibility to play the part of

Rushdie's conscience.
Rushdie himself may decide he wants
a Moslem trial and voluntarily turn
himself over, but it is absurd to as
sume that the British government
should get involved in a religious dis
pute. In fact, it is the government's job
to make sure that Rushdie is protected
from harm and allowed to freely
publish whatever he wants.
I am particularly disturbed by Ash
rafs final paragraph, in which he says,
"Salman Rushdie has committed an
atrocity and crime of unimaginable
pain and suffering to millions all over
the world," and should be hunted down
like the "Hitler junta." This compari
son is ridiculous: Hitler was responsi
ble for the deaths of millions of people.
All Rushdie has done is write an offen
sive novel which practically no Moslem
has read.
The Islamic reaction to "The Satanic
Verses" reminds me of the 15th Cen
tury Roman Catholic reaction to what
was perceived as blasphemy â€” "Burn
the heretic!" Unfortunately, killing the
heretics serves only to corrupt the
ideals the killers claim to hold, as
Christianity learned during the
Reformation.

Verses" reminds me of the 15th Cen
tury Roman Catholic reaction to what
was perceived as blasphemy â€” "Burn
the heretic!" Unfortunately, killing the
heretics serves only to corrupt the
ideals the killers claim to hold, as
Christianity learned during the

CAPS and Bridge
both needed, and
aren't competing
As one of the founders of the Bridge
and the principal trainer and continu
ing consultant, I am aware of space
allocation requests and decisions being
made approximately every five years
over the 18 years that I have been
associated with the Bridge and the
University.

I am disquieted on this occasion to
be experiencing a strident tone in the
relationship between the Student Or
ganization Services and the Bridge
community.
I also want to say as a staff psychia
trist at the Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services, and former director, that
the relationships between the profes
sional mental health providers at CAPS
and the peer counselors at the Bridge
have generally been good; that the peer
counselors in no way see themselves as
a substitute for, or in competition with
the professional work of the CAPS
staff members and furthermore;
that the Bridge counselors have
enough training and common sense to
refer students requiring highly profes
sional skills to CAPS on a fairly regu
lar basis.

The article of Feb. 21 in The Daily
seemed to set up a competition be
tween the professional and paraprofes
sional groups. I can assure you that
there is no such competition and that
overall a state of mutual respect exists
between helping groups on campus.

Closing of Israeli
campus leaves gap
in a crucial field

In Stanford's Overseas Studies Of
fice, students can get buttons encour
aging them to "go away". Two years
ago I took this advice and went away
to Stanford's program in Israel.
Stanford's Israel program was a
unique educational experience. Its
small size allowed great flexibility to
participating Stanford students. During
my year in Israel, I studied Hebrew
and Arabic, as well as Middle Eastern
history and politics, at Haifa Universi
ty. I also lived with a family in an
Arab village and worked on a kibbutz.
The Stanford program challenged me
to think about the world in a new
way.
Now, Stanford has decided to close
its campus in Israel. Unbelievably,
Stanford has decided to discourage its
students from studying the Middle
East at a time when that region is
growing in importance.
Stanford does not exist in a vacuum.
It should encourage its students to
away and study other cultures. I hope
Stanford reconsiders its decision to
close its Israel campus.

Moslem law should
not supersede the
West's secular law
I am writing in response to Syed
Mustafa Ashraf s Feb. 28 letter in
which he describes the pain caused to
Moslems by Salman Rushdie's book,
"The Satanic Verses." I disagree very,
strongly with many of the points Ash
raf makes, and I think he misun
derstands the anger expressed in the
West over the Moslem reaction to
Rushdie's book.
Ashraf claims that "The Satanic
Verses" is a blasphemy against the
most sacred of Islamic beliefs and that
Rushdie should be extradited to a Mos
lem country for trial. That "The
Satanic Verses" is a blasphemy may
very well be true, since nearly the
entire Moslem world says so, but that
is not really the point as far as the
West is concerned.
The point is that religious leaders
are calling for Rushdie's punishment
despite the fact that he has broken no
secular law. Does Ashrah really think
that it is wise for secular governments
to let religious institutions punish
people who offend them?
Should rock groups be tried and
punished by people who don't like
their music? Should evolutionary
biologists be turned over to fundamen
talist preachers for trial and punish
ment?
The West has eryoyed a fairly long
tradition of the separation of church
and state, and the idea of tossing
Rushdie over to Iran to be punished
by religious authorities is clearly ab
surd.
Ashraf argues that since Rufthdie is
a Moslem, he should subscribe to Is
lamic law and be tried in a Moslem
country. What Ashraf fails to realize is
that it is not the British government's
responsibility to play the part of

Rushdie's conscience.
Rushdie himself may decide he wants
a Moslem trial and voluntarily turn
himself over, but it is absurd to as
sume that the British government
should get involved in a religious dis
pute. In fact, it is the government's job
to make sure that Rushdie is protected
from harm and allowed to freely
publish whatever he wants.
I am particularly disturbed by Ash
rafs final paragraph, in which he says,
"Salman Rushdie has committed an
atrocity and crime of unimaginable
pain and suffering to millions all over
the world," and should be hunted down
like the "Hitler junta." This compari
son is ridiculous: Hitler was responsi
ble for the deaths of millions of people.
All Rushdie has done is write an offen
sive novel which practically no Moslem
has read.
