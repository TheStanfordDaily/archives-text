## Lichti the Legend: a one in 376 kind of player 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
"A total of 376 players have let
tered in men's basketball at Stan
ford dating back to 1913-14. . .a
strong case could be made that
senior guard Todd Lichti is better
than the other 375, including
more than a few of them put to
gether. "
— Pacific 10 Conference 1988-89
Men's Basketball Media Guide
That was written before this
season began.
Since that time, Todd Lichti has
established himself as a legitimate
candidate for All-America honors
at guard, and is officially one of
the 10 finalists for the Associated
Press Player-of-the-Year award.
Earlier this season, the Los An
geles Times balked at the thought
that Todd Lichti is the greatest
player in Stanford basketball his
tory. Or, the Times said, had we
forgotten Hank Luisetti, who still
holds the record for points in a
game (50) and is credited with
inventing the jump shot and/or
the one-handed shot.
Undoubtedly, Luisetti is the
most influential basketball player
in Stanford annals, if not in all
of college basketball history, for
adding a new dimension to the
game much the way Babe Ruth
blazed the home-run trail in base
ball.
But at tonight's home finale
against USC, the 7,500-plus fans
will be bidding goodbye to six
players: Bryan McSweeney, Scott
Meinert, Eric Reveno, Terry
Taylor, Howard Wright. . .
And, unequivocally, the greatest
player in Stanford basketball his
tory.
"I just want to be the best player

1 can be, make it into the pros. I
guess be an All-American, but be
an Ail-American on a winning
team."
Todd Lichti (Feb. 4, 1986)
Modest goals.
Lichti holds 11 Stanford
records: career and season points,
career field-goais made and at
tempted, career and season 3-
point field-goal percentage, career,
season and game free throws
made, single game field-goal and
free-throw percentage, and con
secutive free throws made.
Lichti is currently the all-time
scoring leader in Pacific-10 Con
ference games.
Lichti will become only the
third four-time all-conference se
lection in Pac-10 history.
This remarkable player, who
will be a first-round selection in
the NBA draft this summer, has
been accused of being too unsel
fish.
Lichti has been plenty selfish,
and never more than this season.
He wants a winning team. He's
getting what he wants.
Reporter: "Is there a question you
have not been asked'?"
Lichti: "No."
The 6-foot-4, 205-pound Con
cord, Calif, native has answered
all of them.
He has answered them with
cannon-like baseline drives —
swinging the ball with both hands
in an arc like the hypnotist bring
ing a subject to peaceful slumber,
then exploding across the endline,
feinting to the left and right, and
then laying it in with whatever
hand isn't waving bye-bye to the
faked-out defender.
He has answered them with
sky-high, tear-down rebounds in

traffic, taking the ball from
players as much as half-a-foot tal
ler.
He has answered them at the
familiar free-throw line, and the
answers have been echoed by the
Maples crowd. Swish. . . .whoosh.
Swish. . .whoosh. Swish. . .
whoosh.
He has answered them with a
quick dribble (parry) and then a
dead-eyed 3-point jumper
(thrust).
He has answered them with a
hug of Howard Wright on the
Maples floor, Feb. 3, 1988, when

Stanford beat No. 1 Arizona.
With 34 points in the opening
round of the NIT last year against
Long Beach State, with 27-
second-half points in this year's
win over Arizona, with a game
winning buzzer-beater against
Washington, Lichti has put the
questions to rest.
Who is Todd Lichti?
Sometime, in the age when
roadway gridlock is replaced by
skyway airlock and there's a fax
machine in every household, when
the Jetsons seem more like the
Flintstones and there is enough

campus housing and office space
for everyone, a player may walk
across the floor of Stanford's new
17,000-seat basketball arena with
more talent and ability than Todd
"The God" Lichti.
Maybe that day isn't so far off;

maybe Stanford's recruiting will
continue to feel the legacy of Todd
Lichti after he is gone.
But whether recruiting im
proves or not, Todd Lichti is the
standard by which all Stanford
basketball players, past and fu
ture, will be measured.

Since that time, Todd Lichti has
established himself as a legitimate
candidate for All-America honors
at guard, and is officially one of
the 10 finalists for the Associated
Press Player-of-the-Year award.
Earlier this season, the Los An
geles Times balked at the thought
that Todd Lichti is the greatest
player in Stanford basketball his
tory. Or, the Times said, had we
forgotten Hank Luisetti, who still
holds the record for points in a
game (50) and is credited with
inventing the jump shot and/or
the one-handed shot.
Undoubtedly, Luisetti is the
most influential basketball player
in Stanford annals, if not in all
of college basketball history, for
adding a new dimension to the
game much the way Babe Ruth
blazed the home-run trail in base
ball.
But at tonight's home finale
against USC, the 7,500-plus fans
will be bidding goodbye to six
players: Bryan McSweeney, Scott
Meinert, Eric Reveno, Terry
Taylor, Howard Wright. . .
And, unequivocally, the greatest
player in Stanford basketball his
tory.
"I just want to be the best player

1 can be, make it into the pros. I
guess be an All-American, but be
an Ail-American on a winning
team."
Todd Lichti (Feb. 4, 1986)
Modest goals.
Lichti holds 11 Stanford
records: career and season points,
career field-goais made and at
tempted, career and season 3-
point field-goal percentage, career,
season and game free throws
made, single game field-goal and
free-throw percentage, and con
secutive free throws made.
Lichti is currently the all-time
scoring leader in Pacific-10 Con
ference games.
Lichti will become only the
third four-time all-conference se
lection in Pac-10 history.
This remarkable player, who
will be a first-round selection in
the NBA draft this summer, has
been accused of being too unsel
fish.
Lichti has been plenty selfish,
and never more than this season.
He wants a winning team. He's
getting what he wants.
Reporter: "Is there a question you
have not been asked'?"
Lichti: "No."
The 6-foot-4, 205-pound Con
cord, Calif, native has answered
all of them.
He has answered them with
cannon-like baseline drives —
swinging the ball with both hands
in an arc like the hypnotist bring
ing a subject to peaceful slumber,
then exploding across the endline,
feinting to the left and right, and
then laying it in with whatever
hand isn't waving bye-bye to the
faked-out defender.
He has answered them with
sky-high, tear-down rebounds in

traffic, taking the ball from
players as much as half-a-foot tal
ler.
He has answered them at the
familiar free-throw line, and the
answers have been echoed by the
Maples crowd. Swish. . . .whoosh.
Swish. . .whoosh. Swish. . .
whoosh.
He has answered them with a
quick dribble (parry) and then a
dead-eyed 3-point jumper
(thrust).
He has answered them with a
hug of Howard Wright on the
Maples floor, Feb. 3, 1988, when

Stanford beat No. 1 Arizona.
With 34 points in the opening
round of the NIT last year against
Long Beach State, with 27-
second-half points in this year's
win over Arizona, with a game
winning buzzer-beater against
Washington, Lichti has put the
questions to rest.
Who is Todd Lichti?
Sometime, in the age when
roadway gridlock is replaced by
skyway airlock and there's a fax
machine in every household, when
the Jetsons seem more like the
Flintstones and there is enough

campus housing and office space
for everyone, a player may walk
across the floor of Stanford's new
17,000-seat basketball arena with
more talent and ability than Todd
"The God" Lichti.
Maybe that day isn't so far off;

maybe Stanford's recruiting will
continue to feel the legacy of Todd
Lichti after he is gone.
But whether recruiting im
proves or not, Todd Lichti is the
standard by which all Stanford
basketball players, past and fu
ture, will be measured.

Stanford guard Todd Lichti takes it to the hole en route to scoring
once again, and adding to his Stanford career record point total.
"A total of 376 players have let
tered in men's basketball at Stan
ford dating back to 1913-14. . .a
strong case could be made that
senior guard Todd Lichti is better
than the other 375, including
more than a few of them put to
gether. "
