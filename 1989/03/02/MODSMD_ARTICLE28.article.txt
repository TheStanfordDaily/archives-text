# Rising volleyball spikes down Gauchos in 3 straight
## 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
And then there were two. Atop the Western In
tercollegiate Volleyball Association that is.
Last night, the Stanford men's volleyball team,
riding an awe-inspining, 46-kill performance by
team captain Scott Fortune, calmly and coolly dis
carded the feeble challenge issued by the visiting
UC-Santa Barbara Gauchos.

Men's Volleyball
Cardinal 3, Gauchos 0

In a match that many, including Stanford coach
Fred Sturm, had expected to go the full five games,
Stanford crushed the Gauchos in only three. The
Cardinal coasted in the first two games, winning
15-10 and 15-5, and then outlasted UCSB, 20-18,
in a marathon-like third game.
By beating the Gauchos, Stanford successfully
defended both its recently garnered No. 2 national
ranking and its share of the WIVA league lead.
Stanford and UCLA have one loss each in league
play; UCSB and Hawaii now both have three losses
apiece.
In game one of last night's match, it appeared
as if Stanford would once again be slow getting out
of the gate, a trend that has plagued the Cardinal
all season. Santa Barbara jumped out to a 4-1 lead,
and the Cardinal faithful on hand at Maples began

to shift uneasily in their "seats.''"But*' the Oaucho
run was promptly stifled, as Stanford ran off 13 of
the next 15 points to be scored.
Stanford struggled a bit, though, in putting the
Gauchos away in game one; the Cardinal's 14-6 lead
was whittled to 14-10 before game point was finally
tallied. Due to its strong finish in game one, Santa
Barbara carried some momentum into the next
game, once again jumping out to an early three
point lead.
However, the Cardinal was able to halt this quick
start as well. This time, Stanford did not make the
slightest delay in climbing all over the hapless
Gauchos; Stanford swept through the rest of game
two in almost flawless fashion, winning 15-5.
Game three was an entirely different story; the
two squads reversed roles at the outset. This game,
Stanford jumped out to an early 5-2 lead, but UCSB
was able to keep things close until mid-game.
With the score favoring the Cardinal by a 7-5
margin, Stanford served, and UCSB's Jose Gandara
was promptly roofed by last week's WIVA player
of the week, Dan Hanan. With the score at 8-5,
the raucous Stanford fans began to smack their
lips, sensing the imminent three-game sweep of the
Gauchos. However, the Gauchos were not quite will
ing to throw in the towel.
Santa Barbara fought back to a 13-13 deadlock.
From that point, twenty-five minutes would pass
before a winner would be declared. Both squads
staved off game point after game point (seven in
all) before Santa Barbara finally succumbed. The

fatal blow was dealt by Stanford freshman Duncan
Blackman, who hit off the blockers to win the game,
20-18.
Duncan Blackman, who seems to have Santa Bar
bara's number this season, not only notched the
game-winning kill but also tallied a solid 16 kills

for the match.
Blackman attributed his success to the overall
team preparation. "We were pretty pumped up for
these guys," Blackman said. "(Scott) Fortune had
us going hard in warm-ups, and, as a result, we
were ready right from the start."

Scott Fortune came three kills short of the Maples Pavilion record when he recorded 46 in only three
games last night, including an incredible 24 in the final game as Stanford topped UC-Santa Barbara.
