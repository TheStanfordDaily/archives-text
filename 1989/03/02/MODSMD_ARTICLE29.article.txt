# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
The best-laid plans sometimes go astray.
Over the course of the year, The Daily Sports
staff has endeavored to spread the wealth
when bestowing Athletes of the Week
honors. When possible, benefit of the doubt
has been given to those who have not yet
won.
This week, however, the choices were crys
tal clear. For the second and third time,
respectively, Jennifer Azzi and Howard

Wright have been dubbed Athletes of the
Week.
Azzi, a 5-foot-7 guard from Oak Ridge,
Tenn., passed two individual milestones over
the weekend as she led the No. 4 Cardinal
over Oregon and Oregon State, the third
and fourth-place teams in the Pacific 10
Conference.
With her 12 points and eight assists
against the Beavers Friday, Azzi earned her
I,oolst career point and 500 th assist. Adding
her team-high 20 points and eight assists
the next night, the junior ranks eighth on
the Stanford scoring list and retains a com
manding lead on the assist chart.
Stanford now is 22-2 overall on the season,
14-0 in Pac-10 play. With one win this week
end in Arizona, the Cardinal will clinch a
tie for the team's first conference title ever,
while a pair of victories would give Stanford
sole claim to the crown.

Wright, a 6-8 forward from San Diego, is
also swimming in acclaim. For his perform
ances at USC last Monday and Oregon and
Oregon State over the weekend, the senior
was named Pac-10 Player of the Week.
Against the Trojans, Wright scored 18
points and recorded a career-high four blocks
as he guided Stanford to a 68-52 victory in
Los Angeles. He followed by tallying 19 of
the Cardinal's 54 points at Oregon.

But Wright's most significant contribution
came in the Oregon State game, a contest
that could have gone either way. With his
20 points on 10-for-13 shooting and a season
high 10 rebounds, Wright secured Stanford
a 60-58 win.
The Cardinal, ranked 13th on the latest
Associated Press poll, is now a firm second
in the Pac-10 at 14-3, 23-5 overall.
