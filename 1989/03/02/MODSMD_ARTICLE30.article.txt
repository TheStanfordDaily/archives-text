# Heroes playing with the wrong ballclub

### 
It was one of the most horrible
days of my life.
Cincinnati's Pete Rose, my
idol since I could say his name,
had left for the enemy.
Upon arrival in the Bay Area,
were you force-fed so much gar
bage about the Niners that you
grew to hate them? Well, my
neighbor never ceased to tell me
how great the Phillies were, so I
grew to hate them. And now my
idol was a member of the Philadel
phia Phillies.
I remember Mom commenting
that I was mourning so much I
should be wearing black. I felt
cheated. Betrayed. Shattered.
Crushed. And just plain sad.
Mr. Red was a Red no more,
and there was nothing I could do
about it.
Losing an idol is the most help
less feeling in the world. I couldn't
cheer for Pete because that would
be cheering for the enemy, and
there was no way I could give my
neighbor — who also was my good
friend — that satisfaction.
All of Pete's actions that I had
emulated on the little league field
were now detestable. I hated when
he slammed the ball down afler
the final out of the inning. I hated
when he sprinted to first after a

walk. I hated the head-first slides.
I hated the familiar knee-bent
crouch at the plate.
I'll never forget my disgust dur
ing the 1980 World Series. The
Phillies were in trouble against
the Kansas City Royals, and Pete
stepped to the plate.
The rules say you must make
an attempt to get out of the way
of a pitched ball coming at any
part of your body. Pete saw the
ball was headed for his leg and
shifted his weight so it ricocheted
off the side of his shin.
He took a few steps directly
towards the mound before
heading off to first in a sprint,
throwing his bat manacingly
aside. I never hated Pete more
