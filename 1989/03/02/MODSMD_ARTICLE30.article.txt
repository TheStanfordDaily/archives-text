# Heroes playing with the wrong ballclub
## 
### 
It was one of the most horrible
days of my life.
Cincinnati's Pete Rose, my
idol since I could say his name,
had left for the enemy.
Upon arrival in the Bay Area,
were you force-fed so much gar
bage about the Niners that you
grew to hate them? Well, my
neighbor never ceased to tell me
how great the Phillies were, so I
grew to hate them. And now my
idol was a member of the Philadel
phia Phillies.
I remember Mom commenting
that I was mourning so much I
should be wearing black. I felt
cheated. Betrayed. Shattered.
Crushed. And just plain sad.
Mr. Red was a Red no more,
and there was nothing I could do
about it.
Losing an idol is the most help
less feeling in the world. I couldn't
cheer for Pete because that would
be cheering for the enemy, and
there was no way I could give my
neighbor — who also was my good
friend — that satisfaction.
All of Pete's actions that I had
emulated on the little league field
were now detestable. I hated when
he slammed the ball down afler
the final out of the inning. I hated
when he sprinted to first after a

walk. I hated the head-first slides.
I hated the familiar knee-bent
crouch at the plate.
I'll never forget my disgust dur
ing the 1980 World Series. The
Phillies were in trouble against
the Kansas City Royals, and Pete
stepped to the plate.
The rules say you must make
an attempt to get out of the way
of a pitched ball coming at any
part of your body. Pete saw the
ball was headed for his leg and
shifted his weight so it ricocheted
off the side of his shin.
He took a few steps directly
towards the mound before
heading off to first in a sprint,
throwing his bat manacingly
aside. I never hated Pete more


ROBERT PORTNOY
than at that moment. The irony
was that this same act, per
petrated only a year before, would
have invoked squeals of delight.
Of course, this particular story
has a happy ending. After leading
the Phillies to a world title, Pete
returned to the Reds, the rightful
place for his dismissal of Ty
Cobb's record for base hits in a
career.
Want to know the greatest ter
ror in all of this? I see the poten
tial for reliving that horrible day.
Think of your favorite player
in college basketball. If you're any
kind of Stanford fan, it's Todd
Lichti. Now think of him in the
pros. A nice thought, huh? It is
a nice thought, until you realize
that Todd Lichti is within a draft
choice or two of becoming a Bos
ton Celtic.
Yes, the man whom you've
grown to love through four won
derful years could end up wearing
Celtic green.
You know how Todd seems to
be moving several paces ahead of
everyone on the floor? Well, think
of those fleet and agile feet in
lime green basketball shoes. They
don't look so Mercurian anymore,
do they?
Conjure up all the images of
Danny Ainge, the most detestable
ex-Celtic of all, whining over a
bad call in a game that's already

decided. Do you really want Todd
to be a part of this?
Now think of Todd in the open
court. He's as graceful as any
player you've ever seen. He can
dunk from almost any position,
and he fills the lanes impeccably.
What act in the NBA would most
suit such a player?
Showtime. That's right, the
World Champion Los Angeles
Lakers. Needless to say, Todd
would flourish in the Lakers'
open-court style of play. And L.A.
could use another jump-shooter
for its set offense.
Ah, but this just a fantasy. The
harsh reality is that Todd may be
Celtic.
Right now, the NBA draft order
would give Boston the tenth pick.
Granted, that is a little higher
than most experts project Lichti
will be chosen. But I think Todd
may surprise the experts and go
a little higher than 12th or 13th,
two numbers that have been
tossed around. And then there's
the Larry Bird factor. With Bird
back in the lineup, the Celts may
cease to be the worst playoff team
in the league, which is what they
would be now.
If the Celtics improve a little
through the final 27 games of
their season, they could injure
their draft position just enough
to place them in the Lichti zone.
I shiver at the thought. Todd,
don't do it. Demand a trade. Bet
ter yet, tell them you won't sign
so they don't even bother to draft
you.

Seriously, Todd, could you
stand to play 41 games a year in
a building that smells like Red
Auerbach's cigars? Did you know
you'll lose 10 inches on your verti
cal leap if you wear those lime
green sneakers?
Don't put on the green, Todd.
I might have to wear black again.

were you force-fed so much gar
bage about the Niners that you
grew to hate them? Well, my
neighbor never ceased to tell me
how great the Phillies were, so I
grew to hate them. And now my
idol was a member of the Philadel
phia Phillies.
I remember Mom commenting
that I was mourning so much I
should be wearing black. I felt
cheated. Betrayed. Shattered.
Crushed. And just plain sad.
Mr. Red was a Red no more,
and there was nothing I could do
about it.
Losing an idol is the most help
less feeling in the world. I couldn't
cheer for Pete because that would
be cheering for the enemy, and
there was no way I could give my
neighbor — who also was my good
friend — that satisfaction.
All of Pete's actions that I had
emulated on the little league field
were now detestable. I hated when
he slammed the ball down afler
the final out of the inning. I hated
when he sprinted to first after a

walk. I hated the head-first slides.
I hated the familiar knee-bent
crouch at the plate.
I'll never forget my disgust dur
ing the 1980 World Series. The
Phillies were in trouble against
the Kansas City Royals, and Pete
stepped to the plate.
The rules say you must make
an attempt to get out of the way
of a pitched ball coming at any
part of your body. Pete saw the
ball was headed for his leg and
shifted his weight so it ricocheted
off the side of his shin.
He took a few steps directly
towards the mound before
heading off to first in a sprint,
throwing his bat manacingly
aside. I never hated Pete more


ROBERT PORTNOY
than at that moment. The irony
was that this same act, per
petrated only a year before, would
have invoked squeals of delight.
Of course, this particular story
has a happy ending. After leading
the Phillies to a world title, Pete
returned to the Reds, the rightful
place for his dismissal of Ty
Cobb's record for base hits in a
career.
Want to know the greatest ter
ror in all of this? I see the poten
tial for reliving that horrible day.
Think of your favorite player
in college basketball. If you're any
kind of Stanford fan, it's Todd
Lichti. Now think of him in the
pros. A nice thought, huh? It is
a nice thought, until you realize
that Todd Lichti is within a draft
choice or two of becoming a Bos
ton Celtic.
Yes, the man whom you've
grown to love through four won
derful years could end up wearing
Celtic green.
You know how Todd seems to
be moving several paces ahead of
everyone on the floor? Well, think
of those fleet and agile feet in
lime green basketball shoes. They
don't look so Mercurian anymore,
do they?
Conjure up all the images of
Danny Ainge, the most detestable
ex-Celtic of all, whining over a
bad call in a game that's already

decided. Do you really want Todd
to be a part of this?
Now think of Todd in the open
court. He's as graceful as any
player you've ever seen. He can
dunk from almost any position,
and he fills the lanes impeccably.
What act in the NBA would most
suit such a player?
Showtime. That's right, the
World Champion Los Angeles
Lakers. Needless to say, Todd
would flourish in the Lakers'
open-court style of play. And L.A.
could use another jump-shooter
for its set offense.
Ah, but this just a fantasy. The
harsh reality is that Todd may be
Celtic.
Right now, the NBA draft order
would give Boston the tenth pick.
Granted, that is a little higher
than most experts project Lichti
will be chosen. But I think Todd
may surprise the experts and go
a little higher than 12th or 13th,
two numbers that have been
tossed around. And then there's
the Larry Bird factor. With Bird
back in the lineup, the Celts may
cease to be the worst playoff team
in the league, which is what they
would be now.
If the Celtics improve a little
through the final 27 games of
their season, they could injure
their draft position just enough
to place them in the Lichti zone.
I shiver at the thought. Todd,
don't do it. Demand a trade. Bet
ter yet, tell them you won't sign
so they don't even bother to draft
you.

Seriously, Todd, could you
stand to play 41 games a year in
a building that smells like Red
Auerbach's cigars? Did you know
you'll lose 10 inches on your verti
cal leap if you wear those lime
green sneakers?
Don't put on the green, Todd.
I might have to wear black again.

It was one of the most horrible
days of my life.
Cincinnati's Pete Rose, my
idol since I could say his name,
had left for the enemy.

were you force-fed so much gar

grew to hate them? Well, my
