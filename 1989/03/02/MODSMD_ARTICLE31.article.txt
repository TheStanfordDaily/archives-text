# Wrestlers ninth in Pac 10: Buddie, Yarbrough to NCAAs
## 
### Greg Gottesman Staff writer 
Stanford wrestlers Steve Buddie and
Steve Yarbrough will be spending part
of Dead Week in Oklahoma. Yet, neither
will be wrestling with physics, calculus
or anything academic. Rather, each will
be shooting for the title of "All-
American," a distinction that has not
been attained by a Cardinal wrestler
for three years.
Indeed, the performances of Buddie
and Yarbrough highlighted Stanford's
ninth place finish at the Pacific 10 Con
ference/Western Regionals last weekend
at Arizona State.
"I was glad that two of the three
guys we hoped to qualify actually did,"
Stanford Coach Chris Horpel said. "Our
next goal is to get one or both of them
to place in the top eight at the NCAAs

and be named All-American."
To qualify for the NCAA Champion
ships, to be held March 16-19 in Okla
homa City, wrestlers had to place in the
top three of their weight class at the
Pac 10s or be one of the six wild card
selections. In addition, a grappler must
place in the top eight at the NCAAs to
receive the honor of All-American.
Yarbrough (wrestling in the 167-
pound weight division), who was seeded
first in the Pac 10 and was ranked
eighth in the nation, finished fourth at
the tournament. He immediately was
chosen as one of the six wild card se
lections. Buddie (177), on the other
hand, was seeded fourth and finished
third.
"Going in, I expected to be seeded
higher," Buddie said. "By bumping off
a guy who was supposedly a higher seed,
however, I was able to live up to the

expectations that I had set for myself.
You might say I proved something to
the other coaches, wrestlers and to
myself."
Junior Ron Perry (190), who along
with Yarbrough and Buddie finished the
dual meet season undefeated, placed
sixth in the Pac 10s but did not make
it into the NCAAs.
"He needed to have a great day, and
he only had an average one," Horpel
said. "Ron has had some injuries this
year. It is too bad that just when he
started to get going again, he lost in
the Pac 10s. Sometimes it just works
out that way."
Other Stanford wrestlers in the Pac
10s included Dave Nowick (118), Mark
Forman (126), Josh Lisle (134), James
Dinette (142), Geoff Baum (150), Matt
Nowlis (158) and Trent Smith
(heavyweight).
