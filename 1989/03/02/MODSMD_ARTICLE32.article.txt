### 
TORONTO (AP) - Ben
Johnson's track coach testified
Wednesday that he turned the
Canadian sprinter on to steroids
in 1981 because they were "worth
a meter" in competition and
everyone else was doing it.
Charlie Francis told a Canadian
inquiry into drugs and sports that
he first approached Johnson that
summer about steroids, but he
"was not sure of the advantages."
That fall, Francis said, Johnson
"decided he would go on."
"If he wanted to compete, it's
pretty clear that steroids are
worth a meter at the highest level
of sports," Francis said.
"I think he understood that his
competitors were on them."
Johnson, who lost his Olympic
100-meter gold medal and world
record after testing positive for
steroids in Seoul, has maintained

that he never knowingly used
drugs to enhance his performance.
Francis' only previous statement
since the Olympics was that the
sprinter's urine test may have
been sabotaged.
Francis said after he put
Johnson on a steroid program in
1981, the drugs were later ad
ministered by his personal
physician, Dr. Jamie Astaphan.
Asked if he saw the doctor inject
Johnson with steroids, Francis
replied, "On occasion, yes."
Astaphan, who has promised to
travel to Toronto from his home
in the Caribbean to testify, has
denied he gave the drug to
Johnson.
In hour after hour of detailed
testimony on the use of anabolic
steroids and growth hormones,
Francis said that at an early stage,
champion woman sprinter Angella

Taylor Isstyenko injected Johnson
and fellow sprinter Tony Sharpe
while the two men injected Is
styenko with a growth hormone.
Francis said that top-level in
ternational competition is virtu
ally impossible without steroids.
In his second day of testimony
he cautioned against believing any
claims from top-level athletes that
they are clean and that their
records are the result only of hard
work.
"It just isn't true, not at the
highest level," Francis said. He
said repeatedly that steroids "are
not a short cut" but the reason
top-level athletes are able to train
as hard as they do.
Francis has been Johnson's
coach since 1977, when the
sprinter was 15.
