## Softball takes a doubleheader 
### Libby Feil Staff writer 
Stanford women's Softball
had a doubleheader last week
end against Hartnell College at
Salinas and came away with
double victories. In both games
the final score was 8-3.
The Cardinal was down 0-3
in the first game until the sixth
inning, when the players came
back to score four in the sixth
and four more in the seventh
inning to eke out a win. Katie
Voth, Terri Silliman, and Nancy
Tillapaugh all went two for four
in the game, and Minerva
Turado and Ellen Tauber were
key players as well.
The second game went more
smoothly for the Stanford wom
en. The team had a total of 18
hits, with Barcy Fisher and Sil
liman each hitting triples and
Silliman also getting three RBI.
In addition, Voth, Tauber, and
Kate Saldutti all pitched in to
help.
The women's softball team's
next home game will be against
Menlo College on March 8 at 3
p.m. at El Camino Field across
from the Stanford Shopping
Center.
Skiing
Last weekend Stanford's al
pine, or downhill, ski team com
peted at the National Collegiate
Ski Association Regionals at
Mammoth Mountain. The entire
women's team qualified for Na
tionals March 6-10 at Incline
Village, as did men's captain Bill
Derwin.
The teams both participated
in one slalom and one giant
slalom race each. In the wom
en's slalom, Sarah Pike, Cathy
Petcold, and Jennee Richmond
finished third, 10th, and 13th
respectively. Pam Smul, Pike,
and Richmond then came in
fourth, fifth, and 20th in the
giant slalom. Their combined
scores were good enough to
move the team into the second
and final qualifying spot behind
Nevada-Reno.
The men's team raced well

also. By virtue of Derwin's
eighth and Brandon Lattin's
ninth in the slalom and Der
win's ninth and Brad Swett's
13th in the giant slalom, as well
as a few other lower platings,
the men's team was able to place
third overall. Unfortunately,
this third was just out of the
qualifying placings. One individ
ual skier, however, was chosen
to go to Nationals out of the
eight teams that did not qualify
to send their squads to Tuhoe,
and Derwin was picked to fill
this slot.
Cycling
Stanford's cycling team
traveled south to Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo last weekend to
compete in one of the season's
most prestigious — and also
most challenging — meets. In
two days the cyclists endured
three grueling races against the
best collegiate cyclists in Cali
fornia.
Saturday's first race was a
short and flat time trial that
required the riders to "ham
mer" or power their way for
five miles.
Bob Borchers was the Cardi
nal's highest A finisher in this
event, placing sixth. Stanford's
Ken Zimmerman, who was cho
sen as Palo Alto Bike's Athlete
of the Week, came in fourth.
In the women's events, Car
dinal cyclist Tasha Brubaker
won the A event and Stanford's
Stephanie Page placed third in
the B category. Three Stanford
men also placed in the C and D
categories.
Later that day the racers par
ticipated in a demanding road
race over the same course upon
which last year's National Col
legiate Championships were
held.
The men's A road race was
"the highlight of the weekend"
for Stanford, Captain Steve Mil
ler said, because "everything
came together."
All six of Stanford's A riders
— Miller, Tom Moyer, Borchers,
Art Walker, Brian Sterling, and
Jason Tavakolian — placed in

the top 20, with Miller beating
out two competitors from rival
schools in the final sprint to take
first.
In the B race, Zimmerman
again put the competition to
shame by winning. Two Stan
ford cyclists also placed in the
D division. "It was a real turn
around from two years
ago.. .when UC-Santa Barbara
just crushed us" on the same
course, captain Vit Henisz said.
Liz Moyer was the highest
finisher for Stanford in the
women's A division with a tenth
place finish. In the B category
Becky Wigglesworth took
seventh.
In Sunday's criterium, "We all
scored, but we all didn't score
enough points," Miller ex
plained.
The team's next race is at
Sonoma State in two weeks, and
it will once again be sending all
of its riders in an attempt to
score an overall victory in the
races.
Rugby
Stanford's men's rugby team
played against the University of
San Francisco's newly formed
squad last weekend in a non
conference game. The Cardinal
defeated USF 33-10.
The Stanford ruggers scored
two tries right away to start
them out at an advantage. "Un
fortunately, we let up" after
that, captain Bill Bradford said.
At halftime the score was 8-6,
only two points in Stanford's
favor.
In the second half, however,
the reliable Cardinal players
came to life. Chris Meyn, Tony
Loffredo, and Simon Fleming-
Wood were all instrumental in
the victory.
On Saturday the rugby team
has a league game against San
Jose State scheduled for 1 p.m.
at Maloney Field.
"They're really big and phys
ical," Bradford said, "but I think
we can match them physically."
The team needs to win its next
three league games, including
this one, to stay in contention
for playoffs.

traveled south to Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo last weekend to
compete in one of the season's
most prestigious — and also
most challenging — meets. In
two days the cyclists endured
three grueling races against the
best collegiate cyclists in Cali
fornia.
Saturday's first race was a
short and flat time trial that
required the riders to "ham
mer" or power their way for
five miles.
Bob Borchers was the Cardi
nal's highest A finisher in this
event, placing sixth. Stanford's
Ken Zimmerman, who was cho
sen as Palo Alto Bike's Athlete
of the Week, came in fourth.
In the women's events, Car
dinal cyclist Tasha Brubaker
won the A event and Stanford's
Stephanie Page placed third in
the B category. Three Stanford
men also placed in the C and D
categories.
Later that day the racers par
ticipated in a demanding road
race over the same course upon
which last year's National Col
legiate Championships were
held.
The men's A road race was
"the highlight of the weekend"
for Stanford, Captain Steve Mil
ler said, because "everything
came together."
All six of Stanford's A riders
— Miller, Tom Moyer, Borchers,
Art Walker, Brian Sterling, and
Jason Tavakolian — placed in

the top 20, with Miller beating
out two competitors from rival
schools in the final sprint to take
first.
In the B race, Zimmerman
again put the competition to
shame by winning. Two Stan
ford cyclists also placed in the
D division. "It was a real turn
around from two years
ago.. .when UC-Santa Barbara
just crushed us" on the same
course, captain Vit Henisz said.
Liz Moyer was the highest
finisher for Stanford in the
women's A division with a tenth
place finish. In the B category
Becky Wigglesworth took
seventh.
In Sunday's criterium, "We all
scored, but we all didn't score
enough points," Miller ex
plained.
The team's next race is at
Sonoma State in two weeks, and
it will once again be sending all
of its riders in an attempt to
score an overall victory in the
races.
Rugby
Stanford's men's rugby team
played against the University of
San Francisco's newly formed
squad last weekend in a non
conference game. The Cardinal
defeated USF 33-10.
The Stanford ruggers scored
two tries right away to start
them out at an advantage. "Un
fortunately, we let up" after
that, captain Bill Bradford said.
At halftime the score was 8-6,
only two points in Stanford's
favor.
In the second half, however,
the reliable Cardinal players
came to life. Chris Meyn, Tony
Loffredo, and Simon Fleming-
Wood were all instrumental in
the victory.
On Saturday the rugby team
has a league game against San
Jose State scheduled for 1 p.m.
at Maloney Field.
"They're really big and phys
ical," Bradford said, "but I think
we can match them physically."
The team needs to win its next
three league games, including
this one, to stay in contention
for playoffs.
Stanford women's Softball
had a doubleheader last week
end against Hartnell College at
Salinas and came away with
double victories. In both games
the final score was 8-3.
The Cardinal was down 0-3
in the first game until the sixth
inning, when the players came
back to score four in the sixth
and four more in the seventh
inning to eke out a win. Katie
Voth, Terri Silliman, and Nancy
Tillapaugh all went two for four
in the game, and Minerva
Turado and Ellen Tauber were
key players as well.
The second game went more
smoothly for the Stanford wom
en. The team had a total of 18
hits, with Barcy Fisher and Sil
liman each hitting triples and
Silliman also getting three RBI.
In addition, Voth, Tauber, and
Kate Saldutti all pitched in to
help.
The women's softball team's
next home game will be against
Menlo College on March 8 at 3
p.m. at El Camino Field across
from the Stanford Shopping
Center.
Skiing
Last weekend Stanford's al
pine, or downhill, ski team com
peted at the National Collegiate
Ski Association Regionals at
Mammoth Mountain. The entire
women's team qualified for Na
tionals March 6-10 at Incline
Village, as did men's captain Bill
Derwin.
The teams both participated
in one slalom and one giant
slalom race each. In the wom
en's slalom, Sarah Pike, Cathy
Petcold, and Jennee Richmond
finished third, 10th, and 13th
respectively. Pam Smul, Pike,
and Richmond then came in
fourth, fifth, and 20th in the
giant slalom. Their combined
scores were good enough to
move the team into the second
and final qualifying spot behind
Nevada-Reno.
The men's team raced well

also. By virtue of Derwin's
eighth and Brandon Lattin's
ninth in the slalom and Der
win's ninth and Brad Swett's
13th in the giant slalom, as well
as a few other lower platings,
the men's team was able to place
third overall. Unfortunately,
this third was just out of the
qualifying placings. One individ
ual skier, however, was chosen
to go to Nationals out of the
eight teams that did not qualify
to send their squads to Tuhoe,
and Derwin was picked to fill
this slot.
