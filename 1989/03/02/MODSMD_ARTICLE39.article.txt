## 
### Jay Bhattacharya Staff writer 
The Stanford police are on the
track of an unidentified prowler
who has terrorized women living
in residences on campus three
times within the last two weeks.
The prowler was spotted
peeping into houses in the faculty
residential area between 3 a.m.
and 6 a.m. on Feb. 20, 24 and
28, according to Captain Raoul
Niemeyer of the Stanford Police
Department. In one of the inci
dents, the prowler actually entered
a residence, he said.
Niemeyer said that none of the
women, who were alone at the
time of the incidents, were hurt
by the prowler nor was anything
stolen. He warned, however, that
another prowler attack is likely
in the near future.
"This is a case of what we call
a 'hot prowler* — someone who

is really actively prowling, always
on the prowl," Niemeyer said.
The police department refused
to release the names of the
prowler victims.
The prowler has been described
by victims as a white male be
tween 16 and 25 years of age,
between 5 feet 9 inches and 6 feet
tall, and wearing army boots with
a waffle sole.
Although no dorms have been
involved, police believe the
suspect is familiar with the Stan
ford area. "There has been no
report of similar incidents from
surrounding areas, so clearly res
idences near Stanford are at risk,"
Niemeyer said.
Niemeyer encouraged anyone
with further information to con
tact the police department at 723-
9633. "No progress has been made
on this case since the last inci
dent," he said.
