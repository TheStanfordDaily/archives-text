# Computer Science Department: driving, or driven by, industry?

Close ties with Silicon Valley computer
companies may have placed Stanford's
Computer Science Department deep in
the pocket of private businesses bent on
reaping benefits from the University's
renowned computer researchers.
Or does Stanford have complete control
over the businesses it associates with?
The answer, according to some Uni
versity officials and members of industry,
is that no one dominates the relationship.
University researchers and private com
panies often associate only if there is a

good match in interests and available re

The relationship between Stanford's
Computer Science Department and
private computer companies is a two-way
street, rewarding to both sides.
Many businesses believe the acquisi
tion of technology through joint research
with the University can benefit immedi
ate corporate earnings and the long-run
health of a company.

Of course, the University gets its fair
share of benefits. Besides shelling out
plenty of money, businesses often donate
expensive equipment and lend personnel
in order to participate in research here.
The partnership between the Computer
Science Department and industry cer
tainly involves big money. For example,
Hewlett-Packard Co. announced last
Thursday that it would donate $2.4 mil
lion towards a new computer research
facility to be built here.
"The influence of private companies on
Stanford is not a substantial concern,"
said Provost James Rosse. "We are suc
ceeding in convincing many companies

of our position on this.
"The problem is setting an academic
agenda independent of private companies'
agendas in terms of research," he said.
"The pressure will always be there,
though."
This pressure is especially strong be
cause private businesses link up with the
Computer Science Department in a huge
variety of ways ranging from formal
agreements to personal contacts.
Computer Forum access
One of the most formal and widely
used methods by business to gain access

to University research is through a Uni
versity organization known as the Com
puter Forum.
The forum hosts a biannual program
in which representatives from industry
meet with Stanford faculty and research
ers to exchange the latest technological
information. Each company must pay
$13,500 per year to join the forum,
though the figure is lower for smaller
companies.
Forum director Carolyn said the
University received $1.3 million in fees
last year from businesses that joined the
