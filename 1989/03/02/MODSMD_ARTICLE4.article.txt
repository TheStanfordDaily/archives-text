# Computer Science Department: driving, or driven by, industry?

### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
Close ties with Silicon Valley computer
companies may have placed Stanford's
Computer Science Department deep in
the pocket of private businesses bent on
reaping benefits from the University's
renowned computer researchers.
Or does Stanford have complete control
over the businesses it associates with?
The answer, according to some Uni
versity officials and members of industry,
is that no one dominates the relationship.
University researchers and private com
panies often associate only if there is a

good match in interests and available re
sources.
The relationship between Stanford's
Computer Science Department and
private computer companies is a two-way
street, rewarding to both sides.
Many businesses believe the acquisi
tion of technology through joint research
with the University can benefit immedi
ate corporate earnings and the long-run
health of a company.

Of course, the University gets its fair
share of benefits. Besides shelling out
plenty of money, businesses often donate
expensive equipment and lend personnel
in order to participate in research here.
The partnership between the Computer
Science Department and industry cer
tainly involves big money. For example,
Hewlett-Packard Co. announced last
Thursday that it would donate $2.4 mil
lion towards a new computer research
facility to be built here.
"The influence of private companies on
Stanford is not a substantial concern,"
said Provost James Rosse. "We are suc
ceeding in convincing many companies

of our position on this.
"The problem is setting an academic
agenda independent of private companies'
agendas in terms of research," he said.
"The pressure will always be there,
though."
This pressure is especially strong be
cause private businesses link up with the
Computer Science Department in a huge
variety of ways ranging from formal
agreements to personal contacts.
Computer Forum access
One of the most formal and widely
used methods by business to gain access

to University research is through a Uni
versity organization known as the Com
puter Forum.
The forum hosts a biannual program
in which representatives from industry
meet with Stanford faculty and research
ers to exchange the latest technological
information. Each company must pay
$13,500 per year to join the forum,
though the figure is lower for smaller
companies.
Forum director Carolyn said the
University received $1.3 million in fees
last year from businesses that joined the
forum.
In addition, the forum supports
a "visiting employee" program
whereby corporations can send
employees to Stanford to take
classes and participate in a pro
fessor's research. The cost is
$40,000 per employee per year.
The forum indirectly plays
"matchmaker," too. Tsynai said
many businesses sponsor individ
ual faculty research projects after
being introduced to researchers
through the forum.
Tajnai said she would like to
see more businesses participate in
the forum to counteract the
federal government's large-scale
funding of research that exercises
a great deal of influence on Stan
ford.
Consortium connections
Another means of exchanging
information and equipment is
through consortiums. Like the
Computer Forum, consortiums
facilitate meetings between re
searchers from different univer
sities and industry personnel, but
in this case businesses solicit
memberships from schools.
Joint research agreements can
be made through consortiums. In
1984, Stanford agreed to purchase
Macintosh computers through the

Apple University Consortium,
with Apple agreeing to discount
the price, according to Michael
Carter, former director of systems
development at Academic Infor
mation Resources.
"The number of consortiums is
longer than your arm," said Ira
Machefsky, a Digital Equipment
Corporation employee who or
ganizes research out of his office
in Sweet Hall using University
resources and funding from Dig
ital.
He readily admits the purpose
of his work here is the "augmen
tation of DEC's own internal re
search," but that Stanford
benefits greatly by receiving
grants from and exchanging in
formation with Digital's research
laboratories.
Machefsky's status here is typ
ical in that it is atypical. He ob
tained his position here five years
ago without help from the forum
or from a consortium.
Independent agreements be
tween Stanford's computer users
and the multitude of hi-tech cor
porations are common, and they
usually occur when industry and
faculty exchange information and
determine they have matching
needs in certain fields of computer
research, he said.
"It's not like Stanford is out on
the street soliciting help from in
dustry," Machefsky said. "If any
thing Stanford has a 'take it or
leave it' attitude."

According to Assoc. Chairman
of Computer Science George
Wheaton, some businesses have a
penchant for doing business with
Stanford because of past ties with
the University. For example, he
said, the owners of Mountain
View-based Sun Microsystems
and Palo Alto-based Hewlett-
Packard all attended Stanford.
Stanford's prestige also helps
attract support from industry, ac
cording to many industry offi
cials.
"Stanford has little trouble in
getting the money it needs be
cause of the high qualifications
of the researchers and staff," said
Lawrence Rogers of HP Labs.
Who has upper hand?
With the prestige and resources
the University commands, it ap
pears that Stanford computer
users have the upper hand in de
cisions concerning the creation of
joint research projects here.
But some worry that once busi
nesses become anchored on
campus, they may begin to com
mand much influence of their
own, like in the case of HP's pro
posed research lab.
At last Thursday's Faculty Sen
ate meeting, several professors ex
pressed concern that because the
new facility is only sponsored by
one private company, HP will
have a monopoly on private-sector
influence over the lab.

Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy said that having more
than one company contribute to
the research center would "protect
the University from the imputa
tion that it is being influenced by
any one corporate entity."
No formal action has been taken
by the Faculty Senate, but Rosse
said these concerns were valid.
He told The Daily that the Uni
versity intends to seek agreements
with other companies to help fund
the facility.
The NeXT connection
Another company that appears
to be pulling some weight at Stan
ford is NeXT Corporation of Palo
Alto, the latest brainchild of
former Apple co-founder Steven
Jobs.
When the company recently de
veloped a unique new computer,
it invited two universities, Stan
ford and Carnegie-Mellon Univer
sity, to invest in its development,
according to NeXT employee Al
lison Thomas.
Stanford received a shipment of
NeXT machines when they were
first introduced. The company
plans to develop the machines on
college campuses because "higher
education is the most demanding
customer," said Thomas.
"Universities are a group with
diverse needs who are interested
in state-of-the-art machines."
Carter, who now works for

NeXT, said companies also donate
hardware to universities because
they want to get the equipment
into the hands of students, who
may purchase them when they
graduate and may even decide to
work for the company.
This quarter the Computer Sci
ence Department is offering a
course called "Software Develop
ment on the NeXT Computer"
taught by Ali Ozer and Paul
Hegarty, both of whom obtained
a master's degree in computer sci
ence from Stanford in 1987 and
are now NeXT employees.
Roy Jones, lecturer in computer
science, said the name of the
course is a misnomer because the
course does not emphasize devel
oping programs for NeXT. In
stead, it focuses on "object
oriented user-interface program
ming," or finding ways to write
programs that are most compat
ible with the way humans create
things.
He said the this course utilizes
the NeXT because it is the best
available machine for doing
object-oriented programming.
Jones says the department plans
to change the name of the course
when it is offered again.
Regardless of NeXT's, or any
company's, intentions for intro
ducing technology — in the form
of computers, funding, laborato
ries and personnel — it is obvious
that in the short run both parties
benefit from the relationship.
