## Hot Stuff

Forbidden fruits
They're one of the more goofy looking chamber or
chestras around, but also one of the best. This Sunday at
2:30 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium you can check out the
Apple Hill Chamber Players in concert.
This cello/violin/piano/another violin/viola/another
piano/double bass septet (septut? septuplets? September?)
has for years been a favorite around the country, playing
both 18th- to 20th-century masterpieces and new and com
missioned works by leading American composers.
Their Stanford performance will feature Mozart's Diver
timento for Stnng Quartet, K. 138; Mahler's Piano Quartet;
the Bay Area premiere of Thomas Oboe Lee's Piano Quintet;
and Schumann's Piano Quintet in E-Flat Major, Opus 44,
Bill the Cat 38. Tickets are available at the Tresidder
Ticket Office and all BASS ticket outlets.
Museum for the rest of us

arms broken off and paintings by people with weird names
like Lenny and Vinny? If so, check out the Cartoon Art
