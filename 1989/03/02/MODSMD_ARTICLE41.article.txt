# How KZSU picks its discs
## Like other college radio stations, KZSU takes pride in its diverse musical tastes. But is anybody out there listening?

Co-music director Natalie Bccrer
thumbs her way through the al
bums in the aging Memorial Au
ditorium basement home of
KZSU. From the hundreds of
records on the crowded shelves of
the station's music library, she ran
domly picks one.
"This Kim Fields record, for ex
ample, is one that we couldn't
play," she says. "She played Tutti
on the 'Facts of Life/ remember?
The record companies send us a
lot of stuff like this. I think we
played it once because it was fun
ny, but not regularly, it's just so

annoying.
The plenum of records like this
one filling KZSU's shelves repre
sents major label attempts to break
their newest prodigy through the
reliable medium of college radio
stations like Stanford's student
run radio station at 90.1 on the
FM dial. Thus, the task for KZSU
is pleasing the musical tastes of a
diverse audience while still main
taining some degree of integrity.
"We get a lot of good stuff;
there's a lot of garbage too. But it
has to be pretty bad for us to to
throw it away/' says Bcercr.
Indeed, this courtship of college
radio by record labels is less phi

lanthropic than profit-motivated.
For the last few years college radio
has supported die meek beginnings
of many groups (REM, U2, The
Smithereens) which were originally
disparaged but now embraced by
commercial radio.
At KZSU, the decision of what
type of music to program involves
the conflict between record com
panies vying for exposure of their
new artists, what the students who
run KZSU want to play, what the
Stanford community wants to
hear, and what a college radio sta
tion should be.
