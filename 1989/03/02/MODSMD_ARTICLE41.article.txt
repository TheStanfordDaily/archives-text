# How KZSU picks its discs
## Like other college radio stations, KZSU takes pride in its diverse musical tastes. But is anybody out there listening?

Co-music director Natalie Bccrer
thumbs her way through the al
bums in the aging Memorial Au
ditorium basement home of
KZSU. From the hundreds of
records on the crowded shelves of
the station's music library, she ran
domly picks one.
"This Kim Fields record, for ex
ample, is one that we couldn't
play," she says. "She played Tutti
on the 'Facts of Life/ remember?
The record companies send us a
lot of stuff like this. I think we
played it once because it was fun
ny, but not regularly, it's just so

annoying.
The plenum of records like this
one filling KZSU's shelves repre
sents major label attempts to break
their newest prodigy through the
reliable medium of college radio
stations like Stanford's student
run radio station at 90.1 on the
FM dial. Thus, the task for KZSU
is pleasing the musical tastes of a
diverse audience while still main
taining some degree of integrity.
"We get a lot of good stuff;
there's a lot of garbage too. But it
has to be pretty bad for us to to
throw it away/' says Bcercr.
Indeed, this courtship of college
radio by record labels is less phi

lanthropic than profit-motivated.
For the last few years college radio
has supported die meek beginnings
of many groups (REM, U2, The
Smithereens) which were originally
disparaged but now embraced by
commercial radio.
At KZSU, the decision of what
type of music to program involves
the conflict between record com
panies vying for exposure of their
new artists, what the students who
run KZSU want to play, what the
Stanford community wants to
hear, and what a college radio sta
tion should be.

Like other college radio stations,
most music played on KZSU will
not be found on commercial air
waves. The mere names of bands
like "Fluid," "Psycho Tribe," and
"That Petrol Emotion" make main
stream programmers shy away in
fear. This gives college radio a more
avant-garde aspect, says Beerer, an
undeclared junior, who decides
with co-music director Mike Sacco,
a senior majoring in psychology,
which artists to play within the
new-music format.
"We definitely have more variety
than commercial stations because
college radio has been the only
avenue for new and interesting
groups. I think it has something
to do with the college student men
tality. It's just music you're not
going to hear everywhere else."
With all the freedom given to
KZSU disc jockeys, there is one
universal requirement — the play
ing of records selected by the music
director. DJs are required to play
three cuts an hour from albums
in the 'A' file, as it's called. This
may contain the latest releases
from new-music groups like "The
Smiths" and the "Cocteau Twins"
to metallists such as "Anthrax"
and "Metallica." The DJ picks the
remainder of the music by himself
with the help of listeners' phone
calls.
A listener's request at KZSU
stands a good chance of being
played, especially if it's new and
exciting, old and different, or just
different. There are exceptions,
though. "One time a guy wanted
a whole side of live Grateful Dead,"
Beerer recalls. "That's 30
MINUTES. Our format is loose,
but not that loose."
Similarly, requests for the latest
top-10 single normally don't make
the air. "We couldn't play Bon Jovi,
for example," she said. "For one,
we don't have the album because
record companies know we won't
play it, and two, it's getting too
much exposure already."
This is vastly different from
commercial stations' policies,
where, according to program direc
tor Brad Adelberg, "10 other people
have to request the same song to
get it played."

KSZU's format, which is chosen
by Adelberg, a senior in electrical
engineering, is not restricted to
new music. Each day is divided
into three-hour segments, each
devoted to a different type of
music, an informational program,
or something completely different
(like Wednesday Night Live, when
local bands play live in the studio).
Reggae and heavy metal selections
are played as well as jazz, classic
rock and alternative — the three
main musical divisions of the day
at KZSU.
What does this breadth indicate
about KZSU? Mostly, it shows that
KSZU is run by music fans, not
snobs. Some college stations refuse
to play a group once it appears on
mainstream playlists, even though
the stations themselves had a large
part in breaking in the group in
the first place. KZSU, says Adel
berg, doesn't take the radical ap
proach other stations do. "We don't
disown a band once they make it,
but we don't play their single that's
being played everywhere else; we
play other stuff from that artist."
"A lot of stations won't do that,
though, they thrive on discovering

the artist and refuse to play it if
it comes out anywhere else. It leads
to a certain musical snobbery at
those stations."
But K7SU is not an anomaly
compared to other alternative col
lege stations, says Beerer. "Judging
from the College Music Journal's
New Music Report [a monthly
publication tracldng what's being
played on college stations] and
other stuff, I'd say we're pretty
much on track.There are some col
lege stations that are pretty main
stream, some that are way out
there. I'd say we're somewhere in
the middle."
This leads to the question of
whether or not anyone is listening,
a difficult one to answer because
of the nonexistence of a ratings
system. The station doesn't have
to make audience demographic
reports because its survival doesn't
depend on revenue from adver
tisers, hence the ability to target
a smaller cross-section than the
mainstream audience.
They depend, however, on Stan
ford students for three-fourths of
their financial support. There have
been attempts to determine the di

mensions of the audience. Five
years ago, a survey was distributed
to Stanford students asking their
opinions on what KZSU should
play, and how often it should be
played.
While they don't measure the
number of listeners, requests offer
some indication of where KZSU's
listeners are and what they want
to hear. Adelberg says the KZSU
listenership is not restricted to the
campus or even Palo Alto.
"We get quite a few requests
from Oakland and Berkeley, a good
number from the East Bay, and a
few high school age listeners."
The station has a "reasonable"
number of campus listeners, he
said, and "we're really interested
in how many Stanford students
are listening because that's who
we are trying to please.
"There is some amount of
criticism of the station from stu
dents — I mean, all the Gaieties
jokes about 'weird music,' — but
a lot of it comes from the fact that
people don't know what they'll
hear when they turn on the radio."

KZSU disc jockey Keith Lohkamp spins some platters for his faithful following. This particular record
is Brendan Babb's "My Baby's Rhinoplasty."
Restricting the format to one
style of music or another will not
eradicate the criticism, says Adel
berg. "The more alternative we
went, the fewer Stanford students
we'd have, as far as I'm concerned,
because there are a lot of different
tastes on campus."
Perhaps the best testament of
the station's aim to please a diverse
audience is not musical, but the
broadcast of news and Stanford
sports. Very few college stations,
according to Adelberg, broadcast
sports because of the same musical

snobbery that makes it hard for
them to play an artist that has
become a commercial phenome
non.
"The DJ's at some other stations
will play anything that hasn't been
heard before for the feeling of dis
covering an artist. Our DJ's play
songs that they want to hear and
that they think other people will
like.
"Our goal isn't to educate our
listeners about different styles of
music, it's to give people the op
portunity to listen to a lot of music
they wouldn't hear elsewhere. We
play classic rock, for instance, that
you won't hear elsewhere. It's a
public service, in a sense."
