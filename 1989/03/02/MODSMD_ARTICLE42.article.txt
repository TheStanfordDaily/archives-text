# Air travel now safer than swimming with sharks, sometimes

Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen
and welcome to the departure lounge for
PSA-USAir-TWA-R.J. Reynolds-Nabisco
flight 321 with scheduled service to Palm
Springs, Los Angeles and San Diego, and
unscheduled service to the Pacific Ocean.
At this time we would like to invite
anyone needing special assistance, pas
sengers traveling with small children or
passengers who arc acting like small
children to pre-board the aircraft. We will
begin general boarding momentarily.
(45 momentary minutes later)
We will be boarding the aircraft today
by row numbers starting from the rear
and working our way forward logarithmi
cally. At this time, all passengers in rows
one, 10, 100 and 1000 may board the
aircraft.
(Inside the airplane)
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen
and welcome aboard flight 321. Please
direct your attention to the flight atten
dants who will point out the safety features
of this aircraft. Take a moment to study
the safety information card which you will
find in the seat-back pocket in front of
you. There will be a test after we take off.
This aircraft is equipped with nine exits
â€” two over each wing, two each at the

front and rear of the aircraft and one to
be determined later when a huge hole
mysteriously appears in the side of the
airplane. Each exit is equipped with in
flatable slides. If you are traveling with
John Tower, each exit is also equipped
with an inflatable doll.

The Ayatollah
Khomeini can also be
used as a flotation
device.

Because this flight will be operating par
tially over water, and perhaps under it as
well, you will find a life jacket beneath
your seat. In the unbelievably unlikely
event of a water landing, the life jacket
will keep you afloat long enough for the
sharks to eat you. Please do not inflate
your life jacket until exiting the airplane
or else you will look really silly. Your scat
cushion can also be used as a flotation
device.
This aircraft is pressurized for your com
fort. In the incomprehensibly unlikely
event of a sudden cabin depressurization

it will feel as though all of John Tower's
girlfriends are sitting on your stomach. If
this occurs, oxygen masks will drop from
the overhead compartment, as if by magic.
To start the flow of oxygen pull down
sharply on the mask, although not so hard
that it comes off. Place the mask firmly
over your nose and mouth and breath
normally (snicker), as if you can breath
"normally" when you are about to crash
into the ocean. If you are traveling with
small children, first secure your mask and
then assist them, if they are still breathing.
If they are not still breathing, they can
be used as flotation devices.
To fasten your scat belt insert the metal
tab into the buckle until it clicks. To
release the seat belt, lift up on the metal
handle on top of the buckle. For those of
you having trouble with the seat belt, there
will be a special review section offered
this Thursday in room 200-232 of the
History corner at 7:30 p.m.
(After take-off)
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking. We are cur
rently climbing through 21,000 feet to our
final cruising altitude of 35,000 feet. To
put that number into perspective, you
would have to stack 140,000 copies of
"The Satanic Verses" on top of one another

to rcach that height.
Our flying time today will be approxi
mately one hour and 25 minutes. To put
that number into perspective, it would
take John Tower the same amount of time
to drink Ayatollah Khomeini under the
table and steal his wives.
The Ayatollah Khomeini can also be
used as a flotation device.
(At the final cruising altitude)
Ladies and gentlemen the captain has
turned off the no-smoking sign. Those of
you sitting in the rows which arc the
natural logarithm of six times pi may now

smoke. Smoking is not permitted in the
lavatories or in those little bathrooms.
The captain has also turned off the
fasten seat belt sign, but we would like
to suggest that you keep your seat belt
fastened while seated in case of a huge
hole opening in the side of the plane, or
maybe turbulence.
In a few moments the flight attendants
will be moving through the cabin serving
beverages and things to drink. Afterwards
we will be serving a hot meal, which can
also be used as a flotation device.
(On the ground)
Thank you for flying PSA-USAir-TWA
RJ. Rcynolds-Nabisco-Tcxas Air-Donald
Trump airlines flight 321, although really
you didn't do anything but sit there and
put your lives in our hands, so it should
actually be you thanking us. Once again,
on behalf of the entire crew, which can
be used as a flotation device, thank you
for flying with us. Before deplaning ("Look,
Mr. Rourkc, dc plane, de plane") please
check under your scats and in the overhead
compartments for any articles or small
children you may have brought aboard.
