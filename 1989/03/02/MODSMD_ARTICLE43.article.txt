# New Order needs a new technique

Disco lives!
(Still reading?(l'm only joking,
but I'll swear that's what I
thought after suffering through
"Fine Time," the first track on
the new New Order album,
"Technique." You've probably
heard it at The Vortex or any
hi-tech dance club — suppos
edly it's what everybody's play
ing.
Except myself, and probably
anyone else you know who's
picked up "Technique." It's
enough to conjure up visions of
bell bottoms and John Travolta.
But even if you skip "Find
Time" and sit through the rest
of "Technique," the seventh ef
fort by the hi-tech successors of
Joy Division, you'll probably be
scratching your head — not to
mention your slightly thinner
wallet — and wondering
whether New Order has more
to offer than neo-disco.
The other seven songs (that's
excluding "Fine Time") are a
semi-pleasant mix of, well ...
you know, all the songs sound
sort of the same. In fact, I've
listened to this tape at least 20
times and still can't tell some
of them apart.
That's not too harsh a
criticism, however. It is quite
listenable, though not riveting.
You'll never tire of "Technique,"
though I can't imagine getting

terribly excited about it, either.
For many, New Order's ap
peal has been their synthesizer
wizardry on songs like "Bizarre
Love Triangle" and "Blue Mon
day." But "Round & Round,"
the only "Technique" song
(again, we're not counting "Fine
Time") to flex the keyboards,
falls far short of the mark.
And maybe that's the prob
lem with "Technique." Nothing
stands out. There's not an
themic "True Faith," no chilling
"Shellshock," nothing that lives
up to New Order's singular and
somewhat macabre history.
As noted before, Joy Division
was the genesis group, a name
taken from the ranks of Jewish
prostitutes who "reported" to
upper-level Nazi officials of the
Third Reich. Joy Division dirges
like "Atmosphere" and "Love
Will Tear Us Apart" were so
depressing that lead singer
(groaner?) lan Curtis hanged
himself. The rest of the group
re-formed, this time appellating
themselves with the vision of
the Nazis: a worldwide "new
order."
But whatever passionate force
may have driven the band to
produce quality of the "Sub
stance" collection has been
abandoned in favor of the less
distinctive (and perhaps more
airplayable?) "Technique." Sad
ly, technique is the one thing
New Order isn't exercising these
days.
