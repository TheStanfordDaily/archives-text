# Who needs The News or The Pips? We got The Penguins

It doesn't take brains to make
it in the music industry. Or talent
for that matter. lust look at Bon
Jovi or Tiffany and you'll get the
picture. So, it's a pleasant surprise
to find them both (brains and tal
ent, not Bon Jovi and Tiffany) in
a new band, and that's what you'll
find in Stanford's very own band,
Merv Spiegel and the Penguins.
The Penguins formed in the win
ter of 1985 when bassist Pete
Adamy, guitarist Mark Crimmins
and drummer Mike Heller enlisted
the vocal chords of Marty Arnest.
(Marty isn't really in the band, just
his vocal chords are.) Pete and
Mike have since graduated from
Stanford with degrees in French
and Economic respectively.
Marty is completing an English
major, and Mark is currently a
candidate for a doctorate in phi
losophy. In case you're wondering,
.Merv isn't in the band any more.
Like many bands, the Penguins
â€¢were originally a cover band, but
have since evolved to recording
their debut album, "The Spitting
Tree." During the past three years,
the band's development has taken
them from covering tunes by such
Varied bands as the Carpenters,
Husker Dii and Aerosmith to ere

ating their own rock 'n roll sound.
That sound comes from the way
the Penguins compose their songs.
When the Penguins started com
posing original songs, they tended
to sound very different, depending
on who wrote them.
As a remedy, the Penguins now

write songs as a collective effort,
with Marty composing most of the
lyrics. (His vocal chords have to
sing them after all.) Band members
come to rehearsals with half-baked
ideas for songs and let the band


Guitarer Mark Crimmins, Drummist Mike Heller, Basselope Pete Adamy and Vocalizer Marty Arnest
are Merv Spiegal and The Penguins. They do play their own instruments, although they aren't in the
picture.
