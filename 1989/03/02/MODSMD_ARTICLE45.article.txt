# More on Merv's music

Releasing a debut album is
an exciting event for any young
band. So it's no surprise to find
Merv Spiegel and the Penguins
excited about their debut re
lease, "Spitting Tree," which of
fers a collection of songs that
any band would be proud of to
call its own.
"Spitting Tree" contains a di
verse collection of songs from
melodic tunes such as "The Bat
tle of the Quisp and Quake" to
the more energetic attack on
television in "Box Full of Free
dom" and "Crawling Through
Your Movie."
Also mixed in is the short
musical piece, "The Skunk."
This song is truly a little stinker

and should have been either fur
ther refined or axed altogether.
However, it does provide an in
teresting introduction to the
Penguins' best song on the
album, "She's My Cleopatra," a
commentary on modern times
that's not as pretentious as U2.
The Penguins also sing about
their favorite rich milk choco
late covered snack treats in
"Goobers and Raisincts," a silly
song that's cute but doesn't dis
play any of the band's real tal
ent.
A third quality song,
"Argmageddon in Her Eyes,"
confirms that the Penguins'
songwriting talent demonstra
ted in "Quisp" and "Cleopatra"
wasn't just by chance and en
sures that the Penguins are here
to stay.
