# 'Welcome Back Kotter' goes straight to Hell

"Blackboard Jungle." "The Principal."
"Stand and Deliver." Films about the ed
ucational system are not a new idea. But
John ("Rocky," "The Karate Kid")
Avildsen's latest attempt puts a new coat
of paint on the genre. "Lean on Me" is
basically a chalkboard "Rocky" with a lot
of spirit and gallons of energetic zeal. You
know how critics always exclaim "This is
the feel-good movie of the year!"? Well,
this is my choice.
"Lean on Me" is based on the career of
New Jersey High School principal Joe
Clark. Clark was appointed headmaster of
a school infested with drug dealers, thieves
and other juvenile delinquents. He was
instructed to clean up the mess.

To do so, Clark didn't just speak softly
and carry a big stick. He spoke loudly and
carried a big bat. Whatever his unconven
tional methods were, Clark lifted the
school's standards and spirits, and he
taught the students to appreciate their ed
ucation. A little glib? Yes. But this fairy
tale actually happened, and that's why the
movie works.
The film opens with a pastiche of hor
rifying scenes involving the criminal stu
dents (fights, beatings, riots) all to the
sounds of Guns-n-Roses' "Welcome to the
Jungle." The effect sure scared me, but
I'm not sure if it was the scenes or the
soundtrack (probably the soundtrack). In
any case, after this shotgun prologue the
film never lets up. Clark is appointed
headmaster, and the story begins.

The rest of the movie moves at a frenzied
pace, and it's even exausting to watch.
Each scene is tense and loud, much like
the actual environment in which it occurs.
Clark's task of reforming the school is not
at all easy and one never does get the
impression that it is; "Stand and Deliver"
took the same story but presented delin
quents who were about as threatening as
the Brady Bunch. "Lean on Me" never
makes this mistake â€” the teenagers are
menacing and dangerous, and Clark's life
is sometimes at stake.
While Clark is portrayed as a hero, he
is never glorified to the extent that his
faults are concealed. He is tyrannical,
egotistical and at times inconsiderate to
fellow employees.
Director Avildsen keenly observes this,

and he avoids the pure-as-gold martyr
characterization which would have marred
the film. Instead, Clark is presented as a
hero with faults, which contributes to his
credibility.
The acting in "Lean on Me" is superb
across the board. Morgan Freeman,
nominated for an Oscar last year for his
supporting role in "Street Smart," portrays
Joe Clark with agressiveness as well as
warmth. He is one of the few actors today,
who like James Woods or Glenn Close,
can express an entire stream of emotions
through one intense expression.
Watching Freeman at work is enthrall
ing, and 10 minutes into the movie you'll
forget you're watching an actor. You'll be
lieve it's a flesh-and-blood character named
Joe Clark.
