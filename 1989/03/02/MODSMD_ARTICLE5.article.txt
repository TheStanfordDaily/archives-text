University officials yesterday granted a first
round victory to supporters of the Bridge Peer
Counseling Center, promising that the center could
keep its present office space at least until the end

In an interview with The Daily last week during
which he discussed the space shortage on campus,
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Michael Ramsey-Perez

statement outlining the decisions made. "The Bridge
appreciates the Stanford community's tremendous
positive response regarding the 24-tour peer coun

Bridge space," the release stated.
Bridge staff declined further comment on the
