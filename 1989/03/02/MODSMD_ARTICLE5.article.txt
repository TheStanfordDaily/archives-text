# The 						Bridge gets a year's reprieve
## 
### Nathanael Cousins Staff writer 
University officials yesterday granted a first
round victory to supporters of the Bridge Peer
Counseling Center, promising that the center could
keep its present office space at least until the end
of next year.
In an interview with The Daily last week during
which he discussed the space shortage on campus,
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Michael Ramsey-Perez
questioned the necessity for live-in counseling at
the Bridge, which has served the Stanford commu
nity for 18 years.
But in a meeting yesterday morning with Bridge
staff and supporters, Ramsey-Perez and Assoc. Dean
of Student Affairs Michael Jackson postponed fur
ther review of the Bridge's status for a year and
encouraged the continued growth of the program.
"We weren't out to jeopardize the Bridge," said
Jackson. "We wanted to assure them that our pur
pose was to understand their program and to make
sure the space was being used to the maximum."
Ramsey-Perez and Jackson co-chair the Commit
tee on Student Organized Spaces, which allocates
space for student groups. The committee had con
sidered allocating the Bridge location to other public
service groups next year.
Following the meeting, the Bridge staff issued a
statement outlining the decisions made. "The Bridge
appreciates the Stanford community's tremendous
positive response regarding the 24-tour peer coun
seling service and the maintenance of the current
Bridge space," the release stated.
Bridge staff declined further comment on the
decision.
In defense of its present allocated space, support
ers of the Bridge submitted a 50-page report to
Ramsey-Perez and Jackson last week. The report
detailed the need for a student-run, self-supported,
24-hour counseling service.
In addition, a petition supporting the Bridge is
currently being circulated on campus. Bridge live-in
Stephanie Kondik would not comment on the status
of the student initiative.
Included in the report were statistics indicating
that 62 percent of all calls to the
Bridge come in after business
hours and that almost 50 percent
of calls are handled by live-ins.
According to Jackson, the com
mittee will review the Bridge
report and any addendums during
the next year before making a
final decision in the spring of
1990. As part of the review, they
will distribute the report to an
objective committee of Stanford
community members and solicit
input.
Noting that the continuation of
the Bridge program and its
housing in the present facility
were separate issues, Jackson said
that the committee's review of the
Bridge facility did not constitute
"a veiled strategy." He explained
that the one year postponement
is needed to calm things down
and to assess the Bridge more
carefully.
The Bridge currently houses
five live-in counselors at 640
Campus Dr. Staffers and live-ins
work on a volunteer basis for the
entirely self-supported organiza
tion, but the University supplies
the space rent-free. Each spring
the Bridge hosts "The Spring
Faire" which raises approximately
$15,000 to cover operating ex
penses.
