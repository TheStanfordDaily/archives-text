# Asian-American tenure position still up in air
## 
### Martha Brockenbrough 
Although pledging to continue offering classes on
Asian-American history, University officials yester
day made no promises for the immediate creation
of a tenure-track position in the subject.
In a meeting with representatives from several
student groups, University Provost James Rosse
said the University was committed to the subject
but must work within budgetary limitations. "The
priorities of the University have been revised . . .
but there are resource constraints," he said, citing
a significant budgetary cut in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences.
However, Rosse said the University is still in the
process of making a decision and that he "expects
the program [to be developed! within two years."
While students perceive the decision-making proc
ess as a slow one, Rosse said "to move in a manner
otherwise would be damaging" to the integrity of
the system.
Asian-American Students Asso
ciation members who attended the
meeting said they were extremely
disappointed by the lack of a firm
commitment on the part of the
University. Assurances that an
Asian-American history class will
continue at Stanford did not
satisfy them.
"We want the legacy that a ten
ure track can provide," said AASA
member Michelle Yee, a sopho
more.
AASA's request for a tenure po
sition follows last month's resig
nation of lecturer Gordon Chang,
the only person currently teaching
a course in the area of Asian-
American studies.
Other student groups showing
their support at the meeting in
cluded the Black Student Union,
the Committee on Democracy in
Education, the Stanford Ameri
can Indian Organization and
MEChA, a Chicano student organ

ization.
SAIO representative Tracey
Lebeau said the meeting's pur
pose was to express concern that
the University was letting oppor
tunities for multicultural educa
tion "slip through their fingers."
Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Ewart Thomas, Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Thomas
Wasow and History Department
Chair James Sheehan also atten
ded the meeting.
The University is "committed
to finding a way that Asian-
American history is taught next
year," Wasow told The Daily yes
terday.
AASA members reiterated the
group's concern for a long-term
commitment from the University.
"[The creation of a position]
would be the perfect opportunity
[for the University] to be an in
novator," Yee said.
Rosse, however, compared the
creation of a tenured professor
ship to a "marriage, only it is
more permanent because you
can't get a divorce because of the
tenure [commitment]."
