# UFW co-founder Dolores Huerta:
## Women struggling for 'Herstory' 
### Debby Lu 
Likening the women's move
ment to the struggles of the
United Farm Workers, UFW co
founder Dolores Huerta said
women "are so oppressed that
we don't even know how op
pressed we are — there are
layers and layers of institution
alized oppression."
Huerta concluded the
Chicano Fellows Program
"Making Herstory: Chicanas
Confronting the System" last
night by stating that she plans
to refocus her energies on the
women's movement. Huerta's

talk, was far
reaching, rang
ing from UFW
experiences and
her political
opinions to her
own family life.
She stated
that the slump
of the women's
movement is

partly due to political machina
tions. The attention that has
been focused on Roe v. Wade,
she claimed, is "not about abor
tion at all — it's about using
the abortion issue to distract
women so they can't get politi

cally organized to address eco
nomic and other areas.
A boardmember of The
Feminist Majority, Huerta
jokingly added, "I'm the only
one on the board who has 11
kids and finds it hard to talk
about the abortion issue."
Huerta has been involved in
labor organizing since 1958
when the AFL-CIO encouraged
her to work for field workers'
representation. She and labor
leader Cesar Chavez founded
the independent UFW in 1962.
"Women need to just step in
and say, 'I've got to be involved
in decisions,' " Huerta said.
