## Eastern workers prepare to strike 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Federal mediators said yesterday
a new contract offer was being
considered by Eastern Airlines
and its Machinists, and they ex
pressed hope of averting a strike
midnight tonight that could dis
rupt travel nationwide.
The union said the company
had made the new offer, but East
ern declined to confirm that,
citing a news blackout.
Eastern pilots, meanwhile,
rejected a separate company offer
designed to keep them from
staging a sympathy strike with
the Machinists. Both the pilots
and flight attendants said they
would refuse to cross picket lines
if a strike is called after the end
(if a federally imposed cooling-off
tonight.
AFL-CIO President Lane
Kirkland said all union workers
should honor Machinist picket
lines, which other union officials
have said could be put up at other
airlines and transportation com
panies in addition to Eastern.

Both the pilots and
flight attendants said
they would refuse to
cross picket lines if a
strike is called.

Kirkland accused Frank
Lorenzo, owner of Texas Air Corp.
which is Eastern's parent compa
ny, of "finding it worth his while
to purchase a good company and
strip its assets, rather than oper
ate it fairly and decently."
Kirkland asked President Bush
to follow a National Mediation
Board request and call a special
panel that would delay a strike
for 60 days.
Bush plans to meet with top
advisers on the situation today.
Eastern opposes presidential ac
tion, saying it is losing $1 million
a day and can't afford delay in
making salary cuts it has pro
posed. It had originally asked
$150 million in cuts, but union

official Wally Haber in Miami said
the new offer was less stringent.
"The company is still looking
for major concessions, but it's not
$150 million," Haber said.
The union has been asking for
$50 million in raises.
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
said a letter to Bush signed by a
third of the Senate urged him to
step in, noting that Eastern serves
102 cities throughout North and
South America, with 60 U.S. cities
in 27 states dependent on the air
line for passenger and freight
service.
"Any interruption in this serv
ice will result in a major disruptin
of interstate commerce," the let
ter said.
Kennedy noted that no presi
dent has ever refused to act on a
mediation board recommendation
to call a special panel.
Eastern declined to confirm
that it had made a new offer in
the 17-month-old dispute with
8,500 baggage carriers and other
ground service workers. Airline
spokesman Robin Matell said a
news blackout on the talks
prevented any discussion of offers.
"We've been seeking a
negotiated settlement all along
and anything that moves us in
that direction is welcome and we
remain hopeful we can work out
a negotiated agreement prior to
the midnight deadline," Matell
said.
Union president William
Winpisinger, who was not par
ticipating in the talks, said he had
not heard of any new offer, but
added, "If there's movement indi
cated, maybe there's a possibility
we'll get it settled."
Walter Wallace, National
Mediation Board chairman, an
nounced that a new offer was
made in talks yesterday but
declined to say which side made it.
"There has been action that
hopefully might be the kind of
breakthrough we are looking for.
There's been some movement,"
Wallace said.
He said the parties were eval
uating the offer and would meet
separately later with board
mediators in hopes of reaching a
settlement.
