U.K. rejects novel talks with Iran
LONDON (AP) — Britain said yesterday it
would not accept new Iranian offers of negotia
tions until the Islamic government renounces vi
olence in the dispute over the novel "The Satanic
Verses."
Iran, however, said the overtures for concilia
tion came from Britain and that author Salman
Rushdie remains subject to "divine justice."
Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe, mean
while, said he understood the book was "deeply
offensive" to Moslems, and that it also offends
Britons by likening their country to Nazi Ger

many.
The Foreign Office said it had been contacted
Wednesday and yesterday by the Iranian Foreign
Ministry proposing a meeting.
Thais said to be refusing Laotians
BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) - Thailand has
forced Laotians fleeing Communist persecution
back to their homeland, where "hundreds, if not
thousands" of them have died, a U.S. human
rights group claimed in a report today.
A senior Thai official denounced the groups
claims as "unrealistic" and said his country has
not forced any Laotians seeking asylum back.
