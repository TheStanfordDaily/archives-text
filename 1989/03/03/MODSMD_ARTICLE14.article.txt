BONN, West Germany <AP) —
Investigators have cracked a
major spy ring in which West Ger
man "hackers" allegedly acquired
sensitive military computer pas
swords and codes and sold them
to the Soviets, an official said yes
terday.
A West German television net
work said the passwords and
other information came from key
military and research computers
in the United States, Western Eu
rope and Japan.
Three West Germans have been
detained on suspicion of "obtain
ing information about access to
databanks, and to have passed
that on to Soviet intelligence
agents," said Roland Bachmeier,
spokesman for the federal Interior
Ministry.
He refused to confirm other
details of a report by the
Norddeutsche Rundfunk broad
casting network.
The Pentagon issued a one
sentence statement yesterday say
ing: "Until possibly affected com
ponents of the Department of De
fense have had a chance to analyze
the report, we have no reaction."
William Caldwell, a Pentagon
spokesman, said the department
would have no further comment
before today at the earliest.
One security source in West
Germany, speaking in an inter
view with The Associated Press
on condition of anonymity, said
the "hackers" tried to break into
a large U.S. military computer
network in West Germany but

failed to gain access to secret ma
terial.
Police in Hanover arrested two
computer hackers on "suspicion
of espionage activities for an East
ern European intelligence
agency," said Alexander Prechtel,
spokesman for the Federal Pros
ecutor's Office in Karlsruhe. An
other suspect was arrested in
West Berlin, he said.
"They are suspected of breaking
into foreign computer systems"
and selling information to com
munist agents, Prechtel said.
He said investigators still are
trying to determine how much
damage the suspected espionage
had caused to Western security
interests.
Norddeutsche Rundfunk re
ported the hackers gained access
to a key U.S. Defense Department
computer and to important re
search computers elsewhere.
They obtained sensitive infor
mation that would allow the
Soviets to gain access to the com
puters, the network said.
Among the computers was the
U.S. Defense Department's gen
eral databank known as Optimus,
a NASA computer, as well as com
puters tied to nuclear weapons
and energy research in New
Mexico and Illinois, the network
said.
Those facilities are the Los
Alamos National Laboratory in
Los Alamos, N.M., and the Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory
near Chicago.
