# Jewish group to fight 'Aryan Woodstock'
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A judge was
expected to rule today on an attempt to halt
the whites-only "Aryan Woodstock" rock con
cert planned for tomorrow on a physician's
pasture some 40 miles north of San Francisco.
Napa County Superior Court Judge Scott
Snowden said yesterday he would give organ
izers of the skinhead event an extra day to
respond to a county move to get a court order
to bar the concert.
Napa County District Attorney Jerry Maut
ner told a morning hearing that the county
couldn't issue a permit for an event restricted
according to race.

A few hours later, Irv Rubin, a leader of
the militant Jewish Defense League, vowed
to die "if I have to" at a demonstration against
the concert on the Napa-Solano county line.
Rubin told a hotel lobby news conference
that hundreds of people from Southern Cal
ifornia were planning to join him in the
protest. He pleaded for on-site backing from
Northern Californians.
"We are not turning-the-other-cheek-type of
Jews," he said. "Never again."
The concert was to take place on pasture
land owned by Dr. Howard Lonsdale, who has

professed to be simply a landlord and ignorant
of prior knowledge that Metzger was planning
an avowedly racist event. The site is about
35 miles north of San Francisco.
Montreal-born Rubin, national (U.S.) chair
man of the JDL, said he wants to organize
"a mass demonstration to stop the Nazis from
holding what they call a rock for racism con
cert.
"This is not a musical event. This event is
based on recruiting other skinheads to murder
Jews and blacks and Hispartics" — anybody
they don't consider white, Anglo-Saxon
Protestants."
