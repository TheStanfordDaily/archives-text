# Senate begins debate on Tower
## Bush fails to convince Democrats to support nominee 
### 
WASHINGTON <AP)
Senators fired their opening vol
leys yesterday in a party-line floor
battle on John Tower's faltering
nomination, while the White
House conceded that President
Bush has failed to convince a
single Democrat to support his
chosen defense secretary.
"Not yet," responded White
House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater when asked to provide
the name of one Democrat the
administration had won over after

two days of intensive lobbying.
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the
chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, began the long
awaited debate, saying he was act
ing with a "sense of sorrow" in
leading the opposition against his
former colleague whom he had ex
pected to support when the hear
ings began.
But the Georgia Democrat said
Tower's "record of alcohol abuse
cannot be ignored."
"We're not talking about the

secretary of interior, we're talking
about someone next to the pres
ident at the very top of the nuclear
chain of command," Nunn said.
Sen. John Warner, R-Va., in re
buttal for the Republicans, ex
tolled Tower for "incalculable con
tributions" to the United States
in 24 years in the Senate and
later service on an arms negotiat
ing team.
No Senate vote is expected until
next week.
