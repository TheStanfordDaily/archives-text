## Fundamental right 
### 
Free speech shouldn't
be subordinated to the
Fundamental Standard

MORE THAN 200 years of
deliberation, law and
progress stand behind
the Constitution's guarantee of
free speech and expression. Now,
Stanford's Student Conduct
Legislative Council, in its pro
posed interpretation of the Fun
damental Standard, wants to
limit these rights.
Under the interpretation,
members of the University would
be held in violation of the Fun
damental Standard for personal
abuse or defamation of groups
involving the use of "obscenities,
epithets and other forms of im
pression that by accepted com
munity standards degrade, vic
timize, stigmatize or perjora
tively characterize" the groups or
person in question.
The University does have an
obligation to reconcile the con
tradiction between the Funda
mental Standard and the First
Amendment, but not in a manner
that will deprive University
members of ConstUujtiipir>al»
rights.
Although the University, as a
private institution, is not bound
by the First Amendment, it has
a moral and intellectual obliga
tion to uphold it. More than
anywhere else, a university must
foster free interchange of ideas.
In no case should the Funda
mental Standard override the
First Amendment. Only instances
of speech not protected by the
First Amendement — defamation
and inciteful "fighting words" —

should be punished as a violation
of the Fundamental Standard.
By proposing an interpretation
that restricts basic rights
protected under the Constitution,
the council has embarked on a
potentially risky course. Further
more, the council uses danger
ously vague and ambiguous lan
guage in its proposal.
In endeavoring to protect Uni
versity members from expression
that may offend or intimidate
them, the proposal inadvertently
sustains the very prejudice that
it seeks to eradicate. Discrimina
tion belongs out in the open,
where it can be combated and
destroyed.
The proposal's language, espe
cially the phrase "acceptable com
munity standards" is troubling.
In a diverse university commu
nity comprised of many different
perspectives, who would set the
standards?
Rather than allow some Uni
versity committee to dictate what
community standards should be,
let the community as a whole
impose standards itself.
Many feel that the University
should take a stand on harmful
prejudice by punishing behavior
that it deems unacceptable.
Stanford jias a right to expect
oweptieaat behavior from its
community members but should
fight racism, sexism and other
bigotry by doing what a univer
sity does best — educating.
Recruiting more minority fac
ulty and students and strengthen
ing ethnic studies programs are
essential to Stanford's educa
tional mission and would help en
courage the development of "such
respect for order, morality, per
sonal honor and the rights of
others as is demanded of good
citizens."
