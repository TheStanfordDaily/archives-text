# Res Ed gives gender issues focus house the thumbs up
## 
### Rob Burwell Staff writer 
For the first time next year,
Stanford will house men and
women in a house focused on men
and women.
Robinson House in Sterling
Quad will become the gender is
sues focus house on a one-year
trial basis starting next fall, a Res
idential Education panel decided
yesterday.
After four weeks of deliberat
ing, the Residential Education
Configuration Panel, which
reviews and selects theme and

focus house proposals every year,
decided to make the gender issues
house the University's second
focus house and rejected proposals
for environmental appreciation,
international and Judaic studies
focus houses.
The gender issues proposal
"struck the panel as just right for
a focus house," according to Dean
of Residential Affairs Norm Rob
inson, a member of the panel.
The panel was made up of two
Res Ed representatives, three fac
ulty members and two resident
assistants. A key member of the
panel, Assoc. Dean of Residential

Education Alice Supton, who
worked with the authors of the
four proposals before they were
submitted, was out of town and
missed the proceedings.
According to Robinson, time
pressure hastened the decisions,
because the 1989 Draw book,
which catalogues University
housing options, is scheduled to
go to press today.
Robinson was chosen as the
gender issues house partly be
cause it is relatively large and
houses only upperclass students.
