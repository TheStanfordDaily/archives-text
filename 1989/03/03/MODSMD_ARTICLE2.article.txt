# Res Ed gives gender issues focus house the thumbs up
## 
### Rob Burwell Staff writer 
For the first time next year,
Stanford will house men and
women in a house focused on men
and women.
Robinson House in Sterling
Quad will become the gender is
sues focus house on a one-year
trial basis starting next fall, a Res
idential Education panel decided
yesterday.
After four weeks of deliberat
ing, the Residential Education
Configuration Panel, which
reviews and selects theme and

focus house proposals every year,
decided to make the gender issues
house the University's second
focus house and rejected proposals
for environmental appreciation,
international and Judaic studies
focus houses.
The gender issues proposal
"struck the panel as just right for
a focus house," according to Dean
of Residential Affairs Norm Rob
inson, a member of the panel.
The panel was made up of two
Res Ed representatives, three fac
ulty members and two resident
assistants. A key member of the
panel, Assoc. Dean of Residential

Education Alice Supton, who
worked with the authors of the
four proposals before they were
submitted, was out of town and
missed the proceedings.
According to Robinson, time
pressure hastened the decisions,
because the 1989 Draw book,
which catalogues University
housing options, is scheduled to
go to press today.
Robinson was chosen as the
gender issues house partly be
cause it is relatively large and
houses only upperclass students.
"A focus house would have no
special Draw priorities," Robinson
said. Focus houses merely allow
students interested in a particular
issue to live together, he said.
Emphasizing the importance of
focusing a house on gender issues,
Housing Director Rodger Whitney
said the house will have no impact
on returning residency or the
Draw pool as a whole because stu
dents will not get priorities to live
there. Priority will be given only
to the four or five focus assistants,
who will help shape programs for
the approximately 90 students in
the house, he said.
Current Robinson Resident Fel
lows Ken Fields and Nora Cain
will stay on as RFs for the gender
issues focus house.
Robinson praised the gender is
sues proposal for its thoughtful
presentation of its programs, and
emphasized the focus will be only
one aspect of life in the house.
Co-coordinator of the gender is
sues proposal, Teri Hopper, a

junior said, "We're really excited.
The house is a good way to raise
gender issues on campus."
According to Hopper, the panel
raised concerns last weekend
about the role of men living in
the house. The proposal's sup
porters added an addendum "to
allay their fears" in time for the
panel's decision on Wednesday.
Under the addendum, men will
be encouraged to participate in
workshops on gender issues, share
and explore perspectives on
feminism and compare notes on
their experiences in the house, she
said.
Robinson said the panel
rejected the proposal for a Judaic
studies house becausc it gave a
convincing argument for a Judaic
studies theme house, but was too
ambitious for a focus house pro
posal.
"It was too developed," he said.
"The panel could not figure out
how to scale it down." The panel
returned the proposal to one of
its authors for revision, but due
to miscommunication a condensed
version was not turned in bv Wed
nesday, authors said.

Robinson said the proposal will
be deferred for a year. "It's an
extremely valuable house, it's just
that the panel could not get its
concerns resolved."
Junior Daniella Evans, one of
the proposal's authors, said
proponents of the house were un
der the impression that the Judaic
studies house would start out as
a focus house and be converted
to a theme house after a year, so
they wrote their proposal as a
comprehensive argument for their
long-term goal.
According to Robinson, the
panel liked the interest shown by
students in creating an environ
mental awareness house, but said
the proposal was clearly put to
gether in a hurry.
Although the international
focus house proposal was rejected,
Robinson said it highlighted the
need for Stanford to pay more
attention to incoming interna
tional students, a group he said
"has been largely ignored." He
said the panel decided that a focus
house would not best solve the
problems encountered by interna
tional freshmen.

Emphasizing the importance of
focusing a house on gender issues,
Housing Director Rodger Whitney
said the house will have no impact
on returning residency or the
Draw pool as a whole because stu
dents will not get priorities to live
there. Priority will be given only
to the four or five focus assistants,
who will help shape programs for
the approximately 90 students in
the house, he said.
Current Robinson Resident Fel
lows Ken Fields and Nora Cain
will stay on as RFs for the gender
issues focus house.
Robinson praised the gender is
sues proposal for its thoughtful
presentation of its programs, and
emphasized the focus will be only
one aspect of life in the house.
Co-coordinator of the gender is
sues proposal, Teri Hopper, a

junior said, "We're really excited.
The house is a good way to raise
gender issues on campus."
According to Hopper, the panel
raised concerns last weekend
about the role of men living in
the house. The proposal's sup
porters added an addendum "to
allay their fears" in time for the
panel's decision on Wednesday.
Under the addendum, men will
be encouraged to participate in
workshops on gender issues, share
and explore perspectives on
feminism and compare notes on
their experiences in the house, she
said.
Robinson said the panel
rejected the proposal for a Judaic
studies house becausc it gave a
convincing argument for a Judaic
studies theme house, but was too
ambitious for a focus house pro
posal.
"It was too developed," he said.
"The panel could not figure out
how to scale it down." The panel
returned the proposal to one of
its authors for revision, but due
to miscommunication a condensed
version was not turned in bv Wed
nesday, authors said.

Robinson said the proposal will
be deferred for a year. "It's an
extremely valuable house, it's just
that the panel could not get its
concerns resolved."
Junior Daniella Evans, one of
the proposal's authors, said
proponents of the house were un
der the impression that the Judaic
studies house would start out as
a focus house and be converted
to a theme house after a year, so
they wrote their proposal as a
comprehensive argument for their
long-term goal.
According to Robinson, the
panel liked the interest shown by
students in creating an environ
mental awareness house, but said
the proposal was clearly put to
gether in a hurry.
Although the international
focus house proposal was rejected,
Robinson said it highlighted the
need for Stanford to pay more
attention to incoming interna
tional students, a group he said
"has been largely ignored." He
said the panel decided that a focus
house would not best solve the
problems encountered by interna
tional freshmen.
