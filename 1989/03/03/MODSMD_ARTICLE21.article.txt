THE PRINCIPLES of the First
Amendment are being attacked
within Stanford University and
from abroad.
Two separate events Wednesday made
clear how flimsy the protection of the
U.S. Constitution really is.
Two Berkeley bookstores that sold Sal
man Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses" and
the offices of a New York newspaper that
defended the book were firebombed early
Wednesday.
Though no one has claimed responsi
bility for these terrorist acts, speculation
points to fundamentalist Moslems out
raged by Rushdie's fictional work.
It is shocking that orthodox Moslems,
most of whom have not read the book,
presume to dictate what can be read and
written the world over. And they are
getting away with it.
The threat to booksellers defending the
right to sell Rushdie's book has become
a very real test of their commitment to
freedom of expression. Bookstores have
undeniably become the front line of a
very important battle.
In a separate development Wednesday,
Stanford's Student Conduct Legislative
Council released its recommendations for
the amendment of the Fundamental
Standard.
The effort to amend the Fundamental
Standard grew out of incidents of the
past jraar involving racist and homophobic
behavior. The council clearly intends to
create a standard that will allow punish
ment for verbalizations insulting to seg
ments of the Stanford community.
The proposal in part reads, "Members

of the Stanford community have the right
not to be inescapably and involuntarily
exposed to obscenities, epithets and other
forms of expression that by accepted com
munity standards |my italics) stigmatize,
victimize or pejoratively characterize per
sons or groups on the basis of personal
or cultural differences."
Who is to decide what accepted com
munity standards are? Frightfully, this
language could easily be used to defend
the suppression of "The Satanic Verses,"
which many Moslems feel is an un
bearable attack on Islam.
The firebombings and the council's
proposal both conjure up Draconian
images of thought-police monitoring
speech and writing. Are roaming thugs,
or the more insidious bureaucratic breed
of the same animal, going to be allowed
to dictate truth?
Though the University is not legally
bound) to rospect the First Amendment,
Stanford of all institutions has a moral
responsibility to preserve principles of
free speech.
Free thought and free speech are the
hallmarks of the university environment.
The council's amendments embody a big
step toward a restricted environment in
which students must fear the implications
of every word, exercising a chilling effect
on the exchange of ideas within the Uni
versity.
Just because Stanford can restrict
speech doesn't mean it should.
The most important aspect of the First
Amendment is the absolute protection of
free speech. Under the First Amendment,
a U.S. citizen has the right to describe

blacks with the word "nigger." Though
such a statement displays bigotry and
violates my personal standard of behav
ior, it must be protected.
Allowing the majority to muzzle the
opinions of the minority, no matter how
repugnant, guts the First Amendment.
The principle will not survive if it is
qualified piecemeal.
Condoning the punishment of someone
who scrawls "nigger" on a poster is the
same as allowing the punishment of a
civil rights activist who violates the
heterodoxy of the 1950s by labeling
Southern whites "racists."
The hypocrisy of protesting Ayatollah
Khomeini's attempt to have Salman
Rushdie killed while simultaneously at
tempting to enforce "accepted community
standards" is glaring and undeniable.
In certain circles, this column might
be considered insulting or even grounds
for retribution. Whether the firebomb or
the Fundamental Standard is the weapon
of choice, the end result is that the right
to violate the sanctitv of "acceptable"
opinion is threatened.
