Requiring objective
professors harms
academic freedom
Who says professors have to be "ob
jective?"
In a Feb. 24 letter, Holden Maecker
says teachers of the animal rights class
should be "objective," and questions
having "biased" courses in the catalog.
If Holden Maecker or anyone else
tells qualified teachers how to teach or
what to teach, academic freedom is
over at Stanford.
Maecker has the right to be as "ob
jective" or "subjective" as he wants in
his research and teaching — including
the right to pursue an idea at the
expense of what other scholars might
think "objectively" more promising.
Everyone who teaches at this univer
sity has the same right. If we do not
have this right, why not turn the cur
riculum over to unbiased thought
police to validate our "objectivity" and
right to teach here?

BGLC does not
claim to represent
black community
I was disturbed by the Feb. 23 arti
cle titled "Black Greeks reject liaison
proposal." The article centered around
the Black Greek Letter Council's sup
posed resistance to the efforts of the
Interfraternity Council and Inter
sorority Council to "promote formal
interaction between their groups and
the black community."
Considering the article's content, it
seems that responsible journalism
would dictate speaking at length with a
BGLC representative, if only to deter-

mine whether the charges were correct
If this had been done, a fair, objective
article would have been the result.
The BGLC as a group is open to
creating a better working relationship
with the IFC and ISC. However, we do
not feel that the methods they pro
posed are the best way to affect a
change, or that they are even in our
best interest.
Further, the fact that the BGLC was
not asked to participate in determining
these methods is indicative of tremen
dous arrogance on the part of the IFC
and ISC. Their actions effectively
stated "we (their organizations) want
to learn more about you and we will
do it by participating in your meet
ings."
This type of attitude is detrimental
to forming an equal working relation
ship. So rather than being "excuses,"
as Don Burdette says, our concerns are
valid and up to this point have not
been addressed.
Finally, I would like to clarify the
BGLC's role in the black community.
The BGLC is not, and does not claim
to be, representative of the entire black
student population on campus. We rep
resent approximately one-thirteenth of
the black community at Stanford.
While we work closely with other black
student organizations, we primarily
serve as the voice of the Black Greek
letter organizations on campus.
Hence, the article's implication that
the BGLC has prevented IFC and ISC
involvement in the black community is
ludicrous. If their motives are truly
sincere, there exist many other
avenues, which some of their member
organizations have taken, to involve
ment with the black community.
However, the IFC and ISC should
examine their own attitudes before
approaching other black students, or
they will be met with few results.

The Daily did a great disservice to
the Stanford community in its Feb. 23
unbalanced coverage of the Interfrater
nity and Intersorority Council report
"The Role of Greeks (fraternities and
sororities) in the Black Community."
This 31-page report analyzed Greek
attitudes toward interaction with the
black community as expressed during a
workshop sponsored by the IFC and
ISC last fall. The report offered con
structive suggestions for continued
interaction between the two groups, as
well as a positive agenda for better
relations and understanding.
But instead of highlighting any of
these positive conclusions, The Daily
chose to focus on Black Greek Letter
Council President Kim Coleman's rejec
tion of the IFC-ISC liaison position. In
concentrating on Coleman's stance, the
article downplayed the significant ma
terial within the report itself and failed
to address the areas in which she is in
agreement with the Greek community.
The Daily neglected to mention that
the liaisons (whom Coleman had
rejected three months earlier — an
other fact unreported by The Daily)
agree with Coleman's concerns and
support her decision.
The entire article seemed to be a
personal attack on Coleman, who
greatly assisted the IFC-ISC report
with a four-page analysis of the role of
Greeks in the black community. The
report would have been much less
credible without her contribution and
we thank her for it.
The article's disregard for these facts
and others is indicative of the ignor
ance many express when approaching
the black community. Our approach to
the black community has been tem
pered with understanding, sincerity
and, above all else, perseverance.

The article incorrectly implies that
Don Burdette feels that the black com
munity needs to educate itself about
the Greek community. That is ridic
ulous. He was referring to the exis
tence of misunderstandings on both
sides. The Daily article has certainly
damaged our efforts and may have
damaged any possibility for continued
interaction between the two groups.
. In sensationalizing an isolated reac
tion to the report, The Daily failed to
give it the credit it deserves. Many
members of the community can benefit
from the information presented in the
report. We therefore urge all who are
interested in the relationship of the
Greek and black communities to obtain
a copy of the report from us.

The BGLC is not, and does not claim
to be, representative of the entire black
student population on campus. We rep
resent approximately one-thirteenth of
the black community at Stanford.
While we work closely with other black
student organizations, we primarily
serve as the voice of the Black Greek
letter organizations on campus.
Hence, the article's implication that
the BGLC has prevented IFC and ISC
involvement in the black community is
ludicrous. If their motives are truly
sincere, there exist many other
avenues, which some of their member
organizations have taken, to involve
ment with the black community.
However, the IFC and ISC should
examine their own attitudes before
approaching other black students, or
they will be met with few results.

positive progress in
fraternal relations
The Daily did a great disservice to
the Stanford community in its Feb. 23
unbalanced coverage of the Interfrater
nity and Intersorority Council report
"The Role of Greeks (fraternities and
sororities) in the Black Community."
This 31-page report analyzed Greek
attitudes toward interaction with the
black community as expressed during a
workshop sponsored by the IFC and
ISC last fall. The report offered con
structive suggestions for continued
interaction between the two groups, as
well as a positive agenda for better
relations and understanding.
But instead of highlighting any of
these positive conclusions, The Daily
chose to focus on Black Greek Letter
Council President Kim Coleman's rejec
tion of the IFC-ISC liaison position. In
concentrating on Coleman's stance, the
article downplayed the significant ma
terial within the report itself and failed
to address the areas in which she is in
agreement with the Greek community.
The Daily neglected to mention that
the liaisons (whom Coleman had
rejected three months earlier — an
other fact unreported by The Daily)
agree with Coleman's concerns and
support her decision.
The entire article seemed to be a
personal attack on Coleman, who
greatly assisted the IFC-ISC report
with a four-page analysis of the role of
Greeks in the black community. The
report would have been much less
credible without her contribution and
we thank her for it.
The article's disregard for these facts
and others is indicative of the ignor
ance many express when approaching
the black community. Our approach to
the black community has been tem
pered with understanding, sincerity
and, above all else, perseverance.

The article incorrectly implies that
Don Burdette feels that the black com
munity needs to educate itself about
the Greek community. That is ridic
ulous. He was referring to the exis
tence of misunderstandings on both
sides. The Daily article has certainly
damaged our efforts and may have
damaged any possibility for continued
interaction between the two groups.
. In sensationalizing an isolated reac
tion to the report, The Daily failed to
give it the credit it deserves. Many
members of the community can benefit
from the information presented in the
report. We therefore urge all who are
interested in the relationship of the
Greek and black communities to obtain
a copy of the report from us.

Requiring objective
professors harms
academic freedom
Who says professors have to be "ob
jective?"
In a Feb. 24 letter, Holden Maecker
says teachers of the animal rights class
should be "objective," and questions
having "biased" courses in the catalog.
If Holden Maecker or anyone else
tells qualified teachers how to teach or
what to teach, academic freedom is
over at Stanford.
Maecker has the right to be as "ob
jective" or "subjective" as he wants in
his research and teaching — including
the right to pursue an idea at the
expense of what other scholars might
think "objectively" more promising.
Everyone who teaches at this univer
sity has the same right. If we do not
have this right, why not turn the cur
riculum over to unbiased thought
police to validate our "objectivity" and
right to teach here?

BGLC does not
claim to represent
black community
I was disturbed by the Feb. 23 arti
cle titled "Black Greeks reject liaison
proposal." The article centered around
the Black Greek Letter Council's sup
posed resistance to the efforts of the
Interfraternity Council and Inter
sorority Council to "promote formal
interaction between their groups and
the black community."
Considering the article's content, it
seems that responsible journalism
would dictate speaking at length with a
BGLC representative, if only to deter-

mine whether the charges were correct
If this had been done, a fair, objective
article would have been the result.
The BGLC as a group is open to
creating a better working relationship
with the IFC and ISC. However, we do
not feel that the methods they pro
posed are the best way to affect a
change, or that they are even in our
best interest.
Further, the fact that the BGLC was
not asked to participate in determining
these methods is indicative of tremen
dous arrogance on the part of the IFC
and ISC. Their actions effectively
stated "we (their organizations) want
to learn more about you and we will
do it by participating in your meet
ings."
This type of attitude is detrimental
to forming an equal working relation
ship. So rather than being "excuses,"
as Don Burdette says, our concerns are
valid and up to this point have not
been addressed.
Finally, I would like to clarify the
BGLC's role in the black community.
The BGLC is not, and does not claim
to be, representative of the entire black
