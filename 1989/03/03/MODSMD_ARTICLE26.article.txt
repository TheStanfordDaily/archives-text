## The
						grass is always green Bug says honey won't cut it 
### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
A lot of you are gonna be comin'
up to the Bug after readin' the
first line of the third question's
answer and you're gonna say,
"Gee, Mr. Bug, sir, how come
you're always so irreverent and
sarcastic about the college system
we're all mired in, yet at the same
time you are a part of that college
system?"
You'll look pretty foolish, there
on your hands and knees talking
to a small insect, but you'll con
tinue nonetheless: "Isn't that
hypocritical? Aren't you like so
many literati who, in their writ
ing, urge that men and women
must shed the shackles of con
vention but who in fact live in
and because of that convention?"
The Bug responds with his
main rule in life: "Talk softly and
carry a big stick, in case you run
into Richard Simmons."
Dear Bug,
Can honey be used as a sper
macide? — Carla Tortelli
Sure, why not? It's worth a try.
Go ahead. What can it hurt? As
the oft-repeated yearbook quote
goes, "If at first you don't seed,
try, try again."
Wait, my serfs, I jest. Of course,
as the oft-repeated yearbook quote
goes, "The truest words are said
in jest, just kidding." But don't
let that stop you from ignoring
the advice of the above paragraph.
Birth control is no laughing mat
ter.
Take, for example, the block
buster motion picture, "Fatal At
traction." Its main characters,
played by Michael Douglas and
Glenn Close, were under the im
pression that, by running the
kitchen sink faucet during inter
course, pregnancy could be
prevented. And look what hap
pened to them.
The Bug took the following
steps to answer your question,
discovering that the answer is
"No."

One source of contraceptive in
formation is your local library. In
fact, because he's never sure when
the subject of contraception might
come up, so to speak, the Bug
keeps a manual on his bedside
table. However, neither this book
nor any of the manuals at Meyer
Library mentioned honey (or tar
tar sauce) at all.
The Bug then called the Con
traceptive Information Center at
Cowell Student Health Center.
Nobody in that office had ever
heard that honey could be used
as a spermacide, and a Cowell
nurse practitioner said, "Abso
lutely not!"
Of course, the next question is
whether or not any spermacides
taste good as a sweetener or on
toast.
Dear Bug,
Why don't they color grass seed
so we could have pink grass?
— Curtip Strange
Well, that cierfciinJ* is a nifty
concept, Curt, but so is a happy
marriage. Unfortunately, some
things are just impossible.
Biology Department research
assistant Kathy Freas had a cou
ple things to say in response to

this question.
First, "Chlorophyll, the funda
mental chemical that allows
photosynthesis to proceed, is
green; that's why plants are green
I Injecting color into a seed] cer
tainly would have no effect on the
color of the plant."
Second, "This is going to be in
The Stanford Daily? Who wants
to know this? Why would anyone
want to have pink grass?"
Dear Bug,
Why is there no "u " in Qantas,
the name of the Australian air
line? — Loni Anderson
Once in a while you find out
that people do things for a living
that are more worthless than
going to college.
The Bug found this out when
he called the Qantas public rela
tions department with this ques
tion. Three days later, he received
in the mail a mimeographed
Qantas press release titled "Why
there is no 'u' in Qantas."
Founded in 1920, Qantas is the
oldest airline in the English
speaking world. It originally pro
vided service only to a small area
of Northern Australia and was
named Queensland and Northern
Territory Aerial Services, Ltd.
Rather than deal with that
name everytime the airline was
referred to, the acronymic form
QANTAS was established soon
thereafter.
According to the release, "the
original name has long since lost
significance except as a reminder
of brave and difficult origins,
which may be why we feel such
affection for it."
Incidentally, there are 41 cities
indexed in Rand McNally's Pre
mier World Atlas which begin
with an un-'u'-sequented 'Q.' In
Asia, there's a country called
Qatar, which, I was told in high
school, is pronounced "gutter."
Webster's Third New Interna
tional Dictionary lists three un
'u'-sequented 'Q' words.
Until next week, the Bg has
spoken.
