## Maples farewell: Lichti, classmates beat USC 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
Saying goodbye is never an easy thing.
So the six seniors on Stanford's men's bas
ketball team did it the only way they knew
how: They left behind a win.
Playing their final game at Maples Pa
vilion, Todd Lichti, Bryan McSweeney,
Scott Meinert, Eric Reveno, Terry Taylor
and Howard Wright scored all but two of
Stanford's points as the Cardinal beat USC
in its final regular season game, 74-65,

Men's Basketball
Cardinal 74, Trojans 65

Stanford finished second in the Pacific
10 Conference with a 14-4 record, its high
est finish in conference play since 1964-65,
and ended up perfect at home (13-0) for
the fourth time in school history.
The 13th-ranked Cardinal, now 24-5
overall, next plays at the Pac-10 Tourna
ment in Los Angeles March 10 at 7 p.m.
against either the conference's 7th- or 10th
place team. Bids for the 64-team NCAA
tournament, which begins March 16, will
be announced before the Pac-10 Champi
onship game March 12.
Stanford will be riding a nine-game win
ning streak into the Pac-lOs after holding
off the last-place Trojans (9-10, 2-15 in the
Pac-10). Twenty minutes of emotional
pregame ceremonies honoring the Class of
'89 seemed to loosen the Cardinal players'
stiff upper lips, but a 22-0 run over 9:45
of the first half sufficed to put the game
on ice.
"I was afraid after the start of the game
we would not find the basket," Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said. "Early on,
it was tough with the tears, the emotion."
It didn't seem tough at first, as Lichti
(28 points and 11 rebounds) took his U.S.
Patent #42424242 move, a baseline drive
to a layup, to draw first blood for Stanford.
But USC took a 9-5 lead with 15:39 to
go as guard Anthony Pendleton (30 points)
made the first of his eight 3-pointers.
Pendleton would go on to break his own
conference record, set at Maples Pavilion
in December 1987, by attempting 19 3-
pointers in the game.
Pendleton would later score consecutive
baskets for USC: a conventional hoop at
the 12:30 mark of the first half, and an-

other 3-pointer at 2:45.
In between, Stanford scored 22 un
answered points, 10 of them by Wright,
highlighting the most emotional game of
his illustrious Stanford career.
"That pretty much sealed our doom,"
USC Coach George Raveling said. "I
thought that Wright just totally dominated
the game. He played like a guy that wanted
to leave a fond memory on the court."
Wright, who ranks third all-time at Stan
ford in rebounding and who needs 63 points
to become Stanford's second all-time
leading scorer behind Lichti, didn't deny it.
"Obviously the emotion was high, but
we just needed to concentrate on getting
the win," said Wright, who ended up with
19 points and 10 rebounds. "I can't imagine
a worse-case scenario than losing to anyone
on our last home game. I think I owed it
to the fans to finish strong. . . . Tonight
was especially sweet, especially rewarding."
Five of the seniors scored on the run,
including five points by Meinert on a 3-
pointer and a 16-foot bank, and two by
Taylor on a nifty fast-break reverse layup.
Pendleton finally broke USC's drought
by raining in a 22-footer, and then hit
another one from the corner just over a
minute later to cut Stanford's lead to 32-18.
Wright made a free throw to send Stanford
into the locker room with a 15-point lead,
but Pendleton wasn't done yet.
The 6-foot-4, 185-pounder hit five more
home runs in the second half, and at one
point he had 24 of the Trojans' 34 points.
If that weren't enough, another outside
blast by teammate Duane Cooper capped
a 21-9 run by USC, cutting Stanford's lead


Senior Terry Taylor, the Pac-10's all-time leader in three-point attempts and goals,
scored four points in his Maples Pavilion farewell game last night, including this

to 52-44 with 8:52 left.
Montgomery called a timeout
at that point, as if to remind the
players to come away with a win.
"I think guys wanted to make
plays " Montgomery said. "Guys
wanted to do something to get
the crowd going."
On the ensuing posession,
Liehti faked at the free-throw line,
then drove in for a layup off a
pass by Taylor and got fouled by
the Trojans' Ronnie Coleman
(who got the full five infractions
in the second half). Liehti com

pleted a three-point play of his
own, breaking USC's momentum.
"We had to kind of kick our
selves," Liehti said of the team's
trouble maintaining concentration
amid the season-finale hoopla. "I
tried not to let it be real emotion
al; I was trying to keep the team
on an even keel. The people have
been so good to me, I just wanted
to go out and play well."
Though the regular season ends
on an upbeat note, Liehti pointed
out that Stanford still needs "to
sharpen up a little bit."
"We're going to take a couple
of days off, just to make sure
we're fresh for the tourney,"
Liehti said.

Card notes
According to the Pac-10 tiebreaker
system, UCLA has clinched third
place ahead of Oregon State. The
Beavers, California, Washington and
Arizona State have also clinched their
current positions.
Thanks largely to the conference's
.677 winning percentage in non
conference games, the Pac-10 should
send four teams to the NCAAs for
the first time since 1985.
Oregon St. won its 20th last night
over Oregon, 73-69, and UCLA,
buoyed by its win over Louisville Feb.
12, should survive upset losses to UC-
Irvine, Arizona State and Notre Dame
to earn a bid. Incidentally, it says here
that the score of Saturday's game will
be UCLA 84, Arizona 80.

In between, Stanford scored 22 un

highlighting the most emotional game of
his illustrious Stanford career.
"That pretty much sealed our doom,"
USC Coach George Raveling said. "I
thought that Wright just totally dominated
the game. He played like a guy that wanted
to leave a fond memory on the court."
Wright, who ranks third all-time at Stan
ford in rebounding and who needs 63 points
to become Stanford's second all-time
leading scorer behind Lichti, didn't deny it.
"Obviously the emotion was high, but
we just needed to concentrate on getting
the win," said Wright, who ended up with
19 points and 10 rebounds. "I can't imagine
a worse-case scenario than losing to anyone
on our last home game. I think I owed it
to the fans to finish strong. . . . Tonight
was especially sweet, especially rewarding."

Wright made a free throw to send Stanford

but Pendleton wasn't done yet.
The 6-foot-4, 185-pounder hit five more

Montgomery called a timeout

On the ensuing posession,
Liehti faked at the free-throw line,
then drove in for a layup off a
pass by Taylor and got fouled by
the Trojans' Ronnie Coleman
(who got the full five infractions
in the second half). Liehti com

pleted a three-point play of his
own, breaking USC's momentum.
"We had to kind of kick our
selves," Liehti said of the team's
trouble maintaining concentration
amid the season-finale hoopla. "I
tried not to let it be real emotion
al; I was trying to keep the team
on an even keel. The people have
been so good to me, I just wanted
to go out and play well."
Though the regular season ends
on an upbeat note, Liehti pointed
out that Stanford still needs "to
sharpen up a little bit."
"We're going to take a couple
of days off, just to make sure
we're fresh for the tourney,"
Liehti said.

Card notes
According to the Pac-10 tiebreaker
system, UCLA has clinched third
place ahead of Oregon State. The
Beavers, California, Washington and
Arizona State have also clinched their
current positions.
Thanks largely to the conference's
.677 winning percentage in non
conference games, the Pac-10 should
send four teams to the NCAAs for
the first time since 1985.
Oregon St. won its 20th last night
over Oregon, 73-69, and UCLA,
buoyed by its win over Louisville Feb.
12, should survive upset losses to UC-

that the score of Saturday's game will
be UCLA 84, Arizona 80.

Cardinal 74, Trojans 65

Stanford finished second in the Pacific
10 Conference with a 14-4 record, its high
est finish in conference play since 1964-65,
and ended up perfect at home (13-0) for
the fourth time in school history.
The 13th-ranked Cardinal, now 24-5
overall, next plays at the Pac-10 Tourna
ment in Los Angeles March 10 at 7 p.m.
against either the conference's 7th- or 10th
place team. Bids for the 64-team NCAA
tournament, which begins March 16, will
be announced before the Pac-10 Champi
onship game March 12.
Stanford will be riding a nine-game win
ning streak into the Pac-lOs after holding
off the last-place Trojans (9-10, 2-15 in the
Pac-10). Twenty minutes of emotional
pregame ceremonies honoring the Class of
'89 seemed to loosen the Cardinal players'
stiff upper lips, but a 22-0 run over 9:45
of the first half sufficed to put the game
on ice.
"I was afraid after the start of the game
we would not find the basket," Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said. "Early on,
it was tough with the tears, the emotion."
It didn't seem tough at first, as Lichti
(28 points and 11 rebounds) took his U.S.
Patent #42424242 move, a baseline drive
to a layup, to draw first blood for Stanford.
But USC took a 9-5 lead with 15:39 to
go as guard Anthony Pendleton (30 points)
made the first of his eight 3-pointers.
Pendleton would go on to break his own
conference record, set at Maples Pavilion
in December 1987, by attempting 19 3-
pointers in the game.
Pendleton would later score consecutive
baskets for USC: a conventional hoop at
the 12:30 mark of the first half, and an-
