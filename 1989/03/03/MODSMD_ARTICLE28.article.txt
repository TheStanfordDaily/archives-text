# Six seniors say classy goodbye
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Last night, for perhaps the first
time all season, Stanford was hurt
by its lack of a fourth guard.
You see, with 1:18 to play,
Coach Mike Montgomery wanted
to pull five of his seniors to get
them one final ovation from the
Cardinal faithful in Maples Pavil
ion.
So Montgomery subbed in
Adam Keefe, John Patrick, Derek
Bruton and Deshon Wingate for
Todd Lichti, Howard Wright,
Bryan McSweeney and Eric
Reveno. But he couldn't pull
Terry Taylor because the team
lacked a fourth guard.
As he has all season, though,
Montgomery came up with a
quick solution. Scott Meinert, also
a member of the senior sextet,
had seemingly left the game for
good with 3:15 on the clock.
The crafty coach brought
Meinert back in with 31 seconds
to go (Andrew Vlahov replaced
Meinert nine seconds later).
Taylor got his exit and all was
well.
But, as everyone knows for all
to be well, it has to end well. For
the seniors, it was a grand finale
indeed, as they scored all but two
of the Cardinal's 74 points (Vlahov
scored a field goal five minutes
into the second half).
But the real story, as it has
been for four years, could be
summed up in two words — Lichti
and Wright.
Wright, the 6-foot-8 power for
ward, continued to display the
form that earned him Pacific 10
Conference Player of the Week
honors Monday. He scored 19
points on 6-of-10 shooting from
the field and a 7-of-10 mark from
the free-throw line.
Active on the glass all night,
Wright grabbed 10 rebounds, in
cluding four on the offensive end.
He also blocked three shots, made
two steals and dished out two as
sists.
"Wright just totally dominated
the game," USC Coach George
Raveling said. "|Hel played like a
guy who wanted to leave a fond
memory on the basketball court."
Said Wright: "I think I owed it
to family, to the fans, to myself

(to go out in style). Tonight was
especially sweet."
"He was really pumped up,"
Liehti said of his teammate. "I
think he was as emotional as
anyone before the game."
For Liehti, who said he "tried
not to let it be real emotional,"
it was also a stellar evening. The
6-4 guard scored 28 points with
his usual dazzling array of moves
to the basket.
Liehti also pulled down an 11
rebounds and dished out four as
sists.
Of his Maples swan song, Liehti
said, "Inside it was a real funny
feeling . . . the people here have

been so good to me."
And Liehti has been good to the
people — never turning down a
reporter, or an autograph-seeker,
or any of the countless people who
have placed demands on his time.
As a matter of fact, Liehti,
Wright, Reveno, Taylor, Meinert
and McSweeeney have all con
ducted themselves with class
while playing key roles in bringing
joy to the fans and bringing Stan
ford basketball to where it is
today.
That's why when Montgomery
says, "I'm about as proud of these
kids as I can be," you know it
comes from the heart.
