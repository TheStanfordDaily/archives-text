# No. 4 women's hoops sweeps into NCAAs as quiet favorite
## 
### 
So, just how good is the Stanford
women's basketball team, anyway?
Yes, the squad has become a fix
ture in the top four, is on the verge of
clinching the school's first Pacific 10 Con-

ference title this weekend and may well
become the first team to ever sweep the
league. En route to its second consecutive
20-plus win season, the Cardinal has

upended opponents by an average of 18.2
points per game, and has broken the 100-
point milestone three times this season.
But is Stanford really the No. 4 team
in the country, truly made of Final Four
material? Can the team really match-up
with traditional powers like Auburn, Ten
nessee and Texas with a chance of win
ning?
The answer is a resounding, unwaver
ing yes.
When the Cardinal demolished
Oregon State and Oregon this
past weekend, the squad proved
that it is indeed a contender for the na
tional crown. The Ducks and the Beavers
were the third- and fourth-place teams
in the Pac-10, yet homestanding Stanford
swatted each by over 30 points.
More significantly, however, the team
played with cohesion and fluidity. Stan
ford's run-and-gun style is a risky

proposition, creating many opportunities
for errors. Yet against Oregon, the Car
dinal scored 107 points with a mere seven
turnovers — phenomenal.
Even more convincing was the bal
ance that Coach Tara VanDer
veer's troops demonstrated. In Sat
urday's Duck-roasting, for instance, 11
out of the 12 players suited up contrib
uted points to the effort. Five of them,
including four starters, reached double
figures.
In fact, subtracting Jill Yanke and add
ing Sonja Henning, four of the starters
have logged double-figure scoring
averages for the season. Jennifer Azzi
and Katy Steding have vacillated as the
team's leading scorer, but neither have
averaged more than 16 points per game.
Every other team in the Pac-10 has at
least one player scoring in the 18 ppg
range. While that is fantastic for the in

dividuals in question, it has done little
to hedge the Cardinal's Pac-10 title bid.
With balance, Stanford has gone much
further, and will continue to do so.
Entertaining criticism, Stanford's
Pac-10 standing may not be all
that impressive on the national
scene. Except for Washington, which has
yet to emerge from the purgatory of "Also
Receiving Votes" status, none of the Car
dinal's league rivals is nationally ranked.
Basically, the critics bleat, Stanford is
beating up on a bunch of weaklings. The
Cardinal last faced a top-20 team in late
1988, hardly a good indicator of current
standing.
On paper, at least, the criticism seems
valid. However, if any of the critics had
attended last weekend's reign of terror
in Maples Pavilion, the doubting would
end. Facing radically different teams —
the relentless, pressing Beavers and the

towering Ducks — the Cardinal executed
equally well.
The showmanship, ability and inspira
tion was there. Come NCAA Tournament
time, when something truly important
rests on every game, these qualities will
continue to manifest themselves in stellar
fashion.
Stanford is, indeed, a Final Four
caliber team. The squad's fate rests in
its hands.
P.S.: The game with USC, originally
slated to be the season finale, has
been moved to Thursday to accom
odate ESPN scheduling.
Tipoff time is at 9 p.m. at Maples.
Come check out the Cardinal and make
your own judgment — as the cliche says,
seeing is believing.
