# Anti-Semitic leaflets linked to associate of David Duke

### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
There may be a relationship between David Duke,
the former Ku Klux Klan member recently elected
to the Louisiana State House of Representatives,
and anti-Semitic fliers at Stanford.
A close associate of Duke who is also a former
Klan member, James Warner, heads an organization
that was listed on anti-Semitic fliers distributed in
January on cars parked around the Oval.
The organization, The Sons of Liberty, is a mail
order book service featuring anti-Semitic and racist
materials that operates out of Metairie, La., the
town that recently propelled Duke to political power.
Duke is president of the National Association for
the Advancement of White People, which is also
headquartered in Metairie.
Neither Duke nor Warner are currently members
