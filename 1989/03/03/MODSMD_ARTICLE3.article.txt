# Anti-Semitic leaflets linked to associate of David Duke

There may be a relationship between David Duke,
the former Ku Klux Klan member recently elected
to the Louisiana State House of Representatives,
and anti-Semitic fliers at Stanford.
A close associate of Duke who is also a former
Klan member, James Warner, heads an organization
that was listed on anti-Semitic fliers distributed in
January on cars parked around the Oval.
The organization, The Sons of Liberty, is a mail
order book service featuring anti-Semitic and racist
materials that operates out of Metairie, La., the
town that recently propelled Duke to political power.
Duke is president of the National Association for
the Advancement of White People, which is also
headquartered in Metairie.
Neither Duke nor Warner are currently members
of the Klan, and receptionists in
Warner's office answering several
calls from The Daily over the past
two weeks maintained that he was
unavailable for comment.
According to The Times-
Picayune, a New Orleans news
paper, Duke and Warner have
been closely linked for years.
Warner moved to Metairie in
1976 and became a member of
the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,
a KKK group that Duke founded
three years earlier and that spear
headed the 1970s resurgance of
the Klan, according to the Anti-
Defamation League.
The ADL is a Jewish organiza
tion that publishes information
about anti-Semitic groups as part
of its work to oppose bigotry.
ADL files show that Warner left
Duke's group in 1977 to found
the anti-Semitic New Christian
Crusade Church, which later
issued a letter saying that the
Knights "Do absolutely nothing,
yet receive all the publicity."

Warner and Duke nevertheless
maintain "a very close relation
ship and have been active together
for a long time," said Danny
Welsh of Klan Watch, a subdivi
sion of the Southern Poverty Law
Center in Montgomery, Ala.
Duke was one of the speakers
for a July 1987 conference in
Tampa, Fla., sponsored by
Warner's Christian Defense
League, which Warner set up as
an associate organization of his
church, according to the ADL.
The ADL says that in recent
years Duke and Warner were pos
sibly working on consolidating
their groups along with the Na
tional Socialization Liberation
Front, an Aryan group, according
to Welsh. But they dropped the
idea around the time Duke began
campaigning for the 1988 Demo
cratic presidential nomination.
Duke was eventually elected to
the Louisiana House of Represen
tatives on the Republican ticket,
although the Republican National
Committee is trying to wash its
hands of him.
According to the Anti-
Defamation League, Warner is a

"long-time anti-Jewish agitator."
In 1969 he opened a Sons of
Liberty bookstore in Hollywood,
Calif., specializing in "rare and
not-so-rare anti-Semitic litera
ture", according to Welsh.
