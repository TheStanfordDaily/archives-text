## 
### Doug Boeschen Staff writer 
After a near-perfect regular
season, the Stanford men's fenc
ing team will have an opportunity
this Saturday to prove that their
No. 1 ranking in the West is well
deserved as they take on the best
regional teams in the Western Re
gional Championships.
Beginning at 9:00 a.m. Satur
day at Roble Gym, the tourna
ment will feature top fencers
competing for individual and team
titles and the right to attend the
NCAA Championships at North
western University.
Undefeated this year in regional
competition, the Cardinal men are
the favorites to win the team
regional title. Stanford Coach
Zoran Tulum reaffirmed the
team's season goal of "looking for
ward to winning the Regionals."
Epee captain Steve Schmidt
agreed that "if the team is fencing
well, we should win."
The team will be fighting the
six varsity teams from the region.
The top competition should be
UC-Santa Cruz, Air Force and
Long Beach State. Sabre captain
Mike Cramer is confident because
Stanford has already beaten
defending champion Long Beach
State in competition earlier this
season.
But team manager Jim Farrell
said the team realizes that the
competition won't be a
"cakewalk." In two matches with
UC-Santa Cruz this year the Car
dinal men came away with narrow
one-point victories and they have
not yet faced the powerful Air

be tough as the other teams will
be fielding strong epee squads.

Nick B ravin and Leonard
D'Amico — both just returned
from qualifying for the United
States Junior Olympic Team.
Both fencers are expected to take
the individual titles at the
regional competition and move on
to the national tournament.

needs to get psyched up" if they
are going to win. "The other
teams always come ready, hut we
have more talent."

D'Amico for sabre; Steve Schmidt,
Lee Tankersley and Peter
