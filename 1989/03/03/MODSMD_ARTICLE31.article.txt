## Gymnasts to battle UCLA 
### 
Tonight, the four best men's
gymnastics teams in the Pacific
10 Conference, two of them
prime contenders for the NCAA
Championship, will convene at
Maples Pavilion for Stanford's
final home meet of the season.
The Cardinal (12-3) is cur
rently ranked either No. 1 or
No. 10, depending on how you
look at it.
"It's fair to say the average
of our three best meets is the
highest in the nation," Cardi
nal Head Coach Sadao Hamada
said despite his team's No. 10
ranking in the latest NCAA
standings.
Those rankings do not take
into account competitions
which have taken place over
the last week and a half.
Among these competitions are
Stanford's best of the year, in
cluding a 280.15 point perform
ance Wednesday night at
Berkeley, which is among the
nation's top single meet scores
of the season.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
No. 3 UCLA was also at
Berkeley and turned in a
280.95 score to edge the Car
dinal. This evening at 7:30
p.m., the two will clash again.
"When we first met them,
they were way ahead of us,
Hamada said. "Now, we're
even, but I think we have an
edge because we are climbing.

They are maintaining the same
level."
California and Arizona State
will also be at tonight's meet,
where three of the nation's top
individual performers, UCLA's
David St. Pierre, and the Car
dinal's Tim Ryan and Conrad
Voorsanger, should take the
spotlight.
The three make an odd trio.
St. Pierre and Voorsanger both
perform exceptionally artful
routines, maintaining nearly
flawless body control. Ryan is
listed at thirty pounds heavier
than either of them, yet he is
only two inches taller. His
power is as remarkable as their
virtuosity.

travel to OSU meet
According to senior co
captain Sheri Evenson, win
ning the Pacific Ten Confer
ence gymnastics meet at
Oregon State this weekend will
be no problem for the Stanford
women's gymnastics team if
they do just one thing: hit all
their routines.
However, consistency has
not been the team's strong
