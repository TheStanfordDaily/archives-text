## Gymnasts to battle UCLA 
### 
Tonight, the four best men's
gymnastics teams in the Pacific
10 Conference, two of them
prime contenders for the NCAA
Championship, will convene at
Maples Pavilion for Stanford's
final home meet of the season.
The Cardinal (12-3) is cur
rently ranked either No. 1 or
No. 10, depending on how you
look at it.
"It's fair to say the average
of our three best meets is the
highest in the nation," Cardi
nal Head Coach Sadao Hamada
said despite his team's No. 10
ranking in the latest NCAA
standings.
Those rankings do not take
into account competitions
which have taken place over
the last week and a half.
Among these competitions are
Stanford's best of the year, in
cluding a 280.15 point perform
ance Wednesday night at
Berkeley, which is among the
nation's top single meet scores
of the season.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
No. 3 UCLA was also at
Berkeley and turned in a
280.95 score to edge the Car
dinal. This evening at 7:30
p.m., the two will clash again.
"When we first met them,
they were way ahead of us,
Hamada said. "Now, we're
even, but I think we have an
edge because we are climbing.

They are maintaining the same
level."
California and Arizona State
will also be at tonight's meet,
where three of the nation's top
individual performers, UCLA's
David St. Pierre, and the Car
dinal's Tim Ryan and Conrad
Voorsanger, should take the
spotlight.
The three make an odd trio.
St. Pierre and Voorsanger both
perform exceptionally artful
routines, maintaining nearly
flawless body control. Ryan is
listed at thirty pounds heavier
than either of them, yet he is
only two inches taller. His
power is as remarkable as their
virtuosity.

Women tumblers to
travel to OSU meet
According to senior co
captain Sheri Evenson, win
ning the Pacific Ten Confer
ence gymnastics meet at
Oregon State this weekend will
be no problem for the Stanford
women's gymnastics team if
they do just one thing: hit all
their routines.
However, consistency has
not been the team's strong
point. For example, last Saturday,
the team scored a 188 to set an
all-time school record and kept
Stanford within two points of Pac
-10 powerhouse Arizona at the
Hobee Invitational. Monday
night, on the other hand, the
squad fell to a dismal 181.9, a
performance for which Coach
Homer Sardina had "no ex
cuse. ... I was quite disap
pointed."
Monday night's meet in Salt
Lake City ended up with Stanford
taking third place, behind top
ranked Utah (191.00) and Okla
homa (187.35) and just edging
New Mexico (180.25).
Some highlights of Stanford's
performance were three missed
routines on the uneven bars; four
misses on balance beam, an event
that has turned into the team's
Achille's heel; and Evenson's
lowest all-around score of the
season.
Of the Utah meet, Sardina said,
"There is not much we can say
or do about it. . . . This is the kind
of meet you want to forget."
The team's mental preparation
for the Pac-10 meet, then, has a
lot to do with forgetting. Senior
Cheryl Doo said that they lacked
energy and concentration in Utah:

"It wasn't so good. We need better
attitudes." Evenson added, "Mon
day is over and done with."

Golf teams ready for
weekend tournaments
There is no lull before Dead
Week for Stanford's golf teams as
both squads are in action over
the next few days in a pair of
northern California tournaments.
The 16th-ranked women's team
plays today in a tough contest in
San Jose while the men head
north for a tournament at
Sacramento State beginning on
Monday.
The women tee off this morning
in the first round of the three-day
Lady Spartan Invitational hosted
by San Jose State. The Spartans
are a familiar opponent to the Car
dinal as Stanford has finished
their last two tournaments one
place behind San Jose State.
Coach Wally Goodwin's men's
team decided to forego this week
end's Border Olympics tourna
ment in Texas which they were
originally scheduled to play. The
team will instead play a marathon
of sorts as the Sacramento tour
nament will be a two-day affair
on two courses.

Hobee Invitational. Monday
night, on the other hand, the
squad fell to a dismal 181.9, a
performance for which Coach
Homer Sardina had "no ex
cuse. ... I was quite disap
pointed."
Monday night's meet in Salt
Lake City ended up with Stanford
taking third place, behind top
ranked Utah (191.00) and Okla
homa (187.35) and just edging
New Mexico (180.25).
Some highlights of Stanford's
performance were three missed
routines on the uneven bars; four
misses on balance beam, an event
that has turned into the team's
Achille's heel; and Evenson's
lowest all-around score of the
season.
Of the Utah meet, Sardina said,
"There is not much we can say
or do about it. . . . This is the kind
of meet you want to forget."
The team's mental preparation
for the Pac-10 meet, then, has a
lot to do with forgetting. Senior
Cheryl Doo said that they lacked
energy and concentration in Utah:

"It wasn't so good. We need better
attitudes." Evenson added, "Mon
day is over and done with."

Golf teams ready for
weekend tournaments
There is no lull before Dead
Week for Stanford's golf teams as
both squads are in action over
the next few days in a pair of
northern California tournaments.
The 16th-ranked women's team
plays today in a tough contest in
San Jose while the men head
north for a tournament at
Sacramento State beginning on
Monday.
The women tee off this morning
in the first round of the three-day
Lady Spartan Invitational hosted
by San Jose State. The Spartans
are a familiar opponent to the Car
dinal as Stanford has finished
their last two tournaments one
place behind San Jose State.
Coach Wally Goodwin's men's
team decided to forego this week
end's Border Olympics tourna
ment in Texas which they were
originally scheduled to play. The
team will instead play a marathon
of sorts as the Sacramento tour
nament will be a two-day affair
on two courses.

Tonight, the four best men's
gymnastics teams in the Pacific
10 Conference, two of them
prime contenders for the NCAA
Championship, will convene at
Maples Pavilion for Stanford's
final home meet of the season.
The Cardinal (12-3) is cur
rently ranked either No. 1 or
No. 10, depending on how you
look at it.
"It's fair to say the average
of our three best meets is the
highest in the nation," Cardi
nal Head Coach Sadao Hamada
said despite his team's No. 10
ranking in the latest NCAA
standings.
Those rankings do not take
into account competitions
which have taken place over
the last week and a half.
Among these competitions are
Stanford's best of the year, in
cluding a 280.15 point perform
ance Wednesday night at
Berkeley, which is among the
nation's top single meet scores
of the season.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
No. 3 UCLA was also at
Berkeley and turned in a
280.95 score to edge the Car
dinal. This evening at 7:30
p.m., the two will clash again.
"When we first met them,
they were way ahead of us,
Hamada said. "Now, we're
even, but I think we have an
edge because we are climbing.

They are maintaining the same
level."
California and Arizona State
will also be at tonight's meet,
where three of the nation's top
individual performers, UCLA's
David St. Pierre, and the Car
dinal's Tim Ryan and Conrad
Voorsanger, should take the
spotlight.
The three make an odd trio.
St. Pierre and Voorsanger both
perform exceptionally artful
routines, maintaining nearly
flawless body control. Ryan is
listed at thirty pounds heavier
than either of them, yet he is
only two inches taller. His
power is as remarkable as their
virtuosity.

Women tumblers to
travel to OSU meet
According to senior co
captain Sheri Evenson, win
ning the Pacific Ten Confer
ence gymnastics meet at
Oregon State this weekend will
be no problem for the Stanford
women's gymnastics team if
they do just one thing: hit all
their routines.
However, consistency has
not been the team's strong
point. For example, last Saturday,
the team scored a 188 to set an
all-time school record and kept
Stanford within two points of Pac
-10 powerhouse Arizona at the
Hobee Invitational. Monday
night, on the other hand, the
squad fell to a dismal 181.9, a
performance for which Coach
Homer Sardina had "no ex
cuse. ... I was quite disap
pointed."
