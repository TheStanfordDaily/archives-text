# Asforis, Yanke, Wagner wrapping up Stanford careers
## 
### Evan Tushinsky Senior staff writer 
With the regular season entering its final stretch,
this is a time of bittersweet celebration for the
Stanford women's basketball team.
On the positive side: A 22-2 record, a school-high
No. 4 ranking on the Associated Press poll, an
unbeaten Pacific 10 Conference record that could
easily develop into the Cardinal's first league title

and season sweep, and the chance to earn top-seed
.status of the West Region in the NCAA Tournament.
On the negative side: three of the team's
rebuilders — namely seniors Evon Asforis, Jill
Yanke and Emily Wagner — will be playing in their
final regular season games for the Cardinal over
the next two weeks.
It would seem at first glance that the positives
overwhelmingly overshadow the negative. Of the
three, Yanke is the sole starter, and none is atop
any Stanford statistical category.
For the team and its coaches, however, the trio
that will graduate this spring will be a group sorely
missed, a loss that will weigh heavily on the
hermetically-close squad. Transcending numbers,
each senior has contributed to Stanford's rise to
basketball prominence.
"It's hard for me to think of a team without Jill
and Evon, because that's all I've known," VanDer
veer reflected. "It's hard for me to think of them
not coming to practice every day. Stanford basketball
for me has always had those people playing. Emily
was hurt her first few years here, but Evon and
Jill are just standard."
Wagner's playing time has been greatly curtailed
by a knee injury she incurred prior to her freshman
year. After sitting out several seasons, however, the
5-9 guard and native of Pleasant Ridge, Mich., has
seen extensive action in the past two weeks.
Asforis has also rebounded from knee injury to
become one of the pivotal players on the Stanford
roster, logging an average of 18 minutes per game.
Though not a regular starter, the 6-2 forward from
Queen's Village, N.Y., has been a force on defense
and an avid rebound collector.
Yanke, a 6-5 center from Boise, Idaho, will be
remembered as one of the great players in Stanford
women's basketball history. Though her scoring
averages this season are lower than expected, Yanke
still rates seventh on the school career scoring list
with 1,099 points.
The common denominator for all three is that
while individual acclaim has been subordinated by
a more evenly balanced team than competed at
Stanford three years ago, each has maintained the
optimism and spirit that inspired them to help
revive an ailing, unknown Stanford program.
"It says a lot of Emily, Jill and Evon that they
want this to be their best year, and they're willing

to make sacrifices to do that," VanDerveer said.
"Especially in Jill's case, we've changed the offense
so she's not scoring as much as she did in the past
few years. We've changed things on our team, so
maybe they don't stand out as much as they did,
say, as freshmen."
Change, however, is nothing new to the senior
trio. With the exception of Wagner, it was the coach
that VanDerveer replaced, Dotty McCrea, that
recruited the group. They were aware of VanDer
veer's hiring and her reputation, but Asforis and
Yanke had little idea what to expect when they
arrived at the first fall practice.
The same was true for VanDerveer. Inheriting a
team of players she did not recruit, including the
incoming freshman class, the Ohio State ex-officio
found herself surprisingly blessed.
"That's what they call lucky inheritance," Van-
Derveer said, smiling. "You just step in it sometimes.
They are people I didn't recruit, but I wish 1 had.
"That's not the situation most times — when a
new coach takes over a team, it's usually because
there are problems. I was fortunate in that respect."
With their hard work and inspiration, Stanford
has become one of the top programs in the nation.
Over the course of the seniors' stay at Stanford,
the Cardinal has moved from the Pac-10 basement
to the penthouse suite, with the chance to clinch
the school's first conference title ever.
Four years ago, all of this success was just a
dream for Yanke, Asforis and Wagner. Times have
changed.
"When I came to Stanford, I just knew that
basketball was up-and-coming," Asforis recalled. "1

always knew it would get better, but not to what
extent or what degree. I just knew that I wanted
to get the best education possible and that I wanted
to help out and contribute in their success."
Like her classmates, Asforis has done just that.

On the negative side: three of the team's
rebuilders — namely seniors Evon Asforis, Jill
Yanke and Emily Wagner — will be playing in their
final regular season games for the Cardinal over
the next two weeks.
It would seem at first glance that the positives
overwhelmingly overshadow the negative. Of the
three, Yanke is the sole starter, and none is atop
any Stanford statistical category.
For the team and its coaches, however, the trio
that will graduate this spring will be a group sorely
missed, a loss that will weigh heavily on the
hermetically-close squad. Transcending numbers,
each senior has contributed to Stanford's rise to
basketball prominence.
"It's hard for me to think of a team without Jill
and Evon, because that's all I've known," VanDer
veer reflected. "It's hard for me to think of them
not coming to practice every day. Stanford basketball
for me has always had those people playing. Emily
was hurt her first few years here, but Evon and
Jill are just standard."
Wagner's playing time has been greatly curtailed
by a knee injury she incurred prior to her freshman
year. After sitting out several seasons, however, the
5-9 guard and native of Pleasant Ridge, Mich., has
seen extensive action in the past two weeks.
Asforis has also rebounded from knee injury to
become one of the pivotal players on the Stanford
roster, logging an average of 18 minutes per game.
Though not a regular starter, the 6-2 forward from
Queen's Village, N.Y., has been a force on defense
and an avid rebound collector.
Yanke, a 6-5 center from Boise, Idaho, will be
remembered as one of the great players in Stanford
women's basketball history. Though her scoring
averages this season are lower than expected, Yanke
still rates seventh on the school career scoring list
with 1,099 points.
The common denominator for all three is that
while individual acclaim has been subordinated by
a more evenly balanced team than competed at
Stanford three years ago, each has maintained the
optimism and spirit that inspired them to help
revive an ailing, unknown Stanford program.
"It says a lot of Emily, Jill and Evon that they
want this to be their best year, and they're willing

to make sacrifices to do that," VanDerveer said.
"Especially in Jill's case, we've changed the offense
so she's not scoring as much as she did in the past
few years. We've changed things on our team, so
maybe they don't stand out as much as they did,
say, as freshmen."
Change, however, is nothing new to the senior
trio. With the exception of Wagner, it was the coach
that VanDerveer replaced, Dotty McCrea, that
recruited the group. They were aware of VanDer
veer's hiring and her reputation, but Asforis and
Yanke had little idea what to expect when they
arrived at the first fall practice.
The same was true for VanDerveer. Inheriting a
team of players she did not recruit, including the
incoming freshman class, the Ohio State ex-officio
found herself surprisingly blessed.
"That's what they call lucky inheritance," Van-
Derveer said, smiling. "You just step in it sometimes.
They are people I didn't recruit, but I wish 1 had.
"That's not the situation most times — when a
new coach takes over a team, it's usually because
there are problems. I was fortunate in that respect."
With their hard work and inspiration, Stanford
has become one of the top programs in the nation.
Over the course of the seniors' stay at Stanford,
the Cardinal has moved from the Pac-10 basement
to the penthouse suite, with the chance to clinch
the school's first conference title ever.
Four years ago, all of this success was just a
dream for Yanke, Asforis and Wagner. Times have
changed.
"When I came to Stanford, I just knew that
basketball was up-and-coming," Asforis recalled. "1

always knew it would get better, but not to what
extent or what degree. I just knew that I wanted
to get the best education possible and that I wanted
to help out and contribute in their success."
Like her classmates, Asforis has done just that.

Here is the latest on guard Stacy Parson's iryury: Tests
confirmed that the junior is indeed suffering from a stress
fracture in her lower leg. However, according to trainer
Patti Millson, Parson will be able to see limited action
in the upcoming weeks.

Senior Evon Asforis will be sorely missed next
year for her rebounding and aggressive defense.
With the regular season entering its final stretch,
this is a time of bittersweet celebration for the
Stanford women's basketball team.
On the positive side: A 22-2 record, a school-high
No. 4 ranking on the Associated Press poll, an
unbeaten Pacific 10 Conference record that could
easily develop into the Cardinal's first league title

and season sweep, and the chance to earn top-seed
.status of the West Region in the NCAA Tournament.
