# Struggling baseball team hosts ASU
## 
### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
"Baseball in general is a very con
tagious game."
If Stanford Asst. Coach Dean Stotz
is right, then Cardinal bats are currently
suffering from a bit of the plague.
Unranked Stanford (10-10 overall, 1-2
in league play) will try to find the vac
cine for its ills this weekend as it hosts
a three-game set against No. 7 Arizona
State (14-5, 3-0), one of the favorites
in the pacific 10 Conferee
Division * tr* ir
"Sometimes <pou can go into a team
slump. It's most of the guys in the
lineup. Most of us are filled with frus
tration," junior shortstop Troy Paulsen
said.
"When a team's frustrated hitting,
you try harder and harder. When you're
pressing you jump out at the ball. You
say, 'I gotta hit, I gotta hit.' It causes
you to want a hit so bad you leap at
the ball or expose your hands too soon,
or any number of things," he added.
Among the upperclassmen in the Car
dinal starting lineup, only senior Frank
Carey and junior Tim Griffin have been
consistent at the plate.
"They've been staying within them
selves. They're not trying to do any
more than what they're best at. They're
both real solid hitters. They're not going
to get in real bad slumps," Paulsen said.
If the Cardinal is going to bust loose
at the plate against ASU, the other
three veteran starters will have to follow
the example of Carey and Griffin.
"The freshmen have done their job.
It's the veterans who have to do it day
in and day out. When you're a freshman
you're going to have bad periods," Paul
sen said.
"Paul (Carey) and I are making
strides at the plate. And B.J. (Brian

Johnson) is getting it going. If the five
of us get rolling, the team will follow.
It's going to take a day like (Tuesday)
against a quality team."
Tuesday the Cardinal showed signs
of finding a remedy for its troubles. A
12-4 rout of overmatched USF was
fueled by two-run homers from juniors
Paul Carey and Johnson. The left
handed hitting Carey drove his shot
deep to left-center field, and when Carey
is right, left-center is his power alley.
"He hit .330 with 12 homers (last
season) doing that. He has been going
the other way recently," Palusen said.
"He was trying to experiment with
pulling the ball, to take away the inside

pitch. If he can get that down, he'll be
in the show. Scouts just drool over the
opposite field power," Paulsen said.
"The show," for those of you who
have yet to see Bull Durham, is the
players' name for the Major Leagues.
With Paul Carey going to the opposite
field, Johnson clearly coming come out
of his early-season slumber — he has
an eight-game hitting streak and was
4-for-9 against California last weekend
— and Paulsen hitting everything up
the middle of the diamond, the Cardinal
just may awaken this weekend.
"It looks good for this weekend. We're
going to open up and start hitting,"
Paulsen said.

tagious game."
