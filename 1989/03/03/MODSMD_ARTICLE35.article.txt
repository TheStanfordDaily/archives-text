Spencer, So., RH (0-3, 3.94). Sunday, Sean Rees, Fr., LH (2-1, 4.11) vs. TBA
SERIES — ASU is the only team in the Six-Pac that holds a winning record against
the Cardinal The Devils won five of seven from Stanford last season and lead the
series 32-30, 31-29 since Six-Pac play started in 1979. In games played at Sunken

DEVIL UPDATE — Senior Dan 15 RBI) and freshman Mike Kelley
(.329, 5, 25) lead the Sun Devil attack Sophomore Steve Martin is batting .364, and
senior John Finn is at 305 and is a perfect 10-for-10 in steal attempts.
STANFORD UPDATE — Mike Mussina is coming off the best Six-Pac outing of his career
last Friday against California. He pitched a two-hit shutout and had a career-high 12
strikeouts. Last Sunday Stan Spencer pitched 7% innings of three-hit ball before the
Bears finally got to him for three runs Sophomore Scott Weiss took a no-hitter into
the sixth Saturday before surrendering two runs. Weiss and freshman Steve Worrell
are the top candidates to start on Sunday.
KEYS TO VICTORY — According to Stanford Asst Coach Dean Stotz, "You have to
somehow control their older players. They have quite a tradition over there. Their
older guys are used to winning." That includes Rumsey and Finn, who are currently
hot. Stanford will try to turn things around at the plate against a barrage of left-handed
pitchers "We haven't gone against much left-handed pitching, so this weekend will
be a real test," Stotz said. "Some of the best swings against them come from
left-handed batters because of the screwball action (on their pitches). Kilgo may have
the best screwball in college baseball. It drives you crazy."
