# Swimmers face Cal in meets

### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women's swim team is
living life right.
With the annual California and Stan
ford Invitational meets coming up this
weekend, Cardinal and California swim
mers have their last two chances to make
the qualifying times for the NCAA
Championships March 16-18 in In
dianapolis.
But, for perhaps the first time ever,
Stanford already has the fuii numb* of
NCAA qualifiers. A team may only bring
17 swimmers to the NCAA meet and
after last weekend's Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships, handily won by the
Cardinal, Stanford has 18 qualifiers.
Coach Richard Quick is thus faced
with the unenviable task of chosing one
swimmer to leave off the NCAA travel
ing squad, but three women will try to
make his choice even tougher by throw
ing their names into the hat.
The Cal Invitational begins at 2 p.m.
today at the Spieker Natatorium in
Berkeley. The Stanford Invitational
begins Saturday morning at 10:30 at
the deGuerre Pool Complex. These are
the final meets before the NCAA meet.
Quick said that four Cardinal fresh
men will be competing Friday at
Berkeley. Erika Moone, who finished
sixth in the 200-yard butterfly at the
Pac-10 meet, will attempt to make her
cut in that event; Michelle David will
swim both the 50 and 100 freestyles;
Valerie Paz Soldan will swim the 500
and 1650 freestyles and Eva Mortensen
will also swim the 1650.
Mortensen has already qualified for
the NCAA meet based upon her time
in the 400-meter freestyle in the 1988
Olympics, where she competed for Den
mark, but she will trv to come in under

the NCAA cut again, during the season,
instead of relying on her time from Sep
tember.
For the Golden Bears, things are much
different. While Stanford easily qualified
all five relays, the Bears have not qual
ified their 400 freestyle relay squad
(they missed by .30 seconds in the Pac-10
finals then missed by .39 seconds half
an hour later in the Trojan Invitational
in the same pool). Kristin Winn, Lisa
Meyers, Amy Tidball and Sarah Ander
son will be swimming that relay for
California.
Also swimming for the Golden Bears,
who have nine NCAA qualifiers already,
are Kristin Kuhlman and Edwina Lerner
in both the 100 backstroke and the 100
butterfly, Megan Doberneck in the 100
breaststroke, and Meyers and Winn in
the 200 freestyle.
