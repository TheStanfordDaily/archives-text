# Former Klansman's group distributed fliers here

The Sons of Liberty fliers distributed here
early this quarter were "the first manifestation
in recent months" of the group's activities in
the Bay Area, according to Richard Hirschhaut,
director of the Anti-Defamation League's
Pacific chapter.
The organization had been relatively inactive
for several years until near this time last year,
when anti-Semitic leader James Warner sent
a Sons of Liberty booklist to book
sellers across the country.
The message on anti-Semitic
fliers distributed here early this
quarter had a similar theme to
those books on the list, equating
Zionism with communism and
calling Israel "the Anti-Christ
State."
Although the Sons of Liberty's
name and address is printed on
the fliers, the organization has
not acknowledged responsibility
for the fliers.
Hirschhaut said the leaflet dis
tribution may not have been or
ganized in Louisiana. A local skin
head group may have simply
adopted material from Warner.
