# Grad students lead recycling revival
## 
### Susan Infantino 
Recycling is big at Stanford
bigger than ever. On the heels of
a January campus recycling-high
of 114.9 tons of material, graduate
students from Escondido Village
lead the way among Stanford
recyclers for February.
A steady rise in recycling totals
this year is credited to increased
student awareness, which has
been fueled by media attention.
January's "You Can Make a Dif
ference" conference on the envi
ronment and a stronger focus on
recycling by residential energy
representatives contributed to the
increase as well.
Stanford's recycling system is
considered one of the top three
college centers in the country,
along with those at the University
of Colorado-Boulder and Rutgers
University, according to Barb
Voss, co-manager of the Stanford
Recycling Center.
The University saves $20 to $2.5
for every ton of material recycled,
Voss said. Campus recycling is
also saving space in the Palo Alto
dump, which is scheduled to fill
within the next six to nine years.
When the dump reaches
capacity, Stanford waste removal
costs will skyrocket. The Univer

sity will have to either direct-haul
its waste to dumps up to 60
minutes away or take waste to a
transfer station in Sunnyvale.
"For students who recycle right
now, the payback will be for stu
dents 10 years from now," Voss
said.
While information on the total
campus recycling for February is
not yet available, figures released
yesterday by the recycling center
show that four Escondido Village
high-rises top the list of residences
with the highest amount of recy
cling per resident.
Theta Chi House, first in a list
of seven row houses directly fol
lowing the Escondido Village res
idences, recycled the largest
amount of material for an under
graduate residence. Wilbur Hall
dormitories Madera, Okada,
Otero and Rinconada, along with
Crothers Memorial, recycled the
least per resident.
Graduate students use a larger
amount of materials in daily
housekeeping than the average
undergraduate, according to Voss.
This usage and graduate students'
generally higher awareness of en
ergy conservation issues usually
results in more recycling by grad-
uate than undergraduate residen
ces, she said.
Dormitories, the majority of
which had the lowest statistics on
amount of material recycled, can
improve by following some of the
packet's guidelines:
• Add recycling receptacles for
new materials (like white paper),
• Convince dorm residents to
label the trash cans in their rooms
with "Garbage Only" and "Recycl
ables Only" signs,
• Make a presentation at vour
dorm meeting about recycling and
waste reduction,
• Promote the use of recycled
paper at your dorm office, for
your dorm newsletter and in your
computer rooms.
