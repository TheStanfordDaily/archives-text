# Film maker spikes his art with politics
## 
### Raoul Mowatt Staff writer 
They had to have it.
A capacity crowd came from
all over the Bay Area to Kresge
Auditorium last night to get it.
There, they heard film
maker Spike Lee speak about
art and politics. As one of the
most prominent black produc
ers today, Lee drew from per
sonal experience in an hour
long question and answer ses
sion sponsored by the ASSU
Speakers Bureau, Afro-
American Studies and the
Black Liberation Month Com
mittee.
Lee concluded that black pro
ducers face treatment as
second-class citizens, but must
try to restore black unity and
pride nevertheless.
Lee is the mind behind two
movies, "She's Gotta Have It"
and "School Daze," which he
directed, produced, wrote and
starred in. He is also the co
founder of the production com
pany Forty Acres and a Mule,
which refers to the compensa
tion newly-freed blacks re
ceived during Reconstruction.
He has recently finished
work on a third movie, "Do the
Right Thing," which is sched
uled for release Julv 21. Lee is

also contributing to a film au
tobiography of Malcolm X.
Lee said black artists have a
special role to play in bolstering
black pride. His movies explore
areas of black life — such as
the hierarchy between light
and dark-skinned blacks —
that Hollywood often ignores.
"I have never underes
timated the power of filming
(to create positive or negative
images) ... I don't make
movies to become wealthy,"
Lee said.
Because many studios fear
that movies with black leads
will not attract customers to
the box office, Lee said, they
are unwilling to spend as much
on promoting those films. In
turn, since few people are
aware of the movies, the
studios create self-fulfilling
prophesies.
Also speaking last night,
Monty Ross, the co-founder of
Lee's film company, joined Lee
in defending their films against
criticism of their unique style.
"The critics really bother me,
because they don't understand.
It's evident from reading
reviews that they have no clue
as to what we (blacks) are
about as a people at all," Lee
added.
