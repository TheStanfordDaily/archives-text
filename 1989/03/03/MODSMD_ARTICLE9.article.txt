# Pauling's decree: Take Vitamin C and tie the knot

What docs 88-year-old Linus
Pauling — two-time Nobel
laureate and authority on virtu
ally every scientific subject — rec
ommend for the typical over
achieving, confused, young science
student at Stanford?
Besides lots of vitamin C,
Pauling advises a return to the
fundamental sciences and a dedi
cation to an even more fundamen
tal science — the science of
marriage.
In a recent interview with The
Daily at the Linus Pauling Insti
tute in Palo Alto, the Nobel
laureate offered advice for under
graduates soon to embark upon
the challenges of graduate study.
"Look for the right person and
get married young." he said.
Pauling met his wife, Ava Miller
Pauling, at Oregon State College
when she was in a chemistry class
Pauling was teaching. His mar
riage, Pauling said, was the most
rewarding thing that ever hap
pened to him.
When describing his 15
grandchildren and nine great

grandchildren, Linus Pauling the
famous scientist becomes Linus
Pauling the proud father and fam
ily man. His wife, who was at his
side through many perils and tri
umphs, died of cancer in 1981.
Learn the fundamentals
Pauling, who was trained in
chemistry, physics and mathemat
ics, emphasized that students
should study these fundamental
sciences in graduate school be
cause they are the most basic to
all scientific work.
According to Pauling, these
fields are best mastered with su
pervision, while more applied
fields can be studied independ
ently after graduate school.
He said he also considers biol
ogy to be an applied field of
chemistry, because interactions
between individual atoms and
molecules are central to events at
every level of the organism.
In his 20 years of teaching
freshman chemistry at California
Institute of Technology and ad
vising undergraduates both there
and at Stanford, Pauling said he
convinced several students to do

their graduate work in physical
chemistry, rather than bio
chemistry or molecular biology.
Although he never took a college
biology course, Pauling neverthe
less has made significant discov
eries in the field. While an
undergraduate at Oregon State
Agricultural College, Pauling
studied chemistry and other

sciences he considered to be fun
damental. During these years, he
was even able to teach himself
Greek.
Vitamin C to superconductivity
The scope of Pauling's many
discoveries demonstrates how well
his background in the fundamen
tal sciences has served him.
Pauling was the first to determine
the nature of the chemical bond
— an honor for which he won his
first Nobel Prize in 1954
He has also discovered the
molecular basis of sickle-cell
anemia, a general theory of anes
thesia, and has extensively
studied the therapeutic applica
tions of vitamin C, crystal struc
ture, metallurgy and even
superconductivity.
in just the last two-and-a-half
years, Pauling has published 10
papers on the nature of what are
termed "icosahedral quasicrys
tals," and has two papers to date
on high-temperature supercon
ductivity.
One might ask how a man with
so many diverse interests has been
able to make such an impact in

every branch of science in which
he was involved. It could not have
been done without intense deter
mination — the kind of fervor
Pauling had toward each of his
varied interests. Combined with
a little genius, the Nobel laureate
distinguished himself from the
rest of his contemporaries.
The C cure-all
Pauling has shown his greatest
determination in his endorsement
of vitamin C. He has wrestled
with the medical profession for
'20 years about the healing
qualities of vitamin C and is still
struggling to disprove his opposi
tion.
Pauling became interested in
the role vitamins could play in
mental and physical health after
leaving Caltech in 1963.
Vitamin C, he discovered,
prevents sickness and can be
taken in large doses without side
effects.
Pauling recommends large
doses of vitamin C to cure every-
