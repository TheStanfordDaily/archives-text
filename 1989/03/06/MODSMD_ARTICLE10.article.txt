## Strike keeps Eastern on the ground for second day 
### 
MIAMI (AP) â€” Striking Machinists
kept Eastern Airlines nearly grounded
for a second day yesterday, stranding
hundreds of weary passengers at airport
terminals, but the union called off plans
to cripple the nation's commuter rail
roads at the start of the work week.
Eastern President Phil Bakes, admit
ting that strike-torn airline service has
"been a mess," pleaded for pilots to
return.
"Come back now and make this airline
work," Bakes told a late-afternoon news
briefing. "Come back for your families,
come back for Eastern airlines. We can
make it work."
Bakes also apologized to Eastern's cus

tomers and admitted that the nation's
seventh largest airline, which had before
the strike assured travelers there would
be no mcyor disruptions, had miscalc
ulated.
Eastern pilots, who virtually shut down
the money-losing carrier by honoring
picket lines of the striking Machinists
union, threatened "the very existence"
of the airline, said Eastern press repre
sentative Robin Matell.
"By continuing to stay out, the pilots
are committing economic suicide," he said
at a news briefing.
Eastern was hit with a strike at 12:01
a.m. Saturday by the Machinists union.
About 8,500 mechanics, baggage handlers

and ground crews walked out over East
ern's demand for contract concessions,
escalating a 17-month union
management battle at the nation's
seventh-largest airline.
Eastern ordinarily schedules 1,000
flights with 100,000 passengers daily. On
Saturday just 85 flights took off; expec
tations yesterday were for 125 flights,
Matell said. By 8 p.m. EST, 87 flights
had left, according to airline press rep
resentative Virginia Sanchez.
The strike had threatened to spill over
into a sympathy action against 12 com
muter railroads around the country, but
after a judge in New York banned railroad
workers from honoring Eastern picket

lines there, the Machinists called off their
plans.
U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson
yesterday signed a temporary order bar
ring employees from honoring picket lines
at railroads in the metropolitan New York
area, with its 320,000 railway com
muters, said a press representative for
the Metropolitan Transportation Author
ity.
The International Association of Mac
hinists said the union would appeal today.
"The lAM will not set up picket lines
at any rail carrier's property at this
time," Machinists Vice President John
Peterpaul said in a statement issued in

Washington. "We don't want any lAM
member or members of other unions to
violate the court's order or put them
selves in a position that could jeopardize
their jobs. When the court upholds our
position we are prepared to establish ap
propriate picket lines."
Like Bakes, the union's negotiator ex
pressed sympathy for airline passengers.
"We feel very bad and certainly
apologize for inconvenience to the trav
eling public, but the president obviously
is ignoring his responsibility," Charles
Bryan, negotiator for the Machinists un
ion, said yesterday on ABC's "This Week
With David Brinkley."
