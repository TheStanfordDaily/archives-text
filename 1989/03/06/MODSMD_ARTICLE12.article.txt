# 120 nations debate ozone problem
## Experts call for immediate ban on ozone-destroying chemicals 
### 
. L9NDON (AP) - The Earth's
fragile ozone layer will continue
to deteriorate until the end of the
century even if all ozone
destroying chemicals are banned
immediately, an American expert
said yesterday.
Sherry Rowland, one of the sci
entists who discovered the dangers
of compounds known as
chlorofluorocarbons, said it would
take centuries to repair the shield
that filters the sun's cancer
causing ultraviolet rays.
"Even if we had a total ban
tomorrow, and there were no fur
ther emissions, we would expect
things to get worse until about
the end of the century, and then
gradually recover over two cen
turies," said Rowland, professor
of atmospheric chemistry at the
University of California at Irvine.
Rowland's comments came dur
ing a 120-nation ozone conference
that began yesterday.
Rowland told reporters many of
the compounds already released

in the atmosphere have not
reached the stratosphere, 15-25
miles above the earth. At that
altitude, they are broken apart
and the liberated chlorine atoms
destroy the ozone.
The compounds also trap heat
in the atmosphere and contribute
to the greenhouse effect, which
could cause major climatic
changes, scientists say.
Some of the compounds can last
as long as 100 years. They are
widely used in aerosols, refrigera
tion, air conditioning and fast
food packaging.
Chlorine levels in the atmos
phere would not return to the
levels of the 1960s until the 22nd
or 23rd century, Rowland said.
Robert Watson of NASA agreed
"it will take many many decades,
possibly even several centuries" to
restore the ozone layer.
Soviet delegate Vladimir
Zhakarov said the timetable for
eliminating cholorofluorocarbons
should "not be on the basis of

emotions.
Zhakarov also said Soviet data
indicated the ozone layer over
parts of Europe and the western
Soviet Union had been depleted
by up to 25 percent in winter, but
that it was partly due to natural
causes.
"This depletion occurs every 10
to 15 days," he said. "It moves
from west to east. It coincides
with the movement of cyclones
during this time."
President Daniel arap Moi of
Kenya, who opened the confer
ence, said all countries had an
obligation to protect the atmos
phere, but that developing coun
tries would need help from the
industrial nations.
Moi urged all countries that
have not yet signed the 1987
Montreal Protocol — calling for
the compound emissions to be
halved by the year 2000 — to
"join us in the endeavor to protect
our planet."
