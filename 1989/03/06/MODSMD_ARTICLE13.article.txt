# Time, Warner Bros, merge
## Film industry divided over impact of new media empire 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — The $18 billion merger
agreement between Time Inc. and Warner Commu
nications Inc. will create the world's largest media
and entertainment empire, but film industry exec
utives are divided over its impact on independent
filmmakers and the creative end of the business.
The deal announced Saturday would result in the
world's largest publishing, film and music conglom
erate with estimated annual revenue of $10 billion,
the companies said.
The deal has raised some concern about the pro
spective union of a movie studio, Warner
Bros., with Time's Home Box Office cable television

subsidiary. HBO has often relied on independent
studios for its product.
"In the short term, as these corporations get
larger and larger, you wonder if there's going to
be any room at all for independent product," said
Ira Deutschman, a board member of the Independent
Features Project West, which promotes the interests
of smaller filmmakers. "But, longer term, they'll
have to depend on the independents to fuel these
big machines they're building."
The merger agreement is part of a series of con
solidations under way for several years in the media
and entertainment fields.
