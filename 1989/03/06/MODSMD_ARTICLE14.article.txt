KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -
Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi
bowed to political and military
pressure yesterday and said he is
forming a new government in
hopes of ending the nearly 6-year
old civil war.
Mahdi made the announcement
after signing a "national peace
declaration" with other political
leaders that endorses a tentative
peace agreement with the rebel
Sudan People's Liberation Army
of John Garang.
At a news conference, Mahdi
also announced the fundamen

talist National Islamic Front had
expressed a willingness to join the
new government. It had refused
to sign the peace declaration.
There was no immediate reac
tion from the rebels, who are
mainly Christian and animist and
are demanding political and eco
nomic reforms from the mainly
Moslem government.
The military had demanded
Mahdi sign the cease-fire agree
ment. The armed forces did not
say what they would do if Mahdi
did not sign, but Mahdi had
threatened to resign unless the

army promised not to overthrow
him and union leaders pledged not
to strike.
The announcment came on the
deadline Mahdi gave for his res
ignation.
Earlier, the Middle East News
Agency in Cairo quoted Mahdi as
saying he would stay in office be
cause the military and the pro
fessional and trade unions had
assured him of their support.
"The new government will be
formed with the aim of establish
ing the largest amount of unity
on the internal front," Mahdi said.
