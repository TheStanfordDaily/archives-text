war with Iraq and both nations said they would

cies said.

Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, said that
Khamenei told the Chinese leader "The fields of
cooperation between our two countries are more
than those currently identified, and other fields
where we can cooperate must be studied more

China was one of Iran's major arms-suppliers

Tehran was virtually isolated by the West and
faced an arms embargo that forced it to look
elsewhere for crucially needed weaponry.
Tian was reported as saying: "We sympathize
with the loss of life and property during the war.
We will use all our efforts to help you in
reconstruction."
Analysts estimate that Iran's reconstruction
programs would cost $300 billion to $500 billion.
