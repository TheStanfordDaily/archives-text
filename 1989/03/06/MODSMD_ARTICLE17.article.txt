Miscommunication on
asbestos endangers
workers and students

Miscommunication is
the stuff political science
nightmares are made of.
In 1963, the United States and
the Soviet Union signed an agree
ment to set up a hotline link be
tween Washington, D.C. and Mos
cow to help manage international
crises.
The recent Paloma House
evacuation is a far cry from an
international incident, but a bet
ter communication link between
workers and their supervisors
may have averted what was a
crisis in the Stanford world.
Unknowingly, University
workers disturbed a layer of
sprayed-on sound dampening ma
terial that contained asbestos
when cutting through a section
of Paloma's ceiling.
Although Paloma residents re
ceived letters in January alerting
them to the hazards of asbestos,
workers were never made aware
of the fact that they would be
working with the carcinogenic
substance. Had the workers re
ceived the same letter that went
out to students, the problem at
Paloma could easily have been
averted.
Clearly, Paloma residents have
good reason to cry negligence. For
more than three weeks, they were
exposed to more than eight-times
the level of asbestos acceptable
by University standards. And it
certainly could not have done the
workers any good to stand in a
cloud of asbestos-laced dust while
sawing the hole.
Residents asked workers the

first day on the ceiling job if there
were any danger of asbestos ex
posure. Unfortunately, student
queries did not fall on a receptive
ear until three weeks later â€”
when workers returned to finish
the job.
Furthermore, supervisors and
housing officials knew of a 1986
survey that showed which dormi
tories might contain asbestos.
Luckily, the University is now
taking steps to fix the commu
nication gap and housing officials
are discussing ways to educate
the maintenance staff about as
bestos. Nonetheless, the Univer
sity let a crisis occur before in
stituting much needed reforms.
When making these improve
ments, the University, if for no
other reason, should be thinking
about the workers' safety and in
struct them about the dangers of
asbestos.
A maintenance supervisor ex
cused the initial inaction by
noting that the material dis
turbed did not have the color or
texture usually associated with
asbestos. Because of this, routine
testing for asbestos in the future
seems more than necessary, even
when problems seem unlikely.
The University dealt well once
the problem became public. When
tests came back indicating as
bestos levels higher than Univer
sity standards, an evacuation
began immediately.
Students were given a fair
choice of temporary housing op
tions and their questions and
concerns about the effectiveness
of University policy were heard.
But to Paloma residents, being
forced to leave home during that
part of the quarter best described
as crunch time might seem as
weighty a situation as tanks roll
ing across borders or submarines
emerging just off a nation's coast.
