## Moderate Moslems offended by Khomeini's threats 
### 
AS A MOSLEM, I am as deeply
offended by Syed Mustafa Ash
rafs Feb. 28 letter on Salman
Rushdie as by Rushdie's book itself.
Ashrafs letter should in no way be
considered representative of all Mos
lems, but only of a group of them who,
to me, seem to betray a lack of confi
dence in their faith.
After all, why should a Moslem who
is secure in his belief be bothered if
dogs bark as long as they don't bite.
The Prophet himself would have
nodded his head in disgust in seeing
the current mutilation of Islam at the
hands of fanatical Moslems. After all,
the Prophet himself, when he was
fighting for the freedom to practice a

monotheistic religion in Mecca, was
slandered and vilified by countless
pagans. Did he go about pronouncing
the death sentence on each of them?
Of course not. As long as no physi
cal violence is done against his creed,
why should he be bothered? Everyone
will receive their due on the Day of
Judgment. This is a fundamental belief
of Islam.
Comparing Rushdie's bode to Hitler's
crime is ridiculous. There is a big
difference between causing emotional
pain and physical pain and death.
Emotional pain is subject to interpreta
tion, and it can be controlled by under
standing and maturity.
But there are no two different views

about physical pain and death, and
there is no way a person can mitigate
it by his own free will. Does Ashraf
think that civilized nations will be
hunting for Hitler's Junta if he had
just vilified the Jews, and not tortured
and and exterminated them?
Though I speak against all Moslem
fanatics, I am also surprised at the
West's handling of this incident. The
voice of moderate Moslems has been
stifled by the Western press. Very few
non-Moslems have criticized, if not
Rushdie, but at least this particular
piece of work as being blasphemous.
True, Rushdie has the freedom of
expression, but at least the West
should show some regard for the senti-

ments of one-fifth of the inhabitants of
the planet.
As The Daily's Feb. 28 editorial said,
there is a general ignorance in the
West about Islam and it's values, with
people equating Islam to Khomeini's
barbaric creed and therefore undeserv
ing of the natural human respect for
the feelings of others.
But showing respect for Islam, if not
a right to be conceded to the Moslems,
is at least a choice which the West
ought to exercise. It is necessary in
order to have harmonious co-existence
on planet earth.
