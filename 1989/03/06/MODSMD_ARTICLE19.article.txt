# Ayatollah's action is a good defense of Western Culture
## 
### 
I imagine that many readers of The
Daily were shocked not only by the
Ayatollah Khomeini's death sentence
for Salman Rushdie but also by how
widely Khomeini's sentiments are
shared, extending, for example, even to
some Stanford students (e.g. Syed Mus
tafa Ashrafs Feb. 28 letter declaring
that Rushdie "must be hunted down
and punished").
I wonder how many of those who are
"upset," "appalled" or "outraged" by
the Islamic Fundamentalists' reaction
to Rushdie and his book were the
same people who last year denounced
Western Culture and demanded that
Stanford look at its courses on the
Third World to find models of enlight
ened social justice.
Those who are intent on supplanting

First World culture with that of the
Third World (rather than vice versa,
which, by the way, is what progress
means) should think carefully about
which societies really "oppress" and
"disempower" those who question the
prevailing authority.
