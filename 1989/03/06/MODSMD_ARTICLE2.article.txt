Gathering blankets, medical supplies,
money and food from donors in the
Stanford community, a group of Stan
ford students did their best Saturday
to speed relief supplies to the people of
war-torn Southern Sudan before their
rainy season begins in under a month.
Saturday morning Pan Am flight 66
departed from San Francisco Interna
tional Airport carrying donations col
lected by the Stanford African Students
Association, the San Francisco-based
Medical Volunteers International and
the Third Baptist Church of San Fran
cisco.
Organized by former Medical School
resident Ahimsa Sumchai, Airlift for
Africa, as the effort is called, was ini

tiated in January to respond to suffer
ing in Southern Sudan as a result of
both their civil war and the devastating
effects of famine there. The rainy season
promises to bring more destruction in
the form of floods.
Sumchai left for the Sudan with the
cargo and plans to determine what other
kinds of aid are most urgently needed
there.
"The project was an overwhelming
success," said graduate student Jona
than Jansen, president of the associa
tion. "We managed to raise a lot of
money and materials on our campus
and neighboring schools made contribu
tions as well." The Stanford Medical
School also donated medical equipment
and other supplies, while dorms and
faculty members also made contribu

tions.
According to Jansen, the effort was
mounted after Sumchai returned from
the Sudan where she worked as a
pediatrician and witnessed the suffering
there.
Upon her return, Sumchai contacted
organizations from around the Bay Area
and asked for their help. The Rev. Jesse
Jackson lent a hand by obtaining the
cargo space from Pan Am.
"We tried to act immediately by
raising awareness on campus," said Jan
sen, adding that the association con
tacted students with fliers, a table in
White Plaza and by visiting a SWOPSI
class on refugees.
"There are millions of children suf-
fering in the Sudan. They are
dying because of starvation, dis
ease and the civil war," Jans en
said. "The rainy season ... means
millions more [people] will be an
nihilated. We feel that is reason
to get involved."
In addition to 3,000 lbs. of
cargo, the project raised a total
of over $1,000. This money will
be used to purchase additional
supplies based on Sumchai's eval
uation of what is needed most.
Jansen said Sumchai will make
presentations on campus when
she returns. "We plan to continue
to raise awareness of the terrible
plight of children in the Sudan,"
Jansen said. "The support we re
ceived from dorms and faculty
was excellent."
