## Don't do as the Romans 
### 
STANFORD IS GETTING messy.
I'm leaving soon so I don't really
care how the school looks from my
window, but I am becoming concerned
that when my relatives come for Com
mencement they aren't going to be able
the see the perfect beauty I've been de
scribing for the last four years.
I know how they'll feel. When I visited
the Circus Maximus in Rome last spring
break, I was a bit disappointed.
I had expected a building, and it turned
out to be just a field with raised sides.
My father thought it would be nice to
walk down the middle of it though, so
we did. I've seen lots of lawns, so I wasn't
really paying much attention to the one
I was walking on, but after a few minutes
I happened to glance down.
There on the ground, as far as the
lawn stretched, were literally hundreds
of used condoms. At least I assumed they
were used.
For all I know, a Trojan delivery truck
might have jackknifed there the day
before. But if that was the case, someone
had come along and carefully taken all
the little suckers out of their packages
and unrolled them.
The most noticeable thing about Rome,
aside from all the rather large ruined
structures, was the filthiness of the city.
At least the United States is not the first
country to bury itself in trash. Atlantic
City used to be the Riviera of the United
States. Now you can't swim there without
worrying about tripping over discarded
needles.
I use Rome and New Jersey as exam

pies of pollution because it is easier to
do that than to admit that the place in
which we all live, work and study is be
coming polluted as well.
Walking by Roble Hall today, I spotted
3ome trash in a bush. And right next to
my car was a pile of cigarette butts,
obviously just dumped out of a car
ashtray — not mine. From what I ob
served on a walk of perhaps 200 yards,
the Sherlock Holmes in me determined
the identity of the litterer.
The culprit is everyone, from the lofty
palate of the person who slipped an Ab
solut bottle into the bush, to the more
bucolic tastes of the Bazooka gum chewer
who left a wrapper right beneath the
same plant; from the beer drinker whose
can my car tire crushed this morning to
the Crystal Geyser drinker whose bottle
I picked up off our lawn last week.
No one is blameless. When I used to
smoke I thought nothing of crushing the
cigarette into the dirt and leaving the
butt there. That's litter, but tell a smoker
to pick up his butt and he'll snarl at you.
So what's the answer if everyone does
it? I have one, but it's unrealistic, even
here at Disneyland North.
In the Bookstore you'll find a paper
back mystery entitled "Stray Cat." It's a
nice book to read on an airplane or when
you're sick of Nietzsche. Not highbrow,
but nice all the same.
In it is a character named Charlie Gam
ble, and from him we get our answer.
You see, he lives on a boat, and every
day he fishes some garbage out of the
water alongside his home. He knows it's

doms. At least I as
sume they were used.

a drop in the bucket, but he also knows
that if everyone puts a drop in that
bucket, it'll be full sooner or later. So
why not?
Every day as you're walking to class
or to practice or to the library, if you
see something that's not too objec
tionable, pick it up. Newspaper,
cardboard, bottles and aluminum cans
should go in the recycling bin.
Like I said, I'm being idealistic, but
even if all you do toward the improvement
of Stanford's appearance is to put this
Daily in the proper receptacle when
you're through with it, you'll be doing
us all a great favor.
