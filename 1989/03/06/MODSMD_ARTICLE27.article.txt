## Dealing with refugee crisis Students visit U.S.-Mexico border detention center 
### Maryellen Driscoll Staff writer 
As a high school student in
Guatemala, Victor was involved
in a student group that
protested the Guatemalan gov
ernment, human rights abuses
and the inexplicable disap
pearance of thousands of
Guatemalans.
At age 18, he decided to flee
his country in order to avoid
persecution and possibly even
death.
"If you continue these
protests, you will be killed," he
told sophomore Juan Salinas.
Last month Salinas and four
other Stanford students met
Victor and dozens of other ref
ugees in a United States border
detention center as part of a trip
for their SWOPSI course, "The
International Refugee Crisis."
Victor had been arrested a
number of times in Guatemala
for participating in public dem
onstrations and threatened by
armed men for his political ac
tivity.
In May, a group of men with
guns forcibly took Victor and
some of his friends into a house
and threatened them. After a
quick release, Victor went into
hiding. He said he was scared
since many of his friends had
been killed before.
Victor is safe for now — be
hind the barbed wire of the
detention center in El Centro,
Calif., 10 miles north of the
Mexican border. The Immigra
tion and Naturalization Service
caught him crossing the border
into the United States in No
vember.
Victor, who has been in"the
camp" for three months now,
has applied for political asylum
and currently awaits a court
hearing. His case is being rep
resented by the El Centro
Asylum Project, a free legal
service for Salvadoran and
Guatemalan refugees, for which

1988 Stanford graduate Mike
Meuter volunteers.
The SWOPSI students as
sisted Meuter in conducting in
terviews and completing paper
work on refugees who are
seeking asylum with Meuter's
help.
Sophomore Marta Romero,
who participated in the trip, said
she "was surprised at the num
ber of political asylum cases that
have to be dealt with and the
law process that they have to
go through." Romero said she
is now interested in doing work
in the United States and in Cen
tral America as a result of her
experiences at the detention cen
ter.

Only 5 percent of
Guatemalan refu
gees and 2.7 per
cent of Salva
doran refugees
were granted po
litical asylum in
1988.

Romero, who worked with
Salvadoran refugees in a Hon
duran refugee camp last
summer, also hopes to volunteer
for the Asylum Project over
spring break.
"There were some pretty bad
stories down there," she said.
"It seems so unbelievable that
they have to tell these stories
so many times ... at some point
they have to detach themselves
from their story."
Meuter said he is fairly hope
ful that Victor will be able to
gain political asylum. But, for
any Guatemalan or Salvadoran
refugee, the odds of gaining po
litical asylum in the United
States are slim.
According to the INS, only 5

percent of Guatemalan refugees
and 2.7 percent of Salvadoran
refugees were granted political
asylum in 1988. More than half
of the Nicaraguan refugees,
however, were granted asylum,
as a result of relaxed asylum
procedures for Nicaraguans un
der the initiative of former At
torney General Edwin Meese.
Of all the refugees applying
for asylum in the United States,
those from Iran have the highest
acceptance rate at 75 percent.
At a Feb. 22 forum sponsored
by the SWOPSI class, Bill Hing,
director of the Immigrant Legal
Resource Center in East Palo
Alto and San Francisco, de
scribed the United States' policy
for accepting asylum applicants
as being "entirely conducive to
the political whims of the ad
ministration."
According to Hing, who is also
a visiting professor at the Law
School, granting political asylum
to Guatemalans and Sal
vadorans would mean recogniz
ing human rights abuses in
those countries. Since the
United States supports the
Guatemalan and Salvadoran
governments, it has a vested in
terest in supporting a positive
image of these countries' human
rights records. Recognizing
abuses would reflect poorly on
the United States and its allies,
Hing explained.
However, because the U.S.
government does not support
the existing Nicaraguan govern
ment, refugees from Nicaragua
are more likely to be granted
asylum, Hing added.
Despite the dismal odds for
Guatemalan asylum applicants,
Meuter remains relatively con
fident in Victor's case. The
Asylum Project has won about
30 percent of its cases, he said.
Meuter attributed part of the
project's success to the INS
judges in El Centro who, he said,
are "pretty fair." Nevertheless, Meuter was
critical of the INS as being uncooperative
and trying to keep refugees out of the
country.
"Asylum should be taking in as many
people as possible and [the INS has] a
number of deterrents that prevent people
from applying for asylum," he explained.

'The situation in Central
America is just so
screwed up, and the
vast majority of the
people just want to live
and not be part of either
side.'
— Mike Meuter

Meuter was also critical of the U.S. policy
towards refugees, describing it as being
"inhumane" and, with its narrow definition
of a refugee, "violating the letter and the
spirit of the United Nations refugee policy
that was adopted by the U.S. Congress."
Under U.S. law, an asylum applicant,
such as Victor, must show that he has

reason to fear persecution in his home
country.
If Victor is denied asylum, the INS will
notify the Guatemalan government of his
deportation. He will be bused to the San
Diego airport and then flown into
Guatemala City.
What Meuter said he found most sur
prising, after working in El Centro for three
months, is the variety of regimes from
whom his clients have fled.
"Trying to draw a place to blame, make
it black and white, doesn't do any good,"
Meuter said.
"The situation in Central America is just
so screwed up. And the vast majority of
the people just want to live and not be
part of either side," Meuter said. "But for
a number of reasons the situation is just
so out of hand that they're not allowed to
do it."
The number of his Central American
clients persecuted by their government ap
proximates the number persecuted by left
ist guerrillas, Meuter explained.
"It's made me really change my attitude.
I've become more and more of a pacifist
from the stories I've heard," said Meuter.
"Violence on either side is not working at
all."
There are less and less clients who are
torture victims, because Central Americans
have become more selective about who they
torture, Meuter said. Nevertheless, he
added, his clients are typically psychologi
cally devastated by written and verbal
threats and the overall violent conditions
in their countries.
Meuter said that he is "beyond the point
of being flabbergasted" at the stories the

refugees tell him, but that "it still makes
an emotional impact after hearing each
person's story."
A trip to El Centro last spring sparked
his interest in working for the Asylum
Project, which is mainly funded by the
Lutheran Immigration Fund, Meuter said.
Along with other Stanford students,
Meuter spent a weekend volunteering for
the Asylum Project as their action project
for a SWOPSI course on Central America.
By visiting various churches in the Bay
Area last summer, Meuter raised enough
money to enable him to volunteer his serv

ices to the Asylum Project for nine months.
He plans to attend law school in the fall
and then return to El Centro as a lawyer
to continue his fight for refugee cases.
"I really thought that lawyers were just
a bunch of greedy slimebags," said Meuter.
"[Project Asylum] opened my eyes to this
great possibility."
Meuter expressed enthusiasm about
maintaining ties between the Asylum Proj
ect and Stanford in order to "hopefully
encourage and entice people to come down
here and volunteer and to carry on the
torch."

so out of hand that they're not allowed to
do it."
The number of his Central American
clients persecuted by their government ap
proximates the number persecuted by left
ist guerrillas, Meuter explained.
"It's made me really change my attitude.
I've become more and more of a pacifist
from the stories I've heard," said Meuter.
"Violence on either side is not working at
all."
There are less and less clients who are
torture victims, because Central Americans
have become more selective about who they
torture, Meuter said. Nevertheless, he
added, his clients are typically psychologi
cally devastated by written and verbal
threats and the overall violent conditions
in their countries.
Meuter said that he is "beyond the point

refugees tell him, but that "it still makes

money to enable him to volunteer his serv

He plans to attend law school in the fall

The gates of the U.S. border detention center in El Centro, Calif. Five students
visited the center, which houses 450 refugees, as part of a SWOPSI trip last month.
As a high school student in
Guatemala, Victor was involved
in a student group that
protested the Guatemalan gov
ernment, human rights abuses
and the inexplicable disap
pearance of thousands of
Guatemalans.
At age 18, he decided to flee
his country in order to avoid
persecution and possibly even
death.
"If you continue these
protests, you will be killed," he
told sophomore Juan Salinas.
Last month Salinas and four
other Stanford students met
Victor and dozens of other ref
ugees in a United States border
detention center as part of a trip
for their SWOPSI course, "The
International Refugee Crisis."
Victor had been arrested a
number of times in Guatemala
for participating in public dem
onstrations and threatened by
armed men for his political ac
tivity.
In May, a group of men with
guns forcibly took Victor and
some of his friends into a house
and threatened them. After a
quick release, Victor went into
hiding. He said he was scared
since many of his friends had
been killed before.
Victor is safe for now — be
hind the barbed wire of the
detention center in El Centro,
Calif., 10 miles north of the
Mexican border. The Immigra
tion and Naturalization Service
caught him crossing the border
into the United States in No
vember.
Victor, who has been in"the
camp" for three months now,
has applied for political asylum
and currently awaits a court
hearing. His case is being rep
resented by the El Centro
Asylum Project, a free legal
service for Salvadoran and
Guatemalan refugees, for which

1988 Stanford graduate Mike
Meuter volunteers.
The SWOPSI students as
sisted Meuter in conducting in
terviews and completing paper
work on refugees who are
seeking asylum with Meuter's
help.
Sophomore Marta Romero,
who participated in the trip, said
she "was surprised at the num
ber of political asylum cases that
have to be dealt with and the
law process that they have to
go through." Romero said she
is now interested in doing work
in the United States and in Cen
tral America as a result of her
experiences at the detention cen
ter.

Only 5 percent of
Guatemalan refu
gees and 2.7 per
cent of Salva
doran refugees
were granted po
litical asylum in
1988.

Romero, who worked with
Salvadoran refugees in a Hon
duran refugee camp last
summer, also hopes to volunteer
for the Asylum Project over
spring break.
"There were some pretty bad
stories down there," she said.
"It seems so unbelievable that
they have to tell these stories
so many times ... at some point
they have to detach themselves
from their story."
Meuter said he is fairly hope
ful that Victor will be able to
gain political asylum. But, for
any Guatemalan or Salvadoran
refugee, the odds of gaining po
litical asylum in the United
States are slim.
According to the INS, only 5

percent of Guatemalan refugees
and 2.7 percent of Salvadoran
refugees were granted political
asylum in 1988. More than half
of the Nicaraguan refugees,
however, were granted asylum,
as a result of relaxed asylum
procedures for Nicaraguans un
der the initiative of former At
torney General Edwin Meese.
Of all the refugees applying
for asylum in the United States,
those from Iran have the highest
acceptance rate at 75 percent.
At a Feb. 22 forum sponsored
by the SWOPSI class, Bill Hing,
director of the Immigrant Legal
Resource Center in East Palo
Alto and San Francisco, de
scribed the United States' policy
for accepting asylum applicants
as being "entirely conducive to
the political whims of the ad
ministration."
According to Hing, who is also
a visiting professor at the Law
School, granting political asylum
to Guatemalans and Sal
vadorans would mean recogniz
ing human rights abuses in
those countries. Since the
United States supports the
Guatemalan and Salvadoran
governments, it has a vested in
terest in supporting a positive
image of these countries' human
rights records. Recognizing
abuses would reflect poorly on
the United States and its allies,
Hing explained.
However, because the U.S.
government does not support
the existing Nicaraguan govern
ment, refugees from Nicaragua
are more likely to be granted
asylum, Hing added.
Despite the dismal odds for
Guatemalan asylum applicants,
Meuter remains relatively con
fident in Victor's case. The
Asylum Project has won about
30 percent of its cases, he said.
Meuter attributed part of the
project's success to the INS
judges in El Centro who, he said,
are "pretty fair." Nevertheless, Meuter was
critical of the INS as being uncooperative
and trying to keep refugees out of the
country.
"Asylum should be taking in as many
people as possible and [the INS has] a
number of deterrents that prevent people
from applying for asylum," he explained.

'The situation in Central
America is just so
screwed up, and the
vast majority of the
people just want to live
and not be part of either
side.'
— Mike Meuter

Meuter was also critical of the U.S. policy
towards refugees, describing it as being
"inhumane" and, with its narrow definition
of a refugee, "violating the letter and the
spirit of the United Nations refugee policy
that was adopted by the U.S. Congress."
Under U.S. law, an asylum applicant,
such as Victor, must show that he has

reason to fear persecution in his home
country.
If Victor is denied asylum, the INS will
notify the Guatemalan government of his
deportation. He will be bused to the San
Diego airport and then flown into
Guatemala City.
What Meuter said he found most sur
prising, after working in El Centro for three
months, is the variety of regimes from
whom his clients have fled.
"Trying to draw a place to blame, make
it black and white, doesn't do any good,"
Meuter said.
"The situation in Central America is just
so screwed up. And the vast majority of
the people just want to live and not be
part of either side," Meuter said. "But for
a number of reasons the situation is just

do it."

clients persecuted by their government ap

the existing Nicaraguan govern
ment, refugees from Nicaragua
are more likely to be granted
asylum, Hing added.
Despite the dismal odds for
Guatemalan asylum applicants,
Meuter remains relatively con
fident in Victor's case. The
Asylum Project has won about
30 percent of its cases, he said.
Meuter attributed part of the
project's success to the INS
judges in El Centro who, he said,
are "pretty fair." Nevertheless, Meuter was
critical of the INS as being uncooperative
and trying to keep refugees out of the
country.
"Asylum should be taking in as many
people as possible and [the INS has] a
number of deterrents that prevent people
from applying for asylum," he explained.

'The situation in Central
America is just so
screwed up, and the
vast majority of the
people just want to live
and not be part of either
side.'

Meuter was also critical of the U.S. policy
towards refugees, describing it as being
"inhumane" and, with its narrow definition
of a refugee, "violating the letter and the
spirit of the United Nations refugee policy
that was adopted by the U.S. Congress."
Under U.S. law, an asylum applicant,
such as Victor, must show that he has

reason to fear persecution in his home
country.
If Victor is denied asylum, the INS will
notify the Guatemalan government of his
deportation. He will be bused to the San
Diego airport and then flown into
Guatemala City.
What Meuter said he found most sur
prising, after working in El Centro for three
months, is the variety of regimes from
whom his clients have fled.
"Trying to draw a place to blame, make
it black and white, doesn't do any good,"
Meuter said.
"The situation in Central America is just
so screwed up. And the vast majority of
the people just want to live and not be
part of either side," Meuter said. "But for
a number of reasons the situation is just
so out of hand that they're not allowed to
do it."
The number of his Central American
clients persecuted by their government ap
proximates the number persecuted by left
ist guerrillas, Meuter explained.
"It's made me really change my attitude.
I've become more and more of a pacifist
from the stories I've heard," said Meuter.
"Violence on either side is not working at
all."
There are less and less clients who are
torture victims, because Central Americans
have become more selective about who they
torture, Meuter said. Nevertheless, he
added, his clients are typically psychologi
cally devastated by written and verbal
threats and the overall violent conditions
in their countries.
Meuter said that he is "beyond the point
of being flabbergasted" at the stories the

refugees tell him, but that "it still makes
an emotional impact after hearing each
person's story."
A trip to El Centro last spring sparked
his interest in working for the Asylum
Project, which is mainly funded by the
Lutheran Immigration Fund, Meuter said.
Along with other Stanford students,
Meuter spent a weekend volunteering for
the Asylum Project as their action project
for a SWOPSI course on Central America.
By visiting various churches in the Bay
Area last summer, Meuter raised enough
money to enable him to volunteer his serv

ices to the Asylum Project for nine months.
He plans to attend law school in the fall
and then return to El Centro as a lawyer
to continue his fight for refugee cases.
"I really thought that lawyers were just
a bunch of greedy slimebags," said Meuter.
"[Project Asylum] opened my eyes to this
great possibility."
Meuter expressed enthusiasm about
maintaining ties between the Asylum Proj
ect and Stanford in order to "hopefully
encourage and entice people to come down
here and volunteer and to carry on the
torch."
