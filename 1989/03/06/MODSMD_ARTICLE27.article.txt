## Dealing with refugee crisis Students visit U.S.-Mexico border detention center 
### Maryellen Driscoll Staff writer 
As a high school student in
Guatemala, Victor was involved
in a student group that
protested the Guatemalan gov
ernment, human rights abuses
and the inexplicable disap
pearance of thousands of
Guatemalans.
At age 18, he decided to flee
his country in order to avoid
persecution and possibly even
death.
"If you continue these
protests, you will be killed," he
told sophomore Juan Salinas.
Last month Salinas and four
other Stanford students met
Victor and dozens of other ref
ugees in a United States border
detention center as part of a trip
for their SWOPSI course, "The
International Refugee Crisis."
Victor had been arrested a
number of times in Guatemala
for participating in public dem
onstrations and threatened by
armed men for his political ac
tivity.
In May, a group of men with
guns forcibly took Victor and
some of his friends into a house
and threatened them. After a
quick release, Victor went into
hiding. He said he was scared
since many of his friends had
been killed before.
Victor is safe for now â€” be
hind the barbed wire of the
detention center in El Centro,
Calif., 10 miles north of the
Mexican border. The Immigra
tion and Naturalization Service
caught him crossing the border
into the United States in No
vember.
Victor, who has been in"the
camp" for three months now,
has applied for political asylum
and currently awaits a court
hearing. His case is being rep
resented by the El Centro
Asylum Project, a free legal
service for Salvadoran and
Guatemalan refugees, for which

1988 Stanford graduate Mike
Meuter volunteers.
The SWOPSI students as
sisted Meuter in conducting in
terviews and completing paper
work on refugees who are
seeking asylum with Meuter's
help.
Sophomore Marta Romero,
who participated in the trip, said
she "was surprised at the num
ber of political asylum cases that
have to be dealt with and the
law process that they have to
go through." Romero said she
is now interested in doing work
in the United States and in Cen
tral America as a result of her
experiences at the detention cen
ter.

Only 5 percent of
Guatemalan refu
gees and 2.7 per
cent of Salva
doran refugees
were granted po
litical asylum in
1988.

Romero, who worked with
Salvadoran refugees in a Hon
duran refugee camp last
summer, also hopes to volunteer
for the Asylum Project over
spring break.
"There were some pretty bad
stories down there," she said.
"It seems so unbelievable that
they have to tell these stories
so many times ... at some point
they have to detach themselves
from their story."
Meuter said he is fairly hope
ful that Victor will be able to
gain political asylum. But, for
any Guatemalan or Salvadoran
refugee, the odds of gaining po
litical asylum in the United
States are slim.
According to the INS, only 5

percent of Guatemalan refugees
and 2.7 percent of Salvadoran
refugees were granted political
asylum in 1988. More than half
of the Nicaraguan refugees,
however, were granted asylum,
as a result of relaxed asylum
procedures for Nicaraguans un
der the initiative of former At
torney General Edwin Meese.
Of all the refugees applying
for asylum in the United States,
those from Iran have the highest
acceptance rate at 75 percent.
At a Feb. 22 forum sponsored
by the SWOPSI class, Bill Hing,
director of the Immigrant Legal
Resource Center in East Palo
Alto and San Francisco, de
scribed the United States' policy
for accepting asylum applicants
as being "entirely conducive to
the political whims of the ad
ministration."
According to Hing, who is also
a visiting professor at the Law
School, granting political asylum
to Guatemalans and Sal
vadorans would mean recogniz
ing human rights abuses in
those countries. Since the
United States supports the
Guatemalan and Salvadoran
governments, it has a vested in
terest in supporting a positive
image of these countries' human
rights records. Recognizing
abuses would reflect poorly on
the United States and its allies,
Hing explained.
However, because the U.S.
government does not support
the existing Nicaraguan govern
ment, refugees from Nicaragua
are more likely to be granted
asylum, Hing added.
Despite the dismal odds for
Guatemalan asylum applicants,
Meuter remains relatively con
fident in Victor's case. The
Asylum Project has won about
30 percent of its cases, he said.
Meuter attributed part of the
project's success to the INS
judges in El Centro who, he said,
