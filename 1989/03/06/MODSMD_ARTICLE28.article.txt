# Bubba Gong injects Hollywood flair into jazz dance program
## 
### Allison Klein 
Stanford's dance program was jazzed-up this year
by the addition of actor, singer, dancer, director
and choreographer Bubba Gong.
Gong, who teaches jazz dance, is a third-generation
Chinese-American, born in Clarkesville, Miss. A
1979 Stanford graduate, he has been in show busi
ness since age four — when he started tap dancing
to correct a congenital leg defect.
Gong's professional career began at Walt Disney
World in 1976, where he was a "Kid of the
Kingdom," a member of a bicentennial dance troupe.
"It was a wonderful, magical entry into showbusi
ness," he says. "We did commercials, films and
television specials, and a tour through Europe and
all around the United States."
Gong says he feels his ethnicity has helped him
stand out from the hordes of actors and performers.
"In my particular interest, and I speak for no one
else, [my ethnic origin] has really worked as an
advantage for me."
However, Gong recognizes that it is still trying
for most ethnic minority actors to find roles. "In
Hollywood, there still is that color barrier for many
actors, especially for Hispanics and blacks and
Asian-Americans," he says.
Gong's career in Hollywood began with a part in
the revival of the musical "Flower Girl's Song." In
1984, he was the national spokesperson for
Tropicana orange juice in a nationwide commercial.
Gong's product loyalty to Tropicana remains to this
day — his refrigerator is still stocked with their
orange juice, he says.
Gong also has had an extensive television career.
Some may remember him as the serial killer who
tried to knock off Frisco Jones in the soap opera
"General Hospital." Gong also had roles in "Archie
Bunker's Place" and played a gymnast from the
People's Republic of China during the Los Angeles
Olympics on "Trapper John, M.D."
Gong, who was highly influenced during his un
dergraduate years here by dance teacher Juan Valen
zuala, says he was delighted with the opportunity
to teach at Stanford. "I think it is like giving back
some of the joy that I received here at this school
from the dance program," Gong says. "So, when
the opportunity arose here, I said, 'Why not?"'
Gong says teaching at Stanford is an "exhilarat
ing" experience. Although he concedes that it is a
little odd to be teaching at the school where he was
once a student, he says he has been delighted with
the warm welcome he has received.
"I've been totally overwhelmed by the students'
enthusiasm and the sheer amount of attendance,"
he says.
Gong adds that he is also "really, really amazed
at the quality of the (dance) students that I have."
"Stanford students are definitely a brand unto
themselves," he added.
