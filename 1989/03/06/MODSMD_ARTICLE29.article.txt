The Stanford Daily
The 29 students who had
been convicted of disrupting
a January Board of Trustees
meeting announced at a
White Plaza rally that they
would not pay the $1,900 in
fines which had been levied
against them by the Student
Judicial Council.
On Jan. 14, about 50 stu
dents had broken up a Board
of Trustees luncheon at the
Faculty Club as a protest
against University involve
ment with the Department
of Defense and the Vietnam
War.
At the White Plaza rally,
the convicted students read
a statement proclaiming:
"Placed within a context
of the systematic violence
practiced by the U.S. and
the Stanford defense com
plex in the Third World,
placed within the context of
our noisy presence at a trus
tee meeting devoted to
business-as-usual, the recent
trial of 29 students emerges
as a travesty of justice."
