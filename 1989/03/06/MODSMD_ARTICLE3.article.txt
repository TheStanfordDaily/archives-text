# Police pursue report of SAE flashers
## 
### Maryellen Driscoll Staff writer 
Responding to a complaint from a
Stanford student, the Stanford Police
Department investigated a report of al
leged male exhibitionists on the roof of
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity
house Saturday afternoon.
Sophomore Linda Armstrong said
when she jogged on the Campus Drive
sidewalk by the SAE house around 4:30
p.m. Saturday at least 10 men on the

roof of the house were yelling obscenities
at people passing by and then "pulled
down their pants and shorts and began
masturbating."
When Armstrong returned to her
dorm, she called the Stanford Police to
report the incident.
"That was really out of line. I just
wanted a police officer to tell them that
they didn't have the right to do that,"
she said.
Sergeant Phil Love of the Stanford
Police said last night that the situation

is still under investigation.
After an SAE house meeting last
night, a resident brought a response to
The Daily asserting that the incident
had been exaggerated.
The SAEs' written response said: "On
Saturday afternoon, March 4th, there
were men and women dancing to music
on the roof of SAE. However, there was
no foul language directed toward any
person passing by.
