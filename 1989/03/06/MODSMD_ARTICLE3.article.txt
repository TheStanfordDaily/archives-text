# Police pursue report of SAE flashers
## 
### Maryellen Driscoll Staff writer 
Responding to a complaint from a
Stanford student, the Stanford Police
Department investigated a report of al
leged male exhibitionists on the roof of
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity
house Saturday afternoon.
Sophomore Linda Armstrong said
when she jogged on the Campus Drive
sidewalk by the SAE house around 4:30
p.m. Saturday at least 10 men on the

roof of the house were yelling obscenities
at people passing by and then "pulled
down their pants and shorts and began
masturbating."
When Armstrong returned to her
dorm, she called the Stanford Police to
report the incident.
"That was really out of line. I just
wanted a police officer to tell them that
they didn't have the right to do that,"
she said.
Sergeant Phil Love of the Stanford
Police said last night that the situation

is still under investigation.
After an SAE house meeting last
night, a resident brought a response to
The Daily asserting that the incident
had been exaggerated.
The SAEs' written response said: "On
Saturday afternoon, March 4th, there
were men and women dancing to music
on the roof of SAE. However, there was
no foul language directed toward any
person passing by.
"The allegations of our activi
ties were plainly exaggerated. The
police came, removed people from
the roof as a safety precaution,
and left without incident."
However, Armstrong said,
"There were no women on the
roof when I went by."
According to Armstrong, the
police told her that they received
a second call from an anonymous
female jogger who told the police
that there were men screaming
from the roof and that she was
concerned for their safety.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano said last night that he had
not heard of the incident but that
he would definitely look into it.
Interfraternal Council Presi
dent Chris Erlin said he did not
know anything about the incident
as of last night but said that the
issue would "definitely be brought
to the judicial realm" of the IFC
but not necessarily the IFC judi
cial board.
