Cardinal drops three
to Sun Devils

The last time Stanford dropped
all three games in a home Six-Pac
series was April 6-8, 1984, also
to the Sun Devils. The only other
three-game sweep of the Cardinal
at home was completed by USC
back in 1979, the year the Six-Pac
was formed.
Arizona State remains unde
feated in the Six-Pac and sits atop
the league at 6-0, 17-5 overall.
Stanford falls to 10-13, 1-5 in
league play. The Sun Devils
avenged last year's loss to the Car
dinal in the championship game
of the College World Series.
ASU's leadoff man, senior third
baseman John Finn, set the tone
for the weekend in the initial at
bat of the series. He led off the
first inning of Friday's game by
sending a Mike Mussina pitch
deep over the left field wall. The
Devils went on to a 10-2 rout Fri
day and never looked back.
ASU went on to pile up 27 runs
in three games, thumping the
Cardinal 10-6 Saturday and 7-2
Sunday. The Devils totaled a
whopping 41 hits on the weekend,

wMie the Cardinal's offense
produced just 15.
"The disappointing thing is that*
we didn't pitch well this weekend.,
Th«fy swung the bat well and hit;
all our pitchers. We just couldn't!
contain them. They did a great,'
job/' Stanford Coach Mark Mar-j
quess said.
Equally disturbing was the Sun}
Devils' ability to run. Tht. Devils'
stole nine bases in 11 attempts!
and appeared capable of running 4,
whenever Coach Jim Brock want-«
ed. t '
Everyone knew about ASU's;
power coming into the series —•
they banged out six homers in the!
three games — but no one ex-;
pected them to be so active on*
the basepaths.
"We weren't able to stop them/
They ran at will. They ran with'
everybody. We couldn't slow them!
down at all," Marquess said. "Itj
was a combination of being slow,
to the plate and not throwing well;
(to second)."
Defense was about the only
thing that wasn't abysmal for the|
Cardinal, as evidenced by Stan-J
ford's errorless effort in yester-.
day's loss. The Cardinal did give
up two unearned runs Friday andj
also committed four errors Sat-j
urday, though only two of those J
led to Sun Devil runs.
Stanford's No. 1 starter Mike!
Mussina suffered the loss Friday,!
dropping his record to 2-3. Mus-|
sina was coming off his finest out-1
ing ever, a two-hit, 12-strikeout [
performance in a 2-0 win over the j
Bears.
Mussina was touched for five J
