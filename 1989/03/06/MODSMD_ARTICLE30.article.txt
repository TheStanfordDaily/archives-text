Baseball
Cardinal drops three
to Sun Devils

The last time Stanford dropped
all three games in a home Six-Pac
series was April 6-8, 1984, also
to the Sun Devils. The only other
three-game sweep of the Cardinal
at home was completed by USC
back in 1979, the year the Six-Pac
was formed.
Arizona State remains unde
feated in the Six-Pac and sits atop
the league at 6-0, 17-5 overall.
Stanford falls to 10-13, 1-5 in
league play. The Sun Devils
avenged last year's loss to the Car
dinal in the championship game
of the College World Series.
ASU's leadoff man, senior third
baseman John Finn, set the tone
for the weekend in the initial at
bat of the series. He led off the
first inning of Friday's game by
sending a Mike Mussina pitch
deep over the left field wall. The
Devils went on to a 10-2 rout Fri
day and never looked back.
ASU went on to pile up 27 runs
in three games, thumping the
Cardinal 10-6 Saturday and 7-2
Sunday. The Devils totaled a
whopping 41 hits on the weekend,

wMie the Cardinal's offense
produced just 15.
"The disappointing thing is that*
we didn't pitch well this weekend.,
Th«fy swung the bat well and hit;
all our pitchers. We just couldn't!
contain them. They did a great,'
job/' Stanford Coach Mark Mar-j
quess said.
Equally disturbing was the Sun}
Devils' ability to run. Tht. Devils'
stole nine bases in 11 attempts!
and appeared capable of running 4,
whenever Coach Jim Brock want-«
ed. t '
Everyone knew about ASU's;
power coming into the series —•
they banged out six homers in the!
three games — but no one ex-;
pected them to be so active on*
the basepaths.
"We weren't able to stop them/
They ran at will. They ran with'
everybody. We couldn't slow them!
down at all," Marquess said. "Itj
was a combination of being slow,
to the plate and not throwing well;
(to second)."
Defense was about the only
thing that wasn't abysmal for the|
Cardinal, as evidenced by Stan-J
ford's errorless effort in yester-.
day's loss. The Cardinal did give
up two unearned runs Friday andj
also committed four errors Sat-j
urday, though only two of those J
led to Sun Devil runs.
Stanford's No. 1 starter Mike!
Mussina suffered the loss Friday,!
dropping his record to 2-3. Mus-|
sina was coming off his finest out-1
ing ever, a two-hit, 12-strikeout [
performance in a 2-0 win over the j
Bears.
Mussina was touched for five J
runs in four innings before
leaving the game with soreness in
his elbow. According to Marquess,
the Cardinal ace will throw lightly
in practice today to check his prog
ress.
ASU's top starter, left-hander
Rusty Kilgo, tossed a complete
game three hitter at Stanford in
the opener, lowering his ERA to
a paltry 2.10 while lifting his
record to 3-2.
Saturday the Cardinal bats

came alive to keep things inter
esting until the seventh, when the
Devils busted open a 5-5 tie with
three runs on four hits. ASU
scored twice in the eighth to put
the game on ice.
The game seesawed back and
forth through six innings, as the
lead changed hands four times.
After Stanford took a 1-0 lead in
the bottom of the second, Arizona
St. responded with three in the
third.
With its back against the wall,
the Cardinal retaliated by scoring

three in the bottom of the inning.
Frank Carey doubled to left
center and moved to third on Troy
Paulsen's deep fly to left. Paul
Carey walked, and then took off
on a 3-0 pitch to cleanup hitter
Tim Griffin. Griffin ripped a
double down the left-field line to
score Carey and Carey, and the
Cardinal led 4-3. Yet Stanford
could muster just one other rally
of more than one run all weekend,
and the Sun Devil offensive ma
chine never even stopped to idle.
Right-hander Stan Spencer (0-

4) gamely hung in the contest
without his best stuff. He lasted
through seven, surrendering eight
runs (six earned) on 10 hits. He
was undone by some shoddy de
fense and four base hits in the
seventh, as the Cardinal came un
glued with a pair of costly errors
to help ASU take command of a
close game.
Saturday's contest saw a mys
terious benching of All-America
candidate Paul Carey to start the
seventh inning. Marquess was
asked why he benched one of his
top hitters with the game tied 5-5.
"He hadn't been hitting the ball
real well. (Ryan) Turner has
swung the bat well against left
handed pitching. Ryan deserved a
chance to play," Marquess said.
A scary moment almost ruined
the weekend for everyone yester
day. The Devils' freshman sensa
tion Mike Kelly hit a sharp
grounder at Stanford third base
man David Holbrook. The ball
took a wicked hop and caught
Holbrook on the left cheekbone,
just below the eye.
According to Marquess, the x
rays showed no fracture.
Holbrook, a freshman, has been
one of the most consistent
performers for the Cardinal all
season. His .346 average currently
leads the team ahead of senior
Tim Griffin's .336. Holbrook was
3-for-3 Saturday with two singles,
a double and two RBI.

yesterday's loss to Arizona State.
