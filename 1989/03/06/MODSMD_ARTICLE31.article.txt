# Spikers continue roll, crush Irvine

### John Kirks Staff writer 
Saturday night, the UC-Irvine Anteaters invaded
Maples Pavilion hoping to sneak up on the home
standing Cardinal. Riding the play of outside hitter
Paul Hielemann, which had been very solid of late,
Irvine thought that it might have a fighting chance
against the mighty Cardinal.
After the 15-2, 15-4, 15-10 drubbing at the hands
of Stanford two nights ago, however, the Anteaters
realized just how wrong they were.

In a match in which the Cardinal established its
dominance early and then coasted to the victory,
Stanford Coach Fred Sturm was able to examine a
little more closely exactly what some of his non
starters were capable of doing.
Sturm seemed extremely pleased with his team's
performance, and very appropriately so. When asked
about the match, he shrugged his shoulders, smiled,
and stated, "I thought we played a very good game."
In a lighthearted post-match chat in the Cardinal
locker room, Sturm and setter Ryan O' Hara dis
cussed the match. Sturm thought that O'Hara had
played very well, pointing not only to his setting
but also to his blocking prowess.
O'Hara maintained his feverish assists per game
pace, tallying 18 for the match — just under his
18.5 average for the season. In addition, O'Hara
tallied a fistful of blocks.
Maybe the most impressive performance by a
reserve was turned in by hitter Ryan Moos, who
flirted with the team-high total in two categories:
he had six kills and six digs.
Also stellar was hitter John Alstrom, who logged
six kills of his own. The two hitters' strong perform
ances contributed to the Cardinal's team hitting
percentage that exceeded .300 for yet another time
this season.
On a night when his team hit below .000 for the
match, Anteater hitter Paul Hiedemann was the
lone standout on his team. The Irvine star recorded
a match-high 11 kills for a very impressive percent
age of .479. But, when push came to shove, the
Cardinal regulars were just too much for Hiedemann
and his teammates to handle.
Stanford All-American Dan Hanan continued to
display the form that has propelled him into the
top ten in all five of the Western Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association statistical categories:
hitting percentage, kill average, blocking, ace

Freshman outside hitter Ryan Moos soars for a kill. The Stanford
men's volleyball team has been destroying top notch opponents
as of late.
