# Swimmers fail in effort to qualify at Cal

### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY — The pool was the same
but the result was different.
The Stanford women's swim team re
turned to California's Spieker Natato
rium for the California Invitational only
three weeks after the teams competed
in a dual meet there. But while the
Cardinal handily defeated the Golden
Bears 104-45 in that dual meet, Cal
had the upper hand Friday.
The meet served as a last chance for
swimmers to record qualifying times for
the NCAA Championships and in that
respect the Cardinal came up empty.
While Stanford already had 18

qualifiers, one more than the team can
take to the NCAA meet, three freshmen
tried, unsuccessfuly, to add their names
to the list.
Valerie Paz Soldan provided the high
light for the Cardinal, swimming to a
season-best time in the 1,650 yard free
style by six seconds, then coming back
one-half hour later to go three seconds
under her previous season-best in the
500 freestyle. Michelle David swam both
the 50 and 100 freestyles and Erica
Moone competed in both the 100 and
200 butterflies but both came up short
of the NCAA cuts.
Eva Mortensen also competed for
Stanford, swimming the 1,650 freestyle.
Mortensen'a time in the 400-meter free

style in the Olympic Games (she com
peted for Denmark) qualified her for
the NCAA meet but she was trying to
record a qualifiyng time during the col
legiate season.
California's Kristin Kuhlman found
success Friday, posting a qualifying time
in the 100 backstroke to bring Cal's
total of individual qualifiers to 10.
The team of Kristin Winn, Lisa
Meyers, Amy Tidball and Sarah Ander
son was on a pace to qualify but was
disqualified when Anderson dove in
early on the anchor leg. The same four
swimmers came back 45 minutes later
to swim the event (legally) in three
minutes, 23.48 seconds, well under the
qualifying time of 3:25.00.
