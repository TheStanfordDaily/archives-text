### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Though the always cautious Frank
Brennan, Stanford's women's tennis
coach, doesn't want to hear this, it must
be said: At this point, the Cardinal is
not only an overwhelming favorite to
win its fourth straight NCAA title, they
should do it without losing a match all
season.
The reason? No. 1-ranked Stanford
cruised through the quarterfinals and
semifinals of this weekend's National
Team Indoor Tennis Championships in
Madison, Wis., before shutting out No.
2 Florida yesterday, 6-0.

Cardinal wins
National Team Indoors

The three wins, all over previously
undefeated squads ranked in the top 10,
pushed the Cardinal's season record to
12-0.
As has been the case all season, the
Cardinal was led by sophomore Tami
Whitlinger. The All-American from
Neenah, Wis., bested Florida's Nicole
Arendt 6-0, 6-4.
Teri Whitlinger, like her sister, made
the best x>f the homecoming, defeating
Andrea Berger in three sets 2-6, 6-2,

In the other matches, only freshman
sensation Debbie Graham, at No. 4,
joined Teri Whitlinger in needing three
sets. Graham knocked off Holly Lloyd
2-6. 6-4, 6-2.
The rest were straight-set wins for

Stanford. Sandra Birch overcame the
player with the best name in the tourney
by beating Ingelise Driehuis 6-2, 7-5 at
No. 2. Lisa Green defeated Holly Dan
forth 6-2, 7-6 (7-1), at No. 3. And, Kylie

For the tournament, the Cardinal
played 24 singles matches and scored
23 wins. Of those victories, 19 were in
straight sets.
The one loss came in the semifinals,
where the Cardinal downed UCLA, the
nation's third-ranked team. The Bruins'
Mamie Ceniza defeated Green 6-3, 7-6
(7-3).
The good news Saturday was that
Eleni Rossides saw her first singles ac
tion in some time. Rossides showed no
rustiness in beating Debbie LaFranchi
6-4, 6-1 at No. 6. Rossides skipped Sun
day's match.
Tami Whitlinger won an unusually
long first-set tiebreaker in beating Jes
sica Emmons 7-6 (10-8), 6-3. Birch sailed
past Alysia May 6-4, 7-5. Graham over
whelmed Stella Sampras 6-4, 6-2. Ten
