## Golfers take fifth at San Jose 
### 
The Stanford women's golf team beat out
the defending NCAA champions and a host
of other Top 20 teams as the Cardinal took
fifth in the Lady Spartan Invitational at
San Jose State this weekend.
Jodi Figley, the standout sophomore, en
tered the final round yesterday in second
place before finally settling for 13th to lead
Stanford. "I think the team did great, in
comparison with our last two tournaments.
We were more consistent, and it was a
tough course," Figley said, who shot 229
for the tournament.
Indeed, the Cardinal had its lowest round
of the year (in relation to the course dif
ficulty rating) on Saturday when the team
shot a 307. Along with first and last efforts
of 313 and 311, the score gave 16th-ranked
Stanford a 931 total, five shots behind
fourth-place UCLA.
Freshman Adele Moore also hit well,
shooting a 231 and coming in 20th out of
75 golfers at the prestigious 15-team event.
Last year, Stanford finished 11, and this
year's field was no easier, containing nine
of the top 10 teams in the country. The
Cardinal will likely move up in the rankings
after this weekend.

Stephanie Parel, the team veteran as a
junior, was satisfied with the team's per
formance because she feels the best is yet
to come. "We know we're going to be
awesome pretty soon," Parel said. "But
you can't go from bad to awesome. You
have to take intermediate steps, and this
was a starting point for us."
Freshman Stephanie Davis was third for
Stanford with a 236, and she was followed
by Parel at 240 and Audrey Wooding at
241. But the weekend belonged to Figley,
who is having her second impressive season
for the Cardinal.
"Overall, I was happy with the way I
played. I hit the ball a lot better than I
have been. I was hitting the ball really well
the week before, and I was confident. Half
the reason why I played bad today was
that I lost that confidence," said Figley,;
who had a disappointing 81 after a pair of
74s on Friday and Saturday on Bayonet!
Course.
Still, the team did well enough to gather
some momentum for their next tourna
ment, three weeks from now. The team
