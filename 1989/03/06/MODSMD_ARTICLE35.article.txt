The last time the Stanford
women's gymnastics team
traveled to Oregon State, missed
balance beam routines marred an
otherwise superb effort and Stan
ford narrowly lost to their hosts.

Women's Gymnastics
Cardinal 6th at Pac 10s

Last Saturday at the Pacific 10
Conference championships held at
Oregon State, the team suc
cumbed again to their Achilles'
heel, the balance beam, and ended
up sixth out of seven. Although
performances on the other three
events sparkled, the miserable
start on beam held the Cardinal
to a mediocre 186.55 total points.
UCLA, the favorite going into
the meet, took first place with an
outstanding 195.20. Host Oregon
State placed second with 193.65,
lead by Joy Selig, who scored three
9.90s to finish first in the indi
vidual all-around. Arizona State
(191.10) edged rival Arizona
(190.00) and Washington (188.70)
finished fifth. Bringing up the
rear was California (185.00).
Stanford, hoping to beat Wash
ington for a fourth seed at NCAA
regionals, disappointedly lived up
to its record rather than its po
tential.
Ranked sixth in the Pac-10
before the meet with a 185.43
average, the squad only bettered
that average by a point and
retained the same ranking. And,

as has often happened, they fell
off the beam.
Stanford Coach Homer Sardina
said the problem lies in too much
thinking. The girls "start thinking
'I'm going to fall' and they become
cautious, instead of attacking the
routines," he said.
Freshman Denise Villars said
"We had a shaky start on beam
and missing five or six routines
really killed.us. But we picked up
the pieces and came back strong."
Villars provided some of that
strength with a 9.55 on bars and
a 9.50 on floor. The most out
standing Cardinal performance
came from senior co-captain Sheri
Evenson who, after a season-low
last Monday, turned in her
season-high in the all-around,
placing thirteenth with a 37.85.
Evenson has consistently led the
team all season, and her talent
and leadership elicit comments
from all corners.
Also encouraging were junior
co-captain Dina Amoroso's 9.60
on uneven bars and 9.50 on floor.
Amoroso has been coming off an
ankle injury, competing in only
two or three events, but when she
moves back into the all-around,
she will be counted on for solid
performances in NCAA post
season competition.
Eor the last two regular season
meets, Friday at UC-Davis and
Sunday at home against Califor
nia, Stanford needs to register
some excellent scores if they hope
to capture the fourth seed from
Washington, a rather difficult
task considering the Cardinal has
now lost to the Huskies all three
times they have met.
