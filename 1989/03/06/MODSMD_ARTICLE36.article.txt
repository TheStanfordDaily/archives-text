# Badgering from the bench
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Senior staff writer 
Two different coaches, two
different styles.
In the first base dugout you
have Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess — chatty, excited,
and always shouting words of
encouragement to his players
on the field. He has a lifetime
winning percentage of .657 in
cluding consecutive College
World Series pennants.
On the third base side sits
Arizona State Coach Jim Brock
— intense and brooding. This
is a man who once said, "If
[my tacticsl ticked them off,
that's great." He'll do anything
to win, and has a .729 winning
percentage and two national
titles to show for it.
How these coaches influence
their players was evident this
weekend. Over the course of
the three-game series, the um
pires issued four warnings to
the Sun Devil bench for "bench
jockeying" — a form of psycho
logical warfare practiced by op
posing dugouts in an effort to
rattle the fielders' and pitchers'
concentration. The Stanford

dugout was never repri
manded.
"Bench jockeying" is not il
legal or even frowned upon in
college baseball, but when spe
cific names are called, the um
pires get into the act.
"They just were calling guys
by names and I told them to
shut up," home plate umpire
Tony Patch said after Satur
day's game, in which he issued
three separate warnings to the
Sun Devil bench.
While Marquess only allows
positive chatter from his bench,
Brock's aforementioned obses
sion with winning means that
nothing is sacred to the ASU
bench jockeyers.
"We were just calling names
out. I think it's fair play," Sun
Devil center fielder Dan Rum
sey said.
"Most teams do it," Cardinal
shortstop Troy Paulsen said.
"They'll single somebody out.
The pitcher is usually the ob
ject.
"[The verbal abuse] comes
with baseball. Arizona State,
Fullerton State and Santa Bar
bara are really bad," he added.
