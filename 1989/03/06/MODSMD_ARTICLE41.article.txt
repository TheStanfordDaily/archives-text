# American League head wins Stanford honors
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Dr. Bobby Brown, president of
Mtyor League Baseball's Ameri
can League, has been elected to
the baseball halls of fame at three
different universities — Stanford,
UCLA and Tulane — which is no
small feat.
Therefore, when Brown re
ceived The Stanford Athletic
Board's Distinguished Achieve
ment Medal Friday and called it
"the most important award I've
(ever) received," you know he felt
something special.
"One thing that impressed me
most about Stanford was that
they had that Honor Code,"
Brown said. "All through my life
I've tried to live by that [code]."
Brown was the 14th recipient
of the award, created by the board
in 1968. It seeks to honor Stan
ford athletes who "have made an
outstanding contribution or
achievement that has made a valu
able and significant impact on so
ciety."
During his eight-year career as
a third baseman for the New York
Yankees, Brown completed his
medical studies. At age 29, he
retired from baseball to become

'The most impor
tant award I've
(ever) received.'
— Bobby Brown

a cardiologist. Brown practiced
medicine for 26 years "without
missing even one day in my office
due to illness."
Thirty-one years after leaving
baseball to become a doctor,
Brown was tapped to run the
American League, a position he
holds today.
In his remarks at Friday night's
event, Brown left the 100-person
crowd in stitches relating stories
from his playing days. Especially
humorous were his anecdotes
about rooming with Yogi Berra.
Brown related Berra's excuse
for being unable to hit well during
spring training in Florida: "I can't
hit a ball down here, the humility
is too thick." He recalled Berra
saying that baseball is "90 percent
mental and the other half is phys
ical."
