Depending on asbestos readings
today, third floor residents of
Paloma House may move back
into their rooms as early as 2:00
this afternoon, Dean of Student
Affairs Norm Robinson said yes
terday.
The 27 students, who were
evacuated from their rooms early
last week because of an asbestos
leak, will be told when they may
return to their rooms at a noon
meeting today in the Paloma
lounge.
In a related development, offi
cials in Housing and Food Serv
ices and the Office of Operations

and Maintenance met last Thurs
day to further define the proce
dures used by workers when
dealing with asbestos.
Three weeks ago, workers, who
had not been trained to recognize
asbestos hazards there, cut holes
in the wall of a Paloma dorm
room and in a corridor.
According to Robinson, the Uni
versity had originally hoped to
move the students back in last
Friday, but unacceptable levels of
asbestos were found remaining in
one of the rooms. Students will
return to their rooms by Tuesday
at "the latest," Robinson said.
"We learned that one room
(room 318, where workers cut a
hole in a wall) had to be cleaned

again." This kept the students in
their temporary housing over the
weekend, he said.
Students were housed in rooms
at Hyatt Rickeys Hotel in Palo
Alto, Escondido Village and a
guest room in Alondra House.
Some made arrangements to stay
with friends or relatives.
According to Director of Stu
dent Housing Keith Guy, the as
bestos level in room 318 on Friday
was .02 fibers per cubic centime
ter.
Although this is far below the
danger level of .25 asbestos fibers
per cubic centimeter set by the
U.S. Occupational Safety and
