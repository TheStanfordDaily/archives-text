# Campus consistently conserves, but water problem not dead yet

Although Stanford has con
served more water than its Bay
Area neighbors during one of the
worst-ever droughts in Northern
California, University officials
warn that the worst is probably
still to come.
"We're doing OK now, with the
recent rains we've had. But that
doesn't mean we won't have
serious problems," said Cheryl
Jensen, manager of Operations
and Maintenance.
While nearby Bay Area cities
are facing mandatory cutbacks

and strict rationing, Stanford's di
lemma is not so serious because
the University started saving last
spring.
Last May, the San Francisco
Water District, which supplies
Stanford with almost all of its
drinking water, imposed a man
datory 25 percent cutback for its
water users. In the end, Stanford
cut water use 40 percent during
the summer.
"The Santa Clara Valley [Water
District] didn't cut back last year,
and now they're facing a bit of a
drastic situation," Jensen said.
"We've already been there."
Beginning April 1, San Jose res

idents will have to cut back water
usage by 45 percent from 1987
levels. Severe regulations on yard
watering, car washing, landscap
ing and other activities will be
enforced with fines, according to
San Jose Water Company
spokesperson Richard Balocco.
Santa Clara Valley sells water to
the San Jose Water Company,
which serves 745,000 residents.
Another reason for Stanford's
relatively secure position during
the drought has been an aggres
sive campaign by the Housing En
ergy Conservation Center, which
