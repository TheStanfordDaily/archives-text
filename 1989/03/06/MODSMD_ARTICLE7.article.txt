# Campus consistently conserves, but water problem not dead yet
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
Although Stanford has con
served more water than its Bay
Area neighbors during one of the
worst-ever droughts in Northern
California, University officials
warn that the worst is probably
still to come.
"We're doing OK now, with the
recent rains we've had. But that
doesn't mean we won't have
serious problems," said Cheryl
Jensen, manager of Operations
and Maintenance.
While nearby Bay Area cities
are facing mandatory cutbacks

and strict rationing, Stanford's di
lemma is not so serious because
the University started saving last
spring.
Last May, the San Francisco
Water District, which supplies
Stanford with almost all of its
drinking water, imposed a man
datory 25 percent cutback for its
water users. In the end, Stanford
cut water use 40 percent during
the summer.
"The Santa Clara Valley [Water
District] didn't cut back last year,
and now they're facing a bit of a
drastic situation," Jensen said.
"We've already been there."
Beginning April 1, San Jose res

idents will have to cut back water
usage by 45 percent from 1987
levels. Severe regulations on yard
watering, car washing, landscap
ing and other activities will be
enforced with fines, according to
San Jose Water Company
spokesperson Richard Balocco.
Santa Clara Valley sells water to
the San Jose Water Company,
which serves 745,000 residents.
Another reason for Stanford's
relatively secure position during
the drought has been an aggres
sive campaign by the Housing En
ergy Conservation Center, which
has resulted in significant reduc
tions in water use at campus res
idences this year.
Coordinator Julie Coopet said
water flow restrictors were in
stalled in sink faucets, shower
heads and toilets in all University
residences this fall.
The way the campus is metered
for water prevents officials from
getting statistical data for large
dormitories, but some fraternities
and Row Houses have been mon
itored, with mostly positive
results.
According to Coopet, in 11 mon
itored houses, water use this year
decreased 20 to 40 percent over
the same period last year. Con
sumption ranged from a 45 per
cent decrease in Haus Mit
teleuropa to an unaccounted for

10 percent increase in Delta Tau
Delta Fraternity.
The University was fined for
using too much water last August,
September and October, but there
have been no fines since, Coopet
added. However, allotments for
the winter months are generally
more manageable anyway — the
crunch will come in the summer
months, when the University
needs water to do landscaping.
And despite the good news
about cutbacks so far this year,
University officials admitted that,
from here on out, anything can
happen. The weather will deter
mine whether the University has
to plan for a passing problem or
a serious crisis.
Dave Williamson of the Na
tional Weather Service in San
Francisco said rainfall for the
month of February was 62 percent
of normal at San Francisco Air
port and was only 57 percent of
normal in San Jose. During the

same month last year, rainfall was
82 percent of normal in San Jose.
There is a 55 percent chance of
rainfall being above normal in the
Bay Area during March, William
son added. However, there are no
statistics for precipitation in the
Sierra, which provides Bay Area
cities with most of their water.
The San Francisco Water Dis
trict's required 25 percent cutback
is still in effect, but that might
change in April, when the District
measures the moisture content of
the Sierra snowpack and decides
how severe the cutbacks will be
this spring and summer.
In the meantime, the University
is preparing for the worst. A
drought impact committee, made
up of staff from Operations and
Maintenance, housing and other
University departments, has been
meeting to figure out how to cope
with the water shortage.
Jensen said that it's "pretty def
inite" that Lake Lagunita will not

be filled this year. Jensen made
a similar prediction last month.
Energy Management Specialist
Scott Gould said that, in addition
to housing, there is a big push to
make cutbacks in grounds main
tenance. Outdoor watering has
been reduced in most areas from
three times a week to two, and
in some areas the grass is being
allowed to die.
While some are perplexed by
the University's insistence on
watering during a drought, Gould
said it would be expensive to let
areas die where the University
has spent large amounts of money
landscaping. In addition, the au
tomatic sprinklers have to be
flushed out frequently to avoid
damage that would cost thousands
of dollars to fix.
Gould added that Stanford does
use groundwater and a lake water
system for sources of non
drinkable water.

added. However, allotments for
the winter months are generally
more manageable anyway — the
crunch will come in the summer
months, when the University
needs water to do landscaping.
And despite the good news
about cutbacks so far this year,
University officials admitted that,
from here on out, anything can
happen. The weather will deter
mine whether the University has
to plan for a passing problem or
a serious crisis.
Dave Williamson of the Na
tional Weather Service in San
Francisco said rainfall for the
month of February was 62 percent
of normal at San Francisco Air
port and was only 57 percent of
normal in San Jose. During the

same month last year, rainfall was
82 percent of normal in San Jose.
There is a 55 percent chance of
rainfall being above normal in the
Bay Area during March, William
son added. However, there are no
statistics for precipitation in the
Sierra, which provides Bay Area
cities with most of their water.
The San Francisco Water Dis
trict's required 25 percent cutback
is still in effect, but that might
change in April, when the District
measures the moisture content of
the Sierra snowpack and decides
how severe the cutbacks will be
this spring and summer.
In the meantime, the University
is preparing for the worst. A
drought impact committee, made
up of staff from Operations and
Maintenance, housing and other
University departments, has been
meeting to figure out how to cope
with the water shortage.
Jensen said that it's "pretty def
inite" that Lake Lagunita will not

be filled this year. Jensen made
a similar prediction last month.
Energy Management Specialist
Scott Gould said that, in addition
to housing, there is a big push to
make cutbacks in grounds main
tenance. Outdoor watering has
been reduced in most areas from
three times a week to two, and
in some areas the grass is being
allowed to die.
While some are perplexed by
the University's insistence on
watering during a drought, Gould
said it would be expensive to let
areas die where the University
has spent large amounts of money
landscaping. In addition, the au
tomatic sprinklers have to be
flushed out frequently to avoid
damage that would cost thousands
of dollars to fix.
Gould added that Stanford does
use groundwater and a lake water
system for sources of non
drinkable water.
Although Stanford has con
served more water than its Bay
Area neighbors during one of the
worst-ever droughts in Northern
California, University officials
warn that the worst is probably
still to come.
"We're doing OK now, with the
recent rains we've had. But that
doesn't mean we won't have
serious problems," said Cheryl
Jensen, manager of Operations
and Maintenance.
While nearby Bay Area cities
are facing mandatory cutbacks

and strict rationing, Stanford's di
lemma is not so serious because
the University started saving last
spring.
Last May, the San Francisco
Water District, which supplies
Stanford with almost all of its
drinking water, imposed a man
datory 25 percent cutback for its
water users. In the end, Stanford
cut water use 40 percent during
the summer.
"The Santa Clara Valley [Water
District] didn't cut back last year,
and now they're facing a bit of a
drastic situation," Jensen said.
"We've already been there."
Beginning April 1, San Jose res

idents will have to cut back water
usage by 45 percent from 1987
levels. Severe regulations on yard
watering, car washing, landscap
ing and other activities will be
enforced with fines, according to
San Jose Water Company
spokesperson Richard Balocco.
Santa Clara Valley sells water to
the San Jose Water Company,
which serves 745,000 residents.
Another reason for Stanford's
relatively secure position during
the drought has been an aggres
sive campaign by the Housing En
ergy Conservation Center, which
has resulted in significant reduc
tions in water use at campus res
idences this year.
Coordinator Julie Coopet said
water flow restrictors were in
stalled in sink faucets, shower
heads and toilets in all University
residences this fall.
The way the campus is metered
for water prevents officials from
getting statistical data for large
dormitories, but some fraternities
and Row Houses have been mon
itored, with mostly positive
results.
According to Coopet, in 11 mon
itored houses, water use this year
decreased 20 to 40 percent over
the same period last year. Con
sumption ranged from a 45 per
cent decrease in Haus Mit
teleuropa to an unaccounted for

10 percent increase in Delta Tau
Delta Fraternity.
The University was fined for
using too much water last August,
September and October, but there
have been no fines since, Coopet
added. However, allotments for
the winter months are generally
more manageable anyway — the
crunch will come in the summer
months, when the University
needs water to do landscaping.
