# Cardinal women capture Pac-10 Conference title
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Just four years ago, when Coach Tara
VanDerveer and a class of three fresh
men made their first appearances on
the Farm, the annual road trip to Ari
zona was a dreaded journey. Arizona
State, and especially Arizona, prevailed
regularly, making the southward excur
sion a guaranteed blemish on an already
beleaguered record.

Finally, Stanford has turned the
tables. Blowing past Arizona 95-56 Fri
day evening and scoring a Pacific 10
Conference-record 108-72 win over Ari
zona State, the Cardinal has at last
earned the conference championship
that has eluded the squad since its in
ception.
With its 16-0 league mark and a three
game lead over second place Washington
with just two games remaining, Stanford
has clinched the title and the automatic
NCAA Tournamnent berth that accom
panies it. Moreover, with an overall
record of 24-2, a No. 4 ranking in the
Associated Press poll and a Pac-10 record

18-game win streak, the team is closing
in on top-seed status in the West Region.
"We're excited about winning the Pac
-10," VanDerveer beamed. "Winning is
a habit that people are developing and
enjoying.
"Things have come full circle. I re
member being in Arizona when it wasn't
a fun trip. During Evon (Asforis) and
Jill [Yankel's freshman year (1985-86),
Arizona beat us three times."
In the past three meetings, however,
the Cardinal has done the beating. Ear
lier this season, Stanford destroyed the
Wildcats 94-68 in Maples Pavilion, set
ting a precedent for Friday's game in
McKale Center.
The Cardinal seized control at the out
set, scoring consistently until the
halftime buzzer ceased action with the
score reading 43-31 Stanford. The Wild
cats held the lead on one occasion, at
11-10, but a quick Katy Steding 16-foot
bank put the Cardinal ahead for good.
In the second half, the visitors relin
quished no ground as they outscored
Arizona 52-25 in the final 20 minutes.
"This weekend was kind of a replay
of the Oregon and Oregon State games,"
VanDerveer said. "We came out strong,
built a lead and played even better in
the second half."
The series was also a deja vu
experience for guard Jennifer
Azzi, who led the Cardinal's
scoring effort both games last
weekend. While forward Trisha
Stevens topped Azzi's 17 points
by one against the Wildcats, Az
zi's 21 points the following eve
ning led all players.
Steding also notched some im
pressive numbers, including 15
first-half points Friday night to
push her past the 1,000 career
points milestone. She tallied the
same total the next night, along
with grabbing eight rebounds.
But the finest play of the
weekend was exhibited by guard
Sonja Henning, especially in Sat
urday's scoring festival in ASU's
University Activity Center.
Though the game was delayed
for 30 minutes to accomodate
the state high school basketball
championships, the lapse hardly
affected Stanford's starting
point guard.
When the game finally com
menced, Henning orchestrated
an offense so potent that the Sun
Devils could not compensate.
Dishing off a game-high eight
assists, Henning also added 14
points of her own as well as a
game-high eight rebounds.
"Sonja is really the focal point
out there," VanDerveer said.
"Her biggest asset is never
reflected in the box score: her
thinking."
What the box score did show
was a Pac-10 record level of
scoring. The 108 points garnered
by the Cardinal broke the record
for a conference game set in last
weekend's 107-73 trouncing of
Oregon, and the game marked

Moreover, the contest gave
every player on the Stanford
traveling squad the opportunity
to score. With most of the
starters benched after the first
few minutes of the second half,
the reserves took over and actu
ally increased the Cardinal's
lead.
"No one really played a lot —

game," VanDerveer noted. "We

weekend. While forward Trisha

ning led all players.
Steding also notched some im
pressive numbers, including 15
first-half points Friday night to
push her past the 1,000 career
points milestone. She tallied the
same total the next night, along
with grabbing eight rebounds.
But the finest play of the
weekend was exhibited by guard
Sonja Henning, especially in Sat
urday's scoring festival in ASU's
University Activity Center.
Though the game was delayed
for 30 minutes to accomodate
the state high school basketball
championships, the lapse hardly
affected Stanford's starting
point guard.
When the game finally com
menced, Henning orchestrated
an offense so potent that the Sun
Devils could not compensate.
Dishing off a game-high eight
assists, Henning also added 14
points of her own as well as a
game-high eight rebounds.
"Sonja is really the focal point
out there," VanDerveer said.
"Her biggest asset is never
reflected in the box score: her
thinking."
What the box score did show
was a Pac-10 record level of
scoring. The 108 points garnered
by the Cardinal broke the record
for a conference game set in last
weekend's 107-73 trouncing of
Oregon, and the game marked

Guard Sonja Henning came two assists and two rebounds away
from a triple double against ASU Saturday, contributing to a
record setting 108-point performance by the Cardinal.
Just four years ago, when Coach Tara
VanDerveer and a class of three fresh
men made their first appearances on
the Farm, the annual road trip to Ari
zona was a dreaded journey. Arizona
State, and especially Arizona, prevailed
regularly, making the southward excur
sion a guaranteed blemish on an already
beleaguered record.

Finally, Stanford has turned the
tables. Blowing past Arizona 95-56 Fri
day evening and scoring a Pacific 10
Conference-record 108-72 win over Ari
zona State, the Cardinal has at last
earned the conference championship
that has eluded the squad since its in
ception.
With its 16-0 league mark and a three
game lead over second place Washington
with just two games remaining, Stanford
has clinched the title and the automatic
NCAA Tournamnent berth that accom
panies it. Moreover, with an overall
record of 24-2, a No. 4 ranking in the
Associated Press poll and a Pac-10 record

18-game win streak, the team is closing
in on top-seed status in the West Region.
"We're excited about winning the Pac
-10," VanDerveer beamed. "Winning is
a habit that people are developing and
enjoying.
"Things have come full circle. I re
member being in Arizona when it wasn't
a fun trip. During Evon (Asforis) and
Jill [Yankel's freshman year (1985-86),
Arizona beat us three times."
In the past three meetings, however,
the Cardinal has done the beating. Ear
lier this season, Stanford destroyed the
Wildcats 94-68 in Maples Pavilion, set
ting a precedent for Friday's game in
McKale Center.
The Cardinal seized control at the out
set, scoring consistently until the
halftime buzzer ceased action with the
score reading 43-31 Stanford. The Wild
cats held the lead on one occasion, at
11-10, but a quick Katy Steding 16-foot
bank put the Cardinal ahead for good.
In the second half, the visitors relin
quished no ground as they outscored
Arizona 52-25 in the final 20 minutes.
"This weekend was kind of a replay
of the Oregon and Oregon State games,"
VanDerveer said. "We came out strong,
built a lead and played even better in
the second half."
The series was also a deja vu
experience for guard Jennifer
Azzi, who led the Cardinal's
scoring effort both games last
weekend. While forward Trisha
Stevens topped Azzi's 17 points
by one against the Wildcats, Az
zi's 21 points the following eve
