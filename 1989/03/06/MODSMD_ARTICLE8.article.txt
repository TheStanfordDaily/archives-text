# Cardinal women capture Pac-10 Conference title
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Just four years ago, when Coach Tara
VanDerveer and a class of three fresh
men made their first appearances on
the Farm, the annual road trip to Ari
zona was a dreaded journey. Arizona
State, and especially Arizona, prevailed
regularly, making the southward excur
sion a guaranteed blemish on an already
beleaguered record.

Finally, Stanford has turned the
tables. Blowing past Arizona 95-56 Fri
day evening and scoring a Pacific 10
Conference-record 108-72 win over Ari
zona State, the Cardinal has at last
earned the conference championship
that has eluded the squad since its in
ception.
With its 16-0 league mark and a three
game lead over second place Washington
with just two games remaining, Stanford
has clinched the title and the automatic
NCAA Tournamnent berth that accom
panies it. Moreover, with an overall
record of 24-2, a No. 4 ranking in the
Associated Press poll and a Pac-10 record

18-game win streak, the team is closing
in on top-seed status in the West Region.
"We're excited about winning the Pac
-10," VanDerveer beamed. "Winning is
a habit that people are developing and
enjoying.
"Things have come full circle. I re
member being in Arizona when it wasn't
a fun trip. During Evon (Asforis) and
Jill [Yankel's freshman year (1985-86),
Arizona beat us three times."
In the past three meetings, however,
the Cardinal has done the beating. Ear
lier this season, Stanford destroyed the
Wildcats 94-68 in Maples Pavilion, set
ting a precedent for Friday's game in
McKale Center.
The Cardinal seized control at the out
set, scoring consistently until the
halftime buzzer ceased action with the
score reading 43-31 Stanford. The Wild
cats held the lead on one occasion, at
11-10, but a quick Katy Steding 16-foot
bank put the Cardinal ahead for good.
In the second half, the visitors relin
quished no ground as they outscored
Arizona 52-25 in the final 20 minutes.
"This weekend was kind of a replay
of the Oregon and Oregon State games,"
VanDerveer said. "We came out strong,
built a lead and played even better in
the second half."
