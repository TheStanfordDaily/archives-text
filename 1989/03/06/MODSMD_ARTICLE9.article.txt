# Congressman Bill Gray:
## Affirming the Democrats' domain 
### Sherrell Evans Staff writer 
"George Bush understands if
you are going to be effective as
president, you have to deal with
the legislative branch, and that
legislative branch is firmly in the
hands of the Democrats," said
Rep. Bill Gray, D-Penn., in a
speech Friday afternoon.
Gray is chair of the House
Democratic Caucus and the
fourth most powerful person in
the U.S. House of Representa
tives.
In a program sponsored by the
Black Business Students Associa
tion, Gray said Democrats have
been unable to capture the
presidency since 1976 because,
since Jimmy Carter, they have not
found a candidate strong on both
national defense and domestic is
sues.
Addressing a standing room
only crowd in a Business School
classroom, Gray focused most of
his talk on budget questions.
According to Gray, the two most

pressing goals of the new Bush
administration and Congress are
to reduce the federal debt and to
balance the nation's budget. Gray
was chair of the House Budget
Committee for four years before
assuming his current position.
Gray said when George Bush
assumed the presidency in Janu
ary, he expected his policies to be
very different from Ronald
Reagan's.
Bush "talked about the good
government can do â€” you would
have never expected Ronald
Reagan to talk about what the
good government could do," Gray
said. Reagan believed that "the
least amount of government was
the best" and that government is
inherently bad, he added.
In his State of the Union ad
dress shortly after assuming the
presidency, Bush also espoused
Democratic values and goals, ac
cording to Gray. "He had the rhet
oric of a kinder and gentler
America,"he said.
However, many members of
Congress were shocked after re

ceiving the Feb. 24 presidential
budget, Gray said.
Congress had been led to believe
that Bush sympathized with
Democratic aims, "but then ...
we received the budget and the
numbers didn't quite match the
rhetoric," he added.
According to Gray, Bush's
budget allocation policies came
from the same "right-wing con
servative" vein as Reagan's. "He
called it a flexible freeze but what
he presented was a reduction of
$21 billion in domestic spending,"
he said.
The Bush budget proposal also
contains many hidden tax in
creases, Gray said, adding that
these $14.5 billion in new reve
nues will largely come from fees
for such services as the U.S. Coast
Guard and public parks.
However, these so-called "user
fees" are being used as indirect
taxes because the revenues are
not going directly back to the or
ganizations that provided the
service, Gray said.
