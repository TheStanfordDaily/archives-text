# No decision on targeting of Hawaiians
## 
### Baldwin Lee Staff writer 
Problems in establishing a University definition
of Native Hawaiians last night stalled a decision
whether to allow the Office of Undergraduate Ad
missions to target the ethnic minority.
The Committee on Undergraduate Admissions
and Financial Affairs is sympathetic to Native
Hawaiian needs, but needs more information on
how the federal government and other universities
define Native Hawaiians before it can come to a
decision, according to committee chair Dennis Phil
lips. The committee is currently investigating a num
ber of different definitions.
Dartmouth College, Pomona College, the Univer
sity of Washington and the University of Wisconsin
are the only meyor U.S. universities that target
Native Hawaiians for recruiting and admissions.
The committee is acting carefully and taking its
time because Stanford's actions will be watched
closely by other prestigious private universities, ac
cording to Phillips.
Six Native Hawaiians, four of whom will graduate
this year, are currently enrolled as Stanford under
graduates, according to senior Maile Loo, a member
of Ho'oikaika, the Native Hawaiian group at Stan
ford.
Ho'oikaika uses the definition of Native
Hawaiians provided by the most recent federal leg
islation, an education bill passed last June. Loo said
the education bill defines Native Hawaiians as
"anyone who has ancestors in Hawaii before 1778,
the year American colonists arrived at Hawaii."
Under this definition, about 220,000 Native
Hawaiians live in the United States, or .1 percent
of the total U.S. population, according to Loo.
Phillips said that this definition is one of several
the committee is considering. Phillips said he is
afraid that Ho'oikaika's definition would discrimi
nate against financially disadvantaged Native
Hawaiians who could not afford to trace their family
lineage.
The committee also wants to check other federal
legislation to see if the education bill's definition
is standard among current U.S. legislation, he said.
Phillips said that another option is to define
Native Hawaiians based upon percentage of an
cestry, otherwise known as blood quantum. In the
case of Native Americans, the federal government
defines the group as individuals with more than 25
percent Native American ancestry.
If Stanford adopts a similar definition for Native
Hawaiians incorporating ancestral percentage, the
number of U.S. citizens who are considered Native
Hawaiians would be less than under Ho'oikaika's
definition, said Phillips.
The Native Hawaiian group is not questioning
the current percentage of Native Hawaiians at Stan
ford but is apprehensive because no Native
Hawaiians have been admitted to Stanford in the
last two years, Loo said.
She added that if the University does not target
Hawaiians, she fears, "We would disappear, and no
one would know the difference."
