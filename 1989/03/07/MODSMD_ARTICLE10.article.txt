# Poll shows ethnic studies support
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg 
A majority of students support
the development of an ethnic
studies program and have no op
inion concerning the ASSU, ac
cording to results released
yesterday from the ASSU's third
straw poll.
In addition, students oppose the
University's position that un
housed fraternities will have a
"zero chance" of obtaining
housing and have no opinion
about using ASSU funds to
renovate the boathouse.
The straw poll, taken the week
of Feb. 10-16, randomly selected
113 undergraduates and 103 grad
uates to be questioned.
An overwhelming 82.3 percent
of the undergraduate students
and 77.7 percent of the graduate
students polled expressed their
support toward the establishment
of an ethnic studies program.
Only 5.1 percent of the total group
opposed the program.
Faculty members and student
leaders were pleased by the out

come of the poll and said that the
results might help their efforts to
establish an ethnic studies pro
gram.
Black Community Services Cen
ter Director Keith Archuleta said,
"I'm not surprised [about the
results], I always felt that stu
dents understood the need to have
pluralistic or multicultural pro
grams. The m£yority of students,
including white (students), would
like to know more about the his
tory of their countiy."
He expressed disappointment at
the University's failure to estab
lish an ethnic studies program.
"We should do whatever it takes
to bring in the faculty to teach
these courses — It's not hard to
find (faculty)....
"These results should go a long
way, but we'll see. I've been dis
appointed that departments are
not moving more quickly to bring
in people of color. I'm getting a
lot of excuses."
Richard Suh, issues chair of the
Asian-American Students Associ
ation said, "I think the adminis

tration has to respond and move
to developing these programs. It's
very clear cut."
Over half of all students polled
had no opinion whatsoever con
cerning the performance of the
ASSU. A majority of those who
expressed an opinion stated that
the ASSU plays a positive role on
campus. However, this response
represents only one-third of all
students polled.
In a press release, the ASSU
stated that "this [result] is quite
significant in light of the past few
years when the mtgority of stu
dents thought the ASSU was
either irrelevant or played a nega
tive role."
Over 56 percent of the under
graduates polled oppose the Uni
versity's current position that
unhoused fraternities have a
"zero chance" of obtaining a
house.
Also, 48.1 percent of the stu
dents had no opinion regarding
the use of ASSU funds to renovate
the boathouse.
