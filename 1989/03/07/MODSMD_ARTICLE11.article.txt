## Eastern operations grind to halt 5,000 workers laid off; nearly all flights cancelled as strike goes on 
### 
Strike-crippled Eastern Airlines shut down
nearly all operations yesterday and idled more
than 5,000 workers, saying it could not afford
to maintain its business because pilots were
honoring a 3-day-old Machinists walkout.
"We cannot run an airline with unpredict
ability," Eastern press representative Robin
Matell said in Miami. "We cannot continue to
inconvenience passengers. We cannot afford
the steady financial drain."
Matell said Eastern would continue to run
only its most profitable routes — its Northeast
shuttle service between Washington, New
York and Boston and three round trips weekly
between Miami, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and
Santiago, Chile.
Earlier yesterday, Eastern asked a federal
judge in Miami to order members of the Air
Lines Pilots Association to return to work.
The national pilots union, meanwhile, an
nounced plans for a job action starting this
morning that could delay every flight on vir
tually every airline in the nation.
Eastern had canceled almost all flights yes
terday, although it managed to get some of
its Northeast shuttle flights in the air despite
a snowstorm. Pan American World Airways

doubled its shuttle service to take advantage
of Eastern's troubles.
Eastern pilots have honored a strike by
8,500 mechanics and ramp service workers
that began Saturday after a 17-month labor
dispute. The strike has grounded most flights,
stranded thousands of passengers and pushed
the nation's seventh-largest airline to the
brink of collapse.
"You can't fly without pilots," Matell said.
"Obviously, an operation of this type drains
the cash very quickly. It's an hour-to-hour
evaluation for all aspects of the operation."
He said the 5,000 to 6,000 idled employees
were being notified immediately of their "no
work" status and would receive lump-sum
payments ranging from $270 to $640, depend
ing on their normal wages. The laid-off
workers include ticket and reservations
agents, secretaries and other clerical workers,
customer service workers and some managers.
The layoffs leave Eastern with about 7,000
active workers, down from 31,200 before the
strike.
Matell said Eastern would file for bank
ruptcy only as a last resort but indicated the
pilots' walkout may force the airline to con

sider the option.
"The pilots are conducting their own eco
nomic strike against the company," Matell
said. "We believe that it is an illegal weapon
to gain ALPA's economic objectives."
"We're not the ones who sought the strike,"
said John Bavis, head of the Eastern pilots
union. "This is a strike that Mr. Lorenzo
called."
He was referring to Frank Lorenzo, chair
man of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp.,
whose anti-union reputation has galvanized
Eastern's union employees.
Earlier, Matell said about 200 pilots out of
3,600 were flying, but the pilots union put
the number at 88.
As of 8 p.m. EST yesterday, when Eastern
announced its cutbacks, 69 flights had taken
off, 25 of them on the Northeast shuttle, the
airline said. Four or five more shuttle flights
were expected by the end of the day. Before
the strike, Eastern averaged 1,040 flights car
rying 100,000 people daily.
The pilots union advised members yesterday
to ignore a plea from Eastern President Phil
Bakes to return to work.
