# Soviets seek new troop reductions

VIENNA, Austria (AP) - The
Soviet Union yesterday proposed
huge reductions in troops and ar
mor and recommended that the
Warsaw Pact and NATO negotiate
to eliminate all battlefield nuclear
weapons from Europe.
Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevarndadze's proposals went
far beyond the reductions NATO
plans to suggest at conventional
arms talks that begin Thursday.
A U.S. official, briefing
reporters on condition of
anonymity, said Shevardnadze's
purpose in proposing the missile
talks was "to see whether possible
fissures in the alliance could be
developed."
"I wouldn't characterize it as
one of the most positive charac
teristics" of Shevardnadze's
speech, the official said.
Secretary of State James Baker
r told 35 foreign ministers gathered
in a baroque palace that the
West's goal, at least initially, is to
reduce the Warsaw Pact's current
advantage in conventional forces.
Estimates vary but give the
Soviet-led alliance at least a 2-1
advantage in tanks.
"The Warsaw Pact's conven
tional military preponderance, es
pecially in the spearheads of at
' tack, is what makes an invasion
possible," Baker said.
He urged Soviet President Mik
hail Gorbachev to implement the
"new thinking" that guides eco
nomic and political reform in the
Soviet Union by renouncing the
Brezhnev Doctrine "beyond any
shadow of a doubt."
That doctrine permits military
intervention in a Soviet bloc coun

try in the event of a liberal in
surrection. The late President
Leonid Brezhnev introduced it
after the Red Army crushed the
liberal "Prague Spring" of 1968
in Czechoslovakia.
"Those in the East should be
free of the fear that armed Soviet
intervention, justified by the
Brezhnev Doctrine, would be used
again to deny them choice," Baker
said.
He also said Australia would
organize a conference to prevent
the spread of chemical weapons
and the Bush administration was
exploring ways to speed the
removal of U.S. chemical weapons
from West Germany.
Baker added, however: "Uni
lateral action is not enough. The
Soviet Union has enormous stocks
of chemical weapons threatening
Europe. We therefore call on the
Soviets to join us, to accelerate
the destruction of their enormous
stockpile of these frightening
weapons."
In Bonn, Chancellor Helmut
Kohl said: "I welcome this inten
tion to explore ways for the early
removal of chemical weapons from
the Federal Republic."
Kohl's chief spokesman, Fried
helm Ost, said earlier Baker telep
honed the chancellor Saturday
night and told him the aging U.S.
chemical weapons would be
withdrawn by 1992.
Shevardnadze countered a
NATO proposal to retire at least
25,000 Warsaw Pact tanks, then
reduce armor, artillery and per
sonnel carriers on both sides by
5-10 percent with a three-phase
plan for radical cuts.
