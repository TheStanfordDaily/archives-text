### 
BEIJING (AP) — Police opened
fire on Tibetan protesters who
marched through Lhasa and
burned Chinese businesses yester
day in a second straight day of
violence. Four Tibetans were re
ported killed.
Security forces moved into the
city's Tibetan section and pulled
people from their homes, taking
some away in jeeps, American
tourists said. Chinese troops also
beat Tibetans, said the travelers,
who spoke on condition of
anonymity for fear of police
reprisal.
"One boy's face was completely
bloodied," said a man from New
Orleans. "He was no older than
10. Blood was coming from his
ears, his eyes."
The Americans and other
tourists were contacted by tele
phone in the Tibetan capital from
Beijing. As they spoke, automatic
weapons fire and exploding tear
gas canisters crackled in the back
ground. Bonfires burned in the
streets, they said.
The official Xinhua News
Agency reported one Tibetan was
killed and eight others, including
two policeman, injured in the vi
olence yesterday.
Xinhua had said 10 Tibetans
and one Chinese policeman were
killed in anti-Chinese demonstra
tions Sunday. Western travelers
quoted Tibetans as saying that
many more had died on Sunday
and that at least four Tibetans
had been slain yesterday.
The U.S. State Department yes
terday deplored the use of weap
ons on pro-independence protest
ers in Tibet and called for a res
toration of order.
"We have made clear to the Chi

nese both publicly and privately
in the past our concern for human
rights in Tibet," said spokesman
Charles Redman in Washington.
In New York, a representative
for the Dalai Lama, the Tibetans'
spiritual leader, issued a message
from the leader saying he was
"deeply saddened" by the latest
bloodshed.
"I have always tried to find a
peaceful solution to the tragic sit
uation in my country," the Dalai
Lama said.
China claims Tibet has been
part of China since the 13th cen
tury. Many Tibetans say Tibet
should be independent and led by
the Dalai Lama, who fled in exile
during the aborted uprising in
1959.
Police in Lhasa fired from roof
tops near the city's main square
late yesterday afternoon, killing
at least two Tibetans, an Ameri
can tourist quoted Tibetans as
saying.
Several hours later, security
forces fired on a group of 40 in
dependence activists as they threw
rocks at a building near the Jok
hang Temple, another tourist
said. He quoted Tibetans as say
ing at least two protesters were
killed in that incident.
Yesterday morning, thousands
of Tibetans flooded the old city,
breaking into the small Chinese
and Moslem-run stores that fill
the area, pulling out their con
tents and burning them in bon
fires along the main thoroughfare
in the city.
The crowd, made up mostly of
young men, blocked off parts of
the old city, barricading it with
metal tables and garbage cans,
witnesses said.
