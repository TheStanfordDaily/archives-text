# First Democrat announces support for Tower confirmation
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen. Howell
Heflin of Alabama yesterday became the
first Democrat to swing behind John
Tower's confirmation as defense secre
tary, delivering a boost to the
troubled nomination a few hours after
President Bush urged lawmakers to "put
aside partisanship" in the struggle.
"I will rely on his pledge and give him
a chance to prove himself," Heflin said
in a speech on the Senate floor, referring
to Tower's promise to swear off drinking
if he is confirmed to head the Pentagon.
Republican Sen. John Warner of Vir
ginia, who has helped spearhead the GOP

effort to salvage the nomination, said
Heflin's remarks would "stand out as a
jewel" in the Senate debate.
But moments after Heflin's surprise
announcement, another Southern Dem
ocrat, Sen. David Pryor of Arkansas, said
he would vote against confirmation be
cause Tower would "create more (prob
lems) than he will solve."
Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., emerg
ing from an afternoon meeting with Re
publican leaders and White House Chief
of Staff John Sununu, said: "We have a
better chance but it's still a fight."
The latest Associated Press survey

found 47 Democrats and Sen. Larry Pres
sler, R-S.D., either solidly opposed or
leaning against confirmation and 40 Re
publicans and one Democrat either
leaning for or supporting confirmation.
The Democrats hold a 55-45 edge in
the Senate.
Heflin, who had been courted by the
Bush administration, cited Tower's
qualifications; the "uncertain state of the
evidence" against the nominee, specifi
cally the allegations included in an FBI
report on the nominee; and the alcohol
promise as the reasons for his decision.
Heflin spoke a few hours after Bush

gave Tower a ringing endorsement.
"I stand by this man," Bush told a
Veterans of Foreign Wars audience. "I
stand by him because he is uniquely qual
ified as the right man to take charge of
the Pentagon."
In addition to Heflin, the Bush admin
istration has courted Sen. Bennett
Johnston, D-La., who labeled the FBI
report on Tower as "unreliable" but said
he has not made a decision on the nom
ination.
"Frankly, I think this particular FBI
report is basically unreliable," Johnston
said Sunday during a stop in Alexandria,

La. "I think there needs to be more fair
ness put into this process."
Heflin said the FBI report was "not
conclusive as to whether he had a drink
ing problem in the 1980s that impaired
his judgment on issues in his official ca
pacities."
Heflin noted Tower's no-drinking
pledge and said the "primary safeguard
against abuse or the breaking of his
pledge is the president himself. I don't
believe that President George Bush would
allow a person to serve as secretary of
defense whose conduct is a threat to na
tional security."
