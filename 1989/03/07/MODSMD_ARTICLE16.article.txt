SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A
group of biblical scholars over
whelmingly agreed that Jesus
Christ never promised to return
and usher in a new age and would
have been "appalled" about be
coming a cult figure in a new
religion, the group's founder said
yesterday.
About 100 scholars, theologians
and historians discussed the
teachings of the historical Jesus
in a three-day seminar last week
end and agreed that Jesus did not
promise a Second Coming in
which he would bring a new age
as the leader of God's kingdom.
Gospel writers and later follow
ers of Jesus were the ones who
predicted a second coming of
Jesus, most scholars participating
in the Jesus Seminar said.
"There does seem to be power
ful evidence in the Gospels that
Jesus thought the kingdom of God
was near," said Robert Funk, 50,
a New Testament expert and foun-

Second Coming and
new age.

der of the seminar. "When he
speaks of the future, he always
talks indirectly. He doesn't talk
in apocalyptic terms."
Funk said the seminar's stand
does not contradict the faith in
God expressed in the Apostles'
Creed but is at odds with many
traditional Christian beliefs.
Twenty-six of the 30 scholars
voting after the discussion on the
Second Coming said they strongly
disagreed that Jesus expected to
return and usher in a new age.
The scholars almost unanimously

agreed, though, that Jesus spoke
the words attributed to him in
which he said the kingdom of God
already was present in his day.
The group also voted over
whelmingly that the language
used to describe the future
kingdom of God in the New Testa
ment is mythic and symbolic, and
recommended that people should
not believe in or look forward to
the Second Coming and new age.
Although there was no vote
taken on the issue of whether
Jesus intended to start a new re
ligion and be its central figure,
the subject is key to the seminar's
debates and has come up in vir
tually all of its nine meetings over
the past four years.
"The overwhelming answer
(among the seminar's scholars) is
Jesus had no intention of starting
a new religion," said Funk. "Most
of the fellows think Jesus led
some kind of reform movement
in Judaism."
