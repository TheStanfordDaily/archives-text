Mayor splits Jackson, Democrats
CHICAGO (AP) — Jesse Jackson fasted for
three days because he hungers for the defeat of
Democratic mayoral nominee Richard M. Daley,
but some Democrats say Jackson's efforts are
straining the two-time Democratic presidential
contender's party credentials.
"What kind of credibility does that give Jackson
nationwide with other Democrats?" asks Illinois
party Chairman Vince Demuzio. "This is certainly
not going to bode well for Jackson nationally if
he has any future ambitions, which I'm sure he
does."
Jackson backed Mayor Eugene Sawyer in the
Democratic primary won last week by Daley, but
that was because his candidate of choice — Demo
cratic Alderman Timothy Evans — sat out the
primary in favor of a third-party bid in the April
4 general election.
Jackson has tried to be a peacemaker, but his
plea for unity among supporters of Sawyer and
Evans during the primary went unheeded. Now
his position is at odds with the man Jackson
successfully backed to head the Democratic Na
tional Committee.

Ron Brown, the first black to hold the top
post, has announced his support of Daley, said
Mike McCurry, spokesman for the DNC in Wash
ington.
U.K. asks Soviets to back Rushdie
VIENNA, Austria (AP) — Britain wants the
Soviet Union to take a stronger position against
Iran for Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's calls for
the death of novelist Salman Rushdie, the British
foreign secretary said yesterday.
Sir Geoffrey Howe said he and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze discussed the
matter during private talks yesterday in Vienna,
where both are attending East-West talks on
reducing conventional forces in Europe.
"I left Mr. Shevardnadze no doubt of our view
that the principles involved in that problem are
of universal application," Howe told a news con
ference.
Howe said he told Shevardnadze "there can be
no justification for (Iran's) incitement to murder
and no justification for seeking to impair the
freedom of speech in a country like ours."
