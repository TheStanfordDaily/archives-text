Moving out of dorms
is a mission impossible
after last-minute exams

Moving out is hell. Not
quite the words of Billy
Joel, but that's the senti
ment most students feel when the
last day of spring quarter arrives.
Here's a typical schedule for
that last day of finals, and the
12 meager hours remaining for
students to clear out of housing:
Wed., June 14-Thurs., June 15
9 a.m.-12 p.m.: America Since
1945 final
12-1: Eat lunch over a physics
book
1-3: Alternate between packing
suitcases and electromagnetism
formulas into your head
3-4: Wait in line far UPS
truck at Wilbur H
ing for your physics final, only
to be told that the truck must
leave at 4 p.m. for Sterling Quad
4-5: Wait in line for the UPS
truck at Sterling Quad, only to
learn that they must close the
truck at 5 p.m. and you should
come back the next day
5:01: Realize that storage hours
for Mirrielees House ended at
5:00 and that it is not open the
next day
5:02-6: Almost skip dinner, but
remember Mom's advice that you
should be fully nourished before
taking your physics final
6-7: Drive roommate to the air
port
7-10: Physics final
10-4 a.m.: Frantically try to pack,
realizing that you are three boxes
short and have just failed physics
4-10: Sleep, right through alarm
clock
10-12 p.m.: Put on sweats for the

plane ride home, get your suit
cases ready and leave before the
Armed and Dangerous Get-Out
of-the-Rooms-Before-Noon
Death Squads arrive. Oh yeah,
say goodbye to friends, too.
Seems like a tight schedule?
Well, it's too tight for those
students who follow it, and offi
cials in the Housing Office are
starting to agree â€” but not quite
enough.
Students must vacate their
rooms by noon Thursday because
parents stay in the residences for
Commencement weekend, sum
mer quarter students sometimes
move in as early as Monday and
maintenance workers need to give
rooms a final sweep. That's the
standard argument.
Sure, it's great that the Uni
versity is so concerned about tidy
rooms for parents and summer
students, but at the expense of
student ganity? Students deserve
some breathing time, an extra 24
hours to move out would do it.
The Housing Office is starting
to take some steps in the right
direction. Housing Director
Rodger Whitney said those stud
nets with late-night Wednesday
exams will be given until 4 p.m.
to move out. Wow.
How about students with finals
on Wednesday from 3:30 to 6:30?
Shouldn't they receive an exten
sion as well? Shouldn't every
body?
At the very least, the Univer
sity should look into extending
office and storage hours, so stu
dents who have to study in lieu
of packing can more easily
facilitate their final-day move.
Better yet, the Housing Office
should avoid the last-minute
mayhem altogether and grant
students an extra 24 hours to
pack up after that final final.
