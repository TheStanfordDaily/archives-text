# Frosh in Congress
## Campbell confident after two months 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
According to Tom Campbell,
being a freshman in Congress
is a lot like being a freshman
at Stanford.
Like most freshmen just ar
riving on the Farm, first-time
congressmen tend to be some
what unsure of themselves and
think "other folks know the
system and (they) don't,"
Campbell said in a recent in
terview with The Daily.
But much like a Stanford
freshman who has learned that
the average upperclassman
"doesn't know [the systeml any
better than (he) does," Camp
bell said he feels settled in and
on top of things in his job as
the representative from Cali
fornia's 12th District.
After two months in Wash
ington, D.C., the Stanford law
school professor turned Repub
lican congressman is already
carrying a heavy work load.
Campbell recently co-authored

both a gun control bill and a
joint ventures bill, and his
travel schedule is filling his
spare time.
Speaking to The Daily at his
district office in Sunnyvale,
Campbell said he feels commit
ted to returning to the West
Coast almost every weekend to
receive imput from his constit
uents. He has scheduled 75
town meetings during the
calendar year.
Campbell said he is confident
he can maintain such an in
dustrious pace.
"There are times when it's
tiresome to get on the plane,
but it's essential," he said. "It
is not difficult to get a sense
of what the constituents want
if you're willing to listen."
Too many tenured congress
men aren't as willing to listen,
Campbell said.
Due to the high incumbency
rate of congressmen, "There is
a temptation to coast," he ex-

After two months on the job, Stanford law professor turned
congressman Tom Campbell has co-authored two bills in Wash
ington, D.C., and scheduled 75 town meetings back home.
plained. "I've seen that in several of the
more senior members of the Congress."
According to Campbell, a large reason
for the "over 98 percent retention rate"
of congressmen is the "gerrymandered
districts" which have been drawn to en
sure a large percentage of voters are of
a single partisanship.
Voters should urge the passage of
neutral re-districting proposals which
would ignore partisanship, Campbell
said.
The pervasive role partisanship plays
in Congress has been the biggest surprise
of his new job, Campbell said. "The Dem
ocrats are in control and that has been
more of a factor than I had thought," he
said. "I am truly not that partisan of a
person, and I'm used to dealing with
people regardless of their party."
Both the bills Campbell has introduced
this term are co-authored with a Demo
crat. Bi-partisan co-authorship "is con
sistent with my view," Campbell said.
In addition, "things are so partisan in
Washington I discovered that if you don't
co-author with a Democrat, your chances
of getting heard are substantially less,"
he said.
Prior to beginning his term, Campbell
and his fellow freshmen attended a one
and one-half week "How to be a Con
gressman" school, he said, where par

tisanship was emphasized to a "regret
table" extent.
After two days of meeting as a group,
the freshman congressmen broke into Re
publican and Democratic camps.
"The Republicans were kind of taught,
'Here's what the Democrats will do to
try to get you and here's what we've got
to do to get them before they get us.' I
imagine the Democrats were taught the
same," Campbell said.

'Meeting people at train
stations, going to
luncheons every day,
going to people's homes
for coffee — all of that was
tremendous.'

"You were taught from the very start
how to be a Republican congressman or
how to be a Democratic congressman. I
wish they had spent the whole week to
gether and built a bridge."
Campbell said he was also disappointed
by the emphasis the schooling placed on
tactics to get re-elected. "We were told
that many people vote not knowing who
the candidates are," he said. "They vote
for the name they recognize."
The congressmen were therefore told
to take advantage of their franking
privileges, Campbell said. By law, mem

bers of the House are allowed six mailings
per year to their constituents. These
mailings tend to be "very self
aggrandizing," Campbell said, adding
that he would like to see a ban on such
self-promotion.
Campbell said he has no plans of turn
ing his position in the House into a life
time vocation. "I'm looking at about five
terms," he said. "Don't hold me to that
precisely."
But five terms, Campbell said, would
be "long enough to have seniority but
not long enough to forget who I repre
sent."
"I have always said it is important to
know when to get out just as it was
important to know when to get in,"he
said.
Campbell said it was the wanting lead
ership of his predecessor Ernie Konnyu
that inspired him to challenge his fellow
Republican in the 12th District primary.
Although Campbell held positions in both
the Carter and Reagan administrations,
he had never run for public office.
"I was convinced that the incumbent
who I beat in the primary was not a
good representative of this district, and
I was particularly offended at his state
ments and actions in Congress," Camp
bell said. "That's why I got interested
[in running]. I was not going to let that
point of view characterize my Republican
party."
Campbell said he felt obligated to chal
lenge Konnyu.
"Too many people say, 'Something

ought to be done.' 1 thought I could try,"
Campbell said. "The rest of my life I
would regret not having tried. This was
a situation that called for action ... I
thought I could do something in the areas
I care most about."
Ironically, Campbell said, had he
known about the overwhelming odds con
gressional challengers face, he might not
have run.
"What's fascinating is I didn't know
the odds were so long," Campbell said.
"Only one incumbent lost in a [congres
sional! primary in the entire country.
That was my opponent. Had I known the
odds maybe I wouldn't have charged in
the way I did. A little ignorance some
times substitutes for courage."
Campbell said he mulled over the de
cision whether to run for about a month
before entering the race.
"The longer I had thought, perhaps,
the less I would have considered my
chances to be," he said.
For the most part, Campbell said, the
campaign experience was enjoyable.
"Meeting people at train stations, going
to luncheons every day, going to people's
homes for coffee — all of that was tre
mendous," he said.
Meeting people at train stations "is
something more professors should do,"
Campbell said. "There were so many
bright people with brilliant ideas that
never would have been reported in a
scholarly journal. I discovered that there's
such a wealth of experience out there
beyond the university. It's very useful to

tap into."
The campaign season was not without
its unpleasant moments, however.
"There were aspects that were much
tougher than I thought they would be,"
Campbell said. "Both in the primary and
the general [election campaigns!, there
were aspects of my academic writing that
were misconstrued intentionally, some of
them off so badly as to be humorous."
Campbell cited a flier circulated in the
final week of the campaign by his Demo
cratic opponent Anna Eshoo as particu
larly misleading. The flier attacked
Campbell's views on gender issues.
"I think (Anna Eshoo) wanted to run
against Ernie Konnyu," Campbell said.
"In fact, I know she did. When I won
the [Republican] primary, she was stuck
with a campaign plan dealing with
feminism and suddenly she was running
against somebody who had a Ph.D. in
gender discrimination."
Campbell said he was not disheartened
by the fact that the majority of Stanford
students voted for Eshoo in the general
election.
"There was a large amount of misin
formation including the regrettable flier
my opponent put out in the last week
attacking me," Campbell explained. "The
student body is more Democratic by reg
istration and . . . neither of the two can
didates were all well-known, so there
wasn't a record to judge."
"In two years time, I expect to do very
well with the student body," Campbell
added.
