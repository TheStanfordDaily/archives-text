## Characters, not cameos 
### 
I know why the caged bird sings, ah me,
When his wing is bruised and his bosom
sore,
When he beats his bars and he would be
free
It is not a carol of joy or glee,
But a prayer that he sends from his
heart's deep core,
But a plea, that upward to Heaven he
flings —
— Paul Laurence Dunbar, "Sympathy"
IF YOU ARE WHITE, you really have
no idea how it feels to see your
struggles and experiences on the sil
ver screen. You take your screen presence
for granted. However, if you are a mi
nority, gay, female or all three, you sel
dom, if ever, see yourself depicted in a
positive, realistic light.
Sure, there have been certain movies
that make attempts to address different
cultures. After all, there was "La Bamba"
depicting the plight of Mexican-
Americans, right? Guess again. "La
Bamba" was the life story of teen idol
Ritchie Valens. It did not teach me any
thing about the struggle of Mexican-
Americans in this country.
Another example of false attempts at
portraying minorities on the screen was
the movie "Cry Freedom." Was this
movie about the murdered anti-apartheid
leader Stephen Biko as publicized? No,
it was about the struggle of white South
African journalist, Donald Woods. It is a
good thing that I did not pay to see this
movie or I would have been a lot angrier

than I was.
Why is it that whenever a movie alleges
to be about minorities, the story centers
around white characters and their rela
tions to the tragic minority figure? In
actuality, the story is not about minori
ties at all.
This is a cruel hoax on those who came
to see the movie thinking that it would
be a representation of their life experi
ences or those of another minority person
or group.
It is obvious that the movie industry
is not ready to promote films that deal
with minority issues and history. Unless
you are Eddie Murphy, it becomes very
difficult to raise enough money to create
your film. No one wants to sponsor a
"black movie" because no one who is not
black will see it, or so motion picture
people think. This reflects badly on white
society since it is an implication of its
unwillingness to accept blacks into the
film industry.
Why is it important for minorities to
see movies about themselves? Well, it is
very beneficial for me to see that someone
else understands my frustrations and
anxieties as a black, American woman.
What better validation can there be than
through the use of the silver screen?
It is distressing to see that blacks are
still not allowed to define themselves in
the movie industry. The movies that are
dealing with black characters are written,
produced and directed by white people,
for the most part. It is only people like
Spike Lee, Robert Townsend and Kennan
Wynans who offer us much needed in

sight into black culture and the struggle
of black people in America.
When I watch one of their movies not
only am I a spectator but also a partic
ipant.
These multi-faceted black men,
through their movies, address the prob
lem and concerns of the black community
while also giving us a tremendous sense
of ourselves.
I would strongly encourage everyone
to watch a film that is different from the
mainstream, a film that deals with the
issues of specific minority groups that
you may be otherwise unfamiliar with.
It may help you to better understand
yourself by seeing how others perceive
you and the basis of their perceptions.
The '80s, specifically the past five to
six years, have produced four black
movie directors — Eddie Murphy, Robert
Townsend, Spike Lee and Keenan
Wynans, all of whom write, produce,
direct and star in their own films). If
the trend continues, we should see more
minorities in the upper strata of the film
industry, integrating a business that has
traditionally excluded them.
