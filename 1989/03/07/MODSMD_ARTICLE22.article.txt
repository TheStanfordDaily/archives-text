## Proposed computer voting will save money and time 
### 
AS MEMBERS of the ASSU, we
support the use of computers in
the Spring 1989 General Elec
tions. By taking the technological leap
and using the Macintosh computers on
our campus to their potential, Stanford
University will be the first campus in
the nation to computerize its student
body elections.
Visibility of the sites is a problem
that has been solved. The original poll
sites (Tresidder Union-LOTS 11, Meyer
Library, the Graduate School of Busi
ness, Terman Computer Cluster and
the Medical Center) are located at
areas of student activity, and four sites
have been added in the new proposal.
These sites are at the Clock Tower,

Green Library, the Law School and the
Post Office.
Also the graduate students have been
given special attention in the effort to
get them to vote. In the Senate Bill
passed Feb. 16, 1989, "To Appropriate
Funds to Notify Graduate Students of
the Spring 1989 Election," a publicity
mailing will inform the graduate stu
dents about the election.
Also six poll sites are located at
places of graduate student activity.
Another problem stated is that the
use of computers will further compl
icate the procedure and discourage
students from voting. The act of voting
is never completely convenient for the
voter.

During all elections of local, state
and federal government, we must leave
our residences and go to a poll site.
Furthermore, we must wait in line
and concentrate as we carefully punch
our votes. Computerization would help
alleviate these problems by making the
process faster and allowing voters to
correct mistakes.
Reliability is another concern of the
senators who voted down the original
proposal. In the revised proposal, a
hard copy of every vote will be avail
able for tabulation by hand.
Printers have been obtained for poll
sites to print out the voters' ballot
results.

The possibility of a crash should be
small if the program is well-tested, and
no system, including the Scantron and
the present ballot booths, is infallible.
The speed in tabulating the results
and preparing accurate voter lists for
ASSU Fee Refunds is an invaluable
benefit of permitting the Macintosh to
do more than word processing and
spreadsheets.
Once the horse and buggy was the
main mode of transportation and the
automobile was declared a passing
trend. Let us not reject progress but
promote it.
