# It's not very wise for fraternity men to urinate off roofs
## 
### 
I would like to take this opportunity
to commend the Sigma Alpha Gpsilon
Fraternity members for preserving and
propagating the "Drinking Club of
Sexist Men" image that most of the
other fraternities on this campus are
trying to dispel.
This past Saturday members of the
SAE House — in glorius celebration of
their manhood — stood drunkenly atop
their house roof shouting rude and
sexually insulting comments to every
passer-by. Occasionally members could
be spotted publicly exposing themselves
and fashioning beautiful urine arches
in the afternoon air. All this from
"mature" members of this respected
institution of higher learning.
Some Freudian disciples may accuse
me of simply expressing penis envy, yet

I will argue to the end that the ridic
ulous conduct and male-bonding rituals
exhibited by these "men" were not
only disgusting but also highly un
called for.
Until fraternities such as the SAEs
can find and apply mechanisms with
which they can control the publicly
offensive behavior of some of their
members I cannot hold any sympathy
for their plight to maintain the frater
nity system on this campus.
