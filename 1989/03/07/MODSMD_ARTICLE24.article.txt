# Dead Week is not the time to change the Standard policy
## 
### 
Would someone mind answering a
few questions about the propsal to
reinterpret the Fundamental Standard?
Are the comments made to the Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council con

dent Conduct Legislative Council con
fidential or open to the public? How
many positive or negative comments
does it take for the SCLC to approve
or oppose the proposal?
A petition is being circulated oppos
ing the proposal. How many signatures
are needed to delay it or block it?
Will these signatures matter at all to
the SCLC? Will there be any other
way to assess student opinion?
Will any open-mike public meeting
be held on campus? Are alums being
asked for their opinions? Where is an
ASSU straw vote when you need one?
Is there any way to extend a dead
line that falls in the middle of finals
week of the year's heaviest quarter?
Perhaps we should amend the Dead
Week Policy Statement to forbid any
changes in legislation concerning stu
dents during what is supposed to be "a
period of reduced social and extracur
ricular activity preceding final ex
aminations."
If the SCLC truly values student

input, then why is this being put forth
when students are least able to concen
trate on it?
