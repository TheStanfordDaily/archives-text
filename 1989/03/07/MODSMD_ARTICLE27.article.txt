## Stricter Standard and First Amendment are not in conflict 
### 
AS A MhMBER of the Student
Conduct Legislative Council, I
have been asked a number of
questions about our proposed interpre
tation of the Fundamental Standard.
Here are some of the questions and
my answers. I should emphasize that
these are my individual opinions, not
official statements of the SCLC or any
other committee or department to
which I belong.
Aren't American citizens entitled to
say anything they want, however they
want, whenever they want, by the First
Amendment?
No, the law contains a number of
restrictions on speech that have been
upheld by the Supreme Court. At
Stanford, students' speech is limited in
various ways by the policy on distribu
tion, the policy on sexual harassment
and the Honor Code.
Could a state university have policies
like the one proposed?
A number of state universities do,
including UCLA and Michigan, as well
as private schools like USC. The SCLC
examined these in discussing what
would be appropriate for Stanford.
But don't the proposed interpretations
violate "First Amendment principles"
that state schools and governments
have to abide by?
Not in my opinion. Remember, by

"First Amendment principles" one
means the principles that the Court
has indicated have guided its thinking
in the decisions it has made, allowing
and disallowing laws that restrict
speech.
An institution must have a
legitimate, clear and important interest
that motivates a restriction; the speech
restricted should not be important to
the robustness of political debate or
the search for truth or the possibility
of artistic expression; it should be
directed at the effects of the speech
(e.g., it incites lawlessness) or the
manner (e.g. it is so loud that no one
can get anything done) rather than the

content; and it shouldn't be any more
restrictive than is necessary to protect
the institutional interest involved.
But the interpretations are not "con
tent neutral."
They are directed at the effects of a
certain manner of speech in certain
circumstances. They don't rule out
expressing the same content in a differ
ent situation, where it will not con
stitute personal abuse or defamation
that cannot be avoided.
Don't the proposed interpretations say
you can't say things that aren't ap
proved by the majority? Isn't that what
"community standards" amounts to?
No, that's a misunderstanding. The

"community standards" phrase has to
do with the form of expression, not
the view expressed. The phrase is in
there to indicate that a form of expres
sion isn't beyond the pale just because
some person or some group happens to
be offended by it.
It has to be objectionable by com
mon knowledge, the sort of expression
that anyone knows (or would know, if
sober and minimally reflective) to be
objectionable. And, of course, one can
use such forms of expression, however
disgusting and ugly, to one's heart's
content as long as one exercises care
about the sensibilities of others.
Isn't the very fact that a person
holds and expresses bigoted views
going to be upsetting, even if they don't
use epithets and other loathsome ex
pressions in expressing them? Aren't
the ideas in themselves loathsome?
Yes, but surely to simply say that
ideas can't be expressed because they
are loathsome wouldn't be to honor
freedom of speech. There is no way
that a university like Stanford can or
should try to spare its members all
discomfort and distress at the ideas
held by others.
If a person's views cause me
distress, that's basically my problem.
But if he abuses me, or inflicts his

views on me in ways that I can't
escape, expressed not in the ways
appropriate to rational consideration
about my personal characteristics,
that's not just my problem. That
conduct is intolerable.
Who decides what is "obscene" or
"pejorative" by "accepted community
standards ?
For anyone to be charged with a
Fundamental Standard violation, the
judicial officer must be sure in her
own mind that a violation has occured;
then the Stanford Judicial Council
must agree; and the President makes
the final decision in all student mis
conduct cases. If the SCLC doesn't like
the way the Judicial Council is doing
things, it can issue more Student
Conduct Legislation. If the committee
of 15 doesn't like what the Judicial
Council and SCLC are doing, it can
disband them and start over.
There are a lot of safeguards, and all
the committees mentioned have heavy
student representation.
You can submit your views directly
to SCLC Chair George Parker. We
have opened up a computer bulletin
board, su.issues.sclc, where you can
contribute your opinion and read those
of others.

views on me in ways that I can't

conduct is intolerable.

Fundamental Standard violation, the

the way the Judicial Council is doing
things, it can issue more Student
Conduct Legislation. If the committee

There are a lot of safeguards, and all

AS A MhMBER of the Student
Conduct Legislative Council, I
have been asked a number of
questions about our proposed interpre
tation of the Fundamental Standard.
Here are some of the questions and
my answers. I should emphasize that
these are my individual opinions, not
official statements of the SCLC or any
other committee or department to
which I belong.
Aren't American citizens entitled to
say anything they want, however they
want, whenever they want, by the First
Amendment?
No, the law contains a number of
restrictions on speech that have been
upheld by the Supreme Court. At
Stanford, students' speech is limited in
various ways by the policy on distribu
tion, the policy on sexual harassment
and the Honor Code.
Could a state university have policies
like the one proposed?
A number of state universities do,
including UCLA and Michigan, as well
as private schools like USC. The SCLC
examined these in discussing what
would be appropriate for Stanford.
But don't the proposed interpretations
violate "First Amendment principles"
that state schools and governments
have to abide by?
Not in my opinion. Remember, by

"First Amendment principles" one
means the principles that the Court
has indicated have guided its thinking
in the decisions it has made, allowing
and disallowing laws that restrict
speech.
An institution must have a
legitimate, clear and important interest
that motivates a restriction; the speech
restricted should not be important to
the robustness of political debate or
the search for truth or the possibility
of artistic expression; it should be
directed at the effects of the speech
(e.g., it incites lawlessness) or the
manner (e.g. it is so loud that no one
can get anything done) rather than the

content; and it shouldn't be any more
restrictive than is necessary to protect
the institutional interest involved.
But the interpretations are not "con
tent neutral."
They are directed at the effects of a
certain manner of speech in certain
circumstances. They don't rule out
expressing the same content in a differ
ent situation, where it will not con
stitute personal abuse or defamation
that cannot be avoided.
Don't the proposed interpretations say
you can't say things that aren't ap
proved by the majority? Isn't that what
"community standards" amounts to?
No, that's a misunderstanding. The

"community standards" phrase has to
do with the form of expression, not
the view expressed. The phrase is in
there to indicate that a form of expres
sion isn't beyond the pale just because
some person or some group happens to
be offended by it.
It has to be objectionable by com
mon knowledge, the sort of expression
that anyone knows (or would know, if
sober and minimally reflective) to be
objectionable. And, of course, one can
use such forms of expression, however
disgusting and ugly, to one's heart's
content as long as one exercises care
about the sensibilities of others.
Isn't the very fact that a person
holds and expresses bigoted views
going to be upsetting, even if they don't
use epithets and other loathsome ex
pressions in expressing them? Aren't
the ideas in themselves loathsome?
Yes, but surely to simply say that
ideas can't be expressed because they
are loathsome wouldn't be to honor
freedom of speech. There is no way
that a university like Stanford can or
should try to spare its members all
discomfort and distress at the ideas
held by others.
If a person's views cause me
distress, that's basically my problem.
But if he abuses me, or inflicts his

views on me in ways that I can't
escape, expressed not in the ways
appropriate to rational consideration
about my personal characteristics,
that's not just my problem. That
conduct is intolerable.

"pejorative" by "accepted community
