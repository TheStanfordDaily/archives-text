Metaphysics of Liberation"

The pace of the women's libera
tion movement has gradually
slowed, and now is the time for
review. This has been effectively
accomplished by Sonia Johnson
in her book "Going Out of Our
Minds: The Metaphysics of Lib
eration."
In the wake of the unsuccessful
attempt to obtain ERA ratifica
tion and in the midst of a patriar
chal political regime, the women's
liberation movement seems to be
floundering in the political arena.
While women struggle towards
an equal opportunity to provide
for themselves and their families,
poverty continues to become an
overwhelmingly feminine predica
ment. While women are becoming
more assertive and independent,
rape and violence have become a
popular topic of pornographic
magazines. While more women
are now employed in entry level
jobs, there are still very few
women in decision-making posi
tions in any industry, despite the
fact that competent women are
available for these positions.
Why do some aspects of wom
en's liberation forge ahead while
others seem to regress? What is
it about the women's liberation
movement that causes these dic
hotomies?
With unparalleled enthusiasm
and optimism, Sonia Johnson pro
vides a fresh perspective on these
issues. Johnson is well-qualified
for this task: She has been a
leader in civil disobedience since
her excommunication from the
Mormon Church in 1979; she ran
for president in 1984; and she has
led countless workshops and gath
erings attended by women to dis
cuss basic feminist issues.
Step by step, Johnson describes
both the many forms her par
ticipation in the women's move
ment has taken and the corre
sponding phase of the women's
movement itself. She develops a
metaphysical definition of the
process of liberation and its spe
cific application for women, with

which she suggests a future ori
entation for the women's move
ment.

Why do some aspects
of women's liberation
forge ahead while
others seem to
regress? What is it
about the women's
liberation movement
that causes these dic
hotomies?

Johnson writes "Going Out of
Our Minds" in a concrete, per
sonal and often emotive style. She
specifically addresses her choice
of style in the preface of the book,
saying that its personal orienta
tion exemplifies her idea of liber

ation.
"I recognize now," Johnson
writes, . . the revolutionary
power of each woman's telling her
own story, taking herself seriously
enough, trusting her own experi
ence enough, to detail for the rest
of us the consequences of the
many large and small moments of
connection in her life."
Throughout Johnson's partici
pation in the women's movement,
she has consistently emphasized
the need for women to assert their
own identities and resist the
patriarchal structures and ideol
ogy instilled in them since birth.
Women, she says, have interna
lized these patriarchal structures;
they practice the same methods
of power and control as their op
pressors. For instance, the
hierarchical structure of the
women's organizations mirror the
problems of power and inequity
they were designed to remedy.
By trying to work within the

system and set up a structure ihat
the system would recognize,
Johnson argues, the women's
movement has granted even more
power to the patriarchal society

Women practice the
same methods of
power and control as
their oppressors.

by requiring its permission for lib
eration.
Johnson's fervent belief that
women's liberation lies in reject
ing status-quo institutions has
alienated her from the main
stream women's movement, rep
resented by the National
Organization for Women and,
through NOW's affiliation, the
Democratic Party.
In an effort to prove the validity
of her more radical position,
Johnson instigated a series of civil
disobedience actions designed to
highlight the oppression of women
and their intense desire and need
for liberation. These activities in
cluded a 36 day fast in Illinois to
promote the ratification of the
ERA and numerous demonstra
tions in Washington, D.C.
Yet after years of these activi
ties, Johnson rejected civil dis
obedience too, holding that it was
also just another — albeit more
forceful — way to seek permission
from the patriarchal powers. Civil
disobedience, she said, inadver
tently provides the reigning
powers with even more power —
power derived from the oppressed.
Johnson's message in "Going
Out of Our Minds" is an emphatic
one. Women, she writes, must get
beyond either asking or demand
ing permission to participate.
Women must take themselves
seriously; they must change their
own lives and start living the lives
they desire.
Most importantly, women must
unfetter their minds — free them
selves from the internalization of
a patriarchal way of action.
Women must respect themselves
and other women in ways that
are not part of the patriarchal

agenda.
Johnson writes: "The time for
women-wrought miracles has fi
nally come, the time for which
women have waited and worked
for over 5000 years. How lucky
we are to be alive now in history's
most fecund hour, to be who we
are, to be unafraid and, especially,
to be together. . .
"Women have given the world
a new power symbol: no longer
the upraised fist, because we
know that force is the antithesis
of strength; instead, hands hold
ing hands holding hands holding
hands. . . Hand in hand now let
us leap. . . out of our limited,
lightless, dying patriarchal minds,

and reach for our lives — for all
life — deep into the cosmos that
is our own souls."
"Going Out of Our Minds" pro
vides a thoughtful analysis of the
women's movement and why
headway has seemed so elusive at
times. Reading it is varyingly fun,
frustrating, maddening, uplifting
and touching — but in the end
the reader is left optimistic and
ready once again to grapple with
the struggles of liberation. This
book is a must for any woman
interested in the pursuit of her
own identity.
