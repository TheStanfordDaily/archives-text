The following remarks are excerpted from an Informal interview
Kathryn Gorges, a member of the Women's Center, held with
Sonia Johnson following Johnson's lecture at Kresge Auditorium
last week.
Given your discussion regarding civil disobedience in your book
and in tonight's lecture, do you see any useful applications of
civil actions in the women's movement?
No.
What about as a rallying device — as a means of raising
consciousness?
Well, that's probably the only reason for civil disobedience but
even that can be misleading. Women will have the feeling that
they really are initiating change. And then it becomes dangerous
because it (civil disobedience) becomes a focal point.
You mentioned that you have written a new book that will be
coming out in the fall. What is the main focus of the book?
The first part of the book talks about the basic ideas behind
the discussion in the other book ("Going Out of Our Minds") —
I hadn't gotten everything quite straightened out when I finished
it. This book is sort of a continuation of the last chapter of that.
For example, I discuss justice; what is it really?
The last part of the book focuses on women living in commu
nities, creating their lives as free women. You know, no one can
tell us now what the life of a really free woman is like, but we
will be able to once we start living it.
