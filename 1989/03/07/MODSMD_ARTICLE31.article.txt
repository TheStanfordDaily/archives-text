## Sheppard: Women can balance career and family 
### Minha Husaini 
Although increasing numbers of
women are entering the engineer
ing field, statistics still show an
alarming lack of women teaching
engineering at the University
level.
There are currently 20,000 en
gineering faculty in the United
States, only 420 of whom are
women. At Stanford, a mere six
of the 220 engineering faculty are
women.
Sheri Sheppard, Associate Pro
fessor of Mechanical Engineering,
is one of those few women.
According to Sheppard, when
she was in college, only one or
two percent of engineers were
women. "I was the only girl in
my class. I never got asked out
because I was considered one of
the guys â€” I was part of the
competition."
Sheppard says she feels women
are not encouraged to move up in
the engineering field.
At Stanford, only 20 percent of
engineering undergraduates are
women, and at the graduate level,
that number decreases to 10 per
cent.
Sheppard says she feels that
one of the main reasons she sur

vived her graduate school years
was her thirst for intellectual
challenge. "Engineering is some
what empowering in that you
understand the world around you
a bit better," she says.
"It is okay for both girls and
boys to play with dolls, but those
dolls need houses to live in, and
it's okay to build that house. I
think it is very important for both
sexes," she says. Yet, Sheppard

adds that she does not advocate
giving up all of the "soft, feminine
things."
Many women feel that they can
not enter the field because they
question how one can have a fam
ily and pursue a career in engi
neering at the same time,
Sheppard says."In general, a lot
of the issues relating to children
still fall on women," she adds.
However, people "need to be
flexible. They need to learn that
things may have to be com
promised, and everything may not
be 100 percent all the time," she
says.
While working toward her un

dergraduate degree at the Univer
sity of Wisconsin, Sheppard met
her husband, Ed, who was finish
ing up his masters in engineering.
The two met via a computer
dating service.
"We were both top on each
other's list and hit it off right
away. It was meant to be," she
says.
However, one week later she
received a phone call. Apparently,
there was a bug in the computer,
and all the students were given a
second copy of their "most com
patible mates" lists, she explains.
"Ed and I weren't even on each
other's second lists," she says.
There is no competition be
tween the two, she says, adding
that her husband is "one of the
most open-minded men I know."
Nevertheless, Sheppard says
there has been a lot more stress
in their lives since the birth of
their daughter, Portia, last year.
Both find it difficult to balance
their jobs, classes and a family,
she says.
"One of the beauties of an ac
ademic career is that you can
work when you want but one of
the disadvantages is you can work
all the time," Sheppard says.


Assoc. Prof, of Mechanical Engineering Sheri Sheppard is a testimony to her belief that women can
balance a career in engineering and a family at the same time.
