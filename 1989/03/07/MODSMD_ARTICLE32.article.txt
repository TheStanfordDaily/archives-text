## Volleyball breaks 7th-ranked Waves 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
Well, it wasn't pretty, but Stan
ford chalked up yet another vic
tory.
In a match that was riddled
with service errors and was
plagued with generally sloppy
play, the Stanford men's volleyball
team outlasted the visiting Pep
perdine Waves for a three-games
to-one victory. Riding the steady
handed play of hitter Dan Hanan,
Stanford ran its Western Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association
record to 10-1.

Men's Volleyball
Cardinal 3, Waves 1

Pepperdine fell behind early in
the match. The Waves squandered
a 13-11 lead in game one, losing
15-13, and Stanford walked in
game two, winning 15-7.
Leading two games to none, the
Cardinal seemed to have every
intention of drifting through game
three for a sweep of the Waves.
In fact, the Cardinal players
seemed to have their minds on
the team's traditional post-match
social gathering in the Hospitality
Room in one of Maples Pavilion's
cozy corridors.
However, the tough Pepperdine
players did something that very
few squads have been able to do
against the Cardinal: they mus
tered a comeback. Pepperdine
took game three in very convinc
ing fashion, winning by a 15-7
count. However, in game four,
momentum swung back to the

Cardinal side of the net.
Doug Walquist, inserted into
the match for Craig Forsyth late
in game three, put down several
quick sets at the outset of game
four, providing the Cardinal with
a lead it would never relinquish.
Walquist, a part-time starter
earlier in the season, commented
on his play as a reserve. "When
I come in for Craig, I know I've
got to contribute immediately. So,
there is a little extra weight on
my shoulders, but I just try to
come in and do my job."
While non-starters like
Walquist were doing their jobs
coming off the bench, there was
one quiet figure who, as he has
done all year, played exceptionally
for the entire match. Dan Hanan,
a member of last year's All-
America team and a hands down
favorite to repeat that feat this
season, tallied 30 kills for the
match. In so doing, Hanan com
piled a hitting percentage that is
beginning to seem routine for him
(.500 for the match).
On a night when teammate
Scott Fortune was flailing a bit,
Hanan seemed to have a steadying
effect on his squad. Hanan com
mented on his role in the match:
"Because Fortune wasn't 100%
sharp tonight, I think I got a little
more than my share of the sets
from Parker (Blackman). I don't
think I played any differently; no
matter what the situation, I'm
always prepared to hit."
Coach Fred Sturm also ac
knowledged Hanan's all
important presence, claiming, "No
matter what the stakes, he always
plays at the same consistent
level."


Sophomore outside hitter Mike Lowe started last night's match
against Pepperdine and smashed several kills.
