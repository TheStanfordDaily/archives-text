# Fencers Bravin, Cramer advance to NCAA tourney
## 
### Doug Boeschen Staff writer 
When, in the course of last
weekend's Western Regional Fenc
ing Championships, Stanford foil
captain Duncan Bell analogized
the Cardinal fencing team's effort
as a certain kicking motion, he
couldn't have appreciated the
prophetic nature of his exclama
tion.
Bell prognosticated the excel
lent performance of Stanford's
men's fencing team in the cham
pionships as they went on to take
the team title and establish them
selves as the premier fencing
power on the West Coast and one
of the top eight teams in the na
tion.
In team play the Cardinal
defeated all five opponents in
head-to-head competition. They
downed Air Force 16-11, Long
Beach State 17-10, UC-Santa Cruz
16-11, San Diego 21-6, and Fuller
ton State 24-3. Coach Zoran
Tulum was very pleased with the
team results as expected chal
lenges from Air Force, Santa Cruz,
and Long Beach State never
materialized.
Stanford's foil team was nearly
unstoppable as they rolled to a
40-11 record and the first-place
trophy. They were led by fresh
man Nick Bravin's sterling 17-0
performance that earned him the
individual title and an invitation
to the NCAA Championships at
Northwestern University. Bravin
virtually owned the strips as he
allowed only four touches against
him for the entire tournament.
Duncan Bell also had an excel
lent day with a 13-4 record and
winning third place overall. The
third member of the squad, Stan
Brobston, finished seventh overall
with a 10-7 record.

1 am happy to send
Bravin and Cramer to
the NCAA tournament
to represent us. I
think they will have
some good results
there.'
â€” Zoran Tulum

Perhaps the biggest surprise of
the day was the outstanding
third-place finish by the epee
team. Considered the "weak link"
in Stanford's chain of dominating
squads, the epee team held their
own against powerful opponents
and helped assure the Cardinal
the team title.
"The epee team was really
eating people up," team manager
Jim Farrell said.
Lee Tankersley finished
seventh overall, Peter Duimstra
was ninth, and Steve Schmidt
finished eleventh. "All of our
bouts were close and hard
fought," said Tankersley.
The only disappointment of the
day was the second-place finish
by the powerful sabre squad.
Tulum explained that the sabre
team had a difficult first match
against Long Beach State which
cost them the title. "They weren't
ready and there was much pres
sure," said Tulum.
A commanding individual per
formance was turned in by cap
tain Mike Cramer as he dueled
his way to a 14-3 record and the
second-place overall trophy. This
position also earns him a trip to
Northwestern for the NCAA tour
nament.
