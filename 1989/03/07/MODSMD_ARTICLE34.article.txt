# The 						best and worst of the Pac-10 1988-89 hoops season
## 
### 
I don't ride in a Greyhound bus and
I don't weigh 350 pounds, but like John
Madden, I've seen a lot of games this
year. I don't have the nerve to call these
my All-Weisman teams, but here are some
picks and notes on the end of the Pacific
10 Conference men's basketball regular
season.
All-confercnce
G — Todd Lichti, Stanford
G — Gary Payton, Oregon State
C — Anthony Cook, Arizona
F — Sean Elliott, Arizona
F — Howard Wright, Stanford
USC Coach George Raveling said that
Payton, Lichti and Elliott are the best
in the country at their respective posi
tions, and certainly no one is significantly
better. They do it all — shoot, drive, pass,
defend.
Cook wins out over California's
Leonard Taylor because of his increased
scoring output and as the Pac-10's all
time shot blocker. Wright's 38-for-55
shooting (69 percent) over the last six
games lifts him in a narrow race with
UCLA's Trevor Wilson, Arizona State's
Trent Edwards and Washington State's
Brian Quinnett.
As for Player of the Year, one could
argue that four teams wouldn't be near

where they are without Lichti, Payton,
Elliott and Taylor — all four are MVPs.
Going with the player with the best stats
is no easy trick either, but Elliott wins
by a nose. He's third in the Pac-10 in
scoring (21.0), and in the top 10 in
rebounding (6.4) and assists (4.4).
All-opponent (Cardinal killers)
G — Eldridge Recasner, Washington
G — Ken Lofton, Arizona
C — Leonard Taylor, California
F — Sean Elliott, Arizona
F — Don Mac Lean, UCLA
Recasner, as he is wont to do, lit up
the Cardinal for 23 points both times the
Huskies played Stanford this year. Lofton
didn't score much, but had nine steals
in his two games to spearhead Arizona's

pressure defense.
Taylor had a career-high 33 points,
shooting anywhere inside the halfcourt
line, at Maples Feb. 16 and had 21 points
and 12 rebounds to lead California over
Stanford 75-64 Jan. 19. Elliott's 35 at
Maples in January was the best individ
ual performance against the Cardinal this
year, and Mac Lean, like Recasner, had
46 points in two games.
All-rookie
G — Darrick Martin, UCLA
G — Matt Othick, Arizona
C — Adam Keefe, Stanford
F — Don Mac Lean, UCLA
F — Dion Brown, Washington
This was not easy — to fill out a team.
Martin has shown it all — poise, enthu
siasm and talent. Keefe already has NBA
scouts taking note with his smooth post
up moves and average of one rebound
every 3.5 minutes of play. Mac Lean is
UCLA's all-time freshman scorer and re
bounder.
After that, pickings are slim. Brown,
a transfer from Chaminade in Hawaii,
makes it for his outlandish leaping ability,
and Othick has been a solid backup. Ar
izona's Sean Rooks, Oregon's Eric Dunn
or Oregon State transfer Lamont Mcin
tosh could easily be listed instead of

Brown and Othick.
Top Stanford moments in Pac-10 play
(Of course, the best still may be to
come.)
5) California at Stanford, Feb. 16, 1989,
10:44 remaining.
Scott Meinert alley-oops on the fast
break to Wright, encapsulating the Car
dinal's free-wheeling avenging of the ear
lier loss to the Bears. Wright's slam gave
Stanford an 20-point lead en route to a
97-71 win.
4) USC at Stanford, March 2, 1989,
pregame.
Meinert, Wright, Terry Taylor, Lichti,
Eric Reveno and Bryan McSweeney are
honored in pregame ceremonies before
they play their final home games at
Maples. One can only imagine how much
louder it was that night than at their
first games in the Stanford whites.
3) Stanford at Washington, Jan. 12,
1989, 0:00 remaining.
It was really at 0:02, but time had
definitely run out on the Huskies after
Lichti rebounded an Andrew Vlahov miss
and put in a short bank shot to give
Stanford a 71-69 victory With Stanford's
ability to win on the road in question,
pulling out a close one (and rallying from

a 14-point deficit) was a big boost.
2) Arizona at Stanford, Jan. 5, 1989,
7:27 remaining.
Lichti again, this time fast-breaking on
his own past three Arizona defenders to
lay it in while being fouled by Arizona's
Matt Muehlebach. It brought the crowd
to its feet and completed Stanford's come
back from a 21-4 deficit — the Cardinal
never trailed again.
1) Arizona at Stanford, 0:04 remaining.
However, Lichti's drive would probably
have been forgotten if Bryan
McSweeney's free throw, with Stanford
leading 80-78, had missed. It thought
about it, whirling and banging around
the rim for what was actually four times
but more like an eternity, before falling
through. McSweeney was to add two more
free throws, also with 0:04 left, but this
was the biggest moment in Stanford's
biggest win so far.
Bottom moments in Pac-10 play
5) (JSC at Stanford, 0:18 remaining.
USC Coach George Raveling calls his
second timeout in the final minute with
Stanford up by 12. It was his right, for
certainly his team could have made up
a 12-point deficit in 18 seconds, but all


JON WEISMAN
it really succeeded in doing was
sapping the energy from Stan
ford's celebration of a perfect
home season and the farewell to
the seniors.
4) Stanford at Arizona, Jan. 29,
1989, 19:59 remaining in the first
half.
Sean Elliott controls the
opening tip. It never got any bet
ter.
3) Stanford at California, Jan. 16,
1989, 3:53 remaining.
Wright, hampered by a sprained
thumb, misses both free throws
with Stanford trailing California
57-51. With this chance to take
the Bears' momentum away gone,
California continues a stifling 14-

0 run and goes on to win, 75-64.
2) Stanford at UCLA, Dec. 23,
1988, 7:05 remaining.
Stanford had a six-point lead in
its bid for its first win at Pauley
Pavilion ever, but turnovers al
lowed UCLA to come back. When
Pooh Richardson hit a 22-foot 3-
pointer as the 45-second clock ex
pired, it was a killer blow.
1) Arizona at Stanford, 12:16
remaining in first half
Ken Lofton hits a 3-pointer to
cap a 15-0 run and give the Wild
cats a 21-4 lead. At no time this
season could a Cardinal fan have
felt lower. Which, of course, meant
there was no where to go but up.

better. They do it all — shoot, drive, pass,
defend.
Cook wins out over California's
Leonard Taylor because of his increased
scoring output and as the Pac-10's all
time shot blocker. Wright's 38-for-55
shooting (69 percent) over the last six
games lifts him in a narrow race with
UCLA's Trevor Wilson, Arizona State's
Trent Edwards and Washington State's
Brian Quinnett.
As for Player of the Year, one could
argue that four teams wouldn't be near

where they are without Lichti, Payton,
Elliott and Taylor — all four are MVPs.
Going with the player with the best stats
is no easy trick either, but Elliott wins
by a nose. He's third in the Pac-10 in
scoring (21.0), and in the top 10 in
rebounding (6.4) and assists (4.4).
All-opponent (Cardinal killers)
G — Eldridge Recasner, Washington
G — Ken Lofton, Arizona
C — Leonard Taylor, California
F — Sean Elliott, Arizona
F — Don Mac Lean, UCLA
Recasner, as he is wont to do, lit up
the Cardinal for 23 points both times the
Huskies played Stanford this year. Lofton
didn't score much, but had nine steals
in his two games to spearhead Arizona's

pressure defense.
Taylor had a career-high 33 points,
shooting anywhere inside the halfcourt
line, at Maples Feb. 16 and had 21 points
and 12 rebounds to lead California over
Stanford 75-64 Jan. 19. Elliott's 35 at
Maples in January was the best individ
ual performance against the Cardinal this
year, and Mac Lean, like Recasner, had
46 points in two games.
All-rookie
G — Darrick Martin, UCLA
G — Matt Othick, Arizona
C — Adam Keefe, Stanford
F — Don Mac Lean, UCLA
F — Dion Brown, Washington
This was not easy — to fill out a team.
Martin has shown it all — poise, enthu
siasm and talent. Keefe already has NBA
scouts taking note with his smooth post
up moves and average of one rebound
every 3.5 minutes of play. Mac Lean is
UCLA's all-time freshman scorer and re
bounder.
After that, pickings are slim. Brown,
a transfer from Chaminade in Hawaii,
makes it for his outlandish leaping ability,
and Othick has been a solid backup. Ar
izona's Sean Rooks, Oregon's Eric Dunn
or Oregon State transfer Lamont Mcin
tosh could easily be listed instead of

Brown and Othick.
Top Stanford moments in Pac-10 play
(Of course, the best still may be to
come.)
5) California at Stanford, Feb. 16, 1989,
10:44 remaining.
Scott Meinert alley-oops on the fast
break to Wright, encapsulating the Car
dinal's free-wheeling avenging of the ear
lier loss to the Bears. Wright's slam gave
Stanford an 20-point lead en route to a
97-71 win.
4) USC at Stanford, March 2, 1989,
pregame.
Meinert, Wright, Terry Taylor, Lichti,
Eric Reveno and Bryan McSweeney are
honored in pregame ceremonies before
they play their final home games at
Maples. One can only imagine how much
louder it was that night than at their
first games in the Stanford whites.
3) Stanford at Washington, Jan. 12,
1989, 0:00 remaining.
It was really at 0:02, but time had
definitely run out on the Huskies after
Lichti rebounded an Andrew Vlahov miss
and put in a short bank shot to give
Stanford a 71-69 victory With Stanford's
ability to win on the road in question,
pulling out a close one (and rallying from

a 14-point deficit) was a big boost.
2) Arizona at Stanford, Jan. 5, 1989,
7:27 remaining.
Lichti again, this time fast-breaking on
his own past three Arizona defenders to
lay it in while being fouled by Arizona's
Matt Muehlebach. It brought the crowd
to its feet and completed Stanford's come
back from a 21-4 deficit — the Cardinal
never trailed again.
1) Arizona at Stanford, 0:04 remaining.
However, Lichti's drive would probably
have been forgotten if Bryan
McSweeney's free throw, with Stanford
leading 80-78, had missed. It thought
about it, whirling and banging around
the rim for what was actually four times
but more like an eternity, before falling
through. McSweeney was to add two more
free throws, also with 0:04 left, but this
was the biggest moment in Stanford's
biggest win so far.

USC Coach George Raveling calls his
second timeout in the final minute with
Stanford up by 12. It was his right, for
certainly his team could have made up
a 12-point deficit in 18 seconds, but all

it really succeeded in doing was
sapping the energy from Stan
ford's celebration of a perfect
home season and the farewell to
the seniors.
4) Stanford at Arizona, Jan. 29,
1989, 19:59 remaining in the first
half.
Sean Elliott controls the
opening tip. It never got any bet
ter.
3) Stanford at California, Jan. 16,
1989, 3:53 remaining.
Wright, hampered by a sprained
thumb, misses both free throws
with Stanford trailing California
57-51. With this chance to take
the Bears' momentum away gone,
California continues a stifling 14-

0 run and goes on to win, 75-64.
2) Stanford at UCLA, Dec. 23,
1988, 7:05 remaining.
Stanford had a six-point lead in
its bid for its first win at Pauley
Pavilion ever, but turnovers al
lowed UCLA to come back. When
Pooh Richardson hit a 22-foot 3-
pointer as the 45-second clock ex
pired, it was a killer blow.
1) Arizona at Stanford, 12:16
remaining in first half
Ken Lofton hits a 3-pointer to
cap a 15-0 run and give the Wild
cats a 21-4 lead. At no time this
season could a Cardinal fan have
felt lower. Which, of course, meant
there was no where to go but up.
