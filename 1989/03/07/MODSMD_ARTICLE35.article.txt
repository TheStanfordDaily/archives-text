# Richards links golf to hoops skills

Editor's note: This is the first in a
three-part series on the Stanford wom
en's basketball team's freshman class.

To golf or not to golf — that is the
question that has faced Martha Ric
hards throughout her athletic career.
Richards has been blessed twice: be
side being a basketball player accom
plished enough to be named Player of
the Year by the Women's Basketball
News Service last season, the Stanford
freshman is also an ace in golf and a
former state champion on the Wisconsin
links.
This two-sided talent placed her in
an enviable bind entering Stanford:
Either Richards could play golf this year
or concentrate on basketball, her source
of more recent acclaim.
Quite simply, she could not do both.
To remain competitive at either sport
requires a great deal of time and prac
tive; to remain strong at both, along
with maintaining a respectable academic
load, is an unfathomably difficult feat.
Moreover, with the golf and basket
ball seasons overlapping winter quarter,
it is logistically impossible to compete
in both. Unlike her tenure at Hudson
High School, where winter snows
precluded golf from conflicting with bas
ketball, the sunny climes of California
have forced Richards to restrict her
services to one team at a time.
Thus, her dilemma.
As anyone who has seen her buzzer
beating plays or patented "runner" tran
sition jump shot knows, golf has been
relegated to a hobbv this year as she
devoted full-time effort to a basketball

career. Though redshirting this season
will allow her to golf after her basketball
eligibility expires, Richards will spend
the next several winters exclusively on
the court.
"Basketball has always been my first
love," Richards said. "I've played it since
second grade. I think I've realized that
I have my whole life to play golf and I
only have a limited amount of time to
play basketball."
In the meantime, golf is Richards'
favorite relaxation activity. She prac
tices periodically with the Stanford golf
team she will join after next basketball
season, but more often she can be found
on the driving range keeping her shots
sharp.
All the while, the 5-foot-ll guard has
logged full-time hours with the basket
ball team, practicing a totally different
type of shooting. Rather than impede
her play, however, golf has augmented
her indoor sport.
"I guess because I've been doing them
for so long, I just learned how to split
the two up," Richards reasoned. "Each
one is a nice break from the other one.
They're similar in the sense of coor
dination, but they're totally different
games. They're both a mental relaxer
for the other one."
But, more important for the Cardinal
cagers, Richards refocuses during her
stints on the links. Drawing on her golf
experiences, Richards has added a di
mension to her game that perhaps only
Michael Jordan — another avid golfer
— possesses and understands.
"I would say definitely that my level
of concentration (has been improved by
golf)," Richards replied. "Free throw
shooting is much like putting, because
free throws will win games and putts

will win tournaments. In that sense,
golf has complemented my basketball
and vice-versa.
"I think one thing is it has also helped
my temperment in basketball. I've had
to learn to control my temper in golf
— because it's just you on the course,
you have to learn to take care of your
self. On the basketball court, you learn
to control your temper better because
of it."
What Richards apparetnly did not
need to learn is showmanship. A flashy
player on the court, her basketball
finesse contrasts with her powerful
drives on the golf course.
Playing in boys leagues through 7th
grade, Richards was forced to develop
some unorthodox moves in order to com
pete with the taller competitors. Many
of those plays, including her patented
runner, have remained active parts of
her repertoire.
It is the runner, in fact, that has
brought her much of her Stanford ac
claim and has become the source of her
pride. Regardless of the opponent, no
one seems to be able to counter the
runner.
"I learned that shot because, as you're
driving to the basket, a lot of people
will wait for your feet to get set before
they go up to block your shot," Richards
explained. "This shot is on the move,
so in that sense it's really a long-range
layup.
"That shot I use because it's hard for
the defender to block, and I've been
doing it for so long that it has become
natural."
With the runner, Richards has made
some of the more spectacular plays of

the year, including two halftime
buzzer-beaters. For this season,
the crowd at Maples Pavilion
eagerly awaits her entry into the
game and anticipates the flashy
style of basketball she brings onto
the court.
"Martha does have a style,"
Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer
said. "She's flashy, but I don't

think it's something she tries to
do; it just happens. She just gets
it done that way."
"Martha is definitely an excit
ing player," teammate and home
town friend Sonja Henning
agreed. "She has great moves to
the basket and is a great pure
shooter.
"She works hard, is determined
and is a great person," Henning
added. "She is a great asset to
out team."
