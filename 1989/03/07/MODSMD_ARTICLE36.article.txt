# Catcher Buckley spurs Broncos against Card nine
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Senior staff writer 
The season has now come full
circle.
In its first game of the year,
the Stanford baseball team en
dured a tough, 11-inning loss at
the hands of Santa Clara. Now
that the Cardinal is slumping,
it will try and avenge that
opening day loss and try to get
back on track today against the
Broncos.
If there's one person who
knows about slumps, it's Bronco
catcher Troy Buckley, who is
struggling at the plate with a
.241 average. He optimistically
prognosticates that both he and
Stanford will soon be rid of their
blues.
"They (Stanford) have too
much talent. They're gonna get
on a roll and they'll be there in
the regionals," Buckley said.
For all his woes at the plate,
the same can be said of the
junior backstop. He is an All-
America candidate who hit .442
with 16 home runs and 82 RBI
last season. When he catches on
fire this year, he will leave a lot
of unhappy pitchers in his wake.
"I don't think I've been hitting
the ball as well as I can. I've
been working hard at the batting
cage, and lately I've been hitting
the ball well but right at people,
which is frustrating," he com
mented.
Despite his troubles standing
at the plate, Buckley has had no
problems crouching behind it.

have too much tal
ent. They're gonna
get on a roll and
they'll be there in the
regionals.'

leading Bronco pitchers to an
impressive 4.20 ERA so far this
season.
"Coming into this year, I
really worked on my catching.
I've thrown out 75 percent of
runners trying to steal. Catching
has been my only bright spot."
People do not often notice the
expertise of a catcher, but a good
backstop can make the differ
ence between a pitcher who is
willing to take risks and one who
isn't.
"I think they (the pitchers) do
feel confident with me. My pitch
calling has gotten a lot better,
and now they know it's okay to
throw a curve ball in the dirt
with a runner on third because
they know I'll get it. I have con
fidence that I can get it, and
that confidence shows to them,"
Buckley said.
By virtue of his outstanding
offense and defense last season,
Buckley has become one of the
de facto team leaders, along with
the Broncos' other All-America
candidate, shortstop Matt Toole.

However, Buckley does not feel
any extra pressure to get out of
his slump because he is a team
leader.
"The only pressure I feel
comes from within me. They say
that doing well your junior year
is key to getting drafted. When
you go to bed at night you think
about it. You want it to go away
but it won't," he said.
Despite two early-season vic
tories over Stanford, a team
which has now struggled to a
10-13 record, Buckley does not

feel relaxed about today's game.
"We have to play our best
game to win. The whole team is
real intense about this game.
Stanford is really capable of
pounding us if we relax," he con
cluded.
Card note
Buckley is one of six Bellarmine
Prep graduates on the Bronco squad.
While he said that all Bellarmine
baseball players dream of going to
Stanford, there are currently no Bel
larmine graduates playing for the
Cardinal.
