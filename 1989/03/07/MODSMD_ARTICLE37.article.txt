# Stanford at Santa Clara
## 
### 
TODAY — 2 p.m. at Buck Shaw Stadium.
RECORDS — Stanford (10-13), Santa Clara (15-6)
PROBABLE STARTERS — Stanford: Brian Keyser (2-1, 5.92 ERA), Santa
Clara: Greg Gohr (4-3, 3.47)
WHO'S HOT — There were few bright spots in a disappointing weekend
for the Cardinal. Paul Carey hit his second home run in as many
games on Friday and has raised his average to .322 after a mini-slump.
Mark Carper pitched well in Friday's and Saturday's games, giving
up two hits in three innings work.
WHO'S MOT — The catcher's position appeared to be settled earlier
in the season with freshman Troy Tallman starting 15 of 23 games
behind the plate. After a rough weekend (O-for-8, 9 stolen bases
allowed), Eric Cox and Todd French may be back in the hunt.
BRONCO UPDATE — The Broncos are 10-0 at home this season. Second
baseman Ed Giovanola leads the offensive attack with a .432 batting
average, 3 homers and 17 RBI. Santa Clara has crushed 13 home
runs this season while holding its opponents to only four.
KEYS TO VICTORY — Stanford must do everything right to beat Santa
Clara. So far this season, all facets of the Cardinal's arsenal have
been spotty. When the pitching is good, the hitting isn't, and vice
versa. The team has the potential to bust the Broncos in a big way,
and a victory would give the Cardinal a much-needed lift going into
a tough weekend series against Arizona. Good performances by
Keyser, Carper and the rest of the pitching staff are of the utmost
importance.
