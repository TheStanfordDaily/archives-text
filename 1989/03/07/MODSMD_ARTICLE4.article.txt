## Opposition overcome, county has final say

The construction site for a new 80-bed
psychiatric hospital received a "yes" vote
from the Palo Alto City Council last night,
despite earlier complaints that Stanford
should use the land for much needed faculty
and staff housing.
In a reversal of a Feb. 8 decision, the
council voted 6 to 2 to support the plan
to build the hospital on Quarry and Arbo
retum Roads, in close proximity to the
Medical Center.
Noting the benefits of the site's location,
Director of University Planning Philip Wil
liams said "psychiatric patients are often
the victims of a whole range of other med
ical problems," and it is important for these
patients to have easy access to the Medical
Center.

Medical School Dean David Korn stressed
that "[making] use of an integrated medical
staff ... is absolutely critical" in providing
adequate medical care. If approved, the
new facility will accomodate more children,
adolescent and geriatric patients than the
current 34 beds in Hoover Pavilion, he said.
Santa Clara County will have final say
over the fate of the site because the land
lies outside Palo Alto city limits. However,
last night's council decision might strongly
influence the county's decision since the
site lies within the city's "sphere of influ

ford's community relations.

dents, Williams pointed to a University plan
