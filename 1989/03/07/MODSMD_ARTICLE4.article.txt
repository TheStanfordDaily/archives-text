# City council OKs new psychiatric hospital
## Opposition overcome, county has final say 
### Meg Jeffrey Staff writer 
The construction site for a new 80-bed
psychiatric hospital received a "yes" vote
from the Palo Alto City Council last night,
despite earlier complaints that Stanford
should use the land for much needed faculty
and staff housing.
In a reversal of a Feb. 8 decision, the
council voted 6 to 2 to support the plan
to build the hospital on Quarry and Arbo
retum Roads, in close proximity to the
Medical Center.
Noting the benefits of the site's location,
Director of University Planning Philip Wil
liams said "psychiatric patients are often
the victims of a whole range of other med
ical problems," and it is important for these
patients to have easy access to the Medical
Center.

Medical School Dean David Korn stressed
that "[making] use of an integrated medical
staff ... is absolutely critical" in providing
adequate medical care. If approved, the
new facility will accomodate more children,
adolescent and geriatric patients than the
current 34 beds in Hoover Pavilion, he said.
Santa Clara County will have final say
over the fate of the site because the land
lies outside Palo Alto city limits. However,
last night's council decision might strongly
influence the county's decision since the
site lies within the city's "sphere of influ
ence," said Andy Doty, director of Stan
ford's community relations.
Meanwhile, to alleviate council members'
concern that Stanford is not providing ad
equate housing for faculty, staff and stu
dents, Williams pointed to a University plan
for building 800 more housing
units on the old Children's Hospi
tal site, located near the Stanford
Shopping Center. Williams said
the University also hopes to con
struct 200 to 400 multi-family
housing units on a school site off
El Camino Real.
Last month, council members
voted against the new hospital
proposal, citing the need for more
housing. During last night's meet
ing, Williams reported that Stan-

'Psychiatric patients
are often the victims
of a whole range of
other medical prob
lems,' and should
have easy access.

ford now only provides housing
for 50 percent of its faculty, 87
percent of its undergraduates and
10 percent of its staff.
Michael Cobb, the council mem
ber who motioned to accept Stan
ford's proposal, warned other

members not to become overly
zealous in their quest for more
housing. "It's tempting to put
housing on every single parcel of
land available," said Cobb. Since
Palo Alto might never be able to
accomodate the housing demands
of Stanford and Palo Alto's
growing communities, some land
should be set aside for other pur
poses, he said.
The recommendation is part of
Palo Alto's Citywide Use and
Transportation Study designed to
restrict growth within the city.
If approved, Charter Medical
Corp. of Macon, Ga., will build
the hospital.
