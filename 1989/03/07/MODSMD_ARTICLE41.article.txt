# Paloma students return to asbestos-free home
## 
### Rob Burwell Senior staff writer 
After six nights away from their
dorm, third floor Paloma House
residents returned home yester
day afternoon to a residence
proclaimed free of asbestos, but
filled with the musty scent of
steam-cleaned carpets.
The residents were evacuated
last Tuesday due to asbestos
leakage caused by University
maintenance work. Workers dis
turbed the asbestos when they cut
holes in a Paloma corridor ceiling
and through the wall of one of
the student rooms to fix a ven
tilator fan.
According to Housing Director
Keith Guy, students were kept out
of their residences over the week
end because even after one thor
ough cleaning, the room where
the hole was cut in the wall
showed asbestos levels three times
that of the University's standard.

"We wanted to make sure every
thing was clean before anybody
came back in," Guy said.
Workers filled the hole in the
room's wall and cleaned it once
on Friday and again on Saturday
to reduce the asbestos level to a
limit meeting University stand
ards, Guy said.
According to Guy, randomly
sampled rooms on the third floor
showed asbestos levels of only
.005 strands per cubic centimeter,
the same level found in the sur
rounding air.
While the residents were away,
University workers placed a steel
plate over the hole in the corri
dor's ceiling and cleaned the hall
way's carpet with special vacuum
cleaners that trap asbestos parti
cles.
Freshman Brian Meckler, who
lives in the room which had the
hole in the wall, was unsatisfied
with how his room was left when
he moved back in yesterday.
