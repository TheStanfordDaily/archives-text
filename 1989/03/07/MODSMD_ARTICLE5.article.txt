# Show to feature Leno
## Concert Network books top comedian 
### Rob Burwell Senior staff writer 
Scoring a mayor coup, the Stanford Con
cert Network signed Jay Leno, one of
America's most popular comedians, to per
form an April 30 concert in Frost Amphi
theater.
According to Network director Steve
Cramer, this is "the biggest concert in
recent memory" that the concert network
has put on without a mayor Bay Area
promoter.
"The main idea behind this concert is
that it is an experiment," Cramer said. The
concert will be promoted at Stanford only,
and will be used to gauge if Stanford can
support concerts by "bigger acts" on its
own, Cramer said.
"We want to see if this campus alone
will support a mayor act. If it can, the
possibilities are endless," Cramer said.
"The student body needs to get behind this
concert. If they do, this could open a lot
of doors for a wide range of other concerts."
Cramer said that in the future, if the
Leno concert is a success, the Network will
"try to attract acts along the lines of Ziggy
Marley and Tracy Chapman, acts that only
major promoters could get a hold of before."
According to Cramer, the concert will be
held at 2 p.m. and tickets will be $12.50
for students and $15.50 for non-students
— a far cry from the $19 tickets for Leno's
last Bay Area appearance.

'We want to see if this
campus alone will support a
major act. If it can, the pos
sibilities are endless.'

Tickets are scheduled to go on sale at
10 a.m. Friday at the Tresidder Ticket
Office.
Leno, a "Late Night with David Letter
man" regular and heir-apparent to Johnny
Carson's "Tonight Show," committed to
the appearance last Thursday. Leno gives
more than 250 concerts a year, loves
touring and is especially fond of performing
at colleges, Cramer said.
"Jay Leno is an act that we have been
pursuing for a while," Cramer said. "We
believe he will appeal to students with his
social commentary and draw a wide range
of people."
Leno is known for his stories about his
parents, his sarcastic repartee with Letter
man, his Elvis impersonation and his char
acteristic protruding chin. Leno has had
specials on both networks and cable and
is a spokesman for Doritos.
Television critic Tom Pundit of The
Washington Post has commented in past
reviews that Leno is more than a standup
comic: "He's a standup social commentator,
a sarcastic reprocessor of American pop
culture."
