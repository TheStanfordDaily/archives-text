# TAs say section sizes are too large
## Survey reveals that budget cuts have taken their toll 
### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
Large section sizes in every depart
ment of the School of Humanities and
Sciences are hindering education and
need to be reduced, according to a sur
vey of 193 teaching assistants conducted
by the ASSU Committee on Democracy
in Education.
The committee and several graduate
students presented the results of the
survey to Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Ewart Thomas in a special
meeting last Friday.
In an interview yesterday afternoon,
Thomas called the meeting successful
and informative, but said he plans no
immediate changes for Humanities and
Sciences TA funding. Budget constraints
forced the school to cut TA funding this
year by 6 to 14 percent for each of its

departments.
The average section size of the TAs
questioned in the survey was 21.9, but
the average figure the TAs gave for an
"ideal" section was 14.3, a difference of
more than 33 percent.
The most dramatic responses came
from TAs in the Asian Languages and
Psychology Departments. Asian Lan
guage sections contained an average of
19 students, but TAs from the depart
ment said their sections should contain
less than 10 students each. Similarly,
psychology sections averaged nearly 30
students, but psychology TAs reported
that they wanted sections of less than
13.
The questionnaire noted that 13.1
percent of sections had more than 30
students and 5.4 percent had more than
40 people.
"The general consensus amongst our

respondents was that as class sizes in
creased, the quality of education was
hindered considerably," the survey re
ported.
The survey also included questions
about issues other than section size.
Although 79 percent of the TAs said
"funding from their department is their
primary source of income," just 46 per
cent said this funding is "sufficient to
cover basic living expenses."
In two other questions, the TAs said
they worked an average of 15.7 hours
per week and 81 percent of TAs working
on dissertations said their "teaching in
terferes with their own work."
Thomas said the meeting gave him a
"sense of urgency" about trying to solve
TA issues. "We really have to get every
one thinking about solutions," he said.
Students who attended the
meeting were generally pleased
with Thomas' reaction to the sur
vey. "I think he understood a little
bit more," said senior Colin
Hampson, a committee member.
Thomas added that he was es
pecially impressed by one history
TA who spent more time than
other TAs grading papers because
thorough editing helped develop
his students' writing ability.
Humanities and Sciences should
"deliver more such personalized
instruction," Thomas said. "We
should be trying to help under
graduates in writing skills .. . and
critical thinking skills."
Thomas said he advocates de
veloping such personal instruction
in writing and language courses
by aggressively reallocating TA
funds from classes which do not
require small sections. For exam
ple, Thomas said neither students
nor TAs in his Statistics 60 class
have complained about its 40-
student sections.

Too many students per section
An ASSU survey of graduate student teaching assistants revealed that there is a large gap between the
TAs' ideal section size and actual section size.
