# Spring lake classes to relocate
## Sailing, windsurfing instructors expect dry season 
### Hugh R. Bethell Staff writer 
Anticipating an empty Lake Lagunita,
sailing and windsurfing instructors are pre
paring to move their popular spring quarter
classes to other local bodies of water, ones
which they feel will make the courses even
better.
Stanford Sailing Director Joe Petrucci
said yesterday that windsurfing and sailing
opportunities will be more plentiful than
ever this spring, despite the drought con
ditions that may keep the lake dry.
"We recognize that windsurfing and sail
ing are a traditional part of spring at Stan
ford, so we've worked around the drought
to make sure that nothing is lost," Petrucci
said.
The windsurfing and sailing classes,
which regularly rank among the three most
popular classes at Stanford, involve almost
a thousand people each year.
For windsurfers, the change will be a
move to Felt a full body of water

just behind the lake on the Stanford
campus. To ease any worries about trans
portation, the program will be providing
van service for the short trip to and from
the lake for all class members and recrea
tional sailboardera. Once there, student*
will find a new fleet of boards and better
conditions in which to sail, according to
experienced windsurfers who have tried the
new location.
"Felt Lake is definitely a better place to
sail than Lagunita, because the winds are
more consistent, and the water is nicer,"
said freshman Ted Huang, an Olympic
squad member and the No. 1 ranked
boardsailer in the country last year.
For those interested in small boat sailing,
the site this spring will be an inlet of San
Francisco Bay near Redwood City. There,
classes and recreational sailing will be of*
fered in the program's recently acquired
fleet of 14-foot Capri boats.
By most accounts, sailing on the Bay
will be very different from the lake.
