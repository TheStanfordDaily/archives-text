"If I have been able to see farther than others, it was because
1 stood on the shoulders of giants"
— Sir Issac Newton
Simply put, we re looking for visionaries. Individuals who can look beyond the pat response, the
traditional solution.
We want original thinkers who can build and expand on their education. If you are looking to make
the most of your career, you probably know that your best chance to make a contribution is to
associate yourself with a company that is at the top of its field.
We think we can truly offer you that kind of opportunity. Pansophic Systems, Incorporated is one of
the largest independent computer software companies in the world. Headquartered in Illinois, we
