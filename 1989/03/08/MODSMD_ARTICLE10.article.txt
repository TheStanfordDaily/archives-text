Stanford wins Supreme Court case
backing state law on arbitration
Stanford has won a 6-2 U.S. Supreme Court
ruling backing the application of state law to
arbitration contracts.
In the case, Volt Information Sciences v. Board
of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University,
a contractor sought to compel arbitration in
seeking $4 million for additional work done in
stalling electrical conduits on campus.
The Supreme Court decision means the dispute
will return to the courts. The California Court
of Appeals had previously ruled in Stanford's
favor and the California Supreme Court denied
Volt's petition for discretionary review.
In a decision released Monday, March 6, Chief
Justice William Rehnquist said California law is
not preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act,
"where the parties have agreed that their arbi
tration agreement will be governed by the law
of California."
The Federal Arbitration Act "does not confer
a right to compel arbitration of any dispute at
any time," Rehnquist added. "It confers only the
right to obtain an order directing that 'arbitration
proceed in the manner provided for in the parties'

agreement.' "
"The federal policy is simply to ensure the
enforceability, according to their terms, of private
agreements to arbitrate," Rehnquist said.
Justices William Brennan and Thurgood Mar
shall dissented, while Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor took no part in the case. Rehnquist,
O'Connor and Justice Anthony Kennedy are all
Stanford alumni.
