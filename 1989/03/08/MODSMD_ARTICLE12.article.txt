# Eastern faced with bankruptcy
## 
### 
MIAMI (AP) — A federal judge
yesterday refused to order East
ern Airlines pilots back to work,
even though Eastern warned it
couldn't otherwise survive the 4-
day-old Machinists strike. A spin
off job action by pilots nationwide
failed to clog airports as feared.
Eastern earlier sent 2,500 more
non-union workers home, blaming
pilots for leaving it with "no busi
ness on the books."
"If the pilots do not come back
to work, Eastern Airlines is gone,"

company attorney David Ross
said. He warned during a court
hearing that Eastern was faced
with bankruptcy without its 3,600
pilots, who have firmly refused to
cross picket lines the Machinists
union set up Saturday.
U.S. District Judge Edward
Davis denied Eastern's request for
a temporary restraining order less
than a half hour after the three
hour hearing.
Pilots union press representa
tive J.B. Stokes called the ruling

"a victory of principle; a victory
of ethics."
"We've obviously made our
case. Basically what this means
is that nothing's changed," Stokes
said, adding pilots will continue
to honor Machinists picket lines.
Ross said the company could
have to file for federal bankruptcy
protection and couldn't operate
more than 48 to 72 hours more
without the pilots. The airline did
not immediately decide whether
to appeal Davis' ruling, he said.
