North judge reprimands lawyers
WASHINGTON (AP) - Judge Gerhard Gesell,
irritated by repeated interruptions of Oliver
North's trial by claims that national security was
about to be violated, warns lawyers in a blistering
memo that he will no longer honor claims he
considers frivolous.
In an order late Monday dismissing a North
contention that prosecutors were guilty of mis
conduct, Gesell blamed many of the problems in
handling secret documents on the Bush admin
istration.
The North trial was in recess yesterday because
of snow and freezing rain.

It has become clear, Gesell said in the written
order, that many documents were classified only
for purposes of the North trial.
Californians view solar eclipse
PASADENA, Calif. (AP) â€” Solar telescopes
yielded views of flare-producing sunspots and
silhouetted mountains on the moon yesterday as
crowds gathered to watch a partial solar eclipse
visible across western North America.
"It's kind of neat," said map maker Jan Mayne,
who was among dozens of people watching the
eclipse through two types of solar telescopes at
the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena.
