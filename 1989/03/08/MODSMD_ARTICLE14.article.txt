# Tower hearings heat up
## Senator says he saw nominee drunk on Senate floor 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
Democratic senator said yesterday
he had seen Defense Secretary
designate John Tower "under the
influence of alcohol" in the Senate,
making the dramatic claim shortly
after President Bush insisted that
"not one" senator has first-hand
evidence that Tower had a drink
ing problem.
Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, meanwhile, flatly pre
dicted the nomination would be
rejected when it comes to a vote.
Even so, Sen. Christopher Dodd
of Connecticut became the second
Democrat to support confirma
tion.
"I owe John Tower the same
fairness and careful judgment he
used 22 years ago," Dodd said,
referring to Tower's 1967 defense
of Tom Dodd, then a senator and
the father of the current senator.

The elder Dodd was censured by
the Senate.
In a riveting exchange on the
fourth day of increasingly heated
debate, Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-
Ariz., said he saw Tower "under
the influence of alcohol" while on
the Senate floor. Tower was a
senator from 1961 to 1984.
"But inebriated to the point
that he could not operate?" inter
rupted Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
"I have not seen him inebriated
to the extent he could not perform
his duties," replied DeConcini,
who said later he had seen Tower
"under the influence" several
times.
But Tower, in a statement,
denied the charge, saying, "I have
never been inebriated on the Sen
ate floor."
Bush, in a session earlier yes
terday with White House re

porters, repeated his oft-stated in
sistence that no senators had
first-hand information that
Tower was hampered by a drink
ing problem.
"I haven't had one single
senator — not one — [who] served
with him over the years, say, 'I
have seen him. My first-hand
evidence is this man is ineligible
because of his consumption of
spirits,'" Bush said.
Mitchell said that despite the
decision Monday of Southern
Democrat Howell Heflin of Ala
bama to support Tower, the nom
ination will lose.
"I believe that when the vote
occurs the nomination will be
rejected and it is obvious if the
Republicans had the votes they
would now be demanding the vote
take place," Mitchell told
reporters.
