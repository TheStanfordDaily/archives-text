JERUSALEM (AP) - Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir wants
Egypt and Jordan to help appoint
a Palestinian delegation to nego
tiate peace with Israel, a Shamir
press respresentative said yester
day.
Proposed delegates would be
subject to Israel's approval, and
the government would reject any
Palestinian affiliated in any way
with the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization, said press respresenta
tive Yossi Ahimeir.
"With the help of Jordan and
Egypt, and with good will, it will
be possible to choose a [Pales
tinian! delegation which will be a
temporary representational body
until the beginning of autonomy,"
Ahimeir said in an interview.
Shamir's proposal was made
public as the issue of peace with
Palestinians caused increasing
splits in the coalition Cabinet of
his right-wing Likud bloc and the
left-leaning Labor Party.
Some Labor Cabinet ministers
have proposed talking to the PLO
under certain conditions. Others
favor choosing Palestinian nego
tiators by elections in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
But Shamir rejects both ideas,
Ahimeir said, confirming yester
day's newspaper reports.
He said an interim autonomy
plan granting Palestinians limited
autonomy should be established
before elections. Palestinians
could then hold elections for an
administrative council that would
negotiate a long-term solution, he
said.
Speaking to a visiting Socialist
International delegation, Labor
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin

raised the possibility of elections
Monday as a way to get around
the impasse over the PLO.
"With these political figures
elected in the territories, we will
conduct negotiations concerning

the interim period and following
a period of time we shall reach a
discussion of the permanent solu
tion with Jordan representatives
of the residents of the territories,"
Rabin said yesterday.
