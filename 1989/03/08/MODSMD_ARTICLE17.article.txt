Stanford's HP link
raises questions of
institutional autonomy

IT'S A SQUARE DANCE. In
dustry and education have
been dancing in their own
circles for years and are now
seeking out partners. Each wants
to attempt more ambitious moves
and education wants to swing to
heights it doesn't have the finan
cial muscle to reach alone.
Stanford's Computer Science
Department is getting a dramatic
lift by Hewlett-Packard's crea
tion of a new science research
center within the department.
Last week, several senior HP
researchers moved here to join
Stanford researchers in conduct
ing basic research open to the
public domain.
Unfortunately, in the science
world today, limited funds make
it almost impossible to get
around directed research. Scien
tists often have to take money
from wherever they can get it.
Stanford scientists included.
With the new HP science cen
ter, Stanford is launching an ex
periment that tries to preserve
the University's academic free
dom while loosening the financial
shackles impeding unlimited re
search.
Nonetheless, the new partner
ship between HP and Stanford
raises some important questions
about the nature of a university's
corporate ties and sends out a
signal alerting university leaders
to the possiblity of future abuse
of this currently well-conceived
link.
Tight Stanford ties to any cor
poration call for serious consid

eration and investigation. In
pursuing such alliances, the Uni
versity risks taking on responsi
bility for corporate actions, losing
its control over research choices
and becoming a vocational school
rather than a research university.
Academic study should extend
into even unprofitable areas. Uni
versity research should not ex
clusively benefit any corporation
that donates sufficient sums of
money. Stanford should not be in
the service of corporations' cus
tomers. Close corporate links
pose all of these threats.
Fortunately, careful supervi
sion over the creation of the HP
center has averted these dangers
in this endeavor. And in sum, the
center's benefit to the University
outweighs its potential traps.
The HP scientists, whom HP
generously pays $100,000 per
year to work on the Farm, will
live on campus and work together
with Stanford students and fac
ulty on problems of "basic intel
lectual interest," according to Me
chanical Engineering Prof. Elliott
Levinthal.
Stanford will not be "designing
products for the company," he
said. HP researchers will not
teach classes, except for occa
sional guest appearances, and all
work at the center will be pub
lished.
The experimental HP center
may be the first of several similar
research centers to be based at
Stanford, according to Levinthal.
If this is the case, the faculty
and administration must show
caution and care in the develop
ment of promising, but possibly
compromising, joint ventures
with private industry.
Dancing is fine, but the Uni
versity should be careful not to
choose partners who will tread
on its feet and always lead.
