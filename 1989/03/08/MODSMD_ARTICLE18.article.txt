## Pageants are demeaning to women, unlike athletics 
### 
IN A FEB. 28 article, reigning Miss
America Gretchen Carlson likens
the Miss America Pageant to an
athletic competition because of the
extensive "training" which she under
went in preparation for the pageant. Is
she serious?
What did her professional body
consultants recommend to her during
her daily three-hour sessions? If
Carlson is trying to tell students at
Stanford that these sessions were not
conducted in order to transform her
body into the "perfect" (i.e., most sexy)
female physique, then she must believe
that we are naive indeed.
Does Carlson honestly believe that
most athletes, both male and female,
stand in front of the mirror for hours

trying to ascertain whether they have
the stereotypical ideal of the human
form? Maybe Carlson should talk with
a few of our female Olympic gold
medal winners.
If these pageants have always been
so positive for women, giving them
"confidence, discipline, and self
esteem," why do people still treat her
as a "dumb blonde"?
While I do not want to take away
from Carlson's many accomplishments,
can she honestly believe that an unat
tractive woman, no matter how accom
plished, would win the Miss America
title? Does a contest which is primarily
based on beauty really help women in
their fight for equality and respect?
Simply because an obviously intelli-

gent woman has won the title this year
does not make this contest less dis
tasteful.
Finally, Carlson implies that those
who oppose the Miss America Pageant
are "jealous" of her beauty. This sort
of response, typically from males,
arises every time that a woman asks
not to be treated like a peice of meat
or opposes pornography and other
"literature" which exclusively stresses
the female body.
When female beauty, and in particu
lar the "perfect body," is stressed in
this society, it affects all women,
whether they are beautiful or not. It
ties women's self-image to the way
that they look; it gives rise to a game
of "match the fashion model," causing

an inordinate amount of bulimia and
anorexia among young women.
It causes women to waste precious
time trying to improve their bodies
and faces simply to achieve the super
ficial acceptance of "Miss America."
Maybe Carlson would still characterize
my response as jealousy, but I would
characterize it as an opposition to a
form of psychological enslavement.
Gretchen Carlson will only be
respected for the intelligent, accom
plished woman she is when her con
test, and society at large, ceases to
view beauty as the ultimate female
accomplishment.
