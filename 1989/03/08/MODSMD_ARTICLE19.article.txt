# Link between David Duke and Stanford based on innuendo
## 
### 
One of the delights of working at
Stanford is the entertainment derived
from reading The Stanford Daily and
watching it keep a sanctimonious nose
in the air while its feet slog through
the mud of yellow journalism.
The latest joke is the March 3 arti
cle, "Anti-Semitic leaflets linked to
associate of David Duke." I hold no
brief or affection whatsoever for anti-
Semites, racists, ther Ku Klux Klan or
any such enemies of freedom. I also
have no liking for the smear tactics of
guilt by association, which is what The
Daily practices in the article.
There is absolutely nothing in the
article, other than in its inflammatory
headline and its irresponsible first
sentence, that directly links David
Duke with the anti-Semitic fliers that

were placed on cars parked at the Oval
in January. Nothing. Not a word. Not
a hint of any evidence.
All you have is the allegation of
prior association between the head of
the organization named on the fliers
and David Duke, the new state legis
lator from Metairie, La., and the fact
that Warner's Sons of Liberty organi
zation is headquartered in Metairie,
which is Duke's district. (Come to
think of it, I've been in Metairie a
couple of times, surely grounds for
denunciation.)
In the middle of the article, the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith
is cited as the source for information
about the activities of Warner and
another group, the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan.
Given that fact, The Daily's article
could just as well have borne the head
line "Anti-Semitic leaflets linked to
subject of Anti-Defamation League
information."
That would have been morally and
logically equivalent to the totally mean
ingless and irresponsible article. If

you want to nail somebody who
deserves it, do so on the basis of fact,
not innuendo.
