# Hospital budget troubles raise rates
## 
### David Dirks 
A budgetary crisis at the Stanford
Hospital forced an unusual mid-year 7
percent rate hike March 1, due partly
to unexpectedly high operating costs
and to low Medicare and MediCal reim
bursements, Hospital President Sheldon
King said.
Referring to a $153 million new wing
that opened this year, King said, "Until
the new building came on line, we didn't
know all the costs. ... It was more ex
pensive than we predicted."
Similarly, the hospital staff underes
timated the reimbursement rates from
Medicare and MediCal. Director of
Finance David Sakai said, "The federal
government has a deficit. We just
weren't perceptive enough to see that
they would be taking it out of our
hides."
"It's what we're seeing for the 1989-
90 budget that is making this increase
necessary," said Sakai. Projections for

the financial success of the new wing
have been downgraded periodically as
increased costs and decreased revenues
became apparent. "As recently as eight
to 10 months ago the forecast became
even less rosy," said Sakai.
Although all beds in the new wing
are filled, start-up costs for the new
building and debt service on two bonds
are raising expenses. However, the new
wing eventually should attract more
physicians and their patients, which will
raise revenue, King said.
Another major problem facing the
hospital is competition from other hospi
tals. "There are too many hospitals and
too many high-tech programs (in the
area)," said King. Even so, he noted
that Stanford's hospital has managed
to hold and even slightly increase its
market share over the last few years.
In an effort to abate the loss of rev
enues, new programs including ones in
a bone marrow transplant, homecare,
alcohol and drug rehabilitation and the

lifeflight helicopter transport have been
initiated.
The aim, said King, is to achieve a
vertically-integrated system. By provid
ing all the necessary services for
patients in one hospital, "we can provide
one-stop shopping" in health care, he
said, adding that the smaller hospitals
in the area are unable to provide such
a service.
The hospital's financial shortfalls are
symptomatic of the health care industry
as a whole. In 1987, hospitals in North
ern California lost $284 million on pa
tient care, according to the Hospital
Council of Northern California.
The new wing was originally planned
back in the early '80s, when hospital
revenues were expected to be greater
than they are. A plan was introduced
five years ago to resize the facility in
order to cut costs, but the expected
one-and-a-half year delay of construc
tion was deemed to be too expensive.
