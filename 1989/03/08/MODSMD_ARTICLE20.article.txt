# Miss America hasn't stressed 'all-around' criteria and talent
## 
### 
Gretchen Carlson, a Stanford senior
recently crowned Miss America, in a
Feb. 28 article claimed that the Miss
America pageant has "from the begin
ning, stressed dynamic, all-around con
testants."
Clearly Carlson hasn't delved too
deeply into the pageant's history. If she
had, she would know it has always
been a contest of beauty and not of
dynamism, intelligence or any other
traits she may believe won her the
title.
According to Susan Dworkin's book

"Miss America, 1945," when the
pageant began in the early 19205, all
17 of the judges were artists. Contes
tants' beauty was measured on a 100-
point body breakdown. Each judge of
fered 10 points for eyes; five points for
hair; 15 points for the construction of
the head; and so on.
In 1945, criteria for the judging
were virtually the same. Judges were
instructed to consider facial beauty,
voice, wholesomeness, hygiene, dress
and special talents. Talent was added
as a criterion in 1938 for the sole pur
pose of making the stage show more
fun to watch.
Thus, Carlson's claim that the
pageant has always stressed "all-around
contestants" is completely unfounded.
If pageant officials were serious about
emphasizing "all-around contestants,"
grades or SAT scores would be a
judging criterion. It is ridiculous to
suggest that the purpose of the Miss
America Pageant has been anything
but a beauty contest.
