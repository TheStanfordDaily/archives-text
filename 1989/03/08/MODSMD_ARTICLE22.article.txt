## Fear of falling — in love 
### 
SOMEONE ONCE SAID to me,
"John, I think I know why rela
tionships are so rare at this school.
A serious relationship ... is like a five
unit class, and me, I'm already taking
17 units this quarter. Most people don't
want to take 22 units!"
We laughed at this study list overload
and at the possible requirement of a pe
tition to the University, and then we
wondered lightheartedly at the possibility
of taking it Pass/No Credit, or maybe
Pass/No Commitment. I can see it on the
study list now:
430-001 Beginning Romantic Relation
ship, 5 units, P/NC.
So if you really bombed the class, you
could painlessly accomplish a quick for
getting, somewhat analogous to the way
the Registrar will remove the No Credits
from your transcript.
No, this is ridiculous. I know I
shouldn't view such things so lightly, but
I say it's fun to think about, and it can
cheer you up when you're frustrated
about the "r-word."
The fear of relationships stems from
the intensity of the commitment involved.
The problem is that love is associated
with intensity, a force seemingly outside
human control.
It involves union, sacrifice, giving and
the ultimate togetherness. We've been
brought up in a culture that continually
defines it that way. Look, for instance,
at magazine ads, novels, poetry, movies,
and even "The Love Boat."
At this school, there are those rare
instances when two people do "get to
gether." But too often in these cases the

two lovers disappear from the face of the
dorm and then pretty much from the
face of the earth. It seems that the ul
timate togetherness requires that you
and your lover exclude the rest of the
world. That's pretty scary.
And then when I sometimes do see
them again, they're always together,
never apart. I begin to think of them not
as two people, not as two individuals,
but instead as one couple, one form. Or
I think of one only in terms of the other.
It becomes strange to see Jack without
Jill.
They lose their individual identities,
giving themselves up to come close to
each other, and there is no ground
beneath them. The intensity of this ul
timate togetherness causes the loss of
self, and that just leads to a continual
falling.
I was talking to a friend the other day,
and he told me that what makes love so
desirable is the thrill of feeling like a
rider on a plummeting roller-coaster, the
excitement of an accelerating skydiver.
This person's ideas are exactly what I
mean by the continual falling that comes
from "love." The only problem is that
he doesn't see the problem of falling —
it can only lead to the depths of loss.
The poet Rainer Maria Rilke wrote as
a young man that, "A togetherness be
tween two people is an impossibility, and
where it seems, nevertheless, to exist, it
is a narrowing, a reciprocal agreement
which robs either one party or both of
his fullest freedom and development." No

wonder so many students fear this kind
of commitment.
Rilke then offers an alternative. He
writes, "once the realization is accepted
that even between the closest human
beings infinite distances continue to exist,
a wonderful living side by side can grow
up, if they succeed in loving the distance
between them which makes it possible
for each to see the other whole and
against a wide sky!"
This alternative involves a commitment
that does not deprive you of your self,
of your own ground. Instead, it allows
for growth and stability. Usually when I
think of the typical lovers, I see them
throwing themselves at each other,
promising to remain the same now and
forever.
Unfortunately, in their intensity, they
forget that life involves change, that they
will — "no matter what" — change. And
then what? They are caught in a past
image, left falling.
Rilke's "living side by side" allows for
change and growth. Instead of an ideal,
intense togetherness that causes vertigo,
it offers Stanford students an opportunity
for a relationship, without the fear of
commitment.
