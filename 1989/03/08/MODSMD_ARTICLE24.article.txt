Research on mice
helps scientists to
understand AIDS
I write this in response to Lise
Giraud's Jan. 23 viewpoint. When she
and I worked together in the 1970s to
combat U.S. involvement in Southeast
Asia, we did so, at least in part, by a
common motivation to end the sense
less iryury and loss of human life that
destroys both the invader and the in
vaded.
It is with the same motivation that I
continued on in medical research. Back
then, few of my experiments had much
of a chance of impacting directly the
health of human beings. Thanks to
advancements in technology, discoveries
in the laboratory now are in reality
only a few years from advancing medi
cal knowledge and improving patient
care.
Once in a while a biomedical scien
tist is lucky enough to make an ad
vance that has a chance of wide appli
cation, given that the advance is
proven to be valid, reproducible, and
explained in sufficient detail that
others may build on that advance.
I was fortunate to be a member of a
small team which found a method to
implant human organs into genetically
immunodeficient mice in a way that

human blood and immunity cells
develop — and probably function — as
they do in humans.
This enabled us (and others) to
approach human disease for the first
time in a way in which we are not just
studying a potential model for these
diseases — but the human diseases
themselves.
The human cells, tissues and organs
we implanted could not carry out the
complex developmental events that lead
to functional blood and immune cells
in test tubes. We cannot simulate these
events by computer. We had no choice
but to use animals in the service of
humans. We had no trouble making
that choice, although it is always am
agonizing choice, and one that chal
lenges us to do so in the most humane
fashion possible.
For those of us who have been frus
trated by our inability to begin to
understand how the human im
munodeficiency virus (and possible
cofactors) leads to AIDS, this animal
appeared to offer a real opportunity to
develop therapies and vaccines.
Both Giraud and I have felt person
ally the impact of this cruel epidemic;
we have lost friends and colleagues,
and will certainly soon lose many
more. Therefore, my colleagues and I
decided to carry out the experiment of
infecting these man-mouse chimeras
with HIV.
It took several months from the

moment we made that decision to the
time we could carry out the experi
ment in a safe fashion — precious time
if you are a person with AIDS —
largely because we had to confront a
bureaucratic tangle engendered by the
University's reluctance to endanger its
workers or the community, as well as
its justified wariness of community
actions based not only on knowledge,
but also on fear.
The animals we tested (and reported
in Science magazine in December) were
not, as Giraud characterized, mice that
genetically carry the AIDS virus. The
mice that can carry HIV in their germ
cells in a way that it can be passed on
genetically are in Bethesda, Md, only.
Our mice have HIV captive only in
the human tissues we implanted and
cannot pass it on genetically. Yet we
reproduced the containment facility
that was developed in Bethesda, just so
we could guarantee that no mice would
escape accidentally; and even if they
did escape, they could not pass on the
disease to mice in the wild, and there
fore could not be an animal reservoir
for human (or animal) infection.
Indeed, the greatest risk for the HIV
infection is, and remains, human pas
sage of the virus by sexual and con
taminated needle contacts.
When one makes a choice to block or
delay research that is in the service of
humans, as Giraud and others in the
Palo Alto Humane Society have, one

makes a clear choice of relative values
(in this case, mouse vs. human), and
one must take responsibility for the
consequences of one's actions.
Giraud and I held the U.S. military
and individual citizens who promul
gated the Vietnam War responsible for
actions that led to horrible human
losses. I urge her please to think
carefully about her actions that will
certainly slow our ability to diagnose
and treat awful human diseases like
AIDS.

Protest University's
amoral Webb Ranch
policy on workers
Stanford is called the "Farm," but
for people at Stanford's Webb Ranch
"plantation" fits better.
University President Donald Kennedy
was satirized recently by The Daily as
a feudal "Prince" who permits "degrad
ing" labor practices under his nose,
but a visit to Webb Ranch also sug
gests the term "Massa."
Webb Ranch has been producing
profits for Stanford and the Webb fam
ily for generations. Can the Stanford
community look the other wav now

that these conditions are public knowl
edge?
If you go to Webb Ranch you will
not see the children with bloated
bellies and flies on their lips. You will
see children who are obviously loved
and put first. But you will see what it
means to live in poverty, and you will
be appalled. This is good, for the more
people who are appalled, the more
likely it is that conditions will improve.
To claim anything less than full
responsibility for the lives of people
who work on Stanford land, as Ken
nedy has done, is at best amoral. This
is the kind of behavior one expects
from corporations, not universities.
Thankfully, the Kennedy example fell
flat with students. They said weeks ago
Stanford should advocate workers'
rights or lose our claim of being a
"morally conscious community."
Stanford holds conferences on im
proving the human condition at which
speeches are made on how Stanford
students can make a difference.
Students can. And so can all the
members of this community. Go to
Webb Ranch and talk to people. See
for yourself. Then act. Some people at
Webb Ranch are not working and need
financial help now. If you want to
help, write USW-Webb Relief Fund,
Box 7152, Stanford, Ca. or call 723-
3680.
