Q # How do non-stick pans
• keep things from stick
ing? What is it about my
Teflon frying pan that
makes my pancakes slide
like Wayne Gretzky on a
newly-iced rink ?
A. Things do not stick to
• Teflon — the material
that has brought human
kind a step closer to the per
fect pancake — because of
the fluorine contained in its
molecules, according to
Chemical Engineering Prof.
Gerald Fuller.
Teflon's polymers, long
chains of molecules, have a
lot of flourine in them.
Other polymers such as
polyethelene, a type of plas
tic, contain hydrogen. The
fluorine in Teflon makes the
molecule inert so it does not
associate or react with other
chemicals.
Water and other liquids
tend to bead up on the
Teflon. Their molecules are
more attracted to them
selves than to the the
Teflon, according to Fuller.
The surface tension makes
the liquids bead up. If a liq
uid is attracted to a surface,
it will usually spread out,
like water on metal.
Pancake batter acts differ
ently because of its thick
ness. The batter is affected
by several forces. It will tend
to form a ball because of
surface tension. Gravity
counteracts batter's ten
dency to form a ball by
spreading the batter out.
Though Teflon does not
stick to most materials,
manufactures have been
clever enough to bond it to
the surfaces of pots and
pans.
Q, What causes the wind
• to blow?
A. Contrary to the myth
• perpetuated by some
Western Culture classes, the
winds are not produced by
the Greek god Aeolus.
Instead, the wind blows
because of differences in at-
