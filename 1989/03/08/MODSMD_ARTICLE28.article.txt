# Scientists tapping brain waves to create cerebral orchestra

Listening to a Walkman while
studying may become a thing of
the past. Instead of wasting bat
teries, a student might be able to
take advantage of brain power to
make music.
A Stanford duet has developed
the "biomuse," a device that can
make music from electrical signals
given off by the body. Although
they may not be able to make the
whole world sing, the researchers
say they think their invention may
have clinical use in some cases.
This invention can take signals
of muscle tension, eye movement
or brain waves from skin elec
trodes and send them to a stand
ard music synthesizer to create
music from motion. A change in
thought or a slight movement will
generate a different sound, and
the biomuse can produce these
sounds at amazing speeds.
"Since sophomore year in col
lege I've dreamed about being able
to produce music directly from
mind (and) body just by thinking
or by moving — ideally by

feeling," said Hugh Lusted, a re
search associate with the Stanford
Medical Center.
Ben Knapp, an electrical engi
neering graduate student at Stan
ford, designed the circuitry for
the biomuse.
Because systems in nature work
in harmony, Lusted said he
thought that these systems must
have their own musical score to
which they perform. Lusted said
he has believed for years that bi
ological systems are inherently
musical, and the biomuse provides
a good research tool for studying
the interaction of music and biol
ogy.
The biomuse may prove inval
uable for quadraplegics and
rehabilitation patients. A simple
eye movement by a quadraplegic
could produce music, providing
artistic — and controllable — ex
pression.
The biomuse might also be ap
plied for therapeutic treatment,
and those who have difficulty with
physical coordination can have
fun with music.
Musicians and composers can

take advantage of the biomuse's
versatility by freeing their hands
to play other instruments while
creating body sounds with the
biomuse.
Not only does the biomuse have
serious uses, but the video game
industry might also take advan
tage of the biomuse. Although it
has not yet been done, Lusted
said it would be conceptually easy
to write a program producing
video images rather than audio
ones.
Imagine a video game junkie
who could sit in a wired chair,
allowing the computer to respond
quickly to movements by the user.
The interactions between com
puter and user could theoretically
be very rapid, producing stimulat
ing and exciting video games, ac
cording to Lusted.
Getting the biomuse to produce
a desired sound would — as with
anything else — take practice.
Lusted said, however, that
producing music would be fairly
easy because muscles move
through voluntary action.
Controlling the biomuse with

brain waves — as opposed to using
muscle movement — will be con
siderably more difficult, Lusted
said, because people will have to
learn to control their thoughts.
Although the biomuse is not at
the point of making music from

emotions, Lusted predicted that
in the future the biomuse might
allow brain researchers to probe
into human thought.
"This will be the technology of
the '905," Lusted said. "This is
just the beginning."
