# Researchers hope to lick away opposition to drugged lollies

Narcotics-laced lollipops can be used to
sedate surgery-bound childern, some Stan
ford doctors say, pointing out that depriving
young patients of these lollipops would be
like taking candy from a baby.
Dr. Lawrence Feld, acting assistant pro
fessor of anesthesia who headed a study
of children entering surgery, presented find
ings yesterday at an anesthesiology confer
ence in Florida that might sedate lollipop
opponents. He reported that giving lollipops
coated with the drug fentanyl to children
before an operation can reduce anxiety,
increase sedation and ease the separation
from parents.
Pre-operative sedatives are generally
given by injection, but children don't fancy
the looks — or the pain — of long needles.
"[Needles) scare the bejeezes out of cer
tain small little kids," said Bill Grigg, a
public affairs officer of the Food and Drug
Administration.
To ease fears of children and their par
ents, doctors have been searching to develop
new ways to administer narcotics to
children before surgery.
Despite the wishes of many parents, a
small group of people say they would like
to keep Feld and other doctors out of the
candy business because they fear children
will equate drugs with candy.
Chief among the critics is Dr. Sidney
Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health
Research Group, an organization that
wrote a letter last month to the FDA.
"The lacing of lollipops with fentanyl not
only sends out a dangerous message about
medicines," Wolfe and two colleagues wrote
in the letter, "It is of dubious clinical need
or safety and is a category of drug that is
of such addictive potential that its more
widespread dissemination and publicity
may pose a significant threat to drug en
forcement."
Most doctors, however, discount the ob
jections. As he presented evidence favoring
lollipop use, Feld downplayed Wolfe's
protests at a meeting of the International
Anesthesia Research Society yesterday in
Orlando, Fla.
According to Dr. Michael Champeau,
clinical assistant professor of anesthesia

Drug-laced lollipops given
to children before an opera
tion can increase sedation
and reduce anxiety.

and coauthor of the report with Feld, the
lollipops don't even look much like ordinary
lollipops that kids could associate with
candy. The lollipops look more like "purple,
grape-flavored suppositories on a stick,"
Champeau said.
As did other proponents of the lollipop,
Champeau passed off objections to the lol
lipop use. "I see it as a tempest in a tea
pot," Champeau said.
Tempest or not, the issue of giving
children sedatives to calm them before op
erations has been given considerable atten
tion in the past few years as doctors try
to ease the trauma of surgery. Although
children always receive anesthesia for sur
gery, premedication with sedatives has be
come increasingly popular in hospitals
despite a lack of clear evidence whether it
works.
"The whole issue of premedication is un
clear," Champeau said.
According to Champeau, however,
children require less pain medicine if they
are given premedication of a sedative.
These findings by the Stanford research
team and several other groups around the
nation have led doctors to develop new
ways to make the medicine go down easier.
Doctors, Feld concluded, have been test
ing whether sedatives can be mixed in
"cocktails" made of apple juice or another
drink. The problem with the "cocktail"
method is that patients are supposed to
have empty stomachs when they enter sur
gery. Lollipops — which do not significantly
add fluid to the stomach — are therefore
a most attractive option for anes
thesiologists.
Anesta Corp. is developing the lollipop,
but the company has not yet sent a proposal
to the FDA to market the idea. FDA ap
proval could take anywhere from three
months to three or four years, according
to Grigg.
