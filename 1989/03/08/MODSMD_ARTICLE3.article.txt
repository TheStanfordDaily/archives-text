# University cat traps vandalized
## 
### Maryellen Driscoll Staff writer 
Since last week a few dozen wild
cat traps set around the Stanford
Medical Center and Stanford Sta
dium have been kicked over,
emptied of food, twisted and
stomped.
Although Stanford hns been be
set by numerous animal rights
protesters in recent years, no one
has stepped forward to claim re
sponsibility for the trap mauling,
which has hindered University ef
forts to control the local wild
feline population. The University
does not suspect any persons or
groups, nor does it intend to call

in the police, said Peter Sidebot
tom of the Office of Public Affairs.
University officials met yester
day with members of the Stanford
Cat Network, a group advocating
humane trapping of the wild cats,
to evaluate the program, which
began Feb. 27.
Carole Miller, a manager in the
Electrical Engineering Depart
ment and member of the Cat Net
work, said yesterday that she did
not know of anyone in the net
work involved in the cat trap
sabotage.
"It's an emotional response that
I can understand, but I don't con
done it and our group does not
advocate it," Miller said. "The

people that are sabotaging these
traps really aren't helping. . . . It's
not humane in terms of the wel
fare of the cats."
Miller said the Cat Network will
continue to meet with the Uni
versity to assure that the trap
pings remain humane and to dis
cuss ways to make people — van
dals in particular — aware of this.
Miller said that the "humane
trapping" has been going
smoothly and"the University and
Crane (a pest control company)
are making an effort to be respon
sible about this."
Said Sidebottom, "We think
part of the problem is that word
hasn't gotten out about this cat
program." People can save their
local wild cats if they are willing
to care for them and register
them, said Sidebottom, who has
been coordinating a registration
program with the Cat Network.
According to an article in yes

terday's Times Tribune, 19 cats
and a few other wild animals have
been caught in traps set around
Campus Drive.
Trapped cats have been picked
up daily by Santa Clara County
animal control officers and
brought to the county's animal
shelter. Tagged and registered
cats that happen to be caught in
a trap are released immediately
on campus.
