# 'Kissing disease' appears even on Stanford campus
## 
### Lauren Friedly Staff writer 
Based on students' grumbling about
the lack of dating at Stanford, you
wouldn't think mono, the dreaded "kis
sing disease," could spread on campus.
But don't kid yourself.

Mono may be spread through kissing,
but despite popular opinion, the virus
causing mono is not highly contagious.
Studies have shown that roommates of
mono sufferers rarely get the disease
because it is not very contagious.
Kissing and other close personal con
tact, such as sharing eating utensils with
an infected person, can lead to trans
mission of the disease.
Infectious mono, known in the med
ical literature as mononucleosis, can be
caused by several different organisms.
More than 95 percent of mono cases on
college campuses are caused by the
Epstein-Barr virus, a virus in the family
of herpes viruses.
According to the American College
Health Association, a majority of cases
are probably transmitted by intimate
contact with a normal, healthy people
who are not symptomatically sick, but
are shedding the virus. In fact, about
15 percent of normal, healthy adults
shed the virus.
The incubation period, the time from
contact with the virus until sickness
begins, averages 25 days. Though it is
unclear, the virus is probably shed be
ginning in the second week of illness,
and may continue for up to 18 months,
long after the period of illness is over.
The severity as well as the symptoms
of mono vary from person to person.
For some people the disease is so mild

it passes unnoticed, others can be
bedridden for weeks.
The symptoms of mono may include
sore throat, extreme fatigue for several
days, enlarged lymph nodes, fever, rash,
headache and, in relatively few cases,
jaundice and anemia. The disease may
also affect the spleen and liver. According
to the American College Health Associ
ation, 99 percent of mono sufferers have
enlarged glands readily felt in the neck.
The majority of sufferers will experi
ence some amount of fatigue for one to
four weeks.
Unfortunately, no specific medications
can cure mono or shorten its course.
Medications such as aspirin, however,
may ease some of the symptoms.
The disease is self-limited and usually
runs its course in one to four weeks
and has no after effects.
To help avoid getting mono, get plenty
of rest. Rest is also crucial once the
disease strikes. Do not push yourself
beyond your limit and rest whenever
you feel tired.
However, "babying" yourself by
staying in bed for excessively long peri
ods may allow for further weakening.
Generous fluid intake may help relieve
some mono symptoms and is especially
important when a fever hits.
Because minor changes often occur in
the liver during the acute stages of
mono, many people have jumped to the
conclusion that alcohol may be bad for
the liver for months afterwards. How
ever, the American College Health As
sociation states that after recovery, a
mono sufferer has no special suscep
tibility to alcohol's effects.
Only in some cases of mono-related
jaundice, which occurs in less than five
percent of the patients, is it recom
mended to avoid alcohol for as much as
a year after the illness.
Mono rarely, if ever, recurs. Once an
individual has had mono there is per
manent protection against becoming
reinfected with the virus.
