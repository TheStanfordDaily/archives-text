## Card nine downs Broncos Tokyo's Keio University visits Sunken for exhibition 
### Bruce Sarkisian Senior staff writer 
The rain held off just long
enough yesterday for the Stanford
baseball team to hand Santa Clara
its first defeat in 11 games at
Buck Shaw Stadium.

Baseball
Cardinal 6, Broncos 4

The Cardinal snapped its own
three-game losing streak with the
6-4 win against the Broncos and
improved its record to 11-13 while
Santa Clara fell to 15-7. The
batsmen avenged their 3-2
opening-day loss, a four-hour mar
athon at Buck Shaw that set the
hard-luck tone for Stanford's
season so far.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
was extremely pleased with the
victory. "It was a solid win. They
are 10-0 here and a very good
team," he said.
Something in the air was dif
ferent yesterday as Stanford took
its warmups. The whole team
seemed more relaxed and went
through its pregame paces even
more crisply than usual. The Car
dinal had a winning gleam in its
eye.
But when the game began,
things started to look all too
familiar as Stanford fell behind
early. In the bottom of the first
starter Brian Keyser gave up a
leadoff walk to Ed Giovanola who
then scored on an RBI single by
UC-Santa Barbara transfer Craig
Middlekauf. Stanford was playing
catch-up again.
Keyser did not look sharp
through the first two innings as
he gave up three hits and a walk,

but only gave up one run thanks
to good defense by left fielder
Brian Johnson and shortstop
Roger Burnett, who got the start
yesterday as Troy Paulsen was
given the day off for the first time
in 92 games.
But after his initial faltering,
Keyser found his curve ball and
held the Broncos scoreless until
the sixth. Keyser's curve effec
tively set up his fastball for six
strikeouts.
With the score tied at 1-1 in
the sixth, Keyser gave up a two
run frozen-rope homer to catcher
Troy Buckley that got over the
left field fence faster than John
Tower can say "bottoms up."
After giving up two more hits,
Marquess pulled Keyser in favor
of Mark Carper, who shut the
door on the Broncos by striking
out consecutive batters to end the
inning.
Marquess was extremely

pleased with the pitching, espe
cially since Keyser had been un
able to get past the fifth inning
before yesterday."He pitched ex
tremely well as did Carper. You
have to give them both credit for
hard work," Marquess said.
In the top of the seventh, the
Cardinal did something it has
rarely done this season — score
a lot of runs. Stanford sent all
nine men to the plate for only the
second time this season.
Designated hitter David
Holbrook started things off with
a single to left and was balked to
second by pitcher Jim Flynn.
Then Johnson, who has been one
of the Cardinal's most consistent
hitters over the past eight games,
singled Holbrook home. After Da
vid McCarty singled, Flynn was
relieved by Larry Donahe.
But Donahe, who had stopped

the Cardinal cold earlier in the
season, was unable to contain
Stanford's rally. Eric Cox put the
Cardinal ahead for good with a
line-drive single to center which
was mishandled by Bruce Powers
allowing both Johnson and
McCarty to score. Frank Carey
singled before Donahe got the sec
ond out of the inning, a groundout
by Steve Solomon which scored
Cox.
And Stanford wasn't done yet.
Paul Carey laced a double to right

which scored Frank Carey and
then advanced on a wild pitch by
Donahe which was thrown behind
Tim Griffin. The Cardinal bench
had to be reprimanded by the
third-base umpire after protesting
a little too vigorously that Donahe
was trying to hit Griffin, but Grif
fin ended the fireworks by flying
out to second to end the inning.
In their post-game meeting,
Marquess told his players to "en
joy it." No doubt they will.

Stanford's six hits in the seventh
inning were the most ever for the
team in a single inning so far this year.

starter Brian Keyser gave up a
leadoff walk to Ed Giovanola who
then scored on an RBI single by
UC-Santa Barbara transfer Craig
Middlekauf. Stanford was playing
catch-up again.
Keyser did not look sharp
through the first two innings as
he gave up three hits and a walk,

but only gave up one run thanks
to good defense by left fielder
Brian Johnson and shortstop
Roger Burnett, who got the start
yesterday as Troy Paulsen was
given the day off for the first time
in 92 games.
But after his initial faltering,
Keyser found his curve ball and
held the Broncos scoreless until
the sixth. Keyser's curve effec
tively set up his fastball for six
strikeouts.
With the score tied at 1-1 in
the sixth, Keyser gave up a two
run frozen-rope homer to catcher
Troy Buckley that got over the
left field fence faster than John
Tower can say "bottoms up."
After giving up two more hits,
Marquess pulled Keyser in favor
of Mark Carper, who shut the
door on the Broncos by striking
out consecutive batters to end the
inning.
Marquess was extremely

pleased with the pitching, espe
cially since Keyser had been un
able to get past the fifth inning
before yesterday."He pitched ex
tremely well as did Carper. You
have to give them both credit for
hard work," Marquess said.
In the top of the seventh, the
Cardinal did something it has
rarely done this season — score
a lot of runs. Stanford sent all
nine men to the plate for only the
second time this season.
Designated hitter David
Holbrook started things off with
a single to left and was balked to
second by pitcher Jim Flynn.
Then Johnson, who has been one
of the Cardinal's most consistent
hitters over the past eight games,
singled Holbrook home. After Da
vid McCarty singled, Flynn was
relieved by Larry Donahe.
But Donahe, who had stopped

the Cardinal cold earlier in the
season, was unable to contain
Stanford's rally. Eric Cox put the
Cardinal ahead for good with a
line-drive single to center which
was mishandled by Bruce Powers
allowing both Johnson and
McCarty to score. Frank Carey
singled before Donahe got the sec
ond out of the inning, a groundout
by Steve Solomon which scored
Cox.
And Stanford wasn't done yet.
Paul Carey laced a double to right

which scored Frank Carey and
then advanced on a wild pitch by
Donahe which was thrown behind
Tim Griffin. The Cardinal bench
had to be reprimanded by the
third-base umpire after protesting
a little too vigorously that Donahe
was trying to hit Griffin, but Grif
fin ended the fireworks by flying
out to second to end the inning.
In their post-game meeting,
Marquess told his players to "en
joy it." No doubt they will.
Card Notes
Stanford's six hits in the seventh
inning were the most ever for the
team in a single inning so far this year.
