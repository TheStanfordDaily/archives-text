# The
						best of the best: All-America basketball players
## 
### 
When the award honoring college
basketball's player of the year is
handed out, the recipient will be
one of three men: Sean Elliott of Arizona,
Danny Ferry of Duke or Stacey King of
Oklahoma.
The three of them are terrific players
on top-10 teams â€” any of them would
be an excellent choice. Unfortunately,
none of them are my choice.
From where I'm standing, you see, the
best player in the nation this year is
Hank Gathers of Loyola Marymount.
You know Gathers (Hank "The Bank"
to his buddies), he's leading the nation
in scoring and rebounding.
Yeah, yeah, I know what you're think
ing. "LMU scores 115 points every game.
Of course Gathers is going to post big
numbers."
Of course nothing. The Associated
Press clearly states in the criteria for
their player-of-the-year award that the
"award is intended to signify the best
college basketball player in the nation,
based on individual performance. This is
as opposed to a most valuable player
award, where value to the team is of
more importance."
(Remarkably, despite inventing the
rules itself, AP hasn't listed Gathers
among the 10 finalists for their award).
It seems to me that becoming only the
second player ever (Wichita State alum
Xavier McDaniel is the other) to lead the

country in scoring and rebounding
qualifies as the top individual perform
ance. It shouldn't matter that Gathers
isn't taking the Lions to the heights that
Elliott lifts the Wildcats or that King
lifts the Sooners.
In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, I
might add that Gathers is shooting 65
percent from the field. And, being that
he's the entire inside game for the
"bombs-away" Lions, the man is a victim
of constant double- and triple-teaming
while making 65 percent of his shots.
Sean, Danny, Stacey ... I love 'ya (well
actually Sean, I hate you because you
play for Arizona and I hate you, Danny,
because you're with Duke) but Hank's
my guy this year. If you've seen him play
live (like I have twice) you'd see how
hard he works and just how good he is.
If that's not enough grist for the men
tal mill, how about this: Rogo's
Thinking-Man's All-America team.
These are some of the best players in
the country (who are not Hank Gathers)
who may or may not be on more tradi
tional All-America teams.
Stacey King, who I adore, is the best
offensive center, and one of the most
consistent threats at any position, in the
land. He is also one of the country's best
rebounders. So, for this thinking-man's
team, I'll pick Pervis Ellison as the All-
America center.

Louisville Coach Denny Crum has de
signed an offense that doesn't feature
Ellison. Still "Never Nervous" Pervis has
quietly put together one of the best all
around seasons of anyone.
Scoring, rebounding and blocking
shots, Ellison does everything Crum asks
of him and more. He leads by example
and gives the Cardinals, arguably the
team of the '80s, their only chance to
make yet another Final Four appearance.
Elliott's play is nothing short of awe
inspiring. At 6-foot-8 he can play any of
four positions and is therefore the "sixth
man" on this All-America squad.
While there will never be another Ear
vin Johnson, Sean Elliott has the poten
tial to be a "Magic-like" player.
Post up the smaller players guarding
him? Fine, he's got great inside moves.
Need a ballhandler to beat the opposi
tion's press? Easy, the 6-8 Elliott handles

the rock as well as anyone in college
hoops. Looking for someone to complete
the fast break? Dish it to Sean, he's the
one flying down on the wing at warp
speed.
Down by three with time running out?
Once again, Elliott's your answer. He'll
bury a trey with a defender's hand in
his face (See Duke vs. Arizona a couple
weeks back).
Suffice it to say: I never watch Elliott
play without him doing something that
blows my mind.
There's another player who has that
same mind-boggling effect on me when
I see him. The best thing about him is
that he plays nearby, in Maples Pavilion.
Needless to say, that man is Todd Lichti,
the shooting guard on my All-America
team.
Penetrating to the hoop, burying the
jumper, swishing home another free
throw or pulling down that key rebound,
Lichti has time and again been the key
cog in the 24-5 machine known as the
Stanford Cardinal.
A sure-fire first-round draft pick, the
greatest player in Stanford history has
provided more thrills to the Cardinal
faithful than any one man should
seemingly be able. And he's done it with
a sense of humility and selflessness so
rare among big-time athletes. Thanks for
four amazing years, Todd.
The forwards are both having sensa

tional seasons for top-notch teams and
are also both certain to be left off count
less All-America teams. At the strong
forward spot, super-scorer and
rebounder-deluxe Lionel Simmons of La
Salle and, at the small forward position,
Michigan's turn-out-the-lights three-man
Glen Rice.
Simmons, a junior, will be my player
of the year 12 months from now if he
doesn't turn pro. When Simmons led his
team to the NIT finals as a freshman
you'd think some people would've begun
to notice this guy.
Nope. Finally, this season Sports Il
lustrated made him the lead story on the
college basketball page several weeks ago.
But it's still hard to find anyone outside
of Philadelphia who knows him from
Lionel Jefferson, George and Louise's
son.
Shouldering the load for the Explorers,
Simmons is second in the nation in
scoring and fifth in rebounding. This
despite being only 6-6 and possessing
solid but unspectacular leaping ability.
Instead, Simmons has superb fundamen
tals and an excellent basketball mind.
Rice's lithe 6-7 frame screams "NBA
small forward" and he's already playing
like one for the Wolverines. Chipping in
points at a 27.6 clip and grabbing a solid
7.4 rebounds, Rice is the go-to guy for
