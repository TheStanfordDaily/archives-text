# Golf struggles in Sacramento
## 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
Playing with what one Stanford
player called its "A-minus" squad,
the Cardinal men's golf team had
a bad first day and had to settle
for a disappointing eighth place
in the Sacramento State Invita
tional.
With Stanford's top three gol
fers skipping the minor 2-day con
test, the team struggled to save
itself after a disastrous first two
rounds that left the Cardinal 11th
out of 13 teams.
A final round 305 (third best
on the day) soothed the wounds
a bit as the individual round
average shed three shots.
Individually, Mark Funseth cel
ebrated playing his first tourna
ment in four months by shooting
a three-round total of 231 to lead
Stanford. Senior Brad Geer was
right behind Funseth with a 233
and Brad Benbrook had a 237.
Second-year coach Tim Baldwin
set out to learn what he could
about the fourth through sixth
spots on the team and to give
players such as Chris Barbour and
Steve White an opportunity to
play for the competitive squad.
What he saw was the reemergence
of Funseth as a top player.
"He played very well today,"
Goodwin said. "And it was nice
to see him do that. He played No.
1 here all last year and most of
the year before, but he's had a
tough time this year." Funseth
had missed qualifying for the last

several Stanford contests.
Despite Funseth's final round
74 on the tough Rancho Murieta
course on which no Stanford
player had ever played, the Car
dinal's effort on the whole was
somewhat lackluster.
"We didn't play as well as we
had anticipated, partially due the
fact we had never seen the courses
before, and they were very diffi
cult. But it was a tournament
where we should have finished in
the top three teams, and we
played pretty badly," said Bar
bour, a junior who posted a three
round total of 237 in only his
second collegiate tournament.
The University of San Fran
cisco overtook Division 111 na
tional champion Cal State-
Stanislaus to win the tournament
by a stroke, 896 to 897. Washing
ton State escaped the frosty North
to come in third with a 906.
Overconfidence may have been
a factor in this tournament, with
many of the highly-ranked teams
away at the Border Olympics
tournament in Texas. But the Car
dinal were aware that they would
be tested without top players Don
Christensen, Christian Cevaer and
Josh Zander.
Stanford had not done very well
in their last tournament, and
there was some competition in
Sacramento.
"I don't think we were overcon
fident because our coach told us
there were a couple teams there

who were really good but were
from smaller divisions," Barbour
said. "Other teams had more ex
perience on the (Rancho Murieta)
golf course than we did. I don't
think we concentrated enough —
perhaps we were intimidated by
the golf course."
" [Monday 1 I was disappointed,
because we have some guys who
can play a little bit of golf, and
we just didn't play that well," said
Goodwin on Tuesday. "But that
happens in golf, and today, on a

course where they'd never been
before, they played real well. So
the two days kind of neutralized
each other.
"And the good that came out
of it was that they played well as
a team, and Funseth individually
is coming back. He's key — when
you've got a guy who was No. 1
all last year not in the lineup,
that's tough. He should be in
there."
The Cardinal will again use a
patchwork lineup for an exhibi
tion against the Chinese National
team this weekend and then will
tackle exams and resume tourna
ment play April 7-9 at the Music
City Invitational in Nashville.
