## Synchro wins regionals 
### Libby Feil Staff writer 
The Stanford synchronized
swimming team "absolutely
clobbered the competition" in
their regional meet at de-
Guerre Pool last Saturday, said
Asst. Coach Andy Maisel,
taking first in every event and
qualifying easily for nationals
next week. The swimmers
faced perennial rivals Califor
nia and UC-Davis as well as
other schools from the entire
western region of the country.
In the compulsory figures
events, Stanford pulled off a
coup of sorts. The Cardinal
swept the first seven places in
the senior figures, with trans
fer student Karen Madsen
taking first (and setting a new
team record in the process) and
Melinda Downey and Dee
Cohen in second and third.
Stanford freshmen Jenny
Coleman and Rekha Rao placed
first and second in the junior
figures. Lisa Lipschitz finished
the Cardinal shutout by win
ning first in the novice figures.
The remaining events in the
program were the team, trio,
duet and solo routines, which
are creatively set to music. In

the team division the victorious
swimmers were Debbie Brear,
Ginny Cohn, Amy Brown, Mi
chelle Ghert, Cohen, Madsen
and Downey. Stanford swim
mers placed first and second
in the trio event, with Brear,
Cohn and Brown in first place.
Stanford won first and sec
ond in the duet routine as well;
Cohen and Madsen swam their
way into first place. Cardinal
swimmers Madsen and Downey
al3o won first and second in
the solo competition.
Now the synchro team is
looking forward to nationals in
Orlando beginning on March
15. For the last two years the
team has placed second at the
national level to Ohio State, a
school with synchro as a varsity
sport.
