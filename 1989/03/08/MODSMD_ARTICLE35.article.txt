## Synchro wins regionals 
### Libby Feil Staff writer 
The Stanford synchronized
swimming team "absolutely
clobbered the competition" in
their regional meet at de-
Guerre Pool last Saturday, said
Asst. Coach Andy Maisel,
taking first in every event and
qualifying easily for nationals
next week. The swimmers
faced perennial rivals Califor
nia and UC-Davis as well as
other schools from the entire
western region of the country.
In the compulsory figures
events, Stanford pulled off a
coup of sorts. The Cardinal
swept the first seven places in
the senior figures, with trans
fer student Karen Madsen
taking first (and setting a new
team record in the process) and
Melinda Downey and Dee
Cohen in second and third.
Stanford freshmen Jenny
Coleman and Rekha Rao placed
first and second in the junior
figures. Lisa Lipschitz finished
the Cardinal shutout by win
ning first in the novice figures.
The remaining events in the
program were the team, trio,
duet and solo routines, which
are creatively set to music. In

the team division the victorious
swimmers were Debbie Brear,
Ginny Cohn, Amy Brown, Mi
chelle Ghert, Cohen, Madsen
and Downey. Stanford swim
mers placed first and second
in the trio event, with Brear,
Cohn and Brown in first place.
Stanford won first and sec
ond in the duet routine as well;
Cohen and Madsen swam their
way into first place. Cardinal
swimmers Madsen and Downey
al3o won first and second in
the solo competition.
Now the synchro team is
looking forward to nationals in
Orlando beginning on March
15. For the last two years the
team has placed second at the
national level to Ohio State, a
school with synchro as a varsity
sport.
Women's lacrosse
downs UC-Irvine
The women's lacrosse team
plaved at UC-Davis last week
end and returned with a vic
tory. The team competed well
against the Aggies to end up
with an 11-2 win.
"We had superior play because
they're a relatively new team,"
Co-Captain Caroline Clevenger
modestly reported. Special credit
goes to attack wing Molly Cum
mings, who "played really well,"
according to Clevenger.
Clevenger also attributes the
team's success to the coaching
staff, particularly new Assistant
Coach Chris Fleming.
Stanford will be hosting the
Western States Tournament on
April 7 and 8. 12 teams will be
competing from the West Coast
and Colorado. "We hope to do
really well," said Clevenger.
Men's lacrosse wins
match last weekend
Men's lacrosse traveled to
southern California last weekend
to face two tough opponents and
came back with mixed results.
Stanford lost to UC-Santa Bar
bara 15-9 but then won against
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo 18-6.

The lacrosse players "started
out playing well" in their match
aginst Santa Barbara, according
to team member Jay Daniel.
In fact, said player John
Jibilian, "It was a really close
game until the last five minutes
of the fourth quarter." Then
events got out of hand for the
Cardinal and the tables turned to
end up in the Gauchos' favor. Cap
tains Robert Lamkin and Derek
Kober, as well as player Scott
Swid, each scored several goals
and assists.
Cardinal goalie Dan Garza also
"had a really good game" in his
first match as a starter, according
to Jibilian.
The Cardinal fared better in its
match against San Luis Obispo.
"We shut them out to one goal
in the first half," said Jibilian.
As Daniel more enthusiastically
summarized the game, "We
trounced 'em."
Lamkin, Kober and Swid all
scored goals and assists and Greg
Fowlkes and Jim Walter also
scored one goal each. "We're on
a one-game winning streak," said
Daniel.

Water polo competes
in weekend tourney
The women's water polo team
played a tournament at UC-Davis
last weekend, competing in four
games and winning one. Com
bined with its results from a tour
nament two weekends ago at Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo, the team's
record is now 4-4.
The polo players came up
against San Diego State first. The
Cardinal emerged victorious,
beating the Aztecs 5-4. In their
next match, the Stanford women
found themselves up against San
Luis Obispo. The game was evenly
matched, "one of those games that
depends on when the buzzer
blows," reported Captain Andrea
Milano.
The team's next two games,
against California and UC-Irvine,
went well but the Cardinal lost
each by two points.
"The whole team is really new
to the sport, but they're improv
ing markedly," said Milano.
Goalkeeper Shannon Doolittle
and players Vivian Albritton and
Martha Cocke were crucial to the
team's efforts.
