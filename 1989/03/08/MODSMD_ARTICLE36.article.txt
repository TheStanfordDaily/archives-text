# Redshirt MacMurdo looks forward to joining hoops lineup
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the second
in a three-part series on the Stan
ford women's basketball team's
freshman class.

Reading freshman forward
Chris MacMurdo's list of achieve
ments in high school is simulta
neously humbling and awe
inspiring:
• She graduated first in a class
of 300 with a 4.0 GPA;
• She was named Converse Na
tional High School Player of the
Year;
• She led her South Aiken High
School team to an undefeated 31-
win season, the South Carolina
state title and a No. 21 national
ranking by USA Today;
• She was named one of USA
Today's Top 10 high school
players and one of Dick Vitale's
Top Players of the South, as well
as a two-time All-American;
• She was a state champion in
track, winning the 800 meters
each of her four years and the
1,600 meters once;
• And, if all that were not
enough, she was class president
for all four years of high school.
Overachieving and competition
have become MacMurdo's calling
cards. The 6-foot freshman
radiates self-confidence without
the side effect of arrogance, en
dearing and inspiring anyone she
encounters on and off the court.
"Chris is competitve in every
area," Stanford Coach Tara Van-
Derveer noted. "If she's a tenth
of a point away from the next
grade, she's going to want to go
check that out. She always wants

to be moving up."
Her mobility at Stanford, how
ever, has been literally and figura
tively hampered by iryury. A rup
tured disk in her back has kept
her off the court for most of the
regular season, forcing her to red
shirt when she would definitely
play. Though her team is doing
well, ranked fourth nationally,
misfortune has deprived the Car
dinal of its toughest competitor.
For many freshmen, the injury
would make an already-difficult
transistion that much more un
bearable. Moving from a small
South Carolina town to a large
university 3,000 miles from home,
MacMurdo's adjustments have
been numerous without her afflic
tion, but even harder with the
injury.
Rather than languish, however,
MacMurdo has flourished.
"If anything, she sits back in
her situation and says, 'Man, I'm
going to really er\joy playing,' "
VanDerveer observed. "When she
sees people complain about prac
tice or pout, she says, That's not
going to be me.'
"I said, 'I'm going to remind
you'; she said, 'You're not going
to have to.' She's very mature,
and I think right now she's behind
the team and very, very support
ive, but it's very hard for her to
not play."
When she did see action at the
start of the season, MacMurdo
proved to be a tough small for
ward. With her speed, agility and
vertical leap meshing well with a
solid shot, she was an offensive
threat.
But her biggest strength is
rebounding. Able to leap and grip
the rim with both hands, Mac-

Murdo towers above opponents
when she hits the boards.
Put the talents together and the
result is an athlete who will im-
mediately contribute upon her
return to active duty.

"As well as we're running, she'll
help us run better," VanDerveer
predicted. "She'll help our
rebounding problem — she was
one of our best rebounders in
practice before her back iryury.

She doesn't care who's in her way
— she'll just grab the ball."
The aggressive play stems from
her experiences in the South. As
evidenced by the concentration of
collegiate powerhouses south of
the Mason-Dixon Line — namely
Auburn, Tennessee and Louisiana
Tech, the top three teams in the
nation — basketball is serious and
competitive in MacMurdo's native
area, yielding physical contests
even at the high school level.
In this environment, Mac-
Murdo's talent germinated. From
the first time she picked up a ball
in her primary school years, bas
ketball seemed perfectly suited to
her trailblazing spirit.
"I started in church league,"
MacMurdo explained. "I saw my
brother playing and I said, 'Well,
anything he can do I can do bet
ter.' I just went out and tried it,
and it seemed to be something
that came naturally to me.
"I enjoy it: the thrill of being
on the edge, maybe losing and
maybe winning, pulling it out at
the end. I just love competition
in anything. But I think I like
competition better for a team as
a whole, competing against an
other team."
For VanDerveer, this blend of
individual perseverence and sup
portive attitude in a highly skilled
player was exactly what she
sought. Stanford was already a
team fortified with star-caliber
talent after two consecutive No.
1 national recruiting classes, so
attitude played an equal role with
ability in recruiting decisions.
The biggest decision, however,
lay in MacMurdo's hands. The
touted prospect was recruited by
many schools, including colleges

close to home. Coming from a
small town where she had devel
oped firm roots, proximity was a
strongly appealing trait, as she
would not need to venture from
the comfortable confines of her
native area if she remained in the
South.
But complacency has never been
MacMurdo's style, so it was with
a sense of challenge that she
defied local opinion and ventured
westward.
"It was a pretty difficult deci
sion at the end," MacMurdo
remembered. "I had it down to
between Vanderbilt, North
Carolina and here (Stanford). Bas
ically, the reasons I wanted to go
to North Carolina and Vanderbilt
was because they were closer to
home, and people that I cared
about could have come and seen
me play.
"But then when I thought about
it, I figured the biggest challenge
I could get would be out here,
where I was alone and could really
find out about my self, what I
was made of."
Now, with the setback of injury
soon to be alleviated by surgery,
MacMurdo faces a series of new
trials. Rehabilitation and return
ing to top form will consume
much of her summer and will tax
her determination to the fullest.
Then comes the competition for
playing time and for a starting
role on next year's team....
But competition is what Mac-
Murdo is made of. U I would hate
to be the girl guarding her in
practice every day next year,"
VanDerveer said. "She is going to
be playing with a vengence."

But her biggest strength is
rebounding. Able to leap and grip
the rim with both hands, Mac-

Murdo towers above opponents
when she hits the boards.
Put the talents together and the
result is an athlete who will im-
mediately contribute upon her
return to active duty.

"As well as we're running, she'll
help us run better," VanDerveer
predicted. "She'll help our
rebounding problem — she was
one of our best rebounders in
practice before her back iryury.

She doesn't care who's in her way
— she'll just grab the ball."
The aggressive play stems from
her experiences in the South. As
evidenced by the concentration of
collegiate powerhouses south of
the Mason-Dixon Line — namely
Auburn, Tennessee and Louisiana
Tech, the top three teams in the
nation — basketball is serious and
competitive in MacMurdo's native
area, yielding physical contests
even at the high school level.
In this environment, Mac-
Murdo's talent germinated. From
the first time she picked up a ball
in her primary school years, bas
ketball seemed perfectly suited to
her trailblazing spirit.
"I started in church league,"
MacMurdo explained. "I saw my
brother playing and I said, 'Well,
anything he can do I can do bet
ter.' I just went out and tried it,
and it seemed to be something
that came naturally to me.
"I enjoy it: the thrill of being
on the edge, maybe losing and
maybe winning, pulling it out at
the end. I just love competition
in anything. But I think I like
competition better for a team as
a whole, competing against an
other team."
For VanDerveer, this blend of
individual perseverence and sup
portive attitude in a highly skilled
player was exactly what she
sought. Stanford was already a
team fortified with star-caliber
talent after two consecutive No.
1 national recruiting classes, so
attitude played an equal role with
ability in recruiting decisions.
The biggest decision, however,
lay in MacMurdo's hands. The
touted prospect was recruited by
many schools, including colleges

close to home. Coming from a
small town where she had devel
oped firm roots, proximity was a
strongly appealing trait, as she
would not need to venture from
the comfortable confines of her
native area if she remained in the
South.
But complacency has never been
MacMurdo's style, so it was with
a sense of challenge that she
defied local opinion and ventured
westward.
"It was a pretty difficult deci
sion at the end," MacMurdo
remembered. "I had it down to
between Vanderbilt, North
Carolina and here (Stanford). Bas
ically, the reasons I wanted to go
to North Carolina and Vanderbilt
was because they were closer to
home, and people that I cared
about could have come and seen
me play.
"But then when I thought about
it, I figured the biggest challenge
I could get would be out here,
where I was alone and could really
find out about my self, what I
was made of."
Now, with the setback of injury
soon to be alleviated by surgery,
MacMurdo faces a series of new
trials. Rehabilitation and return
ing to top form will consume
much of her summer and will tax
her determination to the fullest.
Then comes the competition for
playing time and for a starting
role on next year's team....
But competition is what Mac-
Murdo is made of. U I would hate
to be the girl guarding her in
practice every day next year,"
VanDerveer said. "She is going to
be playing with a vengence."

Though she is redshlrtlng this year due to injury, former high-school
Ail-American Chris MacMurdo promises to be a key player for the
Cardinal in the future.
Editor's note: This is the second
in a three-part series on the Stan
ford women's basketball team's
freshman class.

Reading freshman forward
Chris MacMurdo's list of achieve
ments in high school is simulta
neously humbling and awe
inspiring:
• She graduated first in a class
of 300 with a 4.0 GPA;
• She was named Converse Na
tional High School Player of the
Year;
• She led her South Aiken High
School team to an undefeated 31-
win season, the South Carolina
state title and a No. 21 national
ranking by USA Today;
• She was named one of USA
Today's Top 10 high school
players and one of Dick Vitale's
Top Players of the South, as well
as a two-time All-American;
• She was a state champion in
track, winning the 800 meters
each of her four years and the
1,600 meters once;
• And, if all that were not
enough, she was class president
for all four years of high school.
Overachieving and competition
have become MacMurdo's calling
cards. The 6-foot freshman
radiates self-confidence without
the side effect of arrogance, en
dearing and inspiring anyone she
encounters on and off the court.
"Chris is competitve in every
area," Stanford Coach Tara Van-
Derveer noted. "If she's a tenth
of a point away from the next
grade, she's going to want to go
check that out. She always wants

to be moving up."
Her mobility at Stanford, how
ever, has been literally and figura
tively hampered by iryury. A rup
tured disk in her back has kept
her off the court for most of the
regular season, forcing her to red
shirt when she would definitely
play. Though her team is doing
well, ranked fourth nationally,
misfortune has deprived the Car
dinal of its toughest competitor.
For many freshmen, the injury
would make an already-difficult
transistion that much more un
bearable. Moving from a small
South Carolina town to a large
university 3,000 miles from home,
MacMurdo's adjustments have
been numerous without her afflic
tion, but even harder with the
injury.
Rather than languish, however,
MacMurdo has flourished.
"If anything, she sits back in
her situation and says, 'Man, I'm
going to really er\joy playing,' "
VanDerveer observed. "When she
sees people complain about prac
tice or pout, she says, That's not
going to be me.'
"I said, 'I'm going to remind
you'; she said, 'You're not going
to have to.' She's very mature,
and I think right now she's behind
the team and very, very support
ive, but it's very hard for her to
not play."
When she did see action at the
start of the season, MacMurdo
proved to be a tough small for
ward. With her speed, agility and
vertical leap meshing well with a
solid shot, she was an offensive
threat.
But her biggest strength is
rebounding. Able to leap and grip
the rim with both hands, Mac-

Murdo towers above opponents
when she hits the boards.
Put the talents together and the
result is an athlete who will im-
mediately contribute upon her
