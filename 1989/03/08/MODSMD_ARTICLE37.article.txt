"That's one of the neat things
about sports â€” anything can hap
pen."
So said Stanford men's volley
ball Coach Fred Sturm yesterday
upon learning his squad is ranked
No. 1 in the nation in the weekly
AVCA/Tachikara Poll that came
out yesterday.
The top ranking, the first ever
for the Cardinal squad, came after
previous No. 1 UCLA was upset
by USC Saturday. Meanwhile,
Stanford ran its winning streak
to nine matches by defeating UC-
Santa Barbara, UC-Irvine and

Pepperdine at Maples Pavilion.
The Cardinal faces California's
club team at Maples today at 7:30
p.m.
"I think it's a nice honor,"
Sturm said. "It's nice for the guys
to get some recognition for the
good job they've done this season.
"I still think our goal for this
season is to be the most improved
team in the nation," Sturm con
tinued. "I don't think the No. 1
ranking will change that."
In the poll, Stanford received
eight first-place votes, second
ranked UCLA received five votes.
