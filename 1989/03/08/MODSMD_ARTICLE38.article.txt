# Tennis hosts San Jose St.
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
If all goes according to plan,
the Stanford men's tennis team
should have no trouble at all today
when it takes on the San Jose
State Spartans.
The match, which begins at 1:30
p.m. at Stanford Tennis Stadium,
is a reprise of the Valentine's Day
Massacre that took place on the
Spartans' court three weeks ago,
when the Cardinal netters breezed
to a 9-0 win, dropping nary a set
in the process.
"In all fairness to San Jose,
they're hurting a little bit," Stan
ford Coach Dick Gould said after
that match. Odds are the Spartans
haven't gotten much better in the
intervening weeks, but they may
be able to take the Cardinal by
surprise.
The full Cardinal squad has not
played since the consolation round
of the National Team Indoors in
Louisville on Feb. 25. While the
team may have needed the rest
after the road trip, they may find
themselves a little rusty â€” at
least in the early going. The Spar
tans probably don't have their
hopes up, however.
The Cardinal's Jeff Tarango
will not play today because of the
sore wrist he has been nursing
all season. "His wrist is still both

ering him," Stanford Asst. Coach
John Whitlinger said. "We're
going to give him a rest and see
how he feels. He might be able
to play against West Virginia
[tomorrow]."
Card notes
As might have been guessed from
the previous quote, today's contest is
the first of a two-match mini
homestand for the Cardinal, which
will take on West Virginia tomorrow.
