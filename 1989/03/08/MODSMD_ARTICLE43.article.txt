A story in yesterday's
Daily reported incorrectly
that the Palo Alto City
Council reversed a previous
decision in its vote support
ing the constuction site for
a new hospital. In fact, the
city council's vote reversed
the Palo Alto Planning Com
mission's recommendation
against using the site for a
hospital.
