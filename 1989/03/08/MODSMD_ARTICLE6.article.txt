## 
### Lisa Lawrence Staff writer 
The Stanford Police Depart
ment has dropped its investigation
of the Saturday afternoon incident
at the Sigma Alpha Gpsilon Fra
ternity house, in which 10 SAE
members were reportedly stand
ing atop the house and (lashed a
female jogger.
However, the University and
the Interfraternity Council are
still investigating and may take
action.
Unless someone can identify an
SAE suspect, or an SAE member
voluntarily turns himself in, the
case is closed, Police Captain
Raoul Niemeyer said yesterday.

The jogger, sophomore Linda
Armstrong, said last night that
she had no intention of pressing
charges against the fraternity.
In an offical SAE response to
the charges, SAE resident assis
tant Ken Hosac said last night
that "it was plainly exaggerated."
IFC President Chris Erlin said
the IFC may itself intervene, or
it may let SAE take care of the
matter within the house. The IFC
will decide the matter in a meet
ing today.
Director of the Row Diana Con
klin said she sees this case as one
in which the house is collectively
responsible for doling out the
proper punishment for the of
fenders.
