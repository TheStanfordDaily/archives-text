# Donor marks $1 million to further Asian studies
## 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
Declaring "the 21st century as the cen
tury of the Pacific," a donor has pledged
$1 million to Stanford's Asian studies pro
grams.
Walter Shorenstein, a San Francisco real
estate executive who has no formal ties to
the University, said yesterday he decided
to donate the money to Stanford because
"there is probably no place that could ad
dress the program with better capacity and
ability."
He said he is also planning to donate
money to UC-Berkeley, to strengthen Asian
studies throughout the Bay Area.
"San Francisco and the Bay Area are
the epicenter" of U.S. dealings with the
East, he said, adding that he hoped the
two universities' programs would comple
ment each other.
Shorenstein has donated to Stanford in
the past, giving money for cancer research
and the renovation of the football stadium.
This time his money will be divided be
tween four existing Asian studies programs
to benefit both undergraduates and grad

uates. Bob Lindquist, associate director of
the Office of Development, said over a
three-year period the money will be spread
out "fairly evenly" between the Center for
East Asian Studies, the Project on Peace
and Cooperation in the Asian-Pacific
Region, the United States-Japan Legisla
tors' Conference and the Korean Studies
Program.
There has been some controversy on
campus recently about Stanford's lack of
a tenured Asian-American Studies profes
sor, but that apparently played no part in
Shorenstein's decision to donate.
The Center for East Asian Studies, which
will receive $100,000 each year over the
next three years, facilitates Stanford's re
search and teaching programs in Chinese,
Japanese and Korean studies. It has been
designated by the Department of Education
as a National Resource Center, meaning
that it gets funding priority over other
institutions.
The center utilizes the East Asian library
collection in the Hoover Institution, which
"is one of the great resources in the United
States," according to History
Prof. Lyman Van Slyke, the cen
ter's director. The collection
"brings scholars from all over the
world to Stanford," he added. The
35 full-time faculty members in
the program "devote all or nearly
all of their time to East-Asian
studies," he said.
Funds from Shorenstein will
help strengthen research and
teaching about the Chinese eco
nomy, support for visiting scholars
and student scholarships.
The Project on Peace and
Cooperation in the Asian-Pacific
Region will receive $85,000 each
year over the next three years.
The project helps international
scholars examine policies of the
Soviet Union, Korea, China and
Japan and formulate ways to
reduce regional tension.
In addition, the United States-
Japan Legislators Conference will
receive $85,000 each year over the
next three years. The annual con
ference brings influential mem

bers of the U.S. Congress together
with members of the Japanese
Parliament to make policy recom
mendations in East-West eco
nomic relations, cooperation and
competition in technology and
foreign aid.
Finaly the Korean Studies Pro
gram will receive the remaining
$60,000 a year over the next three
years. Although Stanford already
has a Korean language program,
this money will expand the cur
riculum to include classes in his
tory, politics and culture, and re
search for the Northeast Asia-
U.S. forum.
According to History Prof.
Richard Lyman, director of the
Institute for International
Studies, Shorenstein mainly
wants to strengthen U.S. relations
with other countries on the
Pacific Rim. Lyman said, how
ever, that existing programs are
already strong.
Van Slyke agreed with Lyman's
assessment of Stanford's existing
programs. "Stanford is already in
the top five," he said. "We're not
starting from zero â€” we're al
ready on the 40th floor."
