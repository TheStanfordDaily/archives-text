# UCMI report scheduled for public release April 5
## Kennedy, Rosse to receive advance copy this Friday 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
After a year and a half of anticipation,
University President Donald Kennedy and
Provost James Rosse will receive the final
report of the University Committee on Mi
nority Issues on Friday. For students, how
ever, the report will remain behind closed
doors for another month.
In order to give Kennedy and Rosse time
to respond to UCMI's 300-page findings,
the report will not be publicly released
until April 5, according to History Prof.
Albert Camarillo, chair of the committee.
Another reason for the delay is to allow
students to react to the report after final
exams this month, Camarillo said.
Despite Camarillo's justifications, some
minority student leaders are demanding to
see the report as soon as possible. Senior
Richard Suh, a policy spokesman for the
Asian-American Student Association, said
the delay is "another way the administra
tion is failing to put up the concerns of
the students in terms of the multicultural
community."
If the report is released now, "students
won't stop talking about it at the end of
the quarter," said Suh. "I don't understand
why Kennedy and Rosse have to see it
first."
Black Student Union Chair Mary Dillard
said "all members of different student
groups should get an advanced copy of [the
report]." Dillard said she would like stu
dents to be able to read the report over

spring break.
BSU press representative Louis Jackson
said allowing Kennedy and Rosse to see
the report before students is "a horrible
thing to do." Said Jackson, "We are the
people who have fought for it ... It totally
affects our community."
Camarillo, who has not consulted with
the minority student leaders about the re
lease date, said advanced copies of the
report cannot be given to student groups
because the University "can't give the
report to selected individuals or groups."
Students wishing to see the report must
wait, he said, "until the entire University
community receives the report."
Jackson said, "I feel like there's some
sort of secretive thing going on where [Ken
nedy and Rosse] see the report, and they
change it, and by spring quarter it's some
thing different."
Suh said the ethnic communities at Stan
ford "have been waiting for a long time"
for the report. "We don't understand what
takes so long," he said. Suh said AASA
will look especially for recommendations
concerning ethnic studies curricula and the
hiring of new professors in such fields.
History Prof. Gordon Chang, who taught
the only Asian-American studies courses
at Stanford, recently announced his depar
ture for UC-Irvine.
Dillard echoed Suh's concern, saying that
the Cultures, Ideas and Values curriculum
has not been fully implemented because of
the dearth of professors. Her
major interest is in the way the
report deals with student affairs.
Dillard said many students in the
BSU have complained about "the
way the Dean of Student Affairs
Office relates to students of color."
The UCMI was charged with
recommending changes to im
prove minority life at Stanford a
year and a half ago as a result of
minority protests. The committee
realized early on that it could not
make the original Oct. 1988 dead
line, so a new one was set for the
beginning of this quarter. The
report was once again delayed in
late January for another two
months due to the unexpected
bulk of the final draft.
Camarillo said the report will
have a great impact, not only on
Stanford minority life, but on uni
versities nationwide. He said he
has already received requests for
copies of the report from UC-
Berkeley, Cornell, and the univer
sities of Michigan and Wisconsin.
