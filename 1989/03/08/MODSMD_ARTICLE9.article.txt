## Free speech revisited on KZSU 
### Raoul Mowatt Staff writer 
Countering charges that Stan
ford students deserve First
Amendment protection, Philos
ophy Prof. John Perry defended
the Student Conduct Legislative
Council's proposal to restrict
free speech on campus in a
KZSU debate last night.
Motivated by racially-charged
campus incidents, the council
last Wednesday proposed
amendments to the Fundamen
tal Standard that would restrict
attacks against students and
groups "which involved the use
of obscenities, epithets and
other forms of expression that
by accepted community stand
ards degrade, victimize, stig
matize or pejoratively charac
terize them on the basis of per
sonal, cultural or intellectual di
versity."
Perry, who is a member of
the 12-person council, argued
that the University has the right
to limit speech in forums where
the audience cannot escape it
and must listen involuntarily.
He said restraining speech un
der those circumstances is dif
ferent than censorship of stu
dent publications.

expression.
According to McCarthy, the
proposal reflects part of a na
tional campaign against free
speech.
"We have 200 years of case
law on the First Amendment,
and what's being proposed is to
abandon that," McCarthy said.
Perry countered that the
right to free speech was never
so absolute.
"Name me one serious free
speech case before 1917," Perry
demanded.
McCarthy said Stanford
should not pass a rule governing
its students that could not be
passed as a Palo Alto law, add
ing that the proposal might have
serious ramifications for the
Stanford community if passed.
"If Stanford deviates from the
First Amendment, we will have
political campaigns against free
speech," said McCarthy.
However, Perry disagreed:
"As I understand the Supreme
Court, there might be slight dif
ferences, or maybe even sub
stantial differences in the rules
they (cities and universities)

could make."
Laris said speech should not
be judged on the basis of "ac
ceptable community standards,"
as the proposal states.
When asked whether Stanford
should tolerated the presence of
such hate groups as Nazis on
campus, Laris said "it's very im
portant that if we're going to
have free speech, we have it for
everyone."
He added that he supports re
strictions on speech that harass
an individual, but that there
should be no restrictions on
speech directed against groups.
"I feel very uncomfortable
with the University allowing it
self to decide what ideas are
palatable for our community,"
he said.
