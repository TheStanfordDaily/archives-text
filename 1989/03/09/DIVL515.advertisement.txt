AS S U NEWS
FOR OUR EDUCATION...
A Report from the Council of Presidents
Students asserting our priorities . . .
As we were working to restore the money cut from the budget for TA's, supporting
die effort for more Ethnic Studies courses and searching for the reason students had
to endure another unreasonable tuition raise, we began to notice a pattern.
There didn't seem to be enough money for undergraduate education. Programs
such as Human Biology and jazz were suffering due to budgetary problems, and no
additional money seemed to be available to decrease class size, hire Ethnic Studies
faculty or improve the overall education at Stanford. Students were being asked to
pay higher tuition without seeing any improvement in their education.
We mean to change this situation. We are sending out a campus-wide survey to
ask students how they feel about the fact that our education is suffering while Stan
ford is raising a billion dollars in Centennial funds. We want to find out how students
would prioritize issues like undergraduate housing, money for TA's, programs like
Human Biology and keeping tuition low.
Watch for the survey. It'll be coming under your door soon. Let us know how you
feel and we'll take your statement to those who have the power to allocate more
money for our undergraduate education.
COMMITTEE OF THE WEEK
So what's all this talk about the Fundamental Standard???
The Student Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC) has the authority to originate
legislation related to "matters of student conduct involving the Honor Code and to
such non-academic matters as may warrant disciplinary sanctions against individual
students or against membership organizations of students."
Last year the council reviewed a proposal to coordinate campus and Medical School
procedures for handling misconduct by Medical School students.
This year the council is dealing with the interpretation of the Fundamental Stand
ard as regards alcohol and drug abuse. In addition, the council has produced a state
ment that outlines the interpretation and application of the Fundamental Standard
as regards bigotry.
The draft of the statement was published on March Ist. Comments from the com
munity should be directed to Prof. George Park, School of Business, by March 22,
1989. After the deadline, the draft will either be changed (after which it will be
republished for comments] or approved relatively unchanged, and agam.be available!
for review by the community. After this review period, die draft wilTeidier be slighdy
or completely altered and go through the second review period again,- or passed un

Editor's note:
In light of recent events, the loss of Asian American History Prof. Gordon Chang
and a recent meeting of University administrators and Asian American Studies
supporters, I felt the following commentary on the push for Asian American
Studies would be timely and thought-provoking .. . Jennifer Wu
The time for action is now.
As students of Stanford University, representatives of the ASSU, and members of the ethnic communi
ties here at Stanford, we stand umted in our charge that the University take immediate and definitive steps
toward the establishment of a tenure track position in Asian American History.
The most recent series of events, including the loss of Gordon Chang to UC Irvine, and a meeting last
Wednesday with University faculty and administration, has left us seriously questioning the University's
commitment to providing a full and complete multicultural education.
As mentioned, we have already lost Gordon Chang. He is the only faculty member to teach a dass in
Asian American Studies here at Stanford. Due to a lack of action on the University's behalf, Chang has
accepted a tenure track position at UC Irvine, thus continuing the trend m which Asian Amencan History
professors gain experience at Stanford and then take their skills to other universities.
By letting him go, the University has underlined not only its willingness to lose its only class on Asian
American Studies, but its lack of concern for Asian Amencan Studies and Ethnic Studies as a whole. As
students of Stanford University, we find it hard to accept the administrators' commitment to providing a
"multicultural education" when they so easily let qualified faculty slip through their fingers.
After a series of meetings with University officials, including Dean of Humanities and Sciences Ewart
Thomas, History Department Chair James Sheehan, and various other history professors, it has become
evident that the responsibility for hiring a tenure track Asian American History professor ultimately falls
on the shoulders of Provost James Rosse. Both Dean Thomas and History Department Chair Sheehan
have said that they would create the billet if they only had the money. Prov. Rosse is ultimately responsible
for allocating more money to meet this need for a complete education. If Rosse fails to act on the issue of
Asian American Studies, he chooses status quo over progress.
Through our meetings with him and his letter to the Daily, Rosse has continually offered only words of
support and no concrete action. We find it increasingly difficult to believe that this University and Rosse
cannot move any faster when a recently conceived Environmental Studies Program can hope to be in place
by next year. Asian American Studies has been waiting in limbo for the last eighteen years. We have been
patient, but history has proven that patience does little with this university.
Our Latest meeting on March 1 with Ewart Thomas, James Sheehan, Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Thomas Wasow, Associate Dean of Humanities and Sciences Michael Bratman, and Provost Rosse, was
the most revealing and disturbing yet
One thing that became evident was that the University was using a divide and conquer tactic to pit the
students of color against one another. AASA students asked Thomas to list his priorities. He named
Chicano and Amencan Indian Studies as his top two, followed by Asian American Studies. However, this
surprised representatives from MEChA and SAIO who had been told that they too would have to wait
while other priorities were being met, while everyone suffers from an incomplete education.
We believe that Ethnic Studies desperately needs to be developed here at Stanford, but not at the expense
of other fields of academic study. If the University is truly committed to providing a liberal and multicul
tural education, it must reassess its prionties and give Ethnic Studies increased support The students of
color are muted, and will not fight among ourselves for partial development of programs whose full devel
opment is vital for a full and for eYpryqpe.. 1 v.,,
Asian -American Studies .here is long 6verS?£ven ' j»puk £25/omia"'is 1 "
rapidly rising and there are fully developed Asian American Studies programs at neighboring universities,
Stanford administrators still seem to question Asian Amencan Studies as a legitimate field of study. This
university cannot claim to be leading this country into the 21st century if it cannot even follow when the
need is this urgent
But so far, no action. The commitment is there from students, faculty and administrators alike. Admin
istrators and faculty have said that if the money were available to hire a tenure track Asian American
History professor, they would do so. Dean Ewart Thomas himself has placed Ethnic Studies at the top of
his list of pnorities. So our question is, why isn't there any action? We strongly believe that Provost Rosse
can make real and definite steps toward establishing Asian American Studies here at Stanford If Rosse is
as supportive of a multicultural education as he claims, we'll see some results.

A Public Service Announcement
from the ASSU Legal Counseling Office
This year our office has had an influx of cases regarding Minors in Possession.
Most of the arrests have occurred on campus.
A new law became efffective regarding Minors on January 1, 1989. The court is
now required to suspend a Minor's dnving privilege for one year, if convicted of the
following:
1) Possession of alcohol
2) Possession of a false I.D.
3) Possession of a controlled substance
4) Drunk in public, or
5) Driving under the influence.
As well as this arrest appearing on your record and causing you great inconven
ience, die suspension could have other serious ramifications. When the insurance
company discovers your suspension, they could possibly cancel your driving insur
ance. Once the insurance is cancelled, they are not required to insure you again when
your license is returned. In the wake of Proposition 103, insurance companies might
not be so eager to have your business.
If this new law concerns you, or if you have any other legal problems, please call
us for a consultation. Our service provides free advice and consultation to Students
and their Spouses who haven't requested dieir Fee Assessment back for our office.
