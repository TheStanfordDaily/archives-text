# Campus bomb threat fizzles out
## 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
A bomb threat by a former SLAC
employee left police standing in the
rain for more than an hour yesterday
morning as they tried to open a door
of the car that contained the supposed
explosive.
But no bomb was found.
According to Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer, 39-year-old Kenneth
Newman of Union City entered Stan
ford's police station at 7:30 a.m. to
get a campus map and directions to
the office of the United Stanford
Workers.
While there, Newman told the clerk
that he was unsatisfied with the un
ion's effort to have his SLAC job
reinstated. He was quoted as saying
"They'd better help me because I've
got a bomb."
The clerk checked the make of the
vehicle, a Chevrolet Blazer, and wrote
down the license number. Police offi
cers then searched campus to find the
vchicle, which was parked in the lot
of Serra Complex, the new adminis
trative center at 850 Serra St. The

USW offices are located across the
street, next to Toyon Eating Clubs.
Around 8:15, the suspect was ar
rested as he left the USW offices,
where Sgt. Chris Lefferts was waiting
to greet him.
Lefferts said there was a "brief
struggle" at first, but Newman even
tually cooperated.
According to Ramon Mayo, a vol
unteer worker who was in the USW
offices and spoke with Newman, the
former SLAC worker simply asked for
copies of his grievance and personal
file. Mayo said Newman was "polite"
during his 15-minute stay and made
no mention of a bomb.
Upon arrest, Stanford police
retrieved two sets of car keys from
Newman, so they could check the ve
hicle for an explosive.
Sgt. Leonard Anderson, a bomb
technician from the Santa Clara
County Sheriff*a Department, made
numerous unsuccessful attempts to
open the car doors from 9:30 to 10:30
a.m.
Officers returned Newman to the
scene in a police car, only to learn

that they were using the wrong set
of keys to enter the vehicle. Niemeyer
said Newman "basically lied to us"
and originally told them to use the
other set of keys.
According to Niemeyer, officers
were concerned about setting off an
"elaborate alarm system," which New
man told officers was homemade.
With the correct set of keys, An
derson easily opened the door. After
checking the contents of the car and
an enclosed briefcase for about 10
minutes, Anderson determined that
the bomb threat was a hoax.
Newman was taken to Santa Clara
North County jail for booking. *,
According to SLAC Personnel Di
rector Doug Dupen, Newman origi
nally worked as a mechanical techni
cian from 1976 until he "became dis
abled" two years later. He returned
in 1982 as "contract employment" and
was put on the SLAC payroll again
in October 1984. His contract work
was completed in January 1987, but
Dupen said supervisors "found an
other job" for him until February
1988.
