# Inventor of the pill adopts maternal role

### Lynne Bourgault 
While acknowledging that he is
frequently called the "Father of
the Birth Control Pill," Carl
Djerassi, inventor of the first oral
contraceptive, said he would
prefer being called its mother.
Djerassi, a chemistry professor
here, said, "In every birth you
have a father, a mother and an
obstetrician who delivers the
child. Likewise, in the develop
ment of the birth control pill, the
father was the biologist, the phar
maceutical company was the doc
tor, and I was the mother."
Palo Alto's Syntex Corporation
followed him- to Stanford from
Mexico to become the "doctor."
Djerassi's claim to the maternal
role in the development of the pill

appropriately fit into his talk at
Toyon Hall celebrating Women's
History Month.
The 50 or so students who came
to listen to the world-renowned
chemist were treated to a thought
ful analysis of the future of con
traceptive research and the
unlikelihood that a birth control
pill for men will be developed
before the year 2000.
Djerassi, a small, distinguished
looking man with silver hair and
beard, said that if he were a
woman he would not leave the
responsibility of contraception to
a man.
"As a woman, I am the one who
deals with the consequences of be
coming pregnant, so why leave
contraception in a man's hands?"
he asked, again adopting the

Djerassi said that with the
small amount of research that is
being done on a male pill, the
main concern is its effect on male

potency. Many men, he BAid]jH
