## Eastern strike moves to courts 
### 
Machinists striking Eastern Airlines
failed to win appellate court permission
yesterday to shut down commuter rail
roads in the New York City area, an
effort apparently aimed at forcing
federal intervention in the 5-day-old
walkout.
Eastern, in a desperate attempt to
lure back customers to its shuttle serv
ice, said it will slash one-way fares to
$12 on weekends, from $69-$99, and
$49 weekdays, down from $99. And
pilots at other airlines continued strictly
adhering to safety rules, but for a second
day there was little evidence of a backup
on runways.
Eastern's sister carrier Continental
Airlines announced that it will begin
operating daily nonstop flights from
New York's LaGuardia Airport to Miami
today. Continental said it will run four
daily round trips.
The 8,500-member Machinists union
walked out Saturday, and with the sup
port of pilots and flight attendants soon
nearly shut down Eastern. Eastern is
seeking $125 million in concessions; the
union wants $50 million in raises.
The Machinists also threatened to dis
rupt commuter rail traffic with second
ary boycotts, which it contends are legal
under the 1926 Railway Labor Act. But
the union held off when a federal judge
in New York over the weekend tempo
rarily barred rail workers from honoring
Machinists picket lines.
Among developments:
— In New York City, the 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals refused to al
low commuter rail workers in the New
York area to honor any Machinists
picket lines. But the judges said they

expect the dispute to go to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
— U.S. District Judge Robert Patter
son, who issued the initial ruling, heard
arguments into Wednesday evening on
whether to make permanent his ban,
covering Amtrak, Long Island Rail
Road, Metro-North Commuter Railroad
and New Jersey Transit. The railroads

carry hundreds of thousands of com
muters.
— President Bush has resisted calli
from organized labor and some mem
bers of Congress that he appoint ar
emergency panel to mediate. But he
also said he will not tolerate disruption;
throughout the transportation industry
