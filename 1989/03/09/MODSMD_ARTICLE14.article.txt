WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate
Republican Leader Bob Dole,
struggling to stave off certain re
jection of John Tower's nomina
tion as defense secretary, pro
posed yesterday night an ex
traordinary six-month trial con
firmation period so senators could
- judge whether Tower lived up to
his no-drinking pledge.
Senate Democratic Leader
George Mitchell expressed "imme
diate serious concerns" over the
proposal, but promised to consider
it overnight.
Dole made his" dramatic bid to
salvage the nomination at the end

of the fifth day of a draining Sen
ate debate, and after conceding it
would "take a miracle to win con
firmation."
Under Dole's proposal, Tower
would be confirmed, but would
submit a letter of resignation to
President Bush dated Oct. 1,
1989. If Tower's performance
were satisfactory, there "proba
bly" would be no need to recon
firm him, Dole said. Otherwise,
"he probably wouldn't be the
nominee."
Dole said he offered his proposal
after discussing it with Tower. It
came as the Senate' neared a

climax in its bitter struggle over
the nomination.
Dole made his extraordinary
proposal to deal with Senate con
cerns over Tower's history of
drinking. "I think we ought to
give him a second chance that
many of us have had," said Dole,
who was seriously wounded dur
ing World War II but has risen
to a position of power and
prominence in the Senate.
Earlier, Lloyd Bentsen of Texas
became the third Democrat to
support the embattled nomina
tion, saying, "I hope that when I
' get the next chance to talk with

John Tower about the tough job
of keeping this country strong, it
will be while he's in his new office
at the Pentagon."
"I'm both honored to have his
prestigious support, and grateful
for his humane understanding of
what my family has endured,"
Tower said.
Bentsen's decision to support
the nominee was high drama.
The former vice presidential
candidate praised the work of fel
low Democrats who have opposed
the nomination — Mitchell and
Sam Nunn, the-Georgia senator
who chairs the Armed Services

Committee, but said he would
support the a man with whom he
served in the Senate for 14 years.
Bentsen noted that in January
he had introduced Tower to the
Senate Armed Services Commit
tee and said he was qualified to
be defense secretary. Since then,
he said, he has read the FBI
report and heard the accusations
against Tower.
"I found most of the allegations
about John Tower' 3 personal life
without enough basis to deny a
president his choice," said
Bentsen, the influential Senate
Finance Committee chairman who

had been courted by the White
House after the nomination rar.
aground.
Bentsen conceded that the nom
ination process, which has been
so difficult for Tower, has been
equally painful for himself.
"In the passion of debate, pun
dits writing in the isolation of
their own offices, can forget that
public figures have feelings,"
Bentsen said. "We have seen every
imperfection in an essentially good
man dragged into the pitiless glare
of-television lights while hi£
'daughters* sat'listening." •• .
