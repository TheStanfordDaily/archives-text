# Israeli report calls for PLO talks

### 
TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) â€” An
Israeli think tank yesterday urged
the government to negotiate with
the PLO and said that with ade
quate security arrangements, a
Palestinian state would not pose
a deadly threat to Israel.
The report set off a ruckus in
the government. The right-wing
Likud bloc and the center-left
Labor Party have governed Israel
in an uneasy coalition since elec
tions in July 1984 and again in
November 1988 ended in
stalemates.
Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, leader of the Likud, said
the study undermines Israel's ef
forts to resist U.S. and European
pressures to talk with the PLO,
Shamir spokesman Yossi Ac
himeir said.
. But Finance Minister and

Labor Party leader Shimon Peres
called the study "intelligent" and
said Israel must speak to Pales
tinian representatives, Israel tele
vision said.
Joseph Alpher, director of the
20-member team that produced
the study and a separate paper of
recommendations, said, "Israel
can set conditions on its agree
ment, but it is going to have to
talk to the PLO to solve the prob
lem under the present circum
stances."
In the peace proposal entitled
"Toward A Solution," the inde
pendent think tank proposed a
lengthy period of autonomy for
the 1.7 million Palestinian resi
dents of the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip as a precursor to
possible statehood.

"We are talking about a 10- to
15-year process that begins with
a series of confidence-building
measures and new concepts on
the part of both parties," Alpher
said.
The 24-page proposal conflicts
with government policy ruling out
talks with the PLO and rejecting
any possibility of a Palestinian
state.
Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion leader Yasser Arafat adv
ocates an immediate turnover and
predicted in a recent interview
that a Palestinian state would
emerge in two years.
Palestinians would have to
cease violent acts and terrorism
against Israeli targets and accept
that Palestinian refugees would
not be able to return to Israel.
