Witness: North was willing to lie
WASHINGTON (AP) - Oliver North once
shrugged off the idea that his work on behalf of
the Nicaraguan Contraa might get him in trouble,
saying "I don't care if I have to go to jail for
this, I don't care if I have to lie to Congress,"
a witness testified at his trial yesterday.
Charges against North include lying to
Congress about his involvement in aid to the
Contras at a time when U.S. military help was
banned.
Conservative fund-raiser Carl Channel said
North made the statement in a conversation with
Nelson Bunker Hunt, after flying to Dallas to
brief the wealthy Texan on the situation in Nic
aragua.
"The only thing that sticks in my mind is that
Bunker said what are you going to do? Do you
mind getting into trouble?" Channell testified.
After North gave his answer, Channell said, Hunt

"chortled." The testimony about Hunt was part
of a day-long recitation by Channell about putting
North, then a National Security Council aide,
together with wealthy people for briefings about
fighting in Nicaragua. -
Minimum wage hike proposed
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate Labor and
Human Resources Committee approved legisla
tion yesterday to gradually raise the minimum
wage $1.30 an hour to $4.65 after rejecting a
Bush administration plan for a smaller increase
coupled with a reduced "training wage."
President Bush has said he would veto legis
lation raising the minimum above $4.25 an hour
and told GOP leaders yesterday that, in the words
of press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, his proposal
"is fair and firm and his last offer."
The minimum wage, now $3.35 an hour, has
not been raised in eight years.
