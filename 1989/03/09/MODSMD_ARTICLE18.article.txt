WHAT COULD MORE ap
propriately deserve an
"open mike" than a com
munity debate on free speech?
For the next few months, the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council will wrestle with devel
oping an effective addendum to
the Fundamental Standard, a vi
tal question of free speech. While
the 12-member council makes the
ultimate decisions on key changes
or slight modifications to the
standard, community reaction
plays a significant part in deter
mining whether the guidelines
become University policy.
Unfortunately, most of the
community's voices have yet to
be heard. KZSU's Tuesday night
debate between professors John
Perry and John McCarthy stands
as one of only a few community
forums that has provided a
sounding board for argument.
By setting up a two-on-two

debate scheduled for early spring
quarter, the Council of Presidents
seems to have taken the lead in
bringing the debate up for public
scrutiny.
This debate should hopefully
lead to other discussions and in
spire campus groups including
the ASSU, Residential Education
and the newly-formed Committee
for First Amendment Rights to
plan meetings as well as more
open-mike sessions.
On the graduate level, the Law
School may seem strangely silent
amidst what is at heart a legal
dispute. Fortunately, several law
professors yesterday confirmed
that they have drafted careful re
sponses to the council's amend
ment. Moreover, the Law School
has tentatively scheduled a major
forum on the issue for April 5
at noon.
When the rules of free speech
are at issue, no one can afford
to be silent.
