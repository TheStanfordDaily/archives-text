# What a waste

### 
T J RASH HAS BECOME a
dirty word at most student
, run - houses, but .several.:.
University-operated residences
still need to clean up their act. *
Co-ops, self-ops and graduate
residences are the backbone of a
whole recycling boom, according
to a recycling study released last
week. The study took into account
the amount of material recycled
per resident and found a steady
rise in campus-wide recycling to
tals. In January alone, 114.9 tons
of campus material were recycled.
Unfortunately, several Univer
sity-run dorms (specifically, those
in Wilbur Hall) are lagging far
behind in the recent revival.
It's obvious that Stanford's

bigger undergraduate dorms can
learn a lesson or two from
campus_ co-ops and self-ops.
For example, those bright green
recycling bins scattered around
ccuiijjus neeu iu ue m ciear view
at all residences.
Dorm residents can take the
inititative to label the trash cans
in their rooms with "Garbage
Only" and "Recyclables Only"
signs.
This quarter's "You Can Make
a Difference" conference helped
increase awareness about envi
ronmental and energy-saving is
sues. By the same token, the
University should commit itself
to keeping recycling awareness
alive in all campus residences.
