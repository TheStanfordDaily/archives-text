# Law firm found guilty
## Baker & McKenzie violated recruiting policy 
### Caitlin Liu Staff writer 
In a memorandum issued to law students
last week, the Stanford Law School Over
sight Committee stated that the nation's
largest law firm Baker & McKenzie has
indeed violated the Law School's non
discrimination policy.
According to committee member William
Boyle, a first-year law student, this case
is the first time a law firm's conduct has
been found to violate the policy since it
was revised last May by the Law School
faculty.
The committee has not yet decided what
actions to take against Baker & McKenzie,
committee member Sally Dickson said yes
terday. Dickson, assistant dean of Student
Affairs at the Law School, said the com
mittee should announce its decision before
the end of this quarter.
The committee's ruling responds to the
conduct of a Baker & McKenzie partner
during an interview with a black woman
law student at the University of Chicago
last December.
According to the Feb. 12 National Law
Journal, the partner asked the woman ap
plicant how she would respond if she were
called a "black bitch" or a "nigger" by
colleagues or adversaries, and later made
additional racist and anti-Semitic remarks
to her.
Robert Cox, chair of Baker & McKenzie,
said in a telephone interview two weeks
ago that the remarks made by the partner

do not represent the views of the entire
firm.
"He (the partner) has gone into retire
ment and no longer practices with us," Cox
said.
Nevertheless, Chicago and Yale Univer
sity have already banned Baker &
McKenzie from recruiting on their cam
puses for one year. Chicago and Yale offi
cials could not be reached for comment
yesterday.
At Stanford, several law student associa
tions, including the black, Jewish, Asian-
American, Latino, women's, and gay and
lesbian groups, have demanded that the
Law School ban Baker & McKenzie from
campus for one year because of the dis
criminatory conduct.
"It's a good sign that this firm was found
in violation," said Black Law Student As
sociation Co-Chair Audrey McFarlane.
"We're grateful for that."
However, McFarlane said the action the
committee takes against Baker & McKenzie
will determine whether or not the non
discrimination policy is "a policy with
teeth."
In the meantime, members of the Na
tional Lawyers' Guild issued a memoran
dum supporting the Stanford law student
organizations.
"We hope that the rapid and vocal reac
tion of so many diverse student organiza
tions will send a powerful message to the
administration and Career Services that
students here take very seriously the prob
lem of racism, sexism and homophobia in
law firms," the memo stated.
