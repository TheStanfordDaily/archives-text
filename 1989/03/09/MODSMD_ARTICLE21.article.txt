## Bad content, bad intent 
### 
ANY WAY YOU slice it, the Student
Conduct Legislative Council's pro
posed interpretations and applica
tions of the Fundamental Standard are
a disaster.
Technically, the proposal fails to clarify
the Fundamental Standard's vague ex
hortion to honorable behavior, except to
emphasize that "some forma of expres
sion can ... constitute violations of the
Fundamental Standard."
Exactly what forms of expression are
these? Your guess is as good as mine —
or as good as the council's. The proposal's
definitions of punishable expression are
highly relative and arbitrary, couched in
terms of "appropriateness," "intent" and
"accepted community standards." Such
a threat of Draconian, foi;,
such a poorly defined
Tilate anyone's conception of fundamental
fairness. * w ."'
Indeed, the definition of what consti
tutes offensive expression will always be
fluid, changing with time and with the
sensitivity of the offended. To draw out
an old chestnut. If he were enrolled at
Stanford, would Salman Rushdie be at
risk of expulsion under the proposed in
terpretation of the Fundamental Stand
ard? If not, why not? Because his
offensive expression was expressed clever
ly?
Come on. A judicial policy which
engenders such confusion should not be
judicial policy.
But the proposal is defective for more
important reasons, reasons that cut to
the core of its intent and the incom
patibility of that intent with the academic

mission of our university. Through its
advocacy of school-sponsored censorship,
the proposal starts Stanford down the
slippery slope towards chilled and im
poverished intellectual debate.
Of all the types of offensive behavior
engaged in at this campus, why does the
councii feel compelled to single out for
restriction the only one written into the
Constitution? If we regulate speech, why
not more actively regulate behavior —
such as underage drinking — that is not
specifically protected by both our na
tional law and our intellectual heritage?
Free speech is a social good, but it is
not like other social goods. It must not
be viewed as one among many competing
variables to be weighed in the complex
. Giaour . contemporary ethics-,
JRa thermit, .must- be
the good upon which our democratic so
ciety and,' more specifically, our univer
sities are founded.
Moreover, the vagueness of the pro
posed interpretation of the Fundamental
Standard sparks the fear that this new
found power of censorship will be used
for the Orwellian sanitation of honest
debate.
Important and complex issues often
touch on — or center around — racially
or ethnically charged issues. To think
that the threat of expulsion for offending
somebody by talking about these issues
will not have a profound chilling effect
on open discussion is naive in the ex
! treme.
' If this fear sounds alarmist, re-read
the history of the Western Culture
: debate. During the Western Culture

debate, various individuals and groups
on campus accused the supporters of;
Western Culture of racism and
tivity. i|
Under the new legislation, those com- i
plaints could be taken to Sadly Cole, and
you can bet that extricating yourself from
such an accusation would be a Kafka- ;
esque nightmare.
In actuality, the best safeguard for di-'
versity is not to enforce vague standards .
of polite behavior, ..but rather |

communication. „, J

And it's not as though the stupid or ,
repugnant exercise of free speech does
not have consequences in the absence of
formal University policy. Just ask Jay
Lopez, the sophomore whose remarks in
the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue
have probably written him out of the
gene pool.
President Kennedy's analysis of free
speech on the university campus, and the
Brest/Schwartz report which followed it,
should act as beacons for confused policy
makers. We must not allow our commit
ment to diversity to seduce us away from
the founding tenet of the university: free
speech. ■
