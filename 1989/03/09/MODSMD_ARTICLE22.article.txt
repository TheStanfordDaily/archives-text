## Defamatory speech not necessary for flow of ideas 
### 
The Daily's March 3 editorial
attempts to refute the proposed
interpretation of the Fundamen
tal Standard by the Student Conduct
Legislative Council on the grounds that
it will violate the fundamental constitu
tional right of free speech. The edito
rial states, "More than anywhere else,
a university must foster free inter
change of ideas."
I can only ask, what ideas are inter
changed when a person calls another
"nigger" or "faggot"? Clearly it is not
necessary to use these words to discuss
issues of racism or homophobia I feel
there is an urgent need to discuss
these issues, but I do not agree that
defamatory expressions are necessary

It is the responsibility of
University officials to draw
the line.

for such issues to be discussed.
The editorial expresses popular fears
concerning the restriction of free
speech: Where do you draw the line
and who draws it? This concern is
emphasized by the use of "dangerously
vague and ambiguous language" in the
proposal.
I contend that the use of such lan
guage is required of a policy that must
be applied differently according to each

particular situation.
It is the responsibility of University
officials to draw the line wherever they
see fit. So far, I feel they have done
an excellent job in wrestling with each
particular issue and applying the ap
propriate measures.
The fear that any censorship will
result in complete or unfair censorship
is unrealistic in light of the fact that
the University must uphold its reputa
tion as a great university.
Very few people would like to attend
a university that restricted ideas. And
there is a big difference between re
stricting ideas and restricting the
defamatory expression of certain ideas.
Clearly, the University officials who

took months in deciding what to do
about the Otero and Ujamaa incidents
were very concerned about fairness
and the implications of their decision.
It is unrealistic to think that they
would approach any extremes.
It is the responsibility of the Univer
sity to establish and maintain a com
munity where all of its members are
protected. It must do this by not
cowering away from the challenge of
drawing that fine line between an
individuals freedom of speech and his
or her responsibility to fellow commu
nity members.
