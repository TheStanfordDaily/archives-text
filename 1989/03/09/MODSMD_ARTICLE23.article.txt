# Western culture has added to the rise of fundamentalism
## 
### 
In an otherwise confused and ill
reasoned March 6 letter, John Reynen
makes one sensible connection. He is
right to imagine that many of the sup
porters of the new Culture, Ideas and
Values program deplore the Ayatollah
Khomeini's death sentence against
writer Salman Rushdie. How indeed
could it be otherwise?
But why characterize those CIV sup
porters as "denounc[ers] and sup
plantfers] of Western Culture?" We've
heard this so many times before that
it's beginning to sound like a broken
record.
Various self-avowed defenders of the
"Western heritage" — among them
William Bennet, the former Secretary
of Education — have tried to turn the
arguments for change in the Area One
distribution requirement upside down
by pretending that a wider experience

of human civilization represents the
trashing of "our" heritage or the
closing of the American or the Stan
ford mind.
Open your eyes. Nobody's trying to
supplant "First World Culture" with
"Third World Culture." In this context,
in fact, the very terms "First World"
and "Third World" betray a lamentably
shaky understanding of what human
culture is all about.
There is no such thing as First or
Third (or for that matter, Second)
World for most of the chronological
spectrum covered by Area One,
whether you're talking about the old
Western Culture core list or the cur
rent CIV revised list.
Finally, in the matter of "oppres
sion" and "disempowerment," take
another look at relations between the
West and Iran. Has Reynen heard of
Muhammad Mussadegh?
Does he know anything about Ameri
can and British covert operations in
the early '50s in Iran, the operations
that kept the Shah on his throne by
suppressing a popular movement to
nationalize Iranian oil interests? Or

what relation that particular example
of oppression and disempowerment
might have to the present oppression
and disempowerment under the fun
damentalist revolution of the '80s?
You don't have to be a supporter of
the Ayatollah's indociles to realize that
the West has some responsibility for
what Iran has become today. Hopefully
that's one kind of understanding that
Stanford students might gain from a
broader look at human culture, a look
that shows how interconnected and
co-dependent we all are.
