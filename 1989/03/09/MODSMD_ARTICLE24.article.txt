# Studying the Koran allows intelligent answer to Khomeini
## 
### 
In a March 6 letter, John Reynen of
the Law School holds up the Ayatollah
Khomeini's decree as a warning to

those who would venture beyond the
secure bounds of European literature.
This year, for the first time, stu
dents in my own Cultures, Ideas and
Values track read extensive selections
from the Koran.
They not, so far as I am
aware, been moved by this experience
to issue death threats against freshmen
in other tracks who may be reading
different books, nor have they been
swindled out of a week's worth of fur
ther insight into the world in which
they live.
To the contrary, they have, I believe,
acquired a slightly fuller appreciation
for one of the main currents of
thought and belief that have contrib
uted to the making of the modern
world.
They are better able than many in
dignant journalists to understand
Khomeini's perplexing disregard for the
First Amendment and to cope intellec
tually with its consequences. '
