## Use recycled paper, make a difference on the environment 
### 
Less than a month ago more than
1,000 people convened at Stanford for
a conference that proposed different
ways in which "we can make a differ
ence" in determining our environmental
future.
In order to facilitate the process of
"making a difference," we would like
to offer a suggestion that is economi
cally feasible and entails minimal effort
â€” replacing standard paper, made
from virgin timber, used in our
everyday lives with recycled paper.
Using recycled paper helps to stem
the tide of deforestation rampant both
in the United States and abroad. Cur
rently, only 8 percent of the paper used
in the United States is made from
recycled fiber.
As a result of overlogging, only 10
percent of the old growth forests in the
Pacific Northwest remain.

Using recycled paper also helps to
create a market to stimulate the recy
cling of paper in order to slow down
the growth of our landfills.
Finally, most paper is made with
massive quantities of bleach which can
only be disposed of in toxic waste

storage sites or pumped into our
groundwater, an increasing percentage
of which is already contaminated.
Using unbleachtxi "minimum impact"
recycled paper would minimize this
problem with absolutely no effect on
our lives. In fact this paper is less
stressful to the eyes.
You as an individual can aid our
efforts towards a more sustainable
lifestyle by encouraging your depart
ments to start using recycled paper.
Finally, we would like to remind you
that you can make a difference by
using the recycling bins that are al
ready present on campus.
