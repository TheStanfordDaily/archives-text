# Ideas have a free reign at colleges, so should speech
## 
### 
I am absolutely dumbfounded by the
attitude of a large number of Stanford

students and faculty regarding the
University's policy on the censorhip of
communication.
It is hard to believe that at one of
the most prestigious schools in the
United States there is debate over
whether or not a university should
sanction free speech. Our immediate
response should be that it is not a
university's place to decide.
In fact, it runs counter to the very
justification for universities in the first
place, as institutions where ideas have
free reign.
Granted, expressions of racism and
sexism are repugnant, especially in an
environment like Stanford where such
ignorance shames us all. However, they
should be combated by an increase in
the flow of communication, not in its
suppression.
The beauty of the Constitution is in
its explicit protection from the pater
nalistic tyranny of those who "know
better" than we do. The thought that
my right to free expression may be
abrogated by a board of scholarly cen
sors is no less comforting than if it
were to be done by Jerry Falwell or
Jesse Jackson.

It is not only arrogant and hypocriti
cal, but dangerous to suppose that the
£ irst Amendment applies only to
speech when it is agreeable or con
venient. Ihe First Amendment applies
to everyone at all times; anything less
makes it a worthless pretension.
