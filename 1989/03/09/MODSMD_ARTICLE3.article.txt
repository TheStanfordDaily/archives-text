# Workers ask Webb Ranch to hire 10 former laborers
## 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
Fifty Webb Ranch farm workers marched
to the home of ranch manager Thomas
Hubbard early yesterday morning to deliver
a letter demanding that the ranch hire 10
farm workers who are presently un
employed. ... .. •— • - -
According to United Stanford Workers
representative Reuben Serna, the workers
have worked at the ranch at this time of
year in the past, but are being denied em
ployment now because of their union ac
tivities.
Serna said ranch management has hired
new workers in the past few weeks and
will "have to hire more people" soon for
the peak harvest season.
Serna said management is worried that
hiring 10 more employees will give the

Webb workers sufficient numbers to qualify
for an immediate election on the unioniza
tion issue.
The USW and 41 workers presently
employed by Webb Ranch have been fight
ing to unionize the farm and include ranch
workers in the USW.
According to Serna, California Agricul
tural Labor Relations Board rules stipulate
that 51 percent of the number of workers
at peak harvest time must sign cards to
petition for unionization in order to qualify.
At peak harvest time, Webb Ranch man
agement reports employment oi about 90
workers.
Serna said the union only needs to have
five more workers petition for an election
to reach the 51 percent prerequisite.
According to Webb Ranch management
attorney Lisa Martin, the USW
charges are "not true." She said
a number of the 10 people cited
have never worked at Webb Ranch
before and that one of the 10
workers is on workers' compen
sation leave and cannot work.
Serna said Webb Ranch is car
rying out a "two-pronged attack"
against the attempted unioniza
tion, stalling the union election
and trying to demoralize workers
interested in the union. However,
Serna said the union "has not
had one individual back down
from (his or her) commitment
yet."
Webb Ranch management was
unavailable for comment yester
day.
Planned negotiations between
the workers' representatives and

ranch management regarding the
housing conditions at Webb Ranch
were scheduled for Feb. 27 but
have been put off indefinitely,
Martin said.
Serna said the USW is "looking
to a successful meeting with the
company soon," and they are
waiting for Webb Ranch manage
ment to "notify us when they are
ready."
The 237-acre ranch located be
tween Alpine Road and Interstate
280 received 75 citations from the
San Mateo County environmental
health unit that inspected the
area last month. The citations re
quired management to make re
pairs and improve conditions on
the farm.
On March 16, a county health
inspector will re-examine the
ranch, Martin said. She added
that the necessary corrections

have been completed.
In the meantime, workers have
organized a USW-Webb Ranch
relief fund and are distributing
fliers soliciting donations and vol
unteers. Fliers will be handed out
today at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center.
The issue of unionization has
caused recent tension between
ranch workers and management.
Five workers, represented by
USW attorney Jim Eggleston,
have filed a class-action lawsuit
against Webb Ranch and the Uni
versity, which owns the farm land
and leases it to Webb.
A temporary restraining order
was issued by San Mateo County
Superior Court Judge Clarence
Knight Feb. 22, prohibiting ranch
management from evicting
workers from their homes or
harassing them during the uni
onization efforts.
