Fifty Webb Ranch farm workers marched
to the home of ranch manager Thomas
Hubbard early yesterday morning to deliver
a letter demanding that the ranch hire 10
farm workers who are presently un
employed. ... .. •— • - -
According to United Stanford Workers
representative Reuben Serna, the workers
have worked at the ranch at this time of
year in the past, but are being denied em
ployment now because of their union ac
tivities.
Serna said ranch management has hired
new workers in the past few weeks and
will "have to hire more people" soon for
the peak harvest season.
Serna said management is worried that
hiring 10 more employees will give the

Webb workers sufficient numbers to qualify
for an immediate election on the unioniza
tion issue.
The USW and 41 workers presently
employed by Webb Ranch have been fight
ing to unionize the farm and include ranch
workers in the USW.
According to Serna, California Agricul
tural Labor Relations Board rules stipulate
that 51 percent of the number of workers
at peak harvest time must sign cards to
petition for unionization in order to qualify.
At peak harvest time, Webb Ranch man
agement reports employment oi about 90
workers.
Serna said the union only needs to have
five more workers petition for an election
to reach the 51 percent prerequisite.
