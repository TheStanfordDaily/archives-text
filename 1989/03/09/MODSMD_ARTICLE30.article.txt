# INTERMISSION
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY Hot Stuff 
### 
Roll over Mozart
Tonight through Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2
p.in. you can check out the Drama Department's production
of 'Bastien and Bastienne," Mozart's one-act opera about
love and magic in the eighteenth century.
Wntten in 1768, "Bastien and Bastienne" was one of
Mozarts earliest works. It was an adaptation of Frednch
Weiskem's translation of the French comique "Les Amours
des Bastien et Bastienne* by Charles-Simon and Mane
Favart with Hamy de Gueiville. This in turn was a parody
of Rousseau's "Le Devin du Village," which,'as far as we!'
know'wasn't based on anything.
The story is of Bastien the shepherd (Andy Arrow) and
Bastienne the shepherdess (Maureen Chowning), who are
taught a lesson in the game of love by Colas Qedd
Monson), the village philosopher-magician.
Tickets are $4 and are available at the Tresidder ticket
office or at the door. Tonight's performance will be followed
by a bnef faculty lecture and a discussion between the
audience, the director and the cast members.
