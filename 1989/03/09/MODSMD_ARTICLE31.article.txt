# Cybill Shepherd's back
## But chances are this performance doesn't rival her heralded acting in The Last Picture Show' 
### Alex Kostich Staff writer 
What do you get when you cross
"Big" with "Back to the Future?"
A movie called "Chances Are,"
starring Cybill Shepherd and
Robert Downey Jr.
The premise is interesting, if not
entirely original: Comne and Phil
lip are a happily married couple,
circa 1963, until the night of their
first wedding anniversary, when
Phillip is hit by a car and killed.
(But the film doesn't end there!)
The deceased is promptly rein
carnated into the body of a new
born baby, but by the time he
grows up, his widowed wife is old
enough to be his mother. Compli
cations (and comedy) ensue when
Phillip, now a Yale grad (Ssss!),
meets his wife-from-a-previous-life
and falls in love with her daughter
(who is actually HIS daughter from
years before).
The potential for chaotic confu

sion and slapstick comedy is es
tablished, but the film takes a more
romantic rout. Cybill Shepherd, as
the grieving widow, has poignant
moments as she copes with the
shock of rediscovering her husband
in the body of her daughter's
boyfriend. The humor in the sit
uation comes out when she visits
her psychiatrist and confesses her
reawakened feelings in a love
struck daze.
Mary Stuart Masterson and
Ryan O'Neal both stand out in
supporting roles. As Corrine's
daughter, Masterson brings a tom
boyish yet innocent charm to her
character — a welcome change
from the usual Molly Ringwald
bimbo role. And, O'Neal, who is
best known these days as John
McEnroe's father-in-law, makes a
pleasant comeback as Comne's
bumbling, insecure pal.
The big surprise is Robert
Downey Jr. as the reincarnated
Phillip. He ditches his Dodo pos

tunng from films like "The Pick-
Up Artist" and "Less Than Zero"
and reveals a more sophisticated
side. He's hilarious in scenes
where he experiences deja vu, yet
he's also convincing in dramatic
moments with his elder wife.
Director Emile Ardolino turns
the mediocre story into enthusiatic
fantasy, like she did in last year's
hit "Dirty Dancing." (Editor's note:
The official position of Intermis
sion is that "Dirty Dancing"stinks)
However, there are times when
the film falters; Shepherd is no
Meryl Streep, and she is inept m
several of her dramatic scenes.
Also, once the film sets up its plot,
it loses sight of its direction. And,
as if to fill a gap before denoue
ment, Ardolino inserts a series of
bedroom-farce sequences.
They're funny but seem out of
place in this docile fable. In the
end, though, "Chances Are" works
as a romantic comedy because it
has plenty of heart.
