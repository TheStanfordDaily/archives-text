# Stanford's Cerebral Paisley does classic rock and a whole lot more
## 
### Gene Anaya Editorial staff 
In the smoke-filled Alpha Delta
social room, one can often find
Cerebral Paisley drinking a few
beers and making music for a
crowd of admiring Tans, with a few
nervous-looking freshman here
and there trying to get drunk.
If you don't know who Cerebral
Paisley is, it's about time you
found out. Cerebral Paisley is the
band for Stanford's bad boys of
rock and roll. Classic rock and roll
that is.
Formed last year, Cerebral Pais
ley has since been jamming out
classic tunes by the likes ot Eric
Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, The Stones
and The Doors.
Bassist Mark Felton (junior, re
ligious studies) came up with the
name one night after heavy drink
ing and serious jamming. Felton
explains, "it's a drug reference. The
sound of the band mimes the pais
ley patterns in the minds of the
audience on LSD."
This isn't the only time drugs
came up in the band's history.
Talented guitarist Chip "The
Roach" Day (junior, English)
claims, "I've been through the drug
scene. But now it just happens

whenever I pick up my guitar."
Whatever it is that "just happens,"
the music he generates is always
good clean rock and roll.
Along with Felton and Day are:
Sid Heaton (junior, international
relations) playing really loud round
drums when he isn't busy breaking

them; Dar» Catherwood (sopho
more, anthropology) on vocals; and
Harlan Thompson (junior, psy
chology) on rhythm guitar.
With Felton's pulsing bass and
Thompson's rhythm guitar main
taining the basic tune, Day is free
to explore the realm of improvised

guitar solos. In fact, much of
Cerebral Paisley's music is im
provised. After all, says Day,
"that's what music is." As such,
Cerebral Paisley jams out their
songs more so than just covering
them. This gives Catherwood's
throat a periodic break as Day's

extended solos sometimes last
several minutes.
With Day's talent on guitar
shining through no matter what
he plays, from bluesy jazz to a
rockin' version of Clapton's
"Crossroads," it's no surpnse to
find Cerebral Paisley drawing from
guitar legends such as Clapton and
Hendrix. And surprisingly, they do
them justice.
Drunk or, well, drunk, Chip
"The Roach" Day is Stanford's pre
eminent rock guitarist. His solos
are not mere copies of the sounds
you hear on the aging records.
They are, however, in the same
style and spirit of the original art
ists'.
Day says that he is "saluting the
ghosts of Clapton and Hendrix"
with his improvised solos. For him,
"Clapton is dead; he's no good any
more." Some may disagree, but one
thing is for sure, Day has developed
his own personal tone. Of all the
guitarists on campus, you know
when you're listening to "The
Roach."
Cerebral Paisley is more than
just a group of musicians who like
to jam out classic tunes. Their
musical style and goals go much
deeper than just that. They, along
with other campus bands, are

trying to create a unique muagj
scene here at Stanford. They
encourage other musicians to
them on stage for a good jam sej-ij
sion, like the time at the
Delts when they were joined by 1
Lord Frisbee's Marsh McCall an<J
Ice Weasels' Tom Bailey on 't
The future isn't too clear ]
Cerebral Paisley.
Heaton is going overseas nextl
Suarter, and the band isn't sure if;
ley can find an adequate replace j
ment. But for now, Catherwood j
says, "We have a really good time ]
playing, and if people like to listcrL • j
well that's cool."
Day concurs, saying, "We'reT;J
homy band. But on the whole,^J
just play to get girls." Does it wortyl
"All the time," he adds with a grii£*l

You can catch Cerebral Paisley tiiir
Friday starting at 10 p.m. at the;
Deke House.
