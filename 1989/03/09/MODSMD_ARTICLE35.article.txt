## Another mediocre Blake Edwards sex-farce 
### Gene Anaya Editorial staff 
Remember Jack Tripper from "Three's Com
pany?" Well, the perpetual hormone is back,
this time as Zach Hutton a washed-up
womanizing writer in Blake Edwards' "Skin
Deep."
The stage is set in the opening minutes
when Alex Hutton (Alyson Reed) walks into
her bedroom to find hubby Zach (John Ritter)
being threatened with a .38 Special by his lover,
Angie (Denise Crosby), who walked in to find
him in bed with her hairdresser. You get the
picture.
Let's just say that Ritter has the enviable
role of seducing the likes of Julianne Phillips,
Chelsea Field, Raye Hollit, Jean Mane McKee,

Chelsea Field, Raye Hollit, Jean Marie McKee,
Brenda Swanson, Heidi Paine and Diana Bar
ton. And that's just during the first half of the
movie. Of course, this is all done in the name
of comedy.
Claiming to be a movie about the difficulty
in changing the essence of one's character,
"Skin Deep" is more like an 'R' rated version
of Jack Tripper trying to get laid.
Of course, it includes the mandatory use of
the word "Fuck," and two reasonable boob
shots — of which females I can't remember,
so I guess they weren't that good. You also
get to see Ritter doing aerobics in his under
pants. (Hold me back.)
Although "Skin Deep" lacks depth and is
way too predictable, there is one scene that is

almost worth the six bucks, or 12 if you take
a date. (Or is it up to $13 now?) Blake Edwards
does one up on Mel Brooks with dueling light
sabres in the dark, and you can tell whose
"Schwartz" is bigger.
I'll just say that the scene ends with Zach
getting arrested for cock fighting. If you don't
fall out of your seat laughing, I'll guarantee
that you'll at least be offended. (I fell out of
my seat laughing.)
The best way to descnbe "Skin Deep," which
I overheard on the way out of the theater, was
when some guy said, "I'm glad I didn't have
to pay to see it, but it sure was funny."

"Skin Deep" opens tomorrow at a theater near
you.
