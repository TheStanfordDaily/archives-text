## Not Rush's Greatest Hits 
### Bill Fagelson 
A lot of my friends enjoy sit
ting around listenmg to old
music and thinking to them
selves, "Gee, I wish I had been
this old in the '605." You know
the stuff they listen to â€”
Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young,
Simon and Garfunkel, Bob
Dylan and Van Morrison.
The music isn't bad; it's just
that they listen to the same al
bums every night. When they
finally started listening to some

thing new, I was hopeful. They
bought Tracy Chapman's al
bum; not quite what I'd call
expanding your horizons. She
did what others have been doing
for years. Only, the others did
it better.
It is not surprising then, that
I was not looking forward to
hearing "Show of Hands," the
debut album from the band of
the same name. They were
produced by David Kershen
