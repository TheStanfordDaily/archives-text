## Not Rush's Greatest Hits 
### Bill Fagelson 
A lot of my friends enjoy sit
ting around listenmg to old
music and thinking to them
selves, "Gee, I wish I had been
this old in the '605." You know
the stuff they listen to —
Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young,
Simon and Garfunkel, Bob
Dylan and Van Morrison.
The music isn't bad; it's just
that they listen to the same al
bums every night. When they
finally started listening to some

thing new, I was hopeful. They
bought Tracy Chapman's al
bum; not quite what I'd call
expanding your horizons. She
did what others have been doing
for years. Only, the others did
it better.
It is not surprising then, that
I was not looking forward to
hearing "Show of Hands," the
debut album from the band of
the same name. They were
produced by David Kershen

baum, Chapman's producer, and
have been hailed as the newest
entry into "Nu folk" music, a term
created in the wake of Chapman's
success.
If Show of Hands is what Nu
folk is really about, then I'm will
ing to listen. The band is twice as
good as Chapman, but will prob
ably receive nowhere near as much
acclaim.
I'm not going to argue that Show
of Hands is a completely new
sound, but what new band can say
that anymore? They have, how
ever, created some good original
music stands on its own.
Show of Hands sound as though
they were influenced just as much
by R.E.M. as by any band from

the '60s and '70s. It is not so *
much in the actual sound (al
though the first two tracks do
sound like they would be comfort
able on an R.E.M. album), but in ...
attitude as well. These two bands <
share the outlook that the world
is messed up, but it can be
changed. Most of the tracks on
"Show of Hands" are pop songs in
the same vein that many of the
songs on R.E.M.'s "Green" are.
The album has a sound more
polished than one would expect -
from an acoustic band.
Show of Hands has proven that
Nu folk is not just a folk revival,
it's new music. If others choose
to live in the past, let them. I'm
just happy that others have chosen
to live in the future.

Show of Hands will be performing
a free concert today at noon in ■
White Plaza. $
