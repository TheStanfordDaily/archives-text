## No. 12 Card cagers wade into Pac-10 tourney 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
Stanford has cautioned itself all
year not to look past the opponent
at hand, but it's hard not to peek
when the bait is being dangled so
closely.
Stanford, seeded second, will
play either No. 10 USC or No. 7
Arizona State Friday at 7 p.m. in
its opening game of the Pacific-10
Conference Tournament in In
gle wood, Calif., yet less than 48
hours later, could have two wins
under its belt and a rematch with
No. 1-seed Arizona for the Pac-10
Championship on tap.
For now, however, that game is
so close and yet so far.
"It certainly is a possibility
(that we might look ahead), but
we've been pretty good about that
this year," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said.
If Stanford defeats the winner
of the ASU-USC game, which
takes place at 9 p.m. tonight at
the Great Western Forum, the
Cardinal would then play either
No. 3 UCLA or No. 6 Washington
in the conference semifinal at 3
p.m. Saturday. Along with Arizo
na, the nation's top-ranked team,
No. 4 Oregon State, No. 5 Cali
fornia, No. 8 Washington State
and No. 9 Oregon form the other
bracket from which the other
finalist will emerge to play at 1
p.m. Sunday.
It's important to remember that
the tournament winner, not con
ference champion Arizona, gets an
automatic bid to the NCAA tour
nament which begins next week.
That means, beginning tonight,
USC and ASU are playing for an
NCAA berth.
Neither team is too optimistic,
though. USC Coach George Ravel
ing said that "we're only the 10th
seed because they're not 11 teams
in the league."
Still, many give the Trojans a
good chance against the Sun
Devils ... including Arizona State
interim Coach Bob Schermerhorn.
"Right now we're playing very
poorly — we've lost four straight,"

Schermerhorn said. "On the other
hand, I think USC is playing
much better than their position
— 10th. I'm very nervous about
it."
The game will probably swing
on which of the teams' unreliable
stars will take charge: Anthony
Pendleton and Ronnie Coleman
for USC, or Trent Edwards for
ASU.
"I look at that game as a tos
sup," Montgomery said.
If Stanford passes its first test,
it only gets harder. Stanford lost
once each to UCLA, Arizona and
Cal, and has had a tough game
against every other potential op
ponent.
"What we've improved is learn
ing how to win if nothing else,"
Montgomery said, "to have some
things not go down for you, have
some things not go well, and still
win."
No matter who Stanford plays,
however, trying to win three
games in 44 hours will tax the
Cardinal's reserve tanks.
"When you get in these tour
naments, it's important to be
fresh," Stanford guard Terry
Taylor said.
As a means to that end, Mont
gomery has cut practice time by
a third to a half over the last two
weeks, and canceled practice en
tirely Friday, Saturday and Tues
day of the past week.
"All of us were getting kind of
tired, because of a long season
with really no breaks," Taylor
said, noting that the Cardinal has
been traveling steadily since an
August tour of Fiji and Australia.
"It's been affecting our legs a
little."
In particular, fatigue has been
the main reason cited for the dis
appearance of the Stanford's
perimeter game over the past few
weeks. Taylor has made only six
of his last 31 3-point attempts
since Feb. 9, and Todd Lichti has
made only four of his last 19 be
yond the arc. Only reserve guard
Scott Meinert has been successful
in that time, going six-for-eight.
If not against USC or ASU, the

Cardinal will have to hit from out
side in a potential clash with Ar
izona so that it doesn't have to
challenge the Pac-10's hands
down best shot blocker, Anthony
Cook, every time down the court.
Taylor hasn't lost his confi
dence.
"It's not so much confidence as
I'm a little frustrated that I ha
ven't been able to contribute more
as far as my scoring," said Taylor,

who has averaged 3.3 points per
game during his slump after
averaging 8.5 before it began.
"Many of my shots feel like
they're going in. I'm just gonna
keep shooting like I always have.
I feel like the averages will catch
up."
Unfortunately for Taylor, oppo
nents have so much respect for
him that they aren't laying off
covering him.

"The thing that's been interest
ing is that the other team still
won't slough oil me," Taylor said.
"It's not any easier to get my shot
off. They still respect me, I guess
— as soon as they don't I'll put
it in. I think I'm just rushing it
a little bit."

closely.
Stanford, seeded second, will
play either No. 10 USC or No. 7
Arizona State Friday at 7 p.m. in
its opening game of the Pacific-10
Conference Tournament in In
gle wood, Calif., yet less than 48
hours later, could have two wins
under its belt and a rematch with
No. 1-seed Arizona for the Pac-10
Championship on tap.
For now, however, that game is
so close and yet so far.
"It certainly is a possibility
(that we might look ahead), but
we've been pretty good about that
this year," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said.
If Stanford defeats the winner
of the ASU-USC game, which
takes place at 9 p.m. tonight at
the Great Western Forum, the
Cardinal would then play either
No. 3 UCLA or No. 6 Washington
in the conference semifinal at 3
p.m. Saturday. Along with Arizo
na, the nation's top-ranked team,
No. 4 Oregon State, No. 5 Cali
fornia, No. 8 Washington State
and No. 9 Oregon form the other
bracket from which the other
finalist will emerge to play at 1
p.m. Sunday.
It's important to remember that
the tournament winner, not con
ference champion Arizona, gets an
automatic bid to the NCAA tour
nament which begins next week.
That means, beginning tonight,
USC and ASU are playing for an
NCAA berth.
Neither team is too optimistic,
though. USC Coach George Ravel
ing said that "we're only the 10th
seed because they're not 11 teams
in the league."
Still, many give the Trojans a
good chance against the Sun
Devils ... including Arizona State
interim Coach Bob Schermerhorn.
"Right now we're playing very
poorly — we've lost four straight,"

Schermerhorn said. "On the other
hand, I think USC is playing
much better than their position
— 10th. I'm very nervous about
it."
The game will probably swing
on which of the teams' unreliable
stars will take charge: Anthony
Pendleton and Ronnie Coleman
for USC, or Trent Edwards for
ASU.
"I look at that game as a tos
sup," Montgomery said.
If Stanford passes its first test,
it only gets harder. Stanford lost
once each to UCLA, Arizona and
Cal, and has had a tough game
against every other potential op
ponent.
"What we've improved is learn
ing how to win if nothing else,"
Montgomery said, "to have some
things not go down for you, have
some things not go well, and still
win."
No matter who Stanford plays,
however, trying to win three
games in 44 hours will tax the
Cardinal's reserve tanks.
"When you get in these tour
naments, it's important to be
fresh," Stanford guard Terry
Taylor said.
As a means to that end, Mont
gomery has cut practice time by
a third to a half over the last two
weeks, and canceled practice en
tirely Friday, Saturday and Tues
day of the past week.
"All of us were getting kind of
tired, because of a long season
with really no breaks," Taylor
said, noting that the Cardinal has
been traveling steadily since an
August tour of Fiji and Australia.
"It's been affecting our legs a
little."
In particular, fatigue has been
the main reason cited for the dis
appearance of the Stanford's
perimeter game over the past few
weeks. Taylor has made only six
of his last 31 3-point attempts
since Feb. 9, and Todd Lichti has
made only four of his last 19 be
yond the arc. Only reserve guard
Scott Meinert has been successful
in that time, going six-for-eight.
If not against USC or ASU, the

Cardinal will have to hit from out
side in a potential clash with Ar
izona so that it doesn't have to
challenge the Pac-10's hands
down best shot blocker, Anthony
Cook, every time down the court.
Taylor hasn't lost his confi
dence.
"It's not so much confidence as
I'm a little frustrated that I ha
ven't been able to contribute more
as far as my scoring," said Taylor,

who has averaged 3.3 points per
game during his slump after
averaging 8.5 before it began.
"Many of my shots feel like
they're going in. I'm just gonna
keep shooting like I always have.
I feel like the averages will catch
up."
Unfortunately for Taylor, oppo
nents have so much respect for
him that they aren't laying off
covering him.

"The thing that's been interest
ing is that the other team still
won't slough oil me," Taylor said.
"It's not any easier to get my shot
off. They still respect me, I guess
— as soon as they don't I'll put
it in. I think I'm just rushing it
a little bit."
