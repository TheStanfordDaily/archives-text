# Lillydahl leads 'big meet' swimming into Pac-10s

### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Anything can happen at the Pacific
10 Conference Championships. Just ask
Doug Lillydahl.
Not even on the traveling swim squad
his freshman year, the one-time age
group superstar was relegated to the
"gain experience and provide support"
aspect of the Cardinal in the winter of
1987 due to torn cartiledge in his shoul
der. Needless to say, the headlines dur
ing the conference championships were
reserved for Ail-American teammates
Pablo Morales, Jeff Kostoff and fellow
Wisconsonian Jay Mortenson.
The sprint freestyler, however, was
not quite ready to be written off for
the year.
Paired with two-time defending na
tional champion Matt Biondi in the 50
yard freestyle, the unknown freshman
swam his name into the Stanford record
books at his very first Pac-10 appear
ance. Not only did "The Earl" become
only the second Stanford swimmer ever
to qualify for national championships
after not being a member of the 18-
person traveling squad, but he came

within .01 second of beating one of the
superstars of collegiate swimming.
Lillydahl showed he did, in fact,
belong at nationals, going on to earn
individual All-America status, helping
the 400 freestyle relay team to third
place, and aiding the Cardinal in earning
its third consecutive national title.
Now considered one of the top Stan
ford sprinters ever, Lillydahl will be an
integral part of the Cardinal's drive for
a eighth-straight conference title tomor
row through Saturday at Belmont pool
in Long Beach. Not only will he compete
(and go for NCAA qualifying times in)
the 50 and 100 free races and the 100
butterfly event, but will also swim a leg
of four relays. His seven swims (14 when
preliminaries and finals are counted) in
three days are the most of any Stanford
competitor.
"The team is built around sprinters

now because of the new relays (200 free •
and 200 medley). Jeff (Garr) and 1 will
be used to the fullest," Lillydahl said.
While the versatile swimmer's imme
diate goals are to qualify for nationals
and help the Cardinal to a Pac-10 title, '
he would like to win an event at the
conference meet for the first time as £
well. Able to train at 100 percent fo' r '
the first time at Stanford after under
going shoulder surgery and clocking his
fastest unshaved times, Lillydahl will •
definitely have a legitimate, and this
time expected, shot at a freestyle title.
"Although Doug has had a fairly frus
trating dual meet season he is a big
meet swimmer and this is going to be
a big meet for him," Asst. Coach Ted
Knapp said.
Although Stanford dropped its final
dual meet to rival California and has
qualified only five swimmers unshaved
for NCAAs, Lillydahl feels the Cardinal
should be considered the favorite in the
championship meet. Not only do a num
ber of swimmers have big-meet experi
ence but the heralded freshman class
is eager to show its stuff in its first
