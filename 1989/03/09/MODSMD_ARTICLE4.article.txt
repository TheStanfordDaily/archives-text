# Minority groups unite in support of Asian-American Studies
## 
### Janine De Fao Staff writer 
• Several students-of-color groups yester
day demonstrated their united support
for an Asian-American Studies program
by holding a noon press conference at
.'the Old Union Clubhouse.
The groups emphasized their support
for the creation of a tenure-track position
in Asian-American Studies and ques
r'tioned the University's commitment to
(ethnic studies in general.
Representatives from the Asian
t American Students Association, the Black
Student Union, MEChA (a Chicano stu
dent organization), the Stanford Ameri
• can Indian Organization and the ASSU
Committee on Democracy in Education
issued press releases declaring their

solidarity and outlining mutual concerns.
"One thing that became evident (in a
meeting with University officials) was
that the University was using a divide
and conquer tactic to pit the students of
color against one another," reads the
AASA statement.
The statement explains that Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Ewart Thomas
listed his top two priorities as Chicano
and American Indian studies, followed
by Asian-American studies. According to
the statement this ranking came as a
surprise to both MEChA and SAIO, who
had also been told that their programs
"would have to wait while other priorities
were being met."
Sophomore Delia Ibarra, MEChA co
chair, said the group calls on the Uni
versity not to "attempt to restrict the

growth of these fields by assuming that
it must build one branch of ethnic studies
at the expense of another."
Thomas, in an interview yesterday, said
this is an inaccurate description of his
agenda.
"I wouldn't dream of trying to divide
the groups. One of the most impressive
things about student politics (at Stanford)
is the consolidation and coordination be
tween student groups," he said.
AASA is demanding "at minimum, a
commitment before the end of this year
that the money (for the tenure-track po
sition) will be allocated and that a search
(for a professor to fill this position) will
start next fall," said Richard Suh, Issues
Committee chair for AASA.
AASA, the BSU and CODE specifically
targeted Provost James Rosse in their

statements.
"It has become evident that the respon
sibility for hiring a tenure-track Asian-
American history professor ultimately
falls on the shoulders of Provost James
Rosse," said junior Quynh Tran, an AASA
member.
"Both Dean Thomas and History De
partment Chair Sheehan said they would
create the billet if they only had the
money," Tran added.
However, Thomas denied having said
this.
"Planning to create that billet is part
of an overall affirmative action plan in
this office to increase the range of intel
lectual perspectives in teaching research
and to increase the number of teaching
positions for all underrepresented
groups," Thomas said.

This plan also includes implementing
one or more courses in Native American
studies, an Asian-American history
course, a tenure-track appointment in
Chicano studies and African-American
studies and the addition of more women
to the faculty, Thomas said.
In a statement issued yesterday,
Provost Rosse said he stands behind
Thomas's efforts to "put together an in
tegrated plan of appointments and course
development to support multicultural ed
ucation at Stanford."
He added that the plan included "the
firm expectation that a tenure-line posi
tion in Asian-American history will
develop over the next one to two years."
Rosse concluded, "We would be willing
to meet again with students."
