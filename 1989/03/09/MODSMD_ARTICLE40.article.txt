# Top-ranked spikers crush Cal

### John Kirks Staff writer 
On Tuesday, March 7, 1989,
the Stanford men's volleyball
team reached the pinnacle of col
lege volleyball. The Cardinal
was crowned as the nation's
best in the Tachikara men's vol
leyball top twenty, marking the
first time in history that Stan
ford has attained the No. 1 po
sition.

Men's Volleyball
Cardinal 3, Bears 0

Last night, the Cardinal cel
ebrated that most impressive
promotion with a three-game
romp over the California Golden
Bears' club team. The Cardinal
seemed a bit caught up in the
excitement of the week when the
match against California began;
game one was fairly tight. Cal
was as close as two points at
13-11 before the Cardinal flexed
its offensive muscle. Stanford
scored the next two points to
win 15-11, and the match was
all but over.
California could muster al
most no resistance to the Car
dinal attack in the next two

games. Stanford coasted in
those games by tallies of 15-4
and 15-2. The most exciting
plays in the lackluster contest
were a stellar diving dig by Dan
Hanan and some fancy footwork
by hitter Ryan Moos on an at
tempted jump serve.
In a week that has proven to
be so momentous, though, the
Cal match must take u back
seat; the Stanford volleyball his
tory that has been made
deserves special attention.
In light of Stanford's steady
climb to the top of the Tachikara
poll, some Cardinal fans seem
unfazed by the team's final step
to the top of the mountain.
However, the Cardinal' 3
prominence as a national volley
ball power must be examined in
the proper light.
In a season in which Coach
Fred Sturm's (most unam
bitious) goal for his team was
just "to be the most improved
team in college volleyball," his
squad has exceeded his expec
tations by a long shot.
In the preseason, by virtue of
the return of Scott Fortune
from the Olympic team, the
coaches ventured to install the
Cardinal at the fourth slot in
the national poll. After a shaky
showing in the early season

tournaments, Stanford dropped
to as low as sixth before the
team's 1989 fairy tale began.
In Stanford's first real chal
lenge of its WIVA campaign, the
Hawaii Rainbows trounced the
Hanan-less Cardinal in three
games in the first of a two
match set. But, as captain Scott
Fortune explained, the second
match, which Stanford won in
dramatic, five-game fashion,
was the turning point in the
Cardinal's season.
"After we beat Hawaii, we
knew for the first time that we
were really good. They are a
solid and experienced team, and,
besides that, they v/ere ranked
No. 1 in the nation," Fortune
said.
When asked if the Cardinal's
charge to the top was a little
surprising to him, Fortune
responded, "Sure, concerning all
the young guys we've worked
into the system, it's got to be a
little surprising."
Boasting a 10-1 WIVA record
and the recently garnered No.
1 national ranking, the Cardinal
now takes a well-deserved break
as the players prepare for ex
ams. The squad's next match
will be in two weeks, when Stan
ford hosts No. 16 Ohio State.
