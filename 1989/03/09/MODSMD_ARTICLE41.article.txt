Everybody's doing it. I hate
being left out. So without
further ado, here is the
first annual 1989 All-Portnoy
Basketball Team.
Since October, my crack staff
and I have viewed games all over
the country, logging what may
have been the most demanding
travel schedule in the history of
sports journalism. We have come
up with an exclusive list of college
and pro players who meet our
rigorous criteria.
Our list of criteria is extensive:
LAUNCH! Shoot the ball from
wherever you please. Often. With
out discretion. Without con
science. From behind the back
board, if the mood strikes you. If
our team is good enough to hit
40 percent of its shots, we'll beat
you. I think we are.
Spearheading the All-Portnoy
Team is the automatic selection
of Coach Paul Westhead and his
entire Loyola Marymount roster.
Plus the redshirts. Because the
launch mentality is already there.
The Lions have uncorked more
3-pointera than the other seven
teams in their conference com
bined. Before their victory over
Santa Clara in the finals of the
WCAC tournament, LMU guard
Jeff Fryer had attempted 302
bombs, more than the whole
Bronco team. He averages over
10 attempted threes a game. Now
that's giving it the old heave-ho!

The Lions' star, Hank "The
Bank" Gathers, makes the All-
Portnoy team by virtue of his stel
lar 65 percent shooting from the
field and his abysmal 57 percent
shooting from the charity stripe.
And because anyone who leads the
nation in scoring has to take a
load of shots.
Other All-Portnoy performers
from the college ranks include two
Pac-10 entries. First and foremost
is Oregon State's Gary Payton.
Payton, despite leading his team
in everything but fouls, is on the
team because his ego says,"I can
do it anytime, from anywhere, in
anyone's face."
Even if that means picking a
fight with Stanford's Eric Reveno,
who could flick Gary into the 15th
row if he were so inclined. USC's
Anthony Pendleton was chosen for
his 19-heave effort at Maples just
a week-and-a-half ago.
On to the NBA, where it is
much easier to find true offensive

players because that's the name
of the game.
Tunnel vision is something *
every All-Portnoy candidate
covets. The Los Angeles Lakers' #
Orlando Woolridge sets the stand- \
ard here. Just two nights ago
"The O" was seen recording his 4
first assist of the season. In typ-vi
ical All-Portnoy fashion, it was a «
behind-the-back pass. I
Detroit's Vinnie Johnson will J
still be on this team when he's 'fl
50. The beauty of "The Micro- y
wave" is that he won't stop shoot- '
ing, even if he's missed his last
10 straight. '
The New York Knicks' Trent j
Tucker comes off the bench for '
the All-Portnoy squad to launch
treys — in droves. In coach Rick ,ji||
Pitino's scheme — which appro- .3
priately places utmost importance 3
on the three — Tucker is an es
sential ingredient. Remember how 3
many Providence sent into orbit vj
in their surprisingly successful ,«
tourney run two years ago? Pitino J|
hasn't changed a bit.
Dallas' Derek Harper would gfl
have been chosen for running out ■
the clock with the game tied H
against the Lakers in the 1987 1
NBA playoffs, but it was deter*. M
mined by our staff that he waJ M
still thinking about a missed shot, fl
No All-Portnoy performer ever ■
worries about how he's shooting M
