# 'The Enforcer' plays tall off the bench
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the last in
a three-part series on the Stanford
utornen's basketball team's fresh
man class.

Picture any women's basketball
game this season. Within minutes
of the opening tipoff, a 6-foot-3
center lopes down the sideline
from the end of the Stanford
bench and kneels by the scorer's
table, patiently awaiting a lapse
in the action that will allow her
entry.
The buzzer sounds, the play
pauses, the transformation be
gins. The reserve steps on the
court and suddenly becomes an
intense competitor. She powers to
the basket for layups, drains 15-
footers at will, denies baseline
drives and grabs her share of
rebounds.
A typical game for Julie
Zeilstra.
One of Stanford's three fresh
men who combined to form the
top recruiting class in the nation,
Zeilstra came to the Farm from
Vernal, Utah, as the least touted
of the highly-acclaimed recruits.
Over the course of the season,
however, she has developed into
one of the key players on the Car
dinal roster and is perhaps the
sole reason for Stanford's move
from top-20 to top-four status.
Though the back-up to starting
center Jill Yanke and an occa
sional substitute for forward
Trisha Stevens, Zeilstra has

logged almost as many minutes
as the Cardinal starters and has
achieved similar success. Her 6-
for-6 shooting performance in last
weekend's Pacific 10 Conference
title-clincher against Arizona
State typifies the play the fresh
man has exhibited throughout the
year.
"I think Julie is really begin
ning to come into her own now,"
classmate Chris MacMurdo said.
"She's going in there and giving
some people some rest, and is
doing some damage on her own."
Enough damage has been done,
in fact, to earn her the nickname
"The Enforcer." Her physical
brand of basketball has made her
an opponent's nightmare, as she
shows little reluctance to jostle in
the key with players taller or big
ger than she.
However, off the court and
away from the competitive arena,
Zeilstra transforms back to her
normal, calm self. A slightly in
troverted and extremely intelli
gent individual, she balances her
basketball with a rigorous aca
demic load and the peaceful ac
tivity of writing and guitar
playing.
Yes, "The Enforcer" plays
guitar. She also writes poetry and
songs "about anything and every
thing.
"I guess because basketball
takes up so much intensity, my
writing is kind of an outlet for
me," Zeilstra explained. "When I
get off the court, I can release
things through my writing. I
really like writing songs, writing

poetry —I hope some day I can
do it professionally."
Sensitivity and aggression may
seem contradictory, but Zeilstra
reconciles the two with ease. The
result has been an intensely
motivated player that has gar
nered the respect of her coaches
and teammates, one who has in
fused the Cardinal with a special,
undefinable winning edge.

"Julie has a lot of basketball
skills and a lot of basketball
sense," Stanford Coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "She is very smart
on the court. She's playing the
two toughest positions, the three
and the four, and I don't think
I've ever seen her get confused."
"I think what I add to the team

satility to the women's basketball team.
is a little bit of everything, be
cause I don't do anything great
but I do everything pretty well,"
Zeilstra reasoned. "I can play in
side or outside, and I think I add
a lot of versatility. Tara can put
me in at any position — except
maybe point guard — and I can
do well."
Diversity has characterized her
athletic career since high school.
Along with her noteworthy
achievements in basketball,
Zeilstra was also an All-State ath
lete in volleyball for three straight
years and excelled in track, win
ning the state championship in
discus and shot put as well as
finishing second in the high jump.
Of the three, however, basket
ball has become her hands-down
favorite. While she could augment
Stanford's successful track and
volleyball programs, VanDerveer
and the cagers have gained her
services.
"I enjoy volleyball a lot and I
love track, too, but basketball has
always been my favorite," Zeilstra
said. "Volleyball is not a contact
sport, and track is more individ
ual; 1 like the contact of basketball
and the team aspect of it."

Ironically, it is the aspect she
loves the most — contact — that
has forced her to make the most
significant adjustment coming out
of high school. College basketball
is a very physical game, much
more so than the contests she
played in at Uintah High School
in smalltown Vernal.
The difference between the two
levels is great. In high school, the
referees are more conscious about
contact, blowing the whistle fre
quently and spuriously. In the
NCAA, however, the rules are
more lax, allowing a rougher style
of play to predominate.
"I think the biggest adjustment
for Julie is that it's a lot more
physical than she's used to," Van-
Derveer noted. "Sometimes in
games she gets hit in the face and
she's waiting for a foul, but noth
ing's called."
"That's probably one of the big
gest things I've learned " Zeilstra
concurred. "In high school, if I
came within an inch of anybody
they'd call a foul on me. Here,
it's like people can knock you to
the floor and not get called for a
foul.
"It took me a while to get used
to the physical style, but now I'm
beginning to like it."
Tonight, when the Cardinal
takes the Maples Pavilion floor
against USC in front of a national

ESPN audience, Zeilstra'a adjustf'"
ments will be put to a strong test.i :
Reigning Pac-10 Player of the
Year Cherie Nelson, who ha*
retained her scoring prowess and
averages 24.8 points per outing
will provide all of the Cardinal
post players, but especially
Zeilstra, with a great challenge.^:

over the Trojans in Los Angela
two months ago, Nelson was not
even in the arena, as Coach Linda
Sharp suspended her for discipli.
nary reasons. Back in a USC uni.
form and eager to impress «
television audience, the senior
preseason first team All-American
will force Stanford to muster its
best defensive effort.
"I've never seen her play and
I've never played against her, so
I'll probably have to watch from
the bench and see what works,*
Zeilstra said. "I think [I'll] just
be really physical with her, let
her know that she's not going to
dominate. [I'll] put a body on her J
and disrupt her rhythm a little
bit, just do whatever I can to stop
hen"
Quite a prediction from the
soft-spoken Zeilstra. But if her
play of late is harbinger of things
to come, the aggressive
the one that suits up for tonight'i
game, will do the job. .J|;

as the Cardinal starters and has
achieved similar success. Her 6-
for-6 shooting performance in last
weekend's Pacific 10 Conference
title-clincher against Arizona
State typifies the play the fresh
man has exhibited throughout the
year.
"I think Julie is really begin
ning to come into her own now,"
classmate Chris MacMurdo said.
"She's going in there and giving
some people some rest, and is
doing some damage on her own."
Enough damage has been done,
in fact, to earn her the nickname
"The Enforcer." Her physical
brand of basketball has made her
an opponent's nightmare, as she
shows little reluctance to jostle in
the key with players taller or big
ger than she.
However, off the court and
away from the competitive arena,
Zeilstra transforms back to her
normal, calm self. A slightly in
troverted and extremely intelli
gent individual, she balances her
basketball with a rigorous aca
demic load and the peaceful ac
tivity of writing and guitar
playing.
Yes, "The Enforcer" plays
guitar. She also writes poetry and
songs "about anything and every
thing.
"I guess because basketball
takes up so much intensity, my
writing is kind of an outlet for
me," Zeilstra explained. "When I
get off the court, I can release
things through my writing. I
really like writing songs, writing

poetry —I hope some day I can
do it professionally."
Sensitivity and aggression may
seem contradictory, but Zeilstra
reconciles the two with ease. The
result has been an intensely
motivated player that has gar
nered the respect of her coaches
and teammates, one who has in
fused the Cardinal with a special,
undefinable winning edge.

"Julie has a lot of basketball
skills and a lot of basketball
sense," Stanford Coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "She is very smart
on the court. She's playing the
two toughest positions, the three
and the four, and I don't think
I've ever seen her get confused."
"I think what I add to the team

Freshman center Julie Zeilstra has contributed strength and ver
satility to the women's basketball team.
is a little bit of everything, be
cause I don't do anything great
but I do everything pretty well,"
Zeilstra reasoned. "I can play in
side or outside, and I think I add
a lot of versatility. Tara can put
me in at any position — except
maybe point guard — and I can
do well."
Diversity has characterized her
athletic career since high school.
Along with her noteworthy
achievements in basketball,
Zeilstra was also an All-State ath
lete in volleyball for three straight
years and excelled in track, win
ning the state championship in
discus and shot put as well as
finishing second in the high jump.
Of the three, however, basket
ball has become her hands-down
favorite. While she could augment
Stanford's successful track and
volleyball programs, VanDerveer
and the cagers have gained her
services.
"I enjoy volleyball a lot and I
love track, too, but basketball has
always been my favorite," Zeilstra
said. "Volleyball is not a contact
sport, and track is more individ
ual; 1 like the contact of basketball
and the team aspect of it."

Ironically, it is the aspect she
loves the most — contact — that
has forced her to make the most
significant adjustment coming out
of high school. College basketball
is a very physical game, much
more so than the contests she
played in at Uintah High School
in smalltown Vernal.
The difference between the two
levels is great. In high school, the
referees are more conscious about
contact, blowing the whistle fre
quently and spuriously. In the
NCAA, however, the rules are
more lax, allowing a rougher style
of play to predominate.
"I think the biggest adjustment
for Julie is that it's a lot more
physical than she's used to," Van-
Derveer noted. "Sometimes in
games she gets hit in the face and
she's waiting for a foul, but noth
ing's called."
"That's probably one of the big
gest things I've learned " Zeilstra
concurred. "In high school, if I
came within an inch of anybody
they'd call a foul on me. Here,
it's like people can knock you to
the floor and not get called for a
foul.
"It took me a while to get used
to the physical style, but now I'm
beginning to like it."
Tonight, when the Cardinal
takes the Maples Pavilion floor
against USC in front of a national

ESPN audience, Zeilstra'a adjustf'"
ments will be put to a strong test.i :
Reigning Pac-10 Player of the
Year Cherie Nelson, who ha*
retained her scoring prowess and
averages 24.8 points per outing
will provide all of the Cardinal
post players, but especially
Zeilstra, with a great challenge.^:

form and eager to impress «
television audience, the senior
preseason first team All-American
will force Stanford to muster its
best defensive effort.
"I've never seen her play and
I've never played against her, so
I'll probably have to watch from
the bench and see what works,*
Zeilstra said. "I think [I'll] just
be really physical with her, let
her know that she's not going to
dominate. [I'll] put a body on her J
and disrupt her rhythm a little
bit, just do whatever I can to stop

Quite a prediction from the
soft-spoken Zeilstra. But if her
play of late is harbinger of things
to come, the aggressive

Editor's note: This is the last in
a three-part series on the Stanford
utornen's basketball team's fresh
man class.

Picture any women's basketball
game this season. Within minutes
of the opening tipoff, a 6-foot-3
center lopes down the sideline
from the end of the Stanford
bench and kneels by the scorer's
table, patiently awaiting a lapse
in the action that will allow her
entry.
The buzzer sounds, the play
pauses, the transformation be
gins. The reserve steps on the
court and suddenly becomes an
intense competitor. She powers to
the basket for layups, drains 15-
footers at will, denies baseline
drives and grabs her share of
rebounds.
A typical game for Julie
Zeilstra.
One of Stanford's three fresh
men who combined to form the
top recruiting class in the nation,
Zeilstra came to the Farm from
Vernal, Utah, as the least touted
of the highly-acclaimed recruits.
Over the course of the season,
however, she has developed into
one of the key players on the Car
dinal roster and is perhaps the
sole reason for Stanford's move
from top-20 to top-four status.
Though the back-up to starting
center Jill Yanke and an occa
sional substitute for forward
