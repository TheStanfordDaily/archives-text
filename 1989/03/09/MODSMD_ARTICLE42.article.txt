# 'The Enforcer' plays tall off the bench

### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the last in
a three-part series on the Stanford
utornen's basketball team's fresh
man class.

Picture any women's basketball
game this season. Within minutes
of the opening tipoff, a 6-foot-3
center lopes down the sideline
from the end of the Stanford
bench and kneels by the scorer's
table, patiently awaiting a lapse
in the action that will allow her
entry.
The buzzer sounds, the play
pauses, the transformation be
gins. The reserve steps on the
court and suddenly becomes an
intense competitor. She powers to
the basket for layups, drains 15-
footers at will, denies baseline
drives and grabs her share of
rebounds.
A typical game for Julie
Zeilstra.
One of Stanford's three fresh
men who combined to form the
top recruiting class in the nation,
Zeilstra came to the Farm from
Vernal, Utah, as the least touted
of the highly-acclaimed recruits.
Over the course of the season,
however, she has developed into
one of the key players on the Car
dinal roster and is perhaps the
sole reason for Stanford's move
from top-20 to top-four status.
Though the back-up to starting
center Jill Yanke and an occa
sional substitute for forward
Trisha Stevens, Zeilstra has

logged almost as many minutes
as the Cardinal starters and has
achieved similar success. Her 6-
for-6 shooting performance in last
weekend's Pacific 10 Conference
title-clincher against Arizona
State typifies the play the fresh
man has exhibited throughout the
year.
"I think Julie is really begin
ning to come into her own now,"
classmate Chris MacMurdo said.
"She's going in there and giving
some people some rest, and is
doing some damage on her own."
Enough damage has been done,
in fact, to earn her the nickname
"The Enforcer." Her physical
brand of basketball has made her
an opponent's nightmare, as she
shows little reluctance to jostle in
the key with players taller or big
ger than she.
However, off the court and
away from the competitive arena,
Zeilstra transforms back to her
normal, calm self. A slightly in
troverted and extremely intelli
gent individual, she balances her
basketball with a rigorous aca
demic load and the peaceful ac
tivity of writing and guitar
playing.
Yes, "The Enforcer" plays
guitar. She also writes poetry and
songs "about anything and every
thing.
"I guess because basketball
takes up so much intensity, my
writing is kind of an outlet for
me," Zeilstra explained. "When I
get off the court, I can release
things through my writing. I
really like writing songs, writing

poetry —I hope some day I can
do it professionally."
Sensitivity and aggression may
seem contradictory, but Zeilstra
reconciles the two with ease. The
result has been an intensely
motivated player that has gar
nered the respect of her coaches
and teammates, one who has in
fused the Cardinal with a special,
undefinable winning edge.

"Julie has a lot of basketball
skills and a lot of basketball
sense," Stanford Coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "She is very smart
on the court. She's playing the
two toughest positions, the three
and the four, and I don't think
I've ever seen her get confused."
"I think what I add to the team
