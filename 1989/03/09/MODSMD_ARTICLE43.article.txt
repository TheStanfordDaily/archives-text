# USC at Stanford
## 
### 
TONIGHT — ESPN, KZSU (90.1 FM). 9 p.m. tipoff at Maples Pavilion.
RECORDS — Stanford (24-2, 16-0 and first in Pac-10 play, ranked fourth
by AP), USC (12-14, 8-8 and tied for fourth).
SERIES — The Women of Troy have a sizeable 13-3 series advantage,
but the Cardinal has won the last two straight including an 89-50 win at
USC.
WOMEN OF TROY UPDATE — Though she missed the last Stanford-USC
match-up due to an untimely disciplinary suspension, 1988 Pac-10 Player
of the Year Cherie Nelson is back and doing extensive damage. The
senior preseason All-American is averaging 24 8 points and nine rebounds
per game, good for first and third respectively in the league. Moreover,
for her efforts in USC's pair of upsets over Oregon and Oregon State
last weekend, Nelson was named Pac-10 Player of the Week. Teammates
Karon Howell and Rosalind Hodge are also averaging in double figures
in scoring.
CARDINAL UPDATE — After recording two blow-out wins at the Arizona
schools, Stanford clinched its first-ever conference title. The Cardinal also
rewrote a record it set the previous week with its 108-72 win over Arizona
State, passing the 107-point conference game mark set against Oregon.
Spanning back to the Oregon and Oregon State contests at Maples, the
Cardinal has scored over 90 points in each of its last four games.
KEYS TO VICTORY — As is readily apparent, the Cardinal must contain
Nelson if it is to assure its 19th straight win. At USC last year, she
recorded a career-best 41 points, a feat she could repeat against a weak
Stanford defense. To counter her, the Cardinal will need to be tough
underneath and set a guick tempo immediately — if Stanford runs, Nelson
will tire In addition, the Cardinal will need to control the boards, since
USC remains one of the league's top rebounding teams. With these
factors under control, the Cardinal should give the ESPN and Maples
Pavilion audiences a great show.
