Cathrall's 6-1, 6-3 pasting of
Gavin MacMillan at No. 2 and
Alex O'Brien's 6-0, 6-2 romp at
No. 3.
"Cathrall's first set was phe
nomenal," Stanford Coach Dick

Gould said. "Both Jeff and Alex
served and volleyed very well.
Their first sets were great exam
ples of getting the jump on an
opponent."
Barry Richards and Glenn
Solomon also posted easy wins,
leaving Martin Blackman and
Curtis Dunn to wrap up their
matches.
Blackman and Roberto DiGuilio
put on a show at No. 1 before
Blackman finally prevailed 6-3, 7-
6. After staying on serve through
out the second set, DiGuilio had
a chance to break for a 5-4 game
lead when he went up 3-1 in the
ninth game, but Blackman took
the next three points to hold serve.
In the tiebreaker, DiGuilio took
a quick 4-1 lead and had two set

points, but Blackman, on the
strength of a fantastic drop shot
rtnd several good returns, won the
last four points of the tiebreaker
for an 8-6 win.
"Martin returned serve really
well in the tiebreaker," Gould
said. "I thought that was the key
to the match. .. He only missed
one return, and that one was es
sentially an ace."
"There was a little pressure on
me because I didn't want to be
the only one to drop a match,"
Blackman said. "When I got down
[in the tiebreaker], I just told
myself 'Hey, make the guy play,
make him earn it.' I wasn't
worried about going to a third
set, though."
