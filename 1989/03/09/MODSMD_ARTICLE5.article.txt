The bureaucratic traffic jam
that has long stalled the Univer
sity's wish to extend Sand Hill
Road past the Shopping Center is
inching forward.
The Menlo Park City Council
Tuesday night voted 4-1 to order
environmental impact studies on
each of seven proposals for the
road's extension, leaving the
follow-up decision about the ex
tension's fate in the hands of the
Palo Alto City Council.
The Polo Alto council will vote
on the proposals next Monday,
*nd follow Menlo Park's suit in
deciding whether to commission
•imilar environmental studies.
Many of the nine council members
« r e optimistic the council will ap
prove at least some studies.

vidually by the committee, and
Unless accompanied by environ
studies reports, proposals
JjN be dropped, according to Palo
council member Lee Levy.
Tne Palo Alto vote may finally
uce the number of proposals,

and speed up the debate, which
began about 20 years ago.
The University has long hoped
thut Sand Hill Road, which ends
in the Stanford Shopping Center's
parking lot, be extended to El
Camino Real and perhaps to Alma
Street in downtown Palo Alto.
Officials in Palo Alto and Menlo
Park have traditionally expressed
concern about increasing traffic
in already-busy sections of their
cities, especially Alma Street.
Members of the task force that
created the proposals and recom
mended the environmental impact
studies are presently waiting in
the wings. The task force includes
two Menlo Park and two Palo Alto
City Council members and Uni
versity officials.
The task force was set up five
years ago to study the extension,
which would affect areas of Stan
ford, Palo Alto and Menlo Park
property.
Once the environmental studies
issue is resolved and completed,
the task force plans to propose
cost estimates and funding
