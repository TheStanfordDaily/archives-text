### Lisa Lawrence Staff writer 
In a meeting last night, the
Interfraternity Council decided
to further investigate last Sat
urday's Sigma Alpha Epsilon
Fraternity incident, in which a
female jogger was allegedly
flashed by 10 SAE members
standing atop the roof of the
SAE house.
According to IFC Vice Pres
ident Todd Ortega, "The IFC
has decided to refer the issue
to the judiciary board who will,
in turn, meet to decide on how

to get hold of further informa
tion on the incident."
Ortega added that informa
tion must be gathered from the
woman who filed the complaint
as well as SAE members. That
information, he said, will be
reviewed by the judiciary
board. If they find that SAE
deserves reprimand they will
recommend their decision to
the IFC Executive Committee.
From there, the executive
committee can decide to punish
the house themselves or have
the SAE members handle the
problem in-house.
