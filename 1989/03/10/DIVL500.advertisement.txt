"New York City has it all! Living in this city as a college
student has given me the most stimulating environment I could
imagine. I am constantly exploring the City's wealth of
resources. I have been able to study French Impressionists
first-hand at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Instead of doing
just book research on Jewish religion and culture, I have been
able to meet people who are immersed in that culture and
learn from their perspective. I have explored different dance
studios, hrying assorted techniques, until I found the right one
for me."
