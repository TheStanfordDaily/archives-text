# $200,000 lawsuit settled
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
The University has agreed to
pay $200,000 to settle a lawsuit
brought against it last December
by a former employee who blew
the whistle on health and safety
violations at Stanford.
Jon Moldestad, former opera
tions manager of the Environmen
tal Safety Facility, charged in the
suit that University officials cov
ered up the violations and threat
ened to fire him if he publicized
them. The suit cited personal
damages including breach of con
tract, defamation of character, in
timidation and harassment.
The $200,000 figure was the
full amount Moldestad asked for
in the suit, settled Wednesday.
The money covers legal fees and
emotional distress.
Moldestad alleged that, in one
incident, he was intimidated not
to report defects or talk to the
press if he wanted to keep his job.
John Schwartz, Stanford vice
president and general counsel, told
Campus Report in December that
there had been no cover-up and
"we are convinced that we will
prevail on the merits."
But in agreeing to settle,
Schwartz wrote, "Because of the
incident of intimidation, we are
willing to settle this case and
move on to more constructive ef
forts to achieve our health and
safety goals."
The settlement also included a
personal letter to Moldestad from
University President Donald Ken
nedy "apologizing for the unfor
tunate circumstances and ac
knowledging that he (Moldestad)
never did anything outside the
professional code of conduct," ac
cording to Moldestad's attorney,
John Shaffer.
Moldestad said last night that
the settlement was a clear victory
and that "there was no compro
mise at all."
"I'm happy it's over," he added,
but he would not comment fur
ther.
Schwartz and Debra Zumwalt,
University counsel working on the
case, could not be reached for
comment last night.
Moldestad resigned in Decem
ber 1987 because of the alleged
cover-up and threats to his job.
Two subsequent investigations of
health and safety management
resulted in administrative
changes in this area which Ken
nedy initiated. Shaffer said the
turning point in negotiations
came last month when he and

Moldestad met with Kennedy and
some of the University's inves
tigators. Moldestad presented
about 250 slides revealing "signif
icant discrepancies between what
they (the investigators) had said
and what we thought the facts
were."
Shaffer added that thousands
of University documents and
slides were to be brought out dur
ing the litigation, and the Uni
versity would likely not want
some of the information to be
made public.
"Stanford has a lot of serious
internal problems ... there are a
lot of dangers that nothing has
been said about," he said.
