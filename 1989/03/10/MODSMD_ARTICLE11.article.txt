WARSAW, Poland (AP) -
Government and opposition ne
gotiators agreed yesterday on
free elections to a newly
created senate in what could
be the first democratic national
elections in the communist
bloc.
In addition, the sides agreed
to two-stage elections to the
existing Sejm, or parliament,
ini which opposition candidates
would be free to run for at
lehst 35 percent of the seats.
Politburo member Janusz
Reykowski, leader of the
government-Communist Party
side at the talks, said anyone
could run for the senate who
is nominated by an existing po
litical or social group, or who
gathered 5,000 signatures.
Reykowski said that those
elected and the resulting bal
ance of power in the chamber
will depend entirely on the
voters.
"There are no plans of any
kind to arrange the composi
tion before the elections are
held," he said.
Opposition negotiator Jacek
Kuron said later on state tele
vision: "We must admit that it
is a step toward democracy,
such as has never been made
anywhere else in this system.
"It creates conditions in
which citizens will be able to
elect their real representatives
to the top state authorities. But
there is a very important ques
tion whether it will be only the
first step."

The talks have brought to
gether Poland's powerful inde
pendent forces — including the
Solidarity independent union
movement — and Communist
leaders to reshape the nation's
economic and political future.
The new senate and the Sejm
would form a new two-chamber
parliament called the National
Assembly, negotiators said.
In addition, the two sides
agreed in principle to establish
the post of president, who
would be elected by a majority
of both chambers of parlia
ment.
The powers of the president
must still be discussed, but in
general the idea is to combine
in one person all those powers
now held by the Council of
State — including appointing
the head of the army and am
bassadors. In addition, he
would be given the right to dis
solve parliament and call new
elections.
There has been wide specula
tion that if a presidency is es
tablished, the post would be
filled by Communist Party
First Secretary Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski.
Rejkowski said the proposed
new election law would be sub
mitted to the Sejm for approval
as early as next week. The
Communist Party now has an
absolute majority in the Sejm,
and any laws proposed by the
party are assured passage.
