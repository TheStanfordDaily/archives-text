# Eastern Airlines files for bankruptcy

### 
NEW YORK (AP) - Eastern
Airlines filed for protection from
creditors in bankruptcy court yes
terday, the sixth day of a mac
hinists strike, blaming pilots for
a "cash crisis" that paralyzed the
nation's seventh-largest airline.
The move came a day after
Eastern insisted such a step re
mained a last resort in the air
line's effort to endure the strike,
which had strong support from
pilots and flight attendants and
was costing Eastern an estimated
$4 million a day.
Thfi filing under Chapter 11 in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New
York is designed to give Eastern
a reprieve from debts while it tries
to restructure and extricate itself
from the worst crisis in its 60-year
history.
Eastern boss Frank Lorenzo
blamed "the damage that has been
caused by the pilots union." He
and Eastern President Phil Bakes
insisted they intend to restore the
airline in bankruptcy court,
though in a smaller form.
"We tried mightily to keep East
ern from bankruptcy," Bakes said
at a news conference. "We intend
to operate our airline: make no
mistake about that."
Union leaders denounced
Lorenzo as a "robber baron." Mac
hinists called for a public boycott
of Eastern's sister airline, Con
tinental, set up pickets against
Continental in Houston, and said
they would oppose Eastern's re
organization plan and any sale of
assets.
"Make no mistake about it.
Continental is on strike now,"
Eastern Machinists leader
Charles Bryan said as his mem
bers cheered. "There's never been

a more classic example of a robber
baron. Anytime anyone buys a
ticket on Continental, they're
making a contribution to treac
hery, to atrocity, to evil."
Lorenzo and Bakes pledged that
all creditors would be paid in full;
shareholders would receive "fair
value"; passengers would be
protected, and as many employees
as possible would return to work.
Eastern had 31,200 employees
before the strike.

Only six bigger companies have
sought Chapter 11 protection, the
largest being Texaco Inc., with as
sets of $35 billion.
John Peterpaul, a Machinists
vice president, said Eastern filed
for bankruptcy on payday "in a
spiteful attempt to deny Eastern
workers their last paycheck
earned before the strike." Payc
hecks were frozen by the move.
The company, which has a stag
gering $2.5 billion in debt, has

admitted it was taken by surprise
when most of the 3,600 Eastern
pilots honored Machinists' picket
lines, forcing Miami-based East
ern to shut down nearly all oper
ations Monday and lay off 9,500
non-union employees.
Eastern, running just 4 percent
of its flights with a crew of 1,500,
is losing $4 million a day, Bakes
said. Before the 8,500 Machinists
struck Saturday in a dispute over
concessions, losses were pegged at
$1 million daily.
