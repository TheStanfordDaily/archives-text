New treatment may prevent colds
BOSTON (AP) — A newly discovered body
chemical may be able to lure the common cold
virus away from its targets inside the nose, of
fering the possibility of the first medicine to
prevent the sniffles, scientists said yesterday.
The research helps unravel the strategy used
by rhinoviruses — the culprits in about half of
all colds — to get into the cells that line the
nose and begin the all-too-familiar bouts of hack
ing, sneezing and sniffling.
While the research provides tantalizing clues
for developing ways to prevent the common cold,
scientists caution that such treatments are still
years away. Even if they prove effective, they
will only work against the rhinoviruses, not other
cold viruses, and probably won't cure colds once
they start.
"This is not a cure. It is a scientific step," said
Dr. Michael Kamarck of Molecular Therapeutics,
one of two research groups that simultaneously
made the discovery.
The two teams provided the first detailed des
criptions of the rhinovirus receptor, the minus
cule spots on cells where rhinoviruses attach
themselves.
Researchers speculate that by flooding the nose

with synthetic copies of this natural molecule, it
should be possible to hopelessly confuse attacking
viruses, luring them away from susceptible cells.
A similar strategy is being tested against AIDS.
Scientists said the approach to preventing cold
infections succeeds in the test tube but has not
been tried on people.
U.S. expells Soviet on spy charges
WASHINGTON (AP) — A Soviet military at
tache was ordered home yesterday after the FBI
caught him receiving sensitive information on
how the U.S. government protects computer
secrets, a spokesman said.
Lt. Col. Yuriy Nikolayevich Pakhtusov, 35, was
asked to leave after a six-month FBI investigation
led to his arrest Wednesday night, just a day
after Secretary of State James A. Baker 111 and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
met in Vienna.
The Soviet Embassy issued a statement saying
the expulsion order "could be only qualified as
a deliberate provocation against a Soviet diplo
matic official."
It denied that Pakhtusov engaged in any
wrongdoing and said that the embassy has lodged
a "resolute protest" with the State Department.
