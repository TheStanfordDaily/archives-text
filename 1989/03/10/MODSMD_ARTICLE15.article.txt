## Stanford's shame 
### 
COMPARED WITH OTHER
national universities, Stan
ford's faculty-to-student
ratio is among the worst in the
country.
This is not a typo. According
to U.S. News and World Report's
"America's Best Colleges" for
1989, at Stanford, there is one
faculty member for every 12 stu
dents. That would place Stanford
last among Ivy League schools
and even among the worst in the
state of California.
Cal Tech and USC both have
an outstanding l-to-3 ratio. And
although UC-Berkeley has a
google of students, their ratio is
a respectable l-to-7. The ratios
for other University of California
and Cal State schools are equally
impressive when compared with
Stanford.
In light of this, when Stanford
decides that cutbacks on funds
for teaching assistants are in or

der, students should cry foul.
One of the justifications for big
lecture classes is that students
can meet at least once a week to
discuss matters relevant to the
subject matter with TAs. But as
section sizes become larger and
larger, the justification becomes
less legitimate.
Due to recent budget cuts, TAs
have had to take on increasingly
larger numbers of students which
means more papers and blue
books for them to grade, and
fewer opportunities for students
to bounce ideas off them in sec
tion or during office hours. Over
all instruction at Stanford suffers
as a result.
Until Stanford can deal with
the fundamental problem of its
poor faculty-to-student ratio, it
should provide at least some mea
sure of personalized instruction
through improved commitments
to its invaluable teaching assis
tants.
