GO AHEAD. Go to the Con
cert Network-sponsored
Jay Leno concert. To par
aphrase Leno's Doritos cam
paign, they'll make more.
In fact, that is the network's
goal in putting on the Leno show.
If the Stanford campus shows
enough support for the Leno con
cert, the network will gain a
needed edge in attracting top
performers for Stanford-only
concerts in the future.
Leno is the biggest name that
the network has brought to Stan
ford in recent memory without
the help or interference of a major
Bay Area promoter. Read: Bill
Graham.
Graham has a virtual monopo

ly in the Bay Area in promoting
big-name live entertainment —
especially music. Graham can
keep acts within his sphere by
outbidding other promoters, in
cluding Stanford's relatively low
budget network.
In addition, entertainment
industry agents reportedly have
an implicit understanding that if
they cross Graham, he may
refuse to promote their acts in
the Bay Area.
If the Leno concert is a success,
it could shine a little light on the
network that has for so long
operated in Bill Graham's
shadow. Tickets go on sale today
at the Tresidder Ticket Office.
