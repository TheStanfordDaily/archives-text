## In defense of white men Letters 
### 
I HAVE A PROBLEM with being told
that as a white male I am invalidated
from discussing issues of race or
gender on campus.
I have often heard the argument that
the color of my skin somehow devalues
my opinion regarding minority issues:
"You could never understand because you
are white."
My question to people who make this
statement is: What point is there in com
munication between whites and minori
ties? If whites can never understand, how
can bigotry ever be eradicated, how can
whites ever lose the racist attitudes at
tributed to them?
Exclusion of whites from discussion of
racial issues eliminates the possibility
that a meaningful discourse that im
proves interracial relations will occur.
Claiming that whites can not under
stand while simultaneously vilifying
whites for this lack of understanding in
volves the construction of a Oatcih-22
from which whites are given no chance
to escape.
To a lesser extent, some people on this
campus have made statements such as,
"I don't like most whites." And the per
son making this blatantly racist remark
subsequently justifies the remark by say
ing that minorities can not by definition
be racist.
Some minority groups have redefined
racism as racial antagonism by the
majority focused against a minority. They
claim that what defines racism is not
just the belief in racial superiority but
also the ability of a bigot to oppress.
By this hypothesis, it is not the idea

per se that is reprehensible. Rather it is
the effect of the attitude.
Not only is this limitation of racism
to the white race preposterous, it is dan
gerous. Minorities discriminating against
whites on the basis of race is not unheard
of, and to ignore such activity as mean
ingless shows a fundamental lack of re
spect for people in general.
To minimize suffering is a disservice
both to whites who suffer racial discrim
ination and to the far greater group of
blacks who must live with similar treat
ment, creating a possible justification for
racism.
Bigoted whites who hear blacks or
Hispanics or Asian-Americans saying
they hate whites find justification for
their bigotry. Hatred can only inspire
hatred. Any supposition of racial superi
ority or inferiority is disgusting, regard
less of the bigot's skin color.
White students at Stanford, who I think
generally make a strong effort to elimi
nate racist attitudes from their thought
process, are justifiably alienated by stu
dents of color who blast whites as a group.
1 think there is general agreement that
the ideal situation would be for people
of different races or genders to live to
gether and interact based upon respect
and mutual understanding.
How then can you say this dislike of
whites based solely on the color of their
skin does not hinder the achievement of
racial understanding? Is not mutual un
derstanding and respect the goal? Or are
whites to be forever denied immunity
from disdain associated with the color of
their skin?

If whites can never under
stand, how can bigotry
ever be eradicated?

An analogous attitude on the part of
some women I have had conversations
with is that all males are sexist pigs.
There is no other way I can describe
this supposition than as a sexist stereo
type. I don't doubt that some men are
sexists, nor would I seriously debate that
a large proportion of men are sexist. But
all men?
And this stereotype is uttered as a
preface to women bemoaning the terrible
assumptions men make about women? A
little hypocrisy maybe?
People don't seem to understand how
these assertions damage efforts to erad
icate racism and sexism. Stigmatizing
whites as a group or defining males as
sexists encourages bigotry and sexism.
Pronouncements of racial or gender
related hatred should not be categorized
on the basis of the gender or race of the
offender, but rather on the content of
the statements.
