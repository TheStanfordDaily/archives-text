ASSU has benefited all, not just 'special interests 9

WE WERE surprised at the
content of the Feb. 28 article
which announced the forma
tion of "Students First," the second
political party to join the race for the
ASSU elections.
We are all ASSU senators; some of
us were endorsed by the People's
Platform during the last election and
some of us were not. We all share a
pride in the accomplishments of this
year's ASSU and in particular an
admiration of the work of this year's
Council of Presidents, the first People's
Platform slate to hold office.
Some have claimed that this year's
ASSU has been dominated by "special
interest" concerns. To the contrary, we
believe that this year's ASSU has both

involved and served more students
than ever before.
While in prior years students have
often not known who was in the
ASSU, much less what they did, this
year's COP involved more than 150
students in the ASSU Dorm Represen
tative program, seeking to link every
residence on campus to the ASSU.
Students with interest and initiative
have found avenues for action in the
ASSU.
It is clearly a new ASSU in terms of
student involvement.
The COP initiated many services
this year, including Course Consult
ants, Beat the Bookstore School Sup
plies, the Used Book Faire, Financial
Aid Advocates and now the ASSU

Airport Shuttle. This record of service
certainly demonstrates the COP com
mitment to all students' interests.
So what is meant when it is asserted
that the People's Platform has been
beholden to "special interests?" The
People's Platform is a coalition of
student groups; at its core are the
organizations of students of color.
The ASSU has supported the con
cerns of the Black Student Union,
MEChA, Asian-American Students
Association and Stanford American
Indian Organization through dorm
discussions of the Mandate for Change,
support for efforts to strengthen Eth
nic Studies programs and organizing
students to attend Spring Action '89, a
lobby day and rally in Sacramento for

educational rights.
We object to the notion that these
concerns are "special interest" or not
important to the student body.
What does it really mean to put
students first? It means recognizing
the needs of all students on this
campus, including students of color. It
means bringing the Stanford commu
nity together and overcoming the
tension and discomfort that have
plagued race relations on this campus.
It means prioritizing a multicultural
education so we can all learn about
and respect one another.
