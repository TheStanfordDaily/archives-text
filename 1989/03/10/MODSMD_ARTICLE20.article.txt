# SCLC will discuss extending deadline
## 
### 
After consulting with George Parker,
chair of the Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council, I write to reassure those
who are concerned by the 21-day dead
lino for responses to the proposed stu
dent conduct legislation.
I expect that the possibility of ex
tending that deadline will be discussed
at next week's meeting. In any case,
the SCLC has until May 1, 1989 to
decide whether or not to vote on first
passage of the proposed legislation that
was released last week.
During that interval, the members
will continue to seek out responses
from the community and to encourage
study and discussion of the complex
issues involved.
Three notebooks of background ma
terials, including policies from other
universities, have been placed on
reserve at Meyer Library. Another

notebook is in the Student Affairs
reception area, 323 Old Union, and a
fifth notebook is at the ASSU office in
Tresidder Memorial Union.
The legislative process needs to be a
deliberative one that provides ample
opportunity for students and others to
inform themselves, contribute their
views and influence the thinking of the
SCLC members. We all recognize that
haste would be very foolish.
