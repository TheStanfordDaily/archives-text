# Sprinklers in the rain waste water
## 
### 
Something bizarre happened last
night as I strolled home through the
rain across the grass of White Plaza:
The sprinklers came on. Talk about
adding insult to injury! I'll admit I
was wet before they started, but by
the time I managed to escape to the
(relatively) safe haven of the pavement,
I was drenched.
Why should the sprinklers come on

at 1 a.m., in the rain? Why should the
sprinklers come on at all in the midst
of one of the worst droughts on
record? I understand that the
sprinklers are on a timer and that
they switch on automatically, regard
less of the weather, but I question the
wisdom of the policy that programmed
the sprinklers to come on in the first
place.
I also question why they are set to
come on at 1 a.m., when most sane
people are asleep and impervious to
such a conspicuous consumption of
water. Perhaps what I witnessed was
an anomaly (I certainly hope so), al
though I doubt it. More likely, it is
indicative of a rampant and duplicitous
Jekyll and Hyde policy that encourages
conservation by day and consumption
by night.
The fact that Stanford was recently
listed among the best of the local
municipalities in terms of water con
servation does not give us the right to
"celebrate" by wasting water. In a year
when residents of Santa Clara county
will be forced to ration water for per

sonal use, Stanford's action strikes me
as an extravagant excess.
Stanford doesn't exist in a void.
Water we conserve can be put to (bet
ter) use elsewhere. Conversely, water
we indiscriminantly squander will be
sorely missed by all.
