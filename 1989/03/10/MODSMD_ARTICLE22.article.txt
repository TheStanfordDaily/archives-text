I would like to thank The Daily for
printing my March 9 letter, but I have
to object to the headline placed over it,
"Western culture has added to the rise
of fundamentalism."
Such a headline completely misstates
the intent of the letter and implies
precisely the kind of simple cause and
effect relationship which I was trying
to deny.
