## Pomodoro's Cube to the Gates of Hell Museum a treasure trove to discover 
### Paula Gani 
As you enter the museum
through the cast iron doors, your
footsteps echoing on the mosaic
and tile floor, the first thing you
feel is sunlight on your face,
streaming through the panes on
the ceiling.
You stop and look upward, your
gaze falling on Athena's gleaming
white figure, serenely watching
over the scene with sceptre in hand
and snakes coiled at her feet.
Follow her gaze behind you, just
outside the museum's entrance, to
the stark modernity of Pomodoro's
Cube.
The original Leland Stanford
Jr. Museum was built in 1891,
through the efforts of Jane Stan
ford who wanted the museum to
serve as a memorial to her son.

With architecture borrowed
from the Athens National
Museum, the building was meant
to be structurally distinct from
the rest of the Stanford campus.
By 1905, the year of Jane Stan
ford's death, the quadrangle was
second in size only to New York's
Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Today's structure encompasses
approximately one-sixth of its
original area of 300,000 square
feet. The 1906 San Francisco
earthquake destroyed not only a
mfy'ority of the building, but also
the University's interest in the
upkeep of such a colossal project,
according to Art History Prof.
Lorenz Eitner, director of the
museum.
A group of older adults and
young families gathers in the
lobby awaiting the 2 p.m. tour.

The smiling docent asks a nearby
gentleman if this is his first visit
to Stanford. He nods, looking
about at the paintings and sculp
tures to which he will soon be
introduced. "Fascinating place,"
he adds.
The docent program of volun
teer guides is just one of the func
tions of the Committee for Art at
Stanford. Formed in 1953, the
community-based group's original
purpose was to re-open and ex
pand the museum, as well as to
create a greater awareness of art
and increase community partici
pation in museum activities, ac
cording to current committee
Chair Jane Reinhardt.
Ten years later, Eitner's arrival
as head of the Art Department
brought about an intense
reconstruction of the museum.

Eitner's dedicated voluntary
service as museum director, in ad
dition to his work as department
chair and lecturer, would eventu
ally place Stanford among the na
tion's top university art
programs.
"Many universities have
museums, but our museum has a
university," begins the docent
proudly. As she goes on to explain
the importance of a museum as
an academic laboratory for art
students, the group enters the Eu
ropean Gallery.
Seeking the artists' names on
the placards below each painting,
you notice that the cards also bear
the names of various donors.
Each item in the museum has
been donated or purchased with
donated funds, independent of
University support. The joint ef
forts of Eitner and the Committee
for Art have made possible the
vast expansion of the museum's
collection.
The committee hosts biannual
"Treasure Market," in which
donated items of high quality such
as furs, china and jewelry are sold,
Reinhardt says. Proceeds go
toward the purchase of works
which are selected by Eitner in
consultation with others associ
ated with the museum.
"The relative emphasis given to
particular areas reflects in part
the academic interests of the fac
ulty, staff and students," Eitner
explains. "In addition, there is the
element of chance, that of the
availability of certain works at a
particular time."
The museum's main role is that
of a collecting museum, as op
posed to one hosting temporary
exhibitions. Nonetheless, over 250
exhibitions have been held in both
the museum and gallery.
In the next room the walls and
display cases hold various works
of Asian art â€” from Shang and
Zhou dynasty bronzes to a life-size
wooden statue of Buddha. The
