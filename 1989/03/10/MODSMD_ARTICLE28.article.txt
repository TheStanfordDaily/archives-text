# Eitner's dedication keeps museum alive

Behind the podium, Lorenz Eit
ner gives off an air of wisdom as
he calmly lectures about Jacques-
Louis David and the effects of the
French Revolution on art. Yet,
Eitner admits to having made the
decision to study art history "as
a child ... in ignorance."
It is no accident, however, that
the Art Department chair, Stan
ford Museum director and profes
sor emeritus is one of the
foremost experts in 18th and 19th
century European art, and has
created a place for Stanford
among the nation's top 10 art de
partments.
Eitner, a native of Austria, ar
rived at Stanford as the new Art
Department head in 1963 with
degrees from Duke and Princeton

Universities.
Without hesitation, he says the
aspect of his career he most enjoys
is the museum.
The museum is a great asset
to the Art Department as well as
to the University in terms of
academia and prestige, he says.
For Eitner, it serves as "a tre
mendous relief from administra
tive work."
"And if it weren't fun, I
wouldn't do it,"he adds with a
wry smile.
Eitner plans to "continue doing
what [he's] doing" after his
planned August retirement. How
ever, he probably won't be stray
ing too far from the Stanford
Museum.
After all, he candidly points out,
he's "the only one who knows
where everything is."
