# Some tips on tacklin' the Bug's rib-ticklin' ways
## 
### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
Every week, it's the same
damned thing: "Do people really
write you those questions or do
you make them up?"
(Visualize a black television
screen. Spoken with great
patronization:)
"All right. Last time. (Now, pic
ture an 8,000-acre frying pan.)
This is Stanford. This is the Stan
ford on drugs. This is the column
where students can get their fried
egg-induced questions answered.
This is Bug Me. Got it?"
I'm not sure what that means,
but queries should be dropped off
in the Bug Me box outside the
Daily offices or sent via LOTS to
B.bug-me.
And now, what every red
blooded American wants to know:
Dear Bug,
Why is the Bug no longer fun
ny?
— Leo Buscaglia
That's a good question, and one
that has been bothering me for
some time now. Let's get together
and talk it over. Your opinion is
very important to me, and I'm
sure you could offer some valuable
pointers on how the Bug could
improve his work.
In the meantime, let me offer
these tips to you on how you can
better understand the Bug's rib
ticklin' ways:
• Keep a dictionary handy to look
up those words you've never heard
of; they may be vital to the

humorous notion being expressed.
• At the end of particularly long
paragraphs, take a rest — tired
lips breed careless reading.
• Do not pick your nose during
or directly after having read Bug
Me or any other Daily article.
Wash your fingers first as the ink
residue can leave embarrassing
black rings around your nostrils.
Dear Bug,
Where do our student ID num
bers come from ? My closest guess
is that the second digit represents
the year we enter, but all the other
numbers seem random.
— Doug Marlette
It's simple really.
Each ID number is seven digits

long. The first two digits are de
termined by subtracting either 59
or 60 from the year of your first
quarter at Stanford. Thus seniors'
numbers start with 36 or 35.
Each application pool, usually
about 15,000 people, is broken up
into groups of 100 according to
when the application was re
ceived. The third, fourth and fifth
digits of your ID number signify
which of these 150 groups to
which you were assigned. Thus a
senior whose application was re
ceived relatively early might be
No. 35008 xx.
Finally, the approximately
2,500 applicants per year who are
offered ad mission are split into
around 80 groups of 30 according
to merit. Thus a senior whose ap
plication was received relatively
early but was a borderline case
for admission might be No.
3500879.
And if you believe all that, be
sure to get your tickets soon for
next month's Beatles' reunion at
the Frost Amphitheater. Tickets
are general admission only and
can be purchased for $4.50 at all
Bass outlets.
As usual, the truth of the mat
ter is pretty boring. Numbers are
assigned by a computer system
which has been around for more
than 10 years. There doesn't seem
to be any particular rhyme or rea
son to them. They're just identi
fication numbers.
Elif Inan, a systems coordinator
with the Registrar's Office, was
most helpful with her negative
answers. For example, the first

person to get a number under
this system did not have No. I.
And the person alphabetically fol
lowing student No. 3768858 is not
necessarily No. 3768859, though
that could occur "by chance."
Dear Bug,
There's rumor going around
that a headless, limbless torso was
found on the altar of Memorial
Church in the early 19705? Is
there any truth to this?
— McMillan and Wife
Not quite, but close enough. A
body was found at 5:45 a.m. near
the altar of Memorial Church on
October 13, 1974. It was neither
headless, nor limbless, but the
details are quite unpleasant and

if you want them all, find out for
yourself.
The Bug will summarize ac
cording to The Daily's coverage
at the time. Don't bother looking
for jokes; there aren't any.
Arlis Perry, the 19-year-old wife
of Stanford sophomore Bruce Per
ry, died of a knife wound to the
back of her head sometime after
midnight on Sunday. A security
guard had locked the church up
at about 11:45 p.m. Saturday
night, and when he returned the
next morning, he found Perry's
body at the rear of the east tran
sept.
This murder was the fourth on
campus within two years, and the
case remains unsolved.
And speaking of murder. ..
Dear Bug,
Do you think Ted Bundy was
good at ping pong?
— Bob Newhart
Where the hell this question
came from I don't know, but it
sure is a good one. The Bug
doesn't really have an answer but
would certainly appreciate and
consider printing any answers you
readers might offer concerning
Bundy's pong prowess. If he or
she who asked the question wants
to give us a hint as to its origins,
that's OK, too.
All the Bug knows is that he
saw the TV movie about Bundy,
"Deliberate Stranger," and that
at no time during the four-hour
drama did Bundy ever even pick
up a table tennis paddle or ball.

Dear Bug,
There's rumor going around
that a headless, limbless torso was
found on the altar of Memorial
Church in the early 19705? Is
there any truth to this?
— McMillan and Wife
Not quite, but close enough. A
body was found at 5:45 a.m. near
the altar of Memorial Church on
October 13, 1974. It was neither
headless, nor limbless, but the
details are quite unpleasant and

if you want them all, find out for
yourself.
The Bug will summarize ac
cording to The Daily's coverage
at the time. Don't bother looking
for jokes; there aren't any.
Arlis Perry, the 19-year-old wife
of Stanford sophomore Bruce Per
ry, died of a knife wound to the
back of her head sometime after
midnight on Sunday. A security
guard had locked the church up
at about 11:45 p.m. Saturday
night, and when he returned the
next morning, he found Perry's
body at the rear of the east tran
sept.
This murder was the fourth on
campus within two years, and the
case remains unsolved.
And speaking of murder. ..
Dear Bug,
Do you think Ted Bundy was
good at ping pong?
— Bob Newhart
Where the hell this question
came from I don't know, but it
sure is a good one. The Bug
doesn't really have an answer but
would certainly appreciate and
consider printing any answers you
readers might offer concerning
Bundy's pong prowess. If he or
she who asked the question wants
to give us a hint as to its origins,
that's OK, too.
All the Bug knows is that he
saw the TV movie about Bundy,
"Deliberate Stranger," and that
at no time during the four-hour
drama did Bundy ever even pick
up a table tennis paddle or ball.


Bug Me

Every week, it's the same
damned thing: "Do people really
write you those questions or do
you make them up?"
(Visualize a black television
screen. Spoken with great
patronization:)
"All right. Last time. (Now, pic
ture an 8,000-acre frying pan.)
This is Stanford. This is the Stan
ford on drugs. This is the column
where students can get their fried
egg-induced questions answered.
This is Bug Me. Got it?"
I'm not sure what that means,
but queries should be dropped off
in the Bug Me box outside the
Daily offices or sent via LOTS to
B.bug-me.
And now, what every red
blooded American wants to know:
Dear Bug,
Why is the Bug no longer fun
ny?
— Leo Buscaglia
That's a good question, and one
that has been bothering me for
some time now. Let's get together
and talk it over. Your opinion is
very important to me, and I'm
sure you could offer some valuable
pointers on how the Bug could
improve his work.
In the meantime, let me offer
these tips to you on how you can
better understand the Bug's rib
ticklin' ways:
• Keep a dictionary handy to look
up those words you've never heard
of; they may be vital to the

humorous notion being expressed.
• At the end of particularly long
paragraphs, take a rest — tired
lips breed careless reading.
• Do not pick your nose during
or directly after having read Bug
Me or any other Daily article.
Wash your fingers first as the ink
residue can leave embarrassing
black rings around your nostrils.
Dear Bug,
Where do our student ID num
bers come from ? My closest guess
is that the second digit represents
the year we enter, but all the other
numbers seem random.
— Doug Marlette
It's simple really.
Each ID number is seven digits

long. The first two digits are de
termined by subtracting either 59
or 60 from the year of your first
quarter at Stanford. Thus seniors'
numbers start with 36 or 35.
Each application pool, usually
about 15,000 people, is broken up
into groups of 100 according to
when the application was re
ceived. The third, fourth and fifth
digits of your ID number signify
which of these 150 groups to
which you were assigned. Thus a
senior whose application was re
ceived relatively early might be
No. 35008 xx.
Finally, the approximately
2,500 applicants per year who are
offered ad mission are split into
around 80 groups of 30 according
to merit. Thus a senior whose ap
plication was received relatively
early but was a borderline case
for admission might be No.
3500879.
And if you believe all that, be
sure to get your tickets soon for
next month's Beatles' reunion at
the Frost Amphitheater. Tickets
are general admission only and
can be purchased for $4.50 at all
Bass outlets.
