# Director of Asian-American center to resign full-time post next month
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
The first and only director of Stan
ford's Asian-American Activities Center
will quit next month, in part because
the University has never committed to
making his part-time position full time.
Julian Low, who also cited personal
reasons for his departure, will step down
April 7 but will continue working once
a week until a replacement is named,
as early as mid-May.
Low's resignation underscored the
concern held by the Asian-American
Students Association that Stanford has
failed to make a sufficient commitment
to their community. It comes less than
a month after the resignation of lecturer
Gordon Chang, the only person who
teaches an Asian-American studies class

here. Chang is leaving because Stanford
has no tenured position in Asian-
American studies.
Low's time at Stanford has been
marked by disagreement with the Uni
versity over the time status of his po
sition. Though he has been paid for
three-fourths time, student staffers at
the center said he worked near full time
and deserved more.
Michael Jackson, the assistant dean
of Student Affairs who is responsible
for hiring Low's replacement, told The
Daily yesterday he hopes the new di
rector will have a full-time position, but
said "I don't have any guarantee of
that."
But sophomore Judy Wu, who was
part of an AASA group that met with
Jackson recently, said Jackson "pretty
much guaranteed a permanent, full-time

dean" position for Low's successor.
Low was hired in October 1987 on
half-time status, but students were con
cerned that he was working much more
than he was paid for.
Last summer, student staffers at the
center successfully petitioned the Uni
versity to increase Low's position to
three-fourths time status.
Low is leaving to take a job with a
media production firm in San Francisco,
and he says he is making the switch
primarily for personal reasons. His new
job is in a field that is his "first interest"
and is located much closer to his home.
But he said he was put in an "un
comfortable position" last summer and
added that the ongoing debate created
an "instability that hasn't helped." The
instability contributed to his de
cision to leave, he said.
Jackson would not comment on
why Low's position was not made
full time.
AASA representatives met with
Jackson over the last week to ne
gotiate the process for finding
Low's replacement.
"We were really worried before
that [Jackson] was going to ap
point someone from within Stan
ford as a replacement for spring
quarter," AASA member Wu said,
adding that having a temporary
replacement would create a dis
continuity in the center. Jackson
agreed to keep Low on as a con
su! tant.
An 11-member selection com
mittee, including five representa
tives of the AASA, was organized
to begin a national search.

The committee is being headed
by Asst. Dean of Residential Af
fairs Jean Kim. Jackson has se
lected five faculty members to
serve on the committee, and five
students will be elected from
AASA's ranks to participate in the
search.
Students said Low's leaving will
be a significant loss to the Asian-
American community because of
the time and enthusiasm he has
invested at the center.
"He does almost everything ...
it's a real loss," Wu said. Low has
been involved in activities from
planning programs to counseling
students with personal problems,
she said.
Jackson praised Low for creat
ing new programs at the center,
which used to be run just by stu
dent volunteers.
"He's helped develop a very
good foundation for further de
velopment," Jackson said. "He's
done a superb job at getting people
excited about programs there."
