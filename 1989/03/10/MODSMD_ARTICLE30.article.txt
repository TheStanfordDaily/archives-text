## Card hoops conquers Women of Troy, 100-85 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
A nationwide ESPN audience
and a vocal 2,925 fans at Maples
Pavilion learned a valuable lesson
of sports last night: Basketball is,
indeed, a team sport.
Though USC's Cherie Nelson
scored a phenomenal 35 points, it
was the team play of the Stanford
women's basketball team and the
potent pair of Jennifer Azzi and
Trisha Stevens that yielded a 100-
85 win in last night's late contest.
Women's Basketball
Cardinal 100, Women of Troy 85
The victory increases Pacific 10
Conference champion Stanford's
winning streak to 19 straight, in
cluding all 17 Pac-10 games. With
a 25-2 record overall and a solid
No. 4 rating in the Associated
Press poll, Stanford may well have
sealed the top seed of the West
Region in next week's NCAA
Tournament.
"It was a very good team effort
with some exceptional individual
effort from Jennifer and Trisha,"
Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer
said. "We just had some key bas
kets — Katy [Stedingl's three,
Julie (Zeilstra) coming in and hit
ting two open shots.
"But I was disappointed with
our defense. They were a little
more aggressive, taking the ball
out of people's hands. I thought
we gave them some easy baskets."
True, but the Stanford offense
more than compensated. Led by
Azzi's 25 points and Stevens' 22,
the Cardinal countered every USC
surge and maintained at least an

eight-point cushion throughout
the second half.
In the first half especially,
Stevens was unstoppable. Shoot
ing primarily from the right side,
the Women of Troy found no ef
fective way to contain her. The
sophomore broke through screens
and scored layups as if the
defenders weren't there and
drained some key 10-foot shots.
"Our post people and our
guards really complimented each
other," Stevens said. "They
couldn't take off and help on the
post people inside because Jenni
fer, Sonja, Katy and the other
forwards were bombing away
from outside."
Especially Azzi. Shooting 8-for
-11 from the floor — including a
stellar 4-for-5 from 3-point land
— and 5-for-6 from the line, Azzi
was an offensive force.
But scoring was only a small
part of her contribution. The
junior guard pulled down six

rebounds, committed five steals
and dished out a season-high
tying 12 assists for her sixth
double-double of the year.
With her parents watching her
play via ESPN, Azzi gave the en
tire audience — and any All-
America team electors — a showf
to remember.
"I don't think we played as well
as we could play, but I think we
played well," Azzi said. "Trisha
played really well inside — if it
wasn't for her, there's no way I
would have had the outside shots
that I had."
The big scorer was Nelson, how
ever, as she arched shots high over
the Cardinal defenders' hands.
The 1988 Pac-10 Player of the
Year shot 12-for-21 from the field,
5-for-10 from the line, and
grabbed a game-high 14 rebounds
to secure her spot in the double
double club.


Michael Topolovac — Daily
Junior guard Jennifer Azzi (10), here executing one of her five steals, shot 8-of-11 from the floor,
4-of-5 from outside the three-point arc and 5-of-6 from the charity stripe for 25 points.
Held to only 10 points in the
first half, Nelson took charge in
the second. Shooting almost every
time she got the ball in USC's
side of the court, only Zeilstra
seemed to have any impact defen
sively, but not enough to stop her.
"I just don't think we played
really smart on her," VanDerveer
said. "We did a good job in the
beginning, but then we didn't
stick with it and double-in as
much as we should have."
— The fans did not seem to be
_ perturbed, however, as they glee

fully watched Stanford run off its
second-straight triple-figure game
and its fifth 90-plus point outing
in as many tries.
It wasn't until the very end,
with less than 10 seconds remain
ing, that the Cardinal broke the
century mark. Emily Wagner and
Martha Richards each stepped up
to the free throw line with Stan
ford's score at 98, but each missed
the front end of a 1-and-l.
With the clock reading 0:02 and
the crowd on its feet, Ann Adkins
toed the line after being fouled
by Bolivia Gayton. The first and
second shots swished; the team
and the fans went wild.
"I was just really trying to con
centrate on the basket and put

everything else like television and**
100 th point out of my mind," Ad-£
kins recalled. "I just
on my follow through, like I've!/
been working on all week in
tice, and putting it in. %
"The first one went in, and for*s
the second one I told myself thatvj
I have to do the same thing. l 9
did, and it fell right in for me. I|
was really happy."
