## 
### 
TONIGHT — 8:30 p m. tipoff at Maples Pavilion
RECORDS — Stanford (25-2, 17-0 and first in Pac-10 play, ranked fourth
by AP), UCLA (12-14, 8-8 and tied for fourth).
SERIES — UCLA leads the series by a whopping 16-2 margin, though
Stanford gained one of the wins at the start of the season with a 73 71
victory in Wooden Center Last season, however, the Bruins were the
only team to sweep the Cardinal
BRUIN UPDATE — UCLA split last weekend with the Oregon schools at
home, losing to the Ducks 76-60 but beating the Beavers 77-61. Forward
Sandra VanEmbricqs remains the team s leading scorer and rebounder
at 13.9 points and eight boards per game, followed by freshman center
Molly Tideback s 13 ppg.
KEYS TO VICTORY — Down at Wooden Center, UCLA gave the Cardinal
its toughest game of the season, thanks to the Bruins' consistent rebound
ing and Tideback's 20-point performance. Stanford will need to key on
her while handling VanEmbricqs. With these players under wraps, the
Cardinal should have little difficulty ending the season with perfect Pac-10
and Maples Pavilion records.
