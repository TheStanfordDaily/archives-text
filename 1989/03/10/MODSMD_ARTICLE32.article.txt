INGLEWOOD, Calif. -
Nothing too surprising hap
pened at the first day of the
Pacific 10 Conference men's
basketball tournament.
Only 4,830 people showed up
at the 17,505-seat Great West
ern Forum to see the prelimi
nary games, which included
hometown not-so-favorite
USC.
Arizona State and Oregon,
teams entering the tournament
with long losing streaks, did
not snap out of their respective
lethargies.
Todd Lichti became the first
four-time all-conference selec
tion in 13 years.
Stanford's senior guard was
joined by teammate Howard
Wright, himself a two- time
honoree, on the 10-man All-
Pacific 10 squad, which was an
nounced yesterday. Lichti and
Wright will get a chance to
shine on the court as they lead
the Cardinal against USC
tonight at 7 p.m.
Joining Lichti and Wright on
the Pac-10 team is Sean Elliott
of Arizona, who also became

the first two-time Pac-10
Player of the Year since
UCLA's David Greenwood in
1977-78 and 1978-79.
Arizona's Anthony Cook,
Oregon State's Gary Payton,
Washington's Eldridge Recas
ner, UCLA's Pooh Richardson
and Trevor Wilson, California's
Leonard Taylor and ASU's
Trent Edwards round out the
squad.
Edwards, the Pac-10's
leading rebounder, was held to
only two as USC stormed past
the Sun Devils to a 46-29
halftime lead and coasted
thereafter to earn the right to
play Stanford tonight.
USC guard Anthony
Pendleton had 22 points, all in
the first half, and teammate
Chris Moore led all scorers
with 31 as the Trojans sent
ASU to its fifth straight loss.
