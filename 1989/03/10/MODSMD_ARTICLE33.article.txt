# Stanford will win national titles... again
## 
### 
And the members of this
year's Evan Tuchinsky All-
America Team are. . .
Just kidding. With the men's
basketball season recently con
cluded and the excitement of the
NCAA Tournament rapidly ap
proaching, every sports writer
that has watched at least one
game this season has ventured
some sort of All-America, All-
Conference or All-Washed-Up
Team to celebrate the occasion.
Enough is enough. By now,
everyone who has spent more than
two hours per day exhibiting signs
of consciousness has heard names
like Sean Elliott and Stacey King
more than should be legally al
lowed.
Thus, rather than take a hack
neyed glance on the past season,
it is time to look ahead. Get your
pencils and papers ready — it's
time for The Cognizant Man's
Betting Guide to NCAA Titles.
Since I've been at Stanford
(four long years, including this
one), NCAA championships have
become a school staple. With 11
earned in the past three years,
Stanford has set the standard for
intercollegiate athletic excellence.
Thus, as an aid to any wagers
that may be placed, here is a run
down of the likely gold-bringers,
listed in the order of probability.

(Note: The Daily assumes no re
sponsibility for any financial in
solvency resulting from inept pre
dictions of its columnists. Sorry,
that's just the way it is.)
•Women's Tennis — guaranteed.
Nothing is certain in this world
— except for the tennis team. In
the history of the NCAA, never
has a group so talented been as
sembled at one school.
From top to bottom, there are
no slouches on the team. Any of
the top four players could play
No. 1 singles here and still win
most every match. No other team
can make that claim.
The netters will cruise through
the season undefeated and claim
Stanford's fourth straight title.
That's just the way it is.
•Women's Swimming — likely.

Coach Richard Quick won five
straight titles at Texas as well as
coaching the 1988 U.S. Olympic
Team; he is a man not accustomed
to losing, and probably won't have
to acclimate to it this year.
More Stanford swimmers qual
ified for the NCAA meet than are
allowed to compete, and the diving
corps is stronger than ever — an
unbeatable combination. Bet
liberally.
•Women's Basketball — possible.
I'll admit that I am a little partial
to these folks by association, as I
have covered the Cardinal for two
years. However, after watching
Texas, the fourth seed in the
women's volleyball Final Four,
knock off top-ranked UCLA and
defending champ Hawaii for its
first title ever, I believe the Car
dinal cagers have a chance to win
it all.
No one in the country boasts a
stronger bench; like the tennis
team, every member is a star.
Coupled with the momentum of
an undefeated Pac-10 season and
the consistent excellence of Jen
nifer Azzi, Sonja Henning, Katy
Steding and Trisha Stevens, the
team may surprise a lot of people
come tourney time.
•Men's Gymnastics — possible.

Another talent-laden team. With
U.S. National Team members
Conrad Voorsanger and Tim Ryan
spearheading an experienced
lineup, including championship
veterans Andy Ropp and Scott
Schaffer, the team should
definitely be among the top three
teams vying for the title in the
NCAA finals.
•Men's Volleyball — possible. The
team is solidly on top of the West
ern Intercollegiate Volleyball As
sociation, the toughest league in
any sport, and is the No. 1 team
in the country. Stanford also has
two strong NCAA Player of the
Year candidates in Scott Fortune
and Dan Hanan. Put the two to
gether and Stanford's first volley
ball championship is a makeable
do.
•Men's Basketball — conceivable.
Nothing would be more rewarding
than to see Stanford cap off an
amazing season with a national
title. Nothing.
After watching Danny Manning
single-handedly earn Kansas the
NCAA crown, it became obvious
that one man can make a differ
ence. Todd Lichti, with the benefit
of a stronger supporting cast than
Manning had, could do the same
this year.
