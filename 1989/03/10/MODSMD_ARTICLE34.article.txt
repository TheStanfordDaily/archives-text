# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Spearheading the Stanford men's volley
ball team's first-ever No. 1 ranking, middle
blocker Scott Fortune joins Sandra Birch as
our Athletes of the Week.
Fortune, a senior from Laguna Beach,
Calif., lead the spikers last week with 46
kills in a 3-0 Western Intercollegiate Volley
ball Association win over the No. 3-ranked
Gauchos of UC-Santa Barbara, 24 of which
were in the final game alone.
In addition to his .506 hitting average for
the match, the 6-foot-6 former Olympian
tallied six blocks and 17 digs.

For his efforts, Fortune was awarded the
Molten/WFVA Athlete of the Week award.
Fortune's efforts led the men's volleyball
team to the top of the AVCA/Tachikara Poll
after conference rival and formerly top
ranked UCLA was upset by USC. This
marks the first time that the Cardinal men's
volleyball team has been ranked No. 1.
Fortune and the spikers currently boast
a WIVA record of 10-1 and are 12-2 overall.
Fortune's hot hand will be needed on March
25 when the Cardinal faces 16th-ranked
Ohio State. Stanford will face the Bruins
at Maple Pavilion on April 15.

Sophomore Sandra Birch, from Hunting
ton Bay, N.Y., wins the Athlete of the Week
award for her performance in the National
Team Indoor Championships last weekend
in Madison, Wis. Playing at the No. 2 slot
for Coach Frank Brennan's top-ranked Car
dinal netters, Birch led the team to victories
over No. 2-ranked Florida, eight-ranked In
diana and UCI^A.
Last Sunday, Birch beat Florida's Ingelise
Driehuis 6-2, 7-5 in helping secure the Car
dinal's 6-0 shutout victory of Florida in the
finals of the National Team Indoors. In the
semifinals, Birch sailed over UCLA's Alisa
May 6-4, 7-5.
On Friday against Indiana's Stephanie
Reece, Birch dropped only one set on her
way to a 6-1, 6-0 victory.
Birch's three-win weekend highlighted the
tennis team's dominant weekend in Wiscon
sin. On their way to the championship, the
women won 23 of the 24 singles matches
they played, including 19 straight-set vic
tories.

The prowess that the team displayed over
other highly ranked teams has convinced
many that the Cardinal will be unchallenged
in its quest for a fourth consecutive national
tennis title.
Birch's contribution to the tennis team,
last weekend at the No. 2 slot, will have as
much to do with the team's future successes
and a possible national title as it did last
weekend.
Birch and the talent-laden Cardinal will
face off this weekend against the Wildcats
of Arizona.
