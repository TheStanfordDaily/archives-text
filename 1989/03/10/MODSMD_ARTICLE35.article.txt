# Swimmers on top at Pac-10s
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
The championship form has re
turned.
After only the first day of com
petition, the men's swim team is
on its way to its eighth consecu
tive Pacific 10 title. With one
third of the meet completed, Stan
ford has already swum away with
the lead, cruising to a 76-point
cushion over second place UCLA,
316 to 240.
During its weakest day of com
petition of the three day meet,
the Cardinal has already set a
new American record and quali
fied an additional 11 swimmers
for national finals, bringing its
NCAA-bound competitors total to
eleven. And the best is yet to
comp.
"This wasn't even our best day,"
senior freestyler John Hodge said.
"Friday we have seven events, in
cluding the new relays and all the
100s. We should place a lot of
people."
In its first competition ever, the
200 yard freestyle relay team
(competing in an event just in
stituted this season) clocked the
fastest splits of the year. The
squad of Doug Lillydahl, Byron
Burson, Hodge and Jeff Garr not
only won the race, but set a new
American record of 1:19.18 in
doing so.
On the individual scene the Car
dinal was no less impressive,
clocking personal best times and
placing a number of swimmers.
"Everybody swam really well and
we got some fantastic swims from

some people we didn't even ex
pect," Hodge said.
Two of the unexpected swims
came from freshmen Kevin Hen
derson and Andy Lloyd who
posted qualifying times in the 200
individual medley, a weak event
for both. Teammate Matt
Rodgers, a breaststroke specialist,
dropped this season's time by
more than four and a half
seconds, to a personal best of
1:48.2, to qualify by more than a
second in the same event.
Co-captain John Witchell placed
second in the 500 free, posting a
sub-NCAA standard time in doing
so.
Garr finished second in the 50
free, .19 seconds below the sprint
standard. And the medley relay
team clocked an incredible 3:14.6,
the same time it swam at NCAAs
last season.
But amazing first day or not,
the Cardinal is not about to slack
off now. It plans on only increas
ing its intensity today and tomor
row in Long Beach.
In fact, this morning's prelim
inaries are the squad's main con
cern, as the second morning of
competition usually determines
the national champion at the
NCAA meet. And, according to
Hodge, the team has another mo
tivation for showing its stuff for
the next two days.
"We want to qualify as many
people as we can .. . and we want
to swim as fast aa we can to prove
ourselves to Texas. If we can out
score them now, on the conference
meet level, maybe they'll get a
little intimidated."
