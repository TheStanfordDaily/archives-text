# Struggling baseball faces favored 'Cats
## 
### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
With his team at 1-5 in the Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division, Stan
ford baseball Coach Mark Marquess
promises to pull out all the stops this
weekend in Tucson, Ariz., where the
Cardinal (11-13) faces a grueling three
game set against Six-Pac favorite Ari
zona (18-6, 5-1 in the Pac-10).
"I personally picked them to win the
league. They've got the best offensive
team in the conference," Marquess said.
"They have a lot of returning players.
The only question was their pitching,
and they seem to be getting that."
Marquess expects the Wildcats to be
the toughest test of the season for Car
dinal pitching, and Stanford will tackle
the 'Cats without the services of top
starter Mike Mussina, who did not make
the trip to Tucson.
"He has a tendon in his pitching elbow
that needs some rest. It's just stretched
and inflamed. He should be alright in
two weeks. He'll be ready for UCLA
(Mar. 25-26)," Marquess said.
With Mussina at home, Marquess'
third starter will likely be either senior
Brian Keyser or junior Mark Carper.
At the start of the year, Keyser was
the third starter behind Mussina and
Stan Spencer but pitched poorly and
dropped out of the rotation. After five
strong innings against Santa Clara on
Tuesday, he is back in business.
Carper put himself into contention
with some solid relief work in last week
end's sweep by Arizona State and Tues
day's win over the Broncos.
However, if relief ace Steve Chitren
does not appear in the first two games
of the series, he will likely start Sun-

day's contest. Chitren started one game
in all of 1988.
"If I have a chance to win the first
two games, he'll be in there. If not,
he's our next best pitcher, so he'll go
on Sunday," Marquess said.
"In the first two games, I don't want
to hold anybody out in the seventh or
eighth inning if they match up pretty
well. If they match up well, I'll throw
Keyser or Carper," he added.
It's no holds barred for Marquess as
he tries to turn the Cardinal around.
His concern is getting a lead for
his pitchers, who have walked a tight
rope all season as Stanford has floun
dered at the plate.
"We're not giving our pitchers much
backing. They're pitching tentatively.
We need to get them a couple runs, so
they can pitch ahead a little bit," Mar
quess said. "You don't need a lot. If we

get a three- or four-run lead, they'll
know a mistake won't hurt them as
much. They've been pitching defensive
ly."
Sophomore Stan Spencer, who will
likely start tomorrow, has been the Car
dinal's primary hard-luck pitcher. A per
fect example is his performance against
California two weekends ago. He shut
out the Bears through IVz innings, but
Stanford bats could muster only one
run and his lead vanished in the eighth
and ninth.
The other starter will be sophomore
Scott Weiss, who pitched very well
against Cal two weekends ago but
struggled in his start last weekend
against Arizona State. His performance
and the performance of the third starter
will go a long way in determining the
Cardinal's success this weekend.
