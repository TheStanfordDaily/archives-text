WILDCAT UPDATE — The Cats are powered offensively by designated hitter Rick Lantrip
(batting .356 with 3 home runs and 20 runs batted in) and catcher Alan Zinter (.356,
10 HR, 35 RBI). Left fielder Todd Devereaux and first baseman J.T. Snow are both
hitting over .300 and have added 20 RBI each. Ace reliever David Blake has compiled
a stellar 2-0 record with three saves and an immaculate 0.50 earned-run average.
CARDINAL UPDATE -Freshman David McCarty has earned the starting spot at first
base with good performances against ASU and Santa Clara. David Holbrook has
recovered from a ground ball that caught him on the cheekbone last weekend and
will be the designated hitter or first baseman. Stanford Coach Mark Marquess feels
Holbrook and second baseman Frank Carey have been the most consistent hitters
on the team this season. Marquess is hoping most of all for increased production
from veterans Paul Carey and Troy Paulsen, the No. 2 and 3 hitters. If they can
break out offensively, maybe the Cardinal will be able to stake its pitchers to the
three- and four-run leads Marquess covets.
