## Gymnasts face top-ranked UCLA 
### 
Tomorrow night's Stanford-UCLA men's
gymnastics meet at Pauley Pavilion in Los
Angeles will pit two of the nation's top five
teams against each other. However, neither
team really cares who wins.
This is Stanford's last regular season com
petition, with the Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionships and the 12-team NCAA meet to
follow. Both the Cardinal and the Bruins are
sure to be invited to the NCAAs and both are
guilty of looking beyond tomorrow's meet to
the collegiate championships, to be held April
14-16.
"It's gonna be a dogfight (at NCAAs),"
UCLA Coach Art Shurlock said. "Stanford is
coming on like gangbusters and we're fighting
like crazy to stay ahead of them."
And they're not staying ahead by much.
These two teams met twice last week, with
the Bruins winning both contests by a com
bined total of 1.15 points, the equivalent of a
few minor errors — perhaps two wobbly hand
stands and a couple steps to balance a landing.
Cardinal Coach Sadao Hamada is satisfied
with his team's accomplishments during the
dual meet schedule and is preparing them to
peak at the national championships.
"This year, we can really go after the
NCAAs," Hamada said. "My strategy is to go
all out for the championship."
In the meantime, seniors Scott Schaffer and
Andy Ropp are going all out to finish their
collegiate careers in grand fashion.
Schaffer has been especially impressive of
late. In his Maples Pavilion finale last Friday,
he won both the vault and the parallel bars,
each by a considerable margin over the rest
of the meet's gymnasts.
The key to tomorrow evening's competition
will be how each team compensates for the
injuries and illness which have depleted its
depth. Both coaches, though, will sacrifice
points now in order to save their gymnasts
strength for later.
UCLA is without freshman Chaney
Umphrey and will have to rely on clutch
performances from its veterans as it did last
week. On Mar. 1, Umphrey tore ligaments in
his ankle, ending what had been a sterling
first year for the nation's top recruit.
Stanford's Charles Loop scored a career best
in taking second all-around last week but has
been weakened by the flu this week. Co-captain
Adam Forman has also been unable to train
at top strength and cannot be counted on for
top scores.
