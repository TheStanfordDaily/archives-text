## Gymnasts face top-ranked UCLA 
### 
Tomorrow night's Stanford-UCLA men's
gymnastics meet at Pauley Pavilion in Los
Angeles will pit two of the nation's top five
teams against each other. However, neither
team really cares who wins.
This is Stanford's last regular season com
petition, with the Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionships and the 12-team NCAA meet to
follow. Both the Cardinal and the Bruins are
sure to be invited to the NCAAs and both are
guilty of looking beyond tomorrow's meet to
the collegiate championships, to be held April
14-16.
"It's gonna be a dogfight (at NCAAs),"
UCLA Coach Art Shurlock said. "Stanford is
coming on like gangbusters and we're fighting
like crazy to stay ahead of them."
And they're not staying ahead by much.
These two teams met twice last week, with
the Bruins winning both contests by a com
bined total of 1.15 points, the equivalent of a
few minor errors — perhaps two wobbly hand
stands and a couple steps to balance a landing.
Cardinal Coach Sadao Hamada is satisfied
with his team's accomplishments during the
dual meet schedule and is preparing them to
peak at the national championships.
"This year, we can really go after the
NCAAs," Hamada said. "My strategy is to go
all out for the championship."
In the meantime, seniors Scott Schaffer and
Andy Ropp are going all out to finish their
collegiate careers in grand fashion.
Schaffer has been especially impressive of
late. In his Maples Pavilion finale last Friday,
he won both the vault and the parallel bars,
each by a considerable margin over the rest
of the meet's gymnasts.
The key to tomorrow evening's competition
will be how each team compensates for the
injuries and illness which have depleted its
depth. Both coaches, though, will sacrifice
points now in order to save their gymnasts
strength for later.
UCLA is without freshman Chaney
Umphrey and will have to rely on clutch
performances from its veterans as it did last
week. On Mar. 1, Umphrey tore ligaments in
his ankle, ending what had been a sterling
first year for the nation's top recruit.
Stanford's Charles Loop scored a career best
in taking second all-around last week but has
been weakened by the flu this week. Co-captain
Adam Forman has also been unable to train
at top strength and cannot be counted on for
top scores.

looking for another victory and
they are the favorites heading into
the weekend tournament.
The quest for a sixth consecu
tive title will not be an easy one.
Tough competition should come
from UC-Santa Cruz. In two pre
vious competitions between the
two teams this season, the Stan
ford team escaped with narrow
victories, including an 8-8 match
decided in favor of Stanford on
total touches.
Last year the Cardinal faced
Santa Cruz in the regional final.
Other opponents this year include
Air Force, Long Beach State, San
Diego and Fullerton State.
The Cardinal team will also be
without starting fencer Juliet
Johnson. The absence of the
senior is sure to hurt the team
— even with Stanford's depth of
talent — because of the loss to
the continuity of the team.
Johnson suffered a knee injury
earlier in the season and was on
the road to recovery when she
reinjured it in a recent tourna
ment.
But the team has performed
nearly flawlessly even without
Johnson, dominating nearly every
opponent. Ann Marsh has stepped
in to fill Johnson's position and

has done an excellent job, accord
ing to her teammates and Pos
thumus.
"Ann is looking really hot,"
teammate Tracy Schmidt said.
Starting fencers are Elisabeth
Spilman, Olivia Judson, Grace
Chang, Schmidt and Marsh. They
will participate in a team compe
tition on Saturday before moving
on to the individual champion
ships on Sunday.
A tribute to the team's depth
of talent can be seen in Pos
thumus' assessment that "all of
the girls have a shot at qualifying
for the individual NCAA tourna
ment."

Track and field to
competes at NCAAs
Stanford track and field will
mark both a beginning and an
end this weekend.
The Cardinal hosts the Stanford
Quint Meet Saturday to officially
begin the outdoor season while,
the same day, Lisa Bernhagen and
Brian Marshall finish their final
season of eligibility in the NCAA
Indoor Championships at In
dianapolis.
Stanford's home meet will be
against Navy, San Francisco
State, the College of Notre Dame
and Cal State Hayward. Most of

the track and field team will com
pete at Stanford Stadium, with
the Cardinal looking strong in the
distance runs, the women's
sprints and the men's throwing
events.
Bernhagen will be in a familiar
spot in the high jump at In
dianapolis. "I'm shooting to win,"
she said. A four-time All-
American jumper, she has been a
threat to win every season since
her freshman year five years ago.
With her final season of eligibility
running out, however, tomorrow
will be her last chance to win an
elusive national championship.
"It's hard to judge your prog
ress because there are so few in
door meets," she said. But good
practices and a solid 6-foot, 1-inch
qualifying mark have been cause
for optimism. Past experience has
shown that the high jump goes
to whoever performs best on meet
day, and Bernhagen certainly has
the talent to beat anyone.
She going into the meet with
mixed emotions. "There have
been a lot of ups and downs" over
her career on the Farm, she said.
In 1987, coming off a strong in
door season, she shattered the in

door collegiate high jump record
by two inches with a jump of 6
feet, sVfc inches.
However, her season was cut
short when she injured her foot
warming up for a meet. That
record-breaking form has proved
difficult to recapture.
"Of course you're sad when you
go," she added, but it can be a
relief. "It's been not just five but
12 years of jumping" along with
the pressure of setting records at
the junior high, high school and
college level.
If history is any guide, Ber
hagen will close out her season
soaring over the tallest spectators
in a single bound.
Brian Marshall has been the
other half of the high jumping
duo. A coterminal student in eco
nomics, he also is on his final
season of eligibility.
A last-minute qualifier for the
NCAA meet, he cleared 7 feet,
3V4 inches at a "last-chance" meet
last weekend in Colorado. He has
a good chance at All-American
honors when he jumps Saturday.

The quest for a sixth consecu

Tough competition should come
from UC-Santa Cruz. In two pre
vious competitions between the
two teams this season, the Stan
ford team escaped with narrow
victories, including an 8-8 match
decided in favor of Stanford on
total touches.
Last year the Cardinal faced
Santa Cruz in the regional final.
Other opponents this year include
Air Force, Long Beach State, San
Diego and Fullerton State.
The Cardinal team will also be
without starting fencer Juliet
Johnson. The absence of the
senior is sure to hurt the team
— even with Stanford's depth of
talent — because of the loss to
the continuity of the team.
Johnson suffered a knee injury
earlier in the season and was on
the road to recovery when she
reinjured it in a recent tourna

But the team has performed
nearly flawlessly even without
Johnson, dominating nearly every
opponent. Ann Marsh has stepped
in to fill Johnson's position and

has done an excellent job, accord

Starting fencers are Elisabeth

Track and field to
competes at NCAAs
Stanford track and field will
mark both a beginning and an
end this weekend.
The Cardinal hosts the Stanford
Quint Meet Saturday to officially
begin the outdoor season while,
the same day, Lisa Bernhagen and
Brian Marshall finish their final
season of eligibility in the NCAA
Indoor Championships at In
dianapolis.
Stanford's home meet will be
against Navy, San Francisco
State, the College of Notre Dame
and Cal State Hayward. Most of

the track and field team will com
pete at Stanford Stadium, with
the Cardinal looking strong in the
distance runs, the women's
sprints and the men's throwing
events.
Bernhagen will be in a familiar
spot in the high jump at In
dianapolis. "I'm shooting to win,"
she said. A four-time All-
American jumper, she has been a
threat to win every season since
her freshman year five years ago.
With her final season of eligibility
running out, however, tomorrow
will be her last chance to win an
elusive national championship.
"It's hard to judge your prog
ress because there are so few in
door meets," she said. But good
practices and a solid 6-foot, 1-inch
qualifying mark have been cause
for optimism. Past experience has
shown that the high jump goes
to whoever performs best on meet
day, and Bernhagen certainly has
the talent to beat anyone.
She going into the meet with
mixed emotions. "There have
been a lot of ups and downs" over
her career on the Farm, she said.
In 1987, coming off a strong in
door season, she shattered the in

door collegiate high jump record
by two inches with a jump of 6
feet, sVfc inches.
However, her season was cut
short when she injured her foot
warming up for a meet. That
record-breaking form has proved
difficult to recapture.
"Of course you're sad when you
go," she added, but it can be a
relief. "It's been not just five but
12 years of jumping" along with
the pressure of setting records at
the junior high, high school and
college level.
If history is any guide, Ber
hagen will close out her season
soaring over the tallest spectators
in a single bound.
Brian Marshall has been the
other half of the high jumping
duo. A coterminal student in eco
nomics, he also is on his final
season of eligibility.
A last-minute qualifier for the
NCAA meet, he cleared 7 feet,
3V4 inches at a "last-chance" meet
last weekend in Colorado. He has
a good chance at All-American
honors when he jumps Saturday.

Tomorrow night's Stanford-UCLA men's
gymnastics meet at Pauley Pavilion in Los
Angeles will pit two of the nation's top five
teams against each other. However, neither
team really cares who wins.
This is Stanford's last regular season com
petition, with the Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionships and the 12-team NCAA meet to
follow. Both the Cardinal and the Bruins are
sure to be invited to the NCAAs and both are
guilty of looking beyond tomorrow's meet to
the collegiate championships, to be held April
14-16.
"It's gonna be a dogfight (at NCAAs),"
UCLA Coach Art Shurlock said. "Stanford is
coming on like gangbusters and we're fighting
like crazy to stay ahead of them."
And they're not staying ahead by much.
These two teams met twice last week, with
the Bruins winning both contests by a com
bined total of 1.15 points, the equivalent of a
few minor errors — perhaps two wobbly hand
stands and a couple steps to balance a landing.
Cardinal Coach Sadao Hamada is satisfied
with his team's accomplishments during the
dual meet schedule and is preparing them to
peak at the national championships.
"This year, we can really go after the
NCAAs," Hamada said. "My strategy is to go
all out for the championship."
In the meantime, seniors Scott Schaffer and
Andy Ropp are going all out to finish their
collegiate careers in grand fashion.
Schaffer has been especially impressive of
late. In his Maples Pavilion finale last Friday,
he won both the vault and the parallel bars,
each by a considerable margin over the rest
of the meet's gymnasts.
The key to tomorrow evening's competition
will be how each team compensates for the
injuries and illness which have depleted its
depth. Both coaches, though, will sacrifice
points now in order to save their gymnasts
strength for later.
UCLA is without freshman Chaney
Umphrey and will have to rely on clutch
performances from its veterans as it did last
week. On Mar. 1, Umphrey tore ligaments in
his ankle, ending what had been a sterling
first year for the nation's top recruit.
