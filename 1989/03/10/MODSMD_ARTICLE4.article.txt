# Columnist slams media for pandering to elites
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Editorial staff 
With biting sarcasm, press
critic and columnist Alexander
Cockburn last night chided the
American mass media for "ex
cluding and rearranging reality"
and "kowtowing" to an elitist
U.S. government.
Speaking in Kresge Audito
rium at the kickoff event of Cen
tral America Week, Cockburn,
who writes for The Wall Street
Journal, The Nation, Atlantic
Monthly and In These Times,
criticized the privately owned
mainstream press for catering
to the whims and beliefs of its
owners who "want their money
to be worth it."
"How long do you think Tom
Brokaw would last if he issued
nightly critiques of General
Electric weapons?" Cockburn
asked the audience, referring to
General Electric's ownership of

NBC.
One of the most important
roles the press plays is
"demonizing" the Soviet Union
in order to justify massive de
fense spending, Cockburn said,
"It's easy to vote dollars to beat
the demon."
Stories like the Soviet shoot
ing down of a Korean Airlines
civilian airliner help create this
demonic image, he said, adding
that the media does not refer
too much to that event since the
United States shot down an
Iranian airbus.
The media is generally guilty
of several tactics to build support
for the views of the administra
tion and the elites, he said.
Mainstream media often creates
an "imaginary public" and as
sumes it understands the wishes
of this public.

Columnist and press critic Alexander Cockburn spoke last night
about how the media distorts reality. Cockburn delivered his
speech on the media and politics in Kresge Auditorium to a
crowd of 250.
dal, Cockburn explained, the press
asserted that nobody was inter
ested in the trauma of another
Watergate, and nobody wanted
Reagan to fail. On the contrary,
according to Cockburn, "many,
many people longed" for another
Watergate, and millions wanted
to see Reagan humiliated.
The press also engages in an
"invention of consent," Cockburn
said, pointing to the supposed
"landslides" with which Reagan
won the 1980 and 1984 elections.
In actuality, he won with only 28
and 34 percent of the eligible
votes, according to Cockburn.
Cockburn disagreed with the
popular view that the Cold War
is over, and capitalism won. When
the press announced this victory,
Cockburn said, they did not take
into account the rest of the world,

such as Africa or Latin America.
"Venezuelans are not running
down the road shouting 'Long live
the [International Monetary
Fund],"' he said.
In addition, the scarce coverage
that the press gives to the Third
World leads to such oversight, he
said, reminding the audience that
silence is one of the media's best
weapons.
The New York Times has only
three reporters covering all of
Africa — "one for the top, one
for the middle and one for the
bottom," Cockburn said. If there
were only three journalists cover
ing the entire United States,
people might think they are "not
really going to get the full story,"
he added.
Media events like Liberty Week
end, the Los Angeles Olympics
and the invasion of Grenada,
which Cockburn referred to as
"electronic Nuremburg rallies,"
also help arouse public consent,
he said.
