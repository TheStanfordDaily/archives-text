# Columnist slams media for pandering to elites
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Editorial staff 
With biting sarcasm, press
critic and columnist Alexander
Cockburn last night chided the
American mass media for "ex
cluding and rearranging reality"
and "kowtowing" to an elitist
U.S. government.
Speaking in Kresge Audito
rium at the kickoff event of Cen
tral America Week, Cockburn,
who writes for The Wall Street
Journal, The Nation, Atlantic
Monthly and In These Times,
criticized the privately owned
mainstream press for catering
to the whims and beliefs of its
owners who "want their money
to be worth it."
"How long do you think Tom
Brokaw would last if he issued
nightly critiques of General
Electric weapons?" Cockburn
asked the audience, referring to
General Electric's ownership of

NBC.
One of the most important
roles the press plays is
"demonizing" the Soviet Union
in order to justify massive de
fense spending, Cockburn said,
"It's easy to vote dollars to beat
the demon."
Stories like the Soviet shoot
ing down of a Korean Airlines
civilian airliner help create this
demonic image, he said, adding
that the media does not refer
too much to that event since the
United States shot down an
Iranian airbus.
The media is generally guilty
of several tactics to build support
for the views of the administra
tion and the elites, he said.
Mainstream media often creates
an "imaginary public" and as
sumes it understands the wishes
of this public.
