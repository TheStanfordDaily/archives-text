Just like the United States Pos
tal Service.
Yesterday neither rain nor sleet
nor dark of night kept the Stan
ford men's tennis team from com
pleting their appointed rounds —
another victory. Okay, there
wasn't any sleet, but the day after
the squad drubbed San Jose State
8-1 the Cardinal defeated the West
Virginia Mountaineers by the
same score.
Men's Tennis
Cardinal 8, Mountaineers 1
Stanford improved to 5-2 on the
season while West Virginia fell to
5-6.
The match was played in windy
and occasionally rainy conditions
and the last two doubles matches
required the Varsity Courts' new
lights, but Stanford still managed
to post a relatively easy win.
"It was a little bit tough because
of the conditions," Stanford Coach
Dick Gould said. "The wind is a
great equalizer. ... It was a real
solid effort by us."
Barry Richards began the con
test by defeating Gary Fry 6-0,
6-1 at No. 6 singles. Following
that, Martin Blackman defeated
Brad Kelly 6-3, 6-3 at No. 1 and
Alex O'Brien handled Joby Foley
at No. 3, winning 6-4, 6-1.
The Mountaineers' only win
came at No. 2 where Paul Mancini
defeated Jeff Cathrall 6-3, 7-6 for
Cathrall's first loss of the season.
Gould isn't worried about
Cathrall, however. "He's been
playing so well for us it's hard to
find fault in him for one match,"
Gould said.
Curtis Dunn got into the win
column for Stanford at No. 5,
taking Rick Jacob 0-6, 6-3, 6-1.
"(In the first set) there were just
a lot of tight games, three-all
games," Dunn said. "I started get
ting more balls back and a few
more shots in. I was able to close
off more points at the net. I got

an early game after it was three
all (in the third set) and he kind
of folded after that."
Glenn Solomon clinched the
match by posting a tough victory
over Madhu Nair, 7-6, 5-7, 6-4.
Solomon was on serve in the 12th
game of the second set but two
double-faults got him in a 40-15
hole and he lost the set. In the
third set, however, Solomon ran
down a Nair ball and came up
with a curving passing shot down
the line to break and go ahead
5-4. He then served out the match
and made the team score 5-1.
In doubles Cathrall and Dan
Turbow defeated Foley and Jacob
6-7, 6-0, 6-3 at No. 1, Solomon
and O'Brien upended Fry and

Kelly 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 at No. 2 an<g

identical 6-3 scores.
Gould thought a highlight wai,
the way Cathrall bounced bach!
strong for his doubles match
losing in singles. "He did not exX
ecute as well today as he has
(in singles)," Gould said. "I was .
really pleased with the way he J
came back in doubles."
"I thought the guys handled it j
(the weather) really well as a i
team," Gould said. "I've been !
really pleased with our last two
outings. We're getting good play J
throughout our line-up. ... If we '
keep it up, who knows?" U
