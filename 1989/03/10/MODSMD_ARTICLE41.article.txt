### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Two weeks ago, the Stanford
women's tennis team headed to
Arizona for its first important
road trip of the season.
It was their first challenge
on the long road to a possible
undefeated season and a
fourth-straight national title.
Not only did they answer
that challenge with two con
vincing wins, they then took to
the road again last weekend
and blew out the competition
at the National Team Indoors
in Madison, Wis.
Finally, the squad is back
home and primed to complete
the fortnight with victories
over the same Wildcats and
Sun Devils they drubbed two
weekends ago.
Stanford (12-0, 2-0 in Pacific
10 Conference play) is ranked
No. 1 in the nation and has
been led by the stellar play of

sophomore All-American Tami
Whitlinger.
Entrenched at No. 1, Whit
linger hasn't dropped a match
yet and has dominated against
highly-ranked opponents.
Teamed with her sister Teri,
she has also been playing ex
cellent doubles lately.
All-Americans Sandra Birch
and Teri Whitlinger are also
playing excellent tennis, as are
freshmen Debbie Graham and
Kylie Johnson.
