The Student Conduct
Legislative Council needs to ex
tend the deadline for commu
nity comment on its proposed
interpretation of the Funda
mental Standard, University
President Donald Kennedy told
the Faculty Senate yesterday.
Kennedy called the proposed
legislation "defective in impor
tant and . . . irremediable
ways," and said it was too im
portant an issue to have just
a 21-day comment period. He
suggested that 60 or 90 uays
would be more appropriate.
Currently, the deadline for
student and faculty opinions on
the initial proposal ends March
21.
Senate Chair John Kaplan
has asked Business Prof.
George Parker, chair of the
council, to allow more time,
Kennedy said. Kennedy joked
that because Kaplan and "cer
tain members of this body,"
such as himself, have a lot of

influence, "I would be sur
prised if the deadline were not
extended."
Kennedy's call for an exten
sion was supported by several
senate members. One faculty
member noted that the 21-day
period seemed ill-chosen be
cause it included both Dead
Week and Finals Week, making
it difficult for students to spend
the necessary time to consider
the proposal carefully.
In an interview last night,
Kaplan said the committee set
the March 21 deadline because
"it wanted to get the comments
back in a timely fashion." The
issue will be discussed in a
meeting of the council on Tues
day, Kaplan said.
"If there is broad-based com
munity support" to have the
date extended, Kaplan said the
council would probably vote to
extend it. "Either way, there is
going to be ample time for com
ments," Kaplan said, noting
there will be a second comment
period after the first revision
is released.
