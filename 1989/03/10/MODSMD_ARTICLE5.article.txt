# Second time's a charm ASSU OKs computerized spring election

As relentless as a phoenix,
ASSU computerized voting has
risen from apparent death to fi
nally become a reality.
The ASSU Senate voted last
night to implement computerized
voting for the upcoming general
election, scheduled for April 18
and 19.
A computerized voting bill was
shot down by the senate two meet
ings ago on Feb. 22, after falling
short of the required two-thirds
majority.
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Steve Krauss had not expected
the bill's first defeat, so he re
turned to last night's senate meet
ing with a revised bill and gal

vanized senate support.
Krauss met with bill opponents
after the February no vote to dis
cuss their concerns. Taking their
feelings into consideration,
Krauss amended the bill and
ironed out problem areas at the
most recent ASSU Administration
and Rules Committee meeting
March 1. The committee approved
the new bill and sent it to the
floor of the senate for approval.
Sophomore senator Joe Cha
said before last night's meeting,
"It's going to pass. We're going
to lobby like hell for it."
Krauss performed a demonstra
tion of the computerized voting
system in front of the senate last
night, and Apple Computer rep-
resentative Kevin Warner sent a
letter of recommendation for the
system. The bill was introduced
on the floor without opposing
debate, and the senate passed it
with a unanimous voice vote.
The new bill addressed the two
major concerns which caused the
earlier defeat of computerized
voting: computer crashes and a
decreased number of polling sites
from last year.
The computer program was
rewritten so that each student's
vote will be printed out to provide
a safeguard in case of computer
failure. Krauss also added five
more polling sites in the new bill,
which will be placed in such high
traffic areas as the Clock Tower
and the Post Office.

In further election matters, the
ASSU passed three referendums
to be placed on the spring ballot,
two of which pose questions to
students about University policy
regarding South Africa: Should
the University completely divest
from South Africa; and should the
University more actively recruit
South African students, establish
a South African studies professor
ship and establish opportunities
for students to study in Africa?
The third referendum deals
with recycled paper products, re
questing that Central Stores, a
company supplying most of the
University departments, stock a
complete line of recycled paper
products.
In other matters, the senate ap
proved the ASSU Speakers'
Bureau request to bring Gloria
Steinem, noted feminist and foun
der of Ms. magazine,
