# Shift to CIV on schedule

The transition of Western Culture into Stanford's
new Cultures, Ideas and Values program is going
smoothly despite a lack of minority faculty and no
new track proposals, a CIV official told the Faculty
Senate yesterday.
History Prof. Paul Robinson, chair of the Area
One Program Committee, said in an informal 20-
minute report that he expected all of the old Western
Culture tracks to be "in compliance" with last year's
CIV legislation by the end of this year.
Robinson added that complying with CIV would
not require serious changes in any of the tracks,
because they had already begun including issues of
race, gender and class before ClV's approval last
March, which made the changes mandatory. Com
pliance this year "represents simply a continuation
of a process of adaptation that was already underway
a year ago," Robinson said.
Robinson told the senate that the main problem
with CIV is that "the multicultural ideals of the
new legislation will not be fully realized until there
is a larger pool of minority faculty and faculty with
expertise outside of the European field from which
potential CIV faculty can be drawn."
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, a strong supporter
of CIV, agreed with Robinson. The ideals of CIV,
Rebholz said, cannot be realized without minority
faculty. Rebholz added that "we cannot expect dra
matic results too quickly" because there are few
minority academics, and they are in great demand.
History Prof. David Kennedy objected to some of
Rebholz's and Robinson's comments, saying he felt
they implied that only minority faculty could effec
tively teach about non-Western cultures. Robinson
then apologized, assuring Kennedy that his com
ments had no such implications.
Robinson reported that another concern about
CIV was that there were no new tracks being pro
posed to his committee, despite aggressive efforts
to convince humanities and social science faculty
to submit plans.
Robinson praised ClV's only new track, "Europe
and the Americas," as "a great success." The Area
One Program Committee last week unanimously
approved the course, which was experimental this
year, as a regular track for next year.
The controversial course is the only track con
structed especially to conform to the CIV legislation
and received national attention in December when
the Wall Street Journal editorialized against its
reading list.
Students and faculty in "Europe and the Amer
icas" have strongly defended the course, asserting
that its readings are valuable and informative.
Commenting on Robinson's report, junior Paul
Gager, press representative for the Asian-American
Student Association, said, "They can't even get an
Asian-American history professor; there is no way
they can get CIV to go through."
