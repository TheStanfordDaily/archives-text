# 'Satanic Verses' is back
## Rushdie's novel to arrive at Bookstore next week 
### Kathy Lachenauer Editorial staff 
Salman Rushdie's "The Satanic
Verses" reappeared in Palo Alto
bookstores yesterday, but copies
won't be available at the Stanford
Bookstore until next week at the
earliest.
The 547-page novel, considered
blasphemous by some orthodox
Moslems, vanished from U.S.
bookstores last month after the
Ayatollah Khomeini called on
Moslems to hunt down and kill
Rushdie.
Almost immediately after the
death threat, the Bookstore's
original 25 copies sold out. More
than 50 anxious Bookstore cus
tomers submitted special purchas
ing requests for the novel.
While the Bookstore's shelves
might still be bare, management
at Printer's Inc., B. Dalton Book
seller and Books Inc., said copies
of "The Satanic Verses" arrived
yesterday.
Printers Inc. sold 10 of about
50 new copies in half an hour
yesterday. Of B. Dalton's 36

copies, only six remained on the
shelf by noon. Kepler's Bookstore,
which received 50 copies a week
ago, sold out in two days and is
awaiting another shipment.
Meanwhile, 19 people wanting
to read the book have placed their
names on a high priority, seven
day loan list at Green Library.
Green has only one copy of the
hard-bound book but has placed
an order for three more. Meyer
Library is waiting for its first and
only copy of Rushdie's novel.
Yesterday, an official at the
Stanford Bookstore declined to
predict when copies of the book
would arrive there. "It's not even
possible for me to guess," said
book buyer Mark Ouimet.
However, a sales agent at In
gram, a Nashville-based whole
saler serving the Bookstore, told
The Daily yesterday that 35 copies
should reach the store by next
week.
Ingram received the Book
store's order on Feb. 21, a week
after Khomeini put a price on
Rushdie's head. If the Bookstore's
order had come in a day earlier,
the agent said, it would have been
included in Ingram's first ship
ment of the book and could have
hit campus last week.
Instead, the Bookstore is "next
in the line" for copies from In
gram's second shipment.
Wholesalers appear to be filling
local store orders quicker than the
book's publisher, Viking-Penguin
Publishers.
Viking press representative
Paul Slovak explained that the
wholesale companies might have
speedier return rates than Viking
because copies of the book are
going straight from the printers
to the wholesalers.
Once the 25 Bookstore copies
ran out, Ouimet said he called
Viking, with headquarters in New

York, and requested 100 new
copies. A few days later, Ouimet
also ordered copies from two
wholesale companies, Ingram and
Baker & Taylor.
"There was no way to know
who would deliver first. I covered
all my bases," Ouimet said.
Once the copies reach the Book
store they undergo a "receiving
process" from the warehouse to
the shelf that usually lasts two
days, Ouimet added.
The Coop, Harvard University's
bookstore, seemed to have more
luck tiacking down copies. Yes
terday, the Coop received 50
copies of "The Satanic Verses."
"We're lucky because we're on
the East Coast," Coop book direc
tor Dan Delellis said, adding that
most of the incoming copies were
prepurchased and only a few
remain on the shelves.
Slovak said Viking is "printing
to meet all the demand." He pre
dicted the $20 book will go into
paperback a year from now.
