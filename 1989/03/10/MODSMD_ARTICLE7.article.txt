# 'Satanic Verses' is back
## Rushdie's novel to arrive at Bookstore next week 
### Kathy Lachenauer Editorial staff 
Salman Rushdie's "The Satanic
Verses" reappeared in Palo Alto
bookstores yesterday, but copies
won't be available at the Stanford
Bookstore until next week at the
earliest.
The 547-page novel, considered
blasphemous by some orthodox
Moslems, vanished from U.S.
bookstores last month after the
Ayatollah Khomeini called on
Moslems to hunt down and kill
Rushdie.
Almost immediately after the
death threat, the Bookstore's
original 25 copies sold out. More
than 50 anxious Bookstore cus
tomers submitted special purchas
ing requests for the novel.
While the Bookstore's shelves
might still be bare, management
at Printer's Inc., B. Dalton Book
seller and Books Inc., said copies
of "The Satanic Verses" arrived
yesterday.
Printers Inc. sold 10 of about
50 new copies in half an hour
yesterday. Of B. Dalton's 36

copies, only six remained on the
shelf by noon. Kepler's Bookstore,
which received 50 copies a week
ago, sold out in two days and is
awaiting another shipment.
Meanwhile, 19 people wanting
to read the book have placed their
names on a high priority, seven
day loan list at Green Library.
Green has only one copy of the
hard-bound book but has placed
an order for three more. Meyer
Library is waiting for its first and
only copy of Rushdie's novel.
Yesterday, an official at the
Stanford Bookstore declined to
predict when copies of the book
would arrive there. "It's not even
possible for me to guess," said
book buyer Mark Ouimet.
However, a sales agent at In
gram, a Nashville-based whole
saler serving the Bookstore, told
The Daily yesterday that 35 copies
should reach the store by next
week.
Ingram received the Book
store's order on Feb. 21, a week
after Khomeini put a price on
