# ASSU airport shuttle up and running
## 
### Sophia Shing Staff writer 
Another quarter ends, another
chance to stumble across the
Quad with 10 suitcases in hand,
hurrying to catch an airport
shuttle at the Oval.
No more. The Council of Presi
dents has an alternative idea.
They will provide the first
student-run, non-profit airport
shuttle service for spring break.
Over 50 students have already
made reservations for the shuttle,
which will pick people up at three
locations — Tresidder Union, La
gunita Hall and the cul-de-sac be
tween Stern and Crothers Halls
— and take them to San Francisco
and San Jose airports.
The service begins Tuesday
during finals week and continues
until Saturday, March 25. Stu

dents can also get rides back to
Stanford after the break. Pick-ups
start on April 1, the Saturday
before the first day of classes, and
ends the following Monday.
Although fliers for the service
announce today as the deadline
for reservations, COP members
said last night they will not turn
a ride down to anyone who calls
in to the the ASSU office at 725-
2778, even next week.
The shuttle costs students $5
one way, compared to an $11 to
$23 ride with a local shuttle serv
ice. "The price is a lot cheaper
and you don't even have to go to
the Oval," said sophomore Mi
chael Lee, one of the first students
to reserve a spot with the shuttle.
"It's nice to see the ASSU doing
something that directly affects the
students," said Lee.
Another COP shuttle customer,

freshman Geoff Carter, said, "It's
convenient because it's dose to
our dorms." Referring to the
ASSU's role, Carter commented,
"It's part of what the ASSU is
there for, making life easier for
stu dents."
The members of the COP will
be volunteering their time to drive
the shuttles, which will also be
operated by other students hired
by the ASSU. Junior Canetta Ivy,
a member of the COP, said the
service fulfills one of the slate's
campaign promises.
David Brown, a junior on the
COP, added, "We felt like a lot of
students needed this service and
the COP wanted to meet those
needs."
The COP will use the ASSU
owned van purchased last year for
STOP.
