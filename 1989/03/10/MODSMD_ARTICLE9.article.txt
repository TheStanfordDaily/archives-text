## Senate rejects Tower nomination 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Senate yesterday rejected the
nomination of John Tower as de
fense secretary, 53-47, handing
President Bush a defeat in
his first high-stakes showdown
with the Democratic-controlled
Congress.
Bush said he would act swiftly
to submit a replacement candidate
to the Senate, but had no
timetable for making a decision.
White House officials began the
process of reviewing other possi
ble nominees almost immediately.
"The Senate has made its de
termination," Bush said. "I re
spect its role in doing so but dis
agree with the outcome."
Bush said Tower should have
received "the recompense of a
grateful nation," but instead his
"lot in past weeks has been a cruel
ordeal. For this I am truly sorry
for both him and his family."
Tower's nomination was
scuttled by concerns about his
drinking habits, coupled with sen
atorial unhappiness that he left
his government post as arms ne
gotiator and quickly began earn
ing hundreds of thousands of dol
lars as a defense industry consul
tant.
The vote was the culmination
of a tumultuous six-day Senate
debate and closely followed party
lines. Howell Heflin of Alabama;
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Chris
topher Dodd of Connecticut were
the only Democrats to support the
nomination, and one Republican

— Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas
— voted against.
At the Pentagon, Tower, who
watched the Senate vote on tele
vision, appeared briefly in a
private dining room reserved for
the defense secretary and read a
statement before a TV camera and
two reporters. He declined to take
questions, simply saying "thank
you" before he left.
"I will be recorded as the first
Cabinet nominee in the history
of the republic to be rejected in
the first 90 days of a presidency
and perhaps be harshly judged,"
he said.
"But I depart from this place
at peace with myself, knowing
that I have given a full measure
of devotion to my country."
He said no other public figure
"has been subjected to such a far
reaching and thorough investiga
tion nor had his human foibles
bared to such intensive and
demeaning public scrutiny."
"And yet, there is no finding
that I have ever breached estab
lished legal and ethical standards
nor been derelict in my duty," he
said.
Tower said he would return to
private life in Texas but would
remain "deeply grateful" to Bush
for his support and "obliged to
my old colleagues in the Senate
who rallied to me with fervor, zeal
and eloquence in the face of stag
gering political odds."
Tower also received a telephone
call from Bush, who expressed his

disappointment with the outcome,
Fitzwater said.
Tower, according to Sen. Pete
Wilson, R-Calif., had been willing
to step aside to allow Bush to
select another nominee. "He of
fered to withdraw more than once
to the president and the president

would have none of it," Wilson
said.
"We ought to hang our heads
after what we've done to this good
man," Senate Republican Leader
Bob Dole of Kansas said in a final
defiant speech. "America has lost
a good public servant."
