PREVENTIVE MEDICINE FOR THE
HEALTH INSURANCE BLUES
Do you need to make a change in your health
insurance? For example:
★ Is coverage under your parents' policy terminating*
and you need to add the Stanford student plan?
★ Do you now have other health insurance coverage
and want to waive the Stanford student plan?
REMEMBER: THE DEADLINE TO ADD OR
WAIVE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE
FOR SPRING QUARTER IS:
5 P.M., WEDNESDAY, APRIL 5, 1989
Requests to waive the Stanford student insurance
plan received after the deadline will not be honored,
and you will be held responsible for the $119
premium. If you meet eligibility requirements and
wish to add the Stanford student insurance plan, you
must do so by the April sth deadline or else obtain
health insurance independently. To change your
health insurance coverage, stop by the Insurance
Desk at Cowell Student Health Center before 5 p.m.,
Wednesday, April 5, to fill out the waive/add form.
For more information, call 723-2135.
