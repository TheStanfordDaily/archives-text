Bask in the sun with your mind at ease...
Protect your property with these vacation security hints:
Bikes/Scooters:
• Uurk your bicycle in your room while you are away. This not only protects it from
theft, but from the weather as well. Remember to keep your bike locked to a
stationary object while you're here!
• Lock your scooter to a stationary object outside. You cannot store any
gas-powered vehicles in the student residences.
Autos:
• Remove all valuables from your car. If you've an expensive stereo, take time to
remove it from view.
• Park your car in a secure, well lighted area. You may even want to consider
leaving it in a protected parking lot.
• Buy a car cover with a security cable and lock — thieves will be delayed trying to
remove it and thus deterred from burglarizing your car. Also, think about investing
in a car alarm system.
Rooms:
• IxKk your doors and windows tightly, and keep shades and curtains closed.
Unplug electrical appliances to reduce fire hazards and to save energy!
• Don't leave any extremely valuable items, like jewelry or cash, in your room. Hide
other valuable objects — such as computers — from view.
