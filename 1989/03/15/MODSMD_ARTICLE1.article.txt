## Council will revamp its Standard interpretation 
### Goodwin Liu Senior staff writer 
The Student Conduct Legislative Council
last night decided to "completely revamp"
its proposed interpretation of the Funda
mental Standard after receiving "not a
single letter of support" for the legislation
from the campus community, according to
council chair George Parker.
On March 1, the council made public its
proposed legislation so that community
members could review it and comment dur
ing a 21-day waiting period. Last week,
University President Donald Kennedy
called the proposal "defective" and asked
the council to extend the comment period.
However, in a statement released last

night, the council — composed of five stu
dents, six faculty members and one admin
istrator — said that "extending the period
on the current proposal is pointless."
Parker, a professor in the Graduate
School of Business, agreed, noting that the
council will "begin drafting a [new] state
ment starting in April .. . instead of invit
ing more comment on a statement that we
are going to substantially revise."
Parker declined to specify the changes
that the council might make in a new draft
of legislation.
New legislation that the council may pro
pose in the spring will undergo a similar
comment period, which is only the first of
many steps in enacting a policy
on Fundamental Standard viola
tions. Although the council has
the final word on creating judicial
policy, save a veto by Kennedy,
the entire process gives the com
munity ample opportunity to re
spond to proposed legislation.
Regarding the recent proposal,
Parker said, "The comment period
has served its purpose."
"The breadth and depth of
feeling on this issue were much
more than we had anticipated,"
he added.

The council's proposed legisla
tion seeks to protect individuals
from attacks involving
"obscenities, epithets and other
forms of expression that by ac
cepted community standards stig
matize, victimize or perjoratively
characterize them on the basis of
personal, cultural or intellectual
diversity."
The proposal, which is the coun
cil's first attempt ever at officially
interpreting the 83-year-old Fun
damental Standard, also aims to
protect groups from similar
defamation "on the basis of per
sonal and cultural differences."
Parker said the council has re
ceived 15 to 20 letters of "thought
ful criticism" from students, fac

ulty and University officials, in
cluding Kennedy, former Univer
sity President Richard Lyman and
two constitutional law professors
here.
Also, more than 800 students
have signed a petition requesting
that the Faculty Senate discuss
the issues of free speech and di
versity raised by the council's pro
posal, according to sophomore
Mike Laris, co-chair of the newly
formed Committee for First
Amendment Rights.
Parker said the responses have
not been "critical as much for lack
of specificity as for the proposal's
expansiveness and implications
for freedom of speech on campus."
