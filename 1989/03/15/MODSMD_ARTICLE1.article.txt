The Student Conduct Legislative Council
last night decided to "completely revamp"
its proposed interpretation of the Funda
mental Standard after receiving "not a
single letter of support" for the legislation
from the campus community, according to
council chair George Parker.
On March 1, the council made public its
proposed legislation so that community
members could review it and comment dur

University President Donald Kennedy
called the proposal "defective" and asked
the council to extend the comment period.
However, in a statement released last

night, the council — composed of five stu
dents, six faculty members and one admin
istrator — said that "extending the period
on the current proposal is pointless."
Parker, a professor in the Graduate
School of Business, agreed, noting that the
council will "begin drafting a [new] state
ment starting in April .. . instead of invit
ing more comment on a statement that we
are going to substantially revise."
Parker declined to specify the changes
that the council might make in a new draft
of legislation.
New legislation that the council may pro
pose in the spring will undergo a similar
comment period, which is only the first of
