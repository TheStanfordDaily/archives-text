# Hundred percent Teller
## Hoover fellow says SDI need not be foolproof 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
Though Edward Teller himself
has no problem being called the
"Father of the Hydrogen Bomb,"
he said his son "resents it when
the hydrogen bomb is referred to
as his kid brother."
In an hour-long KZSU Campus
Conference last night, the senior
fellow at the Hoover Institution
rejected widespread criticism of
the Reagan Administration's
Strategic Defense Initiative. Teller
said arguments based on the
grounds that the system will not
be 100 percent effective are
misplaced.
"1 am in 100 percent disagree
ment about the need for 100 per

cent protection," Teller said, ad
mitting that the controversial sys
tem would not be perfect, but ar
guing that it would be a strong
deterrent nonetheless.
The necessity of absolute
protection "is a statement from
opponents of SDI, who are
satisfied with zero percent protec
tion," Teller said. As it stands
now, he said the prospect exists
for " 100 percent success of aggres
sion."
Admitting that "I usually ac
cept things a little faster than
others," Teller said he was opti
mistic about the prospects of SDI
for world security. He said the
system will not only protect the
United States, but the deterrent
effect will be a means of "protec
ting mankind."
Responding to claims that he
misled Reagan with "outrageous
estimates" of SDI success, Teller
said he had only a 10 minute con
versation with Reagan about the
program in 1983, in which he told
Reagan that he was "hopeful and
that some experiments have
looked good."

Teller said he staunchly believes
SDI will be a strictly defensive
system, a view reflected in the
title of his latest book, "Better a
Shield than a Sword." "It is not
quite clear how at once a defensive
weapon becomes an offensive
weapon," Teller said. Even when
a nation has the best possible de
fense, he said that "nuclear war
is still not winnable."
Teller's discussion was inter
spersed with stories from his ear
lier relationships with innovative
nuclear physicists like J. Robert
Oppenheimer, director of the
Manhattan Project.

Teller discussed a bet by project
scientists to predict the explosive
force of the first atomic bomb test
at Los Alamos, New Mexico. Teller
predicted 50,000 pounds of force,
although the actual explosion reg
istered only 20,000 pounds. Tel
ler's estimate was the second
highest, but he warned last night
not to "base my scientific judg
ment on that bet."
Isador Rabi won the pool with
a prediction of 25,000 pounds.
Teller said the debate surround
ing Oppenheimer "solidified the
view that scientists should not
work on weapons."
