# South Africa ambassador handles tough questions
## 
### Lynne Bourgault 
The first black U.S. ambassa
dor to South Africa showed off
his diplomatic skills Monday
night when asked by his Stan
ford audience whether he stood
by official U.S. policy toward the
apartheid nation.
Defending the policy of
"facilitating" slow change in the
country, Edward Perkins told a
crowd of 100 in Kresge Audito
rium that "our policy in South
Africa speaks for itself."
In a confrontational question
and answer session following his
prepared speech, Perkins
refused to address why the
United States recognizes the
South African government,
despite the absence of demo
cratic elections, but refuses to
recognize the government in An
gola based on the same criterion.
"The real question here is why
we have not broken relations
with South Africa," Perkins
said. Smiling at the irony of
being asked if his position could
become obsolete, Perkins said,
"I don't want to answer that
question."
One member of the audience
asked Perkins why the United

States does not resort to stricter
economic sanctions against
South Africa, such as ceasing to
buy its gold. Perkins answered
that this would require greater
cooperation from European na
tions in order to be worthwhile.
Perkins, who has served in
South Africa for two years,
summed up the goals of U.S.
policy in the region by saying,
"We try to shape reality to our
interests there."
U.S. policy toward South
Africa combines promoting an
interest in freedom, democracy
and human rights with main
taining access to a key mineral
area, he said.
According to the Perkins, the
effects of economic sanctions
against South Africa have been
"difficult to assess," but in gen
eral, the United States and other
nations do not have much
leverage there.
Despite the turmoil, he said,
"the South African government
has laid the foundation for many
years in power."
The eradication of apartheid
must happen from within South
Africa, according to Perkins, and
the job of the United States is
to facilitate this change.
Black South Africans need

scholarships to American univer
sities, money for legal services
and support in business, Perkins
said.
The United States will spend
$34 million in these areas next
year, he said.
"We must let South Africa
know we want to help and not
destroy," he said.
Perkins, who was previously

ambassador to Ghana and
Liberia, said his assignment in
South Africa "is not an enviable
one, unless looked at as a his
torical opportunity."
"As I go about South Africa,
I am still an object of curiosity,"
he said, referring to the diffi
culty of being a black diplomat
to a government that denigrates
people of color.
