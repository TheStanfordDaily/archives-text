She analyzes poetry; he
analyzes computer sound
parameters. They and four other
Stanford students shine as this
year's winners of the annual
Dean's Award for Academic
Achievement.
Last week, Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies Tom Wasow under
took what he called "one of the
most pleasurable tasks as a dean,"
by spotlighting six undergradu
ates whose accomplishments merit
the attention of the Stanford com
munity. Faculty members
nominated their most noteworthy
students, and then a special com
mittee directed by Wasow selected
the final six.
The winners were: seniors

Julianne Berry and Rowena
Young, junior John Overdeck and
sophomores Daniel Culbert, Raina
Jackson and Nomi Martin.
An English and economics
major, Berry was nominated by
English Prof. George Dekker for
her superb poetry analysis. Ex
celling as a close interpreter of
poems, she also shines as a varsity
runner and high-jumper on Stan
ford's track team.
The scholar/athlete was im
pressed by the diversity of the
other student winners. "I was sur
prised how many neat things
people have done; you don't
realize what students are doing
here," Berry said.
Culbert, an undeclared sopho
more, was recognized for his crea
tion of a computer program that

analyzes sound parameters of a
commercial synthesizer. The
award "inspires me to be recog
nized for a field I have a great
interest in," said Culbert, adding
that he appreciated receiving the
academic award for something
that is practical and different from
every day, grade-oriented classes.
Culbert contributes his technical
expertise to the Center for Com
puter Research in Music and
Acoustics.
A physics major, Young has
done research in X-ray detection
that may open up new possibilities
in X-ray astronomy. She also
serves as president of the Stanford
chapter of the Society of Physics.
Young expressed concern the
lack of women involved in the
Physics Department. She noted

that only two women will remain
in the department next year after
the seniors graduate. She encour
aged women to get into the major:
"There isn't any academic reason
that prevents women from getting
involved with physics," she said.
Recognized for their study of
vernacular black English, sopho
mores Nomi Martin and Raina
Jackson are the first joint winners
of the award. Assoc. Linguistics
Prof. John Rickford nominated
them for their exemplary work in
an intensive linguistics research
project, presenting a paper they
co-authored.
John Overdeck, a math major,
is a star member of Stanford's
nationally-ranked Putnam Math
ematics Team.
