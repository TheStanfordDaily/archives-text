# IFC asks for stronger SAE self-penalization

### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
A proposed in-house punish
ment of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
Fraternity does not adequately re
spond to an incident two weeks
ago where fraternity members
flashed joggers from atop their
roof, the Interfraternity Council
decided last night.
After listening to testimony
from several of the fraternity
members, joggers who initially
lodged complaints with police, and
two unidentified witnesses, the
IFC's judicial board decided to let
the SAEs design a punishment for
their own house.
The SAE's own judiciary coun
cil recently proposed two meas
ures for educating the entire fra
ternity. According to the report
IFC President Chris Erlin re
ceived, the first involves a rape
education project to "discuss the
dangers of exibition and lewd be

havior and the consequences of
these action for women."
The second measure involves a
"liability discussion" with a
lawyer-alumni of the fraternity,
discussing legal implications of in
cidents such as these.
Although the IFC will not meet
again until next quarter, the ex
ecutive committee has asked the
SAEs "to do a little more," Erlin
said, "We're not sure what further
actions should be called for."
Erlin stated the reason for the
IFC dissatisfaction was a problem
concerning whether the incident
"was an act of individuals or a
house act." The in-house punish
ment failed to appropriately deal
with individual perpetrators.
As a result of discussions be
tween Erlin and SAE President
Bill Derwin last night, the SAEs
will apologize to the jogger who
filed a complaint with the police
about the incident.
