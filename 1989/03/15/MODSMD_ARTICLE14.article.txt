With vivid examples, Harvard
University Geology Prof. Stephen
Jay Gould kicked off his visit to
Stanford Monday night with an
explanation of popular misconcep
tions on human evolution.
Speaking to a crowd of about
1,300 in Memorial Auditorium,
Gould explained how "unpredict
ability in the history of life" un
dermined the human species'
conception of itself as "the stand
ard of measure by which all else
is assessed."
According to Gould, humans
hold two "basic wrong ideas"
about evolution: They see evolu
tion as fundamentally progressive
and judge life as moving upward
and outward in a "cone of increas
ing diversity."
With slides of popular advertis
ing and illustrations' from scien
tific journals and textbooks,
Gould showed that our species
sees evolution as a linear stage of

development from fish to frog to
mammal to human.
To dismiss these misconcep
tions, Gould asked the audience
to imagine "the great scientific
experiment." If we were to return
in a time machine to crucial mo
ments in the history of life on
earth and alter those moments,
would life on earth have evolved
similarly, he asked.
Gould said humans tend to seek
patterns and meaning in their
lives, and impose these tendencies
on their views of evolution.
Humans see the process of evolu
tion as progressive, determined,
gradual and interlocking. Quoting
Alexander Pope, Gould said
humans see "all nature [as] but
art" and "whatever is, is right."
Because so many unpredictable,
accidental events occur in the his
tory of life on earth, Gould said
the modern picture would not
remotely resemble today's form
but would not result in "total
chaos" either.
