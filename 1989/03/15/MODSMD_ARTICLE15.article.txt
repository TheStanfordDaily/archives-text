## U.S. halts imports of assault guns 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Bush administration suspended
imports of AK-47s and most other
semiautomatic weapons yesterday
but denied any change in Presi
dent Bush's oft-stated opposition
to gun control.
More than 110,000 assault-type
weapons with pending applica
tions for import will be affected,
according to the announcement by
the new national drug control di
rector, William Bennett.
The action does not affect weap
ons already in this country, but
blocks import of certain guns un
less it can be determined they are
for sporting use, officials said.
It also does not affect weapons
made in the United States, such
as the ARIS, the semiautomatic,
civilian version of the .223-caliber
M-16.
Before yesterday, Bush had not
indicated any willingness to move
against the proliferation of semi
automatic weapons except to say
he wanted Bennett to study
various options.
White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said the move
reflected no change in Bush's op
position to banning such guns but
merely would enforce current law
that allows for import of the guns
only if they are for sporting pur
poses.
On Feb. 16, Bush told reporters
he would "strongly oppose" any
attempt to ban semiautomatic
weapons despite public concern
over an increasing number of
homicides, mostly related to drug

violence, involving such guns.
On March 7, Bush told a news
conference that he had asked Ben
nett to look into what could be
done about AK-475, one type of
semiautomatic rifle, but that he
wanted to find a way to "still do
what's right by the legitimate
sportsman."
He said solving the problem was
"not as easy as it seems."
Yesterday's news release in
Bennett's name said that Treas
ury Secretary Nicholas Brady,
who has jurisdiction over the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, "decided to suspend, ef
fective immediately, the importa
tion of several makes of assault
type weapons pending a decision
as to whether these weapons are,
as required by law, 'particularly
suitable for or readily adaptable
to sporting purposes.
Bush, a longtime member of the
National Rifle Association,
"shares the public concern," over
the proliferation of semiautomatic
weapons, said Fitzwater.
Applications so far this year to
import such weapons already have
passed the total of the previous
three years, Bennett said.
The National Rifle Association,
which has opposed limits on semi
automatic weapons, reacted with
caution to the move, saying it
would "put a stop to the media
hysteria surrounding the semi
automatic version of the AK-47
rifle, and should provide an at
mosphere for a reasoned and sen
sible debate on this issue."
