WASHINGTON (AP) - Terror
ist Fawaz Younis, who was lured
to his arrest on the high seas,
was convicted yesterday in U.S.
District Court of hijacking a Jor
danian airliner in Beirut and hold
ing 70 people hostage for 30 hours.
Federal officials immediately
claimed the verdict as the first
affirmation of a 1984 statute
asserting for the United States
"long-arm" jurisdiction over the
taking of American hostages
abroad.
Attorney General Dick Thorn
burgh hailed the verdict as "a
boost for our efforts to effectively
deal with international terror
ism."
"Those who violate the rights
of U.S. citizens are hereby put on
notice that the American law en
forcement system is capable of ex
acting a penalty for these terroris
tic crimes, regardless of where
they occur," Thornburgh said in
a statement.
The Lebanese Younis showed
no emotion as a female interpreter
relayed the verdict the jury
reached after three days of
deliberations: Guilty on three
counts, innocent on three others.
While the jury of seven women
and five men filed out of the
courtroom, Younis chatted with
the Arabic interpreter, and ap
peared relaxed and smiling.
For his conviction on the most
serious offense, taking hostages,
the 30-year-old Younis could be
sentenced to life in prison.
"This case demonstrates the de

termination of the United States
government to bring to justice in
the United States international
terrorists who victimize U.S.
citizens wherever violence and
hostage-taking acts are commit
ted," U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens
said in a statement.
Younis' court-appointed attor
ney, Francis Carter, contested the
government claim and said he
would appeal the conviction on
grounds that the United States
ought not to have jurisdiction over
the 1985 hijacking. He said he
also would appeal on grounds the
military was involved in the ar
rest.
"It is an outrage," said Carter.
The case "was not about the
United States" and the two Amer
icans aboard the aircraft were not
harmed.
Younis was lured aboard a yacht
in international waters in the
Mediterranean Sea on Sept. 13,
1987, with the prospect of a drug
deal and a party.
He was slammed to the deck
by members of the FBI hostage
rescue squad and interrogated for
four days aboard a Navy muni
tions ship. Then, after he gave a
detailed confession, he was flown
non-stop from the deck of an
aircraft carrier to Washington.
Doctors later found he had suf
fered hairline fractures of both
wrists during the arrest.
"Mr. Younis did not expect an
awful lot from the United States
after the means used to arrest
him," Carter said.
