# Senate opens hearings on Cheney
## Defense Secretary-designate expected to be confirmed quickly 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Defense
Secretary-designate Dick Cheney cau
tioned yesterday against any U.S. reduc
tions in military strength in response
to changes in the Soviet Union as the
Senate Armed Services Committee
opened hearings on President Bush's
replacement for John Tower.
"It would be a great mistake to reduce
our own military capabilities and lessen
our defense posture," the six-term
Wyoming congressman told the commit
tee.
Cheney used his first day before the
panel to expound on his views of defense
policy, including his stand on Star Wars
and burden-sharing, as committee mem
bers indicated they will move quickly
on confirmation.

"I'm delighted with this nomination,"
said Sen. James Exon of Nebraska, sec
ond ranking Democrat on the panel. "I
hope this confirmation goes quickly and
I believe it will."
Added Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-
Mass.: "I look forward to working with
him, and I expect his rapid and over
whelming confirmation. America's de
fense policy is back on track."
Coming after a bitter Senate debate
over the Tower nomination, the first
day of consideration of Cheney's nom
ination was marked by strong words of
praise, sentimentality and indications of
support from both parties.
Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., a mem
ber of the Armed Services panel, said
Cheney's "sense of humility and a sense

of presence served him well and will
serve America well."
Senate Republican Whip Alan
Simpson of Wyoming called the con
gressman "the most steady and unflap
pable man I have ever known and he
will need it all."
The Republican senator also took a
swipe at the rancorous Senate battle
that claimed Tower as a victim, saying
the process can be "quite demeaning
and quite dehumanizing."
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the committee
chairman, said the panel "agreed with
the White House to do what we could
this week" on the nomination, but
added that they would "not be taking
any shortcuts."
