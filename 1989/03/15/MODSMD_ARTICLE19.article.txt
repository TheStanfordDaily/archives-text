# FDA tests Chilean fruit for poison
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Food and Drug Administration in
tensified its testing of grapes and
other Chilean fruit yesterday
while the Bush administration
worked with officials of the South
American country to determine
the scope of an apparent cyanide
poisoning attempt.
Meanwhile, FDA Commissioner
Frank Young advised Americans
to be "safe rather than sorry" by
discarding all fruit in their
refrigerator unless they are cer
tain it was grown somewhere
other than Chile.
The FDA announced Monday
that traces of cyanide had been

found in two seedless red grapes
that were part of a batch of about
2,000 grape-bunches sampled at
the port in Philadelphia, where
they had been shipped from Chile
three days before a poisoning
threat was telephoned to the U.S.
Embassy there.
At the urging of the agency,
supermarkets moved quickly to
remove all Chilean fruit from
their shelves and distributors held
produce from the South American
country in warehouses until fur
ther testing could be done. Virtu
ally all grapes sold at this time
of year in U.S. markets are from
Chile.

Canadian officials also urged
that Chilean fruit be removed
from stores in Canada. Addition
ally, news reports in Japan said
the Japanese Embassy in Santiago
had received a similar call warn
ing of cyanide poisoning and that
Japanese officials have halted
Chilean fruit imports.

Young met with top-level Bush
aides and told reporters that U.S.
officials will meet "with represen
tatives of the Chilean fruit
growers, also the government of
Chile, the FDA, FBI, and we'll
get a joint strategy. We hope to
do that soon."
