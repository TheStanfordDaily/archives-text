# CIV spells no change
## 
### Susan McKean Editorial staff 
Nothing is really going to change next
year as Stanford's Western Culture pro
gram officially gives way to Culture, Ideas
and Values.
Former Secretary of Education William
Bennett appears to have cried wolf over
the iconoclasm of CIV, because the CIV

shift baptized a fundamental change al
ready on ito legs before last year's legisla
tive ceremony embroiled the campus. And
now few in the University have taken the
time to pursue ClV's potential.
The CIV transition is actually closer to
a continuation, albeit hastened, of the di
rection Western Culture was heading even
before any debate swept campus. And in
asmuch as CIV aims to strip Western Cul
ture of ethnocentricity and elitism, the
hyped disregard for classics pinned to CIV
proponents is equally spurious.
Many classics remain, although no longer
required, and the measures toward com
pliance with CIV could be seen as repairs
rather than restructuring.
It is nothing new, as Provost James
Rosse pointed out, that official recognition
of a movement usually comes after the

movement is well underway, as apparently
was the case with CIV.
Last year, for instance, the Bible and
Machiavelli's "The Prince" were the only
two books from the core list of 15 that
were assigned by all eight tracks. Now, six
authors are required to be read in each
track, and the track chairs will meet spring
quarter to decide on next year's common
books, themes or authors.
Prof. John Perry, chair of the philosophy
track, said the most pronounced change in
the philosophy track next year will be
greater integration of the winter quarter
concentration on Africa with the rest of
the curriculum and a new spring quarter
instructor.
Prof. Mark Mancall, chair of Structured
Liberal Education, said another week and
a half on Asia will be included next year,
but added that SLE was "pretty much in
compliance before (the CIV legislation)."
Prof. James Sheehan, chair of the history
track, said the history track has been
"changing over the years already" in the
direction of CIV. And chair of the English
track Prof. Charles Fifer said his track will
"continue what it was doing before the
legislation. . . . The actual legislation didn't
make much of a difference in our curric
ulum."
Apparently, the CIV legislation
was a forceful wind for a course
on which many of the Western
Culture skippers had already set
sail. Its stormy fanfare, however,
tugged at anchors of orthodoxy
and traditional canons that hadn't
felt the pull before. Thus the
furious, nationally-splashed
debate.
No new track proposals
Now the task is to keep the
sails filled. Except for "Europe
and the Americas," this year's ex
perimental track which will be in
cluded as a regular offering next
year, no new tracks have yet been
proposed and Prof. Paul Robin
son, director of the CIV Program,
said he does not expect any to be
submitted.
The absence of new track pro
posals is credited by Robinson and
others to the full schedules of fac
ulty and the University priority
given to research over undergrad
uate course work.
"(Creating a new track) re
quires someone with real concern,
someone willing to make a per
sonal sacrifice to develop the
track," Wasow said. Apparently no
one at Stanford currently fits the
description, or at least not yet.

Overtures have been made to
Political Science, Sociology and
other departments not currently
represented in the CIV track line
up, but as yet nothing has come
of it, Robinson said.
Robinson noted he was aware
of an informal interest among
some faculty in creating an Art
Department-sponsored track and
one focused on the Mediterranean
world, but almost certainly not
for next year.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Thomas Wasow added that most
of the faculty with requisite ex
pertise for teaching subjects out
side of the European canon, those
especially qualified for developing
new tracks, already teach in the
program.
Finding the faculty
More than anything else, CIV
has spotlighted the small ranks
of these qualified faculty and di
rected attention campuswide to
increasing their numbers, either
through additional hiring or
working with extant faculty to ex
pand their facility for teaching be
yond the Western framework.
But despite moves toward
legislative and ideological commit
ment to this cause, Robinson said,
"I have my worries about how
much progress we can actually
make in the near future."
Last week, the Area One Com
mittee sent University President

sacrifice to develop

Donald Kennedy and Rosse a
memo urging the Stanford admin
istration to act immediately to se
cure additional faculty members
"with training appropriate to
carry out the intent of the legis
lation creating the Program in
CIV."
Further, asserting that "Stan
ford does not currently possess
sufficient tenure-line faculty with
expertise in the study of non-
European cultures and of Amer
ican racial minorities," it called
for a meeting with Rosse to dis
cuss specific strategies for hiring
more minority faculty.
Wasow, who sits ex-officio on
the Area One Committee, said the
purpose of the memo was to
"bring to the attention of the high
est officers of the University the
concern with staffing (CIV), and
in particular, getting people of
color involved in the program. If
Kennedy and Rosse are cognizant

of (the problems) there might be
hope of getting more resources."
But University resources are
not the only problem. Very few
people nationwide are qualified to
teach from a non-Western orien
tation, and a small percentage of
minorities are currently in aca
demic fields. Thus most
universities are scrambling to get
the few there are.
Instructing a CIV track — for
little money, lots of work, no long
term job stability and minimal
prestige — is not a tempting offer
for candidates in high demand
elsewhere, according to Wasow.
But faculty maintain that the
recruitment of minority faculty
versus non-European experts, and
the development of CIV versus the
general faculty and the curricu
lum, are distinct from each other.
Rosse concurred with this point
raised by History Prof. David
Kennedy last week in the Faculty
Senate meeting. "It's important
to worry about hiring for CIV,
and it's important to have minor
ity appointments, but they're not
connected," Rosse said.
Robinson sent a letter earlier
this quarter to all those involved
in hiring instructors for CIV
courses next year, admonishing
them to make systematic efforts
to improve minority representa
tion. This year only two instruc
tors are minorities.
But few tracks will be hiring

new instructors, and those that
will must operate on very tight
budgets. Because the program
cannot afford to fly applicants
here for interviews, the search
process is minimal, according to
Fifer, thus further restricting an
already limited selection pool.
Preventing a dead end
The CIV shift has fallen short
of some expectations, but perhaps
the obstacles of scarce money,
time and qualified CIV teachers
made it realistically impossible to
perfect CIV in one year.
Nonetheless, despite ClV's
problems, dedicated members of
the community have contributed
to CIV development and have kept
the program from reaching a dead
end.
In general, CIV faculty and
others are trying to make better
use of the resources Stanford al
ready has. Through various
means, faculty members are being
educated on the CIV issues they
themselves deemed essential to

responsibly educate Stanford stu
dents.
"A big part of what we have to
do to make CIV work is to work
with current faculty that have
taught and will teach the pro
gram, and help them develop ex
pertise outside of the traditional
European canon in which they
were trained," Wasow said.
He has specifically allotted
some of the money from his
Dean's Innovative Fund for Un
dergraduate Education to efforts
directed toward CIV. Some faculty
members have shown interest in
using some of the money this
summer to rework the tracks or
acquaint themselves more fully
with non-Western cultures.
Likewise, he said he is in the
"very preliminary" stages of plan
ning a series of seminars this
summer "to help people teaching
in the program — both regular
faculty and the instructors — and
in order to expose them to non
traditional areas."
Meyer Library has taken a bite
into CIV as well. Meyer has of
fered help in finding bibliographi
cal materials appropriate to CIV
for all interested CIV teachers and
course architects.
And Assoc. History Prof. Clay
Carson has been working with two
students to compile materials for
an introduction to and archive for
multicultural education to be used
in CIV, Wasow said.
