# CIV spells no change

Nothing is really going to change next
year as Stanford's Western Culture pro
gram officially gives way to Culture, Ideas
and Values.
Former Secretary of Education William
Bennett appears to have cried wolf over
the iconoclasm of CIV, because the CIV

shift baptized a fundamental change al
ready on ito legs before last year's legisla
tive ceremony embroiled the campus. And
now few in the University have taken the
time to pursue ClV's potential.
The CIV transition is actually closer to
a continuation, albeit hastened, of the di
rection Western Culture was heading even
before any debate swept campus. And in
asmuch as CIV aims to strip Western Cul
ture of ethnocentricity and elitism, the
hyped disregard for classics pinned to CIV
proponents is equally spurious.
Many classics remain, although no longer
required, and the measures toward com
pliance with CIV could be seen as repairs
rather than restructuring.
It is nothing new, as Provost James
Rosse pointed out, that official recognition
of a movement usually comes after the

movement is well underway, as apparently
was the case with CIV.
Last year, for instance, the Bible and
Machiavelli's "The Prince" were the only
two books from the core list of 15 that
were assigned by all eight tracks. Now, six
authors are required to be read in each
track, and the track chairs will meet spring
quarter to decide on next year's common
books, themes or authors.
Prof. John Perry, chair of the philosophy
track, said the most pronounced change in
the philosophy track next year will be
greater integration of the winter quarter
concentration on Africa with the rest of
the curriculum and a new spring quarter
instructor.
Prof. Mark Mancall, chair of Structured
Liberal Education, said another week and
a half on Asia will be included next year,
but added that SLE was "pretty much in
compliance before (the CIV legislation)."
Prof. James Sheehan, chair of the history
track, said the history track has been
"changing over the years already" in the
direction of CIV. And chair of the English
track Prof. Charles Fifer said his track will
"continue what it was doing before the
legislation. . . . The actual legislation didn't
make much of a difference in our curric
ulum."
