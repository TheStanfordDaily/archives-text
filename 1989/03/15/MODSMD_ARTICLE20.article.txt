Health director calls apples safe
LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Educators who yank
apples from school lunch rooms for fear of chemi
cal contamination are running from a "toxic
bogeyman," the state's health director said yes
terday.
Kenneth Kizer, who bit into a shiny red apple
while discussing the matter with reporters, said
fears that children will get cancer from the farm
chemical daminozide, or Alar, are based on a
misinterpretation of a recent study by a private
interest group.
The New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and San
Francisco school districts have quit serving
apples, applesauce, apple juice and other apple

products because of the recent report linking Alar
with a heightened risk of cancer in children.
Shuttle mission may be cut short
SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) - A problem
with a hydrogen tank aboard the space shuttle
Discovery forced its astronauts to conserve energy
yesterday and threatened to shorten the mission,
but Mission Control said there was no threat to
the crew.
The five crew members monitored scientific
experiments and photographed environmental
damage on the Earth, a day after they roared
into orbit and launched a key NASA communi
cations satellite.
