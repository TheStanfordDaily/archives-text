# High school teachers get thanks
##

If you were to attribute your
academic success to any two
teachers, one from high school and
one from Stanford, who would you
choose?
That decision was made by 23
graduating seniors who represent
the top 5 percent of the class in
the School of Engineering. All 23
were recipients of the Frederick
Emmons Terman Engineering
Scholastic Award and were recog
nized for their achievements
Saturday at the Palo Alto Holiday
Inn.
Instead of receiving monetary

awards, the students invited their
most influential high school teach
ers and Stanford professors for
the 30th annual luncheon cere
mony, which jointly honored the
teachers and the students.
Coming from as far as Sin
gapore, high school teachers were
nominated from all over the
world. Transportation and a room
at the Holiday Inn were paid for
by an endowment from former
Dean of Engineering Fred Ter
man.
Speaking at the luncheon Dean
of Engineering James Gibbons
said, "This award pays tribute to
someone who has helped students
get where they are." Gibbons also

quoted Terman as saying, "Suc
cess is a combination of bright
students and influential teachers."
Sarabjit Baveja, a senior in elec
trical engineering, invited his high
school French teacher, Joel Carre,
who flew to the United States
from Singapore on three days
notice. "There is a consistent
theme in my choice of teachers.
They taught me the joy of learn
ing and really made learning fun,"
Baveja said.
Michelle Effros, also graduating
in electrical engineering, invited
her English teacher, Rod Flagler,
from Palos Verdes, Calif. Effros
said, "It was the first time anyone
got me to sit down and write."
