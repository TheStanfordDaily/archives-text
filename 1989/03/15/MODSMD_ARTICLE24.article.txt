In recognition of their involve
ment in such diverse projects as
tutoring disadvantaged minority
youth, instituting a new science
safety program and increasing
campus awareness of cooperative
living, 11 members of the Stan

honored with the Winter Quarter

Organizers of the East Palo
Alto Stanford Summer Academy
— Toby Eastman, Jerilyn Men
doza, Nicky Ramos, Deanna Ter

providing middle school children
with educational and motivational
activities. Magdalena F'ittoria of
the Public Service Center lauded
the "level of commitment, initia

commitment this group put for
the program, it wouldn't have
happened," she said.
