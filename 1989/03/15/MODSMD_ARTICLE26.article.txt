## Two strikes 
### 
THAT'S TWO. When Julian
Low resigns next month as
director of the Asian-
American Activities Center, the
Asian-American community will
have lost its second representa
tive in as many months.
Last month, lecturer Gordon
Chang, the only person who
teaches an Asian-American
studies course at Stanford, an
nounced that he would be leaving
to accept a tenured position at
UC-Irvine, because Stanford has
no tenure track in Asian-
American studies.
Low, too, is leaving in part be
cause the University refused to
give him full-time status.
As the largest minority group
on campus, Asian-Americans
make up 13.7 percent of the un
dergraduate student population
at Stanford, yet they lack faculty
and administrators to deal di
rectly with their community.
Black students, 8.4 percent of
the undergraduate population,
have their own full-time dean,
and the Afro-American Studies

program, though small, regularly
offers courses and instructors to
teach those courses.
The Chicano Fellows program
offers courses each quarter
dealing with the history and cul
ture of Mexican-Americans, a
group which makes up 8.6 per
cent of the undergraduate popu
lation.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Jackson has said that he
hopes to be able to give Low's
replacement full-time status.
But why did Jackson and the
University wait to offer full-time
status to a successor rather than
offering it to Low so they could
hold on to a popular and success
ful dean?
As with Chang, the University
did not drive Low away, it just
did not make enough of an effort
to keep him.
Stanford should make a com
mitment to the Asian-American
community before it loses any
more representatives and before
the University finds itself losing
Asian-American students.
