# What's the holdup?

### 
IT'S TIME TO PUT the punch
into the policy. The Law
School has found Baker &
McKenzie, the nation's largest
law firm, in violation of its non
discrimination policy. Now it
needs to follow words with action.
The firm has admitted that a
partner at Baker & McKenzie
made racist, sexist and anti-
Semitic remarks while conduct
ing an interview at the University
of Chicago.
The Law School Oversight
Committee has delayed a final
decision on what penalty they will
impose on the firm pending

review of a report that Baker &
McKenzie will soon release.
But unless the report contains
significant revelations, a one-year
ban on recruiting seems like a
reasonable punishment — one
that follows the actions of other
major law schools.
A one-year ban will be more
than symbolic, but won't pre
clude the firm from recruiting
off campus.
The Law School needs to send
both Baker & McKenzie and the
law community a signal that rac
ism and sexism will not be
tolerated.
