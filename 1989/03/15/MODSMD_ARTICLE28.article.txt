RAs want action for
ranch workers
As Resident Assistants, employees of
Stanford University, we are writing to
express our disappointment with the
University's handling of the Webb
Ranch issue, specifically the treatment
of its employees. We urge University
President Donald Kennedy to encourage
a constructive dialogue with the

workers' representatives and work to
protect them from possible employer
retaliation.
That the University would allow
such conditions to exist on Stanford
property we find extremely distressing.
No person should be forced to live in
such conditions. In allowing such treat
ment of Webb Ranch workers, Stanford
clearly violates the ideal of respect for
others which forms the basis of the
Fundamental Standard.
The absence of constructive action
towards improving these conditions
indicates that the University interprets
the standard to apply only to the im
mediate Stanford community. We feel
that such a standard, if it is to be
meaningful, cannot be applied selective

The fact that Stanford had to be
informed of these conditions by the
United Stanford Workers is in itself
disturbing, but that the University
would fail to act once such conditions
were brought to light contradicts our
goals as a staff and community. Legal
issues aside, we hope that Stanford

will find a sufficient moral basis for
action.
If respect for others is to consist of
more than simply an intellectual
abstraction, it must be consistently
reflected in concrete actions taken by
the University. The University's ir
responsible handling of the Webb
Ranch issue leads us to question its
commitment to such an ideal.

Column misdefined
racism and sexism
In his March 10 column, Burke
Smith misdefines racism by trying to
make it a blanket term to fit everyone,
regardless of race or place in society.
Because racism is the systematic op
pression of the minority by the
majority in power, it is highly unlikely
that any person of color can be racist
by this sociopolitical and economic
definition.
Smith mistakes a few isolated inci
dents of prejudice against whites by
people of color for racism. Racism is
the oppression of people of color for
more than 300 years in America. By
Smith's definition, racism is when a
minority member says she or he
doesn't like white people.
To a person of color, being refused
service, being subjected to the apart
heid of "separate but equal," being
shot for trying to vote and being
lynched because of the color of one's
skin is racism. So until anything of
this magnitude has happened to whites
for hundreds of years, they need to
stop crying wolf.
Smith goes on to say that whites are
justified in their racism when minori
ties say that they hate whites. I don't
agree with anyone who judges others
solely on skin color.
However I feel that a person of color
is more justified in his or her dislike

of whites due to the historical context
of that dislike. The slavery of blacks,
the placement of Asian-Americans in
concentration camps, the theft of
America from the Native Americans
and the ill-treatment of Mexicans (a
great understatement) give people of
color more reason to be suspicious of
and bitter towards whites.
The big problem Smith and his
other white contemporaries have is
realizing and accepting that white
people created racism, and men created
sexism in America. Once whites and
males make that connection, then they,
women and people of color can try to
rid the world of racism and sexism.

Activists did not
vandalize cat traps
In a March 8 article on the van
dalism of cat traps, The Daily said
that "although Stanford has been beset
by numerous animal rights protesters
in recent years, no one has stepped
forward to claim responsibility ..."
As a protesting besetter, I doubt
that animal rights advocates are
mauling traps. It may be pranksters or
those uninformed of the policy worked
out by the University and the Stanford
Cat Network â€” people, like myself,
who are caring for cats.
Early on, as president of the Palo
Alto Humane Society, I cosigned with
the University a letter supporting a
plan to protect cared-for cats, that will
be released if caught by Crane Pest
Control. Cat lovers are themselves now
trapping to spay, collar and tag their
animals.
The message is, if you care for
animals, take responsibility for spaying
and neutering your companion animals.

Plight of white men
is not the problem
In his March 10 column, Burke
Smith states that minorities shouldn't
be bigoted because they might incite
more bigotry in whites. This assump
tion places the responsibility for
change on minorities, those most vic
timized by societal barriers and per
sonal prejudices related to discrimina
tion.
The historical and continual persecu
tion of virtually every minority group
by whites is a reality. Minorities are
correct in stating that whites can't
understand the feeling of discrimina
tion known to almost every racial mi
nority.
As a white man, Smith is a member
of the dominant culture and can't ever
know what life is like as a minority,
who is frequently reminded of his or
her "inferior" status.
But saying that white men "cannot
understand," is not an attempt to
silence and exclude them from the
discourse of racial issues, nor is it an
accusation of guilt by association.
Rather, it is a request that they
acknowledge and respect the suffering
faced by minorities and attempt to
increase their understanding of racial
discrimination.
Whites need to recognize their posi
tion as members of the privileged
"majority" and take responsibility for
any corresponding discrimination,
whether intentional or not.
Part of this mutual understanding
must come from an acceptance of the
responsibility of the way white men
may oppress others. Smith's interest in
the issues of racism and sexism would
be better put to use by increasing his
understanding of these problems, not
by asking minorities to show concern
for the plight of the white male.
