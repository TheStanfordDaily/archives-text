CC XT ELL IS YOUR destiny!"
I I "You will never know the
JL X meaning of real love!"
I looked over to see who was saying
such cheery things and almost hit an
other bicyclist who was doing the same
thing. Just in time, we noticed what was
happening, and I swerved. He smiled,
embarrassed, and turned back to the
crowd that had formed around the
woman in the reggae hat.
I had to get to class; I had seen it all
before anyway. They never varied from
the old routine, and they never drew a
crowd who didn't jeer at everything they
said. Brother Jed and Sister Patty, a
Stanford tradition for who knows how
long.
When I was a sophomore and had more
than a week of college left, I did stop. I
thought it was an acting troupe, and I'm
still not convinced that I was wrong. The
histrionics of fundamentalist preachers
are the easiest things in the world to
mimic, and I've yet to see any halo over
old Jed.
I wasn't among the first there, but I
somehow made it to the front of the
group. When I arrived he was talking
about the fact that women are weaker
than men, and therefore more susceptible
to temptation.
I'm 6-feet tall, for those of you who
couldn't tell from my picture, but I admit
to being weaker than a man of my di
mensions. I can, however, resist tempta
tion as well as any guy, and the good
Brother's remarks ticked me off. So, get
ting into the spirit of the occasion, I
yelled "Up yours!"
He turned toward me and grinned, and

then he lifted high his mighty Fundamen
talist Finger of Righteousness and
pointed it at me. I was expecting a light
ning bolt or two, or at least a crack of
thunder.
"Well, weaker except for some Amazons
who aren't really women at all."
That I did not appreciate. I answered
in kind by lifting my own Finger and
pointing it at Jed.
I didn't get any thunder or lightning
either, but at least I got some applause.
I bowed quickly and left for class.
This year, though, I was already late
for my four-member English class, so I
could only look once, absorb some of the
crowd's commentary and hear Sister
Patty deliver her judgments on us poor
sinning college students.
Why do we put up with this every
year? Is it the spectacle of the thing, or
do we really want to hear what they have
to say?
At the deep South's Auburn University,
Jed gets big groups too, but there they
hold hands and sing hymns. We're
smarter than that, or just more cynical,
and the five or six people who did go
over to talk to Jed were embarrassed if
anyone noticed them.
In the middle of Dead Week, we should
all be studying, or at least lying out, but
instead a hundred people stood around
a low-budget Jim Bakker and jeered,
harassed and whistled.
But did they listen? I think so.
We want him to make sense. We want
him to stop condemning and making up
fake Biblical references. We want some
thing we can argue with because we've
been taught to question everything. We

don't just want something to laugh at.
But what Jed says hardly stands up
to the harsh light of reason or even of
theology. And besides, who wants to argue
with someone who uses vomiting noises
to make his points?
What they're doing is comparable to
my saying that my column is Divinely
inspired. I could make my opinions into
a religion, too.
Litter is disgusting, and if you drop
that Coke can you're going straight to
Hell. Also, if you speak ill of this column,
your tongue will rot off. Neat, huh?
No One would believe me either.
Why? Because we've been conditioned
against accepting religious fundamen
talism since it requires unquestioning
faith in its ministers.
So the Bible doesn't say that masturba
tion will make you blind and insane.
Brother Jed is G-d's voice on Earth, and
he is getting his information right from
the source! Yeah, right! And I suppose
you have a nice bridge to sell me, too.
So we beat on. We crowd around him
every year, hoping he'll actually say some
thing we can sink our teeth into, and he
keeps giving us cotton candy â€” just sugar
and air. So why give him our time?
Variety is the spice of life.
