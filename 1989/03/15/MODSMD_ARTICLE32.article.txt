## Fundamental Standard: relic of a more paternalistic Stanford 
### 
I WRITE IN RESPONSE to the
Student Conduct Legislative Coun
cil's open invitation to comment on
the "Proposed Interpretations and
Applications of the Fundamental Stand
ard," published March 1 in The Daily.
It would be a serious mistake, I
believe, to proceed with this effort. It
is difficult to imagine, for starters, how
the University could enforce the pro
posed rules; the field would be opened
for an incredible crossfire of accusation
and counter-accusation, since few
negative events in life are more fre
quent, or more subject to subjective
interpretation, than attempts to
"degrade, victimize, stigmatize, or
pejoratively characterize persons or
groups."

Perhaps I speak to such an issue
with ratner more relevant experience
than most. Back around 1968-72 I had
about as thorough an exposure to what
it feels like to be the target of at
tempts to "degrade, victimize, stig
matize, or perjoratively characterize" a
person as anyone is likely to have.
Appealing though the thought might
occasionally have been to me at the
time, I cannot bring myself to believe
that it would have been a good thing
for Stanford had I been in a position
to bring to the bar of justice all of the
individuals who addressed me in this
way. Nor do I imagine that very many
of those now calling for judicial
penalties for anyone guilty of such
"personal attacks" would have favored

arming the University Provost or
President with the council's proposed
weapon of judicial counterattack.
Why, I wonder, does the council
imagine that over our 200-plus years
of experience with the First Amend
ment the problem of damaging or
humiliating "personal attacks" has
somehow escaped the notice of the
Supreme Court, or of acute Constitu
tional scholars?
The root of the problem, in my view,
is that the Fundamental Standard,
dating back to the first of my
predecessors in the Office of President,
is the kind of policy statement suited
to the paternalistic sort of institution
that Stanford was then, and not the
markedly more public institution of

today.
The reason why the "Fun Stan"
worked in the 1900 sand doesn't in
the 1980s is precisely that there was a
degree of community agreement as to
what constitutes appropriate standards
of behavior merely by wishing for it.
It is this very development that the
council's draft ignores, by its reference
to "accepted community standards."
Either this phrase is meaningless, in
which case the whole enforcement
effort is nullified from the start, or it
will be given meaning by a subgroup
or subgroups of this "community," to
the detriment of those not included in
the process of definition.
As a threshold test of the usefulness
of the council's approach I suggest that

you ask yourselves the question: What
would have been the fate of the civil
rights movement of the 1960s had it
been constrained by the "accepted
community standards" of, say, Bir
mingham, Ala. at that time?
It seems to me that the council,
along with some others in the Univer
sity are being panicked by an ugly
situation that is simply not amenable
to successful treatment through legisla
tion and policing. We should be reluc
tant to proceed into a quagmire of
litigious acrimony by adopting any
such maladroit statement as that pub
lished by the council last week.
