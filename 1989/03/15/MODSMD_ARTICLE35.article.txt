# Instilling confidence and offering academic support
## Program helps children tap into their futures

When 9-year-old Adelita Cuevas grows
up, she wants to be a policewoman so that
she can "catch men."
But Cuevas may never get a chance to
wear a badge. She may not graduate from
high school.
Cuevas lives in East Palo Alto, a com
munity of lower-income minority families,
with little tax base, overcrowded schools
and considerable high school dropout rates.
According to Charlie Knight, the super
intendent of schools for East Palo Alto's
Ravenswood Elementary School District,
the dropout rate for students who leave
the Ravenswood district and enter high
school is around 30 percent. Other sources
associated with the district place the figure
as high as 40 to 50 percent.
Unlike most Stanford students, graduat
ing from high school will be a significant
achievement for Cuevas.
Through a tutorial program called Barrio
Assistance, 64 Stanford student volunteers
are trying to help Cuevas and others like
her not only graduate from high school but
succeed there as well.
Established in 1973 by Stanford Chicano
students, the program combats high school
dropout rates in the local area by providing
academic help and confidence to young
Latino children in a supportive environ
ment. Children in the program range in
age from 6 to 12.
"The children are just full of ideas. You
just have to tap it. Half the problem is
they don't have the confidence," said grad
uate student Laurent Meister. Meister has
been tutoring in the program for a year
and a half.
To instill confidence and provide aca
demic help, members of Barrio Assistance
pick up 58 children from their homes on
Saturday mornings and bring them to El
Centro Chicano in White Plaza.
After student coordinators serve the
children a hot breakfast, student volunteers
arrive to provide an hour and a half of

one-on-one tutoring in math and reading,
which is then followed by 45 minutes of
recreational time.
Freshman Laura Dyer has been tutoring
6-year-old Noe Moreno since October,
focusing on improving his language skills.
Moreno finds reading difficult, so Dyer
makes use of Moreno's own talents to make
reading easier for him.
"Noe is very good with his hands, like
copying and tracing, so we use activity
books which help him read so it is not as
much as a chore," she said.
Moreno said he enjoys the program and
comes every Saturday, although he likes
playing games like Connect Four and add
ing "a lot better than reading."
Dyer also looks forward to the recrea-.
tional time she gets to spend with Moreno.
"The last 45 minutes you really get to
grow close to the kids," she said. "We've
done lots of things like going to the
pumpkin patches and carving pumpkins.
Christmas was the best. We decorated a
big tree and got presents for the kids."
Barrio Assistance is a tutor/mentor pro
gram, according to student coordinator Cliff
Rachlin. Each child is teamed with an in
dividual tutor for the duration of the year
so that a "big brother, big sister" relation
ship will develop. If the relationship
flourishes, the tutor and child will be re
assigned the following year.
This one-on-one relationship benefits the
child and the tutor as well. Tutors often
express feelings of personal accomplish
ment. Dyer said she began tutoring because
she wanted to become involved in the com
munity. Being in Barrio Assistance makes
her feel "like I am making a difference in
the community," she said.
Junior Margo Ponce agreed with Dyer.
Margo joined the program to help a child
and to develop a sense of personal ac
complishment. "I saw an opportunity to
help one-on-one with an individual and see
some progress," she said. "It gives me a
lot of personal satisfaction to see weekly
progress. In other activities you don't see

an actual individual benefit from the things
you do."
Because Spanish is the first language of
most of the children, the program takes a
"conceptual approach" in tutoring the
children, stressing neither Spanish nor
English, but whichever is beneficial for the
child, Rachlin said.
The tutor will have the child use which
ever language the child is most comfortable
with to reach the fullest possible under
standing of concepts.
Thus, a child can learn concepts in
Spanish and implement those concepts in
English once he learns the language.
"If Spanish is necessary to build their

skill like reading, math or their ability to
express themselves, we'll use Spanish, be
cause the English will come," Rachlin said.
"We do not invalidate either language."
The children receiving tutoring at Barrio
Assistance are referred to the program by
their school teachers. Most are assigned to
the program because they are having lan
guage difficulties, said senior Sandy San
doval, also a program coordinator. Sandoval
said that although a child's reading com
prehension in Spanish may be excellent,
many of the children are often tracked into
special education programs because of dif
ficulties reading English.
