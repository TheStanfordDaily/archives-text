# Arches to arches, dust to dust: Quad falling apart

The Quad is crum-
After nearly a cent-
/ ary as a symbol of Stanford,
â€¢ the decorative sandstone in the
Quad is slowly deteriorating be
cause of sprinkler irrigation, rain
water run-off and rotted ivy.
According to Tom Richman of
the Planning Office, sprinklers
have caused the greatest damage
to a low wall at the front of the
Quad and the bases of 276
columns.
However, the main dilemma for
the University, and a cause for
much debate has been determin
ing how much restoration is ethi
cally correct, according to Susan
Calderon, project manager for the
Main Quad Restoration Project.
To restore the damage, which
is purely cosmetic, the original

sandstone material would be
replaced with pre-cast stone, a
more cost-efficient and readily
available medium.
"The danger is you break down
the integrity of its original state,"
Calderon said.
Calderon is currently seeking
funding for the project which will
cost an estimated $1 million for
minimum prevention, almost $3
million for partial restoration or
more than $4 million for complete
restoration.
"Budgets are tight here, and
there are a lot of other things
competing for money," Calderon
said.
The Historical Society at Stan
ford is one group which supports
complete restoration. According
to Rixford Snyder, president of
the society, "the purpose of our
Historical Society is to try to
preserve basic institutions and
worthwhile traditions, and the
Quad is one of them."

Snyder said he is frustrated
that the University has not given
more immediate support to the
Quad.
However, Richard Bennett,
budget coordinator for the Cen
tennial Campaign, said he is un
sure that the Quad is a project
that would interest many con
tributors.
"Most donors want to make an
impact. They want to know that
because they have given a gift,
Stanford is going to do more,"
Bennett said. "If they think you
are going to repair the Quad any
way, they don't want to donate to
that cause."
As the struggle to raise money
continues, so does the planning.
In 1987, the University hired the
Architectural Resources Group to
help determine the extent of the
damage and possible options for
the University.
Recommendations from the
group include landscaping which

does not require
spray irrigation,
tional rain gutters and
downspouts, and the
tion of low-viscosity liquids to the
sandstone which would help res
tore some of the Quad's internal
strength.
But, this process has a "catch,"
Calderon said. There is the ques
tion of whether too much preven
tion will cause the University to
fall too far behind in the restora
tion.
Despite the time and money
restraints, Calderon said she feels
"there may finally be some light
at the end of the tunnel."
"The Quad has long been
known as the academic heart of
the campus, and it really em
bodies the Centennial spirit," Cal
deron said. "You don't see many
buildings like it in the West. It is
a very special building."
