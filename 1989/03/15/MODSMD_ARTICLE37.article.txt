# Forget crowd control problems, fix the projectors Bug offers treatise on trials, tribulations of Flicks
## 
### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
Just a short treatise concerning
the Sunday Flicks here, before we
get started.
Okay, for those of you who
weren't there, and as a reminder
to members of the full-capacity
crowd who were, here's a brief
summary of last Sunday's Flicks
situation for the 9:30 p.m. screen
ing.
First, we get in there about 20
minutes late. Then some serious
dork gets on the intercom, or
whatever, and starts doing his im
itation of an (excuse the redun
dancy) insecure high school prin
cipal, sort of a combination of the
guy from "Ferris Bueller's Day
Off," the guy in"The Breakfast
Club,"and the "dickless" EPA guy
in "Ghostbusters." (Or, for that
matter, the characters the latter
two actors played in the ensuing
film, "Die Hard.")
Apparently, Mr. Power Trip is
a little upset with our conduct,
labeling those who caused a
"serious crowd control problem"
as "jerks" (effectively, the Flicks
administrators were the culprits)
and warning us all that he has
Stanford police at the ready to
come in and "bother" us should
we get unruly. I guess he meant
the cops would sit next to us and
talk incessantly during the film,
or sit in front of us and wear big
hats.

Mr. Power Trip went on for a
while castigating us with his amp
lified voice from some unseen
booth, like the Wizard of Oz, and
explained that one of the two
projectors had broken, so the film
would be stopped every 15
minutes for a few minutes of reel
changing. He then generously
granted any discontents permis
sion to leave and pick up a full
refund.
Fortunately, the movie was "Die
Hard," a darn exciting film, and
so virtually everyone stayed, and
it held our attention despite the
non-commercial breaks.
Although "Die Hard" was a
non-stop thriller, its action at
times was as absurdly implausible
as a movie theater not arranging
access to a back-up projector.
There were a number of fairly
unbelievable sequences and a cou
ple wholly unfathomable events
which detracted from the film's
overall effect.
In the fairly unbelievable cate
gory, we had Bruce Willis plum
meting 20 feet down an air shaft
before saving his life by grabbing
onto a vent ledge with his finger.
Also, toward the end of the film,
one of the major bad guys
redefined resilience by managing
to release his neck from a chain
noose while suspended at least 10
feet off the ground and after
having hung there unconscious
for about 10 minutes.
In the wholly unfathomable cat

egory, the guy sitting next to
Bruce Willis on the plane
proclaimed that walking barefoot
on a carpet in a particular manner
alleviates air travel stress.
Then, at the end of the film,
Bruce actually didn't laugh at his
estranged wife when (now that
he's a hero) she wanted to reunite
with him. A more realistic ending
would have had him begin his life
anew as husband to Al, the
Twinkie aficionado/police ser
geant who had compassionately
helped Bruce through his ordeal.
But most amazing of all, two
hours into the film many audience
members were still throwing

paper around during the reel
changes. Psychiatrists say it's the
sad result of snowball fight
deprivation.
To misquote H.L. Mencken, "A
man will never go poor underes
timating the stress release mech
anisms of nerds." Maybe the
ASSU should blow off this movie
business and simply arrange a
weekly balled-up paper barrage so
that these zany students could al
leviate all their well-earned anx
iety.
Anyways, I'm sorry to take up
so much of your time with that
"short treatise." You didn't have
anything else to do, did you?
Dear Bug,
What does "YKK," found on
many zippers, mean?
— Hercule Poirot
YKK is the name of the com
pany which manufactures those
zippers along with other fabric
store accessories. It is based in
Macon, Ga., and the name is sim
ply the initials of the founder,
Yoshida Kogyo Kitama, according
to a YKK representative at its San
Francisco branch.
This embossment on many of
the world's zippers has played a
vital part in the development of
the common admonition, "XYZ
PDQ BIL," which of course sits
for "eXamine Your Zipper Pretty
Damn Quick Before I Look."
The YKK employee I spoke to
about this matter said he was not

authorized to discuss this phrase,
but the Bug understands that
Kitama decided to put his initials
in the crotch of America in hopes
that he would become part of our
lexicon of linguistic gimmickry.
Indeed, during the early 19705,
Southeastern dialect included the
phrase "XYZ PDQ BIL A YKK"
— meaning "... Before I Look At
Your Kute Kritter" — but it was
quickly phrased out for reasons
the Bug cannot divulge.
Dear Bug,
Why are there two doors into
Old Union when you're not sup
posed to use one of them ?

Who wasted money in building
two doors and then making signs
telling you not to use them?
- I. M. Pei
Bug Me savior Bruce Wiggins,
from Operations and Mainte
nance, came through with the an
swer to this one. Like last week's
murder question, this is no joking
matter.
I will say, however, that if
you're ever in a jamb, whether or
not you live may hinge on this
information.
First, there are a couple reasons
to have two doors. Architecturally,
the two-door look is often consid
ered preferable for tradition and
symmetry purposes.
In older buildings, like Old Un
ion, the two-door system origi
nally worked like this: The left
hand door (as you exited) had
head and foot bolts which made
it the "inactive leaf," unless you
broke your fingernail trying to
pull out the levers at the top and
bottom of the door. So only the
right door was used.
Then, in the 1940s or '50s, Wig
gins said, fire laws were estab
lished to require that well
populated buildings could be
easily exited. Thus, "panic hard
ware" was invented and a "push
bar" replaced the doorknob so
throngs of screaming people could
open the door just by running into
it. Handles to pull the door open
were added to the outside.
