For sale: one notebook-sized computer,
with one million processors each blazing
along at one billion instructions per sec
ond. Memory capacity enough to hold
every book ever written and 10 million
feature-length movies, with plenty of
room to spare.
Also accepts two plug-in storage tapes
each with 1,000 times more memory. All
parts encased in a durable one-piece dia
mond matrix. Runs off either sunlight
or the 10-year internal battery. Price:
$100 or best offer.
Sounds a little fishy? Well, according
to a new developing field of research
called nanotechnology, something like it
may be possible within the next half
century, along with a host of other ap
plications in everything from manufac
turing to medicine.
With nanotechnology, companies could
use patterns stored in a computer to
"grow" perfect rocket engines or food
from cheap raw materials. Doctors could
cure any injury or disease, including
aging, without the trauma of surgery.
Environmentalists could cleanse the
ground, air and water of pollution,
reverse the greenhouse effect and repair
the ozone layer.
This is not just science fiction.
Nanotechnology may allow us to do all
this well within the known laws of na
ture, nanotechnologists say.
"Nano" means "billionth," and in
nanotechnology sizes are measured in
nanometers, and times in nanoseconds.
At present, nanotechnology is the study
of engineering at the molecular level. En
gineers, computer scientists and
molecular biologists are now asking what
devices can be built using atoms and
small molecules as the functional and
structural units.
Nanotechnology is largely the brain

his ideas have achieved widespread ac
ceptance in the scientific community.
Nanotechnology might open up limitless
opportunities to scientists, especially com
puter scientists.
Custom-designed molecules
According to Drexler, "Nanotechnology
proper will be based on assemblers,"
which will be bacteria-sized factories able
to put together molecules to create just
about anything. For now, however, en
gineers can only sketch out designs for
various "nanomachines," while scientists
work on developing present-day technol
ogy to achieve more sophisticated
molecular engineering capabilities.
"The key to developing nanotechnology
appears to be learning to build molecular
objects with substantial size," Drexler
said. "The molecular machines that biol
ogy uses seem to be proteins."
In living cells, enzymes and other
proteins are the primary molecular mac
hines. Scientists' abilities to create
custom-designed proteins seem to be in
creasing.
William DeGrado of DuPont recently
designed and manufactured a protein
that has three times greater stability than
typical natural proteins that size. Even
tually, nanotechnologists may be able to
custom design enzymes to perform spe
cific molecular actions, and use these en
zymes to construct complex non-protein
nanomachines.
Drexler concedes that these develop
ments may take two or three decades.

Ralph Merkle, a researcher in computer
security at Xerox's Palo Alto research
center, said nanotechnology is likely to
have "substantial implications in the
computer field within 20 years or so."
Memory and lots of it
One of the first applications is likely
to be information storage. At the IBM
Almaden research center, scientists have
modified a sheet of graphite by depositing
molecules at specific locations on its sur
face.
Merkle said that by using this method,
one can achieve high memory densities,
in which one "bit" of information occu
pies a space a few angstroms across. A
bit is the simplest chunk of information:
either an "on" or an "off" signal. That
comes out to be more than 100 trillion
bits per square centimeter of surface area.
But this figure "pales in insignificance"
alongside the densities that could be
achieved with densely packed molecular
tapes, Merkle said.
The genetic code, DNA, is a natural
example of a molecular memory tape.
The total storage capacity of the DNA
in all of one person's cells is on the order
of a trillion trillion bits.
"If such a storage capacity exists in
nature, we should be able to do at least
as well," said Merkle. For one thing, only
a tiny fraction of a cell's volume is taken
up by DNA. And in DNA, many atoms
are used per bit of information stored.
Drexler has proposed creating long
polymer chains using only a few atoms
per bit, packing these chains into large
bundles, and reading and writing onto
them like tapes using molecule-sized
scanners. Because it is not just limited
to a surface area, this system would push
the limits of memory density with about
10 billion trillion bits per cubic centime
ter.
"[These densitiesl should be achievable,
but it's about 50 years away," Merkle
said.

Other designs could be used to create
a fast random-access memory with
storage densities on the order of 100 mil
lion trillion bits per cubic centimeter, ac
cording to Merkle. Or one could opt for
small size, and fit one billion bits of
memory within the volume of a single
bacterium.

The logic of computers
But what kind of a computer would
be suited to use such a tiny storage sys
tem? Obviously, a nanocomputer.
Computers are built using large num
bers of simple elements called logic gates.
