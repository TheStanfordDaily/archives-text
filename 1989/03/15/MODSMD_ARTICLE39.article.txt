# Inside the Nanocomputer
## 
### 

The nanocomputer is a grid of complex molecules consisting of knobs
attached to long control rods. One rod with two knobs Is seen from the
side; two more rods with knobs are seen end on. One nanometer (nm) Is
one billionth of a meter.


During computation, the horizontal rod is pulled to the left. One of the
end-on rods Is now blocked while the other is unblocked in a mechanical
imitation of the transistor.
