# Program to focus on ethnic content
## Students will be able to expand the scope of courses they have taken 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
In a long-range effort to attract mi
norities to the teaching field, the Uni
versity has created a new program that
allows students to work one-on-one with
faculty to bring new ethnic material
into existing courses.
The three-phase program will allow
students who have already completed a
course to approach a professor with
ideas on ways to improve it by inter
weaving new ethnic materials. If the
professor agrees, the student will re
search new materials in the libraries
for about a month, according to Charles
Junkerman, asst. dean of undergradu
ate studies. The student will receive a

stipend of $250.
For example, a student who has taken
a course on American electoral politics
might do research on black voter reg
istration in the South, Junkerman said.
Over the summer, the second phase
of the program will continue by building
on the intial research, if the student
and the professor agree. The program
will develop a "mentor relationship" be
tween the student and the professor, in
which the student will work through
the material, compile notes, have con
ferences with the professor, and maybe
write a lecture for the professor to use
in the next teaching quarter. The sum
mer stipend totals $2,000.
The third phase will allow the student
to be a teaching assistant for the course.

The student would be paid by the indi
vidual department.
Junkerman said the program is de
signed to "try as hard as we can to
remedy" the lack of minorities in teach
ing positions — although the program
will be open to non-minority students.
"We're hoping to hook [minorities],"
he said. "Hopefully they will be exposed
to the pleasures of academic life" and
want to pursue an academic career.
Junkerman and Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies Tom Wasow got the idea
for the program a year ago from Karen
Romer, a dean at Brown University.
The program at Brown has been in op
eration for two years, and according to
Junkerman, "a good idea deserves
to be ripped off."
"The program was tailored for
Stanford's needs," said Wasow. A
proposal was put in for funds from
the Irvine Foundation, a grant de

signed for the ethnic studies pro
gram. The new program is one of
several that will share the $6 mil
lion with three main ethnic
studies programs: the Undergrad
uate Scholars Program, the Mar
tin Luther King Jr. Papers Project
and the Stanford Teacher Educa
tion Project.
Based on the Brown model,
Wasow said he expects approxi

mately 10 students to participate
in the program each year. Cur
rently, there is funding only for
the first year, but "presuming the
program is successful, there will
be more funding," he said.
Although students will not
receive units for the course —
only a stipend — Wasow said he
may consider granting units if stu
dents want them.
