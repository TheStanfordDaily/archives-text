# Bone loss later in life is preventable now
## 
### Lauren Friedly Staff writer 
It is estimated that one in four
women will develop osteoporosis
in their lifetimes. This crippling
disease affects about 20 million
older Americans, mostly women.
Although you might feel and
appear to be in good health, os
teoporosis can be present in a
painless and unrecognized form
for decades.

The key to preventing os
teoporosis is to increase your bone
mass as early in life as possible
by stockpiling calcium in your
bones, thus decreasing the rate
of bone loss.
Osteoporosis, which means
porous bone, is a disease that
speeds up the natural loss of bone
calcium until the skeleton be
comes porous, light and fragile.
Women have a faster rate of
bone loss than men and a smaller
bone mass contributing to the
higher incidence of osteoporosis
in women.
Bone is a living tissue that is

continually "turning over." New
bone is added, and old bone is
broken down. Bones stop growing
at around age 18, but can become
more dense with a calcium-rich
diet until age 35. Influenced by
genetic, lifestyle and hormonal
factors, after age 35 there is a
gradual loss of bone.
Women can lose up to 50 per
cent of their bone calcium by age
60 and not even know it. But, the
all-too-familiar results are
stooped posture and painful frac
tures of the spine, hip and wrist.
All of these problems can be
controlled and even prevented
early in life through increased ex
ercise and calcium intake, and by
limiting alcohol, caffeine and
protein intake.
Regular exercise stimulates
bone formation. Exercise should
be weight-bearing activity such as
running, walking, aerobics, tennis
or jumping rope. Weight lifting
may also have a strengthening ef
fect on the bones. A 20-minute
exercise routine at least three
times a week is recommended.
Excessive alcohol and caffeine
intake accelerates bone loss by re
ducing calcium absorption from
the intestine and replacing
calcium-rich foods in the diet. A
diet too high in protein seems to
increase excretion of calcium in
the urine. Cutting these sub

stances out of the diet completely
is not necessary as long as they
are not replacing calcium-rich
foods and beverages.
Calcium intake is the most cru
cial modifiable risk factor for os
teoporosis. Women, at early ages,
need to carefully monitor their
calcium intake. Store shelves are
filled with calcium supplements,
pills and foods with added calcium
supplements.

Calcium intake is the
most crucial modifi
able risk factor for os
teoporosis.

However, using calcium pill
supplements to replace calcium
rich foods is not your best choice.
Nutrients should come from your
food first, as foods have a com
bination of nutrients that helps
your body absorb calcium.
The National Institutes of
Health recommend 1,000 mil
ligrams a day of calcium for all
pre-menopausal women. Three
servings of calcium-rich foods in
your diet every day should be suf
ficient. Supplements may be used
as insurance along with the foods
you eat.
If it is necessary to supplement

your diet with calcium pills, check
with your physician or
nutritionist about the type of sup
plement to take.
The best sources of calcium are
dairy products such as milk, but
ter, yogurt, cheese and ice cream.
Many young women fear that
if they increase their calcium in
take, they will also increase
calories and gain weight. But,
calcium-rich foods do not have to
be high in calories. Non-fat milk
and yogurt and lower fat cheeses
are also good sources of calcium.
And, if you don't like milk, dis
guise it. For example, heat a cup
of nonfat milk and add a teaspoon
of instant coffee or hot chocolate.
Women who have irregular and
infrequent menstrual periods may
be at higher risk for osteoporosis
because their calcium absorption
is lower than regularly menstruat
ing women. Estrogen and other
circulating hormones seem to play
a crucial role in the bone-thinning
process.
Dieters and long-distance run
ners whose periods are irregular
or infrequent may actually be in
creasing their chances of getting
this disease and should seek in
formation about ways to prevent
it.

at around age 18, but can become
more dense with a calcium-rich
diet until age 35. Influenced by
genetic, lifestyle and hormonal
factors, after age 35 there is a
gradual loss of bone.
Women can lose up to 50 per
cent of their bone calcium by age
60 and not even know it. But, the
all-too-familiar results are
stooped posture and painful frac
tures of the spine, hip and wrist.
All of these problems can be
controlled and even prevented
early in life through increased ex
ercise and calcium intake, and by
limiting alcohol, caffeine and
protein intake.
Regular exercise stimulates
bone formation. Exercise should
be weight-bearing activity such as
running, walking, aerobics, tennis
or jumping rope. Weight lifting
may also have a strengthening ef
fect on the bones. A 20-minute
exercise routine at least three
times a week is recommended.
Excessive alcohol and caffeine
intake accelerates bone loss by re
ducing calcium absorption from
the intestine and replacing
calcium-rich foods in the diet. A
diet too high in protein seems to
increase excretion of calcium in
the urine. Cutting these sub

stances out of the diet completely
is not necessary as long as they
are not replacing calcium-rich
foods and beverages.
Calcium intake is the most cru
cial modifiable risk factor for os
teoporosis. Women, at early ages,
need to carefully monitor their
calcium intake. Store shelves are
filled with calcium supplements,
pills and foods with added calcium
supplements.

Calcium intake is the
most crucial modifi
able risk factor for os
teoporosis.

However, using calcium pill
supplements to replace calcium
rich foods is not your best choice.
Nutrients should come from your
food first, as foods have a com
bination of nutrients that helps
your body absorb calcium.
The National Institutes of
Health recommend 1,000 mil
ligrams a day of calcium for all
pre-menopausal women. Three
servings of calcium-rich foods in
your diet every day should be suf
ficient. Supplements may be used
as insurance along with the foods
you eat.
If it is necessary to supplement

your diet with calcium pills, check
with your physician or
nutritionist about the type of sup
plement to take.
The best sources of calcium are
dairy products such as milk, but
ter, yogurt, cheese and ice cream.
Many young women fear that
if they increase their calcium in
take, they will also increase
calories and gain weight. But,
calcium-rich foods do not have to
be high in calories. Non-fat milk
and yogurt and lower fat cheeses
are also good sources of calcium.
And, if you don't like milk, dis
guise it. For example, heat a cup
of nonfat milk and add a teaspoon
of instant coffee or hot chocolate.
Women who have irregular and
infrequent menstrual periods may
be at higher risk for osteoporosis
because their calcium absorption
is lower than regularly menstruat
ing women. Estrogen and other
circulating hormones seem to play
a crucial role in the bone-thinning
process.
Dieters and long-distance run
ners whose periods are irregular
or infrequent may actually be in
creasing their chances of getting
this disease and should seek in
formation about ways to prevent
it.
