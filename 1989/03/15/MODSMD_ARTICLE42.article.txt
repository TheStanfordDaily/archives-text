## Hoops loses to Arizona, gets East No. 3 seed 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
INGLEWOOD, Calif. - Free
throws. They were a problem all
weekend for the Stanford men's
basketball team, and none worse
than the free throws of the ball
into the Arizona Wildcats' hands.

Men's Basketball
Cardinal 2nd at Pac-10 Tourney

After it proved it was the No.
2 team in the conference with
wins over USC and UCLA in its
first two games of the Pacific 10
Conference Tournament, Stanford
. . . proved it was the No. 2 team
in the conference by turning the
ball and the Pac-10 Championship
over to the top-seeded and nation
ally top-ranked Wildcats, 73-51
before 10,403 at the Great West
ern Forum.
Harried by Arizona's pressure
defense, Stanford made 23 turn
overs — almost as many as the
28 shots the Cardinal took.
Though Stanford did make 67.8
percent of those field-goal at
tempts, the Cardinal missed half
of its 26 free-throw tries and only
managed two offensive rebounds
in 40 minutes, making it impos
sible to stay in the game.
"We just didn't handle the pres
sure well," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "We got beat
very soundly; I don't think there's
any question about that."
Two-time Pac-10 Player of the
Year and Pac-10 Tournament
Most Valuable Player Sean Elliott
led Arizona with 21 points, while
Jud Buechler provided solid sup
port with 16. They were joined
on the all-tourney team by team
mate Anthony Cook, Stanford
guard Todd Lichti and Oregon
State guard Gary Payton. Only
Buechler did not receive similar
honors last year.
The 12th-ranked Cardinal (26-
6) could console itself with the
news, which came during the sec
ond half of the Arizona game, that

it was seeded No. 3 in the East
Regional of the NCAA tourna
ment, officially ending the 47-year
dry spell that has been both the
albatross and the motivation for
generations of Stanford basketball
teams.
"I'm very proud of this team,"
Montgomery said.
Stanford will open play at
Greensboro, N.C. Thursday
against the Siena Saints at 11:37
a.m. PST. A full NCAA tourna
ment preview for both the men's
and women's teams will appear
in a special issue of The Daily
tomorrow.
By surviving a scare by last
place USC Friday, 66-61, and then
thrashing No. 3 seed UCLA 95-86
Saturday (Stanford's first win
against UCLA in Los Angeles
since 1952), Stanford cemented
that No. 3 seed. Montgomery
could not remember the last time
Stanford had put together a better
overall performance than it did
against the Bruins.
But everyone remembered the
last time the Cardinal played as
poorly as it did Sunday. That was
11 games before, the last time
Stanford lost. And it was at Ari
zona.


April Pearson — Daily file
Freshman forward Adam Keefe goes up in traffic. Keefe had a spectacular weekend
at the Pac-10 tournament in Inglewood, Calif.
Like that game, Sunday's ended
with a score almost identical to
that 72-52 loss in January and,
even more disturbing, an identical
11 points for Stanford guard Todd
Lichti. Most gnawing, however,
was the way the Cardinal lost its
poise.
All season long, Stanford, led
by six seniors, has been praised
for its experience and maturity.
But when the Cardinal struggled
against the Arizona press, its
turnovers, compounded by missed
free throws, made Stanford's
presence in the game, both
literally and figuratively, no more.
Leading 8-6 with under 16
minutes to go in the first half,
Stanford forward Howard Wright
(who led with the team with 12
points and five rebounds)
rebounded the ball, giving Stan
ford a chance to build up a lead.
But on its next five possessions,
Stanford only got one shot at
tempt (by Lichti) compared to
four turnovers. Arizona scored six

points in a mere 61-second span
and took the lead for good.
Then, with 13:02 remaining in
the half, Stanford freshman Adam
Keefe made only one of two from
the line after being fouled by Ar
izona center Anthony Cook. By it
self, it would seem insignificant,
but as the misses piled up it
changed the complexion of the
game from one Stanford was very
much in to one that Stanford was
very much out of.
In fact, during the entire week
end, Stanford went to the free
throw line to shoot two 43 times,
but converted both only 13 times,
including 2-for-12 against Arizo
na.
"The free throws hurt us again,
and I don't really understand
that," Montgomery said. "We've
been a good free-throw shooting
team over time. Not that that
changes the fact that Arizona ap
peared to be in control, but it's a
different game."
After the teams traded baskets
to make the score 14-11 Arizona
with 11:55 left in the half, Arizona
went on another 6-0 run over the
next 1:18 as Stanford turned the

ball over on four consecutive pos
sessions.
Overall, Arizona outscored
Stanford 37-19 over the final 16
minutes of the half a3 Stanford
made 15 turnovers, missed five
of 10 free throws, and grabbed
only five total rebounds to negate
its 73.3-percent first-half shoot
ing.
"Looking at the percentages it
was pretty obvious we had trouble
stopping their shots," Arizona
Coach Lute Olson said. "But 28
shots is not enough, I don't think,
to beat us."
"We had trouble getting into
our offense again today," Lichti
said. "We start worrying about
our passes, things like that.... I
think we were looking for guys in
certain spots and when they
weren't there we just started
panicking."
There was hardly a moment of
panic the day before against
UCLA. Buoyed by the presence of
a traveling contingent of Cardinal
supporters over 700 strong, Stan
ford efficiently built up its lead
to six within the first 4:17, 10
within the first 7:41, 15 within

the first 14:53 and 21 just before
halftime.
"They had some great interior
passing, and they recognized our
defenses well, and made layups,"
said UCLA guard Pooh Richard
son, who led the Bruins with 24
points and five assists.
"They played awfully well,"
Bruins Coach Jim Harrick said.
"They played probably as well as
they've played all year.... They
beat us good in every phase of
the game. They knock your socks
off."
Perhaps the biggest perform
ance Saturday was turned in by
senior forward Bryan McSweeney.
Forced into extended action after
starter Andrew Vlahov got into
foul trouble, McSweeney had 14
points, three rebounds and three
assists in 24 minutes.
"Here's a perfect example of
being ready when you have to be
ready," said Montgomery of
McSweeney, who was replaced by
Vlahov in the starting lineup in
the season's sixth game. "I
suspect this is something Bryan
will remember for the rest of his
life."

"We just didn't handle the pres

Montgomery said. "We got beat
very soundly; I don't think there's
any question about that."

The 12th-ranked Cardinal (26-
6) could console itself with the
news, which came during the sec
ond half of the Arizona game, that

it was seeded No. 3 in the East

dry spell that has been both the
albatross and the motivation for
generations of Stanford basketball
teams.
"I'm very proud of this team,"

By surviving a scare by last
place USC Friday, 66-61, and then
thrashing No. 3 seed UCLA 95-86
Saturday (Stanford's first win
against UCLA in Los Angeles
since 1952), Stanford cemented
that No. 3 seed. Montgomery
could not remember the last time
Stanford had put together a better
overall performance than it did
against the Bruins.
But everyone remembered the
last time the Cardinal played as
poorly as it did Sunday. That was
11 games before, the last time
Stanford lost. And it was at Ari
zona.


April Pearson — Daily file
Freshman forward Adam Keefe goes up in traffic. Keefe had a spectacular weekend
at the Pac-10 tournament in Inglewood, Calif.
Like that game, Sunday's ended
with a score almost identical to
that 72-52 loss in January and,
even more disturbing, an identical
11 points for Stanford guard Todd
Lichti. Most gnawing, however,
was the way the Cardinal lost its
poise.
All season long, Stanford, led
by six seniors, has been praised
for its experience and maturity.
But when the Cardinal struggled
against the Arizona press, its
turnovers, compounded by missed
free throws, made Stanford's
presence in the game, both
literally and figuratively, no more.
Leading 8-6 with under 16
minutes to go in the first half,
Stanford forward Howard Wright
(who led with the team with 12
points and five rebounds)
rebounded the ball, giving Stan
ford a chance to build up a lead.
But on its next five possessions,
Stanford only got one shot at
tempt (by Lichti) compared to
four turnovers. Arizona scored six

points in a mere 61-second span
and took the lead for good.
Then, with 13:02 remaining in
the half, Stanford freshman Adam
Keefe made only one of two from
the line after being fouled by Ar
izona center Anthony Cook. By it
self, it would seem insignificant,
but as the misses piled up it
changed the complexion of the
game from one Stanford was very
much in to one that Stanford was
very much out of.
In fact, during the entire week
end, Stanford went to the free
throw line to shoot two 43 times,
but converted both only 13 times,
including 2-for-12 against Arizo
na.
"The free throws hurt us again,
and I don't really understand
that," Montgomery said. "We've
been a good free-throw shooting
team over time. Not that that
changes the fact that Arizona ap
peared to be in control, but it's a
different game."
After the teams traded baskets
to make the score 14-11 Arizona
with 11:55 left in the half, Arizona
went on another 6-0 run over the
next 1:18 as Stanford turned the

ball over on four consecutive pos
sessions.
Overall, Arizona outscored
Stanford 37-19 over the final 16
minutes of the half a3 Stanford
made 15 turnovers, missed five
of 10 free throws, and grabbed
only five total rebounds to negate
its 73.3-percent first-half shoot
ing.
"Looking at the percentages it
was pretty obvious we had trouble
stopping their shots," Arizona
Coach Lute Olson said. "But 28
shots is not enough, I don't think,
to beat us."
"We had trouble getting into
our offense again today," Lichti
said. "We start worrying about
our passes, things like that.... I
think we were looking for guys in
certain spots and when they
weren't there we just started
panicking."
There was hardly a moment of
panic the day before against
UCLA. Buoyed by the presence of
a traveling contingent of Cardinal
supporters over 700 strong, Stan
ford efficiently built up its lead
to six within the first 4:17, 10
within the first 7:41, 15 within

the first 14:53 and 21 just before
halftime.
"They had some great interior
passing, and they recognized our
defenses well, and made layups,"
said UCLA guard Pooh Richard
son, who led the Bruins with 24
points and five assists.
"They played awfully well,"
Bruins Coach Jim Harrick said.
"They played probably as well as
they've played all year.... They
beat us good in every phase of
the game. They knock your socks
off."
Perhaps the biggest perform
ance Saturday was turned in by
senior forward Bryan McSweeney.
Forced into extended action after
starter Andrew Vlahov got into
foul trouble, McSweeney had 14
points, three rebounds and three
assists in 24 minutes.
"Here's a perfect example of
being ready when you have to be
ready," said Montgomery of
McSweeney, who was replaced by
Vlahov in the starting lineup in
the season's sixth game. "I
suspect this is something Bryan
will remember for the rest of his
life."
INGLEWOOD, Calif. - Free
throws. They were a problem all

basketball team, and none worse
than the free throws of the ball
into the Arizona Wildcats' hands.

Cardinal 2nd at Pac-10 Tourney

After it proved it was the No.
