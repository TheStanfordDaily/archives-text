## Hoops loses to Arizona, gets East No. 3 seed

INGLEWOOD, Calif. - Free
throws. They were a problem all
weekend for the Stanford men's
basketball team, and none worse
than the free throws of the ball
into the Arizona Wildcats' hands.

Men's Basketball
Cardinal 2nd at Pac-10 Tourney

After it proved it was the No.
2 team in the conference with
wins over USC and UCLA in its
first two games of the Pacific 10
Conference Tournament, Stanford
. . . proved it was the No. 2 team
in the conference by turning the
ball and the Pac-10 Championship
over to the top-seeded and nation
ally top-ranked Wildcats, 73-51
before 10,403 at the Great West
ern Forum.
Harried by Arizona's pressure
defense, Stanford made 23 turn
overs — almost as many as the
28 shots the Cardinal took.
Though Stanford did make 67.8
percent of those field-goal at
tempts, the Cardinal missed half
of its 26 free-throw tries and only
managed two offensive rebounds
in 40 minutes, making it impos
sible to stay in the game.
"We just didn't handle the pres
sure well," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "We got beat
very soundly; I don't think there's
any question about that."
Two-time Pac-10 Player of the
Year and Pac-10 Tournament
Most Valuable Player Sean Elliott
led Arizona with 21 points, while
Jud Buechler provided solid sup
port with 16. They were joined
on the all-tourney team by team
mate Anthony Cook, Stanford
guard Todd Lichti and Oregon
State guard Gary Payton. Only
Buechler did not receive similar
honors last year.
The 12th-ranked Cardinal (26-
6) could console itself with the
news, which came during the sec
ond half of the Arizona game, that

it was seeded No. 3 in the East
Regional of the NCAA tourna
ment, officially ending the 47-year
dry spell that has been both the
albatross and the motivation for
generations of Stanford basketball
teams.
"I'm very proud of this team,"
Montgomery said.
Stanford will open play at
Greensboro, N.C. Thursday
against the Siena Saints at 11:37
a.m. PST. A full NCAA tourna
ment preview for both the men's
and women's teams will appear
in a special issue of The Daily
tomorrow.
By surviving a scare by last
place USC Friday, 66-61, and then
thrashing No. 3 seed UCLA 95-86
Saturday (Stanford's first win
against UCLA in Los Angeles
since 1952), Stanford cemented
that No. 3 seed. Montgomery
could not remember the last time
Stanford had put together a better
overall performance than it did
against the Bruins.
But everyone remembered the
last time the Cardinal played as
poorly as it did Sunday. That was
11 games before, the last time
Stanford lost. And it was at Ari
zona.
