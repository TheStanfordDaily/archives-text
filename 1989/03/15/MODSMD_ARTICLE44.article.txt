# Stanford primed for NCAA tourney play

### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
INGLEWOOD, Calif. — Stanford's performance
at the Pacific 10 Conference Tournament provided
the Cardinal with some answers but also posed
some questions that follow Stanford into the NCAA
Tournament.
The foremost among the answers was "Yes, Stan
ford can shoot the ball from the perimeter." The
Cardinal's outside shooting — invisible in recent
weeks — didn't exactly return with a vengeance
but fortunately turned in its best appearance in
some time last weekend.
The watershed for the Cardinal came in the
closing minutes of Friday's USC contest. With Stan
ford trailing by three, and on the verge of being
upset, Terry Taylor had the ball 21 feet from the
hoop.
Taylor loves to shoot the 3-pointer and has done
so effectively for a long time. For several. weeks
though, Taylor hasn't made very many.
But there he was, with the game on the line,
standing in 3-point land. His recent lack of success
obviously not concerning him, Taylor let the ball
go on a perfect arc, with perfect rotation. It swished
through the net and the game was saved.
And Terry Taylor was back.
The other positive sign was that Adam Keefe
made it clear that his freshman status in no way
makes him unprepared for prime-time play. Keefe
had superb performances against USC and UCLA.
He should be a force on the boards and in the post
come NCAAs.
Keefe has played well all year, to be sure, but if
he's ready to keep playing at this elevated level the
opposition is in real trouble. Stanford's starting
frontline is tough. With Keefe coming off the bench
and dominating, it's that much tougher.
The one nagging question is the Cardinal's ability
to handle quality pressure defense. An on-again,
off-again press executed with moderately quick bas
ketball players is not a problem for Stanford.
A non-stop press clamped on by a super-quick
team like Arizona is a nightmare. In the final Sun
day, even when Stanford could and did beat the
press the Cardinal's lack of concentration was costly.
A number of times, there was a Stanford player
opened deep for a long pass. Often no one found
them. And, sometimes when they did, they lobbed
the ball softly and allowed the Wildcats to tip it away.
