# The 						educated person's guide to tourney wagering
## 
### 
It's tourney time once again and that
means March Madness is at a fever
pitch. Arguably the most popular
sporting phenomenon in the nation, the
NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament in
spires another of America's favorite pas
times like nothing else.
That pastime is, of course, betting.
From pools that are based on filling
out the entire bracket, to bets between
students and alumni from opposing col
leges, all the way to the mecca of Stanford
betting — the Toyon Calcutta, NCAA
hoops brings even the most avowed non
gamblers into the fray.
For those of you who might want some
slight edge (or want to know who not to
bet on if you think little of my prognos
ticating ability), here is a Bettor's Guide
to the NCAA Tournament.
The No. Is
Heading into the big show, No. 1-
ranked Arizona is on a roll. Playing their
best basketball of the season, the Wild
cats are a favorite to win the whole thing.
Their draw in Boise is downright com
ical and while UNLV may be able to run
with the 'Cats in Denver, Lute Olson's

charges seemed poised and ready for a
second-straight Final Four appearance.
Arizona's strengths are superb pres
sure defense and quickness, excellent shot
blocking with Anthony Cook, and ar
guably the nation's best player in Sean
Elliott (remember what last year's top
player, Danny Manning, did for Kansas).
They haven't played a bad game all
season and maybe not in two seasons.
The Georgetown Hoyas are rolling as
well. They too have pressure, quickness,
great shot blocking from superfrosh
Alonzo Mourning, and a bona fide star
in Charles Smith. A Georgetown-Arizona
matchup in Seattle is quite likely.
Illinois may have more talent than

anyone else in the land. They are 19-0
with Kendall Gill in the lineup. The Illini
can jump out of the building and have
two of the nation's best forwards in
Kenny Battle and Nick Anderson. Their
only weakness is coaching (see below).
Oklahoma has two superstars in Stacey
King and Mookie Blaylock but comes into
the tournament looking awfully tired.
They may have run themselves out of
gas this season. Upset special: La Salle
knocks off the Sooners in the second
round.
Great players, OK teams
La Salle is led by Lionel Simmons, one
of top scorers and rebounders in the na
tion. His squad definitely could surprise.
Interestingly enough, Simmons and the
Explorers face Randy White and Loui
siana Tech in the first round. White is
another super player who is virtually un
known outside of the bayou. He's been
compared to NBA All-Star Karl Malone,
a Tech alum.
The Evansville Purple Aces are led by
Scott Haffner, a transfer from Illinois.
Haffner is an extraordinary scorer who
had a 65-point game this year.

Of course, anyone talking about great
scorers would be remiss if they failed to
mention Chris Jackson of LSU. The 6-
foot freshman guard has had several 50-
point games already and is one of the
most special players to come along in a
while.
Top tourney coachcs
Another LSU strength is coach Dale
Brown. His teams don't always sport
great records, but they're always ready
for the NCAAs. Brown's specialty is de
signing defenses so subtle, opposing
coaches can't even figure out what the
Tigers are doing, let alone how to counter
it.
His other forte is instilling in his
players a belief they're going to win. In
a close game with time running out, LSU
will be very, very tough to beat.
Another coach who's always ready for
the tourney is Duke's Mike Krzyzewski.
Coach K never seems to have enough
talent or athleticism to get the Blue Devils
to the Final Four — but he does it any
way. Not that player-of-the-year candi
date Danny Ferry doesn't make
Krzyzewski look smart, but Coach K

knows how to get the opposition to do
things it doesn't want to.
Indiana's Bobby Knight is also a must
include on any list of NCAA wizards.
Yes, his teams exit early sometimes (1988
and 1986), but they also win national
titles more often than almost anyone else.
Lousy tourney coaches
On the flip side are coaches who bring
gifted clubs to the tourney only to go
home early every time.
Heading the list is Illinois' Lou Henson.
Always with a gifted team, Henson is not
usually around for the Regionals. Rumor
has it that during timeouts he has noth
ing to say to his players. At all. Zip. Zero.
Mum's the word.
This year he may have too much talent
to blow it, but you never know.
Big Ten counterpart Bill Frieder is an
other miserable guy to bring to the big
show. His all-star game offense is appar
ently so predictable that most defenses
have no trouble controlling the Wol
verines in March.


MARK ROGOWSKY
Again, though, there may be too
much talent this time. Glen Rice,
Terry Mills and Loy Vaught com
bine to form a better frontline
than the Miami Heat's. Rurneal
Robinson runs the show beauti
fully as well. Frieder may still
find a way for them to lose.
Another candidate for the
Doing-the-Least-with-the-Most
Award is the legendary Dean
Smith. How can the coach of a
perennial Elite Eight team be in
cluded here? Simple, with all the
talent he's had in the 80s he prob
ably should have a couple more
Final Four appearances to show
for it.
I mean really, you or I could've
coached James Worthy, Michael
Jordan and Sam Perkins to a na
tional championship.
Sleepers
Every year there's a team in
the Final Four, and two of three

in the Sweet 16, who no one
thought would be there. Who will
they be this time? If I knew that,
I'd be a wealthy man. What the
hell, here goes nothing .. .
Sweet 16 surprises: The afore
mentioned La Salle Explorers, the
quick and pesky Providence
Friars, the Loyola Marymount
Lions — the highest scoring team
in the U.S. of A., and Chris Jack
son, Dale Brown and the LSU
Tigers.
Cinderella in Seattle: I've said
it before and I'll say it agaiiw
don't count out those kids
Stanford.
The Cardinal has rediscovered
its perimeter shooting, sports a
huge frontline, has the poise of
six seniors (one of whom could
use a big tournament to improve
his NBA chances, one of whom
has proved that he can do it
against anyone) and seems to
have no chance.
That's why I love 'em.

On the flip side are coaches who bring
gifted clubs to the tourney only to go
home early every time.
Heading the list is Illinois' Lou Henson.
Always with a gifted team, Henson is not
usually around for the Regionals. Rumor
has it that during timeouts he has noth
ing to say to his players. At all. Zip. Zero.
Mum's the word.
This year he may have too much talent
to blow it, but you never know.
Big Ten counterpart Bill Frieder is an
other miserable guy to bring to the big
show. His all-star game offense is appar
ently so predictable that most defenses
have no trouble controlling the Wol
verines in March.


MARK ROGOWSKY
Again, though, there may be too
much talent this time. Glen Rice,
Terry Mills and Loy Vaught com
bine to form a better frontline
than the Miami Heat's. Rurneal
Robinson runs the show beauti
fully as well. Frieder may still
find a way for them to lose.
Another candidate for the
Doing-the-Least-with-the-Most
Award is the legendary Dean
Smith. How can the coach of a
perennial Elite Eight team be in
cluded here? Simple, with all the
talent he's had in the 80s he prob
ably should have a couple more
Final Four appearances to show
for it.
I mean really, you or I could've
coached James Worthy, Michael
Jordan and Sam Perkins to a na
tional championship.
Sleepers
Every year there's a team in
the Final Four, and two of three

in the Sweet 16, who no one
thought would be there. Who will
they be this time? If I knew that,
I'd be a wealthy man. What the
hell, here goes nothing .. .
Sweet 16 surprises: The afore
mentioned La Salle Explorers, the
quick and pesky Providence
Friars, the Loyola Marymount
Lions — the highest scoring team
in the U.S. of A., and Chris Jack
son, Dale Brown and the LSU
Tigers.
Cinderella in Seattle: I've said
it before and I'll say it agaiiw
don't count out those kids
Stanford.
The Cardinal has rediscovered
its perimeter shooting, sports a
huge frontline, has the poise of
six seniors (one of whom could
use a big tournament to improve
his NBA chances, one of whom
has proved that he can do it
against anyone) and seems to
have no chance.
That's why I love 'em.

It's tourney time once again and that
means March Madness is at a fever
pitch. Arguably the most popular
sporting phenomenon in the nation, the
NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament in
spires another of America's favorite pas
times like nothing else.
That pastime is, of course, betting.
From pools that are based on filling
out the entire bracket, to bets between
students and alumni from opposing col
leges, all the way to the mecca of Stanford
betting — the Toyon Calcutta, NCAA
hoops brings even the most avowed non
gamblers into the fray.
For those of you who might want some
slight edge (or want to know who not to
bet on if you think little of my prognos
ticating ability), here is a Bettor's Guide
to the NCAA Tournament.
The No. Is
Heading into the big show, No. 1-
ranked Arizona is on a roll. Playing their
best basketball of the season, the Wild
cats are a favorite to win the whole thing.
Their draw in Boise is downright com
ical and while UNLV may be able to run
with the 'Cats in Denver, Lute Olson's

charges seemed poised and ready for a
second-straight Final Four appearance.
Arizona's strengths are superb pres
sure defense and quickness, excellent shot
blocking with Anthony Cook, and ar
guably the nation's best player in Sean
Elliott (remember what last year's top
player, Danny Manning, did for Kansas).
They haven't played a bad game all
season and maybe not in two seasons.
The Georgetown Hoyas are rolling as
well. They too have pressure, quickness,
great shot blocking from superfrosh
Alonzo Mourning, and a bona fide star
in Charles Smith. A Georgetown-Arizona
matchup in Seattle is quite likely.
Illinois may have more talent than

anyone else in the land. They are 19-0
with Kendall Gill in the lineup. The Illini
can jump out of the building and have
two of the nation's best forwards in
Kenny Battle and Nick Anderson. Their
only weakness is coaching (see below).
Oklahoma has two superstars in Stacey
King and Mookie Blaylock but comes into
the tournament looking awfully tired.
They may have run themselves out of
gas this season. Upset special: La Salle
knocks off the Sooners in the second
round.
Great players, OK teams
La Salle is led by Lionel Simmons, one
of top scorers and rebounders in the na
tion. His squad definitely could surprise.
Interestingly enough, Simmons and the
Explorers face Randy White and Loui
siana Tech in the first round. White is
another super player who is virtually un
known outside of the bayou. He's been
compared to NBA All-Star Karl Malone,
a Tech alum.
The Evansville Purple Aces are led by
Scott Haffner, a transfer from Illinois.
Haffner is an extraordinary scorer who
had a 65-point game this year.

Of course, anyone talking about great
scorers would be remiss if they failed to
mention Chris Jackson of LSU. The 6-
foot freshman guard has had several 50-
point games already and is one of the
most special players to come along in a
while.
Top tourney coachcs
Another LSU strength is coach Dale
Brown. His teams don't always sport
great records, but they're always ready
for the NCAAs. Brown's specialty is de
signing defenses so subtle, opposing
coaches can't even figure out what the
Tigers are doing, let alone how to counter
it.
His other forte is instilling in his
players a belief they're going to win. In
a close game with time running out, LSU
will be very, very tough to beat.
Another coach who's always ready for
the tourney is Duke's Mike Krzyzewski.
Coach K never seems to have enough
talent or athleticism to get the Blue Devils
to the Final Four — but he does it any
way. Not that player-of-the-year candi
date Danny Ferry doesn't make
Krzyzewski look smart, but Coach K

knows how to get the opposition to do
things it doesn't want to.
Indiana's Bobby Knight is also a must
include on any list of NCAA wizards.
Yes, his teams exit early sometimes (1988
and 1986), but they also win national
titles more often than almost anyone else.
