# Swimmers win Pac-10
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Now that the intermediary step
is over with, the Stanford men's
swim team can concentrate on the
national finals. And if the Cardi
nal's performance at its interim
meet, the Pacific-10 Champion
ships, is any indication, the squad
is definitely ready to dethrone
reigning champion Texas.
Although Stanford Coach Skip
Kenney likes to refer to the con
ference meet as just an interim
contest meant for qualifying for
the NCAA finals, the Cardinal did
not swim as if it were only an
intermediate step.
In winning its eighth straight
Pac-10 title Stanford rolled up the
highest point total and highest
victory margin ever in the tour
nament while setting a handful of
new pool, meet and national
records. The Cardinal's 935.5
points at the three-day meet last
weekend in Long Beach was fol
lowed by a distant UCLA with
660.5. California finished third at
621.4. They were followed by
USC, Arizona, Arizona State and
Wahington.
"It was pretty surprising," free
styler Doug Lillydahl said. "I
thought we were going to win and
1 thought we would have a com
fortable lead, but I didn't expect
what happened."
What happened was Stanford
won seven events, sweeping two,

and had at least one swimmer
place in every race. In fact, on
Saturday, the final day of compe
tition, 15 of the 30 swimmers in
final heats were Stanford swim
mers. And, fulfilling the team's
original goal, 16 competitors qual
ified for the NCAAs.
"The team was just ready to
swim fast," breaststroke specialist
Sam Schwartz said. "It was a
great team effort. It was easy to
do well when everyone around you
was swimming fast."
Leading the Card's long list of
point winners were co-captains
Jay Mortenson and John Witchel.
After placing second in the 500
yard free Thursday, Witchel
rebounded and led a sweep of the
200 free Friday as well as anchor
ing the 800 free relay to victory.
Mortenson started out by dou
bling Friday, winning both the 100
back and 100 fly, setting a new
meet record of 47.14 in the fly
race. He then swam legs on the
victorious 200 and 400 medley
relay teams before taking second
in the 200 fly, his weak event.
Other outstanding perform
ances were recorded by sophomore
Matt Rodgers, who won the 200
breaststroke in a personal best of
1:58.88, took second in the 100
breaststroke and third in the 200
individual medley. Junior Sam
Schwartz recorded his best Pac-10
meet of his career, taking second
