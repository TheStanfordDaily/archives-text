## Ski teams race in Sierras 
### Libby Feil Staff writer 
Stanford's men's and wom
en's ski teams competed in the
collegiate nationals last week
end at Incline Village near Lake
Tahoe, bringing in severed ex
cellent runs.
In the men's giant slalom
Stanford's top three finishers
were Bill Derwin in 23rd place,
Brandon Lattin in 29th and
Brad Swett in 48th. Peter Blitz
and Scott Hall also finished.
Derwin did well in the slalom
race too, turning in a clean
finish and placing 11th. Swett
was Stanford's only other fin
isher in this event.
Derwin was also selected to
be one of five alpine skiers
honored as Academic Ail-
Americans at the meet. To
qualify, he finished in the top
15 overall (giant slalom and
slalom combined) and had a
grade point average better than
3.0.
The Cardinal women skied
to some good placings as well.
Sarah Pike posted a 32nd place
in the giant slalom with Mala
Htun finishing in 49th place.
In the slalom Pam Smul
snatched 33rd place and Htun

37th; Cathy Petzold and Jen
nifer Richmond finished as
well.
Ice hockey wins
three from USC
Stanford's ice hockey team
played its last three games of
the season last weekend
against USC, beating the
Trojans 12-2, 8-5 and 5-0.
According to team treasurer
David Shapiro, Tim Westergren
and David Wright "played
really well," as did goaltenders
Tony Salvadore and Chick
Webb. Their contributions
helped increase the Cardinal's
winning streak: "We've won
our last seven games," Shapiro
said.
On April 7 and 9, the hockey
team will compete in its
playoffs in Los Angeles against
the five other teams in its
league, the Pacific Collegiate
Hockey Association. Currently
Stanford is third in the PCHA.
For the playoffs the six teams
in the league will be divided
into two groups of three, with
each team in one division playing
each team in the other division.
The two teams that have the most
points at the end of the tourna
ment will play a championship
game to determine the playoff
winner.
Ruggers lose to
energized Chico State
The Cardinal men's rugby team
played its next-to-last regular
game last weekend against Chico
State and failed to return home
with a much-needed victory. How
ever, the team's win against San
Jose State two weekends ago may
have been enough to keep it in
the running for the playoffs.
After the long road trip, "every
one (on the team) was still asleep"
when the Cardinal arrived in
Chico, player Joe Croft said.
Captain Bill Bradford agreed
and added that "they [Chico
State] were a really good team. . . .
Our guys played hard, but you
can't always play well." The final
score was 28-0.
Cyclists excel at
Sonoma State trials
The Stanford cycling team
traveled to Sonoma State last

weekend for a time trial and cri
terium. Although results from the
time trial are not yet available,
the team did compete well in the
criterium.
California was the only other
team beside Stanford pres
ent at Sonoma State, and the
weekend of racing turned out to
be a close duel between the
schools.
"Berkeley was amazing.
They're every bit aa good as we
are for the first time in recent
memory," commented co-captain
Vit Henisz.
The Cardinal sent its whole
squad of riders to the race. Every
criterium saw Stanford cyclists
place, but the women's and men's.
A criteriums turned out the best
for the Cardinal.
The women's A race seemed to
be a playground for Stanford.
Emerging freshman star Taaha
Brubaker won handily after also
scoring in a few primes. Stan
ford's Shannon Phillips placed
well as usual, ending up in fourth
overall and winning some prime
points. Liz Moyer also placed.
The men's A criterium became
a showcase for Stanford's talent.
Coulter Richardson, Art Walker
and Tom Moyer were the Cardi
nal's top three finishers, sprinting
for third, fifth and eighth places
respectively.
Stanford cyclists placed well in
the men's C and D races too.
