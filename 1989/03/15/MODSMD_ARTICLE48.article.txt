# Women netters dominate in weekend matches

### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
What a difference one day can
make.
Friday: Clouds loomed over
head, delaying the Stanford wom
en's tennis team's match with
17th-ranked Arizona by an hour.
The No. 1 Cardinal clinched the
contest in doubles but dropped
two out of three doubles matches
to finish with a 6-3 win. Bitter
ness had been engendered.
Saturday: The weather, tennis
and dispositions improved dram
atically. Under the sunny skies
and in the balmy climes, the Car
dinal rolled past Arizona State 9-
0. Business as usual for the Stan
ford steamroller.

Cardinal 6, Wildcats 3
Cardinal 9, Sun Devils 0

The series sets the Cardinal's
record at 14-0 overall, 4-0 in the
Pacific 10 Conference. The Wild
cats fell to 4-6, while the Sun
Devils dropped to 8-7.
At the outset, Stanford had
little trouble handling its Arizona
foe on Friday. Teri Whitlinger put
the first mark on the board with
her 6-0, 6-2 win over Danielle
Klurman at No. 4 singles, followed
soon after by her teammates play

ing two through five.
Lisa Green dispensed with
Betsy Sommerville at No. 2
singles 6-1, 6-3; Debbie Graham
bested Danielle Scott 6-3, 6-1 in
the No. 3 position; and Kylie
Johnson slid past Harriet Knols,
an opponent who gave Whitlinger
a tough fight in Tuscon, 6-0, 7-5
in one of the day's surprises.
"Johnson 1 thought did very
well," Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan said. "Though she's just
a freshman, she's been coming
through for us match after match
after match. Kylie has been a big
factor in our success this year."
The sole singles loss of the
weekend was inflicted by Wildcat
Nancy Breen, who toppled Cindy
Buchsbaum 6-4, 6-0.
That left the No. 1 singles
match, with Ail-American Tami
Whitlinger facing freshman Banni
Redhair (who, incidentally, is
blonde). Though Whitlinger
prevailed 6-1, 6-2, Redhair gave
her one of her toughest battles
this year in a match far closer
than the scores suggest.
"I thought she played excellent
yesterday," Whitlinger said Satur
day of her Friday opponent. "She
was hitting the ball hard, solid,
really well to the corner, and she
gave me a much better match than
I thought she was going to."
Paired with Sommerville, she
gave the Whitlingers an even

tougher match at No. 1 doubles.
Uninspired and flat at the outset,
the twins became frustrated and
bitter as they lost a three-set
match 6-3, 1-6, 6-4.
Green and Buchsbaum did
likewise, falling 6-3, 6-2 to Scott-
Knols.
"At the beginning of the match,
we were told we weren't playing
doubles if before then we had won
the match," Whitlinger explained.
"We had won it in singles, so we
all along thought we weren't play
ing doubles.
"The next thing you know, 10
minutes before we were supposed
to play doubles, we hear, 'Oh, by
the way, we're playing doubles.'
So Teri and I really didn't go into
our match with a good frame of
mind. Because of that, we really
didn't play well.
"We weren't even 50 percent of
the team we usually are," she
added. "Last time we played that
team we beat them like 6-0, 6-2
or something — we killed them.
There's no way we should have
lost that match. We were fighting
our emotions too much."
The sole saving grace of doubles
was the second surprise of the
day, Carina Rolley. With Sandra
Birch absent from the match to
have a tooth pulled and Johnson
suffering from a minor injury,
Graham was left without a part
ner.

Rolley, who passed time during
the singles matches volleying with
the injured Eleni Rossides, was
tapped on the shoulder to play
No. 3 doubles. She responded with
an inspired 6-0, 6-1 trouncing of
Klurman-Breen, and followed
with a 6-4, 6-2 win over ASU's
Jill Hamilton-Luann Klimchock
the next day.
Saturday in general was a better
day for the Cardinal. Eager to put
the disappointment of Friday be
hind them, the Cardinal players
exuded confidence and enthusi
asm as they took the court.
Tami Whitlinger had another
fine singles match, rebounding
from a 1-2 deficit in the first set
to win all of her remaining games
and the match over Kristi
Johnkosky 6-2, 6-0. Teri also
swept, beating Jennifer Rojohn 6-
4, 6-2 at No. 4 singles.
Graham triumphed 6-1, 6-3 in
an easy No. 3 match over Barb
Thompson; Johnson blew by
Karen Bergan 6-1, 6-3; and
Buchsbaum crushed Paola Conte
6-1, 6-2.
"It was nice to have our senior
captain turn it around today,"
Brennan said. "She was just out
of sorts yesterday — I think she
was just really run down. Today,
I just took a look at her before
she went out on the court and I
knew she was going to win."

gave me a much better match than
I thought she was going to."
Paired with Sommerville, she
gave the Whitlingers an even

tougher match at No. 1 doubles.
Uninspired and flat at the outset,
the twins became frustrated and
bitter as they lost a three-set
match 6-3, 1-6, 6-4.
Green and Buchsbaum did
likewise, falling 6-3, 6-2 to Scott-
Knols.
"At the beginning of the match,
we were told we weren't playing
doubles if before then we had won
the match," Whitlinger explained.
"We had won it in singles, so we
all along thought we weren't play
ing doubles.
"The next thing you know, 10
minutes before we were supposed
to play doubles, we hear, 'Oh, by
the way, we're playing doubles.'
So Teri and I really didn't go into
our match with a good frame of
mind. Because of that, we really
didn't play well.
"We weren't even 50 percent of
the team we usually are," she
added. "Last time we played that
team we beat them like 6-0, 6-2
or something — we killed them.
There's no way we should have
lost that match. We were fighting
our emotions too much."
The sole saving grace of doubles
was the second surprise of the
day, Carina Rolley. With Sandra
Birch absent from the match to
have a tooth pulled and Johnson
suffering from a minor injury,
Graham was left without a part
ner.

Rolley, who passed time during
the singles matches volleying with
the injured Eleni Rossides, was
tapped on the shoulder to play
No. 3 doubles. She responded with
an inspired 6-0, 6-1 trouncing of
Klurman-Breen, and followed
with a 6-4, 6-2 win over ASU's
Jill Hamilton-Luann Klimchock
the next day.
Saturday in general was a better
day for the Cardinal. Eager to put
the disappointment of Friday be
hind them, the Cardinal players
exuded confidence and enthusi
asm as they took the court.
Tami Whitlinger had another
fine singles match, rebounding
from a 1-2 deficit in the first set
to win all of her remaining games
and the match over Kristi
Johnkosky 6-2, 6-0. Teri also
swept, beating Jennifer Rojohn 6-
4, 6-2 at No. 4 singles.
Graham triumphed 6-1, 6-3 in
an easy No. 3 match over Barb
Thompson; Johnson blew by
Karen Bergan 6-1, 6-3; and
Buchsbaum crushed Paola Conte
6-1, 6-2.
"It was nice to have our senior
captain turn it around today,"
Brennan said. "She was just out
of sorts yesterday — I think she
was just really run down. Today,
I just took a look at her before
she went out on the court and I
knew she was going to win."


Michael Topolovac — Dally
Tami Whitlinger volleys during a match this weekend. The Cardinal
aced Arizona and Arizona State Friday and Saturday.
What a difference one day can
make.
Friday: Clouds loomed over
head, delaying the Stanford wom
en's tennis team's match with
17th-ranked Arizona by an hour.
The No. 1 Cardinal clinched the
contest in doubles but dropped
two out of three doubles matches
to finish with a 6-3 win. Bitter
ness had been engendered.
Saturday: The weather, tennis
and dispositions improved dram
atically. Under the sunny skies
and in the balmy climes, the Car
dinal rolled past Arizona State 9-
0. Business as usual for the Stan
ford steamroller.

Cardinal 6, Wildcats 3
Cardinal 9, Sun Devils 0

The series sets the Cardinal's
record at 14-0 overall, 4-0 in the
Pacific 10 Conference. The Wild
cats fell to 4-6, while the Sun
Devils dropped to 8-7.
At the outset, Stanford had
little trouble handling its Arizona
foe on Friday. Teri Whitlinger put
the first mark on the board with
her 6-0, 6-2 win over Danielle
Klurman at No. 4 singles, followed
soon after by her teammates play

ing two through five.
Lisa Green dispensed with
Betsy Sommerville at No. 2
singles 6-1, 6-3; Debbie Graham
bested Danielle Scott 6-3, 6-1 in
the No. 3 position; and Kylie
Johnson slid past Harriet Knols,
an opponent who gave Whitlinger
a tough fight in Tuscon, 6-0, 7-5
in one of the day's surprises.
"Johnson 1 thought did very
well," Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan said. "Though she's just
a freshman, she's been coming
through for us match after match
after match. Kylie has been a big
factor in our success this year."
The sole singles loss of the
weekend was inflicted by Wildcat
Nancy Breen, who toppled Cindy
Buchsbaum 6-4, 6-0.
That left the No. 1 singles
match, with Ail-American Tami
Whitlinger facing freshman Banni
Redhair (who, incidentally, is
blonde). Though Whitlinger
prevailed 6-1, 6-2, Redhair gave
her one of her toughest battles
this year in a match far closer
than the scores suggest.
"I thought she played excellent
yesterday," Whitlinger said Satur
day of her Friday opponent. "She
was hitting the ball hard, solid,
really well to the corner, and she
gave me a much better match than
I thought she was going to."
Paired with Sommerville, she
gave the Whitlingers an even
