# Cagers perfect in Pac-10
## Women finish season with 18-0 conference record 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Last season at Maples Pavilion,
UCLA rained heavily on the Stan
ford women's basketball team's
postseason parade. With the buz-

Women's Basketball
Cardinal 104, UCLA 66

zer in the process of sounding, a
previously scoreless Jamie Brown
sunk a baseline jumper from 15
feet to upset the Cardinal 75-74
and deny Stanford a home game
to open the NCAA Tournament.
Friday, however, the Bruins

couldn't have dampened an ocean.
Facing a Stanford team bent on
avenging the loss and sweeping
the Pacific 10 Conference to boot,
UCLA was decimated 104-66
before a noisy, excited crowd of
2,684 at Maples.
The victory indeed set Stan
ford's league mark at 18-0, the
first time a team has swept the
Pac-10. Overall, the Cardinal is
26-2, ranked fourth by Associated
Press and is the second seed in
the Midwest Region of the NCAA
Tournament, slated to host a
second-round game Saturday
night at 7:30 p.m. at Maples Pa
vilion (full details will be given in
tomorrow's tournament suppli
ment).

Making the contest even more
significant, the game marked the
final regular season appearance
of seniors Jill Yanke, Evon As
foris, Emily Wagner and team
manager Loretta Lamar. None of
the four could have asked for a
sweeter send-off.
"It is so totally cool to be so
totally undefeated," an exuberant
Lamar exclaimed.
"I think it's really special,"
Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer
agreed. "To win your conference
is great; to go 18-0, that's a really
tremendous accomplishment."
The Cardinal effort was led by
guard Jennifer Azzi, who was sub
sequently named Pac-10 Player of
the Year (see related story).
Notching a game-high-tying 19
points (along with forward Trisha
Stevens), five assists and two
steals, Azzi added an impressive
34 minutes to her career-best 25-
point, 12-assist performance
against USC the previous evening
in a game televised live on ESPN.
After besting the Women of
Troy 100-85, Stanford could have
let down and played uninspired
basketball in its final regular
season outing. That was not the
case: Remembering the tight 73-
71 win in Los Angeles as well as
last season's upset, the Cardinal
overwhelmed the Bruins with
relentless defense and a brisk run
ning game.
"I thought we played really well
tonight, a lot better than we did
at UCLA," Azzi said. "I think
things were really clicking for us
offensively and I think we D'ed
it up (defended) a lot better than
we did last night (against USC)."
"I thought we ran very well,"
VanDerveer said. "Again (like the
USC game), conditioning was a
factor. I was worried, because we
played last night and they didn't,
but we ran them off the floor."
The home team also dominated
the boards, pulling down a season
high 57 rebounds to the Bruins'
38. Capitalizing on the advantage,
Stanford shot 50 percent from the
floor.
The real difference, however,
was Asforis. Making her last game
her best, the senior tri-captain
capped her career with an explo
sive 15 points, 13 rebounds and
four steals.
"I think Evon was really fired
up for the game, playing against
her friend Althea Ford — they
played together in high school —
which was an extra bit of moti
vation for her personally," Azzi
said. "I think Evon got the last
laugh."
"UCLA has always been a thorn
in my side," Asforis said. "I just
wanted to beat them so bad, and
I was pumped to play against my
high school teammate. I just

wanted to beat them bad, and I
was going to do whatever it would
take to do that."
Beaten badly the Bruins were.
For the third straight game and
the fourth out of five, Stanford
broke into triple digits, and UCLA
became the Cardinal's 10th op
ponent to lose by 30 points or
more.
In this game, freshman Martha
Richards earned the distinction of
surpassing 100. With the score
stuck at 99, Richards sank a 5-foot
running layup to break the cen

tury mark.
"I knew Martha had one more
play in her, one more runner,"
VanDerveer said with a smile.
"She's a crowd pleaser."
Card notes
Even without the Band's musical
spurring, pandemonium reigned after
th'e final buzzer. Students swarmed
the floor and celebrated even before
the net-snipping ceremony.
A ladder was erected underneath
the south basket by the Stanford

bench, upon which each team member
climbed wielding scissors to cut the
net down strand by strand. Lamar
severed the final thread, sending the
net falling into Yanke's arms.
The celebration continued into the
locker room, where VanDerveer was
doused with a cooler by an overzealous
Asforis. Lamar claimed total respon
sibility for the water loss.
Along with signifying the confer
ence sweep, the UCLA game marked
the first time that Stanford has swept
both of the L.A. schools.

high 57 rebounds to the Bruins'
38. Capitalizing on the advantage,
Stanford shot 50 percent from the
floor.
The real difference, however,
was Asforis. Making her last game
her best, the senior tri-captain
capped her career with an explo
sive 15 points, 13 rebounds and
four steals.
"I think Evon was really fired
up for the game, playing against
her friend Althea Ford — they
played together in high school —
which was an extra bit of moti
vation for her personally," Azzi
said. "I think Evon got the last
laugh."
"UCLA has always been a thorn
in my side," Asforis said. "I just
wanted to beat them so bad, and
I was pumped to play against my
high school teammate. I just

wanted to beat them bad, and I
was going to do whatever it would
take to do that."
Beaten badly the Bruins were.
For the third straight game and
the fourth out of five, Stanford
broke into triple digits, and UCLA
became the Cardinal's 10th op
ponent to lose by 30 points or
more.
In this game, freshman Martha
Richards earned the distinction of
surpassing 100. With the score
stuck at 99, Richards sank a 5-foot
running layup to break the cen

tury mark.
"I knew Martha had one more
play in her, one more runner,"
VanDerveer said with a smile.
"She's a crowd pleaser."
Card notes
Even without the Band's musical
spurring, pandemonium reigned after
th'e final buzzer. Students swarmed
the floor and celebrated even before
the net-snipping ceremony.
A ladder was erected underneath
the south basket by the Stanford

bench, upon which each team member
climbed wielding scissors to cut the
net down strand by strand. Lamar
severed the final thread, sending the
net falling into Yanke's arms.
The celebration continued into the
locker room, where VanDerveer was
doused with a cooler by an overzealous
Asforis. Lamar claimed total respon
sibility for the water loss.
Along with signifying the confer
ence sweep, the UCLA game marked
the first time that Stanford has swept
both of the L.A. schools.

Forward/center Evon Asforis scored 15 points, hauled in 13 rebounds and had four steals in her last
home game Friday night against UCLA.
Last season at Maples Pavilion,
UCLA rained heavily on the Stan
ford women's basketball team's
postseason parade. With the buz-

Cardinal 104, UCLA 66

zer in the process of sounding, a
previously scoreless Jamie Brown
sunk a baseline jumper from 15
feet to upset the Cardinal 75-74
and deny Stanford a home game
to open the NCAA Tournament.
Friday, however, the Bruins

couldn't have dampened an ocean.
Facing a Stanford team bent on
avenging the loss and sweeping
the Pacific 10 Conference to boot,
UCLA was decimated 104-66
before a noisy, excited crowd of
2,684 at Maples.
The victory indeed set Stan
ford's league mark at 18-0, the
first time a team has swept the
Pac-10. Overall, the Cardinal is
26-2, ranked fourth by Associated
Press and is the second seed in
the Midwest Region of the NCAA
Tournament, slated to host a
second-round game Saturday
night at 7:30 p.m. at Maples Pa
vilion (full details will be given in
tomorrow's tournament suppli
ment).

Making the contest even more
significant, the game marked the
final regular season appearance
of seniors Jill Yanke, Evon As
foris, Emily Wagner and team
manager Loretta Lamar. None of
the four could have asked for a
sweeter send-off.
"It is so totally cool to be so
totally undefeated," an exuberant
Lamar exclaimed.
"I think it's really special,"
Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer
agreed. "To win your conference
is great; to go 18-0, that's a really
tremendous accomplishment."
The Cardinal effort was led by
guard Jennifer Azzi, who was sub
sequently named Pac-10 Player of
the Year (see related story).
Notching a game-high-tying 19
points (along with forward Trisha
Stevens), five assists and two
steals, Azzi added an impressive
34 minutes to her career-best 25-
point, 12-assist performance
against USC the previous evening
in a game televised live on ESPN.
After besting the Women of
Troy 100-85, Stanford could have
let down and played uninspired
basketball in its final regular
season outing. That was not the
case: Remembering the tight 73-
71 win in Los Angeles as well as
last season's upset, the Cardinal
overwhelmed the Bruins with
relentless defense and a brisk run
ning game.
"I thought we played really well
tonight, a lot better than we did
at UCLA," Azzi said. "I think
things were really clicking for us
offensively and I think we D'ed
it up (defended) a lot better than
we did last night (against USC)."
"I thought we ran very well,"
VanDerveer said. "Again (like the
USC game), conditioning was a
factor. I was worried, because we
played last night and they didn't,
but we ran them off the floor."
The home team also dominated
the boards, pulling down a season
high 57 rebounds to the Bruins'
38. Capitalizing on the advantage,
Stanford shot 50 percent from the
floor.
