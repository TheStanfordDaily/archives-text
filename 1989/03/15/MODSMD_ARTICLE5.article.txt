# University Food Service to experiment with Eating Club model
## 
### Raoul Mowatt Staff writer 
In the near future, the Stanford Eating
Clubs may provide University officials
with some new food for thought.
The student-run clubs, located next to
Toyon Hall, offer a 24-hour open kitchen
and do not have to pay for as many
overhead costs as the deficit-riddled Food
Service. The eating clubs serve about 500
students while Food Service feeds about
3,400.

As a result of the lower numbers, the
clubs "don't eat up a lot of student money
in administrative costs. It all gets put
back into the food," said junior Richard
Marshall, general manager of the eating
clubs.
The University is exploring the possi
bility of decentralizing control of Food
Service in the larger dorms and adopting
some of the eating clubs' services, direc
tor of Housing and Food Services Keith
Guy said.
For instance, with the renovation and

reopening of Roble Hall, Food Service
plans to provide an experimental late
night snack bar. If successful, this pro
gram could move into other large resi
dences like Wilbur and Stern Halls.
Despite the eating club's apparent
popularity and success, they eventually
may need to look for a new home. In the
far future, the clubs will move out of
their present location to make space for
a parking lot for a new dorm, said Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Norm Robinson.
Because of a lack of University funding,

this housing project has been put on hold.
Consequently, a new site for the clubs is
still undetermined and a moving date

has not been set.
Historically, the University and the
clubs have maintained a laissez-faire re
lationship, Marshall said.
In many ways, the student-run clubs
demonstrate the virtues of local manage
ment, Marshall added, saying that the
extra effort that the managers put into
their work pleases the club members.
Food Service is also looking into mod
eling the cafeterias in new housing after
the dining societies in Governor s Corner.
