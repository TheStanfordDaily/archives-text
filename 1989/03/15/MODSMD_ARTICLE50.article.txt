# Guard Azzi receives honors
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Throughout the season, the
players on the Stanford wom
en's basketball team have dis
covered that individual acclaim
can be subordinated by a
balanced, winning program.
The group was proficient
enough to sweep the Pacific 10
Conference for the first time
in league history, but surpris
ingly only one member —
guard Sonja Henning — was
named Pac-10 Player of the
Week.
On Monday, however, the
conference more than compen
sated for the oversight with its
postseason awards. Highlight
ing a brilliant season that cul
minated in a career-best per
formance in last week's
televised game against USC,
junior guard Jennifer Azzi was

named Pac-10 Player of the
Year. She was also an All-Pac
-10 selection last season.
Classmate Katy Steding, a
forward, became Stanford's
second repeat performer, while
Henning was named to the
team for the first time.
"I think it's just a reflection
of our team," a subdued and
surprised Azzi said Monday. "I
don't think I did anything more
than anyone else on our team.
I mean, there's no way that I
could look good if it wasn't for
the people around me.
"Sonja and Katy had a great
year. If it was up to me, there
is no way that I could pick
myself."
The league felt otherwise,
however. Beating out the high
scoring centers Stefanie
Kasperski of Oregon and
Cherie Nelson of USC (last
season's Player of the Year),
the all-around excellence of
Azzi earned her the honor.
In the regular season, Azzi
averaged a team-high 16.1
points, 6.3 assists and 2.3 steals
per game, along with shooting
53 percent from the field, 45.8
from 3-point range and 78.8
from the line. In each of these
categories, the junior ranked
among the top 10 performers
in the league.
Coach Tara VanDerveer was
also honored, as she was unan
imously selected Pac-10 Coach
of the Year. In her four years
at Stanford, she has led the
Cardinal to an 80-26 record.
Center/forward Julie Zeilstra
was named to the All-
Freshman team for her contri
butions this season. One of the
first reserves off the bench, her
offensive versatility inside the
key and out have bolstered
Stanford's scoring effort.
