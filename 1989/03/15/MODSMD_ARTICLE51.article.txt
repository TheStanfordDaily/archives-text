Baseball
Card loses two of three to 'Cats
Those were the words of Stan
ford pitching coach Tom Dunton
after the Cardinal pulled out a
gutsy 5-4, 11-inning win over Ar
izona Sunday to salvage the last
game of a three-game weekend
series and make the trip back to
California a whole lot shorter.
The Wildcats obliterated Stan
ford in the first two games, 17-3

and 13-7, before the Cardinal
could win the final. Arizona
moves to 20-7 overall and 7-2 in
the Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division while Stanford is 12-
15 and 2-7.
Things looked bleak for the Car
dinal in the bottom of the eighth
Sunday when the Wildcats scored
two runs to erase a tenuous 3-2
Stanford lead. Starter Steve
Chitren, who had pitched a two
run, four-hit masterpiece to that
point, gave up a leadoff walk to
center fielder Kevin Long who
then advanced to second on a
single by catcher Alan Zinter.
It looked like Chitren would es
cape the inning when he induced
J.T. Snow to ground one to Troy
Paulsen at second, but shortstop

Roger Burnett threw the ball into
the Wildcat dugout to allow Long
to score the tying run. Greg
Fowble's RBI single put the 'Cats
up 4-3 going into the ninth.
Help was on the way quickly
for Stanford as the batsmen put
together some clutch hitting that
was previously unseen in the se
ries. Tim Griffin led off with a
single and scored on Steve
Solomon's double to the gap in
right center. Although the Cardi
nal could not manage to push the
winning run across with no outs
that inning, Stanford had the up
per hand.
The Cardinal threatened in the
top of the 10th, when it got its
second consecutive leadoff hit, a
double by David Holbrook. But

Paul Carey, perhaps the only Car
dinal batter who would be allowed
to swing away instead of bunt in
that situation, popped up to short
and Holbrook got no further than
third before the inning ended.
In the 11th, Troy Tallman led
off with a single (his first hit in
his last 15 at bats), reached third
on an error by shortstop Trevor
Hoffman and scored on David
Holbrook's sacrifice fly.
Stan Spencer, who had only
managed to hang in for one inning
during his start Friday, pitched
well on Sunday, holding Arizona
off for three innings until the Car
dinal could nail down the win.
Arizona scored a total of 30
runs in two games, seven more
than Arizona State did in a three
game sweep of the Cardinal at
Sunken Diamond last weekend.
But Chitren said he was not in
timidated by the Wildcats version
of Murderer's Row (Long, Zinter,
Todd Devereaux and Snow), who
batted in 23 of the 'Cats 30 runs
on Friday and Saturday.
"On the whole, they're just an
other Pac-10 team. Once I got
command of my slider, I thought
I could go pretty far," he said.
Dunton thought that the offen
sive explosion was due to Frank
Sancet Field. Although it is a
cavernous ballpark, with 400-foot
power alleys and 360 feet down
both lines, the wind generally
blows out and the hot, dry
weather is conducive to the long
ball. "This is the toughest park
to pitch in in the conference,"
Dunton said.
In Friday's game, little went
right for the Cardinal as Arizona
jumped out to a 12-3 lead by the
fourth inning, led by the afore
mentioned offensive cannons and
junior college transfer pitcher
Scott Erickson, who scattered 11
hits for three runs en route to
his conference-leading eighth win.
On Saturday, Stanford held a
lead for about five minutes before
the Wildcats jumped back out in
front again.
Arizona was leading 1-0 in the
top of the third when Stanford
staged a two-out rally. With Frank

Carey on base after a double,
Solomon dialed long distance and
launched a Jason Hisey pitch over
the scoreboard in right-center to
give the Cardinal a short-lived 2-1
lead.
After the Wildcats scored three
in the third and five in the fifth,
Stanford staged a mini-comeback
with four runs in the eighth to
make the score 10-7. But Arizona
closed the door by scoring three
runs in its half of the eighth.
After Saturday's game, Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess
summed up: "We haven't been
able to stop 'em with our pitch
ing."
But on Sunday, Marquess used
the only pitcher in his arsenal that
had not made an appearance dur
ing the weekend. And Chitren

came through with flying colors
to save the weekend.
Card notes
Injury Yeport: Frank Carey did not
play in Sunday's game due to the flu,
but will be available for the Cardinal's
next contest at UCLA on March 25.
pitcher Steve Worrell did not
make the trip, but was cleared to
pitch by the doctor. Mike Mussina's
situation is a little more tenuous, but
he should also be available for UCLA.
The Cardinal had more than 10 hits
in all three games for the first time
since the Loyola Marvmount series
While Frank Sancet Field is an ex
citing place to watch a ball game be
cause of the previously mentioned
launching pad propensities, their hot
dogs rank among the worst in the
Six-Pac. They do have red licorice
however, a sad omission from the
Sunken Diamond concession stands.
