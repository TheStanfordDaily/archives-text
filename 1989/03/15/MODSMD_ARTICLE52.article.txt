# Chitren salvages Card win
## 
### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
After making only one start
all of last season, Stanford's
ace reliever Steve Chitren got
the call Sunday and saved the
Cardinal from suffering a
team-record eighth-consecutive
Pacific 10 Southern Division
loss.
Chitren, who did not pitch
in losses Friday and Saturday,
went eight innings, allowing
just four runs on six hits to
an Arizona Wildcat team that
amassed 30 runs in the previ
ous two games. He struck out
nine while walking three and
hitting two batters.
"He did a good job in that
role (of starter). He threw 125
pitches. I expected him to go
five or six innings, but he
hadn't thrown many pitches,"
Cardinal pitching coach Tom
Dunton said. "He was pretty
well spent when I went out and
got him."
"My arm was getting pretty

tired (in the eighth). I felt a
little soreness in my shoulder.
I was dropping my elbow on
the pitch. It's a sure sign you're
getting tired. 1 told Coach
(Mark Marquess) I knew what
I was doing wrong, and he let
me finish the inning," Chitren
said.
Chitren, whose out pitch is
usually his slider, used an un
usually effective fastball in re
cording his nine K's.
"His fastball was really good.
They're always aware of his
slider. He froze a lot of hitters
with his fastball when they
were looking slider," Dunton
said.
"It's a different approach.
You can't go after the hitters
as much as you can in relief,"
Chitren said.
"I was spotting my fastball
real well. I struggled with my
slider the first couple innings,
but then I got control of it and
started getting people out with
it," Chitren added.
