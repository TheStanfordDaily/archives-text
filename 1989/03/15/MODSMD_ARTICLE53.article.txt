# Anderson leads swimmers into NCAAs
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Although most Stanford students would
think going out of town for six days during
Dead Week is not a good idea, Dana Anderson,
for one, won't mind disrupting her studies
one bit.
It's not that she doesn't care about school
— the senior is a member of the Stanford
Athletic honor roll for her combination of
athletics and academics. It's just that given
the choice between studying at home during
Dead Week and competing in the NCAA Wom
en's Swimming and Diving Championships,
the latter wins every time.
Anderson knows the difference as well as
anyone, having seen both sides in her career
here. After competing at the NCAA meet, and
earning All-America honors five times, her
first two seasons on the Farm, illness and
injury kept her from making last year's trav
eling squad.
In 1989, however, Anderson is back and
will be competing for the second-ranked Car
dinal in the NCAA meet. The meet runs to
morrow through Saturday in Indianapolis,
Ind.
After coming to Stanford from two-time
national prep champion Bolles Prep, the Jack
sonville, Fla. native started with a bang. She
took seventh in the 500-yard freestyle and
13th in the 200 freestyle at the NCAA Cham
pionships as a frosh.
The following year, at the first-ever Pacific
10 Conference Championships, she became the
first swimmer to win an individual Pac-10

title, taking the 500 freestyle on the opening
day of the meet. She went on to finish ninth
in that event at the NCAA meet, also taking
10th in the 200 and again swam on the third
place Cardinal 800 freestyle relay squad.
Things went downhill fast from there, how
ever. Her junior season began with her missing
much of fall training in the hospital and
recovering from a nasty flu-like sickness.
By Christmas break, however, Anderson was
feeling better and ready for the start of the
dual-meet season.
"I was training fine," she said. "On the
night before the first dual meet I wiped out."
Anderson slipped on a wet spot in Toyon Hall
and broke her wrist. Prognosis: eight weeks,
or all the regular season.
But Anderson was not going to give up
easily. She was determined to stay in shape
and get back in the water in time to qualify
for NCAAs.
"The entire time I never gave up hope,"
she said. "I think I was the only person in
the world who thought I would make it. I
was in the water the very next day."
Anderson recovered quickly enough to swim
in the final dual meet of the year, against
California. But because of all the disruptions
of her training, caused by the illness and the
injury, Anderson just missed qualifying for
the NCAA meet against California, and
couldn't do it the next week at the Pac-10
meet either.
With her season over, she decided to stop
out spring quarter to train. "It was hell," she
said. "It spurred me to stop out. I needed to
get away from school and just train for the

Olympic Trials."
Anderson decided to train with a friend in
St. Louis, but on the drive out her friend told
Anderson she was going to Arizona to train.
Anderson decided to give St. Louis a shot
anyway, and on the first day of practice, her
new coach announced he was probably going
to take another job, also, coincidentally, in
Arizona.
"That had a really rocky start," Anderson
said. "My world was totally rocked."
Anderson bounced back quickly, however,
and had a good meet at the Olympic Trials,
taking 12th in the 400-meter freestyle. "I was
happy with it," she said. "Not many Stanford
swimmers went and did well. ... After trials
I had a lot of expectations to come in and be
a team leader but since I had a harder time
than I thought I would, my expectations
waned.
"I started off a little shaky. I think a lot
of the reason why I did was because I was
out of school for seven months. I really had
a hard time getting back into school. ... I
don't regret stopping out, though."
Anderson started slowly in the dual meet
season due, in part, to a lack of confidence.
"The dual meets — each of them got better.
I was pretty happy with the conference
meet. . . . Since I've been back from conference
I've been swimming well for me. I have a lot
of confidence."
And her confidence and better times could
not have come at a better time. Stanford is
considered an underdog to top-ranked Florida
and every point will help.
