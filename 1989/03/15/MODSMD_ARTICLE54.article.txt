## Tumblers travel to Pac-10s 
### 
The Stanford men's gymnas
tics team is optimistic about
its chances at the Pacific 10
Conference Championships on
March 24 and 25 at Berkeley's
Harmon Arena.
Co-captain Adam Forman
put it bluntly: "We plan to
win."
The Cardinal's team score
average is among the nation's
top five, but in its last three
meets it has been defeated by
its only conference rival UCLA.
In the most recent contest, last
Saturday, the Bruins finished
well ahead of Stanford, but
only as a result of the Cardinal
gymnasts' experimental ap
proach which saw them at
tempt a number of new tricks
in preparation for post-season
competition.
"We definitely do have the
tools and potential to beat
UCLA," Forman said. "We
realize we have to stay on top
of our game and we have to
concentrate at all times."
Individually, the Cardinal
will bring home more than its
share of medals. Junior Conrad

Voorsanger and freshman Tim
Ryan each are prime con
tenders for the conference all
around title, while junior
Charles Loop is a dark horse
candidate. Senior Scott Scfraf
fer is among the favorites on
the vault and parallel bars.

Women gymnasts set !
record, beat Bears
Appropriate for their last
meet of the season, the Stan
ford women's gymnastics team
finished with another new
team score record and defeated
California, 189.55-185.4 on
Sunday at Maples Pavilion.
Although the team ended the
season with more losses, 18,
than victories, 10, the team up
held its season-long trend of
setting team and individual
records during Sunday's com
petition.
According to senior co-captain
Sheri Evenson, it was the team's
energy and momentum that kept
the team flying throughout the
meet. After struggling to complete
their routines with greater con
sistency all season, the women's
gymnastics team exhibited partic
ularly strong routines one after
the other, event after event.
Evenson, who has been break
ing records all season, set new
school records on the vault with
a score of 9.7 and in the all-around
with a 38.4. Evenson said that
finishing the season on such a
"high" could not be more exciting,
especially because it is her last
year competing for the team.
On the uneven bars, freshman
Denise Villars set a record with
a score of 9.7.
In addition to the strong indi
vidual performances, the team set
records on the uneven bars with
a score of 47.65 and the balance
beam with a score of 47.3.
Coach Homer Sardina said that
the team has been "peaking" all
season and that the could not be
more pleased with the team's per
formance.
In addition to their victory over
UC-Berkeley, the team also won
easily at UC-Davis.
Although their season's meets
are over, the women's gymnastics
team, ranked No. 17 in the nation,
now must focus their concentra
tion and energy on preparing for
the April 1 regionals at Fullerton
State.

Track places Bernhagen,
Purpur at Nat'l Indoors
Too bad they have to break ties
at track meets. Lisa Bernhagen,
competing in her final collegiate
meet for Stanford Friday at the
NCAA Indoor Championships,
finished second in the women's
high jump due to a tiebreaker.
Bernhagen, competing against
old high school rival Paula
Pettingill-John of Weaver State,
was one of three survivors left at
the height 6 foot 2. All three
missed their attempts, and Bern
hagen, with one previous miss,
was relegated to second place.

"It didn't go as well as I thought
it would," she said.
Bernhagen, who in 1987 set an
NCAA indoor collegiate high jump
record, had her best NCAA finish
Friday. When the field started to
fade, she said, "I got a little anx
ious and started moving up on
the bar," and had to settle for
second behind Pettingill-John.
With one season of eligibility
left, the indoor season was her
last for Stanford. A five-time All-
American, she will be undergoing
knee surgery and taking a few
weeks off before beginning prep
aration for the national outdoor
track and field scene.
Patty Purpur was also an Ail-
American Saturday in the shot
put, taking fourth. While happy
with her place, she had hoped for
a better throw during the compe
tition.
"The most frustrating part of
it is, I don't think I could have
prepared any better," she said.
After throwing well during warm
ups, "I just couldn't get that
rhythm back."

Grapplers Buddie and
Yarbrough have Ail-
American hopes at NCAAs
In the past few years, Stanford
and NCAA championship wres
tling have been kind of like tooth
paste and orange juice; they just
haven't meshed.
Junior Steve Yarbrough and
sophomore Steve Buddie are de
termined to change things. Both
will be wearing Cardinal red at
the NCAA Championships March
16-18 in Oklahoma City.
"When you reach a higher level,
anybody can beat anybody.
Anybody can even win the tour
nament if they wrestle really
well," said Yarbrough.
"What Steve and I have to do
is go in with a positive mental
attitude. We can't get freaked out
by the size of the tournament or
start thinking this is the NCAAs
and I don't deserve to be here.
No one is expecting us necessarily
to be Ail-Americans. We are going
to be wrestling to win, not wres
tling not to lose. I think both of
us have a really good shot."
To be named Ail-American,

Women gymnasts set !
record, beat Bears
Appropriate for their last
meet of the season, the Stan
ford women's gymnastics team
finished with another new
team score record and defeated
California, 189.55-185.4 on
Sunday at Maples Pavilion.
Although the team ended the
season with more losses, 18,
than victories, 10, the team up
held its season-long trend of
setting team and individual
records during Sunday's com
petition.
According to senior co-captain
Sheri Evenson, it was the team's
energy and momentum that kept
the team flying throughout the
meet. After struggling to complete
their routines with greater con
sistency all season, the women's
gymnastics team exhibited partic
ularly strong routines one after
the other, event after event.
Evenson, who has been break
ing records all season, set new
school records on the vault with
a score of 9.7 and in the all-around
with a 38.4. Evenson said that
finishing the season on such a
"high" could not be more exciting,
especially because it is her last
year competing for the team.
On the uneven bars, freshman
Denise Villars set a record with
a score of 9.7.
In addition to the strong indi
vidual performances, the team set
records on the uneven bars with
a score of 47.65 and the balance
beam with a score of 47.3.
Coach Homer Sardina said that
the team has been "peaking" all
season and that the could not be
more pleased with the team's per
formance.
In addition to their victory over
UC-Berkeley, the team also won
easily at UC-Davis.
Although their season's meets
are over, the women's gymnastics
team, ranked No. 17 in the nation,
now must focus their concentra
tion and energy on preparing for
the April 1 regionals at Fullerton
State.

Track places Bernhagen,
Purpur at Nat'l Indoors
Too bad they have to break ties
at track meets. Lisa Bernhagen,
competing in her final collegiate
meet for Stanford Friday at the
NCAA Indoor Championships,
finished second in the women's
high jump due to a tiebreaker.
Bernhagen, competing against
old high school rival Paula
Pettingill-John of Weaver State,
was one of three survivors left at
the height 6 foot 2. All three
missed their attempts, and Bern
hagen, with one previous miss,
was relegated to second place.

"It didn't go as well as I thought
it would," she said.
Bernhagen, who in 1987 set an
NCAA indoor collegiate high jump
record, had her best NCAA finish
Friday. When the field started to
fade, she said, "I got a little anx
ious and started moving up on
the bar," and had to settle for
second behind Pettingill-John.
With one season of eligibility
left, the indoor season was her
last for Stanford. A five-time All-
American, she will be undergoing
knee surgery and taking a few
weeks off before beginning prep
aration for the national outdoor
track and field scene.
Patty Purpur was also an Ail-
American Saturday in the shot
put, taking fourth. While happy
with her place, she had hoped for
a better throw during the compe
tition.
"The most frustrating part of
it is, I don't think I could have
prepared any better," she said.
After throwing well during warm
ups, "I just couldn't get that
rhythm back."

Grapplers Buddie and
Yarbrough have Ail-
American hopes at NCAAs
In the past few years, Stanford
and NCAA championship wres
tling have been kind of like tooth
paste and orange juice; they just
haven't meshed.
Junior Steve Yarbrough and
sophomore Steve Buddie are de
termined to change things. Both
will be wearing Cardinal red at
the NCAA Championships March
16-18 in Oklahoma City.
"When you reach a higher level,
anybody can beat anybody.
Anybody can even win the tour
nament if they wrestle really
well," said Yarbrough.
"What Steve and I have to do
is go in with a positive mental
attitude. We can't get freaked out
by the size of the tournament or
start thinking this is the NCAAs
and I don't deserve to be here.
No one is expecting us necessarily
to be Ail-Americans. We are going
to be wrestling to win, not wres
tling not to lose. I think both of
us have a really good shot."
To be named Ail-American,
wrestlers must place in the top
eight of the tournament.

The Stanford men's gymnas

its chances at the Pacific 10
Conference Championships on
March 24 and 25 at Berkeley's
Harmon Arena.
Co-captain Adam Forman
put it bluntly: "We plan to

The Cardinal's team score
average is among the nation's
top five, but in its last three
meets it has been defeated by
its only conference rival UCLA.
In the most recent contest, last
Saturday, the Bruins finished
well ahead of Stanford, but
only as a result of the Cardinal
gymnasts' experimental ap

in preparation for post-season
competition.
