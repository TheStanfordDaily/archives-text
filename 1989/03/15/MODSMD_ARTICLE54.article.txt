## Tumblers travel to Pac-10s 
### 
The Stanford men's gymnas
tics team is optimistic about
its chances at the Pacific 10
Conference Championships on
March 24 and 25 at Berkeley's
Harmon Arena.
Co-captain Adam Forman
put it bluntly: "We plan to
win."
The Cardinal's team score
average is among the nation's
top five, but in its last three
meets it has been defeated by
its only conference rival UCLA.
In the most recent contest, last
Saturday, the Bruins finished
well ahead of Stanford, but
only as a result of the Cardinal
gymnasts' experimental ap
proach which saw them at
tempt a number of new tricks
in preparation for post-season
competition.
"We definitely do have the
tools and potential to beat
UCLA," Forman said. "We
realize we have to stay on top
of our game and we have to
concentrate at all times."
Individually, the Cardinal
will bring home more than its
share of medals. Junior Conrad

Voorsanger and freshman Tim
Ryan each are prime con
tenders for the conference all
around title, while junior
Charles Loop is a dark horse
candidate. Senior Scott Scfraf
fer is among the favorites on
the vault and parallel bars.

Although the team ended the
season with more losses, 18,

held its season-long trend of
setting team and individual
records during Sunday's com
petition.
