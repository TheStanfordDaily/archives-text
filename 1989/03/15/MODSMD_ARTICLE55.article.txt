I sometimes try to imagine the
Europe that might, have been, a
fantasied Europe free of the 12-
year Reich and its "thousand
darknesses of deathbringing
speech," as poet Paul Celan put it.
Within this alter-history, what
ever its barely imaginable ingre
dients, Celan like countless others
in Nazi-ridden Europe would not
have suffered the brutal loss of
family, culture, and community,
would not have become anything
like the poet he was, would not
ultimately have committed
suicide. And we would not have
the writings of Primo Levi.
Born in Turin, Italy in 1919 to
an assimilated Jewish family, Levi
(within this fantasy) would have
gone on to his career as an in
dustrial chemist and not been ar
rested for anti-Fascist resistance,
not gone through the quotidian
horror of a year in Auschwitz, not
survived to write some of this cen
tury's most acutely humane
prose, and not died two years ago
at the bottom of a stairwell in
the house where he was born.
Not, not, not — but so it is.
We can be grateful for his writings
if aghast at what precipitated
them. Primo Levi's first memoir,
"If This is a Man," takes its title
from his poem "Sh'ma," written
early in 1946, which asks if this

creature "who fights for a crust
of bread/ who dies at a yes or a
no" is truly a man, or if this other
"without hair or name ... eyes
empty and womb cold" is a wom
an.
This memoir, called "Survival
in Auschwitz" in the United
States, examines unblinkingly the
degradations and depredations of
camp existence: humiliation, cold,
hunger, sickness (of 650 persons
in Levi's transport from Italy, 24
ultimately survived). He describes
a recurrent dream many prisoners
had: They are at home telling
their story — to indifferent or

paid attention to the behavior of those

oblivious listeners.
As against the degradation of
human beings, Levi analyzes their
varied resistance in this early
book, begun immediately after his
return to Turin. One chapter
singles out a particular half hour
of his own. While fetching the
day's "soup," Levi recites to an
Alsatian friend snatches of
Ulysses' speech in Dante's "In
ferno": "you were made men, To
follow after knowledge and excel
lence." And another thing helped
him salvage a sense of human
worth: a civilian worker, Lorenzo,
who would bring Levi extra bread

and soup. After the war, this man
drank himself to death; Levi
named his own son Lorenzo.
It seems painfully fitting that
Primo Levi titled his last book,
"The Drowned and the Saved,"
with a title from his first.
"I Sommersi e i Salvati": the
terms again come from Dante's
"Inferno," but for this book, 40
years have intervened — years of
working at a trade, writing a sec
ond memoir, many stories and
two novels, and dealing with the
prominence his books brought
him, especially the German trans
lations of his memoir.
In"The Drowned and the
Saved" we find much of the pre
cision, and the dispassion audible
as passion and compassion, that
distinguished "Survival in Aush
witz."
We also find, after 40 years, no
lessening of mental pain, and a
desperate sense that the hate and
violence he witnessed still have
their sequel today, although the
Nazi camps remain unique:
"never before have so many
human lives been extinguished in
so short a time, and with so lucid
a combination of technological in
genuity, fanaticism and cruelty."
"The injury cannot be healed:
it extends through time, and the
Furies . . . perpetuate the torhien
tor's work by denying peace to
the tormented." One wonders how
Levi in this last book found the
strength to cull memory once
again or do the work of explana
tion and analysis he felt bound

to do.
Levi is acid and quick on the defensive
lies, the constructed memories of Germans
and other persecutors and bystanders. He
has a firm but unaccusing grasp on pris
oners in"the gray zone," those who con
nived or collaborated. He exposes the
shame of those like himself who witnessed
— helplessly — and survived the camps'
killing regime. And in a chapter called
"Useless Violence," he registers cruelties
that in fact had a use: to render the victim
subhuman, thus incapable of resistance or
of arousing guilt in the executioner.
Levi devotes a forceful chapter to the
"stereotypes" embodied in questions he is
always asked, especially by students: Why
did you not emigrate, escape, rebel? First
of all, he replies, people did do these things.
But second, if they did not, there were
ample causes unimaginable by someone
whose idea of captivity comes from Holly
wood cinema or of hunger from missing a
meal.
With care, clarity, and pointedness, Levi
describes the phases of oppression and dis
ablement that made escape or rebellion vir
tually impossible.
This book's final and perhaps most un
usual chapter quotes and comments on let
ters Levi received from German readers
for 20 years after "Survival in Auschwitz"
appeared there. Most come from the young
and/or penitent, although Levi emphasizes
that these responsive Germans are not a
representative sample, and even they sel
dom vitally realize what was done by and
in the name of Germany.
He quotes his own outraged reply, the
only such, to a correspondent who says
that the devil Hitler's "beautiful words"
betrayed them, that antisemitism was un
popular in Germany, that the people did
not know of or participate in persecution.
Levi reminds this man that the crematoria
ovens were designed, built, assembled, and
tested by a German company, Topf of Wies
baden, that went on operating long after
the war "and had not considered the ad
visability of changing its name." This letter

alone is worth the price of the book.
Levi like most survivors is also asked:
Why do you not hate the Germans? He
answers — sounding much like Martin Lu
ther King Jr. — that hatred would only
reinstate the evil that began it all. In place
of hate, in book after book he speaks with
an equanimity of mind and tone that makes
him our most valued witness on
"Auschwitz," a voice that is conveyed
clearly by Raymond Rosenthal's translation
of "The Drowned and the Saved."
Levi's sudden death, an apparent suicide,
utterly shocked people around the world
who relied on this voice — not for its
"wondrous celebration of life," as the dust
jacket claims, but for its fine-spirited re
sponse to degradation and death.
Some of Primo Levi's friends think his
death may have been inadvertent, and that
is also terribly troubling. We remain grate
ful for his writings, but what caused them
cost far too much.

oblivious listeners.
As against the degradation of
human beings, Levi analyzes their
varied resistance in this early
book, begun immediately after his
return to Turin. One chapter
singles out a particular half hour
of his own. While fetching the
day's "soup," Levi recites to an
Alsatian friend snatches of
Ulysses' speech in Dante's "In
ferno": "you were made men, To
follow after knowledge and excel
lence." And another thing helped
him salvage a sense of human
worth: a civilian worker, Lorenzo,
who would bring Levi extra bread

and soup. After the war, this man
drank himself to death; Levi
named his own son Lorenzo.
It seems painfully fitting that
Primo Levi titled his last book,
"The Drowned and the Saved,"
with a title from his first.
"I Sommersi e i Salvati": the
terms again come from Dante's
"Inferno," but for this book, 40
years have intervened — years of
working at a trade, writing a sec
ond memoir, many stories and
two novels, and dealing with the
prominence his books brought
him, especially the German trans
lations of his memoir.
In"The Drowned and the
Saved" we find much of the pre
cision, and the dispassion audible
as passion and compassion, that
distinguished "Survival in Aush
witz."
We also find, after 40 years, no
lessening of mental pain, and a
desperate sense that the hate and
violence he witnessed still have
their sequel today, although the
Nazi camps remain unique:
"never before have so many
human lives been extinguished in
so short a time, and with so lucid
a combination of technological in
genuity, fanaticism and cruelty."
"The injury cannot be healed:
it extends through time, and the
Furies . . . perpetuate the torhien
tor's work by denying peace to
the tormented." One wonders how
Levi in this last book found the
strength to cull memory once
again or do the work of explana
tion and analysis he felt bound

to do.
Levi is acid and quick on the defensive
lies, the constructed memories of Germans
and other persecutors and bystanders. He
has a firm but unaccusing grasp on pris
oners in"the gray zone," those who con
nived or collaborated. He exposes the
shame of those like himself who witnessed
— helplessly — and survived the camps'
killing regime. And in a chapter called
"Useless Violence," he registers cruelties
that in fact had a use: to render the victim
subhuman, thus incapable of resistance or
of arousing guilt in the executioner.
Levi devotes a forceful chapter to the
"stereotypes" embodied in questions he is
always asked, especially by students: Why
did you not emigrate, escape, rebel? First
of all, he replies, people did do these things.
But second, if they did not, there were
ample causes unimaginable by someone
whose idea of captivity comes from Holly
wood cinema or of hunger from missing a
meal.
With care, clarity, and pointedness, Levi
describes the phases of oppression and dis
ablement that made escape or rebellion vir
tually impossible.
This book's final and perhaps most un
usual chapter quotes and comments on let
ters Levi received from German readers
for 20 years after "Survival in Auschwitz"
appeared there. Most come from the young
and/or penitent, although Levi emphasizes
that these responsive Germans are not a
representative sample, and even they sel
dom vitally realize what was done by and
in the name of Germany.
He quotes his own outraged reply, the
only such, to a correspondent who says
that the devil Hitler's "beautiful words"
betrayed them, that antisemitism was un
popular in Germany, that the people did
not know of or participate in persecution.
Levi reminds this man that the crematoria
ovens were designed, built, assembled, and
tested by a German company, Topf of Wies
baden, that went on operating long after
the war "and had not considered the ad
visability of changing its name." This letter

alone is worth the price of the book.
Levi like most survivors is also asked:
Why do you not hate the Germans? He
answers — sounding much like Martin Lu
ther King Jr. — that hatred would only
reinstate the evil that began it all. In place
of hate, in book after book he speaks with
an equanimity of mind and tone that makes
him our most valued witness on
"Auschwitz," a voice that is conveyed
clearly by Raymond Rosenthal's translation
of "The Drowned and the Saved."
Levi's sudden death, an apparent suicide,
utterly shocked people around the world
who relied on this voice — not for its
"wondrous celebration of life," as the dust
jacket claims, but for its fine-spirited re
sponse to degradation and death.
Some of Primo Levi's friends think his
death may have been inadvertent, and that
is also terribly troubling. We remain grate
ful for his writings, but what caused them
cost far too much.
