I sometimes try to imagine the
Europe that might, have been, a
fantasied Europe free of the 12-
year Reich and its "thousand
darknesses of deathbringing
speech," as poet Paul Celan put it.
Within this alter-history, what
ever its barely imaginable ingre
dients, Celan like countless others
in Nazi-ridden Europe would not
have suffered the brutal loss of
family, culture, and community,
would not have become anything
like the poet he was, would not
ultimately have committed
suicide. And we would not have
the writings of Primo Levi.
Born in Turin, Italy in 1919 to
an assimilated Jewish family, Levi
(within this fantasy) would have
gone on to his career as an in
dustrial chemist and not been ar
rested for anti-Fascist resistance,
not gone through the quotidian
horror of a year in Auschwitz, not
survived to write some of this cen
tury's most acutely humane
prose, and not died two years ago
at the bottom of a stairwell in
the house where he was born.
Not, not, not — but so it is.
We can be grateful for his writings
if aghast at what precipitated
them. Primo Levi's first memoir,
"If This is a Man," takes its title
from his poem "Sh'ma," written
early in 1946, which asks if this

creature "who fights for a crust
of bread/ who dies at a yes or a
no" is truly a man, or if this other
"without hair or name ... eyes
empty and womb cold" is a wom
an.
This memoir, called "Survival
in Auschwitz" in the United
States, examines unblinkingly the
degradations and depredations of
camp existence: humiliation, cold,
hunger, sickness (of 650 persons
in Levi's transport from Italy, 24
ultimately survived). He describes
a recurrent dream many prisoners
had: They are at home telling
their story — to indifferent or

oblivious listeners.
As against the degradation of
human beings, Levi analyzes their
varied resistance in this early
book, begun immediately after his
return to Turin. One chapter
singles out a particular half hour
of his own. While fetching the
day's "soup," Levi recites to an
Alsatian friend snatches of
Ulysses' speech in Dante's "In
ferno": "you were made men, To
follow after knowledge and excel
lence." And another thing helped
him salvage a sense of human
worth: a civilian worker, Lorenzo,
who would bring Levi extra bread

and soup. After the war, this man
drank himself to death; Levi
named his own son Lorenzo.
It seems painfully fitting that
Primo Levi titled his last book,
"The Drowned and the Saved,"
with a title from his first.
"I Sommersi e i Salvati": the
terms again come from Dante's
"Inferno," but for this book, 40
years have intervened — years of
working at a trade, writing a sec
ond memoir, many stories and
two novels, and dealing with the
prominence his books brought
him, especially the German trans
lations of his memoir.
In"The Drowned and the
Saved" we find much of the pre
cision, and the dispassion audible
as passion and compassion, that
distinguished "Survival in Aush
witz."
We also find, after 40 years, no
lessening of mental pain, and a
desperate sense that the hate and
violence he witnessed still have
their sequel today, although the
Nazi camps remain unique:
"never before have so many
human lives been extinguished in
so short a time, and with so lucid
a combination of technological in
genuity, fanaticism and cruelty."
"The injury cannot be healed:
it extends through time, and the
Furies . . . perpetuate the torhien
tor's work by denying peace to
the tormented." One wonders how
Levi in this last book found the
strength to cull memory once
again or do the work of explana
tion and analysis he felt bound

Primo Levi's tragic death in 1987 shocked readers who had come
to rely upon his voice as testament to the human spirit's in
domitability.
