# 'Which book most influenced you and why?'
## 
### 
Editor's note: In this survey, profes
sors and administrators were asked
which book most influenced their lives
and why. Not surprisingly, some of
those queried were unable or unwilling
to respond to this formidable question.
Following are the responses of the cou
rageous. This survey is the second of
an occasional series.
Thomas Heller, director of Overseas
Studies and professor of law:
Two things come to mind in answer
) to your question. What influenced me
most, especially when I was a student,
was Thomas Mann's "Magic Moun
tain."
When I got a little older, Michael
Foucault's "The Order of Things" be
came an influence. Foucault's work is
a combination of modern epistemology
and metaphysics that causes me to
waste much of my life. Much of my
work came from — and still does come
from — an attempt to analyze the pro
duction of knowledge.
English Prof. Mary Wack:
This may be an unusual response.
As I thought over all the books that I
have read, those that I read as a chila
were the ones that made the most
lasting impression on me. For stimulat
ing certain instincts in me, my re
sponse is "The Stories of Robin Hood."
The stories are based on anonymous
ballads from the Medieval Ages and
the Renaissance. I read them when I
was about 8.
Robin Hood stood for happiness
without material wealth, natural envi
ronment rather than urban living, and
the belief that injustice can be fought
and righted. In these stories I am at
tracted to the paradox of the woman
reader. Reading the stories gives one
wonderful freedom from biological
restraints.... As a woman I identify
less with the women of the stories than
with Robin Hood and the other male
characters.

Anthropology Prof. George Spindler:
A book I discovered before World
War II was called "The Science of Man
in The World of Crisis." I read it and
carried it around in my pocket. It was
edited by Ralph Linton. It took a view
of realities I was beginning to encoun
ter as a young man in a war. It was
reassuring because it said in 12 dif
ferent ways that there are crises, but
that humans do overcome them and
confront them . ..

Faculty survey:
Professors and ad
ministrators divulge
the books that have
been most influential
in their lives.

Ehud Havazelet, lecturer in creative
writing:
That's a hell of a question'...
Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina." It's the book
I first read that showed me a complete
fictional world. It began to convince
me to do the same thing. The first
time I read it I was 13, and I've read
it several times since. It was the first
book to have an effect on me when I
was affectable.
Political Science Prof. Richard
Fagen:
I don't know if "Moby Dick" most
influenced my life but it made the big
gest impact. I liked it for its sheer
magnificence of writing and because
of its world-wide scope of themes such
as heroism, the sea, the confrontation
between good and evil. It's almost bibli
cal. ... I first read it when I was 13.

Classics Prof. Gregson Davis:
There are so many that one can
point to. I tell you one was "Patterns
of Culture" by Ruth Benedict which I
read as a freshman. It made me see
my own cultural heritage in a new light.
It helped to demysticize my colonial
background. It taught me that It's not
useful to think of culture in terms of
which is better, but instead to think of
culture as relative. Culture is not ab
solute. It's now on the reading list for
Cultures, Ideas and Values.
VTSS and Industrial Engineering
Prof. Jim Adams:
You got me. That's a tough 0ne....
The book that really made me think
in college was "Zen in the Art of Ar
chery" by Herrigel. The book is about
the author who went to Japan to be
come a Zen monk. It's a study of how
a man went from being a mainstream
European to getting a glimpse of a
different culture. It got me thinking
about different value systems and
made me want to do something really
well.
Jean Fetter, dean of Undergraduate
Admissions:
'What book most profoundly influ
enced you and why?' An impossible
question, of course, but since I ask
these kinds of things all the time of
thousands of poor high school seniors
... I
It's a little yellowed around the
edges, but I still have it. "Selected
Poems' bv T.S. Eliot. Seven shillings
and six pence. It's marked March 1958
(in a young looking hand). The influ
ence? A personal revelation of the
power of the English language in my
undergraduate years with the formulae
of physics.
"The Hollow Men." "Ash Wednes
day." Wonderful.
Hope this is what you wanted. Now
back to the questions for the freshmen
of 1989!
