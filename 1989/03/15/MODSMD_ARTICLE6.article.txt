Surprising a crowd of more

singer Joan Baez joined a panel
of five Saturday night for a

The panel argued that it is the
claim to an absolute truth — not
just present in the Islamic religion
but in Christianity, Judaism,
secular institutions and our own
homes — that can lead to a hatred
for those that disagree with this
absolute truth.
In response to a question about
how the "Satanic Verses" contro

Rushdie is killed, Stanford Asst.

the novel by writer and panelist
