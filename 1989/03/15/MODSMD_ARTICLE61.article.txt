## NEW YORK STORIES 
### Mia Manzulli 
Quick, what do Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola
and Woody Allen have in common? Besides being three of
the most prestigious directors in film today, these men
have collaborated to make New York Stories, a unique
anthology of three mini-films all set in Manhattan.
Each of these directors has made New York a central
element of his work. And in New York Stories it is
apparent that although the men share a fascination for
Manhattan, they each have a very different vision of life in
the Big Apple. The films are very distinctive, both in their
depiction of New York and in their directive styles, yet
somehow New York Stories is a delightful and cohesive
whole.
Life Lessons is Martin Scorsese's (Raging Bull, After
Hours, Last Temptation of Christ, New York, New York,
Mean Streets, Taxi Driver) look at the relationship
between New York artist Lionel Dobie, powerfully played
by Nick Nolte (Extreme Prejudice, 48 Hours, Under Fire,
Down and Out in Beverly Hills, Three Fugitives), and his
protege/lover Paulette, played by Rosanna Arquette
(Desperately Seeking Susan, The Big Blue). It is a story of
creative people who become so consumed by their art that
they begin to lose their perspective on life. In short, art is
their life.
Rosanna Arquette is both vulnerable and stubborn as she
plays the assistant to her Svengali-like master. Her beauty
heightens her power and her innocence as she fights to
retain her individuality in this emotionally draining
environment. Without a doubt, Nolte looks the artiste. He

does a great job when trying to share life's lessons with
Arquette while masterfully manipulating her to satisfy his
own needs.
The second film, Francis Ford Coppola's (The Godfather,
The Godfather, Part 11, Rumble Fish, The Cotton Club,
Peggy Sue Got Married, Gardens of Stone) Life Without
Zoe is the weakest of the three.
Zoe (played by newcomer Heather McComb) is a spoiled
12-year-old girl who lives in the Sherry Netherland Hotel
in Manhattan. Her parents are separated from each other,
and apparently from Zoe as well. Her mother, Charlotte,
played by the whiny Talia Shire (Rocky, Rocky 11, Rocky
111, Rocky IV, Rocky V, Rocky VI, Rocky and Bullwinkle)

and her father, Claudio (Giancarlo Giannini (A lot of
boring foreign movies)), a famed flautist, don't show up
until midway through the film.
Zoe lives in a lavish suite of rooms with an indulgent
butler named Hector played by Don Novello, best known
as Father Guido Sarducci on Saturday Night Live.
Novello's attempt to get Zoe ready for school is easily the
funniest part of the film.
Unfortunately the film falls flat on most other accounts,
most noticeably in its lack of action or climax. It does,
however, show the lifestyle of some rich New York kids
who hase too much money and too much freedom.
Granted, the depiction is overly exaggerated — Zoe and
her friends dress in extravagant Chanel ensembles, hats and
all — but it is funny in its excess.
Since New York Stories was originally conceived as a
showcase for three short films by Woody Allen (Take the
Money and Run, Bananas, Everything You Always Wanted
to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask, Sleeper, Love
and Death, Annie Hall, Interiors, Manhattan, Stardust
Memories, Zelig, Broadway Danny Rose, etc., etc.), it
seems appropriate that his piece is saved for last. Although
not necessarily the best of the three, Oedipus Wrecks
marks the return of Woody Allen the comedy writer as we
know and love him.
This is the delightfully wacky story of a New York
lawyer, Sheldon Mills (Woody Allen), who must try and
cope with the most frustrating person in his life — his
mother. Mae Questel (the original Betty Boop and Olive
Oyl cartoon voices) is wonderful as Sheldon's finicky
mother. Not only does she constantly but innocently
embarrass Sheldon, but she doesn't approve of his fiancee
either.
Sheldon's intended, Lisa, is none other than Allen's
long-time friend Mia Farrow (See Woody Allen's films).
Oedipus Wrecks marks the ninth film collaboration of
Allen and Farrow, who is sweet and pleasant in this latest
role. She suffers along with Sheldon as he deals with Mrs.
Millstein.
Allen's facial expressions are priceless, particularly when
his mother is an audience volunteer in a magic show.
You'll have to see for yourself what happens when Mom
actually does disappear. Soon, all of Manhattan will know
Sheldon and his dear over-protective mother. Although
Oedipus Wrecks is ridiculously implausible, it is witty,
creative and honestly very funny.

Quick, what do Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola
and Woody Allen have in common? Besides being three of
the most prestigious directors in film today, these men
have collaborated to make New York Stories, a unique
anthology of three mini-films all set in Manhattan.
Each of these directors has made New York a central
element of his work. And in New York Stories it is
apparent that although the men share a fascination for
Manhattan, they each have a very different vision of life in
the Big Apple. The films are very distinctive, both in their
depiction of New York and in their directive styles, yet
somehow New York Stories is a delightful and cohesive
whole.
Life Lessons is Martin Scorsese's (Raging Bull, After
Hours, Last Temptation of Christ, New York, New York,
Mean Streets, Taxi Driver) look at the relationship
between New York artist Lionel Dobie, powerfully played
by Nick Nolte (Extreme Prejudice, 48 Hours, Under Fire,
Down and Out in Beverly Hills, Three Fugitives), and his
protege/lover Paulette, played by Rosanna Arquette
(Desperately Seeking Susan, The Big Blue). It is a story of
creative people who become so consumed by their art that
they begin to lose their perspective on life. In short, art is
their life.
Rosanna Arquette is both vulnerable and stubborn as she
plays the assistant to her Svengali-like master. Her beauty
heightens her power and her innocence as she fights to
retain her individuality in this emotionally draining
environment. Without a doubt, Nolte looks the artiste. He

does a great job when trying to share life's lessons with
Arquette while masterfully manipulating her to satisfy his
own needs.
The second film, Francis Ford Coppola's (The Godfather,
The Godfather, Part 11, Rumble Fish, The Cotton Club,
Peggy Sue Got Married, Gardens of Stone) Life Without
Zoe is the weakest of the three.
Zoe (played by newcomer Heather McComb) is a spoiled
12-year-old girl who lives in the Sherry Netherland Hotel
in Manhattan. Her parents are separated from each other,
and apparently from Zoe as well. Her mother, Charlotte,
played by the whiny Talia Shire (Rocky, Rocky 11, Rocky
111, Rocky IV, Rocky V, Rocky VI, Rocky and Bullwinkle)

and her father, Claudio (Giancarlo Giannini (A lot of
boring foreign movies)), a famed flautist, don't show up
until midway through the film.
Zoe lives in a lavish suite of rooms with an indulgent
butler named Hector played by Don Novello, best known
as Father Guido Sarducci on Saturday Night Live.
Novello's attempt to get Zoe ready for school is easily the
funniest part of the film.
Unfortunately the film falls flat on most other accounts,
most noticeably in its lack of action or climax. It does,
however, show the lifestyle of some rich New York kids
who hase too much money and too much freedom.
Granted, the depiction is overly exaggerated — Zoe and
her friends dress in extravagant Chanel ensembles, hats and
all — but it is funny in its excess.
Since New York Stories was originally conceived as a
showcase for three short films by Woody Allen (Take the
Money and Run, Bananas, Everything You Always Wanted
to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask, Sleeper, Love
and Death, Annie Hall, Interiors, Manhattan, Stardust
Memories, Zelig, Broadway Danny Rose, etc., etc.), it
seems appropriate that his piece is saved for last. Although
not necessarily the best of the three, Oedipus Wrecks
marks the return of Woody Allen the comedy writer as we
know and love him.
This is the delightfully wacky story of a New York
lawyer, Sheldon Mills (Woody Allen), who must try and
cope with the most frustrating person in his life — his
mother. Mae Questel (the original Betty Boop and Olive
Oyl cartoon voices) is wonderful as Sheldon's finicky
mother. Not only does she constantly but innocently
embarrass Sheldon, but she doesn't approve of his fiancee
either.
Sheldon's intended, Lisa, is none other than Allen's
long-time friend Mia Farrow (See Woody Allen's films).
Oedipus Wrecks marks the ninth film collaboration of
Allen and Farrow, who is sweet and pleasant in this latest
role. She suffers along with Sheldon as he deals with Mrs.
Millstein.
Allen's facial expressions are priceless, particularly when
his mother is an audience volunteer in a magic show.
You'll have to see for yourself what happens when Mom
actually does disappear. Soon, all of Manhattan will know
Sheldon and his dear over-protective mother. Although
Oedipus Wrecks is ridiculously implausible, it is witty,
creative and honestly very funny.
