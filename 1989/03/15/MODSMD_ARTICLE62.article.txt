The Wonder Stuff: "The Eight-Legged Groove Machine"
Imagine what The Smiths would sound like if Morrisscy could smile ...
or suppose replaced Michael Stipe and Peter Buck with Rick
Astley and The Edge ... or maybe Debbie Gibson's twin brother
teamed up with Erasure. Got it? Well, whatever surrealistic sounds are
swirling through your head, they probably aren't too unlike The Wonder
Stuff's debut album The Eight-Legged Groove Machine.
Corny as the band's name might sound, they've got a down-to-earth
(landing on all eights, perhaps?) history. Vocalist/guitarist Miles Hunt
began writing songs with guitarist/vocalist Malcolm Trcccc and
drummer/nothing else Martin Gilks in early 1986. Hunt's

fricnd/bassist/last-mcmbcr-to-join-thc-group, Rob Jones — who is callcd
"The Bass Thing" for reasons that you probably shouldn't hear without
parental guidance — rounded out the Wolverhampton, England, quartet.
Hence, the "cight-lcggcd" groove machinc.
According to Hunt, the band formed "because wc couldn't find
anything wc wanted to listen to." And I believe it. Although The Wonder
Stuff draw upon many bands for inspiration, they don't copy anyone.
Echoes of R.E.M., The Smiths and The Connells may linger long after
you've shelved the album for the night, but there's no question that this
band offers something fresh.
The Wonder Stuff arc consistently upbeat and sensationally melodic, yet
they avoid sounding like just another pop band. Most of the credit goes
to the guitar work. Trcccc and Hunt show what a skilled guitar duo can
do for a band, performing as U2's The Edge and Rush's Alex Lifcson
might together. As far as the rhythm section goes, whatever Rob "The
Bass Thing" Jones does with his bass thing, it seems to help, but Martin
Gilk's lifeless drum work makes mc wonder whether the band borrowed
a drummer from Depeche Mode. (Yes, you got the joke, Depeche Mode
doesn't use a drummer but synthesized drum beats.)
Further distancing the music from top-40 banality, the lyrics are about
as far from Tiffany's la-la-land catechisms as you can get. "It's Yer
Money I'm After, Baby" satirizes the Donald Trump approach to
love-making. Likewise, the band extols existentialism in "Give, Give, Give
Mc More, More, More." (Not to mention advocating excessively long
song titles.)

The Wonder Stuff arc at their best on "Unbearable" which was
released as their first single more than two years ago. A pulsing beat
parallels scalar guitar chording as Vie Wonder Stuff laments a close
encounter of the anti-social kind: "I didn't like you very much when I
met you and now I like you even less." Another top pick is "A Wish
Away," a surprisingly optimistic tunc which features vocalist Hunt rattling
of his wistful thoughts faster than Robin Williams.
The wedding of upbeat music and cynical lyrics isn't unique (i.e. The
Smiths' "Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before"), but
it's unusual enough to merit The Wonder Stuff some praise for pulling it
off with class. The Eight-lagged Groove Machine is a dual success in
that it provides enjoyable music with something to think about. Don't let
the silly title fool you.

The Replacements: "Don't Tell a Soul"
On their third major release, The Replacements have crafted 11 songs
that get better every time you hear them. At first, Don't Tell a Soul may
strike the loyal fan as ovcr-produccd, but subsequent listenings reveal a
heart-felt effort that will grow on you. Although "Don't Tell a Soul" is
the group's most polished outing to date, their fans shouldn't worry
about them playing at the White House anytime in the near future.
There was probably a time when The Replacements had a hard time
playing in their parents' houses. When they first got together bass player
Tommy Stinson was only 12; singer and guitar player Paul Wcstcrbcrg
was 15; and former lead guitar player Bobby Stinson was 18.
The group formed after Wcstcrbcrg overheard loud guitar noises
coming out of the Stinson home in north Minneapolis. Wcstcrbcrg
approached older brother Bobby and claimed he was a singer, although
he had never sung before in his life. They attracted drummer Chris Mars
and began to build up a loyal audience in the Twin Cities.
Their first album, Sorry Ma I Forgot to Take out the Trash, came out
on the independent Twin Tone label in 1981. While most bands at their
age were playing REO Spccdwagon covers, The Replacements thrashed
out 18 raw and urgent tunes including "I Bought a Headache," a
commentary on big arena concerts; "Johnny's Gonna Die," an ode to
rock star and heroin addict Johnny Thunders; and "Takin' a Ride," a
song about my favorite pastime, committing major traffic violations.
The HP that followed, 1982's Stink, was an experiment in hardcore
thrash. Titles like "F*ck School," "Gimme Noise" and "(I Need a)
Goddamn Job" accurately depict the EP's rebellious and adolescent
themes. In fact, the first song began with a recording of a party being
broken up by the Minneapolis police, who encountered a lcss-than
cnthusiastic response from the party's guests. Despite their anti-dope
recording "Dope Smoking Moron," one of their worst songs to date, the
band was already gaining a reputation for serious alcohol abuse.
The proverbial enfants tcrriblcs of the Minneapolis scene, The
Replacements were one of many great bands that came out of the Twin
Cities in the early '80s. Alongside such groups as Hiisker Dii, Soul
Asylum, the Suburbs, and the Figures, The Replacements garnered much
interest in the Twin Cities' music scene among college and alternative
radio station programmers.
Though it received little airplay, 1984's Let It Be was a breakthrough
record for The Replacements. It was cut less haphazard than their
previous outings, and Wcsterbcrg's songwriting received attention from a

number of major music magazines. "I Will Dare" was an inspired stomp
which featured a guitar solo by REM's Peter Buck and great Westberg
lyrics. Also included was an anti-MTV tirade called "Seen Your Video.'
In fact, the band made no videos until their next record, but even then
their video was only a three and a half minute still camera shot of a
loudspeaker playing their song.
Another song, "Sixteen Blue," was a slow, melancholy teenage lament
and the band's last goodbye to adolescent angst and boredom. The
record's last cut, "Answering Machine," featured Westcrberg alone on an
clcctric 12-string guitar asking "How do you say I'm OK to an answering
machine?" and was singled out by critics as testimony to Wcsterbcrg's
introspective depth.
After Let It Be, the band signed on with Sire Records and released
Tim in 1985. A straightforward rocker, Tim sold moderately well and
even led to an appearance on Saturday Night Live featuring Bob Stinson
wearily a rainbow-striped dress and the entire band turning their amps
up as far as they would go. The rocking song, "Bastards of Young,"
despite its title, was a poignant description of how the band felt having
a substantial regional and college audience but no widespread aiiplay.
Tim was also their last to feature Bob Stinson on guitar. His drinking
and wild man persona had gotten out of control. As Westcrberg said in
a rcccnt interview, Bob "lived for the image, whereas we played it up
but didn't bring it home." The other three decided that it was in both
Bob's and the band's interest that he leave the group, and Westcrberg
subsequently played all the guitar parts on their 1987 release Pleased to
Meet Me.
Rccordcd in Memphis, Pleased to Meet Me was an interesting and
varied collection. Although one of the record's biggest potential hits,
"Can't Hardly Wait," was almost ruined by overproduction, Pleased to
Meet Me benefitted from the band's growing attcntivcncss to their work.
The record's best songs included "Alex Chilton," a homage to the
former Boxtop and Big Star singer of the same name; "The Ledge," a
chilling song about suicidc; and "Can't Hardly Wait," which, despite its
cheesy brass section, stood out as a classic with both a catchy beat and
irreverent lyrics like "Jesus rides beside me / He never has any smokes."
After an extended tour with new guitar player Bob "Slim" Dunlap,
who was rccruitcd from another Minneapolis band, The Replacements
recorded Don't Tell a Soul last year. A short listen to any of the songs
reveals that the band put more into this record than any of their
previous efforts. At the same time the record is mellow by The
Replacements' standards. The cut "Anywhere Is Better Than Here,"
though, renders asunder any doubts about the bands ability to still rock
hard.
The album's first cut, "Talent Show," about newly aspirant rock stars,
seems a little corny at first but really grows on you. "Achin* to Be," a
song about a woman who "dances alone in nightclubs every other day of
the week," is a bittersweet paean to a frustrated bohemian. In the same
musical vein of the Police's "Spirits in the Material World," "Rock 'n'
Roll Ghost" is a dark ode to the dead heroes of rock music. The
album's first single, "I'll Be You," is probably the most infectious tune
on the record with a catchy chorus and great lyrics.
The only clunker in the whole lot is the '50ish "They're Blind," which
drags on humorlcssly for what seems to be much longer than its actual
four minutes. This track aside, though, Don't Tell a Soul is The
Replacements ' most thoughtful and introspective record to date. It stands
out as an excellent batch of songs that will likely bring The Replacements
the wider audience they deserve.
