### 
Note: The UCMI offers this summary of
almost eighteen months of work as an
overview and an introduction to our Final
Report. Because a summary is necessarily
abbreviated and incomplete, we strongly
urge all those interested to read the entire
UCMI Final Report.

BUILDING A MULTIRACIAL,
MULTICULTURAL UNIVERSITY
COMMUNITY—A VISION FOR
STANFORD

The galvanizing vision of twenty
years ago—a vision of racial justice,
equal opportunity, and affirmative
action—produced significant changes at
Stanford and across the nation. But that
vision has since weakened, and the
vigorous convictions that spurred
changed have dissipated. For well over
a decade, the national agenda, reflected
in pubic opinion, has largely ignored ra
cial issues; the social contract placing
racial equality high in the Amercan
value system has torn and faded. We
have seen a rise in intolerance and
racial tensions—especially on college
campuses, where nearly a hundred
race-related incidents have occurred
during the past two years alone.
Stanford, among dozens of other
universities, has determined to under
stand and respond to this troubled state
of race relations on campus. What ac
counts for the wider polarization of
relations between some White and
minority students on campus? What
compelled minority groups to form the
Rainbow Agenda coalition in spring of
1987 and to demand the investigation of
racial issues? Are we witnessing a "new
racism," or do other factors explain the
increase in racial incidents?
In October, 1987, the University
Committee on Minority Issues (UCMI)
was established by the President and
Provost in response to the Rainbow

Agenda. For over a year, the UCMI
investigated the status of minority
students, faculty, and staff at Stanford
University, compiled existing data and
collected abundant new information
about race relations on campus. In our
Interim Report, released in May 1988,
we outlined the most urgent concerns
and presented preliminary data and rec
ommendations in five major agenda
areas:
1) the undergraduate curriculum;
2) minority faculty recruitment, hiring,
and promotion;
3) undergraduate and graduate
student recruitment, admissions,
financial aid, and retention;
4) student life; and
5) staff recruitment, hiring, promotion,
and development.
The Final Report presents our
major findings, conclusions, and
recommendations for consideration by
the President, the Provost, and all
interested members of the University
community.
A profound change underway at
Stanford illustrates the dilemmas of an
educational institution trying to resolve
problems deeply, historically ingrained
in American society. Twenty years ago,
Stanford made a commitment to actively
seek out more minority students, faculty,
and staff. Today, we have achieved
unprecedented racial and ethnic
diversity, especially in the undergradu
ate student body. Now we must make a
new commitment: we must make the
transition from numerical diversity to
interactive pluralism. We must find
ways for our racial minorities and
majority to acknowledge and build
respect for their similarities as well as
their differences.
We recognize that establishing an
interactive, multiracial community on

campus—a community where all ethnic
groups can engage their differences in a
process of mutual enrichment—is a
formidable challenge. We will have to
make our new commitment both indi
vidually and institutionally. Each of us
must be willing to question our many
racial attitudes and beliefs and be willing
to educate ourselves to achieve
renewed understanding of the people
around us in our daily personal and
professional lives. The University must
be willing to provide the institutional
framework for this process and must
make the goal of preparing students for
leadership in a multicultural society an
integral part of Stanford's educational
mission.
This is no naive or uncertain
proposition. One need only look back
twenty or twenty-five years to measure
the tremendous progress we have
achieved on many fronts. But racial
problems in the United States are
deeply rooted, and we as citizens of the
nation and the University reflect both our
common history and our contemporary
society. As we confront these problems,
we should see our participation in the
Stanford community as a unique chance
to achieve a degree of interracial under
standing seldom found in our larger
society.
We have stated our goals, based
on the humanistic value of respect for
others; next we must identify the
particular problems preventing effective
ethnic and racial relations on campus.
In general, we find the problems
explainable, and we propose specific
measures to help resolve them.
What are the major problems and
prospects?
