# Palo Alto council approves study of proposed Sand Hill extension
## 
### Eric Young Editorial staff 
For the first time, Palo Alto,
Menlo Park and Stanford appear
to be in sync on planning for an
extension of Sand Hill Road to El
Camino Real.
On Monday night the Palo Alto
City Council voted 5-2 to move
forward with an environmental
review of likely alternatives for a
Sand Hill extension through the
Stanford Shopping Center parking
lot.
The Palo AJto vote followed a
similar Menlo Park City Council

vote last week of 4-1.
Essentially the two cities and
the University have agreed on a
"plan for a plan" to extend the
road. That doesn't mean that the
extension will necessarily ever
happen, although the University
would dearly love it.
Residents of Palo Alto and
Menlo Park have debated with
Stanford administrators for
decades about the extension.
Stanford has called consistently
for the El Camino connection.
That part is easy enough.
But the two cities are stuck on
a related matter. Menlo Park in

sists that the extension continue
through to Palo Alto's Alma
Street, so that cars don't clog
western Menlo Park streets. Palo
Alto contends that the Alma con
nection would devastate the
northern neighborhood of the city.
The dispute led to a lawsuit be
tween the two cities.
But a new cooperative task
force of representatives from the
two cities and the University,
working for over a year, led to
the city council decisions. The en
vironmental impact report will
look at seven alternative ways to
extend Sand Hill.
