# Draw canceled, frosh to be assigned alphabetically
## 
### Lori Silver Editorial staff 
Stanford's annual housing draw
has been canceled this year due
to the inability of current com
puter software to account for the
reopening of Roble Hall and the
changes in returning residence
priority, the Stanford Housing
Center announced yesterday.
Under a temporary housing al
location plan, undergraduates
guaranteed housing next year will
keep the number tney received in
last year's Draw. All freshmen,
transfer students and currently
unguaranteed undergraduates
will be assigned to housing alpha
betically, with people whose last
names begin with the letter A re
ceiving first choice.
Students who are not guar
anteed housing next year but wish

to live on campus will also be
assigned alphabetically, beginning
with last names of A.
"How bad is that!" said Josh
Zander, an unguaranteed junior,
when informed of the cancellation
by The Daily. "There's no way
I'm going to live in the basement
of Stern."
A statement released yesterday
by the center acknowleged that
the measures were "drastic" and
"could be interpreted as unfair."
However, the release stated,
"These measure were designed on
an ad hoc basis, and the lottery
based draw will be reinstated next
year."
"We're extremely embarrassed
by all this," said a housing center
official who wished to remain
anonymous. "Hopefully, the stu
dents will be understanding. After
all, they're willing to live in Man-

zanita."
Chief among reasons causing
the Draw's cancellation was a lack
of computer software that could
factor in the reopening of Roble
and the changes in returning res
idence priority when allocating
housing.
Although the press release did
not elaborate on the center's at

tempts to obtain the correct
software, the housing center offi
cial said that the center had com
missioned new software from a
graduate student in the Computer
Science Department.
Last week, the official said, a
computer virus destroyed most of
the student's work, leaving the
center with no alternative but to

cancel this year's Draw.
The Draw was orginally sched
uled to take place April 25-28.
Stanford Housing Center Direc
tor Rodger Whitney would not
return The Daily's phone calls
yesterday.
The sudden announcement
caught University officials, resi
dent fellows, resident assistants
and students by surprise.
Council of Presidents member
Stacey Leyton noted that the can
cellation "is just another example
of how students are not involved
in the University's decision
making process." The COP will
organize a student sit-in in White
Plaza to protest the measures, she
said.
Branner RA David Hornik said
that members of the all-frosh
dorm "are pretty gosh-darn up
set."

"I'm so glad my last name
begins with a C," said Amy Clark,
a junior who is guaranteed
housing next year. "This makes
up for drawing 4463 last year."
John Abbott, a freshman in
Donner, said that he plans to "put
Storey House at the top of my
list."
Residential Education Director
Alice Supton noted that the allo
cation measures may make pro
gramming more difficult in the
residences.
"If you have all the Smiths on
campus living in Wilbur, obviously
the dorm's makeup will not refect
Stanford's wide range of ethnic
diversity. RAs will really have
their job cut out for them, plan
ning programming appropriate
for a multicultural community,"
she said.
