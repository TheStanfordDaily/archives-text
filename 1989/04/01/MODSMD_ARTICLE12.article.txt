### Baldwin Lee Staff writer 
The gun sounded
at 8 a.m. today as
candidates in the
1989 ASSU General
Election sprinted
off, marking the be
ginning of the cam
paign season.

This year's election is sporting
several new features, including
the state's first computerized
voting system and six scheduled
debates between Council of Presi
dents slates.
The new computerized voting
system has attracted interest
throughout California. The Secre
tary of State's office is sending
representatives to watch the com
puterized election, according to
sophomore Steve Krauss, the
ASSU Elections Commissioner.
Santa Clara Registrar of Voters
George Mann said that no official
computerized elections have oc
curred on the city, county or state
level in California. Mann added

that a representative from his of
fice is coming to Stanford on April
19 to watch the election process.
The other miy'or change in this
year's elections is the marked in
crease in number of COP debates.
Last year, the COP candidates
clashed only once in a campus
debate.
Debates are scheduled for Wed
nesday, Thursday and next Mon
day, beginning at 6 p.m. and 7:30
p.m. The sites are yet to be de
termined.
The increased number of
debates should make them acces
sible to all students, according to
Associate Elections Commissioner
Michael Conte. Conte said he
hopes the debates will allow stu
dents to vote on issues rather than
just on a name or a face.
Three COP slates are running
this year: the "Hammer and Cof
fin" slate of the Chaparral, the
"Slate of the Times" of the
People's Platform party and the
"Students' Choice" slate of the
newly-formed Students First

party. All three slates said they
plan to participate in the debates.
The Chaparral COP slate orig
inally intended to call themselves
"The People's Platform," but elec
tions officials feared that the
name would cr.use confusion.
Krauss said he asked the slate to
change its name, which they did
voluntarily.
Seventeen graduate student and
43 undergraduate student candi
dates for ASSU Senate also
started campaigning today. The
candidates are running for 20 un
dergraduate seats and 20 gradu
ate seats. The 20 positions are
composed of 10 voting senators
and 10 non-voting senators.
The undergraduate senatorial
candidate field is composed of 22
freshman, 14 sophomores, and
nine juniors. This cross section is
typical of past elections.
One constitutional amendment
has been placed on this year's elec
tion ballot. The amendment, "To
Provide for Increases and
Decreases in General Fees," al

lows the senate to increase or
decrease by up to 30 percent fee
assessments requested by student
groups and approved by the stu
dents in general elections.
Graduate senator David Fallek,
a sponsor of the amendment, said
the amendment was written to ac

comodate the growing number of
student programs and organiza
tions that have requested funding
through the three general fee
categories: Program Board, Pub
lications Board and the Commu
nity Service Fund.
The present system only allows

students in the general elections
to change general fees in five per
cent increments, up to 20 percent.
Fallek said that as a result of this
system, the general fees have re
mained the same for last five
years, although funding needs
have changed.
