# Unofficial DUs to hold aggressive rush
## 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
Despite the official non-existence of
the Delta Upsilon Fraternity on campus,
its members are holding a more aggres
sive spring rush this year than in the
past.
After a string of disciplinary prob
lems, the DUs in 1986 not only lost
their house, currently 553 Mayfield Ave.,
but also lost the recognition of their
national chapter.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano
said he was not surprised by the DUs'
rush activities this year, since he was
aware of the group's clandestine exis
tence after it was kicked off campus. *
But Pisano said he was surprised
about the DUs "more public and ag
gressive" recruiting tactics than those
in their past two rushes.
The DUs have placed a full-page ad
vertisement in today's Daily at a stand

ard cost of more than $1,000. In addi
tion, DU members have distributed
fliers advertising rush activities around
campus and brought the fliers to an
Interfraternity Council informational
meeting for potential rushees held last
Wednesday.
The DUs have not previously ad
vertised in The Daily but have used
fliers in the past two underground
rushes. However, the DU nationd chap
ter has run several advertisements in
The Daily since 1986, reminding poten
tial rushees that it no longer recognizes
the DU name at Stanford.
In another recruiting effort, a DU
member spoke during a lull at the IFC
Rush informational meeting. The mem
ber told the potential rushees to "skip
all this (IFC) nonsense. DUs have been
here, are here, and will always be here."
After the proclamation, the DU left
the room while a stunned IFC Rush
Chair Todd Ortega warned those at the

meeting that DU is not recognized by
the University and has no national
recognition at Stanford.
"We're really excited about Rush this
year," said the DU rush chair, who
wished to remain anonymous. "It's
amazing that we're so strong after being
off-campus for so long. We're just a
great bunch of guys that love to have
fun â€” it just shows how well we get
along together."
The members of DU said they wish
to remain anonymous because public
recognition with the group could lead
to problems with the University.
There are currently 60 members of
the unrecognized DU chapter at Stan
ford, with another 10 alumni in the
area who still participate in DU func
tions, such as formais, war games in
San Jose and ski trios. The DUs are
prohibited from holding any
events on campus.
The DU Rush chair disagreed
with preconceptions about DUs
"always wanting to best the ad
ministration." He explained,
"We're not out to get or destroy
anybody. We're just a drinking
club."
In response to renewed DU ac
tivism, IFC President Chris Erlin
said he "respected (the DU) desire
to go out and let loose, but I wish
they would not interfere with our
system. They drag the (general)
fraternity name down by doing
anti-community activities and
other extreme acts. In that sense,
I hate it."
The DU Rush chair said he did
not anticipate the University cas
tigating any current DU members
because of rush or today's adver
tisement. "It's not a fundamental
violation to belong to an organi
zation that does not exist."
