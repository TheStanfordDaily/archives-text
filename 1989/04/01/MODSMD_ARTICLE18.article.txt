### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
With the insight and caution of pro
fessional journalists, former New York
Times Moscow correspondents Philip
Taubman and Felicity Barringer told of
improvements in the Soviet Union but
warned against painting too rosy a pic
ture of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev's reforms.
The husband and wife team of Stan
ford graduates, speaking before a group
of about 30 in Slavianskii Dom last

night, said journalists and Soviet citizens
have freedom to print and discuss more
issues than they did a few years ago,
but the Communist Party officials still
retain a tight control over information
in the Soviet Union.
"The boundary on what can be pub
lished is still set by the Party," said
Taubman, who was editor in chief of
The Daily in 1969 and graduated in
history in 1971. "Newspaper editors
know instinctively and intuitively where

the line is drawn on what can be
printed."
"What journalists have to do
there would be the equivalent in
America of the editors of the New
York Times, The Wall Street Jour
nal and the Los Angeles Times
having to call the White House
every three months to see what
they could and could not print,"
he said.
Soviet citizens seem more will
ing to talk now than in the past,
said Barringer, who was The Dai
ly's editor in chief in 1971 and
graduated in English in 1972.
When she randomly interviewed
people on the streets about polit
ical events a few years ago, every
one she spoke to retold verbatim
what was printed in the local
papers, she said.
This year, she was surprised
that her "man-on-the-street"
stories yielded lengthy criticisms
of Soviet policy by almost every
one she met.
