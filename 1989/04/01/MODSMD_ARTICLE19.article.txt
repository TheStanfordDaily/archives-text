## House committee cites Wright Other allegations of ethical wrongdoing are still being reviewed 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
House Ethics Committee has
tentatively decided there is "rea
son to believe" that Speaker Jim
Wright violated House rules by
failing to report as gifts the
benefits he received from a busi
ness partner, a source familiar
with the investigation said late
yesterday.
The source, who spoke on con
dition of anonymity, declined to
say how many instances of failure
to report gifts had been identified
by the panel.
But the number could easily be
in the dozens, because several

benefits Wright received contin
ued over a period of years and
would have had to be reported on
each year's financial disclosure
form. Among the benefits under
scrutiny are his virtually free use
of a condominium in Texas, an
$18,000 salary for his wife Betty,
and use of a 1979 Cadillac.
CBS News reported yesterday
that the committee had found 30
instances of possible rules viola
tions by Wright.
"We think it's an absurd
report," said Mark Johnson,
Wright's press secretary, who met
with Wright about the CBS story

before commenting. "We have ab
solutely no information along
those lines," he said.
The committee, which resumes
deliberations today in what is ex
pected to be its final week before
issuing a report, is engaged in a
process not unlike that of a grand
jury.
Finding "reason to believe" that
rules have been violated would be
equivalent to an indictment of
Wright. The speaker would then
have a chance to defend himself
in a disciplinary hearing.
Wright reported his wife's em
ployment with Fort Worth

developer George Mallick on his
financial disclosure forms as
salary for her work. But the ethics
panel's outside counsel, Richard
Phalen, argued that the salary
amounted to a gift because Betty
Wright did little work in exchange
for it.
Wright, Mallick and their wives
jointly formed a small investment
company called "Mallightco" and
used it to make several invest
ments. Betty Wright first drew
her salary directly from Mallick's
development company and then
from the partnership between
1981 and 1984.
