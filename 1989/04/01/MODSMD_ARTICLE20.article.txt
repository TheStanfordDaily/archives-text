MIAMI (AP) — Two gunmen, apparently
Haitian soldiers, hijacked a twin-engine
aircraft carrying a missionary group from
Haiti to Fort Lauderdale yesterday but sur
rendered after diverting the plane to Miami,
the FBI said.
The gunmen, armed with a .38 caliber revol
ver and an assault rifle, threw the weapons
to the ground as they turned themselves in,
the FBI said. No one was hurt.
The hijackers were identified as Guillaume
Berlioze, 21, and Fahaed Milord, 30, both of
Port-au-Prince.

An FBI news release said Berlioze and
Milord were reportedly soldiers who brought
a .40 mm anti-tank shell aboard the plane.
Agent William Gavin said the motive of the
hijackers, who were not in uniform when they
seized the aircraft, was not known.
Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, Haiti's military pres
ident, appeared yesterday to have quieted the
sporadic acts of rebellion by officers and troop
units that began with a failed military coup
on April 2.
The hijackers were scheduled to appear in
federal court tomorrow, where they could face

charges of air piracy and illegal weapons pos
session, said FBI spokesman Paul Miller.
The Cessna 402, owned by Missionary Avi
ation Fellowship of Redlands, Calif., landed
at 2:30 p.m. at Miami International Airport.
A Fellowship spokeswoman, Donna Burns,
said the plane held four Haitians and three
Americans, plus the two gunmen and the pilot,
Duer Smedley.
"They boarded at Cap Haitien," said Arlene
Salac of the Federal Aviation Administration's
regional office in Atlanta. Cap Haitien is on
Haiti's North Coast.
