Soviets try to end Georgia unrest
MOSCOW (AP) — Troops fired in the air to
disperse a rally in Georgia yesterday, and the
Kremlin sent Foreign Minister Eduard Shevard
nadze to try to end a week of ethnic unrest in
his southern homeland that killed at least 18
people.
A general strike closed schools, mass transit
and some businesses in Tbilisi, the Georgian
capital of 1.2 million people 900 miles southeast
of Moscow, residents said.
The government has sent in troops and tanks
to quell ethnic strife and pro-independence move
ments in the mountainous Caucasus republic.
Justice Dept. opposes fairness law
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Depart
ment is recommending that President Bush veto
any legislation that would write into law the

fairness doctrine and require that broadcasters
air opposing views on controversial issues.
In a letter to Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., As
sistant Attorney General Thomas M. Boyd said
the doctrine, which the Federal Communications
Commission repealed in 1987, was outdated, hin
dered free expression and unduly discriminated
against broadcasters in favor of the print media.
Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, introduced a bill this year
that would make the doctrine law. The bill was
passed by the Energy and Commerce telecom
munications and finance subcommittee last week
and is to be considered by the full committee
today.
It is virtually identical to a measure passed by
Congress in 1987 but vetoed by then-President
Reagan.
Although Bush has not indicated his view on
the fairness doctrine since he took office, he said
on the campaign trail last year he was against
such a law.
