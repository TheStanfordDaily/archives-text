## COP blends competence, ideology 
### 
IT USED TO BE hard to take the
ASSU Council of Presidents
seriously. I mean, who knew who
they were? What they were doing?
Perhaps they sometimes could be
counted on to put well-lit, condom
dispensing change machines on the
tennis courts. But perhaps not.
This year, however, we have had a
vigorous team of public servants on
the COP. Sure, everyone knows that
they are liberal. Doggone liberal as a
matter of fact.
The COP's concern with the issues
of students of color is viewed with
apprehension by some very well
meaning people, because these people
suspect that this a priori ensures that
the concerns of "the rest of us dudes"
will be overlooked.
But the hyperactive folks at the COP
have not played the public service
game as a zero sum one. Rather, they
have incorporated both progressive
issues and unprecedented services as
part of their integrated vision of what
a harmonious, healthy and otherwise
hurt-free student life at Stanford could
be.
Our theory is that this enlightened
— albeit "'L'-word" — vision is what
provides them with the energy to
eschew resume packing and actually do
stuff. Lots of stuff.
Fuddy duddies have crankily charac
terized the gregarious COP's service
projects as "public relations" ploys
which "help no one," as in an April 6
letter to The Daily. These folks would
probably call anaesthesia during sur-

gery "politically motivated."
These armchair Archie Bunkers
allege that the Used Book Fair threat
ens the revered rebate that the
monopolistic Mother Bookstore so
generously offers. They also imply that
the hundreds of students who have
used the ASSU Course Consultants
and the 450 students who used the
low-cost ASSU Airport Shuttle didn't
really need these services.
If this is true, we shudder for our
nation's future because we've got a lot
of confused students running around.
With blind faith in bureaucratic
benevolence, the critics contend that
the students who took advantage of the
new ASSU Financial Aid Advocates
service, if left to their own devices,
would have been graciously greeted by
good-hearted, empathetic Financial
Aids officers.
The skeptics further believe that the
COP should have pursued more mean
ingful, people-oriented projects such as
the remodeling of the Boathouse (with
its huge constituency and lack of lake).
The nay-sayers notwithstanding, we
think that most students (particularly
those who have been around Stanford
for a while and have witnessed the

lethargy of previous student govern
ments) would laud the current COP's
projects with superlatives such as
"neato" and "awesome."
Unless of course, they are students
who have never wanted a fair price for
their used books, or enjoy dragging all
their luggage to the Oval and shelling
out $15 for a ride to the airport, or
like outrageously-priced designer school
supplies from the Bookstore, or are
dogmatically and masochistically fond
of high student-to-teaching assistant
ratios, or believe that adequate ethnic
studies consists of a trip of Frankie,
Johnnie and Luigi's.
To respectfully correct one of our
fallen heroes, a Bushy-browed fellow
quietly clerking somewhere in Boston
now, the election is about both ideology
and competence. The People's Platform
COP, with the conviction that comes
from devotion to progressive ideals,
have set a new standard of responsive
ness and excel'ence in 3tudent govern
ment. You may or may not find the
zeal a bit overwhelming from time to
time. But you aren't likely to find
anybody zealous enough to do the job
as well.
