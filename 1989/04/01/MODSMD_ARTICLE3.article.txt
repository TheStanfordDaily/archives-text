### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
John Tower, the former U.S.
senator who was rejected as sec
retary of defense after allegations
of womanizing and heavy drink
ing, will most likely become a full
time senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution, sources have told The
Daily.
According to documents ob
tained by The Daily, Hoover In
stitution Director W. Glenn
Campbell approached Tower to of
fer him the job shortly after the
U.S. Senate rejected Tower from
the position of secretary of de
fense last month.
In a letter given to The Daily
by a source close to the director,

Campbell wrote to Tower, "A man
of your high stature and visibility
can only lend credibility and pres
tige to Hoover."
"We would love to have you on
board as senior fellow," Campbell
wrote. "As we had discussed, a
spacious office with a bar can be
arranged."
Campbell refused to comment
on the possible Tower appoint
ment, although he would not deny
he wrote the letter.
Tower has been attracted by the
offer and is likely to take the job,
one Washington source very close
to Tower said.
"John [Tower] has revealed
everything to me, and he has said
that he is very willing to take the
job sometime early this summer,"

the source said in a phone inter
view from her Washington pent
house apartment yesterday.
According to other documents
obtained by The Daily, Tower
would pull in a hefty saJary if he
accepts the position. Some
$200,000 per year is being set
aside for his appointment, a salary
well above the $125,000 Campbell
makes himself.
Foes of Hoover told The Daily
that the Tower appointment was
unacceptable. "I thought the ap
pointment of [former Attorney
General Edwin] Meese was bad
enough, but the Tower appoint
ment is ludicrous," Political Sci
ence Prof. John Manley said.
