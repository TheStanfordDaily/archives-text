Afro-Americans are
integral to North
American history
I've noticed the "Ethnic Studies"
poster of the ASSU Committee on
Democracy in Education and the Coun
cil of Presidents, under which they
include Afro-American Studies.
From the intellectual perspective of
Afro-American studies, as I see it, such
studies are as central a component of
the study of North American history
as are Euro-American Studies.
Afro-Americans are no more "ethnic"
than are Euro-Americans.
Will the ASSU please be good
enough never to list any Afro-American
courses that I teach under their "Eth
nic Studies" label?

We are writing in response to the
March 9 review of the movie "Skin
Deep." The editing of the picture for
the review was sexist and degrading,
as was some of the language in the
review itself.
Cutting the women's legs from their
bodies and identifying them by their
limbs blatantly objectifies them. The
women's legß, not their names or their
faces, become their identities.
This body part fixation becomes a
theme in the review, since the writer
expresses such disappointment in the
"reasonable boob shots — of which
females I can't remember, so I guess
they weren't that good."

All the negative manifestations of
this sort of degradation and sexism
should be obvious; it is unfortunate
that they must be pointed out time
and time again.

Racism results from
individual action,
not from groups'
In her April 4 column, Lyzette Settle
writes, "Let us not blame groups for
statements made by individuals."
Unfortunately, blaming individuals
for the actions of other individuals is
precisely what Settle advocates. What
else can one make of her phrase, refer
ring to racial minorities dealing with
Caucasians, "Will I be able to trust
this person or will he or she turn out
to be just as racist and malignant as
those I have met in the past?"
This implies that it can be reason
able to question a person's character,
knowing nothing of him save his skin
color.
When an individual perpetrates an
act of injustice against another individ
ual, it is simply that, no more and no
less. That race may be involved is in
fact irrelevant, except as an irrational
fixation of the racist.
Hence it is not reasonable for a
member of a racial minority (or
minority), when discriminated against,
to bring "to the forefront of his or her
mind" "this history of racist actions."
These actions were not perpetrated
against him or her — the feet that the
same irrational idea was the cause is
not morally significant.
