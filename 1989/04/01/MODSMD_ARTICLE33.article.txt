## An experiment in equalization Chemists concoct new course 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
Take some information on the latest
progress in the field of chemistry. Put
it in a test tube. Add some scientific
rigor, a little physical chemistry and
a dash of organic chemistry.
Fizz. Pop. Poof.
The result of this concoction is
Chemistry 32, an experimental course
that could be offered here as early as
next fall. Proposed by Chemistry
Profs. Richard Zare and James Coll
man, the course will not be a hybrid
of the two exisiting introductory
chemistry courses, Chemistry 31
(Chemical Principles) and Chemistry
33 (Structure and Reactivity).
Instead, Zare said, it will explore
the "frontiers" of current chemical re
search while involving a significant
amount of technical work.

"This (course) will not teach stu
dents how to do better in 33," Zare
said. "Nor will it be entertainment.
The purpose is to turn people on to
the excitement of the sense of dis
covery in chemistry."
Stanford produces a very small
number of graduates in the pure
sciences, Collman said, adding that he
thinks a course like Chem 32 might
provide the impetus for some students
to pursue a chemistry mtgor early in
their undergraduate career.
Because dull or repetitive classes
discourage many potential science
majors in their freshman year, Coil
man said the Chemistry Department
will encourage entering freshmen who
scored a 4 or 5 on the Advanced Place
ment chemistry exam, did well in high
school math and other science courses,
and are interested in majoring in
chemistry to enroll in Chem 32.

These students may
skip Chem 31 because
the University gener
ally considers the AP
test its equivalent.
But, Chem 33 is not
offered in the fall, so
students with AP
credit in chemistry
must either wait until
winter quarter to take
chemistry or take
Chem 31 and rehash
the material learned in
high school.
AP students who opt
to take Chem 31 are
often bored and wreck
the curve, Zare said.
Zare added that
Chem 32 would pro
vide a useful chemistry
class for AP students
in the fall and also
equalize the back
ground of the students
in 31.
Students without a
chemistry background
are often frustrated
and discouraged by the
students with AP
credit who elect to take

Chem 31, he said.
However, the proposal has met with
some opposition. Some professors are
worried that taking the more prepared
students out of Chemistry 31 will
make the course less interesting be
cause they often provide motivation
and enthusiasm for their fellow stu
dents, Zare explained.
But, the better students are often
bored in 31, he said, adding that the
Physics and Math departments have
successfully added more in-depth in
troductory classes to accommodate
highly talented and motivated stu
dents.
According to Collman, another dis
advantage of the new course is the
strain it would place on the already
small number of faculty in the
Chemistry Department.
"Our interests are altruistic," he
said, "but many of the professors are
busy."
Collman and Zare have offered to
co-teach the class, which Collman said
is an unusual situation in chemistry.
Zare explained that because he spe
cializes in physical chemistry and Col
lman focuses on organic chemistry,
their teachings would complement
each other.
Some of the topics the course would
emphasize are superconductivity,
chemical reactions and chemical struc
ture on a very small scale, and
symmetry and group theory, all of
which are currently hot topics in
chemistry, Zare said.
The proposal for Chem 32 also in
cludes a lab which would meet on
Saturday mornings, a time Collman
said he feels confident all students
enrolled would be able to meet. But,
he added, the lab might not come
about for a year or two.
He and Zare plan to encourage 50
students to enroll if Chem 32 is ap
proved, Collman said, adding that
every year there are between 75 and
100 students who meet the class's
qualifications.
The Chemistry Department will
consider implementing the course at
a faculty meeting at the end of this
week.
