# Classics professor has found teaching an admirable career
## 
### Karina Bahrin 
Antony Raubitschek grew up in Vienna,
Austria, aspiring to be a mathematician.
Despite the childhood dream, the former
math aficionado is now a professor
emeritus in the Classics Department.
Why the drastic change? "That is sad
story," Raubitschek says. "When I was a
young boy, my father had a friend who was
a brilliant mathematician. One day, he told
my father, 'Tony is too dumb to study
math,' and suggested I do the classics in
stead."
After a slight pause, Raubitschek leans
forward as if about to tell a secret. "You
know what? My father was right," he
whispers.
Raubitschek left Vienna in 1938 and held
a post at Princeton University before com
ing to Stanford in the 19605. In comparing
the two universities, his preference for
Stanford becomes apparent.

The atmosphere at Stanford is more
libera] and open than at Princeton and the
student body is more diverse, Raubitschek
says. One Stanford student whom he par
ticularly remembers was the Crown Prince
of Belgium.
Regardless of who he or she may be,
Raubitschek stresses that no student should
be afraid of approaching professors, even
distinguished professors emeriti. They are
really just normal human beings, he says.
"You'll be surprised."
"Some of us are a little shy," he contin
ues, with a slight twinkle in his eye. "Ac
tually, it's more that we're afraid of press
ing the matter that we are available. We
don't want to make the students uncom
fortable by throwing ourselves at them."
Raubitschek says he holds teaching in
high regard and encourages the younger
generation to consider it as a career. "To
educate a big shot is far more important
than being one of them," he says.
