## Baseball drops third straight to Sun Devils, 12-6 
### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
TEMPE, Ariz. — A team that
swings the bat like No. 5 Arizona
State doesn't need much help to
score runs.
Yesterday, the Cardinal pitch
ing staff handed them 10 free
passes, and five of those walks
turned into Sun Devil runs as
ASU completed a three-game
sweep with a 12-6 victory at Pack
ard Stadium in Tempe, Ariz.

Sun Devils 12, Cardinal 6

"We got a one-run lead and then
we gave them too much. We did
that all weekend," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said.
The Cardinal slipped to 17-21,
5-13 in Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division play. ASU
moved to 33-10 and 12-4 in the
Six-Pac, tied for the league lead
with in-state rival Arizona.
Stanford starter Steve Worrell
took a 4-1 lead into the bottom
of the fifth, but after a leadoff
walk, a sacrifice bunt and an RBI
double, Worrell gave way to junior
Mark Carper.
"Steve pitched well. He pitched
more, didn't just throw the ball.
I think he was up around 75 or
80 pitches. He was just tired so
we got him (out of the game),"
Marquess said.
Carper inherited a 2-0 count on
pre-season All-America second
baseman Kevin Higgins and
walked him to put men on first
and second. First baseman Steve
Willis then ripped a double down

the left fielu line for 2 RBI and
a 4-4 tie. After a passed ball
moved Willis to third and a walk
to freshman Mike Kelly, Brian
Keyser — who started Sunday's
game — relieved Carper.
Keyser promptly picked Kelly
off first, but first baseman David
McCarty threw late to Troy Paul
sen at second, who dropped the
ball for an error. Dan Rumsey
was intentionally walked to load
the bases, and Keyser got a force
out at home. After going 3-0 to
Devil catcher Dave Robson,
Keyser struck him out on a 3-2
curveball to end the inning.
The Devils got a run in the
sixth, but Cardinal designated hit
ter Tim Griffin took matters into
his own hands in the top of the
seventh. Griffin — who already
had a two-run homer deep to cen
ter in the fifth — sent another
Rusty Kilgo offering over Packard
Stadium's version of the Green
Monster in dead center field. This
two-out, two-run blast put Stan
ford back on top 6-5.
"They were both fastballs.
[Kilgo's] fastball is not very good
at all," Griffin said.
"I never think they're going out
to center. At first I thought [the
first one] was going out, but then
it started going at the wall. Then
I thought it would go to the left
of it," Griffin added.
The first one may have gone
just to the left of the mock mon
ster, but there was no doubt on
the second. Asked if he'd ever hit
one farther, Griffin said, "Maybe
in batting practice."
That was all the Cardinal would
get in the inning, but a David
Holbrook single did send Rusty
Kilgo — who pitched a complete

game victory against the Cardinal
at Sunken Diamond in March —
to the showers.
ASU made the 6-5 lead short
lived. With the help of two singles,
the Devils put up a five spot in
the bottom of the seventh to ice
the game. They added two more
in the eighth for the 12-6 final.
The third loss in as many days
left Marquess hedging his bets as
the Cardinal enters a critical
three-game set at USC this week
end.
"We can't even be thinking
sweep. We have to play well so
we can win a game. Except for a
couple mistakes, we've played
good defense on the whole. The
other things we haven't put to
gether," Marquess said.
Card notes
Cardinal pitching coach Tom Dun
ton, known affectionately as "the
Colonel," was booted from the game
in the first inning after he, and many
Cardinal players, disputed a strike call
on a 3-1 pitch to Paul Carey. This
came after a strike call on a 3-0 pitch
to Roger Burnett initially got Dun
ton's dander up. "The umpire missed
a couple pitches early on. We told him
we thought they were strikes," Mar
quess said.
