# Making Rush more equitable
## Larger frat houses excluded 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
In an effort to strengthen the
fraternal system as a whole,
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano announced yesterday a
new plan to "equalize Rush" by
limiting Rush to houses which
traditionally have had problems
filling their quotas.
On Jan. 25, Pisano and Row
Adviser Diana Conklin announced
that six of the 11 housed frater
nities at Stanford which had not
consistently met their quotas over
the past three years might lose
their houses if those quotas were
not met. The Alpha Delta Phi fra
ternity was the first fraternity on
the list to lose its house this
spring.
The fraternities with no prob
lems filling quotas in the past will
be excluded from Rush this year

in hopes that potential pledges will
then be forced to join the houses
with quota problems, according to
Pisano.
By only allowing those houses
with quota problems to have rush
this year, Residential Education
officials hope those houses will fill,
thereby prolonging their exis
tence.
"After long deliberation and
careful examination of the history
of fraternal life at Stanford, we
have decided Residential Educa
tion is not prepared to take over
the social functions that frater
nitites play at this University,"
said Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons. "As a result, we
want to strengthen fraternal life
at Stanford."
Interfraternity Council Presi
dent Chris Erlin said he was "dis
appointed" that five fraternities
would be excluded from Rush, but

said he supported the University's
overall plans to strengthen and
prolong the existence of fraternal
housing.
In addition, Pisano reversed a
previous decision about Alpha
Delts. They may now participate
in Rush, and if they have suffi
ciently interested pledges, their
house will be returned to them in
the fall.
The Delta Upsilon and Zeta Psi
fraternities will be also allowed
to conduct Rush activities this
year. These groups were the last
two fraternities to lose their
houses for disciplinary problems.
"We want to give everybody a
chance to wipe the slate clean,"
Pisano said.
If unhoused fraternities have
the money and are interested in
acquiring university housing, the
