# Execution, or lack thereof, is source of Card nine woes
## 
### 
It's just too easy to give up on the
Stanford baseball team.
After being swept by Arizona State
this weekend, the Cardinal is mired in
fifth place in the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division with a 5-13 record.
With that in mind, the Cardinal is a
bigger target for criticism than the Exxon
Supertanker Driving School.
Those forms of criticism usually come
in comparison to the 1988 Stanford base
ball team, which became only the second
squad ever to repeat as NCAA College
World Series Champions. Simply stated,
after two years of winning, one had to
expect a dropoff — maybe not one as
severe as this year's — but a dropoff
nonetheless.
I don't buy it.
It's too easy to pick on Stanford base
ball '89. It's also to easy to do so by
attributing this year's misfortune simply
to the loss of players who left after '88.
In fact, the teams have a lot of
similarities, and I'm not sure that the
1989 team is that much worse than the
1988ers.
First, consider the pitching. Stanford

lost only one pitcher of significance from
last year, Lee Plemel, who graduated and
signed with the St. Louis Cardinals' or
ganization. Plemel ranks as one of Stan
ford's all-time greats. He's third all-time
in Stanford history in wins (34) and sec
ond in strikeouts (326).
Nevertheless, Plemel didn't really get
it going in 1988 until playoff time. Six
weeks before becoming the CWS Most
Valuable Player, Plemel had been
demoted to the bullpen. At a crucial time
in the 1988 season, the Cardinal was
getting by with just two effective starting

pitchers — Mike Mussina and Stan Spen
cer.
This year, Plemel is gone, Spencer has
been spotty and Mussina is, for the mo
ment, injured. But Steve Chitren is
having what may turn out to be an All-
America year, providing some good starts
in between relief apperances, and Stan
ford usually gets at least one other strong
starting outing per weekend from among
Spencer, Brian Keyser, Scott Weiss and
Steve Worrell.
It's easy to point to the pitching, but
when Mussina returns and Spencer gets
back in the groove, the pitching will ac
tually be as good as, if not better than,
last year's.
Look at the hitting. Stanford knew
from the start of the season there would
be a power shortage. Gone to the profes
sionals were Ed Sprague (22 homers),
Ron Witmeyer (12) and Doug Robbins
(11).
But still remaining in '89 are the potent
bats of Frank Carey, Paul Carey, Troy
Paulsen and Tim Griffin, among others.
Furthermore, the infusion of freshmen
aluminum (Roger Burnett, Steve

Solomon, David McCarty) has been much
more profound than it was in '88.
And let's face it, hitting hasn't been
the key to Stanford's success for a while.
It had lost Ruben Amaro, Toi Cook and
David Esquer from the 1987 champions.
The 1988 Cardinal was regarded as a
light-hitting team itself. It was just
fourth in the Six-Pac in batting average.
And over the first four games of the
1988 CWS, Stanford batted just .200.
It's easy to point to the hitting, but
that doesn't explain the losing either.
Now, the fielding. There have been
some bad stories. Troy Paulsen makes
15 errors in his first 16 games. Roger
Burnett and Paul Carey make errors in
extra innings Sunday to give ASU the
unearned runs needed to first tie, then
win the game.
It's possible that if Stanford could have
cut its errors in half, it would have a
great record.
But again, let's look at 1988. The Car
dinal played Sprague at third base, where
his fielding average (.877) almost dipped
below his slugging percentage (.658).
Sprague and Paulsen combined for four

errors in the sixth inning in the team's
second game of the 1988 CWS to hand
the game to Fullerton State and put the
Cardinal on the brink of elimination.
It's easy to point to the fielding, but
that has also been something Stanford
has had to overcome in the past.
So if it's not the pitching, hitting or
fielding, what is it?
There is something that seems different
about the 1989 Cardinal baseball team.
For example, a high pop foul lands un
touched behind home plate. High pop
fouls never land behind home plate. On
another play, a throw sails well over the
cutoff man, and the runner takes an
extra base.
These mistakes happened in 1988, but
seemingly, not as often.
I'm not questioning Stanford's heart.
But I am questioning Stanford's concen
tration, its execution. And though I don't
doubt that those questions have been on
the mind of some players, maybe it's
time for them to question themselves
some more.
It would just be too easy for them not
to.
