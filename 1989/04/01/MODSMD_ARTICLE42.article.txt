# Struggling netters to face No. 2-ranked Cal
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Both the Stanford and Califor
nia men's tennis teams will be
trying to put last weekend behind
them when they meet today at
California's Hellman Tennis Com
plex.
The Bears, ranked second in
the country, are coming off a
rough road trip in Los Angeles.
California fell 5-4 to lOth-ranked
USC on Friday in a match the
Bears had ample opportunity to
win, and then struggled against
the smog and UCLA Saturday
before falling 6-3 to the No. 1
Bruins.
The above probably sounds
quite familiar to the Cardinal
players, who also had their fair
share of problems in L.A. In fact,
the similarities between the two
teams don't end there. Both have
seen injuries to key players throw
singles and doubles lineups out
of whack, and while both schools
now have all their players back,
the question remains as to just
how several key players will re
spond to playing at less than full
strength.
"Cal's had a lot of trouble with
injuries," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said last week.
The Bears' Woody Hunt, who
usually plays No. 1 singles and is
ranked 13th in the country, has
been the team's most notable
casualty. Hunt missed several
matches in March with a pinched
nerve (including a 5-1 Cal loss to
Arizona). While he has since re
turned to the lineup, he has not
returned to his pre-injury form.
He dropped both his matches in
L.A., falling 7-5, 6-1 to USC's

Byron Black before coming alive
against UCLA's Brian Garrow in
a 7-6, 7-6 loss.
Hunt will face Stanford's Jeff
Tarango, who has also been
recovering from an injury (his
wrist) andhhpa p not played up to
par until his Saturday win over
Black.
California Coach Scott McCain
is hoping his team's injury prob
lems are over. "Right now, we
don't have anyone who should not
be able to play," McCain said,
"[but] Woody is not quite 100 per
cent and Carl [Chang] is not quite
100 percent.
Even with their troubles, the
Bears have managed to hold on
to their No. 2 national ranking,
and for one three-week stretch
(following their victory in the Na
tional Indoor Tournament,) the
Bears were ranked No. 1. For
McCain and his players, it's been
a heck of a season already.
