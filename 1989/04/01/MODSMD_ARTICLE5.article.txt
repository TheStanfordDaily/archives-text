# Rebellious bikers apprehended
## 
### Mark Klein 
Nine mountain bikers fought
the law yesterday. And as the
classic rock song says, the law
won.
Protesting the recent Univer
sity enforcement of a ban
prohibiting bikers from the
Stanford Foothills, the moun
tain bikers went in force to chal
lenge the new rule — and the
"Lone Ranger" recently sta
tioned to patrol the foothills.
With the help 'of his speedy
horse Silver, though, Public

Safety Officer Doug Williams
corralled the trespassing bikers
and fined them each $63.29.
"This is the eighth time this
past week that I have been
fined," according to junior
Roman Coast. Coast added that
the tickets have not lessened his
resolve in the least. "I kind of
take my inspiration from the
pro-life twins — Janice and
Joyce Keen."
Williams said yesterday's
biking violations represented
only nine of 48 tickets he has
issued since last Tuesday. In ad

dition to 24 other bike ban vi
olations, Williams has cited 10
students for littering, four stu
dents for hiking in restricted av
alanche areas and one squirrel
for indecent exposure of its nuts.
"No one's beaten me yet,"
Williams said.
Junior Jim Corbett said:
"This reminds me of the Brady
Bunch episode where Greg —
wait, actually I think it was
Leave it to Beaver where Wally
and Eddie stand up to Ward and
— actually this doesn't remind
me of much at all."


A pack of five mountaln-blklng rebels with a cause scales the fence at the Junction of Junlpero
Serra and Campus Drive In dally defiance of the new Foothills law.
