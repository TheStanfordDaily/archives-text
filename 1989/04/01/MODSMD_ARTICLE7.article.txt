# Plan to fill Lake Lag proceeds swimmingly
## 
### Rose Enfeld Staff writer 
Reversing a decision made earlier this
month, University officials yesterday decided
to artificially fill Lake Lagunita.
According to Marilyn Mizuumi, who over
sees campus water use, the decision will mean
more sailing and windsurfing classes and pro
vide students with a "pleasant environment
in which to tan."
The University's initial decision to leave
Lake Lag completely empty was a result of
this year's drought and stringent water re

strictions placed upon the area by the San
Francisco Water District. The lake is or
dinarily filled by rain water and runoff from
nearby lakes and streams.
Water district officials originally demanded
$75,000 in fines to allow Stanford to fill the
lake. However, a deluge of phone calls from
concerned sunbathers and worried wind
surfers convinced them to lower the fee to
only $50,000.
According to Chief Financial Officer James
Okane, the University had refused to pay any
fee at all, in part because of budget limitations.
However, an extra $50,000 was discovered in

the undergraduate housing fund, according to
Okane.
"That was a surprise," Okane said of the
find. "We don't look at that fund very often,
and since the University has no plans to build
additional housing in the near future, we
figured, 'What the heck — let's use it for the
sailors.'"
As a result of this unexpected development,
the Athletic Department plans to offer at least
eight additional windsurfing sections and six
new sailing sections. Students wishing to sign
up for these courses should contact the de
partment at 324-8137. Ask for Burke.
