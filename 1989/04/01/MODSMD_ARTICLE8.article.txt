## 
### Gumby Lachenauer Staff writer 
To ensure that the Undergrad
uate Committee on Minority Is
sues gave an accurate report on
minority life here, a new commit
tee commissioned yesterday by
University President Donald Ken
nedy will evaluate UCMI's report
and the process behind it.
Headed by Psychology Prof.
Philip Zimbardo, the Committee
to Evaluate Important Stanford
Minority Issues Reports, CEIS
MIR, will submit a 35-page ap
praisal of the 244-page UCMI
report to Kennedy later this quar
ter.
Released last week, the hefty
UCMI report makes more than
25 specific recommendations on

how to improve minority life at
Stanford.
Throughout this quarter, CEIS
MIR will hold weekly meetings to
discuss and elaborate on the rec
ommendations in the UCMI
report before issuing its own of
ficial statement. While CEISMIR
is not working under the pressure
of a set University deadline, Zim
bardo said he is confident that his
group will quickly respond to the
task.
"We're not going to get lost in
a black hole of bureaucracy like
some committees do. We'll ham
mer through the report and have
our appraisal on Don's desk by
May at the latest," Zimbardo said.
Kennedy, who announced his
decision to form CEISMIR at a
press conference yesterday, said

he is eagerly awaiting the new
committee's findingß.
"It's time to tackle the UCMI
report head on. I, more than
anyone else, have a vested interest
in understanding each and every
aspect of both reports," he said.
Although CEISMIR will most
likely not finish its analysis until
late May, Kennedy stressed that
students should read the report
before leaving Stanford for sum
mer break.
"CEISMIR's report might not
go public until finals week, but
that doesn't matter. Students
need to get their nose out of the
books — in order to relieve finals
week stress — and come to terms
with CEISMIR's important find
ings," he said.
