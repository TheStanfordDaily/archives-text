# Women's swim team captures national title
## Sports Monday 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. — "Florida is
the favorite by a long way. They ought
to dominate the meet. If we swim well
and everybody else does well, we'll be
about third." — Stanford women's swim
ming Coach Richard Quick speaking
about the NCAA Championships in the
January Swimming World magazine col
lege preview issue.
"I think Florida should run away with

it." — Quick, Feb. 25, after the Cardinal
won the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onship.
"I think the rest of us are in a scramble
for second." — Quick, March 15, at the
press conference the day before the NCAA
Championships.
"Stanford 610V2, Texas 547, Florida
536." — Final results, 1989 NCAA Wom
en's Swimming and Diving Champion
ships.
Apparently Quick was wrong. But if
he's eating his words after coaching the

Cardinal to its first NCAA women's
swimming title since 1983, they must be
the best words he's tasted in quite some
time.
In a great display of depth, Stanford
upset Florida, the overwhelming favorite,
and five-time defending national cham
pion Texas. Despite having only two in
dividual champions — the Gators and
Lady Longhorns combined to win 12 of
the 21 events — Stanford swam away
from the competition on the second day
and clinched the Farm's first NCAA title

in the 1988-89 school year in the In
dianapolis Natatorium March 18.
The title was the sixth in a row for
Quick, who was named the 1989 Coach
of the Year. Quick coached at Texas the
past six years before coming to Stanford
to replace the retired George Haines in
August, 1988.
"When I first came to Stanford, I didn't
think we had a chance to win the NCAA
Championship," Quick said. "But that's
because I didn't know the character of
this team.

"I'm not sure we're the best swimmers
here, but I'm damn sure we're the best
team, in the truest sense of the word. . . .
I've been lucky in my career to have
several teams with that type of character
and caring for one another, but none
more than this Stanford team."
The meet began slowly for the Cardi
nal, in third place after the first day.
Stanford took second in the 200-yard
medley relay and third in the 800 free-
style relay that day.
But Stanford set the tone for
what was to follow by recording
several high finishes. Barb Metz
took sixth in the 500 freestyle;
Michelle Griglione, Jill Johnson
and Susannah Miller placed sec
ond, fourth and seventh in the
200 individual medley; Aimee Ber
zins and Jenna Johnson went fifth
and sixth in the 50 freestyle; and
Katie Connors took eighth in the
one-meter diving.
Sports Illustrated called Stan
ford's performance "winning ug
ly," but the first word in that
phrase clearly means more than
the second.
Stanford continued to swim
well in the second day's prelimi
naries, then went crazy the second
night. After a third-place finish
in the 200 freestyle relay,
Griglione won the 400 IM by de
feating Georgia freshman Erika
Hansen, a 1988 U.S. Olympian in
that event. Cardinal freshman
Karen Kraemer placed fifth with
a lifetime-best time.
Stanford also won the next
event, the 100 butterfly, as senior
Jenna Johnson won the sixth
NCAA individual title of her
career. Johnson touched out Fur
man's Angel Myers (the winner
of the event at the Olympic Trials
last summer) and Florida's Dara
Torres (the defending NCAA
champ). Stanford's Suzy Buck

ovich placed sixth.
"It feels wonderful," Johnson
said after the win, her first title
since her sophomore year. "I
haven't won in so long. ... It is
also my last year, and that makes
it special."
Florida placed six swimmers in
the final eight in the next event,
the 200 freestyle, but a ninth
place finish by Berzins and a 12th
by Metz kept the Cardinal from
falling too far.
Jill Johnson then tied for sec
ond and Susan Lenth tied for
fourth in the 200 breaststroke,
and with freshmen Susan
Johnson and J.T. Toten also
scoring, the Cardinal passed
Florida for good even though a
Gator, Stephanie Zunich, won the
race.
The 100 backstroke which im
mediately followed was much the
same. Florida's Kristen Linehan
won, but Stanford's Michelle
Donahue and Dede Trimble fol
lowed her for second and third,
and Miller took ninth. Stanford
was now in the lead, something
that would not change for the rest
of the meet.
Connors added a fourth in the
three-meter diving and Donahue,
Jill Johnson, Jenna Johnson and
Berzins took second in the 400
medley relay to complete the day.
"From a team-effort standpoint,
I've never had a better team effort
than Stanford had tonight,"

Quick said that night. "I've obvi
ously had some great efforts from
Texas but I've never had a better
one. ... I don't think I'd put my
money on Florida.
After another fine showing in
the morning preliminaries, the
Cardinal had the meet just about
clinched going into the final night.
But instead of letting up, Stanford
kept pouring it on to run away
from the field.
Metz began with a fourth-place
finish in the 1650 freestyle.
Trimble, Donahue and Miller then
went three-four-five in the 200
backstroke and Jenna Johnson
and Berzins grabbed second and
fourth, respectively, in the 100
freestyle.
Jill Johnson took second and
Lenth took eighth in the 200
breaststroke, Griglione placed sec
ond in the 200 butterfly and Con
nors tied for sixth in the platform
diving, leaving only a battle for
second in the team standings.
Connors, who made the final
eight in all three diving events,
was elated after the team victory.
"I was very happy," she said.
"We've been working really
hard. . .. My expectations were to
final; then, in the finals, I was
trying to get eights or threes
(judged on a scale from one to
10) — go all out. That's what I
did."
Florida needed to win the final
event, the 400 freestyle relay, to

take second away from Texas, but
the Lady Longhorns won going
away, shattering the American
record by 1.41 seconds.
"I'd much rather have a real
victory than a moral victory,"
Texas Coach Mark Schubert said,
"but I'll take it. Our goal was to
come to the meet and be the most
improved team ... and I think
we've done that.... I think we
all swam as well as we could."
Individually, Clemson's Mitzi
Kremer was the high-point swim
mer at 56 points, Griglione was
second at 54, Jenna Johnson tied
for fourth at 50, and Jill Johnson
was sixth at 48 Vfe.
Berzins, one of five seniors com
peting in Indianapolis, said, "This
is by far the best meet of my
life. . . . It's kind of how you want
things to end up."
Card note
The highlight of the trip, other than
winning the national championship,
was staying in the Embassy Suites,
where all the Indiana Pacers' oppo
nents stayed, including Michael J and
the Chicago Bulls.
After Griglione tried unsuccessfully
to get Jordan's autograph before he
got on the team bus (she did get one
the next morning), senior Dana An
derson pulled a pair of Air Jordans
out of her bag. She induced Jordan
to come to the front of the bus and
got him to autograph a shoe, "To
Dana, Michael Jordan."
