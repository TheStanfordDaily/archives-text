INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. — "Florida is
the favorite by a long way. They ought
to dominate the meet. If we swim well
and everybody else does well, we'll be
about third." — Stanford women's swim
ming Coach Richard Quick speaking
about the NCAA Championships in the
January Swimming World magazine col
lege preview issue.
"I think Florida should run away with

it." — Quick, Feb. 25, after the Cardinal
won the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onship.
"I think the rest of us are in a scramble
for second." — Quick, March 15, at the
press conference the day before the NCAA
Championships.
"Stanford 610V2, Texas 547, Florida
536." — Final results, 1989 NCAA Wom
en's Swimming and Diving Champion
ships.
Apparently Quick was wrong. But if
he's eating his words after coaching the

Cardinal to its first NCAA women's
swimming title since 1983, they must be

In a great display of depth, Stanford
upset Florida, the overwhelming favorite,
and five-time defending national cham
pion Texas. Despite having only two in
dividual champions — the Gators and
Lady Longhorns combined to win 12 of
the 21 events — Stanford swam away
from the competition on the second day
and clinched the Farm's first NCAA title

in the 1988-89 school year in the In
dianapolis Natatorium March 18.
The title was the sixth in a row for
Quick, who was named the 1989 Coach
of the Year. Quick coached at Texas the
past six years before coming to Stanford
to replace the retired George Haines in
August, 1988.
"When I first came to Stanford, I didn't
think we had a chance to win the NCAA
Championship," Quick said. "But that's
because I didn't know the character of
this team.

"I'm not sure we're the best swimmers
here, but I'm damn sure we're the best
team, in the truest sense of the word. . . .
I've been lucky in my career to have
several teams with that type of character
and caring for one another, but none
more than this Stanford team."
The meet began slowly for the Cardi
nal, in third place after the first day.
Stanford took second in the 200-yard
medley relay and third in the 800 free-
