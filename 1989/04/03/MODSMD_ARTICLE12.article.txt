## Gorbachev arrives in Havana 
### 
HAVANA (AP) - Soviet Pres
ident Mikhail Gorbachev received
a warm welcome yesterday as he
arrived in Cuba for talks with
President Fidel Castro, who has
criticized the Soviet leader's new
pragmatic brand of communism.
Castro, wearing the green
fatigue uniform that has been his
trademark for three decades,
walked onto the rain-soaked tar
mac after Gorbachev's Ilyushin 62
jetliner landed and threw his arms
around the Soviet leader.
It was the third meeting of the
communist chieftains but Gorba
chev's first visit to Cuba, the is
land nation that for nearly 30
years has stood as a symbol of
Soviet influence 90 miles off the
Florida coast.
Castro kissed Gorbachev's wife,
Raisa, on both cheeks before es
corting Gorbachev on a review of
the presidential honor guard.
Hundreds of thousands of
Cubans mustered by local neigh
borhood committees packed the
arrival area at Jose Marti Inter
national Airport and lined a 10-
mile route through downtown
Havana to the official guest house
where Gorbachev will stay during
his four-day visit.
"Everything is clear in our
friendship, in our hearts, in our
soul, in our faces," Gorbachev said
in a brief comment to Prensa
Latina, the Cuban news agency,

upon his arrival at the guest
house.
"Now the only thing left is to
talk, and we do have something
to talk about," he said.
Formal talks between the Soviet
and Cuban leaders are to begin
Today.
Gorbachev and Castro rode to
the capital standing side by side
in an open, Soviet-built parade
car. They waved to the cheering,

flag-waving crowd stacked several
deep on both sides of the road.
Although Castro is known for
his ability to turn out thousands
of people in this city of 2 million,
the welcome for Gorbachev ap
peared genuinely warm.
Official media in both countries
have papered over ideological dif
ferences to stress the closeness of
Cuban-Soviet relations.

But the contrast between
Castro's doctrinaire Marxism and
Gorbachev's new-style openness
and determination to modernize
the Soviet economy is evident just
below the surface.
"Cuba needs perestroika and
glasnost," one female church-goer
said yesterday when asked what
she thought of Gorbachev's visit.
"God has put Gorbachev in the
world, and we are grateful."
