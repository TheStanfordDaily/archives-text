PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)
— The government said it foiled
an attempt by rebel army officers
yesterday to overthrow Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril. U.S. officials said
loyal soldiers apparently rescued
Avril as he was being driven away
to be deported.
A government communique
read over state-run television said
"certain officers besieged" the
presidential palace "and at
tempted to overthrow the govern
ment."
Earlier, sources in Haiti said
four military officers had ousted
Avril, who seized power six
months ago in the second coup in
this Caribbean country in less
than a year.
The communique did not ex
plain how the plot was suppressed
but said, "Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril
is in control of the situation and
guarantees peace in the streets
and the security of life and prop
erty."
It said he would address the
nation on television later.
U.S. Embassy spokeswoman
Susan Clyde said reports indi
cated the coup attempt occurred
about 4 or 5 a.m. and that Avril
was detained for a time.
"But it appears that when he
was being taken to the airport to
be deported . .. members of the
presidential guard arrived at the
airport and escorted him back to
the palace to be president again,"
she said in a telephone interview
from Port-au-Prince.
"Our last report is that he is
at the palace and is in charge

again," she said, adding that ' •
attempted coup was "totally
bloodless."
Later, Radio Liberte quoted in
unidentified soldier as saying one
of Avril's four sons was being held
hostage. It also reported the sol
dier said Port-au-Prince would b«
"set on fire" unless the govern
ment released one of the alleged
coup leaders identified by the sol
dier as Lt. Col. Himmler Rebu,
commander of the Leopards ba!
talion commando unit. No addi
tional information was givrn
about the purported hostage.
Initial reports had said th<
army commander, Maj. Gen.
Herard Abraham, was among tin
coup leaders but later accoun'.
said that was not correct and th<
plot collapsed when Abrahan
refused the rebels' offer of the
presidency.
The attempt came four day:
after the discharge of four toj
army officers accused of drug tn.f
ficking.
Unconfirmed reports said four
army officers had planned th<
coup, including Gen. Guy Fran
cois, commander of the Dessalines
barracks in Port-au-Prince th; t
is the base of the most feared
unit in Haiti's 7,000-man army
