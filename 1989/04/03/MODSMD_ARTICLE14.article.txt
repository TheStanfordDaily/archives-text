# Nicaraguans denounce government

MASAYA, Nicaragua (AP) â€”
More than 1,000 union members
yesterday protested the high cost
of living, the military draft and
what they called a lack of labor
rights.
The Workers' Permanent
Congress organized the demon
stration in this city, 17 miles east
of the capital of Managua.
Eli Altamirano, secretary
general of the Nicaraguan Com
munist Party, called the protest
the beginning of "a huge mobiliza
tion against the Sandinista
regime."
One sign carried by protesters
said, "Next year the nine leave,"
referring to the governing direc
torate of the left-wing Sandinis

tas.
In February 1990, Nicaragua is
to hold general elections in accord
ance with a peace plan the five
Central American presidents
agreed to two months ago.
"The elections will not
legitimize the Sandinistas.
Rather, they will be beaten," said
Antonio Jarquin, a Social Chris
tian labor leader.
The government has devalued
the currency several times this
year and slashed spending in the
face of soaring inflation and rising
unemployment.
There was no immediate reac
tion by the government to the
Masaya demonstration.
The workers' congress is a fed

eration of unions including
centrist, socialist and communist
members.
Last June the congress called
a strike that lasted several
months. Dozens of union leaders
were detained but later freed.
Some of the protesters Sunday
tried to attack a cameraman from
government-run television and a
photographer for the Sandinista
newspaper Barricada. Neither
was injured and no other incidents
were reported.
Carlos Duran, the Barricada
photographer, told The Associated
Press that the demonstrators
tried to take his camera but
foreign correspondents came to
his aid.
