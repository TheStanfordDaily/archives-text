Namibia under a U.N.-monitor«d process that
began Saturday.

Airport ruins shuttle experiment
LOS ANGELES (AP) - One of the 60 crystal
experiments aboard the space shuttle Discovery
survived outer space but was tipped over while
going through an airport X-ray security machine
rendering it useless.
"That's the way it goes in science," said Alex
ander McPherson, a UC-Riverside biochemistry
professor who sent the experiment into spac(
"I'm not real happy."
The Los Angeles Times reported yesterday that
one day after Discovery's March 18 landing.

Birmingham, Ala., Municipal Airport.

postdoctoral fellow, flew to Birmingham to carr
the experiment back to UC-Riverside.
McPherson said "as it was coming out the
other end it started to tip over. . . . Stan let loo;
a scream."
