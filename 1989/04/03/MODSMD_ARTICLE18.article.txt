## What a trip! 
### 
Stanford's basketball
teams have done us
proud this season

Thanks largely to the
efforts of 24 gifted young
women and men, Stanford
University has been one of the
best basketball schools in the
country for much of the past
three months.
A few years ago, someone
making such a statement about
the quality of hoops on this pic
turesque, Palo Alto farm might
be committed to an institution
(no, not one of higher learning).
Today, however, college basket
ball aficionados worth a nickel
can tell you that the men's team,
a fixture in the top 20 nearly 111
year, finished with 26 wins and
its first NCAA berth in 47 years.
They'd also know that the
women won more than 90 percent
of their games, were rated fourth
in the nation in the final Asso
ciated Press poll, and came up
just 10 points short of making a
trip to the Final Four.
Not that anyone should think
it all came easily. The success of
both squads in 1988-89 can be
attributed to a chain of events
that began several years ago.
For the men, the watershed
was the 1985-86 recruiting class
of Todd Lichti, Howard Wright,
Bryan McSweeney and Terry
Taylor. As a group they have
scored more points than any
other group of seniors in the na
tion.
Mix in the arrival of Coach
Mike Montgomery the next year,
and the team had the recipe for
great things: three straight win
ning seasons, back-to-back 20-

victory campaigns and two
postseason appearances includ
ing that aforementioned trip to
the NCAAs.
For the women, the turning
point was the arrival of Coach
Tar a VanDerveer. Leaving an in
credibly successful program at
Ohio State, VanDerveer brought
with her knowledge of the game
and a gift for attracting top tal
ent.
The team's leaders — Jennifer
Azzi, Sonja Henning, Katy
Steding, Trisha Stevens — came
to Stanford lacking a guarantee
that the program was a winner.
But they believed in VanDerveer
and she believed in them. The
combination has produced a na
tional powerhouse that seems
certain to vie for a national cham
pionship next time around.
Strong support from the Ath
letic Department and its tireless
director Andy Geiger has also
helped. In addition, it's safe to
say that players and coaches alike
have been delighted by the sensa
tional fan support.
The men's games have been
rollicking sellouts, and the
women have played before
growing crowds who have shown
themselves to be enthusiastic,
classy and knowledgeable all at
once.
Of course, none of it would
have been possible without those
24 men and women. To those who
are graduating — Todd, Evon,
Howard, Jill, Terry, Emily, Eric,
Bryan and Scott — we wish the
best of luck in whatever you do.
To those who are staying
around, we'll be back next year
to share your joy when things go
well, share your sadness when
they don't, and scream and yell
a lot regardless.
What a season. May it be the
first of many.
