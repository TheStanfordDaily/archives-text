## Stanford's darker side 
### 
DARKNESS IS A scary thing, and
nighttime is, without a doubt, the
scariest time of day. Despite this
fact, when I used to run, I ran at night.
I didn't want anyone to see me, because
grace isn't exactly a good nickname for
me. Other women run at night for their
own reasons, but no woman can really
say she does it without fear of attack.
Stanford, as we all know, is not a per
fectly safe environment. People get hit
by cars, cars hit each other on Palm
Drive, and women are attacked at night.
When I was a freshman, I thought of
Stanford as an extension of my own back
yard. I've been to New York City every
summer since I was 3, so I know how
to behave in a hostile environment. If
you don't know you're in one, though,
you don't deal with it that way.
One night during that year of utter
naivete, I had an interview up at the
Ram's Head offices behind the Knoll. It
was 8 p.m. and there aren't many lights
up there. A friend walked me up, and
made me promise I'd ask someone to
walk me back. I promised.
The interview went badly and I was
upset. I forgot my promise and started
back down the hill to Florence Moore
Hall alone.
In a pitch dark spot under some trees,
someone grabbed my arm. I couldn't see
his face, but I could tell that he was
bigger than me, and I got scared.
He was saying something like "Come
on" and pulling me, and I didn't know
what to do. I dug my heels in and told
him to let me go. He just pulled harder,
and I started to worry that he would

hurt me if I didn't go with him. So I
punched him and screamed.
He let go and disappeared, and I was
left with a sore arm and two ruined shoes.
As I have said, I'm 6 feet tall and not
exactly willowy. I lift weights, I used to
row crew and I was one of the few girls
in my elementary school who didn't pull
hair, but punched instead. But I was
scared. I screamed. And I don't walk
alone at night any more.
One Sunday night a friend and I were
up on the roof of Whitman House looking
at the stars. We were not urinating.
That's a male-bonding thing.
Anyway, we saw a woman jogging along
Campus Drive. She looked fairly toned,
and she wasn't staggering the way I do,
so I assumed she was in pretty good
shape. She could probably outrun some
one chasing her. Probably.
And that's the thing of it, see? I im
mediately thought about how well she
would deal with an attack.
I also thought about the incident last
quarter involving fraternity men doing
male-bonding things on their roof. What
if the woman jogger in that incident had
been getting her exercise at night? Loud,
drunken voices coming out of the dark
are frightening, and when their content
is lewd and threatening, who is to say
that what they did was harmless?
But that all happened during the day,
didn't it? And it's the night we're con
cerned with here.

bush holds a maniac with a Ginsu knife,

At night, every tree is
suspect, every bush holds
a maniac with a Ginsu
knife, and the dark alleys
between the buildings
have lots of unlit places
where rapists and ax
murderers can hide.

and ax-murderers can hide. Last week I
thought I saw Norman Bates near Tres
idder Union, but my night vision isn't
so hot. Probably wasn't him.
OK, maybe I'm exaggerating the dan
ger, but I'm serious, too. Every night
people ziay at the library until closing.
They may all leave together, but most
of the time they separate. Women are
left to walk alone.
Smart ones call SURE or ask a friend
to join them. Dumb ones? Well, there
shouldn't be any dumb people here, but
there shouldn't be any rapists either, and
as I said before, Stanford is not perfect.

up there. A friend walked me up, and
made me promise I'd ask someone to
walk me back. I promised.
The interview went badly and I was
upset. I forgot my promise and started
back down the hill to Florence Moore
Hall alone.
In a pitch dark spot under some trees,
someone grabbed my arm. I couldn't see
his face, but I could tell that he was
bigger than me, and I got scared.
He was saying something like "Come
on" and pulling me, and I didn't know
what to do. I dug my heels in and told
him to let me go. He just pulled harder,
and I started to worry that he would

hurt me if I didn't go with him. So I
punched him and screamed.
He let go and disappeared, and I was
left with a sore arm and two ruined shoes.
As I have said, I'm 6 feet tall and not
exactly willowy. I lift weights, I used to
row crew and I was one of the few girls
in my elementary school who didn't pull
hair, but punched instead. But I was
scared. I screamed. And I don't walk
alone at night any more.
One Sunday night a friend and I were
up on the roof of Whitman House looking
at the stars. We were not urinating.
That's a male-bonding thing.
Anyway, we saw a woman jogging along
Campus Drive. She looked fairly toned,
and she wasn't staggering the way I do,
so I assumed she was in pretty good
shape. She could probably outrun some
one chasing her. Probably.
And that's the thing of it, see? I im
mediately thought about how well she
would deal with an attack.
I also thought about the incident last
quarter involving fraternity men doing
male-bonding things on their roof. What
if the woman jogger in that incident had
been getting her exercise at night? Loud,
drunken voices coming out of the dark
are frightening, and when their content
is lewd and threatening, who is to say
that what they did was harmless?
But that all happened during the day,
didn't it? And it's the night we're con
cerned with here.
At night, every tree is suspect, every
bush holds a maniac with a Ginsu knife,
and the dark alleys between the buildings
have lots of unlit places where rapists

murderers can hide.

and ax-murderers can hide. Last week I
thought I saw Norman Bates near Tres
idder Union, but my night vision isn't
so hot. Probably wasn't him.
OK, maybe I'm exaggerating the dan
ger, but I'm serious, too. Every night
people ziay at the library until closing.
They may all leave together, but most
of the time they separate. Women are
left to walk alone.
Smart ones call SURE or ask a friend
to join them. Dumb ones? Well, there
shouldn't be any dumb people here, but
there shouldn't be any rapists either, and
as I said before, Stanford is not perfect.
