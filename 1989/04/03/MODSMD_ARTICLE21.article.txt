## Generalizing about white males ignores progress 
### 
IN HIS March 10 column, Burke
Smith laments, "I have often heard
the argument that the color of my
skin somehow devalues my opinion
regarding minority issues: 'You could
never understand because you are
white.' " Smith says that such a state
ment effectively eliminates communica
tion between the msyority and minori
ties.
Responses by Toni Long and Kristen
Walsh claim that, indeed, whites —
white males in particular — can't
understand, and that they should
admit that. Walsh and Long are par
tially correct. In fact, whites (particu
larly white men) cannot empathize
completely with the experience of
people who have suffered because of
pervasive, often institutionalized, racial
or sexual discrimination.
But all humans share many charac-

teristics, among them the ability to
sympathize with and understand people
who have undergone experiences quite
unlike their own. A crucial distinction
exists between the notions that one
cannot empathize completely with
someone else's experience and the idea
that one cannot understand it at all.
Indeed, if the latter were the case,
there would seem little reason for
communication between human beings
at all, since each of us experiences a
life different from anyone else's.
Smith fails to acknowledge the fact
that members of the majority will
never fully understand and that it is
important that we realize and remem
ber that. But his larger point is a good
one: The goal is mutual understanding,
and many among the mtyority are not
guilty of discrimination; they are
trying to eradicate it and deserve to be

heard, understood and respected.
Long's March 15 response to Smith
offends on two counts. First, it sug
gests that nothing separates one white
male from another on this issue and
that no whites or males have yet made
the necessary connection; second, it
ignores the progress that has been
made thanks to the efforts of many
women, people of color and even white
males who have been trying to rid the
world of racism and sexism for some
time now.
The struggle against discrimination,
I hope, is the struggle of all those
individuals who abhor it to change the
attitudes and behavior of those individ
uals who practice it. If the struggle is
defined as the struggle of women and
people of color against whites and
males, then the struggle is, by defini-

tion, as eternal as the plurality of the
races and sexes.
Although members of oppressive
groups do need to acknowledge the
wrongs of the past and present and
take responsibility for righting those
wrongs, no positive end will be
achieved unless all individuals judge
each other individually, unless we can
differentiate between the prejudiced
white male and the white male who
behaves ethically and fairly.
To speak of white males — or the
members of any other group — as if
they all are completely similar is to fail
to recognize progress, and if we fail to
recognize progress when it happens,
how will we really progress at all?
