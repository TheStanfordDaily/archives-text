# Racist outburst at Sunday Flick showed immaturity
## 
### 
At the late showing of "Rattle and
Hum" at the March 19 Sunday Flicks,
I was unfortunately witness to an un
provoked verbal attack on black stu
dents at Stanford. About a minute
prior to scenes in the movie shot in
Harlem, a group of five to 10 male
students in the audience shouted
"Black students go home!" in unison. I
was stunned, as there was no precur
sor or provocation for such an act.
I realize that I will not be exposed
only to attitudes pleasant to me and
agreeing with my own in a place so
diverse as Stanford, yet I feel that
such diversity should breed tolerance,
not contempt.

If Stanford students, as individuals,
have problems dealing with members
of another race, they may be attending
the wrong institution, and living in the
wrong world.
