# Retain commitment to Resources Planning program
## 
### 
University President Donald Ken
nedy's recent proposal for a new course
sequence in environmental studies
seems to have struck a nerve in the
Stanford community. At the graduate
level, however, the University, and the
School of Engineering and Civil Engi
neering Department in particualar,
seem to be moving in the opposite
direction. Witness the recent decision

to close the Resources Planning Pro
gram in Civil Engineering.
This program has, since 1968, taught
students and conducted research in
interdisciplinary and international top
ics in natural resources, energy and
environmental planning. The program
integrates fields as diverse as engineer
ing, economics, law, biology, urban
studies and earth sciences.
The Resources Planning Program
has been very successful in recruiting
and graduating masters and doctoral
students, especially considering the
small number of faculty (currently two)
in the program. Graduates from this
program are making a difference, going
on to successful and influential posi
tions in academia, private industry and
government in several nations.
Despite its interdisciplinary and envi
ronmental focus, or perhaps because of
it, Resources Planning is closing just
as the need for its mission is becoming
most obvious.

Unfortunately, the reasons for its
demise seem to be that it has brought
in less corporate research funding than
other programs, and that there is a
general mistrust of an interdisciplinary
program that might appear "fuzzy"
within the School of Engineering. Are
these the sorts of criteria upon which
University policy is based, and have
they been discussed openly?
As the Stanford community considers
a proposal to improve the literacy of
undergraduates regarding environmen
tal problems, why not support the
application of professional skills at the
graduate level to the solution of these
problems? If we cannot maintain a
coordinated undergraduate and gradu
ate environmental curriculum, where
will our environmentally literate gradu
ates do post-graduate work? Not at
Stanford.
