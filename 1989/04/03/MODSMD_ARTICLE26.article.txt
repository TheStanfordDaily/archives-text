# Saints receive divine inspiration, upset Cardinal

### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
GREENSBORO, N.C. — It was surpris
ing, depressing, crushing, irritating, un
nerving, mind-boggling. It was all those
things, and worst of all, it was unalterable.
Men's Basketball
Saints 80, Cardinal 78
Yet, just after 7 p.m. on March 16, mem
bers of the Stanford Band, Stanford Axe
Committee and other fans gathered on the
balconies of the Ramada Inn in Greensboro
and applauded the Cardinal men's basket
ball team as, one-by-one, they boarded the
bus that would take them away. Away from
Greensboro, away from their 80-78 loss to
Siena, away from the NCAA Tournament
which they had waited years (four or 47,
depending on your point of view) to play in.
In a way, it was the proudest moment
of the 1988-89 season, Stanford's curtain
call. But no one around expected those
bows to come so early in the tourney, and
after a performance that admittedly wasn't
the Cardinal's proudest.
Seeded third entering the NCAA East
Regional, Stanford was persecuted by a
Saint — 5-foot-11 Siena Saint guard Marc
Brown. Brown scored 32 points and hit
two free throws with three seconds left to
break a 78-78 tie before 12,011 fans, most
of whom had rallied behind the underdog
14th-seeded Saints, at the Greensboro
Coliseum.
"This is certainly one of the toughest
situations I've been in as a coach," an
apoplectic Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery said after the game. "I really didn't
have to much to say to the team; I didn't
know what to say.
"But to put the blame on our basketball
team would diminish Siena's effort and the
emotion they played with."
In its first NCAA tournament game since
winning the title in 1942, Stanford had
been able to rally from what had been a
16-point deficit with 12:10 to go, but was
never able to stop Brown, who made 13-
of-20 shots, including 4-of-9 3-pointers, and
passed for six assists.
"It would be hard for me to imagine a
guy being too much better than Brown,"
Montgomery said after the game. "He's as
good as any guard we played against."
Siena Coach Mike Deane was jazzed
enough by Brown's rebellion against Stan
ford to say that "if Todd Lichti is third
team All-America, Marc Brown is first
team All-America." Though Brown came

down to earth in Siena's second-round loss
to Minnesota, shooting 0-for-ll from 3-
point range, that was little consolation for
Stanford on March 16.
The Saints had the ball for the final shot
with 34 seconds left after two free throws
by Stanford's Adam Keefe (who led the
Cardinal with 22 points) tied the game at
78. As the clock ran down, Siena drew
Stanford big men Keefe and Howard
Wright away from the basket and cleared
the right side for Brown.
Brown got a screen, hooked around the
right and drove in. Keefe and Wright were
too far away to help, and Lichti brushed
Brown's head from behind.
Brown had missed two one-and-one sit
uations in the last minute, and Stanford
called time out to ice him before each free
throw. But Brown swished them both. In
its last posession of the season, Stanford
could not get the ball past midcourt.
"I didn't mean to foul him," said Lichti,
who had 17 points. "I just bumped him on
the head." Later, in the locker room, Lichti
added that "there were things let go that
were worse than that."
Lichti sat on the locker-room bench, a
beaten man. He had already been suffering
from nagging injuries when he hit the floor
in whiplash-like fashion on a drive with
13:48 left in the first half. He lay on the
ground for over three minutes. Thinking
of what might have been did little to relieve
the pain.
But one could not lay the blame for the
defeat on Lichti's foul. Brown had beaten
Stanford long before his final free throws.
Forget how well he shot the ball. Brown
played with more arrogance than any single
player opposing the Cardinal this season,
including Player of the Year Sean Elliott.
And that's a compliment. As was once said,
"It ain't bragging if you can do it."
Brown drove coast-to-coast for a layup,
flat-out ignoring the Trees that make up
the Stanford front line in more than nick
name only. He spun 360 degrees before
sinking a 10-foot bank shot.
At one point, Brown came down on a
fast break and threw up an alley-oop pass
when there's no way he should have. Cer
tainly, he was due for his come-uppance.
No way. The biggest in-your-face of the
season awaited. After a steal by Siena,
Brown had the ball alone on the fast break.
Wright waited at the free-throw line for
the inevitable penetration.
But, with no Saint within 35 feet of a
possible rebound, Brown pulled up on the
break and sank a 3-pointer. It was like
when Indiana Jones shot the swordsman

in Raiders of the Lost Ark. I see
you. Here's my gun. Boom.
That silver bullet by Brown
came in the middle of a seven-plus
minute, 24-4 run by Siena to give
the Saints a 61-45 lead with 12:10
left. But Stanford had one last
breath left.
Montgomery inserted Scott
Meinert as a third guard to play
with Lichti and Terry Taylor.
Meinert hit a 3-pointer to end
Siena's run and start a 21-5 streak
by Stanford, which tied the game
at 66-66 with 6:40 left on a slam
dunk by Lichti from Taylor.
But in the end, there were too
many mistakes by Stanford,
which committed 19 turnovers in
the game and made other un
recorded errors. Only the play of
Keefe, who proved beyond a doubt
that he will be the focal point of
Stanford basketball for the next
three seasons, kept Stanford alive.
Keefe, who averaged 17 points
and six rebounds over his final
four games, scored all of Stan

ford's remaining 12 points, includ
ing eight free throws without a
miss (he was 12-of-13 for the
game on foul shots) in his uphill
battle to rescue the Cardinal.
"I felt like I could sense some
thing wasn't there as a team,"
Keefe said. "I don't know what it
was. I was never really down; I
was even confident we would come
back."
Wright, who never got un
tracked in the game (he scored
just eight points and missed all
four of his free throws), also
thought Stanford would pull it
out.
"We've always been good
enough to come back," he said.
"This time, the clock ran out on
us.
"We've never played a team like
this," he added. "So much quick
ness, they set so many
picks... .What can you do?"
The only thing, it seems, is to
start over and make sure that
Stanford doesn't wait until the
year 2036 for its next NCAA
Tournament berth. If any of the
character of this year's team
carries over, the wait won't be
long at all.

Committee and other fans gathered on the
balconies of the Ramada Inn in Greensboro
and applauded the Cardinal men's basket
ball team as, one-by-one, they boarded the
bus that would take them away. Away from
Greensboro, away from their 80-78 loss to
Siena, away from the NCAA Tournament
which they had waited years (four or 47,
depending on your point of view) to play in.
In a way, it was the proudest moment
of the 1988-89 season, Stanford's curtain
call. But no one around expected those
bows to come so early in the tourney, and
after a performance that admittedly wasn't
the Cardinal's proudest.
Seeded third entering the NCAA East
Regional, Stanford was persecuted by a
Saint — 5-foot-11 Siena Saint guard Marc
Brown. Brown scored 32 points and hit
two free throws with three seconds left to
break a 78-78 tie before 12,011 fans, most
of whom had rallied behind the underdog
14th-seeded Saints, at the Greensboro
Coliseum.
"This is certainly one of the toughest
situations I've been in as a coach," an
apoplectic Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery said after the game. "I really didn't
have to much to say to the team; I didn't
know what to say.
"But to put the blame on our basketball
team would diminish Siena's effort and the
emotion they played with."
In its first NCAA tournament game since
winning the title in 1942, Stanford had
been able to rally from what had been a
16-point deficit with 12:10 to go, but was
never able to stop Brown, who made 13-
of-20 shots, including 4-of-9 3-pointers, and
passed for six assists.
"It would be hard for me to imagine a
guy being too much better than Brown,"
Montgomery said after the game. "He's as
good as any guard we played against."
Siena Coach Mike Deane was jazzed
enough by Brown's rebellion against Stan
ford to say that "if Todd Lichti is third
team All-America, Marc Brown is first
team All-America." Though Brown came

down to earth in Siena's second-round loss
to Minnesota, shooting 0-for-ll from 3-
point range, that was little consolation for
Stanford on March 16.
The Saints had the ball for the final shot
with 34 seconds left after two free throws
by Stanford's Adam Keefe (who led the
Cardinal with 22 points) tied the game at
78. As the clock ran down, Siena drew
Stanford big men Keefe and Howard
Wright away from the basket and cleared
the right side for Brown.
Brown got a screen, hooked around the
right and drove in. Keefe and Wright were
too far away to help, and Lichti brushed
Brown's head from behind.
Brown had missed two one-and-one sit
uations in the last minute, and Stanford
called time out to ice him before each free
throw. But Brown swished them both. In
its last posession of the season, Stanford
could not get the ball past midcourt.
"I didn't mean to foul him," said Lichti,
who had 17 points. "I just bumped him on
the head." Later, in the locker room, Lichti
added that "there were things let go that
were worse than that."
Lichti sat on the locker-room bench, a
beaten man. He had already been suffering
from nagging injuries when he hit the floor
in whiplash-like fashion on a drive with
13:48 left in the first half. He lay on the
ground for over three minutes. Thinking
of what might have been did little to relieve
the pain.
But one could not lay the blame for the
defeat on Lichti's foul. Brown had beaten
Stanford long before his final free throws.
Forget how well he shot the ball. Brown
played with more arrogance than any single
player opposing the Cardinal this season,
including Player of the Year Sean Elliott.
And that's a compliment. As was once said,
"It ain't bragging if you can do it."
Brown drove coast-to-coast for a layup,
flat-out ignoring the Trees that make up
the Stanford front line in more than nick
name only. He spun 360 degrees before
sinking a 10-foot bank shot.
At one point, Brown came down on a
fast break and threw up an alley-oop pass
when there's no way he should have. Cer
tainly, he was due for his come-uppance.
No way. The biggest in-your-face of the
season awaited. After a steal by Siena,
Brown had the ball alone on the fast break.
Wright waited at the free-throw line for
the inevitable penetration.
But, with no Saint within 35 feet of a
possible rebound, Brown pulled up on the
break and sank a 3-pointer. It was like
when Indiana Jones shot the swordsman

you. Here's my gun. Boom.
That silver bullet by Brown
came in the middle of a seven-plus
minute, 24-4 run by Siena to give
the Saints a 61-45 lead with 12:10
left. But Stanford had one last
breath left.
Montgomery inserted Scott
Meinert as a third guard to play
with Lichti and Terry Taylor.
Meinert hit a 3-pointer to end
Siena's run and start a 21-5 streak
by Stanford, which tied the game
at 66-66 with 6:40 left on a slam
dunk by Lichti from Taylor.
But in the end, there were too
many mistakes by Stanford,
which committed 19 turnovers in
the game and made other un
recorded errors. Only the play of
Keefe, who proved beyond a doubt
that he will be the focal point of
Stanford basketball for the next
three seasons, kept Stanford alive.
Keefe, who averaged 17 points
and six rebounds over his final
four games, scored all of Stan

ford's remaining 12 points, includ
ing eight free throws without a
miss (he was 12-of-13 for the
game on foul shots) in his uphill
battle to rescue the Cardinal.
"I felt like I could sense some
thing wasn't there as a team,"
Keefe said. "I don't know what it
was. I was never really down; I
was even confident we would come
back."
Wright, who never got un
tracked in the game (he scored
just eight points and missed all
four of his free throws), also
thought Stanford would pull it
out.
"We've always been good
enough to come back," he said.
"This time, the clock ran out on
us.
"We've never played a team like
this," he added. "So much quick
ness, they set so many
picks... .What can you do?"
The only thing, it seems, is to
start over and make sure that
Stanford doesn't wait until the
year 2036 for its next NCAA
Tournament berth. If any of the
character of this year's team
carries over, the wait won't be
long at all.
GREENSBORO, N.C. — It was surpris
ing, depressing, crushing, irritating, un
nerving, mind-boggling. It was all those
things, and worst of all, it was unalterable.
