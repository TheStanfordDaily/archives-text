# Saints receive divine inspiration, upset Cardinal

### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
GREENSBORO, N.C. — It was surpris
ing, depressing, crushing, irritating, un
nerving, mind-boggling. It was all those
things, and worst of all, it was unalterable.
Men's Basketball
Saints 80, Cardinal 78
Yet, just after 7 p.m. on March 16, mem
bers of the Stanford Band, Stanford Axe
Committee and other fans gathered on the
balconies of the Ramada Inn in Greensboro
and applauded the Cardinal men's basket
ball team as, one-by-one, they boarded the
bus that would take them away. Away from
Greensboro, away from their 80-78 loss to
Siena, away from the NCAA Tournament
which they had waited years (four or 47,
depending on your point of view) to play in.
In a way, it was the proudest moment
of the 1988-89 season, Stanford's curtain
call. But no one around expected those
bows to come so early in the tourney, and
after a performance that admittedly wasn't
the Cardinal's proudest.
Seeded third entering the NCAA East
Regional, Stanford was persecuted by a
Saint — 5-foot-11 Siena Saint guard Marc
Brown. Brown scored 32 points and hit
two free throws with three seconds left to
break a 78-78 tie before 12,011 fans, most
of whom had rallied behind the underdog
14th-seeded Saints, at the Greensboro
Coliseum.
"This is certainly one of the toughest
situations I've been in as a coach," an
apoplectic Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery said after the game. "I really didn't
have to much to say to the team; I didn't
know what to say.
"But to put the blame on our basketball
team would diminish Siena's effort and the
emotion they played with."
In its first NCAA tournament game since
winning the title in 1942, Stanford had
been able to rally from what had been a
16-point deficit with 12:10 to go, but was
never able to stop Brown, who made 13-
of-20 shots, including 4-of-9 3-pointers, and
passed for six assists.
"It would be hard for me to imagine a
guy being too much better than Brown,"
Montgomery said after the game. "He's as
good as any guard we played against."
Siena Coach Mike Deane was jazzed
enough by Brown's rebellion against Stan
ford to say that "if Todd Lichti is third
team All-America, Marc Brown is first
team All-America." Though Brown came

down to earth in Siena's second-round loss
to Minnesota, shooting 0-for-ll from 3-
point range, that was little consolation for
Stanford on March 16.
The Saints had the ball for the final shot
with 34 seconds left after two free throws
by Stanford's Adam Keefe (who led the
Cardinal with 22 points) tied the game at
78. As the clock ran down, Siena drew
Stanford big men Keefe and Howard
Wright away from the basket and cleared
the right side for Brown.
Brown got a screen, hooked around the
right and drove in. Keefe and Wright were
too far away to help, and Lichti brushed
Brown's head from behind.
Brown had missed two one-and-one sit
uations in the last minute, and Stanford
called time out to ice him before each free
throw. But Brown swished them both. In
its last posession of the season, Stanford
could not get the ball past midcourt.
"I didn't mean to foul him," said Lichti,
who had 17 points. "I just bumped him on
the head." Later, in the locker room, Lichti
added that "there were things let go that
were worse than that."
Lichti sat on the locker-room bench, a
beaten man. He had already been suffering
from nagging injuries when he hit the floor
in whiplash-like fashion on a drive with
13:48 left in the first half. He lay on the
ground for over three minutes. Thinking
of what might have been did little to relieve
the pain.
But one could not lay the blame for the
defeat on Lichti's foul. Brown had beaten
Stanford long before his final free throws.
Forget how well he shot the ball. Brown
played with more arrogance than any single
player opposing the Cardinal this season,
including Player of the Year Sean Elliott.
And that's a compliment. As was once said,
"It ain't bragging if you can do it."
Brown drove coast-to-coast for a layup,
flat-out ignoring the Trees that make up
the Stanford front line in more than nick
name only. He spun 360 degrees before
sinking a 10-foot bank shot.
At one point, Brown came down on a
fast break and threw up an alley-oop pass
when there's no way he should have. Cer
tainly, he was due for his come-uppance.
No way. The biggest in-your-face of the
season awaited. After a steal by Siena,
Brown had the ball alone on the fast break.
Wright waited at the free-throw line for
the inevitable penetration.
But, with no Saint within 35 feet of a
possible rebound, Brown pulled up on the
break and sank a 3-pointer. It was like
when Indiana Jones shot the swordsman

a running and gunning Siena team in the first round of the NCAA tournament.
