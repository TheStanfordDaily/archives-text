# Dream season comes to close

GREENSBORO, N.C.
Todd Lichti will never play
another basketball game
for Stanford University.
Neither will Howard Wright.
Nor will Terry Taylor, Eric
Reveno, Bryan McSweeney and
Scott Meinert.

Think about that for a minute.
When looking back years from
now, I get a sneaking suspicion
that a disappointing (devestating,
perhaps?), 80-78 last-second
defeat at the hands of the little
known Siena "We-didn't-have-a
nickname-until-a-couple-of-
weeks-ago-but-you-can-call-us-
the-Saints" won't be the catas
trophe it seemed to be March 16.
Instead, I honestly believe that
when looking back, I'll remember
the good times:
A 15-foot buzzer-beater floats off
the hands of Wright and through
the net to knock off Arizona in
1987.
That was in another era of
Stanford basketball. A couple
thousand fans came to Maples and
sort of sat around watching the
game. Maybe applauded a little
now and again.
Before that contest, I was
watching Wright during warm
ups. I turned to a friend of mine
and said something about how I
wished that Wright was a better
player.
A woman seated nearby turned
to me and glared. Exhibiting a
great deal of equanimity, the
woman told me how wonderful
