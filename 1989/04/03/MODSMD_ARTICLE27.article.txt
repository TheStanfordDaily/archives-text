# Dream season comes to close
## 
### 
GREENSBORO, N.C.
Todd Lichti will never play
another basketball game
for Stanford University.
Neither will Howard Wright.
Nor will Terry Taylor, Eric
Reveno, Bryan McSweeney and
Scott Meinert.

Think about that for a minute.
When looking back years from
now, I get a sneaking suspicion
that a disappointing (devestating,
perhaps?), 80-78 last-second
defeat at the hands of the little
known Siena "We-didn't-have-a
nickname-until-a-couple-of-
weeks-ago-but-you-can-call-us-
the-Saints" won't be the catas
trophe it seemed to be March 16.
Instead, I honestly believe that
when looking back, I'll remember
the good times:
A 15-foot buzzer-beater floats off
the hands of Wright and through
the net to knock off Arizona in
1987.
That was in another era of
Stanford basketball. A couple
thousand fans came to Maples and
sort of sat around watching the
game. Maybe applauded a little
now and again.
Before that contest, I was
watching Wright during warm
ups. I turned to a friend of mine
and said something about how I
wished that Wright was a better
player.
A woman seated nearby turned
to me and glared. Exhibiting a
great deal of equanimity, the
woman told me how wonderful


MARK ROGOWSKY
Wright was, and how wrong I was.
She was Howard Wright's
girlfriend.
Feeling rather foolish, I
apologized and tried to explain
that I thought Wright was a good
player but that he could be great
if he worked harder. She seemed
to accept my apology, at least par
tially.
When Wright's shot gave Stan
ford the improbable win — and
the crowd stormed the court —
she got my attention and said
"What do you think now?"
"Howard Wright is the best bas
ketball player in the world," I
said.
The team closed out that season
with a winning record under first
year Coach Mike Montgomery.
For Wright and the Cardinal, it
was to be the start of something
big.
In the 1987-88 campaign,
Wright's breakthrough came. He
became an almost unstoppable
force inside and on the boards.
And, lest I forget, that Lichti guy
was on his way to becoming one
of the best players in the country.
The duo teamed up for 45
points in one of the most impor
tant wins in Stanford basketball
history. It was a victory that put
the Cardinal back on the national
map for the first time in decades.
Arizona, this time ranked No. 1
in the nation, would again be the
victim . . .
Stanford stuns the Wildcats
before 7,500 screaming fans in
Maples. Arizona is held without

a point in the last 5:36 of the
game as the Cardinal scores 12
straight to turn a 74-72 deficit
into a shocking 82-74 upset.
I doubt that I will ever feel the
same emotion about a sporting
event as I did at that game.
Screaming at the top of my lungs,
jumping up and down, practically
fainting from disbelief.
The single-most poignant
memory came in the game's
closing minutes. Whenever a Car
dinal player stepped up to the
free-throw line, the raucous
Maples crowd would grow in
stantly silent. Then, as soon as
anyone's shot would go through
the hoop, every single fan roared
in unison.
Awesome.
After completing the season
ranked 13th in the country, Stan
ford earns its first NCAA berth
in 47 years. The team is third
seed in the East Region and will
play Siena in the first round.
With all the preseason hype,
and the solid play throughout the
year, the tournament berth was
signed, sealed and all but
delivered when the selection com
mittee announced the pairings.
Still, it couldn't have been
sweeter. The plan was simple:
knock ofT Siena (they're the ones
with the measles epidemic,
right?), roll past the Kansas State-
Minnesota winner and head for
the regionals.
The next stop was the
Meadowlands. For all intents and
purposes, New York City. A
matchup with Duke. How perfect.
Duke, as many know, has the
basketball program Stanford most
covets. They're incredibly success

ful (three Final Fours in four
years), squeaky clean, have to
recruit despite stringent academic
requirements and win with
players who are considered to be
less talented than their opponents.
If Stanford was in the market
for a basketball program, and
such things could be bought and
sold, it would buy Duke's.
A Sweet 16 appearance would
have let every prospective recruit
know once and for all about all
the wonderful things that were
happening to the basketball pro
gram at Stanford. Not only do
they win games but some of their
players (Greg Butler, Lichti and
quite possible Wright) even go to
the NBA.
But it didn't come to pass.
For despite all the huge obsta
cles Stanford overcame en route
to its best season in the latter
part of the 20th century, one of
the smallest obstacles — a 5-foot
-11 waterbug of a guard named
Marc Brown — stood in the way.
Brown led the unheralded
Saints in their upset of Stanford.
He scored a career-high 31 points.
He was simply awesome. Of
course, his teammates weren't too
shabby either.
For Stanford, a strong tourna
ment showing with this senior
dominated squad was seen by
many as the chance to develop the
program into a power.
From this perspective, I will
take this chance to disagree. While
it would be foolish to argue that
the defeat wasn't a setback, it
would be equally foolish to sug
gest that Cardinal hoops is going
to return to the less-than-halcyon
days of the early '80s.
Success, you see, breeds suc

cess, and one tournament loss can
not erase 47 wins over two sea
sons. Nor can it erase the presence
of the architect of that success —
Montgomery.
It appears that rumors of his
departure have been greatly ex
aggerated and that he might just
stick around for awhile. Mont
gomery told me that when he
came here, he didn't think he
would win more than 25 games
in a single season (as he did in
1988-89).
But he has. And success also
breeds desire for more success. If
Lichti, Wright, Reveno, Taylor,
McSweeney, Meinert et al. could
do it, why can't Adam Keefe, Des
hon Wingate, Andrew Vlahov
Kenny Ammann, Marcus Lollie &
Co.?
Keefe played so brilliantly in
the season's closing weeks, it
seemed clear he was destined for
the stardom forecast for him upon
his arrival here. Wingate has a
solid shot to become a quality for
ward both offensively and defen
sively. Without the presence of six
seniors, Vlahov could emerge as
one of the best all-around players
in the conference.
Ammann, a junior college trans
fer, will likely take over at shoot
ing guard if his back is healthy.
Apparently, he can light it up from
almost anywhere. Lollie, one of
the top two recruits for next year,
gives the Cardinal an element it
was sorely lacking — quickness
in the backcourt.
I'm not suggesting another
NCAA appearance is in the offing
for the coming season, but, with
next year's schedule being much
softer than this year's, a third
straight 20-win season is not as
impossible as the naysayers think.
