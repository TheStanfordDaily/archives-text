RUSTON, La. — Injuries are the bane
of any team, but for the Stanford wom
en's basketball team it was a nagging
Achilles heel that hindered an otherwise
healthy Cardinal.

Cardinal reaches
Midwest Regional final
Outrebounded in its final two games
of the season, Stanford blew past its in
itial opponents in the NCAA Tournament
but was stalled in the regional final as
host Louisiana Tech grabbed its way to
the Midwest Region championship and a
Final Four berth with an 85-75 decision.
The loss followed a 105-77 drubbing
of Illinois State in Maples Pavilion and
a 98-74 win over lowa in the regional

semifinal. The latter extended the Car
dinal's winning streak to a Stanford- and
Pacific 10 Conference-record 22 straight.
All told, the Cardinal concluded the
season with a school-best 28-3 record and
progressed further than any other team
in Stanford history. Ranked fourth in
the final Associated Press poll, the team
finished tied for fifth place in the nation.
The Cardinal's tournament journey
began with the March 18 second-round
contest with Illinois State. Enjoying a
home-court where neither the men nor
women's basketball teams relinquished a
game, the cagers ran past the Redbirds
with highlight-film-like effectiveness.
The team surpassed the 100-point
mark for the fourth straight outing,
sparked by an explosive 9-for-13 bombing
from behind the 3-point line. The team
shot 60 percent overall, but it was this
extra boost from outside — especially
Katy Steding, who made 3-of-4 threes —
that blew the game open in the home

team's favor.
"I didn't feel like it was that difficult
of a game," confessed Steding, who
finished with 24 points. "Once we did
something, they took it away and we had
to go to the next thing, but I felt that
we were in control from the outset."
"I thought they took very good advan
tage of our mistakes," Illinois State Coach
Jill Hutchison said. "I'd venture to say
that every one of our turnovers resulted
in a basket.
"Frankly, I think we had them well
scouted — they didn't do anything we
didn t expect, but we didn't execute as
well as we needed to."
Neither did Stanford's next opponent,
No. 8 lowa. Though the Hawkeyes ex
ploited openings in Stanford's post de
fense with an endless series of first-half
backdoor plays, lowa simply lacked the
manpower or ability to overpower the
Cardinal.
. Center Chanda Berry notched a double

double with 20 points and 11 rebounds,
but the real stand-out was Stanford soph
omore Trisha Stevens. Undaunted by the
towering Berry, Stevens shot 13-for-15
under the hoop en route to a career- and
regional-high 31 points.
"I think we did a really good job of
getting the ball inside to Trisha, which
is obvious going 13-for-15," Stanford
Coach Tara VanDerveer said. "She's very
tough to stop on the block, and we were
able to pass in to her."
Guard Jennifer Azzi added 13 points
and nine assists to the effort afler scoring
19 against the Redbirds, and Steding was
held to 14. But the Cardinal exhibited
generally good offense, rebounding from
a slow first half to come close to yet
another triple-digit game.
Behind several times in the first half
by two or three points, Stanford rallied
until a buzzer-beating 3-pointer by fresh
man Martha Richards gave the Cardinal
a 40-34 halftime lead. The team went on

a 15-2 run fresh out of the locker room,
however, and the momentum and advan
tage shifted permanently into the Cardi
nal corner.
"I thought we played hard against a
team with great depth and great ability,"
lowa Coach C. Vivian Stringer said. "We
gave it our best, but today our best just
wasn't good enough."
"They're a great team, believe me,"
Stringer said of Stanford. "They're so
fast and shoot the ball so well. I can't
recognize a weakness. They've got every
thing."
Well, almost everything. The one miss
ing ingredient, rebounding, did not prove
problematic against the Hawkeyes but
was fatal against the Techsters.
Senior Evon Asforis seemed to carry
the board burden alone, grabbing 13 in
the lowa game to complement 10 points.
