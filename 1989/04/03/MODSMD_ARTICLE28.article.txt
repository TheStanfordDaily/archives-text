RUSTON, La. — Injuries are the bane
of any team, but for the Stanford wom
en's basketball team it was a nagging
Achilles heel that hindered an otherwise
healthy Cardinal.
Women's Basketball
Cardinal reaches
Midwest Regional final
Outrebounded in its final two games
of the season, Stanford blew past its in
itial opponents in the NCAA Tournament
but was stalled in the regional final as
host Louisiana Tech grabbed its way to
the Midwest Region championship and a
Final Four berth with an 85-75 decision.
The loss followed a 105-77 drubbing
of Illinois State in Maples Pavilion and
a 98-74 win over lowa in the regional

semifinal. The latter extended the Car
dinal's winning streak to a Stanford- and
Pacific 10 Conference-record 22 straight.
All told, the Cardinal concluded the
season with a school-best 28-3 record and
progressed further than any other team
in Stanford history. Ranked fourth in
the final Associated Press poll, the team
finished tied for fifth place in the nation.
The Cardinal's tournament journey
began with the March 18 second-round
contest with Illinois State. Enjoying a
home-court where neither the men nor
women's basketball teams relinquished a
game, the cagers ran past the Redbirds
with highlight-film-like effectiveness.
The team surpassed the 100-point
mark for the fourth straight outing,
sparked by an explosive 9-for-13 bombing
from behind the 3-point line. The team
shot 60 percent overall, but it was this
extra boost from outside — especially
Katy Steding, who made 3-of-4 threes —
that blew the game open in the home

team's favor.
"I didn't feel like it was that difficult
of a game," confessed Steding, who
finished with 24 points. "Once we did
something, they took it away and we had
to go to the next thing, but I felt that
we were in control from the outset."
"I thought they took very good advan
tage of our mistakes," Illinois State Coach
Jill Hutchison said. "I'd venture to say
that every one of our turnovers resulted
in a basket.
"Frankly, I think we had them well
scouted — they didn't do anything we
didn t expect, but we didn't execute as
well as we needed to."
Neither did Stanford's next opponent,
No. 8 lowa. Though the Hawkeyes ex
ploited openings in Stanford's post de
fense with an endless series of first-half
backdoor plays, lowa simply lacked the
manpower or ability to overpower the
Cardinal.
. Center Chanda Berry notched a double

double with 20 points and 11 rebounds,
but the real stand-out was Stanford soph
omore Trisha Stevens. Undaunted by the
towering Berry, Stevens shot 13-for-15
under the hoop en route to a career- and
regional-high 31 points.
"I think we did a really good job of
getting the ball inside to Trisha, which
is obvious going 13-for-15," Stanford
Coach Tara VanDerveer said. "She's very
tough to stop on the block, and we were
able to pass in to her."
Guard Jennifer Azzi added 13 points
and nine assists to the effort afler scoring
19 against the Redbirds, and Steding was
held to 14. But the Cardinal exhibited
generally good offense, rebounding from
a slow first half to come close to yet
another triple-digit game.
Behind several times in the first half
by two or three points, Stanford rallied
until a buzzer-beating 3-pointer by fresh
man Martha Richards gave the Cardinal
a 40-34 halftime lead. The team went on

a 15-2 run fresh out of the locker room,
however, and the momentum and advan
tage shifted permanently into the Cardi
nal corner.
"I thought we played hard against a
team with great depth and great ability,"
lowa Coach C. Vivian Stringer said. "We
gave it our best, but today our best just
wasn't good enough."
"They're a great team, believe me,"
Stringer said of Stanford. "They're so
fast and shoot the ball so well. I can't
recognize a weakness. They've got every
thing."
Well, almost everything. The one miss
ing ingredient, rebounding, did not prove
problematic against the Hawkeyes but
was fatal against the Techsters.
Senior Evon Asforis seemed to carry
the board burden alone, grabbing 13 in
the lowa game to complement 10 points.
Against defending NCAA champion Lou-
isiana Tech, however, her 11 were
not enough to bridge a 51-38 gap
that contributed to the Cardinal's
defeat.
"I think they were very physical
on the boards," VanDerveer said
of the home team. "They did a
good job of positioning under
there."
The post, in fact, was where
the Techsters flourished. Sparked
by Venus Lacy (20 points and 11
rebounds) and All-American Nora
Lewis (18 points, 13 boards), the
Techsters pounded Stanford in
side and limited Stevens to eight
points before she fouled out with
10:29 left to play.
Her exit proved to be a costly
disqualification for the Cardinal.
Stevens left just as she regained
her form, depriving Stanford of a
needed scorer to eclipse the 16-
point lead that Tech had extended
at halftime.
"There was a really critical call
with Trisha fouling out," VanDer
veer said. "We don't have anyone
who can do the job that she does
on the block. We had a real prob
lem once she was out of the
game."
Before she fouled out as well,
Azzi did an admirable job of
decreasing the deficit. Shining on
national television as she had in
the ESPN-broadcast USC game,
the junior put in a career per
formance that certainly cemented
her place on the Kodak All-
American Team.
Shooting 11-for-17 from the

field, 4-for-5 from 3-point range
and 4-for-5 from the line, Azzi
amassed 30 points and six assists
before her forced exodus with 1:13
left in the game.
Seizing some of the point guard
responsibility from Soi\ja Hen
ning, she penetrated when she
needed to while also posing an
outside threat that the Techsters
could not counter. When the team
struggled, Azzi dominated.
"The Azzi girl is just a great
basketball player," Barmore said.
"We did everything we knew, and
she still got 30."
In the end, however, an Ail-
American was not enough. Stan
ford played fairly well, but Loui
siana Tech played better for
longer. Unburdened by the foul
trouble that hurt the Cardinal's
rhythm, the Techsters played ag
gressively and controlled the
glass, stifling Stanford's transi
tion game at the source.
"They really controlled the
boards," VanDerveer admitted. "I
don't know the count and didn't
have a calculator on the bench,
and I ran out of fingers to count.
They are a very physical team
and move people out.
"And it wasn't just their post
people rebounding. The first play
of the game was a rebound by
their point guard, the second by
their two guard. For us to be com
petitive on a Final Four level like
Louisiana Tech is, Tennessee is,
rebounding needs to be a key for
us."
Card notes
Azzi and Stevens were named to
the All-Regional Team, joining Lacy,

Lewis and LSU's Patricia Woods.
For those unfamiliar with Louisiana
geography, Ruston is located about 70
miles east of Shreveport, straight
down tree-lined Interstate 20.
For those still unfamiliar,
Shreveport (western Louisiana's an
swer to a booming metropolis) is quite
close to the Texas border. In fact, it
takes longer to drive to the San Fran
cisco Airport from Stanford than it
does to fly from Dallas to Shreveport.
According to the team's bus driver
Cal, the economy in Louisiana is ex
tremely depressed. In Shreveport, for
instance, a house that sold for
$150,000 five years ago would list for
$77,000 today. According to Steding,
a movie that would cost $6 in Palo
Alto can be attended for $3.50 in Rus
ton. In either case, dire straits, indeed.

Though far from the Farm, the Car
dinal enjoyed a surprisingly sizeable
contingent of supporters. In both
games, approximately 30 fans cheered
the team on across from the Stanford
bench, bolstering the efforts of the 25
band members, four Dollies and 10
members of the Axe Commit
tee/Cheering Squad.
After the La. Tech game, the latter
three groups pooled their efforts to
make a barbeque for the team. Apart
from rampant cheating in the Nerf
football game at midnight (eager par
ticipation not required), the Band
folks put on the swingingest shindig
Ruston has ever seen. No arrests were
made.
The most beautiful building in town
in the red brick structure housing a
school for the blind. As for the reason
ing behind this, you make the call.
