INDIANAPOLIS — The spon
taneous "LELAND" cheer
shouted from the Indianapolis
Natatorium's awards podium Sat
urday night was not in response

onship title, but, rather, sym
bolized the incredible team effort
the Cardinal put into earning the
men's swimming silver.

Men's Swimming
Cardinal second at NCAAs

Although a few mental errors
by Stanford and an almost flaw
less Texas performance allowed
the Longhorns to swim away with
its second consecutive NCAA
crown, Stanford's 396 points rep
resented the never-give-up atti
tude of the underdog Cardinal
squad.
While Texas, which finished
with 475 points, grabbed the team

lead during the first night of the
three-day meet and never looked
back, a number of fantastic Car
dinal swims and the squad's limit
less team spirit kept Stanford in
the hunt until the very end.
"We would have liked to have
won," distance freestyler Jason
Plummer said. "We did have some
people who didn't score when they
should have — myself included —
and it would have been closer. But
you can't take anything away
from Texas. They had no mis
takes."
"We swam really well even if
we did finish in second. I'm really
happy with our performance —
we fought until the end," back
stroker Rick Gould said.
The championship was
definitely a two-team meet. Mich
igan finished a distant third with
a team tally of 315. UCLA and
last season's runner-up Southern
California were close on the Wol
verines's heels with 313.5 and 304
points, respectively. California,
Florida, lowa, Tennessee and Ne
braska rounded out the top 10.

The Cardinal's performance at
the University of Indiana was
highlighted by an American
record, two individual titles, and
13 swimmers receiving All-
America honors.
While not able to walk away
with the national crown, Stanford
did write itself into the record
books at the competition. The
200-yard medley relay team of
Gould, Matt Rodgers, Jay Mor
tenson, and Jeff Garr clocked a
1:28.26 during preliminaries,
good for an American record. In
the finals, however, the squad was
edged out by Princeton and had
to settle for second-place points.
Although the distinction of
being the nation's second-best
team was earned by an entire
team effort, a number of individ
uals' performances stood out at
the national finals. Co-captain
John Witchel's swims not only
earned him the distinction of
being one of the top all-around
American swimmers, but also
kept the Cardinal battling to the
end.

After placing fourth in the 500
freestyle Thursday in 4:15.63, .04
faster than his victorious swim a
year ago almost beating new 200
freestyle U.S. Open record-holder
Artur Wojdat in the 200 event
Friday night, and swimming a leg
on the third-place 800 freestyle
relay, Witchel swam the race of
his life Saturday morning.
The junior lopped over eight
seconds off his best time to clock
a 14:49.69 and earn a silver in
the mile race. "I knew John would
give everything that he had but
I'm just blown away by his time,"
fellow miler Plummer said.
Not only did Witchel score
points for his teammates, in fact
earning the fifth highest point
total of any swimmer, he also in
fluenced their swims Saturday
evening. After a slower than ex
pected morning Saturday, the
squad came alive in the evening
events.
Gould won the 200 back con
solation finals. Plummer took
fourth and fellow freshman Alex
Kostich 10th in the 1,650 free
style. And Rouse helped keep the
Cardinal in the race, bringing the
squad to within 32 points of
Texas.
Freshman jitters did not affect
the backstroker. After being edged
out by American record-holder
David Berkoff in the 100 back
stroke, Rouse went one step fur
ther, winning the 200 backstroke
Saturday night. And the first-year
competitor was on pace to set an
American record as well if he had
not jammed his final turn.
Rouse's 1.44.87 was merely the
second fastest time ever recorded.
The other Stanford individual
victor was co-Captain Jay Mor
tenson. The senior successfully de
fended his 100-meter butterfly
title, chopping .13 off of last
season's victorious time to win in
47.14. Mortenson also swam legs
on both second-place medley relay
squads, although he was unable
to repeat last year's double vic
tory, finishing eighth in the 100
backstroke.
Sprinter Garr was another in
dividual standout, breaking the
Stanford 50 free record three
times in one day. His 19.95 clock
ing in the finals earned him a
sixth-place finish in the event-
He was also joined by Doug Lil
lydahl, John Hodge, and Byron
Burson in placing third in the
new 200 freestyle relay, and swam
in both medley relay events.

Junior John Witchell took a second In the 1,650 freestyle yesterday In the final day of the NCAA

Gould joined Garr on the All-

ninth in the 200 event, the medley
relay was out-touched by Texas
for a second, the 800 freestyle
relay took third, and the 400 free
style relay concluded the meet,

with the Cardinal finishing
fourth.
In the other half of the cham
pionships — diving — Mike Bur
ton became the first Stanford
diver to score as a sophomore,
finishing 13th in the platform
competition.
"We had a really strong meet.
We swam really well and there's
no looking back. It was a great
year and we're already looking for
ward to winning next season,"
Rouse said.

Men's Swimming
Cardinal second at NCAAs

Although a few mental errors
by Stanford and an almost flaw
less Texas performance allowed
the Longhorns to swim away with
its second consecutive NCAA
crown, Stanford's 396 points rep
resented the never-give-up atti
tude of the underdog Cardinal
squad.
While Texas, which finished
with 475 points, grabbed the team

lead during the first night of the
three-day meet and never looked
back, a number of fantastic Car
dinal swims and the squad's limit
less team spirit kept Stanford in
the hunt until the very end.
"We would have liked to have
won," distance freestyler Jason
Plummer said. "We did have some
people who didn't score when they
should have — myself included —
and it would have been closer. But
you can't take anything away
from Texas. They had no mis
takes."
"We swam really well even if
we did finish in second. I'm really
happy with our performance —
we fought until the end," back
stroker Rick Gould said.
The championship was
definitely a two-team meet. Mich
igan finished a distant third with
a team tally of 315. UCLA and
last season's runner-up Southern
California were close on the Wol
verines's heels with 313.5 and 304
points, respectively. California,
Florida, lowa, Tennessee and Ne
braska rounded out the top 10.

The Cardinal's performance at
the University of Indiana was
highlighted by an American
record, two individual titles, and
13 swimmers receiving All-
America honors.
While not able to walk away
with the national crown, Stanford
did write itself into the record
books at the competition. The
200-yard medley relay team of
Gould, Matt Rodgers, Jay Mor
tenson, and Jeff Garr clocked a
1:28.26 during preliminaries,
good for an American record. In
the finals, however, the squad was
edged out by Princeton and had
to settle for second-place points.
Although the distinction of
being the nation's second-best
team was earned by an entire
team effort, a number of individ
uals' performances stood out at
the national finals. Co-captain
John Witchel's swims not only
earned him the distinction of
being one of the top all-around
American swimmers, but also
kept the Cardinal battling to the
end.

After placing fourth in the 500
freestyle Thursday in 4:15.63, .04
faster than his victorious swim a
year ago almost beating new 200
freestyle U.S. Open record-holder
Artur Wojdat in the 200 event
Friday night, and swimming a leg
on the third-place 800 freestyle
relay, Witchel swam the race of
his life Saturday morning.
The junior lopped over eight
seconds off his best time to clock
a 14:49.69 and earn a silver in
the mile race. "I knew John would
give everything that he had but
I'm just blown away by his time,"
fellow miler Plummer said.
Not only did Witchel score
points for his teammates, in fact
earning the fifth highest point
total of any swimmer, he also in
fluenced their swims Saturday
evening. After a slower than ex
pected morning Saturday, the
squad came alive in the evening
events.
Gould won the 200 back con
solation finals. Plummer took
fourth and fellow freshman Alex
Kostich 10th in the 1,650 free
style. And Rouse helped keep the
Cardinal in the race, bringing the
squad to within 32 points of
Texas.
Freshman jitters did not affect
the backstroker. After being edged
out by American record-holder
David Berkoff in the 100 back
stroke, Rouse went one step fur
ther, winning the 200 backstroke
Saturday night. And the first-year
competitor was on pace to set an
American record as well if he had
not jammed his final turn.
Rouse's 1.44.87 was merely the
second fastest time ever recorded.
The other Stanford individual
victor was co-Captain Jay Mor
tenson. The senior successfully de
fended his 100-meter butterfly
title, chopping .13 off of last
season's victorious time to win in
47.14. Mortenson also swam legs
on both second-place medley relay
squads, although he was unable
to repeat last year's double vic
tory, finishing eighth in the 100
backstroke.
Sprinter Garr was another in
dividual standout, breaking the
Stanford 50 free record three
times in one day. His 19.95 clock
ing in the finals earned him a
sixth-place finish in the event-
He was also joined by Doug Lil
lydahl, John Hodge, and Byron
Burson in placing third in the
new 200 freestyle relay, and swam
in both medley relay events.


Richard Murphy — Daily file
Junior John Witchell took a second In the 1,650 freestyle yesterday In the final day of the NCAA
meet. Stanford took second overall.
Gould joined Garr on the All-
America list, placing sixth in the
100 backstroke in addition to his
ninth in the 200 event, the medley
relay was out-touched by Texas
for a second, the 800 freestyle
relay took third, and the 400 free
style relay concluded the meet,

with the Cardinal finishing
fourth.
In the other half of the cham
pionships — diving — Mike Bur
ton became the first Stanford
diver to score as a sophomore,
finishing 13th in the platform
competition.
"We had a really strong meet.
We swam really well and there's
no looking back. It was a great
year and we're already looking for
ward to winning next season,"
Rouse said.
