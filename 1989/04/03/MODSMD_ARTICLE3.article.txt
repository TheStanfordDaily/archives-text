# Possible prank taints University runoff water
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
What was probably a prank has alerted
the University to the possibility that some
campus runoff water is contaminated with
toxic metals.
Last Wednesday, red dye was poured into
an open storm sewer that runs along Serra
Street, turning the water in the ditch be
tween Campus Drive and El Camino Real
a blood-red color.
Pranksters are probably behind the in
cident, according to Ralph Buchanan, a top
Health and Safety official for the Univer
sity. Cleanup will cost at least $30,000 to
$40,000, he said.
Preliminary tests completed Friday
showed that the cause of the red color was
a harmless dye, but officials were surprised
when tests also turned up toxic metals in
the water.
If more comprehensive tests today con
firm that toxics are present, the University
will have to treat the water as hazardous
waste and spend an additional $20,000 to
dispose of it.
Initial tests on the polluted water per
formed by the Stanford Health and Safety
Department indicate the dye was rhotamine

B, a fairly harmless chemical used for many
applications, including dying cotton and
detecting certain heavy metals.
One of several samples of the water sent
out to another lab for further testing con
tained high concentrations of heavy metals,
including lead. Water tainted with a suffi
cient quantity of heavy metals can be
poisonous.
According to Buchanan, the toxic metals
present in the water might be a result of
runoff from pavement pelted with rain.
Starting late Wednesday afternoon and
continuing until Friday, Health and Safety
officials filled five 5,000-gallon tanker
trucks with the contaminated water. They
are keeping the trucks in a campus parking
lot until final lab results show whether it
is hazardous waste.
Inge Harding-Barlowe, a toxicologist and
member of the Barron Park Association,
a group of local residents that has long
been concerned with water pollution, said
she was dismayed at the amount of time
it took for the Department of Health and
Safety to have even preliminary test
results. The preliminary findings from the
outside lab were not available until Friday,
two full days after the red dye was reported.
