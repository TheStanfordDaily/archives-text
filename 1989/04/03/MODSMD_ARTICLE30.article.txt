### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
For only the second time this
season, the Cardinal women
netters actually needed to play
a doubles match in order to
clinch a dual-meet victory.
That need arose Friday, in the
second of a three-meet series
held on the Florida campus in
Gainesville.

Cardinal wins three

Not to worry, though. Stan
ford got the doubles win it
needed and captured all three
matches while upping its
season record to 17-0.
Thursday, Stanford beat
Clemson 8-0, recording its 11th
shutout of the season. The next
day, the nation's No. 1-ranked
team vanquished No. 2 Florida
in the aforementioned match
by a 5-4 score. It was the Car
dinal's second win this season
over Florida and a likely
preview of the NCAA champi
onship final.
Finally, the team went back
to its "No Dubs Required"
ways in burying No. 7 Miami
6-1.
The match against the Tigers
Thursday was no contest. Led
by Ail-American Tami Whit
linger, the nation's top-rated
singles player, the singles por
tion was a breeze. Whitlinger
gave little to Cathy Hofer,
ranked 68th, in defeating her
6-0, 6-0.
None of the other Cardinal
players allowed her opponent
to win more than four games.
Sandra Birch defeated Diana
VanGulick 6-1, 6-0; Lisa Green
drubbed Julie Davis 6-1, 6-2;
Debbie Graham beat Mimi
Borgus 6-1, 6-3; Teri Whit
linger destroyed Lori Stephan
6-1, 6-0; and Kylie Johnson
scored a 6-0, 6-2 win over Tara
Lynch.
In the doubles, Graham-
Birch beat Borgus-VanGulick
6-0, 6-2. Green teamed with
senior captain Cindy
Buchsbaum to win 6-1, 6-3.
Friday, things got interest
ing. Still smarting from their
6-0 defeat at the hands of the
Cardinal in the National In

doors on March 5, the Gators
were ready for Stanford.
Though Tami Whitlinger
scored a straight-set, 6-4, 6-4
win over Nicole Arendt, the na
tion's llth-rated player, In
gelise Driehuis won a tough
three-setter from Birch at No.
2, 6-7 (3-7), 6-2, 6-4.
Green survived a third-set
tiebreaker to beat Andrea
Berger 6-3, 1-6, 7-6 (7-5).
Graham bested Holly Lloyd 7-
5, 6-3 and Teri Whitlinger han
dled Holly Danforth 6-2, 6-3.
But Buchsbaum lost to Siob
han Nicholson 3-6, 6-4, 6-0 at
No. 6 to leave the score at Stan
ford 4, Florida 2 heading into
doubles.
Graham-Birch lost to
Arendt-Nicholson 6-3, 6-2.
Danforth and Jillian Alexander
drubbed Green-Buchsbaum 6-
0, 6-3. The Whitlingers, how
ever, assured the Stanford
team win with a 6-2, 6-4 best
ing of Driehuis and Cathy
Goodrich.
The close match against
Florida didn't get the better of
the mentally-tough Cardinal
the next day at all. Despite the
Hurricanes lofty ranking, all
they could manage was a lone
singles victory at No. 6.
Buchsbaum suffered her
second-stright defeat in a loss
to Rona Daniels 7-6, 6-2.
Tami Whitlinger kept her
perfect record alive, however,
with a 6-2, 6-2 toasting of Jen
nifer Young. Birch shook off
her defeat of a day before in
pasting Liz Levinson 6-3, 6-3.
Green returned to form with a
6-0, 6-2 triumph over Kerri
Reiter.
Graham, who is taking the
term freshman sensation to a
whole new level, left Jami
Yonekura in the dust 6-0, 6-4.
Teri Whitlinger displayed All-
America form in a 6-3, 6-1 win
over Erica Winston.
In the lone doubles match,
Graham and Birch battled with
Levinson and Young for three
sets before earning a 7-6, 3-6,
6-3 victory.
Card notes
The Cardinal's next matches are
on the road against San Diego
State, USC and UCLA.

the same courts where Stanford
