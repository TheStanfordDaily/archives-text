# Baseball splits with L.A. schools

Here's how Brian Johnson
broke out of his early-season
slump:
"I stopped listening to every
body, tried to stay basic and just
hit the ball," he said.

Cardinal wins four of seven

"After you win two national
championships, the pressure to
win is enormous. And when you
don't win, everybody asks why,"
he continued. The Stanford base
ball team has finally stopped ask
ing itself why and just started to
play ball.
After losing two of three to
Pacific 10 Southern Division door
mat UCLA, Stanford came back
to beat San Francisco State and
take two of three from USC this
weekend. The USC series is the
first that the Cardinal has won
since it swept Loyola Marymount
back in early February.
Stanford's record now stands
at 16-18, 5-10 in the Pacific 10
Southern Division. The Bruins
took two of three from California
this weekend to improve their
conference record to 5-10 and
move themselves into a last-place
tie with the Cardinal.
Unlike the Bay Area's persis
tent drought, Stanford's season
long offensive dry spell was bro

ken this weekend by the lightning
bats of Roger Burnett, Jack Hollis
and Brian Johnson. In his last
seven games, Burnett has ex
ploded for three home runs while
Hollis raised his average 35 points
during the week.
"I can't say enough about Hol
lis," Stanford Coach Mark Mar
quess said. "He's relly helped us.
And Burnett made a couple of
adjustments at UCLA so he's not
chasing as many bad balls."
Johnson capped off a six-run
first inning yesterday against
USC with his third home run of
the year, a two-run shot. The Car
dinal went on to bury the Trojans
15-5 with its best offensive per
formance this season, a 15-hit
barrage.
According to Marquess, the key
to scoring so many runs yesterday
was scoring most of the runners
that reached base. Stanford only
left six runners stranded in the
game.
"We had guys on base and we
scored 'em most of the time.
That's what we haven't done so
far and I'm pleased with that,"
he said.
Stanford took the opening game
against USC 9-2 behind a fine
pitching performance by Stan
Spencer, who earned his second
win against five losses. On Sat
urday the Cardinal was shellacked
12-5 and freshman Steve Worrell,
pitching in only his second game
since being sidelined by tendonitis
last month, took the loss.

But just as he did in the last
game against Arizona three weeks
ago, Steve Chitren, who is nor
mally Marquess' stopper out of
the bullpen, turned in a heroic
performance as the starting
pitcher. Chitren lasted eight in
nings, surrendering five runs on
nine hits and striking out a
career-high 10 batters.
"If we get to the point where
we haven't used (Chitren) in the
first two games of a series, we're
going to start him," Marquess
said, adding, "he's a great com
petitor."
"We've taken that small step
and won a series," Marquess said.
"Now that some of them are hit
ting, they don't put as much pres
sure on themselves."
Card note
Yesterday's Stanford Pub Trivia
Quiz winner was none other than
Cosko Twissleman, who said he was
named after two exits on Interstate
5 between San Francisco and Los An
geles.
