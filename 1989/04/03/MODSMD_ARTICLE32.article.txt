# Azzi an All-American
## 
### 
While 1989 has been a good
year for Stanford basketball, it
has been even better for Jen
nifer Azzi.
Capping off her finest season
on the Farm, Azzi became the
only junior named to this
year's Kodak Division I All-
America Team, one of the most
prestigious honors in collegiate
women's basketball.
The Oak Ridge, Tenn., native
joins Maryland's Vicky Bullett
and Deanna Tate, Tennessee's
Bridgette Gordon, Louisiana
Tech's Nora Lewis, Ohio
State's Nikita Lowry, Auburn's
Vicki Orr, San Diego State's

Chana Perry, Texas' Clarissa
Davis and Long Beach State's
Penny Toler.
Guiding the Cardinal to a
No. 4 ranking in the final As
sociated Press poll and into the
Elite Eight of the NCAA Tour
nament, Azzi averaged over 16
points and six assists per game.
More importantly on the na
tional scene, in the two Stan
ford games broadcast on ESPN
(USC at Maples Pavilion and
Louisiana Tech in the regional
final), she played her career
best ball, scoring personal-high
totals of 25 and 30 points
respectively.
