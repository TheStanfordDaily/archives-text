# Top-ranked spikers win three of four
## 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
The well-oiled machine that is the
Stanford men's volleyball team rolled
into Spring Break on top of the volley
ball world, occupying the No. 1 spots
in both the Western Intercollegiate Vol
leyball Association regular season
standings and the national poll at the
outset of the midseason respite.
However, while the majority of Stan
ford's students were unwinding after
finals, the Cardinal spikers found their
heads on the chopping block. In the
four games that the volleyball team
played over the break, the wheels on
the Cardinal machine fell off, or, at
best, were flat. The squad did manage
to eke out three victories but was upset
by Long Beach State in the other con
test.
Indeed, the transition back to com
petitive play has not been as smooth as

Coaches Fred Sturm and Ruben Nieves
would have liked. The Cardinal spikers,
though not particularly crisp, upended
the visiting Ohio State Buckeyes in
three games on March 25 before going
on a WTVA road trip that would turn
out to be particularly grueling.
On March 29, the three-match road
stretch got under way at Long Beach.
At the outset of the match, it appeared
as if the 49ers were going to make
things easy on the Cardinal; Stanford
won the first game handily and subse
quently jumped out to an 11-4 advantage
in game two. But then the match, as
well as Stanford's dream season, took
a turn for the worse.
The 49ers mounted an incredible
comeback and stole the game 17-15.
The Cardinal, paralyzed by the upstart
Long Beach squad, was rattled and,
despite a valiant effort, folded up its
tent and succumbed in four games.
A shocker. A completely unfathomable

upset. Stunning.
Well, no, not really. The loss marked
the fourth straight year that the Car
dinal has come away from Long Beach
empty-handed. Thoughts of late-season
collapse no doubt haunted the Cardinal
players, and a strong showing against
San Diego State in the next match was
absolutely imperative.
And that's exactly what Stanford got.
The Cardinal "came out strong and was
the aggressor," according to Asst. Coach
Nieves, and riding the 24 kills and .370
hitting percentage of Dan Hanan and
the .708 percentage of Duncan Black
man, the Cardinal won in four games.
With that victory under its belt, the
Cardinal hoped to sweep into Irvine for
the fourth and final match of the trip
and put forth its best performance of
the road trip. As it turned out the Car
dinal may have, according to Nieves,
played its worst.
