# Boskin leads a strong field of Hoover director candidates
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Hoover Institution is looking
for a new director to replace W.
Glenn Campbell, and from all ap
pearances, Economics Prof. Mi
chael Boskin is the leading
candidate for the job.
Several anonymous sources put
Boskin on the top of Hoover's list,
but Boskin has another job back
East — one that doesn't pay as
well as the Hoover directorship,
but carries plenty of power and
prestige. He is chief economic ad
viser to President Bush, and his
workplace at 1600 Pennsylvania
Ave. seems to suit Boskin just
fine.
In an interview with The Daily
in his Washington office, Boskin
said he would refuse the Hoover
directorship. That was Thursday.
The next day, Boskin interviewed
for the Hoover job by telephone,
according to a Daily source.
This is not the first time Boskin
has been cagey about talk of a
new job. When rumors about
Bush's choice for chief economic
adviser hit the press, Boskin
denied that he had been selected.
Boskin told The Daily on Thurs-

day that he would
not leave his cur
rent job because
he has made a
commitment to
Bush to remain
chair of the Coun
cil of Economic
Advisers, a post
he took in Janu
ary. But outgoing

Hoover Director Campbell, who is
not involved in the search for his
replacement, says Boskin only
promised to stay with the admin
istration until January 1991. Bos
kin may stay in the capital for
the next two years while an acting
director is in charge, one Hoover
source speculated.
About Boskin, and the rest of
the candidates, the search com
mittee members interviewed by
The Daily offered only broad
statements about the search for
a new director. Ramon Myers, a
Hoover senior research fellow on
the committee, said they had the
number down to about a dozen.
Interviewing candidates
But according to information
obtained by The Daily, the search
committee has recently inter

viewed two finalists for the job,
and will interview four more by
the end of the week.
The search committee inter
viewed Boskin by phone on Friday.
He was scheduled to be here for
an interview and to speak at the
Commonwealth Club in San Fran
cisco, but he had to change his
plans and stayed in Washington.
Also on Friday, the committee
wined, dined and interviewed Mi
chael Walker, 44, executive direc
tor of the Fraser Institute in
Vancouver, Canada. The Fraser
Institute is the Canadian equiva
lent to Hoover, but it lacks the
endowment and the extensive li
brary that Hoover boasts.
The Daily has learned that on
Friday and Saturday, the commit
tee plans to interview four more
finalists:
• John Raisian, 39, Hoover's
deputy director — Raisian does
not have the extensive fund
raising experience, but seems to
get along well with the University
administration.
• John Deutsch, 49, provost of
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology — The San Jose Mer
cury News speculated that this
choice was a personal favorite of

Stanford Provost James Rosse.
Note the similarity of their titles.
Rosse has declined to talk about
specific candidates for the post.
• Christopher DeMuth, 42,
president of the American Enter
prise Institute, a conservative
think tank in New York City —
A secretary for DeMuth insisted
that he has no intention of leaving
his current position.
• Robert Michael, 47, National
Opinion Research Center, an af
filiate of the University of Chicago
— The center boasts it is the
"oldest national research facility
established to do social research
in the public interest."
According to a recent article in
the Mercury News, a number of
other candidates have been, or are
being, considered. From the above
list, the Mercury News listed Bos
kin, Walker, Raisian, Deutsch and
DeMuth, but not Michael.
Other speculation
The Mercury News reported
from "a source close to the
search" the additional possibili
ties:
• Joseph Nye, 52, director of
Harvard's Center for Science and
International Affairs — Nve is a

Democrat and a former adviser
to presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis. Many critics of the think
tank are skeptical Hoover is ever
going to lean that far to the left
in the near future.
• Henry Rowen, 63, senior fel
low at Hoover — Rowen will be

come 65 in 1990, and the
Unversity has insisted that Camp
bell is being ousted because of a
University policy to retire 65-
year-old administrators. This
policy seems to eliminate Rowen


Boskin
