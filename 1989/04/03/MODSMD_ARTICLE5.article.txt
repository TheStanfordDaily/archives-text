If Hoover Tower had lips,
they would now be tightly
sealed â€” well, they are sup
posed to be, anyway.
The Hoover Institution is in
the market for a new director,
and nobody is supposed to
know who is going to take over
the job currently held by W.
Glenn Campbell, soon to turn
65, when he steps down in Au
gust.
"There is a great deal of ner
vousness and tension about my
successor," said Campbell, who
is not a member of the search

committee, in an interview
Thursday.
A spectator might say most
of the "nervousness and ten

tween Campbell's office and
the University president's of
fice. To say the least, Campbell
is reluctant to leave his position
as director, and he has battled
University administrators
about his ouster.
"I always do," Campbell said
about putting up a good fight
with the administration. "I'm
enjoying it to no end."
