# Can you keep a secret?
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
If Hoover Tower had lips,
they would now be tightly
sealed — well, they are sup
posed to be, anyway.
The Hoover Institution is in
the market for a new director,
and nobody is supposed to
know who is going to take over
the job currently held by W.
Glenn Campbell, soon to turn
65, when he steps down in Au
gust.
"There is a great deal of ner
vousness and tension about my
successor," said Campbell, who
is not a member of the search

committee, in an interview
Thursday.
A spectator might say most
of the "nervousness and ten
sion" seems to be flowing be
tween Campbell's office and
the University president's of
fice. To say the least, Campbell
is reluctant to leave his position
as director, and he has battled
University administrators
about his ouster.
"I always do," Campbell said
about putting up a good fight
with the administration. "I'm
enjoying it to no end."
As the old warrior sits in his
11th floor office in the Tower
enjoying himself, people down
below speculate — with hushed
voices — about who will be the
next director.
Only the search committee is
supposed to know who they are
interviewing to succeed Campbell
— at least that is what the search
committee would like to think.
Hoover senior fellow Gerald
Dorfman, who heads the search
committee, has been trying to
keep the whole process under
wraps.
Dorfman insists he is a "chatty"
fellow, and says he will talk about
the San Francisco Giants or most
any other subject. About the
search, however, Dorfman will not
speak in anything but the vaguest
terms.

Despite his best attempts,
though, Dorfman has not been
successful at stopping the leaks
in the Hoover wails, unlike the
little Dutch boy with his dike.
In the past month, the San Jose
Mercury News twice published a
list of candidates for the job. The
first list, published March 8, con
tained 15 people from inside and
outside Hoover. The second arti
cle, published March 25, named
nine people, some who were on
the previous Mercury News list
and others who were not.
The published lists still caused
quite a stir in the search commit
tee.
Committee members — at least
the majority of them — have been
trying to keep the whole affair
under a dark veil of secrecy.
No words in public about the
search, no notes left lying around
for their secretaries to see, and
certainly no talking to the press.

The issue of secrecy has been
a delicate one among people close
to the search committee. Speaking
of her boss who is involved in the
search, one secretary said defen
sively: "He would swear on a stack
of Bibles that he would never leak
anything to the press."
"Oftentimes the candidates are
people who are worried about
premature discussion of their can
didacy," said University Provost
James Rosse, also a member of
the committee. "It's just a bad
policy to make it public."
All we can be assured of, com
mittee members say, is that the
next director will be a good one.
"We think we can find a fine di
rector," Dorfman said.
Campbell had another opinion
about whoever the next director
would be. He guessed his succes
sor probably would not be "as
good as the current one,"
