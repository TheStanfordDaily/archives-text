# Lake Lag lovers are out of luck
## University may have to cut water use by 25 percent 
### Eric Young Editorial staff 
Frequent March rains and a
melting snowpack in the Sierra
Nevada Mountains will not make
up for the unusually prolonged
dryness in this area and will leave
Lake Lagunita, campus fountains
and perhaps the campus commu
nity begging for a drink.
A San Francisco Water District

decision later this month may
cause the University to cut water
use by up to 25 percent, based on
1987 consumption levels, accord
ing to a Stanford Operations and
Maintenance manager.
But while campus residents may
need to limit water use, campus
plants this spring will suck up all
the water they want. Stanford's
greenery benefits from a full Felt
Lake, Stanford's irrigation water

storehouse located in the Stanford
Foothills.
Last year ground crews cut back
on irrigation from 20 to 30 per
cent, causing some areas of
campus to become brown but not
inflicting serious long-term
damage.
Rainfall usually fills Lagunita
each year, but according to Cheryl
Jensen, who oversees campus
water use, "no miracle occurred"
this year and the lake did not fill
naturally. She said she believed
water could be used elsewhere, so
she decided against filling it ar
tificially, "which may not be the
world's most popular decision,"
she admitted.
The lake has not remained com
pletely empty since the late 19705,
according to Jensen.
Of the University's nine foun
tains eight will be turned off —
at least until San Francisco
decides whether to impose water
rationing on the University. Her
bert Fong, campus grounds man
ager, explained that the fountains
will probably remain dry regard
less of the city's decision because

the water is needed elsewhere.
Currently only Terman Engineer
ing fountain is in use.
Stanford buys most of its drink
able water from San Francisco,
which, in turn, gets much of its
drinking water from the snow
that melts into Hetch Hetchy Res
ervoir, about 160 miles east of
the city at the base of the Sierras.
San Francisco water conserva
tion administrator Matt Mullan
said Thursday it is still too early
to predict how much water will
be available for the city, and thus
for Stanford.
According to Mullan, the
amount of water the city receives
depends largely on how fast the
snow melts. Mullan said the city
must give up water after April 15
to other districts that have
greater claim and "superior
rights" to use the water for ir
rigation, including Modesto and
Turlock districts.

The amount of rain and run-off
before then, however, determines
how much water San Francisco
can sell to Stanford and its other
buyers, and both will benefit from
getting as much water as possible
in the next week.
The San Francisco Water Dis
trict will present its recommenda
tions on water use to the city's
Public Utilities Commission April
11. Then, at a April 15 public
hearing, the commission will hand
down its final decision on the
amount of water San Francisco
can sell to its water districts.
Jim Cooney, general manager
of the San Francisco Water Dis
trict, said Friday he would not
"make a call on less than 25 per
cent reduction" imposed on dis
tricts that buy the city's water.
He added that depending on the
Sierra snowpack, the situation
"could get better."
