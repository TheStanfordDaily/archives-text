# SCLC seeks a clearer Standard interpretation

In February, Student Conduct
Legislative Council Chair C eorge
Parker predicted that the Stan
ford community would find
"nothing close to provocative" in
his council's proposed interpreta
tions of the Fundamental Stand
ard regarding diversity and free
speech.
Parker's guess was wrong.

So wrong, in fact, that the low
key but persuasive protests of
University officials, scholars and
students have convinced the 12-
member council that its proposal
was not specific enough and
reached too far in limiting expres
sion.
The council has buried its
original proposal and will begin
the legislative process anew in its
meeting tonight.
Parker — with help from Law
Prof. Thomas Grey, a consultant
to the council — has already writ
ten a new draft, which the council
will discuss today. Parker's pro
posal, not yet released, would
define the types of expression that
violate the Fundamental Standard
more explicitly than the original
proposal, said Judicial Affairs Of
ficer Sally Cole, a non-voting
council member.
Incidents at Otero and Ujamaa
House last year, where free ex
pression and respectful behavior
clashed, prompted the council —
composed of six professors, five
students and one administrator —
to spend more than four months
formulating a two-page proposal
seeking to limit freedom of ex
pression in certain circumstances.
Parker, a professor in the Grad
uate School of Business, said the
council did not receive one letter
of support from the Stanford com
munity during a 21-day comment
period which began March 1.
From the dozens of letters of

opposition emerged a consensus
that although the council at
tempted to clarify an ambiguous
Fundamental Standard, the group
jeopardized the University's infor
mal yet operative commitment to
First Amendment rights.
Briefly, the withdrawn proposal
states that students may maintain
whatever opinions they like, so
long as they do not attack indi
viduals with "personal abuse" in
volving "obscenities, epithets and
other forms of expression that by
accepted community standards
degrade, victimize, stigmatize or
peijoratively characterize them on
the basis of personal, cultural or
intellectual diversity."
A similar statement bars
"defamation of groups" based on
"personal or cultural differences."
Cole said last month, "There
are ways to express beliefs with
out hurting other people. The leg
islation would restrict not the
content of expression, but the
form one expresses it in."
However, the line between con
tent and form of expression may
be less clear-cut than Cole per
ceives.
In a dense, six-page letter to
Parker, Law Prof. Gerald Gun

ther, an expert in First Amend
ment law, cited one "well
established" principle articulated
by Supreme Court Justice John
Marshall Harlan: "We cannot in
dulge in the facile assumption
that one can forbid particular
words without also running the
substantial risk of suppressing
ideas in the process."
Gunther, who is Jewish, said he
has been "subjected to vehement
anti-Semitic remarks.... I can as
sure you that they hurt."
University President Donald
Kennedy told the Faculty Senate
last month that he finds the cur
rent draft "defective" and that
"we must exercise the greatest
caution lest we pursue an end to
bigotry by legislating against
thoughts, ideas and their expres
sion."
Kennedy added that he hopes
the council's final policy will not
compel him to use his reserved
veto power over regulations
governing student conduct.
Law Prof. William Cohen, also
an expert in First Amendment
law, wrote a detailed statement
pointing out specific parts of the
proposal that disturbed him.

While he emphasized that "it
is not my position that any
prohibition of personal verbal
abuse is inconsistent with freedom
of expression," Cohen said restric
tions should be confined to
" 'profanity and epithets' that are
directed to an identified individual
and that are intended to stig
matize that person with reference
to race, national origin, religion,
sexual orientation or gender."
The section prohibiting certain
attacks on groups should be elim
inated altogether because its
scope is too broad, Cohen said,
explaining that "it could become
a sword to challenge assigned
readings in courses, the showing
of films on campus or the message
of certain speakers."
Both Gunther and Cohen said
they believed the council's regu
lations would violate the First
Amendment.
The cogent letters have stopped
the proposed legislation at the
very first step of a lengthy enact
ment process. Any proposal must
undergo several comment periods
like the one last month, which
allow the council to gauge com
munity reaction.

inated altogether because its
scope is too broad, Cohen said,
explaining that "it could become
a sword to challenge assigned
readings in courses, the showing
of films on campus or the message
of certain speakers."
Both Gunther and Cohen said
they believed the council's regu
lations would violate the First
Amendment.
The cogent letters have stopped
the proposed legislation at the
very first step of a lengthy enact
ment process. Any proposal must
undergo several comment periods
like the one last month, which
allow the council to gauge com
munity reaction.
In February, Student Conduct
Legislative Council Chair C eorge
Parker predicted that the Stan
ford community would find
"nothing close to provocative" in
his council's proposed interpreta
tions of the Fundamental Stand
ard regarding diversity and free
speech.
Parker's guess was wrong.

So wrong, in fact, that the low
key but persuasive protests of
University officials, scholars and
students have convinced the 12-
member council that its proposal
was not specific enough and
reached too far in limiting expres
sion.
The council has buried its
original proposal and will begin
the legislative process anew in its
meeting tonight.
Parker — with help from Law
Prof. Thomas Grey, a consultant
to the council — has already writ
ten a new draft, which the council
will discuss today. Parker's pro
posal, not yet released, would
define the types of expression that
violate the Fundamental Standard
more explicitly than the original
proposal, said Judicial Affairs Of
ficer Sally Cole, a non-voting
council member.
Incidents at Otero and Ujamaa
House last year, where free ex
pression and respectful behavior
clashed, prompted the council —
composed of six professors, five
students and one administrator —
to spend more than four months
formulating a two-page proposal
seeking to limit freedom of ex
pression in certain circumstances.
Parker, a professor in the Grad
uate School of Business, said the
council did not receive one letter
of support from the Stanford com
munity during a 21-day comment
period which began March 1.
From the dozens of letters of

opposition emerged a consensus
that although the council at
tempted to clarify an ambiguous
Fundamental Standard, the group
jeopardized the University's infor
mal yet operative commitment to
First Amendment rights.
Briefly, the withdrawn proposal
states that students may maintain
whatever opinions they like, so
long as they do not attack indi
viduals with "personal abuse" in
volving "obscenities, epithets and
other forms of expression that by
accepted community standards
degrade, victimize, stigmatize or
peijoratively characterize them on
the basis of personal, cultural or
intellectual diversity."
A similar statement bars
"defamation of groups" based on
"personal or cultural differences."
Cole said last month, "There
are ways to express beliefs with
out hurting other people. The leg
islation would restrict not the
content of expression, but the
form one expresses it in."
However, the line between con
tent and form of expression may
be less clear-cut than Cole per
ceives.
In a dense, six-page letter to
Parker, Law Prof. Gerald Gun

ther, an expert in First Amend
ment law, cited one "well
established" principle articulated
by Supreme Court Justice John
Marshall Harlan: "We cannot in
dulge in the facile assumption
that one can forbid particular
words without also running the
substantial risk of suppressing
ideas in the process."
Gunther, who is Jewish, said he
has been "subjected to vehement
anti-Semitic remarks.... I can as
sure you that they hurt."
University President Donald
Kennedy told the Faculty Senate
last month that he finds the cur
rent draft "defective" and that
"we must exercise the greatest
caution lest we pursue an end to
bigotry by legislating against
thoughts, ideas and their expres
sion."
Kennedy added that he hopes
the council's final policy will not
compel him to use his reserved
veto power over regulations
governing student conduct.
Law Prof. William Cohen, also
an expert in First Amendment
law, wrote a detailed statement
pointing out specific parts of the
proposal that disturbed him.

While he emphasized that "it
is not my position that any
prohibition of personal verbal
abuse is inconsistent with freedom
of expression," Cohen said restric
tions should be confined to
" 'profanity and epithets' that are
directed to an identified individual
and that are intended to stig
matize that person with reference
to race, national origin, religion,
sexual orientation or gender."
The section prohibiting certain
attacks on groups should be elim
inated altogether because its
scope is too broad, Cohen said,
explaining that "it could become
a sword to challenge assigned
readings in courses, the showing
of films on campus or the message
of certain speakers."
Both Gunther and Cohen said

lations would violate the First
