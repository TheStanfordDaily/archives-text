# Rolling quake shakes South Bay

As Earthquake Awareness
Week kicked off yesterday at Stan
ford, Mother Nature added her
own timely reminder for students
and staff to prepare for the Big
One.
A mild earthquake rocked the
Bay Area yesterday morning,
briefly disturbing the Stanford
community as it prepared for the
beginning of a new academic quar
ter.
The tremor, which measured
between 4.4 and 5.0 on the stand
ard Richter scale, struck at 10:46
a.m., with its epicenter located
about nine miles northeast of San
Jose along what is known as the

Calaveras Fault.
There were no known damages
or injuries reported at Stanford;
in fact, the tremor was so mild
that many students and staff did
not notice it.
According to geologists Eric
Collins of the Seismographic Sta
tion at UC-Berkeley and Rick
Lester of the U.S. Geological Sur
vey in Menlo Park, the Calaveras
Fault starts in the Danville area,
about 15 miles east of Oakland,
and runs about 70 miles southeast
to the Hollistcr area, 30 miles
northeast of Monterey.
The fault passes through well
populated areas of Contra Costa,
Alameda and Santa Clara
counties, skirting the eastern edge
of the city of San Jose. According

to Lester, there has been a fair
amount of activity along the
Calaveras Fault recently, includ
ing a 3.4 earthquake on April 1
and a 5.3 earthquake last June.
While Earthquake Awareness
Week began at Stanford, Collins
described yesterday's Calaveras
quake as "a good reminder that
people should always be
prepared."
In addition to keeping supplies
of water and non-perishable food
outside and securing fill heavy ob
jects within living quarters,
Lester recommended advance
planning for "what to do when
the earthquake hits," stating that
"awareness is the name of the

game."
Nadine O'Leary, who works in
the Student Affairs Office on the
third floor of Old Union, reported
"a jolt" and some "jiggling
around," but claimed that for
longtime California residents "it
wasn't anything out of the ordi
nary. ... No one panicked." Al
though she could not be certain,
she thought the quake lasted
about 10 seconds, and that it was
"not disruptive."
Heidi Kluger, a secretary at the
Knoll, which is located on the hill
behind Florence Moore Hall, re
ported two sequences — first a
strong tremor of about five
seconds, followed by a lull of about
two seconds, and finally a second
strong tremor. She added that

"there are too many earthquakes
around here (to panic)."
Many Stanford students, taking
care of business for spring quar
ter, were out of their dorms and
either paying bills at Old Union
and Tresidder Memorial Union or
buying texts at the Bookstore.
Rosie Sims, operations manager
at the Bookstore, did not notice
the tremors and said she was
probably working around the
store with students when the
earthquake struck, adding that
"nobody seemed to say anything
or do anything unusual." She re
ported that the staff had not
found any damage as of the late
afternoon.
A residence secretary working
in Mirrielees this year who did
not feel yesterday's tremors but
worked in Roble Hall before it
was closed, heard a sharp crack
during the the Morgan Hill earth
quake five years ago and thought

there was "someone big and
heavy" running down the stairs.
That quake, which struck dur
ing the afternoon of April 24,1984
in the same Calaveras Fault area,
had a Richter scale reading of 6.2.
According to geologist Lester, this
quake affected the seismic instru
ments more than 10 times as
much as a 5.0 earthquake, and
involved over 30 times the energy
released by yesterday's earth
quake.
O'Leary said that during the
1984 quake, the Old Union build
ing "really creaked" and people
were "ready to run" to get out of
the structure.
The more famous cousin of the
Calaveras Fault is the San
Andreas Fault, which runs west
of San Fransisco, comes ashore
near Daly City and passes through
the Portola Valley less than five
miles west of Stanford Stadium.
It is along the San Andreas
Fault that the Great Earthquake
of 1906 struck, registering 8.2 on
the Richter scale, causing
damage to the city of San Fran
cisco and, at Stanford, destroying
Memorial Church and the recently
completed Main Library.

the Richter scale, causing
damage to the city of San Fran
cisco and, at Stanford, destroying
Memorial Church and the recently
completed Main Library.
As Earthquake Awareness
Week kicked off yesterday at Stan
ford, Mother Nature added her
own timely reminder for students
and staff to prepare for the Big
One.
A mild earthquake rocked the
Bay Area yesterday morning,
briefly disturbing the Stanford
community as it prepared for the
beginning of a new academic quar
ter.
The tremor, which measured
between 4.4 and 5.0 on the stand
ard Richter scale, struck at 10:46
a.m., with its epicenter located
about nine miles northeast of San
Jose along what is known as the

Calaveras Fault.
There were no known damages
or injuries reported at Stanford;
in fact, the tremor was so mild
that many students and staff did
not notice it.
According to geologists Eric
Collins of the Seismographic Sta
tion at UC-Berkeley and Rick
Lester of the U.S. Geological Sur
vey in Menlo Park, the Calaveras
Fault starts in the Danville area,
about 15 miles east of Oakland,
and runs about 70 miles southeast
to the Hollistcr area, 30 miles
northeast of Monterey.
The fault passes through well
populated areas of Contra Costa,
Alameda and Santa Clara
counties, skirting the eastern edge
of the city of San Jose. According

to Lester, there has been a fair
amount of activity along the
Calaveras Fault recently, includ
ing a 3.4 earthquake on April 1
and a 5.3 earthquake last June.
While Earthquake Awareness
Week began at Stanford, Collins
described yesterday's Calaveras
quake as "a good reminder that
people should always be
prepared."
In addition to keeping supplies
of water and non-perishable food
outside and securing fill heavy ob
jects within living quarters,
Lester recommended advance
planning for "what to do when
the earthquake hits," stating that
"awareness is the name of the

game."
Nadine O'Leary, who works in
the Student Affairs Office on the
third floor of Old Union, reported
"a jolt" and some "jiggling
around," but claimed that for
longtime California residents "it
wasn't anything out of the ordi
nary. ... No one panicked." Al
though she could not be certain,
she thought the quake lasted
about 10 seconds, and that it was
"not disruptive."
Heidi Kluger, a secretary at the
Knoll, which is located on the hill
behind Florence Moore Hall, re
ported two sequences — first a
strong tremor of about five
seconds, followed by a lull of about
two seconds, and finally a second
strong tremor. She added that

"there are too many earthquakes
around here (to panic)."
Many Stanford students, taking
care of business for spring quar
ter, were out of their dorms and
either paying bills at Old Union
and Tresidder Memorial Union or
buying texts at the Bookstore.
Rosie Sims, operations manager
at the Bookstore, did not notice
the tremors and said she was
probably working around the
store with students when the
earthquake struck, adding that
"nobody seemed to say anything
or do anything unusual." She re
ported that the staff had not
found any damage as of the late
afternoon.
A residence secretary working
in Mirrielees this year who did
not feel yesterday's tremors but
worked in Roble Hall before it
was closed, heard a sharp crack
during the the Morgan Hill earth
quake five years ago and thought

there was "someone big and
heavy" running down the stairs.
That quake, which struck dur
ing the afternoon of April 24,1984
in the same Calaveras Fault area,
had a Richter scale reading of 6.2.
According to geologist Lester, this
quake affected the seismic instru
ments more than 10 times as
much as a 5.0 earthquake, and
involved over 30 times the energy
released by yesterday's earth
quake.
O'Leary said that during the
1984 quake, the Old Union build
ing "really creaked" and people
were "ready to run" to get out of
the structure.
The more famous cousin of the
Calaveras Fault is the San
Andreas Fault, which runs west
of San Fransisco, comes ashore
near Daly City and passes through
the Portola Valley less than five
miles west of Stanford Stadium.
It is along the San Andreas
Fault that the Great Earthquake
of 1906 struck, registering 8.2 on
the Richter scale, causing
damage to the city of San Fran
cisco and, at Stanford, destroying
Memorial Church and the recently
completed Main Library.
