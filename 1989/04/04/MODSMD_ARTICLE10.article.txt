As Earthquake Awareness
Week kicked off yesterday at Stan
ford, Mother Nature added her

Bay Area yesterday morning,
briefly disturbing the Stanford

populated areas of Contra Costa,
Alameda and Santa Clara
counties, skirting the eastern edge
of the city of San Jose. According

In addition to keeping supplies
