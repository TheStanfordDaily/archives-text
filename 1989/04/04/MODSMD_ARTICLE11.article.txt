Stanford Medical School stu
dent Robert Perry will gain
hands-on experience at a
hospital "like a M*A*S*H unit"
in Granada, Nicaragua as the
school's first participant in a
pioneering exchange program.
For seven weeks this quarter,
Perry will do an "externship,"
practicing pediatrics and pos
sibly obstetrics and gynecology
as a visiting medical student at
Bernardino Diaz Achoa, a tent
hospital in a town of about
90,000 people.
Another Stanford medical
student, Luis Rodriguez, pro
posed this exchange project at

the beginning of fall quarter to
the Palo Alto/Stanford Medical
Action Committee for Central
America. The non-profit organ
ization, which is independent of
the University, provides medical
supplies to needy Central Amer
ican countries.
The committee, with help
from the Stanford Medical Stu
dents Assocation, agreed to fund
what they hope will become an
ongoing exchange. Another
medical student will go to
Managua this summer.
"The idea and support for the
project are coming from stu
dents at the Medical School,"
added Perry, a member of the
medical action committee.

Perry will follow the hospi
tal's chief of pediatric services
on his rounds and will work in
a lab that specializes in tropical
diseases such as malaria. He will
tour other parts of the country
as well.
Perry said his goal is to "learn
more about medicine ... gain a
better appreciation of the con
ditions in Nicaragua and be
come a spokesman for the
country in terms of its health
care."
Bernardino Diaz Achoa tent
hospital has replaced an older
building that was deemed un
safe and abandoned last sum
mer after the destruction
wrought by Hurricane Gilbert.
