## Bush, Mubarak discuss Mideast Bush urges end to Israeli occupation of West Bank and Gaza 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President
Bush, opening a week of intensive talks
on the Middle East, met with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak yesterday and
said "a new atmosphere" must be
created between Israel and Arab nations
as the first step toward peace.
After more than an hour of discus
sion, Bush urged an end to Israel's oc
cupation of the West Bank and the Gaza,
endorsed the "achievement of Palestin
ian political rights" and said a "properly
structured" international peace confer
ence could play a useful role.
The tone of Bush's remarks suggested
the United States may attempt to exert
pressure for compromise on Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who
arrives in the United States tomorrow
and confers with Bush on Thursday.
Shamir's government has opposed any
settlement based on trading land for
peace, and has been deeply skeptical
about any international conference.
Mubarak, standing alongside Bush at
a departure ceremony in the Rose Gar
den, said, "We found ourselves in agree
ment on most issues at stake."

Bush did not specify whether his ad
ministration was demanding total Is
raeli withdrawal from the West Bank
and the Gaza strip, seized in the 1967
Middle East war.
Nor did he define what he meant by
a "properly structured" international
conference, although a senior U.S. offi
cials said Bush emphasized "the key
factor of direct negotiations in any peace
process."
U.S. policy on the occupied territories
has been to urge Israel to trade land
for peace while leaving open the possi
bility of Israel retaining some of the
land for security reasons.
In his talks with Bush, Mubarak
rejected Shamir's suggestion for elec
tions among Palestinians to find leaders
who would negotiate their future with
Israel, according to a senior U.S. official.
Mubarak said elections under Israeli su
pervision were unacceptable to the Pal
estinians, the official added.
Rather than let the idea drop, Bush
asked Mubarak if other forms of super
vision would be acceptable, the official
said, refusing to discuss the matter fur

ther or to be identified.
In a warm gesture of friendship after
the formal talks at the White House,
Bush took Mubarak to Baltimore for
the opening day of the baseball season
and a game between the Orioles and
the Boston Red Sox. Bush left his guest
briefly to throw out the first ball.
Mubarak also will be the president's
guest at a White House dinner tonight.
The 15-month Palestinian uprising in
the West Bank and Gaza and Israel's
tough tactics in dealing with it have
created pressure on the search for a
peace settlement.
"We share a sense of urgency to move
toward a comprehensive settlement
through direct negotiations," Bush said.
"A new atmosphere must be created
where Israelis and Arabs feel each
other's willingness to compromise so
that both sides can win," Bush said.
Endorsing one of Mubarak's principal
proposals, Bush said that a "properly
structure international conference could
play a useful role at an appropriate
time."
