# Witness says Reagan designated North to deal with Contras

WASHINGTON (AP) - A witness yes
terday quoted the late CIA Director
William Casey as saying President Reagan
had designated Oliver North to handle
the Nicaraguan Contras' military needs
in the event of a congressional ban on
official U.S. aid.
Vincent Cannistraro, a defense witness
in North's trial, said Casey made the
statement in the spring of 1984 during
a meeting at the CIA attended by CIA
official Duane Clarridge; the CIA station
chief in Costa Rica, Joseph Fernandez,
and a Contra leader who was not identi
fied.

The witness said at the outset of his
testimony that he was knowledgeable
about activities of the CIA in support of
the Contras in the two years before the
ban on aid went into effect and he in
timated, but never said, that he was with
the CIA at the time. He said that in
September 1984 he went to work for
then-National Security Adviser Robert
McFarlane and had an office next door
to North's.
It had become obvious, Cannistraro
said, that in the fiscal year starting in
October 1984 Congress would cut off
funds for the Contras.

"He, Bill Casey, speaking on behalf of
the president of the United States, wanted
to assure the freedom fighters that the
U.S. government would find a way" to
support them after the ban took effect,
Cannistraro testified. "He said Colonel
North would not be subject to those re
strictions."
Casey died in 1987.
North maintained in congressional tes
timony that he acted in the belief that
the ban applied only to intelligence agen
cies and not the National Security Coun
cil where he was an aide.
Reagan told the Tower Commission on

Jan. 26, 1987 that "he did not know that
the NSC staff was engaged in helping
the Contras."
Charges against North include allega
tions that he concealed from Congress
and former Attorney General Edwin
Meese his efforts on behalf of the Contras.
At a subsequent meeting attended by
North and Contra leader Adolfo Calero,
Cannistraro said, "There was more spe
cific discussion that Colonel North would
be responsible at the White House after
October 1984 â€” the only one dealing
with the Contras on paramilitary sup
port."

Cannistraro was asked by U.S. District
Judge Gerhard Gesell who had given au
thority for that arrangement, and he
quoted Casey as having said earlier that
"he had discussed this with the president
of the United States and agreed with the
president this is how it should be han
dled."
Earlier yesterday, a Texas woman who
contributed more than $2 million to help
the Nicaraguan guerrillas asserted firmly,
and at times indignantly, that North
never directly asked for or received
money from her while he was a White
House aide.
