### 
HAVANA (AP) â€” Presidents
Mikhail Gorbachev and Fidel
Castro went behind closed doors
yesterday for talks expected to air
their ideological differences and
highlight the problems of Third
World nations.
A Soviet spokesman, asked
whether Gorbachev would offer
to forgive Cuba's massive debt to
the Soviet Union, said that subject
was not discussed specifically, al
though the leaders did talk about
the "enormous debt plundering
the economies" of Latin American
countries.
The spokesman, Gennady Ger
asimov, said Gorbachev's initial
discussions with Castro and the
Cuban Communist Party's Cen
tral Committee were held in a
"frhndly atmosphere."
He also said Gorbachev re
ported on the Soviet Union's
recent multicandidate parliamen
tary elections, which were seen as
a victory for the party's
reformers. Castro, who has never
allowed competitive elections in
his 30-year rule, has openly crit

icized Gorbachev's reforms, say
ing they borrowed too much from
the capitalist world.
Between ceremonial wreath
layings at monuments to Jose
Marti, the father of Cuban inde
pendence, and Lenin, the first
Communist head of the Soviet
Union, Castro and Gorbachev
began their discussions in the
Palace of the Revolution with
members of their staffs facing
each other across a conference
table.
Later, with the formalities com
pleted, the two presidents went
into private talks accompanied
only by their interpreters.
Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, visited
a day-care center, a Cuban-Soviet
friendship center and the estate
of the late American author
Ernest Hemingway who lived for
many years in a villa outside
Havana that is now a museum.
Raisa Gorbachev and her husband
have mentioned reading
Hemingway, whose works have
been translated into Russian and
are popular in the Soviet Union.

Gerasimov said Gorbachev and
Castro, in their opening talks, ex
changed views on the March 26
Soviet elections and discussed
problems in Latin America, par
ticularly those of indebtedness
and the drug trade.

Castro has openly
criticized Gorba
chev's reforms, say
ing they borrowed too
much from the
capitalist world.

The debt is only one aspect of
the economic ties between the So
viet Union and Cuba. Soviet eco
nomic aid to Cuba is estimated
by Western sources at between $4
billion and $7 billion annually,
substantially more per capita than
U.S. assistance to any Latin
American country.
