Exxon offers apology for oil spill
VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) — Exxon apologized
Monday for causing the nation's biggest oil spill
and promised to clean up every fouled beach in
Prince William Sound, but workers on those
greasy-smelling beaches said their efforts are
futile.
Police continued hunting for the former captain
of the tanker Exxon Valdez, which crashed into
Bligh Reef on March 24, spilling 10.1 million
gallons of North Slope crude. There were indica
tions that the captain, Joseph Hazelwood, might
surrender soon.
The oil slick has now grown larger than Rhode
Island. Scientists reported more wildlife deaths
and said a vital herring fishery was threatened.
The Prince William Sound fishery is worth more
than $150 million annually.
"I want to tell you how sorry I am that this
accident took place," said Exxon Chairman

Lawrence Rawl.
Rawl's statement also appeared to be a response
to harsh criticism from Alaskan officials, fisher
men and environmentalists who accuse Exxon of
reacting slowly and inadequately to the spill.
U.S. to force tougher air security
WASHINGTON (AP) - The United States
announced new measures to combat sky terror
ism yesterday as relatives of passengers killed in
the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing mounted a high
profile campaign to complain about aviation se
curity and the government's "lack of compassion"
following the disaster.
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, who
along with President Bush met with several rela
tives of those killed in the explosion over Scotland,
told a news conference that airlines will be re
quired to install devices to detect plastic ex
plosives in major U.S. and foreign airports.
