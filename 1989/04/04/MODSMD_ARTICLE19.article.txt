## An ethnic PRIMEr 
### 
Side effects don't always
have to be bad. Just look
at Stanford's new program
to bolster the ethnic content of
undergraduate courses.
The program aims to add a
multicultural angle to more Stan
ford classes, but in addition it
provides opportunities for close
interaction between students and
professors, as well as putting
some Dran-o in the clogged
professorial pipeline for minority
students.
The three-phase program en
courages students to work with
a professor and develop a course
more reflective of a multicultural
environment.
For starters, the program pro
vides students with a $250
stipend to do one month of
bibliographical work for new
course material under a profes
sor's direction. The second phase
offers $2,000 for summer re
search and course development,
and part three gives students an
opportunity to be teaching assis
tants in the course they helped
improve.
Given the acronym PRIME
(Program for Research and Inno
vation in Multicultural
Education), the new program will
come out kicking this quarter,
encouraging close interaction be
tween professors and their stu
dents.
However, PRIME is only a be
ginning on the road to a truly
multicultural education, and its
limitations must be recognized.
The program places the burden
of a multicultural education on
the students themselves — most
likely minority students.
Asst. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Charlie Junkerman ad
mitted that the program "asks
students to do what they
shouldn't have to do." However,

Junkerman added that the
benefits of the program outweigh
the drawbacks and should not be
seen as a panacea.
The burden of improving the
ethnic content of courses should
not just rest with students; in
stead, professors must take the
initiative to develop multicultural
understanding. They should in
vite outstanding students to
develop course material, as well
as keep an open mind toward
working with students and im
proving their courses.
A similar program at Brown
University has been successful
for two years, and Junkerman is
optimistic that the program will
grow here. PRIME currently has
$12,500 of funding from the Ir
vine Foundation, and Junkerman
assumes more money will roll in
once the program gets well off
the ground.
Before that can happen,
though, three things must occur:
lots of publicity, flexibility in of
fering credits for developing
course material and a rigorous
commitment from the faculty.
The publicity has already
started to fly, as PRIME has seen
play in periodic Daily ads, two
waves of leaflets to dorms — one
at the end of last quarter and
one at the beginning of this quar
ter — and a letter alerting the
faculty to PRIME.
Students might receive credits
— rather than the cash incentive
— for participating. Stanford ad
ministrators often become wary
of free-dealing University credit,
but in this venture the possibility
of receiving credit is a strong
idea, given the time constraints
already facing students.
If it lives up to its acronym,
the program could prime the
Stanford multicultural education
pump.
