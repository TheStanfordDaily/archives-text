# Sending 'A's and 'B's to eliminate queues
## Registrar's Office mails winter grades 
### Sophia Shing Staff writer 
Did you walk into Old Union yesterday with
your fingers crossed intending to pick up your
grades, only to discover that they were in the
mail?
Yesterday, in a break from standard proce
dure, the Registrar's Office mailed students'
grades to their local addresses. Grades are
expected to arrive tomorrow. Students who
do not receive their grade report by next
Monday are advised to pick them up at the
office next week.
Experimenting with this procedure for the
first time, the Registrar's Office aims to elim
inate the lines students face when trying to
get their grades themselves. "The primary
purpose of this change is to provide better
service for students," Asst. Registrar Joy
Parker said.
Nevertheless, the Registrar's Office is still

unsure whether the procedure will become a
new tradition. On the drawing board for at
least a year, the mailing of grades costs about
$2,800 while the previous line-up format cost
little more than $500.
In previous years only about 50 percent of
the student body, mostly undergraduates,
picked up their grades. Now every grade
record except for those of Law School students
will arrive in the mail.
Despite the higher price tag of mailing out
the grades, Parker said he hopes the new
procedure will better serve the students.

Notwithstanding, Registrar Sally Mahoney
said, "Postal rates will still play a part in
determining if what we are doing is effective."
Parker admitted that the timing of the
change was not ideal. "The spring break was
probably not the best time to start this pro
gram because it is the shortest period between
quarters. However, we needed to test it out
now to see how it would work for the summer
and the winter breaks," she said.
Students had mixed opinions about the
change.
Junior Bruce Goldman said he was "an
noyed" to find out he had to wait because he
was "anxious to find out [his) grades."
With a different view, freshman Alvin Lee
said, "I didn't want to wait in lines and now
I don't have to."
Junior Tyler Aguinaldo Jr. also accepted
the change. "It's a little disappointing, but
it's not that big of a deal," Aguinaldo said.
"I can wait."
