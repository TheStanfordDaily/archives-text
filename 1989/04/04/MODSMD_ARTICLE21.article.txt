## Shades of difference 
### 
CONSIDER THE CASE of Lucy and
Charlie Brown. Lucy always pulls
the football away from Charlie
Brown before he kicks it. You would think
that by now Charlie Brown would have
learned not to attempt to kick the thing,
but as most children do, he has faith in
the goodness of people even if they were
previously untrustworthy.
Minorities confront the same type of
problem whenever they are faced with
whites: Will I be able to trust this person
or will he or she turn out to be just as
racist and malignant as those I have al
ready met? The vast majority of minority
people — though not all — have the
Charlie Brown faith and still believe there
is good in human character.
In his March 10 column, Burke Smith
said "I have often heard the argument
that the color of my skin somehow
devalues my opinion regarding minority
issues: 'You could never understand be
cause you are white.' " Smith has com
pletely missed the point.
The fact of the matter, as well as the
meaning of such a statement, is that
white males can never truly feel and un
derstand racism as a minority person
can, because racism is an integral part
of being a minority.
I am not saying that white males are
not discriminated against or that minor
ities cannot be racist, but white males
have not been disenfranchised, enslaved,
exploited, killed in large numbers due to
their skin color, herded like cattle onto
reservations after having their tribal land
taken from them, sent to internment
camps, raped.

Whenever a minority person encoun
ters an act of discrimination, this history
of racist actions is brought to the fore
front of his or her mind. What does a
white person think if he or she happens
to encounter such things?
It is imperative that whites understand
this difference, as it is equally important
that minorities understand why some
white males feel as if they cannot discuss
issues of racism and gender without fear
of verbal attack.
Smith claimed that "some minority
groups have redefined racism as racial
antagonism by the majority focused
against a minority," thereby proclaiming
that by the definition itself, minorities
cannot be racist.
What minority groups have said this?
I have not heard this statement made by
any minority groups. I agree with Smith
that "any supposition of racial superiority
or inferiority is disgusting, regardless of
the bigot's skin color." Nevertheless, cer
tain individuals do not share this opinion
— the key word being individuals. Let
us not blame groups for statements made
by individuals.
In his column, Smith also discussed
"an analogous attitude on the part of
some women" that all men are sexist
pigs. Well, there is no way to put this
gently, so I'll be blunt.
All men are sexist, as are all women.
What varies is the degree of sexism. One
can be sexist without being a buns
grabber or a "hey baby" yeller. For ex
ample, I know some feminist men who,
when playing basketball, will not pass
the ball to a female in a crunch situation.

All men are sexist, as
are all women. What
varies is the degree of
sexism. One can be
sexist without being a
buns-grabber or a 'hey
baby' yeller.

Society has taught men, as well as
women, to be sexist. For instance, who
is supposed to pay for dates? Whose duty
is it to ask whom out on a date in the
first place? Who is supposed to be ag
gressive and who is supposed to be pas
sive?
Though white men have not been dis
criminated against in the same ways as
women and minorities, this should not
exclude them from discussions of racial
and gender issues or from working to
find solutions to the problems of racism
and sexism. Regardless of your race and
gender, if you're not part of the solution,
you're part of the problem.
