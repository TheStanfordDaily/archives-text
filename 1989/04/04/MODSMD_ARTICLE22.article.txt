## Recycling isn't hard, and saves both trees and time 
### 
The recent enthusiasm
about a proposed environmental
theme house and environmental
core is exciting. But despite these
future plans to facilitate healthy inter
action with the environment, I would
like to point out a few daily (no pun
intended) opportunities for would-be
environmentalists that are too often
overlooked.
I have yet to walk by one garbage
can on campus and not see recycled
materials sitting on top of it. Yesterday
I pulled about 15 Dailys out of a
garbage can, and the day before picked
up five aluminum cans, two glass
bottles and several Dailys from a
classroom floor.
Only a handful of offices on campus

use recycled paper. Recycled computer
paper, of equal or better quality than
that made from virgin pulp, is rarely
used on campus despite the fact that it
is cheaper.
Styrofoam and plastic products are
readily supplied and used on campus.
The Bookstore still uses plastic bags.
And despite the availability of com
pact flourescent light bulbs, which
provide an equal amount of light as 15
watts and live nine times longer than
60-watt incandescent bulbs, less than
50 percent of the dormitories on
campus have them.
But does recycling really "make a
difference?" some skeptics ask. Here
are a few facts: It takes 19 times more
energy to produce an aluminum can

from bauxite ore than from recycled
aluminum.
The energy saved by recycling one
glass bottle will light a 100-watt bulb
for four hours or a 15-watt compact
flourescent bulb for 26!
Producing recycled paper uses half
the water, causes 74 percent less air
pollution and 33 percent less water
pollution than producing it from trees.
It also provides five times more jobs,
preserves forests and prolongs the life
of landfills.
So why don't people recycle? That's
my question. I was very proud to learn
that the student-run Stanford recycling
center is one of the largest and most
comprehensive programs of its kind in
the nation. It would be great if we

match this excellence in student partici
pation and enthusiasm.
As the future of our planet becomes
more and more questionable, many feel
frustrated by their powerlessness to
change things â€” I say we can. Change
can only occur through individuals.
We need to take responsibility for
everything we use: If you leave a Daily
lying around, then assume it will be
thrown in the garbage.
If you ask your department, com
puter center or the Bookstore to switch
to recycled paper products, then maybe
... just maybe ... they will.
Reduce consumption; Reuse what
you can; Recycle the rest.
