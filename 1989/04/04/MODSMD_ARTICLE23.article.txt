# If pesticides hurt consumers, think of the grape pickers
## 
### 
I am writing in response to the
stories about the dangers to consumers
from Alar, a pesticide used on apples,
and the fruit tainted with Chilean
cyanide.
I think it's ironic that these stories
have generated so much interest and
media coverage. If public interest and
media attention to the same dangers to
people who pick fruit were even a frac
tion of these stories, maybe after 10
years of trying to get support some
thing would have been done.
For many years, folks who support
the United Farm Workers grape
boycott have been tolerated with mild
amusement for being so militant or
charged with trying to ruin the eco
nomy of the farm owners.

There are those who vehemently
deny any danger to the workers or the
public, even when strong evidence
shows not only danger to the farm
workers and their unborn children but
to the people who consume the grapes.
When the possibility of cancer and
other diseases affects middle America,
the news is quick to alert them as it
should. I hope those who have the
choice of not eating potentially harmful
food will think about those who have
little choice when it comes time to pick
the poison-laden fruit.
