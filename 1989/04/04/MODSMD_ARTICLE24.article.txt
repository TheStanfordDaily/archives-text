# Immature perhaps, but it certainly was not a racial slur
## 
### 
I am writing this letter in response
to a serious misunderstanding which
apparently took place at the late
showing of "Rattle and Hum" at the
March 19 Sunday Flicks.
In an April 3 letter, Alex Sale con
demned the perpetrators of a racial
outburst during the flick who appar
ently yelled, "Black students go home!"
prior to a segment on Harlem.
I apologize for this very serious
misunderstanding which has, under
standably, given Sale so much cause
for anger. A group of my friends and I
had been joking about how docile the
crowd was that night, and this evolved
into the name "Grad Student Flicks"
for that evening's show.
The impulse seized one of us to
make a joke about this in the usual

spirit of the Flicks, by yelling in uni
son, "Grad students go home!" This
perhaps was not the most mature
thing to yell, but it certainly wasn't
intended to be racially offensive.
I can only apologize for the misun
derstanding and hope that Sale was
the only one who took what we yelled
in the wrong way. If not, I hope that
this incident hasn't further fueled the
controversy over racism which has
enveloped Stanford this year, for the
perpetrators never dreamed that what
they yelled could be heard in the way
that it was.
