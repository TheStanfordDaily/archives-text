The Stanford Daily
The Stanford Health
Service announced plans for
the construction of a new
student health center with
funds donated by the Cowell
Foundation of San Fran
cisco.
Dr. Mauric Osbourne, di
rector of Stanford Health
Service, predicted, "This
new building is designed to
give the students the same
high quality medical care
they would receive from
their own physicians." OK,
so he wasn't Nostradamus.
April 4, 1968
The Stanford Daily
Radio astronomers at the
Stanford Center for Radar
Astronomy announced that
they may have picked up
radio signals from an ex
traterrestrial civilization on
Stanford's 150-foot "Dish"
radio telescope.
The powerful and regular
signals appeared to have
originated about 180 light
years away in the Milky
Way, between the stars Vega
and Altair. The signals came
in short pulses spaced ex
actly 1.337 seconds apart
and lasted one-tenth of a sec
ond each.
Three other sources of sig
nals with similar character
istics suggested the possibil
ity of an intergalactic com
munications network to im
aginative scientists. How
ever, British radio astron
omers suggested that
neutron stars, which up to
that point existed in theory
but had never been discov
ered, could also explain the
pulses.
