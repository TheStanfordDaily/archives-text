# Engineering whiz wows Playboy, becomes novelist
## 
### Andrew Berkowitz Editorial staff 
Sitting on a beach drinking beer
and looking at pictures of naked
women is not what you'd generally
consider a good way to launch a
writing career. Then again, Stan
ford doctoral student Jeff Raines,
author of "The Big Island" and
the soon-to-be-published "Un
balanced Acts," has earned more
than $87,000 for his novels by
following a rather unconventional
career path.
Four years ago Raines wasn't
even thinking of being a writer.
"I hadn't even taken a writing
course since Freshman English,"
he says in his embarrassed, al
most inaudible monotone.
Actually, in addition to taking
Freshman English at the Univer
sity of Connecticut in 1980,
Raines was also an Opinions col
umnist for The Daily four years
ago, a position he looks back on
with both fondness and distaste.
"My editors wanted me to be
serious," he says with a grimace.
In 1985, having just received a
master's degree in engineering
from Stanford, Raines was work
ing a summer job at an engineer
ing firm in Honolulu before
returning to school in the fall to
work toward his doctorate.
Shortly before leaving Hawaii,
Raines decided to travel around
the smaller islands for some
sightseeing.
"I was spending my last week
camping in a tent on Kauai," says
Raines.
"One night I went into town to
get a six-pack from the local liquor
store. When I got there, I saw the
'Women of the Pac-10' issue of
Playboy, and of course decided to
check it out. So I bought a copy
and took it back to my tent along
with the beer. I must say the Stan
ford women didn't acquit them
selves well at all, but in the back
of the magazine was an announce
ment for the Playboy College Fic
tion Writing Contest."
The next day Raines sat alone
on the beach with a pencil and
pad of yellow legal paper and

started to write a short story. He
came back the next day and wrote
beneath the sun for a few more
hours, and then again the day
after that.
Within a week he had finished
a winding tale about a Vietnam
veteran, Japanese-Caucasian
police chief fighting marijuana
growers and heroin-smugglers on
the big island of Hawaii. He titled
the short story "Pele's Tears,"
mailed it to Playboy, and returned
to Stanford to pursue his next
degree.

Alice Turner, Playboy's fiction
editor and arguably one of the
most respected figures in the
short fiction business, remembers
reading Raines' story.
"I was very interested in it,"
booms Turner in her louder-than
thou New York accent from the
Playboy offices in Manhattan.
"He so clearly had a commercial
voice."
Raines' story was awarded
third place in the contest, and
Turner showed the story to
several literary agents.

Four months later Raines re
ceived a letter from a New York
literary agent saying he should
expand the story into a novel. In
trigued, Raines sent a copy to
Fredrick Hill and Associates, a
prestigious San Francisco literary
agency. A few weeks later he
visited their office on Union
Street, a cramped garret filled
from floor to ceiling with books.
"He came into the office and
asked if I thought he should write
the novel," remembers Bonnie
Nadell, Raines' agent. "I told him
sure he should write it, and he
said he would be back when it
was finished. My reaction at the
time was Teah, right.' All the
time people come in saying they're
writing the greatest novel ever
written, and we never see them
again."
But three months later Raines
was back with the finished novel
length version of "Pele's Tears,"
renamed "The Big Island." In the
meantime, Nadell had received
three inquiries about the book
from publishers who had heard
through the Alice Turner
grapevine that a good commercial
novel was being written.
Four publishers bid on "The Big
Island," and nine months after he
had walked into that liquor store
in Hawaii for a six-pack of beer,
Raines finally settled on William
Morrow and Co. to publish the
novel with a relatively large (for
a first-time author) advance of
$52,500.
At his desk in the cramped base
ment office in the Terman Engi
neering Center, Raines, 30,
doesn't look like a writer. His desk
looks like it might be a writer's
desk, covered with stacks of
papers and coffee stains. A Mac
intosh computer is the centerpiece
of what he proudly calls his "ar
cheological filing system." Physics
and engineering texts line the
bookshelves, and the computer
screen doesn't contain the begin
nings of a future bestseller but a
prototype for a computer-aided
engineering tutorial he is devel
oping for Stanford's Electrical
Engineering Department.

Raines himself is a smallish
man whose face is hidden behind
thick, rounded glasses and a beard
that makes him look like a teen
ager trying to grow one.
Watching Raines write, it's hard
to believe that the man at the
keyboard is the one creating vio
lent action-adventure novels. He
looks like an asexual computer
nerd, sitting among piles of torn
graph paper, sipping coffee and
typing furiously away at the
keyboard.
Each morning during the
warmer months, Raines bicycles
the five miles to campus from the
one-story Palo Alto house he
shares with three other men. Be
sides bicycling, for entertainment
he reads voraciously (Sidney Shel
don and adventure novelists) and
occasionally sees a movie with his
long-time girlfriend, Marlene, an
electronics engineer.
Still, his life hardly matches
those of the characters in his
stories. "The characters in 'The
Big Island' are a lot more exciting
than I am," he admits.
The same appears to be true
for the characters in his second
book, "Unbalanced Acts," which
will be published in December.
The plot, about a group of ter
rorists who kidnap violent patients
from the New York Asylum for
the Criminally Insane and release
them one by one onto the streets
of New York City, virtually
screams "movie rights." Raines
feels a deal may be worked out
for up to six figures.
Yet, despite the money he earns
writing — he received a $35,000
advance on "Unbalanced Acts" —
Raines has no intention of passing
up a career in engineering to con
centrate solely on publishing
novels. "The actual, physical proc
ess of writing is boring," says
Raines, who for many years has
been resolute in his desire to get
his engineering doctorate and has
fit writing around a teaching
schedule.
Looking back, Raines is
philosophical about his quick suc

cess in the writing business. He
entered the Playboy contest be
cause he reasoned that with only
college students entering he would
be competing against a smaller
pool of people, and if he did well
editors might read his stuff. Still,
he didn't think he'd ever make it
into print.
"One of the great myths is that
it's hard to get published," he
says. "It's not hard to get pub
lished; it's only hard to write stuff
people want to read."
He singles out Stanford's well
respected creative writing pro
gram as one that encourages
students to write what nobody
wants to read. "They tell you to
write only what you know from
experience. Bullshit! If you don't
know anything interesting, you
have to make stuff up. That's

what creative writing is."
Raines is clearly looking for
ward to the next few years of his
life. Ironically, only a thesis stands
between him and his long-coveted
engineering doctorate, although
his next book, a historical
romance for which he has begun
research, may push the thesis
back another year or two.
Raines' own romance may soon
blossom into marriage if his
girlfriend has her way, although
he seems less inclined to tie the
knot any time soon.
Whatever path he chooses to
follow, Raines is in an enviable
position. With a solidly estab
lished market for his fiction and
the inevitable movie rights, as
well as a teaching career just
around the corner, Raines has
plenty of time to kick back on the
beach, drink a few beers and even
look at pictures of naked women
from time to time if he feels like
it.
