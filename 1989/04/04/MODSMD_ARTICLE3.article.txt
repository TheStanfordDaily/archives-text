# Health and Safety fills new head post
## Hoerner to run a tighter ship 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
In accordance with a highly cri
tical report on the Department of
Health and Safety, the University
has filled the new position of di
rector of environmental health
and safety.
As the director, Carol Hoerner
will have the authority to shut
down any researcher's laboratory
that is deemed unsafe.
Following an internal investiga
tion into University safety man
agement, University President
Donald Kennedy last September
created two new positions with
the authority to shut down any
activities deemed to pose an im
mediate danger to health and
safety.
The second post commissioned
by Kennedy — a laboratory safety
officer — has yet to be filled.
Hoerner — who was selected
after a six-month search — will
report to the vice president for

administration, and will report di
rectly to Kennedy in emergencies
and for purposes of quality as
surance. She will start work July
1.
Although she combines experi
ence in both research and health
and safety, Hoerner will need a
great deal of expertise to deal with
Stanford's Department of Health
and Safety, which has struggled
through a rocky year.
Last year, Health and Safety
official Jon Moldestad quit his job
and accused the University of in
timidation, legal violations, un
ethical behavior, cover-up and
mismanagement. The allegations
prompted two audits of Health
and Safety problems.
Although Stanford quickly took
action and investigated Moldes
tad's claims, he sued the Univer
sity and won his full $200,000
request in an out-of-court settle
ment.
