"The Satanic Verses"
by Salman Rushdie

With till the clamour about "The Satanic Verses"
we are apt to forget that it is the product of an
astonishingly creative imagination.
It is perhaps not as consistently brilliant as
Rushdie's "Midnight's Children," a mythical history
of modern India, nor as disciplined as "Shame," his
novel about a place that is "not quite Pakistan,"
but its themes are deeper and more universal.
And Rushdie's adopted style of "magical realism,"
which seeks its forms in the narrative traditions of
the epic and folktale in India as much as in the
writings of its Latin American originators, works
rather well in the gray and reasonable city of Lon
don.
Is there a plot? There is something like a plot,
but mostly it is plots within plots. Two men fall
out of an exploding Air India jet 29,000 feet above
the English Channel, survive, or rather, are reborn.
One, Saladin Chamchawla, who has spent much of
his life trying to shed his Indian ancestry and
become British, now begins to grow horns, hooves,
a persistent and gigantic erection, and a tail — you
guessed it. The other, all-time superstar of the
Hindi film screen who has played every conceivable
god, Gibreel Farishta (Gabriel Angel), now begins
to radiate a shining light from behind his head,
and is periodically convinced of his duty to spread
the word of God.
The central thread (not quite a plot) of the novel
works around the plight of these two figures in
London, figures of light and dark, good and evil

and their promised confrontation. But the thread
begins to unravel from the start. Not only is it
impossible to separate good from evil, but it seems
just as impossible to find the truth.
Where other writers and an earlier Rushdie him
self used magical realism for a variety of purposes
— to parody realism, to describe the non-modern
— here Rushdie employs the style to evoke a con
dition of the contemporary world, and even more,
the condition of a particular people, immigrants.
He describes a condition in which reality and
image are no longer separable, in which words no
longer represent objects but rather create our very
realities.
This is in short a hyper-real, post-modern world,
and the people most sensitive to this world are
immigrants: trans-nationals, trans-culturals, whose
sense of reality grounded in particular cultures has
long been blasted, but who are also denied a reality
in cosmopolitan England.
When Salman Chamcha (chamcha means spoon
in Hindusthani and also means a toady — a means
of feeding [an egol) finds himself in a London
hospital ward filled with immigrants from the old
empire transformed into animals and monsters he
asks one how they do it. "They describe us," the
other whispers solemnly. "That's all. They have the
power of description and we succumb to the pictures
they construct."
Even in their secure, real lives, both Farishta and
Chamcha had made a living by simulating the real,
or rather the unreal. Chamcha had been the man
with a thousand voices, much in demand on TV
and radio commercials, speaking like a ketchup bot
tle, a garlic-flavored crisp or a carpet in a warehouse
commercial. Farishta had played the gods and in
his present reincarnation as the Archangel, his
dreams which take us to the other worlds appear
serially, like a soap-opera.
And the immigrant, ever the outsider, seems to
be inescapably caught in the other's image: Chamcha
dreams on the airplane over to India that he is
faced by a man whose skin is covered by glass. The
man is desperate and Chamcha seeks to break the
glass covering to free him; but as he seeks to pick
off the broken shards, the man screams, chunks of
flesh come off with the glass.
What is the way out? How not to succumb? Per
haps the only way is to repossess the image. The
goat-satan Chamcha becomes something of a hero
among the immigrant youth as horned-caps become
the vogue. The youthful Mishal Sufiya says to him,
"Chamcha, you are a hero. I mean people can really
identify with you. It's an image white society has
rejected for so long that we can really take it, you
know, occupy it, inhabit it, reclaim it and make it
our own." Chamcha is not impressed.
But if words and representations create the
realities with which we live, then what of truth and
belief and faith? Rushdie's answer, as you might
imagine, is at the root of what gets him into trouble
with the faithful. But Rushdie doesn't necessarily

In 'The Satanic Verses,' Rushdie depicts a hyper-real,
post-modern world in which truth and image merge, in which
good is indistinguishable from evil. In this world, words do
not describe reality; they create it.

believe that it is only the religious who are true
believers.
"Question: what is the opposite of faith ?
Not disbelief. Too final, certain, closed, Itself a
kind of belief.
Doubt."
Through the dreams of the reincarnated angel
Gabriel Farishta, we enter the world of the devout,
the saint, the Prophet and of Truth. Here are the
infamous chapters on Jahilia where the Prophet
Mahound (a derogatory name for the Prophet
Muhammad which Rushdie uses in order to "turn
insults into strengths, whigs, tories, Blacks all chose
to wear with pride the names they were given in
scorn .. .") travels up to Mount Cone to receive the
word of God via the dreamer, the Archangel Gibreel.
On one occasion he receives the words of Satan,
but this is subsequently corrected by the true words
of God. But the dreamer Gibreel, in impeccable
Indian English, leaves us with a tiny doubt: "that
it was me both times, baba, me first and second
also me."
The question of revealed truth, present here and
in so many other of the novel's narratives, threaten
to make the world of "Satanic Verses" a bewildering
place. How to make sense of these multiple narra
tives, lives within lives, movements between epochs
and between dream and wakefulness. Are the con
nections only theological and philosophical?
Here the novel works also as a magical detective
story. Names and words refer to other names and
words to fabricate their reality and Rushdie leaves
us with only these names to find our way through
this labyrinth.
Thus Ayesha, the visionary peasant girl who leads
her pilgrim followers to a promised parting of the
Arabian Sea, is also the name of an evil Empress,
enemy of the faith, as well as the youngest and
favorite wife of the Prophet. Abu Simbel, grandee
of Jahilia, ruler of the godess-worshipping idolators,
has been named after the village in Egypt that was
flooded when the Aswan Dam was built.
And neither last nor least, there is Salman the
immigrant, scribe of the Prophet who deliberately
mis-transcribes the words of God spoken through
the voice of the Prophet, and gets away for the
longest time. Until, sensing imminent discovery, he
flees into hiding for fear of his life.
But what of the offending passages? This is a
novel about the uncertainty of knowledge and all
believers will feel challenged. But most of the pas
sages in which belief is haunted by doubt — as, for
instance, the one suggesting the temptation of the
Prophet which is then overcome — are written, if
not with respect, then at least with a sense of
dramatic seriousness that befits the theme.
There are, however, one or two episodes where
Rushdie lapses into mischievousness, an insensitivity

that is insulting. The most notable of these is the
story of the brothel in which the converts pretend
to be the Prophet and sleep with the prostitutes
who have taken the names of the 12 wives of the
Prophet.
Towards the end of the bode Rushdie seeks to
clarify the political issues posed by his explorations
of religious truth.
In a dimly-lit Bombay bar, a group of secular
minded intellectuals heatedly argue one of those
never-ending debates. Bhupan Gandhi, perhaps the
most likable of the minor characters in the novel,
says, "You cannot deny the übiquity of faith. If we
write in such a way as to pre-judge such beliefs as
in some ways deluded or false, then are we not
guilty of elitism, of imposing our world-view on the
masses?"
The radical Swatilekha cries, "Battle lines are
being drawn up in India today. Secular versus re
ligious, the light versus the dark. Better you choose
which side you are one."
The opinion of many such secular-minded intel
lectuals in India today is that Rushdie has written
a brilliant book and one that he has every right to
write. The threats on his life are completely unac
ceptable and must be denounced.
However, in choosing to draw the battle lines as
he did in an arena where the most radical writers
and activists must tread ever so carefully on matters
religious, Rushdie has revealed the extent to which
he has lost touch with the political realities of the
subcontinent and its diaspora. This is a revelation
which must surely distress him as much as anyone
else.

While death threats have made Rushdie the center
of furious international debate, strikingly few of
the author's critics or supporters have considered
the literary merits of "The Satanic Verses."
