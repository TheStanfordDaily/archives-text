## Cardinal nine takes on UOP with new confidence 
### Bruce Sarkisian Senior staff writer 
Although its season record is
still two games below .500, the
Stanford baseball team has
started to make slow progress
toward regaining its two-time na
tional championship form.
At the beginning of the season,
one of the Cardinal's most glaring
faults was its defense. Shortstop
Troy Paulsen personified his
team's woes, collecting 15 errors
in the first 16 games, four less
than he had in all 69 games last
season.
All along Paulsen contended
that his problems were mental not
physical. Once he made a few good
plays, he said, everything would
be fine. In his last 17 games, Paul
sen has gotten his confidence up
and committed no errors. The
team has mirrored Paulsen's
progress, raising its fielding
average from .948 to .979 in its
last 12 games.
Last Weekend against USC,
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
saw his squad do many good
things in winning its first series
in almost two months. "We com
bined good pitching with good de
fense and timely hitting. That's
something we haven't been able
to do with much consistency this
season," he said.
Yes, the Cardinal finally won a
few blowouts, beating San Fran
cisco State 11-4 last Tuesday, and
USC by scores of 9-2 and 15-5.
Earlier in the year, Stanford
found itself on the losing end of
those big scores more than once.

Stanford is making
slow progress
toward regaining
championship
form.

Senior Jack Hollis, who trans
ferred from Harbor Junior College
last year, is emblematic of Stan
ford's offensive turnaround. He
was five-for-10 over the weekend,
and he clubbed his first collegiate
home run while being robbed of

another on Saturday.
All of a sudden, the Cardinal
has started to show some power.
Over the last four games, it has
averaged 10 runs on 12 hits while
garnering a .345 batting average.
In those four games, Stanford hit
seven home runs, after hitting
only 15 in its first 30 games.
The pitching has also been con
sistent of late. Stan Spencer, who
was the Cardinal's hard luck
pitcher at the beginning of the
season has moved in as the No.
1 starter while Mike Mussina is
out with an iryury. After starting
the season 0-5, Spencer has re
cently improved his record to 2-5.
He pitched a complete game
against USC in a 9-2 victory last

Friday. Brian Keyser has also
moved into a starting role after
recording a season-high seven
strikeouts in 5V6 innings against
UCLA.
With conference season at its
halfway mark, Stanford is tied for
last place with UCLA at 5-10. One
Bay Area newspaper recently pre

dicted that the Cardinal would
finish with a season record of 26-
32, but if the team continues to
improve the way it did last week,
that newspaper will be more than
just a little bit wrong.
Card Notes
Starting ace Mussina is still

sidelined with a strained tendon in
his right elbow which has caused him
to miss his last three starts. It will
be determined later in the week
whether he can pitch this weekend
against Arizona State.
Stat of the day: Stanford is unde
feated when it scores more than 10
runs.


Ken Beer â€” Daily file
Starting pitcher Mike Mussina could return to action this weekend against Arizona State. The Cardinal
has been hitting more for power and playing better defense in the past few games, factors that
enabled It to take two games from USC last weekend. Stanford is now only two games under .500.
