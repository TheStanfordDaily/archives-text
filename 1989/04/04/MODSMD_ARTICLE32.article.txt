STANFORD'S STARTER - Brian Keyser (2-2, 6.57 ERA)
WHO'S HOT — Left fielder Jack Hollis was 5-for-10 over the weekend
against USC, including his first collegiate home run. Frank Carey leads
the team with a .339 average and was 7-for-13 last weekend. After
committing 47 errors in its first 22 games, the Cardinal has only had
nine miscues in its last 12 contests, boosting the team's fielding percentage
to .979. Tops on the most improved list in the fielding category is
shortstop Troy Paulsen, who has been error-free in the last 17 games
after 15 boots in the first 16 games of the season.
WHO'S NOT — In his last two appearances, pitcher Mark Carper has
gone 5% innings, giving up four runs and seven hits. Pitcher Scott
Weiss started the season 3-0 but has hit hard times of late, taking five
straight losses. He has lost his last four starts and has failed to get
through the third inning in his last three starts.
KEYS TO VICTORY — Since the Cardinal started conference play this
season, it has gone 3-0 against non-conference opponents in midweek
games. In those three games, Stanford has won those three games by
an average margin of 5.7 runs. This is a good chance for the bullpen
pitchers to get in some solid work, and if the defense holds up as well
as it has lately, the Cardinal should romp.
