# Regrets of a sportswriter in the difficult 'Real World'
## 
### 
They were a nationally-ranked bas
ketball team, and they were my
schoolmates.
I've been covering Stanford sports for
The Daily since October, 1985. I'm also
hoping to continue sportswriting after I
leave Stanford in June, but given the job
situation out there in what's carelessly
and thoughtlessly labeled "The Real
World" may make that point moot.
Regardless, though I have had times
both good and bad in the past and hope
the same await me in the future, I don't
think I will ever have an assignment as
difficult in its own way as covering the
1988-89 Stanford men's basketball team.
Just like in the Sure anti-perspirant
commercial, there are three "nevers" in
the journalism business. The first two
are: Never print untruths, and never
print exaggerations.
I will freely admit that I was hardly
tested on the first point, and happily

violated the second. I mean, there were
hardly any Oklahoma-style scandals here
to dredge up or cover up.
And, when Stanford romped over Cal
ifornia 97-71 in February, and I came
back from the game to find out the story
was running on the front page of The
Daily, I pulled out every mixed metaphor
and every ludicrous simile I could think

of. That game had just been an unadul
terated amount of fun, and in"The Real
World" you don't get the chance to cel
ebrate that in print the way you'd like,
unless you write for the San Francisco
Chronicle. (Oops, I'm applying for a job
there, too.)
But, getting back to the "nevers."
No. 3: Never be biased.
This, too, I violated, but not as
happily. I wanted to be a good reporter,
a reporter worthy of covering the best
Stanford men's basketball team since
1942 and a reporter worthy of The Daily's
choicest sports assignment of the year.
I came up short.
There were some things going on dur
ing the season regarding the performance
of the team that I didn't ask about. These
were questions that should have been
asked.
Andrew Vlahov has proved himself to

be a great passer. But why does he have
a reputation as an outside shooter, when
his outside shooting appears to be so
inadequate?
Eric Reveno has a fine jump hook. But
his turn-around shot was far from auto
matic. Why didn't he learn not to force
up those fallaways and make the extra
pass instead?
I didn't want to ask these questions,
the hard-nosed questions, the potentially
insulting questions. I didn't want to be
cause these were — are — my school
mates. They aren't my best friends, but
they are friends.
It probably wouldn't have done them
any significant harm if I had asked them
these kinds of questions. The players had
never shown any problems with any ques
tions I had asked before, and those ques
tions weren't all sugar canes and pepper
mint snaps.
But somehow I felt you just don't go

up to a friend at Stanford and politely
query, "Why aren't you doing better?"
After all, these basketball games are
just like final exams. There's practice,
where they may know everything cold,
and then there's the game, where they
may or may not show it. It's not like
these guys, though they may think poorly
of an article I've written, go up to me
and say "What are you doing writing
that garbage?"
So I'm walking underneath the
Greensboro Coliseum stands on my
way to the Stanford locker room,
20 minutes after the Cardinal's 80-78
loss to Siena in the NCAA tournament
first round.
I get to the locker room door and I'm
about to walk in, but then something
makes me stop. What the hell am I going


JON WEISMAN
to ask these guys?
I stood, stupidly, outside the
locker room for about a minute.
I then resolved to ease my way
in. I'd go first and talk to Adam
Keefe, who had the one game that
was pretty much flawless by a
Cardinal player that day.
It was no great surprise that
inside the locker room everyone
looked as if their Christmas tree
had been stolen from them. But
I pressed on toward Adam, and
asked him some relatively harm
less questions. What exactly hap
pened on the last play? Did you
guys think you would come back?
I then moved over to Howard
Wright. Against Siena, Howard
had one of the games that I most
disliked asking about. He failed
to dominate in a game where
everyone thought he would, and
in addition, he missed four free
throws in a two-point loss. I really
didn't know how I would begin.
But Howard jumped the gun
on me. Before I could start, he
looked up at my shirt and asked
(as jokingly as he could have given
the atmosphere), "What hap
pened, you couldn't find an iron
at the hotel?"
As it happens, I have used an
iron maybe three times in my life,

and palm readers could perenni
ally have field days looking at the
wrinkles in my clothing.
But when Howard asked that
question, I realized somehow that
he didn't need the kind of protec
tion (such as it was) that I had
been providing all season. He was
as depressed as anyone about the
loss, yet already I knew, with that
quip, that he would recover. The
next day, in the Bay Area press,
he was vilified. Yet I don't doubt
that he has recovered from that
as well.
I hope, now that I am done
covering basketball, now that I
have covered my last sport at
Stanford, that I will get to talk
to these guys some more, my
schoolmates, before I leave what
will always to me will have been
"The Real World."
I also hope that somewhere
down the road, there will be a
locker room, and Todd Lichti or
Howard Wright or Adam Keefe
will be in it as a member of an
NBA team, and I will be there as
a member of a professional news
paper.
But that's all hope. What I
know, however, is that if that hap
pens, I'm going to ask them the
right questions, easy or painful,
and they're going to answer them,
easily or painfully.
And after that is done, we'll all
reminisce about what a great
season 1988-89 was.
