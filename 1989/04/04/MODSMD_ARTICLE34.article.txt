# 'Dan the Man' kills competition
## 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
Much hype and hoopla has sur
rounded this year's version of the Stan
ford men's volleyball team, and deser
vedly so. The squad's current Western
Intercollegiate Volleyball Association
record of 12-2, already a vast improve
ment on last year's 5-13 mark, is good
enough to place Stanford among the
league's contenders for the National
Championship.
In a season in which the Stanford
volleyball program has made such dra
matic strides, it is easy to suggest that
the squad's newcomers are responsible
for the turnaround. Scott Fortune, re
turning from his awe-inspiring con
quests at Seoul this summer, has cer
tainly been a huge contributor to the
Cardinal cause, as has been superfrosh
Duncan Blackman.
But, while the arms of the Cardinal
hurricane have been wreaking havoc
throughout the WIVA this season, there
has been one steadying force at the
center of that destruction. Indeed, at
the eye of the Cardinal hurricane stands
the ever-present Dan Hanan.
Most recently, in Stanford's hard
fought, five-game victory against UC-
Irvine, Hanan had 30 kills and a .458
hitting percentage on a night when Stan
ford hit only .171 as a team.
The night before, Hanan chipped in
a .370 percentage to the Cardinal cause
as Stanford won a four-game match
from San Diego State. And the list of
good showings for Hanan goes on and
on and on.
The fact of the matter is that, more
often than Coach Fred Sturm would
like, Stanford has climbed up on
Hanan's ever-so-broad shoulders and
ridden to victory. "Dan the Man," as
many of the Cardinal faithful at Maples
are wont to call him, is simply always
there — checking in with hitting per
centages that are, without exception, in
excess of .300.
Consistency. It's probably the one
word that captures what Dan Hanan,
the volleyball player, is all about. In
fact, as teammate and longtime friend
Dave Johnson comments, the team prof
its from his consistency in more ways
than one.
"Dan really leads by example,"
Johnson said. "We all see how consistent

he is and how hard he works, and those
qualities give us something to strive for
and to model ourselves after. He may
not be the most vocal player, but he
nonetheless is a great team leader."
Flashback to the summer of 1985.
Coach Sturm and then co-Coach Don
Shaw are attending the Junior National
Championships at California. Shaw has
heard of Hanan and points him out
offhandedly to Sturm, who gets only a
fleeting glimpse of the soon-to-be high
school senior.
Little did Sturm know that he had
gotten a glimpse of the future of Stan
ford volleyball, an integral cog in the
quickly-evolving Cardinal machine.
Turning his back on the lures of other
college programs, UCLA and UC-Santa
Barbara being two of the more deter
mined wooers, Hanan opted for the
palm trees of the Farm.
As a freshman, Hanan faced the
prospect of being strictly a role player,
as Rob Peterson occupied the starting
middle blocker slot at the season's out
set.
However, by the time a mid-February
match against UCLA rolled around,
Hanan had taken over the job, and he
has been a starter ever since. "His time
just came," Sturm explained flatly, as
if Fate had a hand in the move to start
Hanan.
"He works as hard if not harder than
all of the players I've ever coached,"
Sturm said, and that exceptional work
ethic propelled Hanan to greater heights
toward the end of his freshman year.
But most importantly, the stage was set
for Hanan's sophomore year, a year that
would create the mold for his entire
volleyball career.
In his second season, Hanan became
the heart and soul of Stanford volley
ball. Quite a flattering label, but a for
midable burden as well. With Fortune
lost to the national team, Hanan re
ceived the vast mtyority of Parker Black
man's sets. The Cardinal's opponents,
of course, knew this, and at times
Hanan had to beat three blockers to
get a kill.
Hanan reflects on the season:
"Looking back, I can see how it (the
excessive attention he received from
other defenses) could have easily been
frustrating. But, at the time, it didn't
seem that bad — probably because I'd
never hit under any other conditions.

"I really learned a lot, gained a lot
of confidence, and continued to improve
my timing and my quickness. Since high
school, I have always had the reputation
of 'running the fastest one'; quickness
is the most important trait a middle
blocker can have."
"Of course there were some down
times. We just weren't winning very
much. Maybe the most encouraging
thing that happened was on a southern
road trip. We were playing at UCLA,
and Scott (Fortune) was there. He could
tell I was a little frustrated, and he
came up to me and said, 'Just hang in
there.' It was then that I realized that
Stanford volleyball was on its way up."
Speaking of his All-World and Olym
pic teammate Fortune, Hanan has noth
ing but good things to say. "I've always
kind of thought of him as a volleyball
god; his international experience is truly
impressive. He's been up against the
world's best."
In fact, Fortune returned to Stanford
carrying all of the acclaim that Hanan
alluded to, and he, along with Hanan,
entered the season as a leading candi
date for NCAA Player of the Year
honors.
With the two teammates as con
tenders for that extremely special indi
vidual honor, some Cardinal fans
worried that some tension might seep
into the relationship between the two
Cardinal stars.
Fred Sturm shrugged off any such
thoughts when he said, "I feel that Dan
and Scott are both team-oriented
enough that such an individual award
would receive only secondary consider
ations."
And Hanan dismissed the idea as well,
saying, "As I see it, there is nothing
but mutual respect between us."
And besides, the two players have
such a symbiotic relationship, there
really should be nothing but har
monious relations between the two.
Case in point: Hanan's sophomore
season was a struggle without Fortune,
as mentioned before. But Fortune has
experienced Hanan-less volleyball as
well. In the first match against Hawaii
earlier this year, Hanan sat out with
the flu. And, as the Rainbow-Warrior
blockers keyed on Fortune time and
time again, things were more difficult

for Stanford's outside hitter.
Hawaii won that match in three
straight. With both weapons on
the court, however, Stanford has
shown that it is capable of beating
anybody in the land.
"Sometimes I worry that (For
tune) is saying 'Oh no, he's set
ting Hanan again,' " Hanan joked.
But while Hanan is leading the
nation in hitting percentage (.424
before the break), even Karch
Kiraly couldn't complain.
When asked about his aspira
tions for the near future, Hanan
listed a national title at the top
of the list. Beyond that, he in
timated that playing for the na
tional team would be his next
goal. In an understatement, Coach
Sturm commented on Hanan's
chances, saying, "I think he'd be
an excellent candidate."
Indeed, Hanan seems to be well
on his way to achieving that goal;
he has participated in the Olympic
Festival, one of the main prelim
inaries for national competition.
And his collegiate honors, in
cluding Second Team All-WTVA
and Third Team All-America last
year (on a team that had a 5-13
league record), seem to reveal him
as a very real candidate.
