# VanDerveer best coach in the land
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
HUSTON, La. - Finally, that
which has been to Stanford fans
a foregone conclusion is now a
reality.
Capping off the most success
ful season in Cardinal women's
basketball history, Tara VanDer
veer has been named the Con
verse National Coach of the
Year. The announcement, made
March 2nd, came just five days
after she was named Converse
District VIII Coach of the Year
and seven after earning Pacific
10 Conference coaching honors.
The award was officially be
stowed in a special ceremony last
weekend at the Final Four in
Tacoma, Wash.
"This is quite an honor to be
selected by my peers," VanDer
veer said, "although I prefer to
look at this as a team award. If
your players work hard, good
things will happen."
Indeed, hard work and good
things have characterized the
1988-89 season for VanDerveer
and her charges. Starting with
a school and Pac-10 record 119-
62 win in the season opener
against Wisconsin, the Cardinal
rolled off 26 regular season wins
with but two losses, to No. 1
Tennessee and No. 13 North
Carolina State on the road.
Included in the 26 victories
was a 20-game winning streak
coinciding with an 18-0 sweep
of the Pac-10, the first such oc

currence in league history. The
result was a No. 4 ranking in
the final Associated Press poll
and the No. 2 seed in the Mid
west Region of the NCAA Tour
nament.
"It's really pretty obvious she
has done a good job," said Lou
isiana Tech Coach Leon Bar
more, last year's honoree. "I
have watched her effort and how
she's gone about it little by little.

Hard work has
characterized the
1988-89 season for
VanDerveer and her
charges.

"I don't think Texas wanted
to see them this year, because
last year they were just too
young to beat Texas there. But
you could see the greatness com
ing, even at this point in time
last year."
Barmore first saw the Cardi
nal in last year's Midwest Re
gional, where top-seed and host
Texas beat Stanford in the semi
final game. The squad fared bet
ter this year, soundly beating
lowa in the semifinal and reach
ing the finals before falling to
Barmore's defending NCAA
champion team on Tech's home
floor by a mere 10 points.
"I don't think anybody had

any inkling at the time of her
hiring that Stanford basketball
would would explode onto the
national scene as it has," senior
Emily Wagner said. "This award
is a tribute to Tara's vision."
"I think Tara is an amazing
coach," junior Katy Steding said.
"This award is just a refection
of the hard work and effort that

she has put in for us at Stan
ford."
Card note
In other women's basketball
news pertaining to Washington,
Wagner also has reason to cele
brate. Long-time boyfriend Matt
Gallagher proposed, and the two
are now engaged to be married.
