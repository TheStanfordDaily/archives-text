A little fun in the sun did the
Stanford women's golf team a
whole lot of good, as the Cardinal
finished first in the Rainbow
Wahine Invitational tournament
in Honolulu over spring break.

The win was the Cardinal's first
of the season, and provided many
signs of hope for further suc
cesses.
Freshman Adele Moore dis
played the talents that made her
the most highly recruited amateur
of 1988 as she shot a three-round
224, settling for second place in
dividually after a four-hole
playoff. Moore's blistering pace
helped Stanford edge out New
Mexico by two strokes, 916-918.
It wasn't all sun in Hawaii,
however. "The wind was making
a lot of the holes tough, and it
made the course play more diffi
cult than the course rating (indi
cated)," Moore said.
"I played pretty well compared
to (the rating) though."
Moore wasn't the only Cardinal
star, however. Stanford put forth
perhaps their best team effort all
season, as sophomore Jodi Figley
came in sixth, five strokes behind
Moore and winner Wendy Werley
of New Mexico. Figley has been
the Cardinal's most consistent
player this year, rarely finishing
out of the top 10 in a tournament.

Freshman Stephanie Davis
posted at a final round 75 to come
in 11th, nine strokes back. Audrey
Wooding and Stephanie Parel
were no less important in the close
tournament. Each shot a 235 to
finish tied at 13th.
Stanford defeated menace New
Mexico, a top 20 team, by shooting
an amazing 298 in the second
round of the tourney. It was the
low round in the seven-team com
petition. "We could've shot bet
ter," said Moore, the Texas
prodigy. "We had average first and
third rounds — in the second
round we shot the lights out."
"Adele Moore played the best
golf she has all year," Coach Tim
Baldwin said. "But everyone did
their part."
The Cardinal entered the final
round two shots ahead of the
Lobos, and nearly lost it as Figley
and Moore shot their highest
rounds. Davis's 75 was six strokes
better than her first-round score
and saved Stanford.
As it turned out, the Cardinal's
309 was only matched by the
Lobos, who could not match their
previous rounds of 302 and 307.
Brigham Young, Nebraska, Long
Beach State, Hawaii, and Wash
ington State rounded out the
field.
Next up for Stanford will be
the Lady Sun Devil Tournament
April 10-12.
