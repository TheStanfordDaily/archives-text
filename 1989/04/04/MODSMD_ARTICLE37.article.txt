## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
If the early part of the Stanford
men's tennis team's season is any
indication, the squad is going to
have more than >ts share of tight
matches in the weeks ahead. For
tunately for the Cardinal, the
team has thus far shown a knack
for pulling out the close ones.

Men's Tennis
Cardinal 5, Wildcats 4
Cardinal 5, Sun Devils 4

The weekend wins over the Ar
izona schools, combined with an
8-1 trouncing of Brigham Young
at home earlier in the week, gave
Stanford an 8-2 record (2-0 in the
Pacific 10 Conference). The Car
dinal, ranked fifth in the latest
Volvo/Intercollegiate Tennis
Coaches Association poll, hosts
No. 24 Long Beach State at Stan
ford Tennis Stadium this after
noon.
Stanford has established an
early-season pattern: Either the
team blows its opponents away —
such as the two trouncings of San
Jose State, the BYU thrashing
and the romp over West Virginia
— or it wins a 5-4 squeaker (wit
ness the win over UC-Irvine and
this weekend's matches). A win,
though, is a win, and the Cardinal
was more than happy to start the
Pac-10 season with a pair of them.
Stanford's wins came without
the services of sophomore Martin
Blackman, who came down with
a case of chicken pox. (Blackman
should be back in action this
week.)
The loss of Blackman, who has
played the No. 2 or No. 3 singles
spot this year, not only called for
a change in the team's singles
lineup, but in its doubles slate as
well. Jeff Tarango, who normally

pairs with Blackman, played with
freshman Alex O'Brien in the No.
1 doubles spot during the week
end.
"We're still experimenting a
little with doubles," Stanford
Asst. Coach John Whitlinger said.
"I'm not sure even if (Blackman)
had been there, what the lineup
would have been."
The pairing of O'Brien and
Tar an go paid hage dividends, as
the two won both their matches,
the only Stanford team to do so.
In fact, their wins clinched both
matches for the Cardinal.
On Friday at Tucson, Stanford
took two of the three doubles
matches to down No. 13 Arizona
after the Wildcats had matched
the Cardinal at singles, emerging
with a 3-3 split. Tarango, back
from a wrist injury that has
caused him to sit out several of
the Cardinal's matches, coasted
to a 6-3, 6-3 win over Doug
Livingston. Jeff Cathrall, playing
at No. 2, slammed David Klem
bith 6-3, 6-2.
After Tarango and Cathrall,
however, Stanford's singles game
went sour. O'Brien fell 6-3, 5-7,
6-4 to Scott Sigerseth, Glenn
Solomon lost to Jeff Spier 6-4,
6-4, and Curtis Dunn was downed
7-5, 6-4 by Thad Langford. Barry
Richards' 6-4, 6-2 win over Jorge
Rendon gave the Cardinal a split
going into the doubles.
All three doubles matches went
the distance, as Sigerseth and
Langford paired at No. 2 to down
Cathrall and Dan Turbow. How
ever, Richards and Eric Peus held
off several match points at No. 3
to defeat Rendon and Spier 3-6,
6-2, 7-5 to set up Tarango and
O'Brien's 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 clincher
over Livingston and Klembith.
The going got tougher at Ari
zona State on Saturday, as the

Sun Devils put up a huge struggle
before falling. Both Tarango and
Cathrall won again, but each had
to come from behind. Cathrall
beat Dave Lomicky 4-6, 6-1, 6-3
to run his dual-match record to
9-1. He has also moved up to No.
37 in the national singles
rankings.
Tarango had a bit more trouble,
needing an overwhelming per
formance in the third-set tie
breaker to down Brian Gyetko 4-
6, 6-4, 7-6. Tarango took an in
surmountable 6-0 lead in the
breaker to ice the win.
O'Brien rebounded from his
loss on Friday to defeat Dan Mar
ting 6-3, 6-2. "Alex did a nice job,"
Whitlinger said. "[On Fridayl
Sigerseth played great, maybe as
well as he could, to beat Alex, but
Alex came back really well Satur
day."
Richards won again at No. 6,
pasting Craig Purcell 6-2, 6-2, but
Solomon and Dunn each fell,
giving the Cardinal a 4-2 lead
going into the doubles.
"Jeff and Alex really came
through," Whitlinger said. "All
the guys really played
well. .. . Anytime you can win two
like that on the road, you've really
accomplished something."

well. .. . Anytime you can win two
like that on the road, you've really

Curtis Dunn and the Stanford men's tennis team opened Its Pac-10 season last week.
If the early part of the Stanford
men's tennis team's season is any
indication, the squad is going to
have more than >ts share of tight
matches in the weeks ahead. For
tunately for the Cardinal, the
team has thus far shown a knack
for pulling out the close ones.

Men's Tennis
Cardinal 5, Wildcats 4
Cardinal 5, Sun Devils 4

The weekend wins over the Ar
izona schools, combined with an
8-1 trouncing of Brigham Young
at home earlier in the week, gave
Stanford an 8-2 record (2-0 in the
Pacific 10 Conference). The Car
dinal, ranked fifth in the latest
Volvo/Intercollegiate Tennis
Coaches Association poll, hosts
No. 24 Long Beach State at Stan
ford Tennis Stadium this after
noon.
Stanford has established an
early-season pattern: Either the
team blows its opponents away —
such as the two trouncings of San
Jose State, the BYU thrashing
and the romp over West Virginia
— or it wins a 5-4 squeaker (wit
ness the win over UC-Irvine and
this weekend's matches). A win,
though, is a win, and the Cardinal
was more than happy to start the
Pac-10 season with a pair of them.
Stanford's wins came without
the services of sophomore Martin
Blackman, who came down with
a case of chicken pox. (Blackman
should be back in action this
week.)
The loss of Blackman, who has
played the No. 2 or No. 3 singles
spot this year, not only called for
a change in the team's singles
lineup, but in its doubles slate as
well. Jeff Tarango, who normally

pairs with Blackman, played with
freshman Alex O'Brien in the No.
1 doubles spot during the week
end.
"We're still experimenting a
little with doubles," Stanford
Asst. Coach John Whitlinger said.
"I'm not sure even if (Blackman)
had been there, what the lineup
would have been."
The pairing of O'Brien and
Tar an go paid hage dividends, as
the two won both their matches,
the only Stanford team to do so.
In fact, their wins clinched both
matches for the Cardinal.
On Friday at Tucson, Stanford
took two of the three doubles
matches to down No. 13 Arizona
after the Wildcats had matched
the Cardinal at singles, emerging
with a 3-3 split. Tarango, back
from a wrist injury that has
caused him to sit out several of
the Cardinal's matches, coasted
to a 6-3, 6-3 win over Doug
Livingston. Jeff Cathrall, playing
at No. 2, slammed David Klem
bith 6-3, 6-2.
After Tarango and Cathrall,
however, Stanford's singles game
went sour. O'Brien fell 6-3, 5-7,
6-4 to Scott Sigerseth, Glenn
Solomon lost to Jeff Spier 6-4,
6-4, and Curtis Dunn was downed
7-5, 6-4 by Thad Langford. Barry
Richards' 6-4, 6-2 win over Jorge
Rendon gave the Cardinal a split
going into the doubles.
All three doubles matches went
the distance, as Sigerseth and
Langford paired at No. 2 to down
Cathrall and Dan Turbow. How
ever, Richards and Eric Peus held
off several match points at No. 3
to defeat Rendon and Spier 3-6,
6-2, 7-5 to set up Tarango and
O'Brien's 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 clincher
over Livingston and Klembith.
The going got tougher at Ari
zona State on Saturday, as the

Sun Devils put up a huge struggle
before falling. Both Tarango and
Cathrall won again, but each had
to come from behind. Cathrall
beat Dave Lomicky 4-6, 6-1, 6-3
to run his dual-match record to
9-1. He has also moved up to No.
37 in the national singles
rankings.
Tarango had a bit more trouble,
needing an overwhelming per
formance in the third-set tie
breaker to down Brian Gyetko 4-
6, 6-4, 7-6. Tarango took an in
surmountable 6-0 lead in the
breaker to ice the win.
O'Brien rebounded from his
loss on Friday to defeat Dan Mar
ting 6-3, 6-2. "Alex did a nice job,"
Whitlinger said. "[On Fridayl
Sigerseth played great, maybe as
well as he could, to beat Alex, but
Alex came back really well Satur
day."
Richards won again at No. 6,
pasting Craig Purcell 6-2, 6-2, but
Solomon and Dunn each fell,
giving the Cardinal a 4-2 lead
going into the doubles.
"Jeff and Alex really came
through," Whitlinger said. "All
the guys really played
well. .. . Anytime you can win two
like that on the road, you've really
accomplished something."
