### 
SEATTLE (AP) - Rumeal Rob
inson made two free throws with
three seconds left in overtime
Monday night to give Michigan
its first national championship
and cap the improbable ride of
interim head coach Steve Fisher
with an 80-79 victory over Seton
Hall.
Fisher had taken over the Mich
igan team just two days before
the NCAA tournament began and
coached them to the six victories
needed for the national title.
The championship game was
the fifth to go into overtime and
the first since Loyola, 111., beat
Cincinnati 60-58 in 1963.
"I am the happiest man alive,"
Fisher said. "Rumeal is such a
gutsy kid."
Glen Rice was the player who
carried Fisher and the Wolverines
to the title with 31 points in the
final, giving him an NCAA tour
nament record 184, breaking the
24-year-old mark of 177 set by
Bill Bradley of Princeton.
Robinson, who finished with 21
points and 11 assists, got his
chance to be the hero when he
was fouled by Gerald Greene, who
had missed the front end of a
one-and-one with 1:17 remaining
and Seton Hall leading 79-76.
Terry Mills made a turnaround
jumper with 56 seconds left to

bring the Wolverines within one.
Seton Hall worked the 45-second
shot clock down and John Morton,
who finished with 35 points,
tossed up an airball with 11
seconds left.
Michigan brought the ball
downcourt and Robinson began a
drive to the basket when he was
fouled before shooting. Robinson
nailed the free throws and, after
two Pirate timeouts, Daryll
Walker's final desperation 3-
pointer banged off the glass and
rim and Michigan had its first
national championship in three
title-game appearances.
Michigan lost to UCLA 91-80
in 1965 and to Indiana 86-68 in
1976.
Rice opened the overtime with
a jumper that was answered by
Andrew Gaze's 3-pointer, his first
field goal of the game. The teams
exchanged leads three more times,
with Seton Hall's final lead com
ing on a 3-pointer by Morton with
2:41 to play.
Morton scored 22 of Seton
Hall's last 28 points in regulation,
including a 3-pointer with 25
seconds remaining to tie the game
71-71. Michigan led 59-49 on a
3-pointer by Rice with 8:26 to go.
Seton Hall ran off eight straight
points, Morton scoring the last
six. And after an exchange of free
throws, Rice hit a 3-pointer that
gave him the NCAA tournament
scoring record and the Wolverines
a 64-59 lead with 6:05 to play.
With Michigan leading 66-61,
Morton scored six straight points
as Seton Hall's defense came away
with two steals, and the Pirates

had their first lead of the second
half with 2:14 to play. Walker's
free throw gave the Pirates a two
point advantage and Rice once
again got the lead back for Mich
igan with a 3-pointer with 1:03
to play.
After Morton's airball with 53
seconds left, Michigan ran the
clock down to 34 seconds before
Sean Higgins made two free
throws for the three-point lead
that was erased by Morton's 3-
pointer.
Michigan had a chance for vic
tory in regulation, but Rice
missed a long jumper with two
seconds to play.
Higgins added 10 points and
nine rebounds for Michigan, 30-7.
Rice added 11 rebounds.
Walker and Greene each
finished with 13 points for Seton
Hall, 31-7, which was making its
first Final Four appearance in just
its second NCAA tournament.
As for Fisher's future at Mich
igan, athletic director Bo Schem
bechler said: "I think we ought
to interview Steve Fisher. The
team was magnificent and Steve
Fisher did a great job."
Seton Hall stayed outside in the
first half with 14 of its 32 field
goal attempts coming from 3-
point range, while Michigan
decided to test things inside.
The problem for the Pirates,
who averaged 14 3-point shots per
game in the regular season, was
that they made only four of the
long jumpers. The last two — by
Greene and Morton — capped a
12-0 run that turned a six-point
deficit into a 26-20 lead.
