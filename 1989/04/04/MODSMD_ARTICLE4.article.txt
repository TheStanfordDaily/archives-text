# Round 2: SCLC seeks narrower definition

Shelving its much-protested in
terpretation of the Fundamental
Standard, the Student Conduct
Legislative Council last night took
its first steps in writing a new
proposal that more narrowly
defines which types of expression
violate the student code of con
duct.
In their meeting yesterday, the
12-member council discussed a
new proposal written by council
chair George Parker and modified
by Law Prof. Tom Grey, a legal
consultant to the council.
Parker, who is out of town this
week, was unavailable for com
ment.
Grey, who is also co-chair of the
Stanford Judicial Council, said
the new draft, which has not yet
been released, is "clearly intended
to be narrower" than the original
proposal and defines Fundamen
tal Standard violations "beyond
expression that's offensive."
But the council agreed that cer
tain words in the new proposal
need to be more clearly defined.

Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole,
who led the meeting in Parker's
absence, suggested that the coun
cil — composed of six professors,
five students and Cole, the only
non-voting member — break up
into smaller groups during the
coming week to work out the
stickier passages of the new draft.
The council also decided to com
pose "surrounding text" that
would accompany new proposed
legislation so that its "intentions
are made perfectly clear," said
Philosophy Prof. John Perry, a
council member.
Numerous professors and Uni
versity officials claimed that the
council's proposal last month was
too far-reaching in restricting free
expression, but Perry said the
Stanford community "totally
misunderstood" the previous
proposal and "interpreted [it] in
ways we never thought of."
Although University lawyers,
including General Counsel John
Schwartz, strongly argued against
the previous proposal, Grey pre
dicted that the new draft is one
they "probably won't like ... but
[one they] can live with."
