# Economics prof. picked to join Boskin's council

### John Wagner Editorial staff 
A second professor in Stan
ford's Economics Department will
most likely make the trek east to
serve as a policy adviser to Pres
ident Bush.
During finals week, Prof. John
Taylor was nominated by Bush
to serve on the three-member
Council of Economic Advisers.
Stanford Economics Prof. Michael
Boskin was named chair of the
council in December, and his ap
pointment was recently confirmed
by the Senate.
Taylor's appointment is also
contingent on Senate confirma
tion. Taylor told The Daily that
his confirmation hearings had not
yet been scheduled by the Senate
Banking Committee, and it would
probably take four to six weeks

for the appointment to be ap
proved.
John Shoven, chair of Stan
ford's Economics Department,
said Bush's nomination of Taylor
was an "enlightened choice." Ac
cording to Shoven, Taylor has a
"world-economy perspective" that
should prove extremely useful in
formulating policy during the next
few years.
Taylor said he thought he would
make his greatest contributions
in forecasting macroeconomic
policy, dealing with the Federal
Reserve, coping with the Savings
and Loan crisis, and formulating
policy on Third World debt.
According to Shoven, another
of Taylor's strengths is his knowl
edge of the Japanese economy. In
the spring of 1986, Taylor served
as a consultant to the Bank of
Japan, the Japanese equivalent to

the Federal Reserve Board.
During the next few years, "a
lot of the international economic
issues will relate to our dealings
with Japan," Taylor said.
Taylor said he is "definitely"
looking forward to working with


John Taylor
Boskin in Washington, D.C. His
Stanford colleague is doing "a
great job so far," Taylor added.
Taylor said his economic policy
views are "pretty close" to those
of Boskin. The "flexible freeze,"
a strategy which Boskin formu
lated, has been quite effective thus
far, Taylor said.
The appointment to the Council
of Economic Advisers carries no

specific term, Taylor said, so it is
"difficult to say" how long he will
remain as an adviser to Bush.
Shoven said Taylor would prob
ably be on leave from Stanford
for just one academic year. How
ever, Taylor speculated that he
might stay in Washington for up
to two years.
"It depends on how it goes,"
Taylor said.
The moves east by Boskin and
now Taylor will be "mÂ£y'or but
temporary" losses for the Eco
nomics Department, Shovin said.
