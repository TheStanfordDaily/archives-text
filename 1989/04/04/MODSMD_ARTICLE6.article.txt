# Webb unionizers secure vote
## 
### Eric Young Editorial staff 
After weeks of legal grappling with the United
Stanford Workers, Webb Ranch has agreed to allow
its resident laborers to vote Thursday whether to
join the union.
Webb Ranch has opposed the workers' efforts to
unionize and has disputed USW claims that living
and working conditions are substandard at the
ranch, a vegetable and berry farm located on Stan
ford land.
In February, 49 of the 54 workers signed a petition
to be allowed to join the union, according to USW
field representative Reuben Serna.
Ranch managers and the USW left the bargaining
table last week after agreeing to an "oral interim
agreement" which chiefly secures the right to hold
elections.
The interim agreement, according to Serna, also
calls for the ranch operators to solve the workers'
housing problems and negotiate a new contract if
the workers vote to unionize.
In return, the USW will help the labor camp —
which has received considerable media attention for
over 70 health and safety viola
tions reported by San Mateo
County inspectors — measure up
to county standards.
The union also agreed to drop
efforts to extend a temporary
restraining order filed Feb. 22

against the ranch. Granted by a
San Mateo County judge, the
restraining order prohibited resi
dent ranch workers from being
evicted. It expired last Thursday.
Both sides are now bargaining
informally over which of the 54
workers will be allowed to vote
and where the election will be
held. If these issues are not re
solved by Thursday, the election
will most likely be delayed.
