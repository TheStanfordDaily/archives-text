San Mateo County inspectors returned to
Webb Ranch two weeks ago to find that more
than two-thirds of its 70-plus health and safety
violations had been rectified since they were
discovered during a February inspection.
Brian Zamora, county director of environ
mental health, said last Thursday that 49 of
75 violations were taken care of. According to
Zamora, some of the more severe violations
centered on leaky pipes and inoperable heaters.
The most significant violation — overcrowd
ing in some of the laborers' living quarters
— could not be eliminated due to a county
judge's temporary restraining order granted
to the United Stanford Workers on Feb. 22.
