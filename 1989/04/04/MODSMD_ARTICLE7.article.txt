San Mateo County inspectors returned to
Webb Ranch two weeks ago to find that more
than two-thirds of its 70-plus health and safety
violations had been rectified since they were
discovered during a February inspection.
Brian Zamora, county director of environ
mental health, said last Thursday that 49 of
75 violations were taken care of. According to
Zamora, some of the more severe violations
centered on leaky pipes and inoperable heaters.
The most significant violation — overcrowd
ing in some of the laborers' living quarters
— could not be eliminated due to a county
judge's temporary restraining order granted
to the United Stanford Workers on Feb. 22.
That order, which prevented Webb
Ranch operators from evicting
workers from housing, expired
Thursday.
Zamora said "the bottom line"
is that Webb Ranch was not found

to have "any significant public
health violations" during the sec
ond inspection.
The USW is nevertheless still
pursuing a class action lawsuit
filed on behalf of workers that
seeks damages related to alleged
"substandard" housing.
Zamora announced that the
next surprise inspection is sched
uled for this week.
