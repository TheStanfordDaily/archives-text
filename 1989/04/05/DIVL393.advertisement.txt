STANFORD ALCOHOL POLICY
Student conduct at Stanford is guided by the Fundamental Standard, which states the
expectation that students will act in ways that demonstrate respect for order, morality,
personal honor and the rights of others. Implicit in the Standard is the understanding that
students are responsible for making their own decisions and accepting the consequences of
those decisions. The University, as an educational institution, approaches student conduct
issues from a perspective that places greater emphasis on individual responsibility and
development than on regulatory measures.
Many members of the Stanford community have particular questions about alcohol and
the University. Students and others should be aware of state and local laws about possessing,
serving and consuming alcohol and make informed decisions about alcohol use. The purpose
of this alcohol policy is to provide further guidance to students and others about alcohol.
POLICY: The University expects students to be responsible for the consequences of their
decisions to serve and consume alcohol and to create environments that are safe and
healthful and that promote responsible behavior.
There are several likely consequences if students are not responsible in their decisions to
serve and consume alcohol:
(1) the conduct may be a violation of the University Residential Agreement, subjecting
the student to loss of University housing;
(2) the conduct may be a violation of the Fundamental Standard, subjecting the student to
discipline, including suspension or explusion; and
(3) the conduct may be a violation of state and local laws concerning possessing, serving
and consumption of alcohol which might result in a student's arrest, prosecution, conviction
and punishment in the criminal justice system.
ALCOHOL, STUDENTS AND THE LAW
SOME RELEVANT ASPECTS OF CALIFORNIA LAW - Under Californ law, it is a criminal
offense:
1) for anyone to buy alcohol for, serve or otherwise supply alcohol to any person under 21 or to
any obviously intoxicated person, regardless of age. (BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS
CODE 25658; 25602)
2) for anyone under the age of 21 to purchase alcohol (B&P CODE 25658)
3) to have in one's possession or to use false evidence of age and identity to purchase alcohol
(B&P CODE 25661)
4) to be under the influence of alcohol in a public place and unable to exercise care for one's
own safety or that of others. (PENAL CODE 647)
5) to operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other intoxicants.
(VEHICLE CODE 23152) 6) for persons under 21 to have an open containers of alcohol
in any place open to the public or in a motor vehicle. (B&P CODE 25662 & VEHICLE
CODE 23224)
7) for anyone to have an open container of alcohol in a motor vehicle and for persons under 21
to drive a vehicle carrying alcohol. (VEHICLE CODE 23223; 23224)
Moreover, while the situation regarding liability is more complex, it is important to know that
under certain circumstances party hosts, sponsors, bartenders or others may he held legally liable
for the consequences of serving alcohol to underage drinkers or to obviously intoxicated persons.
ENFORCEMEN T OF ALCOHOL-RELATED LAWS: Primary responsibility for law enforcement,
including that related to alcohol, rests with law enforcement agencies, primarily thee Stanford
Police Department. Uniformed officers who patrol the campus and respond to calls are deputized
by the Sheriff of Santa Clara County and are fully empowered and authorized to stop vehicles.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY IS NOT A SANCTUARY FROM THE ENFORCEMENT OF
STATE AND LOCAL LAWS. STUDENTS AND OTHERS ON CAMPUS WHO VIOLATE THE
LAW MAY BE AND HAVE BEEN APPREHENDED AND PROSECUTED.
