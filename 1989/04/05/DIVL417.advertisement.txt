Summer in Africa
The World Teach Summer Program in Kenya is not
your average summer vacation. It's a rare opportunity to
experience development in action in an African setting
During your eight-week stay, you'll live in a village with a
Kenyan family. Visit development projects. Learn to converse
in Swahili. Even venture into Tanzania.
Students leave for Kenya around June 10. The application
deadline is April 25; after that, space will be available on a first
come, first-served basis. The fee for the World Teach summer
program is $4250, including airfare, room, and board.
