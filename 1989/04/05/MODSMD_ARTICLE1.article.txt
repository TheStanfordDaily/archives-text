# University report explores struggles of minority life
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Rather than focus on the over
tly racist incidents that have
grabbed campus attention in the
past year, the University report
on minority issues released today
spotlights underlying, subtle ra
cial tensions plaguing Stanford for
decades and seeks to chart their
end.
A year and a half in the making,
the final report of the University
Committee on Minority Issues is
a weighty 244 pages, with a 17-
page executive summary. With the
help of detailed surveys by SRI
International, the committee ex
haustively documented problems
with minority life at Stanford —
taking into account several view
points of University life, culled
from students, faculty and staff.
Most importantly, the report
makes specific recommendations
as to what the University should
do to solve these problems. It fi
nally answers a plea made two
years ago by many minority
groups to "do something."
Some of UCMI's key recommen
dations are:
• Instituting a new University
Distribution Requirement for the
study of U.S. minority groups;
• Hiring 30 new minority fac
ulty over the next 10 years;
• Targeting certain Asian mi
nority subgroups for admissions
and financial aid purposes;
• Funding more scholarships
and grants for minorities, which
would ease the burden of large
work-study allotments; and
• Doubling the number of mi
nority Ph.D. graduates within the
next eight years.
Born in October 1987, the 17-
member UCMI may have
guaranteed its own perpetuation
by also recommending a standing
committee to implement its rec
ommendations and oversee mul
ticultural affairs.
To begin carrying out the
report's recommendations — 117
in all — University President
Donald Kennedy and Provost
James Rosse last month appointed
a temporary task force to be co

chaired by Registrar Sally Ma
honey and Vice Provost Ray Bac
chetti.
The UCMI was created in re
sponse to pressure by the Rain
bow Agenda, a coalition of student
minority groups, to resolve prob
lems faced by minorities at Stan
ford. Originally expected last fall,
the UCMI report was delayed due
to the sheer bulk of the task and
problems collecting data. The
committee worked through three
deadlines to finally release the
report today. An insert summariz
ing the report is included in
today's Daily.
The report examines eight
mtyor areas of minority life: un

recruitment, undergraduate fi
nancial aid, undergraduate reten
tion and performance, graduate
students, student life and staff.
Undergraduate Curriculum
Too few undergraduate courses
deal with ethnic minorities, the
report found. To correct that
dearth, the report recommends:
• Establishing a curriculum de
velopment fund to support the
creation of at least six new ethnic
studies courses each year for the
next three years. Also, the fund
will help modify six existing
courses per year to include more
ethnic studies material.
• Establishing a 10th Distribu
tion Requirement, for the study
of U.S. ethnic and racial minori
ties.
• Reviewing certain subjects in
which minority students have gen
erally not done well, such as math
and chemistry.

Graduate Students
The most disturbing statistic
found by the UCMI is that far
fewer minority graduate students
are enrolled at Stanford compared
to 16 years ago. Stanford now
enrolls nearly 30 percent fewer
black and Chicano-Latino gradu
ate students than in 1973. Amer
ican Indians and Puerto Ricans
remain less than 1 percent of the
graduate student population.
There is also a severe shortage
of minority Ph.D. students.
The UCMI concluded that the
reason for the poor minor
ity graduate student percentage is
the lack of minority faculty.
Recommendations included:
• Hire more minority faculty to
attract and sustain minority grad
uate students.
• Admissions committees must
pay special attention to minority
folders, reviewing rejected appli
cants for possible reconsideration.
• The president, provost and
deans of the schools should estab
lish a minimum goal of doubling
"targeted" — black, Mexican-
American and American Indian —
minority Ph.D. students within
the next five years and doubling
the yearly total of targeted mi
nority Ph.D. graduates within the
next eight years. The president
should publicly commit the Uni
versity to these goals.
Faculty
Minority faculty increased only
slightly over the past two decades
and had a high turnover rate.
Black and Hispanic faculty per
ceived that University depart
ments were not interested enough
in affirmative action hiring, the
report found.
Also, according to the report,
more than half of the white fac
ulty tends not to socialize with
minority colleagues. UCMI sug
gested that the lack of mingling
was due to the small numbers of
minority faculty.
Also, the report found, minority
faculty frequently have less time
to devote to research because they
are busy supporting their ethnic
communities. In short, these ac

tivities take time away from re
search, which affects career ad
vancement.
A large percentage of minority
students believe racial stereotyp
ing has influenced their relations
with the faculty, the report found.
White and Asian faculty are more
likely to expect minority students
to have more difficulty than
whites academically, and all fac
ulty expect black and Hispanic
students to have more difficulty.
To bolster minority faculty and
combat racial stereotyping, UCMI
recommends:
• The president, provost and
