## Gorbachev makes proposal for peace 
### 
HAVANA (AP) - Soviet Pres
ident Mikhail Gorbachev proposed
yesterday that a zone of peace be
established in Latin America and
the Caribbean and renounced any
Soviet intention of establishing
naval, air or missile bases in the
region.
Addressing the Cuban National
Assembly, Gorbachev also empha
sized that Soviet-style reforms
were not a universal remedy for
other communist countries, in
cluding Cuba.
"We do not regard our ap
proaches and solutions as some
universal prescription for all," he
said in what appeared an attempt
to minimize the difference be
tween Cuba's orthodox commu
nism and Gorbachev's new prag
matism.
The Soviet leader also reaf
firmed that the Soviet Union will
continue supplying weaponry to
Nicaragua's leftist government as
long as the United States contin
ues to arm other Central Ameri
can countries.
The issue remains a major sore
point in relations between Wash
ington and Moscow.
There had been speculation that
Gorbachev, in a gesture of friend
ship toward Cuba, might an
nounce forgiveness of part or all
of Cuba's debt to the Soviet Un
ion.
But he barely mentioned the
subject, merely restating his po
sition that the industrialized na
tions of the world should try to
help ease the burden of debtor
nations in the developing world.
Cuban President Fidel Castro,
in a 50-minute introduction that
was only three minutes shorter

than his guest's address, lam
basted the United States in a
characteristic diatribe. He blamed
his longtime adversary for
regional conflicts throughout the
world and for "pulling the Third
World's leg" by proposing un
workable solutions to the critical
problem of Third World debt.
Waving his arms and jabbing
his fingers, the 62-year-old Castro
rejected suggestions of friction in
Soviet-Cuban relations. He said
he was in full agreement with Gor
bachev's contention that each
communist country must solve
the problems of developing
socialism in its own way.
Gorbachev, who had been ex
pected to outline Soviet policy
toward Latin America, essentially
reiterated his government's
longstanding view that the United
States holds the key to peace in
Central America and must halt its
intervention in order to encourage
settlement of regional strife.
"We have a real possiblity of
guaranteeing peace," he said, but
all sides must halt military sup
plies to the region.
"The Soviet Union does not
seek for itself political, strategic
or military advantage in the West
ern hemisphere," Gorbachev said.
"We consider that this hemi
sphere and all others must not
be an arena for East-West con
frontation."
In proposing establishment of a
"zone of peace," the Soviet pres
ident said his country "does not
have any intention of having in
Latin America naval, air or mis
sile bases or to place there nuclear
or other weapons of mass exter
mination."
