# Tanker spill cleanup drags on
## Captain of Valdez may surrender soon to face charges 
### 
VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) — Exxon
crews yesterday finished pumping
the remaining crude oil out of the
tanker Exxon Valdez in prepara
tion for refloating and removing
the source of the nation's worst
ever oil spill.
The fugitive captain of the Ex
xon Valdez sent signals he was
ready to surrender to face crimi
nal charges of operating the vessel
while drunk.
Meanwhile, Exxon said placing
an oil-catching boom around the
ship immediately after the
grounding could have touched off
a giant explosion of gases from
the oil, although that was not the
reason it took 11 hours to set the
first containment line.
"The worst thing we could have
done early on was try to boom

the vessel. We would have lost
the vessel," said Exxon Shipping
Co. President Frank larossi.
A boom wasn't placed around
the vessel for 11 hours because it
wasn't available in Valdez, Exxon
officials have said.
larossi also said Exxon has
changed its policy because of the
spill and now requires crews to
be aboard ship, where drinking is
prohibited, four hours before sail
ing. Authorities charged the cap
tain had been drinking before the
Valdez sailed.
Thick oil has floated over more
than 1,640 square miles and
soiled 800 miles of beach. Thou
sands of animals are known dead,
including 30 sea otters.
Early yesterday, Exxon said it
had finished transferring about

42 million gallons of crude to
three other ships. Another 42 mil
lion gallons of oily waste water
remained aboard the Valdez,
which spilled more than 10 million
gallons of crude into Prince
William Sound when it struck a
reef March 24.
The company said crews would
attempt to pump air into the hold
and refloat the vessel off a reef
at high tide this afternoon. If
freed, the still-leaking ship, which
has eight holes some 20 feet long
in its hull, will be towed to a
remote and already fouled cove
for repairs.
Exxon then planned to take the
ship to a port in the Far East, or
to a Portland, Ore., dry dock. Port
officials there said they weren't
sure if they'd allow that.
