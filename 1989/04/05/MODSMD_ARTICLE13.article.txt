# Witness questions North's credibility
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
former National Security Council
staffer testified yesterday that he
took much of what Oliver North
said with "with four grains of
salt" and recalled making a
Pinocchio-like nose-growing ges
ture when he read a letter to
Congress that North was drafting.
Vincent Cannistraro said he felt
that North, in his efforts to help
the Nicaraguan Contras, had
crossed "the line from objectivity
to advocacy."
Although he was called as a de
fense witness, Cannistraro's tes
timony was peppered with critical
references to North, who is on
trial on charges including with
holding information from
Congress in connection with the
Iran-Contra affair.
Cannistraro jousted with pros
ecutor John Keker who tried in
cross examination to cast doubt
on the witness' credibility, sug
gesting more than once that he
had lied.
Keker asked whether North,
formerly a Marine lieutenant
colonel attached to the staff of
the NSC, had been considered
trustworthy.
"I had considered Colonel
North a trustworthy person but
there were occasions when myself
and others had some questions
about the veracity about some of
the things he told us," Can
nistraro said.
Keker asked whether he
remembered testifying before a
grand jury that he took things
North said with four grains of
salt.
"Maybe three," said Can
nistraro.
Keker then read what the wit

nesa had told the grand jury:
"With Colonel North you never
could be certain if what he was
telling was true or fantasy or
deliberately meant to mislead. My
practice was to take everything
with four grains of salt."
To that reading, Cannistraro
responded: "It was the way I came
to feel about him in the summer
of 1986."
Cannistraro recalled a comment
by a CIA official, "that whatever
Ollie was doing he was bound to
get us all in a lot of trouble and
he wanted to stay far away from
him."
North lawyer Brendan Sullivan
drew from the witness that he
admired North for "his dedication
and his persistence" and would
want him "in a foxhole with me
when the first rounds were com
ing in."
Keker asked about a time when
North was drafting answers to in
quiries by two congressional com
mittees. One of the charges
against North is that he made
false statements in those letters,
which were signed by then-
National Security Adviser Robert
McFarlane.
"He showed you some of his
answers?" Keker asked.
"I asked him if they were ac
curate and they did not appear to
be so," said Cannistraro.
"Did you do anything?" said
Keker. Cannistraro balked, ap
pealing to the judge on whether
he had to answer. "I want to know
what you did," Keker continued.
"I suggested ..." Cannistraro
began, and the prosecutor put his
hand to his nose and stretched
his arm out, as if to show a long
nose.
