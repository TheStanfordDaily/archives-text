Daley wins Chicago mayor's race
CHICAGO (AP) — Richard Daley won election
yesterday to the mayor's office his father held
for 21 years, dashing chief rival Timothy Evans'
hope of extending the brief era of black leadership
at City Hall.
With 2,708 of 2,911 precincts reporting, or 93
percent, unofficial results gave Daley 570,282
votes, or 59 percent, to 365,261 votes for Evans,
or 37 percent. Republican Edward Vrdolyak had
35,147 votes, or 4 percent.
Daley benefited from a strong turnout in the
predominantly white Southwest and Northwest
Side wards. Turnout in Evans' black strongholds
on the South and West Sides, meanwhile, lagged
as many as 10 percentage points behind, according
to a city elections official who declined to be
identified.
Black turnout in recent elections has trailed
white turnout by 2 to 5 percentage points, and
Evans' campaign strategists pegged his chances

for an upset victory on preventing that gap from
widening.
The victory by Daley, who defeated Mayor
Eugene Sawyer in February's Democratic pri
mary, makes Chicago by far the biggest city in
the nation to replace a black mayor with a white.
Attorneys protest abortion stand
