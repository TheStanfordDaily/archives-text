IT IS 1 A.M. Even a slice of
Corner Pocket pizza sounds
good. But where can the
hungry and harried student turn?
Well, if Director of Housing and
Food Service Keith Guy has his
way, next year Stanford students
will finally be able to fill their
stomachs during the wee hours
of the morning.
Presently, students who are not
blessed with the good fortune of
eating in co-ops, self-ops or eating
clubs, must venture into the
realm of Palo Alto's all-night
diners or listen to the grumbles
of an unhappy stomach.
The eating clubs, both at
Toyon Hall and the Suites, are
among the most popular eating
options at the University, and
Food Service is trying to learn
from their example. Because the
eating clubs are smaller, they do
not have to cater to the need.' of
so many students, and thus can
be more flexible in their menus

and meal-tims.
One option the eating club
model offers is an "open kitchen,"
giving students access to snacks,
a kitchen and raw materials.
Considering the large number
of mouths Food Service feeds, an
open kitchen might not be a re
alistic option for big dorms. But
even putting out a late-night
snack could make for some hap
pier students.
An experimental all-night
snack bar opening at Roble Hall
next year is one aspect of Guy's
proposal to revamp Food Service.
Guy's idea is a fine one that will
certainly catch on at other dorms.
A decentralized Food Service
has the potential to save a sig
nificant amount of money in ad
ministrative costs incurred by a
more centralized system.
By taking a serious look at the
more popular eating options at
Stanford, Food Service has taken
a step in the right direction.
