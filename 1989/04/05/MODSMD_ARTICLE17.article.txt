HOW MUCH FREE speech
is enough at the univer
sity? How much is too
much?
After a rash of grossly offensive
actions over the past year, Stan
ford's Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council proposed a re
definition of the Fundamental
Standard to disallow speech of
fensive to groups and individuals
if such expression violates "ac
cepted community standards."
Apparently, the council's first
proposal went too far, threaten
ing not only racist speech but all
unorthodoxy. So the council has
gone back to the drawing board
to clarify and narrow its defini

tion of a violation.
Today at 12:15 p.m., at a Stan
ford Law School forum in room
290 of the Law Quad, four Stan
ford legal scholars will lend their
professional insight to this com
plex and emotionally charged
issue.
These professors know that
freedom of speech, more than any
other single personal liberty, is
what truly makes a free society
free.
They also know, though, that
freedom of speech cannot be ab
solute.
This panel, chaired by Law
School Dean Paul Brest, will help
concerned community members
make up their own minds.
