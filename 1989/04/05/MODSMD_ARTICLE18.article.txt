## TAs are essential to undergraduates: Support them 
### 
I AM WRITING in response to
comments attributed to Ewart
Thomas, dean of Humanities and
Sciences, in The Daily's March 7 arti
cle titled "TAs Say Section Sizes Are
Too Large."
Thomas is said to have been "im
pressed by one history TA who spent
more time than other teaching assis
tants grading papers because thorough
editing helped develop his students'
writing skills."
I do not question the motivation,
diligence or thoroughness of this gradu
ate student. However, I do resent the
implication of Thomas' comments that
such efforts are in any way exceptional
or unique.
Furthermore, I feel that such artifi

rial distinctions divert attention from
the real issue: the paucity of TA fund
ing and the overcrowding of discussion
sections.
Grading papers, exams, lab reports

and other written work is the most
time-consuming and, potentially, the
most valuable aspect of a TA's work.
As I'm certain most teaching assistants
will attest, it is not uncommon for a

graduate student to spend extended
hours just fulfilling his or her grading
responsibilities.
For many undergraduates, our com
ments on their work represent the
most detailed feedback of this sort that
they will receive during their Stanford
careers. In effect, it is our job to
ensure that all Stanford students leave
the Farm with college level writing
skills.
It is time for Thomas to stop looking
for the exceptions, to recognize the
high quality of work being done by
TAs throughout Stanford's campus and
to restore TA funding to the School of
Humanitites and Sciences.
