# Brother Jed is easy 'pray;' do not stoop to level of insults
## 
### 
I am writing this letter in regard to
the fundamentalist preachers seen in
White Plaza at the end of last quarter.
What might be surprising to many is
that this letter is not written to ma
lign the preachers, but to voice my,
and hopefully others', disapproval of
many of the spectators.
This is not to say that I agree with
these preachers or even that I find
what they are proclaiming justifiable,
but the barking affronts and insults
from the crowd are disappointing.
While passing by, I heard one stu
dent scream to one of the preachers
that her husband must have been
blind or queer to have married her.
I'm not saying that it is easy to
come up with quick, piercing responses

to some of the nonsensical and offen
sive issues these preachers sermonize.
But I hope that students who disagree
with what the preachers are saying,
either go to White Plaza to tell them
what they think in an educated fash
ion or simply walk past them denying
these preachers what they really want:
an audience.
