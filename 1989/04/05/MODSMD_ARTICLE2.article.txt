# Eighteen months of surveys and paperwork

The 244-page University Committee on Minority
Issues report released today is expected to have
far-reaching significance at Stanford and nation
wide, and represents more than a year and a half
of work, hundreds of interviews and three broken
deadlines.
The report was based on a random sample survey
of 1,316 Stanford undergraduates by SRI Interna
tional of Menlo Park, and interviews with 200 stu
dents by an outside research firm, Pacific Manage
ment Services. In addition, committee members sur
veyed University staff and faculty.
The report was commissioned by the University
in October 1987 in response to pressure by the
Rainbow Agenda, a coalition of minority student
groups, to address the problems they saw with
minority life on campus.
The committee was charged with exploring several
aspects of minority life at Stanford and to make
specific recommendations on how to correct the
problems.
The original deadline for completion of the report
was October of last year. But the committee said
that problems with data collection as well as the
sheer bulk of the task forced them to miss three
deadlines until today's release.
According to History Prof. Albert Camarillo, com
mittee chair, the report will have great significance
not only to the University community but also
nationwide. Several universities, including Cornell
University and UC-Berkeley, have asked for copies
of the report.
Copies of the complete report will be available to
students beginning at 1 p.m. today in each of the
undergraduate and graduate residence offices.
