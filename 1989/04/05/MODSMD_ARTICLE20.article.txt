# Why does students' money go to tear up a new crosswalk?
## 
### 
I would like to draw attention to
that quaint little street that runs be
tween the Post Office and the Law
School. I'm sure that you know the
one that I'm talking about. It's the
one that was all torn up for a good
two weeks last quarter.
I think it is wonderful that the Uni
versity finally got around to fixing
whatever it is that they were fixing.
No doubt it has been a long time com
ing. I'm sure that we all managed to
deal with whatever small inconvenience
the work caused.
But, did anyone notice that this very
same street had two fantastic, brand â€¢
new, super-duper sharp looking cros
swalks "painted" across it right before
the construction began? I put painted

in quotes because they aren't really
painted.
I invite you to stop by and see for
yourself. Well, if you're curious, these
crosswalks were partially torn up. I
wonder what those crosswalks cost? I
don't think that it is very cost effec
tive to build, or "paint" something and
then tear it up.
I feel really good knowing that this
is what my tuition goes for. I can only
hope that my 8 percent tuition increase
goes to repainting these crosswalks
next year.
