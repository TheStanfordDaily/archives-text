## Strive for a free sunset 
### 
A SEMI-DRUNK MAN named
Bryan who sat next to me on my
flight to Phoenix mentioned a place
in the Berkeley Hills called Grizzly Peak.
He always goes there to see the sun go
down. I can't tell you what it really looks
like from Grizzly Peak, because I haven't
been there. Bryan told me that I should
go there one day to see.
I never thought that I would have a
meaningful airplane conversation. I
mean, it's usually just take off, talk about
trivialities (most of the time just a pair
of intersecting monologues), land, and
then never see the person again.
But this man Bryan, in a sobering
moment, told me something that I'll prob
ably never forget. Even in his semi
drunken state, seconds after pouring his
gin and tonic over his friend Chris in
the seat in front of him, he could sincerely
express his firmest belief: "Always strive
for a free sunset."
After his nine-to-five job, he sometimes
drives up to Grizzly Peak to watch the
sunset. It must be wonderful; he's gone
there since his childhood. The only prob
lem is that as he sits there, worrisome
thoughts enter his mind after a while.
Thoughts about his bills, his finances,
his job, his children and of course other
things he didn't tell me about. These
things disturb the peace of mind and, in
essence, "wrinkle" the sun. As he
watches, he realizes that the sunset is
not free. His intruding worries are a price
for his eryoyment of the Grizzly Peak
sunset.
The thing about Bryan is that he
knows what he wants and he knows what

he cares about. He still strives for a free
sunset.
I know that the popularity of last sum
mer's big Bobby McFerrin single, "Don't
Worry, Be Happy," has driven some
people to sarcasm and disbelief.
I've seen a sticker of the typical "have
a nice day" yellow smiley face, except it
has a frown and the words, "Have a day."
I've seen T-shirts of radioactive,
smiling skulls under a mushroom cloud
from an atomic bomb with the saying
"Don't Worry, Be Happy."
I've seen magazine covers of a smiley
face with a big black X through it.
I've heard criticism of this new happi
ness, of its oblivious mindlessness. I've
sometimes caught myself feeling the
same way.
But there's a difference between "Don't
Worry, Be Happy" and "Always strive
for a free sunset." While Bryan's words
may see to aim towards the same goal
of some kind of undefined, abstract hap
piness, the path to the goal is completely
different, completely admirable and dif
ficult, but more realistic and less idealis
tic.
The key idea in Bryan's view of per
sonal happiness is the verb "to strive."
It is probably the most important or at
least the most relevant word in this life.
The argument against McFerrin is that
"Don't Worry, Be Happy" encourages the
easier denial of life and denial of striving.
That's why the song was/is so popular,
because it is so easy to enjoy, so easy to
choose.
William Faulkner said in his acceptance
speech for the Nobel Prize in Literature,

"I believe that man will not merely en
dure: He will prevail. He is immortal not
because he alone among creatures has
an inexhaustible voice but because he
has a soul, a spirit capable of . . ." I say
striving.
What was so memorable about Bryan
was his belief in striving, that firm
Faulknerian belief in man. I admire the
affirmation and not the denial of life.
We are in a university, a "church of
reason," where the idea of striving is
usually applied toward academics. But
the idea of striving applies to everything
else too. Take spring vacation for exam
ple. Seung, Alicia, Christine and I went
camping in Oregon. After two days in
Ashland, we drove up to Crater Lake,
where we found 10- to 15-foot snow drifts
and then rain throughout Oregon.
Instead of getting upset at our camping
prospects, we turned around and made
a difficult 20-hour, 900-mile drive down
to southern California, getting to Santa
Barbara at 5 a.m. and sleeping in a
parking lot. The rest of the vacation was
wonderful because we created our own
goal, and then we "strived" to achieve it.

in the Berkeley Hills called Grizzly Peak.
He always goes there to see the sun go
down. I can't tell you what it really looks
like from Grizzly Peak, because I haven't
been there. Bryan told me that I should
go there one day to see.
I never thought that I would have a
meaningful airplane conversation. I
mean, it's usually just take off, talk about
trivialities (most of the time just a pair
of intersecting monologues), land, and
then never see the person again.
But this man Bryan, in a sobering
moment, told me something that I'll prob
ably never forget. Even in his semi
drunken state, seconds after pouring his
gin and tonic over his friend Chris in
the seat in front of him, he could sincerely
express his firmest belief: "Always strive
for a free sunset."
After his nine-to-five job, he sometimes
drives up to Grizzly Peak to watch the
sunset. It must be wonderful; he's gone
there since his childhood. The only prob
lem is that as he sits there, worrisome
thoughts enter his mind after a while.
Thoughts about his bills, his finances,
his job, his children and of course other
things he didn't tell me about. These
things disturb the peace of mind and, in
essence, "wrinkle" the sun. As he
watches, he realizes that the sunset is
not free. His intruding worries are a price
for his eryoyment of the Grizzly Peak
sunset.
The thing about Bryan is that he
knows what he wants and he knows what

he cares about. He still strives for a free
sunset.
I know that the popularity of last sum
mer's big Bobby McFerrin single, "Don't
Worry, Be Happy," has driven some
people to sarcasm and disbelief.
I've seen a sticker of the typical "have
a nice day" yellow smiley face, except it
has a frown and the words, "Have a day."
I've seen T-shirts of radioactive,
smiling skulls under a mushroom cloud
from an atomic bomb with the saying
"Don't Worry, Be Happy."
I've seen magazine covers of a smiley
face with a big black X through it.
I've heard criticism of this new happi
ness, of its oblivious mindlessness. I've
sometimes caught myself feeling the
same way.
But there's a difference between "Don't
Worry, Be Happy" and "Always strive
for a free sunset." While Bryan's words
may see to aim towards the same goal
of some kind of undefined, abstract hap
piness, the path to the goal is completely
different, completely admirable and dif
ficult, but more realistic and less idealis
tic.
The key idea in Bryan's view of per
sonal happiness is the verb "to strive."
It is probably the most important or at
least the most relevant word in this life.
The argument against McFerrin is that
"Don't Worry, Be Happy" encourages the
easier denial of life and denial of striving.
That's why the song was/is so popular,
because it is so easy to enjoy, so easy to
choose.
William Faulkner said in his acceptance
speech for the Nobel Prize in Literature,

"I believe that man will not merely en
dure: He will prevail. He is immortal not
because he alone among creatures has
an inexhaustible voice but because he
has a soul, a spirit capable of . . ." I say
striving.
What was so memorable about Bryan
was his belief in striving, that firm
Faulknerian belief in man. I admire the
affirmation and not the denial of life.
We are in a university, a "church of
reason," where the idea of striving is
usually applied toward academics. But
the idea of striving applies to everything
else too. Take spring vacation for exam
ple. Seung, Alicia, Christine and I went
camping in Oregon. After two days in
Ashland, we drove up to Crater Lake,
where we found 10- to 15-foot snow drifts
and then rain throughout Oregon.
Instead of getting upset at our camping
prospects, we turned around and made
a difficult 20-hour, 900-mile drive down
to southern California, getting to Santa
Barbara at 5 a.m. and sleeping in a
parking lot. The rest of the vacation was
wonderful because we created our own
goal, and then we "strived" to achieve it.
