Q. Why dees my stomach
• grumble?
A„ Stomach grumbling,
• one of the many
sounds produced by the
body, is the result of diges
tive juices and air being
sloshed around by contrac
tions in the stomach, accord
ing to Biological Sciences
Prof. Craig Heller.
Food is moved along the
length of the digestive tract
by muscular movements
known as peristalsis. In the
stomach, the muscle con
tractions are not as orderly
and are known as "mixing
movements."
Ordinarily when there is
food in the stomach, the

muscles mix up the food and aid
in digestion. When the stomach
is empty, the muscles push air
and digestive juices around,
producing a grumble. The mus
cular contractions of an empty
stomach also produce the sensa
tion of hunger pangs.
Mixing movements are trig
gered by food or the anticipation
of a meal. Stomach grumbling
usually occurs during the regular
mealtime of an individual when
no food is available.
For example, many Stanford
students find their stomachs
grumbling during classes held

during their accustomed lunch
hour — and thus more eagerly
participate in discussion sections.
Stress can also cause stomach
grumbling since it triggers the
same reflexes as eating food.
There is nothing wrong with a
talkative stomach. It might actu
ally keep you company when you
are alone. But if you're in the
library, have a headache, or just
tired of the dull conversation, Hel
ler says eating will quiet the more
loquacious stomachs.
