# 30-year project might defy general relativity
## Stanford to test Einstein's weighty gravity theory 
### Melissa Hurley 
What would it take to prove
Einstein wrong?
In 1995, when Stanford project
Gravity Probe B launches a satel
lite to test two predictions by
Einstein's theory of general
relativity, it will have exhausted
$170 million and cap the 30-year
efforts of a talented team of sci
entists.
Just as Copernicus invented the
telescope to aid him in his
astronomical studies, so Gravity
Probe B has left behind a slew of
technological advances in its sci
entific quest.
It all began in 1960 when, as
the story goes, three renowned
scientists sunbathing at what was
then Encina pool got talking about
Einstein.
When Einstein died, he left a
legacy that defied fundamental
geometry. Space, he asserted, is
not flat, it curves as a result of
gravitating bodies moving within
it.
In this highly complex realm of
curved or "warped" space, parallel
lines intersect and triangles tend
to have more than 180 degrees.
Einstein's equations can be used
to calculate the amount of curva
ture produced by a given body of
matter.
He also left tests to prove his
theory, and some of these have
been performed successfully.
However, the results were so gen
eral they fit at least one other
theory competing with general
relativity. Until Gravity Probe B's
experiment, there has never been
a test with precision enough to
provide conclusive evidence for
general relativity.
How will the project achieve
this precision? The bottom line is
gyroscopes. In fact, the project

uses gyroscopes that are so well
designed, they are probably the
roundest objects in the universe.
Even the federally accepted stand
ard of roundness has been
redefined to take into account the
team's unprecedentedly smooth
fused quartz spheres made with
technology the team developed.
Gyroscopes are unusual instru
ments because, when undisturbed
by external forces, their spinning
axes maintain a fixed direction.
A change in this axial direction
is called precession.
A good example of an external
force causing precession on earth
is gravity. Putting the satellite in
orbit immediately eliminates
many of the gravitational forces
experienced on earth.
Two other effects which might
cause gyroscope precession in
space are predicted by general
relativity. The first effect, or
geodetic effect, is a direct result
of space curvature.
To visualize the geodetic effect,
slide a pen initially oriented par
allel to the ground down the side
of a globe, then along the equator
and back up to the North Pole.
The "gyroscope" pen will have
changed its direction.
The second effect, or frame
dragging effect, results from a
gravitational field generated by
rotating bodies of mass, like
planets. In this case, the rotating
body and gyroscope are like inter
locking gears, so that as the planet
turns clockwise, it drags the gyro
scope in the opposite direction.
Gravity Probe B, headed by
physicist Francis Everitt, plans to
measure both of these effects
within the next few years. Un
fortunately for the researchers,
both effects are very small.
In fact, the lesser of the two
involves an angle of 44 milliarc

second per year, where one
milliarc-second is less than the
width of a human hair as seen
from 10 miles away.
To detect such a change ac
curately, the team has had to com
bine engineering with physical
theory in order to create a system
free from the slightest disturb
ance. Every little disturbance
from friction, air resistance, and
energy transfer from cosmic rays
can interfere with the measure
ment of the precessions.
"The really difficult task has
been to design a complete experi
mental system in which all of the
state-of-the-art technologies can

work together," according to John
Turneaure, research professor in
physics and hardware manager
for the team.
Gravity Probe B has designed
a gyroscope meter with a readout
accuracy of one ten-millionth of a
degree, an electrical system that
will further shield the gyroscope
from the earth's magnetic field
and a liquid helium container
which will maintain the system
at nearly absolute zero for one
and-a-half years.
Describing the current status of
the project, Turneaure said,
"We've come very close and we
could live with our results, but

we think it would limit our ex
periment."
After being launched within the
next few years, the Gravity Probe
B satellite will spend one to two
years in orbit around the earth.
It will contain four gyroscopes,
each initially oriented with respect
to Rigel, a star chosen for its
brightness, and will send back in
formation to earth.
And when all the data is proc
essed — who knows? Could
Einstein be proven wrong?
Says Turneaure, "If the meas
urements should not be in detailed
agreement with Einstein's theory,
his theory is likely to be modified
rather than abandoned."

In 1995, when Stanford project
Gravity Probe B launches a satel
lite to test two predictions by
Einstein's theory of general
relativity, it will have exhausted
$170 million and cap the 30-year
efforts of a talented team of sci
entists.
Just as Copernicus invented the
telescope to aid him in his
astronomical studies, so Gravity
Probe B has left behind a slew of
technological advances in its sci
entific quest.
It all began in 1960 when, as
the story goes, three renowned
scientists sunbathing at what was
then Encina pool got talking about
Einstein.
When Einstein died, he left a
legacy that defied fundamental
geometry. Space, he asserted, is
not flat, it curves as a result of
gravitating bodies moving within
it.
In this highly complex realm of
curved or "warped" space, parallel
lines intersect and triangles tend
to have more than 180 degrees.
Einstein's equations can be used
to calculate the amount of curva
ture produced by a given body of
matter.
He also left tests to prove his
theory, and some of these have
been performed successfully.
However, the results were so gen
eral they fit at least one other
theory competing with general
relativity. Until Gravity Probe B's
experiment, there has never been
a test with precision enough to
provide conclusive evidence for
general relativity.
How will the project achieve
this precision? The bottom line is
gyroscopes. In fact, the project

uses gyroscopes that are so well
designed, they are probably the
roundest objects in the universe.
Even the federally accepted stand
ard of roundness has been
redefined to take into account the
team's unprecedentedly smooth
fused quartz spheres made with
technology the team developed.
Gyroscopes are unusual instru
ments because, when undisturbed
by external forces, their spinning
axes maintain a fixed direction.
A change in this axial direction
is called precession.
A good example of an external
force causing precession on earth
is gravity. Putting the satellite in
orbit immediately eliminates
many of the gravitational forces
experienced on earth.
Two other effects which might
cause gyroscope precession in
space are predicted by general
relativity. The first effect, or
geodetic effect, is a direct result
of space curvature.
To visualize the geodetic effect,
slide a pen initially oriented par
allel to the ground down the side
of a globe, then along the equator
and back up to the North Pole.
The "gyroscope" pen will have
changed its direction.
The second effect, or frame
dragging effect, results from a
gravitational field generated by
rotating bodies of mass, like
planets. In this case, the rotating
body and gyroscope are like inter
locking gears, so that as the planet
turns clockwise, it drags the gyro
scope in the opposite direction.
Gravity Probe B, headed by
physicist Francis Everitt, plans to
measure both of these effects
within the next few years. Un
fortunately for the researchers,
both effects are very small.
In fact, the lesser of the two
involves an angle of 44 milliarc

second per year, where one
milliarc-second is less than the
width of a human hair as seen
from 10 miles away.
To detect such a change ac
curately, the team has had to com
bine engineering with physical
theory in order to create a system
free from the slightest disturb
ance. Every little disturbance
from friction, air resistance, and
energy transfer from cosmic rays
can interfere with the measure
ment of the precessions.
"The really difficult task has
been to design a complete experi
mental system in which all of the
state-of-the-art technologies can

work together," according to John
Turneaure, research professor in
physics and hardware manager
for the team.
Gravity Probe B has designed
a gyroscope meter with a readout
accuracy of one ten-millionth of a
degree, an electrical system that
will further shield the gyroscope
from the earth's magnetic field
and a liquid helium container
which will maintain the system
at nearly absolute zero for one
and-a-half years.
Describing the current status of
the project, Turneaure said,
"We've come very close and we
could live with our results, but

we think it would limit our ex
periment."
After being launched within the
next few years, the Gravity Probe
B satellite will spend one to two
years in orbit around the earth.
It will contain four gyroscopes,
each initially oriented with respect
to Rigel, a star chosen for its
brightness, and will send back in
formation to earth.
And when all the data is proc
essed — who knows? Could
Einstein be proven wrong?
Says Turneaure, "If the meas
urements should not be in detailed
agreement with Einstein's theory,
his theory is likely to be modified
rather than abandoned."

Stanford scientists have designed an experiment using gyroscopes to test Einstein's theory of
general relativity In ways never before measured. Besides other technologies they have pushed
