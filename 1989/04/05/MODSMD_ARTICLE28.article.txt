# Stanford neurobiologist wins $500,000 award as the best young researcher in the country

A Stanford neurobiologist last week won
a prestigious award from the National Sci
ence Foundation given to one outstanding
young scientist each year.
Biological Sciences Associate Prof. Rich
ard Scheller, 35, won the Alan T. Waterman
Award given by the National Science Foun
dation which includes up to $500,000 in
research funding.
"This is easily the most prestigious
award for a young scientist," Biological
Sciences Prof. Robert Simoni said. Only
one award was given out to the more than
100 applicants from all over the nation and
from all different fields of research.
He has moved with great intellectual ease
and extraordinary technical capability to
solve basic questions about the molecular
basis of behavior," NSF Director Erich
Bloch said about Scheller in announcing
the award. "The scientific community can
look forward to decades of groundbreaking
intellectual endeavors from this exception
ally creative and highly productive scien
tist."
In addition to his many scientific ac
complishments in his short career, Scheller
has advanced knowledge of how the reg
ulated expression of genetic material in
single cells affects cellular physiology and

simple behavior.
"Our research looks at the ways in which
nervous cells communicate using chemical
transmitters," Scheller said. In particular,
Scheller is studying Aplysia, a kind of sea
snail, and certain fish that have relatively
simple nervous systems.
In his postdoctoral work at Columbia
University, Scheller and colleague Richard
Axel found that Aplysia egg-laying behavior
could be attributed to neuropeptides coded
by specific genes in the Aplysia DNA.
Neuropeptides transmit information from
nerve cell to nerve cell.
Simoni said that Scheller has moved
adeptly through an enormous number of
disciplines to help create a new field in
neurophysiology combining neurobiology
and molecular genetics.
"A lot of the most exciting work we're
doing is quite speculative," Scheller said.
He said the $500,000 award will allow him
to explore these potentially "exciting" areas
with more freedom from funding problems
that often hamper speculative research in
science.
