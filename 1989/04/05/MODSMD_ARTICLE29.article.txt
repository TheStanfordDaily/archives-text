## 22-0... ... and the unflappable batsmen continue their steady return to last season's championship form 
### Bruce Sarkisian Senior staff writer 
It was one of those days.
One of those days when every
thing went right for the Stanford
baseball team: the hitting was un
stoppable, the pitching was unhit
table and the defense was unflap
pable in a 22-0 win over Pacific
yesterday.

Baseball
Cardinal 22, Tigers 0

Yesterday's game was one that
every baseball player dreams of
— or at least every Cardinal
player. Just about every man on
the Stanford roster got a chance
to bat, and almost everyone got
a good cut against less-than
stellar Tiger pitching.
Stanford's 24-hit barrage was
by far its best of the season. All
but one of the 18 Cardinal batters
that came to the plate reached
base as Cardinal Coach Mark Mar
quess cleared the bench.
"We're obviously swinging the
bats better. Everybody seems to
get hot at the same time," Mar
quess said, adding "We didn't do
many things wrong."
The Stanford Hit Parade
started in the bottom of the third
when the Cardinal batted around
and scored seven runs. Roger Bur
nett started the carnage with a
solo home run over the left-field
wall. Jack Hollis, continuing his
hot streak, hit a two-run double.
And Troy Tallman climaxed the
scoring with his first Stanford

homer, a three-run shot.
Seven was the magic number
for the Cardinal in the fourth in
ning as well. Tim Griffin started
things off with a double and
scored the inning's first run on
David Hobrook's single. Appropri
ately, the stanza ended at the plate
when Paul Carey tried to score
the eighth run on a Jack Hollis
single but was thrown out.
One of the game's many other
scoring highlights was Mike Eic
her's fifth-inning grand slam, the
first of his career. Amazingly, Eic
her came in cold off the bench in
the top of the inning after losing
his starting job last weekend and
proceeded to dial long distance.

All but one of the
18 Cardinal batters
that came to the
plate reached
base.

Did anything go right for the
Tigers yesterday? In a word, no.
Pacific got a runner as far as
third base only twice in the whole
game.
Largely responsible for the Car
dinal's pitching mastery was
Brian Keyser, who started the
season as the team's third starter
behind Mike Mussina and Stan
Spencer but struggled early on.
Lately, however, the senior has
returned to form and pitched five
solid innings yesterday, giving up
only one hit.

Steve Worrell has also returned
to the pitching ranks. He held the
Tigers to four hits in three in
nings, striking out three. Worrell
showed a good curve and fastball,
but bounced more than one chan
geup, a pitch with which he has
been experimenting.
Marquess used his 32nd differ
ent lineup in 35 games yesterday,
with Burnett starting at shortstop
and Paulsen getting the call in
left field for the first time in his

career. "It's fun out there," Paul
sen said after the game. "It's a
lot more relaxing (than short)."
Paulsen showed great instincts
at his new position in the first
when he made a great shoestring
catch of Dan Danczek's sinking
line drive.
With the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division season at the
halfway mark, Stanford seems to
be a different team than the one
that started the season 0-3 and

struggled ever since. In its last
five games, the Cardinal has out
scored its opponents 42-23 and
won four of those five.
"We got a big lift by winning
the USC series," Marquess said.
He said he hopes that the team
can be more consistent instead of
going from a hitting drought to
a hitting monsoon. "You hope
you're a little more consistent,"
he stressed. "It takes the pressure
off the hitters and the pitchers."
