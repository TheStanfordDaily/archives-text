# Creek water testing reveals no toxics
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
Fears that storm sewer water on campus
was laced with lead and other toxic metals
evaporated yesterday when University Health
and Safety officials revealed that a prelimi
nary test was flawed.
The water, from a creek running along Serra
Street between Campus Drive and El Camino
Real, turned red last Wednesday after someone
dumped dye into the creek.
Between Wednesday and Friday last week
the creek water was pumped into five 5,000-
gallon tank trucks and nine samples were
taken to two independent labs for testing.

The first results, released late Friday, in
dicated no hazardous material in the water
â€” with one exception. Sequoia Analytical, a
Redwood City lab, returned data on one
sample that left Health and Safety officials
"just scratching our heads," according to
Chemical Safety Manager Peter Burnes.
Acting Health and Safety Director Ralph
Buchanan said over the weekend that, accord
ing to the results, the sample contained high
concentrations of heavy metals, including lead.
Burnes said last night that the results were
so far off that they indicated concentrations
that couldn't be present in water samples.
All the samples were re-tested, and results
released Monday showed only insignificant

concentrations of calcium, magnesium and
rhodamine, which caused the red color. One
sample also showed traces of chromium and
will be tested a third time to insure that the
concentration is not hazardous.
The water is now being pumped into the
storm sewer system and will be treated at a
sewage plant on the outskirts of Palo Alto
before being released into the Bay. Burnes
said the cleanup cost should not exceed the
original estimate of $30,000 to $40,000.
Burnes and Buchanan said they didn't know
why the original data on the one sample was
flawed, although the testers could have
scraped up lead from the creekbed while
taking the sample.
