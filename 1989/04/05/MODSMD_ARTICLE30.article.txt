# Stanford bats regain balance
## 
### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
Remember when you could visit
Sunken Diamond on a given week
end and see the Cardinal baseball
team pummel its opponent?
Well, those days of the not-too
distant past may indeed be in the
not-too-distant future.
The 1989 drought has finally
ended. Stanford is again scoring
runs. In bunches. And not a mo
ment too soon, as the Cardinal is
now into the meat of its Six-Pac
schedule.
Why has Stanford begun to hit
with a hint of the authority that
brought two national champion
ships?
"I don't really know. We all just
started coming around at the
same time. It was a team thing.
David Holbrook and Frank Carey
have been consistent. Now the rest
of us are hitting," first baseman
Brian Johnson said.
Okay, so that answer's not very
helpful. Johnson would admit
that. Maybe an easier question to
answer is what was wrong before.
"It could be anxiousness. People
argue that hitting is the single
hardest thing to do in sports. I
would agree with that. There are
so many things that could con
tribute to hitting well and to your
downfall," Johnson said.
Translate "anxiousness" to
mean the team was pressing. It's
an overused sports axiom, but it
certainly applies to the Cardinal
Almost every inning an over
aggressive Stanford batter could
be seen lunging hopelessly off
balance at a breaking ball. The
players were hitting off their front
foot, swinging at bad pitches, gen
erally doing everything a slump
entails.
Not so now.
"Now we're driving the ball. It's
not 'I gotta touch it' anymore.
It's 'Am I going to get a good
pitch to hit?'" outfielder Jack Hol
lis said.
"When you're hitting well, it's
all right there. You pick up your
foot and put it back down. You're
on-balance, not out front,"
Johnson added.
