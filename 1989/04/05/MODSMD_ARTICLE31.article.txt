# The 						Boys of Summer: The Mets will come out on top
## 
### 
My recollections of the first base
ball game I attended are sketchy
at best.
About all I remember is that it was
an afternoon game on a weekday with
an odd starting time — 4:15, I believe.
The Mets were playing the Braves at
Shea Stadium.
In all honesty, I'm not sure if the Mets
won or lost. Probably the latter; they did
a lot of that when I was young.
Now, the New Yorkers are one of the
best teams in the game. Have been since
'85. The 1986 World Champions are once
again a solid favorite to win the National
League East and quite possibly the Series
too.
But wait, you say. The Mets are Team
Turmoil. Darryl Strawberry's punching
Keith Hernandez. Center fielder Lenny
Dykstra wants more playing time. Center
fielder Mookie Wilson wants more playing
time. Center fielder Mickey Mantle wants
more playing time. (Oops. He played for

the other New York club. More on them
later.)
Besides, the Mets are loaded with ques
tion marks. Hernandez and Gary Carter
are old. Howard Johnson's shoulder is
ailing. Kevin Elster can't hit. Gregg Jef
feries can't hit. Bobby Ojeda may not be
the same after nearly losing his finger.
Well .. . Even if all the above is true
(which is doubtful) the Mets will still win
the division by 20 games. Why? I'll give
you five reasons:
Dwight Gooden. Ron Darling. Sid Fer

nandez. David Cone. And Ojeda.
Enough said? Perhaps, but just in case
here's two more: Rick Aguilera and David
West (the most sought-after pitching
prospect in all of baseball).
If last year's Dodgers' victory didn't
prove to you, once and for all, that good
pitching gets out good hitting, I have an
analyst-friend who will most happily ex
amine your head.
The National League West promises to
be quite a bit more interesting. The cham
pion Dodgers are attempting to violate
that canon of baseball in the "Win-it-all
do-commercials-go-to-Disneyland-wri te
a-book Era": the no repeat rule.
Can they succeed? Can Hershiser con
tinue his incredible roll? Will Gibson stay
on the field and out of the trainer's room?
Can Fernando come back? Is Ramon Mar
tinez ready for prime time?
It's seems likely that several of those
questions will wind up with "no"
answers. The Dodgers need a "yes" or
two more than they're going to get.

For the postseason, It'll be
the A's over the Jays and
the Reds over the Mets
(two five-game series). In
the Fall Classic, Strawber
ry's three-run blast off
Dennis Eckersley in the
seventh game will be the
decider.

Emerging from this pack of solid, yet
unspectacular teams will be the Cincin
nati Reds. Regardless of whether Pete
Rose gets suspended.
If he doesn't, Rose will finally get Eric
Davis, Kal Daniels, Barry Larkin, Paul
O'Neill, Chris Sabo, Danny Jackson, Jose
Ryo, Tom Browning, Todd Benzinger,

John Franco and Co. to produce at the
same time. That accomplished, the Reds
will win the West.
If he does, Tony Perez will step in
Steve Fisher-like and finally get Davis,
Daniels, Larkin, O'Neill ... (you get the
idea ) to produce at the same" time. That
accomplished, the Reds will wfti the West.
Onto the junior circuit, the home of
the D.H., the junkball pitcher, the hitters
park. In the American League West, it
seems highly unlikely anyone will short
circuit the high-powered Athletics.
Still carrying a "We-should-have-won"
chip on their shoulder from last year's
playoff debacle, the A's could be chal
lenged by Minnesota given one incredibly
fortuitous event in the Twin Cities: the
cloning of Frank Viola.
Twice.
See, the problem for the Twins isn't
matching Oakland's modern-day Mur-


MARK ROGOWSKY
the season's last week.
They've started slow (April in
Canada means winter isn't over.)
They've ended slow (remember
that collapse two years ago).
But, at it stands now, they're
the club best equipped — possess

ing just enough healthy
league bats, arms and gloves —
to win it all in this division.
The aforementioned Yankees
will complete their first decade
since the 1910s without a Series
ring around their collective finger.
Roberto Kelly is patrolling the
grounds where Mantle and
DiMaggio once roamed.
Don Mattingly is now being fol

lowed by Ken Phelps (?!?) instead
of Dave Winfield. Alvaro Espinoza
(?!?!?) is the everyday shortstop.
Looks like Dallas Green will be
gone by Mother's Day.
As for the postseason, it'll be
the A's over the Jays and the
Reds over the Mets (two five-game
series). In the Fall Classic, Straw
berry's three-run blast off Dennis
Eckersley in the seventh game will
be the decider.
