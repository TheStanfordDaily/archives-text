The Stanford men's tennis team
has been cruising along for the
last month, winning six matches
in a row. The time of smooth
sailing may be over, however.

Men's Tennis
Cardinal 7, 49ers 2

The Cardinal romped over
20th-ranked Long Beach State
yesterday in the team's final
tuneup for this weekend's road
trip. Stanford, now 9-2 and
ranked seventh in the country,
will take on No. 1 UCLA Friday
and No. 11 USC Saturday before
returning to the Bay Area to face
No. 2 California at Berkeley next
Tuesday.
Even with a less-than-100-

percent Jeff Tarango, who is
recovering from a hurt wrist, the
Cardinal had its way with the
49ers yesterday, dropping only
five sets en route to the win. Two
of those dropped sets had
Tarango's name on them. The
junior ran into a brick wall in the
form of Pat Crow, who tooled
Tarango 6-2, 6-2 at No. 2 singles.
Crow, who also has a win over
California's Woody Hunt to his
credit this year, put the pressure
on early and often, never letting
Tarango get into the flow of the
game.
"He pretty much took me out
of my game," Tarango said. "He's
a big, strong guy, and I didn't feel
like I could attack at all."
Stanford Coach Dick Gould
feels Tarango's wrist may have
played a part in the loss as well.
"(Crow) is a good player," Gould
said, "but you have to remember
that Jeffs not at full strength. I

would expect a closer match if
Tar an go was at 100 percent."
Crow is ranked 32nd in the
latest poll, Tarango eighth. "He's
the best No. 32 I've ever seen,"
Gould said.
Tarango saw no cause for alarm
in the loss. "It's good to be beaten
up on now and then," he said. "It
makes you step back and look at
your game, to see what you can
improve."
Minutes after the Crow-
Tarango match ended, Barry Ric
hards wrapped up his match with
Scott Potthast. Richards, playing
at No. 5 for the first time this
season, responded to the move up
with a 6-4, 6-4 win. Curtis Dunn,
who had been playing the fifth
spot, took the move down rather
well, schooling Doug Failla 6-3,
6-3.
Glenn Solomon's 6-3, 6-2 win
over Chris Ganz at No. 4 might
have looked easy, but only after
the sophomore got a tip from Asst.
Coach John Whitlinger. "I was
down 3-1 in the first, and (Ganz)
was playing really well," Solomon
said. "We had a lot of long points,
and he was winning most of them.
After I held serve for 2-3, Whit
told me to stand a little farther
back returning serve.
"I had been playing up most of
the time, trying to get a quick
return, but he'd been serving too
well. After I started hanging back,
I began mixing it up well, coming
to the net when I could, and I
got back in the match."
Jeff Cathrall gave the Cardinal
a 4-1 lead with his 6-4, 6-4 win
at No. 2 against Willie Moravec.
Cathrall's season record stands at
14-2, 10-1 in dual matches.
It looked like Alex O'Brien
would wrap up the match for
Stanford after he went up 6-2, 5-2
against Steve Joyner, but then the
roof fell in. Joyner stormed back
to take the set 7-5 and went up
5-3 in the third.
"I think my brain went out into
left field," O'Brien said. "I'm not
concentrating well. I wasn't into
the match at all."
"(O'Brien) has a tendency to let
matches get away from him,"
Gould agreed.. "He let (Joyner)
get back into the match."
Even with his mind on a tem
porary vacation, O'Brien didn't
roll over and die. After holding
serve for 4-5, the freshman broke
serve on the strength of three mis
hits from Joyner and a beautiful
passing shot in the right corner
to pull even. On a roll, O'Brien
then served a game at love for a
6-5 lead.
Joyner went up 3-1 in the next
game, but two errors knotted the
score. Unfortunately for O'Brien,

Joyner then fired a serve which
the freshman hit off the handle
of his racket. The ball joined
O'Brien's brain somewhere in left
field, and the match went into a
tiebreaker.
The tiebreaker, which Joyner
won 8-6, was not exactly tennis
at its finest. O'Brien's and
Joyner's shots either found net
or headed out of bounds more
often than not.
O'Brien wasn't thrilled with
himself afterward. "I had been
getting away with sloppy play,"
he said, "and it caught up to me."
A 4-2 lead after singles proved

to be more than sufficient, how
ever, as Cathrall and Dan Turbow
blew Joyner and Potthast off the
court in 45 minutes to seal the
win. After the duo's 6-2, 6-0 slam
fest, Gould praised both players.
"Jeffs low volley was as good as
I've ever seen it," Gould said.
"Turbow really played good dou
bles. They both played a good
match."
Richards and Eric Peus downed
Ganz and Failla 6-4, 6-2, leaving
only the No. 1 doubles to be com
pleted. Tarango and O'Brien,
playing together for the third
time, spotted Crow and Moravec

a 5-1 lead in the first set before
waking up to take six straight
games and the set. Crow and
Moravec went up 5-1 again in the
second ("I see a pattern here!" a
frustrated Tarango said during a
changeover) en route to a 6-2 win,
but O'Brien and Tarango broke
early in the third and took the
match 7-5, 2-6, 6-3.
"I was really discouraged (at
the start)," Tarango said. "We had
both lost at singles, and we were
feeling sorry for ourselves. Then
we started encouraging each
other, instead of moaning, and we
started to come around."
