The Stanford men's tennis team
has been cruising along for the
last month, winning six matches
in a row. The time of smooth
sailing may be over, however.

Men's Tennis
Cardinal 7, 49ers 2

The Cardinal romped over
20th-ranked Long Beach State
yesterday in the team's final
tuneup for this weekend's road
trip. Stanford, now 9-2 and
ranked seventh in the country,
will take on No. 1 UCLA Friday
and No. 11 USC Saturday before
returning to the Bay Area to face
No. 2 California at Berkeley next
Tuesday.
Even with a less-than-100-

percent Jeff Tarango, who is
recovering from a hurt wrist, the
Cardinal had its way with the
49ers yesterday, dropping only
five sets en route to the win. Two
of those dropped sets had
Tarango's name on them. The
junior ran into a brick wall in the
form of Pat Crow, who tooled
Tarango 6-2, 6-2 at No. 2 singles.
Crow, who also has a win over
California's Woody Hunt to his
credit this year, put the pressure
on early and often, never letting
Tarango get into the flow of the
game.
"He pretty much took me out
of my game," Tarango said. "He's
a big, strong guy, and I didn't feel
like I could attack at all."
Stanford Coach Dick Gould
feels Tarango's wrist may have
played a part in the loss as well.
"(Crow) is a good player," Gould
said, "but you have to remember
that Jeffs not at full strength. I

would expect a closer match if
Tar an go was at 100 percent."
Crow is ranked 32nd in the
latest poll, Tarango eighth. "He's
the best No. 32 I've ever seen,"
Gould said.
Tarango saw no cause for alarm
in the loss. "It's good to be beaten
up on now and then," he said. "It
makes you step back and look at
your game, to see what you can
improve."
Minutes after the Crow-
Tarango match ended, Barry Ric
hards wrapped up his match with
Scott Potthast. Richards, playing
at No. 5 for the first time this
season, responded to the move up
with a 6-4, 6-4 win. Curtis Dunn,
who had been playing the fifth
spot, took the move down rather
well, schooling Doug Failla 6-3,
6-3.
