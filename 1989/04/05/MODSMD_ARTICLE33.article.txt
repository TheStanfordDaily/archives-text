# Men's volleyball to face No. 4-ranked USC

"We may have taken some of
our opponents too lightly," junior
middle blocker Craig Forsyth said.
"We had finals to deal with,"
outside hitter John Alstrom
guessed.
"Maybe it was too much condi
tioning over the break," Asst.
Coach Ruben Nieves hypothe
sized.
The fact of the matter is that
nobody knows exactly what is at
the root of the Stanford men's
volleyball team's recent slump.
Whatever that mystical glitch may
be, however, the time has come
for the squad to eliminate it.
The defending national cham
pion and fourth-ranked Trojans
of USC arrive at Maples tonight,

eager to avenge their early-season
loss at the hands of the Cardinal.
USC will be as close to 100 percent
as it has been all season; outside
hitter Jen-Kai Liu is rumored to
have returned to the Trojan camp
and middle blocker Tom Duke is,
as the USC coaches phrased it, at
"85 to 90 percent."
Duke is the reigning NCAA
Player of the Year. He has been
plagued by injury this season and
sat out the first match versus
Stanford. Jen-Kai, having com
bated tendinitis in his knees for
the entire season, may or may not
play; the Stanford coaching staff
is ready for him if he docs take
the floor.
With those two guns back in
the Trojan arsenal, USC will be
tough indeed. USC also has in its
ranks sophomore middle blocker

Bryan Ivie, last year's NCAA
Freshman of the Year, Scott
McKeough, a hard-swinging out
side hitter, and Lawrence Horn,
who is among the national leaders
in hitting percentage (quite a feat
for an outside hitter).
As anybody can see, the Trojans
are stacked with talent. If Stan
ford is unable to find its pre
spring break form, the match
could get out of hand in a hurry.
