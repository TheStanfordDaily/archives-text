## Cyclists take second at Cal criterium

"The two strongest teams in
the conference, it looks like
right now, are Cal and Stan
ford," Stanford cycling captain
Vit Henisz said. After the last
two weekends of racing, the un
official rankings for the West

UC-San Diego for first place
and Stanford in third.
Last weekend the cyclists
raced on the home turf of their
rivals, California. Predictably

enough, the Bears had a large
turnout for their home races.
Unfortunately, due to spring
break, Stanford was not able
to muster a comparable num
ber of riders. As a result Stan
ford placed second overall to
California in both the road race
and the criterium.
The road race featured "a
hilly, tough course," Henisz
said. The race was also held in
drizzly, cold weather.
The Cardinal did have
several outstanding perform
ances, however. In the road
race events, the women's B,

men's A and men's D fields all
featured memorable Stanford
showings. In the criterium the
next day the men's A, men's B
and women's Braces also went
well for the Cardinal.
Many cyclists performed well
despite the weather. Stanford
cyclist Laura Wilson pulled off
a victory in the women's B race
in only her third collegiate race.
In the men's A race, Cardinal
rider Art Walker broke away
from the pack in a group of
