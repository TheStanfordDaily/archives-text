## Cyclists take second at Cal criterium 
### Libby Feil Staff writer 
"The two strongest teams in
the conference, it looks like
right now, are Cal and Stan
ford," Stanford cycling captain
Vit Henisz said. After the last
two weekends of racing, the un
official rankings for the West
ern Collegiate Cycling Confer
ence have California tied with
UC-San Diego for first place
and Stanford in third.
Last weekend the cyclists
raced on the home turf of their
rivals, California. Predictably

enough, the Bears had a large
turnout for their home races.
Unfortunately, due to spring
break, Stanford was not able
to muster a comparable num
ber of riders. As a result Stan
ford placed second overall to
California in both the road race
and the criterium.
The road race featured "a
hilly, tough course," Henisz
said. The race was also held in
drizzly, cold weather.
The Cardinal did have
several outstanding perform
ances, however. In the road
race events, the women's B,

men's A and men's D fields all
featured memorable Stanford
showings. In the criterium the
next day the men's A, men's B
and women's Braces also went
well for the Cardinal.
Many cyclists performed well
despite the weather. Stanford
cyclist Laura Wilson pulled off
a victory in the women's B race
in only her third collegiate race.
In the men's A race, Cardinal
rider Art Walker broke away
from the pack in a group of

California.
three riders, which then chased
down a few riders who had broken
away earlier. Walker ended up
with second place, while fellow
rider Tom Moyer came in 10th
overall.
"We had some bad luck in the
D's the whole weekend," Moyer
said. "In the road race a Stanford
D rider crashed."
However, fellow Cardinal cyclist
James Drew gutted through the
tough conditions to take fourth
place.
The criterium on Sunday fea
tured a short but steep hill,
several sharp turns and a few
nasty potholes. Luckily, these in
hospitable features did not result
in "that many big crashes," ac
cording to Henisz.

In the men's A criterium, "Art
(Walker) was the story," Moyer
said. Although he did not place,
"he was in all the breaks."
Because Walker covered all the
breakaway attempts, his Stanford
teammates were able to relax and
save up their energy for the final
sprint. Moyer, Coulter Richardson
and Jason Tavakolian placed fifth,
sixth and 10th respectively in the
final sprint.
The men's B race also featured
an amazing performance by a Car
dinal cyclist. Ken Zimmerman
placed in all the primes and then
went on to win first place overall.
After staying with the pack for
most of the race, "you could see
him getting antsier and antsier,"
Moyer said. Zimmerman broke
away from the pack on the last
lap and powered his way to a solo
victory.
The Cardinal women's B team

also turned in solid efforts. Stan
ford cyclist Becky Wigglesworth
and teammate Wilson helped each
other to fourth and fifth place
showings, respectively.
Stanford ruggers
qualify for regionals
Occasionally, miracles do hap
pen, dreams do come true and
long shots actually win. Just ask
the men of the Stanford rugby
team.
Over spring break the Stanford
players found out that rival UC-
Davis had fortuitously lost its
matches against both California
and Chico State. Because of this
unexpected turn of events, the
Cardinal found itself back in the
running for playoffs.
The only remaining obstacle be
tween Stanford and the regional
tournament was Humboldt State.

Last weekend the Cardinal over
came this obstacle to secure itself
a tournament berth.
At first it looked as though
Stanford might not be able to
defeat its last remaining pre
tournament rival. Humboldt
seized the initiative at the begin
ning of the game and scored six
points to give itself a lead. How
ever, Cardinal player Matt Stone
scored a try to tie it up. At
halftime, the score was 6-6.
At that point, said club presi
dent Marty Hartigan, "Everyone
realized . . . that we were this
close to playoffs, that we had come
this far." The Stanford ruggers
began to play more aggressively
and "really dominated in the sec
ond half. We outmuscled them."
Cardinal John Fitzpatrick gave
the team six more points to put
it ahead, 12-6. The score remained
the same for the remainder of the
game.
