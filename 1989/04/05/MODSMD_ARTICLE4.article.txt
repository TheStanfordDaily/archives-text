# Lomita Mall construction hums to a close
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
Students will soon be free to
traverse Lomita Mall for the first
time since shortly after June of
last year as the largest utilities
construction project ever under
taken on campus nears comple
tion.
John Kennedy, a University fa
cilities project manager, said that
beginning today, "Lots of fences
should come down," signifying the
end of a project which was origi
nally scheduled for completion
five months ago.

Kennedy said that within two
to three weeks the noisy machin
ery and inconvenient blockades
will be gone from the mall, the
area between the Physics Tank
and the west side of the Quad.
The purpose of the mall project
was to install new utility lines —
in a 35-foot deep trench stretching
nearly the length of the Quad
from Serra Street — for a $250
million science and engineering
center in the Near West Campus,
slated for development over the
next 10 to 15 years.
Because the mall project went
many months over the scheduled

deadline, the University had to
slightly exceed the project's $4.7
million budget to pay its own proj
ect managers and inspectors who
were at the site nearly every day.
To cover these costs, the Uni
versity has withheld $500 per day
from the contractor, Pacific Un
derground Construction, since the
original completion deadline
passed Oct. 24.
According to Kennedy, "numer
ous problems have been the story
of this project." In November, a
truck transporting steam pipes to
Stanford crashed in Nevada and
the pipes were destroyed in the

ensuing fire.
In a separate incident, the con
tractor took four months to obtain
other steam and chilled water
pipes. Then January and Febru
ary rains halted construction for
more than two weeks.
The contractor has requested
the return of some of the withheld
funds but refused to comment
about the issue in a phone inter
view.
Despite the problems with the
project and the conflict over the
withheld funds, however, Ken
nedy said the University still con
siders Pacific Underground
Construction to be "one of our
better contractors" and "we still
consider them to be a friend."
Pacific Underground Construe

tion was "99.9 percent" sure that,
except for some minor work such
as repairs to sprinklers that were
damaged in the construction, the
final repaying of the site will be
done by the end of the week.
Kennedy expects that the fenc
ing in front of the McCullough
Building, located on the southern
end of the Physics Tank, will be
removed today. The rest of the

fence, all the way to the Varian
Physics Lab on the north end of
the Physics Tank, will be gone in
about a week and a half.
In response to complaints about
the noise from the site, Kennedy
noted that it is difficult for a large
construction project to go on
"quiet and unseen." With a
sheepish grin he added, "We sure
are sorry that it took so long."
