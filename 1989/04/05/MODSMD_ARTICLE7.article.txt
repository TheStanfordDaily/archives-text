# Reins tighten on Tuesday Films

The Tuesday Films' famously unorthodox content
has attracted University scrutiny, and one film se
ries coordinator claims the precautionary measures
smack of censorship.
The University's reauest for an advance list of
the scheduled films, along with other regulations
on the conduct of the series, has provoked coordi
nators' bewilderment and anger.
Until the coordinators submit a list of the films,
Events and Services is refusing to provide space for
the showings.
According to Eric Diesel, one of the coordinators
of the film scries and a doctoral candidate in sta
tistics, this is the first time the University has
asked the students to submit a list before space is
granted.
"I've never heard of any university asking for a
master list of the films before they are shown," he
said.
In order for the Tuesday Films to continue, the
University must see the list of films being shown,
the student-run organization must specifically ad

vertise films with X-ratings and a sign must be
posted outside the movie warning viewers about
the content of the film.
The Tuesday Films are a series of films that have
little commercial value and are often foreign. Ac
cording to Diesel, the ASSU in recent years has
deemed the series the most cost-effective student
run organization on campus. The films, shown
weekly at Cubberley Auditorium, cost the University
approximately three cents per student per film, but
admission is free.
Responding to Diesel's allegations of outright cen
sorship, Director of Events and Services Lois Wagner
said, "We do not censor. We do not approve or
disapprove of the films. We just want [these precau
tions instituted] in order not to offend members of
the public. We do not want the rest of the community
caught off guard."
Wagner said Diesel has submitted a list to Events
and Services in compliance with standard University
procedure every year since the films began five
years ago. Diesel contends that this is the first year
the University required the list before granting
