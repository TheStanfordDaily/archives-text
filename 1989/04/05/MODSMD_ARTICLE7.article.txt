# Reins tighten on Tuesday Films
## 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
The Tuesday Films' famously unorthodox content
has attracted University scrutiny, and one film se
ries coordinator claims the precautionary measures
smack of censorship.
The University's reauest for an advance list of
the scheduled films, along with other regulations
on the conduct of the series, has provoked coordi
nators' bewilderment and anger.
Until the coordinators submit a list of the films,
Events and Services is refusing to provide space for
the showings.
According to Eric Diesel, one of the coordinators
of the film scries and a doctoral candidate in sta
tistics, this is the first time the University has
asked the students to submit a list before space is
granted.
"I've never heard of any university asking for a
master list of the films before they are shown," he
said.
In order for the Tuesday Films to continue, the
University must see the list of films being shown,
the student-run organization must specifically ad

vertise films with X-ratings and a sign must be
posted outside the movie warning viewers about
the content of the film.
The Tuesday Films are a series of films that have
little commercial value and are often foreign. Ac
cording to Diesel, the ASSU in recent years has
deemed the series the most cost-effective student
run organization on campus. The films, shown
weekly at Cubberley Auditorium, cost the University
approximately three cents per student per film, but
admission is free.
Responding to Diesel's allegations of outright cen
sorship, Director of Events and Services Lois Wagner
said, "We do not censor. We do not approve or
disapprove of the films. We just want [these precau
tions instituted] in order not to offend members of
the public. We do not want the rest of the community
caught off guard."
Wagner said Diesel has submitted a list to Events
and Services in compliance with standard University
procedure every year since the films began five
years ago. Diesel contends that this is the first year
the University required the list before granting
space.
In the past, he said, the room
was approved, and then the list
was submitted. Diesel said he
thought the purpose of the list
was only for the projectionist to
know which film to run. "If I had
known I was submitting a McCar
thyesque list, I would never have
complied. Where does the Univer
sity get the power to censor
films?" he said.
Catherine Zerboni, the current
director of Tuesday Films and a
senior in economics, disagrees
with Diesel about the severity of
the University's moves. She said
the University's enforcement of
these policies surprised her, but
that Events and Services had as
sured her that no films will be

rejected once the list is submitted.
"As long as they let us show the
films, there is no censorship going
on in my eyes," she said.
Zerboni said she sees the situ
ation as "a way for the University
to oversee all student-run organ
izations, which is sad."
One of the films on this quar
ter's roster that Diesel said he
fears might be victim to increased
University monitoring is "Faro,"
a film about a homosexual com
munist poet in Italy whose entire
family is killed by facists during
the World War II era.
Diesel regularly gives a half
hour talk to introduce each film
before it starts. Zerboni said the
introduction given is usually ex
plicit enough to those sitting in
the audience, and predicts that
the advertising and warning signs
might actually serve to draw more
attention to the films rather than
advising people of the content.
