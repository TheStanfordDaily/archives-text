# Positive, piecemeal approach

While reaction from University
officials to the University Com
mittee on Minority Issues report
was positive, implementation of
the committee's recommenda
tions will be very slow, and some
measures may never be enacted.
University President Donald
Kennedy and Provost James
Rosse have charged a new task
force to review each recommen
dation and organize its implemen
tation with the departments af
fected. The committee will be co
chaired by Registrar Sally Ma
honey and Vice-Provost Ray Bac
chetti. In order to prevent unnec

essary delays, the committee will
not have a fixed deadline but will
adopt its decisions on a piecemeal
basis.
Kennedy and Rosse did not
guarantee the implementation of
all the committee's 117 recom
mendations. "In our view, some
of the Committee's recommenda
tions could be implemented
promptly.. . . Others would prove
more difficult; still others may
not be workable at all," said Ken
nedy and Rosse in a joint state
ment released today.
Reaction from student groups
was generally positive. Black Stu
