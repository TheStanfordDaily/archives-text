# Positive, piecemeal approach

### Ken Yew Staff writer 
While reaction from University
officials to the University Com
mittee on Minority Issues report
was positive, implementation of
the committee's recommenda
tions will be very slow, and some
measures may never be enacted.
University President Donald
Kennedy and Provost James
Rosse have charged a new task
force to review each recommen
dation and organize its implemen
tation with the departments af
fected. The committee will be co
chaired by Registrar Sally Ma
honey and Vice-Provost Ray Bac
chetti. In order to prevent unnec

essary delays, the committee will
not have a fixed deadline but will
adopt its decisions on a piecemeal
basis.
Kennedy and Rosse did not
guarantee the implementation of
all the committee's 117 recom
mendations. "In our view, some
of the Committee's recommenda
tions could be implemented
promptly.. . . Others would prove
more difficult; still others may
not be workable at all," said Ken
nedy and Rosse in a joint state
ment released today.
Reaction from student groups
was generally positive. Black Stu
dent Union spokesperson Lewis
Jackson commended the report
for pointing out deficiencies in the
ethnic studies curriculum. He said
the graphs in the report show how
there are hardly any students
taking ethnic studies courses.
Asian-American Student Asso
ciation spokesperson Brian Kim

said the report was generally good,
although he said the "Student
Life" section should have had
greater emphasis. Kim said the
report will particularly affect the
Asian-American community in its
recommendations to reconsider
Asian faculty and graduate stu
dents for targeted minority status.
The development of an Asian-
American studies curriculum will
also have a great impact on the
community, Kim said.

Kennedy and Rosse pointed out
that the report will only have a
full impact if the University com
munity takes the time to read it.
"Merely to scan the recommenda
tions is not sufficient to grasp the
depth and quality of what has
been accomplished," they said.
"Implementation will involve de
cisions informed by discussions in
many parts of the University and
will function best if broadly
based."
