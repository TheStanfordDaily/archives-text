The CalTVain Peninsula
Commuter and new Santa Cruz Con
nector, to l)e exact.
Ttoo high-performance on
and off-road vehicles with one great
built-in luxury: you don't have
to drive!
And with 9 roundtrips daily —
H on holidays and weekends—there's
a train-bus combination for every
schedule. One every other hour.
Just hop a southbound
CallYain anywhere on the Penin
sula. Then, when you arrive in San
Jose, there'll be a special dedicate!
Santa Cruz Connector waiting to
pick you up at the station and wisk
you off to the Santa Cruz Metro
Center—just a few bl<x-ks from
the beach!
For a lot less than the price
of a full tank of gas. And that's
important if you'd rather spend your
cash at the Boardwalk instead of
getting there.
So if you'd like to get to Santa
Cruz without a car bmakdown tor
a nervous breakdown!), get on the
phone and call Cal'lYain for more
information: l-HOO-fSftH-Hfitfl.
