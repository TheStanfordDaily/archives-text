There's one word
to describe our pizza
and you won't find it
in an Italian dictionary.
It's finom, meaning delicious in
Hungarian And, once you taste an
Applewood pizza you'll know why It's
nothing like our Italian counterpart
Sure, we've got the basics -crust,
sauce, cheese and toppings—but they
taste better. And the ways they come
together 9 Well, it's finom!
You don't have to be Hungarian to love
it. You don't even have to know where
Hungary is. You just have to go to the
nearest Applewood Inn, or call the
nearest Applewood 2-Go, and you'll
know what we mean.
It's not just pizza at Applewood.
