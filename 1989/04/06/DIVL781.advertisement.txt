You don't need
your parents' money
to buy a Macintosh.
Just their signature.
It's never been difficult for
students to convince their
parents of the need for a
Macintosh computer at
Stanford University.
Persuading them to write
the check, however, is anoth
er thing altogether.
Which is why Apple created
the Student Loan-to-Own
Program. An Ingenious loan
program that will make buy
ing a Macintosh as easy as
using one.
Simply pick up an applica
tion at Stanford Book-store,
or call 800-831-LOAN. All
your parents need to do is
fill it out, sign it, and send it.
If they qualify, they'll receive
a check for you in just a few
weeks.
There's no collateral. No
need to prove financial hard
ship. No application fee.
Best of all, the loan pay
ments can be spread over as
many as 10 years.
Which give you and your
parents plenty of time to
decide just who pays for it
all.
Stop by Stanford Bookstore's Microdisc Center and find out more about Apple's
Student Loan-to-Own Program.
