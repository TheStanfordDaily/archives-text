# Alcohol plan puts trust in students
## 
### Elaine Riggs Staff writer 
Under a new alcohol policy pro
posal, the University would vir
tually cease to regulate student
alcohol use while reminding stu
dents that their actions may still
be punishable under California
law.
"What this does is get us out
of the business of being law en
forcement officers," Assoc. Dean
of Student Affairs Norm Robinson
said.
To allow for community input,
a forum will be held from 4 to 5
p.m. today in the Tresidder Un
ion's Cypress South room.
The committee plans to review
comments from today's forum and
pass them on with the alcohol
policy as a recommendation to
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons.
Committee member Grant
Winfrey, a co-term senior, said he
didn't know when the proposal
would be enacted, adding that
they are currently in the begin
ning stages of implementing such
a change.

Winfrey said the committee will
be sensitive to any reaction from
the community and residential
deans while deliberating the new
policy implementation.
The University's current alcohol
policy calls on "each individual
student and each student living
group to assume responsibility for
both individual and group com
pliance" with California state law
which prohibits people under 21
from possessing alcohol. Another
provision of the current policy re
quires residences to "adopt and
maintain" regulations concerning
alcohol use.
In eliminating these specific
guidelines, the proposed policy ef
fectively shifts the emphasis from
University and peer regulation of
alcohol consumption to individual
responsibility.
The proposal also allows the
University greater flexibility in
deciding whether to punish stu
dents for alcohol-related conduct,
noting that irresponsible conduct
"may be" a violation of the Uni
versity Residential Agreement or
the Fundamental Standard.
"The proposed policy says noth
ing about age, nothing about class
in school. It treats all students the
same. It really says something
about behavior," said Robinson,
a member of the committee. The
six-member committee is com
posed of students, staff and fac
ulty.
"You have to be educated and
you have to be responsible and
we're not going to protect you
from the consequences if you vi
olate the law," said Cowell Health
Promotion Specialist Louise Mil
ler, also a committee member.
According to one part of the
current policy, "Alcoholic bever
ages may be served at social func
tions in residences other than

those occupied predominantly by
freshmen only if non-alcoholic
beverages are also served at such
functions."
"I don't even know what that
means," Robinson said.
Miller added, "That's basically
saying that alcoholic beverages
cannot be served in places where
there are predominantly freshmen
— and it's difficult to enforce
something like that."
Robinson said the current policy
is confusing because it mixes state
law with University guidelines.
The new alcohol policy would
be separate from alcohol-related
California laws. However, the Cal
ifornia laws are added on in a
separate part of the statement as
a reminder to students of the
state-enforced legal consequences
of their actions.
