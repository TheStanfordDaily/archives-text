Foothills cop is a natural
Doug Williams, the new "lone ranger"
assigned to patrol the Stanford foothills on
horseback, admits he has landed a dream job.
"I've done a lot of different things over
the years since I've been at Stanford, and
I see this as an interesting new challenge,"
explains Williams, a longtime staff member
in the Department of Public Safety.
Beyond that, he adds, "We've all spent
our time at the desk, and most of us, es
pecially in the spring, would much rather
be outside. When you can actually turn that
into a career opportunity, it definitely is a
dream come true."
It would have been hard to find someone
better suited for the job than Williams, 47.
As fire safety communications coordinator
from 1977 to 1988, he had responsibility

for campus radio communication, fire and
burglar alarm systems, giving him a good
knowledge of the University and its various
departments.
He is also personally familiar with the
foothills region, having lived for the past
18 years on property adjacent to the Uni
versity's foothill lands, on Alpine Road. "My
children grew up with the property in their
backyard, so I have a real interest in it,
he explains.

State eyeing ASSU elections
State and county elections officials are
keeping a watchful eye toward Stanford,
where the student body will hold the state's
first election by computer April 18 and 19.
"We're very proud of the University in

taking this step, which as far as we know
is a first in the state," said John Molchan,
Santa Clara County's assistant registrar of
voters, who plans to observe the spring elec
tion process.
"We're real interested in it as an experi
ment," said John Mott-Smith, who will come
to campus from the Secretary of State's
Office in Sacramento to watch the students
cast their ballots. "One of the relationships
we're interested in is the involvement of
Silicon Valley companies in creating
software that would ensure security."
Both officials indicated their agencies' in
terest in moving toward computerized gen
eral elections.
Observing the student body election will
provide them with preliminary indications
of an admittedly select public's reaction, the
said.
