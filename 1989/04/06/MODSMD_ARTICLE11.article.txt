## Poland's leaders sign historic pact Agreement restores Solidarity union

WARSAW, Poland (AP) -
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa
sealed a historic deal with the
government yesterday to res
tore the independent trade un
ion after a seven-year ban and
give Poland its first democratic
elections since World War 11.
Walesa, representing the op
position, and Gen. Czeszlaw
Kiszczak, the interior minister
representing Poland's commu
nist government, approved the
package that emerged from two
months of negotiations on po
litical and economic reforms,
as the 57 participants in the
talks gathered for a final time
at the "round table" in the
Council of Ministers Palace.
"There ia no freedom without
Solidarity," Walesa said at the
beginning of a 10-minute ad
dress to the table in which he
explained why the opposition
had approved the agreements.
He credited authorities with
having shown "readiness for a
radical change of the system."
But he said that behind the
"nice words" of communist au
thorities for the past 45 years
there was "dishonesty and vi
olence," and Solidarity had
aimed for "substantial settle
ments that could be imple
mented right away."
He declared the opposition
had achieved the "necessary
minimum" by regaining the le
gal status lost after martial law
was imposed in December
1981.

"I think that the round-table
talks can become the beginning
of the road to democracy and
a free Poland, and hence we
look with boldness and hope
into the future," he said.
Kiszczak lauded the talks
that brought together different
sides of Poland's political spec
trum.
In Washington, the White
House called the accord "a
great day for the Polish people
and for freedom." Press Secre
tary Marlin Fitzwater said
President Bush was "very
pleased by the accords that
have started Poland on this
new path toward reconcilia
tion."
Polish leader Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski, who banned
Solidarity in 1981, argued
strongly for its restoration at
a Communist Party plenum in
January, saying it would be the
culmination of his policy of na
tional reconciliation.
The government, acknowl
edging it needed greater public
support to take the painful
steps of reviving the economy,
offered the talks to Solidarity
last year to help end a series
of strikes.
The government agreed to
restore legal status to
Solidarity, the farmers' union
Rural Solidarity and the Inde
pendent Students Association.
All had been banned in the
martial-law crackdown.
