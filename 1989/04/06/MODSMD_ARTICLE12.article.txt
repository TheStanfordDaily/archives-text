# Exxon attempts to refloat Valdez

VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) - The
tanker Exxon Valdez was freed
yesterday from the reef that
ripped its hull and spilled more
than 10 million gallons of crude
oil, and Alaska's governor said the
Coast Guard would take over the
cleanup from Exxon.
Elsewhere, the captain of the
Exxon Valdez surrendered to
police and was ordered held on
$1 million bond.
Cleanup crews continued to
skim mayonnaise-thick oil from
Prince William Sound, but prog
ress was slow and the oil had
spread over an area larger than
Delaware. The animal death toll
rose and salmon hatcheries re
mained endangered.
In Juneau, Alaska Gov. Steve
Cowper said he asked the Coast
Guard to take over the much
maligned and slowly progressing
cleanup effort from Exxon, and
that the federal agency had
agreed.
Cowper said the Coast Guard
should be better able to handle
coordination and management of
the cleanup than Exxon, which
he said was too bureaucratic.
"Maybe that's been the problem
all along. You need a military sys
tem to get things done," the
governor said.
"We appreciate the efforts of
Exxon â€” we think they were done
in good faith. But we think there
has to be a much more disciplined
management structure," Cowper
said at a Capitol news conference.
President Bush earlier had sent
a team of high-level officials to
Valdez and determined that
federal management of the
cleanup wasn't necessary.
Although Cowper said he didn't
want to be "extremely critical" of
Exxon, a letter sent to the Coast
Guard by a state environmental

official said Exxon had been un
responsive.
"Exxon has failed to provide the
information necessary to make
sound planning recommendations
regarding the cleanup of oil and
the protection of resources,"
wrote Lynn Kent, chief of the
state Oil and Hazardous Sub
stance Spill Response Section.
Exxon spokesman Henry Beat
hard said the company disagreed
with charges it wasn't handling
the cleanup properly and thought
Exxon was the best organization
to manage the effort.
"We gathered all the resources
and organized the cleanup. We
think the most effective and effi

cient way to carry out this project
is (for Exxon) to continue," Beat
hard said.
Fired tanker captain Joseph
Hazelwood, 42, surrendered to
police on New York's Long Island
and a judge set bail at $1 million
bond or $500,000 in cash, up from
a prosecutor's recommendation of
$25,000. He had been sought since
Saturday on a fugitive warrant on
misdemeanor charges of operating
the tanker while drunk.
"These misdemeanors are of
such a magnitude that has never
been equaled, at least in this coun
try," Judge Kenneth Rohl said as
Hazelwood was arraigned. "He's
got to think about that. We have

a manmade destruction that has
not been equaled, probably, since
Hiroshima."
Salvage crews pumped com
pressed air into the $125 million
ship and floated it off Bligh Reef,
25 miles from the port of Valdez.
From there, it began a 30-mile
journey under the control of six
tugs to a remote cove off Naked
Island for temporary repairs,
picking its way through scattered
icebergs.
"No pollution was immediately
visible. There's a real good possi
bility (oil) sheen will show up, but
they're ready for it," Coast Guard
spokesman Rick Meidt said.
