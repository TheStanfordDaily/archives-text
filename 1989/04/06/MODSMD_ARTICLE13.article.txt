# Eastern sale grounded again

### 
NEW YORK (AP) - For the
second time in a week, former
baseball commissioner Peter
Ueberroth thought he had a deal
to purchase Eastern Airlines only
to see the agreement with Texas
Air Corp. Chairman Frank
Lorenzo fall through at the last
minute.

The deal began to un
ravel yesterday, as
Ueberroth believed
Lorenzo was again
changing the terms of
the agreement.

A source familiar with the ne
gotiations said the two sides
reached an accord Tuesday night
and were set to make the an
nouncement yesterday. The
source said the deal began to un

ravel yesterday morning, as
Ueberroth believed Lorenzo was
again changing the terms of the
agreement.
"Both sides thought they had a
deal but there were some sticking
points that kept negotiations con
tinuing instead of concluding,"
the source said.
Ueberroth, who returned to
New York late Tuesday night
from his California home, began
negotiations with Lorenzo at 7:30
a.m. EST yesterday and continued
them until around 8 p.m. The
source told The Associated Press
that negotiations would resume
tomorrow morning.
"They don't have a deal," the
source said. "There's still negoti
ations and sticking points."
The deal had appeared to be
completed yesterday afternoon,
when a New York public relations
firm that works with Lorenzo was
told to rent a hotel room for a 7
p.m. news conference to announce
it. At 6:35 p.m., the public rela

tions firm was told there would
be no announcement.
Separately, the U.S. bankruptcy
court appointed Washington at
torney David Shapiro as examiner
in the Eastern bankruptcy reor
ganization case.
Shapiro, 60, a partner in the
firm Dickstein Shapiro & Morin,
was recommended by U.S. Trus
tee Harry Jones and appointed by
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton
Lifland.
Lifland recently ordered the ap
pointment of an examiner, whose
unusually broad powers would in
clude a mandate to mediate the
bitter labor dispute at Eastern
and get the airline flying again.
Bruce Zirinsky, a bankruptcy
attorney representing Eastern,
said an aocord on the sale of the
carrier was "likely imminent." He
didn't name the suitor but sources
have said it was the Ueberroth
group, which made and later with
drew a $464 million offer for East
ern last week.
