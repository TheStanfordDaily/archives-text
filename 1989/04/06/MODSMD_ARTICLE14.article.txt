U.S.S.R. sells bombers to Lybia
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Soviet Union has
sold Libya from 12 to 15 high-performance
fighter-bombers capable of striking long-range
targets in the Middle East and posing a potential
threat to Egypt and possibly Israel, Bush admin
istration officials said yesterday.
Without confirming the transaction, the State
Department sharply criticized Libya and, indirect
ly, the Soviet Union.
"The sale of any kind of sophisticated weaponry
to Libya would be a dangerous thing, given
(Libyan leader Moammar) Gadhafi's past be
havor," spokesman Richard Boucher said.
And, he said, if the Soviets made such a deal,
"we would be concerned."
Because the transaction was uncovered
through U.S. intelligence, administration officials
publicly would neither deny nor confirm reports
of it. But privately, officials speaking on the
condition of anonymity said the Soviets had
begun delivery of the supersonic SU-24 Fencers.
One official found even more disturbing Soviet
assistance to Libya in lengthening the range of
Soviet-built refueling planes. He said that could

pose a danger to Egypt, long at odds with Libya,
and possibly with Israel, whose existence is hotly
challenged by Gadhafi.
Impeached governor to run again
PHOENIX (AP) — Mainstream Republicans
were on the defensive yesterday after former
Gov. Evan Mecham's announcement that he will
try for a second term as governor despite being
impeached and ousted part way through his first
one.
State Senate President Robert Usdane, mean
while, rejected Mecham's call for a new impeach
ment trial, clearing the way for Mecham to take
his case to court.
One Republican, state Rep. Jim Hartdegen,
wore a black armband to the House floor Wed
nesday in mourning for the Republican Party.
"The death was last night," Hartdegen said.
"The burial will be in November 1990."
Mecham told a cheering rally Tuesday night
that he would win the GOP primary in 1990
and would beat his replacement, Democratic Gov.
Rose Mofford, in the general election.
