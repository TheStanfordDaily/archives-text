## Invigorate CIV 
### 
Don't let momentum
of change get lost
in faculty inaction

Alack of interest and
initiative on the part of the
University is slowly lulling
the Cultures, Ideas and Values
program to sleep.
If Stanford's faculty does not
put more time and energy into
keeping the program alive, stu
dents may end up with only a
revised Western Culture pro
gram, rather than the originally
planned reconstruction.
Judging from the lack of prog
ress and attention, the CIV pro
gram has slipped from its former
position of prominence on Stan
ford's education agenda. A r ter
the furious debate from which
CIV emerged, the University's
implicit relegation of the program
to a lower priority seems aston
ishing.
So far only one new CIV track
has been proposed. Although the
faculty has the excuse of time
limitations, the University ad
ministration should be making
more of an effort to spur the
professors' initiative.
Another problem that has
arisen in the CIV program is the
dearth of faculty qualified to
teach issues of non-European cul
tures and American racial minor
ities.

University President Donald
Kennedy and Provost James
Rosse should heed the request of
the Area One Committee to hire
more faculty "with training ap
propriate to carry out the pro
gram in CIV."
The situation is ultimately a
product of the University's lack
of commitment to undergraduate
teaching. Instructors for CIV are
poorly paid, work extremely hard,
and are generally not granted per
manent or tenure-track positions.
The program in CIV cannot
even afford to fly applicants for
positions to the University, effec
tively limiting the selection pool
to the Bay Area.
However, there have been some
steps in the right direction.
Meyer Library, for instance, has
offered to provide help in finding
materials related to CIV. Assoc.
Professor of History Clay Carson
is making an archive on multi
cultural education to be used for
CIV.
At the same time, Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies Thomas
Wasow is currently preparing to
put money from a fund he con
trols toward efforts to improve
CIV.
The University should follow
Wasow's example by putting its
money where its mouth is, and
acknowledge the importance of
the CIV program by granting the
appropriate funds, time and com
mitment to it. Otherwise all the
past years' time and energy will
have been in vain.
