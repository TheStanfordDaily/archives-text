## People's Platform has not served student needs 
### 
IN THEIR VAGUE defense of the
People's Platform in a March 10
letter, Julie Martinez and Kathleen
Coll assert that "the ASSU has both
involved and served more students
than ever before."
Let us example their thought
provoking "evidence."
• Beat the Bookstore: This pet proj
ect absorbs large quantities of student
funding on advertising. This advertis
ing conveniently doubles as People's
Platform public relations — "Brought
to you by the People's Platform COP"
happens to be written on each flier.
The program has yet to show that it
has at least broken even. While under
cutting Bookstore prices by operating
at a loss, the People's Platform

reduces student rebates at the non
profit Bookstore.
• The Used Book Faire: This project
is a mess. The ASSU has a static
inventory of hundreds of books, collect
ing dust, helping no one.
• Course Consultants: There is not
much to be said against this project,
yet what can be said for it? We think
AAs, advisers and RAs are doing a fine
job.
• Financial Aid Advocates: This job
has been taken care of by the folks up
in Financial Aid in Old Union for
quite some time now. It does look good
on student-funded fliers, though,
doesn't it?
• Spring Action '89: This $5000
contribution of student money to a

project of the California Alliance of
Progressive Student Activists benefits
elementary and high school students.
While it is a worthy project, how could
Stanford students know whether it was
worth so much of our money?
• Dorm Representatives: The People's
Platform did not create the idea, but
borrowed it from last year's COP.
They have bolstered this program in
some residences, while neglecting it in
others. Personal experience has shown
us that only those students who go to
the ASSU on their own initiative have
been touched by this program.
• The Airport Shuttle: The idea for
this project has been around for at
least three years. Conveniently for the
People's Platform, it resurfaced right

before election time.
And how about those universal ID
cards, which could have been in our
pockets by next year? And what about
the virtually unknown ASSU Boat
house, in need of repair? The People's
Platform chose to neglect these projects
for the sake of their "student" agenda,
including the United Stanford Workers,
the Grape Boycott, and Spring Action
'89.
Real student needs seem way down
on the list of the People's Platform
priorities.
