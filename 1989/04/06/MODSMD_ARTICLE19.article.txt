# Bicyclists harm Dish area no more than other users
## 
### 
I am writing to voice my outrage not
only at the recent closure of the Dish
area to bicycles, which is not rationally
justifiable, but especially at the high
handed and uninformed manner in
which this was carried out.
As a regular user of the Stanford
Foothills area and as a full-time stu
dent on this campus (and reader of
The Daily and The San Francisco
Chronicle) I saw no notification of a
public hearing concerning this matter.
Regardless of whether there was
some small-print notice given, it was
evidently insufficient to bring the mat
ter to the attention of the relevant
concerned community members. Signs
by the foothill gate would have served
effectively and easily, had the Univer

sity actually sought public participa
tion.
The Chronicle article presenting this
clumsy fait accompli refers to evidence
given at a "public" hearing to the ef
fect that off-road bicycles are responsi
ble for an unacceptable level of ecologi
cal damage. I am a Ph.D. student in
biology and I am fairly certain there
exists no scientific data concerning the
relative impact of bicycles, cattle and
horses, and joggers.
For less than the University intends
to spend on even a short period of
"lone ranger" patrol, it could conduct
such a valuable study; such an inquiry
befits an institution of higher learning
better than the muscle-flexing
militarism of a "lone ranger" whose
horse itself damages trails and soils
them besides.
Naturally, nobody at Stanford wants
to see the Dish area despoiled before
its time. However, is not such devotion
to ecology misplaced in an area open to
cattle grazing, construction of radar
equipment, and slated for forthcoming

development?
Stanford has Jasper Ridge as a bio
logical preserve; the Dish has tradition
ally been a recreational area and a
scenic feature, functions admirably
consonant with use by the responsible
cyclists that compose the vast mÂ£yority
of bicycling users.
