The University expects students to be responsible for the con
sequences of their decisions to serve and consume alcohol and
to create environments that are safe and healthful and that promote
responsible behavior.
There are several likely consequences if students are not re
sponsible in their decisions to serve and consume alcohol:
• the conduct may be a violation of the University Residential
Agreement, subjecting the student to loss of University housing;
• the conduct may be a violation of the Fundamental Standard,
subjecting the student to discipline, including suspension or ex
pulsion; and
• the conduct may be a violation of state and local laws
concerning possessing, serving and consumption of alcohol which
might result in a student's arrest, prosecution, conviction and
punishment in the criminal justice system.
