# Stereotyping of graduate students is also offensive

In response to Stephen Dinan's April
4 letter apologizing for his behavior at
the March 19 Sunday Flicks, I agree
that his action was, as he so plainly
stated, immature. However, I noticed
that he saw no need to apologize for
anything beyond the possible racial
implications of his misunderstood out
burst.

Stanford has always deemed it ac
ceptable to immaturely sterotype grad
uate students as alien creatures devoid
of social graces, reduced to the position
of "untouchables" in the great Stanford
social caste system. Good student, bad
student, black student, grad student —
we are all still students! No, I may
never be black, Hispanic, Asian or gay,
but being a graduate student here has
allowed me a glimpse of the sad treat
ment that minorities receive in our
society.
