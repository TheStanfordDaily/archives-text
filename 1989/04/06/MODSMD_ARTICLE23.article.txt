THE WEEK IN MARCH that I spent
with the Cardinal's varsity baseball
team has to rank as one of the low
points in Stanford baseball history.
The two-time defending national cham
pion Cardinal was swept at home by Ar
izona State University by an aggregate
score of 27-10. Their best pitchers got
shelled. The defense averaged 2.3 errors
per game. They were outhit 41-15, and
(to add ii\jury to insult) their only con
sistent hitter was hurt badly in the face
by a bad-hop grounder in game three.
Their record dropped to a cellar-worthy
1-5 in the league, 10-13 overall. After
that weekend series, the team that had
been the best in the nation for the pre
vious two years found itself deep in a
hole. Winning the league, or even making
the playoffs at all, seemed unlikely, even
fantastic.
To top it all off, it was midterms week.
1 wanted to experience first-hand what
it's like to be part of a varsity team in
the Pacific 10 Conference and a Stanford
student during exam cruch, because,
frankly, athletics mystifies me.
Stanford's role in collegiate athletics is
somewhat incongruous. The NCAA
sanctified lies and hypocrisy that pass
for athletic policy at too many schools in
America disintegrate when Stanford is
used as the yardstick against which to
measure them.
The assumption that Stanford and the
University of Oklahoma, for example, are
somehow equivalent institutions whose
respective "student-athletes" are basi
cally interchangeable commodities is lu
dicrous in the extreme. Common sense

says that Stanford should not compete
against Oklahoma because we'll get
smeared.
But common sense lies. Stanford does
compete, and it competes aggressively
and well. In order to find out what this
composition means for the individual
student-athlete, I "joined" the baseball
team.
I went to practice and tried to keep
out of the way; I did some running and
some "gofer-ing" and hung out with the
players.
In the interest of full disclosure, I con
fess that my workouts were not nearly
as intense as the rest of the team's, and
that my emotional involvement could not
approach theirs. Then again, I was in a
lot worse shape than they were, and I
did not have the advantage of the team's
support network.
I had thought that the toughest part
of Pac-10 athletics would be the time
commitment, which is huge. The baseball
team works out for about four hours
every day for more than half the year.
Games — of which there are at least
three each week — can take up to seven
or eight hours from arrival to departure.
I also knew that the physical drain
would be a bear. Try going to classes in
the morning, working out for four hours
and then hitting the books.
But I had not counted on the emotional
drain. Unlike academics, sports are a bi
nary proposition: you either win or lose.
It's a game, but it's a zero-sum game.
The baseball season is about 70 games
long, so the stress of evaluation, the emo
tional demand, the pressure is all almost

I confess that my workouts
were not nearly as intense!
as the rest of the team's.

constant.
More than the time, more than the
physical drain, this emotional roller
coaster wrings athletes out. It's also what
separates athletics from the other de-i
manding extracurriculars, such as drama
or symphony.
Of course, students pay an academic
price for their competition: hard scientists
and engineers, linguists and individually
designed meyors are hard to find in thq
dugout. My own midterm grades suffered:
But the academic price, though steep, is
not exorbitant; it's hard, but manageable!
The ASU team that swept Stanford
that weekend was in the middle of a 10;
game roadtrip — missing 10 days of
school — a roadtrip which summarizes
the difference between Stanford and al-i
most every other athletic school in thei
country. ASU forces its athletes to bej
second-class students; Stanford forces
athletes not to be, and still competes. •
