## Sizzling spikers trounce Trojans in three 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
Well, you can forget about the
slump. The Stanford men's vol
leyball team is officially on fire.
The powerful Trojans of USC
attempted to upend the home
standing Cardinal last night, put
ting forth a valiant effort. Indeed,
if Stanford Coach Fred Sturm had
known his opponents were going
to hit over .400 as a team, he
would have thought his boys
would be in for a long night. But,
much to the delight of the 1,751
electrified fans on hand at the
match, the Trojan effort was not
quite enough.

Cardinal 3, Trojans 0

In fact, riding a team hitting
percentage of over .500, the Car
dinal swept Southern Cal in three.
The final scores were 15-10, 17-
15, 15-10.
Stanford's Fearsome Foursome,
hitters Dan Hanan, Scott For
tune, Duncan Blackman and Mike
Lowe, all had close to career
nights, and such a complete team
effort could not have come at a
more opportune time.
The win keeps the Cardinal
right on UCLA's heels, only one
game back in the race for the
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association league title.
Stanford sophomore Mike Lowe
had a season-high .800 hitting
percentage, greatly contributing to
the Cardinal cause and typifying
his team's night.
"All I do is try to play mistake
free volleyball," commented Lowe.
"When I get sets, I just hit smart;
I don't try to overpower anybody
and just avoid (hitting) errors."
Lowe, if he is really the role
player that he claims he is, rose
from that limited job description
a bit, knocking down 12 kills with,
unbelievably, zero errors.
Fortune had 32 kills and Black-

man notched 13 of his own, both
tallying individual percentages in
excess of .333.
"We definitely knew coming in
that we were all going to have to
play that well,"Fortune said. And
the hitters certainly responded to
the challenge. However, nobody
rose to the occasion quite like
Hanan did.
Unconscious. That is really the
only word that can capture the
uncanny destructive ability dem
onstrated by Hanan in the match.
Hanan had an incredible 42 kills
for the match.
"Yeah. That's a good way to
describe my night," Hanan
agreed. "Parker Blackman and all
of the hitters fought the ball all
night, and things just worked out
well."
Parker Blackman elaborated,
saying, "The ball got really wet
because everybody was really
sweating tonight. My hands were
really slick, and I mishandled
seven or eight balls that should
have been routine kills for my
hitters.
"We didn't let those particular
plays get to us, though. We just
fought back."
And, when a team hits over
.500, anybody will tell you that
the setter is having a good outing.
Parker Blackman apparently was
successful in his efforts to fight
the problem.
As is evidenced by the Trojans'
.406 hitting percentage, the team
did not make things easy for their
Stanford hosts. And, had things
gone a little differently in game
two, the defending national
champs might have made the rest

of the match a little more intrigu
ing.
In that pivotal second game,
Stanford staved off four game
points en route to a 17-15 victory.
After USC had knotted the match
at 13, USC outside hitter
Lawrence Horn gave his team a
one point advantage with one of
his 26 kills.
Stanford erased one game point,
and then, on the second, USC had
a chance to put the game away.
The Trojans dug a Hanan smash,
but failed to put down their re
sulting opportunity.
The Cardinal needed no further
encouragement; Fortune crushed
the next Parker Blackman set to
erase game point number two.
USC got a quick sideout, only
to be answered by Duncan Black
man, who erased point number
three by nestling a kill into the
back right corner. Southern Cal
superstar Tom Duke was in the
net on the next play, which pulled
the Cardinal even at 14.
USC would get one more game
point, serving at 15-14. Hanan
took care of that slight problem;
his next ball sailed long but was
touched by the Trojan blockers.
Weary of the USC stand, Stan
ford made its move at this point.
The Cardinal battled for three
points in the next five minutes,
the last coming on a play that
featured Stanford's two money
players, Hanan and Fortune.
On game point, Hanan and For
tune both got quality swings but
were both dug by the crafty
Trojan defense. But, after the sec
ond dig, a Fortune-Hanan wall

roofed Chris Knowles' attempt,
and the game belonged to the Car
dinal.
After the first two games, the
Trojan uprising had been broken.
Stanford jumped all over its op
ponent in game three, building up
an eight-point advantage at 10-2.
However, USC showed its na
tional championship-caliber
mettle, fighting to only two points
back, 11-9. The Cardinal regained
its composure, though, and
quickly pocketed the win by
reeling off five of the next six
points in the game.
Hanan and Sturm both were
quick to commend the mental en
durance displayed by the team,
especially in the marathon that
was the second game.
"It was our passers (Fortune
and Blackman) up against theirs,"
Hanan explained. "The credit for
winning that second match cer
tainly must go to them."
Sturm summed up the night
when he said, "Hey, this was a
big win for us. We beat a very
good team that was playing very
well.
"This is the best team that's
come in here since Hawaii, and
I'm not sure if Hawaii's as tough
as these guys were tonight."
Next on the Cardinal schedule
is UC-San Diego, whom Stanford
will play at Maples on Friday
night. After what should be a rela
tively easy match against the
Tritons, Stanford digs in for the
home stretch.
Long Beach State will dare to
encroach upon Cardinal territory
a week from this coming Friday
in a match that will feature the
revenge factor.
You see, Long Beach was the
team that knocked off the Cardi
nal over Spring Break, and Stan
ford is, to say the least, hungry
for a second shot at the 49ers.
And, of course, the night after
that is the main attraction. UCLA
will come to town for the first of
the two-game series that is for all
the marbles in the WIVA. Need
more be said?


Senior Scott Fortune soars for one of his 32 kills last night against
USC. Fortune helped Stanford defeat the Trojans in three games
and hit over .500 for the match.
