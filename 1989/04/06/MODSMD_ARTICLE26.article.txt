# Predictions for another major league season
## 
### 
The 1989 major league baseball
season, ready or not, is officially
underway, and a few prognostica
tions are necessary before they become
old news.
The New York Mets' Darryl Straw
berry will elect to grow hair for the first
time in his league career. It's the
only feasible remedy for his anemic .196
batting average with men in scoring po
sition last season.
The San Diego Padres will not win the
National League West.
Scott Fletcher will prove why he's not
worth his three-year, $3.9 million con
tract.
Cubs' shortstop Shawon Dunston will
rip the webbing out of a dozen of first
baseman Mark Grace's gloves. Dunston
has the best arm on the planet, maybe
even better than Garry Templeton's was
in his prime. Tempy's is still one of the
best in the league, by the way.
Okay, okay, I'll tell you before the
suspense drives you to rummage around
for your Elias book. Fletcher is the Texas
Rangers' shortstop.

Nineteen-year old Ken Griffey Jr. will
be the best rookie in the majors but won't
be able to take the toast at the awards
ceremony. They'll give him a glass of
sparkling cider.
The Cardinals will lose more man
games to injury than any team in the
league. Fortunately for Whitey Herzog,
his hair is already all white.
Nolan Ryan will not lead the American
League in K's. But he'll again have more
than any pitcher in the senior circuit.
The Twins continue to shuttle right
fielders in and out of the lineup trying
to fill the void created by the bonehead

trade of Tom Brunansky.
George Bell will keep his mouth shut.
National League umpire Eric Gregg
will defeat the Phillie Phanatic in the
race for the 400-pound barrier.
Roger Craig proves his true genius as
the Giants finish a distant fourth in the
N. L. West pennant race.
Wade Boggs will miss six weeks because
of a groin pull.
Margo Adams surfaces in Tinseltown;
her new target is squeaky clean Orel
Hershisher.
Many an American Leaguer looks silly
trying to chase down Charlie Hough's
knuckle ball after facing the Ryan Ex
press the day before.
Minnesota's Kirby Puckett proves that
Strawberry shouldn't have let his hair
grow out.
Sparky Anderson will again have his
Detroit Journeymen in the pennant race,
somehow.
Cincinnati's Eric Davis will create the
50-50 club and still will be criticized for
being an underachiever.
The Dodgers scare for the N. L. West
title, but fall one John Franco save short.
Bell will outdistance the Angels' Chili

Davis for the American League lead in
errors by an outfielder.
Bo Jackson picks up a new hobby —
golf. He coerces Michael Jordan into early
retirement to join him on the PGA tour.
The New York Mets become the first
team in m*yor league history to pay every
player on their roster over $1 million a
year.
Houston's Glenn Davis again hits more
home runs in the Astrodome than all his
teammates combined (18-16 last year).
Nonetheless, the only people who hear
are in rotisserie leagues.
New Chris Berman player nicknames:
Gary Sheffield Pony; Jose Lind On Me;
Jim Abbott and Costello.
As the A's new T-shirts say, "This is
next year," and Oakland wins the World
Series.
The Mets defeat the Reds in five games
before losing to Oakland, who dismissed
the Brewers in five.
Mark McGwire outhomers Jose Can
seco.
And Jose pouts because he doesn't
reach 40-40 again.
As Jose falls into the mini-slump that
gives McGwire the edge, he again reverts

to changing his batting stance in the
middle of every at-bat.
Kent Hrbek stops changing his batting
stance in the middle of every at-bat and
proves once and for all that he's headed
for Cooperstown. But he still refuses to
play in the All-Star Game.
Greg Maddux fails to duplicate his
amazing first half from last year. Instead,
he has a great second half. As usual, the
Cubs finish near the bottom of their
division.
Kevin Mcßeynolds continues to show
that Trader Jack McKeon does not know
everything. He should have unloaded
Carmelo Martinez.
The Padres fall out of the pennant race
in August and end up helping to spoil
the Dodgers' repeat bid.
Pedro Guererro comes back to haunt
the Dodgers in a big way. With a grand
slam. In late August.
Ken Phelps flourishes as the Yankees'
DH.
That's about all that flourishes in the
Bronx as Dallas Green learns just how
hot George Steinbrenner's kitchen can
be. He'll be gone by the end of July.
Where's Billy?

grow out.
Sparky Anderson will again have his
Detroit Journeymen in the pennant race,
somehow.

50-50 club and still will be criticized for
being an underachiever.
The Dodgers scare for the N. L. West
title, but fall one John Franco save short.

Davis for the American League lead in

The New York Mets become the first
team in m*yor league history to pay every
player on their roster over $1 million a
year.
Houston's Glenn Davis again hits more

Nonetheless, the only people who hear

New Chris Berman player nicknames:

As the A's new T-shirts say, "This is
next year," and Oakland wins the World
Series.
The Mets defeat the Reds in five games
before losing to Oakland, who dismissed
the Brewers in five.
Mark McGwire outhomers Jose Can

And Jose pouts because he doesn't
reach 40-40 again.
As Jose falls into the mini-slump that
gives McGwire the edge, he again reverts

to changing his batting stance in the
middle of every at-bat.
Kent Hrbek stops changing his batting
stance in the middle of every at-bat and
proves once and for all that he's headed
for Cooperstown. But he still refuses to
play in the All-Star Game.
Greg Maddux fails to duplicate his
amazing first half from last year. Instead,
he has a great second half. As usual, the
Cubs finish near the bottom of their
division.
Kevin Mcßeynolds continues to show

everything. He should have unloaded
Carmelo Martinez.
The Padres fall out of the pennant race
in August and end up helping to spoil
the Dodgers' repeat bid.
Pedro Guererro comes back to haunt
the Dodgers in a big way. With a grand
slam. In late August.
Ken Phelps flourishes as the Yankees'
DH.
That's about all that flourishes in the
Bronx as Dallas Green learns just how
hot George Steinbrenner's kitchen can
be. He'll be gone by the end of July.

The 1989 major league baseball
season, ready or not, is officially
underway, and a few prognostica
tions are necessary before they become
old news.
The New York Mets' Darryl Straw
berry will elect to grow hair for the first
time in his league career. It's the
only feasible remedy for his anemic .196
batting average with men in scoring po
sition last season.
The San Diego Padres will not win the
National League West.
Scott Fletcher will prove why he's not
worth his three-year, $3.9 million con
tract.
Cubs' shortstop Shawon Dunston will
rip the webbing out of a dozen of first
baseman Mark Grace's gloves. Dunston
has the best arm on the planet, maybe
even better than Garry Templeton's was
in his prime. Tempy's is still one of the
best in the league, by the way.
Okay, okay, I'll tell you before the
suspense drives you to rummage around
for your Elias book. Fletcher is the Texas
Rangers' shortstop.

Nineteen-year old Ken Griffey Jr. will
be the best rookie in the majors but won't
be able to take the toast at the awards
ceremony. They'll give him a glass of
sparkling cider.
The Cardinals will lose more man
games to injury than any team in the
league. Fortunately for Whitey Herzog,
his hair is already all white.
Nolan Ryan will not lead the American
League in K's. But he'll again have more
than any pitcher in the senior circuit.
The Twins continue to shuttle right
fielders in and out of the lineup trying
to fill the void created by the bonehead

trade of Tom Brunansky.
George Bell will keep his mouth shut.
National League umpire Eric Gregg
will defeat the Phillie Phanatic in the
race for the 400-pound barrier.
Roger Craig proves his true genius as
the Giants finish a distant fourth in the
N. L. West pennant race.
Wade Boggs will miss six weeks because
of a groin pull.
Margo Adams surfaces in Tinseltown;
her new target is squeaky clean Orel
Hershisher.
Many an American Leaguer looks silly
trying to chase down Charlie Hough's
knuckle ball after facing the Ryan Ex
press the day before.
Minnesota's Kirby Puckett proves that
Strawberry shouldn't have let his hair
grow out.
Sparky Anderson will again have his
Detroit Journeymen in the pennant race,
somehow.
Cincinnati's Eric Davis will create the
50-50 club and still will be criticized for
