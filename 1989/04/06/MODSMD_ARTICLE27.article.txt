# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
While the rest of you were out in Hawaii,
San Diego or the Bahamas getting tan over
spring break, Stanford's varsity athletes had
no opportunity for vacation.
Instead, they were out shooting hoops,
spiking volleyballs, vaulting high into the
air and the like. Two of the most noteworthy
of those performers were women's basket
ball's Jennifer Azzi and men's gymnastics'
Conrad Voorsanger.

Azzi, a 5-foot-9 junior from Oak Ridge,
Tenn., almost carried her squad into the
Final Four with a scintillating performance
in the Midwest Regional final against Lou
isiana Tech in Ruston, La.
Stanford's shooting guard scored 30 points
despite being hampered by foul trouble. She
was the Cardinal's only consistent offensive
weapon in attacking the Lady Techsters.
Actually, unstoppable is probably a better
adjective. Azzi was 11-of-17 from the field,
including 4-of-5 from 3-point land. She made
four free throws as well.
Azzi was honored for her stellar perform
ance this year by being named to Kodak's
All-America team. She was the only junior
on the 10-member squad.
The women's basketball team finished its
most successful season ever with a 28-3
record.

Voorsanger, a 5-5 junior from San Rafael,
Calif., was outstanding at the Pacific 10
Conference Championships held in Califor
nia's Harmon Gym.
Voorsanger captured the individual all
around title with a score of 111.70. He was
also first in the parallel bars with a score
of 9.80, two-tenths ahead of teammate Scott
Schaffer.
But Voorsanger wasn't through. He also
tied UCLA's Chris Walker for first in the
high bar with a score of 9.80. In that event,
he twice executed his patented move — the
"Voorhanger" — which is performed by no

one else.
In the floor exercise, Voorsanger tied
UCLA's David St. Pierre for first with a
9.65. He finished sixth in the rings and the
vault.
At the meet, conference coaches voted him
Pac-10 Gymnast of the Year.
Voorsanger is a top contender for the in
dividual all-around title at the NCAA Cham
pionships in Lincoln, Neb. slated for April
14-16.
