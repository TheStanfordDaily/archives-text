# Sailors visit many ports

In what may be the busiest part
of its season, the Stanford sailing
team traveled to nearby Santa
Cruz, distant Los Angeles, and far
away Annapolis, Md. to challenge
some of the nation's best teams
in five important regattas.
Stanford returned from its
travels with a ninth place finish
at the Navy Women's Regatta, a
13th place finish at the Trux
Umsted Regatta, a second and
third in the regular-season North
Series, and a fifth at a South Se
ries event.
The Cardinal sailors' travels
began when the women's squad
headed East to compete in the
Navy event, which traditionally
draws the best women sailors
from around the country.
The Stanford team, previously
unranked, surprised more than a
few observers with high finishes
on the first day of racing, and a
top-10 overall record. For the
event, junior Kim Grose paired up
with senior Amy Baltzer, and
freshman Cathy Petzold sailed
with sophomore Katie Burke.
A week later, a larger contingent
of Stanford sailors descended on
Annapolis for the Trux Umsted
Regatta, the regular season's
most prestigious event. Twenty of
the nation's highest-ranked teams

competed in the four division
event, which was held in both two
person dinghies and singlehanded
boats.
Leading the Cardinal at the
Trux was sophomore Rick Rosen,
who sailed past most of D Division
to finish fourth, just two points
out of third. Sophomore Dave
Dowd and freshman Lydia Snape
also turned in a strong perform
ance, finishing 13th in B Division.
Seniors Ev Rend and Amy
Baltzer in A Division and junior
Robert Brown in C Division, along
with sophomores Matt Dunbar
and Rebecca Bryson, helped Stan
ford edge out seven teams by the
regatta'B end.
Closer to home, other Stanford
sailors were eryoying warmer tem
peratures in Santa Cruz, the site
of the third and fourth events of
the regular-season North Series.
There, sophomores Scott Dale,
Sue Kown, Brett Adams, and
junior Kathryn Haggitt teamed
up to keep the Cardinal in con
tention for the Series champion
ship.
According to Blake Middleton,
Stanford coach, the task ahead is
to match Irvine and go on to the
national championships.
"We have work to do before
we'll be ready, but with enough
dedication we should be able to
sail as well as any team in the
country," Middleton said.
