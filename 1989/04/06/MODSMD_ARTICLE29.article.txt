# Seniors stick together, swim Stanford to success

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. ~ A
funny thing about sports is that
only one team can win. 294 Di
vision I college basketball teams
play to crown one national cham
pion. 26 msyor league baseball
play for one World Series
title. And so on.
Of all the athletes competing
at various levels throughout the
world, only a very small number
go out on top. Dana Anderson,
Aiinee Berzins, Michelle Donahue,
Jenna Johnson and Susan Lenth
did.
Those five, all seniors, closed
out their collegiate careers by
leading Stanford to victory in the
1989 NCAA Women's Swimming
and Diving Championships in In
dianapolis, Ind. It was the Cardi
nal's first title in the sport since
1983 and, for the five seniors com
peting, well worth the four years
of work.
After coming in with a recruit
ing class numbering well into
double figures, only seven swim
mers began the year. A back in
jury to Bethanne Lambert kept
her from competing the final two
months of the season and Jenny
Shannon suffered a lacerated
finger that ended her season in
February.
"We're the survivors," Berzins
said. "It's been frustrating to see
my friends have to stop, because
of injuries or other things. ... I
think we all have something very
special now in common to hang
on to. To end with the champi
onship makes it satisfying to say
we stuck it out and hung with it
— and we did it."
Coach Richard Quick, who came
to Stanford in October after
coaching Texas to the last five
NCAA titles, feels this year's Car
dinal squad may not be the most
talented team around, but when
the chips were down, they came
through. The biggest part of that,
lie feels, is the closeness of the
team, exemplified by the seniors.

"I don't think there's a team
that can be successful without
outstanding senior leadership," he
said. "I really admire this group
because they really handled the
coaching change and they really
handled their senior year, which
is the last page in a chapter of
their life. I really admire that
commitment on their part."
Of the five seniors, Johnson was
perhaps the most valuable in the
pool, winning six individual
NCAA titles in her four years,
second on the Stanford all-time
list to Marybeth (Linzmeier)
Dorst's eight. She also was a key
relay swimmer, and served as co
captain this season.
"Jenna Johnson has been a
mainstay, just a tremendous
swimmer at Stanford, all four
years," Quick said.
"Jenna Johnson has been the
cornerstone of the Stanford team.
She swims three great individual
events and four tremendous relays
in every NCAA meet. She's called
on in every dual meet, in every
NCAA meet . . . and she responds
every time. Jenna will be ranked
with all the great swimmers in
Stanford history."
And out of the pool, Johnson
lived up to the standard she set
in the water. "She's so caring,"
Anderson said. "She's got time
for anyone. She's a great person
and a great swimmer."
Berzins was another key cog of
four Stanford relays, and one of
the Cardinal's top point-scorers
every year.
"Aimee Berzins will always be
real special to me," Quick said.
"Her senior year, she had the best
year of her swimming career. I
just have extreme admiration for
Aimee."
Donahue was also a top scorer
for the Cardinal in the backstroke
all four years.
"Michelle Donahue is one of the
hardest working and nicest girls
I've ever worked with," Quick
said. "Her quiet, solid leadership
will be sorely missed but at the
same time will be a standard for

others for a long time.
"Susan Lenth again had the
best year of her swimming
career," Quick continued. "She
did a lot more in and out of the
pool to lead this team to vic
tory. . . . Her swimming will be
missed but her character will be
missed more.

"Dana Anderson probably had
one of the toughest assignments
because her swimming was not
going as well as it had. But she
.. . was able to put her individual
results behind her and support
the team. I'll admire her for not
once bringing other people down
in any way."
Quick's special feelings toward
this class are shared by the swim
mers themselves.
"We have a bond that is so
close," Anderson said. "We came
in with a class of 15 and there
were only five of us left.... I feel
so close to all of them.
"When I first came here I
couldn't believe a team could care
so much. . . . Everyone is so sup
portive. Everyone cares for you
out of the pool.
"It was probably my toughest
yet most rewarding year. ... It
was definitely worth it. I'm so
glad I stuck it out."
Anderson, who, like Berzins and
Lenth, has retired from competi
tive swimming, is already looking
forward to the first reunion. "I
can't wait for that," she said,
"when you can really eryoy spend
ing time with them not as a swim
mer but as a person."
Lenth feels the same closeness.
"I'll have to admit it was probably
the best year of my career," she
said, "not just because we won,
but because of all the people. This
is the closest I've been to a team
in 11 years (of swimming).
"I'll remember being a captain
as the highlight of my swimming
career. It's a real honor for me to
be the leader of that type of
group."
The others will also have many
fond memories: cheering at the
top their lungs after winning the

title, Quick, Asst. Coach Mike
Chasson, former Coach George
Haines.
"I'm not going to miss the 6
a.m. workouts," Anderson said;
"I'm not going to miss the
stadiums. It's going to be being
with the people I'm closest to
here."
The five came to Stanford in
1985 wih dreams of winning a
national title someday. They al
most got their wish as sopho
mores, coming up a scant 17
points short.
"Sophomore year we just did
phenomenally well and surprised
ourselves," Berzins said. The fol
lowing year, however, the team

finished a disappointing third.
"After last year, having the
tools and the potential, it came
together this year," Berzins said.
"I think each year our desire grew
stronger. I think it accumulated
and finally this year it was re
leased.
"I guess not many people say
they've been able to achieve their
goals."
Card notes
A few Cardinal swimmers competed
in the U.S. Short Course nationals,
held in Chapel Hill, N.C. over spring
break. Freshman Dede Trimble won
the 200-yard backstroke in a career
best time and took fourth in the 100

backstroke. Freshman Eva Mortensen
also did well, reaching the finals of
both the 1000 and 1,650 freestyles,
recording a lifetime best in the latter.
The two freestyle events, and the
500 freestyle and the 400 individual
medley, were won by Janet Evans,
the top recruit in what Quick called
"the best (high school) senior class
ever." Swimming letters-of-intent may
be signed beginning April 12, and
Quick is hoping many of the top pros
pects will be wearing cardinal and
white next fall.
In addition to the Olympic triple
gold-medalist Evans, the class in
cludes three other U.S. Olympians.
Beth Barr competed in both the 100
and 200 backstrokes in Seoul.

Seniors Dana Anderson, Almee Berzlns, Michelle Donahue, Jenna Johnson and Susan Lenth receive

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. ~ A
funny thing about sports is that
only one team can win. 294 Di
vision I college basketball teams
play to crown one national cham
pion. 26 msyor league baseball
play for one World Series
title. And so on.
Of all the athletes competing
at various levels throughout the
world, only a very small number
go out on top. Dana Anderson,
Aiinee Berzins, Michelle Donahue,
Jenna Johnson and Susan Lenth
did.
Those five, all seniors, closed
out their collegiate careers by
leading Stanford to victory in the
1989 NCAA Women's Swimming
and Diving Championships in In
dianapolis, Ind. It was the Cardi
nal's first title in the sport since
1983 and, for the five seniors com
peting, well worth the four years
of work.
After coming in with a recruit
ing class numbering well into
double figures, only seven swim
mers began the year. A back in
jury to Bethanne Lambert kept
her from competing the final two
months of the season and Jenny
Shannon suffered a lacerated
finger that ended her season in
February.
"We're the survivors," Berzins
said. "It's been frustrating to see
my friends have to stop, because
of injuries or other things. ... I
think we all have something very
special now in common to hang
on to. To end with the champi
onship makes it satisfying to say
we stuck it out and hung with it
— and we did it."
Coach Richard Quick, who came
to Stanford in October after
coaching Texas to the last five
NCAA titles, feels this year's Car
dinal squad may not be the most
talented team around, but when
the chips were down, they came
through. The biggest part of that,
lie feels, is the closeness of the
team, exemplified by the seniors.

"I don't think there's a team
that can be successful without
outstanding senior leadership," he
said. "I really admire this group
because they really handled the
coaching change and they really
handled their senior year, which
is the last page in a chapter of
their life. I really admire that
commitment on their part."
Of the five seniors, Johnson was
perhaps the most valuable in the
pool, winning six individual
NCAA titles in her four years,
second on the Stanford all-time
list to Marybeth (Linzmeier)
Dorst's eight. She also was a key
relay swimmer, and served as co
captain this season.
"Jenna Johnson has been a
mainstay, just a tremendous
swimmer at Stanford, all four
years," Quick said.
"Jenna Johnson has been the
cornerstone of the Stanford team.
She swims three great individual
events and four tremendous relays
in every NCAA meet. She's called
on in every dual meet, in every
NCAA meet . . . and she responds
every time. Jenna will be ranked
with all the great swimmers in
Stanford history."
And out of the pool, Johnson
lived up to the standard she set
in the water. "She's so caring,"
Anderson said. "She's got time
for anyone. She's a great person
and a great swimmer."
Berzins was another key cog of
four Stanford relays, and one of
the Cardinal's top point-scorers
every year.
"Aimee Berzins will always be
real special to me," Quick said.
"Her senior year, she had the best
year of her swimming career. I
just have extreme admiration for
Aimee."
Donahue was also a top scorer
for the Cardinal in the backstroke
all four years.
"Michelle Donahue is one of the
hardest working and nicest girls
I've ever worked with," Quick
said. "Her quiet, solid leadership
will be sorely missed but at the
same time will be a standard for

others for a long time.
"Susan Lenth again had the
best year of her swimming
career," Quick continued. "She
did a lot more in and out of the
pool to lead this team to vic
tory. . . . Her swimming will be
missed but her character will be
missed more.

"Dana Anderson probably had
one of the toughest assignments
because her swimming was not
going as well as it had. But she
.. . was able to put her individual
results behind her and support
the team. I'll admire her for not
once bringing other people down
in any way."
Quick's special feelings toward
this class are shared by the swim
mers themselves.
"We have a bond that is so
close," Anderson said. "We came
in with a class of 15 and there
were only five of us left.... I feel
so close to all of them.
"When I first came here I
couldn't believe a team could care
so much. . . . Everyone is so sup
portive. Everyone cares for you
out of the pool.
"It was probably my toughest
yet most rewarding year. ... It
was definitely worth it. I'm so
glad I stuck it out."
Anderson, who, like Berzins and
Lenth, has retired from competi
tive swimming, is already looking
forward to the first reunion. "I
can't wait for that," she said,
"when you can really eryoy spend
ing time with them not as a swim
mer but as a person."
Lenth feels the same closeness.
"I'll have to admit it was probably
the best year of my career," she
said, "not just because we won,
but because of all the people. This
is the closest I've been to a team
in 11 years (of swimming).
"I'll remember being a captain
as the highlight of my swimming
career. It's a real honor for me to
be the leader of that type of
group."
The others will also have many
fond memories: cheering at the
top their lungs after winning the

title, Quick, Asst. Coach Mike
Chasson, former Coach George
Haines.
"I'm not going to miss the 6
a.m. workouts," Anderson said;
"I'm not going to miss the
stadiums. It's going to be being
with the people I'm closest to
here."
The five came to Stanford in
1985 wih dreams of winning a
national title someday. They al
most got their wish as sopho
mores, coming up a scant 17
points short.
"Sophomore year we just did
phenomenally well and surprised
ourselves," Berzins said. The fol
lowing year, however, the team

finished a disappointing third.
"After last year, having the
tools and the potential, it came
together this year," Berzins said.
"I think each year our desire grew
stronger. I think it accumulated
and finally this year it was re
leased.
"I guess not many people say
they've been able to achieve their
goals."

"Sophomore year we just did
phenomenally well and surprised
ourselves," Berzins said. The fol
lowing year, however, the team

finished a disappointing third.
"After last year, having the
tools and the potential, it came
together this year," Berzins said.
"I think each year our desire grew
stronger. I think it accumulated
and finally this year it was re
leased.
"I guess not many people say
they've been able to achieve their
goals."
Card notes
A few Cardinal swimmers competed
in the U.S. Short Course nationals,
held in Chapel Hill, N.C. over spring
break. Freshman Dede Trimble won
the 200-yard backstroke in a career
best time and took fourth in the 100

backstroke. Freshman Eva Mortensen
also did well, reaching the finals of
both the 1000 and 1,650 freestyles,
recording a lifetime best in the latter.
The two freestyle events, and the
500 freestyle and the 400 individual
medley, were won by Janet Evans,
the top recruit in what Quick called
"the best (high school) senior class
ever." Swimming letters-of-intent may
be signed beginning April 12, and
Quick is hoping many of the top pros
pects will be wearing cardinal and
white next fall.
In addition to the Olympic triple
gold-medalist Evans, the class in
cludes three other U.S. Olympians.
Beth Barr competed in both the 100
and 200 backstrokes in Seoul.
