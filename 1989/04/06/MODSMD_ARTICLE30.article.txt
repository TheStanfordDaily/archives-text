# Card second at Pac-10s, Voorsanger top performer
## 
### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
The Stanford men's gymnastics team
has a week to prepare for perfection.
The No. 3 Cardinal received high
marks for style and endurance at the
Pacific 10 Conference Championships
two weeks ago at Berkeley, continuing
to build on momentum it established
midway through the season. The peak
they must reach comes into sight next
week when the squad travels to Lincoln,
Neb. for the NCAA Championships.

Men's Gymnastics
Cardinal 2nd at Pac-10s

This will be the third time in the last
four years that Stanford enters the
championship meet as one of the
favorites. In 1986 and last year, it came
up short, finishing third and fourth,
respectively. Coach Sadao Hamada
hopes that the team's ongoing improve
ment and the recovery of co-captain
Adam Forman from injury means the
Cardinal will be at its best at the
NCAAs.
The gymnasts were close to their best
at the Pac-lOs, which were held at Har

moil Arena, March 24 and 25. As it had
done twice already this season against
Stanford, the No. 1 UCLA Bruins saved
their best for last and won 282.05-281
with a clutch performance on the final
event. The rest of the conference teams
were also-rans, as Arizona State took
third place, four points behind the Car
dinal.
Junior Conrad Voorsanger gave an
astounding performance over the two
day competition, winning the all-around
title Friday night and three event finals
on Saturday. For these accomplishments
and his excellence throughout the
season, Voorsanger was named Pac-10
Gymnast of the Year.
Highlighting Voorsanger's perform
ance, besides the repeated misspelling
of his name on the arena's scoreboard,
was the execution of his patented high
bar release move, the Voorhanger.
This complicated and inexplicable
trick — at one point Voorsanger is about
15 feet off the floor, parallel to the
ground, and looking up at the ceiling
— is so risky that Voorsanger had at
tempted it only once in competition this
season before the conference champion
ships.
"I hit the Voorhanger twice, which is
miraculous — that's history right

there," Voorsanger said.
Stanford showed strength throughout
its lineup, with four other gymnasts
qualifying for event finals.
Junior Charles Loop finished fourth
in the all-around standings and reached
three event finals, taking second place
on the rings. Senior Scott Schaffer
finished second in the parallel bars and
then third in the vault. According to
Hamada, the judges made a major error
in scoring SchafTer's vault which should
have earned first place.
Stanford's Tim Ryan, arguably the
nation's top freshman, qualified for
three event finals, but was unable to
compete during the meet's second day
of competition after he sprained his
ankle during warm-ups. Sophomore Tim
Wang qualified for the high bar finals,
but also had to drop out because of an
injury.
Despite the Pac-10 success, Hamada
is not content: "(We must) eliminate all
minor deductions ... we cannot make
any mistakes (at NCAAs). Hamada is
also relying on the recovery ability of
Forman, Ryan and Wang. Although
none of them is at full strength right
now, Hamada believes he can count on
each gymnast to be ready for the na
tional championships.
