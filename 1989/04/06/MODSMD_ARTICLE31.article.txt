# Three on All-Region Soccer Team
## 
### 
Maybe the biggest turn
around by a Stanford athle
tic team this past year was
that of the women's soccer
team, which ended the
season ranked No. 17 na
tionally and improved their
record by nine wins over last
year's 4-11-4 record, to 13-
4-2.
Three of the players from
this young talented group
have been honored by selec
tion to the All-Far West
Team, equivalent to an all
conference team: sophomore
forward Jennifer Rowland,
sophomore goalkeeper Elise
Edwards and freshman
sweeper Heather Mclntyre.
Mclntyre started at
sweeper for the Cardinal
after spending two years on
the United States Junior
National team. She scored
two goals on the season
while anchoring a solid Stan
ford defense.
Edwards, an All-America
candidate, compiled an in
credible 0.56 goals against
average, allowing only 11
goals in 19 games, with 149
saves and 12 shut-outs.
Rowland, tabbed with the
nickname "Rocket" because
of her quickness, scored a
team-high nine goals and
ranked second on the squad
in assists, with four.
