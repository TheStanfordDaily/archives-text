# Rowers hang with Eastern teams
## 
### Andrew Wilcox Staff writer 
In the season opener for the
women's and men's varsity crew
teams, the varsity "eight" boats
finished sixth and seventh respec
tively at San Diego's Mission Bay
last weekend in the San Diego
Crew Classic.
The regatta was Stanford's first
regulation-distance 2,000 meter
race and pitted the Cardinal crews
against perennial eastern powers
as well as West Coast teams.
The women's varsity eight boat,
with eight team members, was
victimized in the final race when
they were placed in the outside
lane, where rowing conditions
presented the Stanford boat with
a disadvantage. After breaking out
to an early lead in the race, the
women's boat slowed to finish at
the back of the pack in the six
team final.
The race ended in thrilling fash
ion with only about 10 seconds

separating the first- and sixth
place boats, Washington find Stan
ford. UCLA edged out the
Cardinal boat by a scant one sec
ond for the fifth position.
Coach John Davis of the wom
en's team said that although the
outside lane placement was not
an excuse for the low finish in
the final, it did alter the Stanford
strategy.
"We decided we'd have to get
an early lead and try to hang on
in order to minimize the disad
vantage," Davis said.
The plan worked at first but
because of the conditions and the
speed of the other boats, the Car
dinal was unable to hold on. Davis
added that the varsity eight did
not row as controlled a race as
they did in the qualifying heat,
in which they finished with the
third-fastest tini3 of all the boats.
In spite of the results, Davis
was optimistic about the team's
performance. "The kids had a
great race," Davis said. "It's nice

to be able to lead those teams and
it's nice to be back up here among
the elite.
"It's great to be able to knock
heads with the national powers
like Washington and Yale."
Junior Diana Olson said, "We
were disappointed with sixth but
we rowed a good race and did well
as a boat. At this point we are
inexperienced but I think a few
more races together will help."
On the men's side, the varsity
eight failed to qualify for the six
team final, finishing a disappoint
ing fourth in their qualifying heat.
However, the Cardinal men sal
vaged seventh place by winning
the petite final, which is similar
to a consolation race. It is com
posed of teams missing out on
the top six.
Men's varsity eight rower Mar
tin Lowenfish said that the team
was disappointed with the
seventh-place finish as the Stan
ford eight had "at least wanted
to make the finals."
