# INTERMISSION
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY Hot Stuff 
### 
So much to d 0....
If Dead Week has an opposite, this is it. Quickly now,
let's run down the things to do this week, starting with
the incredible
Obo Addy 8c Knkrudu. This Ghanaian drummer (shown
in above photo) and his nine-piece band perform African
music and jazz on Saturday at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
auditorium.
Addy draws his music from his own people, the Ga, as
well as the Ewe, Fanti, Dagomba and Kankomba cultures.
The band combines native African music with elements of
funk, reggae and jazz fusion. Unfortunately, the concert is
sold out, although you can catch Obo Addy in a
Free Lecture/Demonstration on Friday at 7:30 p.m. in
Dink. Of course, Fnday at the same time you can see....
The World Music of Do'ah. This group breaks new
ground by playing over seventy instruments in a diverse
display of musical styles. They earned recognition by the
United Nations for their highly successful "Peace Tour" of
the United States and Canada. Tickets are $5 and available
at BASS or at the door. If you'd rather spend your $5
dancing, try the
ARIS Project Aids Benefit Dance. Co-sponsored by
GLAS, this dance will take place on Sunday from 9 p.m.
- 2 a.m. at the Vortex in Palo Alto. For more information
about the dance call the Vortex at 324-1402, or the ARIS
Project at (408) 370-3272. But what to do Saturday afternoon?
Of course, it's—
Rinc A Delt '89, featunng Theloruous Monster opening
for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. You remember the Chili
Peppers — they're the ones who tore apart Mem Aud four
years ago in their last campus appearance. Well they're
back, but luckily it's hard to tear Frost Ampitheatre apart.
Admission is free with your Stanford I.D. card (no room
keys). Doors open at 12:30 and the show starts at 1:00.
Remember, though, many campus events aren't free, 50....
Buy your tickets now for Jay Leno (Apnl 30), The
Grateful Dead (May 6 & 7), the incredible Swiss mime
troupe Mummenschanz (April 27 at the Flint Center in
Cupertino) and Wynton Marsalis (May 14). Tickets for all
these shows are available at the Tresidder ticket office.
