# It's pretty, but is it art?
## Author Tama Janowitz and director James Ivory discuss making the film version of Janowitz's odd kitschy 'Slaves of New York' 
### Mark Tompkins Editorial staff 
Tama Janowitz and lames Ivory
make a classic odd couple.
Janowitz's rep is based on "Slaves
of New York," her collection of
short stories chronicling the trendy
art world of mid-'Bos New York,
and her presence at numerous
gallery openings and fashion
shows, not to mention her
Amaretto ads and David Letter
man appearances, has given her
lots of ink in People magazine.
She also made an MTV-style
video to promote "Slaves." That's
right, a video. What this has to do
with literary merit is anyone's
guess, but Janowitz is apparently
bent on following in the footsteps
of her one-time patron, the late
Andy Warhol (who at least hyped
himself with a bit of humor).
James Ivory is the directing half
of Merchant-Ivory, the filmmaking
team responsible for such ac
claimed coffce table movies as
"Room With A View," "Maurice"
and"The Bostonians." These big
screen versions of "Masterpiece
Theatre" have prestige written all
over them; maybe that's why I'd
always assumed that Ivory was
Bntish.

It turns out he was born in
Berkeley. Given his penchant for
E.M. Forster and Henry James,
Ivory is the last director I would've
guessed would do an adaptation of
Janowitz's stories.
It was a delight to see Ivory and
Janowitz when they came to San
Francisco to promote "Slaves,"
since they both looked exactly how
you'd expect them to look — that
is, they seemed to embody their
artistic sensibilities. Janowitz wore
a Day-Glo designer outfit, bright
red stockings, fuddy-duddy librar
ians' glasses, and of course, it was
all topped off by that massive mop
of black hair.
Ivory looked like he should be
leading tutorials at Oxford: white
hair, bow tie, striped shin and a
cream jacket — if you looked up
the word "patrician" in the diction
ary, you'd probably find a picture
of James Ivory.
Ivory was dignified, amiable and
witty, while Janowitz — under
standably exhausted by a
whirlwind publicity tour — didn't
seem delighted to be answering
questions, especially about herself.
It was like watching the shyest girl
in the seventh grade being made
to bare her soul in front of the
class. She relaxed visibly whenever

questions were directed at Ivory.
With the death of Andy Warhol
— and after the publication of "A
Cannibal In Manhattan" — it re
mains to be seen whether there's
anyone left on the planet who will
say nice things about Janowitz's
fiction, but Ivory is quite happy
with her screenplay for "Slaves,"
while she's clearly delighted with
the way he's directed it.

Andy Warhol originally owned
the film rights to some of the
short stories in "Slaves of New
York." How do you think the
movie would've been different if
he had lived to film it?
IVORY: I'm interested in that,
too. (Turns to Janowitz)
JANOWITZ: I never really
found out what he intended to do,
whether he was going to direct or
produce, turn it over to Hollywood,
or give it to another director. I
never found out what he had
planned for it. But I think he would
have loved it, as it is.

How did you feel when you
learned that James Ivory was
going to do it?
IVORY: MustVe been a shock —
JANOWITZ: Andy bought those
stories when they came out in The
New Yorker. I was thrilled — we'd
gotten to be friends by that point,
and I was very touched. It was the
first film he'd planned to make
since "Bad" in 1977. In fact, I'd
always loved those early Warhol
movies like "Trash" and "Heat,"
they were very funny. And he kept
asking me to write the screenplay,
which I didn't really want to do,
but I did it. It was a very rough
draft. And I was happy I did it in
the end, because he died not long
after that, and I felt like at least
I was able to give him what he
had wanted before his death.
And when it looked like Jim
(Ivory) was interested, I was totally
thrilled, because I had always ad
mired his films too, and I was
thrilled that maybe I could work
with him. These guys are artists,
and they were interested in what
I had to say.
I'm a fiction writer. If I were to
write another screenplay, it would
only be with Jim and Ismail (Mer
chant, producer). I think that in
writing for the movies, writers just
get swallowed up. They're consid
ered to be the lowest person on
the totem pole. They get you in
there with a bunch of businessmen
saying, "Do this, do that. We have
to reach the 18-year-old market,
so put in some teen sex." Then
you hand in the script and they
get someone else to re-do it.
Have you seen any of the
reviews?
IVORY: Oh, have we not. It
seems like they're out to tar and
feather us all. There's no way to
know what they're thinking. I've
got nothing against critics in par
ticular. I have no grounds to com
plain — over the past 20 years, I
mean, my goodness, they've cer
tainly supported me. In this in

stance, they got so shrill — we
must have gotten under their skin
in some way.
This might be something that
Tama is more familiar with than
you.
IVORY: Exactly. There was this
awful review that came in Time
magazine, and I called her up and
said, "Listen to this." And she said,
"Jim, that's good."
Is there anyone in the movie
who's not a slave to something
or other?
JANOWITZ: I don't know, is
there anybody in life who's not —
IVORY: All these people are
slaves not only to apartments and
relationships they don't like, but
also slaves just to the city itself.
These people chose to live in New
York, for better or worse. You do
have a kind of enslaved mentality
after a while if you stay in New
York. You think, "I can't stand
this another day, why am I here?
There are so many nice places in
the world, why am I here?" I've
been asking myself that now for
10 years at least.
JANOWITZ: I think that just
being a human being is a condition
of entrapment. You can't escape
from everything that you've been
brought up as, ways of behavior,
and everything you've been trained
to think. You're stuck in it.
You filmed over the past year.
I wondered what you made of
some of the things that were
going on in the Lower East Side,
like the riot in Tompkins Square
Park.
(Janowitz shrugs, turns to Ivory)
IVORY: That happened after we
were there. We shot in Tompkins
Square Park in early summer, and
the riot happened in August. I
thought that was a creepy place, I
didn't like it at all. I felt uncom
fortable in there at all times. I saw
horrible things there.
There was a woman lying on a
park bench that they thought was
dead, and the police put on these
rubber gloves just to touch her, to
see if she was dead. They didn't
want even to touch her with their
bare hands. And they poked her,
and she stood up — and she was
mostly naked, all she had was this

coat and this sort of rag under
neath — and wandered off.
We saw so many things like that,
in those two days that we were
there. That was the only place
where I really felt uncomfortable.
What attracted you to this ma
terial? You've filmed Indian so
ciety, Victorian society, and now
a sort of underground New York
art society.
IVORY: Oh, I think they're
related. There are all these stric
tures on people, what they can do,
and taboos, hypocrisy and a sort
of caste system.
What kind of reaction have you
gotten from people in that art
world?
JANOWITZ: At one screening
there was a famous artist sitting
behind me and he kept muttering
under his breath, "Oh no, this is
too much like life." And afterward
he came up to me and said, "Oh
God, I'm so embarrassed to be an
artist now."
The Dalmatian you used in the
film was a real discovery.
IVORY: That was a great dog.
I've always felt that my films
lacked dogs. We made all those
films about English country
houses ... now in English country
houses, there's always some
mangy dog bounding around, and
we never could afford to have one
before.
Some of the artwork in the film
takes cartoon characters and uses
them in different ways. Did you
have to get permission to use
those characters?
IVORY: We couldn't use the
Donald Duck characters, or Dud
ley Do-right. We were able to use
Popeye only after tremendous
kinds of negotiating and making
promises. We had to show xeroxes
of the pictures on the wall so that
Popeye and Olive Oyl would never
be shown in a bad way.
We did this version of Manet's
"Olympia" in which Olive Oyl was
lying there nude, and we had to
show this to these people at King
Features. And they just said that
this was pornographic and disgust
ing, and of course we couldn't do
it, they would never give permis
sion.
