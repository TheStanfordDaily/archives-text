# It's pretty, but is it art?
## Author Tama Janowitz and director James Ivory discuss making the film version of Janowitz's odd kitschy 'Slaves of New York' 
### Mark Tompkins Editorial staff 
Tama Janowitz and lames Ivory
make a classic odd couple.
Janowitz's rep is based on "Slaves
of New York," her collection of
short stories chronicling the trendy
art world of mid-'Bos New York,
and her presence at numerous
gallery openings and fashion
shows, not to mention her
Amaretto ads and David Letter
man appearances, has given her
lots of ink in People magazine.
She also made an MTV-style
video to promote "Slaves." That's
right, a video. What this has to do
with literary merit is anyone's
guess, but Janowitz is apparently
bent on following in the footsteps
of her one-time patron, the late
Andy Warhol (who at least hyped
himself with a bit of humor).
James Ivory is the directing half
of Merchant-Ivory, the filmmaking
team responsible for such ac
claimed coffce table movies as
"Room With A View," "Maurice"
and"The Bostonians." These big
screen versions of "Masterpiece
Theatre" have prestige written all
over them; maybe that's why I'd
always assumed that Ivory was
Bntish.

It turns out he was born in
Berkeley. Given his penchant for
E.M. Forster and Henry James,
Ivory is the last director I would've
guessed would do an adaptation of
Janowitz's stories.
It was a delight to see Ivory and
Janowitz when they came to San
Francisco to promote "Slaves,"
since they both looked exactly how
you'd expect them to look — that
is, they seemed to embody their
artistic sensibilities. Janowitz wore
a Day-Glo designer outfit, bright
red stockings, fuddy-duddy librar
ians' glasses, and of course, it was
all topped off by that massive mop
of black hair.
Ivory looked like he should be
leading tutorials at Oxford: white
hair, bow tie, striped shin and a
cream jacket — if you looked up
the word "patrician" in the diction
ary, you'd probably find a picture
of James Ivory.
Ivory was dignified, amiable and
witty, while Janowitz — under
standably exhausted by a
whirlwind publicity tour — didn't
seem delighted to be answering
questions, especially about herself.
It was like watching the shyest girl
in the seventh grade being made
to bare her soul in front of the
class. She relaxed visibly whenever

questions were directed at Ivory.
With the death of Andy Warhol
— and after the publication of "A
Cannibal In Manhattan" — it re
mains to be seen whether there's
anyone left on the planet who will
say nice things about Janowitz's
fiction, but Ivory is quite happy
with her screenplay for "Slaves,"
while she's clearly delighted with
the way he's directed it.

Andy Warhol originally owned
the film rights to some of the
short stories in "Slaves of New
York." How do you think the
movie would've been different if
he had lived to film it?
IVORY: I'm interested in that,
too. (Turns to Janowitz)
JANOWITZ: I never really
found out what he intended to do,
whether he was going to direct or
produce, turn it over to Hollywood,
or give it to another director. I
never found out what he had
planned for it. But I think he would
have loved it, as it is.
