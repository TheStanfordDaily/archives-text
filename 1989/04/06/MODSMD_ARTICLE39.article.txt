# Getting a summer job is easy, especially if you don't need to eat
## 
### 
It's springtime again! And with the
blooming flowers and hot weather comes
the college students' national pastime —
job hunting. Time to dust off the ol'
resume and head out into the real world
looking for gainful summer employment.
But before we start, let's repeat the
Golden Rule of Summer Job Hunting:
"There are 2.6 million college students
nationwide who are applying for approx
imately 17 job openings."
This, as you might well imagine, makes
finding a job a bit challenging. However,
there is still hope. Let's take a detailed
look at the five steps in acquiring a sum
mer job, which are:
1. Identify place you would like to work.
2. Send a resume and cover letter.
3. Interview.
4. Wait.
5. Work at McDonalds.
Identify place you would like to work.
To do this you snould contact the CPPC
(Clearinghouse of Paltry Paying Careers),
and check out "Odyssey," the on-line
database of internships whose deadlines
were last October.
While looking for jobs you will have to

decide whether you are looking for "in
come" or "experience." Most career coun
selors recommend working for
"experience," although most career coun
selors have plenty of "money" and don't
have to worry about the fact that "expe
rience" cannot be used to pay for "food."
Send a resume and cover letter. One
frequently asked question is "Should I in
clude ALL my experiences on a resume?"
The answer, of course, is no. You should
include only those experiences which are
directly relevant to the job you are applying
for, whether or not you have actually had
them.
For instance, even if you're making it
up, "Piloted the space shuttle," is far more
impressive than "Waited tables." It's not
like you're going to have to PROVE that
you piloted the space shuttle. How many
companies are willing to actually whip
out a space shuttle during your interview
and say "OK, wise guy, show me you can
pilot this sucker!"
It is also important to include a cover
letter indicating your interest in the com
pany and to point out any relevant facts
not covered in your resume, i.e., when
you will be eligible for parole.
Because employers read dozens, perhaps

hundreds of applications for a single job
opening, yours must be short, to the point,
and offer that employer an incentive to
hire you. Here's a good sample cover letter:
Dear Sir or Madam:
I would like to apply for a position with
your company for the summer of 1989.
I feel that my qualifications as indicated
by the enclosed resume make me a prime
candidate for employment.
By the way, I was the one who kid
napped your daughter. I know you would
like to see her alive, but please don't let
that have any bearing on your decision
as to whether to hire me.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Interview. The interview is often the
crucial step in nailing down that job. A
good interview can sometimes tip the
scales in your favor, while a bad interview
can potentially embarrass you to the point
of throwing yourself underneath a bus.
You must be wary, however, because
employers will often try to downplay the
importance of the interview, saying things
like "We just want to have a chance to
get to know you." Yeah, right. If they just
wanted to get to know you they would
take you out for dinner and a movie in
stead of surrounding you at a conference

table and asking you questions like: "Tell
us about the Smurf you have tattooed on
your buttocks."
But no matter what questions you are
asked in an interview, your prospective
employer is really only looking for the
answers to three fundamental questions:
1. Are you qualified for the job?
2. Will you work hard for the company?
3. How often do you murder nuns with
a chain saw?
Students new to interviews often wonder

how much they should talk in an inter
view. As a general rule, you should listen
for at least 50 percent of the time and
talk for no more than the other 50 percent
of the time. (If you have a split personality
each should speak for 25 percent of the
time.) In addition, employers are usually
looking for students who will be aggres
sive, so don't hesitate to punch your in
terviewer in the nose as many times as
are necessary to put forth a good impres
sion.
What to wear? For men, a tie is essen
tial. In fact, a good power-tie is usually
ALL you need to wear. Women should
wear a "suit," which is actually a dress.
Women should not wear a "pantsuit," be
cause it is a silly word.
During the interview you should be sure
to call attention to your sartorial splcn
difcrousncss. ("Hey Mr. Interviewer, get a
load of my sartorial splendifcrousncss!")
Most importantly, after your interview
you MUST sit down and wnte thank you
notes to everyone you spoke with. These
notes need not be lengthy:
Dear Interviewer:
Thank you for taking the time to meet
with me today. I hope your nose does not
require plastic surgery.

the college students' national pastime —
job hunting. Time to dust off the ol'
resume and head out into the real world
looking for gainful summer employment.
But before we start, let's repeat the
Golden Rule of Summer Job Hunting:
"There are 2.6 million college students
nationwide who are applying for approx
imately 17 job openings."
This, as you might well imagine, makes
finding a job a bit challenging. However,
there is still hope. Let's take a detailed
look at the five steps in acquiring a sum
mer job, which are:
1. Identify place you would like to work.
2. Send a resume and cover letter.
3. Interview.
4. Wait.
5. Work at McDonalds.
Identify place you would like to work.
To do this you snould contact the CPPC
(Clearinghouse of Paltry Paying Careers),
and check out "Odyssey," the on-line
database of internships whose deadlines
were last October.
While looking for jobs you will have to

decide whether you are looking for "in
come" or "experience." Most career coun
selors recommend working for
"experience," although most career coun
selors have plenty of "money" and don't
have to worry about the fact that "expe
rience" cannot be used to pay for "food."
Send a resume and cover letter. One
frequently asked question is "Should I in
clude ALL my experiences on a resume?"
The answer, of course, is no. You should
include only those experiences which are
directly relevant to the job you are applying
for, whether or not you have actually had
them.
For instance, even if you're making it
up, "Piloted the space shuttle," is far more
impressive than "Waited tables." It's not
like you're going to have to PROVE that
you piloted the space shuttle. How many
companies are willing to actually whip
out a space shuttle during your interview
and say "OK, wise guy, show me you can
pilot this sucker!"
It is also important to include a cover
letter indicating your interest in the com
pany and to point out any relevant facts
not covered in your resume, i.e., when
you will be eligible for parole.
Because employers read dozens, perhaps

hundreds of applications for a single job
opening, yours must be short, to the point,
and offer that employer an incentive to
hire you. Here's a good sample cover letter:
Dear Sir or Madam:
I would like to apply for a position with
your company for the summer of 1989.
I feel that my qualifications as indicated
by the enclosed resume make me a prime
candidate for employment.
By the way, I was the one who kid
napped your daughter. I know you would
like to see her alive, but please don't let
that have any bearing on your decision
as to whether to hire me.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Interview. The interview is often the
crucial step in nailing down that job. A
good interview can sometimes tip the
scales in your favor, while a bad interview
can potentially embarrass you to the point
of throwing yourself underneath a bus.
You must be wary, however, because
employers will often try to downplay the
importance of the interview, saying things
like "We just want to have a chance to
get to know you." Yeah, right. If they just
wanted to get to know you they would
take you out for dinner and a movie in
stead of surrounding you at a conference

table and asking you questions like: "Tell
us about the Smurf you have tattooed on
your buttocks."
But no matter what questions you are
asked in an interview, your prospective
employer is really only looking for the
answers to three fundamental questions:
1. Are you qualified for the job?
2. Will you work hard for the company?
3. How often do you murder nuns with
a chain saw?
Students new to interviews often wonder

how much they should talk in an inter
view. As a general rule, you should listen
for at least 50 percent of the time and
talk for no more than the other 50 percent
of the time. (If you have a split personality
each should speak for 25 percent of the
time.) In addition, employers are usually
looking for students who will be aggres
sive, so don't hesitate to punch your in
terviewer in the nose as many times as
are necessary to put forth a good impres
sion.
What to wear? For men, a tie is essen
tial. In fact, a good power-tie is usually
ALL you need to wear. Women should
wear a "suit," which is actually a dress.
Women should not wear a "pantsuit," be
cause it is a silly word.
During the interview you should be sure
to call attention to your sartorial splcn
difcrousncss. ("Hey Mr. Interviewer, get a
load of my sartorial splendifcrousncss!")
Most importantly, after your interview
you MUST sit down and wnte thank you
notes to everyone you spoke with. These
notes need not be lengthy:
Dear Interviewer:
Thank you for taking the time to meet
with me today. I hope your nose does not
require plastic surgery.
