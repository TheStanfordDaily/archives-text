# Summer unit requirement drops from 8 to 3

### Alex Camacho 
In an effort to attract more under
graduates to Stanford's summer ses
sion and to reduce their financial bur
den, the University has lowered the
minimum summer unit requirement
from eight to three.
"The eight unit minimum require
ment was a barrier because it meant
students basically had to be rich or
had to use one of their quarters of
financial aid," said Andrew Lisac, as
sistant director of the summer session
The Committee of Administrative
Deans for Undergraduate Studies,

formed by Provost James Rosse in
1987, "began to discuss how best to
serve that large number of undergrad
uates who are on campus working in
the summer" but not taking classes,
Lisac said.
The committee later concluded that
a lower unit requirement would make
summer session more financially ac
cessible to Stanford undergraduates
and allow more working students to
take classes.
The eight-unit minimum remains
for visiting undergraduates, and a 10-
unit minimum still exists for the sum
mer program for high school students.

The three-unit tuition cost for this
summer is $1,032, while eight units
cost $2,347.
The tuition change will help students
taking a lighter course load, but the
Financial Aids Office has not followed
the example and implemented a similar
type of change. As always, financial
aid is based on three quarters of en
rollment per year, and Stanford stu
dents may substitute summer quarter
for quarters during the regular school
year.
There is a 12-unit minimum for
scholarships, eight for grants and some

loans, three for a Perkins Loan and
student jobs. Students need to notify
the Financial Aids Office of their plans
well in advance.
Information oa registration, finan
cial aid and housing may be found in
the University Bulletin for summer
session 1 ยง88-89, available at the Old
Union information window.
There has been a steep decline in
the number of matriculated students
enrolled in summer session. Only 271
Stanford undergraduates attended
classes here last summer, down from
432 enrolled six years earlier.
