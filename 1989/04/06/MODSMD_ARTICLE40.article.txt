# The
						final verdict: It's not art
## 
### Mark Tompkins Editorial staff 
"Slaves of New York" is an enervating bore.
Based on Tama Janowitz's bestselling collection
of short stories, the film portrays New York's
downtown art scene as one big parade of
egomaniacs struggling to get a gallery show and
a better apartment.
But Eleanor (Bernadette Peters), a hat designer,
wants something more: a decent relationship. Her
current boyfriend, an artist named Stash (Adam
Coleman Howard) insults her constantly, but poor
whiny Eleanor keeps hanging in there.
Most of these downtown artists specialize in
the trendiest sort of neo-Pop imaginable. Within
the first 10 minutes of the movie we see that
most of them are as crass and driven to succced

as the most heartless corporate headhunter. But
not much more happens.
They flirt with each other, bicker, whine and
go to a lot of flashy nightclubs. Who cares? A
whopping 125 minutes is far too much time to
spend with these people.
The film is overloaded with set decorations and
costumes chosen for their wink-wink, isn't-this
kitschy? aesthetic. Janowitz and director James
Ivory seem to have forgotten the basic rule that
a story about empty, vapid people doesn't neces
sarily have to be empty or vapid itself. Janowitz's
one great accomplishment isn't her fiction, it's
her hairstyle; that's what Ivory should have made
a movie about.

"Slaves of New York" starts Friday at the Guild
theater in Menlo Park.
