# Too Much Joy's Tim Quirk talks about rock n' roll after Stanford
## 
### Matthew Marx Staff writer 
Let's have a show of hands on
this one: Would you shell out $10
for an album by a group of Ivy-
League-caliber-school gradst No
takers! Well, think again, because
Too Much Joy fit that description
— and they rock.
Too Much Joy consists of singer
and Stanford grad Tim Quirk, Yale
University alum/bassist Sandy
Smallens, guitarist and former
Weenie (you know where he went)
Jay Blumenfeld and drummer
Tommy Vinton, who went to lona.
Recently Quirk took time out to
talk to Intermission about the
band, Stanford, life and the rela
tionship of self-interest and the
common good in Mote's "Utopia."
(OK, maybe not the last one.):
Your bandmates are from UC-
Bcrkcley, Yale and Iona? How did
the four of you get together?
We all grew up together and
went to high school in Scarsdale,
N.Y. At that time we were sort of
outcasts and misfits, so we started
a band and played school dances
and stuff.
We had sort of a split-up when
we all went to college, but when
we graduated we didn't want to
lead real lives. So we all got back
together and did some touring in
California. We got in the habit of
passing out copies of our album,
and a friend of a friend of a friend
of the bass player talked about this
new company, Alias Records. They
Signed us.
When you came to Stanford
what were your plans? Did your
major relate to music?
I didn't know what I wanted. I
majored in communications with
a concentration in film. Oh, by
the way, did I tell you about pissing
on the roof of The Daily?
Well, not really. What hap
pened?

Well, I used to work for the
Chaparral, but there's no
bathrooms in the Chappie office
... so we got mad and decided
we'd piss on the roof of The Daily.
They got pissed at us when we
pissed on them, and threatened to
do an article about it, so we did
a parody of The Daily.
Also, the Chappie always ran a
joke platform in the ASSU elec
tions, and that was the year every
one was really fed up with the
ASSU — so they voted for us. We
weren't planning on it at all, but
I was co-president of the ASSU for
'85-86.
I guess you'd say the Chaparral
influenced you a bit. Was the idea
of the band to be some type of
"Nerd Rockers"?
Nah, we don't take ourselves too
seriously. We're just a bunch of
tough guys who want to be literate.
Is this a full-time thing or do
you all have real jobs?
We're about to tour, so we don't
hold jobs except now and then to
make money so we can buy equip
ment. I've been doing some writing
for Nickelodeon, a cable channcl
— some screenplays and stuff.
When the money runs out, we
tour.
What's meant by the title of
your album "Son of Sam I Am"?
We're a bunch of white, middle
class kids; we read Dr. Seuss and
stuff like that. So we're satirizing
that. Maybe we're too white for
our own good. The title "Son of
Sam I Am" is sort of a follow-up
to our last album, "Green Eggs
and Crack." You know, you can
be literate and read Dr. Seuss. They
ought to put Dr. Seuss in Western
Culture.
You know they're trashing
Western Culture this year in favor
of CIV.
Yeah, that's sort of ironic. The

funny part is that in the '60s the
radicals demanded Western Cul
ture because we weren't learning
enough about our own culture, and
now they want to get rid of it for
the opposite reason.
Back to your music. You pull
a unique trick in covering an L.L.
Cool J. song "It's A lie." That's
sort of different, a rock band
covering a rap tune. Why did you
choose to?
Well, the bass player likes rap
music, and whenever we're on the
road and it's his turn to play a
tape, he plays rap. "It's A Lie" is
at least lyrically the type of song
we like to write — pretty silly and
obnoxious. So we used his lyrics,
wrote a melody and developed our
own instrumentation.
Rumor has it that "Kicking'' is
going to be the big single off the
album. Any comment?
It's a song about a guy who's
trying to deal with cancer. And
this guy from the San Francisco
Chronicle called me up for an in
terview, and the first thing he
asked me was whether I was about
to die.
So we're thinking about pulling
a publicity stunt, telling everyone
I am about to die. You know, buy
the album before Tim Quirk dies.
Seriously, though, I wrote the song
when I was lying in bed one day
full of self-pity, thinking about how
no one would miss me if I died.
What are your plans now?
Well, we're back here in New
York until we start touring. We'll
be on the road with Love Tractor
until June; we'll probably then —
well, definitely — cut another
record over the summer and maybe
tour in England.
If you could sum up the band
in one word, what would it be?
Shitheads.

tough guys who want to be literate.
Is this a full-time thing or do
you all have real jobs?
We're about to tour, so we don't
hold jobs except now and then to
make money so we can buy equip
ment. I've been doing some writing
for Nickelodeon, a cable channcl
— some screenplays and stuff.
When the money runs out, we
tour.
What's meant by the title of
your album "Son of Sam I Am"?
We're a bunch of white, middle
class kids; we read Dr. Seuss and
stuff like that. So we're satirizing
that. Maybe we're too white for
our own good. The title "Son of
Sam I Am" is sort of a follow-up
to our last album, "Green Eggs
and Crack." You know, you can
be literate and read Dr. Seuss. They
ought to put Dr. Seuss in Western
Culture.
You know they're trashing
Western Culture this year in favor
of CIV.
Yeah, that's sort of ironic. The

funny part is that in the '60s the
radicals demanded Western Cul
ture because we weren't learning
enough about our own culture, and
now they want to get rid of it for
the opposite reason.
Back to your music. You pull
a unique trick in covering an L.L.
Cool J. song "It's A lie." That's
sort of different, a rock band
covering a rap tune. Why did you
choose to?
Well, the bass player likes rap
music, and whenever we're on the
road and it's his turn to play a
tape, he plays rap. "It's A Lie" is
at least lyrically the type of song
we like to write — pretty silly and
obnoxious. So we used his lyrics,
wrote a melody and developed our
own instrumentation.
Rumor has it that "Kicking'' is
going to be the big single off the
album. Any comment?
It's a song about a guy who's
trying to deal with cancer. And
this guy from the San Francisco
Chronicle called me up for an in
terview, and the first thing he
asked me was whether I was about
to die.
So we're thinking about pulling
a publicity stunt, telling everyone
I am about to die. You know, buy
the album before Tim Quirk dies.
Seriously, though, I wrote the song
when I was lying in bed one day
full of self-pity, thinking about how
no one would miss me if I died.
What are your plans now?
Well, we're back here in New
York until we start touring. We'll
be on the road with Love Tractor
until June; we'll probably then —
well, definitely — cut another
record over the summer and maybe
tour in England.
If you could sum up the band
in one word, what would it be?
Shitheads.


Alias Records
The members of Too Much Joy (left to right) bassist Sandy Smallens, singer/Stanford grad Tim Quirk,
drummer Tommy Vinton and guitarist Jay Blumenfeld.
Let's have a show of hands on
this one: Would you shell out $10
for an album by a group of Ivy-
League-caliber-school gradst No
takers! Well, think again, because
Too Much Joy fit that description
— and they rock.
Too Much Joy consists of singer
and Stanford grad Tim Quirk, Yale
University alum/bassist Sandy
Smallens, guitarist and former
Weenie (you know where he went)
Jay Blumenfeld and drummer
Tommy Vinton, who went to lona.
Recently Quirk took time out to
talk to Intermission about the
band, Stanford, life and the rela
tionship of self-interest and the
common good in Mote's "Utopia."
(OK, maybe not the last one.):
Your bandmates are from UC-
Bcrkcley, Yale and Iona? How did
the four of you get together?
We all grew up together and
went to high school in Scarsdale,
N.Y. At that time we were sort of
outcasts and misfits, so we started
a band and played school dances
and stuff.
We had sort of a split-up when
we all went to college, but when
we graduated we didn't want to
lead real lives. So we all got back
together and did some touring in
California. We got in the habit of
passing out copies of our album,
and a friend of a friend of a friend
of the bass player talked about this
new company, Alias Records. They
Signed us.
When you came to Stanford
what were your plans? Did your
major relate to music?
I didn't know what I wanted. I
majored in communications with
a concentration in film. Oh, by
the way, did I tell you about pissing
on the roof of The Daily?
Well, not really. What hap
pened?

Well, I used to work for the
Chaparral, but there's no
bathrooms in the Chappie office
... so we got mad and decided
we'd piss on the roof of The Daily.
They got pissed at us when we
pissed on them, and threatened to
do an article about it, so we did
a parody of The Daily.
Also, the Chappie always ran a
joke platform in the ASSU elec
tions, and that was the year every
one was really fed up with the
ASSU — so they voted for us. We
weren't planning on it at all, but
I was co-president of the ASSU for
'85-86.
I guess you'd say the Chaparral
influenced you a bit. Was the idea
of the band to be some type of
"Nerd Rockers"?
Nah, we don't take ourselves too
seriously. We're just a bunch of
tough guys who want to be literate.
Is this a full-time thing or do
you all have real jobs?
