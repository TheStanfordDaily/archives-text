# Despite their really goofy name Too Much Joy's music rocks

You can't get enough of Too Much Joy. At least
that's the way I feel about their latest album, "Son
of Sam I Am," which is alternately a monologue
of one-liners and social consciousness soliloquies,
but always musically interesting.
Too Much Joy has a sound that's really down
to earth; electric and acoustic guitars, drums and
bass, and most everyone chiming in on vocals.
It's a little like R.E.M. (doesn't every new band
seem to sound like R.E.M.?), but it's got more of
the Georgia Satellites' flavor of total garage-band
casualness.
Need a laugh? Then check out "My Past Lives":
"I was Ghengis Khan / I Was Aristophanes / I
was a man named Urg in 50,000 B.C. / I should
write a book about my past lives." Or try "It's A
Lie," which is — believe it or not — a cover of

an L.L. Cool J. tune.
Want to be enlightened? Then listen to "Making
Fun of Bums," a characterization of a recently
become-homeless man's struggle to deal with his
new situation. Too Much Joy sings, "If I had a
billion dollars / I'd buy back my old room."
"Clowns," "1964" and "Worse" are further socially
conscious tunes.
And if you want to hear one of the best songs
of 1989, if not the decade, flip the tape to side
two and play "Kicking." Serious lyrics coupled
with sealing guitar and an exhilarating chorus
make it a winner.
And that's true of the entire album. Every song
takes you by surprise, either tickling your funny
bone or pricking your conscience, while still
making a musical run for the money. I've had
the album two weeks and I still listen to it at
least once day (sort of like vitamins, except with
different side-effects).
