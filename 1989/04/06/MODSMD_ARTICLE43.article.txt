# Gilliam's new fantasy a bit munch

Wasn't Spring Break fun?
Well, while some of you lucky
scum were soaking up the rays in
Palm Beach or Hawaii, I was stuck
in Olympia, Wash, wondering
"What the hell am I doing here?"
While you were busy downing a
few cold ones and noticing all
those nice tans, I was avoiding the
rain by watching "The Adventures
of Baron Munchausen," the latest
film from director Terry Gilliam,
ex-Monty Pythoner and director of
other weird cult hits such as "Time
Bandits" and "Brazil" (the movie,
not the country).
"The Adventures of Baron
Munchausen" has a child-like in
nocence as it retells the legendary
exploits of Karl Friedrich
Hieronymus, the Baron von
Munchausen, and his four friends:
Albrecht, the strongest man alive;
Berthold, the fastest man alive;

Adolphus, who can see halfway
around the world; and Gustavus,
who can blow harder than a hur
ricane. In case you're wondering,
the characters are as cheesy as they
sound.
Driven by the fighting spirit of
Sally, the 8-year-old babe in the
film, the Baron searches the world
and the moon to find his four
friends and save Sally's besieged
city. Together, Sally and the Baron
travel to the moon in a hot-air
balloon made of women's under
garments. What else could you go
to the moon in during the 18th
century? NASA should really look
into this one.
On the moon, they rescue Ber
thold from the insane King of the
Moon whose head and body have
two different ideas of what fun is.
The head is into serious insanity
while the body is into the Queen
of the Moon. It's a real trip watch
ing this part of the movie, which
is by far the most entertaining.

Unfortunately, it isn't enough to
save the entire movie.
When the three fall back to
earth, they land in Mount Etna,
my favorite volcano. There they
meet Vulcan and Venus, who
doesn't look too bad either. After
the Baron puts the moves on
Venus, they get kicked out by a
jealous Vulcan (the God, not one
of Spock's people) and end up being
swallowed by a large fish. Inside
the large fish they find the other
three friends.
All this takes place during the
Age of Reason, when ideas like
ping to the moon in a hot-air
Balloon and dancing with Venus
weren't exactly accepted as reason
able. However, when the Baron and
his Fab Four save the city in a
daring display of courage and com
edy fit for your little brother, they
prove that reason doesn't have all
the answers. Or maybe they prove
that Gilliam took too many drugs
in the '60s (if that's possible), and
the film is just silly.
