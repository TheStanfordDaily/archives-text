# NIGHT HAWKS
## at the Creamery 
### Susan McKean 
A PAIR OF GIRLS scrutinize their menus. Two
stools down, a hulking man losing his hair and
gaining it on his chin dwarfs his cup of coffee
with his size and his stare deep into the pale
brown liquid.
Pat's reddish hair is done up in a French twist,
red carnations pinned to the front. She wears a white frilled
shirt and black pants, soiled a little by french fry grease and
spilt milkshake. She laughs and mutters to herself as she
checks the order on the pad hooked at her waist.
Some swing comes on the juke box. The orange neon clock
hits midnight and things pick up.
A middle-aged couple at the bar curl together around apple
pie, impervious to the mostly student-aged crowd. "Roxanne"
replaces the swing. Shelley twists two shakes off the machine
and loads them onto a tray with two beers and some fries.
Dishes rattle, conversations hum and arrows of cool late
night air from a quiet and puddled street shoot in as customers
play hide-and-seek with the morning. Mr. Coat-and-tie and
hands-in-pockets leaves the Creamery.

The University Creamery is a relic
and a reflection. It's an anomaly
among Palo Alto's most recent
waves of plastic and pink asym
metry and resplendency.

It's been 209 University Ave. since 1917. An establishment
arguably as revolutionary in its surroundings as was the more
famous incident that year.
The nine booths and 14 stools hold all types of people all
the time, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
The University Creamery is a relic and a reflection. It is an
island of real-people magnetism with dust in the corners sur
rounded by a golddusting of 72 years. It's an anomaly among
Palo Alto's most recent waves of plastic and pink asymmetry
and resplendency.
Tonight the street people aren't making any scenes. The guy
staring into his coffee might be one. Or the slumped figure at
the back of the room occasionally muttering a slurred phrase.
People are equal here, or at least equally treated with the

same rough respect or surly service.
"You come here if you want a cup of coffee or to get laid
or if you have nowhere else to go," says Hank, two stools to
the right, sipping coffee and smoking.
Most people, however, come for the bittersweet chocolate
shakes.
"Some girls in here almost have a heart attack when we run
out of 'em," testifies Shelley, the long-haired waitress who
brings a book every night but rarely gets a moment to read.
She makes at least 30 shakes on a good night.
Each shake gets 21 ounces of ice cream and a tall cupful of
whole milk. And only one person in seven years has complained
about them — some difficulty with the chocolate bits at the
bottom, according to manager Mike Callaway, who orders about
100 gallons of Bud's ice cream each week.

People come for other reasons as well.
With a mischievous smirk Callaway remembers one
Friday night during Stanford's Rush week. Five mini
skirts, pairs of stockings and high heels walked in
— worn by five bearded men.
Giggles cautiously bubble up when Pat and Shelley recall
the last night they served a dish of whipped cream. In the
end, it was all over the wall, table, seats and students.
And in 1986, a toy gun earned a robber enough to buy a
shake and not much more says Callaway. The police came in
minutes but the thief was gone.
Late December last year, a man wanted a steak knife with
his order. Later on, a dish cleaner found him bleeding at the
wrists in the bathroom sink.
