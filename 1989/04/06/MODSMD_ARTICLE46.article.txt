# NIGHT HAWKS
## at the Creamery 
### Susan McKean 
A PAIR OF GIRLS scrutinize their menus. Two
stools down, a hulking man losing his hair and
gaining it on his chin dwarfs his cup of coffee
with his size and his stare deep into the pale
brown liquid.
Pat's reddish hair is done up in a French twist,
red carnations pinned to the front. She wears a white frilled
shirt and black pants, soiled a little by french fry grease and
spilt milkshake. She laughs and mutters to herself as she
checks the order on the pad hooked at her waist.
Some swing comes on the juke box. The orange neon clock
hits midnight and things pick up.
A middle-aged couple at the bar curl together around apple
pie, impervious to the mostly student-aged crowd. "Roxanne"
replaces the swing. Shelley twists two shakes off the machine
and loads them onto a tray with two beers and some fries.
Dishes rattle, conversations hum and arrows of cool late
night air from a quiet and puddled street shoot in as customers
play hide-and-seek with the morning. Mr. Coat-and-tie and
hands-in-pockets leaves the Creamery.

The University Creamery is a relic
and a reflection. It's an anomaly
among Palo Alto's most recent
waves of plastic and pink asym
metry and resplendency.

It's been 209 University Ave. since 1917. An establishment
arguably as revolutionary in its surroundings as was the more
famous incident that year.
The nine booths and 14 stools hold all types of people all
the time, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
The University Creamery is a relic and a reflection. It is an
island of real-people magnetism with dust in the corners sur
rounded by a golddusting of 72 years. It's an anomaly among
Palo Alto's most recent waves of plastic and pink asymmetry
and resplendency.
Tonight the street people aren't making any scenes. The guy
staring into his coffee might be one. Or the slumped figure at
the back of the room occasionally muttering a slurred phrase.
People are equal here, or at least equally treated with the

same rough respect or surly service.
"You come here if you want a cup of coffee or to get laid
or if you have nowhere else to go," says Hank, two stools to
the right, sipping coffee and smoking.
Most people, however, come for the bittersweet chocolate
shakes.
"Some girls in here almost have a heart attack when we run
out of 'em," testifies Shelley, the long-haired waitress who
brings a book every night but rarely gets a moment to read.
She makes at least 30 shakes on a good night.
Each shake gets 21 ounces of ice cream and a tall cupful of
whole milk. And only one person in seven years has complained
about them — some difficulty with the chocolate bits at the
bottom, according to manager Mike Callaway, who orders about
100 gallons of Bud's ice cream each week.
□
People come for other reasons as well.
With a mischievous smirk Callaway remembers one
Friday night during Stanford's Rush week. Five mini
skirts, pairs of stockings and high heels walked in
— worn by five bearded men.
Giggles cautiously bubble up when Pat and Shelley recall
the last night they served a dish of whipped cream. In the
end, it was all over the wall, table, seats and students.
And in 1986, a toy gun earned a robber enough to buy a
shake and not much more says Callaway. The police came in
minutes but the thief was gone.
Late December last year, a man wanted a steak knife with
his order. Later on, a dish cleaner found him bleeding at the
wrists in the bathroom sink.

The Creamery clientele sings its
uncertain attachment to past
and present through the juke
box. The Stones, Elvis, Otis
Redding and Sade harmonize for quar
ters. Callaway says there is a cancel but
ton in the kitchen, but it's never pushed.
"La Bamba" nearly drove him to it once
before "Guns and Roses" sweetly in
vaded.
Pat likes the oldies. She also likes the
people. And people know her. She says
she is often recognized on the train. She's
currently reading a book about Harry
Truman. Hank calls her "unique."
Born in Georgia and raised in Florida,
Pat's gravelly Southern drawl easily slips
into a laugh, suggesting the patient good
spirit her job demands.
Both she and Shelley live nearby. They
both sleep during the day after the nights
they work, and agree that the day crowd
is "dead." Many Friday and Saturday
nights they work from 9 p.m. until 3:30
a.m. without a break.
In the midst of South Bay silicon
wealth, the Creamery is a haven for
street people and others with few places
to go. Callaway says he talks sports and
politics with them in the mornings, and
finds the hardest part of his job drawing
the line between being a friend to cus
tomers and running a business.

Shelley says, "You kind of have to
turn your back a little bit." But Pat,
who has worked at the Creamery for

customers to leave when they start fall

Some change does penetrate even
the frosted glass and linoleum of
the place. New upholstery re

An Arizona native, Tom, sitting a few
stools to the left, has been in the Bay
area since 1960, and remembers the
Creamery in the '70s. Change has not
meant improvement, he suggests as he
fights insomnia with a cup of coffee.
Society was better back then, he says:
"There was no women's lib, no herpes,
no AIDS. A lot more romance." The
Creamery was better too: "It used to be
run a little bit better, more service. It
was cleaner." He still frequents it, how
ever, for hamburgers and coffee and late
night reflections on the relics the
Creamery evokes.
"The Creamery is a trip. It's curious
how this place stays open, with its mul
tiple personalities," says Hank. "In the
city or in Fresno it wouldn't be anything
different. But here it stands out like a
white elephant. It's a totally different
trip than anywhere else."

Tex, Leland and Koshy have reg
ularly made the nearly half an
hour trip from Newark to this
irregularity for almost three
years. They come to watch the people,
including the other college students like
themselves, and to laugh.

moment ® ' n the . we ® h ° urs of the morning, University Creamery waitress Shelley Ellis fills the ketchup
bottles that turn upsidedown hundreds of times over the Creamery's famous fries and heighten hungry anticipation.
"It's a place where street people and
business owners and students all feel
comfortable," says Callaway.
"What makes this place unique is that
it's 180 degrees from the academic,
pseudo-intellectual trip that goes on in
the rest of the area," says Hank, "It
flashes me back to the '50s and when 1
was a kid. I was just thinking about
childhood and milkshakes."
The dark wooden-framed mirror be
hind the counter, behind nine kinds of
beer, seven cereals and Fun Cones,
reflects people back onto themselves,
casts the moment in the frame of another
time. Early mornings, late nights, youth
and age mingle under the hanging lamps
and the glow of the antique clock
preserved at the expense of a free Bud's
Ice Cream clock.
Only outside do the flashing street
cleaning machines recall the next morn
ing's alarm.
"This is a good story right here for
the Twilight Zone and Rod Steiger.
There's no pretension. If you want a cup
of coffee, you got a cup of coffee," Hank
says as he sips his, nodding his head.
Behind him, the slumped figure

She makes at least 30 shakes on a good night.
Each shake gets 21 ounces of ice cream and a tall cupful of
whole milk. And only one person in seven years has complained
about them — some difficulty with the chocolate bits at the

100 gallons of Bud's ice cream each week.

ters. Callaway says there is a cancel but
ton in the kitchen, but it's never pushed.
"La Bamba" nearly drove him to it once
before "Guns and Roses" sweetly in
vaded.
Pat likes the oldies. She also likes the
people. And people know her. She says
she is often recognized on the train. She's
currently reading a book about Harry
Truman. Hank calls her "unique."
Born in Georgia and raised in Florida,
Pat's gravelly Southern drawl easily slips
into a laugh, suggesting the patient good
spirit her job demands.
Both she and Shelley live nearby. They
both sleep during the day after the nights
they work, and agree that the day crowd
is "dead." Many Friday and Saturday
nights they work from 9 p.m. until 3:30
a.m. without a break.
In the midst of South Bay silicon
wealth, the Creamery is a haven for
street people and others with few places
to go. Callaway says he talks sports and
politics with them in the mornings, and
finds the hardest part of his job drawing
the line between being a friend to cus
tomers and running a business.

Shelley says, "You kind of have to
turn your back a little bit." But Pat,
who has worked at the Creamery for

want a cup of coffee or
to get laid or if you
have nowhere else to
go,' says Hank, sipping
coffee and smoking.

four years, says "It's not as hard as it
used to be" to ask apparently homeless
customers to leave when they start fall
ing asleep in booths.

Some change does penetrate even
the frosted glass and linoleum of
the place. New upholstery re
cently hit the booths.
And Callaway notices a growth of
younger teenagers hanging out, often
conspicuously flaunting parental neglect

and making drug deals ostentatiously.
An Arizona native, Tom, sitting a few
stools to the left, has been in the Bay
area since 1960, and remembers the
Creamery in the '70s. Change has not
meant improvement, he suggests as he
fights insomnia with a cup of coffee.
Society was better back then, he says:
"There was no women's lib, no herpes,
no AIDS. A lot more romance." The
Creamery was better too: "It used to be
run a little bit better, more service. It
was cleaner." He still frequents it, how
ever, for hamburgers and coffee and late
night reflections on the relics the
Creamery evokes.
"The Creamery is a trip. It's curious
how this place stays open, with its mul
tiple personalities," says Hank. "In the
city or in Fresno it wouldn't be anything
different. But here it stands out like a
white elephant. It's a totally different
trip than anywhere else."

Tex, Leland and Koshy have reg
ularly made the nearly half an
hour trip from Newark to this
irregularity for almost three
years. They come to watch the people,
including the other college students like
themselves, and to laugh.


£ iic Jones — Dally
moment ® ' n the . we ® h ° urs of the morning, University Creamery waitress Shelley Ellis fills the ketchup
bottles that turn upsidedown hundreds of times over the Creamery's famous fries and heighten hungry anticipation.
"It's a place where street people and
business owners and students all feel
comfortable," says Callaway.
"What makes this place unique is that
it's 180 degrees from the academic,
pseudo-intellectual trip that goes on in
the rest of the area," says Hank, "It
flashes me back to the '50s and when 1
was a kid. I was just thinking about
childhood and milkshakes."
The dark wooden-framed mirror be
hind the counter, behind nine kinds of
beer, seven cereals and Fun Cones,
reflects people back onto themselves,
casts the moment in the frame of another
time. Early mornings, late nights, youth
and age mingle under the hanging lamps
and the glow of the antique clock
preserved at the expense of a free Bud's
Ice Cream clock.
Only outside do the flashing street
cleaning machines recall the next morn
ing's alarm.
"This is a good story right here for
the Twilight Zone and Rod Steiger.
There's no pretension. If you want a cup
of coffee, you got a cup of coffee," Hank
says as he sips his, nodding his head.
Behind him, the slumped figure
shufTles over to the juke box. At the end
of the counter, two grown men haggle
over splitting a mint chip shake.

It's been 209 University Ave. since 1917. An
establishment arguably as revolutionary in
its surroundings as was the more famous
incident that year. The nine booths and 14
stools hold all types of people all the time.
