# TRAILBLAZING
## Backpacking and hiking in the hills 
### Kathy Lachenauer 
LOST IN a grove of
redwoods, the cou
ple wanders
through the dark,
cool maze hand in
hand. He hears the
rush of water and sprints
ahead, out of the grove and
into the sunshine. Gushing
over a mossy cliff is a silvery
waterfall, more than 50-feet
high.
Fat cows and a satellite dish
— the standard Stanford stroll
— just can't compete with the
hidden surprises of hiking
trails that are so close to
campus but so rarely explored.
Only minutes away from the
Farm are beautiful open
preserves and parks that even
my clunky '75 Chevette can
reach.
This quarter you're bound
to feel the urge for a back-to
nature adventure at one time
or another. Imagine a breezy,
cool day . . . your afternoon
class just got called off. What
better time to start a hiking
exploration?
Windy Hill Open Space
Preserve is a good place to
start.
Located about 15 minutes
away from campus off Alpine
Road, the preserve's high,
grassy hills overlook campus
and the coast.
Windy Hill lives up to its
name. A breeze from the ocean
will keep you cool as you stroll
through meadows and start the
climb up to the peak, 1,650
feet high.
A 8.4-mile loop — which
will take about five hours to
hike — will guide you through
groves of Monterey Cypress

and Douglas fir, but watch out
for poison oak on the way. The
climb to the peak is fairly
strenuous, but if it's a clear
day, you'll have a great view
of the ocean once you reach
the top.
If huffing and puffing is not
for you, then take the trail by
the picnic area that crosses
over a small stream and into
the meadow. It's a great place
for flying a kite or soaking up
the sun.
To get to the preserve, take
Alpine Road past Interstate
280 and Zots. The road will
turn into a windy one-laner.
Be on the lookout for two small
wooden signs. One says
"Private Property, No En
trance" the other says "Windy
Hill Preserve." It seems con
tradictory, but that's the way
into Windy Hill.
Wundcrlich Park is another
quick and casy-to-reach
getaway with plenty to see. For

both horse lovers and history
buffs, a hike through at least
some of the 942-acre park is
a must.
More horseback riders than
hikers are usually out on Wun
derlich's winding trails that
pass through groves of Douglas
fir and eucalyptus trees.
Watching the broad-bodied
horses maneuver down the
skinny, meandering trails is a
sight to see. But don't take
your eyes off your own feet for
too long or you'll step in some
nasty dung. My shoes still
stink.
When you arrive, you'll park
near a ranger station and horse
stables. Try to find Bear Gulch
Trail. Looking up Bear Gulch
you'll probably spot a long skid
trail created by oxen in the
1860s. The oxen used to drag
redwood logs down the moun
tains to provide timber for the
Bay Area.
The Bear Gulch Trail will

take you through a meadow
filled with the flowery bril
liance of a blossoming spring.
Then, lumbering out of the
meadowland's sunshine, it
climbs into a forest of oak and
pine trees. Although the path
is not too steep, you will be
short of breath during the up
hill climb.
Connect with Alambique
Trail from Bear Gulch Trail.
Along the path and to your left
is an impressive redwood tree
that seems to sta*d as tall as
Hoover Tower itself.-It's one
sight you can't miss.
As Alambique starts to des
cend back down to the ranger
station, you'll want to stop and
look to your right for sensa
tional views of the City as well
as of the tiny Stanford campus.
To reach the park from Stan
ford, take Intersate 280 north
to the Woodside Road West


Jim Roberts — Dally
past the rustic old town of
Woodside and up a winding
road. Look for a sign for Wun
derlich Park on your right.
Now that you've built up
your calves and you're an ex
pert on local-area hiking, it's
time to explore a little farther
from home. About 90 minutes
from campus is Big Basin
State Park, home of the giant
redwoods.
April is the ideal month to
hike Big Basin, says Park
Ranger Sandy Playa. The grass
is a rich green; poppies and
other flowers are coming to
bloom,- and the "rainy" season
will have just ended.
Water will be gushing over
the park's two waterfalls —
Berry Creek and Silver Falls.
You'll need to hike for quite
some time before catching a
view of the torrents, but it's
definitely worth the exercise.
Ranger Playa says her favor
ite hike — which is still rela

tivcly untraveled — is Meteor
Trail. Leave your car at the
ranger station and head past
Lane Sunset Camp. The trail
will lead you past an old
shingle mill and through some
lodgepole pine and chaparral
trees.
I wish I had heard the
ranger's words of wisdom
before I went on my own ad
venture through the park. Like
a lost Hansel and Gretel, my
hiking partner and I wandered
for hours along Berry Creek
Trail. The sunshine never
broke through the sequoias
that towered above us, and we
never did find Berry Creek
Falls. But with 45 miles of
trails, Big Basin has enough
trails to entice us to try our
luck again and find a better
hike.
Big Basin has a $3-per-car
entrance fee. To get there, fol
low Highway 9 south through
Portola Valley and then turn
west onto Highway 236. Be
sure to catch the breathtaking
views of the basin along the
way.
