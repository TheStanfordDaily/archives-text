# The 						5 Essentials of Happy Hiking
## 
### 
• Hiking boots/running shoes. Tennis
shoes just don't cut it when it's
muddy or steep.
• Water bottle. Even for an afternoon
hike, you're going to want something
to quench your thirst after an uphill
climb.
• The Santa Cruz Mountains Trail
Book. Filled with maps, wildlife track
identifications, trail suggestions and
even a recipe for acorn muffins, this
book is well worth its $7.95 price tag.
• A backpack. Stuff the water bottle,
trail book and a sweat shirt inside.
• A partner. If you lose your way, it's
not as scary with someone else there.
Out in the wilderness with only you
two and the squirrels can also make
for a romantic first date.
