ON A PEACEFUL, sunny
afternoon, heading to the
hills on a mountain bike
can take your breath
away. Climbing the in
clines at a turtle's pace,
racing down the straightaways faster than
a jackrabbit — mountain biking offers
you the rustic solitude of hiking mixed
with the thrill of downhill skiing.
Fortunately, Stanford's central location
on the Peninsula provides students with
some excellent opportunities for pursuing
the sport. Fire roads and trails criss-cross
the Stanford Foothills linking the Bay to
the Pacific.
For your first mountain bike ride, stay
right on campus and try the Dish. From
paved trails that gently climb the foothills
to steep descents through the quarry, the
Dish offers a wide variety of terrain in a
relatively small amount of space. No mat
ter how many times a mountain biker
cruises around the Dish, there is always
another hair-raising trail to try or another
spectacular view to see.
The Dish is an excellent spot for that
introductory ride or for a quick one-hour
blast before dinner. Flying along a narrow
trail underneath a screaming pink sunset
is an adventure not to miss.
Located about two miles from campus,
Palo Alto's Arastradero Preserve contains
several mountain biking trails. From
campus, ride west on Page Mill Road.

Once you pass underneath Interstate 280,
go a couple hundred yards and take a
right onto Arastradero Road. The preserve
is about a quarter mile up the road on
your left; it's well marked. You'll find
gentle rolling hills in Arastradero Preserve,
as well as an excellent view of Felt Lake,
the foothills and the Bay.
A climb up Alpine Road to the top of
the Santa Cruz Mountains is another trip
not to miss. Alpine intersects Junipero
Serra Boulevard near the Stanford golf
course. If you ride west up Alpine through
Portola Valley for seven miles or so, the
road will narrow and you'll hit a 4-foot
metal gate. Jump the gate and you'll be
thrashing along a dirt road.
The climb up Alpine is wooded and
not too steep. On the way, you will get
some excellent northward views of San
Francisco and Mount Tamalpias, not to
mention a panaroma of campus well
worth the cover of a Stanford calendar.
Alpine intersects Page Mill Road near
Skyline Boulevard. From here, there are
several mountain biking trails along the
crest of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Two
descend down Alpine — a high-speed one
down the paved road, or a wild twisty,
narrow one down the trail.
Many hiking trails are off-limits to
mountain bikers. When you head out for
your afternoon in the sun, remember to
respect the "no bikes" signs; it's vital to
maintain the trail network. Otherwise,
mountain bikes will be prohibited from
even more areas than they are now.
