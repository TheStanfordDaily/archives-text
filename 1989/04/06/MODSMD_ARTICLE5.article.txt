### Caitlin Liu Staff writer 
The Law School announced Tuesday it will b;iii
the nation's largest law firm, Baker & McKenzie,
from recruiting on campus until the firm meets
conditions "to ensure unbiased behavior by its re
cruiters toward law students."
According to a letter sent to Baker & McKenzi'
by the school's oversight committee, the law firm
must develop a training program in non
discriminatory interviewing for all personnel in
volved in recruiting, and ensure that all Baker &
McKenzie employees who interview Stanford stu
dents receive this training.
The Law School will permit Baker & McKenzie
to recruit here this fall quarter "if and only if they
come up with a training program," Law School As<-1.
Dean of Student Affairs Sally Dickson said.
Law School Dean Paul Brest said yesterday he
agrees with the committee, and thinks that the
decision was "proper."
Responding to the committee's decision, Baker &
McKenzie recruiting partner Edward Burmeistei
wrote that the firm was "disappointed to learn . .
that the committee ... feels the necessity to deny
Baker & McKenzie, even provisionally, the use of
the Law School's placement facilities."
Burmeister added that the firm has "every in
tention and desire to comply" with the Law School's
requests in time to participate m the upcoming fall
recruiting season.
Already, the firm has taken steps to develop an
interview training program for its employees,
Burmeister's letter stated. The firm has scheduled
an all-attorney luncheon May 18 for its San Fran
cisco and Palo Alto offices which will address proper
interviewing techniques and treatment of summer
associates.
The firm has also "compiled a library of materi
als" pertaining to minority recruitment and equ !
employment opportunity practices, the letter said
In addition, the firm has pledged $100,000 an
nually for the next five years to "provide financial
assistance for the purpose of increasing enrollment
of minority law students" in the law schools where
the firm recruits, according to the letter.
The law firm's San Francisco branch could not
be reached yesterday for further comment.
Last quarter, several Stanford Law School student
associations asked the administration to ban Baker
& McKenzie from recruiting on campus for one
year because of racist, sexist and anti-Semitic re
marks made by a partner of the firm during an
interview with a black female student from the
University of Chicago.
According to committee member Dickson, the
group took three concerns into account when making
the decision: the Law School's non-discriminatio
policy, the Chicago incident and the welfare of Stan
ford students.
"The committee tried to formulate a remedy so
that the Chicago incident is not repeated," she said
Brest said, "We are not interested in punishing
but in protecting."
According to the National Law Journal, Chicago
has already banned the firm from recruiting on its
campus for one year. Yale Law School is discussing
a ban but has not yet taken formal action against
Baker & McKenzie despite earlier reports, Yale Law
School Asst. Dean Barbara Safriet said in a telepl
interview yesterday.
