# Tracking life in transition
## 
### Mark Weiner 
If you really want to get off
the Farm — if you've got to
escape to someplace com
pletely different — don't go to
San Francisco. Just catch the
train and ride.
It doesn't even matter where
you go, just as long as you're
going.
When you step on board
CalTrain, you enter an imper
manent geographical space,
with its own culture removed
from life beyond the "Watch
Your Step" signs. Simply ab
sorbing this culture merits a
trip.
If you look closely, vou'll see
the visible markers of a transit
system in transition, a system
that's very old but, at the same
time, in the process of becom
ing new. You'll see a transit
system that changed a city now
scurrying to change with it.
Although nearly half a mil
lion people ride CalTrain each
month, some Stanford stu
dents never set foot in the Palo
Alto station. That's too bad,
because in many ways
CalTYain is poised on the edge
of important institutional and
cultural change, poised be
tween its past and its future.
On June 30, 1990, the 10-
year operating agreement be
tween Southern Pacific and
Caltrans will expire and ad
ministration of the train serv
ice will fall into local hands.
That means the Peninsula's
only full-commuter railway
system loses state support,
from which it currently
receives almost half its fund
ing.
SamTrans Deputy General
Manager Jim Gallagher (Stan
ford '53) says that without
state support, CalTrain would
probably have to close up shop.
"The state must stay in or
der for us to maintain service,"

says Gallagher, who seems
cautiously optimistic about
CalTrain's future. "Without
the state, we're as useful as a
Jack Elway game plan."

'The state must
stay in order for
(CalTrain) to main
tain service. With
out the state, we're
as useful as a Jack
Elway game plan.'
— Jim Gallagher

But despite the possibility
that the rail service could be
in serious financial trouble,

CalTrain has set an ambitious
five-year plan through which
it hopes to recruit more pas
sengers.
While CalTrain's agenda is
diverse — including plans to
increase train frequency, curb
parking congestion and con
struction of a public address
system at each station — its
most significant priority is the
extension of service to cur
rently unserved areas in San
Francisco.
CalTrain plans to extend its
rail line from 4th and
Townscnd to the Transbay
Transit Terminal and to con
struct seven new stations
along the Bayshore Corridor,
from Transbay to the San Fran
cisco Airport.
Although some of this ex
tension is planned to occur by

1995, Gallagher says accurate
predictions can't be made until
the status of CalTrain's owner
ship is resolved.
While the story of the trans
continental railroad has as
cended into the realm of
ideological myth, railways in
general have fallen on hard
times in the past 30 years.
With the construction of new
freeways in the late 1950s and
early '60s, the train became
somewhat obsolete, its 1880-
1930 heyday gone forever.
Built for the 19th century
centralized city, rail lines
couldn't serve the 20th cen
tury, multi-centered metropo
lis, with its diffusion of lobs
and homes into what UC-
Berkclcy Geography Prof.
James Vance calls "urban
realms."
