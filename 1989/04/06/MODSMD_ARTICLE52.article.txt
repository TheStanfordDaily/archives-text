didn't have any glamor. For us
it was cars and airplanes. We
didn't want to he Casey Jones,
we wanted to be Charles
Lindberg."
But CalTrain's institutional
changes, particularly the con
struction of new terminals,
may signal a new visibility for
trains on our cultural
landscape. With freeway con
gestion expected to become ab
solutely intolerable in the next
decade, traffic volume at the
San Mateo Country line has
already surpassed projections
for the year 2005, people may

turn to the train for a welcome
and environmentally
conscious respite.
"It's difficult to expand high
ways," says CalTrain Trans
portation Planner Roger
Hooson. "They take up a lot
of space. Besides, these days
are different than the '40s and
'50s. Back then, there were no
hearings, no environmental
processes, there were far fewer
actors included, you didn't
have to pay as much money
to condemn property."
"The rail is compact," says

Hooson, "and there are a lot
of lines already there."
A ride on CalTrain , requir
ing an hour and $2.65, allows
a glimpse of how our culture
might respond to the revival
of this technological dinosaur.
While for commuters riding a
train is generally a prosaic ex
perience, students can appoach
their transit with less jaded
eyes.
With a little effort, they can
make the train resonate with
their cultural experience and
transform travel itself into a
meaningful event.
Looking out a train window
is a case in point. Observers
have long discussed the signif
icance of window-watching. In
1834, for instance, philosopher
Ralph Waldo Emerson ob
served that, "One . . . who rides
on the rail-road gains a prac
tical confirmation of the ideal
philosophy that matter is phe
nomenal whilst men and trees
and barns whiz by you as fast
as the leaves of a dictionary.
The very permanence of mat
ter seems compromised and
trees, fields, hills, hitherto es
teemed symbols of stability, do
absolutely dance by you."
You may not have the same
transcendental experience
looking out a window, but
watching the blurr of America
before you may spur the free
play of the imagination.
Or you just find that there's
a simple pleasure gained in
looking into others' backyards
or marveling at the new struc
tures being built alongside the
tracks. Many of the towns you
pass on CalTrain originated be
cause of the railroad, so watch
ing them grow from the train
itself is appropriate.
But don't gaze out the win
dow for your entire trip, or else
you'll miss another interesting,
animated aspect of trains —
the people who ride them.
Trains are a fairly demo
cratic form of transportation,
and with all different types of
people confined together in a
relatively small space, they're
perfect places to people-watch.

On a good ride, you might
see: Two punks slouched
against the window, five busi
nessmen in dressed-to-win
blue suits, six people coming
back from shopping trips, one
conductor, a few students, a
college journalist and his pho
tographer, one person reading
The Bible, 11 people reading
company reports, three people
reading mysteries, two
engrossed in romance novels,
10 skimming the Chronicle,
innumberable numbers
looking out the window and
one high school student
reading John Steinbeck.
Try seeing that in a car.
A final suggestion: Don't
just ride to San Francisco and
immediately board the return
train. Take a while to look
around the station. Railway
terminals have occupied an
important part of our culture,
and anyone riding the rails to
the City shouldn't go without
a tour, if only to understand
how the station's importance
has declined.
You'll still see an awesome,
wonderful flurry of color and
motion: commuters running,
buying flowers, eating hot
dogs, shoveling popcorn in
their mouths, reading the Star,
standing in line and just mil
ling around, smoking. If you
look across the street, you'll

see commuters swarming
down die alleyways toward the
station in one giant human
mass.
You'll still see the human
pageant.
But if you look for clues,
you'll also see the station's
decline.
Look for banners that hang
from the ceiling, intended to
beautify that which has
decaycd. Walk into the parking
lot and look for half-buried
train tracks and cobblestone,
remnants of a once great sys
tem. Notice hr.v the station,
once a city's most important
building, is now dwarfed by
distant corporate highrises. See
how the nearby roads and
highways assume more spatial
importance than the train
tracks.
Built in 1940 by one of the
designers of Union Station in
Los Angeles, Palo Alto station

signs of decay-chipping paint,
graffiti, ticket and information
desks with increasingly shorter
hours.
Experiencing this flux, com
ing to understand the sub
tleties and meanings of riding
a train, can take a single off
the-Farm outing or can be part
of a larger one.
But whenever you decide to
ride the rails, don't be unob
servant. Don't forget that
there's a 50-mile stretch of
track running down the Pen
insula that's a culture unto it
self.
