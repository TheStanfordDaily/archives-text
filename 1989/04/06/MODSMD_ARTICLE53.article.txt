# Restaurant reviews
## With levity and pasta for all 
### Susan McKean 
PASTA IS NOT straightfor
ward. Rotelli, tortcllini and
linguine invariably curl up in
the corner of your plate and
then around your spoon with
little attention to individual
tastes. Yet, from the lightest pesto to the
most gravity-laden alfredo, pasta in Palo
Alto can be as confusing and diverse as
the numbers of noodles themselves. Our
trio of pasta reviews will sort out some
of the zcstiest i.urly-cues in local Italian
dining, before you get wound up in a flat
and tasteless evening of your own.
Cenzo's
233 University Ave.
Pah Alto, CA 94305
322-1846
Despite the friendly, charmingly ac
cented waiter from"the south of Italy,
on the border of Oklahoma and Texas"
who treated us with the utmost courtesy
and respect, Cenzo's smacked of close
but-no-cigar.
Newly remodeled, Cenzo's lulls its din
ner guests into a Mediterranean of pale
green napkins, conspicuously attentive
waiters and mirrors multiplying low
ceilings and white walls.
Studcnthood here feels inappropriate,
somehow pretentious. They seem to be
playing at Italian, while we're playing at
sophistication. Unfortunately, Cenzo's
rips some of its new $40,000 Italian cos
tume by writing "soups of the day"in
English under Zuppe de Giorno and by
altering the native seasonings to appeal
to milder Bay Area tastes for example.
And shucking out large sums of money
to eat out somehow discredits our "poor
student" roles.
But eating out is often a deserved respite
from cafeteria malaise and on-campus
doldrums, and no restaurant should leave
a customer feeling out of place.
The best part was the bread. And that's
a very big plus. It's thin and garlicky,
fresh and addictive. They served delicious
iced tea, and appeared to have a large
assortment of wine. The menu is long
and varied. Plenty of regular offerings and
six daily specials. Unfortunately, they
were out of the one we wanted.
The antipasti include some assorted
meats, a variety of fried seafoods, vege
tables and salads. The Ditti de Mozzarella
— fried breaded mozzarella sticks with
marinara sauce — were tasty, although
not recommended for a first date. They're
too hot on the inside to make a graceful

bite possible. The salad was hearty, with
mixed greens and a tangy lemony dress
ing.
Art over utility, or presentation over
taste was the working formula for the
Linguine Pescadore: clams, mussels,
prawns, calamari and shrimp in a tomato
herb sauce without many herbs, spread
over linguinc ($10.95). The seafood, aside
from the shrimp, was rubbery and taste
less, and the pasta limply agreeable. None
theless, rather elegantly served.
Higher praise, and a rave review for the
sauce, goes for the selection from the list
of specials — Saltimbocca Alia Romana:
medallions of veal topped with prosciutto
and sage in a Madera sauce ($12.95).
This was served with fresh vegetables and
the starch of the day, a minimal portion
of rice.
Dessert was disappointingly American
— apple pie and cheesecakes. The
cheesecake resembled a sweetened brunch
bagel spread, and die apple pie should at
least have been warmed up. The coffee
came in a graceful glass, but tasted weak
and watery.

!n all, Cenzo's provides
efficient, hospitable serv
ice and a quiet, unhurried
atmosphere. Go there for
a long talk, when spices
and prices and sappy back
ground music fade insig
nificant.
The prices are fair
though excessive at the ex
tremes — appetizers,
desserts and drinks. Din
ners range from $6.95 to
$13.95.
La Pastaia Italian Cafe
420 Emerson St.
Palo Alto, CA
323-2464
La Pastaia evokes Italy
even for the untravcled.
Old photographs of Italian
farmers and antiquated
cities pepper the peach
colored walls. Strings of
braided garlic cloves and
vines arch over the simply
set tables. The rich tones
of Italian operas lilt
around the odd angles and
sleek glass corners of the
peaceful restaurant.
Service is prompt and
soft-spokenlv attentive.
Long fresh bread sticks
replace flowers as the table

ornament; they're only better than bread
in that they're too dry to cat too many
of them. But the succeeding courses are
worth leaving plenty of room for.
A white china bowl cradles creamy
tangy tomato soup with basil and small
chunks of tomato ($2.95), neither heavy
nor overpowering. The salad is generous
and topped with Romano cheese and an
herby vmagrette ($3.95), but is probably
a little too expensive for a tight budget.
The iced tea is replenished regularly,
as is the lemon-twisted water. At one
point, the iced tea attendant poured some
of a freshly-made batch into my glass.
Our waiter realized even before we did
that it would still be tepid and instantly
brought a glass of ice.
The menu is newly printed each night,
with a special menu of antipasti, primi,
secondi and dolci in addition to the sub
stantial regular menu. They offer plenty
of vegetarian dishes and unusual seafood
and meats.
