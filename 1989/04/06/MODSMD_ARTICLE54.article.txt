IF SOMETHING ISN'T BROKEN, don't fix it. If a dia
mond isn't Sunken, don't bother.
Baseball players themselves head for home. Follow
their example.
Stanford baseball is worth staying on the Farm for.
Ballgames off the Farm don't get a whole lot better. And
even if they do, the Sunken Diamond merits passing up the
thrill of 101 North.
The last thing you might notice about Sunken Diamond at
Stanford is that there's a baseball game going on there.
Certainly, the first time you make the turn off Galvez Street
and venture past Stanford Stadium to the ballpark, you probably
arc going to sec the two-time defending NCAA College World
Scries Champion Cardinal play. But after, as spring grows out
of winter and the weather changes to dry from .. . dry, you
may find yourself going back to Sunken Diamond — without
checking to see if there's a game first.
As a ballpark, it's adequate. As a park, it's a ball.
With the departure of Chicago's Wrigley Field for prime time,
Sunken Diamond is now the best bastion of no-lights baseball.
Constructed in 1931, years before the first night baseball game
was played, the park hasn't left that time behind.
The 1989 Stanford press guide would try to convince you
otherwise. For example, in describing the press box located
behind home plate, the program uses the term ultra-modern.
Don't believe it.
Ultra-modern at Sunken Diamond is a wooden shack that
looks as if it would immediately incinerate if a 79-cent Bic
lighter were held up to it. Take a spot poll of those familiar
with it and you're likely to come up with descriptions like
"spartan" and "shabby." They're a lot closer.
That's OK though. That's part of the Sunken Diamond
mystique, like stumbling upon a smoky, greasy diner and
knowing you've uncovered the best hamburger in town.
Plus, there's a little secret. The intelligent reporter doesn't
sit in the press box.
That's not for lack of fire extinguishers. That reporter, or in
fact, any habitue of Sunken Diamond automatically disdains
the first-base side of Sunken Diamond, with its seats. Rather,
they all head for the grass embankment on the third-base
side and make camp.
First of all, it's about 10 degrees warmer. Ritualized by the
afternoon starting times (2:30 p.m. on weekdays, 1 p.m. on
weekends), the sun faces you high above right field as the
first pitch is made, and cuts a line with Hoover Tower as it
descends behind the right-field fence.
Secondly, where else can you actually see a baseball game
while lying down? Thanks to the acute angle of the embank
ment, which has left Stanford researchers boggled at the
staying power of Woolworth portable lounge chairs, one can
repose upon the embankment and still grab a gander at the
goings-on afield.
The tendency is to take off your shirt (to the extent your
gender permits you), swathe yourself in suntan lotion, grab
something from your cooler if you are so inclined, lie down
and occasionally come up for air and updates on what's
happening in the game.
There are many different ways to go, however. People still
haven't forgotten the couple that brought the Yogi Bear picnic
basket, broke out the chablis and the wine glasses and acted
what's known in outside arenas as civilized. At Sunken Dia
mond, that's known as ultra-ultra-modern, and the memory
will survive long after the press box does.
