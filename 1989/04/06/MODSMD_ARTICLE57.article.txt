## An Ethiopian treasure-trove 
### Mia Manzulli 
Dahlak
921 East Duane Avenue
Sunnyvale
(408) 732-8444
AS THE MENU SAYS, Dahlak is "One of Life's
Great Adventures." And indeed this dim, little
restaurant serves unique African cuisine for those
in search of something a little bit out of the
ordinary.
Named for the Dahlak islands off the coast of
Africa, this place is a real find. What Dahlak lacks in decor,
it makes up for in delicious and well-prepared foods. As the
menu also says, Dahlak serves "healthful dishes from the Land
of Habishes."
Dahlak is located in an ordinary mini-shopping plaza some
where in Sunnyvale, right next door to a pizza place. It doesn't
jump right out at you, but once you get inside, you'll know
this isn't an ordinary restaurant.
Woven straw mats and large photographs of Africa decorate
the otherwise plain walls. The lighting is dim, the tables are
plain and the chairs are simple. But there's rhythmic music
playing and the waitresses dressed in native attire spice up the
otherwise dull atmosphere.
Everything at Dahlak is served family-style and if you've

never eaten this Ethiopian type of food, don't despair. The very
friendly waitresses will serve you and explain how to partake
in their cuisine.
All meals begin with a green salad that has a flax seed
dressing which is slightly gritty with a tasty nutty flavor. Or
you can order the delicious green lentil salad ($1.75) or one
of the other choices.

The main course is served with injera — no silverware
should be used for this authentic meal. Injera is the thin
spongy bread that you use to scoop up the food; it's thicker
than a tortilla, almost pancake like, and has a slightly sourdough
taste. Your waitress will bring you a platter of it with your
entree selections.
For your meal, you can choose between marinated meats
such as beef, pork, lamb and chicken which are cooked in
spicy vegetable sauces or any of the vegetarian selections. There
is even tripe for the truly adventurous.
You can order the meats and vegetables a combination platter
which is a great idea for a large group or if you're in the mood
for tasting. We tried the special which was a chicken with okra
and eggplant — it was quite tasty. The chicken in chili pepper
sauce is also very good. Marinades and sauces lend the meats
tenderness and flavor.
The vegetable dishes are all tempting ... we opted for the
shiro — a puree of chick peas and split peas, the tintimo —
peas and lentils with tomato and onions, and the spinach with
onion and tomato. The vegetables are well-blended and spiced
and, with the exception of the spinach, will remind you of
baby food.
But these veggies are far from being bland — they have
plenty of flavor and can be quite spicy. You'll want to sop up
every drop with your injera.
Dahlak has a small selection of beer and wines to accompany
your dinner. For those in the mood for adventure, try the
traditional honey wine. Just a warning — it's very sweet. Or
have a Tusker — an original African beer. Ordinary table wines
and American and German beer are also served if you prefer.
Perhaps one of the best reasons for going to Dahlak is that
you can enjoy a wonderful meal for an inexpensive price. No
item on the menu exceeds $6.50 — and you won't leave

hungry. Although Dahlak is a little bit off the beaten track,
you'll be glad you made the extra effort to find it.
The restaurant is open for lunch Monday through Friday,
11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m., and for dinner Thursday through Sunday
from 5:30 p.m. to 10 p.m.
To get to Dahlak, take Highway 101 South to the Lawrence
Expressway South exit. The first light is Duane Avenue. Take
a right on Duane and go a few blocks. Dahlak is located in
the shopping plaza on your right.
