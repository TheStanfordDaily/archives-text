## An Ethiopian treasure-trove 
### Mia Manzulli 
Dahlak
921 East Duane Avenue
Sunnyvale
(408) 732-8444
AS THE MENU SAYS, Dahlak is "One of Life's
Great Adventures." And indeed this dim, little
restaurant serves unique African cuisine for those
in search of something a little bit out of the
ordinary.
Named for the Dahlak islands off the coast of
Africa, this place is a real find. What Dahlak lacks in decor,
it makes up for in delicious and well-prepared foods. As the
menu also says, Dahlak serves "healthful dishes from the Land
of Habishes."
Dahlak is located in an ordinary mini-shopping plaza some
where in Sunnyvale, right next door to a pizza place. It doesn't
jump right out at you, but once you get inside, you'll know
this isn't an ordinary restaurant.
Woven straw mats and large photographs of Africa decorate
the otherwise plain walls. The lighting is dim, the tables are
plain and the chairs are simple. But there's rhythmic music
playing and the waitresses dressed in native attire spice up the
otherwise dull atmosphere.
Everything at Dahlak is served family-style and if you've

never eaten this Ethiopian type of food, don't despair. The very
friendly waitresses will serve you and explain how to partake
in their cuisine.
All meals begin with a green salad that has a flax seed
dressing which is slightly gritty with a tasty nutty flavor. Or
you can order the delicious green lentil salad ($1.75) or one
of the other choices.
