SAN FRANCISCO is a shopper's paradise. Union
Square, Ghiardelli Square, Union Street ... whether
you crave the selection of the luxury department
store or the eclectic finds of an intimate boutique,
the city is surely the place to satisfy your buying
desires.
Beyond the obvious shopping locations, however, is a wealth
of outlets that offer great clothes at an even better prices. Name
brands such as Gunne Sax and ESPRIT are available at a
discount if you know where to look.
Beware, however, that two of the mythological figures of
outletland, CP Shades and Banana Republic, are no longer part
of the 4th St.and Transit St. outlet area. CP Shades is now
in Berkeley and Banana Republic appears to have gone out of
business.
