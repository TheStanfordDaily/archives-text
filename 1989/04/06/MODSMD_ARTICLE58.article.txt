to the Gunne Sax Outlet. McClintock's Gunne Sax designs
are normally less expensive than her own label, and at the
outlet you can find some real bargains. If you're on the look
out for a spring formal dress, this is a great place to start.
The Gunne Sax outlet is located in a large warehouse, up
several stories by elevator. You may feel like you've stumbled
into a deserted building, but you're on the right track.
When you rcach Gunne Sax you'll be greeted by seemingly
endless rows of pastel colored evening wear — all in one large
room which takes up an entire floor of the warehouse.
The atmosphere differs considerably from the beautiful and
romantic Jessica McClintock boutique on Sutter, off Union
Square. But there is certainly plenty to choose from.
The selection is often seasonal and varies week to week, but
if you persevere, you'll find more than one thing you'll want
to try on.
Dresses are arranged on racks by size, not style so once you
find your section, it becomes a lot easier to sort things out.
Although most of the clothing is dressy, you can also find
nightgowns, bridal wear, lingerie and more casual sweater wear
around the perimeters of the room.
In addition to Gunne Sax, you may see some of Jessica
McClintock's own designs or some items from the Scott
McClintock collection. These arc often real bargains.
Make sure to try everything on before buying because some
pieces of clothing may be irregular or damaged. Lots of people
come to Gunne Sax, and consequently the merchandise gets
handled frequently. Check seams, lace, bows and zippers care
fully.

There is one large common dressing room on the right hand
side of die store and the number of items you may bring in
at one time is limited. But of course, you can keep on going
back with more.

8:30 am until 5:30 pm. Gunne Sax is also open on Sundays
from 11 a.m. until 5 p.m., although it is suggested that you
call first to make sure.
The prices at the Gunne Sax outlet are really a good deal
— especially considering the limited use one gets from dressy
apparel — and there is generally a large offering. A word to
the wise: Go on a weekday. Since many outlets are only open
on Saturdays, weekends tend to be very crowded.
ESPRIT Outlet
16th Street at Illinois Street

in most large department stores and ESPRIT boutiques around
the country.

comfortable and funky clothes, eye-catching accessories and
interesting shoes. Although the sportswear is not outrageously
expensive, some of ESPRIT's merchandise (particularly
sweaters) can get pricey. Try the outlet for reduced prices and
fun shopping.
Unlike many other outlets which are housed in old warehouse
style buildings, ESPRIT has its own ultra-modern store, with
a cafeteria right next door. It doesn't look like your typical
outlet bccausc it really isn't.
The layout is simple, attractive and easy to navigate. lust
grab a shopping cart when you enter and start looking. It's a
large expanse with clothing, shoes and accessories located in
separate sections.

fuschia seem to predominate, there is a wide variety and usually
a good selection of items.
Shoes and scarves and bags may be the best buys — they
are usually colorful, inventive and low-priced. Although the
clothing is marked down, the savings aren't always tremendous.
The ESPRIT Sport division can be more expensive than you
realize. Be careful . . . sometimes being in an outlet makes
people go crazy thinking they are getting great bargains. Check
the out-of-scason items for better buys.
The ESPRIT outlet can get very crowded, particularly on the
weekends. Because the label caters to the teenage set, there
will be a lot of families running around. There are plenty of
dressing rooms though, and the supermarket-style check-out
counters make paying go fairly quickly.

Outlet has plenty to offer. It's open Monday through Friday,
10 a.m. to 9 p.m., Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and

and fun clothes, you can make a day of it at ESPRIT.
