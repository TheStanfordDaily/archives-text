# Dead Heads face $25 price tag for charity concert at Stanford
## 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
If you were planning to rush out and
buy Grateful Dead tickets this year, you
better watch your speed.
The price tag on tickets for the May
6 and 7 shows in Frost Ampitheather
has risen to $25 for Stanford students
and $30 for faculty and staff. Last year's
tickets cost $16.50 and $18.50, respec
tively.
The band decided to raise the price so
that it could donate the profits from these
concerts to the Rex Foundation, a non
profit organization established in 1984
that contributes to creative endeavors in
the arts, sciences, education, social

change and healing.
The Board of Directors of the Rex
Foundation includes band members
Robert Weir and Jerry Garcia, concert
promoter Bill Graham and basketball star
and Stanford Law School alumnus Bill
Walton.
According to Steve Cramer, director of
Stanford's Concert Network, this year's
price hike "is not as large as it seems
since the Dead shows have had an average
price increase of $2 per year."
For safety reasons, the University of
ficials have reduced the capacity of Frost
from 9,500 to 9,000 persons, which would
have driven prices up regardless of the
fundraising, Cramer noted.'
"It's not like we're trying to make a

huge profit," said Mark Foxton of the
Concert Network. The Concert Network
and promoter Bill Graham will receive
their normal fee despite the ticket price
increase. The extra profits go directly to
the Grateful Dead, who in turn donate
their entire portion of the profits to the
Rex Foundation, according to Cramer.
The profits for concerts given at the
Greek Theatre at UC-Berkcley will also
go to the Rex Foundation, which was
named after deceased band member Rex
Jackson.
Some of the charities on the founda
tion's list include: the Childrens Cancer
Research Institute, the Peace Center of
Marin, the East Bay Activity Center, Cre
ating Our Future, the Nature Conser-

vancy, the Mainstream Foundation and
Children of the Night.
A University policy concerning smoking
will also be in effect at the concerts.
Approximately one-third of Frost will be
designated as a smoking area, while the
remaining two-thirds will be non
smoking. The policy went into effect last
year, "but they didn't have much luck
enforcing it," said Cheryl Hammitt, man

ager of the Tresidder Union Ticket Office.
The Grateful Dead shows have sold out
every year at Stanford. Cramer seeme I
confident that the higher price would not
affect sales dramatically.
A Concert Network worker noted that
of the nine shows played by the Dead at
Madison Square Garden in New York
City last summer, the ninth one also
benefited charity. Tickets alone cost $30,
but for a price of $100, a special charity
banquet was included in the package.
The Dead are part of the line-up for
the "Concert Against AIDS" May 27 in
Oakland Stadium. Huey Lewis and Thr
News, Tracy Chapman, Los Lobos and
others will perform as well. Tickets will
cost $25.
