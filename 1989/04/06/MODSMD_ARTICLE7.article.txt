## Does speech regulation breed greater silence? 
### Karin Lee Geetika Tandon 
"Should we be in the business
of regulating speech?" Law Prof.
Thomas Grey asked a standing
room-only audience yesterday as
four legal scholars grappled with
defining the limits of free speech
at Stanford.
In the wake of a cam pus-wide
debate over the interpretation of
the Fundamental Standard, Grey
and Law Prof. Charles Lawrence
defended the regulation of free
speech while Law Profs. William
Cohen and Gerald Gunther
argued that such restriction could
violate Constitutional rights.
Rather than discouraging re
sponse, people need to speak out
more against instances of racism,

Gunther argued. "Battle bad
speech with more and better
speech," he said
Responding to Gunther's call
for speaking out, Lawrence noted
that more speech does not always
result in constructive discussion.
Consequently, the University
should regulate speech to protect
the victims of racism, Lawrence
said. He added that harmful re
sponse can keep minorities from
speaking out.
Cohen said regulation would
further silence people rather than
encourage minorities to speak out.
He expressed his concern that
people of different cultures and
beliefs already fear discussing
sensitive issues. Speech regulation

and the proposal to change the
Fundamental Standard could
result in a "greater silence," he
said.
Lawrence emphasized that
before any progress can be made
in the area of discrimination, the
very real "nature of the injury"
inflicted by racist speech must be
examined. He argued that racist
speech, just as the "symbolic
speech of punching someone in
the nose," is unconstitutional.
Every day, minority children
face the painful stigma that they
are unfit, Lawrence said. Minor
ities also feel a "psychic injury"
and a "reputational injury" as a
result of the misuse of the First
Ammendment, ho said.
Law student Jean Andrews, a
member of the audience, agreed
with the "realness" of the injury
of such comments, explaining that
sexist comments can have the
same effect.
"Direct, inflammatory re
marks" are much more upsetting
than even "the general sexist en

vironment. They make me feel
much worse about myself — it's
more of an attack on my self
esteem," she said.
Drawing on the example of the
Supreme Court's ruling in Brown
v. Board of Education, Lawrence
explained that segregation con
veyed the message that black
people were inferior. The Supreme
Court declared segregation uncon
stituional based on this message,
thus regulating on the basis of
content rather than the actual
separation, he said.
Lawrence gave an example to
clarify when the University should
control the speech and actions of
students. He asked whether the
University should punish white
students if they painted their faces
black to single out a black student.
Grey also presented the Student
Conduct and Legislative Council's
draft proposal to change the Fun
damental Standard. The panel and
audience raised concern that the

"Direct, inflammatory
remarks" are much
more upsetting than
even "the general
sexist environment."

SCLC defined punishable racist
speech too narrowly.
He reminded the crowd of the
basic issue of the campus-wide
debate over the Fundamental
Standard: "There are important
principles on both sides ... free
dom of speech and nondiscrimina
tion."
Gunther said the solution to the
problem of bigotry on campus is
not repression of "misguided" but
well-meaning people and con
tended that a sense of outrage
over discrimination and damage
does not justify repression.
