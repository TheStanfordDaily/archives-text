## Does speech regulation breed greater silence? 
### Karin Lee Geetika Tandon 
"Should we be in the business
of regulating speech?" Law Prof.
Thomas Grey asked a standing
room-only audience yesterday as
four legal scholars grappled with
defining the limits of free speech
at Stanford.
In the wake of a cam pus-wide
debate over the interpretation of
the Fundamental Standard, Grey
and Law Prof. Charles Lawrence
defended the regulation of free
speech while Law Profs. William
Cohen and Gerald Gunther
argued that such restriction could
violate Constitutional rights.
Rather than discouraging re
sponse, people need to speak out
more against instances of racism,

Gunther argued. "Battle bad
speech with more and better
speech," he said
Responding to Gunther's call
for speaking out, Lawrence noted
that more speech does not always
result in constructive discussion.
Consequently, the University
should regulate speech to protect
the victims of racism, Lawrence
said. He added that harmful re
sponse can keep minorities from
speaking out.
Cohen said regulation would
further silence people rather than
encourage minorities to speak out.
He expressed his concern that
people of different cultures and
beliefs already fear discussing
sensitive issues. Speech regulation
