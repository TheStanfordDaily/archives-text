This year, TAs have organized activities such as a Soviet film series, a
Slavic restaurant, and visits from Stanford faculty and other prominent
speakers. TAs work closely with the RF, RA, and residents to plan and
coordinate house programs and activities, and are given an exempt spot
in the house. If you are interested, please call Jehanne (327-3380) or
Kathy (322-2354). Deadline for applications is April 12.
