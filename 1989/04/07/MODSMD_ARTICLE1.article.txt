# Webb Ranch workers vote to join USW
## 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
In an overwhelming 36-5 vote at Webb Ranch
yesterday, the agricultural workers there elected to
join the United Stanford Workers as full-fledged
members of the union.
"There was some sparring over who (could) vote
but not enough to affect the outcome," said USW
field representative Michael Tatham, explaining that
Webb management objected to allowing some of the
workers to vote — claiming the laborers hadn't
worked on the ranch long enough.
Webb Ranch owners and management were un
available for comment yesterday.
According to Tatham, since the workers are now
part of the union, ranch management will be forced
to negotiate a contract with its laborers.
A union committee will survey the workers to
determine which issues they should focus on in the
negotiations with ranch management, Tatham said.
Speaking in Spanish, ranch worker Martin Luna
said approximately 90 percent of the laborers believe
the union will help ensure better conditions and
benefits for the workers, including health and dental
care. Currently, workers receive neither benefit.
"I think the most important aspect of becoming
a part of the union is that it should help us receive
higher salaries and better living conditions," Luna
said.
According to USW field representative Reuben
Serna, "This is the most important day of their
lives. It is a chance for them to determine their
own destiny."
