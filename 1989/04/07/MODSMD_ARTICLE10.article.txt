# Bush implicated in Contra scandal
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
document produced at Oliver
North's trial yesterday
depicted George Bush — for
the first time — as helping
carry out the Reagan adminis
tration's secret program to sus
tain the Nicaraguan Contras
when Congress had forbidden
U.S. aid.
Then-Vice President Bush
served as an intermediary for
President Reagan in assuring
the president of Honduras in
the spring of 1985 of expedited
U.S. military and economic aid,
according to a 42-page "admis
sion of facts" agreed to by the
government and read to the
jury by North's defense attor
neys.
The document established a
"quid pro quo" relationship be
tween continuing third-country
assistance to the Contras and
the availability of U.S. assis
tance to those countries. But
Bush was not described in the
document as having cited such
a linkage in his May 1985 meet
ing with then-President
Roberto Suazo of Honduras.
The document, nevertheless,
revealed Bush as actually play
ing a role in the effort to keep
the Contras alive as a fighting
force during the period of the
Boland Amendment prohibition
on American involvement. This
is a portrait of Bush that never
emerged in the final Iran-
Contra investigative reports by

a presidential review board and
a joint congressional commit
tee.
Asked yesterday about the
revelation of Bush's go
between role with the Hon
duran leader who was being
pressed by the United States
to continue helping the Con
tras, White House press secre
tary Marlin Fitzwater said:
"We can't say anything. It
would become a part of the
case."
Both the presidential com
mission, headed by former Sen.
John Tower, R-Texas, and the
congressional panels found no
meaningful role by Bush in the
scandal that resulted from the
covert sales of U.S. arms to
Iran and the subsequent diver
sion of the proceeds to the
Nicaraguan resistance fighters.
Bush has said that he sup
ported Reagan's Iranian arms
sale initiative, but that he
voiced reservations about what
would happen if it ever became
public.
Portions of the document
read yesterday did, however,
show Bush as an enthusiastic
supporter of the effort to tide
over the Contras until direct
U.S. assistance could be
resumed.
Bush has denied ever having
any knowledge of a diversion
of arms-sales proceeds to the
Contras.
