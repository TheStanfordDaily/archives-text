Gorbachev, Thatcher hold talks
LONDON (AP) — Mikhail Gorbachev and
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher argued pas
sionately yesterday in talks that covered disarma
ment and weapons sales to the Middle East,
officials said.
The leaders described their private morning
talks as friendly, but a British spokesman said
they argued energetically over the Soviets' re
ported sale of long-range bombers to Libya or a
possible negotiated ban on chemical weapons.
A Soviet spokesman said Gorbachev complained
to Thatcher, a staunch U.S. ally, that President
Bush's review of foreign policy is threatening to
stall the momentum of nuclear arms reduction
talks.
In a toast at a dinner honoring Gorbachev,
Thatcher made clear she is unshaken in her belief
that at least some nuclear weapons are necessary
to deter war in Europe. Gorbachev replied he
could not accept that view.
He said the prime minister considers him a
romantic for advocating a nuclear-free world, but

he contended his position "reflects the harsh
realities of our time."
Brazil plans to protect rain forest
BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — President Jose Sar
ney announced a plan yesterday to protect the
Amazon rain forest and castigated those who
make the "cruel and unfair" charge that Brazil
is destroying the world's largest wilderness.
"We are accused of something we cannot accept,
of destroying our own territory," Sarney said in
announcing the program called "Our Nature."
"Our priority is the conservation of our ecologi
cal heritage," he said, and described the 2 million
square miles of rain forest is "Brazil's sovereign
patrimony."
Charges of environmental destruction are
"cruel and unfair, full of scientific falsehoods that
misinform the world," Sarney said. Politicians,
scientists and ambassadors from neighboring
South American countries attended the ceremony.
Ecologists say destruction of the rain forest
adds to the "greenhouse effect," a warming trend
that is changing the planet's weather.
