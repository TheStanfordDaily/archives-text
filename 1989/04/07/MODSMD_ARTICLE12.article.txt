## South African president's likely successor viewed as more flexible

JOHANNESBURG, South
Africa (AP) — President P.W.
Botha, South Africa's strong
willed leader since 1978, yester
day announced his intention to
retire after elections to be held
by September.
His party had made clear it
wanted a new president.
Botha, whose grip on power
began to loosen after a stroke in
January, told Parliament that an
early general election will be held
on an unspecified date within the
next five months.
Botha, 73, did not state explic
itly that he would retire, but he
said the outgoing president would
hand over the official seal to a
new president following the elec
tions.
The new president is expected
to be Education Minister F.W. de
Klerk, who succeeded Botha as
leader of the National Partv on

Feb. 2. Many Nationalists view
de Klerk as more flexible than
Botha and more capable of break
ing the country's black-white po
litical stalemate.
The state-controlled South
African Broadcasting Corp., in a
commentary to be broadcast
today, said Botha "made it clear
he did not intend to stand for
another term."
Botha "now enters the last
months of a political career that
has spanned more than a half
century," the commentary said.
He has presided over the coun
try's worst racial unrest and
deepest international isolation but
also its most ambitious race re
forms and foreign policy initia
tives, including plans for the in
dependence of Namibia.
Botha said he would dissolve
Parliament in May and then set
a date for the election. The voting

is expected to take place between
July 24 and Sept. 6
After the election, an electoral
college dominated by the majority
party in the white chamber of
South Africa's racially separate
Parliament — virtually certain to
be Botha's National Party — will
choose the new president.
There would then be a cere
mony "where the seal of the
republic would be handed over to
him by the outgoing state presi
dent," Botha told a joint session
of Parliament in Cape Town.
De Klerk grinned as he emerged
from Parliament but told
reporters: "I have no statement
to make."
Botha returned to work in
March after spending eight weeks
recuperating from his stroke while
his official duties were carried out
by an acting president, Constitu
tional Development Minister
Chris Heunis.
