March at Sacramento
signals commitment to
basic educational rights

WITH A DELUGE of buses
and concerned students,
the deficiencies of the
California educational system
and the drought of political ac
tivism will be dealt a needed blow
on Monday.
And hundreds of Stanford stu
dents are part of the action.
Joining thousands of students
from across the state, Stanford
students will descend upon
Sacramento for Spring Action '89
â€” a march, rally and lobby day
for educational reform.
All Stanford students should
seize the opportunity to demon
strate for improved California
public education and climb on
board one of the four buses
leaving for the day in Sacramento
at 7 a.m. Monday from the Tres
idder parking lot.
Spring Action is a statewide
expression of many of the ten
sions concerning issues of minor
ity life and multicultural educa
tion that have racked Stanford
in the recent past.
This event complements and re
inforces Stanford's tradition of
public service and engages the
University community in impor
tant issues beyond the palms.
The future of Stanford as a
healthy, diverse community and
multicultural educational institu
tion is inseparable from the fu
ture of public education in
America.
Spring Action is calling on Cal
ifornia to set an example for
other school systems to ensure
equal educational opportunity for

all Americans.
Too often our generation is cas
tigated for apathy and lack of
participation or concern for
others. The impressive mobiliza
tion of Stanford students to make
a forceful statement in favor of
more multicultural education dis
credits that description.
Spring Action addresses the
shameful state of public educa
tion for peoples of color in Cali
fornia. The majority of students
in grades K-12 are minorities,
and the state's population will
soon follow suit. But fewer than
1.5 percent of black and
Chicano/Latino kindergartners
will end up getting a college
degree.
And the high dropout rate in
dicates the dismal failure of the
system to accommodate students
of color and encourage their pur
suit of higher education.
Moreover, more than a third
of Stanford students hail from
California, and California ranks
near the bottom of all state ed
ucational systems. This alone is
cause for concern.
Stanford is not immune from
the demographic and socio
economic changes going on
around us. Racial events this past
year have demonstrated the dif
ficulty of building a truly har
monious multicultural environ
ment even on a campus level.
Stanford students are to be
commended for extending the les
sons and questions learned on
campus to issues of state and
public concern.
In organizing Spring Action,
the ASSU hearteningly has found
a swell of community support,
with funds coming from dorms,
student groups, more than six de
partments and at least as many
offices and individuals.
