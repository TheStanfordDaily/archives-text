## Give Greeks a chance 
### 
Fraternities and sororities get
a bad rap on the Stanford campus.
They are the butt of many jokes
and the scapegoats for the big problems
on campus: racism, sexism, elitism, al
coholism.
Let me state for the record that I am
neither a sorority nor a fraternity mem
ber and don't plan to rush any time in
the future.
I am willing to concede that the broth
ers and sisters of the Stanford Greek
system are not saints. Specific instances
come to mind when fraternity or sorority
members have showed poor judgment.
Events such as the Kappa Kappa
Gamma pow-wow of last year and the
SAE "masturbation incident" (which I
will for the moment assume was a real
occurence as reported in The Daily) are
examples of this type of behavior.
I am not apologizing for those in
stances. I do not deny that fraternities
at their worst leave something to be
desired. In fact, I have found myself
denouncing fraternities and sororities on
occasion.
But I believe that the Greek system is
not fundamentally flawed and can be a
very positive influence on campus. The
problems the system faces are neither
insurmountable nor unforgivable.
Unlike many members of the Stanford
community, I believe the way to address
the problems of the Greek system is not
to drag it down or kick it off campus.
Forcing fraternities out of their houses
or persecuting sororities in an attempt
to discourage membership will not solve

the problem; it will merely drive it into
hiding.
Rather than bemoaning the real and
imagined problems of Stanford's Greek
system, critics should think about work
ing with and within the system to
facilitate change.
Join fraternities and make them better.
I urge the class of 1992 to take a good
look at the Greek system, not with the
rose-colored glasses of freshmen but with
the critical eye of Stanford students.
Recognize that the system does have
problems and be willing to confront those
problems as a member rather than an
outsider.
Fraternities and sororities may be
sexist, racist or elitist (although I think
those epithets are too strong), but they
will not change unless a broad section of
the Stanford student body gives them a
chance.
The present members of fraternities
and sororities share the responsibility for
improving the system. They should be
willing to admit that some things need
to change within the system. There is
much that is good and little that is bad;
members must work to eliminate the bad.
The defensive attitude of some mem
bers and their unwillingness to allow im
provements within the system has been
one source of the friction between the
Stanford community and its Greek
citizens.
Another problem has been the over
sensitivity of University officials and the
tendency to jump on the bandwagon and
bash fraternities and sororities.
University officials say they are willing

to work with the Greek system to see
that it remains viable. The Intersorority
Council and the Interfraternity Council
must force the University to live up to
this promise and utilize the opportunity
it presents to them.
In addition, members must be willing
to present an accurate image of what
being a Greek means to potential rushees
and work with them to accomodate new
ideas.
To rushees, I would say, "Have fun
during Rush, party like mad, but realize
that the Greek system means more than
a good party and deserves commitment
to its preservation."
