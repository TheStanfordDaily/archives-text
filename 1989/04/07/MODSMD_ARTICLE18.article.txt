## Stanford has only a limited role in Webb Ranch 
### 
I APPRECIATED HEARING from
Chip Bartlett, Xavier Briggs and
their fellow resident assistants, and
I understand their immediate concern
about the wages and general employ
ment conditions of Webb Ranch's
farmworkers as they have been de
scribed in the press.
Yet my responsibilities oblige me to
understand the facts as completely as I
can before determining what steps, if
any, are truly the right ones to take. I
have too often found that what truly
appears to be the right course of ac
tion in fact turns out to produce just
the opposite of what was intended.
This is particularly true in vexing
cases like Webb Ranch where the
actual roles of the players might not
be readily apparent. As an example, the
RAs call upon the University to "han
dle" this matter, presumably by exer
cising a direct hand in the wages and
living conditions of Webb Ranch's
employees.
Yet our necessary starting point is
that Stanford is not the employer of
those agricultural workers, any more
than it is the employer of the many
people who work for the many busi
nesses — from secretarial services to
construction outfits — with which
Stanford contracts. The same is true
for those who work for the many
businesses that operate as lessees on
Stanford properties like the Stanford
Shopping Coiter or the Research Park.
Stanford actually cannot determine
the employment practices of all those
contractors and lessees and then im
pose higher standards than are re
quired by law.
In short, Webb Ranch management is
the employer of the ranch employees
whose circumstances deserve scrutiny.
Webb's legal relationship to Stanford is
as one of the University's many lessees
and contractors. In this framework,

Stanford does, as a terra of its lease,
require Webb Ranch to comply fully
with all laws applicable to their activi
ties on the premises — including, as I
will discuss below, employment laws.
Still, the actual responsibility for
determining whether a business, such
as Webb, is in legal compliance rests
with other parties — in this case, with
governmental agencies: primarily, the
San Mateo County Department of
Environmental Health regarding Webb
employee housing, plus several state
and federal government boards regard
ing other employment issues.
What then can the University rea
sonably do in response to the type of
health and safety allegations made
against Webb Ranch management?
First, we can express our deep concern
about them to our tenant, and we have
done so both by letter and in person.
We have also cooperated — and will
continue to cooperate — fully with any
agencies in their efforts to determine
legal compliance on the part of the
ranch.
Since these allegations came to light
in mid-February, the County Depart
ment of Environmental Health has
conducted two inspections. The first
resulted in multiple health and safety
citations, most of which, however, were
described by the inspector as relatively
minor. The follow-up inspection, con
ducted quite recently, showed that
two-thirds of the citations had already
been remedied and that the others are
being worked on by the ranch.
Although it appears that Webb
Ranch is moving promptly to comply
with the law, the County will perform
another follow-up investigation very
soon to assess this and to review a
formal plan by Webb Ranch manage
ment to finish the process.
We, too, will ask Webb Ranch man
agement to show us their plan for

maintaining compliance. Moreover,
Stanford will reinforce with Webb
Ranch management — and, for that
matter, with any tenant — that com
pliance with all applicable laws is a
term of its lease and therefore a pri
mary consideration in our maintaining
or renewing such a lease.
Based on its past performance and
its response to recent events, my sense
is that Webb Ranch will soon show
itself to be in legal compliance by way
of employment practices and environ
mental safety. But should Webb Ranch
management do more? That question
— and, more specifically, what part
Stanford might play — is the one
Bartlett, Briggs and the other RAs
have put to me next.
Here we might all agree — indeed,
hope — that measurable improvements
could be made by the ranch. But what,
both for the employees and their em
ployer, is fair and equitable? For better
or worse, that question moves beyond
the more objective standards set by
law, into additional questions that are
far more subjective and economically
complex.
Is it really known, for instance, how
the conditions at Webb Ranch compare
with standards for the state's farming
industry as a whole? How much above
the industry standard is it reasonable
to ask this employer to be? Who, if
any, of the various interested individ
uals and groups should determine what
is acceptable?
These very difficult matters are,
both by practice and tradition, best
resolved between the affected parties —
the employees and their employer.
Quite often, assuming the employees
elect to do so, that process is pursued
through collective bargaining, with the
employees represented by the union
they have chosen.
The University certainly supports the

free choice of Webb Ranch employees
in this matter, and if the employees
elect unionization, then the University
would also expect and encourage good
faith collective bargaining on both
sides.
Which brings me to the events that
have developed since Bartlett and
Briggs wrote. During this interval,
Webb Ranch management, the United
Stanford Workers and Webb Ranch
employees have been negotiating a
process for employee representation
and collective bargaining — and,
indeed, they are the appropriately
involved parties.
As of March 31, I understand that
the union and Webb Ranch have
reached an agreement to hold an elec
tion for Webb Ranch employees regard
ing representation and certain housing
issues. Again, that is as it should be. If
that election leads to collective bargain
ing, then it is legaily mandated that
matters of fair wages and reasonable
living conditions will be negotiated.
We might as a general community
consider additional efforts that could
be undertaken — perhaps particularly
through the Public Service Center —
to the benefit of Webb Ranch's employ
ees and their families.
This latter sort of involvement, as
opposed to involvement in the negotia
tion of wages and conditions, is more
consistent with the University's mis
sion as an educational institution.
I would like to note, finally, a lesson
or two that we might draw from these
events. One is that facts and fairness
should always determine action. The
other is that the apparently slower
process of gaining an understanding
may, in the end, prevent damage to
people who might actually have suf
fered as a result of our first inclina
tions to act on their behalf.

consider additional efforts that could
be undertaken — perhaps particularly
through the Public Service Center —
to the benefit of Webb Ranch's employ
ees and their families.
This latter sort of involvement, as
opposed to involvement in the negotia
tion of wages and conditions, is more
consistent with the University's mis
sion as an educational institution.
I would like to note, finally, a lesson
or two that we might draw from these
events. One is that facts and fairness
should always determine action. The
other is that the apparently slower
process of gaining an understanding
may, in the end, prevent damage to
people who might actually have suf
fered as a result of our first inclina
tions to act on their behalf.
Donald Kennedy

I APPRECIATED HEARING from
Chip Bartlett, Xavier Briggs and
their fellow resident assistants, and
I understand their immediate concern
about the wages and general employ
ment conditions of Webb Ranch's
farmworkers as they have been de
scribed in the press.
Yet my responsibilities oblige me to
understand the facts as completely as I
can before determining what steps, if
any, are truly the right ones to take. I
have too often found that what truly
appears to be the right course of ac
tion in fact turns out to produce just
the opposite of what was intended.
This is particularly true in vexing
cases like Webb Ranch where the
actual roles of the players might not
be readily apparent. As an example, the
RAs call upon the University to "han
dle" this matter, presumably by exer
cising a direct hand in the wages and
living conditions of Webb Ranch's
employees.
Yet our necessary starting point is
that Stanford is not the employer of
those agricultural workers, any more
than it is the employer of the many
people who work for the many busi
nesses — from secretarial services to
construction outfits — with which
Stanford contracts. The same is true
for those who work for the many
businesses that operate as lessees on
Stanford properties like the Stanford
Shopping Coiter or the Research Park.
Stanford actually cannot determine
the employment practices of all those
contractors and lessees and then im
pose higher standards than are re
quired by law.
In short, Webb Ranch management is
the employer of the ranch employees
whose circumstances deserve scrutiny.
Webb's legal relationship to Stanford is
as one of the University's many lessees
and contractors. In this framework,

Stanford does, as a terra of its lease,
require Webb Ranch to comply fully
with all laws applicable to their activi
ties on the premises — including, as I
will discuss below, employment laws.
Still, the actual responsibility for
determining whether a business, such
as Webb, is in legal compliance rests
with other parties — in this case, with
governmental agencies: primarily, the
San Mateo County Department of
Environmental Health regarding Webb
employee housing, plus several state
and federal government boards regard
ing other employment issues.
What then can the University rea
sonably do in response to the type of
health and safety allegations made
against Webb Ranch management?
First, we can express our deep concern
about them to our tenant, and we have
done so both by letter and in person.
We have also cooperated — and will
continue to cooperate — fully with any
agencies in their efforts to determine
legal compliance on the part of the
ranch.
Since these allegations came to light
in mid-February, the County Depart
ment of Environmental Health has
conducted two inspections. The first
resulted in multiple health and safety
citations, most of which, however, were
described by the inspector as relatively
minor. The follow-up inspection, con
ducted quite recently, showed that
two-thirds of the citations had already
been remedied and that the others are
being worked on by the ranch.
Although it appears that Webb
Ranch is moving promptly to comply
with the law, the County will perform
another follow-up investigation very
soon to assess this and to review a
formal plan by Webb Ranch manage
ment to finish the process.
We, too, will ask Webb Ranch man
agement to show us their plan for

maintaining compliance. Moreover,
Stanford will reinforce with Webb
Ranch management — and, for that
matter, with any tenant — that com
pliance with all applicable laws is a
term of its lease and therefore a pri
mary consideration in our maintaining
or renewing such a lease.
Based on its past performance and
its response to recent events, my sense
is that Webb Ranch will soon show
itself to be in legal compliance by way
of employment practices and environ
mental safety. But should Webb Ranch
management do more? That question
— and, more specifically, what part
Stanford might play — is the one
Bartlett, Briggs and the other RAs
have put to me next.
Here we might all agree — indeed,
hope — that measurable improvements
could be made by the ranch. But what,
both for the employees and their em
ployer, is fair and equitable? For better
or worse, that question moves beyond
the more objective standards set by
law, into additional questions that are
far more subjective and economically
complex.
Is it really known, for instance, how
the conditions at Webb Ranch compare
with standards for the state's farming
industry as a whole? How much above
the industry standard is it reasonable
to ask this employer to be? Who, if
any, of the various interested individ
uals and groups should determine what
is acceptable?
These very difficult matters are,
both by practice and tradition, best
resolved between the affected parties —
the employees and their employer.
Quite often, assuming the employees
elect to do so, that process is pursued
through collective bargaining, with the
employees represented by the union
they have chosen.
The University certainly supports the

free choice of Webb Ranch employees
in this matter, and if the employees
elect unionization, then the University
would also expect and encourage good
faith collective bargaining on both
sides.
Which brings me to the events that
have developed since Bartlett and
Briggs wrote. During this interval,
Webb Ranch management, the United
Stanford Workers and Webb Ranch
employees have been negotiating a
process for employee representation
and collective bargaining — and,
indeed, they are the appropriately
involved parties.
As of March 31, I understand that
the union and Webb Ranch have
reached an agreement to hold an elec
tion for Webb Ranch employees regard
ing representation and certain housing
issues. Again, that is as it should be. If
that election leads to collective bargain
ing, then it is legaily mandated that
matters of fair wages and reasonable
living conditions will be negotiated.
We might as a general community
consider additional efforts that could
be undertaken — perhaps particularly
through the Public Service Center —
to the benefit of Webb Ranch's employ
ees and their families.
This latter sort of involvement, as
opposed to involvement in the negotia
tion of wages and conditions, is more
consistent with the University's mis
