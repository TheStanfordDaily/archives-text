Stanford plans to have a $2 million op
erating budget deficit next year, Provost
James Rosse told the Faculty Senate yes
terday.
Total operating expenses for the next
fiscal year are set at $386.5 million, an
8.8 percent increase over this year. The
operating budget consists of the Universi
ty's mEyor academic and administrative
costs, including teaching salaries,
departmental expenses and financial aid.
If the Board of Trustees accepts the pro
posal, the budget deficit would be Stan
ford's first since 1977. The budget will be
presented at the Trustees' meeting Monday.
In a 92-page budget guidebook sent to
the trustees and Faculty Senate members,
Rosse blamed the deficit primarily on
several "unexpected events," including a
decrease in government research spending,
large health and safety expenses, and the
high costs of acquiring new faculty, facili
ties and equipment.
However, Rosse told the senate that there
is "some chance we'll be able to balance"
the budget. A $1.5 million surplus is
forecast for next year's "conditional
budget," creating a total budget deficit of
less than $500,000. The conditional budget
includes income sources and expenses that
are uncertain and generally transitory.
The proposed budget is unusual because
the operating budget is normally balanced
and there is traditionally a small deficit in
the conditional budget, Rosse said.

In yesterday's senate meeting, Rosse
noted that the $2 million figure was down
from a $14.15 million deficit projection
made in January.
The Provost's office slashed more than
$12 million from the deficit by planning
measures to both increase income and
reduce expenses, Rosse said. These meas
ures included cutting library purchases and
planned salary and benefit increases for
employees.
In a more controversial move, student
tuition was increased by 8 percent instead
of the planned 6.5 percent, creating an
additional $1.68 million of income.
In his remarks to the senate, Rosse
placed the operating budget deficit in the
context of Stanford's gargantuan general
budgets. A budget deficit of $2 million is
only slightly more than one-tenth of 1 per
cent of the $1.4 billion combined budget
of all the University's schools.
According to an article in the San Jose
Mercury News, the operating budget
shortfall will be paid out of the University's
unrestricted reserve funds, which total
about $30 million.
Before he even presented the budget,
Rosse predicted there would be some con
fusion as to why there is a deficit at all.
In the introductory paragraph to the pro
posed budget, Rosse said, "To many, the
prospect of Stanford running a deficit
budget will appear puzzling.... It is not
immediately apparent how an institution
