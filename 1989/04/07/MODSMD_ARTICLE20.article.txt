Improve education:
join Monday march
in Sacramento
There is a crisis in California educa
tion today — one we must work to
gether to address. The dropout rate for
all high school students is 28 percent,
while Pacific Islander, Filipino, black,
Chicano and American Indian students
are dropping out at rates greater than
50 percent.
Last year, California ranked 49th
out of 50 in class size and 46th in the
nation for per capita spending on edu
cation. For students planning on at
tending four-year institutions, Califor
nia financial aid grants have been cut
in half between 1975-1985.
These staggering statistics come at a
time when the mtyority of students in
the public schools are students of color
and one out of six students in Califor
nia is foreign-bom.
The African/Black Statewide Student
Alliance, Statewide Movimiento Es-

tudiantil Chicano de Aztlan and the
Asian/Pacific Islander Student Union
have organized Spring Action '89 to
address critical educational issues.
Spring Action is a statewide march,
rally and lobby day in Sacramento to
support educational reform legislation;
it provides a real opportunity to con
tribute to improving education in Cali
fornia.
We support the work of the
statewide student networks and their
affiliated Stanford groups — the Black
Student Union, Asian-American Student
Association, MEChA and the Stanford
American Indian Organization — as
important contributors to the quest for
solutions to this educational crisis.
Through such large projects as the
1987 March on Sacramento and the
1988 Education Conference here at
Stanford, these organizations have
shown their desire and ability to work
with broad groups of students, teach
ers, parents and concerned community
members to build a brighter future for
education in California.
We are proud that Stanford students
have played an active role in improving
the lives of others by serving their

communities and working for positive
social change.
This history of service reflects the
goals and ideals of our university and
community. From tutoring in East
Palo Alto to working for curricular and
public policy reform, Stanford students
continue to use their education, re
sources and skills to help build a bet
ter society and future for us all.
If you are concerned about the fu
ture of education in California, we
urge you to participate in Spring Ac-

tion '89 next Monday, April 10 in
Sacramento.

Persecution can
afflict anyone
during any time
Looking though the Classifieds in the
March 4 Daily, I saw an ad asking
"Are the gas chambers a hoax?" I
thought this questioning of the exis
tence of the Holocaust to be prepos
terous.
Upon reading the Opinions page,
however, I found the opinion may be
more widespread than I had previously
imagined. According to Lyzette Settle,
"white males have not been dis
enfranchised, enslaved, exploited, ...
sent to internment camps."
Also, how about the Irish under
British rule in the 19th century? Or
Christians under Moslems in Spain

during the Middle Ages? Or the White
Russians under Stalin? Or the Slavs
under the Ottoman Empire? Or the
Rus under the Mongols? Or the Ar
menians under the Turks?
