## Bug thinks Chrissy can help save us all 
### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
It has often been said that life's
greatest lessons can be learned
from reruns of "Three's Compa
ny." Indeed, recent controversy on
this campus may have been
avoided if we had all been taking
time out at 6 p.m. weekdays to
spend half an hour with Jack,
Chrissy and Janet.
The predominant evil in their
household was miscommunica
tion. A little misunderstanding
here, a little overheard word
there, and suddenly the paradise
of this loving threesome was
flooded with the hell of chaos.
Unfortunately, many Americans
have never understood the subtle
implications of this brilliantly stu
pid situation-comedy.
Case in point: When a group of
students yelled "Grad students go
home!" at the final Sunday Flicks
of last quarter, some people ap
parently heard the jeer as "Black
students go home!" So, a protest
against such sentiment was sent
to The Daily and printed on Mon
day's Opinions page.
Although a letter in Tuesday's
Daily helped clear things up, the
Bug believes a number of other
student groups may have mis
heard "Grad students go home!"
and also been justifiably dis
mayed.
For example, I, myself, thought
the students had yelled "Bad stu
dents go home!" and so immedi
ately packed my bags and left
campus, missing my finals and
postponing my graduation by one
quarter.
Questions and comments can be
dropped off at the Daily offices

or sent through LOTS to B.bug
me. And, incidentally, any infor
mation concerning "Polly and
Jake's," the "antique store" on
the corner of Page Mill and El
Camino, would be greatly appre
ciated.
Dear Bug,
Why is it that maps of Stanford
tend to be oriented with the south
pointing up, instead of north ?
— Dashiell Ham mett
It's cause visitors to campu.-
tend to be traveling south up Un>
versity Avenue or Embarcadero
Road. If the usual north orients
tion were maintained, everybody
would have to turn the map
around in order to make their left
the map's left, if you see what I
don't mean.
Until next week.
