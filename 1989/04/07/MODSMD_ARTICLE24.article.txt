## Baseball to be tested at ASU 
### Robert Portnoy Senior staff writer 
Imagine 100-degree heat. Imagine a
launching pad for a ballpark. Imagine
a team with a .313 batting average and
3.63 ERA. Imagine heckling fans that
get on you from the opening pitch and
don't let up. Imagine opposing players
who heckle you from the opening pitch
and don't let up.
That's what the Cardinal baseball
team (17-18, 5-10 in the Pacific 10
Southern Division) faces this weekend
when it travels to Tempe to take on
the No. 5 Arizona State Sun Devils
(30-10, 11-4).
With Stanford recovering from a dis
astrous start to the season, this weekend
will indicate just how far back the two
time defending national champion has
come.
When the Devils made their annual
visit to Sunken Diamond the first week
end in March, they took no prisoners.
Sweeping the series by scores of 10-2,
10-6 and 7-2, ASU received some con
solation for its loss to Stanford in last
year's NCAA title game. With no room
for a letdown, ASU is ready to pour
salt in the wound.
The Devils are locked in a duel for
first place with in-state rival Arizona.
The Wildcats trail ASU by just a game
and host the conference punching bag,
UCLA, placing them in position to pick
up some ground.
The Cardinal is coming off its first
series win in Six-Pac play. Last weekend
at home Stanford twice pounded
nationally-ranked USC, and the Cardi
nal has hit .389 over its last five games,
hammering out 10 homers in that
stretch.
But playing in Tempe's Packard Sta
dium is no picnic. The Devils have a

22-10 record against Stanford in their
yard and swept the Cardinal there last
season. Put simply, nothing about Pack
ard is very friendly.
"I try to ignore [the fans]. Sometimes
when you're not going well, it gets to
you. Some of it is funny, if you keep
the right attitude. It's a lot funnier
when you're going well," Cardinal des
ignated hitter Tim Griffin said.
Competing with the fans for the
banter crown will be the ASU players.
When last these two teams met, Devil
players were warned on several occa
sions to make their insults less personal.
"I kind of expect it from them. All
the teams can get on you. So far they've
probably been the worst. It makes you
want to beat them more, but if you let

it get to you too much, that's what they
want. Plus, down there the umpires
won't stop it. I don't like that stuff,"
Griffin said.
What about the ballpark, Tim?
"If we keep hitting, we'll be alright.
The ball carries well. If your ofTense is
going well, you're going to score a lot
of runs down there," he said.
With 100-degree temperatures in
Tempe all week, the Cardinal should
have no trouble staying hot. Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess has driven his
team in this week's heat wave in prep
aration for the oven awaiting the
players.
"Hopefully we'll be prepared for the
heat after the last two days of practice

As Frank Carey goes, so goes the Cardinal. Carey is batting .397 in Stanford's 17
wins in 1989 but is hitting only .290 in the team's 18 losses.
— four hours in 90 degrees on
the field. If anything, it will affect
the pitching, but I don't see why
it won't affect their oitching also,"
Griffin said.
After taking two of three from ,
the Trojans, the Cardinal has set
a goal of third place in the Six-Pac.
Tied for last with UCLA, surging
Stanford trails third-place USC
and California by just two games,
with series remaining against
each team.
"We're shooting for the third
spot. We were three games behind
USC (last Sunday) and said if we
get this one it'll be two. We're
taking them one game at a time,"
first baseman Brian Johnson said.
"If it's the same as last year,
it'll take 15-15 in conference. We
want to win the second half, go
10-5. We just have to keep getting
two of three. If we only get one
down there, we'll have to make
it up somewhere else. If we get
third, we should make regionals,"
Griffin added.
