# Women's hoops memories are among the best this year
## 
### 
Finally, a chance to catch a breath.
March Madness is just a memory.
Basketball games at Stanford exist
in the past tense only. Hoops and hoopla
have both subsided.
All that remains is nostalgia, snippets
of events that surface periodically remind
ing one of special happenings. On the
men's hoops side, images of Todd Lichti's
reverse slam and the Scott Meinert-
Howard Wright alley-oop characterize the
season for me. That which I never
thought I'd see at Stanford arrived in
1989: big-time basketball reached the
Farm.
More vivid for me, however, are mem
ories of the women's team, the Cardinal
I covered for two straight seasons. From
a sleeper to a contender, I have watched
the squad improve game-by-game. At the
current rate of progress, an NCAA title
is due at any time now, maybe even next
year...
Ah, but that's the future; now for a
little bit of the past. For me, the most
special moments of Cardinal basketball
coincide with numbers, mostly game
scores but a few other significant figures.
Pull out the calculators, hide the sappi
ness detectors. It's time to reminisce.

• 4-0397: Line #2 on The Daily office
main phone. What, you may ask, does
this have to do with basketball? Nothing
really, except for an anecdote.
Jump back to an afternoon in Novem
ber, 1987. I was storming out of The
Daily in a huff, frustrated with my lack
luster writing and disillusioned with the
significance of it all. Don't ask why; I
was just in one of those fall quarter
moods.
Just as I reached the door, the phone
rang. "This is the last call I will ever
answer at The Daily," I hotly proclaimed,
and I grabbed the receiver with defiance.
At the other end was a congenial June
Daugherty, assistant women's basketball

coach, inquiring about the new beat
writer. Pablo Morales (yes, the swimmer)
had graduated, and she wanted to know
who was going to replace him.
I responded that no one had been as
signed the beat yet, but the editor would
call her before the season started and let
her know. She thanked me, and I hung
up.
The click of the receiver returning to
the cradle set my cognitive gears mes
hing. "Hmm, women's basketball," -my
mind churned, "that might be interesting.
Go ahead and do it — maybe they'll win
a dozen games and make it interesting."
This sounds outlandish now, but that
was after Jennifer Azzi's freshman year
and before the consecutive 20-win sea
sons. Double-digit win totals were rare
for the Cardinal back then, but I figured
I might be mildly surprised.
What a fortunate understatement.
Thanks for setting me straight, Card.
• 20: Stanford's preseason ranking in
the 1987-88 Street and Smith's season
preview. A sleeper, Street and Smith's
said of Stanford. A fluke, Coach Tara
VanDerveer had felt about the ranking.
The cautious coach kept advising me

that many improvements were needed
before the top-20 ranking was justified.
Little by little the team moved up the
rankings, reaching No. 9 before finishing
11th. The sleeper had awakened.
• 75-74: UCLA upsets Stanford in the
regular season ender. Dang that Dora
Dome. With but a handful of seconds left
on the clock and Stanford leading 74-73,
UCLA's star forward takes the ball down
-cou»tv-Tk» -Stanford defense adjusts,
awaiting her desperation shot at the buz
zer.
Dome had been unconscious all night
long, swishing almost every shot she took.
Everyone in Maples Pavilion knew she
was going to take the shot — that's just
how these things work.
Everyone, that is, except Dora Dome.
Racing toward the key, she dishes off
to unguarded teammate Jamie Brown.
Jamie "I-haven 't-made-a-shot-all-night"
Brown, who stood about 15 feet to the
right of the hoop.
Brown throws one up as the buzzer
sounds. Swish. 75-74 UCLA. A home
game in the NCAA Tournament
evaporates.
Dang that Dora Dome.

• 74-72: Stanford beats Montana in
overtime for the team's first NCAA Tour
nament win ever. The game itself is a
blur, probably due to stress amnesia. Tied
after 40 minutes, the game turned into
a real stomach-twister and a race against
the clock.
You see, there is only one afternoon
flight out of Missoula, and we were all
booked on it. As I recall, take-off time
was at about 4:45, and we were in the
heat of overtime as 4:00 rolled around.
The Cardinal held on to win. VanDer
veer, Sports Information Director Steve
Raczynski, Trisha Stevens, Soiya Hen
ning and I ran pell-mell through the
arena hallways looking for the media
room, which we promptly exited after a
whirlwind press conference.
A police escort cleared the path to the
freeway, and we reached the airport at
4:37. We made it just in time, but more
importantly the Cardinal notched a key
tournament win, a fact which only sunk"
in after the pilot issued congratulations
over the P.A. and the planeful of pas
sengers applauded. This, more than any
other event, was the highlight of last
season.

• 10: Stanford's 1988-89
preseason ranking by Street and
Smith's. Better, but hardly any
more accurate. Oh, well.
• 119-62: Stanford beats Wis
consin in the season opener, shat
tering the school and Pacific 10
Conference records for score and
margin. VanDerveer said that this
was the first indication of how
good the team really was.
For me, it confirmed a suspicion
I held that this could be a magical
year, the year that Stanford wins
the Pac-10 crown. After watching
every member of the Stanford
roster enter the game and excel,
it became clear that the Cardinal
was the team to be reckoned with.
It also gave the fans their first
taste of 100-point scoring, a tra
dition that propelled Stanford
through the end of the season and
four straight triple-digit games.
• 105-77: Stanford beats UCLA
to finish its Pac-10 schedule with

the first undefeated record in
league history. The game wasn't
all that exciting, as the Bruins
weren't half as menacing as they
were the year before. It was just
another blowout for the Cardinal
juggernaut ranked fourth in the
country.
Yet this rout was special.
Talking with Azzi afterward, it
was easy to see how important
the win was to the team. Revenge
was part of it, but it was the
concept of a perfect finish that
meant so much to the players.
Thus the elaborate net-cutting
ceremony afterwards. Thus the
drenching of VanDerveer with a
cooler of ice-water. Thus the
locker room cake-fight. Jubilation
was contagious, and everyone
around caught it.
• 18-0: Stanford's 1988-89 Pac
-10 record. See above.
• 85-75: Louisiana Tech beats
Stanford in the Midwest Regional
final to advance to the Final Four.
Not one of my happiest memories,
but a poignant one nonetheless.
Stanford came within 10 points
of blasphemy: knocking off one of
the Big Three. Tennessee, Auburn

and Louisiana Tech have been the
powerhouses of women's basket
ball since the dawn of the NCAA
Tournament and have symbolized
the unreachable echelon. These
are the teams others hope to beat
one day.
Next year, the list will expand
to four. Hampered by untimely
foul calls (note the word "calls"
accompanies "foul"; enough said)
and an away-court disadvantage,
the Cardinal came closer to
sacrilege than most other teams
the Lady Techsters faced. With
Stanford gaining more experience
and more powerful post players
like incoming-freshman Val
Whiting, Tech will be the team
hoping to eek out a win.
• 10: The number on Jennifer
Azzi's jersey. My final memory,
the one that will stick with me
after others have faded, is of one
of the most remarkable people
I've encountered at Stanford.
Azzi has been for the women
what Todd Lichti has been for the
men: a clutch player and a star.
Sonja Henning may be the glue
holding the team together with
her steadiness and intelligence,

but it is the flashy excellence of
Azzi that has captured fan and
opponents' attention.
Many records in the Stanford
book belong to her, and many
more will fall before she hangs
up her shoes and returns her uni
form. She is Stanford's first Ail-
American, a well-deserved honor
for an amazing season.
But, to be sappy for a second,
it is her personality that I will
remember most. I'll remember
the crowd of children swarming
her after every game, hoping for
an autograph that every last one
was graciously given. I'll remem
ber the look of astonishment at a
press conference when, in front of
rolling television cameras, she
found out she was named Pac-10
Player of the Year. I'll remember
the tear that escaped after the
Louisiana Tech loss.
Azzi has symbolized the success
that the women's basketball pro
gram has experienced. May the
hard work and magnanimous
spirit continue to pay great
dividends.
