# Women's hoops memories are among the best this year
## 
### 
Finally, a chance to catch a breath.
March Madness is just a memory.
Basketball games at Stanford exist
in the past tense only. Hoops and hoopla
have both subsided.
All that remains is nostalgia, snippets
of events that surface periodically remind
ing one of special happenings. On the
men's hoops side, images of Todd Lichti's
reverse slam and the Scott Meinert-
Howard Wright alley-oop characterize the
season for me. That which I never
thought I'd see at Stanford arrived in
1989: big-time basketball reached the
Farm.
More vivid for me, however, are mem
ories of the women's team, the Cardinal
I covered for two straight seasons. From
a sleeper to a contender, I have watched
the squad improve game-by-game. At the
current rate of progress, an NCAA title
is due at any time now, maybe even next
year...
Ah, but that's the future; now for a
little bit of the past. For me, the most
special moments of Cardinal basketball
coincide with numbers, mostly game
scores but a few other significant figures.
Pull out the calculators, hide the sappi
ness detectors. It's time to reminisce.

• 4-0397: Line #2 on The Daily office
main phone. What, you may ask, does
this have to do with basketball? Nothing
really, except for an anecdote.
Jump back to an afternoon in Novem
ber, 1987. I was storming out of The
Daily in a huff, frustrated with my lack
luster writing and disillusioned with the
significance of it all. Don't ask why; I
was just in one of those fall quarter
moods.
Just as I reached the door, the phone
rang. "This is the last call I will ever
answer at The Daily," I hotly proclaimed,
and I grabbed the receiver with defiance.
At the other end was a congenial June
Daugherty, assistant women's basketball

coach, inquiring about the new beat
writer. Pablo Morales (yes, the swimmer)
had graduated, and she wanted to know
who was going to replace him.
I responded that no one had been as
signed the beat yet, but the editor would
call her before the season started and let
her know. She thanked me, and I hung
up.
The click of the receiver returning to
the cradle set my cognitive gears mes
hing. "Hmm, women's basketball," -my
mind churned, "that might be interesting.
Go ahead and do it — maybe they'll win
a dozen games and make it interesting."
This sounds outlandish now, but that
was after Jennifer Azzi's freshman year
and before the consecutive 20-win sea
sons. Double-digit win totals were rare
for the Cardinal back then, but I figured
I might be mildly surprised.
What a fortunate understatement.
Thanks for setting me straight, Card.
• 20: Stanford's preseason ranking in
the 1987-88 Street and Smith's season
preview. A sleeper, Street and Smith's
said of Stanford. A fluke, Coach Tara
VanDerveer had felt about the ranking.
The cautious coach kept advising me

that many improvements were needed
before the top-20 ranking was justified.
Little by little the team moved up the
rankings, reaching No. 9 before finishing
11th. The sleeper had awakened.
• 75-74: UCLA upsets Stanford in the
regular season ender. Dang that Dora
Dome. With but a handful of seconds left
on the clock and Stanford leading 74-73,
UCLA's star forward takes the ball down
-cou»tv-Tk» -Stanford defense adjusts,
awaiting her desperation shot at the buz
zer.
Dome had been unconscious all night
long, swishing almost every shot she took.
Everyone in Maples Pavilion knew she
was going to take the shot — that's just
how these things work.
Everyone, that is, except Dora Dome.
Racing toward the key, she dishes off
to unguarded teammate Jamie Brown.
Jamie "I-haven 't-made-a-shot-all-night"
Brown, who stood about 15 feet to the
right of the hoop.
Brown throws one up as the buzzer
sounds. Swish. 75-74 UCLA. A home
game in the NCAA Tournament
evaporates.
Dang that Dora Dome.

• 74-72: Stanford beats Montana in
overtime for the team's first NCAA Tour
nament win ever. The game itself is a
blur, probably due to stress amnesia. Tied
after 40 minutes, the game turned into
a real stomach-twister and a race against
the clock.
You see, there is only one afternoon
flight out of Missoula, and we were all
booked on it. As I recall, take-off time
was at about 4:45, and we were in the
heat of overtime as 4:00 rolled around.
The Cardinal held on to win. VanDer
veer, Sports Information Director Steve
Raczynski, Trisha Stevens, Soiya Hen
ning and I ran pell-mell through the
arena hallways looking for the media
room, which we promptly exited after a
whirlwind press conference.
A police escort cleared the path to the
freeway, and we reached the airport at
4:37. We made it just in time, but more
importantly the Cardinal notched a key
tournament win, a fact which only sunk"
in after the pilot issued congratulations
over the P.A. and the planeful of pas
sengers applauded. This, more than any
other event, was the highlight of last
season.
