Can anybody beat the Cardinal?
That question could be answered once and for
all this weekend as the No. 1-ranked Stanford wom
en's tennis team (17-0, 4-0 in Pacific 10 Conference
play) heads south for a trio of matches against San
Diego State, USC and UCLA.
Coming off a strong road trip last weekend in
which Stanford knocked off second-ranked Florida
and seventh-ranked Miami in Gainesville, Fla., the
Cardinal has proven its ability to win away from
home.
"We won in front of some hostile crowds," Coach
Frank Brennan said. "We're pretty tough."
Brennan's big concern is that despite completing
more than half the schedule, many tough matches
remain. "We've played so much, but there's still so
much to go," Brennan said.
As for this weekend's contests, today's match
against the Aztecs promises to be the easiest of the
three.
Tomorrow, when Stanford faces the Women of
Troy, things could heat up in a hurry. USC, ranked
No. 3, had been quiet until upsetting UCLA recently,
Brennan said. USC's Trisha Laux is one of the
hardest hitting player's in the country.
The weekend finale, against the Bruins, could
also be interesting. UCLA recently scored a big win
over No. 4 Georgia and has two of the nation's top
20 singles players in Jessica Emmons and Alysia
May.
Stanford, however, should have all the weapons
it needs considering that the squad has five singles
player's ranked in the top 10: Tami Whitlinger (No.
1), Debbie Graham (2), Sandra Birch (6), Lisa Green
(7) and Teri Whitlinger (9).

with a 14-0 singles record.
