# Men's volleyball to host No. 20 UC-San Diego
## 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
The UC-San Diego Tritons will
take on the Stanford men's vol
leyball team tonight at Maples Pa
vilion at 7:30. And, after witness
ing the way Stanford dismissed
the mighty USC Trojans two
nights ago, local volleyball od
dsmakers are not giving the
visitors much of a chance.
The Tritons are no pushovers,
however. They are ranked No. 20
in the nation and have a team
that is definitely on the national
volleyball map. In addition, ac
cording to Stanford Asst. Coach
Ruben Nieves, the UC-San Diego
team boasts a very successful and
reputable coach, Digger Grayhill.

'We know so little
about this team,
who knows what
they might be able
to do.'
— Fred Sturm

"Digger has been around for a
long time, and his teams are tradi
tionally characterized as well*
disciplined and scrappy; they can
always be counted on to hustle,**
Nieves said.
When asked if he was going to
approach this match any differ
ently than the most recent Stan
ford match versus USC, Cardinal
Coach Fred Sturm shook his head,
responding, "I see no reason why
we'd treat this match any differ
ently that any other. No, I'm sure

we'll start our regular guys, and
if possible, we'll work in as many
others as we can."
That decision by Sturm, even
more so than the strong Cardinal
showing versus USC, could spell
certain doom for the Triton
squad. In fact, much to the
chagrin of Coach Grayhill, Stan
ford is almost sure to take this
game very seriously in light of
the rough road stretch that the
squad suffered recently.
"Besides," Sturm said, "we
know so little about this team,
who knows what they might be
able to do."
Also, the Triton match will be
Stanford's final competitive
brush-up before next weekend's
huge two-game set. The team
plays Long Beach State on Friday
night, and on Saturday, Stanford
will confront No. 1-ranked UCLA.
With two such gigantic battles on
the horizon, it jh highly unlikely
that the Cardinal will give
tonight's opponents any slack
whatsoever.
So, if you happen to stop by
Maples tonight, look for the Car
dinal to put forth a crisp, strong
showing. In fact, if Stanford ap
proaches the season-high .506 hit
ting percentage that the squad
flaunted on Wednesday night,
don't blink. You might miss the
match.
