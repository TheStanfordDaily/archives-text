# Advising Bush, battling the budget
## As economics council chair, Boskin discovers insider's Washington 
### Amy Rosenfeld Editorial staff 
WASHINGTON — Overlooking the
White House from his spacious corner
office in the Old Executive Office Build
ing, Michael Boskin seems content and
committed to his new role as chair of
the president's Council of Economic Ad
visers.
Government life is "interesting, chal
lenging, demanding and educational,"
but there are also "lots of rules and
regulations about things that I most
people] would normally take for
granted," said the Stanford economics
professor turned presidential aide.
Last week, Boskin discussed his first
few months as the chief economic ad
viser not only to Bush, but also to nu

and members of Congress in an inter

He said his new job occupies him
"more than 1 ever thought" and added
that there is less flexibility than at Stan
ford, where a professor can "knock off
for an hour and go hit tennis balls" if

he or she wants to.
"Sometimes it's exciting, sometimes
it's fun, sometimes it's frustrating, and
anybody coming into government should
expect all those things," he said, adding
that the key to any job is the people
you work with.
"I'm lucky in that I'm working with
a terrific set of people — starting with
the president on down," he said.

and re-establish the usefulness,
credibility and prestige of the Council
of Economic Advisers." This effort in
cludes frequent contact with Congress
and the president, who Boskin sees
several times a week and communicates
with daily.
"I do a lot of testifying [before Con
gress!, including the same testimony to
four or five different committees," he
joked.
However, his advice may not always
have a major impact, Boskin has dis
covered. The decision-making process
in any large organization is very com
plex, he explained, and people entering

times it's frustrating, and
anybody coming into gov

government should realize that "their
perspectives and concerns are important
.. . but [arel not the only criteria or
concerns that the president must con
sider."
The position as council chair is the
first government post for Boskin, who
advised past presidents and government
officials as a professor.
Boskin said it is "important in a de
mocracy that people be willing to stop
out of their normal careers for a period
