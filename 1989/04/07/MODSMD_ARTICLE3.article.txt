# Advising Bush, battling the budget
## As economics council chair, Boskin discovers insider's Washington 
### Amy Rosenfeld Editorial staff 
WASHINGTON — Overlooking the
White House from his spacious corner
office in the Old Executive Office Build
ing, Michael Boskin seems content and
committed to his new role as chair of
the president's Council of Economic Ad
visers.
Government life is "interesting, chal
lenging, demanding and educational,"
but there are also "lots of rules and
regulations about things that I most
people] would normally take for
granted," said the Stanford economics
professor turned presidential aide.
Last week, Boskin discussed his first
few months as the chief economic ad
viser not only to Bush, but also to nu
merous senior administration officials
and members of Congress in an inter
view with The Daily at his Washington
office.
He said his new job occupies him
"more than 1 ever thought" and added
that there is less flexibility than at Stan
ford, where a professor can "knock off
for an hour and go hit tennis balls" if

he or she wants to.
"Sometimes it's exciting, sometimes
it's fun, sometimes it's frustrating, and
anybody coming into government should
expect all those things," he said, adding
that the key to any job is the people
you work with.
"I'm lucky in that I'm working with
a terrific set of people — starting with
the president on down," he said.
One voice among many
One of Boskin's goals is to "uphold
and re-establish the usefulness,
credibility and prestige of the Council
of Economic Advisers." This effort in
cludes frequent contact with Congress
and the president, who Boskin sees
several times a week and communicates
with daily.
"I do a lot of testifying [before Con
gress!, including the same testimony to
four or five different committees," he
joked.
However, his advice may not always
have a major impact, Boskin has dis

to serve in government." Con
versely, he said he also believes
career government people should
"stop out for a year or two and
experience what some would call
the 'real world.' "
This break gives career
government people an opportunity
to observe the effect that govern
ment policies and regulations have
on private industry and decision
making, he explained.
Revamping the tax system
For example, the way taxes in
fluence private decisions to save
is a topic Boskin has studied in
a real-world setting. In the past,
Boskin said, he has suggested
revising the income-tax system to
tax consumed income more heav
ily than saved income. Doing so,
he explained, would encourage
private saving.
The decline of national saving
is due more to a lower private
saving rate than an increase in
the budget deficit, Boskin said.
But, since becoming a Washing
ton insider, he now realizes that
the government must be "very
cautious" in implementing such
measures so as to not increase
the budget deficit at the same
time as private saving. Increased
saving could mean lower tax rev
enues for the federal government,
he explained.
However, Boskin said, because
there was "such a mcyor over
haul" of the tax structure three
years ago, he would not expect
another dramatic change in the
tax system any time soon.
A No. 1 priority
Because it is, in part, a "huge
drain on national saving," reduc
ing the federal budget deficit is
the administration's "very first
priority," he said.

Boskin was one of the main
architects of President Bush's
"flexible freeze" plan, which aims
to reduce the deficit by preventing
government spending from rising
faster than the inflation rate.
The effect recent interest rate
increases have had on economic
growth, and thus government rev-

enues, is uncertain because "mon
etary policy . .. works with a long
and unpredictable lag in its effect
on output and employment and
then subsequently on inflation,"
he said.
But Boskin said he remains
"cautiously optimistic" that the
current economic expansion will
continue for some time.
Critics of the flexible freeze
have argued that a freeze in gov
ernment spending would mean
cuts in social programs, but Bos
kin said the money to allow
growth while still reducing the
deficit will come from several dif
ferent sources.
First, the government this year
will earn about $85 billion in new
revenues, the bulk of which will
be "dedicated to deficit reduc
tion," he said. In addition, some
federal programs, like government
subsidies to farmers, will

"naturally decline," he added.
"The chief meteorologist in the
Agricultural Department assures
me that (another drought) is a
low-probability event,"he said, ex
plaining the reason for the
projected decline in spending on
agricultural programs.
The administration also plans

to reduce the rapid growth of
Medicare from 13 percent to about
9 percent next year. "Budgetspeak
in Washington" calls that "a 4
percent cut," Boskin said. "We call
it a 9 percent increase."
Education is another area crit
ics have feared will suffer with
the flexible freeze. Yet Boskin
reiterated Bush's campaign prom
ise that education is a high prio
rity in this administration.
Among the president's targeted
areas are support for black col
leges, merit pay for teachers and
anti-drug education, Boskin said.
Bush also believes it is important
to expand government investment
in research and development in
scientific fields, he added.
"But remember, we have a
tough budget situation and it is
an extremely important national
priority to reduce the budget def

icit," Boskin said. Therefore,
while President Bush has
prioritized education, he "doesn't
believe the answer to improving
education is just to increase
federal funding," but to galvanize
local governments and families to
promote education.
Increases will likely be modest
and phased in over a period of
time, Boskin predicted.
Committed to the president
At Stanford, Boskin is not only
an economics professor but also
a senior fellow at the Hoover In
stitution. Boskin said he sees the
two as "separate closely related
entities" and believes there is
room for improvement in both
their individual and mutual rela
tionships.
Yet, he also said he believes
"that the goals and missions of
Stanford University and the Hoo
ver Institution are not and should
not be identical," although they
are "certainly ... compatible."
Still, "While there are undoubt
edly tensions that will continue
and areas where the interests of
each party will not be congruent,
hopefully those can be worked
out," he added.
Although Boskin is being con
sidered for the soon-to-be vacated
position of Hoover director, he
said his current plans are to do
"the best job I can" as the pres
ident's chief economic adviser and
then to return to Stanford "con
tented and happy in a couple years
or so."
Boskin said he does not see him
self as a career-government per
son, although he would not rule
out returning to Washington for
a year or two in the future.
"Two years from now seems
like an eternity," he said. "1 have
so many things I have to get done
in the next week, it's hard to think
about two years from now."

to serve in government." Con
versely, he said he also believes
career government people should
"stop out for a year or two and
experience what some would call
the 'real world.' "
This break gives career
government people an opportunity
to observe the effect that govern
ment policies and regulations have
on private industry and decision
making, he explained.
Revamping the tax system
For example, the way taxes in
fluence private decisions to save
is a topic Boskin has studied in
a real-world setting. In the past,
Boskin said, he has suggested
revising the income-tax system to
tax consumed income more heav
ily than saved income. Doing so,
he explained, would encourage
private saving.
The decline of national saving
is due more to a lower private
saving rate than an increase in
the budget deficit, Boskin said.
But, since becoming a Washing
ton insider, he now realizes that
the government must be "very
cautious" in implementing such
measures so as to not increase
the budget deficit at the same
time as private saving. Increased
saving could mean lower tax rev
enues for the federal government,
he explained.
However, Boskin said, because
there was "such a mcyor over
haul" of the tax structure three
years ago, he would not expect
another dramatic change in the
tax system any time soon.
A No. 1 priority
Because it is, in part, a "huge
drain on national saving," reduc
ing the federal budget deficit is
the administration's "very first
priority," he said.

Boskin was one of the main
architects of President Bush's
"flexible freeze" plan, which aims
to reduce the deficit by preventing
government spending from rising
faster than the inflation rate.
The effect recent interest rate
increases have had on economic
growth, and thus government rev-

enues, is uncertain because "mon
etary policy . .. works with a long
and unpredictable lag in its effect
on output and employment and
then subsequently on inflation,"
he said.
But Boskin said he remains
"cautiously optimistic" that the
current economic expansion will
continue for some time.
Critics of the flexible freeze
have argued that a freeze in gov
ernment spending would mean
cuts in social programs, but Bos
kin said the money to allow
growth while still reducing the
deficit will come from several dif
ferent sources.
First, the government this year
will earn about $85 billion in new
revenues, the bulk of which will
be "dedicated to deficit reduc
tion," he said. In addition, some
federal programs, like government
subsidies to farmers, will

"naturally decline," he added.
"The chief meteorologist in the
Agricultural Department assures
me that (another drought) is a
low-probability event,"he said, ex
plaining the reason for the
projected decline in spending on
agricultural programs.
The administration also plans

to reduce the rapid growth of
Medicare from 13 percent to about
9 percent next year. "Budgetspeak
in Washington" calls that "a 4
percent cut," Boskin said. "We call
it a 9 percent increase."
Education is another area crit
ics have feared will suffer with
the flexible freeze. Yet Boskin
reiterated Bush's campaign prom
ise that education is a high prio
rity in this administration.
Among the president's targeted
areas are support for black col
leges, merit pay for teachers and
anti-drug education, Boskin said.
Bush also believes it is important
to expand government investment
in research and development in
scientific fields, he added.
"But remember, we have a
tough budget situation and it is
an extremely important national
priority to reduce the budget def

icit," Boskin said. Therefore,
while President Bush has
prioritized education, he "doesn't
believe the answer to improving

architects of President Bush's
"flexible freeze" plan, which aims
to reduce the deficit by preventing
government spending from rising
faster than the inflation rate.
The effect recent interest rate
increases have had on economic
growth, and thus government rev-

enues, is uncertain because "mon
etary policy . .. works with a long
and unpredictable lag in its effect
on output and employment and
then subsequently on inflation,"
he said.
But Boskin said he remains
"cautiously optimistic" that the
current economic expansion will
continue for some time.
Critics of the flexible freeze
have argued that a freeze in gov
ernment spending would mean
cuts in social programs, but Bos
kin said the money to allow
growth while still reducing the
deficit will come from several dif
ferent sources.
First, the government this year
will earn about $85 billion in new
revenues, the bulk of which will
be "dedicated to deficit reduc
tion," he said. In addition, some
federal programs, like government
subsidies to farmers, will

"naturally decline," he added.
"The chief meteorologist in the
Agricultural Department assures
me that (another drought) is a
low-probability event,"he said, ex
plaining the reason for the
projected decline in spending on
agricultural programs.
The administration also plans

to reduce the rapid growth of
Medicare from 13 percent to about
9 percent next year. "Budgetspeak
in Washington" calls that "a 4
percent cut," Boskin said. "We call
it a 9 percent increase."
Education is another area crit
ics have feared will suffer with
the flexible freeze. Yet Boskin
reiterated Bush's campaign prom
ise that education is a high prio
rity in this administration.
Among the president's targeted
areas are support for black col
leges, merit pay for teachers and
anti-drug education, Boskin said.
Bush also believes it is important
to expand government investment
in research and development in
scientific fields, he added.
"But remember, we have a
tough budget situation and it is
an extremely important national
priority to reduce the budget def

icit," Boskin said. Therefore,
while President Bush has
prioritized education, he "doesn't
believe the answer to improving
education is just to increase
federal funding," but to galvanize
local governments and families to
promote education.
Increases will likely be modest
and phased in over a period of
time, Boskin predicted.
Committed to the president
At Stanford, Boskin is not only
an economics professor but also
a senior fellow at the Hoover In
stitution. Boskin said he sees the
two as "separate closely related
entities" and believes there is
room for improvement in both
their individual and mutual rela
tionships.
Yet, he also said he believes
"that the goals and missions of
Stanford University and the Hoo
ver Institution are not and should
not be identical," although they
are "certainly ... compatible."
Still, "While there are undoubt
edly tensions that will continue
and areas where the interests of
each party will not be congruent,
hopefully those can be worked
out," he added.
Although Boskin is being con
sidered for the soon-to-be vacated
position of Hoover director, he
said his current plans are to do
"the best job I can" as the pres
ident's chief economic adviser and
then to return to Stanford "con
tented and happy in a couple years
or so."
Boskin said he does not see him
self as a career-government per
son, although he would not rule
out returning to Washington for
a year or two in the future.
"Two years from now seems
like an eternity," he said. "1 have
so many things I have to get done
in the next week, it's hard to think
about two years from now."
