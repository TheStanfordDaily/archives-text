# Buddie, Yarbrough fall at NCAAs
## 
### Greg Gottesman Staff writer 
Stanford juniors Steve Buddie
and Steve Yarbrough caught a
common wrestling ailment at the
the NCAA Championships in
Oklahoma City March 16-18.
According to Stanford Coach
Chris Horpel, the sickness "First
Tournament Syndrome" afflicts
almost every competitor wrestling
in the NCAA Championships for
the first time.
"Wrestling at the NCAA's was
a lot like wrestling in my first
state tournament," Buddie said.
"Even though I thought I could
win, I was still a little insecure,
a little hesitant."
Buddie, who wrestles in the 170
lb. weight class, finished in the
top 16 of the tournament. In his
first match, Buddie wrestled
Steve Hasenfus, the eighth seed
from Columbia. Despite holding a
5-5 tie with only minutes remain
ing, Buddie was pinned at the 6:11
mark.
"I stuck with a move when I

should have bailed out He capi
talized on my offensive error,"
Buddie said.
Hasenfus made the quarterfinal
round, enabling Buddie to enter
the consolation bracket. In his
first consolation match, Buddie
upset ninth-seed Mike Gibbons of
Central Connecticut 10-5.
Momentum, however, did not
help the Stanford junior as he
lost his next match to unseeded
Frank Zelinaki of Edinboro (Pa.)
10-4.
Luck of the draw and one point
separated Yarbrough (167 lbs.),
Buddie's teammate, from an ex
cellent showing at the NCAAs.
The former top wrestler in the
Pacific 10 Conference, Yar
borough lost a nailbiter to Edin
boro's Rikk Walters 2-1. Both
wrestlers scored one point on es
capes; Walters won the match be
cause of a one-minute advantage
in riding time.
"Steve (Yarbrough) suffered
from First Match Syndrome,"
Horpel commented. "He didn't
wrestle as well as he could."

Despite not placing in the top
eight and making All-American
status, Yarbrough was still opti
mistic. "After finishing the tour
nament, I see that being a national
champion is within reach. I hate
to say it, but there's always next
year. I'm on the verge of being a
top contender and expect to be an
All-American next year."
Buddie agreed. "All of the guys
at the NCAA's were excellent
wrestlers. The top eight guys just
had really good tournaments.
They were the guys who were win
ning the one-point matches. They
were the guys who remained men
tally tough for the two or three
days of the tournament. That's
what it takes. I see that now."
Of special note, former Cardinal
wrestler Dave Lee, a transfer to
Wisconsin because of problems
with the Stanford Athletic De
partment's stance toward the
wrestling program, won the
NCAA title in the 167 pound
weight division. He would have
been the first Stanford NCAA
wrestling champion ever.
