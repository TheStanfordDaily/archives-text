# Tennis travels to UCLA

### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Only one thing is certain as
the Stanford men's tennis team
begins its Los Angeles road
swing today at No. 1 UCLA.
It's gonna be hot. Really hot.
In fact, the L.A. temperature,
which has hit 100 degrees and
then some the last few days,
may play a large part in deter
mining the outcomes of today's
match against the Bruins and
tomorrow's at No. 10 USC.
That's just fine with the Car
dinal, which is a decided un
derdog in today's match. On
paper, UCLA has the strongest
lineup in the country, but per
haps the heat will erode some
of the home-court edge the
Bruins will bring into the con
test.
Of course, playing in sauna
like weather won't be a heck
of a lot of fun for Stanford

either, but when your opponent
is 19-1 you have to take ad
vantage of any possible breaks.
UCLA's sole 1989 loss came
at the hands of South Carolina
at the National Team Indoor
Tournament (otherwise known
as Upset Fest '89) in February.
Since the tournament the
Bruins have dropped exactly
six matches in 10 dual contests.
