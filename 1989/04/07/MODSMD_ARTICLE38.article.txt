# State orders Stanford to clean up pollution

### Nathanael Cousins Staff writer 
The toxics division of the
State Department of Health
Service has ordered Stanford
to assist in the clean up of
contaminated soil and ground
water at the University-owned
Stanford Research Park.
The state issued a remedial
action order on Tuesday, which
named the University as one
of 14 responsible parties for
the water contamination at
Building 15,3215 Porter Drive,
in the Hill view-Porter area of
Palo Alto.
According to Jill Singleton of
the Health Service's toxic sub
stance control division, local
wells in the area have been
tainted by the industrial sol
vent trichlorethylene, TCE.
The Hillview-Porter site is
on the state's Superfund list,
making it a lower priority for
clean-up than sites on the
federal Environmental Protec
tion Agency's Superfund clean
up list.
"There are multiple sources

of contamination in the area,"
Singleton said. "We have iden
tified Stanford and the indus
tries as point sources for the
contamination, and we are
directing them to clean it up."
The state's order calls for
further investigation of the
area and directs the responsible
contaminators to come up with
an interim plan for action and
pursue long-term clean-up.
Stanford has "complied ful
ly" with the order, Singleton
said, explaining that Stanford
and Hewlett-Packard have per
formed additional tests at the
site and are beginning the
clean-up process.
University public affairs of
ficer Pete Sidebottom stressed
Stanford's compliance with the
clean-up effort, while down
playing the environmental
damage.
"There is no evidence of mid
night dumping," Sidebottom
said. "The levels at which some
of the chemicals have been
found are not gallons and gal
lons, but maybe one bucket
dumped 10 to 15 years ago.
