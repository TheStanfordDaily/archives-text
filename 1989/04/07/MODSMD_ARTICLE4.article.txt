# Dish ban distresses cyclists
## Stronger enforcement measures restrict Foothill access 
### Martha Brockenbrough 
A newly-enforced ban of moun
tain bikes from the Stanford Foot
hills has mountain bike
enthusiasts flying oft the handle.
Although official University
policy forbids people from biking
in the area near the Dish, the
policy has never seriously been
enforced. However, over spring
break, signs were posted at the
Dish indicating a new commit
ment to the policy by the Univer
sity's Department of Public
Safety.
The University cited concern
about environmental damage from

bikes as a reason to uphold the
ban. Paula Kakimoto, Stanford
lands manager and chair of the
Foothills Oversight Group which
determines Dish policy, said that
"visual surveys indicated
damage," but noted no specific
tests were conducted to evaluate
damage by bikers.
Campus Police Chief Marvin
Herrington, who monitors policy
enforcement, agreed. "There is a
terrible amount of damage," he
said. "Bikers for the most part
are responsible."
However, members of the Stan
ford Community Association to
Reinstate Bicycle Access, a new

group which plans to fight the
enforcement, disagree with the
singling out of bicyclists as of
fenders.
Spearheading the fledgling 12-
member movement is graduate
student Roman Dial, second-place
finisher in the 200-mile Alaska
Iditarod Mountain Bike Competi
tion. Dial called the Dish area "the
greatest network of single-track
trails from Marin to Big Basin"
and denounced the prohibition as
"a serious affront to recrea
tionalists at Stanford."
Fellow biker and graduate stu-
dent George Yeltatzie said the
Sierra Club and other organiza
tions which ban mountain bikes
from their trails have never tested
the damage bikes cause because
"the rich horseback riders in con
trol of the trails are afraid that
their animals may cause more
damage than mountain bikes."
"I feel frustration and anger be
cause the University made this
change during spring break when
most people weren't around," Yel
tatzie said. "They never consulted
the bikers â€” the consulting was
done within the University
hierarchy."
Biology Professor Craig Heller,
who maintains a personal interest
in the University's Foothill regu

lations, said he opposes the en
forcement of the policy. "It is
irrational. When people can't see
the reason behind a policy, they
ignore it and conflict arises."
Heller also criticized the
prohibition as a failure on the
University's part to develop "good
relations with the community."
Kakimoto emphasized that
bikes have never officially been
allowed in the Foothills, although
numerous bikers used the trails.
"People were just tossing their
bikes over the fence," she said.
"The policy towards bicycles has
not been changed."
Aside from the ecological con
cern, the Foothills Oversight
Group viewed the Dish as a safety
hazard for both bikers and other
recreational athletes. Because the
roads at the Dish are in poor con
dition, aiding an injured person
is "a long and delayed process,"

Herrington said. "It's just too
dangerous."
A separate policy towards
hikers and joggers has also been
revised in the past few weeks.
Originally, hikers and joggers with
Stanford identification were per
mitted in the area only if they
obtained a year-long permit from
the Lands Management depart
ment. That policy was also rarely
enforced.
Kakimoto said the increased en
forcement of the biker ban
eliminates the need for a permit
to use the Dish for recreational
foot traffic.
The tighter enforcement will be
coordinated by University Public
Safety Officer Doug Williams, the
"Foothills ranger." Williams will
reroute bikers to a public park
near Arastradero Road which is
less vulnerable than the Dish to
mountain bike damage.
