# Dish ban distresses cyclists
## Stronger enforcement measures restrict Foothill access 
### Martha Brockenbrough 
A newly-enforced ban of moun
tain bikes from the Stanford Foot
hills has mountain bike
enthusiasts flying oft the handle.
Although official University
policy forbids people from biking
in the area near the Dish, the
policy has never seriously been
enforced. However, over spring
break, signs were posted at the
Dish indicating a new commit
ment to the policy by the Univer
sity's Department of Public
Safety.
The University cited concern
about environmental damage from

bikes as a reason to uphold the
ban. Paula Kakimoto, Stanford
lands manager and chair of the
Foothills Oversight Group which
determines Dish policy, said that
"visual surveys indicated
damage," but noted no specific
tests were conducted to evaluate
damage by bikers.
Campus Police Chief Marvin
Herrington, who monitors policy
enforcement, agreed. "There is a
terrible amount of damage," he
said. "Bikers for the most part
are responsible."
However, members of the Stan
ford Community Association to
Reinstate Bicycle Access, a new

group which plans to fight the
enforcement, disagree with the
singling out of bicyclists as of
fenders.
Spearheading the fledgling 12-
member movement is graduate
student Roman Dial, second-place
finisher in the 200-mile Alaska
Iditarod Mountain Bike Competi
tion. Dial called the Dish area "the
greatest network of single-track
trails from Marin to Big Basin"
and denounced the prohibition as
"a serious affront to recrea
tionalists at Stanford."
