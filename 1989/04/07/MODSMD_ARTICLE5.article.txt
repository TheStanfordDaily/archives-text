## 
### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
A watered-down measure de
signed to help students, Resident
Fellows and instructors plan
around evening midterms was
passed by the Faculty Senate yes
terday afternoon after lively
debate.
The senate also passed a formal
policy on the use of vertebrate
animals in teaching.
The new evening midterm mea
sure requires instructors who plan
to give midterms outside of reg
ular class hours to provide alter
nate times for students incon
venienced by these exams.
But that requirement is only
half of what tne Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achieve

ment recommended in a proposal
to the senate.
The other provision in the
original proposal would have
forced classes giving evening mid
terms to announce the dates and
times of their exams in the Time
Schedule.
After joking that they were the
"main offenders" in scheduling
out-of-class midterms, Biology
and Human Biology professors
spearheaded an attack on the
Time Schedule clause, leading the
majority of the senate to vote
against this provision.
Human Biology Chair Craig
Heller argued that evening exams
were designed to help students by
giving them more time to consider
