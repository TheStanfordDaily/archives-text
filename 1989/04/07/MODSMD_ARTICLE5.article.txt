# Fac Sen: let students avoid late-night tests
## 
### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
A watered-down measure de
signed to help students, Resident
Fellows and instructors plan
around evening midterms was
passed by the Faculty Senate yes
terday afternoon after lively
debate.
The senate also passed a formal
policy on the use of vertebrate
animals in teaching.
The new evening midterm mea
sure requires instructors who plan
to give midterms outside of reg
ular class hours to provide alter
nate times for students incon
venienced by these exams.
But that requirement is only
half of what tne Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achieve

ment recommended in a proposal
to the senate.
The other provision in the
original proposal would have
forced classes giving evening mid
terms to announce the dates and
times of their exams in the Time
Schedule.
After joking that they were the
"main offenders" in scheduling
out-of-class midterms, Biology
and Human Biology professors
spearheaded an attack on the
Time Schedule clause, leading the
majority of the senate to vote
against this provision.
Human Biology Chair Craig
Heller argued that evening exams
were designed to help students by
giving them more time to consider
test questions and review their
answers. Students complained
that they did not have enough
time when exams were just one
hour, he said.
Heller added that the Time
Schedule's publication deadline is
so early that Human Biology pro
fessors would not be able to de
termine their midterm plans in
time to have them printed. He
said that students were informed
of the exam times "weeks ahead
of time" because they were
printed in course syllabi.
Biology Prof. Robert Simoni
called evening exams a minor
issue and said, "I don't see there
is a necessity to legislate."
German Studies Chair Orrin

Robinson 111, who headed the
committee which introduced the
proposal, said students and RFs
had complained about the lengthy
evening exams because they con
flicted with other classes and Res
Ed programming.
Finally put to a vote, the mea
sure passed by about a two-thirds
majority.
The animal use policy, revised
from one presented Feb. 25, per
mits the use of live or deceased
vertebrate animals in class only
when the instructor judges the
use to be necessary for the "ed
ucational goals of the program or
course" and if it is "humane,
proper ... appropriate" and legal.
This second stipulation is the
result of a request by several
senators that the policy weigh the
pain and suffering of the animals
with the teaching value of their
use.
