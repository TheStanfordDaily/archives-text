# Law students join in nationwide action to protest discrimination
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
About one-fourth of Stan
ford's Law School students
boycotted classes yesterday to
attend educational "teach-in
forums" and hold a rally outside
the Law School to protest rac
ism, sexism and homophobia,
joining over 35 law schools
across the country in a "Na

tional Day of Action."
The event was organized at
Stanford by leaders of the Law
School's minority groups, who
are united under the auspices
of the Multicultural Council.
At the rally, the student or
ganizers, some wearing black
arm bands and red T-shirts with
the silk-screened words "Une
qual Treatment Under the
I,aw," presented a summary of

proposals to eliminate "discrim
ination and oppression that is
present in law schools as insti
tutions."
The proposals were suggested
by both moderators and audi
ence members at the four
forums, which addressed the is
sues of the interviewing process,
admissions criteria, curricula

Law students boycotted classes and braved the scorching heat to demonstrate against racism,
sexism and homophobia as part of a "National Day of Action."
and faculty hiring.
A crowd of 75 to 100 students
applauded the various speakers at
the rally and joined in chants such
as "sexism, racism we say no,
Baker & McKenzie has got to go"
— in reference to the law firm
that was banned Tuesday from
interviewing on campus because
of racist comments made by one
of its recruiters during a law stu
dent interview.
A handful of faculty members,
including Law School Dean Paul
Brest, attended the forums, and
Brest also spoke at the rally. He
admitted "Stanford has a long
way to go to remedy problems of
racism, sexism and homophobia"
but emphasized that "we're com
mitted to (doing) it."

Catherine Kissee-Sandoval, co
chair of the Stanford Latin Amer
ican Law Students Association,
said that "a lot of constructive
proposals for change" were of
fered at the forums. Among the
highlights:
• Create training programs,
mini-courses and workshops
about issues of racism and sexism
for both students and faculty;
• Hire more qualified minority,
female, gay, lesbian and bisexual
faculty members; and
• Seek participation of repre
sentatives from various student
groups in the admissions process.
Kissee-Sandoval said that the
Multicultural Council would
prepare a complete list of these
proposals in a report to be pre
sented "within three weeks" to
the Law School faculty and ad
ministration as well as to the en
tire Stanford community.

The council previously prepared
an eight-page document stating its
positions on the issues that were
considered in the forums and dis
tributed copies of it to all Law
School students and faculty on
Tuesday.
In a phone interview after the
rally, Brest said some of the pro
posals are already being imple
mented.
Audrey MacFarlane, co-chair of
the Black Law Students Associa
tion, applauded the "good faith
efforts" of the Law School com
munity as a whole to address these
issues but said "nothing has hap
pened."
Some disapproved of the Mul
ticultural Council's organization
of the events. Law Prof. Robert
Gordon, who attended some of the
forums and canceled one of his
classes because of low attendance,

said, "I thought a lot of important
issues were being discussed ...
but many points of view were not
represented."
A Law School student who spoke
on the condition of anonymity
said he felt that a boycott of
classes is an inappropriate method
of protest for a place like Stan
ford. He added that the Law
School makes a great effort "to
understand and respect the per
spective (of minority stu
dents). ... I don't know what
more can be done" to address mi
norities' concerns.
Nevertheless, the students who
boycotted classes and attended the
forums remain confident that
they can gain changes at the Law
School. Whitney Lee, co-chair of
the Black Law Students Associa
tion, said, "Student action works
here at Stanford."
