## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
About one-fourth of Stan
ford's Law School students
boycotted classes yesterday to
attend educational "teach-in
forums" and hold a rally outside
the Law School to protest rac
ism, sexism and homophobia,
joining over 35 law schools
across the country in a "Na

tional Day of Action."
The event was organized at
Stanford by leaders of the Law
School's minority groups, who
are united under the auspices
of the Multicultural Council.
At the rally, the student or
ganizers, some wearing black
arm bands and red T-shirts with
the silk-screened words "Une
qual Treatment Under the
I,aw," presented a summary of

proposals to eliminate "discrim
ination and oppression that is
present in law schools as insti
tutions."
The proposals were suggested
by both moderators and audi
ence members at the four
forums, which addressed the is
sues of the interviewing process,
admissions criteria, curricula
