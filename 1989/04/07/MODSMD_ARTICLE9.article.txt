## Ueberroth group will buy Eastern Deal would give employees partial ownership of the crippled airline 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - A group
led by former baseball commis
sioner Peter Ueberroth agreed
yesterday to buy strike-crippled
Eastern Airlines, and a union
spokesman said he was cautiously
optimistic the deal could end the
month-old walkout.
The $464 million agreement
would give employees a 30 percent
share in the company in exchange
for wage concessions.
The sale by Eastern's parent,
Texas Air Corp., is subject to ap
proval by U.S. Bankruptcy Court
and Eastern's creditors. Eastern
also must reach new work agree
ments with its striking unions by
midnight Tuesday, under terms
of the sale.
"Under this agreement, Eastern
can be back flying in very short
order," said Texas Air Chairman
Frank Lorenzo, who has been the
target of bitter personal attacks
from union members.
About 500 striking Machinists
jammed a union hall in Miami,
where Eastern is based, cheering
and chanting, "Take me out to
the ball game!" and "Hey, hey!
Ho, ho! Lorenzo's got to go!" after
hearing of the sale.
Eastern has been virtually
paralyzed since March 4 by the
Machinists' strike, which has
drawn the support of pilots and
flight attendants. Eastern filed
March 9 for protection from
creditors in bankruptcy court as
its cash dried up.
"It's a mammoth challenge,"
said Ueberroth. "I'm convinced
that there is a spirit amongst the
people in the company that I can

help bring together to help this
airline."
The sale includes Eastern's
highly profitable Northeast
shuttle, but Ueberroth will follow
through on an earlier agreement
to sell the service to developer
Donald Trump for $365 million.
Ueberroth, who stepped down
as baseball commissioner Satur
day, was vice president of Trans
International Airlines for two

years and founded a travel agency
in Southern California in 1963.
First Travel Corp. eventually grew
into the second-largest agency in
North America.
He was organizer of the 1984
Los Angeles Olympics, which
turned a profit of $230 million
and put him on the cover of Time
magazine as Man of the Year. As
baseball commissioner, he turned
the game from a $67 million-a

year money-loser to one that
made $100 million last year.
Frank Ortis, vice president of
Machinists Local 702 and Miami
strike coordinator, said it was im
possible to tell whether unions
would fare better "until we get
into dealings with Commissioner
Ueberroth."
"However, we're willing to give
it a shot," he said.
