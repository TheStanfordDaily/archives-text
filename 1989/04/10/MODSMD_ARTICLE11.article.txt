# Israel and PLO talking indirectly

JERUSALEM (AP) -
Finance Minister Shimon
Peres said Israel was negotiat
ing indirectly with the PLO
through U.S. mediators,
despite Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's opposition to dealing
with the organization.
Also yesterday, Arab reports
said that soldiers fatally shot
two Palestinians and wounded
11 in violence that came on the
second day of a general strike
in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip. The strike was
called to mark the 17th month
of the uprising, which has
killed 422 Palestinians and 18
Israelis.
Peres, head of the left
leaning Labor Party, made his
comment about the PLO as he
spoke on Israel radio about
Shamir's plan for elections in
the occupied lands.
He said Israel had in effect
conceded its longstanding
refusal to talk to the Palestine
Liberation Organization by
having the Americans mediate
on the election question.
"The United States is at this
moment a mediator between us
and the Palestinians, including
the PLO, even though this isn't
to our liking," he said.
Peres also said he accepted
Shamir's election idea but an
ticipated difficulties because
Shamir, of the right-wing
Likud bloc, refused the Pales
tinian demand for interna
tional supervision of the bal
loting.
Shamir's plan calls for Pal
estinians in the occupied lands
to select representatives to ne
gotiate an interim solution for
the disputed territories.
In the West Bank city of
Hebron, a curfew was imposed
after troops shot to death a
60-year-old laborer. The army
said the man attacked soldiers
with a pitchfork.
Arab reports said the man,
Ahmad Mohammed Sneineh,

'The United States
is now a mediator
between us and the
PLO, even though
this isn't to our
liking'
â€” Shimon Peres

attacked after a soldier struck
a woman who was trying to
block Sneineh's arrest.
In the Gaza Strip village of
Jabaliya, Mahmoud Dib Nab
han, 12, died of a plastic bullet
wound to the chest and six
other youths were injured
when the army responded with
gunfire to a firebomb attack,
Arab reports said.
The army confirmed the
death but said only three
youths were wounded.
Also yesterday, Police Minis
ter Chaim Bar-Lev said Israel
is considering blocking West
Bank Arabs from going to the
A 1 Aqsa and Dome of the Rock
mosques in Jerusalem's Old
City because of riots outside
the mosques Friday.
About a dozen people were
injured in stoning attacks,
which spilled over from the
mosques to the adjacent West
em Wall, which Jews believe
is the last remnant of their an
cient temple. It is Judaism's
holiest site.
Thirty-seven people were
detained in the rioting, many
of them from the West Bank,
police said.
Peres, who chaired yester
day's weekly Cabinet session
while Shamir was in the United
States, said the government
"authorizes security forces to
act in any way possible so that
such an incident does not recur
in the future," a Cabinet com
munique said.
