## Abortion rally in D.C. draws 300,000 Supreme Court to hear a Missouri case which challenges Roe v. Wade 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - With
cries of "choice" and symbolic coat
hangers hung from their clothing,
hundreds of thousands of abortion
rights activists marched yesterday
the nation's Capitol hoping to
avert a return to the days of back
alley abortions.
"We're scared," said Ellen
Davidson, a Yale University junior
from Hewlett, N.Y. Scared, she
said, because "we're coming to the
realization that the thing we've
taken for granted can be taken
away."
The Supreme Court will hear
arguments April 26 in a Missouri
case that pro-choice and anti
abortion forces agree could signif
icantly alter the 1973 Roe v. Wade
decision that gave women the
right to an abortion.
"I'm thrilled to have my baby,"
said Kristin McNamara of College
Park, Md., as she wheeled 4-week
old Kathryn in a stroller during
the march from the Washington
Monument to the Capitol. "But I
think a woman must have a choice
to decide whether and when to
have a child."
Law enforcement authorities es
timated the rally crowd at
300,000. Eleanor Smeal, president
of the Fund for the Feminist
Mtyority, said it was more than
600,000. By comparison, some
90,000 people gathered for a
March 1986 pro-abortion rally in
Washington.
The turnout was higher than
even organizers had predicted,
and yesterday they were speaking
of a new-found political clout.
"It's a turning point. It's a to
tally new ball game," Smeal said.
"It's given us the confidence that
we are the majority."
The women's rights advocates
— men and women, Democrats
and Republicans and a host of
celebrities — traded taunts with
about 200-300 anti-abortion pro
testers who stood along the Con
stitution Avenue march route.
Police, some on horseback, kept
the opposing forces apart.
The anti-abortion activists set
up a symbolic "Cemetery of the
Innocents" on the Washington

Mall containing 4,400 white
wooden crosses and Stars of Da
vid. That, organizers said is the
number of unborn children killed
daily since the Supreme Court
legalized abortion.
At the Capitol, Molly Yard,
president of the National Organ
ization for Women, vowed to
"raise a political army" to ensure
that abortion rights are protected.
"If they (politicians) don't get the
message, we will replace them
with pro-choice."
"We're terribly empowered by
this," Yard said. "It means we
can go ahead with what we've
planned to do on this issue with
more troops."
Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y.,
declared, "I have a message for
the man at 1600 Pennsylvania
Avenue and the nine Supreme
Court justices. Read my lips. Pro
choice, pro-choice, pro-choice."
The crowd picked up the chant.
President Bush, in one of his
first acts after taking office in
January, told anti-abortion ac
tivists at a rally outside the White
House he wanted the Supreme
Court's Roe v. Wade decision over
turned.
Speakers suggested yesterday
that Bush's wife, Barbara, was
pro-choice. Mrs. Bush's press sec
retary, Anna Perez, responded,
"Her position is that this is one
of those issues where she will not
discuss her views with anyone ex
cept, perhaps, her husband."
Many of yesterday's demonstra
tors wore white, the color of the
suffragettes who fought for wom
en's right to vote. Some brought
their young children. They carried
signs saying: "Motherhood Should
Always Be a Choice," "Roe Roe
Roe or Sink," and "Going Public
for Privacy."
Wire coat hangers were hung
from the clothing of many mar
chers, who carried signs saying,
"Never Again." It was a reference
to the often deadly self-abortion
technique used by women in the
United States before the proce
dure was legalized.
Whoopi Goldberg said: "Abor
tion is a negative experience. It's

not something you want to go
through, but if you need one, you
should have one that's safe. I
don't want anyone to end up on
the bathroom floor with a coat
hanger."
Students came in bus loads
from campuses across the coun
try. Though most are too young
to remember the days before the
Supreme Court legalized abortion

in 1973, students said they rec
ognize the threat now posed by a
mqjor challenge to that ruling.
The Missouri statute outlaws
abortions and abortion counseling
in public facilities, but still per
mits abortions in privately run
facilities. It also requires doctors
to try to save fetuses aborted after
a specified age of gestation.
