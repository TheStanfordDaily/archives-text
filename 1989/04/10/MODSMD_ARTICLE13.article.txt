MOSCOW (AP) - A Stalin
biographer and the head of an
independent Lithuanian political
group were among candidates who
competed in yesterday's runoff
elections for seats in the new So
viet parliament.
It was the second stage of the
Soviet Union's first multican
didate national elections.
In the first round on March 26,
voters rejected at least 45 govern
ment and Communist Party
leaders in their bids for seats in
the new Congress of People's
Deputies.
Yesterday's runoffs involved 64
districts in which no candidate
won the required 50 percent
mjyority in the first election be
cause three or more candidates
split the vote.
In one race, Stalin biographer
Roy Medvedev faced Ksenya
Razumova, head of an atomic re
search laboratory in Moscow. Vir

jijjus Chepaitis, head of the Lit
huanian alternative political
group ran against Ivan
Tikhonovich, dean of the Vilnius
Pedagogical Institute in the Lit
huanian capital of Vilnius.
The 2,250-member congress
will choose a new Supreme Soviet,
the country's policy-making body.
Another round of elections with
new candidates will be held May
14 in 123 districts in which can
didates ran unopposed and still
lost in the March balloting, and
in 76 districts in which two can
didates both failed to garner 50
percent of the vote. Voters could
reject all of the candidates.
Yuri Solovyov, the Communist
Party chief of Leningrad, was
among top party officials across
the country who ran unopposed
in March and still were defeated.
Outside a polling station in
Moscow, voters bought orange
soda and chocolate bars after cas

'People are in a good
mood (at the polling
stations), it's a pleas
ant atmosphere'

ting their ballots.
"It's about the same atmos
phere as last time," said conces
sion worker Anatoly Mitin.
"People are in a good mood, it's
a pleasant atmosphere."
Vladimir Orlov, chairman of the
Central Electoral Commission,
praised the nominating process
that led up to the elections.
"Candidates were nominated
not for their ranks or trumpeted
promise 3 but for their high moral
standards and ability to contrib
ute to the restructuring drive,"
Orlov told the official news agency
Tass.
