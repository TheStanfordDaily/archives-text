Namibia a step closer to freedom
WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) - South Africa
agreed yesterday to allow black nationalist guer
rillas safe passage from northern Namibia to
Angola in an offer aimed at preserving plans for
Namibia's independence.
The proposal could bring to an end the fighting
between South African-led security forces and
guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Or
ganization. The violence has threatened to derail
the U.N.-supervised plan for Namibian indepen
dence from South Africa.
There was no immediate comment on the offer
from the South-West Africa People's Organiza
tion, or SWAPO, which has been fighting for
independence since 1966.
However, the withdrawal plan appeared similar
to a proposal made earlier yesterday by guerrilla
leader Sam Ntyoma, who called on his fighters
to stop firing, regroup and allow themselves to
be escorted into Angola by U.N. personnel.
South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha an
nounced the plan following two days of talks
between his government, Angola, Cuba, and U.S.

and Soviet observers. The talks were held at
Mount Etjo, a private safari lodge 120 miles
north of Windhoek.
The withdrawal plan gives the guerrillas until
April 15 to leave Namibia.
Gas prices surge after oil spill
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Gasoline prices rose
more than a dime after the grounding of the
Exxon Valdez, the greatest single wholesale price
increase in the history of the U.S. gasoline mar
ket, according to a national survey.
The average retail price of a gallon of gasoline
from March 17 to April 7 rose to 110.63 cents,
up from the previous 100.37 cents, Trilby
Lundberg, publisher of the Lundberg Survey,
said yesterday. But she said there were signs
prices were easing.
The surge in gas prices followed the brief
shutoff of Alaskan oil shipments after the tanker
accident temporarily closed the Port of Valdez.
It has since reopened, and Lundberg said prices
already were beginning to fall by yesterday.
