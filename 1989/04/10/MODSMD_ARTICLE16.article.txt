## Mailing's failing

LINING UP IS a natural
part of Stanford living. Wit
ness the long, weaving
chains of people that form in Old
Union when class signups come
around. Or how about those hour
long waits at the Bookstore dur
ing textbook-buying time?
Mile-long lines exist at Stan
ford, but the line that used to
form for picking up grades was
never a big deal. After a quarter's
worth of hard work, students did
not mind waiting in a 10-minute
line to see if their diligence paid
off.
Unfortunately, the Registrar's
Office thought otherwise and
changed the procedure for getting
winter quarter grades. Rather
than let students pick up their
grades the first day back from
break, the Registrar's Office
decided to let the post office
deliver them.
If the post office lives up to

its track record, this new system
means more frustration for stu
dents than any long line could
cause.
Reportedly, some students have
yet to receive their grades. Given
that admissions to graduate
schools and Mom and Dad's hap
piness often depend on GPAs,
playing this waiting game with
the post office creates unneces
sary anxiety.
Beyond the nerve-racking fac
tor are practical reasons for going
back to the old system. Several
advanced classes require certain
minimum grades from previous
classes.
And lining up for grades actu
ally cost $2,300 less than the new
mailing procedure.
When it comes to something
as important as finding out their
grades, students are willing to
wait out just one more line.
