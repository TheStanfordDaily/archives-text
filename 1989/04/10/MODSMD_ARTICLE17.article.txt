# Unhappy trails

### 
JOGGERS CAN still huff and
puff as they enjoy the view.
Cows continue to graze up
there. A 2,000-pound horse can
gallop up the grassy hills. But
cyclists can only look up at the
Dish and complain.
"No cyclists anymore" reads a
sign posted at an entrance to the
Stanford Foothills.
Without warning, the Univer
sity decided over spring break to
enforce a long-forgotten policy
that prohibits cyclists from ex
ploring some of the best moun
tain biking trails in the Bay Area.
The University argues that
mountain biking causes more
erosion than other recreational
activities. If this is true, why did
the University wait until spring

quarter — when the trails are
dry and solid — to enforce the
ban? If there really are erosion
problems, wouldn't it have made
more sense to keep bikers off
trails during the wet and muddy
season?
Given the number of enthusi
astic cyclists here, the University
should have discussed the prob
lem with bikers before reaching
such an unpopular decision. But
maybe it's not too late.
Outraged bikers have joined to
gether to fight the Dish decision.
The University could meet with
this new group and strike a bar
gain: Bikers could continue to en
joy the foothills in exchange for
10 hours of trail maintenance
work each quarter.
