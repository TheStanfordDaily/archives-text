Poor safety record
necessitates a look
into research center
Ten years ago the oil industry and
builders of the Alaska pipeline scoffed
at environmentalists who predicted a
catastrophe just like Exxon's at Valdez.
They were called enemies of progress,
obstructionists in the way of freeing us
from the tyranny of foreign oil and
opponents of ensuring the continuation
of the American way of life for decades
to come.
There is an uncomfortable similarity
between that and the contumely that
the scientific establishment has been
heaping upon the individuals and or
ganizations, such as the Palo Alto
Humane Society, who have sought to
call attention to the flip side of the
golden coin of biotechnology.
Irving Weissman's March 8 letter to
The Daily is an example. He charges
us — and me in particular — with
having "blocked or delayed research in
the service of humans" and intimates
that the continued suffering of AIDS
patients is somehow on my or our
heads.
Our offence was the insistence upon
an environmental impact report (EIR)
for the new Research Animal Facility
(RAF II). In this we have merely done
what communities all over the country
are now doing as new research facili
ties are being built in their midst.
It is a result of the lessons learned
from the wondrous new technologies of
the last 40 years, each of which was to
make for, and to some extent has
produced, a better way of life, but
which have also given us nuclear
wastes, polluted ground water, a
poisoned earth and a damaged atmos
phere.
Biotechnology — in whose service
RAF II is being built — is the latest
in the series. And the fact that in the

It is a result of the lessons

last forty years, each of
which was to make for,
and to some extent has
produced, a better way of
life, but which have also
given us nuclear wastes,
polluted ground water, a
poisoned earth and a
damaged atmosphere.

10 to 15 years of its existence it has
not yet created a catastrophe is no
guarantee that it never will.
Officials in Valdez have known for
quite some time that there were "prob
lems in the tankers." Well, we, when
asked for an GIR, had known for quite
some time that there were problems at
Stanford.
This is the place where workers have
been exposed to fiberglass and as
bestos.
This is the place that quite recently
declined to argue in court and settle
out of it a suit charging waste, mis
management, legal violations, cover-ups
and intimidation involving the con
struction of laboratory and waste dis
posal facilities and the handling of
hazardous materials.
Given these less than reassuring
safeguards provided by Stanford it was
perhaps not too monstrous of PAHS to
suggest that the University, through
the mechanism of an EIR, take a good
and careful look at its new RAF 11.
It is being built in earthquake coun
try, entirely underground, close to the
water table and dependent upon elec
tricity for air and light. It is destined

to serve as an ancillary facility to the
Center for Molecular and Genetic
Medicine that a very confident (one
may ask just why) university and a
very indulgent Santa Clara Planning
Commissions had not considered in
need of such scrutiny.
Finally, had Stanford not been
cavalierly indifferent to the well-being
of the dogs and primates to be housed
in the new facility, PAHS' attention
would never have been drawn to the
lack of an EIR.
But, Stanford arrogantly disdained
making special allowance for its provi
sions.
You could thus say that it was hoist
by its own petard. Dare one hope there
could be a cautionary tale in this?

obstructionists in the way of freeing us
from the tyranny of foreign oil and
opponents of ensuring the continuation
of the American way of life for decades
to come.
There is an uncomfortable similarity
between that and the contumely that
the scientific establishment has been
heaping upon the individuals and or
ganizations, such as the Palo Alto
Humane Society, who have sought to
call attention to the flip side of the
golden coin of biotechnology.
Irving Weissman's March 8 letter to
The Daily is an example. He charges
us — and me in particular — with
having "blocked or delayed research in
the service of humans" and intimates
that the continued suffering of AIDS
patients is somehow on my or our
heads.
Our offence was the insistence upon
an environmental impact report (EIR)
for the new Research Animal Facility
(RAF II). In this we have merely done
what communities all over the country
are now doing as new research facili
ties are being built in their midst.
It is a result of the lessons learned
from the wondrous new technologies of
the last 40 years, each of which was to
make for, and to some extent has
produced, a better way of life, but
which have also given us nuclear
wastes, polluted ground water, a
poisoned earth and a damaged atmos
phere.
Biotechnology — in whose service
RAF II is being built — is the latest
in the series. And the fact that in the

10 to 15 years of its existence it has
not yet created a catastrophe is no
guarantee that it never will.
Officials in Valdez have known for
quite some time that there were "prob
lems in the tankers." Well, we, when
asked for an GIR, had known for quite
some time that there were problems at
Stanford.
This is the place where workers have
been exposed to fiberglass and as
bestos.
This is the place that quite recently
declined to argue in court and settle
out of it a suit charging waste, mis
management, legal violations, cover-ups
and intimidation involving the con
struction of laboratory and waste dis
posal facilities and the handling of
hazardous materials.
Given these less than reassuring
safeguards provided by Stanford it was
perhaps not too monstrous of PAHS to
suggest that the University, through
the mechanism of an EIR, take a good
and careful look at its new RAF 11.
It is being built in earthquake coun
try, entirely underground, close to the
water table and dependent upon elec
tricity for air and light. It is destined

to serve as an ancillary facility to the
Center for Molecular and Genetic
Medicine that a very confident (one
may ask just why) university and a
very indulgent Santa Clara Planning
Commissions had not considered in
need of such scrutiny.
Finally, had Stanford not been
cavalierly indifferent to the well-being
of the dogs and primates to be housed
in the new facility, PAHS' attention
would never have been drawn to the
lack of an EIR.
But, Stanford arrogantly disdained
making special allowance for its provi
sions.
You could thus say that it was hoist
by its own petard. Dare one hope there
could be a cautionary tale in this?

Stay away from
my lovely daffodils,
you big meanies
To whomever trampled my daffodil
bed in front of the American Studies
House last Friday night, that was very
clever.

Perhaps you and I can get together
and beat up little old ladies sometime.

Undergrads should
be able to live in
Rains this summer
To quote the Stanford summer
housing '88-'B9 informational
pamphlet, "Rains is a graduate student
residence and is not available as a
housing choice to undergraduates." But
feel free to live in Escondido Village or
Crothers Memorial Hall.
What's with the contradictory policy?
