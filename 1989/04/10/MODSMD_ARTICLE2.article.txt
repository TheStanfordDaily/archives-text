# SATs, grades rise for Class of '93
## 
### Sophia Shing Staff writer 
More than 14,000 high school
seniors rushed to their mailboxes
last week, as Undergraduate Ad
missions notified the 2,547 poten
tial members of Stanford's class
of 1993 that they had been ac
cepted.
Despite a drop in the overall
number of applications, this
year's applicant pool had an in
crease from last year in the two
numerical measures of quality —
SATs and grade point averages,
according to statistics released
Friday by Undergraduate Admis
sions.
Minority admittees, except
black students, will comprise a
larger percentage of the prospec
tive class than last year. Down
from 10.7 percent in 1988, black
students make up 10 percent of
this year's admitted class. Up
from 8.3 percent last year,
Mexican-American students com
prise 8.6 percent of the class;
Native Americans 1.1 percent (up
from 0.8 percent); and Asian-
Americans 18.7 (up from 17.4 per
cent.)
Junior Richard Suh, chair of
the Asian-American Association,
said that before he'll praise a rise
in the acceptance rate of Asian-
American he would like to know
"what types of Asian-American
students were admitted. While
Undergraduate Admissions con

siders black, Mexican-American
and Native American students as
targeted minorities, Asian-
Americans are not a targeted mi
nority.
The Admissions Office shouiJ
improve lower yield rates for
Filipinos, South Eastern and low
income Asian-American students,
Suh said.
Freshman Noel Bravo, a mem
ber of MEChA, a Chicano/Latino
student organization, said, "This
increase makes the unavailability
of facilities for Chicano students
even more glaring. Hopefully the
University will be able to meet
our needs."
Speaking on behalf of Stanford
American Indian Organization,
sophomore Cassandra Nordstrand
said, "The American Indian com
munity at Stanford is known for
being supportive. Therefore many
American Indian students [apply]
to Stanford.
"The more students we have
here, the more role models we
will have to encourage students
not only to come to Stanford but
just to go to college," Nordstrand
said.
Leaders of the Black Student
Union were not available for com
ment yesterday.
Reflecting a 6 percent decrease
from 1988, the number of appli
cations this year was 14,912. Dean
of Undergraduate Admissions
Jean Fetter attributed the smaller
pool to a national decline in the
number of high school graduates.
"This decline is projected to
continue through the early
19905," Fetter said.
Fetter speculated that increas
ing consideration among families
about the higher cost of private
schools vs. less expensive state
run institutions may have also
contributed to the drop in
applicant numbers.
"It's disheartening for parents
to deal with cost," she said, "but
Stanford has a policy of need-blind
admissions."

In addition, as universities
across the nation are becoming
more selective, students are be
coming more realistic about their
chances of being admitted, accord
ing to Fetter. More of the most
competitive students were apply
ing," she said.
Regardless of the decline, the
total number of applicants with a
combined SAT score of at least
1,400 was 2,726, compared to
2,650 last year. Moreover, 3,208
applicants presented 4.0 grade
point averages, up from 3,101 in
1988.
Stanford sent out acceptance
letters to 2,547 students, which
amounts to 17 percent of the total
14,912 applications. The enroll
ment in the freshman class of

1993 is anticipated to be close to
1,575.
Offers were sent to applicants
in every state and to more than
40 foreign countries. Women con
stitute 44 percent of the admitted
class.
Applicants were asked to
describe one of the best conversa
tions they have had and to discuss
the best book they ever read.
The most popular books were
science fiction or autobiographies
and some of the most interesting
conversations were dialogues stu
dents had with themselves, Fetter
said.
"Reading applications was a for
midable assignment, as it always
is, but we couldn't have done it
without the wonderful staff we
have," she said.

midable assignment, as it always
is, but we couldn't have done it
without the wonderful staff we
have," she said.
More than 14,000 high school
seniors rushed to their mailboxes
last week, as Undergraduate Ad
missions notified the 2,547 poten
tial members of Stanford's class
of 1993 that they had been ac
cepted.
Despite a drop in the overall
number of applications, this
year's applicant pool had an in
crease from last year in the two
numerical measures of quality —
SATs and grade point averages,
according to statistics released
Friday by Undergraduate Admis
sions.
Minority admittees, except
black students, will comprise a
larger percentage of the prospec
tive class than last year. Down
from 10.7 percent in 1988, black
students make up 10 percent of
this year's admitted class. Up
from 8.3 percent last year,
Mexican-American students com
prise 8.6 percent of the class;
Native Americans 1.1 percent (up
from 0.8 percent); and Asian-
Americans 18.7 (up from 17.4 per
cent.)
Junior Richard Suh, chair of
the Asian-American Association,
said that before he'll praise a rise
in the acceptance rate of Asian-
American he would like to know
"what types of Asian-American
students were admitted. While
Undergraduate Admissions con

siders black, Mexican-American
and Native American students as
targeted minorities, Asian-
Americans are not a targeted mi
nority.
The Admissions Office shouiJ
improve lower yield rates for
Filipinos, South Eastern and low
income Asian-American students,
Suh said.
Freshman Noel Bravo, a mem
ber of MEChA, a Chicano/Latino
student organization, said, "This
increase makes the unavailability
of facilities for Chicano students
even more glaring. Hopefully the
University will be able to meet
our needs."
Speaking on behalf of Stanford
American Indian Organization,
sophomore Cassandra Nordstrand
said, "The American Indian com
munity at Stanford is known for
being supportive. Therefore many
American Indian students [apply]
to Stanford.
"The more students we have
here, the more role models we
will have to encourage students
not only to come to Stanford but
just to go to college," Nordstrand
said.
Leaders of the Black Student
Union were not available for com
ment yesterday.
Reflecting a 6 percent decrease
from 1988, the number of appli
cations this year was 14,912. Dean
of Undergraduate Admissions
Jean Fetter attributed the smaller
pool to a national decline in the
number of high school graduates.
"This decline is projected to
continue through the early
19905," Fetter said.
Fetter speculated that increas
ing consideration among families
about the higher cost of private
schools vs. less expensive state
run institutions may have also
contributed to the drop in
applicant numbers.
"It's disheartening for parents
to deal with cost," she said, "but
Stanford has a policy of need-blind
admissions."

In addition, as universities
across the nation are becoming
more selective, students are be
coming more realistic about their
chances of being admitted, accord
ing to Fetter. More of the most
competitive students were apply
ing," she said.
Regardless of the decline, the
total number of applicants with a
combined SAT score of at least
1,400 was 2,726, compared to
2,650 last year. Moreover, 3,208
applicants presented 4.0 grade
point averages, up from 3,101 in
1988.
Stanford sent out acceptance
letters to 2,547 students, which
amounts to 17 percent of the total
14,912 applications. The enroll
ment in the freshman class of

1993 is anticipated to be close to
1,575.
Offers were sent to applicants
in every state and to more than
40 foreign countries. Women con
stitute 44 percent of the admitted
class.
Applicants were asked to
describe one of the best conversa
tions they have had and to discuss
the best book they ever read.
The most popular books were
science fiction or autobiographies
and some of the most interesting
conversations were dialogues stu
dents had with themselves, Fetter
said.
"Reading applications was a for
midable assignment, as it always
is, but we couldn't have done it
without the wonderful staff we
have," she said.
