### Sophia Shing Staff writer 
More than 14,000 high school
seniors rushed to their mailboxes
last week, as Undergraduate Ad
missions notified the 2,547 poten
tial members of Stanford's class
of 1993 that they had been ac
cepted.
Despite a drop in the overall
number of applications, this
year's applicant pool had an in
crease from last year in the two
numerical measures of quality â€”
SATs and grade point averages,
according to statistics released
Friday by Undergraduate Admis
sions.
Minority admittees, except
black students, will comprise a
larger percentage of the prospec
tive class than last year. Down
from 10.7 percent in 1988, black
students make up 10 percent of
this year's admitted class. Up
from 8.3 percent last year,
Mexican-American students com
prise 8.6 percent of the class;
Native Americans 1.1 percent (up
from 0.8 percent); and Asian-
Americans 18.7 (up from 17.4 per
cent.)
Junior Richard Suh, chair of
the Asian-American Association,
said that before he'll praise a rise
in the acceptance rate of Asian-
American he would like to know
"what types of Asian-American
students were admitted. While
Undergraduate Admissions con

siders black, Mexican-American
and Native American students as
targeted minorities, Asian-
Americans are not a targeted mi
nority.
The Admissions Office shouiJ
improve lower yield rates for
Filipinos, South Eastern and low
income Asian-American students,
Suh said.
Freshman Noel Bravo, a mem
ber of MEChA, a Chicano/Latino
student organization, said, "This
increase makes the unavailability
of facilities for Chicano students
even more glaring. Hopefully the
University will be able to meet
our needs."
Speaking on behalf of Stanford
American Indian Organization,
sophomore Cassandra Nordstrand
said, "The American Indian com
munity at Stanford is known for
being supportive. Therefore many
American Indian students [apply]
to Stanford.
"The more students we have
here, the more role models we
will have to encourage students
not only to come to Stanford but
just to go to college," Nordstrand
said.
Leaders of the Black Student
Union were not available for com
ment yesterday.
Reflecting a 6 percent decrease
from 1988, the number of appli
cations this year was 14,912. Dean
