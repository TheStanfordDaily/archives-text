## In the bowels of Cowell 
### 
EVERY WOMAN is pregnant. Every
injury, just a strain. And no matter
how wet a cough is, it's always
attributed to "that flu that's going
around."
If any of this sounds familiar, you've
probably just been talking to someone
about Cowell. The thing, though, is that
our student health center isn't that bad,
and one of its departments might even
be considered exemplary.
It's not visited by as large a percentage
of the Stanford community as the main
floor, but it gets quite a bit of traffic all
the same.
The physical therapy department is in
the basement along with the contracep
tive counter and the cold clinic. But the
man in charge of PT does much more
than dispense pills and other party favors.
If it is possible for a god to reside in
the asbestos-ridden basement of a uni
versity health clinic, then it is this man.
There are some who call him ... Tim.
It's a familiar name to the hundreds
of runners, bikers, swimmers and just
plain klutzes who have visited him in his
subterranean lair.
Considering the number of athletes at
Stanford, it isn't all that surprising that
a physical therapist would get a lot of
business. But how many people would
feel compelled to keep using Cowell doc
tors for an ongoing problem?
If Tim were just a physical therapist,
perhaps he would still have loads of
patients, but how many of them would
keep coming back, week after week,
month after month?
There are lots of toys in the PT de

partment that might explain all the
repeat business. There are two
whirlpools, an electrical stimulation
gizmo and an ultrasound doohickey. But
anyone can work a machine. And some
of the devices used in this department
are so arcane to the typical person that
they appear less as toys and more as
torture devices.
Tim has something, though, that takes
the scariness out of not just these mac
hines, but out of the injuries themselves.
It could be his sense of humor, which
is quirky but disarming. His jokes take
his patients' minds off of what they are
about to undergo by focusing their fears
and making them funny.
The electrical stimulation machine is
the most scary in the PT department.
Everyone has had a little shock at some
time in his or her life, and the idea of
purposely subjecting someone to serious
voltage tends to be a bit disconcerting.
"As you lose consciousness, you'll feel
a light tapping coming from the pads."
You know that you aren't going to pass
out, but at the same time, the less ra
tional part of your brain is saying that
you are. By voicing this fear, Tim makes
the whole process less frightening while
simultaneously letting you know what
you are going to feel. You laugh a little
and then wait for the tapping — calmly.
Sense of humor, then, is definitely part
of Tim's appeal, but it isn't really enough
to explain why up to 50 people a day
show up on his doorstep for treatment.
Another reason might be that he knows

what he's doing. He knows anatomy —
the muscular and skeletal systems. He
knows the mechanics of movement, such
as what running, jumping, skiing, bicy
cling and swimming make the body do.
Something else that phrase covers —
he knows what his limitations are. His
ego doesn't get in the way of referrals
when the problem is beyond him, and
when the problem is within his scope, he
deals with it with a degree of profes
sionalism that belies his sense of humor.
Tim mixes the arcane gizmos with lots
of practical exercise advice and less tech-
forms of therapy to ensure that the
injuries heal correctly and that they stay
healthy long after the person has stopped
coming to his department.
So he's funny and he knows what he's
doing. Anything else?
Yeah. He's nice — to everyone. From
the first person who comes through the
door at 9 a.m. to the 50th who stumbles
in at 2:30 p.m., everyone gets Tim's best
effort and a big smile.
Does this all make him a god? Maybe
not, but we only turn to gods when some
thing goes wrong, and I can't think of
anyone I'd turn to faster if one of my
knees, shoulders or elbows went wrong.
