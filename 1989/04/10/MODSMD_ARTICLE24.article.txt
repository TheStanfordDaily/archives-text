The Daily Palo Alto
The annual pajama
"peerade" took place, promis
ing to be "still more festive
than ever before."
This "first fashion show of
the season" was presented by
the freshmen men of Encina
Hall, who began their parade
at "8:30 precisely," dressed in
pqjamas of "every sort and des
cription."
According to The Daily,
"Garbed in various species of
night attire ... 200 Encina
revelers broke loose and cele
brated."
Armed with horns, whistles,
fireworks and nightcaps, the
students caused "pan
demonium" in front of the
Quad library and then pro
ceeded to Roble Hall (then an
all-women's dorm) "where the
fair sex was greeted with much
enthusiasm."

The Stanford Daily
Work was completed on
Sigma Alpha Epsilon's new
eight-foot jacuzzi, which held
"750 gallons of swirling, bub
bling water heated to a pleasant
106 degrees,"
Despite the fact that the
jacuzzi was "being used almost
every day by SAE members,"
some students questioned the
decision to install a water-and
energy-consuming luxury item
in light of the "continuing need
for water and energy conserva
tion."
The SAE members raised
more than $2,700 to pay for
their new spa by working in
warehouses, for concerts and
in the Stanford Alumni Asso
ciation. This money, combined
with another $1,300 from
house savings, was enough to
cover the cost of installation.
