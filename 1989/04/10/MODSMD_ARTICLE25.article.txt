Stanford, which also dropped
Saturday's first game of the series
12-1, fell to 17-20, 5-12 in Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division
play. Arizona State is now 32-10
and 11-4 in the Six-Pac. An ASU
win today would keep the Devils
tied atop the league with Arizona,
which yesterday completed a
three-game sweep of UCLA in
Tucson.
Three times ASU came from
behind yesterday in its last at-bat
to tie the score against Stanford's
ace reliever Steve Chitren (3-2).
Chitren twice had the Devils down
to their last strike but could not
close the door. Cardinal errors
helped account for the tying run
in the 11th and the winning run
in the 13th.
In his 13th season as Stanford's
coach, Mark Marquess would be
hard-pressed to recall a more bit
ter defeat.
"It was tough. We just couldn't
get the last out when we needed
it," Marquess said.
Most disturbing of all was
ASU's three-run rally in the ninth
to erase a 7-4 Cardinal lead.
Anthony Manahan opened the

inning with a double off Chitren
— who entered the game in the
seventh — and scored on Kevin
Higgins' double. After a walk to
Steve Willis, Dan Rumsey lined
out to center to bring up freshman
phenom Mike Kelly.
Kelly, who also homered in the
second, lashed a double to right
center to plate Higgins and Willis
and knot the score at 7-7. An
intentional walk and hit batsman
left Chitren to play Houdini, and
he did, getting a force-out at home
on Tommy Adams' ground ball
and a force-out at second on John
Finn's grounder.
Wasted in this gut-wrenching
loss were shining performances by
several Cardinal players: two
homers by Stanford's Paul Carey
and one each by Brian Johnson
and Troy Paulsen; a two-out, RBI
single by David McCarty to give
Stanford the lead in the 11th, a
one-out, RBI double by David
Holbrook that did the same in the
13th; and Scott Weiss' AVz innings
of two-run, five-hit relief that got
the Cardinal into the seventh with
a 6-4 lead.
Without a doubt, the finest play
in a game chock-full of excitement
was executed by the combined ef
forts of Troy Paulsen — now play
ing left field after a season
and-a-half at shortstop — and
catcher Eric Cox.
With Devil catcher Dave Robson
on second and two out in the
fourth, Manahan singled to left.
Paulsen, charging all the way,
scooped up the ball and threw a
strike to Cox.
Cox somehow kept his concen
tration long enough to corral the
ball before Robson laid him out
flat. Cox held onto the ball, Stan
ford had dodged a bullet and the

score remained tied at 3-3.
The Devils also had their share
of heroes: Kelly knocked in four
runs on a double, homer and
sacrifice fly; Higgins had five hits,
including the game-tying single
with two outs and two strikes in
the 13th; and Manahan had four
hits, two doubles and an RBI that
tied the game with two outs and

two strikes in the 11th.
In a game that featured so
many brilliant performances, it
was finally an error that allowed
the winning run in the 13th. After
Higgins knotted the score 9-9, Rex
McMackin hit a ground ball to
short. Roger Burnett moved to his
left to field the ball and saw it
slip through his legs, bringing
Manahan home from second.
An error also cost Stanford in
the 11th. Paul Carey dropped
Robson's short fly to lead off the
inning. Robson, who reached sec
ond on the error, would score the
tying run on Manahan's clutch
single.
Saturday's contest was reminis
cent of ASU's thrashing of the
Cardinal at Sunken Diamond in
early March, as the Devils crushed
Stanford 12-1.
Stanford starting pitcher Stan
Spencer (2-6) was in total com

mand through four inningß, al
lowing just a leadoff single to
third baseman Finn — who went
0-for-8 in yesterday's marathon
— in the fourth.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal squan
dered scoring opportunities in the
second and fourth innings and
stranded five baserunners
through five.
The best opportunity came in
the fourth, when first baseman
Johnson doubled with one out.
Paulsen drilled an Oscar Rivas (6-
1) offering to right, but Rumsey
was positioned perfectly to record
out number two.
Right fielder Paul Carey then
grounded one sharply to the right
of first baseman Willis. Willis
dove to make the play, scrambled
to his feet and threw to Rivas,
covering to retire Carey by a step.
Then in the bottom of the fifth,
N0.5 hitter Rumsey led things off
against Spencer. Ahead in the
count 0-1, Spencer hung a curve
ball to the left-handed hitting
Rumsey, who launched a towering
homer to right to give the Devils
a 1-0 lead.
Kelly singled, but Spencer
picked him off first. Jim Austin
blooped a double down the right
field line. After Robson grounded
out, the merry-go-round began.
Steve Martin singled to left to
score Austin. Finn singled to
right-center, Martin moving to
third. Anthony Manahan ripped a
double to left for two RBIs. Kevin
Higgins hit a looper to left for
two bases and an RBI. Willis
grounded out to stop the two-out
carnage at five runs on seven hits.
ASU never looked back, tallying
one in the sixth, and three each
in the seventh and eighth to
thump the NCAA's two-time
defending champion.
