# Spikers thrash Tritons, await UCLA

### John Kirks Staff writer 
The Stanford men's volleyball team
polished off the University of San Diego
Tritons on Friday night in a match that
lasted a little over an hour.
The match, which served as a final
calisthenic for the powerful Cardinal
squad before this coming weekend's all
important matches, was never close.
Stanford crushed the visiting Tritons
early and only turned the pressure up
a notch as the match progressed; the
Cardinal won in three, 15-5, 15-3, 15-1.

Stanford Coach Fred Sturm was ap
parently very pleased with the strong
showing turned in by his squad. In a
brief yet enthusiastic post-match meet
ing, Sturm complimented both his
team's strong, crisp play as well as his
second team's impressive outing.
Setter Ryan O'Hara, who checked in
for starting setter Parker Blackman in
the second half of the match, com
mented on the second team's perform
ance.
"Coach was really happy that we won
so big, and that the second team came
in and won even bigger than the first
team had," he said.
Middle blocker Adam Keefe also cap
italized on his playing time. Keefe, who
had been mostly ineffective in three pre
vious matches, was finally able to get

some quality swings.
O'Hara commented on Keefe's play,
"Keefe had been checking in at outside
hitter before this match, but in this one
he went in at middle blocker. He played
that positiorfin high school, and he was
much more comfortable tonight."
If Keefe can get warmed up, he could
contribute to the Cardinal cause as the
team enters the Western Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association's home stretch.
Regardless of the exact personnel that
is on the floor for the next couple of
matches, though, Stanford is going to
be fired up.
Parker Blackman, speaking of his
team's state of readiness, said, "I think
we've stepped up our play for the end
of the season. After the loss to Long
Beach, we knew we would have to per
form well in each of our remaining
games. We know that there is no holding
back anymore.
"If we are going to control our own
destiny, which every team wants to do,
we are in the position of having to win
the rest of our games."
Indeed, the team no longer has any
thing to lose. Stanford has practically
wrapped up an NCAA regional bid,
which would mean it would enter in a
four-team playoff for the last bid in the
NCAA's final four. However, what Stan
ford really would like is an automatic
bid in the final four, an honor bestowed
upon the WTVA champion.
To become champion of the league,
Stanford will probably have to sweep
the mighty Bruins in the upcoming two

match series. But, judging by the
awesome performances turned in re
cently by the squad, such a sweep is
not out of the question.
After destroying UC-San Diego, the
preliminaries are over. It's showtime for
the Cardinal. Senior captain Scott For
tune realizes the stakes that are on the
line in Stanford's upcoming matches,
and, accordingly, he has begun a very
appropriate pre-match ritual.
In the team huddle that precedes each
match's first serve, Fortune now says,
"The NCAAs, boys, this is it."
Card Notes
The regional tournament will be played at
Loyola Marymount'a Gersten Pavilion, the
home of the nation's highest-scoring college
basketball team and the occasional practice
site of the Los Angeles Lakers.
This year's final four will be played at
UCLA's Pauley Pavilion. The last time the
tournament was played at Pauley, in 1987,
the Bruins took their 12th NCAA men's
volleyball title behind the play of outside
hitter Ozzie Volstad.
Dan Hanan continues to make a strong
bid to be the NCAA Player of the Year. He
is still the only player to be ranked in the
national top twenty in all five statistical
categories (kills, blocks, digs, aces and hitting
percentage) and will likely become the na
tional leader in both kills and digs, and
possibly hitting percentage after his perform
ances last week. After hitting .750 Friday,
Hanan has still not hit lower than .304 in
the 17 matches he has played.
