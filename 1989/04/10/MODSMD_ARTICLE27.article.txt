# Women netters are truly road warriors

LOS ANGELES — For the sec
ond weekend in a row, the No.
1-ranked Stanford women's tennis
team went on the road to play
three matches. And, for the sec
ond weekend in a row, they won
all three.
As Yogi Berra once said, "It's
like deja vu all over again."
At least sort of. Lest anyone
think it was easy this time
around, consider the following:
• Tami Whitlinger, the Cardi
nal's No. 1 singles player, has
been suffering with a flu bug that
has given her mayor stomach prob
lems. She almost had to default
in the middle of her match Sat
urday and couldn't play yesterday.
• Freshman Kylie Johnson has
a respiratory problem that makes
it difficult for her to breathe.
• Whitlinger's absence from the
lineup yesterday forced the rest
of Stanford's singles player to
move up a notch. That includes
the aforementioned Johnson,
whose problems were com
pounded yesterday by a nosebleed
that lasted throughout her match.
• Finally, senior captain Cindy
Buchsbaum had to play singles
yesterday despite an aching shoul
der she felt might prevent her
from serving overhand.
So, Stanford stared adversity in

Cardinal defeats
SDSU, USC and UCLA

the face, adversity backed down
and the Cardinal upped its record
to 20-0 (6-0 in Pacific 10 Confer
ence play) with victories over San
Diego State, USC and UCLA.
Saturday's match at USC's
Marks Stadium was by far the
tighest of the weekend. Though
the final score of 6-3 might seem
comfortable, the Cardinal was
forced to play doubles for only
the third time this season and
needed an otherwordly comeback
from Whitlinger over Trisha Laux
to win the meet.
"Tami Whitlinger played the
greatest competitive match I've
seen played since I've been at
Stanford," Coach Frank Brennan
said. "Unequivocally."
"Her winning that match
renews my faith in peace in the
Middle East. I believe we can do
anything," Brennan added.
Whitlinger's task seemed im
possible when the day began. She
was incredibly sick to her stomach
and could not eat before the 9
a.m. contest. But to make matters
worse, her opponent was Laux, a
5-foot-2 wunderkind who is prob
ably the hardest hitter in col
legiate women's tennis.

Last year, Laux accomplished
something few other collegians
have: she actually beat Whitlinger
in one of their two encounters.
Then, at 2-2 in the first set,
Whitlinger realized she probably
didn't have enough energy to
make it through. So what did she
do? She let Laux slug away and
gave it what she could to slug
back. The end result was a gritty
7-5 victory to capture the set.
Laux bounced back to take the
second set by a score of 6-4 and
seemed to be on her way against
the obviously pained WTiitlinger.
Laux pulled out to a 4-1 lead in
the third and was serving with a
40-15 lead.
She took a short ball from Whit
linger and came in behind it.
Whitlinger returned it to Laux's
forehand and the USC star netted
a volley she should have put away
easily. Though Laux held her
serve, that error was a harbinger
of things to come.
First, however, the match al
most ended altogether. Whitlinger
had a notion of calling it a day,
and Brennan had a notion of
throwing in the towel for her.
"I was honestly hoping she
would lose and get off the court,"
Brennan said. "I almost stopped
the match."
Believing the fiercely competi
tive Whitlinger would've
protested mightily had he done

so, Brennan decided to let her go
on and offered some advice: "Use
your head and be smart. Don't
kill yourself. It's not worth it if
you go into the hospital," he said.
Considering how Whitlinger
felt, the hospital might not have
been a bad idea. "I was just
dying," she said. "I was thinking:
This isn't worth it. I can't run
at all.' "
Yet, at the same time, some
thing was tugging her in the op
posite direction. Among those
contradictory thoughts were: "I
really don't want to default; I
really want to try," she said.
The "do-I-give-in-or-not?" bat
tle was probably decided by a
glance at the scoreboard. Whit
linger's sister Teri lost to Anya
Kochoff 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 and Johnson
fell to Caroline Kuhlman 6-3, 6-4.
That meant if Whitlinger lost
the overall score would be 3-3 and
the Cardinal would need to win
two of the three doubles matches,
without the Whitlinger-
Whitlinger team at No. 1, in order
to defeat the Women of Troy.
So, down 5-1, Whitlinger began
her comeback. Knowing full well
she couldn't run, she thought, "I
have to just start whaling. I have
to put as many balls away as I
can," she said, adding that she
was trying to end the points as
