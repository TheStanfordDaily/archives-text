# Men's linkers fifth

### David Hirning Staff writer 
It rained on the world's best
golfers at The Masters tourna
ment in Georgia this weekend,
which was perhaps of some
small comfort to the Stanford
men's golf team.
The Cardinal, not too far
away in Nashville, Tenn., had
to combat bad weather them
selves in finishing fifth in the
Music City Invitational tourna
ment held on Friday and Sat
urday.

It was the kind of tourna
ment that gives a team confi
dence, as Stanford jumped
from eighth to fifth with a 287
in the final round. That score
was not only a considerable im
provement from the 307 and
300 marks of the previous two
rounds, but it was also the
lowest round turned in for the
entire 18-team tournament.
"The improvement was good
to see." Stanford Coach Wally
Goodwin said. "It was also the

first round we've shot under
par while I've been coach here,"
a two year period.
Team leader Christian
Cevaer seems undeserving of
the distinction "freshman," al
though he is exactly that,
academically. But Cevaer, who
came in sixth individually at
this tournament, is a player
with international experience
who has not finished lower
than 18th in any of his college
tournaments.
"He's one of the top two or
three freshmen in the U. 5.,"
Goodwin said. "He's a spectac
ular player, and it's great to
have him out there â€” as a
player, a leader, even in rela
tions with other teams."
Cevaer's scores dropped with
each round, as did those of his
teammates, as the Cardinal
slowly adjusted to the wind and
rain. Cevaer's final round was
a blistering 69, which put him
at 219 for the tournament.
Junior Josh Zander also upped
his level of play for the third
round, and wound up tied for
15th at 223.
Stanford finished with a
team score of 894, only four
teen shots behind the winner.
