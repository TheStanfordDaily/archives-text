LOS ANGELES - When the
Stanford men's tennis team ar
rived in Southern California on
Thursday, it was riding a six
match win streak and hoping to
improve its perfect Pacific 10 Con
ference record.
When the Cardinal players left
town 48 hours later, they did so
riding a two- match losing streak
and shaking their heads over the
weekend's missed opportunities.

Trojans 5, Cardinal 4

The losses at No. 1 UCLA and
No. 10 USC left Stanford with a
9-4 record, 2-2 in the Pac-10
Southern Division. And while the
loss to the Bruins on Friday was
not unexpected (UCLA is now 20-
1), the defeat at the hands of the
Trojans the next day raised ques
tions about the resolve of a Stan
ford team that had to that point
been able to pull close matches
out of the fire.
Friday's match at the Los An
geles Tennis Center, played in
almost-bearable 90-degree heat,
will go in the books as an apparent
Bruin blowout, but the match was
actually much closer than the
score would indicate. Although
UCLA wrapped up the win in
singles, the Cardinal was not only
in a position to get to 2-4 and
send the match to doubles, but
also had a shot at a 3-all split.
Stanford's Martin Blackman
saw his first action in several
weeks against the Bruins, and the
sophomore seemed to have recov
ered quite nicely from chicken
pox, quickly taking the first set
6-3 from Pat Galbraith at No. 3
singles. Unfortunately, Galbraith
got stronger as the match wore
on, and Blackman began to show
signs of rustiness. Galbraith broke
serve to take the second set 6-3,

then poured it on to take the final
stanza 6-2.
Blackman wasn't the only Car
dinal having problems. While Alex
O'Brien was having his head
handed to him 6-1, 6-3 by fellow
freshman Jason Netter at No. 4
("Alex won't play like that again
— will you, Alex?" Stanford Asst.
Coach John Whitlinger kidded
O'Brien afterward), UCLA's
players were busy taking one-set
leads in the other four matches.
The only Stanford player put
ting up much of a fight was Jeff
Cathrall, who got to a first-set
tiebreaker against Buff (yes, it's
his real name) Farrow before fall
ing.
On the adjacent court, Jeff
Tar an go'B woes were continuing
against Brian Garrow. Tarango
broke serve in the match's first
game, but nothing went right for
him afterward. Serving in the
fourth game, Tarango hit an open
volley into the net, giving Garrow
a 3-1 lead in the game, and pro
ceeded to show his disgust by
slamming his racket to the
ground. He was assessed a point
penalty, which gave the game to
Garrow, and aside from the occa
sional outburst ("These are really
great points! Good tennis!" he
yelled after one sloppy exchange),
Tarango wasn't heard from again,
falling 6-2, 6-2.
So, what gave you trouble
today, Jeff?
"Everything,'' Tarango said.
"Nothing didn't give me trouble
today. I was rushing my shots,
nothing seemed to work. ... I'm
still trying to put all the pieces
together."
"I'm not worried about Jeff,"
Stanford Coach Dick Gould said.
"He's had some time off and
everyone's gunning for him. I'm
just trying to get him not to worry
about himself. He's not very far
away from where he should be."
Tarango wasn't so sure. "Right
now I think I'm in the Alps," he
said.
With the score 3-0, the Cardinal

would have to do some major
mountain climbing to get back in
the match. And, for a while, it
looked like the squad would do
so. Cathrall took his second set
6-4 (acing Farrow on set point),
Glenn Solomon came back from
a 6-3 opening set loss to swamp
Bill Behrens 6-1 in the second at
No. 5, and Barry Richards, who
lost the first set 6-3 at No. 6,
rebounded 6-4 in the second.
Solomon slipped at the outset
of the third set, falling behind
3-0, but came roaring back to go
up a break at 4-3. Richards was
likewise in control at 5-3. At that
point, though, both Cardinal
players faltered. Solomon gave
back the break and fell 6-4, and
Richards suddenly found the set
tied at six games each. He recov
ered nicely, taking the tiebreaker
and the match for the Cardinal's
only win on the day, but it turned
out to be less than enough.
Moments after Richards
wrapped up his win, the Cathrall-
Farrow match came to a contro
versial end. Farrow had taken a
5-1 lead in the final set, but
Cathrall then held for 5-2, broke
for 5-3, held for 5-4 and was re
ceiving serve at 3-all in the tenth
game. Farrow served, the ball hit
the net and landed in, and
Cathrall called a let while hitting
the ball off the wall behind Far
row. However, the umpire over
ruled the call, saying he heard
nothing, and awarded the point,
game, set, and match to Farrow.
What exactly the umpire was
thinking is anyone's guess. Fans
75 feet from the court, sitting at
the top of the stands, heard the
ball hit the net. Cathrall
protested, but to no avail. The
match was over.
"It was a let," Gould said. "The
umpire just didn't hear it. It hap
pens."
As for the result of the match,
Gould wasn't ready to press the
panic button. "I'm obviously dis

appointed in the score. .. . but
we're only going to get better,"
he said. "We have to keep it as a
stepping-stone. I'll be interested
in seeing how well we come back
tomorrow."
Tarango and O'Brien, each of
whom has been struggling lately,
came back well — and then some
— the next day at USC's Marks
Stadium. O'Brien jumped out to
a 6-2 first-set win over Donny
Isaak, but was tied with Isaak at
five games each in the second.
After holding serve for 6-5,
O'Brien, who has had trouble put
ting matches away, apparently
decided he wanted to get out of
the heat as fast as possible. Up
1-0, O'Brien took the next three
points on a forehand winner that
kissed the left sideline, a curving

backhand shot that nestled in the
left corner, and a blistering serv
ice return that left Isaak shaking
his head.
"I just decided to go for it,"
O'Brien said. "I haven't been very
aggressive lately.
"My brain was found, too,"
O'Brien said, referring to his
recurring concentration problems.
"I found it at the beach yesterday
after the match."
While O'Brien was recovering
his brain, Tarango was making a
triumphant return from the Alps.
After dropping the first set 6-2
to Byron Black, the Tarango of
old came alive. The backhand
started to click, the forehand be
came potent again, and all of a
sudden Black was being moved all
over the court, chasing Tarango's
precise shots.
Receiving serve up 5-3, Tarango
hit a lunging forehand rocket
down the line and let out a scream

of joy. Two points later the set
was his, as was the match after
his 6-3 win in the third set.
Cathrall had won his first set
6-4, but was slowly taken out of
the match by Greg Failla, who
wound up with the 4-6, 6-4, 6-2
win. Glenn Solomon had the un
fortunate luck of facing Eric
Amend, who usually plays No. 2
for USC but played fifth singles
Saturday because of a slight
shoulder injury. He had no trouble
with Solomon, 6-2, 6-2. Blackman
lost as well, 6-4, 7-6.
Richards, meanwhile, was doing
what he does best, handling Andy
Olypant 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, and the
teams entered the doubles tied at
three matches each.
Stanford seemed to be in com
mand after taking the first set in
all three doubles matchups. How
ever, only Tarango and O'Brien
at No. 1 came through, winning
7-6, 6-1 for their fourth win in

as many matches.
Cathrall and Dan Turbow lost
4-6, 3-6, 1-6 at No. 2, and Black
man and Eric Peus also fell, 3-6,
6-3, 1-6. In the final sets of both
matches, USC's players shouted
encouragement to each other,
seeming to become stronger with
each point won, while the Cardi
nal became more despondent with
each passing game. Volleys that
before would have been put away
easily found the net, and the fire
in the Trojans could not be put
out.
Gould was less than pleased
with the team's performance.
"Our resolve to win left us," he
said. "We did a good job of getting
in a position to win, but if you
don't put it away you don't
deserve to win.
"We stopped being aggressive,"
Gould continued. "When we got
down, I didn't see a spark.
"We got out-fought. It's as
simple as that."
