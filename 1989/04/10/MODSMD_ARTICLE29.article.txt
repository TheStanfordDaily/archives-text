LOS ANGELES - When the
Stanford men's tennis team ar
rived in Southern California on
Thursday, it was riding a six
match win streak and hoping to
improve its perfect Pacific 10 Con
ference record.
When the Cardinal players left
town 48 hours later, they did so
riding a two- match losing streak
and shaking their heads over the
weekend's missed opportunities.

Trojans 5, Cardinal 4

The losses at No. 1 UCLA and
No. 10 USC left Stanford with a
9-4 record, 2-2 in the Pac-10
Southern Division. And while the
loss to the Bruins on Friday was
not unexpected (UCLA is now 20-
1), the defeat at the hands of the
Trojans the next day raised ques
tions about the resolve of a Stan
ford team that had to that point
been able to pull close matches
out of the fire.
Friday's match at the Los An
geles Tennis Center, played in
almost-bearable 90-degree heat,
will go in the books as an apparent
Bruin blowout, but the match was
actually much closer than the
score would indicate. Although
UCLA wrapped up the win in
singles, the Cardinal was not only
in a position to get to 2-4 and
send the match to doubles, but
also had a shot at a 3-all split.
Stanford's Martin Blackman
saw his first action in several
weeks against the Bruins, and the
sophomore seemed to have recov
ered quite nicely from chicken
pox, quickly taking the first set
6-3 from Pat Galbraith at No. 3
singles. Unfortunately, Galbraith
got stronger as the match wore
on, and Blackman began to show
signs of rustiness. Galbraith broke
serve to take the second set 6-3,

then poured it on to take the final
stanza 6-2.
Blackman wasn't the only Car
dinal having problems. While Alex
O'Brien was having his head
handed to him 6-1, 6-3 by fellow
freshman Jason Netter at No. 4
("Alex won't play like that again
— will you, Alex?" Stanford Asst.
Coach John Whitlinger kidded
O'Brien afterward), UCLA's
players were busy taking one-set
leads in the other four matches.
The only Stanford player put
ting up much of a fight was Jeff
Cathrall, who got to a first-set
tiebreaker against Buff (yes, it's
his real name) Farrow before fall
ing.
On the adjacent court, Jeff
Tar an go'B woes were continuing
against Brian Garrow. Tarango
broke serve in the match's first
game, but nothing went right for
him afterward. Serving in the
fourth game, Tarango hit an open
volley into the net, giving Garrow
a 3-1 lead in the game, and pro
ceeded to show his disgust by
slamming his racket to the
ground. He was assessed a point
penalty, which gave the game to
Garrow, and aside from the occa
sional outburst ("These are really
great points! Good tennis!" he
yelled after one sloppy exchange),
Tarango wasn't heard from again,
falling 6-2, 6-2.
So, what gave you trouble
today, Jeff?
"Everything,'' Tarango said.
"Nothing didn't give me trouble
today. I was rushing my shots,
nothing seemed to work. ... I'm
still trying to put all the pieces
together."
"I'm not worried about Jeff,"
Stanford Coach Dick Gould said.
"He's had some time off and
everyone's gunning for him. I'm
just trying to get him not to worry
about himself. He's not very far
away from where he should be."
Tarango wasn't so sure. "Right
now I think I'm in the Alps," he
said.
With the score 3-0, the Cardinal

would have to do some major
mountain climbing to get back in
the match. And, for a while, it
looked like the squad would do
so. Cathrall took his second set
6-4 (acing Farrow on set point),
Glenn Solomon came back from
a 6-3 opening set loss to swamp
Bill Behrens 6-1 in the second at
No. 5, and Barry Richards, who
lost the first set 6-3 at No. 6,
rebounded 6-4 in the second.
Solomon slipped at the outset
of the third set, falling behind
3-0, but came roaring back to go
up a break at 4-3. Richards was
likewise in control at 5-3. At that
point, though, both Cardinal
players faltered. Solomon gave
back the break and fell 6-4, and
Richards suddenly found the set
tied at six games each. He recov
ered nicely, taking the tiebreaker
and the match for the Cardinal's
only win on the day, but it turned
out to be less than enough.
Moments after Richards
wrapped up his win, the Cathrall-
Farrow match came to a contro
versial end. Farrow had taken a
5-1 lead in the final set, but
Cathrall then held for 5-2, broke
for 5-3, held for 5-4 and was re
ceiving serve at 3-all in the tenth
game. Farrow served, the ball hit
the net and landed in, and
Cathrall called a let while hitting
the ball off the wall behind Far
row. However, the umpire over
ruled the call, saying he heard
nothing, and awarded the point,
game, set, and match to Farrow.
What exactly the umpire was
thinking is anyone's guess. Fans
75 feet from the court, sitting at
the top of the stands, heard the
ball hit the net. Cathrall
protested, but to no avail. The
match was over.
"It was a let," Gould said. "The
umpire just didn't hear it. It hap
pens."
As for the result of the match,
Gould wasn't ready to press the
panic button. "I'm obviously dis

both USC and UCLA.
