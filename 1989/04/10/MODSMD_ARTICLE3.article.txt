# Fraternities, sororities gear up for first week of Rush
## 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
It's opening night for Stanford's so
rorities and fraternities.
Continuing a 98-year tradition, Fra
ternity Rush kicks in with parties start
ing at 8 p.m. Likewise, Sorority Rush
is ready to go with a lineup of open
houses starting at 8:30 p.m. all over
campus.
Sixteen fraternities are putting on
Rush this year, with an anticipated 500
to 700 freshmen joining the Rush par
ties for the next three weeks.
Both sororities and fraternities have
made some alterations in the Rush
rules, but most guidelines have not
changed since last year.
Accorded the privilege of a "wet"
Rush, fraternities can serve alcohol to
rushees, unlike Sorority Rush.
This year, parties with alcohol will
have more party monitors than in pre
vious years. "We want to step up our
risk-management in order to reduce our
liability," Interfraternity Council Pres
ident Chris Erlin said.
Previously, eight party monitors were
assigned to maintain safety at the par
ties. This spring, party monitors will
attend every event at all times, accord
ing to IFC Vice President and Rush
Chair Todd Ortega. "We have 32
monitors right now working two-hour
shifts apiece for the first week," he said.
Each fraternity must designate two
monitors to watch parties other than
those sponsored by their own fraternity.

Ortega said these monitors are not al
lowed to recruit rushees at parties other
than their own. He said he foresees no
problems with the new system, and has
"high hopes" for a smooth and strong
Rush.
For sorority rushees, "suicide" this
year is permitted only on the last night.
Suicides are the means by which rus
hees may forfeit their guaranteed bids,
effectively dropping out of Rush if they
do not receive bids from their preferred
sororities.
Following a week of open houses, the
rushees rank their choices from one to
seven during the final night of Rush,
called preference, when rushees attend
only two parties.
Traditionally, a rushee received bids
from one of the seven sororities. Now,
if she does not wish to be in the running
for certain sororities, she may decide
not to write all seven on her preference
card. If one of the noted sororities does
not give her a bid, she will be dropped
from Rush.
The new suicide rule is intended to
help fill smaller sororities. Because
suicides are not allowed until the last
night, the Intersorority Council hopes
to guarantee a full weekend of parties
for every rushee.
Handbook outlines rules
An 80-page Rush handbook was dis
tributed to interested fraternity rushees
at informational meetings last week and
will go out to sorority rushees today.
The book introduces the IFC, ISC and

the Afro-American Fraternal and
Sororal Association (formerly called the
Black Greek Letter System — see
related story) to rushees, with descrip
tions of the various fraternities and so
rorities.
The handbook includes general state
ments from University President Donald
Kennedy and Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Joe Pisano about fraternal life at Stan
ford.
Pisano urges students to "challenge
assumptions about these groups during
Rush.... Stereotypes about fraternities
and sororities are numerous and deeply
entrenched (but) members defy easy
labeling.
"The University recognizes and sup
ports the positive contributions of
fraternal organizations to the quality
of student life," Pisano writes, himself
a former fraternity member.
Since fraternities began in 1825, all
but two U.S. presidents have been fra
ternity members, and 76 percent of all
congressmen are fraternity members,
according to handbook statistics taken
from the book "From Here To Frater
nity."
The total number of registered
sorority rushees at Stanford is 237
women, up 30 from last year. Because
sororities are unhoused, Rush takes
place at various locations on and off
campus.
Erlin said he expects higher numbers
of freshmen to participate in Rush this
year and said he thinks the in
coming group will have "higher
ideals" about their roles in fra
ternities.
"Freshmen this year are going
in with more of an idea of what
they're looking for in a group as
opposed to just looking for a group
they have fun with or some name
they hear is popular," he said.
Sororities guarantee bids
Sorority Rush spans one-and-a
half weeks and works on a
guaranteed bid system. Attending
required open houses, a rushee
meets each sorority twice on two
separate nights for a total of four
nights. After these open houses,
rushees list their rankings for all
seven sororities. Saturday, rus
hees visit four sorority off-campus
parties, and Sunday they attend
three.
Preference, more serious than
the previous parties, occurs on the
last night of Rush. The rushee
will visit only two sororities with
the intention of joining one. "Bid
matching" then occurs if the rus
hee's first-choice sorority wants
her.
If a rushee continues to list all
seven sororities on her preference
card, she will be guaranteed a
place in a sorority, even if it is
not her first choice.
Wet and dry Rush
Open house Fraternity Rush
parties run from 8 p.m. to mid
night during the first and third
weeks of Rush, and open houses
will take place during the day
from 3:30 to 8 p.m. during the
second week.
Thirteen of the 16 fraternities
conduct wet Rush. Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, Sigma Phi Epsilon and
Sigma Alpha Mu fraternities will
hold dry Rush because regulations
of their national chapters do not
allow alcohol at Rush, "They
think it makes them have a better
Rush," Erlin explained.

Four fraternity parties are open
for all Stanford students to attend
every night of Rush. Some fra
ternities invite women to the par
ties as designated "Rush hos
tesses." Smaller invite-only par
ties are held during the weekends
until May 1 bids are extended.
Unlike in Sorority Rush, a male
rushee can choose which houses
he rushes and when. A rushee
may receive more than one bid;
however, he can only accept one
bid.
Cleaning up dirty Rush
Paralleling the IFC, the ISC has
created its own Judiciary Com
mittee, chiefly to enforce "dirty
Rush" rules.
Dirty Rush occurs mostly dur
ing winter quarter before formal
Rush begins. If a sorority member

is caught taking a rushee out to
a meal or a social function, giving
her sorority letters or selectively
inviting her to parties, the ISC
will charge the sorority with a
Rush infraction and will punish
the group.
During Rush, but outside des
ignated party times, the same
rules apply and members may not
even discuss Rush, or promise
bids to any rushee.
Fines for any of these infrac
tions include social probation for
two weeks to two quarters, mon
etary fines or ISC educational
programs.
This year's budget restriction
for Sorority Rush has been set at
a total of $1,100 for all parties.
Fraternity Rush has no budget
restrictions and ranges "between
$2,000 and $8,000," said Erlin.

not give her a bid, she will be dropped
from Rush.
The new suicide rule is intended to
help fill smaller sororities. Because
suicides are not allowed until the last
night, the Intersorority Council hopes
to guarantee a full weekend of parties
for every rushee.
Handbook outlines rules
An 80-page Rush handbook was dis
tributed to interested fraternity rushees
at informational meetings last week and
will go out to sorority rushees today.
The book introduces the IFC, ISC and

the Afro-American Fraternal and
Sororal Association (formerly called the
Black Greek Letter System — see
related story) to rushees, with descrip
tions of the various fraternities and so
rorities.
The handbook includes general state
ments from University President Donald
Kennedy and Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Joe Pisano about fraternal life at Stan
ford.
Pisano urges students to "challenge
assumptions about these groups during
Rush.... Stereotypes about fraternities
and sororities are numerous and deeply
entrenched (but) members defy easy
labeling.
"The University recognizes and sup
ports the positive contributions of
fraternal organizations to the quality
of student life," Pisano writes, himself
a former fraternity member.
Since fraternities began in 1825, all
but two U.S. presidents have been fra
ternity members, and 76 percent of all
congressmen are fraternity members,
according to handbook statistics taken
from the book "From Here To Frater
nity."
The total number of registered
sorority rushees at Stanford is 237
women, up 30 from last year. Because
sororities are unhoused, Rush takes
place at various locations on and off
campus.
Erlin said he expects higher numbers
of freshmen to participate in Rush this
year and said he thinks the in
coming group will have "higher
ideals" about their roles in fra
ternities.
"Freshmen this year are going
in with more of an idea of what
they're looking for in a group as
opposed to just looking for a group
they have fun with or some name
they hear is popular," he said.
Sororities guarantee bids
Sorority Rush spans one-and-a
half weeks and works on a
guaranteed bid system. Attending
required open houses, a rushee
meets each sorority twice on two
separate nights for a total of four
nights. After these open houses,
rushees list their rankings for all
seven sororities. Saturday, rus
hees visit four sorority off-campus
parties, and Sunday they attend
three.
Preference, more serious than
the previous parties, occurs on the
last night of Rush. The rushee
will visit only two sororities with
the intention of joining one. "Bid
matching" then occurs if the rus
hee's first-choice sorority wants
her.
If a rushee continues to list all
seven sororities on her preference
card, she will be guaranteed a
place in a sorority, even if it is
not her first choice.
Wet and dry Rush
Open house Fraternity Rush
parties run from 8 p.m. to mid
night during the first and third
weeks of Rush, and open houses
will take place during the day
from 3:30 to 8 p.m. during the
second week.
Thirteen of the 16 fraternities
conduct wet Rush. Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, Sigma Phi Epsilon and
Sigma Alpha Mu fraternities will
hold dry Rush because regulations
of their national chapters do not
allow alcohol at Rush, "They
think it makes them have a better
Rush," Erlin explained.

Four fraternity parties are open
for all Stanford students to attend
every night of Rush. Some fra
ternities invite women to the par
ties as designated "Rush hos
tesses." Smaller invite-only par
ties are held during the weekends
until May 1 bids are extended.
Unlike in Sorority Rush, a male
rushee can choose which houses
he rushes and when. A rushee
may receive more than one bid;
however, he can only accept one
bid.
Cleaning up dirty Rush
Paralleling the IFC, the ISC has
created its own Judiciary Com
mittee, chiefly to enforce "dirty
Rush" rules.
Dirty Rush occurs mostly dur
ing winter quarter before formal
Rush begins. If a sorority member

is caught taking a rushee out to
a meal or a social function, giving
her sorority letters or selectively
inviting her to parties, the ISC
will charge the sorority with a
Rush infraction and will punish
the group.
During Rush, but outside des
ignated party times, the same
rules apply and members may not
even discuss Rush, or promise
bids to any rushee.
Fines for any of these infrac
tions include social probation for
two weeks to two quarters, mon
etary fines or ISC educational
programs.
This year's budget restriction
for Sorority Rush has been set at
a total of $1,100 for all parties.
Fraternity Rush has no budget
restrictions and ranges "between
$2,000 and $8,000," said Erlin.
It's opening night for Stanford's so
rorities and fraternities.
Continuing a 98-year tradition, Fra
ternity Rush kicks in with parties start
ing at 8 p.m. Likewise, Sorority Rush
is ready to go with a lineup of open
houses starting at 8:30 p.m. all over
campus.
Sixteen fraternities are putting on
Rush this year, with an anticipated 500
to 700 freshmen joining the Rush par
ties for the next three weeks.
Both sororities and fraternities have
made some alterations in the Rush
rules, but most guidelines have not
changed since last year.
Accorded the privilege of a "wet"
Rush, fraternities can serve alcohol to
rushees, unlike Sorority Rush.
This year, parties with alcohol will
have more party monitors than in pre
vious years. "We want to step up our
risk-management in order to reduce our
liability," Interfraternity Council Pres
ident Chris Erlin said.
Previously, eight party monitors were
assigned to maintain safety at the par
ties. This spring, party monitors will
attend every event at all times, accord
ing to IFC Vice President and Rush
Chair Todd Ortega. "We have 32
monitors right now working two-hour
shifts apiece for the first week," he said.
Each fraternity must designate two
monitors to watch parties other than
those sponsored by their own fraternity.

Ortega said these monitors are not al
lowed to recruit rushees at parties other
than their own. He said he foresees no
problems with the new system, and has
"high hopes" for a smooth and strong
Rush.
For sorority rushees, "suicide" this
year is permitted only on the last night.
Suicides are the means by which rus
hees may forfeit their guaranteed bids,
effectively dropping out of Rush if they
do not receive bids from their preferred
sororities.
Following a week of open houses, the
rushees rank their choices from one to
seven during the final night of Rush,
called preference, when rushees attend
only two parties.
Traditionally, a rushee received bids
from one of the seven sororities. Now,
if she does not wish to be in the running
for certain sororities, she may decide
not to write all seven on her preference
card. If one of the noted sororities does
not give her a bid, she will be dropped
from Rush.
The new suicide rule is intended to
help fill smaller sororities. Because
suicides are not allowed until the last
