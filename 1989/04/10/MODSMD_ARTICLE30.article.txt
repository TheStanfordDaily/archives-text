# New talent makes tracks at Texas

### Ed Pike Staff writer 
The Stanford Track and Field
team showed several new stars at
the Texas Relays Friday and Sat
urday, led by Peggy Odita's new
school record in the heptathalon.

Odita made a tremendous im
provement and set the second
school record of this young season
in the women's heptathalon (the
first was in the 100 meter dash).
"It really went well. I was happy
with (the record)", Odita said.
The heptathalon requires the
versatility to compete in seven dif
ferent running and field events
from the hurdles to the shotput.
Odita scored 5440 points compet
ing before the main competition
on Wednesday and Thursday, add
ing about 50 points to Denise Gaz
tambide's 1986 school record and
qualifying for the NCAA Cham
pionships.
Odita placed third in the open
heptathalon against strong com
petition."lt was very competitive.
There were Olympians there at
Texas," she said.
Freshman Chrystie Gaines, an
other record-breaker, just missed
her 100-meter school record of
11.56 seconds. Gaines, competing
in front of a home town crowd,
was fourth in 11.57.
Gaines has already lowered the

women's freshman and school
record three times this year, from
12.2 to 12.12, 11.74, and 11.56
at the Fresno Relays last weekend.
The original mark had belonged
to Pam Donaldson and Lynnae
Warren since the early 1980s.
Senior Patty Purpur, Stanford's
perennial Ail-American, worked
out a new throwing technique to
add a foot to her lifetime best in
the shotput, with other big gains
possible in the future.
"I threw to the 55-foot line in
warm-ups", Purpur said after of
ficially hitting 52-foot-ll 3/4 at
Texas.
"It came down to using my legs
and changing my timing to speed
up at the end", she said. "The
coaches have been telling me for
three years. It took some drills to
figure it out."
Purpur ha 3 also been trying this
new technique in the discus,
where she placed third last week
end at 172-foot-11. Purpur hit a
plateau her freshman year, and
this could mean some big gains.
"I think it is going to make a big
difference," she said.
The men also had two new
lifetime bests from sophomore
John Hopkins and junior Marcus
Hickerson. Hopkins is trying to
fill the shoes of Brian Marshall
in the men's high jump.
Saturday Hopkins raised his

personal best to 7-foot-1 1/4. Hop
kins is just the third Stanford
athlete to break the seven-foot
mark.
In the men's long jump, Hick
erson broke the 25-foot mark for
the first time. Hickerson is just
half a foot away from qualifying
for the NCAA Championship
meet.
The Cardinal is fighting two
battles — one on the track and
one in the training room. The out
come of Stanford's first real test
this season, the Stanford-
California dual meet at home
April 29th, may depend as much
on the size of the injured reserve
as the performance of its athletes.
"As far as a team goal, it's
beating Cal," Purpur said. "This
is possible for both the men and
the women, but we need everyone
healthy."
The women are also counting
heavily on junior Carol Gray. Gray
won the 10,000 meters at the
Pacific-10 Conference Champion
ships last year, and also qualified
for the Olympic Trials. After
several weeks recovering from a
stress fracture, she recently re
turned to the track.
Stanford will take on
Sacramento State, Cal State-
Hayward and San Francisco State
next Saturday in the Stanford
Classic at Stanford Stadium.
