# Renaming the Black Greek system
## 
### DJ Berinstein Senior staff writer 
In an effort to distinguish itself from
the Interfraternity and Intersorority
Councils, the Black Greek Letter System
has changed its name to the Afro-
American Fraternal and Sororal System.
"The Black Greek Letter System title
was really a contradiction of terms," said
Kim Coleman, president of the new sys
tem. "There are no black Greeks, and
our system was not founded on the same
ideals as the other Greek system."
Black fraternities and sororities were
chartered in the United States under
different ideals than the white Greek
system, Coleman said. Black fraternities
and sororities were chartered for com
munity service, support of community
members, sisterhood and brotherhood,
knowledge of black history and commu
nity activism, according to Coleman.
The black system was included in this
year's Rush handbook, but Coleman said
the group wanted to have its own sep
arate Rushbook. She said Fraternal Af
fairs Adviser Joe Pisano would not give
them the money. Coleman stated the
reason for the break at this time is
especially important "since Rush is the
time when the other groups get into a
lot of trouble."

The black fraternal
system's Rush is not
an advertised event.
Alcohol is not allowed
before, during or after
the selection process.

The black system's "Rush" is entirely
different from IFC/ISC Rush: It takes
place during fall, winter or spring quar
ter — depending on the fraternity or
sorority — and has a different selection
process. Interested students become
members after completing an applica
tion, undergoing an interview and meet
ing standards for entry as well as a
grade point prerequisite.
The black system's Rush is not an
advertised event, and unlike IFC events,
alcohol is not allowed before, during or
after the selection process.
"Our goals are not the same at all,"
said Coleman. "The two groups are not
the same thing at all."
