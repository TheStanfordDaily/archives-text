## Mr. X comments on the end of his Cold War world 
### Susan McKean Editorial staff 
A dignified and gentle silver
haired maverick of idealism sits
in a heavily curtained room in
the Stanford Faculty Club and
reflects on his powerful career.
Throughout the interview, some
thing he rarely grants, his care
fully chosen words administer
both scathing criticism and gen
erous tribute to powerful people
and powerful states alike.
To a great extent, this diplo
matic statesman has written the
script of international politics of
the 20th century.
But for the last act, he is now
sitting back to watch the unfold
ing of the plot, the reconciliation
of his two leading antagonists —
the United States and the Soviet
Union — and the surprise twists
of new actors and new problems.
George Kennan is confounding.
He is a relic of the era when men
in Washington decided the fates
of people around the world. He
comes from the ranks of
policymakers who set out to make
America indomitable, who
believed the United States could
do no wrong.
But he is also a critical peacenik
who seriously advocates bold pol

reality there ever was,
now the Cold War as
anything more than
images and old
treaties is really over.'

idea of change that rarely find
more political favor in Washing
ton than laughs.
His specialty is the Soviet Un
ion and Eastern Europe, and
through prolific writing — includ
ing more than 20 books — Kennan
has defined the Soviet character,
the Soviet outlook for the Amer
ican government and the Ameri
can people for the past 60 years.
He has both shaped and ob
served history — as a writer, as
a member of the first American
delegation to the Soviet Union in
1933-34, as minister-counselor to
the Soviet Union in 1944, as Am
bassador to the Soviet Union in
1952 and later Ambassador to
Yugoslavia under Tito. He is
credited with the formulation of
America's policy of containing So

viet forays around the world after
World War 11.
Now as a professor emeritus at
Princeton University, Kennan is
an outsider in the decision
making arena, but not in the
locker room of ideas and commen
tary.
He was an architect of the Cold
War who is now calling for its
abandonment, a diplomat from
the days of nuclear diplomacy who
now views nuclear weapons as
"useless devices," a venerable
statesman who calls for complete
disarmament and global coopera
tion to preserve the environment.
He looks back and would do it
again. Only next time, perhaps,
he would savor and stretch out
his education. "I would have tried
to get a wider education before
specializing on Russian. I would
have learned more about classical
civilizations, more Latin, more
Greek, more about art. I would
have been better armed," he said.
And if Russia hadn't so well
suited his disposition, he said he
would have studied Latin
America.
