# A 						man of worth among nations
## Mr. X comments on the end of his Cold War world 
### Susan McKean Editorial staff 
A dignified and gentle silver
haired maverick of idealism sits
in a heavily curtained room in
the Stanford Faculty Club and
reflects on his powerful career.
Throughout the interview, some
thing he rarely grants, his care
fully chosen words administer
both scathing criticism and gen
erous tribute to powerful people
and powerful states alike.
To a great extent, this diplo
matic statesman has written the
script of international politics of
the 20th century.
But for the last act, he is now
sitting back to watch the unfold
ing of the plot, the reconciliation
of his two leading antagonists —
the United States and the Soviet
Union — and the surprise twists
of new actors and new problems.
George Kennan is confounding.
He is a relic of the era when men
in Washington decided the fates
of people around the world. He
comes from the ranks of
policymakers who set out to make
America indomitable, who
believed the United States could
do no wrong.
But he is also a critical peacenik
who seriously advocates bold pol

'Whatever Cold War
reality there ever was,
now the Cold War as
anything more than
images and old
treaties is really over.'

idea of change that rarely find
more political favor in Washing
ton than laughs.
His specialty is the Soviet Un
ion and Eastern Europe, and
through prolific writing — includ
ing more than 20 books — Kennan
has defined the Soviet character,
the Soviet outlook for the Amer
ican government and the Ameri
can people for the past 60 years.
He has both shaped and ob
served history — as a writer, as
a member of the first American
delegation to the Soviet Union in
1933-34, as minister-counselor to
the Soviet Union in 1944, as Am
bassador to the Soviet Union in
1952 and later Ambassador to
Yugoslavia under Tito. He is
credited with the formulation of
America's policy of containing So

viet forays around the world after
World War 11.
Now as a professor emeritus at
Princeton University, Kennan is
an outsider in the decision
making arena, but not in the
locker room of ideas and commen
tary.
He was an architect of the Cold
War who is now calling for its
abandonment, a diplomat from
the days of nuclear diplomacy who
now views nuclear weapons as
"useless devices," a venerable
statesman who calls for complete
disarmament and global coopera
tion to preserve the environment.
He looks back and would do it
again. Only next time, perhaps,
he would savor and stretch out
his education. "I would have tried
to get a wider education before
specializing on Russian. I would
have learned more about classical
civilizations, more Latin, more
Greek, more about art. I would
have been better armed," he said.
And if Russia hadn't so well
suited his disposition, he said he
would have studied Latin
America.
Something 'terribly interesting'
Kennan visited Hoover Library

George Kennan, the architect of the U.S. policy of containment toward
the Soviet Union, now calls for complete disarmament and global
cooperation.
in 1956, and in his journal entry
from that trip, reprinted in this
month's Atlantic, he bitingly
describes California as epicurean,
apathetic and shortsighted, where
"people spend a good deal of time
congratulating one another about
the fact that they are there; dis
content would be unthinkable; and
the newcomer is slightly discon
certed to realize that now, the
devil having been banished and
virtue being triumphant, nothing
terribly interesting is ever going
to happen again."
A few decades ago he may have
predicted a similar stagnation for
the Soviet Union, when Stalin or
Brezhnev paraded before the So
viet people the triumph of com
munism over the West's devils.
But now, Kennan, along with
the rest of the world, is witnessing
changes in the Soviet Union that
he does find terribly interesting
and to which he imparts great
significance.
A huge fan of Soviet leader Mik
hail Gorbachev, Kennan says he
does not believe that Gorbachev's
reforms and "new thinking" are
in any way a response to outside
pressures, and predicts they will
last and expand.
In an interview with The Daily
in March, Kennan said, "These

reforms would have come at this
time quite independently of any
thing the outside world did.
"I think what Gorbachev has
done has deep internal reasons. I
do not see them as a response to
our rearmament."
His position significantly varies
from his stance in his influential
1947 article, "Sources of Soviet
Conduct," in which he articulated
and justified the American con
tainment policy after World War
11.
Kennan has dramatically
shifted his views from those he
expressed in that article, written
under the pseudonym 'X' and
which he claims was misconstrued
from the start. In it he outlined
America's need and ability to "in
fluence by its actions the internal
developments, both within Russia
and throughout the international
Communist movement, by which
Russian policy is largely deter
mined."
Many Soviet analysts take up
that point and argue that the
arms race and the extensive
Reagan era rearmament pushed
the Soviet Union into the
liberalizing frenzy that has
dominated that country's policies
under Gorbachev's leadership
since 1985.

Kennan is a huge fan
of Mikhail Gorbachev,
the Soviet leader. He
does not believe that
Gorbachev's reforms
and 'new thinking' are
in any way a response
to outside pressures,
and predicts they will
last and expand.

Melting the Cold War
Kennan credits Gorbachev with
making obsolete the Cold War
ideology of paranoid exaggeration
and military diplomacy, and calls
on the United States to recognize
the end of a worn-out policy.
In a speech at the Hoover In
stitution in March, Kennan said,
"To do anything, we must free
ourselves from the Cold War men
tality, which is the impression
that we have before us a great
military enemy who is little dif
ferent from the Nazis .. . and is
dedicated to the (military)
destruction of all we cherish.
"Whatever Cold War reality

there ever was, now the Cold War
as anything more than images and
old treaties is really over."
Kennan foresees a transformed
global power arrangement in the
future, no longer divided aiong
East-West lines. He told The Daily
that he views this split as an "ab
normal and temporary conse
quence of the Second World War"
that is now disappearing.
His personal experience com
pared to the experiences of Amer
ican students of the Soviet Union
today reflects the trend away from
the Cold War, Iron Curtain era.
For although he read about, ob
served and analyzed Soviets, in
all his years of portraying them
to the West, he never knew any
Soviet people personally. And he
envies current Soviet scholars for
the interaction that has now be
come almost commonplace be
tween the two peoples.
Mis-containment policy
Although he accords some suc
cess to his policy of containment,
in retrospect he scorns the con
duct of it, finding fault with the
overemphasis on the Soviet mili
tary threat and the disregard for
making America a model worth
following.


Chris Eisenberg — Dally
In an Interview with The Daily, George Kennan discusses the
abandonment of his once-influential containment policy toward the
Soviet Union. Kennan Is currently a professor emeritus at Princeton
University.
It succeeded in that "commu
nism never did succeed in doing
any great damage to our civiliza
tion, he told The Daily.
But had things gone as he
would have liked them to, the
United States "would not have so
strongly emphasized the military
threat, would have devoted our
selves more intensively to the po
litical relationship and above all
to the improvement of our own
society. We would have tried to
make ourselves a better example
for others."
Kennan said he believes the So
viet Union posed a serious threat
to the West or to democratic gov
ernment only in the two or three
years immediately after World
War 11, when Europe was "a shat
tered continent and was very vul
nerable to the sort of political
propaganda and agitation that
came from the communist side.
"I don't think that Russia has
ever constituted a very serious
military threat to us, because I
don't think that the Soviet leaders
have ever thought it to their ad
vantage to launch another world
war."
The misinterpretation of the
Soviets' arms and actions in the
Korean War was what initially led
the implementation of his contain
ment policy astray, Kennan said.
"Some of us argued against this
(misinterpretation) and tried to
prevent it. But we couldn't do it.
"The outbreak of hostilities in
Korea was interpreted as the first
part of a great Moscow effort to
overrun the entire world militarily
— that was not the case.
"This exaggeration had a great
deal to do with our tremendous
preoccupation with military com
petition since that time."
And the result of this ill
founded military race, the huge

stockpiles of nuclear weapons pos
sessed by each side are equally
untenable, according to Ken nan.
In his speech at Hoover, Ken
nan advocated a four-step route
to total nuclear disarmament, in
cluding agreeing to a comprehen
sive test ban and a massive with
drawal of U.S. forces in Europe.
He said nothing should waylay the
process, not entrenched distrust
or differences in the conduct of
internal policies.

1 don't think that Rus
sia has ever con
stituted a very
serious military threat
to us, because I don't
think that the Soviet
leaders have ever
thought it to their ad
vantage to launch an
other world war.'

"Human rights shouldn't take
precedence over arms control.
Arms control is far more impor
tant," he said.
Communism and capitalism
Kennan, whom The New York
Times in February called
America's leading Sovietologist,
told The Daily that'there is no
question that the Soviet Union
will adopt new economic practices,
with a much greater role left for
individual initiative and market
forces.
"Russia is not ready for the free
enterprise system that we have in
this country, and I'm not sure
that an attempt to imitate our
institutions would be best for
Russia.
"They need a much greater in
fusion of private enterprise ...

but (their reformed economy) will
all have to look quite different
from our life here. It will certainly
have to embrace a much higher
component of individual initiative
and enterprise, and Gorbachev has
said he believes in that."
Prophet for preservation
When Kennan starts talking
about the global environmental
crisis, some might say he waxes
eloquent, some might say unrea
sonable. But Kennan is not afraid
of overstating an important cause,
one others might find far-fetched,
and setting his goals high.
Speaking at Hoover, he said he
envisions a "tremendous effort of
international, multilateral dimen
sions" devoted to preserving the
environment. "It should be in the
hands of institutions, not govern
ments, for the preliminary intel
lectual and analytical develop
ments. The implementation
sliould involve governments to the
hilt. ...
"Dreams are often tinged with
a prophetic element; let's hope
this will, too."
From police to leaders
As for America's future in con
trast to the preceding half
century, he told The Daily he
foresees a turn inward, with
greater self-control and concern
for the country's internal welfare,
and more responsible global lead

ership, no longer determined by
Cold War considerations.
"America's international policy
will be different because it will
not be dominated by the East-
West conflict; it will be less am
bitious than it has been in our
direct relations with the Third
World.
"On the other hand, I hope we
will concentrate much more heav
ily on taking leadership in the
environmental problem and help
to save the planet from its grave
dangers."
One sentence in his 'X' article
to which Kennan may still adhere
takes on new meaning now, as
both America and the Soviet Un
ion move into new eras.
"The issue of Soviet-American
relations is« in essence a test of
the overall worth of the United
States as a nation among na
tions," he wrote in 1947.
With his well-practiced eyes
glued to both his homes — the
East and the West — Kennan con
tinues to expect America to show
him her worth, long after he has
shown his to her.
