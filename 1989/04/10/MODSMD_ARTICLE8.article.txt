Penn students earn BAs on jog
As the dawn rose last month on a Friday
morning, the moon gradually sunk under
the Philadelphia horizon.
However, in the University of Pennsylva
nia Quadrangle, at approximately 7 a.m.,
there were seven moons left over.
Yes, moons. Naked butts. Buns. And the
frontal stuff too.
To sum up, in the words of an unidentified
housekeeper, there were seven young men
of Pennsylvania running "buck naked
through the Quad.
Despite the near-freezing temperatures,
seven underclassmen risked their pride, rep
utation — and private parts — for the first
of what they hope will become a traditional
nude lap around the Quad.
"We just kind of did it," according to
Kevin, a Pennsylvania junior and event par
ticipant.
But more than merely a visual spectacle,
the lap was sprinkled with shouts urging
more clothed and somnolent classmates to
wake up.

"I'm naked and I'm in the Quad," one of
the streakers shouted.

Harvard tuition up 6.5 percent
For Harvard University, the difference be
tween $109 million and $116 million might
seem an insignificant figure. After all, the
University has an endowment of more than
$4.2 billion.
But that $7 million increase in Harvard's
revenue for next year will come with a direct
cost to students' pocketbooks — an $1185
rise in tuition for each Harvard undergrad
uate.
Undergraduate fees for tuition, room and
board and health charges will rise to $19,395
for the 1989-90 school year, a 6.5 percent
increase over this year's $18,210 price tag.
Dean of the Faculty A. Michael Spence
attributed the increased tuition bill to the
high cost of maintaining competitive faculty
salaries and the necessity of upgrading Har
vard's physical facilities.

Dining hall rats not up to code
The University of Pennsylvania's StoufTer
Dining Commons failed a city health inspec
tion for the second straight year last month
when officials from the Environmental
Protection Division found violations of a
"crucial nature."
But Philadelphia Sanitarian Jerry Zager,
who conducted the inspection, said yesterday
that the health department cannot release
details of the violations until after a 30-day
waiting period.
According to Zager, the University has
three weeks to resolve the violations before
the health department conducts a follow-up
inspection. If StoufTer again fails the inspec
tion, the Environmental Protection Division
will initiate court proceedings to close the
dining commons. StoufTer failed last year's
initial inspection as well, Zager added.
Numerous student workers said that the
dining commons is infested with rats and
cockroaches, while others alleged that
Dining Services has been negligent in res
ponding to health problems at StoufTer.
