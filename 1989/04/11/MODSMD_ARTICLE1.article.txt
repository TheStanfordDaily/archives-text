SACRAMENTO Crowding outside the steps of
the California State Capitol, more than 200 Stanford
students yesterday joined an estimated 2,500 stu
dents, parents and teachers from all over the state
to rally for a stronger legislative commitment to
educational rights.
Lobbying for a two-thirds vote in the state As
sembly, student coalitions rallied for Bill A81422,
which would establish a statewide oversight office
for students of color.
"We can't be slow anymore. We have to be fast
and grab that golden ring of education, the golden
ring of the golden state which is our right," said
Assemblywoman Teresa Hughes, D-South Central
Los Angeles. Hughes is the chief advocator of the
bill.
During the 25-hour rally, prominent speakers,
including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, criticized President
Bush, Gov. George Deukmejian and the California
Legislature for not responding to the educational
needs of students of color. Deukmejian has proposed
a 10 percent increase in University of California
and state university fees.
Rousing the student crowd, Jackson said, "Power
is not in the Governor's Office not in the White
House. It is in the marching feet of students. Don't
just learn how to read and write. Learn how to be
better people," Jackson said.
Bringing the large group to enthusiastic chants,
Jackson declared, "Tins is America. We are bigger
than one language, bigger than one race, bigger

Capitol and joined efforts in their
fight for the bill.
Stanford junior David Brown,
a member of the Council of Presi

helps us all. California and this
nation depends on making educa

our vision for improvement in
law."
"It is the students of color net
works that are able to bring to
gether a broad coalition of
students, parents and teachers to
make positive changes for educa
tion," he said.
Speaking for MEChA, Christo
pher Melenudo, a student from
DeAnza College said, "We have
shown we can assemble to show
our support and back up what we
claim in order to strive for a better
California for all. With our efforts,
we can redefine education in Cal

Yumi Yuge from San Francisco
State University spoke on behalf
of the Asian student group saying
that students "will no longer
stand for an educational system
that does not serve our histories
and our people on the basis of
equality and respect."

of people and enthusiasm of the
students from all over the state,"
said Medina, a member of
MEChA.
Stanford freshman Noel Bravo,
also from MEChA, said, "This ac

legislators, but it also gave a lot
of students a new respect for ed
ucational issues on the state level
as well as an appreciation for ed
ucational issues at Stanford."
COP member Stacey Leyton,
who also attended the rally, said
"You can expect everyone in the
capitol was talking about what
was going on. The legislators can
see how strong the student move
ment in California is and therefore
know that they can no longer ig
nore us as a force." .
