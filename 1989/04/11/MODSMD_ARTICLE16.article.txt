IJCMI report contains
flaws, but is positive
step in a long process

BETTER LATE THAN
never: The final report of
the University Committee
on Minority Issues is here.
The committee's final product
is an impressive testimony to its
long process of interviews, sur
veys and data compilation. How
ever, the two years that have
elapsed since the UCMI report
was commissioned attests to the
inefficiency of the University's
committee system in getting
things done.
Unfortunately, the report
recommends the formation of at
least seven new committees
which will have the job of
prioritizing and executing the
report's recommendations. Some
of these, such as a standing Com
mittee on the Status of Multira
cial Affairs, which would replace
the UCMI, are surely necessary,
but others could be consolidated.
In addition, the University ad
ministration has formed an in
terim task force to review the
recommendations and organize
their implementation. Why the
University did not immediately
form the standing committee is
difficult to see.

A major flaw in the report is
that the UCMI failed to prioritize
its recommendations. While the
committee may not have wanted
to stress one area over another,
the task of deciding what to do
first may slow down the process
a good deal.
The other difficult task and
the excuse most likely to be given
for future University delays
will be finding the funds to im
plement the proposals. The Uni
versity must make funding to
carry out the UCMI recommen
dations a top priority, and realize
that the committee advocates
spending more on areas where
more money isn't really needed.
Furthermore, the broad term
"minority issues" might have led
some to expect that the commit
tee would deal with minority
groups other than Asian-Amer
icans, blacks, Hispanics and Na
tive Americans, especially since
Jewish and gay, lesbian and
bisexual students were somewhat
involved in the Rainbow Agenda
and participated in the spring
1987 sit-in. The University
should not completely ignore the
needs of other groups, including
women, who are a minority at
Stanford.
The committee addressed six
areas undergraduate curricu
lum, faculty, undergraduate stu
dents, graduate students, student
life and staff. A brief rundown:

Undergraduate curriculum:
The committee's recommenda
tion that would most immedi
ately affect undergraduates' lives
would be the addition of a ninth
University distribution require
ment in "the study of U.S. ethnic
and racial minorities." While it
is important to push students
toward ethnic studies courses,
yet another distribution require
ment would put too great a strain
on the schedules of engineers and
premeds.
A better solution would be to
institute a flexible requirement
similar to the current non-
Western requirement, so that stu
dents could satisfy it with a
course that also counted for their

major or for a distribution re
quirement.
In addition, the committee adv
ocates doubling the number of
courses dealing with American
minorities by 1991-92. However,
attention should also be paid to
better publicizing the courses, a
task taken on this year by the
ASSU.
Faculty: Faculty members are
especially important in building
a multicultural University com
munity because of their roles as
mentors. The committee recom
mends the creation of at least 30
new billets primarily for minority
faculty in the next 10 years.
These billets would be in ad
dition to the regular hirings made
by the departments, and three
new minority faculty members
each year is a reasonable and
feasible goal.
Undergraduate students
recruitment, admissions, finan
cial aid and retention: These
areas came in for very little
criticism; most of the recommen
dations would polish programs
that are doing well already.
Consequently, the recommen
dation to increase staffing and
funding in Undergraduate Ad
missions seems excessive given
the University's budget crunch.
To increase retention of minor
ity students, the committee
recommends exit interviews for
all students who stop out to track
trends. While the intention is a
good one, a more efficient way
to accomplish this would be to
have students fill out a simple
form before stopping out.
Graduate students: recruit
ment, admissions, retention and
graduation: Some of the worst
statistics were found in this area.
Notably, Stanford enrolls 30 per
cent fewer minority graduate stu
dents now than in 1973.
The committee calls on the
University to publicly commit to
the goal of doubling minority en
rollment and graduation rates.
That this is one of the very few
sections where the committee ap
pealed directly to University
President Donald Kennedy indi
cates the seriousness of the prob
lem. Kennedy should heed the
call.

Student life: The committee
extensively criticized the Dean of
Student Affairs Office, citing lack
of support for the four ethnic
community centers, and the dif
ficulty experienced by minority
staff members who were not
being promoted to full-time po
sitions or involved in the deci
sion-making process.
The committee's recommenda
tion that Student Affairs ade
quately fund and staff each eth
nic community center should be
implemented with all haste, in
order to take the administrative
load off already academically
burdened students.
In addition, the committee
called current Residential Educa
tion programming on multicul
tural issues "admirable but
sporadic," and recommended
devoting a full-time director for
an "experiment in multicultural
understanding." Since the dorms
are the best places to reach stu
dents, this idea merits funding.
Staff: Some of the most serious
"institutional racism" occurs in
this area one that is not readily
visible to students. Progress in
developing a pluralistic staff has
varied widely across the Univer
sity; the committee wisely recom
mends forming a review board to
coordinate efforts and review
progress.

life and staff. A brief rundown:

Undergraduate curriculum:
The committee's recommenda
tion that would most immedi
ately affect undergraduates' lives
would be the addition of a ninth
University distribution require
ment in "the study of U.S. ethnic
and racial minorities." While it
is important to push students
toward ethnic studies courses,
yet another distribution require
ment would put too great a strain
on the schedules of engineers and
premeds.
A better solution would be to
institute a flexible requirement
similar to the current non-
Western requirement, so that stu
dents could satisfy it with a
course that also counted for their

major or for a distribution re
quirement.
In addition, the committee adv
ocates doubling the number of
courses dealing with American
minorities by 1991-92. However,
attention should also be paid to
better publicizing the courses, a
task taken on this year by the
ASSU.
Faculty: Faculty members are
especially important in building
a multicultural University com
munity because of their roles as
mentors. The committee recom
mends the creation of at least 30
new billets primarily for minority
faculty in the next 10 years.
These billets would be in ad
dition to the regular hirings made
by the departments, and three
new minority faculty members
each year is a reasonable and
feasible goal.
Undergraduate students
recruitment, admissions, finan
cial aid and retention: These
areas came in for very little
criticism; most of the recommen
dations would polish programs
that are doing well already.
Consequently, the recommen
dation to increase staffing and
funding in Undergraduate Ad
missions seems excessive given
the University's budget crunch.
To increase retention of minor
ity students, the committee
recommends exit interviews for
all students who stop out to track
trends. While the intention is a
good one, a more efficient way
to accomplish this would be to
have students fill out a simple
form before stopping out.
Graduate students: recruit
ment, admissions, retention and
graduation: Some of the worst
statistics were found in this area.
Notably, Stanford enrolls 30 per
cent fewer minority graduate stu
dents now than in 1973.
The committee calls on the
University to publicly commit to
the goal of doubling minority en
rollment and graduation rates.
That this is one of the very few
sections where the committee ap
pealed directly to University
President Donald Kennedy indi
cates the seriousness of the prob
lem. Kennedy should heed the
call.

Student life: The committee
extensively criticized the Dean of
Student Affairs Office, citing lack
of support for the four ethnic
community centers, and the dif
ficulty experienced by minority
staff members who were not
being promoted to full-time po
sitions or involved in the deci
sion-making process.
The committee's recommenda
tion that Student Affairs ade
quately fund and staff each eth
nic community center should be
implemented with all haste, in
order to take the administrative
load off already academically
burdened students.
In addition, the committee
called current Residential Educa
tion programming on multicul
tural issues "admirable but
sporadic," and recommended
devoting a full-time director for
an "experiment in multicultural
understanding." Since the dorms
are the best places to reach stu
dents, this idea merits funding.
Staff: Some of the most serious
"institutional racism" occurs in
this area one that is not readily
visible to students. Progress in
developing a pluralistic staff has
varied widely across the Univer
sity; the committee wisely recom
mends forming a review board to
coordinate efforts and review
progress.
IJCMI report contains
flaws, but is positive
step in a long process

BETTER LATE THAN
never: The final report of
the University Committee
on Minority Issues is here.
The committee's final product
is an impressive testimony to its
long process of interviews, sur
veys and data compilation. How
ever, the two years that have
elapsed since the UCMI report
was commissioned attests to the
inefficiency of the University's
committee system in getting
things done.
Unfortunately, the report
recommends the formation of at
least seven new committees
which will have the job of
prioritizing and executing the
report's recommendations. Some
of these, such as a standing Com
mittee on the Status of Multira
cial Affairs, which would replace
the UCMI, are surely necessary,
but others could be consolidated.
In addition, the University ad
ministration has formed an in
terim task force to review the
recommendations and organize
their implementation. Why the
University did not immediately
form the standing committee is
difficult to see.

A major flaw in the report is
that the UCMI failed to prioritize
its recommendations. While the
committee may not have wanted
to stress one area over another,
the task of deciding what to do
first may slow down the process
a good deal.
The other difficult task and
the excuse most likely to be given
for future University delays
will be finding the funds to im
plement the proposals. The Uni
versity must make funding to
carry out the UCMI recommen
dations a top priority, and realize
that the committee advocates
spending more on areas where
more money isn't really needed.
Furthermore, the broad term
"minority issues" might have led
some to expect that the commit
tee would deal with minority
groups other than Asian-Amer
icans, blacks, Hispanics and Na
tive Americans, especially since
Jewish and gay, lesbian and
bisexual students were somewhat
involved in the Rainbow Agenda
and participated in the spring
1987 sit-in. The University
should not completely ignore the
needs of other groups, including
women, who are a minority at
Stanford.
The committee addressed six
areas undergraduate curricu
lum, faculty, undergraduate stu
dents, graduate students, student
life and staff. A brief rundown:
