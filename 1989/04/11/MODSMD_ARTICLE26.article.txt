WF WW In recent years, the
comic book industry has undergone a dras
tic revolution. Once directed almost exclu
sively towards children, today's comics are
written primarily for the adult audience. In
1979, 95 percent of comics were written
for children; today, only 25 percent of the
industry is oriented towards this age group.
Like any major industry shift, the evolution
of comic books has largely been a response
to market competition. Ten years ago, comic
books didn't have to compete with other
forms of children's entertainment. With the
advent of video games and take-home
movies, however, the comic book industry's
traditional audience began to drift.
Not only did alternative forms of enter
tainment vie for children's attention, but,
even worse, they began to stigmatize faithful
comic books readers. All of a sudden, video
games and home movies were the domain

of the cool; comics were for the nerds.
In reaching out for an adult audience,
both the subject matter and artwork of
comic books have been forced to change.
Writers such as Alan Moore, Harlan El
lison and Art Spiegalman have begun to
explore adult story lines such as drug ad
diction, physical and sexual abuse, AIDS
and political corruption. To meet the more
rigorous demands of these themes, their
writing has become more fluid and unor
thodox.
Complementing the adult themes is a
more innovative approach to artwork. No
longer does the infamous four color
scheme of "Richie Rich" and "Archie"
define the boundaries of our visual expe
rience.
Instead, comics now favor the sophisti
cated use of abstracts and airbrush. In
some comics, such as Neil Gaiman's "Black
Orchid," the artwork and storyline almost
mesh completely, creating a dramatic,
unified image.
Perhaps the most exciting recent inno
vation in comics is what the industry terms

"graphic novels," book-length strips which
form a single narrative.
While the idea of a graphic novel is rela
tively simple, its very simplicity holds enor
mous creative potential. For one thing, a
graphic novel spares comics from endlessly
rehashing a plot an unfortunate tenet of
daily strips. Second, graphic novelists need
not worry about regular deadlines which
often result in sloppy, unfinished artwork.
As many recent publications have shown,
graphic novels both allow and encourage
comics to combine a coherent narrative
with a consistent style of artwork.
Examples of dramatically successful
comic novels include the political satires
"Brought to Light" and "Watchman" by Alan
Moore and "Maus: A Survivor's Tale" by
Art Spiegalman, a powerful depiction of the
Holocaust.
Despite the popularity of graphic novels,
a new breed of unorthodox comic books
is also enjoying widespread public praise.

in the industry, Roz Chast and Lynda Barry.
