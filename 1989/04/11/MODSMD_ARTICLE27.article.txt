# Roz Chast
## Satirizes today's America 
### The Four Elements" by Roz Chast Harper Row, $8. 95 Reviewed by Mark Smoyer 
• If the only comics you read are
j in your daily paper, you don't
• know what you've been missing.
The work of Roz Chast has been
; appearing in "The New Yorker"
I for many years now. But don't
'.let that stop you from getting a
I hold of her latest anthology, "The
;Four Elements." This late 1988
effectively mocks the
modern-day America of superfi
cial neuroses, consumerism, and,
'to be specific, everything else un
;der the sun.
* Like the culture it satires,
* Chast's basic rule is to put every
thing on display. Objectively, the
► subject matter of her drawings is
I mundane. But the captions of her
'drawings are Written in bombastic
Avenue lingo that en
dows each of her ideas or objects
[with earth-shattering signif
icance. And her whole comic sen
sibility is perfectly accentuated by
* simple line drawings and scraggly
'script.
\ That all-encompassing para
• graph does not really say it all,
but it gives a general basis for
the wide variety of Chast's tech
niques.
In many of the comic panels
(they're sort of like drawn stand
up comedy routines) Chast
presents the everyday Joe or Jane
as he or she would be sold to
America. In this vein we have a
panel called "Profiles ih

Courage," wherein one woman
"Entered exclusive boutique
knowing she wasn't about to buy
anything, and tried on an outfit
costing $14,000!"
Other panels comment on the
advancement of modern civiliza
tion. "Supplementary Scarlet Let
ters" include NJ (Non-Jogger)
and PCR (Poor Credit Risk).
"Sideshow of the Future" promo
tional posters read "See the
Woman Without a 8.A.!" and
"Gaze Freely at the Last Guy Who
Doesn't Have an Answering Ma
chine!"
Chast also lampoons adulation
of the rich and famous, intellec
tual pretension, fast food restau
rants, clothing, airplanes, Dumbo,
depressing canned food, and just
about everything hallowed and
(not or) stupid in modern
America. Lots of her work is sim
ply absurd.

Despite the fact that our fine
nation is the object of her deri
sion, it is doubtful that anyone
would feel resentful
Chast for her mockery. This com
edy isn't vicious commentary at
all. It's getting in on the fun.
And besides, part of the whole
structure of recreation in the good
ol' U.S. of A. is having a laugh
at our own expense. Chast offers
strange angles on everyday life
that help us keep perspective. She
also gives us the opportunity just
to have a good laugh and take
time out from Laserwriting, salad
bars, fuzzy commercials and book
reviews.
