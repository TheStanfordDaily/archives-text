# Lynda Barry
## Resurrects our painful past 
### Down the Street" by Lynda Barry Harper Row, $6. 95 
Lynda Barry's "Down the
Street" portrait of childhood
elicits emotions from poignancy
to exhilaration. It effectively cap
tures what is important in a pre
teen's short-sighted world: the
candy store, the still of a humid
summer night, the irritable old
lady next door, and a multitude
of everyday events magnified far
beyond any adult's possible con
ception.
Barry is a Seattle cartoonist
whose first book, "Big Ideas," in
troduced her to the rest of the
country. She has since produced
five more books, appeared on
"Late Night with David Letter
man" a few times, and now has
her comic strip published in
magazines and weekly newspa
pers all over the country, includ
ing the Bay Area release "Metro."
"Big Ideas," published in 1983,

included her "Poodle with a
Mohawk" frame later to be seen
on T-shirts and posters. Its sub
jects ranged from the creation of
the world to advice on changing
"your look" with everyday
household objects. All of its char
acters were adults.
"Down the Street" is the second
anthology of the new Lynda Barry.
However, just saying "the new
Lynda Barry" is greatly over
simplifying this comic's develop
ment.
The sketchy, pleasantly over
stuffed quality of her early strips
got the reader giggling nonstop.
Now Barry's comics are almost
literature, forcing the reader to
stop and think in between laughs
of self-conscious empathy with
her semi-adorable characters.
But before we discuss litera
ture, we must remember this is
a comic book. Like the children it
presents, the artwork of "Down
the Street" is playful, egocentric
and extreme in its emotions.
Barry has written out all the
copyright information herself in
her child-like printing, noting that
"This is a book of pure fiction
including some of the spelling"
and mentioning, just after the Li
brary of Congress catalog num
ber, that Matt Groening ("Life in
Hell") is "Funklord of USA" (a
credit she also printed in her first
book).
Each Lynda Barry frame (she
has no single title for her work)
is divided by an almost straight
horizontal line. Above the line is
the story's narration, below it a
barely three-dimensional drawing
with occasional dialogue balloons
or instructional guides to the pic
ture. Basically, it locks like it was
done by a fourth-grader and it's
hard to describe which is why
there are examples next to this
stupid review (as Barry would say
were she writing this article).
Of course, this does not mean
Barry has taken the easy way out.
The drawings are very thorough
in their sketchiness, portraying
characters in collaboration with
the narrator's opinion of them,
i.e., a mean teacher is especially
ugly.
When a subject is more difficult
for the narrator to discuss, the
picture becomes hazier. In a panel
suggesting sexual molestation,
Barry draws a frame whose sub
ject is obscured by heavy dark
lines which cross it.

Conversly, memories of which
Barry is especially fond are clearly
delineated. A special clay vase
made in art class is given a frame
to itself: "You know how some
thing can feel so perfect you can't
even blink?"
Barry's early work was based
on a sharp knowledge of
America's cultural foolhardiness,
lampooning beauty make-overs,
late night food binges and insipid
modern romances.
"Down the Street" and 1987's
"The Fun House" let us know
why this foolhardiness is neces
sary. It has something to do with
dealing with insecurities estab
lished way back when you worried
about school pictures in second
grade, or when you realized that
the neighborhood kid who you'd
terrorized was never gonna be
back. If childhood experiences
didn't affect us to our dying day,
Lynda Barry would be out of a job.
"How Things Turn Out," one
of the strips early on in "The Fun
House," sets the tone of Barry's
recent work.
Barry begins "How Things

Turn Out" with this narration:
"In school, of course, there were
the queen girls and then there
were! the rest and at the bottom
of the rest were the ones, what
ever you want to call them, the
ones you would be ashamed to
have to touch. We pretty much
knew who we were by second
grade but it took us until fourth
grade to realize our positions were
fixed." She ends: "It was just
something decided between us,
even though it wasn't us who
decided it. It was something we
all knew about. It was our main
rule of life."
Like this strip, much of "The
Fun House" is heavy-handed;
some stories are downright
depressing. While "Down the
Street" also has a few especially
sad stories, this compilation
seems to go for more laughs (or
at least grins).
Still, it is unwise to enter Bar
ry's American childhood expecting
zany rascals like Calvin (or talking
tigers, like Hobbes) and neither
should you expect any character
who might someday end up
looking out your car window. If
you're in a good mood, you'll wel
come the nostalgic feeling Barry
masterfully creates.
By the final strip of "Down the
Street," you're sure to be feeling
a little wistful and may decide to
fly home to talk with your little
sister and flip through those pho
tographs which were taken before
braces, when skinning your knee
was a daily, but still traumatic,
event.

Don't enter Barry's
American childhood
expecting zany ras
cals like Calvin, or, for
that matter, any char
acter who might
someday end up
looking out your car
window.

"Down the Street" and 1987's
"The Fun House" let us know
why this foolhardiness is neces

dealing with insecurities estab

about school pictures in second
grade, or when you realized that
the neighborhood kid who you'd
terrorized was never gonna be
back. If childhood experiences
didn't affect us to our dying day,
Lynda Barry would be out of a job.
"How Things Turn Out," one
of the strips early on in "The Fun
House," sets the tone of Barry's
recent work.
Barry begins "How Things

Turn Out" with this narration:
"In school, of course, there were
the queen girls and then there
were! the rest and at the bottom
of the rest were the ones, what
ever you want to call them, the
ones you would be ashamed to
have to touch. We pretty much
knew who we were by second
grade but it took us until fourth
grade to realize our positions were
fixed." She ends: "It was just
something decided between us,
even though it wasn't us who
decided it. It was something we
all knew about. It was our main
rule of life."
Like this strip, much of "The
Fun House" is heavy-handed;
some stories are downright
depressing. While "Down the
Street" also has a few especially
sad stories, this compilation
seems to go for more laughs (or
at least grins).
Still, it is unwise to enter Bar
ry's American childhood expecting
zany rascals like Calvin (or talking
tigers, like Hobbes) and neither
should you expect any character
who might someday end up
looking out your car window. If
you're in a good mood, you'll wel
come the nostalgic feeling Barry
masterfully creates.
By the final strip of "Down the
Street," you're sure to be feeling
a little wistful and may decide to
fly home to talk with your little
sister and flip through those pho
tographs which were taken before
braces, when skinning your knee
was a daily, but still traumatic,
event.

Don't enter Barry's
American childhood
expecting zany ras
cals like Calvin, or, for
that matter, any char
acter who might
someday end up
looking out your car
window.

Lynda Barry's "Down the
Street" portrait of childhood
elicits emotions from poignancy
to exhilaration. It effectively cap
tures what is important in a pre
teen's short-sighted world: the
candy store, the still of a humid
summer night, the irritable old
lady next door, and a multitude
of everyday events magnified far
beyond any adult's possible con
ception.
Barry is a Seattle cartoonist
whose first book, "Big Ideas," in
troduced her to the rest of the
country. She has since produced
five more books, appeared on
"Late Night with David Letter
man" a few times, and now has
her comic strip published in
magazines and weekly newspa
pers all over the country, includ
ing the Bay Area release "Metro."
"Big Ideas," published in 1983,

included her "Poodle with a
Mohawk" frame later to be seen
on T-shirts and posters. Its sub
jects ranged from the creation of
the world to advice on changing
"your look" with everyday
household objects. All of its char
acters were adults.
"Down the Street" is the second
anthology of the new Lynda Barry.
However, just saying "the new
Lynda Barry" is greatly over
simplifying this comic's develop
ment.
The sketchy, pleasantly over
stuffed quality of her early strips
got the reader giggling nonstop.
Now Barry's comics are almost
literature, forcing the reader to
stop and think in between laughs
of self-conscious empathy with
her semi-adorable characters.
But before we discuss litera
ture, we must remember this is
a comic book. Like the children it
presents, the artwork of "Down
the Street" is playful, egocentric
and extreme in its emotions.
Barry has written out all the
copyright information herself in
her child-like printing, noting that
"This is a book of pure fiction
including some of the spelling"
and mentioning, just after the Li
brary of Congress catalog num
ber, that Matt Groening ("Life in
