# Lynda Barry
## Resurrects our painful past 
### Down the Street" by Lynda Barry Harper Row, $6. 95 
Lynda Barry's "Down the
Street" portrait of childhood
elicits emotions from poignancy
to exhilaration. It effectively cap
tures what is important in a pre
teen's short-sighted world: the
candy store, the still of a humid
summer night, the irritable old
lady next door, and a multitude
of everyday events magnified far
beyond any adult's possible con
ception.
Barry is a Seattle cartoonist
whose first book, "Big Ideas," in
troduced her to the rest of the
country. She has since produced
five more books, appeared on
"Late Night with David Letter
man" a few times, and now has
her comic strip published in
magazines and weekly newspa
pers all over the country, includ
ing the Bay Area release "Metro."
"Big Ideas," published in 1983,

included her "Poodle with a
Mohawk" frame later to be seen
on T-shirts and posters. Its sub
jects ranged from the creation of
the world to advice on changing
"your look" with everyday
household objects. All of its char
acters were adults.
"Down the Street" is the second
anthology of the new Lynda Barry.
However, just saying "the new
Lynda Barry" is greatly over
simplifying this comic's develop
ment.
The sketchy, pleasantly over
stuffed quality of her early strips
got the reader giggling nonstop.
Now Barry's comics are almost
literature, forcing the reader to
stop and think in between laughs
of self-conscious empathy with
her semi-adorable characters.
But before we discuss litera
ture, we must remember this is
a comic book. Like the children it
