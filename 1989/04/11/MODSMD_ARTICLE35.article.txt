# Sailors cruise over regatta opponents

After a series of challenging regattas, the Stanford
sailing team was in top form again this weekend,
dominating the seventh and eighth events of the
regular-season North Series with a pair of victories.
Held at the Encinal Yacht Club on Alameda Is
land, the North Series regattas drew over 80 com
petitors from eight schools in northern California.
All are vying for a spot among the top-five series
finishers, who will advance to the Pacific Coast
Championships in the first week of May.
In the overall standings, Stanford gained a two
point lead over rival California as the sailors from
Berkeley could only score a pair of third-place
finishes during the weekend. With one North Series
regatta left, the Cardinal is favored to win the series
and go on to the championships as the north region's
top seed.
Behind Stanford's two victories this weekend were
several strong individual performances by Cardinal
teams. On Saturday, the foursome of junior Robert
Brown, sophomore Heidi Park and seniors Ev Rend
and Amy Baltzer took overall honors at the regatta,
but sophomore Rick Rosen and freshman Lydia
Snape also scored an impressive first in the A
division.
On Sunday, the Cardinal was led by Brown and
Park, who won the A division, and senior Buffy
Wendt and freshman Chris Li, who took third in
the B division. Rosen and Snape again captured a
divisional victory, this time in the B division.
Other Cardinal highlights included a first-time
top finish for freshman Ted Huang and junior Jon
Schreiber and a series of strong finishes by Stan
ford's freshmen sailors.
In addition to capturing the top-five places in the
B division on Saturday, Stanford boats never
finished lower than ninth in either day's 20-boat
overall standings.
The women sailors had a particularly good week
end as well. Sailing varsity boats for the Cardinal,
freshman Cathy Petzold, sophomores Sarah Gannett
and Katie Burke, junior Kim Grose find senior Buffy
Wendt all stayed in the front of their fleets through
out the two events. With the women's championships
coming up at the end of April on Stanford's home
waters in Redwood City, the Cardinal seems the
team to beat on the West Coast.
