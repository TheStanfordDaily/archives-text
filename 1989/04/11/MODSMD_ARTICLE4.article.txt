# Campus pizza delivery is wild
## 
### Pam Weisz 
After its first week of free delivery, Wild
Pizza has become Stanford's newest way
to conquer late-night hunger.
The idea started as a senior project for
an industrial engineering class. During win
ter quarter, four students Penny Asroff,
Scott Murdock, Nina Roberts and Randy
von Feldt conducted a market study
aimed at discovering the feasibility of on
campus pizza delivery.
The study revealed that a pizza delivery
service would turn a profit, according to
Roberts. The four students then reported
their results to Solomon Gebala, the direc
tor of the Grand Marketplace, and Tres
idder Food Service Director Greg Mount,

who had shown interest in developing a
pizza delivery service.
The result is Wild Pizza, Stanford's first
on-campus pizza delivery service.
Marriott Corp., which runs the conces
sions at Tresidder Union, has introduced
Wild Pizza at other campuses and decided
to implement it at Stanford this quarter.
Delivery here began last week, according
to David Garcia, the service standards man
ager for Tresidder.
Rather than starting on an experimental
basis, Marriott has put Wild Pizza here
permanently. It will be here "as long as
we're here," Gebala said.
Since delivery started last Thursday,
Wild Pizza has received about 35
orders a night, according to
Gebala. Wild Pizza delivers from
8 p.m. to 1 a.m. every night of
the week. Gebala described the
pizza itself as "an upgraded prod
uct" from the pizza which is sold

at the Corner Pocket.
Delivery of a Wild Pizza takes
from 20 to 30 minutes, according
to Garcia. Getting a cheese pizza
delivered costs the same as buying
one at the Corner Pocket, al
though toppings for a Wild Pizza
cost five cents more due to a larger
selection of toppings than at the
Corner Pocket, Garcia explained.
