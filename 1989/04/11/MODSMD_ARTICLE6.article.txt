As an unusual ASSU General
Election shapes up, the gradu
ate student senatorial race is
taking on a similar complexion.
In the District of Law, Busi
ness and Medicine, two of the
four senate candidates have not
yet enrolled in a Stanford grad
uate school. ASSU Elections
Commissioner Steve Krauss
said senior Peter Thiel, a can
didate in the Law District, has
been accepted to the Law School
- ; ' ' A' - . '•!

but has not decided whether to
enroll, and senior Leonard Ad
ler, another Law District candi
date, has not been accepted to
the Law School yet.
Thiel is editor of The Stanford
Review and was a voting under
graduate senator in 1987-88,
when Adler was a member of
the Council of Presidents.
Krauss said if Adler is not
admitted by April 18, the first
day of voting, he will be dis
qualified from the election. Ac
cording to the ASSU by-laws,
Thiel may participate in the

elections regardless of his deci
sion to enroll in the Law School.
Graduate student senatorial
seats are divided into three dis
tricts: District of Engineering;
District of Law, Business and
Medicine; and District of Hu
manities and Sciences, Educa
tion and Earth Sciences.
Another interesting develop
ment this year is the surge in
Humanities and Science District
candidates and a decreased
number of Law School candi
dates. Nine candidates are run
ning for six positions in the Hu
manities and Science district, four
candidates are running for six po
sitions in the Law District, and
four candidates are running for
eight positions in the Engineering
District.
Graduate student senator David
Fallek said that in the past, the

Law District easily filled its posi
tions while the Humanities and
Sciences and Engineering Dis
tricts had trouble getting enough
candidates.
While the undergraduate senate
seats are decided in a general elec
tion, the graduate senate seats are
divided into districts. This years'
situation highlights a negative ef
fect of districting: not enough
graduate candidates exist for
some districts while candidates
will be rejected in other districts.
