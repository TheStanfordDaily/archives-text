BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) -
Police found a mass grave just
south of the Mexican border yes
terday containing the bodies of a
dozen people who were the victims
of human sacrifice by a satanic
cult of drug smugglers, officials
said.
"It was horrible," Cameron
County Sheriff Alex Perez told a
news conference in this border
city. "It was like a human
slaughterhouse."
Mexican federal police arrested
four people, said sheriffs Lt.
George Gavito. Gavito said the
suspects were U.S. and Mexican
citizens, but did not identify them
further.
The dead found by the federal
police included 21-year-old Uni
versity of Texas student Mark Kil
roy, who vanished during his
spring break last month while in
the Mexican city of Matamoros,
Gavito said.
Kilroy apparently was chosen at
random by drug smugglers who
hoped human sacrifices would
protect them from harm, Gavito
said. He was taken after the cult
members "were told to pick one

Anglo male that particular night,"
the lieutenant said.
The cult had been involved in
human sacrifices for about nine
months, he said, and prayed to
the devil "so the police would not
arrest them, so bullets would not
kill them and so they could make
more money."
Authorities would not comment
on the other victims, and would
not say whether any were U.S.
citizens.
The 12 bodies were found yes
terday morning in a field about
20 miles west of Matamoros,
along with evidence of voodoo or
magic, Gavito said.
"I've been an investigator 15
years and it's one of the worst
things I've ever seen," he said.
Kilroy, a pre-medical student,
vanished from a crowded Mata
moros street shortly after 2 a.m.
on March 14 while on a drinking
foray with a group of friends in
Matamoros, a city of 180,000 just
across the Rio Grande from
Brownsville.
At least one of the suspects ad
mitted involvement in Kilroy's
death, said Oran Neck, chief U.S.
Customs agent in Brownsville.
