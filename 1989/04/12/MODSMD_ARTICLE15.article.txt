### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Terrorism in
creased worldwide to a record level in 1988,
including a jump in the number of anti-U.S.
incidents, the State Department reported to
Congress yesterday.
The bombing of a Pan Am jetliner in De
cember over Scotland, which the department's
office to counter terrorism said probably was
a terrorist incident, and the Palestinian upris
ing on the West Bank and in Gaza helped
push the total of incidents to a new high of
856, up three percent from 1987.
In all, 658 people were killed and 1,131

wounded, an increase in fatalities from 633
in 1987 but a decrease in injuries from 2,272.
The casualty figures include terrorists
themselves who were killed or wounded during
attacks.
Meanwhile, it was disclosed that the Army's
top uniformed lawyer has contended the U.S.
military can legally attack terrorists without
violating a 1976 presidential order that bans
assassinations of individuals abroad.
Maj. Gen. Hugh Overholt, the service's judge
advocate general, argued in an eight-page draft
memorandum that because of changes in"the

nature of the threat," action against terrorists
can be justified on grounds of national self
defense.
Overholt's memorandum was disclosed
Monday by the newsletter Defense Week anc}
confirmed by Army officials.
The State Department report said the
United States remained a primary target for
international terrorism last year, as the num
ber of anti-U.S. incidents rose from 149 in
1987 to 185. They resulted in 192 persons
killed and 40 wounded, compared with seven
Americans killed and 47 wounded in 1987.
