SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -
Chile's military, preparing to sur
render power after 16 years of
authoritarian rule, has vowed to
intervene again if an elected civil
ian government does not maintain
the present "institutional order."
That warning was issued by
President Augusto Pinochet, the
army commander, and the chief
of the military academy of stra
tegic studies.
Pinochet led the coup that
ousted the elected government of
Marxist President Salvador Al

lende in September 1973. In Oc
tober, voters rejected a military
proposal to extend Pinochet's
term until 1997. An open presi
dential election now is scheduled
for Dec. 14 with the winner to
take office next March 11.
The 73-year-old Pinochet,
speaking Monday night in south
ern Chile, said the armed forces
must "guard the constitutional
order."
"That obliges us to make sure,
without hesitation, that the sons
of this land will not see the efforts

of these years destroyed," he said.
"We will continue to work to en
sure that those seeking political
power are authentic democrats,
who defend the model of a free
society."
Army Gen. Alejandro Medina,
commander of the military acad
emy, delivered a stronger message
Monday to hundreds of non
commissioned officers.
"If the institutional order is
broken, the armed forces have the
duty to restore it, using all the
necessary means," he said.
