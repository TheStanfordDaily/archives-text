Gingrich criticizes Wright lawyer
WASHINGTON (AP) - House Speaker Jim
Wright's chief critic yesterday accused the
speaker's lawyer of colluding with Democrats to
violate the secrecy of the ethics committee as it
considers charges against Wright.
"My reaction is sort of beyond rage, into amaze
ment," said Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who filed
the complaint last year that led to the ethics
case against Wright.
A spokesman for Wright maintained the brief
ings for "fewer than 100" House Democrats are

limited to factual arguments and are "entirely
appropriate."

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Republican legislators
yesterday introduced a child-care bill that would
offer a tax credit to low- and moderate-income
families who care for small children at home as
well as those who send their children to day-care
facilities.
"We're going to use the tax code of this country
to put dollars in pockets of parents," said Sen.
