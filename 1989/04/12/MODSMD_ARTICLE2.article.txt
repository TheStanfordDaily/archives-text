# Arms control center secures new chief and new resolve
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
A new nameplate appeared on
an office door at Stanford's Center
for International Security and
Arms Control yesterday after
noon. There was no other decora
tion there, nothing but the
nameplate with the words "Wil
liam Perry."
Inside the office sat an empty
desk with a phone and small lamp,
a table and two chairs. With the
exception of a Courses and
Degrees book, a Faculty/Staff Di
rectory and a jar of rubber ce
ment, there were no signs that
anyone worked there.
Perry, who was approved as co
director of the center just yester
day by the Board of Trustees, as
sumed his modest office confident
that Stanford's struggling center
and arms control in general were
in store for a positive future.

"I have a tremendous regard
for the arms control center,"
Perry said. "I'm very pleased and
proud to be associated with it."
A troubled past
Ever since last November when
physicist Sidney Drell decided to
resign from the co-directorship in
protest of the University's policy
on professorial appointments, a
series of blows have shook up the
center — including the loss of top
members Ted Postol and former
astronaut Sally Ride.
The center, which commanded
a reputation as one of the top in
the world, was left crippled, and
funding was in doubt.
Political Science Prof. John
Lewis, the other co-director of the
center, told The Daily in a recent
interview that he was on the verge
of leaving the center as well. How
ever, he has decided — after long
thought about handsome offers

from other universities fighting
for Stanford's losses — to stay
with the program he helped
create.
Perry, who will officially as
sume his position in August when
Drell steps down, is no newcomer
to the center. He was one of the
key figures who revamped and
renamed the center in 1983 when
Drell took the helm with Lewis,
and he has been a participant ever
since.
Combining industry and business
But Perry is not an academic
by trade. Instead, he combines
leadership in business and gov
ernment. Currently, he is chief ex
ecutive officer at H&Q Technol
ogy Partners, Inc. of Menlo Park,
where he has an office furnished
and decorated in a manner more
appropriate for someone of his
stature.
Perry has long been a top figure

in arms control and defense policy.
Before joining H&Q, Perry was
under secretary of defense for re
search and engineering under
President Carter's administra
tion.
Perry was a highly touted
recruit to the center who drew a
great deal of praise when his se-
