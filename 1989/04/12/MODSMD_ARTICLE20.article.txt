Stanford's new alcohol
policy emphasizes
individual responsibility

IMAGINE A UNIVERSITY
where students under 21,
living in dorms, are prohib
ited from keeping or consuming
alcohol on the premises. Resident
assistants assume the role of
police officers, holding surprise
inspections and ferreting out of
fenders. Students turn each other
in. Resident fellows monitor each
party.
Although this picture holds
true at some universities in the
United States, it does not
describe Stanford. But the Uni
versity's current alcohol policy,
written in the 19605, calls for
just such a scenario.
The University's Alcohol and
Other Drug Prevention Program
Advisory Committee on April 5
submitted a plan to revise Stan
ford's outdated alchohol policy.
Overcoming formidable obstacles
with ease, the plan scraps the
1960 policy that is still unoffi
cially observed. The revision
brings the old policy in line with
the University's philosophy on
fostering individual responsibil
ity.
The suggested revision com
pletely eliminates the mandate
that groups are ultimately re
sponsible for individuals' actions.
Instead, the revision places the
burden of responsible alcohol use
directly on the individual.
"The University, as an educa
tional institution, approaches
student conduct issues from a
perspective that places greater

emphasis on individual responsi
bility and development than on
regulatory measures," the revi
sion states.
The shift in the philosophy of
the two policies reflects Stan
ford's changing role in relation
to its students. The University is
slowly moving away from its
traditional paternalistic role,
which attempted to mold stu
dents' behavior to some concep
tion of how "good citizens" should
act, to a role that encourages in
dividual growth and responsibil
ity.
Although this shift has been
occurring de facto, revision of the
alcohol policy marks a first
chance to formalize it in writing.
As the University officially
abandons its role as regulator, it
should be encouraged to sponsor
more innovative educational pro
grams on alcohol use and abuse.
Residential Education already
has taken the lead in this area,
with such events as Toyon Hall's
program last spring in which stu
dent volunteers drank beer and
shots and were then tested by
police to show the effect of alcohol
on motor coordination.
The revision appropriately ack
nowleges that "Stanford Univer
sity is not a sanctuary from the
enforcement of state and local
laws." Stanford should educate
students about the laws, but it
is the students' decision whether
or not to follow them.
And if 18-year old freshmen
decide to drink beer, then the
state judicial system can punish
them, not the University.
Not only is the police state out
lined in Stanford's current alco
hol policy unenforceable, but it
runs counter to the basic goals
of the University.
