## Objectification hurts equality, freedom and justice 
### 
LAST QUARTER various letters
were written to The Daily con
cerning an Alpha Epsilon Pi
Fraternity party flier that was criti
cized by many as sexist because it
objectified women as sex objects. Re
cently, Ted Delianides, a graduate
student, wrote in to complain about
the objectification (he uses the word
stereotype) of graduate students as
"alien creatures devoid of social
graces."
This objectification of groups within
our society is undoubtedly a serious
issue that affects everyone; even athle
tic, handsome, white males sometimes
suffer from being objectified as "bodies
without a brain."
Unfortunately, objectification is an
inevitable part of our existence since
whenever we confront others we con
front them as human objects that can
only acquire subjectivity when we (as
the subject) interact with them either
through direct interaction, e.g., two

people talking, or indirect interaction,
e.g., reading a book.
There are varying degrees of harm,
and some good, that can come from
objectifying others. An example of
positive objectification occurs when
potential employers in their search for
new employees prefer students from
schools such as Stanford because they
objectify those students as intelligent,
high achieving human objects that
should receive special priority.
On the other hand, the harm that
comes from negative objectifications is
the source of some of the most serious
social evils such as racism, sexism and
homophobia.
Hitler's racist propaganda relied on
objectifying the Jew as a greedy, sel
fish, big-nosed inferior object much
like the American media in the first
half of this century objectified the
black person as an ignorant, lazy, loud
and more primitive human object
through shows like "Amos and Andy"

and the use of "black-face."
Clearly, these negative objectifica
tions are very harmful since they
permeated society as stereotypes that
have made it more difficult for the
members in these groups to interact on
the same social, political and economic
level as the oppressive group.
You may think you are exempt from
holding these racist views, which may
be true, but you still have the respon
sibility of not objectifying another in
racist terms through the use of "harm
less racist jokes that nobody takes
seriously" because the racist
stereotypes in these jokes have been
and are a very real threat to the
oppressed group. The racist objectifica
tions must be abolished in any form
they may manifest themselves.
Placing a woman in a bikini posing
seductively on a flier is one
example of using a woman as an object
intended to sexually excite. This would
not be a serious concern if women

were not constantly treated as sex
objects, but since they are, it is a very
serious issue because being objectified
as a sex object has made it more
difficult for women to be treated as
equals in society.
Unlike the male, a woman has the
added burden of proving that she is
more than the sex object she is so
often portrayed as in the media.
Similarly, the graduate student has the
added burden of proving that he or she
is more human and social than the
stereotype indicates.
These added burdens to the target
groups within our community are at
least unfair and they are definitely the
source of anguish and frustration for
many of those who are members of
these groups. Moreover, they strike a
toppling blow at the very foundations
of a society that claims equality, free
dom and justice for all.
