# Rising sun on flier connotes atrocities of World War II
## 
### 
Recently I came across a flier which
caught my eye. A depiction of a rising
sun invited freshmen and sophomores
to attend Kappa Alpha's Rush party.
Emanating from the sun centered in
the flier were spikes of red branching
out in all directions.
I deplore the insensitive use of the
symbol of the spiked rising sun. For
those of us whose parents lived in
China or anywhere else under
Japanese occupation during World War
11, a rising sun with protruding rays

connotes the atrocities of Japanese
militarism.
Perhaps the artist forgot or did not
know that the rising sun, spikes and .
all, served as the centerpiece of the
Japanese flag during World War 11.
Of course, I can hardly suspect the
KAs of serving as a front for right
wing Japanese militarists. But regard
less of intentions, the fact remains that
their flier depicted an inflammatory
symbol.
Though historical analogies can be
misleading, I somehow doubt the artist
would have ever considered using a
swastika on his flier. Any student of
modern Chinese history could tell the
artist about the Rape of Nanking, a
massacre which I am confident would
meet Hitler's standards of barbarity.

For most Americans, the comparison
between a swastika and the spiked
rising sun may seem stretched, for I
doubt that as many know about
Japanese atrocities as about German
ones.
And indeed, one would hardly want
to debate whether one large-scale
atrocity is somehow worse than an
other. Regardless, the idea that the
spiked rising sun may be less offensive
than the swastika hardly justifies its
use.
I don't understand why the artist
would even consider using this symbol.
Perhaps the KAs were trying to sug
gest that kamikazes would be served at
the party.
