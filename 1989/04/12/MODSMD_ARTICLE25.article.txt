## One fateful spring day 
### 
IF I WERE ABLE to travel 45 years
back, to the other side of the world,
I would see my dad Ming attending
elementary school in World War II
Taiwan.
Taiwan, which had been controlled by
the Japanese for many years, was being
used as a Japanese base. More specifi
cally, the area around my father's house
was being used as a Japanese aircraft
base. My father's house was a few blocks
away from school and near the Japanese
base.
This was the time of the kamikaze
missions, young Japanese pilots flying
planes loaded with explosives for suicidal
crash attacks that would destroy Amer
ican warships and bases.
My dad told me about the nervous boys
of ages 17 and 18 hanging around town,
knowing that their turn would come
eventually, their turn at a mission in
which success would be coupled with
their own death.
And of course the United States, real
izing the potential damage of the
kamikaze planes, sought to destroy them
so that they would never get off the
ground. Every now and then, my dad's
town would be raided by American
aircraft trying to bomb the planes.
The Japanese would hide many of their
small kamikaze aircraft under trees in
the area, and cover them with hay and
branches so that they would be harder
to spot, harder to bomb.
Imagine going to school in that setting.
From my dad's house, you could look
across the street and see one of the
camouflaged kamikaze planes hidden un

der a tree. In the event of an air raid
during school, warning sirens would go
off and the students were dismissed so
they could run home and seek cover in
a bomb shelter.
But one time, U.S. planes must have
evaded the radar, because by the time
the warning sirens had gone off, the
planes were within striking distance. It
was too late to go home, and the students
were told to hide under their desks. All
they could do was wait and hope.
At this point, my dad had a strange
feeling â€” he's told me that it was the
funniest feeling he's ever had in his life.
He told his friend next to him that he
was going to run home. His friend was
worried and said, "No, don't go! Are you
crazy? I'm going to tell the teacher!"
My dad started to leave and the teacher
started screaming at him, commanding
him to come back at once. In those days,
what the teachers said was understood
and done with absolute respect. Disobey
ing the teacher was a high crime worthy
of severe whippings. "Come back! Come
back now!"
But he left, and as he ran home, there
was an explosion by the school. The next
day he would find out that a hole had
been blasted in the wall of the school and
his friend had been killed by aircraft fire.
My dad realized that he would have
been killed when he saw that the blasted
wall was right next to his desk. If he
had not followed that funny feeling, he
would have been squatting under that
desk, waiting like a duck, a dead duck.
He would have died.
In the same attack, U.S. planes dropped

bombs along my dad's block in their
search for the hidden kamikaze planes.
Every single house on the block had been
hit. Except his. And luckily, the bombs
did not explode. Although the 250-pound
bombs had smashed holes through the
houses, the houses were still standing.
There must have been an error in the
manufacturing of the bombs. In that one
day, my father had been touched by luck
in the most intimate manner, and we
can thank fortune for that and for the
many other things in our lives.
