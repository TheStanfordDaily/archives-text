## Hypermedia marriage weds computers to social sciences 
### Frank Chen 
Imagine writing a research
paper on Mozart's "Don Giovan
ni." You sit down at a collection
of computers, televisions and
videodisc players and type
"Mozart's Don Giovanni."
Instantly a screenful of options
appears. With the click of a but
ton, watch the Metropolitan
Opera's production of the opera
on the television, hear accompa
nying CD-quality music and per
haps even partition off a corner
of the screen to see the conduc
tor's score.
Afterwards, with a few more
clicks, examine any relevant top
ics: Mozart biographies, opera his
tories and criticisms, makeup and
costuming techniques, musical
dictionaries, perhaps even a
Salieri letter jeering Mozart's
newest masterpiece.
The creators of this multimedia
marriage of video, audio and com
puter devices, loosely called "hy
permedia," — among other
buzzwords — are striving to
realize this research dream.
Using computers to mediate be
tween the user and millions of
bits of data, hypermedia is a
revolutionary way of organizing
and accessing information.
Traditional text-and-pictures
biographies of Mozart might be
replaced by hypermedia biogra
phies with video clips, digital
sound and the potential to access
relevant material almost instantly.
The computer's ability to store
and locate data quickly will
automate the laborious process of
shuffling between volumes of
books and reams of film.
HyperCard for the Macintosh
Tentative steps have already
been made in this direction. The
workhorse of hypermedia today is
Apple Computer's "HyperCard,"
an application program which al
lows even computer novices to
create vast, attractive and easy
to-use databases of information.
The organizational unit of "Hy
perCard" is, appropriately, a card.
Like a standard index card, users
can place any visual information
they want on a card, from names
and addresses to full-color photo
graphs, from Chinese characters
to city maps.

Related cards are collected into
"stacks." For example, one might
keep a "date stack" full of names,
photos and phone numbers or,
more likely, a "tape stack" full of
the album covers and song titles
from an album collection.

The computer's
ability to store and
locate data quickly
will automate the
laborious process
of shuffling be
tween volumes of
books and reams
of film.

The user can also put "buttons"
on a stack. For example, one
might put an arrow icon onto an
address card. When the user
moves the mouse onto the arrow
and pushes the button, the next
name and address in the stack
appears.
Interconnectivity
Such an address book has linear
structure. One card might lead to
the next, just as one page in a
book leads to the next page.
But "HyperCard" also can dis
play interconnectivity, complex re
lations between a set of cards.
With the same address stack, the
user can push a map icon to bring
up a detailed street map showing
exactly where the person lives.
From the map, the user can
find other friends in the neigh
borhood simply by pressing an
other button.
This feature demonstrates spa
tial, rather than alphabetical, re
lationships — perhaps a more
natural way of thinking, say some
computer scientists.
To help keep track of the 1988
election campaign, ABC News
used a HyperCard application
called MAGNA, Macintosh ABC
General News Almanac. With
MAGNA, journalists with no prior

computer background could easily
and quickly access any important
election news, from a short biog
raphy and picture of the leading
contenders to Dukakis' stance on
Star Wars to the political leanings
of the lowa caucus.
MAGNA contained thousands of
facts gathered onto 5,000 cards
and some 130 stacks.
Good, but not perfect
One of the problems of hyper
media is memory. ABC's MAGNA
obviously demanded a large
amount of disk space, yet it only
covered one election year.
Fortunately for computer scien
tists, new storage possibilities are
making memory requirements
less of a problem. "Compact Disc,
Read Only Memory," for example,
stores over 550 megabytes of data
— the equivalent of 150,000 pages
of text or 700 Macintosh floppy
disks — on an audio CD-sized
disc. The drawback of CD-ROM
is identical to that of an audio
CD; you can't record on a CD.
Once made, the CD is unchange
able.
Emerging technology, like
"Write Once, Read Many" drives
— or WORM drives — and
erasable CDs are beginning to
challenge even that limitation.
Neither of these devices have
gained widespread acceptance yet.
Hardware is another problem.
What is the best way to connect
a computer, a videodisc player and
a television, for example, to
achieve maximum effectiveness
with the technique? Deciding
which machines to connect is an
other obvious dilemma.
A popular combination today is
an Macintosh computer, a Pioneer
videodisc player and a Sony color
TV. Electric Cadaver, a hyper
media program developed at the
Stanford Medical School, for ex
ample, uses this combination, as
does the English Department's
Shakespeare Project (see accom
panying article).
As industry gropes towards a
hypermedia standard and mem
ory capacities continue to in
crease, the marriage of video,
audio and computer technology —
the hypermedia dream — will be
consummated.

tists, new storage possibilities are
making memory requirements
less of a problem. "Compact Disc,
Read Only Memory," for example,
stores over 550 megabytes of data
— the equivalent of 150,000 pages
of text or 700 Macintosh floppy
disks — on an audio CD-sized
disc. The drawback of CD-ROM
is identical to that of an audio
CD; you can't record on a CD.
Once made, the CD is unchange
able.
Emerging technology, like
"Write Once, Read Many" drives
— or WORM drives — and
erasable CDs are beginning to
challenge even that limitation.
Neither of these devices have
gained widespread acceptance yet.
Hardware is another problem.
What is the best way to connect
a computer, a videodisc player and
a television, for example, to
achieve maximum effectiveness
with the technique? Deciding
which machines to connect is an
other obvious dilemma.
A popular combination today is
an Macintosh computer, a Pioneer
videodisc player and a Sony color
TV. Electric Cadaver, a hyper
media program developed at the
Stanford Medical School, for ex
ample, uses this combination, as
does the English Department's
Shakespeare Project (see accom
panying article).
As industry gropes towards a
hypermedia standard and mem
ory capacities continue to in
crease, the marriage of video,
audio and computer technology —
the hypermedia dream — will be
consummated.
Imagine writing a research
paper on Mozart's "Don Giovan
ni." You sit down at a collection
of computers, televisions and
videodisc players and type
"Mozart's Don Giovanni."
Instantly a screenful of options
appears. With the click of a but
ton, watch the Metropolitan
Opera's production of the opera
on the television, hear accompa
nying CD-quality music and per
haps even partition off a corner
of the screen to see the conduc
tor's score.
Afterwards, with a few more
clicks, examine any relevant top
ics: Mozart biographies, opera his
tories and criticisms, makeup and
costuming techniques, musical
dictionaries, perhaps even a
Salieri letter jeering Mozart's
newest masterpiece.
The creators of this multimedia
marriage of video, audio and com
puter devices, loosely called "hy
permedia," — among other
buzzwords — are striving to
realize this research dream.
Using computers to mediate be
tween the user and millions of
bits of data, hypermedia is a
revolutionary way of organizing
and accessing information.
Traditional text-and-pictures
biographies of Mozart might be
replaced by hypermedia biogra
phies with video clips, digital
sound and the potential to access
relevant material almost instantly.
The computer's ability to store
and locate data quickly will
automate the laborious process of
shuffling between volumes of
books and reams of film.
HyperCard for the Macintosh
Tentative steps have already
been made in this direction. The
workhorse of hypermedia today is
Apple Computer's "HyperCard,"
an application program which al
lows even computer novices to
create vast, attractive and easy
to-use databases of information.
The organizational unit of "Hy
perCard" is, appropriately, a card.
Like a standard index card, users
can place any visual information
they want on a card, from names
and addresses to full-color photo
graphs, from Chinese characters
to city maps.

Related cards are collected into
"stacks." For example, one might
keep a "date stack" full of names,
photos and phone numbers or,
more likely, a "tape stack" full of
the album covers and song titles
from an album collection.

The computer's
ability to store and
locate data quickly
will automate the
laborious process
of shuffling be
tween volumes of
books and reams
of film.

The user can also put "buttons"
on a stack. For example, one
might put an arrow icon onto an
address card. When the user
moves the mouse onto the arrow
and pushes the button, the next
name and address in the stack
appears.
Interconnectivity
Such an address book has linear
structure. One card might lead to
the next, just as one page in a
book leads to the next page.
But "HyperCard" also can dis
play interconnectivity, complex re
lations between a set of cards.
With the same address stack, the
user can push a map icon to bring
up a detailed street map showing
exactly where the person lives.
From the map, the user can
find other friends in the neigh
borhood simply by pressing an
other button.
This feature demonstrates spa
tial, rather than alphabetical, re
lationships — perhaps a more
natural way of thinking, say some
computer scientists.
To help keep track of the 1988
election campaign, ABC News
used a HyperCard application
called MAGNA, Macintosh ABC
General News Almanac. With
MAGNA, journalists with no prior

computer background could easily
and quickly access any important
election news, from a short biog
raphy and picture of the leading
contenders to Dukakis' stance on
Star Wars to the political leanings
of the lowa caucus.
MAGNA contained thousands of
facts gathered onto 5,000 cards
and some 130 stacks.
Good, but not perfect
One of the problems of hyper
media is memory. ABC's MAGNA
obviously demanded a large
amount of disk space, yet it only
covered one election year.

tists, new storage possibilities are
