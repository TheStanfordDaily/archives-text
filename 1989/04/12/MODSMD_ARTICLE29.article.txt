A seedy-looking Hamlet is
busily seducing lovely Ophelia
on the television screen. Mean
while, a nearby computer is
keeping pace with the actor's
lines, the original Shakespeare
text and even a literary com
mentary.
Dissatisfied with this inter
pretation? With the click of a
button, an entirely different pro
duction of the same nunnery
scene plays: A frightened
looking Ophelia discovers Ham
let in a dark hallway. No
seducer, this Hamlet humiliates
and terrifies Ophelia, whom he
suspects of treachery.
As unrelated as they may
seem, Shakespearean theater
and computer science are com
ing together in unusual ways.
With the Shakespeare Project,

developed by English Prof.
Larry Friedlander, students
have a new way of exploring the
complex art of theater with "hy
permedia," an emerging tech
nology with numerous appli
cations.
Using Apple Computer's "Hy
perCard" program on a Macin
tosh computer and a videodisc
player, theater students can
view noted productions of fa
mous Shakespearean scenes. As
the scene, recorded on videodisc,
is played out on television, the
computer screen can accompany
with any of a number of aids:
Shakespeare's original text, a
critical commentary and the ac
tor's actual lines are but a few
examples.
A novel part of the program
is a notebook in which students

can write multimedia essays
with video quotes. "Watch how
Hamlet approaches Ophelia,"
might read a sample essay. To
see the scene mentioned, a
reader would simply move the
mouse over a special "playback"
symbol inserted by the writer
and push the button.
Another part of the Shake
speare Project is called the
Theater Game.
Since the program suggests
some questions to think about
before playing each scene, stu
dents are encouraged to get ac
tively involved. The interactive
nature of the Shakespeare Proj
ect encourages students to ask
the questions, "How would I
play the character?" or "How
can I direct this scene?"
