# Slating the Students' Choice

Editor's note: This is the first
in a three-part series of inter
views with the slates running
for Council of Presidents.

Pledging to represent a broad
spectrum of ideas, the Students'
Choice slate said they will im
plement practical improvements
in student services — while
avoiding a political agenda — if
victorious in the upcoming
Council of Presidents' election.
"The bottom line is that we
just want to serve the students,"
junior Jennifer Wu told The
Daily yesterday in an hour-long

interview with the slate.
Wu and her three running
mates — junior Frank Quara
tiello, sophomore Alex Hoye and
junior Anthony Chor — asserted
that they have a broader per
spective than their most for
midable opponent, The Slate of
the Times sponsored by the
People's Platform.
The People's Platform won
last year's COP election. Stu
dents' Choice is sponsored by
the newly-formed political party,
Students First. Hammer and
Coffin — a slate representing
the Chapparal — is the third
slate in this year's race.

summer break.
When asked what their chief
goal was, Chor said the slate hoped
to "establish lines of communica
tion with the student body and
with the administration and with
the ASSU." The candidates said
that if elected they will try to
more effectively use the ASSU
straw polls to gauge student op
inion.
Opponent's shortcomings
Chor faulted this year's COP
for only using the polls after the
fact — once decisions and policy
changes had already been imple
mented. The results of Students'
Choice's straw polls will be dis
tributed to University administra
tors in a monthly newsletter, he
said.
Hoye said this process would
ensure that the COP is not "sup
posedly working for the students
without really knowing [their
opinions.]"
Quaratiello said the current
COP has not lived up to last year's

campaign promises and is making
the same proposals again.
"Once they got in office they
didn't do those things, and now
they're using them again. When
we get in office we'll concentrate
on those things. We won't be dis
tracted away from issues that are
student concerns," he said.
Hoye also criticized this year's
COP for presenting an unclear
picture of their own achievements
through publicity and news con
ferences. "We've worked in the
ASSU offices, and we've seen
what's actually going on," he said.
Qualifications
When asked what makes them
most qualified for the job,
Quaratiello stressed the varied ex
perience of the four candidates
both in and out of the ASSU.
Quaratiello is an ASSU under
graduate senator, Hoye is ASSU
assistant administrative manager,
Wu is ASSU news editor, and
Chor is president of the Kappa
Alpha Fraternity.
The candidates pledged to act
as a voice for all students, includ
ing those minority students who
the slate believes are not being
represented by campus student
groups. Chor noted that Asian
American Student Association
meetings are attended by 15 to
20 people who supposedly repre
sent an Asian community of more
than 800.
