Live as a 17th-century French
nobleman or a Japanese child
growing up during World War 11.
The hypermedia explosion is
making this brand of vicarious
living more realistic — and edu
cational — than ever.
With a sort of computerized
Choose-You r-Own-Ad venture, ■
are getting a better feel for foreign
cultures. Based on the "Hyper-
Card" program for the Macintosh
computer, the simulations com
bine text and graphic images on
"cards" that lead students
through a stage of someone's life.
A sample card might include a
scene from a school playground or
excerpts from a Japanese
textbook.
Shogai — Japanese for "life
course" — is a recent project of
Anthropology Prof. Harumi Befu.
Users will "direct" the life of Yos
hio Yamada, born to a middle

class Japanese family in 1930.
Later, Yoshio will have a
daughter, Nariko, and the simula
tion continues with her life in
post-World War II Japan.
Users make decisions about
Yoshio's life. While sitting in his
first grade classroom, for exam
ple, one can decide whether he
should read a textbook, practice
writing or look at a comic book.
Choosing any of these will lead
to appropriate cards. Using the
mouse, one can really practice
writing Japanese characters; the
textbook seen is modelled after
the actual text used in Japanese
elementary schools. Even the
comic book is realistic.
The decisions made, of course,
will affect Yoshio's later life.
Being studious at an early age —
so crucial in modern day Japan
— will allow Yamada to attend

one of Japan's prestigious univer
sities, and hence go on to a pres
tigious, lucrative career.
Interspersed with decision
making is the drama of everyday
life. When Yamada is in fifth
grade, the principal walks in and
gravely announces that Japanese
bombers have attacked American
forces stationed at Pearl Harbor.
After the principal's announce
ment, users can choose to read
the major newspapers of the day.
Clicking on headlines will reveal
English translations.
Other details include photo
graphs of potential brides, leaflets
dropped by Allied bombers urging
surrender and Japanese music in
the background.
Graduate students Deborah
Zimmerman and Jill Antonides
are working to make Shogai more
interactive and less narrative. The
focus is on making decisions;

learning by doing is the guiding
principle.
Shogai is actually being devel
oped using Alias, itself a Hyper-
Card application developed at
Academic Information Resources
on campus. Alias allows novices
to create simulations of any per
son in any time period or culture.
In addition to Shogai, program
mers have used Alias to create a
simulation of 17th-century French
court life. Users decide whether
or not to pay taxes and harvest
crops. Tax evasion may result in
a hanging, while skimpy harvests
may make marriage prospects
dim.
Befu is now in Japan gathering
more material for Shogai. Video
clips recorded on a videodisc
might be incorporated into the
program if resources permit. A
preliminary version of Shogai will
be ready for release by this sum
mer.

learn about other cultures through a role-playing game.
