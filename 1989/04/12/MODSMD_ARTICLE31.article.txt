# 'Passing gas' under crooked bridges can be an explosive issue
## The 						Science Bug 
### Alan Gutman Staff writer 
. Can you please answer an
\y •age-old question for me?
When a person passes gas, why

does it smell? Also, does the gas
rise or sink ?
A # The malodor of this bodily
• vapor which leaves everyone
in a crowd — except for its source
— aghast and gasping for air is
methane, according to Biological
Sciences Asst. Prof. Robert
Sapolsky.
"Broken wind" consists of gas
produced by the bacteria residing
in the large intestines. The bac
teria produce hydrogen, methane
and carbon dioxide by fermenting
food. Usually the gas is absorbed
by the colon, but sometimes it is
expelled from the body in what
is commonly known as a fart.
Methane provides the passed
gas with its characteristic foul
odor. These gases rise — other
wise, no one would smell them.
Foods poorly digested or
nutritious for the bacteria in
crease the amount of gas produced
within the body. If food is not
completely digested, it provides
the bacteria with more food, in
creasing the amount of gas
generated.
Some food not absorbed by the
body is especially nourishing for
the bacteria. Among the leading
offenders in the production of
"farts" are cabbage, onions,

cauliflower, other foods with cel
lulose, vinegar and — of course
— the notorious beans.
Spicy foods also cause this
smelly ejection by the body. They
irritate the colon and prevent it
from absorbing the gas produced
by the bacteria.
Breaking wind is harmless, but
in very rare occasions oxygen
taken in from the air combines
with the hydrogen and methane
in the colon in an explosive mix
ture. A spark, an open flame, or
some other cause can blow up the
large intestines, according to
Sapolsky. It's just something to
keep in mind.
, Why are &ome bridges
Vl/ • crooked? I thought that in
real Euclidean space the shortest
distance between two points is a
straight line.
A. According to Civil Engi
neering Asst. Prof. Peter
Pinsky, some bridges are designed
with considerations other than
the shortest distance between two
points in mind.
Bridges can be designed crooked
because of practical considera
tions, such as looking for good
rock under the bridge to provide
stability, Pinsky said.

Incidentally, Einstein's general
theory of relativity did away with
the notion that we live in a
Euclidean world — one in which
squares have right angles and tri
angles have 180 degrees inside
them. Luckily for us, the
Einsteinian corrections to
Euclidean geometry on the earth
are so small that they wouldn't
affect the way bridges look.

• have a "normal/metal" tape
switch on my stereo. What differ
ence does this switch make in
playing and recording? Is it a
hoax?
A. According to Jay Kadis, au
• dio engineer at the Center
for Computer Research in Music
and Acoustics on campus, the
manufacturers of little switches
and decals that say "normal/me
tal" are not swindling stereo
owners out of millions of dollars.
When recording music, the
heads of the tape deck convert
the electrical signals of the music
into magnetic signals on a cas
sette. The magnetic properties of
a cassette are related to the com
position of the particles on the
tape.
Since a metal tape contains

little pieces of metal, it is harder
to magnetize its particles than to
magnetize the particles of a
chromium dioxide tape or a nor
mal tape. The metal position of
the switch increases the signal on
the heads to properly magnetize
the particles of a metal tape.
During playback the switch has
a different function. The faster
the particles pass by the head dur
ing playback the more signal is
produced. Since the particles on

a metal tape are more densely
packed than a normal chrome
tape, it produces a higher fre
quency.
Due to its high frequency re
sponse, a metal tape on normal
playback has too "bright" of a
sound. Setting the switch on
metal will "flatten" the sound by
reducing the amount of treble.
The equalization produced by the
switch varies among tape decks,
according to Kadis.

Euclidean world — one in which
squares have right angles and tri
angles have 180 degrees inside
them. Luckily for us, the
Einsteinian corrections to
Euclidean geometry on the earth
are so small that they wouldn't
affect the way bridges look.

• have a "normal/metal" tape
switch on my stereo. What differ
ence does this switch make in
playing and recording? Is it a
hoax?
A. According to Jay Kadis, au
• dio engineer at the Center
for Computer Research in Music
and Acoustics on campus, the
manufacturers of little switches
and decals that say "normal/me
tal" are not swindling stereo
owners out of millions of dollars.
When recording music, the
heads of the tape deck convert
the electrical signals of the music
into magnetic signals on a cas
sette. The magnetic properties of
a cassette are related to the com
position of the particles on the
tape.
Since a metal tape contains

little pieces of metal, it is harder
to magnetize its particles than to
magnetize the particles of a
chromium dioxide tape or a nor
mal tape. The metal position of
the switch increases the signal on
the heads to properly magnetize
the particles of a metal tape.
During playback the switch has
a different function. The faster
the particles pass by the head dur
ing playback the more signal is
produced. Since the particles on

a metal tape are more densely
packed than a normal chrome
tape, it produces a higher fre
quency.
Due to its high frequency re
sponse, a metal tape on normal
playback has too "bright" of a
sound. Setting the switch on
metal will "flatten" the sound by
reducing the amount of treble.
The equalization produced by the
switch varies among tape decks,
according to Kadis.
