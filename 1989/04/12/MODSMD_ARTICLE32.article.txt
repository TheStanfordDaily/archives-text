## Cardinal holds on to defeat No. 2 California 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY — With a stirring
display of determination from the
heart of its singles lineup and a
remarkable performance from its
top doubles tandem, the Stanford
men's tennis team served notice
yesterday afternoon that the Car
dinal will be a force to be reckoned
with in the final six weeks of the
1989 season.

Men's Tennis
Cardinal 5, Bears 4

Stanford's win over No. 2 Cal
ifornia, which brings the Cardi
nal's record to 10-5 (3-2 in the
Pacific 10 Conference), may have
marked a turning point in the
team's season. After a rocky road
trip to Southern California, dur
ing which Stanford seemed to
have lost its competitive fire, yes
terday's grind-it-out, gutty vic
tory might be just what the doctor
ordered.
"This is a big, big win," Stan
ford Asst. Coach John Whitlinger
said. "This could be the start of
a new season for us."
The new Cardinal, which has a
record of 1-0, had to hold on to
beat the Bears, who found them
selves down 4-2 after the singles
matches. California battled back
to tie Stanford at 4-4 before Jeff
Tarango and Alex O'Brien iced
the win with their 6-4, 7-6 tri
umph over Woody Hunt and Ted
Scherman in the No. 1 doubles
match.
The Tarango-O'Brien win was
huge not only because it gave
Stanford the win, but because
Hunt and Scherman are ranked

No. 1 in the country in doubles.
The pair defeated defending
NCAA doubles champions Brian
Garrow and Pat Galbraith of
UCLA at the Rolex National In
door Tournament in February
and have been ranked first in the
nation ever since.
Hunt and Scherman have been
thorns in the side of the Cardinal
for quite some time. "I don't know
if we have ever beaten them
before, and we've had some pretty
good doubles players here the last
few years," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said.
The stage was set for Tarango
and O'Brien's heroics by the No.
2 through No. 5 players in the
Cardinal's singles lineup, who
gave Stanford the luxury of
needing only one win in doubles
to wrap up the match.
Jeff Cathrall snapped a per
sonal two-match losing streak (the
first time this season he has lost
as many as two matches in a given
month) with a quick 6-4, 6-4 win
over Kurt Streeter.
At No. 3, Martin Blackman
scored his first win since his
return from illness, downing
Doug Eisenman 6-3, 6-7, 6-3.
Blackman had a shot at wrapping
up the match in the second-set
tiebreaker, but his overhead
smash with the score tied at five
found nothing but net, and Eisen
man took the next point for the
set.
Blackman, apparently mad at
himself, took charge in the final
set, breaking early and riding a
resurgent serve to close out the
match by forcing Eisenman into
two receiving errors.
Alex O'Brien got into the act
by crushing Ted Scherman 6-3,
6-4. With Hunt's earlier 6-1, 6-2
shellacking of Tarango at No. 1,

'This could be the
start of a new
season for us.'

the Cardinal had a 3-1 lead, and
had a chance to end the match
without playing doubles, for both
Barry Richards and Glenn
Solomon were up in the third sets
of their respective matches.
Richards has been a quiet force
for Stanford this season, racking
up an undefeated singles record
playing in the No. 6 spot. His
unbeaten string, however, came
to an end against Matt Lucena,
who came from behind to take a
1-6, 6-3, 7-5 decision forcing the
match to go to doubles. All eyes
then fell on the Solomon-Carl
Chang battle.
Solomon, like the rest of the
team, has had his problems in the
last few matches. A case in point
would be the ninth game of the
third set. With Solomon serving
at 5-3, Chang held off a match
point for a break to get back on
serve.
For Solomon, the situation was
a little too much like last Friday's.
"I had a flashback to UCLA for
a second," Solomon said, referring
to the match in which he was up
a break at 4-3 in the third set
and still lost. "I was pretty happy
with the way I stayed composed,
though."
Stay composed he did. Serving
with the set tied at five games,
Solomon went ahead 3-1 before
Chang ended a long rally with a
forehand winner to get to 3-2. On
the next point, Chang hit a
topspin lob, Solomon slipped
trying to race back to the shot,

and the score was tied. Chang put
a return in the net on the next
exchange, though, and Solomon
had a 6-5 lead.
With Chang serving to stay in
the match, Solomon got to match
point again at 3-3. After two
baseline shots, Solomon raced in
to the net. Chang returned
Solomon's first volley, but the sec
ond was out of his reach, and

Solomon had the win.
"This was probably my biggest
win for the team this year,"
Solomon said. "I don't think this
is the best I've played all year . . .
(but] this was the toughest match
I've played, mentally."
"Glenn stayed in under extreme
pressure," Gould said. "He's been
a little snake-bitten lately, and it's
nice to see him get the win that

was key to the team victory."
Solomon's triumph gave the
Cardinal its 4-2 lead, and the team
used every bit of that cushion
before Tarango and O'Brien came
through.
"We were prepared for the full
15 rounds today," Gould said. "In
L.A. we couldn't answer the bell
for the 15th, but today we were
ready."
