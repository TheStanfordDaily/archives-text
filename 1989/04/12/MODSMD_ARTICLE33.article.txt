# Accusations of Rose are questionable
## 
### 
A Rose by any other name could
hardly smell more foul at this
point.
At least it seems that way.
If recent reports that Pete Rose bet
on the Reds prove to be true, the man
who is synonymous with baseball will
be banned from the game he loves for
the rest of his life.
The latest allegations came from
Paul Janszen, who is currently doing
time for tax evasion. Janszen said he
placed bets for Rose and himself â€”
and some of those bets involved Reds'
games.
Until the investigation is complete,
it will be impossible to know for sure
if these reports are true, but there's
already something fishy about the
whole thing . . . and I don't mean a
dead flounder sent by Federal Express.
See, just about everyone who has
emerged from the woodwork to assas
sinate the character of Charlie Hustle
is either up the river or planning to
catch the next boat. Apparently, many
of these model citizens have been
nailed in a recent IRS-FBI sting de
signed to close down some of the
larger betting operations around Cin
cinnati.
They're just the kind of people
who'd be happy to bust an American
icon in order to knock a few months
off their prison sentences. They might

even, dare I say it, lie about it when
pressured by members of our fine gov
ernment agencies.
They've got nothing to gain by pro
tecting Rose, nor by admitting they
have no information linking him to
betting on baseball.
Given that, one can only hope that
anything they say can, and will, be
taken with a grain of salt by the com
missioner's office. One also hopes that
A. Bartlett Giamatti puts aside his
personal animosity toward Rose when
making his decision on how to handle
the situation.
Back on the Farm . . . the na
tional championship watch
looks as follows:
The men's volleyball team continues
its pursuit of its first-ever national
crown behind the inspired play of Dan
Hanan.

The player-of-the-year candidate
and his mates will likely need a sweep
of many-time champion UCLA in the
coming weeks to capture the confer
ence title and earn an automatic berth
in the final four.
Even failing that, the squad seems
to have a better-than-average shot at
winning the whole enchilada. They es
pecially do if Scott Fortune rebounds
to his early-season form and re
bounder-deluxe Adam Keefe makes a
contribution on this talented, deep
squad.
The men's gymnastics team was
stellar in the recent Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships. Again, those
pesky Bruins may be the stumbling
block on the road to the promised
land. But, Conrad Voorsanger is on
a roll and this bunch could certainly
surprise.
Baseball, to paraphrase Chico
Esquela, hasn't been very, very good
at all this year. And, while my col
league Jon Weisman may be correct
in his assessment that there's no good
reason for it, the team's chances of
capturing a third-straight College
World Series unfortunately lip some
where between slim and none.
The brightest light appears to be
