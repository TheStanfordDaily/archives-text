# Crew teams host powerful opposition at rowing classic
## 
### Andrew Wilcox Staff writer 
The nation's finest crew teams
will participate in the Redwood
Shores Stanford Rowing Classic
Saturday and Sunday, to be held
at the Redwood Shores rowing fa
cility near Redwood City. The
regatta, which is hosted by the
Cardinal men's and women's crew
teams, will pit the Stanford
rowers against stiff competition.
In the opening race, the varsity
men face Harvard, last year's na
tional champion and traditionally
the cream of the crop among col
lege crews.
Although drawing the Crimson
in the opening round might seem
unlucky, Coach Ken Dreyfuss says
the team is "thrilled. Harvard
crew has set the standard for U.S.
rowing. We expect Harvard to pro
vide us a measure of how well
we've prepared for the season and
to test our concentration, will,
precision and stamina."
The Stanford women rowers are
pitted against Brown, last year's
East Coast Championship winner,
in the opening round. "We're
looking forward to racing Brown.
The kids know they can race with
these top teams," women's Coach
John Davis said.
Although Brown is one of the
nation's top crews, the Cardinal
had good luck in the draw for

first round opponents, Davis said.
This is because Brown is weaker
than several other teams in the
very strong eight-team field,
which includes Radcliffe, Wiscon
sin, Washington and Princeton.
The men's slate is impressive
as well as it includes the top four
men's crews in the nation, Har
vard, Northeastern, Brown and
Wisconsin.
Dreyfuss said that it is unusual
for the nation's top four crews to
meet in one regatta this early in
the season. "It will be exciting to
row in an event of this caliber.
This will be the best collegiate
rowing that there is," Dreyfuss
said.
The Redwood regatta features
a unique "tournament style" for
mat in which each of the eight
teams rows three head-to-head
races against another crew, ac
cording to Davis. This differs from
a regular race, in which two six
team heats are held and then a
final race.
The first round opponents are
determined by a random draw,
and in the second and third
rounds each team moves into a
winners' or losers' bracket accord
ing to the results of the opening
races.
Both the men and women's var
sity boats will race Saturday
morning in the opening round,
the women at 10:30 a.m. and the
men at 10:50 a.m.
