### Bruce Sarkisian Senior staff writer 
The last time the Stanford baseball team
lost to San Francisco was Feb. 25, 1986.
That the Dons beat the Cardinal 6-4 at
Benedetti Diamond in San Francisco yes
terday shows just how far the two-time
defending national champion Cardinal has
fallen this season.

Baseball
Dons 6, Cardinal 4

Stanford's record has now dropped to
17-22 and its chances of making postseason
play are getting slimmer and slimmer. The
Dons improved their season record to 6-16.
Yesterday's loss was similar to those the
Cardinal suffered earlier in the year, with
anemic hitting and poor defense contribu
ting to the team's woes. Stanford could
only manage five hits while committing
three errors. According to Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess, "They (USF) played a very
good game. They deserved it more than
we did."
The game moved along quickly, develop
ing into a pitching duel between Mark Car
per and USF's Greg Weiser. Carper was
touched for a single run in both the third
and fourth innings, but never let matters
get out of hand.
The Cardinal offense was slow to get off
the ground, perhaps as a result of playing
nine hours of baseball at Arizona State
Sunday and Monday. Leadoff man Frank

Carey's woes continued at the plate as he
went 0-for-4 with two walks.
Stanford finally broke through in the
sixth inning, taking advantage of Weiser's
momentary control problems. Paul Carey
walked on four pitches and Tim Griffin
walked on five. An error on Weiser's pickoff
throw to second base put Carey and Griffin
on third and second.
Left fielder Brian Johnson then came
through with a nice piece of hitting, sending
a rocket through the right side of the infield
to score Carey and Griffin.
Paul Carey helped the Cardinal score
one more in the top of the eighth when
he turned a Weiser pitch all the way around
and hit a towering shot into the street over
the right field fence. The home run, Carey's
seventh of the year, put Stanford up for
the first time, 3-2.
In the bottom of the inning, however,
the wheels began to fall off Carper's well
oiled pitching machine. He had only allowed
one hit in the three innings following the
fourth, but in the eighth he was not spot
ting his fastball as well as he had in the
early innings.
USF leadoff man Mike Campas clearly
had Carper's number as he finished the
day 3-for-4. In the eighth he hit his second
double of the day. Ron Herbert followed
with a ground ball that both shortstop
Roger Burnett and left fielder Steve
Solomon mishandled, allowing Campas to
score the tying run.
Carper then served up a high inside fast
ball to Jeff McMillan, who crushed it over
the left field fence. The Dons led
5-3, but they weren't done yet.
Marquess brought in freshman
Aaron Dorlarque to finish up the
inning, but Dorlarque could not
escape unscathed. He got two
quick outs on a fly ball and a
strikeout, but then allowed a
double and an RBI single before
striking out the final batter.
In the ninth, the Cardinal put
up a gallant fight. Stanford loaded
the bases with one out after David
McCarty and Burnett singled and
Frank Carey walked. David
Holbrook's fly ball put the Cardi
nal within two, but Paul Carey,
who had reached base in his pre
vious four at bats, grounded out
to end the game.
At this point, Stanford has to
win almost all of its remaining
games to make the playoffs, but
Marquess is not looking that far
ahead. When asked what the best
thing the Cardinal could do this
weekend at USC, he replied, "to
win a game."
