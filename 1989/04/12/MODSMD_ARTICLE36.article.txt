# Club Sports Roundup
## Ruggers win two of three matches 
### Libby Feil Staff writer 
The Stanford men's rugby
team finished off their season
last weekend by competing well
at regionals in Tucson, Ariz. Al
though the team is now out of
the running for nationals, the
ruggers won two out of their
three games and returned home
with the consolation champion
ship and fifth place in their
league.
The Cardinal's first game was
Friday against Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo. The final score of 19-13
in Cal Poly-SLO's favor does not
reflect the valiant effort that the
Cardinal made to rally in the
second half. Stanford was losing
16-0 at halflime. "They were kil
ling us," club president Marty
Hartigan said.
But then the Cardinal man
aged to make the score close.
The players "just basically ran
out of time," Hartigan said. Un
fortunately, though, this loss
eliminated Stanford from na
tionals contention.
The team did continue to play.
The ruggers' next game was

team failed to qualify for the national tournament.
against Washington, the cham
pion of the Pacific Northwest di
vision. Because of the tough effort
they put in, the Stanford players
won against Washington, 15-12.
Hartigan attributed much of
the credit to the backs. "Our back
line was really the key to our
game." Both Will Wall and Simon
Fleming-Wood scored tries and
played well.
The Cardinal's last opponent
was San Diego State. A perenni
ally strong team, San Diego State
had been national champion two
years ago. That fact made Stan
ford's 19-0 win extremely satisfy
ing. "It was a convincing victory,"
rejoiced Hartigan. The entire back
line had a good game.
Despite not winning regionals,
the Stanford team was satisfied
with its season, which was much
improved over last year. As Har
tigan summed it up, "All in all,
we were pretty pleased with the
way we finished."
Overall team victory
evades Card cyclists
"We thought we did well, but
everyone else did better."
Thus did cycling captain Steve
Miller sum up the individual time

trial in which the cycling team
participated at UCLA last week
end.
Fortunately, in the road race
and criterium events later that
weekend the Cardinal was more
competitive. The team is also
looking forward to competing this
coming weekend in its own races.
The first race scheduled for the
weekend was a short, 12.3-mile
individual time trial over rolling
hills. Although a few individual
Stanford riders fared well, the
placings were not enough to give
the team as a whole a much
needed overall victory.
The highlights of the time trial
were the men's and women's B
races and the men's C race. Stan
ford cyclist Ken Zimmerman shat
tered the B field as usual, pound
ing his way to a victory in his
category with a time that would
have earned him second place in
the A category as well.
"Ken is just pretty much pick
ing between first and second in
all his races now," Miller said.
In addition, Cardinal riders Jon
Kaplan and Vit Henisz came in
seventh and 10th in the B field.
Stanford team member Steph
anie Page scorched the field in
the women's B field with a final
time that was over a minute faster
than that of any of her com
petitiors. Cardinal cyclist Becky
Wigglesworth also did well, com

ing in fourth in the B division.
The men's C division also be
came a high point for the Cardi
nal. Stanford rider Hank Dart
turned in a third place in this
category.
The road race, scheduled for
later that day, was delayed for
two hours due to a brush fire
near the course which under
scored the day's heat. Despite the
high temperatures, many Cardi
nal riders placed well in the short
hill climb that constituted the
road race. However, these
placings were again not enough
to give the Cardinal an overall
win.
The best Stanford placings in
the road race were found in the
men's A and B fields. The A's
"boogied" in the hillclimb, Miller
said, with Miller placing fifth and
Jason Tavakolian placing 20th.
Stanford rider Zimmerman
again raced well, taking second in
the final sprint. Teammates Brian
Sterling and Kaplan finished
fourth and sixth, respectively.
The criterium the next day,
however, was "where we started
to win," Miller said. The tricky
course featured a slightly off
camber, uphill turn at the bottom
of a gradual descent. Miller said
that the tightness of the turn
meant that "on every prime lap
someone crashed, basically." How
ever, most of the Stanford riders
managed to avoid taking a spill.

T ie Cardinal ended up with the
overall victory for the day with a
large point margin between it and
the runner-up, UCLA.
The day started well for the
Cardinal with the D race. Novice
riders Ben Dugan and Sean Fot
trell took advantage of the chance
to show off their teamwork.
Dugan gave Fottrell a leadout,
which Fottrell used to take first
place. In the next event, the C
race, Cardinal Scott Evans came
in fourth.
The Stanford riders worked
well together in the men's B race
as well. Zimmerman again came
in second, with the help of team
mates Sterling and Henisz.
The men's A race was where
Stanford scored most of its points.
The course was characterized by
a very short sprint out of a tight
corner, so the Stanford men knew
that they would have to be at the
front of the pack coming out of
the turn in order to win. "We set
up for the end really well," said
Miller.
In addition to scoring scads of
prime points, five Stanford riders
placed. Coulter Richardson
sprinted to first, with teammate
Tom Moyer right on his wheel for
a 1-2 Stanford finish. Tavakolian,
Miller and Art Walker finished up
in eighth, 11th and 13th places.
The team is currently preparing
for the races it will be hosting
this coming weekend. A team time

trial and road race will be held
Saturday on a course near San
Jose. On Sunday a fast-paced cri
terium will be held near Encina
Gym on campus, with the start
finish line on Arguello Street. The
first men's race will be at 9 a.m.
and the first women's race at 9:50
a.m.
Equestrians qualify
for national tourney
Stanford's equestrian team
competed in regionals last week
end and qualified a total of thir
teen riders for nationals in Mount
Holyoke, Massachusetts. The
regionals were held at Rancho
Murieta, near Sacramento.
The equestrian team at Stan
ford is actually a member of two
"leagues": the Intercollegiate
Horse Show Association, which is
a national organization, and the
West Coast IHSA. The regionals
last weekend were those of the
national organization.
The team had to overcome a
few obstacles as it attempted to
qualify riders for nationals. The
sweltering valley heat, com
pounded by the scarcity of trees
at Rancho Murieta, made both the
riders and the horses uncomfort
able.
In addition, the riders were not
necessarily riding their own
horses. Each rider had to draw
for a horse provided by the hosting
school. This method of choosing
horses is "a different test of horse
manship," rider Gwyn Gordon
said.
Despite these hardships, the
Cardinal qualified as a team in

addition to qualifying several in
dividual riders. Stanford riders
Brandyn Chriswell, Gordon,
Bridget Larson, Josie Alexander,
Courtney Guest, Julie Packard,
David Nix and Hima Vatty all
qualified for nationals as a team.
In addition, Chriswell, Gordon,
Guest, Packard, Nix and Emma
Hughes also qualified as individ
uals.
Hockey concludes
season at regionals
The Stanford ice hockey team
attended regionals in Los Angeles
last weekend and returned home
with third place for the season.
The Cardinal played Cal State-
Northridge and USC with mixed
results.
"The Northridge game was
tough," club treasurer David
Shapiro said. "The first period we
were kinda slow coming out."
The Cardinal paid for its slug
gishness by losing the match, 2-0.
"Northridge was a defensive bat
tle," said Shapiro.
Stanford depended heavily on
its third line — Brian Gaines,
Tom Smith and David Shapiro
— to tire the opponent out, and
credit lies with them as well as
with goalie Chick Webb for
keeping Northridge to only two
goals.
The Cardinal's second game
was against USC. This time Stan
ford was the victor, beating the
Trojans 3-1. Stanford's first line
of Jenko Hwong, David Wright
and Tim Westergren was crucial
as was second-line player Bob
Carpenter.

Jason Tavakolian placing 20th.
Stanford rider Zimmerman
again raced well, taking second in
the final sprint. Teammates Brian
Sterling and Kaplan finished
fourth and sixth, respectively.
The criterium the next day,
however, was "where we started
to win," Miller said. The tricky
course featured a slightly off
camber, uphill turn at the bottom
of a gradual descent. Miller said
that the tightness of the turn
meant that "on every prime lap
someone crashed, basically." How
ever, most of the Stanford riders
managed to avoid taking a spill.

T ie Cardinal ended up with the
overall victory for the day with a
large point margin between it and
the runner-up, UCLA.
The day started well for the
Cardinal with the D race. Novice
riders Ben Dugan and Sean Fot
trell took advantage of the chance
to show off their teamwork.
Dugan gave Fottrell a leadout,
which Fottrell used to take first
place. In the next event, the C
race, Cardinal Scott Evans came
in fourth.
The Stanford riders worked
well together in the men's B race
as well. Zimmerman again came
in second, with the help of team
mates Sterling and Henisz.
The men's A race was where
Stanford scored most of its points.
The course was characterized by
a very short sprint out of a tight
corner, so the Stanford men knew
that they would have to be at the
front of the pack coming out of
the turn in order to win. "We set
up for the end really well," said
Miller.
In addition to scoring scads of
prime points, five Stanford riders
placed. Coulter Richardson
sprinted to first, with teammate
Tom Moyer right on his wheel for
a 1-2 Stanford finish. Tavakolian,
Miller and Art Walker finished up
in eighth, 11th and 13th places.
The team is currently preparing
for the races it will be hosting
this coming weekend. A team time

trial and road race will be held
Saturday on a course near San
Jose. On Sunday a fast-paced cri
terium will be held near Encina
Gym on campus, with the start
finish line on Arguello Street. The
first men's race will be at 9 a.m.
and the first women's race at 9:50
a.m.
Equestrians qualify
for national tourney
Stanford's equestrian team
competed in regionals last week
end and qualified a total of thir
teen riders for nationals in Mount
Holyoke, Massachusetts. The
regionals were held at Rancho
Murieta, near Sacramento.
The equestrian team at Stan
ford is actually a member of two
"leagues": the Intercollegiate
Horse Show Association, which is
a national organization, and the
West Coast IHSA. The regionals
last weekend were those of the
national organization.
The team had to overcome a
few obstacles as it attempted to
qualify riders for nationals. The
sweltering valley heat, com
pounded by the scarcity of trees
at Rancho Murieta, made both the
riders and the horses uncomfort
able.
In addition, the riders were not
necessarily riding their own
horses. Each rider had to draw
for a horse provided by the hosting
school. This method of choosing
horses is "a different test of horse
manship," rider Gwyn Gordon
said.
Despite these hardships, the
Cardinal qualified as a team in

addition to qualifying several in
dividual riders. Stanford riders
Brandyn Chriswell, Gordon,
Bridget Larson, Josie Alexander,
Courtney Guest, Julie Packard,
David Nix and Hima Vatty all
qualified for nationals as a team.
In addition, Chriswell, Gordon,
Guest, Packard, Nix and Emma
Hughes also qualified as individ
uals.
Hockey concludes
season at regionals
The Stanford ice hockey team
attended regionals in Los Angeles
last weekend and returned home
with third place for the season.
The Cardinal played Cal State-
Northridge and USC with mixed
results.
"The Northridge game was
tough," club treasurer David
Shapiro said. "The first period we
were kinda slow coming out."
The Cardinal paid for its slug
gishness by losing the match, 2-0.
"Northridge was a defensive bat
tle," said Shapiro.
Stanford depended heavily on
its third line — Brian Gaines,
Tom Smith and David Shapiro
— to tire the opponent out, and
credit lies with them as well as
with goalie Chick Webb for
keeping Northridge to only two
goals.
The Cardinal's second game
was against USC. This time Stan
ford was the victor, beating the
Trojans 3-1. Stanford's first line
of Jenko Hwong, David Wright
and Tim Westergren was crucial
as was second-line player Bob
Carpenter.
The Stanford men's rugby
team finished off their season
last weekend by competing well
at regionals in Tucson, Ariz. Al
though the team is now out of
the running for nationals, the
ruggers won two out of their
three games and returned home
with the consolation champion
ship and fifth place in their
league.
The Cardinal's first game was
Friday against Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo. The final score of 19-13
in Cal Poly-SLO's favor does not
reflect the valiant effort that the
Cardinal made to rally in the
second half. Stanford was losing
16-0 at halflime. "They were kil
ling us," club president Marty
Hartigan said.
But then the Cardinal man
aged to make the score close.
The players "just basically ran
out of time," Hartigan said. Un
fortunately, though, this loss
eliminated Stanford from na
tionals contention.
The team did continue to play.
The ruggers' next game was


Damlan Marhefka — Dally file
In spite of winning two of three games at last weekend's regionals In Tempe, Ariz., the rugby
team failed to qualify for the national tournament.
against Washington, the cham
pion of the Pacific Northwest di
vision. Because of the tough effort
they put in, the Stanford players
won against Washington, 15-12.
Hartigan attributed much of
the credit to the backs. "Our back
line was really the key to our
game." Both Will Wall and Simon
Fleming-Wood scored tries and
played well.
The Cardinal's last opponent
was San Diego State. A perenni
ally strong team, San Diego State
had been national champion two
years ago. That fact made Stan
ford's 19-0 win extremely satisfy
ing. "It was a convincing victory,"
rejoiced Hartigan. The entire back
line had a good game.
Despite not winning regionals,
the Stanford team was satisfied
with its season, which was much
improved over last year. As Har
tigan summed it up, "All in all,
we were pretty pleased with the
way we finished."
Overall team victory
evades Card cyclists
"We thought we did well, but
everyone else did better."
Thus did cycling captain Steve
Miller sum up the individual time

trial in which the cycling team
participated at UCLA last week
end.
Fortunately, in the road race
and criterium events later that
weekend the Cardinal was more
competitive. The team is also
looking forward to competing this
coming weekend in its own races.
The first race scheduled for the
weekend was a short, 12.3-mile
individual time trial over rolling
hills. Although a few individual
Stanford riders fared well, the
placings were not enough to give
the team as a whole a much
needed overall victory.
The highlights of the time trial
were the men's and women's B
races and the men's C race. Stan
ford cyclist Ken Zimmerman shat
tered the B field as usual, pound
ing his way to a victory in his
category with a time that would
have earned him second place in
the A category as well.
"Ken is just pretty much pick
ing between first and second in
all his races now," Miller said.
In addition, Cardinal riders Jon
Kaplan and Vit Henisz came in
seventh and 10th in the B field.
Stanford team member Steph
anie Page scorched the field in
the women's B field with a final
time that was over a minute faster
than that of any of her com
petitiors. Cardinal cyclist Becky
Wigglesworth also did well, com

ing in fourth in the B division.
The men's C division also be
came a high point for the Cardi
nal. Stanford rider Hank Dart
turned in a third place in this
category.
The road race, scheduled for
later that day, was delayed for
two hours due to a brush fire
near the course which under
scored the day's heat. Despite the
high temperatures, many Cardi
nal riders placed well in the short
hill climb that constituted the
road race. However, these
placings were again not enough
to give the Cardinal an overall
win.
The best Stanford placings in
the road race were found in the
men's A and B fields. The A's
"boogied" in the hillclimb, Miller
said, with Miller placing fifth and
Jason Tavakolian placing 20th.
Stanford rider Zimmerman
again raced well, taking second in
the final sprint. Teammates Brian
Sterling and Kaplan finished
fourth and sixth, respectively.

with goalie Chick Webb for
keeping Northridge to only two
goals.
The Cardinal's second game
was against USC. This time Stan
ford was the victor, beating the
Trojans 3-1. Stanford's first line
of Jenko Hwong, David Wright
and Tim Westergren was crucial
as was second-line player Bob
Carpenter.
The Stanford men's rugby
team finished off their season
last weekend by competing well
at regionals in Tucson, Ariz. Al
though the team is now out of
the running for nationals, the
ruggers won two out of their
three games and returned home
with the consolation champion
ship and fifth place in their
league.
The Cardinal's first game was
Friday against Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo. The final score of 19-13
in Cal Poly-SLO's favor does not
reflect the valiant effort that the
Cardinal made to rally in the
second half. Stanford was losing
16-0 at halflime. "They were kil
ling us," club president Marty
Hartigan said.
But then the Cardinal man
aged to make the score close.
The players "just basically ran
out of time," Hartigan said. Un
fortunately, though, this loss
eliminated Stanford from na
tionals contention.
The team did continue to play.
The ruggers' next game was

In spite of winning two of three games at last weekend's regionals In Tempe, Ariz., the rugby
team failed to qualify for the national tournament.
against Washington, the cham
pion of the Pacific Northwest di
vision. Because of the tough effort
they put in, the Stanford players
won against Washington, 15-12.
Hartigan attributed much of
the credit to the backs. "Our back
line was really the key to our
game." Both Will Wall and Simon
Fleming-Wood scored tries and
played well.
The Cardinal's last opponent
was San Diego State. A perenni
ally strong team, San Diego State
had been national champion two
years ago. That fact made Stan
ford's 19-0 win extremely satisfy
ing. "It was a convincing victory,"
rejoiced Hartigan. The entire back
line had a good game.
Despite not winning regionals,
the Stanford team was satisfied
with its season, which was much
improved over last year. As Har
tigan summed it up, "All in all,
we were pretty pleased with the
way we finished."
Overall team victory
evades Card cyclists
"We thought we did well, but
everyone else did better."
Thus did cycling captain Steve
Miller sum up the individual time

trial in which the cycling team
participated at UCLA last week
end.
Fortunately, in the road race
and criterium events later that
weekend the Cardinal was more
competitive. The team is also
looking forward to competing this
coming weekend in its own races.
The first race scheduled for the
weekend was a short, 12.3-mile
individual time trial over rolling
hills. Although a few individual
Stanford riders fared well, the
placings were not enough to give
the team as a whole a much
needed overall victory.
The highlights of the time trial
were the men's and women's B
races and the men's C race. Stan
ford cyclist Ken Zimmerman shat
tered the B field as usual, pound
ing his way to a victory in his
category with a time that would
have earned him second place in
the A category as well.
"Ken is just pretty much pick
ing between first and second in
all his races now," Miller said.
In addition, Cardinal riders Jon
Kaplan and Vit Henisz came in
seventh and 10th in the B field.
Stanford team member Steph
anie Page scorched the field in
the women's B field with a final
time that was over a minute faster
than that of any of her com
petitiors. Cardinal cyclist Becky
Wigglesworth also did well, com

ing in fourth in the B division.
The men's C division also be
came a high point for the Cardi
nal. Stanford rider Hank Dart
turned in a third place in this
category.
The road race, scheduled for
later that day, was delayed for
two hours due to a brush fire
near the course which under
scored the day's heat. Despite the
high temperatures, many Cardi
nal riders placed well in the short
hill climb that constituted the
road race. However, these
placings were again not enough
to give the Cardinal an overall
win.
The best Stanford placings in
the road race were found in the
men's A and B fields. The A's
"boogied" in the hillclimb, Miller
said, with Miller placing fifth and
Jason Tavakolian placing 20th.
Stanford rider Zimmerman
again raced well, taking second in
the final sprint. Teammates Brian
Sterling and Kaplan finished
fourth and sixth, respectively.
The criterium the next day,
however, was "where we started
to win," Miller said. The tricky
course featured a slightly off
camber, uphill turn at the bottom
of a gradual descent. Miller said
that the tightness of the turn
meant that "on every prime lap
someone crashed, basically." How
ever, most of the Stanford riders
managed to avoid taking a spill.

T ie Cardinal ended up with the
overall victory for the day with a
large point margin between it and
the runner-up, UCLA.
The day started well for the
Cardinal with the D race. Novice
riders Ben Dugan and Sean Fot
trell took advantage of the chance
to show off their teamwork.
Dugan gave Fottrell a leadout,
which Fottrell used to take first
place. In the next event, the C
race, Cardinal Scott Evans came
in fourth.
The Stanford riders worked
well together in the men's B race
as well. Zimmerman again came
in second, with the help of team
mates Sterling and Henisz.
The men's A race was where
Stanford scored most of its points.
The course was characterized by
a very short sprint out of a tight
corner, so the Stanford men knew
that they would have to be at the
front of the pack coming out of
the turn in order to win. "We set
up for the end really well," said
Miller.
In addition to scoring scads of
prime points, five Stanford riders
placed. Coulter Richardson
sprinted to first, with teammate
Tom Moyer right on his wheel for
a 1-2 Stanford finish. Tavakolian,
Miller and Art Walker finished up
in eighth, 11th and 13th places.
The team is currently preparing
for the races it will be hosting
this coming weekend. A team time

trial and road race will be held
Saturday on a course near San
Jose. On Sunday a fast-paced cri
terium will be held near Encina
Gym on campus, with the start
finish line on Arguello Street. The
first men's race will be at 9 a.m.
and the first women's race at 9:50
a.m.
Equestrians qualify
for national tourney
Stanford's equestrian team
competed in regionals last week
end and qualified a total of thir
teen riders for nationals in Mount
Holyoke, Massachusetts. The
regionals were held at Rancho
Murieta, near Sacramento.
The equestrian team at Stan
ford is actually a member of two
"leagues": the Intercollegiate
Horse Show Association, which is
a national organization, and the
West Coast IHSA. The regionals
last weekend were those of the
national organization.
The team had to overcome a
few obstacles as it attempted to
qualify riders for nationals. The
sweltering valley heat, com
pounded by the scarcity of trees
at Rancho Murieta, made both the
riders and the horses uncomfort
able.
In addition, the riders were not
necessarily riding their own
horses. Each rider had to draw
for a horse provided by the hosting
school. This method of choosing
horses is "a different test of horse
manship," rider Gwyn Gordon
said.
Despite these hardships, the
Cardinal qualified as a team in

addition to qualifying several in
dividual riders. Stanford riders
Brandyn Chriswell, Gordon,
Bridget Larson, Josie Alexander,
Courtney Guest, Julie Packard,
David Nix and Hima Vatty all
qualified for nationals as a team.
In addition, Chriswell, Gordon,
Guest, Packard, Nix and Emma
Hughes also qualified as individ
uals.
Hockey concludes
season at regionals
The Stanford ice hockey team
attended regionals in Los Angeles
last weekend and returned home
with third place for the season.
The Cardinal played Cal State-
Northridge and USC with mixed
results.
"The Northridge game was
tough," club treasurer David
Shapiro said. "The first period we
were kinda slow coming out."
The Cardinal paid for its slug
gishness by losing the match, 2-0.
"Northridge was a defensive bat
tle," said Shapiro.
Stanford depended heavily on
its third line — Brian Gaines,
Tom Smith and David Shapiro
— to tire the opponent out, and
credit lies with them as well as
with goalie Chick Webb for
keeping Northridge to only two
goals.
The Cardinal's second game
was against USC. This time Stan
ford was the victor, beating the
Trojans 3-1. Stanford's first line
of Jenko Hwong, David Wright
and Tim Westergren was crucial
as was second-line player Bob
Carpenter.
