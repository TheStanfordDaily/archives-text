# Women netters to face California today
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Two years ago, the New York
Mcts lost all five of their start
ing pitchers to injury for
prolonged periods of time. It is
common knowledge that those
injuries cost the Mets a chance
to repeat as World Champions.
The Stanford women's tennis
team has resembled those 1987
New Yorkers this season. Ail-
Americans Tami Whitlinger,
Sandra Birch and Eleni Rossides
have all missed matches due to
injuries. Freshman Kylie
Johnson has as well.
But, the three-time defending
NCAA champs have shown
themselves more than able to
overcome those ailments, com
piling a 20-0 record thus far
(6-0 in Pacific 10 Conference
play).
That ability to overcome ad
versity was best exemplified
Saturday when Whitlinger, bat

tling a bad case of the stomach
flu, came back from 5-1 in the
third set to beat Trisha Laux
and help lead the Cardinal to a
6-3 victory over USC.
If that's not enough bad news
for today's opponent, California,
"Tami is better," Coach Frank
Brennan said.
"She played [yesterday] and
played very well in fact," he
added.
Johnson, however, has not re
covered as well from a respira
tory problem. "She's a little un
der the weather," Brennan said.
Even if Johnson is unable to
play, Stanford may have an ace
in the hole in Rossides. Out for

several weeks with injuries, Ros
sides may return to the lineup.
When healthy, she is one of the
finest players in the country.
The Golden Bears counter
with a couple stars of their own.
Senior Karen Shin plays No. 1
for California and is ranked
seventh in the country. Right
behind her is Lisa Albano, one
of the nation's top freshman,
who is ranked ninth.
The Cardinal, however, has an
excellent freshman of its own in
Debbie Graham. The 6-foot,
serve-and-volley wizard has won
all 20 of her matches this year
and is rated No. 2 in the latest
poll.
