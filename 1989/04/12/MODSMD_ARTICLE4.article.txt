# Students at odds with budgeting, poll shows
## 
### Baldwin Lee Staff writer 
An ASSU Council of Presidents survey
released yesterday reveals major disparities
between student and University budget
priorities.
According to the results, students ranked
undergraduate scholarships, undergradu
ate housing and teaching assistants in the
School of Humanities and Sciences as the
top three budget priorities, in that order.
The University dropped undergraduate
housing from its list of Centennial Cam
paign fundraising priorities Feb. 9.
Students placed landscaping and admin
istration buildings at the bottom of the
list, which included a total of 23 budget
items.
The ASSU distributed about 5,000 sur
veys to all of the undergraduate dormitories
and 1,200 undergraduates returned the
surveys, in which they ranked their top 10
budget priorities. The survey required
about 80 hours of work.
University administrators in charge of
budgeting will respond to the survey's
results tomorrow in a meeting with campus
media, student government leaders and mi
nority community leaders.
John Wirth, associate provost of Plan
ning and Management, said the Centennial

Campaign, which raises money for specific
areas of improvement, already includes
eight of the top 10 student priorities listed
in the survey as targets for funding. Al
though the Campaign does not specifically
mention some of the students' top
priorities, such as funding for TAs and the
Human Biology Department, these needs
are included in more broadly defined
categories, according to Wirth.
However, Wirth acknowleged that the
Centennial Campaign does not cover in
creased funds for undergraduate housing
and an expansion of the multicultural cur
riculum.
In other survey questions, 82.3 percent
of those surveyed answered no to the ques
tion, "Do you feel the 8 percent tuition
rise for 1989-90 is justified?" And 12.7
percent said this rise will threaten their
ability to stay in school. And 90.8 percent
of students said the administration should
do more to address the problem of under
graduate housing.
Wirth said the administration is aware
of the lack of guaranteed housing for un
dergraduates and the need for improve
ments to already existing facilities —
Wirth's son lived in Manzanita Park —
but said donors have not shown enough
support for undergraduate
housing improvements.
According to Wirth, the unex
pected rennovation needs of Roble
Hall, which was declared seismi
cally unsafe in 1987, have
depleted the housing budget. He
added that new housing needs are
not being ignored, but only tem
porarily deferred.
In addition to housing concerns,
the survey showed that students
ranked multicultural issues
among their top 10 priorities.
Wirth explained that when Cen
tennial fund raising began in
1984, multicultural issues were
not popular. As a result, when the
committee mapped out the Cam
paign priorities, it did not include
these areas.
Worth pointed out that neither
the Cultures, Ideas and Values
debate nor the University Com
mittee on Minority Issues report
existed when the Campaign
began.
ASSU Council of Presidents

member David Brown, a junior,
said the survey emphasized the
inability of students to affect Uni
versity budget priorities.
Although Brown and other stu
dent representatives serve on all
Board of Trustee committees as
observers, Brown said the com
mittees have no role in determin
ing budget priorities. The com
mittees are essentially "a rubber
stamp," he said.
Wirth said two student repre
sentatives have been on the Fac
ulty Senate Oversight Committee

regarding the Centennial Cam
paign since the committee was
formed. "The channels for access
are there, the issue is whether
student commitment to issues is
there," he said.
Brown said students have only
two of about 20 votes, further
diluting student influence in set
ting budget priorities. The admin
istration creates the facade that
students can affect budgetary de
cisions while actually disem
powering students, Brown
charged.
