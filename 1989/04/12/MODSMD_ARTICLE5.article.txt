### Suzanne Corkins 
In what may be the start of
a disturbing trend, three chil
den in Escondido Village have
been approached by uniden
tified men while playing alone
in an outdoor area of the
housing complex.
These reports have genera
ted enough concern among res
idents that Escondido Village
Director Jean Kim has organ
ized a meeting in order to in
form parents of the problem
and of the need to advise their
children to promptly report
such occurrences.
The meeting will take place
tomorrow at 7 p.m. at the Cot
tage Room in Escondido Vil
lage.
The incidents have all oc
curred since Thursday and two
were reported to the Stanford

Police. All of the episodes took
place in the Increment 5 neigh
borhood of Escondido.
The police received the first
report Thursday at 3 p.m., al
most immediately following the
incident. A 7-year-old girl at a
neighborhood playground was
approached by an unknown
man who asked to play with
her.
The suspect is described as
a white male in his 20s who is
about 5-foot-8, of medium
build and has dark hair. He
was wearing green running
shorts and a white T-shirt. Ac
cording to residents, another
unreported incident occurred
the same day, this one involv
ing a 4-year-old girl. In both
cases, the children escaped the
suspect without harm.
