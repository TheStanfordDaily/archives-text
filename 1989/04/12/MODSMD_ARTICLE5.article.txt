### Suzanne Corkins 
In what may be the start of
a disturbing trend, three chil
den in Escondido Village have
been approached by uniden
tified men while playing alone
in an outdoor area of the
housing complex.
These reports have genera
ted enough concern among res
idents that Escondido Village
Director Jean Kim has organ
ized a meeting in order to in
form parents of the problem
and of the need to advise their
children to promptly report
such occurrences.
The meeting will take place
tomorrow at 7 p.m. at the Cot
tage Room in Escondido Vil
lage.
The incidents have all oc
curred since Thursday and two
were reported to the Stanford

Police. All of the episodes took
place in the Increment 5 neigh
borhood of Escondido.
The police received the first
report Thursday at 3 p.m., al
most immediately following the
incident. A 7-year-old girl at a
neighborhood playground was
approached by an unknown
man who asked to play with
her.
The suspect is described as
a white male in his 20s who is
about 5-foot-8, of medium
build and has dark hair. He
was wearing green running
shorts and a white T-shirt. Ac
cording to residents, another
unreported incident occurred
the same day, this one involv
ing a 4-year-old girl. In both
cases, the children escaped the
suspect without harm.
It is not known whether the
two incidents are related.
A third instance of such activity
took place 3:30 p.m. Monday and
was reported to the police at 6
o'clock that evening. This encoun
ter involved an 8-year-old boy who
was approached by a different man
and asked to follow him to a
nearby car for a drive.
This suspect is said to be an
Asian male, approximately 40
years old, 5-8 to 5-10, heavy-set,
with a moustache. He was
wearing a white shirt and brown
dress pants. Although he ap
proached the child on foot, he
referred to a white sports car
when speaking to the child.
The Stanford Police are com
piling a flier with descriptions of
the suspects to be distributed at
the meeting Thursday night and
delivered to Escondido residents'
doors on Friday morning.
Anyone with any information
about these events can call the
Stanford Police at 723-9633.
