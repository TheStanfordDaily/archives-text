What got one Stanford Trustee
into trouble in the Soviet Union
two years ago won her an award
back home.
Jean Enersen Skinner, a
reporter and anchor with KING
TV in Seattle, attracted the un
favorable eye of the Soviet gov
ernment when she attempted to
deliver a commentary in the So
viet Union — directly to the So
viet people — comparing the
U.S.S.R.'s experience in Afghani
stan to the United States' in Viet
nam.
Skinner was the first American
journalist to do a series of live,
supposedly uncensored commen
tary over Soviet airwaves. Though
one of her reports ultimately was
censored by the government, she
won a prestigious American jour
nalism award for the series.
The experience is one of many

which Skinner recalls over two
decades in broadcast journalism.
A Stanford graduate and a trustee
for the past four years, she has
had a staying power and breadth
of experience in her field many
local TV reporters would long for.
A Peninsula native, Skinner
was born in San Mateo but grew
up in Seattle and has spent most
of her life there. After attending
Pomona College and the Univer
sity of Washington, she trans
ferred to Stanford her junior year
to pursue a degree in political sci
ence.
"Stanford had a tremendous na
tional reputation, as it has an in
ternational reputation now," she
said. "I had always liked Califor
nia, and the Political Science De
partment had some of the best
scholars around."
Skinner briefly wrote for The
Daily and some student magazines
while on campus, but her real
interest was in politics.
She participated in Stanford's
program in Washington, D.C.
where she worked for two
senators before receiving her un
dergraduate degree in 1966. She

then stayed on to get master's
degrees in political science and
broadcast/film.
Under fellowships from West
inghouse and the National Asso
ciation of Broadcasters, she con
tinued her research, hoping to get
