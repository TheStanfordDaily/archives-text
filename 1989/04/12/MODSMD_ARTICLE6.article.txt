Editor's note: This is the first in

What got one Stanford Trustee
into trouble in the Soviet Union
two years ago won her an award
back home.
Jean Enersen Skinner, a
reporter and anchor with KING
TV in Seattle, attracted the un
favorable eye of the Soviet gov
ernment when she attempted to
deliver a commentary in the So
viet Union — directly to the So
viet people — comparing the
U.S.S.R.'s experience in Afghani
stan to the United States' in Viet
nam.
Skinner was the first American
journalist to do a series of live,
supposedly uncensored commen
tary over Soviet airwaves. Though
one of her reports ultimately was
censored by the government, she
won a prestigious American jour
nalism award for the series.
The experience is one of many

which Skinner recalls over two
decades in broadcast journalism.
A Stanford graduate and a trustee
for the past four years, she has
had a staying power and breadth
of experience in her field many
local TV reporters would long for.
A Peninsula native, Skinner
was born in San Mateo but grew
up in Seattle and has spent most
of her life there. After attending
Pomona College and the Univer
sity of Washington, she trans
ferred to Stanford her junior year
to pursue a degree in political sci
ence.
"Stanford had a tremendous na
tional reputation, as it has an in
ternational reputation now," she
said. "I had always liked Califor
nia, and the Political Science De
partment had some of the best
scholars around."
Skinner briefly wrote for The
Daily and some student magazines
while on campus, but her real
interest was in politics.
She participated in Stanford's
program in Washington, D.C.
where she worked for two
senators before receiving her un
dergraduate degree in 1966. She

then stayed on to get master's
degrees in political science and
broadcast/film.
Under fellowships from West
inghouse and the National Asso
ciation of Broadcasters, she con
tinued her research, hoping to get

a Ph.D. in political science. But
the Defense Department, which
was also funding some of her re
search, canceled projects in the
face of Vietnam protests and left
Skinner strapped for money.
"I had really wanted to teach,
but I had to get a job," she said.
So Skinner left Stanford and,
using her contacts in the Com
munication Department, landed a
job as a night associate producer
at KPIX-TV in San Francisco.
Though she hadn't seriously con
sidered broadcasting as a career,
her early stories — including a
nighttime Black Panther rally in
Oakland — hooked her.
She soon proceeded to KING
TV, and 20 years later she's still
there. She has also devoted more
and more of her extra time to
Stanford.
"I've wanted to give something
back to the institution because it
did a lot for me," she said. "It

provided me with some pivotal op
portunities."
In addition to serving on the
Finance and Administration com
mittee on the Board of Trustees,
Skinner is involved in career
counseling for students and has
focused her involvement on un
dergraduate education.
Skinner has also spearheaded
an effort in her own company to
woo Stanford students into TV
journalism. Getting the best new
talent, she said, will make or break
her station. .
"We don't just need good stu
dents in teaching and in law; we
really need them in broadcasting,
too," she said.
Meanwhile, her own profes
sional work has taken her to
China and Japan, countries of
growing political and economic
importance to the Pacific North
west. Three years ago, just as the
Soviet Union was beginning to
open up to the West, she traveled
to there for the first time.
Her first project was called Face
to Face, in which she and her
crew followed an American family
and a Soviet family as they intro

duced each other to their homes
and native countries. For another
project, she moderated a discus
sion in which American and Soviet
students asked each other ques
tions on TV, live via satellite.
Her live commentary to the So
viet people was a turning point
in media relations with the Soviet
government. Though the govern
ment violated its promise not to
censor her comments, she said it
"wasn't quite time yet" for the
Soviets to confront Afghanistan.
In the end, the experience
forged an important new relation
ship with the Soviets, for "Amer
icans are now being invited there
by the score," she said.
Lasting 20 years at one station
is no small feat, but Skinner
credits a company interested not
just in ratings, but in putting on
good programs.
She said she's content in her
job for now and is busy planning
her next project, which will focus
on America's working poor. Off
in the future, she added, that
teaching job just may loom.
