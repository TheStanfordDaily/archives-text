### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Board of Trustees
yesterday approved next year's
operating budget with a $2 million
deficit, the first such shortfall
since 1977.
First presented by Provost
James Rosse to the Faculty Senate
last Thursday, the budget sets
1989-90 operating expenses at
$386.5 million, an 8.8 percent in
crease over this year.
The deficit, estimated at $14
million in January, was slashed

to $2 million through a combina
tion of measures including a 8
percent undergraduate tuition in
crease, cuts in library purchases
and reductions in planned salary
and benefit increases for staff.
Budget Director Tim Warner
said the deficit may be reduced
during the course of the year if
limited, one-time income sources
totaling $1.5 million come
through.
The board also approved the es
tablishment of three endowed
professorships, two in engineering
and one in public service.
