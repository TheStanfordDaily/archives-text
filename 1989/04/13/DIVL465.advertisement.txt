/fas Capitalism won the Cold War?
Merger mania: has it helped? hurt? whom?
Is Wall Street dysfunctional? ethical?
Come and lock horns with one of Wall Street's best,
HERBERT ALLEN, JR.
President, Allen & Company, New York
Monday, April 17 • 5:30 p.m.
Schiff House Lounge • Sterling Quad • Governor's Corner
Herbert Allen. Jr., controversial young maverick Wall Street financier, Democrat Party benefactor
and former Columbia Pictures Chairman, will visit campus for a rough-and-tumble,
knock-down-drag-em-out open-ended discussion/debate with students. Mr. Allen's exploits in
investment finance (he engineered the headline-grabbing sale of Columbia Pictures to Coca-Cola)
and candor in business and politics have created a deluge of press coverage in his wake. Come
over to Schiff for spirited discussion and a no-holds-barrred exchange of views with this
gregarious capitalist.
