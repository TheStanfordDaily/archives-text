In 1981, John Morrison-a British professor-became
fascinated by the idea of reconstructing a full-scale replica
of the Ancient Greek warship, the Trireme. Today, a
beautiful Trireme is sailing in the Aegean, rowed by
students, veteran oarspeople, and enthusiasts from all over
the world, including the Bay Area.
Come hear him on his dream of building this great
ship, and see his slides of the project, plus video of the
actual sailing of the vessel.
