We're Finnigan MAT, for over 21 years the world's leader in
developing, manufacturing and marketing sophisticated
analytical and scientific instrument systems — Mass
Spectrometers.
What that means to the scientific/technical community is the
ability to identify and measure infinitely precise levels of
organic compounds and inorganic elements — a critical step
in the scientific process.
To us, it means a commanding hold on the worldwide
markets and a lead on the competition. To you it means a
spectrum of possibilities for an exciting career, one that will
grow as fast as we are growing.
So not only can you enjoy the stability and resources of an
industry leader, but also have all the flexibility and potential
that your imagination can muster. At Finnigan MAT, we
reward initiative and resourcefulness, because our people
represent the most valuable resource we have.
If you are majoring in Electrical Engineering, or if you are
majoring in Electrical Engineering with an emphasis in
Computer Science (at the graduate or post-graduate level) we
invite you to interview with us. Discover how mass
spectrometry can mean an exciting career for you.
Representatives from Finnigan MAT will be interviewing on
the Stanford campus on Wednesday, April 26, 1989. See
what Finnigan MAT has to offer by visiting the Career
Planning and Placement Center — then sign up to interview
