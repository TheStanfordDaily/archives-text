#2-organic Produce
With the recent stories in the media about the health hazards of Alar and other
food chemicals, grocery stores all over the area have been jumping on the
natural foods bandwagon.
At Whole Poods Market, we're not Johnny-come-latelies when it comes to
organic produce. Since our founding in 1980, we've supported organic growing
methods for quality, health, and environmental concerns. We've always
specialized in produce grown without chemical pesticides, herbicides, and
insecticides.
Today, Whole Foods Market sells more organic produce than anyone else
in the United States. Here in Palo Alto, Whole Foods Market has the area's
largest and most diversified selection of organically grown produce.. .by far.
So. what's new to ttte competition is business as usual for us.
