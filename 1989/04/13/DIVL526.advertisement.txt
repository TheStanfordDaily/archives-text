Michael Jackson to come to Branner
to Moderate COP Debate
What do you think of political parties forming the student
body? Do you care whether your next Presidents are literate? Do
you just enjoy asking nasty questions and putting people on the
spot?
If so, then attend any one of several debates between the
rival slates for C.O.P. Four more debates, listed below, will take
place before the elections. Associate Dean of Student Affairs,
Michael Jackson, will moderate Monday night's debate in
Branner. Check out what the candidates are thinking on the
major issues such as TA funding, student rights and diversity.
Don't you want to vote for something more than a name?
Upcoming debates (look for fliers in dining halls):
