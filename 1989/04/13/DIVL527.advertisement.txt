ASSU Fee Refund News
The ASSU Fee Refunds
give those students who
strongly object to a particular
group's programming the
opportunity to withdraw
their financial support. While
most students do not
participate in all of the
organizations, most students
choose to financially support
the activities and programs
of various groups in order to
contribute to pluralism and
diversity at Stanford.
This quarter's refund
totaling slightly over $20,
will be available soon after,
the election.
