Secretary of State Eyes Stanford
The new computerized voting system, set to appear in this
year's election, has generated interest outside of Stanford, as
seen in a recent front-page article in the San Francisco
Chronicle.
The system, believed to be the first of its kind in California,
uses Macintosh computers as voting booths.
Representatives from the State Department will be on hand
to view the election process. A good turnout Tuesday and
Wednesday will promote more such elections in the future.
How you spend 10 minutes...
Take time to vote.
...can affect a whole year.
