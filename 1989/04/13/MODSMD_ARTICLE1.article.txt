# SLAC research team detects the elusive Z particle

The champagne flowed yester
day at SLAC as physicists cele
brated the detection of their first
Z particle, one of the cornerstones
of the Standard Model of particle
physics, after months of frustrat
ing delays.
The unmistakable shower of
particles characteristic of a mas
sive Z particle was found early
yesterday morning in data taken
early Tuesday morning. The Z is
a massive subatomic particle
believed to carry the "weak" nu
clear force, one of the four fun
damental forces of nature.
"It's not a scientific revolution,"
said Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center Director Burton Richter,
"but it's a demonstration that the
machine we have struggled with
is finally performing."
Although the Z particles were
discovered at Geneva's European
Center for Nuclear Research and
later produced at the Fermi Na
tional Accelerator Laboratory
near Chicago, Stanford's Z parti
cle is unique. It is the only one
observed so far to decay via a pair
of quarks, the particles thought
to be the building blocks of most

matter, according to SLAC science
spokesperson Michael Riordan.
The particle was created by
smashing together streams of bil
lions of electrons and positrons
accelerated by the Stanford
Linear Collider, a one-of-a-kind
machine that was Richter's
brainchild. The collider was com
pleted last year at a cost of more
than $115 million, an amount far
less than a competing machine at
Geneva's center slated to begin
operation this summer.
SLAC's Z particle was actually
first picked up at the California
Institute of Technology by
postdoctoral student Barritt Mil
liken who was sifting through data
tracked by the computers at
SLAC.
"I was the only one awake,"
said Milliken, who found the par
ticle at about 7:30 a.m. If the
particle had appeared two hours
later, it would have been discov
ered by one of the other postdoc
toral students working on the
project, "the fire-eating Z
finders," he said.
The making of the Z is only
the first, but mjyor, step in cre
ating hundreds of these particles
so that physicists can better un
derstand the weak nuclear force

and the Standard Model that ex
plains it. For about two decades,
physicists have been using the
Standard Model to describe the
complex world of dozens of sub
atomic particles.
Richter said he felt a "great
feeling of relief" when he heard
about the discovery, but added
that he "would have preferred to
be where we are now a year ago."
Although the Stanford collider
— the world's only linear collider
— was in operation last summer,
it took an additional five months
and $3 million worth of work
before the collider could function
properly, Riordan said.
Richter said until about 100
particles are made, "no new
physics can be done." Richter
added that he was unsure when
the 100 would be developed.
"We're still learning to have the
detector and the [collider] live
with each other," he said. "We're
working in an unknown area. No
one has had any experience oper
ating a collider."
"With each shot of this machine
you're dealing with 10 billion elec
trons and 10 billion positrons,"
Richter said. The loss of just 10
