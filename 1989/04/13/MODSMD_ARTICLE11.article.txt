## Bipartisan panel to censure Wright 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
House ethics committee has
found "reason to believe"
Speaker Jim Wright im
properly accepted gifts from a
business partner and sought to
evade outside income limits
through bulk sales of his book,
a source familiar with the
probe said late yesterday.
The decisions, essentially
completing the panel's 10-
month investigation of the
speaker's finances, dealt a se
vere political blow to Wright
and appeared likely to jeopar
dize his standing as the Demo
cratic Party's top elected offi
cial.
Wright continued to main
tain he has done nothing wrong
and was expected to mount a
vigorous defense. "All options
are open," said Wright spokes
man Mark Johnson.

The source, speaking on con
dition of anonymity, said a
strong bipartisan msyority of
the 12-member committee
voted behind closed doors yes
terday to find that Wright had
apparently violated House rules
in the two most serious areas
before the panel: the accept
ance of gifts from a person with
an interest in legislation and
the evasion of outside income
limits.
That further underscored
the political trouble the deci
sion presents for Wright, D-
Texas.
The committee plans to meet
again today, said chairman
Julian Dixon, D-Calif. But a
source familiar with the proc
ess said all major decisions
have been made, and the meet
ing will be only to work on
drafting the committee's final
report.
