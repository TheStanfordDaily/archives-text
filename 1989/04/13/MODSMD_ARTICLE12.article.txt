# Ueberroth's Eastern deal collapses

NEW YORK (AP) - Peter
Ueberroth's proposed $464 mil
lion purchase of strike-bound
Eastern Airlines collapsed over an
impasse with its unions and par
ent Texas Air Corp., the former
baseball commissioner announced
yesterday.
"We are deeply disappointed
this transaction collapsed last
night and is done," Ueberroth told
a news conference. "Our agree
ment with Texas Air is ter
minated, it's finished, it's over."
Eastern President Phil Bakes
said the Miami-based airline's
strategy is to reorganize as a
smaller carrier serving 50 percent
to 60 percent of its pre-strike
schedule of 1,040 flights a day
and employing 15,000 to 18,000
people, compared with 31,000
before the strike.
The announcement that the
Ueberroth deal had collapsed
came following days of intense ne
gotiations that continued yester
day as a federal bankruptcy judge
tried to salvage the sinking deal.
A key issue blocking the deal
was whether an outside trustee

should be appointed to run the
airline until the sale was com
pleted. The union proposal has
been opposed by Frank Lorenzo,
chairman of Texas Air, who would
lose his authority over Eastern
under the union plan even if the
Ueberroth deal failed.
"The major hurdle I defined as
interim management and the

bankruptcy process," Ueberroth
said. "We were not able to bridge
this hurdle although both of us I
think tried to do that."
Eastern's unions have accused
Lorenzo of gross mismanagement
and of stripping Eastern of vital
assets since Texas Air bought the
airline in 1986, and have ex
pressed concern he would con
tinue doing so if left in charge.
"I'm disappointed to say the
least," said Wally Haber, a Mac
hinists union official in Miami. "I
can tell you right now, Mr.
Lorenzo would have walked away
in this deal with a lot more money
than he put into Eastern Airlines.
Obviously they've got some plans
to milk some more out of East
ern.
At Eastern corporate headquar
ters, management employees
gathered around television sets
and expressed relief. "I do think
there is a certain release of anx
iety here," said spokesman James
Ashlock.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton
Lifland met yesterday with attor
neys for Eastern, its unions and

the Ueberroth group to try to save
the deal negotiated only days ear
lier, saying it represented a his
toric opportunity to save one of
the nation's biggest airlines.
Any deal required full agree
ment from Ueberroth, Lorenzo,
Eastern's three unions and East
ern's creditors.
Eastern has been flying only a
fraction of its schedule since its
Machinists union began a strike
March 4 that has been supported
by its flight attendants and pilots
unions.
Ashlock said Eastern has been
"quietly" recalling non-union
workers after being down to 1,000
the first week of the strike. East
ern has 115 to 116 flights daily
after resuming service on
Bahamas and Atlanta routes this
week, he said.
He said Eastern has 64 new
pilots receiving training and a
larger class will begin training,
which takes at least six weeks,
next week.
In another development Wed
nesday, a federal judge in Miami
upheld the Eastern's pilots par
ticipation in the Machinists strike.
