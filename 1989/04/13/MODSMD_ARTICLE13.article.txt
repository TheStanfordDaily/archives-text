# North testifies about key memos

WASHINGTON (AP) - Oliver
North testified yesterday he
thought he was protecting Presi
dent Reagan when he altered six
Iran-Contra "problem memos"
before investigators from the at
torney general could get a look at
them.
Appearing pale and on edge in
his fifth day on the witness stand,
North hotly denied he "had been
working in a den of thieves" at
the National Security Council.
And he said the documents he
destroyed "were only the tip of
the iceberg" compared to those in
the hands of prosecutors.
North said he was present, as
the Iran-Contra affair was about
to burst into public view, when
National Security Adviser John
Poindexter tore up a December
1985 presidential "finding"
retroactively authorizing a ship
ment of missiles to Iran in a failed
effort to win the release of Amer

ican hostages in Lebanon.
Poindexter's testimony on
destroying the document —
making no mention of North's
presence — was one of the more
startling revelations during the
congressional Iran-Contra hear
ings in 1987.
"Where is the finding now?"
Prosecutor John Keker asked
North.
A. I don't know.
Q. What happened to it?
A. I'm told it was destroyed.
Q. By whom?
A. Admiral Poindexter
Q. When?
A. Nov. 21-22-23 (1986).
Q. When did you learn Admiral
Poindexter destroyed the finding.
A. I was there I saw him tear
it in two.
North said high administration
officials did not want the finding
exposed. It would have been an
embarrassment, North said, "be

cause it looked like an arms-for
hostages swap." Reagan had said
often he would not negotiate with
kidnappers.
Keker asked whether North
knew "it was the only version in
existence, the only paper in the
entire world" with Reagan's au
thorization. North said he didn't
know.
During the congressional hear
ings Poindexter said of the find
ing, "I thought it was politically
embarrassing so I decided to tear
it up, tore it up, and put it in a
burn bag behind my desk."
That same day, North said, Nov.
21, his former boss Robert McFar
lane reminded him to sanitize six
notes which indicated Reagan's or
McFarlane's knowledge of what
North had done for the
Nicaraguan Contras.
North testified he had orders
of a year's standing from McFar
lane to alter the memos.
