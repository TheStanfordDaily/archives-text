Congress to debate Contra-aid bill
WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State
James Baker 111 asked Congress yesterday to
quickly approve a $49.7 million bipartisan aid
plan for the Contra rebels to set up an acid test
of the willingness of Nicaragua's Sandinista gov
ernment and its Soviet allies to support the peace
process.
The House Appropriations Committee voted
32-10 to recommend the compromise plan be
adopted. Other congressional panels were poised
to endorse it as well.
The proposal, which could reach the House
floor by today, is likely to be approved by both
chambers, putting at least a temporary end to
years of controversy and divisiveness over former
President Reagan's policy of arming the Contras.

Baker said the new arrangement to maintain
the Contras with clothing, food, medical supplies
and other non-military aid will "put the United
States back in the hallgame in Central America."
Warsaw Pact wants missle talks
BERLIN (AP) — The Warsaw Pact yesterday
unveiled a detailed proposal to NATO for starting
negotiations to eliminate short-range nuclear
weapons in Europe in a move that could widen
differences within the Western alliance.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization al
ready has rejected previous Soviet pressure to
begin talks aimed at reducing or eliminating the
tactical nuclear weapons, which have a range of
less than 310 miles.
