## Don't nix flicks 
### 
TUESDAY FILMS has prob
ably shocked or offended
more people on this
campus than The Band and the
Chaparral combined.
The weekly film series, not to
be confused with ASSU Flicks,
has created a name for itself by
showing unorthodox, sometimes
highly controversial films. In
fact, in many of these films, the
unusual is more often than not
the usual.
Not surprisingly, some have
called for certain films to be pro
hibited from making a campus
appearance. Unfortunately,
"some" recently includes officials
in University Events and Serv
ices, the administrative body that
schedules space for presentations
and meetings — including Tues
day Films.
Director Lois Wagner informed
Tuesday Films coordinators this
quarter that a film list needed
to be submitted before Events
and Services would grant space
for the showings. Though the se
ries is usually screened in Cub

berley Auditorium, the organiza
tion must reapply every quarter
to obtain the space.
Organizers say previously they
had to submit a list of films but
not before space was allocated.
The new procedure smacks of
censorship, pure and simple. Why
else would Events and Services
demand a list prior to approval?
Certainly they are not worried
about space considerations — the
films usually draw a solid crowd
but do not bust the box office.
Now that Tuesday Films has
grudgingly offered a list of films,
Events and Services has provided
space conditionally — as long as
Tuesday Films publicizes the con
troversial nature of one of the
films, "Salo," in fliers, outside
the auditorium and before the
presentation.
The move to place guidelines
on the showing of certain films
based on their content puts the
University in the business of cen
sorship, a venture that will hope
fully go bankrupt very soon.
