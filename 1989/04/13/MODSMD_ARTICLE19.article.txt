IF YOU HAVEN'T had a
chance to wander through the
area between the Quad and
the Physics Tank in the past few
days, you're in store for a
surprise. You will probabiy be
shocked by something con
spicuously absent from Lomita
Mall for the better part of a year
— open space.
The Lomita Mall Project —
necessary for the future con
struction of a $250 million sci
ence center — was plagued with
unusual setbacks.
In November, a truck carrying
steam pipes for the project

crashed and burned. Then it took
the contractor four months to se
cure a new set of pipes. January
and February rains added to the
delays, halting construction work
for more than two weeks.
While the University is not to
blame for bizarre problems, Stan
ford should take precautions to
make sure that such incon
veniences do not happen in the
future.
In hindsight, it doesn't seem
too pushy to ask a contractor to
ensure that the materials neces
sary to complete the job are in
plentiful supply.
