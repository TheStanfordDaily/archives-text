# Marriott to give up Tresidder contract
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Editorial staff 
After losing nearly $1 million
in three-and-a-half years, Mar
riott Corp. has lost its appetite
for managing Tresidder Union's
food services.
Because of financial and logisti
cal difficulties, Tresidder and
Marriott have agreed not to ex
ercise a contract option allowing
Marriott to continue managing
food services next year. Tresidder
announced the decision yesterday.
Paul Szczesiul, associate direc
tor of Tresidder, said he hopes to
have a new contractor by the end
of spring quarter.
Tresidder and the Saga Corp.
signed a three-year contract with
two one-year extension options in
1985, according to Szczesiul. Saga
was bought by Marriott two years
ago, and last year, Tresidder ex
ercised its first renewal option to
extend management through this
summer.
The current agreement expires
Aug. 31, after which a new con
tractor will take control of the

food services.
Food services at Tresidder in
clude the Coffee House, Grand
Marketplace, Corner Pocket, The
Patio Grill, Encina Station, Tres
idder Catering and The Store.
Szczesiul and student workers
agreed that the food services at
Tresidder could run better with
a contractor that is not as large
and impersonal as Marriott. And
Marriott management said their
venture has proven to be a finan
cial failure.
According to Greg Mount, a
Marriott employee and general
manager of Tresidder's food serv
ices, the decision by Marriott was
"strictly financial."
"We felt that under the present
contractual arrangements there
was no opportunity to make any
money," Mount said, explaining
that Marriott must pay Tresidder
a commission on the corporation's
revenue.
The food services are only con
tracted out to Marriott, while the
University owns and subsidizes all
facilities.
Marriott is a "profit-driven cor

poration" and although they
"have been very happy being at
Stanford and working with the
people at Stanford," Marriott has
found it impossible to make
money, Mount said.
Szczesiul said Tresidder has not
received "the kind of attention
that it needs" under Marriott's
control. When Marriott took over
Saga, Tresidder was left to deal
with a large corporation, a situa
tion that Szczesiul said did not
serve either Tresidder's or Mar
riott's interests.
Tresidder'B food services have
wanted to remain open at off-peak
hours to serve the student body,
despite not always being "finan
cially productive," Szczesiul said.
But this attitude is not construc
tive for a large corporation inter
ested in turning a profit.
Saga was smaller and closer to
home, with headquarters on Sand
Hill Road in Menlo Park, whereas
Marriott's corporate offices are
3,000 miles away in Bethesda, Md.
But even under Saga, the food
services suffered from the corpo
rate influence, according to Coffee

House employee Sonya Jones, a
Stanford graduate. Before 1985,
the Coffee House was student
run.
A difference in attitude charac
terizes the Coffee House atmos
phere since Saga bought the op
eration, she said. The student-run
Coffee House provided "more of
a place for students to work and
hang out," she said, adding that
since they went corporate, the
food services are "more profes
sional and geared toward busi
ness."
Although pay has improved sig
nificantly since the Coffee House
came under corporate control, stu
dent managers have felt lately
that they are being "phased out
in terms of their role," Jones said.
According to senior Mark Ber
zins, who works at the Corner
Pocket, the corporation has
"McDonaldized" the eatery. Stu
dent workers at the Corner Pocket
"used to look like students, act
like students and dress like stu
dents," he said.
