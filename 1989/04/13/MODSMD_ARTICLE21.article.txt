## Corporate compromises 
### 
THE TENSION BETWEEN gradu
ate and undergraduate education
is much more severe than we like
to admit, and it is exacerbated by our
administration's bottom-line, corporate
approach to pedagogy. As a result, Stan
ford undergraduate education has been
and will continue to be intellectually im
poverished.
Stanford tries to reconcile the gradu
ates' need to learn how to teach with the
undergraduates' need to be well taught.
Undergraduates are packed into lecture
halls to listen to professors speak but
they are also provided with smaller sec
tions where graduate teaching assistants
act as instructor.
This "solution" rests on two fictions:
that "education" takes place in the lec
ture hall, and that the TAs who supervise
sections are fully accomplished teachers.
By definition, graduate students are
apprentices. Some are outstanding in
structors, but to expect every 25-year-old
Ph.D. candidate to have mastered the art
of teaching is both unfair and incorrect.
And how much real teaching goes on
in a lecture hall? Lectures, like television
programs, are by nature one-sided: all
give and no take. Regardless of the skill
of the lecturer, the medium cannot fully
engage or shape a student's mind.
In four years at Stanford, I have had
some excellent lectures, lectures that
sparked an interest or opened a door. But
I have never left a lecture hall with that
rare intoxication of spirit, that keen in
sight, that is sometimes provided by the
best of small-group teaching environ

ments and that is at the core of a true
education.
These two fictions — lecture hall "ed
ucation" and universal TA expertise —
hurt undergraduate instruction. But
they're the price we pay for going to a
university instead of a college, and there
are countervailing benefits, like chances
to do research, that at least theoretically
compensate for the generally poor state
of undergraduate instruction.
Unfortunately, Stanford seems to make
the worst of an already bad situation. If
it is going to give graduate students the
primary responsibility for small-group
undergraduate teaching, it should at least
give them the resources to do the job.
This school's priorities in resource al
location seem to be determined by an
unsophisticated, almost anti-intellectual,
corporate mentality operating in a
vacuum of pedagogical principle.
Budget crunch? Cut back on TAs. Keep
sections too big for an inexperienced doc
toral candidate to teach effectively. Use
sections as extra lecture periods instead
of as opportunities for small group learn
ing. Put "discussion sections" into lecture
halls, or cram them into seminar rooms
where students have to sit two or three
deep, destroying any possibility of open
exchange. The net result is marginal
saving and pedagogical disaster.
True, funding TAs adequately and
giving them smaller sections and better
facilities is not as sexy an educational
priority as appointing new deans or ini
tiating new courses on whatever topics
happen to be hot this decade. But if Stan-

On a lighter note: Parking in the Quad-
Oval area is always difficult, but Monday
it was impossible. The Oval had the
feeling of a post-deregulation airport,
with tens of cars at any time circling in
wait for a place to park. Lots of people
(myself included) were made late; every
one got pissed off.
The culprit in this mess was the Board
of Trustees. Two traffic cops had used
sawhorses to block off 117 parking spaces
(I counted them later) near the Biz School
for the trustees.
At last count, there were 29 trustees,
not 117. It's not just unfair to block off
about 10 percent of available parking in
a heavily trafficked area for the trustees;
it's bad politics. The point of having trus
tee meetings on campus is not to insulate
the board from day-to-day campus incon
veniences.
Just the opposite. If parking is a prob
lem, the trustees should experience it. If
it's a big enough problem that they have
to section off a private lot whenever they
meet, they should imagine how the rest
of us feel.

saving and pedagogical disaster.
True, funding TAs adequately and
giving them smaller sections and better
facilities is not as sexy an educational
priority as appointing new deans or ini

On a lighter note: Parking in the Quad-
Oval area is always difficult, but Monday
it was impossible. The Oval had the
feeling of a post-deregulation airport,
with tens of cars at any time circling in
wait for a place to park. Lots of people
(myself included) were made late; every
one got pissed off.
The culprit in this mess was the Board
of Trustees. Two traffic cops had used
sawhorses to block off 117 parking spaces
(I counted them later) near the Biz School
for the trustees.
At last count, there were 29 trustees,
not 117. It's not just unfair to block off
about 10 percent of available parking in
a heavily trafficked area for the trustees;
it's bad politics. The point of having trus
tee meetings on campus is not to insulate
the board from day-to-day campus incon
veniences.
Just the opposite. If parking is a prob
lem, the trustees should experience it. If
it's a big enough problem that they have
to section off a private lot whenever they
meet, they should imagine how the rest
of us feel.
