Rising sun symbol
may have had
various meanings
I'm writing in response to Michael
Chen's April 12 letter concerning the
Kappa Alpha Fraternity's rising sun
fliers. Chen claims that the poster
connotes the atrocities of Japanese
militarism. Growing up with this sym
bol must have been a terrifying experi
ence for millions of people.
Never having lived during that time
in Japanese occupied territory, I will
never understand the full impact of
that sign to so many people. However,
I think that this accusation unneces
sarily attacks the rising sun symbol.
I would like to argue that a rising
sun to depict Japan is not inexcusable.
The World War II and KA emblems
share some similarities, but not many.
The flag the Japanese used during
World War II was red and white, not
red and black. The Japanese flag cen
tered the sun with wide rays protrud
ing around the entire circle. The KA
flier has half a sun rising from behind
a lake with thin rays coming from the
top part of the sun, and it has "KA"
written in its center.
For some, however, the picture
might bring to mind the Rape of
Nanking. The Japanese committed this
atrocity when they used the rising sun
emblem. However, Americans have
committed atrocities underneath the
American flag.
Any American history student could
tell you of how a young United States
used black slaves to support the flag.
How about My Lai? Hitler would have
been proud to claim that attack in Viet
Nam. For some Vietnamese, the flag
represents the atrocities of Americans.
Japan is the land of the rising sun. I

have no idea what the KAs thought
when they designed this poster, but I
would assume that they used a sun to
represent Japan and their symbol by
being the "House of the Rising Sun."
Every artistic work can be a subject
of many interpretations, and I think
that assuming the artists had ulterior
motives to bring to mind the war so
they could subtly advertise kamikazes
stretches the imagination too far. I
hope that we at Stanford can occasion
ally take an optimistic view of artwork
and not always as attacks on our per
son.

Daily editors are
too often critical of
the administration
I was amused by the April 10 edito
rial which criticized the University's
decision to mail grades this quarter. It
seems that Stanford students in gener
al, and Daily editors in particular, can
always find something to complain

about when it comes to the activities
of the University administration.
The absurdity of the editorial be
comes apparent when one considers the
following thought experiment: Suppose
that the Registrar's Office had made
the opposite decision, i.e. had decided
to switch from mailing grades to
having us stand in line.
One can only imagine what The
Daily's editorial would have looked like:
"How many lines must students stand
in on the first day of the quarter? The
new policy introduces untold inconven
ience for a net savings of a measly
$2,300. This is yet another example of
the University's intolerable behavior
toward the students." Ad infinitum et
nauseam.
I am not commenting on the correct
ness of the University's decision, only
on The Daily's suspect reasoning. Any
decision brings with it gains as well as
losses; the editors seem often to over
emphasize the latter and then bask in
self-pity and moral righteousness.
Please, editors: more thoughtful anal
ysis, less hyperbole. Hyperbole should
be reserved for letters to the editor.

DU members are
only interested in
alcohol, vandalism
The April 11 article "Unofficial DUs
to hold aggressive rush" was
newsworthy. The fliers and Daily ad
vertisement brought the name of DU
out into the public, and an explanation
was required. The fact that the article
seemed to glorify the activities and
ideals of this group of men is problem
atic, but not unresolvable.
Activities of a fraternal organization
are many and varied. Fraternity mem
bers participate in community service
projects, philanthropic fundraisers,
educational programming, faculty re
ceptions, alumni career fairs, national
leadership training conventions, road
trips on vacations and weekend activi
ties, as well as formals and parties.
It is these activities and the interac
tion that goes into their planning and
execution that form the experiences
and memories of fraternity men.
The quote from an anonymous DU
rush chair sums it up very nicely.
"We're just a drinking club." DU is
centered around alcohol. Their parties
are drunken fun. Unfortunately, this
"great bunch of guys" offers little be
yond that.
It is not that this rebellious organi
zation couldn't perform the same serv
ices and activities as real fraternity
organizations, but rather that the men
involved in the group are not con
cerned with anything more than
drunken parties and vandalism.
There is nothing wrong with having
fun. I respect the DUs' desire to let
loose. I do feel, however, that the op
portunities, ideals and goals of the
organization are shallow, shortsighted,
and counterproductive to a member's
future growth.
