## Unbeatable netters top Cal Whitlinger suffers first loss; Rossides returns to action 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
BERKELEY — The trip to the
California campus is rarely an in
teresting one. Whether you take
101 or 880, you'll sit in traffic
for awhile and get there in about
an hour.
Once in Berkeley, however,
something interesting almost al
ways happens, as it did for the
Stanford women's tennis team
yesterday. Although the 6-1 score
could've been expected, the Car
dinal provided a couple of
surprises along the way.

Women's Tennis
Cardinal 6, Golden Bears 1

Things started off pretty much
as expected. Before the sun even
had a chance to break through
the clouds and warm the Hellman
Tennis Center, Teri Whitlinger
breezed past Sharon Fletcher at
No. 5 singles by a 6-1, 6-0 score.
Commenting on the Stanford
match Tuesday, California Coach
Jan Brogan said "they are prob
ably the best college team I've
seen since I started coaching (11
years ago)."
Neither Whitlinger's result, nor
any of those immediately subse
quent to that did anything to
change that assessment.
As the next matches were com
pleted, the Cardinal appeared to
be well on its way to upping the

season mark to 21-0. The keys
were Stanford's two sensational
freshmen: Debbie Graham and
Kylie Johnson.
Graham scored a 6-3, 6-0
blowout at No. 4 over Emilie Vi
queira, upping her personal dual
meet record to 21-0 in the process.
Graham has only dropped three
sets all year.
Johnson was impressive at No.
6 despite being unable to practice
Tuesday and being listed as ques
tionable. She defeated Alissa
Finerman 7-6 (7-5), 6-1.
"Kylie did a great job," Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan said. "She
was down 3-0 (in the first set)
and came up and won."
Sandra Birch continued her ex
cellent play at No. 2 in a match
against California freshman Lisa
Albano. Like Graham and
Johnson, Albano is one of the na
tion's top newcomers. But she was
no match for the Stanford Ail-
American. Birch handled her by
a 6-4, 6-3 score.
A harbinger that strange things
were about to happen began to
develop in the No. 3 singles match
between Lisa Green and Kay
Louthian. Midway through the
second set, Louthian had to stop
the match temporarily because
she was bothered by a shoulder
injury.
After about 15 minutes of
stretching, Louthian decided to
attempt to continue. She began
to serve underhand and tried to
hit the ball into the middle of the
court. Green smashed a winner

off Louthian's first serve and the
Cal sophomore soon decided to call
it a day. Green was leading 6-3,
4-5 at the time.
With that, the Cardinal had its
five wins and with them the vic
tory. It was then when that Stan
ford unwrapped its surprise
packages.
Tami Whitlinger was locked in
a tense match with Karen Shin
at No. 1. Whitlinger had missed
the team's last match due to a
case of the stomach flu and may
have been a little short on
stamina. The last thing she
needed was a long, drawn out
match.
But that's exactly what she got
from the pesky Shin, a hard hitter
in the mold of USC's Trisha Laux,
who Whitlinger defeated after
coming back from a 5-1 third-set
deficit Saturday.
Whitlinger captured the first
set 7-5 and seemed to break Shin's
serve in the first game of the
second set. Shin hit a ball at least
six inches wide of the sideline that
Whitlinger called out. Since the
game was at break point, Whit
linger would've taken a 1-0 lead.
But Shin appealed to the chair
umpire — who was sitting on the
opposite side of the court — and
the call was overruled. Shin used
her second chance to win the next
two points and the game.
Six straight service breaks fol
lowed before Whitlinger held to
draw even at 4-4. Whitlinger later

had a game point at 4-5 when an
interminable rally ensued. Shin
won the point and soon after won
the set.
Whitlinger took a 5-2 lead in
the decisive set and seemed to
have things sewn up, but Shin
still had some fight left. Sub
seqently, Whitlinger was vic
timized by what might be called
the Golden Rule of Tennis: If you
do unto others; prepare to have
others do unto you.
For, as Whitlinger completed a
seemingly impossible comeback
Saturday, so did Shin yesterday.

While it wasn't nearly as stirring,
Shin's eventual 7-5 triumph in
the third set — and therefore the
match — was the highlight of the
day for the home crowd and
earned her a handshake from
Brennan.
The defeat ended Whitlinger's
16-match winning streak. "She
owed the fates one," Brennan
said, referring to the Laux match.
"It's tough to be undefeated, the
pressure just builds and builds.
"[The loss] could help her down
the road ... at the end of the
season," he added.

Meanwhile, on the adjacent
court, Eleni Rossides and Lisa
Green were playing doubles. Yes,
that's right, Eleni Rossides. The
oft-injured All-American looked a
bit rusty, but overall played fairly
well and the tandem won handily,
6-0, 6-2, over Viqueira and Annika
Wasserman.
Asked how it felt to play after
the long layoff, Rossides said
"very good."
"Everything's fine. I just pulled
my stomach muscle, it'll be fine
by next week." Rossides could
return to singles action soon.

No. 5 singles by a 6-1, 6-0 score.
Commenting on the Stanford
match Tuesday, California Coach
Jan Brogan said "they are prob
ably the best college team I've
seen since I started coaching (11
years ago)."
Neither Whitlinger's result, nor
any of those immediately subse
quent to that did anything to
change that assessment.
As the next matches were com
pleted, the Cardinal appeared to
be well on its way to upping the

season mark to 21-0. The keys
were Stanford's two sensational
freshmen: Debbie Graham and
Kylie Johnson.
Graham scored a 6-3, 6-0
blowout at No. 4 over Emilie Vi
queira, upping her personal dual
meet record to 21-0 in the process.
Graham has only dropped three
sets all year.
Johnson was impressive at No.
6 despite being unable to practice
Tuesday and being listed as ques
tionable. She defeated Alissa
Finerman 7-6 (7-5), 6-1.
"Kylie did a great job," Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan said. "She
was down 3-0 (in the first set)
and came up and won."
Sandra Birch continued her ex
cellent play at No. 2 in a match
against California freshman Lisa
Albano. Like Graham and
Johnson, Albano is one of the na
tion's top newcomers. But she was
no match for the Stanford Ail-
American. Birch handled her by
a 6-4, 6-3 score.
A harbinger that strange things
were about to happen began to
develop in the No. 3 singles match
between Lisa Green and Kay
Louthian. Midway through the
second set, Louthian had to stop
the match temporarily because
she was bothered by a shoulder
injury.
After about 15 minutes of
stretching, Louthian decided to
attempt to continue. She began
to serve underhand and tried to
hit the ball into the middle of the
court. Green smashed a winner

off Louthian's first serve and the
Cal sophomore soon decided to call
it a day. Green was leading 6-3,
4-5 at the time.
With that, the Cardinal had its
five wins and with them the vic
tory. It was then when that Stan
ford unwrapped its surprise
packages.
Tami Whitlinger was locked in
a tense match with Karen Shin
at No. 1. Whitlinger had missed
the team's last match due to a
case of the stomach flu and may
have been a little short on
stamina. The last thing she
needed was a long, drawn out
match.
But that's exactly what she got
from the pesky Shin, a hard hitter
in the mold of USC's Trisha Laux,
who Whitlinger defeated after
coming back from a 5-1 third-set
deficit Saturday.
Whitlinger captured the first
set 7-5 and seemed to break Shin's
serve in the first game of the
second set. Shin hit a ball at least
six inches wide of the sideline that
Whitlinger called out. Since the
game was at break point, Whit
linger would've taken a 1-0 lead.
But Shin appealed to the chair
umpire — who was sitting on the
opposite side of the court — and
the call was overruled. Shin used
her second chance to win the next
two points and the game.
Six straight service breaks fol
lowed before Whitlinger held to
draw even at 4-4. Whitlinger later

had a game point at 4-5 when an
interminable rally ensued. Shin
won the point and soon after won
the set.
Whitlinger took a 5-2 lead in
the decisive set and seemed to
have things sewn up, but Shin
still had some fight left. Sub
seqently, Whitlinger was vic
timized by what might be called
the Golden Rule of Tennis: If you
do unto others; prepare to have
others do unto you.
For, as Whitlinger completed a
seemingly impossible comeback
Saturday, so did Shin yesterday.

While it wasn't nearly as stirring,
Shin's eventual 7-5 triumph in
the third set — and therefore the
match — was the highlight of the
day for the home crowd and
earned her a handshake from
Brennan.
The defeat ended Whitlinger's
16-match winning streak. "She
owed the fates one," Brennan
said, referring to the Laux match.
"It's tough to be undefeated, the
pressure just builds and builds.
"[The loss] could help her down
the road ... at the end of the
season," he added.

Meanwhile, on the adjacent
court, Eleni Rossides and Lisa
Green were playing doubles. Yes,
that's right, Eleni Rossides. The
oft-injured All-American looked a
bit rusty, but overall played fairly
well and the tandem won handily,
6-0, 6-2, over Viqueira and Annika
Wasserman.
Asked how it felt to play after
the long layoff, Rossides said
"very good."
"Everything's fine. I just pulled
my stomach muscle, it'll be fine
by next week." Rossides could
return to singles action soon.

something interesting almost al

could've been expected, the Car
