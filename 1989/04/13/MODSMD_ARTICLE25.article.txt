# Roll tape! Switch to camera three! Cut to commercial!

### 
Last weekend in Tempe, Ariz., I was
afforded the privilege of standing
in ESPN's production truck during
its telecast of Sunday's Arizona State-
Stanford baseball game.
I was thoroughly impressed with all
that goes into televising a baseball game.
If you think that it's just a pretty boy
and a jock babbling into a microphone,
you've got another thing coming.
It is quite a production. There are more
people with more titles than you could
possibly imagine. There's a producer, di
rector, associate producer, associate di
rector, technical director, graphics
person, audio person, audio assistant, a
couple video tape guys and I haven't come
close to finishing the list.
To say that it was simply a blissful
experience, however, would not be the
truth. These folks do not live the glamour
life everyone associates with TV. Not at
all.
• You see, on this night the game went
13 innings. It lasted five hours. And the
production truck was a pill box. The crew
had room to sit down, barely. They had
po room to move, period. When I said I
stood in the truck, I was serious. If there
had been an extra chair, there would

have been no place to put it. When I
needed a rest, I knelt down on the rubber
mat that covered the floor near the en
trance to the room.
Shari Conover, the graphics person, at
one point exclaimed, "I'm glad I'm not
claustrophobic." Conover's seat pressed
her up against both the back wall and a
side wall of the truck. Associate producer
Phil Orlins sat scrunched up next to her,
with associate director Cornelius Harris
scrunching him from the other side.
Several times I thought "Corny," as they
call him, was going to be nudged off the
end of the bench.
Corny had this other little problem.
He smokes. But the room was so small

he couldn't light up. Round about the
fifth inning he couldn't stand it any
longer. To the jeers of his cohorts, Corny
reached over and opened the door to the
truck. He stood on the top step, smoked
his cigarette, kept his headset on and
never missed a beat.
What's more, the air conditioner in the
truck was working overtime. It was still
around 90 degrees outside, but the pro
duction room was like an icebox. Several
pcfefrte 1 kept' their jackets on the whole
night. Being a desert rat myself, I froze
without one.
In spite of the conditions, the crew
was nearly flawless. Conover's job may
be the most demanding of any. She is
constantly pounding away at her com
puter, changing and updating the graph
ics on every player as he comes to bat,
getting the count ready to be flashed on
the screen, knowing that if she hesitates
a second, the moment will be lost.
Director Ken Fouts decides what you
see on the screen, calling for every camera
change. Fouts determines in a split
second where the ball is headed and barks
out a camera number so the technical
director can change your picture. He also

decides when a graphic will appear over
the picture.
Here's a little nibble of what's involved
in just getting a player's name and num
bers on the screen and then the count
in the middle of his at-bat. A player
makes out, and Conover calls up the
prepared graphic for the next batter.
Orlins peruses his scorecard and
decides what to put under his name —
he's 2-for-3 with a homer and a walk.
Conover changes it from what was there
before the player's last at-bat. She yells
that it's ready. Fouts says to run it, and
his technical man puts it on the screen.
This graphic is on screen for a couple
seconds, then Conover frantically calls up
the count on her computer. If she can
catch up with the correct count before
the at-bat is over, she yells out, "Count's
good," and Fouts gives the okay. If you
watch carefully, the count rarely appears
twice in one at-bat, unless it's a partic
ularly long at-bat.
Producer Bob Steinfeld is the glue that
holds everything together. Steinfeld
decides how the story is going to be told.
When a replay is necessary, he calls it,

chooses the camera angles and gives his
instructions via headset to the video
editors in another room in the truck.
On this night, a tremendous collision
at home plate helped keep the Cardinal
on top until late in the game. Steinfeld
called for the "not in the box score"
feature, running the replay of the colli
sion some three or four innings after it
happened. A three-run Devil rally in the
ninth reduced its significance, but it was
highly appropriate when shown.
The only part of the whole operation
that disturbed me was ESPN's control
over the flow of the game. I don't mind
holding up the start of the game until
TV is ready, but once during Monday's
telecast, in the middle of the count, a
pitching coach made a shorter trip to the
hill than the crew expected, and the
players were left standing around.
Forever, it seemed.
Nonetheless, the crew's performance
in a 13-inning marathon was outstanding,
often astounding.

happened. A three-run Devil rally in the
ninth reduced its significance, but it was
highly appropriate when shown.
The only part of the whole operation
that disturbed me was ESPN's control
over the flow of the game. I don't mind
holding up the start of the game until
TV is ready, but once during Monday's
telecast, in the middle of the count, a
pitching coach made a shorter trip to the
hill than the crew expected, and the
players were left standing around.
Forever, it seemed.
Nonetheless, the crew's performance
in a 13-inning marathon was outstanding,
often astounding.

Last weekend in Tempe, Ariz., I was
afforded the privilege of standing
in ESPN's production truck during
its telecast of Sunday's Arizona State-
Stanford baseball game.
I was thoroughly impressed with all
that goes into televising a baseball game.
If you think that it's just a pretty boy
and a jock babbling into a microphone,
you've got another thing coming.
It is quite a production. There are more
people with more titles than you could
possibly imagine. There's a producer, di
rector, associate producer, associate di
rector, technical director, graphics
person, audio person, audio assistant, a
couple video tape guys and I haven't come
close to finishing the list.
To say that it was simply a blissful
experience, however, would not be the
truth. These folks do not live the glamour
life everyone associates with TV. Not at
all.
• You see, on this night the game went
13 innings. It lasted five hours. And the
production truck was a pill box. The crew
had room to sit down, barely. They had
po room to move, period. When I said I
stood in the truck, I was serious. If there
had been an extra chair, there would

have been no place to put it. When I
needed a rest, I knelt down on the rubber
mat that covered the floor near the en
trance to the room.
Shari Conover, the graphics person, at
one point exclaimed, "I'm glad I'm not
claustrophobic." Conover's seat pressed
her up against both the back wall and a
side wall of the truck. Associate producer
Phil Orlins sat scrunched up next to her,
with associate director Cornelius Harris
scrunching him from the other side.
Several times I thought "Corny," as they
call him, was going to be nudged off the
end of the bench.
Corny had this other little problem.
He smokes. But the room was so small

he couldn't light up. Round about the
fifth inning he couldn't stand it any
longer. To the jeers of his cohorts, Corny
reached over and opened the door to the
truck. He stood on the top step, smoked
his cigarette, kept his headset on and
never missed a beat.
What's more, the air conditioner in the
truck was working overtime. It was still
around 90 degrees outside, but the pro
duction room was like an icebox. Several
pcfefrte 1 kept' their jackets on the whole
night. Being a desert rat myself, I froze
without one.
In spite of the conditions, the crew
was nearly flawless. Conover's job may
be the most demanding of any. She is
constantly pounding away at her com
puter, changing and updating the graph
ics on every player as he comes to bat,
getting the count ready to be flashed on
the screen, knowing that if she hesitates
a second, the moment will be lost.
Director Ken Fouts decides what you
see on the screen, calling for every camera
change. Fouts determines in a split
second where the ball is headed and barks
out a camera number so the technical
director can change your picture. He also

decides when a graphic will appear over
the picture.
Here's a little nibble of what's involved
in just getting a player's name and num
bers on the screen and then the count
in the middle of his at-bat. A player
makes out, and Conover calls up the
prepared graphic for the next batter.
Orlins peruses his scorecard and
decides what to put under his name —
he's 2-for-3 with a homer and a walk.
Conover changes it from what was there
before the player's last at-bat. She yells
that it's ready. Fouts says to run it, and
his technical man puts it on the screen.
This graphic is on screen for a couple
seconds, then Conover frantically calls up
the count on her computer. If she can
catch up with the correct count before
the at-bat is over, she yells out, "Count's
good," and Fouts gives the okay. If you
watch carefully, the count rarely appears
twice in one at-bat, unless it's a partic
ularly long at-bat.
Producer Bob Steinfeld is the glue that
holds everything together. Steinfeld
decides how the story is going to be told.
When a replay is necessary, he calls it,

chooses the camera angles and gives his
instructions via headset to the video
editors in another room in the truck.
On this night, a tremendous collision
at home plate helped keep the Cardinal
on top until late in the game. Steinfeld
called for the "not in the box score"
feature, running the replay of the colli
sion some three or four innings after it
happened. A three-run Devil rally in the
ninth reduced its significance, but it was
highly appropriate when shown.
