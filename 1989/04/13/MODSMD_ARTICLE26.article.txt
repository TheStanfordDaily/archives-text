# Gymnasts seek to stick stuff at NCAAs
## 
### Mark Smoyer Senior staff writer 
How can Stanford win the
NCAA Gymnastics Champion
ship? The equation is simple:
"If we hit our routines, we can
kick butt," freshman Tim Ryan
explained. "If we hit our routines,
we'll definitely be in the top three
and we can rival for first. . . .
About the only attitude we try
and maintain is going out and
being aggressive and really trying
to hit our routines.
Can you guess what the phrase
of the day is?
Don't laugh. If Stanford teams
knew how to hit their routines at
the NCAAs, this year's squad
might be defending a collegiate
title. In two of the past three
years, the Cardinal have entered
the NCAAs with high hopes, but
have left feeling very low. Soph
omore Tim Wang believes the
team has learned from its mis
takes.
"Last year, we were a little bit
too easy-going," Wang said.
"We all tried really hard but
there were little mistakes that we
didn't polish up on. Now we just
have to go for it aggressively with
the least possible mistakes."
Stanford, currently ranked No.
5, must finish among the top
three of the 10 championship
teams tonight in Lincoln, Neb. in
order to qualify for tomorrow
night's team finals. Individual
compulsory finals take place Sat
urday afternoon and are followed
that evening by the individual
event finals.
Houston Baptist enters the
meet atop the rankings, followed
by UCLA, Illinois and Ohio State.
However, the golden rule of col
legiate gymnastics says the wise
gambler puts his money on host
Nebraska.
V The No. 7 Cornhuskera, hosting

The team has
learned from its
mistakes.

the meet for the seventh year, are
vying for their seventh champion
ship in eleven years. Three of
those four which they have not
won have gone to the Bruins, who
have otherwise made a habit of
finishing second.
For the Cardinal, this is a
markedly different year from
years past, when the team had to
settle for third (1986) and fourth
(1988) place trophies. In January,
there was no guarantee that Stan
ford would be a contender in April,
but its across-the-board excellence
this season has more than made
up for the loss of three All-
American seniors.
"We're in an off-season, and I
think being the underdog always
helps psychologically," senior
Scott Schaffer said. "You can just
check (our preseason press guide)
— it says this is going to be a
'rebuilding year.' Well, little did
we know that this rebuilding year
would place us in the top three
or four teams to qualify for
NCAAs."
Ryan enters the competition
ranked No. 9 in the nation. Junior
Conrad Voorsanger is at No. 10.
Each is nationally ranked in three
different events, as is junior
Charles Loop. Schaffer is ranked
third in the nation in vault and
sixth in the parallel bars.
While each of these men has an
excellent chance to come home
with Ail-American honors, such
honors are not on any of their
minds right now. According to
Schaffer, the meet's outcome
depends on how "the whole team
comes together."

Besides the fabulous four, Stan
ford is counting on Wang and co
captain Andy Ropp. Strong scores
early in an event build a base for
elite scores by the event's final
performers. But, wait... there is
one more Cardinal to discuss.
Junior co-captain Adam For
man will finally be back in com
petition after a long layoff due to
iiyuries. If he is able to perform
close to his potential, Stanford's
chances will improve dramatically.
With Forman in the lineup, Coach

Sadao Hamada will have seven
capable gymnasts for each six-slot
event, allowing him to rest certain
gymnasts during their weaker
events.
"Adam is looking so much bet
ter," Hamada said. "We need him.
He can definitely contribute to
the team score."
"1 think (No. 2 UCLA Coach)
Art Shurlock is scared of Adam.
He keeps on asking about Adam's
situation," Schaffer said. "(Adam)
knows this is the time to turn
on, at NCAAs."

Don't laugh. If Stanford teams
knew how to hit their routines at
the NCAAs, this year's squad
might be defending a collegiate
title. In two of the past three
years, the Cardinal have entered
the NCAAs with high hopes, but
have left feeling very low. Soph
omore Tim Wang believes the
team has learned from its mis
takes.
"Last year, we were a little bit
too easy-going," Wang said.
"We all tried really hard but
there were little mistakes that we
didn't polish up on. Now we just
have to go for it aggressively with
the least possible mistakes."
Stanford, currently ranked No.
5, must finish among the top
three of the 10 championship
teams tonight in Lincoln, Neb. in
order to qualify for tomorrow
night's team finals. Individual
compulsory finals take place Sat
urday afternoon and are followed
that evening by the individual
event finals.

the meet for the seventh year, are
vying for their seventh champion
ship in eleven years. Three of
those four which they have not
won have gone to the Bruins, who
have otherwise made a habit of
finishing second.
For the Cardinal, this is a
markedly different year from
years past, when the team had to
settle for third (1986) and fourth
(1988) place trophies. In January,
there was no guarantee that Stan
ford would be a contender in April,
but its across-the-board excellence
this season has more than made
up for the loss of three All-
American seniors.
"We're in an off-season, and I
think being the underdog always
helps psychologically," senior
Scott Schaffer said. "You can just
check (our preseason press guide)
— it says this is going to be a
'rebuilding year.' Well, little did
we know that this rebuilding year
would place us in the top three
or four teams to qualify for
NCAAs."
Ryan enters the competition
ranked No. 9 in the nation. Junior
Conrad Voorsanger is at No. 10.
Each is nationally ranked in three
different events, as is junior
Charles Loop. Schaffer is ranked
third in the nation in vault and
sixth in the parallel bars.
While each of these men has an
excellent chance to come home
with Ail-American honors, such
honors are not on any of their
minds right now. According to
Schaffer, the meet's outcome
depends on how "the whole team
comes together."

Besides the fabulous four, Stan
ford is counting on Wang and co
captain Andy Ropp. Strong scores
early in an event build a base for
elite scores by the event's final
performers. But, wait... there is
one more Cardinal to discuss.
Junior co-captain Adam For
man will finally be back in com
petition after a long layoff due to
iiyuries. If he is able to perform
close to his potential, Stanford's
chances will improve dramatically.
With Forman in the lineup, Coach

Sadao Hamada will have seven
capable gymnasts for each six-slot
event, allowing him to rest certain
gymnasts during their weaker
events.
"Adam is looking so much bet
ter," Hamada said. "We need him.
He can definitely contribute to
the team score."
"1 think (No. 2 UCLA Coach)
Art Shurlock is scared of Adam.
He keeps on asking about Adam's
situation," Schaffer said. "(Adam)
knows this is the time to turn
on, at NCAAs."
