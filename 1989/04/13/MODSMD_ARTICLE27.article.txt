# Fencers fall at nationals to 'advantaged' Easterners

While the majority of Stan
ford students were out enjoying
the sun during Spring Break,
Cardinal fencers were indoors
fighting off the toughest com
petition in the nation at the
NCAA championships.
The women were coming off
a dominating victory at the
Western Regional Champion
ships in Long Beach. Now a
fencing dynasty on the West
Coast, the Cardinal women
parried their way to a sixth
straight regional champion
ship.
An expected challenge from
a talented UC-Santa Cruz team
never materialized and the
Stanford unity was unbeatable.
Possibly a better technical
team, Santa Cruz lacked this
team unity. "We definitely had
a lot of good team spirit," said
Stanford coach Sherry Pos
thumus, who claimed this team
spirit was the key to Stanford's
domination over the other
schools.
The overall team strength
was reflected in the team's
depth of talent as all five
women advanced to the direct
elimination round in the indi
vidual tournament.
Tracy Schmidt and Elisabeth
Spilman came up short in their
efforts to qualify for the na
tionals in the individual tour
nament, but still led the team
with strong performances.
Schmidt finished as second
alternate in the fifth place spot
and Spilman finished in eighth.
Olivia Judson, Grace Chang,
and Ann Marsh were the other

members of the championship
team. The women were still
without injured senior Juliet
Johnson.
The women then traveled to
the NCAA championships
where they found the compe
tition in another league. The
team went winless against the
powerful fencing traditions of
East Coast teams. Posthumus
was proud that the "team
fenced as hard as they possibly
could," but explained that they
were at a great disadvantage
to the scholarship duelists of
the Easterners.
While Stanford is unable to
offer scholarships to potential
fencers, the other schools at
tending the tournament had
fully-recruited teams. An
example is the top team from
Wayne State which had two
German and two Italian schol
arship fencers comprising their
team.
Their No.l fencer had been
fencing for thirteen years on
the Italian national team. All
of Stanford's fencers had come
up from Fencing classes.
The men's team sent two rep
resentatives to the national
championships. Sabre fighter
Mike Cramer finished in 24th
in what Posthumus classified
as one the best competitions
she had ever seen.
Nearly all the top eight
qualifiers in each weapon cat
egory were junior world class
fencers.
Even with no one in the epee
class, Cramer and Bravin
placed Stanford 17th out of 31
teams represented. Power
houses Columbia and Penn
State finished at the top.
