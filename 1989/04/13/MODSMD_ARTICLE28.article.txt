## Golfers finish Sun Devil strong 
### 
Just throw out the first two
rounds. That's all the Stanford
women's golf team needed to do
to have their best tournament
of the year. Unfortunately, all
three counted, and the Cardinal
once again finished a "we're Ed
most there" sixth place in the
Lady Sun Devil tournament that
concluded yesterday.
Stanford's furious finish, a
304 that was bested only by the
top two teams in the tourna
ment, vaulted them to respect
ability. After sitting in 12th and
10th places after rounds one and
two, no Cardinal player shot
above a 78 in the third outing.
The final tally of 943 put
them squarely in a tie for sixth
with Arizona, a solid team in
the top 10 in the nation. Going
into this tournament, Stanford
was ranked No. 12 in the coun
try.
Stephanie Davis and Adele
Moore continued to play well.
Moore, who nearly won the last
tournament the Cardinal com
peted in, averaged 78 over the
three rounds to finish 20th with
a 234. Fellow freshman Davis

did her one better, checking in
at 18th with a 233.
Davis is one of two prize
freshmen recruits from the
Pacific Northwest for Stanford
coach Tim Baldwin. Teammate
Audrey Wooding, who like Davis
is from Washington state, has
played well this year and had a
76 yesterday. Junior Stephanie
Parel scorched the Stonecreek
Club course with the Cardinal's
low round of the tournament, a
75.
Overall, the resulting sixth
place is very good, and the
squad's third round play should
carry over to the Pacific-10 Con
ference Championships April 23
through 25.

Stanford to host
Track Classic
Stanford will host Washington
and Notre Dame Saturday in
the Stanford Track and Field
Classic, a low key meet to "fine
tune" the Cardinal squad.

"We want to fine tune the
athletes and get them experi
enced," Stanford throwing coach
John Powell said.
The track races will begin at
1:30 p.m. with the steeplechase,
but the best of the field events
will start at 1 p.m. with the
women's javelin, shot put and
long jump. Stanford will domi
nate in the shot and long jump,
but in the javelin Stanford's
Erica Wheeler and Washing
ton's Shelly Sanford will battle
for the win.
The running events will be
marked by the return of two
Stanford Olympians, Patty Sue
Plummer and Jeff Atkinson. At
kinson, Class of 86, will be com
peting in the 800 meters with
another former Cardinal, Chris
tian Skoog, at 3:55.
The most important event for
the track squad will be the
men's 5,000-meters, where the
men's two healthy distance run
ners will be competing against
Washington's top athletes.
