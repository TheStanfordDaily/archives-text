Editor's note: This is the sec
ond in a three-part series of in
terviews with the slates running
for Council of Presidents.

The Council of Presidents'
Slate of the Times has no prob
lem being labeled politically ac
tive by its opposition — this
political conviction is integral to
its "vision" for a multicultural
community.
Unlike the opposing Students'
Choice slate, and the Chapar
ral's Hammer and Coffin Slate,
Slate of the Times has chosen
to focus its campaign in part on

political issues, some of which
are not Stanford-related.
Slate member Aimee Allison
told The Daily in an interview
yesterday, "You can't go in with
out being political or you lack
vision."
However, Slate of the Times
members want to end the com
mon misconception that they
cater to special interest groups.
"Our goal is to make all students
feel included . . . not shut out,"
said Allison, a sophomore.
"Most Stanford students
agree with our vision of trying
to make society better," said
Slate of the Times member Da
vid Brown, who is currently a
COP member.
The vision shared by the four

is one that "prioritizes student
involvement and needs," said
sophomore Chin-Chin Chen.
"We have three priorities: cre
ating a multicultural environ
ment, strengthening under
graduate education and serving
students (through programs like
Beat the Bookstore)."

Ingrid Nava, plan to make per

mented by the current COP, such
as Beat the Bookstore, the Used
Book Faire and the Airport
Shuttle service.
To supervise Beat the Book
store and the Used Book Faire,
they propose to recreate a Con
sumer Affairs Bureau, which ex
isted in the 19705. Other plans
include:
• stronger ethnic studies
• a TA training program and
smaller section size
• support for undergraduate pro
grams like Human Biology,
which face budget constraints
• four years of guaranteed
housing
• a 24-hour study hall with com
puters
• increased flexibility within the
Food Service program
• improved lecture notes
• an expanded ASSU Dorm Rep
resentative Program.
The Dorm Rep program repre
sents the Slate of the Times' phi
losophy that a successful student
run government involves all stu

dents. But those voices must be
heard by the administration,
Nava said.
The candidates said their past
leadership experience in the ASSU
and student of color organizations
sets them apart from the rest.
Both Allison and Brown have
held ASSU political offices. Brown
coordinated programs including
ASSU Course Consultants, the
ASSU Voter Registration Drive
and the ASSU Dorm Representa
tives. Allison is the current deputy
chair for the ASSU Senate and a
member of the Black Student Un
ion.
Chen, a member of the Asian-
American Students Association, is
a founder of the Undergraduate
Chinese-American Association.
Nava is a member of MEChA and
the co-chair of the ASSU Com
mittee on Democracy in Educa
tion.
"We are leaders who know how
to organize and mobilize students
to get something done," said
Chen.
"From our vision comes our
commitment to students and is
sues," Brown said.
