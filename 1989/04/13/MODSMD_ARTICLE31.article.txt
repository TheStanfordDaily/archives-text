The Madonna Issue
Somewhere, on some distant planet in a galaxy far, far
away, there may be a rock star for whom the release of
a new album is a greater phenomenon. But on this planet,
nobody comes close to Madonna Louise Veronica Ciccone.
Musically speaking, Madonna is well above average.
True, she's not the vocal equivalent of Aretha Franklin or
Anita Baker, but she also doesn't emulate the high, high,
high voiced bleating characteristic of other dance-oriented
singers.
Her string of Top-10 singles should be indicative enough
of at least a kernel of talent. Even the "hit-factory" producers
who turn out singles for the likes of Bananarama and Rick
Astley know that their success is fleeting. The true hit
monsters — the Michael Jacksons, the George Michaels,
the Madonnas — create their own musical identity.
But the Madonna Phenomenon starts and ends with The
Image. Each album recreates her image for the hundreds
of thousands of men and women who hungrily eat it up.
Who can forget the Madonna Wannabes in high school?
We had the bubbly pop star on "Madonna," the virginal
innocence on "Like a Virgin," the coming of age on "True
Blue" and now the repentance on "Like A Prayer."
And she manages all this without becoming a self-parody.
Michael Jackson's odd squeaky voice and single glove
were fun and trendsetting for a while, but once the media
reports started filtering in about hyperbaric sleep chambers
it all became a tad uncomfortable.
Madonna's Image is so put on that it's entirely comfort
able. Her well-timed marriage to Sean Penn just HAD to
be a publicity stunt; you only wondered whether she would
have gotten better mileage out of the whole thing if she'd
waited till Mike Tyson came of age.
So this time around we have the new Madonna. She's
single, she's religious and she drinks Pepsi. Well, she
used to dnnk Pepsi — it seems the violent/sexual religious
imagery in her "Like A Prayer" video was a bit much for
the Pepsi people whose product she was hawking with
the same tune.
More than ever now, Madonna is transcending the mind
less sex kitten image that some try to lay on her.. Her
appeal to both men and women is well documented. The
crowds at her concerts have always comprised equal hel
pings of guys and guls, and now that she's out of her
Virgin Image, Madonna is even threatening to become,
gasp!, a role model for some.
And we're just as caught up in the Madonna hype as
everyone else. Recognizing that she is the single greatest
entertainment phenomenon around, we are devoting a good
portion of today's issue to the woman and her past and
current Images.
