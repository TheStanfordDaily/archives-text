# 'The Virgin' gets religious
## After a truly blue marriage to Sean Penn, Madonna storms back with the terrific new 'Like a Prayer.'

After a two-year recording hiatus
the Goddess of Pop Music is back
on the charts with a true work of
pop art that draws heavily from
personal experience. Lyrically as
well as musically, "Like A Prayer"
proves that 30-year-old Madonna
Louise Veronica Ciccone can be
both a sex symbol and a talented
recording artist.
"Like A Prayer" is an awesome
collection of pop tunes that have
the distinctive Siren-like sound
which established the part-time
blonde in the pop scene with hits
like "Borderline," "Like A Virgin"
and "Crazy For You." However,
"Like A Prayer" transcends the an
noying, wimpy, over-produced,
lame backup band sound that char
acterizes most modern pop music
and places Madonna on top of the
pop world.
For you rocker dudes, Madonna
is to pop music what Van Flalen
is to rock.

The album begins with the title
track. A Prayer" is Madon
na's fastest rising hit and is the
best-produced song on the album.
Brushing up against religious
themes, "Like A Prayer" includes
the trend-setting style of using a
gospel choir for the chorus which
compliments Madonna's legendary
voice.
The Material Girl then proceeds
through a trilogy of songs about
relationships. "Express Yourself" is
an optimistic female's view on re
lationships and communication
within them. She urges the female
listener to "Make him express how
he feels and maybe then you'll
know if your love is real." (Easier
sung than done.)
The trilogy' continues with "Love
Song," a sexy duet with Prince.
Their voices work well together as
the song questions the basis of a
relationship with the lines "Are
you wasting my time? Are you just
being kind?" (Two questions I al
ways ask on a first date.)

Climactically completing the
trilogy is the partially autobiogra
phical "Till Death Do Us Part."
Combining first-person lyrics,
seemingly directed toward Mike
Tyson-Wanna-Be Sean Penn, with
third person choruses that provide
glimpses of a marriage breaking
down, "Till Death Do Us Part"

bottom line is "He's not in love
with her anymore."
Madonna is not one to stay
down in the dumps for long,
though, and bounces back with
