# 'The Virgin' gets religious
## After a truly blue marriage to Sean Penn, Madonna storms back with the terrific new 'Like a Prayer.' 
### Gene Anaya Editorial staff 
After a two-year recording hiatus
the Goddess of Pop Music is back
on the charts with a true work of
pop art that draws heavily from
personal experience. Lyrically as
well as musically, "Like A Prayer"
proves that 30-year-old Madonna
Louise Veronica Ciccone can be
both a sex symbol and a talented
recording artist.
"Like A Prayer" is an awesome
collection of pop tunes that have
the distinctive Siren-like sound
which established the part-time
blonde in the pop scene with hits
like "Borderline," "Like A Virgin"
and "Crazy For You." However,
"Like A Prayer" transcends the an
noying, wimpy, over-produced,
lame backup band sound that char
acterizes most modern pop music
and places Madonna on top of the
pop world.
For you rocker dudes, Madonna
is to pop music what Van Flalen
is to rock.

The album begins with the title
track. A Prayer" is Madon
na's fastest rising hit and is the
best-produced song on the album.
Brushing up against religious
themes, "Like A Prayer" includes
the trend-setting style of using a
gospel choir for the chorus which
compliments Madonna's legendary
voice.
The Material Girl then proceeds
through a trilogy of songs about
relationships. "Express Yourself" is
an optimistic female's view on re
lationships and communication
within them. She urges the female
listener to "Make him express how
he feels and maybe then you'll
know if your love is real." (Easier
sung than done.)
The trilogy' continues with "Love
Song," a sexy duet with Prince.
Their voices work well together as
the song questions the basis of a
relationship with the lines "Are
you wasting my time? Are you just
being kind?" (Two questions I al
ways ask on a first date.)

Climactically completing the
trilogy is the partially autobiogra
phical "Till Death Do Us Part."
Combining first-person lyrics,
seemingly directed toward Mike
Tyson-Wanna-Be Sean Penn, with
third person choruses that provide
glimpses of a marriage breaking
down, "Till Death Do Us Part"

presents Madonna's current
feelings about relationships. The
bottom line is "He's not in love
with her anymore."
Madonna is not one to stay
down in the dumps for long,
though, and bounces back with
"Promise to Try." In the same style

as "Love Don't Live Here Anymore" from the "Like
A Virgin" album, "Promise To Try" is a pleasant
simple ballad about Madonna herself as she enters
a new stage in her life.
The positive mood is continued with "Cherish/'
an upbeat song about finding that elusive someone
special. The song is soooooo mushy, it's almost
enough to make you sick. (It's just too much like
those damn freshman couples. Ain't they cute?)

For a change of pace, Madonna includes "Dear
Jessie," a "Yellow Submarine"/"Lucy in the Sky With
Diamonds" hybrid that includes classical strings and
swirling fantastical lyrics that captures a pop sound
other Madonna-wanna-be pop stars haven't come
close to matching.
Returning to messages addressed to her family that
she started with "Papa Don't Preach" on the "True
Blue" album, "Like A Prayer" includes the songs "Oh
Father" and "Keep It Together." "Oh Father" is the
most beautiful song on the album and relates the
painful process of breaking away from her father.
"Keep It Together" provides an idea of the impor
tance that Madonna places on family. Though times
may be rough, she reminds the listener that "home
is where the heart should be."
In a demonstration of her stylin' voice, Madonna
includes "Spanish Eyes." Similar in style to "Live To
Tell" from the "True Blue" album, but with greatly
improved lyrics, "Spanish Eyes" is a pleasant ballad
that includes religious overtones similar to those in
"Like a Prayer."
Concluding this musical journey is the cute ditty/
prayer "Act Of Contrition." Seemingly about confes
sion and life in the age of computers, "Act Of Con
trition" reminds one of The Beatles' "Revolution
Number 9" and has the best guitar playing on any
Madonna song to date.
As usual, Madonna is making waves with her open
ideas of life in the '80s. Not only has the video to
"Like A Prayer" raised eyebrows, but the conscientious
future star of "Dick Tracy" has included "The Facts
About AIDS," which provides useful information on
the inside sleeve of her album.
From start to finish, "Like A Prayer" is an album
that you can sink you ears and nose into. Madonna's
definitive pop sound ensures her security at the top
of the pop charts while her perfumed album will
enhance the smell of any tape collection.

a new stage in her life.
The positive mood is continued with "Cherish/'
an upbeat song about finding that elusive someone
special. The song is soooooo mushy, it's almost
enough to make you sick. (It's just too much like
those damn freshman couples. Ain't they cute?)

For a change of pace, Madonna includes "Dear
Jessie," a "Yellow Submarine"/"Lucy in the Sky With
Diamonds" hybrid that includes classical strings and
swirling fantastical lyrics that captures a pop sound
other Madonna-wanna-be pop stars haven't come
close to matching.
Returning to messages addressed to her family that
she started with "Papa Don't Preach" on the "True
Blue" album, "Like A Prayer" includes the songs "Oh
Father" and "Keep It Together." "Oh Father" is the
most beautiful song on the album and relates the
painful process of breaking away from her father.
"Keep It Together" provides an idea of the impor
tance that Madonna places on family. Though times
may be rough, she reminds the listener that "home
is where the heart should be."
In a demonstration of her stylin' voice, Madonna
includes "Spanish Eyes." Similar in style to "Live To
Tell" from the "True Blue" album, but with greatly
improved lyrics, "Spanish Eyes" is a pleasant ballad
that includes religious overtones similar to those in
"Like a Prayer."
Concluding this musical journey is the cute ditty/
prayer "Act Of Contrition." Seemingly about confes
sion and life in the age of computers, "Act Of Con
trition" reminds one of The Beatles' "Revolution
Number 9" and has the best guitar playing on any
Madonna song to date.
As usual, Madonna is making waves with her open
ideas of life in the '80s. Not only has the video to
"Like A Prayer" raised eyebrows, but the conscientious
future star of "Dick Tracy" has included "The Facts
About AIDS," which provides useful information on
the inside sleeve of her album.
From start to finish, "Like A Prayer" is an album
that you can sink you ears and nose into. Madonna's
definitive pop sound ensures her security at the top
of the pop charts while her perfumed album will
enhance the smell of any tape collection.

After a two-year recording hiatus
the Goddess of Pop Music is back
on the charts with a true work of
pop art that draws heavily from
personal experience. Lyrically as
well as musically, "Like A Prayer"
proves that 30-year-old Madonna
Louise Veronica Ciccone can be
both a sex symbol and a talented
recording artist.
"Like A Prayer" is an awesome
collection of pop tunes that have
the distinctive Siren-like sound
which established the part-time
blonde in the pop scene with hits
like "Borderline," "Like A Virgin"
and "Crazy For You." However,
"Like A Prayer" transcends the an
noying, wimpy, over-produced,
lame backup band sound that char
acterizes most modern pop music
and places Madonna on top of the
pop world.
For you rocker dudes, Madonna
is to pop music what Van Flalen
is to rock.

The album begins with the title
track. A Prayer" is Madon
na's fastest rising hit and is the
best-produced song on the album.
Brushing up against religious
themes, "Like A Prayer" includes
the trend-setting style of using a
gospel choir for the chorus which
compliments Madonna's legendary
voice.
The Material Girl then proceeds
through a trilogy of songs about
relationships. "Express Yourself" is
an optimistic female's view on re
lationships and communication
within them. She urges the female
listener to "Make him express how
he feels and maybe then you'll
know if your love is real." (Easier
sung than done.)
The trilogy' continues with "Love
Song," a sexy duet with Prince.
Their voices work well together as
the song questions the basis of a
relationship with the lines "Are
you wasting my time? Are you just
being kind?" (Two questions I al
ways ask on a first date.)

Climactically completing the
trilogy is the partially autobiogra
phical "Till Death Do Us Part."
Combining first-person lyrics,
seemingly directed toward Mike
Tyson-Wanna-Be Sean Penn, with
third person choruses that provide
glimpses of a marriage breaking
down, "Till Death Do Us Part"

presents Madonna's current
feelings about relationships. The
bottom line is "He's not in love
with her anymore."
Madonna is not one to stay
down in the dumps for long,
though, and bounces back with
"Promise to Try." In the same style

as "Love Don't Live Here Anymore" from the "Like
