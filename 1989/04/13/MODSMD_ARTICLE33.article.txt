# An answer to life's most mysterious question: 'What's the Rush?'
## 
### 
Welcome once again to the Wonderful
World of Rush. This spring's Rush prom
ises to be safer than ever since each Rush
party will be closely monitored by 32 nuns
from Our Lady of the Amphibious Vehicle
church in Oakland.
But before we begin, let's get into the
mood by singing some of those fun "songs"
that get sung at sorority and fraternity
Rush. We'll start with the women:
Come join the sisters of Epsilon Pi
We don't need no fathers or brothers
Our closeness at Rush time just can't
he denied
Though we'll end up despising each
other
And now the men:
Buuurpl
So there you have it, Rush is officially
underway. This year there will be 237
women rushing seven sororities — an
average of 18 active brain cells per sorority.
And an estimated 700 freshmen arc ex
pected to rush 16 fraternities, an average
of 24 pints per freshman.
No, ha ha, I jest on the last part. As
we all know, in an effort to combat prob
lems with alcohol that have plagued pre
vious Rushes, this year's Rush will be
partly "dry." This means that during the

first and third weeks of Rush any type of
beer may be served, while during the sec
ond week only Michelob Dry is permitted.
As Interfraternity Coucil President Chris
Erlin says, "Buuurp!"
Sororities traditionally have not had
problems with alcohol because, unlike the
men, the focus of their parties is on
"Mickey Mouse." I base this on my careful
observation of sorority Rush last Monday
where a number of Alpha Phi's dressed
as Mouseketcers were entertaining rushces
at Tresiddcr Union. I think the men should
look into this. ("Hey boys and girls, let's
see if Cubby can do shots of Absolut!!")
During sorority Rush, women attend
"theme parties" sponsored by the individ
ual sororities. The narrow-minded view
of these sorority Rush functions is that
the women do nothing but admire each
other's clothing and hairstyles. This is an
unfortunate stereotype. The women often
spend a great deal of time asking penetrat
ing questions to ensure that their sorority
has a diverse makeup. Questions such as
"Hey, how do you apply your makeup?"
Tnis year, women who only want to
join certain sororities arc permitted to
commit "suicide" on the final night of
Rush. "Suicide" is the process whereby a
rushcc wears fingernail polish that docs
not match her lipstick and earrings,

causing her to be permanently ostracized
from the sorority system. The men's
equivalent is "homicide," in which men
not given bids to their preferred fraternity
are permitted to murder men who are
above them on the list.
The excitement in this year's fraternity
Rush is heightened by the aggressive
recruiting techniques of the DU (pronoun
ced "Duh?") fraternity. As you will recall,
the DUs lost their house, their University
recognition, their national recognition,
their right to vote and their first born
male child because of several alleged "in
cidents" a few years back. The most leg
endary of these "incidents" was when a
burning couch was thrown out of a win
dow of the DU house.
It is not entirely clear why this was a
problem. It seems to be common sense
that if you have a burning couch in your
house you should dispose of it as quickly
as possible. Furthermore, I'm impressed
that they could light a couch on fire at
all. The couch in my dorm, for instance,
is roughly the furniture equivalent of
Stonchcngc — I think the Druids built it
as an astrological device 4,000 years ago
and then left it here after they lost their
national recognition.
The DUs think they have the best of
both worlds. "We don't have to follow

silly University rules, we can liold a wet
rush and haze to our hearts content. We're
just a happy, relaxed, carefree bunch of
guys," said one DU who begged to remain
anonymous becausc of the $20,000 reward
offered by Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano for the head of any DU.
During fraternity Rush men attend par
ties and open houses given by the frater
nities. At these functions the rushees
discuss topics of general interest to fra
ternity members, such as Aristotle's met
aphysics as it relates to the concepts of
substance, cssence and potentiality, Kant's

"Critique of Practical Reason," Spinoza's
philosophies of knowledge and explana
tion, and whether when urinating off the
roof one should strive for distance or ac
curacy.
Of course when choosing between po
tential fraternities, rushees must decide
whether they would prefer to be a member
of a housed or unhoused fraternity. In an
unhoused fraternity you have the advan
tage of fraternity companionship while still
being able to live with friends of both
sexes. In a housed fraternity you are some
what more isolated from friends who are
not members, although it is easier to mas
turbate on the roof.
Another option for both sexes is the
Afro-American Fraternal and Sororal Sys
tem (formerly the Black Greek Afro-
American System of Fraternal and Sororal
Letters). According to AAFASS president
Kim Coleman, "Our system was not
founded on the same ideals as the other
Greek system. Our goals are not the same
at all. The two groups arc not the same
things at all. They are very, very different!
I categorically deny that they have any
relation!! I am not, nor have I ever been
acquainted with General SecordM! 1 HAD
