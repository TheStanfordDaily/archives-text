# Video stars should put in more work on their personal grooming
## 
### 
I like my rock stars well
groomed and good looking.
Now before you all go jumping
on your high horses and calling
me shallow and condescending, let
me make my point. I think that
in an age when we're forced to

Alex Kostich

watch singers as well as listen to
their songs (thanks to the in
genious invention of MTV), the
least they could do is take a class
in personal hygiene or something.
Now Madonna is a prime exam
ple of how rock stars should be;
she is sexy, presentable, and she
smells nice (judging from her latest

album, which is scented). In fact,
she's the best thing since, well . ..
Elvis! Maybe she even is Elvis in
another life or something — I
mean, they both wear lots of tight
clothes and move their hips
around.
I hear there's even a theme park
under construction called Lace
land, in tribute to the Lucky Star.
And she deserves one, too, since
she respects her fans enough to
shave her armpits (okay, so she
had a fuzzy navel in Playboy a few
years back, but that was before she
was famous). Anyway, let's take a
look at some of her contemporar
ies.
U2's Bono has got a lot to learn.
While I think it's very admirable
of him to sing about war and peace

and death, let's face it, he could
use a bath. For that matter, a hair
cut would do him plenty of justice.
And if he's going to go out in front
of 80,000 to 90,000 people, then
the least he could do is use a box
of Q-tips!
Tracy Chapman, too, is a won
derful artist with many profound
things to say. But did you watch
the Grammys? She looked like she
was ready to pump gas at the local
Sunoco! At a show of such prestige,
I think Tracy would've looked just
swell in a Donna Karan or Chanel
evening gown. Maybe she could
even get away with a Claiborne, if
the look was right.
But the worst, by far, is that odd
woman-person, Sinead O'Connor.
Would you invite a bald lady with
a tatoo on her head to meet your
mom? The same can be said for
Michelle Shocked, who looks like
a lab experiment gone awry. These
people could all be appealing to
watch if they didn't do these atro
cious things to themselves.
Enough on them. Let's take a
look at the other extreme — people
like Samantha Fox or Tiffany. If
you ask me, Samantha's got po
tential. She just has to make sure
that her vinyl dresses don't
compress her to death. Tiffany, on
the other hand, is a lost cause.
Personally I'd like to see her ex
plode, but it would probably rain
mascara for the next week. She's
just sickening.
Prince would be fine if he were
a woman, but the way he dresses
makes him look more like a rude
incarnation of Liberace. In fact,
maybe he is Liberace in another
life. After all, they both wear all
those funky clothes....
It's about time people give
Madonna the respect she deserves.
She might not sing about home
lessness or the plight of stray cats,
but at least she's got a style. In
short, I just wish rock stars would
clean up their act. Literally. Think
about how wonderful the world
would be if Bono showed up on
the cover of "Esquire".. ..

Samantha Fox almost has the Madonna look, but not quite.

Bono should take a hint from Madonna. A bath and a haircut later he just might measure up.
