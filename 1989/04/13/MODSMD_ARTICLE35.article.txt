# Madonna: In song and video she sets the standard
## New video sizzles while Pepsi fizzles 
### Alex Kostich Staff writer 
Madonna and Controversy have always gone hand
in hand, ever since she debuted on "Solid Gold"
wearing little more than black underpants and a lacy
bra. Her stormy marriage to Sean Penn catapulted
her to tabloid-goddess stardom, and her sexually unin
hibited persona won her as many critics as it did fans.
After a two-year recording hiatus, the pop diva has
released a new album, and the first single, "Like a
Prayer," is her fastest rising hit on the pop charts
ever. The controversy this time, however, concerns
the video accompanying the song, which has report
edly offended the Pope and caused Pepsi to withdraw
its soft-drink commercials featuring the Material Girl.
The five-minute clip is one of the most mysterious
and ambitious videos to be seen on eMpTyV these
days, and it's easy to see why certain people are up
in arms about it; Madonna kisses a statue of a saint
and it comes to life, only to lay down next to her
on a pew . . . Madonna recieves the stigmata as she
picks up a discarded knife . . . Madonna writhes in
a field of burning crosses as her dress is on the verge
of exploding at the seams.
Sure these scenes are a bit presumptuous and
raunchy, but they have much more implied meaning
than a David Lee Roth video showcasing bikini-clad
nymphets.
The statue which comes to life is hauntingly paral
leled to a subplot in the video in which our songstress
witnesses a murder. The innocent black man accused
of the killing is actually the statue in human form.
And the scene in which Madonna dances among
flaming crucifixes is as close to the urgency of "Mis
sissippi Burning" as a music video will ever be. These
undertones of racism are barely touched upon, but
they are startling images which evoke strong emotions
in the viewer.
This is not to say that "Like a Prayer" is without
flaws. In one scene Madonna dances with a gospel
choir, her bra straps hanging down over her elbows.
The next scene shows the straps perched safely back
on her shoulders Also, a prepubescent boy in the
choir seems too preoccupied with the singer's cleavage
(he should be paying attention to the choir master).
And then, if we're really going to nit-pick, Madonna's
perm looks fake. And she needs a tan.
In all, the video is a slick but gripping work.
Although this may sound like a contradiction in
terms, "Like a Prayer" is the first intellectual music
video; you can't just sit back and watch it. Its
religiosexual imagery is ambiguous, disturbing and
thought-provoking.
