# Slaves of New Jersey, part two
## 
### Alex Kostich Staff writer 
If you can read this then you
have no business sitting through
a movie like "The Toxic Avenger,
Part II." This brainless moron of
a movie probably cost less to make
than the price I paid to see it.
I realize that I may be offending
many people by panning this
movie since the original has
achieved cult status on the mid
night college campus circuit.
The title character is a superhero
from New Jersey who used to be
a nerdy janitor until he was thrown
into a can of nuclear waste. This
caused a chemical reaction which
turned him into the hunky
monstrosity he is now. In this sec
ond episode, the Toxic Avenger is
out to save his hometown,
Tromaville, from evil realtors.
The running joke here seems to
be that New Jersey is an awful
place. (Come on, folks. We all
know that Bon Jovi originated
there. It can't be that bad.) In any
case, the Jersey jokes stink and
turn dry quite fast.
The Toxic Avenger is played by
some washed-up wrestler who put
on one of those "Payless" Hallow
een masks. His cleavaged girlfriend
is played by some up-and-coming
starlet named Bambi or Candi or
something. And the villains are all
played by Frederick's of Hollywood
models, complete with leather G
strings.
I actually know someone who
liked the first Toxic Avenger story
(I won't mention his name because
I don't have a death wish) and if
there are more of you out there,
then I suppose you deserve to see
this garbage-dump of a movie. The
only thing worse than this film is
the possibility of another sequel.



Troma
It's ugly, It's from New Jersey and It's not Bon Jovl. That's right,
The Boss is back!
