# New film is 'Nautical Attraction'

At first glance, Philip Noyce's "Dead Calm" seems
to be a taut, well-constructed thriller, destined to
become one of the more memorable jump-out-of
your-seat films of the year. But when the final credits
roll, it is painfully obvious that "Dead Calm" is just
a ripoff of 1987's "Fatal Attraction".
The first sign of the film's shameless manipulation
of its audience is in the opening sequence, a flashback

through a windshield headfirst, in slow motion.
This jolting scene, however crude, sets the premise

end when the couple rescues a shipwrecked sailor
whose past is unclear. As the film unfolds, the oceanic
hitchhiker gets crazier and crazier, until he . . . well,
until he ends up being Glenn Close in disguise.
To the film's credit, it manages to execute its
middle hour flawlessly â€” the tension builds as the
mysterious sailor starts acting a little eccentric. Di
