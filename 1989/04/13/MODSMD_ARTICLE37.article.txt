# New film is 'Nautical Attraction'
## 
### Alex Kostich Staff writer 
At first glance, Philip Noyce's "Dead Calm" seems
to be a taut, well-constructed thriller, destined to
become one of the more memorable jump-out-of
your-seat films of the year. But when the final credits
roll, it is painfully obvious that "Dead Calm" is just
a ripoff of 1987's "Fatal Attraction".
The first sign of the film's shameless manipulation
of its audience is in the opening sequence, a flashback
of a car accident in which a toddler is shown flying
through a windshield headfirst, in slow motion.
This jolting scene, however crude, sets the premise
for the rest of the plot. The child's miserable parents
decide to spend a few weeks on their 80-foot yacht
in an effort to put their loss behind them.

This therapeutic vacation is abruptly put to an
end when the couple rescues a shipwrecked sailor
whose past is unclear. As the film unfolds, the oceanic
hitchhiker gets crazier and crazier, until he . . . well,
until he ends up being Glenn Close in disguise.
To the film's credit, it manages to execute its
middle hour flawlessly â€” the tension builds as the
mysterious sailor starts acting a little eccentric. Di
rector Noyce avoids succumbing to cello music every
time a scary situation arises, opting instead for long
periods of "Dead Calm" which are much more un
predictable and terrifying.
Newcomer Nicole Kidman, as the mother is con
vincingly angry and vehement as she is taken hostage
by the maniac on board. Another one of the film's

strengths is that her character is
never a helpless woman-victim
desperately seeking salvation. In
stead, she tries outsmarting her
captor rather than just outrunning
him.
This cat-and-mouse interplay is
both suspenseful and intriguing,
especially since the backdrop is a
tiny boat with few places to hide.
Recalling a redheaded Sigourney
Weaver, Kidman means business
when she pulls out the old harpoon
gun.
However, the makers of "Dead
Calm" are not above using cheap
tactics to evoke emotional re
sponse in the viewer. The fate of
the rabbit in "Fatal Attraction" is
nothing compared to what happens
to a Scottish terrier here. And the
boiling teakettle from "Fatal At
traction" makes another obtrusive
appearance at the climax of "Dead
Calm" (many lives would be saved
if they put silencers on those darn
things).
"Dead Calm" is certainly a
frightening picture which will
crowd-please its way to box office
success. But its manipulative na
ture is insulting to the intelligence
of those who recognize it.
