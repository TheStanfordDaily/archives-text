# An amusing 'Affair' now in the Nitery

In the Drama Department's pro
duction of Eugene Labichc's "The
Affair of Rue de Lourcine," a
French farce set in Paris in 1857,
M. Lenglume (Chris Hart) wakes
one morning to find he can't re
member his activities from the
night before.
All he can recall is having snuck
out of his house to attend a ban
quet for his alma mater, the
Labadens Academy. And the next
thing he knows, he has a terrible
hangover, there's a strange man in
his bed and he finds a collection
of strange objects that must have
been accumulated in his revelry.
The stranger turns out to be
Mistingue (lan Cummings), a fel
low alumnus of Labadens. The two
of them try to recreate the previous
evening's events much to the dis
may of Lenglume's wife Norine,
wonderfully acted by Shannon
Jackson.
Norine has no idea about what's
going on and she inadvertently
contributes to the men's confu
sion. Jackson shines as the
affectionate and somewhat
befuddled wife who does her best
to deal with the situation at hand.

Her expressions and exclamations
are funny, well-timed and amus
ing.
Lenglumfi and Mistingue come
to believe that they've murdered a
coal-carrying girl and they spend
most of the play trying to cover
up their actions. Poor Norine must
nut up with her husband's sudden
lunacy and his friend's despicable
manners.
A scene at the breakfast table is
particularly funny, with Mistingue
horrifying the very refined Norine.
She continues to be flustered by
their confusing actions until the
very end.
"The Affair of Rue de Lourcine,"
translated from the French by di
rector Carl Weber, was playwright
Eugene Labiche's attempt to ex
pose 19th-century French society's
obsession with wealth and status
by veiling it in subtle humor. But
the Drama Department's produc
tion relies too heavily on the many
set-up jokes and puns to be really
funny.
Although each of the actors is
funny and capable of amusing the
audience, there is something lack
ing in the combination. Unfortu
nately, the humorous spots occur
too infrequently. This is partly due
to the poor timing and partly a

result of the silly script.
Another flaw is the singing in
terspersed into the action. None
of the principals has a bad voice,
and perhaps highlighting their or
dinary talents is intentional. But
the musical numbers do not add
much to this "farce with songs,"

which doesn't come close to being
a musical comedy in the true sense
of the meaning.

"The Affair of Rue de Lourcine"
plays tonight through Saturday and
the April 19-22 at 8 p.m. in the
Nitery in Old Union.
