# High hopes for Brit flick
## 
### Bill Fagelson 
I suppose it is not surprising
that "High Hopes" is about
hope. It's about one man's at
tempt to find hope in a world
that fails to reassure him. That
man is Cyril (Phillip Davis), the
disillusioned rebel with a lost
cause, complete with motor
cycle and leather jacket.
The film starts with Wayne,
a young man from the country,
walking down a sidewalk in
Thatcher's London.
We are introduced to Cyril
when Wayne, a newcomer to
London, asks for some help in
finding his sister's house. All
Wayne has is a slip of paper
with the apartment number and
the name of the building. Cyril
and his girlfriend of 10 years,
Shirley, end up taking him in
for the night. Wayne ends up
leaving, but he leaves like a little
kid, reminding Shirley of E.T.
Cyril and Shirley are both
anti-Thatcher, but Cyril is more
pessimistic about the world.
There is a tension between the
two over parenting a child. Shir
ley wants a baby, but Cyril

doesn't want to bring someone
into the world in which they
live.
Most of the action revolves
around Cyril's family. His
mother is a widow who has
begun to go senile. She lives in
a neighborhood that was once
a slum, but has become a fash
ionable area for the rich. Cyril's
sister is the funniest and most
pathetic member of the family.
Her husband is an obnoxious
bore who has made his money
selling hamburgers and used
cars. She tries desperately to fit
into the upper class while her
husband is using and abusing
his mistress.
"High Hopes" follows Cyril's
course through these obstacles.
He is moved at one point by
Marx's epitaph (a quote from
Marx): "The philosophers have
only interpreted the world, in
various ways,- the point, how
ever, is to change it." This idea
chases Cyril, as he sees everyone
around him, even communists,
being capitalists.

"High Hopes" starts tomorrow
at the Aquarius Theater in Palo
Alto.
