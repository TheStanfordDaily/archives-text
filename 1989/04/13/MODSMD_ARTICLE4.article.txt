# Pizza-A-Go-Go ad causes COP mishap
## 
### Baldwin Lee Staff writer 
Mishaps have
plagued recent
ASSU Elections
â€” and this year's
is no exception.
After only 8
hours and 15
minutes of cam-

paigning, the Students' Choice
COP slate was charged with
exceeding their election spend
ing limit. Although the slate's
mistake may cost them some
money, election officials said
the incident did not warrant
punishment.
Members of the People's
Platform leveled charges Tues
day afternoon that the total
production cost of Pizza-A-Go-
Go door hangers advertising
the Students' Choice COP slate
exceeded the $250 spending

maximum set by ASSU by-laws
for COP slates.
Students' Choice began dis
tributing the 10,000 printed
door hangers Tuesday morn
ing.
The Peoples' Platform, an
ASSU party, nominated the op
posing COP party, Slate of the
Times.
According to Pizza-A-Go-Go
manager Chuck Hammer, a
misunderstanding occurred
when Students' Choice slate
member Alex Hoye originally
asked how much the coupon
advertisement would cost.
Hammer said he told Hoye the
charge would be $50.
However, Hammer said he
was referring only to the addi
tional cost of printing Students'
Choice advertisments on the

back of already-existing Pizza-A-
Go-Go coupons, not the total pro
duction cost which was, in fact,
$561.75.
ASSU election by-laws require
the total material cost of an ad
vertisement to be reported as a
campaign expenditure, ASSU elec
tions commissioner Steve Krauss
said.
After speaking with current
COP member Stacey Leyton,
Hoye called Pizza-A-Go-Go man
ager Chuck Hammer Tuesday af
ternoon to confirm the door
hanger costs. "It blew his mind
when I told him the total cost,"
Hammer said.
Soon after this discovery, Stu
dents' Choice began withdrawing
the door hangers.
After a meeting Tuesday night
with Students' Choice and mem
bers of the People's Platform,
Krauss recommended that Stu
dents' Choice continue to collect
as many of the door hangers as
possible and pay for the total cost
of the door hangers that remained

distributed.
However, if the cost of the un
accounted for door hangers
exceeds the $250 spending limit,
a violation against the slate would
still exist.
Students' Choice slate member
Frank Quaratiello said yesterday
he was not able to estimate how
many door hangers were still un
accounted for.
Krauss, a sophomore, said
chances are slim anyone would
file charges if Students' Choice
complies with his suggestions.
And if charges are brought up,
ASSU Elections Hearing Officer
Ed Sun said he would rule in
Students' Choice's favor if they
had followed Krauss' suggestion.
Krauss said COP members
Leyton and Miguel Marquez
called him at 4:15 p.m. Tuesday
to voice their charge.
The Students' Choice slate had
cleared the door hanger idea with
Krauss before spring vacation,
reporting to him that the total
cost was $50.
Quaratiello said that pending
ASSU Senate approval, Students'
Choice will distribute the door
hangers after the election is over
in order to fulfill their agreement
