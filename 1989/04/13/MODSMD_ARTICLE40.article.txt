# Holocaust debate continues
## 
### Gene Anaya Editorial staff 
More than 40 years after the end of World
War II people have not come to grips with
the events of the Holocaust. Some would
prefer simply to forget that period of history,
and filmmaker Marcel Ophuls even goes so
far as to ask "Are only Jews and old Nazis
interested in Jews and old Nazis?" in his
four-and-a-half-hour interview-based docu
mentary, "Hotel Terminus: The Life and
Times of Klaus Barbie."
Ophuls interviews groups who shed light
on different aspects of Barbie's life. Several
of Barbie's fellow SS and Wehrmacht (Ger
man Army) officers provide a picture of
Barbie's youth and dedication to the Nazi
party.
From these interviews the viewer learns
that Barbie attended a Catholic school and
intended to become a priest. His father was
an alcoholic teacher who became violent
while under the influence. And his younger
brother is described by one of Barbie's high
school classmates as "not all there. You
know, a bit loony."
Several former French resistance fighters
then discuss Barbie's role in the torture
death of Jean Moulin, a leader of the French
underground. Jewish Frenchmen also dis
cuss their arrests and the torture that they
received at the hands of the man who be
came known as "The Butcher of Lyon" dur
ing his reign as the Gestapo's chief of police
in the occupied French city from 1942-44.
These interviews are personal and moving.
Former American intelligence officers
then relate how they recruited Barbie as an
intelligence contact in Europe in 1947 even
though he was "target number three" on a

list of Nazi officers wanted for possible war
crimes. They raise questions about
America's role in covering up certain aspects
of the Holocaust for political reasons.
In 1951 the Americans did relieve Barbie
of his position, but they continued to protect
him. They even provided him with a false
passport under the name of Klaus Altmann
so he could escape to Bolivia.

Are only Jews and old
Nazis interested in Jews
and old Nazis?

"Hotel Terminus/' named after the SS
headquarters in Lyon, also covers the ex
tradition, trial and conviction of Barbie. Ex
tradited in 1983, Barbie was convicted in
1987 for "Crimes against humanity," for
ordering the deportation of 44 Jewish
children from the town of Izieu to the
Auschwitz concentration camp where they
all died.
Questions are raised as to the reasons
behind the trial 40 years after the crimes
were committed. In an interview after his
arrest, Barbie said, "I have forgotten; if they
haven't, it's their problem."
"Hotel Terminus" is an involved docu
mentary about a very delicate subject. It
raises important questions regarding the
Holocaust and Barbie's case in particular.
However, it does not fill in all the details.
One who is not already familiar with the
subject may find the interviews difficult to
follow as they relate to Barbie and the
Holocaust in general.

"Hotel Terminus" starts tomorrow at the
Varsity Theater in Palo Alto.
