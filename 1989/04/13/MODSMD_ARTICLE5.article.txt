# Trustee charts a future course
## Sailing Burnham wants all undergraduates housed

Editor's note: This is the second
in a three-part series profiling
members of Stanford's Board of
Trustees.

Chances are that whatever
Malin Burnham is doing, he really
would "rather be sailing."
The 61-year-old Stanford grad
uate and current trustee is a world
sailing champion, has been at the
tiller of both the boats and the
management of the United States'
entries in the America's Cup and
is now embroiled in a court case
that could change his sport sig
nificantly.
Bom in San Diego, where he
still lives, Burnham first went
sailing when he was 10 years old.
Soon he was competing in Star
class boats — two-person, 22-foot
Olympic-class boats. His first
partner in the boat was his own
brother.
At 17, Burnham became the
youngest-ever world champion in
the Star class. Since then, he has
also won a second place award,
one third, two fourths and two

sevenths. His last Star race was
in 1978.
World War II was in full swing
during his senior year at Point
Loma High School, and Burnham
just assumed he would enter the
service after graduation.
That all changed, however, with
V-J Day in the summer of 1945.
"It kind of snuck up on me,"
Burnham said. "Coming to Stan
ford then was a simple decision.
The principle reason was for the
engineering school, and I had al
ways been West Coast-oriented."
So Burnham traveled north to
become an undeclared freshman
on the Farm. His natural interest
in math and physics pointed
toward engineering, but he soon
decided he didn't want to work
as a professional in that field.
In the end he finished the pro
gram in industrial engineering,
which included elements from
other fields he was interested in,
and took a job in the family com
pany — a real estate and mortgage
firm.
Founded by his grandfather,
John Burnham and Company was
passed down the family line until
Burnham took over the business

at age 32. He's still there today.
Outside of his business and
University activities, Burnham
continues to pursue his primary
passion — sailing.
In addition to his Star class
racing, he tried out for the Olym
pics in 1964 and 1968, finishing
second both times. Only the top
finisher went on to the Games.
