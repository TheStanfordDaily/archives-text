# Trustee charts a future course
## Sailing Burnham wants all undergraduates housed 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the second
in a three-part series profiling
members of Stanford's Board of
Trustees.

Chances are that whatever
Malin Burnham is doing, he really
would "rather be sailing."
The 61-year-old Stanford grad
uate and current trustee is a world
sailing champion, has been at the
tiller of both the boats and the
management of the United States'
entries in the America's Cup and
is now embroiled in a court case
that could change his sport sig
nificantly.
Bom in San Diego, where he
still lives, Burnham first went
sailing when he was 10 years old.
Soon he was competing in Star
class boats — two-person, 22-foot
Olympic-class boats. His first
partner in the boat was his own
brother.
At 17, Burnham became the
youngest-ever world champion in
the Star class. Since then, he has
also won a second place award,
one third, two fourths and two

sevenths. His last Star race was
in 1978.
World War II was in full swing
during his senior year at Point
Loma High School, and Burnham
just assumed he would enter the
service after graduation.
That all changed, however, with
V-J Day in the summer of 1945.
"It kind of snuck up on me,"
Burnham said. "Coming to Stan
ford then was a simple decision.
The principle reason was for the
engineering school, and I had al
ways been West Coast-oriented."
So Burnham traveled north to
become an undeclared freshman
on the Farm. His natural interest
in math and physics pointed
toward engineering, but he soon
decided he didn't want to work
as a professional in that field.
In the end he finished the pro
gram in industrial engineering,
which included elements from
other fields he was interested in,
and took a job in the family com
pany — a real estate and mortgage
firm.
Founded by his grandfather,
John Burnham and Company was
passed down the family line until
Burnham took over the business

at age 32. He's still there today.
Outside of his business and
University activities, Burnham
continues to pursue his primary
passion — sailing.
In addition to his Star class
racing, he tried out for the Olym
pics in 1964 and 1968, finishing
second both times. Only the top
finisher went on to the Games.


Malin Burnham
In the 1970s he became in»
volved with The America's Cup
and was helmsman on Enterprise,
the American boat that finished
third in trials before the final race
in the 1977 Cup.
In 1980 the skipper position be
came full-time, a commitment
Burnham did not want to make.
His involvement continued, how
ever, and in 1983 he served as
backup skipper and practice boat
skipper for Dennis Connor.
When the United States lost the
Cup that year, Burnham became
president of the Sail America
Foundation, which raised funds
to "get the Cup back from the
Australians," according to Burn
ham.
America did get the Cup in 1987
and again in 1988. But between
the two races the U.S. team
changed its boat into a cata
maran. New Zealand protested,
saying the design violated the his
tory, spirit and intent of the com
petition.
The boat was declared legal for

ties.'

competition before the 1988 race,
but on March 23 this year a New
York judge declared the
catamaran design illegal and
awarded the Cup to New Zealand.
Burnham is directly involved in
the case, which is being appealed.
He expects it to drag on for some
time. The America's Cup will not
be held until the case is resolved,
but Burnham says the cause is
important, and supports the
validity of the catamaran design.
"The court has mudJied the
waters more than cleared the air
as to future conduct," he said.
"We've gotten comments from
around the world that the results
on the playing field should never
be tampered with by a court of
law .. . that we must not allow
this to become a precedent."
Meanwhile, Burnham continues
his work on the board, to which

he was appointed four years ago.
"I owe a lot of my life, the early
training I got, to Stanford, and
I've maintained my ties,"
Burnham said.
He's been active in Stanford's
San Diego alumni club, served on
the AJumni Association Board and
Athletic Board and participated
in ail of the University's fundrais
ing campaigns since his gradua
tion.
"Nothing's very different" at
Stanford now, compared to his
own undergraduate years,
Burnham said. "It's certainly
changed in terms of physical size,
the quality of students and facul
ty, the research in small degrees.
But the spirit and dynamics ha
ven't changed in large measure."
On the board, Burnham has
devoted his energies specifically
to two areas, financing and stu
dent housing. He won't be
satisfied until 100 percent of the
student body can live on campus,
Burnham added that he has
found his position as a trustee
more difficult than he expected
because of the number of different
audiences the trustees answer to:
"It's difficult to keep things in
proper perspective," he said.
