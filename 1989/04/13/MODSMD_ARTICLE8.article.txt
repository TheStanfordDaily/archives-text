# Petition puts free speech on next Fac Sen agenda
## 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
As a result of a 551-signature
petition submitted by the Com
mittee for First Amendment
Rights, the Faculty Senate will
discuss interpretations of the
Fundamental Standard at its
meeting next Thursday.
1 he committee is concerned
that the Student Conduct legisla
tive Council's recommendations

will restrain students from exer
cising their rights to free speech.
For this reason, they petitioned
the senate to ensure that any pro
posal is carefully scrutinized
before being put in place.
The SCLC released preliminary
recommendations several weeks
ago but decided to formulate a
new interpretation after over
whelming negative reaction. They
are expected to produce a final
report early next week.
In order to get an issue on the
agenda, a petition must have the
signatures of at least 500 students
or 50 faculty members and must
be submitted to the academic sec
retary.
According to Patricia Del Pozzo,
the administrative assistant to the
academic secretary, petitions for
agenda placement are rare.
The committee's petition re
quests "the [Faculty] Senate con
sider these dual issues of free
speech and freedom from personal
harassment."
It states: "The Fundamental
Standard should not be inter
preted so as to restrict the right
to free speech as defined by cur
rent First Amendment principles."
The petition suggests that har
assment of individuals should be
considered a violation of the Fun
damental Standard whereas
speech directed toward groups —
rather than individuals — should
not be a violation.
