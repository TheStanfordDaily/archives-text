## 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
Effectively clearing the Uni
versity of any wrongdoing, the
San Francisco Superior Court
has decided not to examine a
lawsuit by Steven Mosher, a
controversial scholar who was
terminated as a graduate stu
dent in anthropology six years
ago.
Mosher, now a resident
scholar at the Heritage Foun
dation in Washington, D.C.,
consistently claimed that he
had been unfairly treated by
the University because he
publicized reports of forced
abortions in rural China. In
1986, he sued the University
for violations of free speech,
defamation and breach of con
tract, among other charges.

After reviewing material
submitted by Mosher and the
University, the court ruled last
Thursday that Stanford's in
ternal procedures had been ap
propriate.
A report released by Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
in 1985 noted more than a
dozen incidents where Mosh
er's academic work withheld
significant information, gave
conflicting versions or was pur
posefully misleading.
When Mosher filed his initial
complaint with the University,
a long grievance procedure
went into full swing, concluding
with a University Presidential
investigation in 1985 that up
held the department's determi
nation that the actions were
appropriate.
