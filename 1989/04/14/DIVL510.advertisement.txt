The Trireme
In 1981, John Morrison—a British professor—became
fascinated by the idea of reconstructing a full-scale replica of the
Ancient Greek warship, the Trireme. Today, a beautiful Trireme
is sailing in the Aegean, rowed by students, veteran oarspeople,
and enthusiasts from all over the world, including the Bay Area.
Come hear him on his dream of building this great ship, and
see his slides of the project, plus video of the actual sailing of the
vessel.
April 19th (Wednesday) at 8:00 in Branner.
