## Defense rests its case in North trial 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Oliver
North ended his testimony yes
terday after six grueling days on
the witness stand, saying he be
came sure he was being made the
fall guy in the Iran-Contra affair
when he heard himself described
at a White House news conference
as "the only one who knew what
was going on."
Attorney Brendan Sullivan
later rested his case, having called
16 witnesses for the defense.
Prosecutors, who called 29, said
they will have a few rebuttal wit
nesses today.
U.S. District Judge Gerhard
Gesell said he probably will give
the jurors Monday off while he
decides what final instructions
they will be given. He said final
arguments probably will take two
days and the case should go to
the jury on Thursday, in the 12th
week of trial.
During four days of tough cross
examination, North denied pros
ecution contentions that he lied
about his Iran-Contra efforts and
personally profited from some of
them. He said he had explicit au
thorization from his superiors —
and, he assumed, from President
Reagan — for his actions and
didn't take a dime he wasn't en
titled to.
He testified yesterday that two
days before the Nov. 25, 1986,
press conference, in which Reagan
and Attorney General Edwin
Meese 111 took part, North had
been interviewed for four hours
by Meese and aides.
He is accused of lying during
that interview. But he testified

he told them readily about "the
secret within the secret" — that
profits from arms sales to Iran
had been funneled to the guerillas
fighting the leftist government of
Nicaragua. Therefore, he said, he
was shocked to learn that he
might be the target of a criminal
investigation.
What he heard as he watched
the press conference on television,
North said, "was inconsistent with
what I told the attorney general
two days before." Meese said
North's boss, John Poindexter,
had known of the money diversion
but hadn't approved it — when,
in fact, he had.
North testified, "It was very
clear to me that this was part of
pointing the finger at Ollie North.
He was 'the only one who knew
what was going on' — which, I
must say, is the way it was sup
posed to be." North's firing and
Poindexter's resignation as
Reagan's national security adviser
were announced by Meese that
day.
Both at the trial, which began
Jan. 31, and at congressional
hearings nearly two years ago,
North said he had assumed while
he was directing covert aid to the
Contras that he would have to
take the rap if word got out about
the help, which was being pro
vided at a time that official U.S.
aid was banned.
Prosecutor John Keker's final
questioning of North concerned
two letters he wrote in December
1986 to a contractor who had in
stalled a $13,800 security system
at North's home.
