# Wright challenges ethics charges
## Democrats vow to fight, but fear polictical implications for their party 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
With his position as the na
tion's highest elected Democrat
in jeopardy, House Speaker Jim
Wright mounted an emotional
defense yesterday against
serious ethics charges and
declared he would "fight to the
last ounce of conviction and en
ergy that I possess."
In a carefully scripted 30-
minute counteroffensive
delivered to reporters and tele
vision cameras, Wright sought
to rebut point by point the
charges being lodged against
him by the House ethics com
mittee, which was writing its
final report after a 10-month,
$1.5 million investigation of his
finances.
Wright's supporters called
the appearance persuasive, but
other Democrats were agoniz
ing over the prospect that their
most visible official might be
come a political liability and
have to be deposed.
And a member of the ethics
panel, Rep. John Myers, R-
Ind., said the speech would
have no effect on the commit
tee's conclusions. "We have a
task to do, and I don't think
we'll be influenced at this
point," he said.
The committee completed
work on its report late yester
day and scheduled a news con
ference Monday morning to re
lease it. The report will include
a statement alleging that
Wright violated House rules in
several dozen instances, said a

source familiar with the inves
tigation.
Flanked by members of his
leadership team and Texas col
leagues, Wright's voice choked
with emotion as he defended
his wife, Betty, against the
charge that her $18,000-a-year
salary from a Fort Worth busi
ness partner amounts to an im
proper gift.
He said his wife was "a good
decent, caring, thoroughly
honorable person" and he
would "damn well fight to
protect her honor and integrity
from any challenge from any
source whatever the cost."
"Whether I'm speaker of the
house, which is the greatest
honor I've ever had, is not im
portant," Wright said. "What
is important is that Congress
move swiftly — and I'm
prepared to move very swiftly
— to get distractive matters of
this kind behind us so that we
can concentrate on the really
important things that affect
this country of ours."
He said his reputation "is the
most important thing and the
only really important thing.
For my good name, which is
the legacy I intend to leave my
children and my grandchildren,
I will fight to the last ounce
of conviction and energy that
I possess."
Wright declined to field ques
tions after his statement. After
his impassioned public defense,
Wright returned to the busi
ness of the House.
