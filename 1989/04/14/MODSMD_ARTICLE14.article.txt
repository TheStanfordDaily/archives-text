WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Congress over
whelmingly approved a compromise $49.7
million package of non-military aid yes
terday for the Nicaraguan Contras, giving
President Bush a chance to forge a bi
partisan policy on Central America.
The Senate completed congressional ac
tion on the measure, approving the aid
package on an 89-9 roll call vote.
The House earlier endorsed the plan,
309-110. Voting yes were 152 Democrats
and 157 Republicans. Voting no were 99
Democrats and 11 Republicans.
The congressional action represents an
effort to declare a truce in the bitter,
years-old fight between the White House
and Congress over aid to the Contras
and bring pressure on Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government to keep its prom
ises to allow free elections and democratic
reform.

united, single-voice policy," said House
Speaker Jim Wright of Texas moments
before the chamber voted.
"It ends military involvement and
covert efforts to overthrow governments
in our hemisphere," Wright said.
At the same time, he added, "It says
to Nicaragua that we are very earnest
about you fulfilling these commitments
that you made to internal democratiza
tion."

In the Senate, supporters of the bipar
tisan agreement voted down a series of
amendments aimed at altering or scut
tling a plan they said has the potential
to usher in an era of cooperation between
the executive and legislative branches of
government on Central American policy.
"If this accord is circumvented or ex
ploited, it would be an enormous blow
to the chances for bipartisan cooperation
in a broad range of areas," said Sen.
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., Democratic floor
manager of the Contra-aid package.
Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Wash., who has
voted against all other proposals to aid
the Contras, said he decided to vote for
the compromise plan after concluding
that "simply abandoning them because
they have become a political embarrass
ment would be as immoral as the policy
we were pursuing."
But Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., one of

the Senate's strongest supporters of the
Contras, called the Bush administration's
plan "little more than beans and ban
daids."
"My administration sought the least
common denominator," Helms said.
"This is not a bipartisan accord. It is an
accord that suited the other side."
"I think we made a step in the right
direction," said Senate Republican Leader
Bob Dole of Kansas after the Senate vote.
"Now we can be an active player in that
Dart of the world."
The compromise plan, reached after
more than two months of negotiations,
would provide at least a temporary truce
in the war that has been waged between
the White House and Capitol Hill since
then-President Reagan moved in 1981 to
arm the Contras as a force to battle Nic
aragua's leftist Sandinista government.
Indeed, many of the suspicions and

much of the distrust that characterized
past debates over aid to the Contras were
still visible as both chambers opened
debate yesterday.
Some members clung to hopes more
arms could be sent to the Contras; others
said all forms of aid, logistical as well as
military, should be ended.
The compromise plan would give the
Contras food, clothing and medical assis
tance to sustain them through next Feb
ruary. But it would bar aid for weapons
and ammunition to renew the guerrillas'
fight against the government.
Supporters of the compromise said it
would put the Sandinista leadership un
der intense international pressure to keep
their promises, permit free and fair na
tional elections next February, and ob
serve the other "deadlines for democracy"
set by agreements among Central Amer
ican presidents over the last two years.
