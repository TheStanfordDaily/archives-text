# Two found guilty in defense probe
## Investigation of corruption at the Pentagon gets its first convictions 
### 
ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) - Two
former executives of a California defense
contractor were convicted of conspiracy
and wire fraud yesterday in the first
trial arising from the Pentagon corrup
tion scandal.
A federal court jury deliberated nearly
36 hours over four days before returning
guilty verdicts against George Kaub and
Eugene Sullivan, former vice presidents
of Teledyne Electronics of Newbury
Park, Calif.
Each was convicted on one count of
conspiracy. Kaub was found guilty on
five counts of wire fraud and two counts
of filing false statements. Sullivan was
convicted on three counts of wire fraud.
A third defendant, Dale Schnittjer,
was acquitted on conspiracy and wire
fraud charges by U.S. District Judge
Richard Williams after the jury failed
to reach a verdict against him. Schnit
tjer is also a former vice president of
Teledyne Electronics.
All the defendants were found inno
cent of bribery, a charge stemming from

the government's contention that the
former executives knew money was paid
to a Navy engineer for inside informa
tion about a $24 million contract for
hand-held radar test equipment.
Kaub, who faces a maximum sentence
of 40 years in jail and a fine of $2
million, hung his head and stared at
the defense table after the bailiff read
the verdict.
Sullivan could be sentenced to 20
years in jail and fined a maximum of
$1 million. He appeared impassive.
Schnittjer had a hint of a smile on
his face.
Williams set sentencing for June 7 as
attorneys for Kaub and Sullivan said
they would appeal the verdict.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph
Aronica said he was pleased with the
convictions, which he called signifi
cant."This sends a message to corporate
America that they cannot wash their
hands of this type of activity," he said

after the four women and eight men
returned their verdict.
He said the government's "111 Wind"
investigation into kickbacks, payoffs and
fraud in the Defense Department's
$150-billion-a-year purchasing system
was "expanding and continuing."
The Pentagon procurement investiga
tion began in mid-1986 but was not
publicly disclosed until June 1988, when
federal agents armed with search war
rants descended on defense contractors
from coast-to-coast. ,
The first indictment was handed up(«
in January. Besides the three
executives, it names private
William Parkin and Fred Lackner£;
Stuart Berlin, a Navy official, an£ :
Teledyne Industries, the parent o£-
Teledyne Electronics.
All pleaded guilty in advance of th»;
trial except for the company
Teledyne pleaded guilty to conspiracy
and filing false statements. It paid $4.$
million in fines, penalties and damages:
