### 
MATAMOROS, Mexico (AP) -
One of the suspects in a cult of
human sacrifice pointed out the
grave of a 13th body yesterday
and police ordered him to dig it
up, badgering him as he reeled
from the heat and the stench.
"You'll do it with your hands
if you have to," one officer told
Sergio Martinez after the suspect
was handed a pick and shovel.
Martinez, 22, had been taken
back to a ranch near Matamoros,
where a dozen bodies were un
earthed Tuesday. He and other
suspects have told authorities
there were 14 bodies buried on
the ranch.
In a dramatic public confession
Wednesday, some of the five
suspects in custody said victims
were put to death in rituals that
were intended to provide a "magi

cal shield" for members of a drug
smuggling ring.
Under the gaze of police yes
terday, Martinez went to work dig
ging up the new grave and quickly
revealed the body of a man in his
30s. Martinez said the man had
been buried about four months
ago.
The suspect asked for a face
mask but was told to keep work
ing. "You didn't need one when
you buried him," an officer said.
However, Martinez was given a
mask minutes later when he said
he could not dig because of the
stench. Later Martinez collapsed
and asked for water. Two on
lookers with the police helped him
complete the job.
So far, the only victim to be
identified was Mark Kilroy, a 21-
year-old University of Texas pre
medical student who was kid

napped on the streets of Mnta
moros last month during spring
break.
The suspects have said they
killed at the demand of Adolfo de
Jesus Constanzo, whom they
called "godfather." They said Con
stanzo, 26, and Sara Maria
Aldrete, 24, called the "witch,"
believed human sacrifices gave
the members of cult protection
from harm.
Cameron County Sheriffs Lt.
George Gavito said that Con
stanzo, a Cuban who has contacts
in Miami, was last seen Tuesday
over the border in Brownsville,
Texas.
A warning that Constanzo and
Aldrete might be heading for
Miami was read to police officers
there at roll calls yesterday, but
"at this time we're not taking any
active stance on it," said Detective
Marie Chaney.
