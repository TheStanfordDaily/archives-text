SEC and Drexel settle fraud case
NEW YORK (AP) — Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. and the Securities and Exchange Commission
settled a huge civil fraud case yesterday that will
put the junk-bond giant under close federal scru
tiny for three years.
Drexel also agreed to sever its ties with fin
ancier Michael Milken, who was indicted on rack
eteering charges last month.
And the company announced that John Shad,
a former SEC chief instrumental in starting an
intense investigation more than two years ago
that led to the fraud charges, would become its
chairman.
The Drexel-SEC pact clears the way for
Drexel'a previously announced agreement to plead
guilty to criminal fraud charges and pay $650
million in fines and restitution to settle another
case with the Justice Department.
The nation's fifth-largest securities firm has

been the biggest target of a federal crackdown
on securities fraud stemming from the Ivan
Boesky insider trading scandal.
Israeli troops raid village, kill five
BETHLEHEM, Occupied West Bank (AP) —
Israeli troops stormed into a West Bank village
before dawn yesterday in a search-and-arrest raid,
triggering one of the bloodiest clashes in the
16-month Palestinian uprising. At least five
Arabs were reported killed and dozens wounded.
Elsewhere, 16 Palestinians were wounded by
gunfire in confrontations with soldiers, including
five shot in Bethlehem riots to protest the death
of a teen-ager who was wounded last week, hospi
tal officials said.
In Jerusalem, Arab witnesses said riot police
fired tear gas into the grounds of the A 1 Aqsa
and Dome of the Rock mosques, where about
300 worshipers had gathered for evening prayers.
