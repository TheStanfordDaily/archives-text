# Minor toxic spill raises questions about University safety procedures
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
Late one Saturday afternoon in
February, a bottle filled with a
cancer-causing chemical exploded
in a laboratory at the School of
Medicine.
There was no fire, there were
no injuries, there was minimal
damage. But the incident, which
University officials insist was
caused by incorrect information
on the bottle's label, has raised
questions about University proce
dures for preventing and respond
ing to such emergencies.
The explosion occurred Feb. 25
in the lab of Dr. Helen Blau, as
sociate professor of pharmacology.
No one was in the lab at the time,
but pharmacology students Bruce
Blakely and Jennifer Taylor were
working across the hall and heard
a pop.
The two students entered the
room and soon found the bottle
broken on the floor with its cap
blown off. An Environmental
Protection Agency report said
they also reported seeing a cloud
of dust. Blakely and Taylor left
the room and called the Univer
sity Health and Safety Depart
ment's emergency number.
The chemical that escaped into
the room was nitrosomethylurea,
which, according to Blau, is used
in chemotherapy, some food
preservatives and lab studies of
mutogenesis.
It is also an animal carcinogen
and is very toxic, according to
Dan Shane of the EPA in San
Francisco.

Blakely and Taylor were taken
to the emergency room at Stan
ford Hospital for observation and
tests. No ill effects were found as
a result of their exposure to the
chemical, of which 100 grams es
caped. They showered, and their
clothes were incinerated.
Blakely said the emergency
number system for Health and
Safety on evenings and weekends
didn't help matters. When he
called the number, he was con
nected with a paging operator who
then had to find the appropriate
people to call. The fire department
didn't arrive for 20 minutes, and
the first Health and Safety official
wasn't on the scene until two
hours after the accident, he said.
When chemical specialist Har
vey Chock of Health and Safety
arrived, he entered the room
wearing safety clothing and a
mask and found that a powder
had spread over a portion of the
room and settled. The EPA report
said a fume hood in the room
prevented the chemical from
spreading to other rooms through
the air system.
Besides the University and the
EPA, several agencies including
the California Department of
Health and Safety, and the Agency
for Toxic Substance Disease
Registry, became involved in
analyzing the situation, but dis
agreements among the agencies
slowed the cleanup for days.
"It took a while to get agree
ment on the proper decontamina
tion solution," Chock said. "There
was a lot of conflicting technical
information."

In the end, IT Corp. workers
scrubbed all surfaces in the room
with a solution much like vinegar.
The lab was closed for 10 days,
and Chock estimated the cleanup
cost at $30,000.
Blakely said that though he
recognized it was difficult for the
agencies involved to get accurate
information about the chemical,

he was disappointed with how
much time the process took.
"They had very little information
on hand," he said.
Blau, her students and Chock
reported the bottle's label said the
chemical should be stored at room
temperature â€” when it actually
