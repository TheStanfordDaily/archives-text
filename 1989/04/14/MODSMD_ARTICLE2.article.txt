# Minor toxic spill raises questions about University safety procedures
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
Late one Saturday afternoon in
February, a bottle filled with a
cancer-causing chemical exploded
in a laboratory at the School of
Medicine.
There was no fire, there were
no injuries, there was minimal
damage. But the incident, which
University officials insist was
caused by incorrect information
on the bottle's label, has raised
questions about University proce
dures for preventing and respond
ing to such emergencies.
The explosion occurred Feb. 25
in the lab of Dr. Helen Blau, as
sociate professor of pharmacology.
No one was in the lab at the time,
but pharmacology students Bruce
Blakely and Jennifer Taylor were
working across the hall and heard
a pop.
The two students entered the
room and soon found the bottle
broken on the floor with its cap
blown off. An Environmental
Protection Agency report said
they also reported seeing a cloud
of dust. Blakely and Taylor left
the room and called the Univer
sity Health and Safety Depart
ment's emergency number.
The chemical that escaped into
the room was nitrosomethylurea,
which, according to Blau, is used
in chemotherapy, some food
preservatives and lab studies of
mutogenesis.
It is also an animal carcinogen
and is very toxic, according to
Dan Shane of the EPA in San
Francisco.

Blakely and Taylor were taken
to the emergency room at Stan
ford Hospital for observation and
tests. No ill effects were found as
a result of their exposure to the
chemical, of which 100 grams es
caped. They showered, and their
clothes were incinerated.
Blakely said the emergency
number system for Health and
Safety on evenings and weekends
didn't help matters. When he
called the number, he was con
nected with a paging operator who
then had to find the appropriate
people to call. The fire department
didn't arrive for 20 minutes, and
the first Health and Safety official
wasn't on the scene until two
hours after the accident, he said.
When chemical specialist Har
vey Chock of Health and Safety
arrived, he entered the room
wearing safety clothing and a
mask and found that a powder
had spread over a portion of the
room and settled. The EPA report
said a fume hood in the room
prevented the chemical from
spreading to other rooms through
the air system.
Besides the University and the
EPA, several agencies including
the California Department of
Health and Safety, and the Agency
for Toxic Substance Disease
Registry, became involved in
analyzing the situation, but dis
agreements among the agencies
slowed the cleanup for days.
"It took a while to get agree
ment on the proper decontamina
tion solution," Chock said. "There
was a lot of conflicting technical
information."

In the end, IT Corp. workers
scrubbed all surfaces in the room
with a solution much like vinegar.
The lab was closed for 10 days,
and Chock estimated the cleanup
cost at $30,000.
Blakely said that though he
recognized it was difficult for the
agencies involved to get accurate
information about the chemical,

he was disappointed with how
much time the process took.
"They had very little information
on hand," he said.
Blau, her students and Chock
reported the bottle's label said the
chemical should be stored at room
temperature — when it actually
should be refrigerated.
"Clearly, the wrong information
was put down. It was definitely
a contributing factor to the acci
dent," Chock said.
Chock said the chemical had not
been used, and the bottle was still
sealed. Stored at too high a tem
perature, the chemical decom
posed into a gaseous byproduct,
building up pressure until the bot
tle exploded, he said.
The distributor of the chemical
was KNK Laboratories of
Cleveland, Ohio. KNK officials
have not returned The Daily's
phone calls.
Acting Health and Safety Di
rector Ralph Buchanan said yes
terday that his department is re
viewing the incident and will bring
the matter to the attention of the
legal office.
"If all the indications are as
they seem to be, the distributor
might share in the responsibility
for this," Buchanan said.
The role of life safety boxes has
also been called into question by
this incident. These boxes, which
are supposed to contain current
information about what and
where chemicals are stored in lab
oratories, are used by emergency
response personnel to determine
how to approach incidents such as
chemical spills.
However, the box for Blau's lab
contained information that was
last updated in August, 1985. In
addition, the information said
there were no carcinogens stored
in room R334, the room in which

the explosion occurred and the
carcinogenic chemical was re
leased.
In addition, regulations of the
state and federal Occupational
Safety and Health Administration
require shipped chemicals that
will be directly used by employees
of a company or institution be
accompanied by a materials safety
data sheet.
This sheet provides information
about the chemical and focuses
on safety precautions that need
to be followed when using it.
But no such sheet accompanied
the shipment to Blau's lab. Farzan
Rastinejad, the postdoctoral
scholar who ordered the chemical,
said all he got was a shipping
form. After the accident, he had
to ask another distributor to fax
a copy of the sheet to him.
But he added that researchers
at the Medical Center usually do
not get the required sheets from
distributors. Rastinejad said that
at Northwestern University,
where he once studied, the sheets
almost always came through. But
that has not been the case at Stan
ford, he said.
David Mendelow, associate dean
for administration at the Medical
School, said there is "no guaran
tee" that materials safety data
sheets will arrive with all ship
ments. He said the Health and
Safety Department maintains a
file of these sheets, which are
available to Medical Center per
sonnel.
But Mendelow added that
though Medical School adminis
trators are aware that the sheets
need to be in all the labs, they
currently are "unevenly distribut-

Ed" and not all labs have them.
In addition to the missing data
sheets, officials pointed out other
indications that few in the lab
exercised appropriate caution
when dealing with the toxic
chemical.
Shane, who investigated the in
cident for the EPA, said he was
surprised that Blakely and Taylor,
after hearing a mysterious pop,
did not hesitate to enter a room
in which toxic chemicals are
stored.
Taylor said she and Blakely
thought the noise was probably a
vacuum line rupture or other
pressure-related problem. "It
didn't occur to us that it could
be a chemical," she said.
Blau said the students displayed
"a normal reaction" because "ex
plosions just don't happen here."
Shane also said that when he
arrived on the scene the evening
of the explosion, the corridor had
been evacuated and signs were
posted on the doors, warning
people not to enter •
A report by the Medical Center's
News Service issued three days
after the incident said the chemi
cal exploded "for unknown
reasons" and that the cleanup was
expected to be complete "either
late this afternoon or tomorrow."
Though the lab was not open
for six more days and the reason
for the explosion was eventually
discovered, the news service did
not amend or follow up on its
original report.
The writer of the news service
release, Ron Goben, said, "It was
just a little clean-up; nobody was
hurt. There was no reason to fol
low up on it."

to the emergency room at Stan
ford Hospital for observation and
tests. No ill effects were found as
a result of their exposure to the
chemical, of which 100 grams es
caped. They showered, and their
clothes were incinerated.
Blakely said the emergency
number system for Health and
Safety on evenings and weekends
didn't help matters. When he
called the number, he was con
nected with a paging operator who
then had to find the appropriate
people to call. The fire department
didn't arrive for 20 minutes, and
the first Health and Safety official
wasn't on the scene until two
hours after the accident, he said.
When chemical specialist Har
vey Chock of Health and Safety
arrived, he entered the room
wearing safety clothing and a
mask and found that a powder
had spread over a portion of the
room and settled. The EPA report
said a fume hood in the room
prevented the chemical from
spreading to other rooms through
the air system.
Besides the University and the
EPA, several agencies including
the California Department of
Health and Safety, and the Agency
for Toxic Substance Disease
Registry, became involved in
analyzing the situation, but dis
agreements among the agencies
slowed the cleanup for days.
"It took a while to get agree
ment on the proper decontamina
tion solution," Chock said. "There
was a lot of conflicting technical
information."

In the end, IT Corp. workers
scrubbed all surfaces in the room
with a solution much like vinegar.
The lab was closed for 10 days,
and Chock estimated the cleanup
cost at $30,000.
Blakely said that though he
recognized it was difficult for the
agencies involved to get accurate
information about the chemical,

he was disappointed with how
much time the process took.
"They had very little information
on hand," he said.
Blau, her students and Chock
reported the bottle's label said the
chemical should be stored at room
temperature — when it actually
should be refrigerated.
"Clearly, the wrong information
was put down. It was definitely
a contributing factor to the acci
dent," Chock said.
Chock said the chemical had not
been used, and the bottle was still
sealed. Stored at too high a tem
perature, the chemical decom
posed into a gaseous byproduct,
building up pressure until the bot
tle exploded, he said.
The distributor of the chemical
was KNK Laboratories of
Cleveland, Ohio. KNK officials
have not returned The Daily's
phone calls.
Acting Health and Safety Di
rector Ralph Buchanan said yes
terday that his department is re
viewing the incident and will bring
the matter to the attention of the
legal office.
"If all the indications are as
they seem to be, the distributor
might share in the responsibility
for this," Buchanan said.
The role of life safety boxes has
also been called into question by
this incident. These boxes, which
are supposed to contain current
information about what and
where chemicals are stored in lab
oratories, are used by emergency
response personnel to determine
how to approach incidents such as
chemical spills.
However, the box for Blau's lab
contained information that was
last updated in August, 1985. In
addition, the information said
there were no carcinogens stored
in room R334, the room in which

the explosion occurred and the
carcinogenic chemical was re
leased.
In addition, regulations of the
state and federal Occupational
Safety and Health Administration
require shipped chemicals that
will be directly used by employees
of a company or institution be
accompanied by a materials safety
data sheet.
This sheet provides information
about the chemical and focuses
on safety precautions that need
to be followed when using it.
But no such sheet accompanied
the shipment to Blau's lab. Farzan
Rastinejad, the postdoctoral
scholar who ordered the chemical,
said all he got was a shipping
form. After the accident, he had
to ask another distributor to fax
a copy of the sheet to him.
But he added that researchers
at the Medical Center usually do
not get the required sheets from
distributors. Rastinejad said that
at Northwestern University,
where he once studied, the sheets
almost always came through. But
that has not been the case at Stan
ford, he said.
David Mendelow, associate dean
for administration at the Medical
School, said there is "no guaran
tee" that materials safety data
sheets will arrive with all ship
ments. He said the Health and
Safety Department maintains a
file of these sheets, which are
available to Medical Center per
sonnel.
But Mendelow added that
though Medical School adminis
trators are aware that the sheets
need to be in all the labs, they
currently are "unevenly distribut-

Ed" and not all labs have them.
In addition to the missing data
sheets, officials pointed out other
indications that few in the lab
exercised appropriate caution
when dealing with the toxic
chemical.
Shane, who investigated the in
cident for the EPA, said he was
surprised that Blakely and Taylor,
after hearing a mysterious pop,
did not hesitate to enter a room
in which toxic chemicals are
stored.
Taylor said she and Blakely
thought the noise was probably a
vacuum line rupture or other
pressure-related problem. "It
didn't occur to us that it could
be a chemical," she said.
Blau said the students displayed
"a normal reaction" because "ex
plosions just don't happen here."
Shane also said that when he
arrived on the scene the evening
of the explosion, the corridor had
been evacuated and signs were
posted on the doors, warning
people not to enter •
A report by the Medical Center's
News Service issued three days
after the incident said the chemi
cal exploded "for unknown
reasons" and that the cleanup was
expected to be complete "either
late this afternoon or tomorrow."
Though the lab was not open
for six more days and the reason
for the explosion was eventually
discovered, the news service did
not amend or follow up on its
original report.
The writer of the news service
release, Ron Goben, said, "It was
just a little clean-up; nobody was
hurt. There was no reason to fol
low up on it."
Late one Saturday afternoon in
February, a bottle filled with a
cancer-causing chemical exploded
in a laboratory at the School of
Medicine.
There was no fire, there were
no injuries, there was minimal
damage. But the incident, which
University officials insist was
caused by incorrect information
on the bottle's label, has raised
questions about University proce
dures for preventing and respond
ing to such emergencies.
The explosion occurred Feb. 25
in the lab of Dr. Helen Blau, as
sociate professor of pharmacology.
No one was in the lab at the time,
but pharmacology students Bruce
Blakely and Jennifer Taylor were
working across the hall and heard
a pop.
The two students entered the
room and soon found the bottle
broken on the floor with its cap
blown off. An Environmental
Protection Agency report said
they also reported seeing a cloud
of dust. Blakely and Taylor left
the room and called the Univer
sity Health and Safety Depart
ment's emergency number.
The chemical that escaped into
the room was nitrosomethylurea,
which, according to Blau, is used
in chemotherapy, some food
preservatives and lab studies of
mutogenesis.
It is also an animal carcinogen
and is very toxic, according to
Dan Shane of the EPA in San
Francisco.

Blakely and Taylor were taken
