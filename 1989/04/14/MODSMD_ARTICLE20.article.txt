Council
of Presidents:
0 Slate of The Times

THIS YEAR'S ASSU Coun
cil of Presidents race is a
clear choice among three
slates: one with a clear political
agenda, one that claims no polit
ical goals and a slate that has no
plans at all except to pull lots of
legs.
With this in mind, The Daily
endorses the Slate of the Times
for next year's COP.
The choice is made clear by the
proven experience, vision and
ability to mobilize students which
separates the Slate of the Times
from the rest of the field.
Sophomores Aimee Allison and
Chin-Chin Chen, and juniors In
grid Nava and David Brown are
impressive candidates for next
year's COP.
They are four highly qualified,
motivated and organized individ
uals who will work well as a team
— acting for improvements in
students' lives and improvements
in the University.
They are united behind a vision
of progressive student govern
ment that listens to and actively
involves students.
The Slate of the Times, repre
senting The People's Platform,
will continue this year's COP's
successful combination of serving
students' immediate needs and
pushing for long-term University
improvements based on multicul
tural perspectives.
With the base of its well
defined and unified party, the
Slate of the Times can be judged

to a great extent on the success
of the current COP.
Slate of the Times is well
prepared to build on those suc
cesses and add its own
innovations, like running a "post
office proxy" and an ASSU video
store and mandating a University
commitment to four years of
guaranteed housing.
The political agenda of the
People's Platform broadens the
scope of their goals outside of
basic student concerns, and lends
the slate a philosophy of student
empowerment to affect change.
The highly visible COP activ
ism furthering this agenda has
drawn some criticism this year.
While some of the critique is war
ranted, it does not mean politics
must be avoided by COP candi
dates. A student government by
nature should practice politics,
working for students' interests
and serving as a watchdog of the
University.
Good politicians put the wishes
of their constituents above per
sonal interests. And though the
Slate of the Times boasts mem
bers skilled at gauging student
opinion, it must be careful to
reflect student sentiment in all
actions it would undertake if
elected. They pledge to do so;-
Some critics claim that the
party's goals are too expansive
and that only a limited strategy
can be pursued — choose either
student service or politics.
But the current COP has
proved critics wrong by ac
complishing both. We should con
tinue down that same path.
