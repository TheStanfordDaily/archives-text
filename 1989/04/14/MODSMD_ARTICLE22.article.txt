## Good riddance, Marriott 
### 
IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T already
heard, Marriott will no longer be
managing Tresidder Food Service
next year. After losing thousands of dol
lars over a three year period, the corpo
ration has opted out of running the
various concessions at the student union.
I'm sure there are complex reasons
why Marriott failed in its attempt to turn
a profit at Stanford, but I think one
major factor was the structure of the
food service offered through Tresidder.
The standard fare at Tresidder is not
much better than the food served in
dorms around campus.
The problem is that students don't
think of Tresidder as a viable alternative
to going out to eat. Moat students eat at
a dormitory on campus and don't want
more cafeteria-style food after having suf
fered through it all week.
The successful elements of Marriott's
program, such as the barbeque carts, of
fer students a good alternative to dorm
food. The problem is that Tresidder com
petes against local restaurants, not Food
Service, and must offer services accord
ingly.
It's a rare occasion when students sit
ting around debating where to go to grab
a bite to eat say, "Hey, let's go to Tres
idder." I have eaten at the Corner Pocket
a few times, but other than that have
never sampled the cuisine of Tresidder.
Tresidder will never be a monetary suc
cess until students enjoy the food served
there, which is obviously not the case
now.
Marriott's departure should not be
cause for mourning. Rather it offers a

chance to solve the problems that have
plagued Tresidder in the past. Tresidder
by nature does not have to serve bland
meals that no one enjoys. Certain colleges
have solved the very problem that drove
Marriott away.
At a college near my home in southern
California, the student union has a tre
mendous eating service. They offer pizza,
burgers and the standard cafeteria fare,
but with a twist. The pizza and burgers
are provided by franchises of well
established restaurant chains.
And the best feature of the arrange
ment is that students can use their food
service cards to purchase food, in contrast
to Stanford where you must pay cash for
food of questionable quality.
I have often wondered why Stanford
doesn't have a similar arrangement at
Tresidder. I realize that certain hurdles
exist before this eould happen at Stan
ford, but the University should take ad
vantage of Marriott's departure to explore
all options for improving the quality of
service at Tresidder.
And the University must be sure to
include ample student input in any deci
sion it makes about who will run Tres
idder. In the past, decisions have been
made by University bureaucrats and
handed down, as if from on high, to
students.
Tresidder Union is, after all, supposed
to be a student union, so the students
should exercise the greatest influence in
the decision regarding its future.
From the past performance of Marriott,
it is clear that students do not support
the status quo. Change is required, not

just in management style, but alao in the
substantive organization of Tresidder.
The University should initiate a
dialogue with students. And students
have to break the mold of apathy they
are so used to and express themselves.
Student life at Stanford could be greatly
improved if Tresidder acted as a magnet
for student interaction. It is hard for
students here to imagine what a true
student union would be like, where stu
dents go to just hang out. But that is
the goal we all must seek to satisfy.
Rather than sitting back and allowing
the University to dictate whether Tres
idder will or will not be transformed into
a true student union, students must take
the initiative and make clear what they
want the new Tresidder to look like.
