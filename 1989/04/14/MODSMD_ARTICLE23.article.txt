## Consumers angry at Exxon should not buy their gas 
### 
THE DAMAGE INFLICTED upon
the once-pristine Prince William
Sound by Exxon is of im
measurable and holocaustic propor
tions. An ecosystem lies in ruin, as
entire populations — be they inver
tebrate, herring, waterfoul, sea otter,
eagle, deer or bear — face almost
certain decimation.
The economic damage mirrors the
aesthetic, with fragile fisheries choking
under the poisoned sludge. Yet as
shocking as it may seem, this destruc
tion should not appear surprising.
It is difficult to term this an "ac
cidental spill," for it was the obvious
extension of calculated and careless
corporate policies seeking out maxi
mum profits. Exxon's absurd un
preparedness and reckless disregard for
regulations, let alone civic responsibil

ity, long ago determined the in
evitibility of such a disaster. And, with
a disorganized and sluggish response,
combined with early resistance to
outside assistance, it was all but as
sured that the damage would be great.
Such rampant negligence is indefen
sible and unquestionably criminal, even
though it will not be treated according
ly. Would not an individual be
penalized severly for doing a mere
fraction as much damage to the envi
ronment?
In the aftermath, Exxon has publicly
apologized and claims to be taking all
available action to minimize the im
pact. It is difficult, however, not to
regard much of these words as
manipulative schemes to salvage Ex
xon's public image, to ensure it will
have the support to further exploit

more of the earth's dwindling re
sources.
By diverting attention toward person
nel indiscretions and away from bla
tant corporate callousness, by increas
ing gas prices, by effectively silencing
the Alaskan fisherman with much
needed employment and so on, Exxon
is successfully molding a less vocal
public.
Simply wallowing in hopeless con
tempt for Exxon is worthless; action
can and must be taken. This
catastrophe may have a silver lining if
it raises consciousness of personal
responsibility for the far-reaching
implications of one's everyday activities
and of intolerance toward those that
breach that responsibility.
We need to make the necessary,
fundamental changes in our daily,

personal habits in order to live more
harmoniously within our global ecosys
tem. Multi-use policies of public lands
are clearly inadequate for habitat
preservation.
It is time not only to halt further
exploration along the western coast
and within the Alaskan interior, but
also to support politicians willing to go
up against such corporate machines
and to aggressively seek out alterna
tive, renewable energy systems.
One cannot assume corporate respon
sibility if public consumerism doesn't
support it. I encourage the Stanford
community to actively boycott Exxon,
to return their credit cards, to voice
their anger.
