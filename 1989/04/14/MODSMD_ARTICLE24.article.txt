# The 						Women's Center shouldn't only support feminists
## 
### 
The Stanford Women's Center re
cently distributed a list of "organiza
tions at Stanford dealing with women's
issues." In addition, the answering
machine at the Women's Center lists
campus organizations dealing with
women's issues about which callers can
request further information. The Pro
choice Alliance is included in both
these listings; Stanford Students for
Life is not.
Stanford Students for Life is very
involved in women's issues such as
abortion. When I called the Women's
Center to ask if Stanford Students for
Life could be added to their printed
and answering machine lists, my call

was never returned.
Both of the Women's Center's lists
exclude organizations which do not
address women's issues from a feminist
perspective. "Woman" and "feminist"
are not synonymous terms. The Wom
en's Center should not try to mask the
narrow appeal of feminism under such
a broad title as "Women's Center."
The Women's Center should either
support organizations which address
women'B issues and views, not just

those of feminists, or call itself what it
is: the "Feminists' Center."
