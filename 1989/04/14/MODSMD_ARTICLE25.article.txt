# Graduate students perpetually ignored by ASSU, The Daily
## 
### 
Somehow I had always assumed that
the ASSU represented all students, but
apparently this is not true.
Otherwise graduate students might
have been included in the recent ASSU
Council of Presidents survey on budget
priorities.
Considering that graduate students
are as numerous as undergraduates at
Stanford, it is peculiar that graduate
student interests are consistently ne
glected by the COP and The Daily.
Once again this spring I will find

myself voting for the "Slate of Fee
Refund."
