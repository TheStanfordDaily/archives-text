Pro-lifers need to
consider the results
of illegal abortions
Abortion rights will soon be debated
again in front of the U. S. Supreme
Court. The San Francisco Examiner
ran a series of articles this week con
cerning abortion and the women's
movement.
The Examiner's Sunday coverage
emphasized the very real prospect of a
return to the era of unsafe, illegal
abortions if abortion rights are limited
in the United States.
This presents a real dilemma for
pro-life people like myself. At present I
work for a volunteer organization that
provides support to women experienc
ing unplanned pregnancies.
We try to make it easier for women
to carry their babies to term by help
ing them find inexpensive or free
prenatal care, providing them with
referrals for adoptions, or helping them
find food, shelter and medical assis-

tance if they should keep their baby.
If abortion rights are limited, there
will be an explosion in the need for
services such as these, and I think the
pro-life movement must help provide
the energy and resources for such a
need, now and in the future, if it is to
be truly pro-life.
Regardless of the amount of support
available, however, I imagine there will
still be those who seek abortions, pos
sibly at great personal risk. I cannot
foresee a way to provide for these
women, but the threat of future
hardship does not allow us to ignore
the other issues.
The other important issue, from my
viewpoint, is the right to life of the
unborn. An eight-week old fetus has
all of its bodily systems present, a
heartbeat and active brainwaves. Medi
cal technology may someday make this
age viable. Yet according to the Exam
iner's statistics, 40 percent of the
average 4,000 abortions performed
daily in the United States occur after
the eighth week.
I cannot tell you what "magic
landmark" of fetal development marks
the transformation of a fetus into a
human being with the right to life. It

most certainly occurs prior to birth,
but any demarcation line between con
ception and birth is fuzzy at best.
I have never heard a pro-choice argu
ment that definitively states that a
fetus is not human prior to some cer
tain date.
After doing this, we can then discuss
when abortions should be legal taking
into account both the right to life of
the mother and the fetus.

Undergrads' needs
are important to
school's fundraisers
After hearing a candidate for the
ASSU Senate campaign at my dorm
meeting on the issue of reducing the
size of Centennial Campaign goals be
cause, M ... the money's going for
some big celebration in 1991, I was
furious. Not only was the candidate
clueless about what the Centennial
Campaign hopes to acheive, he also

asked students to vote against their
needs.
I was particularly irritated because I
volunteer for the Office of Develop
ment, which manages the Centennial
Campaign and other University and
student development activities such as
the Spring Telethon.
The whole purpose of the Campaign,
which aims to raise $1.1 billion by
1991, is to invest in Stanford's future.
Donors designate where they want
their funds to be spent.
The Campaign's fund-raising objec
tives are structured as follows: $106
million for undergraduate education
(the largest portion of which goes to
scholarships), $180 million for science
and engineering facilities, $206 million
for support of faculty scholars and
endowments, $75 million free of
restriction (the money for lightbulbs
and new bollards has to come from
somewhere) and $533 million for sup
port of existing programs.
Contrary to what many students
believe, the program for supporting
undergraduate scholarships is one of
the most popular giving programs be
cause, as a recent University survey

revealed, undergraduate scholarships
concern alumni most.
The Office of Development does
much more than raise dollars for Stan
ford; its contact with alumni and the
general public serves a crucial public
relations role which benefits us all.
The activities and endeavors of the
Stanford community are not cheap, yet
without the support of alumni, friends,
government, business and private
foundations, tuition would be at least
twice as high, and many programs
would be impossible.
The Centennial Campaign ensures
that Stanford will have a base of sup
port to carry it far into its next cen
tury, a far cry from "some big party."
Rather than criticize a program
about which one knows nothing, I en
courage every student to get informed
and involved. Support Stanford by
ensuring its future success, or at least
work constructively towards influencing
development priorities as the COP has
done.
