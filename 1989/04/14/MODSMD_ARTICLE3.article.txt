chemicals in Stanford labora

News Analysis

When a bottle exploded in a
cancer laboratory in the Med
ical School in February,
firefighters arrived first on the
scene to contain and clean up
the chemical that had caused
the explosion.
Before entering, they read
documents in a health and
safety device — called the Life
Safety Box — that clearly

stated the laboratory contained
no biohazardous materials and
no carcinogens.
But the room did contain a
carcinogenic substance. And
the two students who entered
the room may have been ex
posed to this toxic and flam
mable chemical that is believed
to cause cancer, birth defects
and inheritable damage.
In the bottom right hand cor
ner of the yellow Life Safety
Box read the words "Approved:
Health and Safety 9/85." In al
most three and a half years
since the box was installed, no
changes were made in the con
tents and the Department of
Health and Safety had not once
inspected the lab.
Even though the students in
curred no immediate injuries
