# Are officials maintaining accurate chemical records?

Health and Safety officials
are playing hide-and-seek with
undocumented dangerous
chemicals in Stanford labora
tories, and the hazards are still
lurking, according to Univer
sity officials.

News Analysis

When a bottle exploded in a
cancer laboratory in the Med
ical School in February,
firefighters arrived first on the
scene to contain and clean up
the chemical that had caused
the explosion.
Before entering, they read
documents in a health and
safety device — called the Life
Safety Box — that clearly

stated the laboratory contained
no biohazardous materials and
no carcinogens.
But the room did contain a
carcinogenic substance. And
the two students who entered
the room may have been ex
posed to this toxic and flam
mable chemical that is believed
to cause cancer, birth defects
and inheritable damage.
In the bottom right hand cor
ner of the yellow Life Safety
Box read the words "Approved:
Health and Safety 9/85." In al
most three and a half years
since the box was installed, no
changes were made in the con
tents and the Department of
Health and Safety had not once
inspected the lab.
Even though the students in
curred no immediate injuries
and the Life Safety Boxes are not
required by law, the event under
scores one of the mcgor problems
faced by emergency response per
sonnel when they respond to a
fire, a spill or an explosion at
Stanford: The potentially lifesav
ing information that is available
is often dangerously out of date.
Most people interviewed by The
Daily agreed that the system can
be a useful way to inform
firefighters, and other emergency
response teams, about what might
be inside a laboratory that is bur
ning, obscured by an unknown
gas or coated with a chemical.
The problem, according to
Health and Safety officials, is that
they are swamped by the whole
process of cataloging the chemical
stocks which change regularly.
Another mayor problem imped
ing the efforts to make Stanford
labs safer is the resistance Health
and Safety officials say they en
counter from some researchers
who do not want to spend the
time taking inventories or do not
understand the purpose of the
boxes.
Little yellow boxes
The Life Safety Box system, de
veloped here at Stanford, is de
signed to assist firefighters or
Health and Safety teams to easily
identify what dangers might be in
the lab.
Typical inventories are given al
phabetically, but this kind of list
offers no help to someone without
the expertise — or the time — to
determine what are the possible
hazards in a lab.
The outside of the box boasts
warnings of the lab's major
hazards. In the bottom right cor
ner of the box, Health and Safety
gives its stamp of approval with
a date.
The inventories are supposed to
be updated regularly by the re
searchers. The Department of
Health and Safety is supposed to
review the chemicals, categorize
them in the proper hazard class
and fill out the forms for the Life
Safety Box themselves.
Good intent
"The concept is excellent," said
Palo Alto Fire Chief Bob Wall.
The Fire Department, Wall said,
uses the Life Safety Box system

when they respond to spills, fires
or explosions on campus when
Health and Safety officials cannot
handle them or are not available.
Despite its good intent, the sys
tem has been relatively ineffective
to date, according to many who
have worked with the system.
"The system has not been as
successful as I hoped it would be,"
said Roger McKinley, president of
Mar Sam, the Santa Clara com
pany that markets the Life Safety
Box.
"The effect of the boxes is de
pendent on how well they are
maintained," McKinley said.
The first inventory of campus
chemicals, which began at the
Medical School in 1985, has yet
to be completed.
Health and Safety specialist
Gates said the inventories will
probably not be updated every
year until about a year from now.
The problem lies not just with
mounds of paperwork, but also

with some researchers' indif
ference and ignorance about lab
oratory safety.
"The first time you go to these
people, they ask, 'What's an in
ventory?' " Burnes said about
some researchers.
One researcher interviewed by
The Daily, who had a Life Safety
Box in his own lab, said he did
not know what the Life Safety
Box system was.
Even when researchers do know
how the system works, they some
times are skeptical of their uses.
"I have rather mixed feelings
about them," said Biological
Sciences Prof. Robert Simoni, who
is the chair of the president
appointed Committee on Health
and Safety. "The intent is good."
But "they strike me as a little
impractical," Simoni continued.
"Are they going to send out for
a chemist to interpret the damn
thing?"

they are swamped by the whole
process of cataloging the chemical
stocks which change regularly.
Another mayor problem imped
ing the efforts to make Stanford
labs safer is the resistance Health
and Safety officials say they en
counter from some researchers
who do not want to spend the
time taking inventories or do not
understand the purpose of the
boxes.
Little yellow boxes
The Life Safety Box system, de
veloped here at Stanford, is de
signed to assist firefighters or
Health and Safety teams to easily
identify what dangers might be in
the lab.
Typical inventories are given al
phabetically, but this kind of list
offers no help to someone without
the expertise — or the time — to
determine what are the possible
hazards in a lab.
The outside of the box boasts
warnings of the lab's major
hazards. In the bottom right cor
ner of the box, Health and Safety
gives its stamp of approval with
a date.
The inventories are supposed to
be updated regularly by the re
searchers. The Department of
Health and Safety is supposed to
review the chemicals, categorize
them in the proper hazard class
and fill out the forms for the Life
Safety Box themselves.
Good intent
"The concept is excellent," said
Palo Alto Fire Chief Bob Wall.
The Fire Department, Wall said,
uses the Life Safety Box system

when they respond to spills, fires
or explosions on campus when
Health and Safety officials cannot
handle them or are not available.
Despite its good intent, the sys
tem has been relatively ineffective
to date, according to many who
have worked with the system.
"The system has not been as
successful as I hoped it would be,"
said Roger McKinley, president of
Mar Sam, the Santa Clara com
pany that markets the Life Safety
Box.
"The effect of the boxes is de
pendent on how well they are
maintained," McKinley said.
The first inventory of campus
chemicals, which began at the
Medical School in 1985, has yet
to be completed.
Health and Safety specialist
Gates said the inventories will
probably not be updated every
year until about a year from now.
The problem lies not just with
mounds of paperwork, but also

with some researchers' indif
ference and ignorance about lab
oratory safety.
"The first time you go to these
people, they ask, 'What's an in
ventory?' " Burnes said about
some researchers.
One researcher interviewed by
The Daily, who had a Life Safety
Box in his own lab, said he did
not know what the Life Safety
Box system was.
Even when researchers do know
how the system works, they some
times are skeptical of their uses.
"I have rather mixed feelings
about them," said Biological
Sciences Prof. Robert Simoni, who
is the chair of the president
appointed Committee on Health
and Safety. "The intent is good."
But "they strike me as a little
impractical," Simoni continued.
"Are they going to send out for
a chemist to interpret the damn
thing?"

Designed to provide vital information on hazardous materials to
emergency response teams, Life Safety Boxes such as this hang
on walls outside research laboratories all over campus.
Health and Safety officials
are playing hide-and-seek with
undocumented dangerous
chemicals in Stanford labora
tories, and the hazards are still
lurking, according to Univer
sity officials.

News Analysis

When a bottle exploded in a
cancer laboratory in the Med
ical School in February,
firefighters arrived first on the
scene to contain and clean up
the chemical that had caused
the explosion.
Before entering, they read
documents in a health and
safety device — called the Life
Safety Box — that clearly

stated the laboratory contained
no biohazardous materials and
no carcinogens.
But the room did contain a
carcinogenic substance. And
the two students who entered
the room may have been ex
posed to this toxic and flam
mable chemical that is believed
to cause cancer, birth defects
and inheritable damage.
In the bottom right hand cor
ner of the yellow Life Safety
Box read the words "Approved:
Health and Safety 9/85." In al
most three and a half years
since the box was installed, no
changes were made in the con
tents and the Department of
Health and Safety had not once
inspected the lab.
Even though the students in
curred no immediate injuries
and the Life Safety Boxes are not
required by law, the event under
scores one of the mcgor problems
faced by emergency response per
sonnel when they respond to a
fire, a spill or an explosion at
Stanford: The potentially lifesav
ing information that is available
is often dangerously out of date.
Most people interviewed by The
Daily agreed that the system can
be a useful way to inform
firefighters, and other emergency
response teams, about what might
be inside a laboratory that is bur
ning, obscured by an unknown
gas or coated with a chemical.
The problem, according to
Health and Safety officials, is that
they are swamped by the whole
process of cataloging the chemical
stocks which change regularly.

ing the efforts to make Stanford

and Safety officials say they en
