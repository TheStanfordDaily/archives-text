## Preschool paraders celebrate Week of the Young Child 
### 
Munchkins were on the march
in White Plaza Wednesday after
noon.
Celebrating the Week of the
Young Child, dozens of children
from campus children's centers
and their families picnicked in
White Plaza and then paraded
around campus, winding up in the
Quad outside University Presi
dent Donald Xennedy's office.
The Week of the Young Child,
which was officially celebrated in
the Bay Area and nationwide last
week, has been an annual celebra
tion since 1971 sponsored by the
National Association for the Ed
ucation of Young Children.
According to Patsy Williams,
who works at the Escondido Nur
sery School, the week "celebrates
the needs of young children and
young families and also gives
credit to the people who take care
of the children." The celebration
aims to focus national attention
on the need for quality child care

programs, she said.
The parade was one of several
held on Bay Area college cam
puses to thank University officials
for their support of campus
children's centers.
Led by guitar-playing parents,
the marchers carried balloons and
sang children's songs as they
wound through campus. They
presented balloons to several Uni
versity officials, including Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons.
Finally, outside Kennedy's of
fice, a rousing chorus of "Old Mac-
Donald Had A Farm" brought
Kennedy himself out to talk to
the children, who presented him
with balloons as well.
The kids, mostly children of
Stanford students, faculty and
staff, attend the Bing Nursery
School, Children's Center of the
Stanford Community, Escondido
Nursery School, Pepper Tree Af
terschool Program and Stanford
Arboretum Children's Center.
